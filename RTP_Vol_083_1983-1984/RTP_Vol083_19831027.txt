NUMBER7

for 3 years by SAC

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee voted Monday to suspend a
Washington and Lee student
convicted on drug charges for
three years, extending a one-
year suspension recommenda-
tion by the Student Control
Committee, according to Dean
of Students and SAC Chairman
Lewis John.

Thomas J. Rohrig, a W&L
senior at the time, was con-
victed Sept. 9 on charges of sell-
ing marijuana and possession of
marijuana with intent to sell.

Rohrig’s case, which is still
under study by officials of the
Rockbridge Circuit Court in a
pre-sentence examination, was
brought to the university’s at-
tention upon his arrest last
spring, Dean John said.

The SAC, which is composed
of undergraduate class
presidents and vice-presidents
and law school class presidents,
followed normal procedure in
using the facts presented in
Rohrig’s court trial in its judg-
ment of the case.

At its Oct. 18 meeting, the
SCC voted unanimously to sus-
pend Rohrig for one year.
Under university regulations,
any recommendation for sus-
pension or expulsion must be
reviewed by the SAC which is a
student-faculty body.

The SAC met Monday and
voted to override the SCC rec-
commendation and suspend
Rohrig for three years effective
immediately. He will be eligible
to apply for re-entrance in
September, 1986, Dean John
said. Rohrig will be officially
withdrawn from the university
until that time.

Dean John explained that
each case of suspension heard
by the SAC. is treated. indi-

vidually.

“There are certainly no
automatic penalties resulting
from any particular charge,”
Dean John said. ‘‘Each case is
considered individually accor-
ding to the facts and cir-
cumstances,’ he said.

The members of the SAC are;
Dean John (Chairman), Dan
Murphy, assistant dean of
students, Professor H. Laurent
Boetsch, Professor John M.
Evans, Marshall K. Follo, Bob
Jenevein, Emery Ellinger, Tim
Schurr, Kelly Wrenn and
Charlie Alcorn.

Although the Washington and
Lee Board of Trustees has tabl-
ed action on the proposed
pavilion until February, ‘‘they
seemed very seriously in favor
of the idea,” according to Ex-
ecutive Committee  vice-
president Dave Judge.

SAB revives Fall

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

The W&L Student Activities
Board will launch its revamped
Fall Weekend tomorrow night
and the SAB-sponsored func-
tions will continue until Satur-

day night. The weekend will in-
clude a two-band party Friday
night in Doremus Gym and a se-
cond band party Saturday at
Zoilman’s Pavilion after the
football.

Friday night’s festivities will

begin the weekend with two
bands that will appeal to a wide
variety of taste. Doremus Gym
(the old gym) will feature The
Grandeurs and the Dads. The
doors will open at 8 p.m. and
proper identification is re-
quired. The bands will begin
their sets around 9. Refresh-
ments will be served on the up-

per level balcony (25* or 5 for a

dollar). The SAB has con-
structed one large stage on
which both bands will set up
their equipment. The two bands
will alternate sets.

“I thought they were very

pushed it through.”

Judge said that one factor
favoring the pavilion was that

The Grandeurs have been

and a wider variety of music.
The eight-member band known
for their flashy outfits and high-
steping dancing will play oldie
beach tunes and progressive
funk.

The Dads will round out the
music with their own style of
rock and roll. The Dads are a
four-piece band who plays their

Jerry Darrell, manager of
Evans Dining Hall, had re-
quested stacking chairs and
folding tables that could be easi-
ly stored when special events
are scheduled for the dining
hall. However, Darrell said he
could rescind that request if the
pavilion were built, according
to Judge.

Also last weekend, the board
officially asked President John
D. Wilson to ‘‘re-examine the
general question of coeduca-
tion.”

In a statement released Mon-
day, James M. Ballengee of
Philadelphia, rector of the
board, said, ‘‘. . American col-
leges and universities are now
facing an unprecedented fall-off
in the number of high school
graduates who will enter upon
collegiate study.

“The board is determined to
do everything it reasonably can
to insure the high quality of
students who, in future, will be
attracted to Washington and
Lee.”’

Letters to the Editors Student wants W&L unique

Coeducation will help

remove Minks’ masks

To the Editors:

In spite of the large quantity
of nonsense that has been ut-
tered recently, some warm con-
gratulations are in order. To
Scott Tilley for his plea for in-
tellectual debate on coeduca-
tion. To Jim Murphy and Scott
Stockburger for some of their
insights into the issue. To Joe
Cadle and Pete Whitehead for
daring to take the risks of voic-
ing unpopular opinions. And
lastly to Markham Pyle for pro-
ving once again that the spirit of
Archie Bunker is alive and well
in the good ol’ U.S. of A. I spoke
of risks. On a campus this size,
one cannot possibly remain
anonymous. Those dissenters
who have not already been out-
cast risk being ostracized for
not *follwoing the status quo.
Heaven forbid that anyone out
of the mainstream should be
allowed to represent or help to
better the school.

My approach to the issue of
coeducation is quite different
from that of most students. I try
to view it from an intellectual
and human outlook. I am speak-
ing from my head and my
heart, not from my emotions
and my glands. Therefore, this
letter is addressed primarily to
those who are either undecided,
or willing to listen to discussion
on the issue.

The first thing one must look
at when considering university
policy is the purpose of institu-
tions of higher learning. While
many choose to look to the
future, or listen to the voice of
tradition, I feel these must be
secondary to the concerns of the
present and to the guiding prin-
ciples of education. The purpose
of a university is three-fold: to.
achieve a greater intellectual
capacity, to learn about oneself
and to learn how to live with
others.

The academic level of
Washington and Lee is com-
paratively high, but that does
not mean it cannot be improv-
ed. The faculty took a large step
forward in this regard last year
when it increased the distribu-
tion requirements, but this is
not enough. Intellectual pursuit
must take place outside the
classroom as well. When was
the last time you heard an
ideological discussion or debate
outside the classroom? Most
conversations deal with either
social activities or how to juggle
them with academic require-
ments. Of necessity, the all-
male atmosphere has complete-
ly separated the social world
from the academic world, and
this separation leads to conflict.
Unless the two can be melded
together somehow, there will

always be serious conflicts and

choices to be made between the
two. This can only be achieved
by coeducation.

The second purpose of the
university is for the student to
learn about himself. For the
first time in his life, the student
is thrown in with multitudes of
people with differing back-
grounds and values, and he
must shape his opinions without
parental assistance. He must
discover who he really is, and
how he really feels about things.
How can he decide if he must be
constantly changing masks?
Granted, at any school there
will be the two worlds of
academics and non-academics
that must be faced differently,
but this is heightened at W&L as
I explained earlier. In fact,
three separate roles must be
played here. There is the stu-
dent who is trying to do well in
class. There is the guy who is
trying to establish a certain
relationship with the other guys
on campus. There is the male
who must act quickly and
decisively with the females
since there is not enough time to
let a relationship grow natural-
ly. How can a person find his
true self if he must be three peo-
ple? While not a complete cure,
coeducation could limit this to
two which are somewhat linked.

Thirdly, universities are for
learning how to live with other
people. Despite popular belief,
girls are people too; and those
who don’t believe it will have to
face this reality eventually. An
all-male _ institution auto-
matically cuts this function in
half. So often we grow depress-
ed by life and need the comfort
of a gentle embrace —someone
physically saying ‘‘I care and
I’m rooting for you.” Social con-
vention prevents this between
males. What our education
lacks is human love and com-
passion, and learning ways to
help each other survive. This
can be learned only by ex-
perience — not from a textbook
or a philosophical essay.

For these reasons, I whole-
heartedly support coeducation.
I would like to conclude this let-
ter with a challenge to all
students. Figure out why you
feel the way you do about
coeducation (or anything else
for that matter) and let people
know what you come up with.
Write it down —or better yet,
talk to each other. If you should
feel like some serious conversa-
tion, I’m always willing and
easy to spot. Just look for the
guy with the long hair and a six-
week beard who is wearing a
ridiculous shirt.

Larry Butler
Class of ’84

To the Editors:

I would first like to commend
Joseph Cadle on his incredible
letter of two weeks ago that
outlined the bias that in-
dependents are subject to at
this university. His letter ad-
dressed a very real problem
faced by W&L if it is to remain
the fine institution it is.

This letter does the same
thing, but the problem it deals
with is much more urgent.

As the eloquent Markham
Pyle noted last week, the threat
of coeducation requires all our
action. In this light I address
the proponents of coeducation,
particularly Mr. N.P. White-
head, whose letter also ap-
peared last week.

Mr. Whitehead contends that
“the social problem here is
totally unnatural.’’ Well, of
course it is. At no other time in
your life will you be given the
choice of five different parties
to attend every Friday and
Saturday night, with free drink
and entertainment provided.
This is because college life itself
is unnatural, and it is even more
unnatural at coed colleges,
where for four years you live
within walking distance of a
dormitory full of unmarried
females your age.

Of course the social at-
mosphere here is unnatural.
But going coed will not change
it one bit: The same girls will
still be at the same parties.
Much-needed attempts to clean
up the social atmosphere are
being made by President Wil-
son with the IFC, and it is in this
area only that changes can be
made.

At an all male school one
realizes that he must be outgo-
ing and social in order to meet
girls. W&L teaches its students
a lesson and a skill in this
respect that they would never
gain if they were able to take for
granted that women would
always be right there. When
men graduate from college
there won’t be a dorm full of un-
married females right next
door — they will have to go out
and find them. And I think it is
those students who have failed
to mature socially who would
have us go coed. They want
girls living just down the street
or in the hall upstairs because
they can’t cope in the social
world.

And when I say social world,
please, Mr. Whitehead, don’t
conjure up that irrational and
very tiresome image of a W&L
man dragging somebody’s
screaming daughter up the
stairs and nailing her to a bed.
This myth is only perpetuated
by sarcastic letters like yours
and Mr. Cadle’s. If you do not
like this type of behavior (as I
don’t), then avoid the people ex-
hibiting it. The majority of
social gathering places on cam-
pus don’t display this type of
behavior.

Yes, Mr. Whitehead, ‘‘uni-

que”’ — that’s the word Bob
Jenevein used. And here is the
sentence that Bob Jenevein us-
ed: ‘It seems that many at the
school believe the all-male
status has quite a lot to do with
the uniqueness of the institu-
tion; and that to remove that
would be to transform the in-
stitution into something it has
never been and to destroy what
was.”’ Now I defy you, Mr.
Whitehead, to suggest
—seriously this time — that
W&L is not a unique school. Of
the many colleges that offer an
outstanding liberal arts educa-
tion, W&L is the only one that is
all-male, so taking away the all-
male status would mean that
W&L would no longer be unique.
Taking Mr. Jevenein’s word out
of context Mr. Whitehead tried
to suggest that W&L isn’t even
unique in Rockbridge County
because VMI is all-male also.
Now isn’t it a little ridiculous to

To the Editors:

Mr. Pyle’s editorial, which I
had the opportunity to see on a
visit to W&L last week, is the
same argument made by stu-
dents (and administrators) in
the ’60s against integration
—‘they have other choices..”
This is not a reason to avoid
coeducation, it has always
simply been an excuse to main-
tain a (white) Anglo-saxon pro-
testant male supremacy. Be-
tween each of the lines is the
real fear — that ‘“‘they,” in this
case women, may change an

suggest that VMI and W&L are
identical? W&L is unique in the
world.

Yes, Mr. Whitehead, I even
read the unedited version of
your letter that was tacked to
the Colonnade. I read it ‘“‘the
way it was written, before it
reached the editors of the Ring-
tum Phi,”’ and I counted twelve
grammatical errors, five spell-
ing errors, and one sentence
that was completely incom-
prehensible. Consider yourself
lucky that the Phi editors left
some bits out and even cor-
rected the spelling of our Mr.
Cadle’s name.

For those of you who don’t
read grafitti, Mr. Whitehead ex-
plained in the unedited version
that when he came to W&L,
“the fact that it is all-male oc-
cupied a space low on my list of
priorities.”” But now that he’s
here, it seems, he doesn’t like it,

environment which ‘we’ve”’
come to like; we’re on top and
want to stay there as long as
possible; and most of all that
“they” may prove true our
greatest fear —they may see
through us or be smarter than
us, or do better than us, or re-
ject US! They may put us on
equal footing with them so that
we have to prove our ability not
have it taken for granted.

The safest solution is don’t
give them the chance. Hang in
there guys, and good luck.

Exhaustive, disoriented,
and hate-mongering

To the Editors:

It is not often I find myself
compelled to reply to letters to
the editor, but the irrational
epistle of Messrs. Stockburger
& Murphy of 20 October bids me
to take up my pen.

In one exhaustively long,
disoriented and hate-mongering
letter, Messrs. S. & M. vilified:
Bob Jenevein, Charlie Alcorn,
Scott Mason, Ian Banwell,
President Wilson, Emery Ell-
inger, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, the Executive Committee,
Student Control Committee,
and young ladies from “the sur-
rounding women’s colleges.” (I
apologize to any other person or
group who felt insulted, but I

tired in my attempt to make a
complete list.)

Let us first consider the peo-
ple who are so heinous in the
eyes of Messrs. S. & M. The
preeminent crime all these
folks share is their love and con-
cern for Washington and Lee.
The student body knows of the
competence, skill, and self-
sacrificing attitude of these
gentlemen in their constant
striving to enable Washington
and Lee to be the best it can be.
W&L was built by the fruits of
similarly minded men as these,
and has continued to prosper
because W&L renews this
resource in each generation of

CBS blunder imperils free

 

Gentlemen don’t

press and fair trial rights

By CLARK R. MOLLENHOFF

In broadcasting the De
Lorean tapes on October 23,
1983, CBS officials have stirred
a new storm on the Free Press-
Fair Trial issue in a manner
that does nothing but cast the
press ina bad light.

The short term damage is bad
enough in the waste of govern-
ment money and time in delay
of the trial of automaker John
Z. De Lorean on charges of traf-
ficking in cocaine.

United States District Judge
Robert Takasugi properly
postponed the criminal trial
scheduled for Nov. 1, and says:
he will not even try to set a new
trial date until at least Nov. 8
when he can assess the impact
of the CBS television broadcast
of De Lorean examining a suit-
case purportedly containing co-
caine.

Howard Weitzman, an at-
torney for De Lorean, said ‘lI
don’t think he (De Lorean) can
ever receive a fair trial.”

Because of the broadcast and
rebroadcast of the videotape of
De Lorean with the suitcase and
his arrest by FBI agents, Weitz-
man has an arguable point
because important evidence
dealing with his client’s guilt
was broadcast nationally on
CBS, and news items relative to
the content and the broadcast of
those tapes have been in news-
papers and newsmagazines
from coast to coast.

Prior to the broadcast of
those videotapes, CBS was
aware of the arguments of
lawyers for the prosecution and
for the defense that airing of
those tapes would make it im-

possible for the criminal trial to
start on Nov. 1, as scheduled —
only a week and one day after
the CBS broadcast.

Judge Takasugi had properly
warned lawyers for the govern-
ment and the prosecution of the
necessity of avoiding broadcast
of the tapes or distribution of
other potentially inflamatory
evidence that could con-
taminate the panel from which
the trial jury was to be selected.

That responsibility was im-
posed upon the trial court by the
Supreme Court in its ruling that
upset a murder conviction on
grounds that a trial judge in
Cleveland had permitted a cir-
cus atmosphere in the court-
room and the press had publish-
ed inflammatory news stories
and editorials that made it im-
possible for the defendant to get
a fair trial.

While accepting the First
Amendment rights of a free
press to publish freely what
took place in court, the
Supreme Court stated that the
trial court had the responsibili-
ty to maintain a proper at-
mosphere in court and to im-
pose specific restraints on
police officers, witnesses, and
counsel for both sides to prevent
publication or broadcast of in-
formation that might inflame
and prejudice potential jurors.

It was under the decisions of
the Supreme Court in the Dr.
Samuel Sheppard case and
subsequent decisions that
Judge Takasugi acted in seek-
ing to protect the judicial pro-
cess in ordering CBS not to
broadcast the FBI videotapes it
had obtained from Larry Flynt,

publisher of Hustler magazine.
Flynt confirmed that he had
purchased the De Lorean tapes
from a man who represented
himself as a ‘government
agent.”’

Although Judge Takasugi’s
order was entered for the pro-
per purpose of blocking publica-
tion of FBI tapes that had been
illegally and improperly obtain-
ed through prosecution. or
defense lawyers, CBS lawyers
found a way to circumvent
Judge Takasugi’s protective
order.

The Supreme Court in the
“Pentagon Papers’’ case had
ruled that the First Amendment
rights of the press barred any
“prior restraint” upon publica-
tion or broadcast unless there
was a demonstrated clear and
present danger of a catas-

trophic national security
disclosure.
Arguing that the First

Amendment decisions barred
any imposition of prior
restraint, CBS appealed Judge
Takasugi’s order to a panel of
the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. That court’s ruling that
the De Lorean tapes could be
aired by CBS was not in any
sense an approval of CBS’s
broadcasting of the ill-gotten
tapes. It was a ruling that under
existing rulings of the United
States Supreme Court that the
courts do not have the authority
to interfere with a broadcast
unless it can be demonstrated
that there will be catastrophic
national security consequences.

Although the prosecution ap-
pealed to the United States
Supreme Court, Justice William

By BEN HALE

I’ll borrow a line from Andy
Rooney to start this off: Do you
know what makes me mad?

Some people actually enjoy
writing on the doors of the
library elevators. I find it very
hard to understand why or how
a Washington and Lee student
can, in good conscience, deface
a public area — in the library of
all places. I think most W&L
students enjoy telling their
friends at large, regulated
schools how we have no rules —
except that we are expected to
be honorable gentlemen at all
times. This public and some-
times crude grafitti certainly
speaks well of our ‘honorable
gentlemen.”’

Our loosely defined honor
system, which is one of the
strongest in the country, il-
lustrates perfectly that at W&L
we expect more of each other
than at ordinary schools. A lot
of the talk against coeducation
centers around the conviction
that W&L is special — a
gentleman’s college.

It seems to me that those who

 

write on the walls

 

 

write on elevator doors are do-
ing their best to display
Washington and Lee as near in
character and mind level to a
bush-league, juvenile delin-
quent center. I recently heard a
professor refer to W&L students
as “‘a chosen group.”’ This is a
nice thought — which is
destroyed with one trip down
the elevator. It is a shame when

My View

student recruitment tours use
the stairs to avoid letting the
parents of prospective students
see the broad evidence that
honor, pride, and tradition
aren’t as important as we claim
they are.

I realize that this complaint
applies to a few low-lifes. So, to
you I say — please keep grafitti
on fraternity bathroom walls or
in your own pitiable minds
—but, not in a public place
where it misrepresents the en-
tire university.

 

 

Rehnquist and Chief Justice
Warren Burger refused to in-
tercede and stop the broadcast.
Again, it would be incorrect to
state that either Chief Justice
Burger or Justice Rehnquist
“‘approved”’ of CBS_ broad-
casting the De Lorean tapes.
They were simply demonstrat-
ing a restraint on the power of
the court at a time when CBS
was pushing its rights to the
point where it was disregarding
the Sixth Amendment rights of

De Lorean to a fair and speedy
trial, and the rights of the
government toa fair trial.

In exercising its right to
broadcast the ill-gotten tapes,
CBS officials gave no detailed
explanation for the decision
that would obviously permeate
the airwaves with inflam-
matory and highly prejudicial
information. It was explained to
the New York Times by Ed
Joyce, the president of CBS

Phi seeks to solve circulation mystery

By SCOTT MASON

“It’s a rip off,’’ the student
said tossing aside the sheet of
paper which at the top read
“Ring-tum Phi Subscriptions”’
in bold letters.

A lot of students may have
had the same feeling seven
weeks ago when they passed the
Ring-tum Phi table near the end
of the matriculation line.
Parents whose sons signed
them up last year for a Phi
subscription rarely got the
paper despite paying the $12
subscription fee.

This year the fee has been
raised to $14. That, combined
with the apparent inefficiency
of the Phi last year in getting
issues mailed to subscribers
may have deterred many
parents from subscribing this
year. They’ve learned their
lesson. No longer, it appears,
are they going to be suckered by
the Ring-tum Phi out of Phis
they pay for but never get.

The problem last year was

with the circulation manager,
current chief editors Rick
Swagler and John Cleghorn
said. A lot of times he never
took the Ring-tum Phis to the
Post Office to be mailed.

He’d let the papers pile up.
When he finally got around to
delivering them to the Post Of-
fice, he’d take about three or
four issues at a time, Swagler
said. Consequently, when
parents did get copies of the
Phi, they were already several
weeks old.

Reader’s

Advocate

 

The circulation manager quit
in the middle of last year.
“There was just no incentive for
him to do his job,’’ Cleghorn
said. “The papers come in from
press Thursday afternoon. That
means sitting up half the night

folding, stapling, and stamping
some 300 papers so that they’re
ready to go to the Post Office
Friday morning.

Although there have been a
few complaints by subscribers
this year, the Phi thinks it’s got
the problem pretty well in
hand...well, almost anyway.

This year under Circulation
Manager Todd Barstow, the
Phis are getting to the Lex-
ington Post Office promptly
Friday morning. Barstow and a
team of helpers prepare the
paper for mailing Thursday
night.

But it seems only half the pro-
blem has been solved. No one in
the Phi office appears really
quite sure what happens to the
Phis once they’re dropped off at
the post office. At that point, it’s
out of their hands.

The post office is responsible
for seeing that the papers are
mailed on time, Barstow said.
The Ring-tum Phi isn’t to blame
if they don’t reach the sub-
scribers.

“There’s nothing I can do
about it once they get to the post
office,” Barstow said. ‘‘It’s not
our fault. We deliver them as
soon as we can. From then on,
it’s up to the post office.”

But the post office claims that
it’s been mailing the papers
almost immediately after
they’re delivered Friday.
“They’re normally mailed the
same day or the next day,”
Harry Lewis, superintendent of
postal operations in Lexington
said.

About 375 Ring-tum Phis a
week are mailed under a third
ciass permit which the Phi pays
the Lexington post office.

But the Phis don’t go straight
to the subscribers. The whole
bundle is put in one bag and sent
to a post office in Northern
Virginia, Lewis said.

“It’s a mystery what happens
to the papers there or if in fact
they ever reach that point.”

Normally if all goes well, if all
the addresses are correct, if the

papers are sent from Lexington
and mailed from Northern
Virginia to the subscribers, the
long-awaited Phis will finally
arrive at their proper destina-
tions. It’ll take only a few days
if the Ring-tum Phis are going
to parents whg live in-state.
Outside Virginia, it can take as
long as a week and a half, ac-
cording to Lewis.

All this means that the
system whereby Ring-tum Phis
are mailed to subscribers may
not be as good as it should be.
' After all, parents are paying for
the campus newspaper, and
they should get it and get it on
time. But right now there
doesn’t seem to be too many op-
tions. And, judging from the few
complaints registered by sub-

scribers this year, the Ring-tum
Phi may have ironed out its pro-
blems enough to satisfy its
customers. What was last
year’s rip off may now be a $14
bargain.
 

 

Committee considers dropping spring term

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Faculty discontent with
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s six-week spring semester
has led to formation of a
faculty-student committee to
determine if the spring
semester should be dropped
from the school’s under-
graduate calendar.

Eight professors were ap-
pointed to the committee by
University President John D.
Wilson and two students by the
Executive Committee of the
student body after the faculty
committee on courses and
degrees voted 5-2 May 17 to
recommend that Wilson form
such a committee.

Several members of the com-
mittee, which began meeting
last month and‘is expected to
report to the faculty by April,
said it is divided in its opinions
regarding the spring semester.
The main alternative being
discussed is a 30-week calendar
split into two 15-week semes-

‘Within the faculty there has
been some discontent with the
12-124 plan (W&L’s current
calendar, which has two 12-
week semesters and the six-
week semester) ,’’ said Dr. John
Wise, chairman of the commit-
tee.

“Six weeks is just too short of
a time to present some of the
course material that is present-
ly being offered. The course
load for the students may be too
low, and some of the students
may be treating some of their
courses too cavalierly.

“Some are using spring term
for Goshen parties rather than
academics.”

Those feelings were prevalent
last spring when the courses
and degrees committee made
its recommendation, according
to senior Rob Woods, a student
representative to that commit-
tee who is now on the calendar
committee. Senior Lee Feld-
man is the other student
member.

“Some teachers were com-

plaining that students weren’t
putting out,’ Woods said. “I
pointed out that it was partly
the teacher’s fault as well...But
some courses aren’t what I
would consider respectable.
Some must be revised or im-
proved. If not, I think we should
go to a 15-week term.”

The calendar committee has
met three times and is still ac-
cumulating information, Wise
said. A questionnaire will be
sent to faculty members and
department chairmen within
the next week. Feldman and
Woods are preparing a student
questionnnaire that probably
will be distributed before
Thanksgiving vacation.

The questionnaires will
survey the opinions of the facul-
ty and students as to what type
of calendar they feel would be
most effective at W&L.

“We're not limiting discus-
sion to the 12-12-6 and the two
semester calendars,’’ Wise
said. The questionnaire will in-
clude such possibilities as the
4-1-4 calendar used by Sweet
Briar and Hollins Colleges, that
provides for a short semester in
January.

The questionnaire also will
determine if faculty members
have enough class meetings
during both the 12-week and the
six-week semesters.

Wilson said in a recent inter-
view that he could understand
the faculty’s not having enough
class time, particularly during
the six-week semester.

“There is a feeling that while

the six-week term provides
great opportunities in certain
fields, for the greater part it
doesn’t function very well.

“‘T can see the problem of con-
centration because I’m familiar
with the field of literature. I’m
mostly concerned with what
can provide us with an optimum
academic experience for the
students and the most satisfac-
tory teaching experience for the
faculty.

“You can read ‘Hamlet’ for a
lifetime and not fully under-
stand it.”’

Because Washington and
Lee’s school year ends later
than many other universities;
Feldman said, many students
have expressed concerns over
the availability of summer jobs.

‘A lot of students want to get
out early because they feel all
the summer jobs are taken by
the time they get home, and
they’ll get the jobs no one else
wanted,’’ Feldman said.

“I don’t see it (spring
semester) harming anybody,”
he said. “If it’s utilized to its
fullest potential, it can only
help. It’s up to the students to
take advantage of what’s of-
fered.”

The other student represen-
tative, Woods, disagrees. ‘I
would like to see some way to
improve the six-week term to
make it more legitimate,’’ he
said.

The split between the two stu-
dent representatives typifies
the split among the committee
as a whole. Woods said four of

the professors on the committee
were in favor of change and
four were opposed.

“The committee is sort of
mixed in its feelings,’ Wise
said. ‘‘We have members who
are quite approving of the
12-12-46 and others who think
that we ought to go to the
semester system.”’

“The committee is definitely
giving it a fair viewpoint,”
Woods said. “‘They’re not bias-
ed one way or the other.”

Both student representatives
said their goal was. to ensure
students a voice in any decision.

“The faculty does not have to
listen to the students,’ Feld-
man said. ‘But I think they’ll
make a significant attempt to.”’

“T think the best way is to find
out what interested people have
to say because we want thought-
out responses,” he added.

I think this faculty subcom-
mittee is very interested in
what students have to say.”

After receiving the commit-
tee’s report in April, the faculty
could make a decision on the
calendar either later in the
spring or next fall, Wise said.
He added that any changes
could become effective with the
1985-86 academic year.

Faculty members of the sub-
committee are Dr. Harlan
Beckley, Dr. Jay Cook Jr., Dr.
John Jennings, Dr. George Ray,
Dr. Taylor Sanders, Dr. Edgar

. Spencer, Dr. Buford Stephenson

and Wise. Registrar Harold
Head is an ex officio member.

EC downs paying poll watchers

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night not to pay
students to man polls during
elections.

Sophomore representative
James White proposed such an
action last week in light of the
recent throwing-out of a
freshman’ class__ election
because no one was watching
the polls. The EC had postponed
a decision until this week.

“It’s a way of getting a
positive incentive to get some-
one to go out there,” White said.
“Throughout history, things
have worked a lot better when
there’s been some kind of
reward.

“TI don’t see anything morally
wrong with paying people to
man the polls. I think that we
need some permanent solution
to get this problem alleviated.”

Nine EC members disagreed
with White’s assesment and
voted against the motion. Their
arguments, though, included
the rationale of having anyone

at the polls at all.

“‘The freshmen are kind of in
the dark about why there needs
to be people manning them,”’
said freshman representative
Andy Caruthers, who added
that it seemed to be “‘undermin-
ing the honor code.”’

However, said junior rep Cole
Dawson, ‘‘There are going to be
people who commit honor viola-
tions. It’s inherent in the stu-
dent body. All it takes is one
person. I think for that reason
alone there ought to be someone
there.”

“T don’t see that it’s

necessary to pay _ people,”
Dawson added.

Classmate Darby Brower
agreed. ‘‘I don’t like the idea of
people getting money for sitting
with the polls,” he said.

EC President Bob Jenevein,
upperclass law representative
Jim Green and White voted for
the motion, which failed 9-3.

In a related matter, the EC
voted unanimously to hold a poll
on the question of whether the
plus-minus grading system
should affect upperclassmen.

That poll will be taken before
Thanksgiving break.

Also Monday night, the EC
heard budget reports from the
Calyx, the Ring-tum Phi and the
Mock Convention.

Dave Killenbeck, business
manager of the Calyx, said any
fraternity that failed to pay past
bills by March 1 would not get
its picture in this year’s year-
book.

Steve Lewis, co-chairman of
the Mock Convention, reported
on four or five different
methods being used to raise
money.

These include letters to
parents and alumni and an arti-
cle in an upcoming issue of the
alumni magazine.

Lewis also said that some
bonds may have to be sold
before maturity because they
will not mature until after the
convention. He described the
loss involved as ‘‘not substan-
tial,’ though, and said that cash
flow should not be a problem.

Iwo sentenced Monday
for September assault

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Two Lexington men were
sentenced Monday in Lexington
General District Court to six
months in jail each for the Sept.
18 assault of two Washington
and Lee students.

John Davis and Daniel Long,
who immediately appealed
their sentences, were given the
option of $500 cash bail or $1000
bond each. The appeal is
scheduled to be heard in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court on Dec. 7, 1983.

The two men were charged
with the assault and battery of
W&L junior Ed Buttarazzi and
senior Roger McDonough.

Hess sentenced them to 90
days in jail on each count for a
total of six months.

Davis and Long confessed
their involvement to police
shortly afterward, but the two
students did not lodge charges
against their attackers until
Oct. 12, when warrants were
delivered to Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton.

The warrants were served

shortly after they were received
by police. Sutton said he had
‘“‘no idea” why the W&L stu-
dents waited so Icng before
pressing charges.

Sutton said that the unusual
confession came when he and
investigating officer Torben
Pedersen were questioning the
two.

‘*‘We wanted to know for sure
who did it. We started asking
some questions, and they ad-
mitted it,’”’ Sutton said.

so he wants W&L to change to

. suit him.

And this is what chafes me
the most. If some students find
that this school isn’t right for
them, why don’t they go to
another school that suits their
taste better, instead of trying to
change a very distinctive school
like W&L? Get thee to a nun-
nery. You remind me of the
Iranians who held mass demon-
strations in Washington, saying
just -thow much they hated
America and burning American
flags, then popped the kids back
in the Buick and hurried home
so they could catch the ’Skins on
TV.

I know many guys who came
to W&L because it is all-male,
because that is what they
preferred. If you find that you
don’t like the idea of an all-male
school, then transfer to one that
isn’t. Now, let’s pretend, Mr.
Whitehead, that you walked into
a room that had 20 chairs, but
the one you chose to sit in was
all lumpy. Would you call an
upholsterer? No! You would
move to another chair! If you
catch my drift. I don’t mean to
sound too particularly nasty
here. It’s just that I really don’t
think it’s fair that the choice of
going to an all-male college is
being taken away by guys who
made the wrong choice in pick-
ing a college.

Pyle noted last week, ‘“‘Let open

the door to one so fundamental
a change, and nothing can stop
the tide.” If W&L goes coed, our
sports teams — including the
lacrosse team, which already
competes at a disadvantage in
Division I — will have a smaller
pool of men from which to
choose. So then the cry will go
up for W&L to bastardize itself
by giving athletic scholarships,
an idea that has been suggested
before. Next will come a growth
in the student body and, lo and
behold, with tradition crumbl-
ing behind us, we become as fat,
lazy, and bloated as our cousins
in Charlottesville. When Mr.
Jefferson created his universi-
ty, he made it small and all-
male for a purpose. Now his
University of Virginia pays peo-
ple to play sports for it, the
Honor Code has become the
Don’t-Get-Caught Code, and
poor Tom is turning in his grave
like a pig roasting ona spit.

And I don’t even want to talk
to the people who say we have to
go coed to stay alive financially.
Changing the _ philisophical
structure of this university for
monetary reasons would make
W&L a whore. As Messrs.
Stockburger and Murphy noted
in their letter last week, if W&L
were to go coed, it would have to
be for ethical reasons. For-
tunately, there are none.

Granted W&L has problems
right now, but none of them, ab-
solutely none of them will be
cured by going coed. Letters
like Mr. Cadle’s and Professor
Margand’s of last week will
help. Increasing the number of
women professors could help
cure the misogyny and male
chauvinism. President Wilson’s
attempts to straighten out the
fraternities will help.

These are the areas in which
changes can and should be
made. Best of all, these changes
won’t destroy our school.

IFC self-improvement committee formed

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

An Interfraternity Council
Committee on Self-Improve-
ment and a University Ad Hoc
committee on Fraternity Af-
fairs have been formed by the
IFC and W&L President John
D. Wilson respectively to
develop some standards and
guidelines for the fraternities at
Washington and Lee.

The IFC committee on self-
improvement is composed of
the 17 fraternity presidents and
IFC officials, according to IFC
President Emery Ellinger.

Its formation follows a
meeting of President Wilson

and the IFC and a consequent
resolution to make an effort
toward improving fraternities
separately and as a group.

The IFC committee has held
only one meeting and sugges-
tions were made to help im-
prove the physical appearance
of the houses, problems with
security at open parties, and the
Rush system at W&L.

The committee stressed that
each fraternity should work
closely with its respective house
adviser and form a priority list
of needed improvements rank-
ed in order of importance. The
use of a capital improvements
fund, which is a_ fraternity
assessment to be invested and

set aside for use only in the case
of an emergency also was
recommended by the commit-
tee.

Concerning the problem of
security at fraternity parties,
Ellinger said there is definitely
more awareness among the
houses on campus. The commit-
tee still made a proposal that
each fraternity be equipped
with a lock that is bolted from
the inside of the room.

In regard to Rush, the com-
mittee suggested four alter-
natives. These include keeping
the rush system as it is, shorten-
ing the length of rush, holding
freshman orientation earlier in
the year or having a deferred

rush to be held either in the se-
cond term of school or later in
the first term.

Many arguments were heard
at the meeting and according to
Ellinger, the majority of the
fraternity presidents and IFC
officials feel that the fraternity
rush structure should remain
unchanged.

“‘We have a fine-tuned Rush
calendar which takes into con-
sideration both the freshmen
and the fraternities,”’ Ellinger
said.

Committee Chairman Wade
Brannon agreed with Ellinger.

“‘We think the Rush system is
a good thing for the freshmen,”’
he said.

Both Ellinger and Brannon
also said they felt the Rush
calendar, which approved by
the Student Affairs Committee
each year, provides an ade-
quate amount of time for the
freshmen to both study and
become involved in the affairs
of the university. Nevertheless,
Ellinger said, the IFC will place
more interest on the academic
endeavors of the freshmen in
the future.

Mann predicts close race for
Commonwealth’s Attorney

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Democratic Commonwealth’s
Attorney candidate Larry Mann
says the citizens of Lexington
and Rockbridge County are
“ready for a change” and that
he is the candidate with the best
chance of unseating incumbent
John Read Nov. 8.

“IT think he may be surpris-
ed,’”’ Mann said in an interview
this week. ‘“‘But my feeling is
that it’s going to be extremely
close either way.

“If it were a two-way race, I
could be more confident, but in
a four-way contest the vote can
go so many different ways.”

He does not view either of the
other two challengers as a
distinct threat to his candidacy.

When independent Robert N.
Joyce entered the race, Mann
said ‘‘the way [Joyce] perceiv-
ed it, he was in the middle”’
and would draw votes from both
Read and Mann.

Larry Mann

“It’s not developing that way,
though,”’ Mann said. “I’m get-
ting people crossing over from
John and voting for me. I’ve
gotten a lot of that in the last
week.”’ :

Mann said that an ideal race
would be ‘‘between two strong,
viable candidates. Bucky
[Joyce] is certainly a viable
candidate, but he’s not a strong
one.”’

According to Mann, indepen-
dent James T. Adams ‘‘has

   

been a wondertui asset to the
campaign. Jim is willing to call
things exactly as he sees them.

‘“‘He’s unafraid of any of the
consequences of his remarks.
He’s an appealing individual,
but not a strong candidate.”’

Mann said he sees broad dis-
satisfaction with the perfor-
mance of incumbent John
Read. ‘‘Some people don’t like
that hard attitude that every of-
fender has to serve time,’’ he
said.

“The main issue as I go
around talking to people is the
need for a change. Some people
want change for the sake of
change; others have questions
about Mr. Read’s conduct.”’

Mann said that “‘in order to
effect that change in a four-way
race, one candidate needs to get
a substantial block of votes.

“The voters need to get
behind the candidate that has
the best chance of winning if
they’re committed to making
that change.”’

His perception that he is the
candidate with the best chance
“is just a feeling I get from go-
ing out there and talking to peo-
ple. With my background, I
have a very broad base of sup-
port.”’

Calling Read’s conviction
rate ‘‘abysmal,’’ Mann says he
disagrees with the incumbent’s
entire approach to the office.

“The theme of my whole can-
didacy is that the person in that
office should be able to exercise
good judgment for the
Commonwealth,’’ Mann said.

“Mr. Read tends to ask for
jail or penitentiary time
regardless of the circum-
stances. To me, that is not the
proper exercise of judgment.

“John’s position is an easier
way to approach the office. I see
the job as very challenging.”’

Mann thinks his view of the
role of the Commonwealth’s At-
torney is in agreement with
both ‘the legal description’

and ‘‘the needs of the communi-
."

“It is not purely an adver-
sarial role,’’ he says. ‘When
you stand before the court as
the Commonwealth’s Attorney,
you stand clothed with the full
power and responsibility of the
Commonwealth.

“By definition, you have con-
flicting duties. You are respon-
sible for the protection of the in-
nocent as well as the protection
of the interests of the Common-
wealth against criminal con-
duct.”

One change Mann said he
would make is to devote all of
his time to the office. ‘“‘Based on
my observation of the office for
quite a while, the Common-
wealth’s Attorney should be
available at all times,” he said.

He also says he would reduce
the office expenses. ‘‘There are
tax dollars that can be saved
—there’s no question about it,”’
he said. “‘That’s part of your re-
sponsibility.

“But I wouldn't cut the
budget just for the sake of cut-
ting the budget — only as need-
ed.”’

Death of meal-in-a-peel :

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Siaff Reporter

Letitia P. Evans Dining Hall
may not be like home, as food
service director Jerry Darrell
told this year’s freshman class,
since he doesn’t know one’s
idiosyncrasies, such as whether
your mother butters your toast
from left to right or right to left.
Darrell did stress that the din-
ing hall is receptive to all sug-
gestions, yet in last spring’s din-
ing hall survey, an overwhelm-
ing majority of students
answered the question, ‘‘Is din-
ing hall management receptive
to suggestions?” with the
response, ‘“‘We’ll see after this
survey.”

The time to see has come, as
the 350 questionnaires dis-
tributed in the dining hall last
spring elicited about 200
responses. After personally
reading all of the twenty-
question survey sheets, Darrell
has made some_ sweeping
changes in Evans Dining Hall.

Darrell normally runs on a
four-week menu cycle, which he
alters slightly so that no two
weeks are exactly the same, but
for the first time in six years, he
has revamped the entire menu.
“You have to remember that
when you take something off,
you must put something else

on,” explains Darrell, who
eliminated a number of un-
popular items such as ‘‘meal in
a peel,” from the menu.

Students now have lunch
items in addition to breakfast.
Both eggs and omelettes to

breakfast changes begun last
spring.

Choice, half-pound, rib-eye
steaks are now offered twice a

until 9 a.m., rather than 8:45, so
‘“‘A”’ hour people can eat after
class ; root beer has been placed
on the lunch and dinner menus,
and ice cream is served more
often.

The food service director was
most surprised by the trend
from meat and potatoes to
vegetables and_ health-
conscious meals. ‘‘There are a
lot more vegetarians and non-
meat eaters here than I realiz-
ed,’”’ Darrell said. Thus, many
lunches now include a_ vege-
tarian third entree, as well as
non-meat casseroles’ with
seconds.

Overall, many of the sugges-

tions were acted upon. ‘We

can’t make everybody happy
every day (but), I feel very
strongly that I have a handle on
your group,’ said Darrell,
whose door is always open to
suggestions. Why go out of one’s
way to pass out a questionnaire
if few people use the suggestion
box, and freshmen are notor-
ious for gaining ‘‘the freshman
fifteen” pounds per year? Dar-
rell thinks people feel conscious
about using the suggestion box
on the door, and he may move it
back to the salad table. And
besides, adds Darrell, ‘You
can’t rest on tomorrow with
what you did yesterday.”’

Martinez trains
Samurai actors

Entertainment

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“‘T have spent all my life try-
ing to find the correct technique
for teaching acting and move-
ment,” said Joseph Martinez, a
new drama professor at Wash-
ington and Lee University and
director of “‘Rashomon,”’ which
opens Nov. 4 at 9 p.m. at W&L’s
University Theatre.

Martinez, 36, is enthusiastic
about his new job at W&L for
that reason “I am enamored of
the true liberal arts focus at
Washington and Lee,”’ he said.
After 12 years of teaching at
such schools as Purdue, the
University of Denver, the
University of Chicago, Virginia
Commonwealth University and
the University of Illinois, he is
convinced that ‘‘drama should
be taught at either professional
theatre schools like Juilliard, or
liberal arts colleges like W&L.”’
He cites the geographic isola-
tion of many “‘pre-professional”’
drama programs at major uni-
versities as a hinderance to
what he calls ‘‘pragmatic’’
theater education.

On one wall of his office at the
University Theatre are 17
featureless masks, each wear-

ing a_ different expression.
Propped in one corner and lying
across a bookcase shelf are
several samurai swords, which
he forged himself for
‘Rashomon.’ Weapons and
combat have long interested
Martinez, who wrote a_ book,
““Combat Mime,” on the art of
fighting on the stage. He
describes the book as being ‘‘100
illusions of how to smash peo-
ple’s heads against brick walls
and things like that.”’

Martinez, who was on the fen-
cing team as an undergraduate
student at Illinois Wesleyan
University, fought with almost
every weapon since the ancient
Greeks while he was doing
graduate study at the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts in
London. That experience with
the academy’s weapons collec-
tion was extremely valuable to
him because he was able to
learn the method of fighting
with each one.

“This was particularly im-
portant with the earlier
weapons, because it wasn’t un-
til the 1400’s that there was any
written record of methods of
fighting with these weapops,”’
he said.

He has also fought in full com-

Gridders fall to Sewanee

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals football team had
several outstanding individual
performances last Saturday,
but these efforts were not
enough as the University of the
South Tigers defeated the
Generals, 16-10.

The Generals got over 200
yards rushing from the tailback
position alone, as junior Gene
Girard had 133 yards on 24 car-
ries while freshman Kevin
Weaver had 101 yards on 18 car-
ries.

“Gene Girard had probably
the most impressive perfor-
mance of his college career
with 133 tough yards,” said
head coach Gary Fallon.
“Kevin Weaver came in and did
an exceptional job in spot du-
a.

However, Fallon was not as
pleased with his team’s perfor-
mance on the whole. He said
that his team ‘“‘lacked overall
team performance both defen-
sively and offensively. We need
to cut down on our mental
mistakes and recapture that
team concept.”’

Sewanee took an early 60
lead when quarterback Mark
Kent scored on a 35-yard run in
the first quarter. The Generals
were quick to answer as
Girard’s 12-yard touchdown run
put the finishing touches on an
80-yard drive. James White ad-
ded the extra point, giving the
Generals a 7-6 half-time lead.

Sewanee regained the lead in
the third quarter as a result of a
42-yard field goal by Tiger
kicker Tom Langston.

Early in the fourth quarter,
James White gave the lead back
to the Generals by kicking a 36-
yard field goal, making the
score, 10-9. This lead was short-
lived, however, as Reggie Ben-
son scored the game-winner for
the Tigers on a three-yard run
with 5:22 remaining in the

game.

Trailing 16-10 in the waning
moments of the game, the
Generals had a chance to pull
the game out after linebacker
Kurt Specht blocked a Tiger
punt that was recovered at the
Sewanee 17-yard line. The Tiger
defense rose to the occasion,
however, sacking quarterback
Bobby Wilson on the final play
of the game.

“‘We have to play better than
we did at Sewanee, and I have
to coach better than I did at
Sewanee,” Fallon said. ‘‘We
have to put it behind us and

The brain and pain

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...Watching the New York Ci-
ty Marathon last Sunday arous-
ed my curiosity about the
athlete and pain. Granted there
are a number of purely physical
aspects in the athlete’s battle to
deal with injury, and pain
varies as the athlete does, but
there are most certainly points
where the mind enters the con-
flict. It was this conflict that ap-
peared so noticeable in the
marathon. (Thank you, ABC,
for your fine coverage.) It has
been said that the brain’s poten-
tial is unknown, limitless for all
intents and purposes. What
seems even more astounding is
the power that man’s nerve
center wields over his body.
When the mind’s power to shut
out pain becomes greater than
the body’s ability to create pain
—an entirely feasible and
perhaps necessary quality in
the athlete — man’s ability to
succeed (finish a marathon in
this case) can become as
limitless as the brain’s capaci-
ty. In Sunday’s marathon, a
man who had never run a
marathon before led the race

come back strong.”’

The loss evened the Generals’
1983 record at 3-3. W&L hosts
ODAC foe Bridgewater College
this Saturday with hopes of
returning to winning ways. The
Eagles are 0-6 on the year, but
coach Fallon believes that his
team ‘‘can’t take them lightly
or else we'll be 3-4 in a big
hurry. Bridgewater has beaten
us three of the last five times
we’ve played them, including a
year ago (a 28-13 Eagle victory)
up at their place. They always
play out of their socks against
us.”

McBryde keeps on running

For Washington and Lee
senior Angus McBryde, the
decision to become a distance
runner was a pragmatic one.

As a seventh grader in his

native Charlotte, N.C.,
McBryde wanted to get involv-
ed in a varsity sport.

“I wasn’t very good at foot-
ball, and my father had run
track,” recalls McBryde. ‘‘So I
decided on track.”’

But McBryde began his track
career as a sprinter competing
in the 100- and 220-yard dashes.

“It took two meets to
establish beyond any doubt that
I was not a sprinter. That’s
when I decided to try dis-
tances,’ McBryde says with a
grin.

“I began running distance
before the running fad really
kicked in around the country.
Those of us who were running
back then were pretty much out
there alone. Now it seems
everyone is running.”’

But McBryde is still ahead of
the crowd.

He is as comfortable running
across the wooded hillsides on
the Generals’ picturesque five-
mile cross country course as he
is circling the track at Wilson
Field as the premier distance
runner on W&L’s track and field
team.

“It would be hard for me to
choose between my track and
cross country experiences,”’
says McBryde. “I love them
both, but for different reasons.”’

One obvious reason that
McBryde loves both is that he
has been so successful at both.

Last spring as a member of
the W&L track and field team
he set new W&L records in both
the 5000-meter (14:54.1) and
1500-meter (3:53.6) events and
became only the third Wash-
ington and Lee athlete ever to
qualify for the NCAA Division
III Track and Field Champion-
ships.

Already this fall McBryde has
reestablished himself as the

Generals’ top cross country per-
former. He has been the first
W&L runner across the finish
line in each of W&L’s first three
meets. Moreover, he has im-
proved his time with each per-
formance and was the indi-
vidual winner in last Saturday’s
quadrangular meet with

Catholic University, American
University and Eastern Men-
nonite. He won that event in a
time of 26 minutes, 52 seconds.
“There is a lot more strategy

 

involved in running cross coun-
try than non-runners might
realize. You have to know
where you can pick up time on a
given course. It’s important to
plan your strategy ahead of
time based on the course that
you are running:

‘Washington and Lee has the
toughest cross country course
in the state, in my opinion. It’s
also one of the best to run
because you get out in the
woods and can really lose touch.

You can lose yourself in the
country.”

McBryde’s best cross country
performance at W&L came dur-
ing his sophomore year when he
ran a 25 minute, 48 second race.

“Tt should be capable of
reaching the low of 25 minutes,”
says McBryde. “‘That’s my goal
right now.”’ 2

Another of McBryde’s goals
involves making the field for
the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships, which will be held in

Newport News, Va., in Novem-
ber.

“T really believe that we have
a chance to qualify as a team
for the nationals,’ says
McBryde, who was the top run-
ner among independent high
school athletes in North
Carolina during his senior year
at Charlotte Latin. “This is my
last opportunity to compete in
the national cross country
meet, so it’s clearly one of my
major goals this season.”

A tale of two sports

After two seasons and one
game as a tight end on
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s football team, Ian Banwell
is no longer tempted to shout
scrum at the sight of a loose
ball.

The Lexington, Ky., native
could be excused for some in-
itial confusion when he entered
W&L as a freshman in 1981.
After all, it had been two years
since Banwell had seen a for-
ward pass, let alone catch one.

After playing tight end during
his sophomore year at Henry
Clay High School, Banwell had
dropped out of football and
taken up rugby.

“It was a -combination of
things,’’ said Banwell.

“On the one hand I’d lost in-
terest in football and had been a
bit confused about what I
wanted to do. But on the other
hand I knew that my father was
going to be working in England
during my senior year in high
school, so I thought I’d be able
to give rugby a try over there.”

So Banwell joined up with the
Blackstone club team in Lex-
ington and learned the in-
tricacies of the game. The
following year he was off to
England where he became a
rugby player of some note,
earning All-Eastern Counties
honors, the rough equivalent of
all-state in the U.S., in 19-and-
under rugby.

“My American football in-
stincts stood me in good stead
over there,” says Banwell
‘Rugby is quite a finesse game
in England. But I had a very ag-
gressive style of play, a more
physical style.”

When he came back to the
states, Banwell decided it was

time to switch back to the
American version of the sport
and asked W&L head coach
Gary Fallon for a tryout.

“We didn’t exactly recruit
him off the rugby field,” says
Fallon. ‘‘We didn’t have any
films of him to watch. And if I’d
seen films of him playing
rugby, I’m not sure I’d have
known what to look for.’’

But Banwell got his trial and
wound up playing quite a bit
during his freshman year when
starting tight end Mike Fogarty
was injured. Last year Banwell
suffered an early hamstring in-
jury, so his playing time was
limited. And this year he is
sharing the tight end spot with
sophomore Rob Brown.

“It took me a while to get
back into football when I first
started,’ says Banwell. “For
instance, I hadn’t worn pads
since my sophomore year in
high school, so thaf was an ad-
justment. And the skills in the
two sports are a bit different.

“In order to be a great rugby
player you have to be absolutely
nuts. I know because I played
with some great ones, and they
were absolutely nuts,’ says
Banwell.

Fallon is certainly happy that
Banwell switched.

“T only know what I’ve heard
about rugby — that you have to
love contact to play it,” says
Fallon. ‘‘Ian must have been a
pretty darn good rugby player
because he loves to block.”

Rumors to the contrary,
Fallon does not plan to start
recruiting the Eastern Counties
of England for tight ends.

‘‘We’ll stick to the States,” he
says. “For now.”

Generals win three

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

Angus McBryde, who finished
under 26 minutes, paced the
Washington & Lee harriers to a
victory in last Saturday’s
quadrangular meet in Bridge-
water. “That was Angus’ best
time of the season, but it came
on a very fast course,’’ Coach
Dick Miller said.

The Generals score was also
aided by fine performances
from Frank Pittman, Eddie
Goundry, Paul Chapman, Ted
Myers, and Mark Pembroke,
who finished second, third,
fifth, sixth, and seventh respec-
tively. Only a fourth-place
finisher contained the Generals
from achieving a shut out in a

quadrangular meet which
Coach Miller points out, ‘That
is something very hard to do.”’
The competing teams were
W&L, West Virginia Tech,
Newport News Apprentice
School, and host Bridgewater.

This week the Generals are
looking for three more wins in-
this week’s quadrangular meet
at home. Featured in the meet
will be Eastern Mennonite,
Lynchburg College, and
Hampden-Sydney ~- College.
Coach Miller commented that
this week’s meet is very impor-
tant. ‘We have to keep our
momentum with us going into
the ODAC Championships.”
The ODAC meet will be held on
Nov. 5.

Soccer stops H-SC,
ups mark to 6-4

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team played over half of
Saturday’s home game against
Hampden-Sydney without head
coach Rolf Piranian, but still
the Generals came away with a
3-1 victory over their ODAC
rivals.

The Generals built a 2-0 lead
early in the game before Piran-
ian was shown first a yellow
caution card for alledgedly
stepping onto the field while
protesting one of the referee’s
calls, and then a red ejection
card for protesting the first
card. Piranian said of the
referee, who also gave yellow
cards to General midfielder
mark Sullivan and the Hamp-
den-Sydney coach, “I didn’t
think he did the world’s greatest
job. Fortunately, it didn’t mat-
ter that much.”

Senior co-captain Roland
Simon opened the scoring with
his sixth goal of the season.
(Simon scored last week’s goal
against Lynchburg, not Bill
Homes, as was_ incorrectly

reported.) Junior midfielder
Jeff Reichert notched his third
goal of the season to give W&La
2-0 lead.

Colonel David Fowler, in his
second season as_ assistant
coach, took over at the helm
after Piranian’s first-ever ejec-
tion as W&L head coach.
“Coach Piranian has a game
plan set up before every game,”
explained Col. Fowler, ‘‘and I
just followed his game plan.”’

Five minutes into the second
half Holmes’ long throw-in
found sophomore midfielder
Keith Scott, who sent home his
first goal of the season for a 3-0
lead.

W&L outshot the Tigers, 29-8,
and held them scoreless until a
goal with 28 minutes left kept
goalie Jay Werner from his
fourth shutout of the season.

The Generals, 6-4 overall and
2-2 in conference play, travel to
Washington, D.C., on Saturday
to face Catholic University in
the final ODAC game of the
season. The Generals also visit
Radford University on Tuesday
in the next to last game of the
season.

Richmond loss puts

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team finished second
in the Southern League Tourna-
ment last weekend in Rich-
mond, Va. The Generals won
three games and lost one. They
defeated Hampden-Sydney,
Virginia
University and the University
of North Carolina at Wilm-
ington. The Generals’ loss came
against tournament champion
Richmond.

-Richmond’s victory over
W&L last weekend combined
with their 13-5 early season vic-
tory over the Generals will give
Richmond the number one
seeding at the Southern League
Championships. W&L will be
the tournament’s second seed.

Concerning individual perfor-
mances last weekend, Tim
Rock led the Generals. Rock
scored four of W&L’s eight
goals against Richmond.

On Saturday the Generals will
participate in the Virginia State

Commonwealth

polo at second seed

Championships at Richmond.
In addition to W&L, teams from
Richmond, Hampden-Sydney,
Virginia, Virginia Common-
wealth University and Lynch-
burg College will compete.

Richmond and W&L will be
seeded one and two respectively
in the weekend’s tournament.
They have a bye to the semi-
finals.

A W&L victory over Rich-
mond this weekend will not af-
fect the seedings for the

‘Southern League Champion-

ships. Coach Newcomb
believes, however, that it is im-
portant for W&L to win this
weekend. He said, ‘‘We believe
that the winner this weekend
will have an edge going into the
Southern League Champion-
ships.’ Looking to the
Generals’ future, Coach
Newcomb is confident that
W&L will play well. Newcomb
stated, ‘‘We’re really looking
forward to the Southern League
Championships. We will be
playing well. Our game should
be complete.”’

students. The ideals remain the
same, the people change; and
when they leave, carry the prin-
ciples with them into their lives
and vocations. Where are the
fruits of Messrs. S. & M.’s
labor? Have they struggled to
be an actively positive force at
W&L?

Now let us look at the accused
organizations. As one of the EC,
the “‘& Co.’’, I shall leave to
others to comment on our com-
petency. Although I wonder if I
am the ampersand, the ‘‘C’’ or
the ‘‘o”’ or the dot.

I am the ex officio advisor to
Student Control from the EC,
and I must speak to Student
Control’s defense. Charlie
Alcorn has done a superior job
this year amid very difficult
and unpleasant circumstances.
He personally went to extraor-
dinary efforts to obtain all
possible information in the
Dederick affair. Most of this in-
formation is not, nor should it
be, common knowledge. We all
have Student Control to thank
for the restrained and proper
manner in which they have con-
ducted themselves. Messrs. S.
& M. judge the decision of Stu-
dent Control, without knowing
even on what basis it was made.
The utmost confidence the
university administration has
in the idea of student self
discipline and likewise their
confidence in the opinion of Stu-
dent Control, is evinced by the
Student Affairs Committee ac-
cepting the recommendation of
Student Control in the Dederick
affair. Messrs. S. & M. had a
chance to run for class offices,
and thus be a part of the system
of student government, they
chose not to do so. Student Con-
trol, comprised of class of-
ficers, appears to me to be the
best way viewpoints from the
entire student body can be
heard. Do Messrs. S. & M. pro-
pose a better system?

I would like to add my com-
ments on the Interfraternity
council. As a former IFC Rep.,
at Pennsylvania, I hope my
comments will not be con-
sidered fatally biased. I, con-
cededly, know very little about
the IFC at W&L but if the ac-
cusation of Messrs. S. & M.
—namely, that the IFC has
formed a ‘‘Committee for Self
Improvement”’ is true, then I
know the IFC is on the right
track. The IFC and the entire
fraternity system at W&L must
be allowed themselves to cor-
rect any perceived inade-
quacies in the system, and to

continue to develop an IFC net-
work which is proper for W&L.
Over the past three years, I
have visited several fraternity
parties, been graciously receiv-

‘ed by the hosts, and have yet to

see the ‘‘meat market’’ that
Messrs. S & M. describe. I feel it
is quite ungentlemanly for
Messrs. S&M to imply that the
ladies who do attend fraternity
parties are their intellectual in-
feriors, for I fear that would
place the young ladies in almost
an exclusive class. In short, I
feel the IFC and the Fraternity
System at W&L is one that the
entire University and the Alum-
ni can be proud of. Certainly
there is room for improvement
to the physical plants of some of
the houses, but there is nothing
wrong with the ideals and goals
of the system as it stands. From
what I have seen, Rush at W&L,
in comparison with other Rush

practices I have known, is far
from being an ‘‘obsolete
system’ as described by
Messrs. S. & M. Rush at W&L
appears to me to be well
organized, well carried out, and
ideally suited to the W&L tradi-
tion and the community.

While I am certain Messrs. S.
& M. felt bound to their tenets,
they need not have lashed out in
the fashion they chose. Their
style I find hard to reconcile
with the ideals of either our
benefactor, George Washington
or our beloved president,
Robert E. Lee. For even when
faced with most dire emergen-
cies and seemingly hopeless
situations, be it Valley Forge or
Washington College after the
War, these two great Virginians
by positive constructive efforts
and self sacrificing virtue lead
others forward by their own ex-
ample. The W&L_ tradition,
Messrs. S. & M., is one of action
not one of idle finger pointing.

Ignoring relevant facts

To the editors:

As the battle over coeduca-
tion rages on around him, Mr.
N.P. Whitehead chooses to ig-
nore the relevent facts in his re-
cent letter on coeducation.
There are good traditions and
bad traditions. The thought of
comparing being — single-sex

with slavery is not only
pointless, but serves only to
confuse the issue. Washington

and Lee is more than a tradi-
tion, it’s an institution. W&L
isn’t single sex because it’s a
neat idea. We are single-sex
because that is Washington and
Lee’s identity, it’s what makes

us not just another small col-
lege. W&L is unique. That’s
right, I said unique. How can
Mr. Whitehead claim that W&L,
an all-male university es-
tablished in 1749, with an

historical and beautiful cam-
pus, highly competitive
academics, and a_ working
honor code established by the
great Robert E. Lee, is not uni-
que. The dictionary states that
unique is ‘‘being without like or
equal,’’ and, ‘‘very rare or un-
common.’’ In my opinion we are
without either like or equal.

Mr. Whitehead claims that
“the social atmosphere is total-
ly unnatural.”’ It’s quite plain to
see though, that the entire col-
lege social system is unreal-
istic. The difference with W&L
is that our social system calls

   
 

 

SILILSDI LAS Dd

for imagination and ag-
gressiveness to make the best of
it. Partying at any of the large
coed schools will show you that
the college social scene is un-
natural whether you need to
walk across the street, or drive
45 minutes to get to a party. A
really mature adult should be
able to accept the equality of

women, regardless of how often
we see them.

But, does Washington and Lee
need coeducation? The answer
is that I don’t know. I do know
that the decision must be weigh-
ed with utmost care, because
the life of our university is on
the line. One thing must certain-
ly be kept in mind, though. W&L
is different, not just because we

are an all-male school, but ©

because we’re a good, all-male
school. The object is to find a
happy medium between the
high academics and the unique
all-male environment. If stay-
ing all-male seriously affects
the academic excellence of
W&L (which is so far only
postulated) then there seems to
be little choice than to go coed.
But, if coeducation is an issue
because of the supposed im-
maturity of our social system,
or the lack of women in the
classroom, then there is no
issue, Coeducation may become
necessary, but unlike Mr.
Whitehead, I think it would be a
necessary evil.

News, that the tapes were what
they were ‘“‘purported to be”’
and that the subject was ‘‘news-
worthy.”

Joyce said it was not relevant
to ask why Mr. Flynt or his
source wanted the tapes broad-
cast, because ‘‘every individual
you deal with has some
motive.”

It was apparent, or should
have been apparent, that the
prosecutor and his staff would

have no motivation for pre-.

mature public disclosure of key
evidence that they expected to
use to prove De Lorean’s par-
ticipation in a drug conspiracy
to raise money for his failing
auto company in Northern Ire-
land.

It should have been equally
apparent to CBS officials at
every level that the major
beneficiary of the premature
disclosure of the De Lorean
tapes would be De Lorean and
other defendants involved in the
drug conspiracy trial. CBS of-
ficials were warned that the
defendants and their lawyers
would use the improper dis-
closure of key evidence to ask
for delays, to demand dismissal
of all charges, and to create
general confusion in a prosecu-
tion that would be difficult
enough at best.

Is the people’s right to know
about the De Lorean tapes on
Oct. 23, 1983, paramount to the
rights of the government and
the defendants and the court to
have those tapes kept secret un-
til they are admitted in evi-
dence at the trial or at least un-
til after a jury has been
selected?

CBS executives answered the
question by deciding they were
“newsworthy” and above all
‘good television” and that the
rights of the government to a
fair trial and the Sixth Amend-
ment rights of John Z. De

Lorean could be sacrificed. The
fact that delays or moving the
trial might cost millions to the
government and _ defendants
was not relevant when CBS
decided the De Lorean tapes
were ‘‘newsworthy.”’

Nor was it important to CBS
executives as to whether there
was a miscarriage of justice
either through a dismissal of
the charges or the conduct of a
trial under a procedural cloud
— a cloud that will not be
removed until De Lorean has
exhausted all of his appeals.

CBS had a constitutional right
under the First Amendment to
be wrong, to cause confusion in
the administration of justice in
a major drug trafficking case,
and it exercised that right in
continued broadcast from
KNXT-TV in Los Angeles.

However, the excesses are so
great and the lack of respon-
sibility so glaring that it is cer-
tain to bring forth arguments
that such abuses of power can-
not be permitted, and that the
government or the courts must
establish some more effective
restrictions on the operations of
the free press.

In engaging in actions that
present press critics with such
strong arguments, CBS has
done a disservice to the long-
time cause of a free press. The
airing of the De Lorean tapes by
CBS will be a subject for Free
Press-Fair Trial forums for
years to come, and the press
will be fortunate indeed if it
does not become exhibit
number one in a court case that
strips the press of some of its
vital freedom under the First
Amendment.

Republican cites
deceptive resolution

To the Editors:

Appearing in last week’s
Ring-tum Phi (Oct. 20, 1983)
was a resolution paid for the
W&L College Republicans. The
resolution strongly urged the
Board of Trustees to reject all
attempts at coeducation on
behalf of the College Repub-
licans which the resolution cor-
rectly identified as ‘‘the largest
student group at Washington
and Lee.’’ At the bottom of this
ad appeared the fact that this
resolution had been passed
unanimously by the Executive
Board of the Republicans,
which was within its rights as
stated in the Republican’s by-
laws. However, here within this
fact lies the deception of the
public.

For this mighty resolution ex-
presses the opinion of those nine

executive board members —not
of every member of the College
Republicans! This resolution
was never voted upon by the en-
tire membership or even
discussed in a general monthly
meeting. It in no way expresses
the view of every College
Republican on the issue of
coeducation as suggested in the
resolutron.

As a faithful, dues-paying
member of the College Repub-
licans who is seriously consider-
ing the issue of coeducation in
my mind and who feels such a
hasty response is not conducive
to the future of W&L, I find it
difficult to have these nine
students appear as if speaking
for me. They do not in any way.
Let not the W&L community be
deceived.
