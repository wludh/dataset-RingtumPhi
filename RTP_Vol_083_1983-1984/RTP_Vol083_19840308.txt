Open exam proposal
rejected by faculty

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The faculty rejected the open
exam proposal 43-42 at its Mon-
day meeting, overturning previ-
Ous approvals by the student
and faculty executive commit-
tees.

The proposal would have al-
lowed students to turn in exam
envelopes without specifying
the date or time they wished to
take the exam. Students then
could take the exam during any
period.

The proposal was amended
several times and debated for
over 45 minutes before being re-
jected, according to William
Watt, dean of the college. ‘‘It
demanded an_ inordinate
amount of time,” he said.

The faculty’s main reason for
rejecting the proposal, Watt
said, was that it was not clear
enough when exam envelopes
would be due. ‘“‘The major con-
cern was it did not seem to re-
quire students to turn [envel-
opes} in at any particular
time.”

Other faculty members op-
posed the increased freedom
the measure would have given
students, Watt said. ‘‘Some

think the students should have
to make a schedule and stick to
it.”

“I’m disappointed because I
think it would have been bene-
ficial for both the students and
faculty,’’ said Cole Dawson, the
student EC member who head-
ed the open exam committee.

Dawson said the proposal
might be considered again next
year, but ‘‘for this year it is
pretty much a dead issue.’

Whether open exams are con-
sidered next year, Dawson said,
would depend on what the facul-
tv’s final vote was. If the vote
was close it might be rein-
troduced.

“They were afraid to
change,’ Dawson said. ‘‘No-
body knows how it would work
out. I think it would have work-
ed.”

Many faculty members have
grown used to the existing
system and have their routines
‘down like clockwork,’’ he said,
making them hesitant to
change.

Dawson said if the faculty
was worried about how the
system would work, it should
have been implemented on a
trial basis

Howard resigns from EC

Secretary cites distrust, disrespect in committee

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

Student Body Secretary Len Howard resigned
at Monday night’s Executive Committee
meeting, citing excessive personal sacrifice and
an ‘‘atmosphere of distrust ... and disrespect’’ in
the EC.

Senior representative Jim Messer (who
received more votes than George Youmans, the
other Senior representative when he was
elected) took over the vacated position and
Senior Class President Charlie Alcorn assumed
the duties of senior representative.

“It’s been coming for a long, long time, and
finally what it’s boiled down to is the fact that the
academic and personal sacrifices that I had to
make to be a member of the committee were no
longer balanced by my input to the committee,”’
Howard said in an interview Monday.

“T just don’t think I'm doing anybody any
good.”’

EC President Bob Jenevein called the resigna-
tion ‘‘a complete shock to the entire committee. ”’

‘‘With all the pressure Len has been under this
year, as secretary of a highly criticized Ex
ecutive Committee, we support him and his deci
sion to remove himself. His resignation will not
prevent this committee from striving to repre
sent the students as well as possible in the next
few months,”’ Jenevein said Tuesday, reading
from a statement. .

Jenevein said he did not think it was ap-
propriate to respond to Howard’s comment that
described the committee’s atmosphere as one of
distrust and disrespect.

“It’s a highly personality-oriented issue,
Jenevein said.

Howard admits he had difficulty with the job

‘I have had some problems with the job [
don’t deny that at all — but I can’t accept full
responsibility for everything that goes wrong,”
he said.

Review and Outlook

Constitutional flaws

The resignation Monday of the student body
secretary has pointed out weaknesses in the student
government constitution stemming from its vague-
ness and ambiguity. Len Howard’s decision to leave
the Executive Committee caused confusion over the
proper procedure of succession which was finally set-
tled with the application of an elastic clause of the
consitution which permits the EC and its president to
do whatever it deems is ‘‘in the best interest of the
student body.”’

An event as major as the resignation of an Ex-
ecutive Committee officer would seem to be of such
magnitude and likelihood that it would be covered in
the constitution. But according to the new EC
parliamentarian, neither of the constitutional clauses
which approached applicability in this case were ex-
actly correct.

So the EC enacted a clause which enables it to do
almost anything it decides is proper.

We are disturbed by the problems that have been
pointed out by this episode. First, the procedure for
such a succession is not clearly addressed in the stu-
dent body constitution. And second, a clause exists
that permits an EC and its president to pass whatever
proposition it considers is best for the student body.

We do not mean to infer that this particular applica-
tion of the clause was incorrect. It may well have sav-
ed the EC and the University many complications in a
year which has already been engulfed in problems.

What we do mean to call attention to is the constitu-
tion and its spotty inadequacy. EC parliamentarian
Jim Green says the consitution is ‘‘fossilized.’’ But
with such glaring shortfalls and potentially volatile
clauses as we have discovered this week, it has be-
come vital to consider cleaning up the student body
constitution.

A consitutional ammendment requires a voted ap-
proval from two-thirds of one-half of the student body.
That alone is a major task. But, as with the White
Book, an appointed student committee aimed at ex-
amining the consitution for possible revision might be
a more practical route.

Candidates unfamiliar to students

To the Editors:

After taking part in Monday’s
“Big Three”’ elections, I began
to seriously consider just how
uninformed I had been about
each of the candidates. I realize
that some of the fault, of course,
was my own, but I believe some
of my problem was due to the
election system itself. Since we
are currently looking at the EC
and trying to determine its ex-
act role here at W&L, I think it
is paramount that we look at the
process we use to elect our EC
officers.

I think we all know that the
candidates participated in a
forum last week, a forum de-
signed to give each candidate a
chance to express his views of
the election. How many of us ac-
tually attended the forum,
though? How many of us could
honestly say we knew each of
the candidates? More impor-
tantly, how many of us knew ex-
actly what the candidates stood
for?

Certainly we saw these guys
around campus, talked to them
in class, and read about them in
the Phi. I’m just not sure that

these methods were the best
ways to judge who should be the
next EC officers. Shouldn’t
there have been more time to
campaign head-to-head? And
why were the elections put on
the Monday after Fancy Dress?
All these questions have stuck
with me since the election, and I
have a feeling I’m not the only
one asking them.

My hope is that, particularly

now — when we are looking at
the EC as a representative body
— the election procedure will
help rather than hinder the
EC’s ability to represent stu-
dent views. I certainly hope the
upcoming representative elec-
tions will be run with represen-
tation in mind.

Oxford program open

To the Editors:

I would like to draw attention
to the Virginia Program at Ox-
ford, which is a summer school
course sponsored by Washing-
ton and Lee and five other
neighboring schools. It is a uni-
que opportunity to study under
the English tutorial system at
St. Anne’s College, University
of Oxford, England. The subject
is English literature and history
of the 16th and 17th centuries,
and six semester hours are

awarded for it.

Don’t abuse our hospitahty

To the Editors:

Phi Kappa Psi does not carry
out a policy of begrudging any-
one entrance into our ‘‘sociai
events.’’ On the contrary, we
welcome almost everyone to en-
joy our ‘‘beverages,”’ bands,
and if applicable, company.
Last Saturday evening (March
3), the band “‘Steps’’ played for
our annual Fancy Dress party.
Upon the band’s completion of
their song list, a piece of their
equipment was picked up. The
piece, a light mixer, was not
discovered to be missing until
packing-up had begun. This
piece of equipment is useless to
anyone who does not have a
sophisticated light system. If
this is a fraternity prank or an

individual stab at humor, we
will consider it such, and the

piece of equipment may be .

returned with no questions ask-
ed. This is the first such inci-
dent we have encountered here
at Phi Psi. We hope that we will
not have to change our ‘‘open
arms’’ policy because of
thieves. Few, if any other
houses, had such a liberal
policy toward their Fancy
Dress festivities, and we wish to
stay as we are. I may be reach-
ed at 463-6909 and the house
number is 463-2003.
We would appreciate your
cooperation.
John B. Lewis

President of Phi Kappa Psi -

We have fewer applicants this
year than in the past and ! am
concerned that not all W&L
students may have heard of the
program. In addition, for the
first time we are able to offer a
scholarship this year (on a com-
petitive basis to those with
demonstrated need).

The total cost of the program
is $1,800, and the dates are July
2 to Aug. 10. Applications were
due by March 1, but I can ex-
tend that deadline to March 15.
Any interested students should
come to see me as soon as possi-
ble.

Although 12 area lawyers last
week called into question the
purpose and intent of the con-
troversial panel investigating
local drug trafficking, the af-
fidavit specifying prosecutor
Beverly C. “John” Read’s
reasons for requesting the
special grand jury is sealed by
court order and unavailable to
lawyers or the public.

In an unusual action, the at-
torneys formally requested that
a discussion of the special
grand jury be placed on the
agenda for Monday’s meeting
of the local bar association.

Circuit Court Judge George
E. Honts III impaneled the in-
vestigative body four months
ago after reviewing the af-
fidavit from Commonwealth’s
Attorney Read.

“There was enough in that
document to convince me that
the special grand jury was war-
ranted,” Judge Honts said.

“‘We’ve closed that just as
we've closed the transcript of
the proceedings,” he continued.
“Nothing regarding the work of
the special grand jury will be
made public until it issues its
recommendations.”’

“There may be confidential
material in there,” he said.

The judge refused to further
characterize the document, ex-
cept to say that it was ‘‘fairly
short.”

In the one-page motion which
was submitted with the detailed
proposal, Read requested that
the “affidavit be sealed pur-
suant to” two Code of Virginia
sections which make no refer-
ence to the closing of court
documents filed before the
special grand jury is convened.

One of the cited statutes deals
with the secrecy requirements
imposed on grand jurors; the
other concerns the transcript of

by Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton and Rockbridge County
Sheriff S.M. Reynolds, both of
whom signed the motion.

“I signed the petition because
I felt the grand jury was need-
ed,’’ Sutton said. ‘‘I didn’t even
have toread the documents.

“‘My experience and the infor-
mation I had at the time told me
such an investigation could be
very informative.”

Reynolds said he thought that
Read was ‘‘doing a job that has
to be done,’’ and the sheriff said
that he did not need the evi-
dence submitted by the pro-
secutor to decide to lend his sup-
port to the investigation.

“If it’s an extraordinary doc-
ument, then it should be seal-
ed,’’ said -defense attorney
Larry Mann. “Tf it’s not, then

there’s no reason to close it.”’

“I have to defer to the judge
on that. It may be that it has
something so sensitive in it that
this is justified.’

Mann is one of a dozen law-
yers who last Thursday asked
Rockbridge-Buena Vista Bar
Association president J. Todd
Jones to schedule‘a discussion
of the ‘“‘manner and scope of the
special grand jury investiga-
tion’’ for Monday’s meeting.

“I think anytime you have a
group requesting that this sort
of discussion be held, they’re
obviously disturbed about
what’s happening,”’ Jones said.
“It’s obviously a highly charged
issue.”’

“In my memory, I don’t
believe an issue like this has
come up while I’ve been a
member of this bar associa-
tion,’’ he said.

“I’ve been a member of the
bar for 34 years, and I have
never known anything like this
to occur before,’’ said Bernard
J. Natkin, who said he was not
one of the attorneys who con-
tacted Jones.

The Monday luncheon meet-

the Buena Vista Motel &
Restaurant.

Several attorneys confirmed
that Read generally attends bar
association meetings.

Read has said that he will not
comment on any aspect of the
special grand jury investigation
or local reaction toit.

“Our meetings are generally
rather informal,’ Jones said.
“This element adds an air of
formality toit.”’

Attorneys question tactics of drug grand jury

He said that no action will
necessarily be taken. Following
discussion of the situation, the
bar could vote to form a com-
mittee to investigate the mat-
ter, pass a resolution, or refer
the case to a state bar associa-
tion ethics committee, among
other options.

“I would imagine that any
number of actions could come
out of it,” Jones said. “There
are no particular guidelines.

The bar can generally do what-
ever the bar wants to do. It’s
hard to speculate on what might
happen.”

Jones said that the agenda re-
quest grew out of a meeting of
the 12 attorneys last Thursday.
He said he attended the meet-
ing, but would not identify any
of the other participants.

“It was not an official bar
meeting,’ he said. “It was a

Closed party decision put off

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

A proposal prohibiting non-
fraternity members from at-
tending fraternity parties at
Washington and Lee University
without an invitation was tabled
by the Inter-Fraternity Council,

which in turn appointed a com-

mittee to further study the
issue.

The meeting was the first to
be run by new IFC President
David Perdue, a Sigma Alpha
Epsilon senior, and Vice Presi-
dent Jim Cobb, a Phi Kappa
Sigma senior.

Perdue made the motion to
form the committee to study the
closed-party issue after extend-
ed discussion. Gary Duncan,
the newly-elected senior jus-
tice, was appointed by Perdue
to head the committee. Perdue
suggested the committee vote
on the proposal in about two
weeks.

Several other people present
at the meeting also let their
views be heard about a closed-
party policy,

One of the most vocal voices
present was that of Richard
Kopelman, who had several
suggestions to offset some of the
recent problems fraternities
are facing. Kopelman, an in-

fraternity parties be charged a
“fair” fee at the beginning of
the school year.

In regard to the over-crowded
parties, Kopelman suggested
that the size of the parties could
be limited, with independents
being the first ones asked to
leave when overcrowding oc-
curred. Kopelman added that
he didn’t think the closed party
policy would solve the problems
fraternities are experiencing.

“Better selections can be
made,” he said.

The general complaint among
the fraternities concerning the
current open-party policy in-
volves an added financial

burden and the current over-
crowding of parties.

“We need to address this pro-
blem,”’ former IFC President
Emery Ellinger said.

Dean of Fraternity Affairs
Dan Murphy said, ‘fraternities
have a right and an obligation to
control the size of parties.” He
suggested that the independents
might invest their money into
the Independent Union.

In addition, the IFC Judicial
Board fined Phi Delta Theta
$150 and issued the fraternity a
severe warning after an inci-
dent last Saturday involving
Sigma Nu and a black powder
charge.

Corrections

The Ring-tum Phi incorrectly
reported last week that the In-
terfraternity Council observed
a rule permitting only two clos-

ed fraternity parties per year.
This is not observed as a rule,
but as a tradition.

Jewish studies professor named

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

After a one-and-a-half year
search, Washington and Lee
University has hired a Pro-
fessor of Jewish Studies. Begin-
ning with the fall term of 1984,
he will be responsible for
teaching courses in Judaism
and work as a counselor of
Jewish students. ©

Appointed to the position is
Richard G. Marks, who receiv-
ed a Ph.D. in Jewish History
from the University of Califor-
nia at Los Angeles. Marks has
been serving as a visiting pro-
fessor at Mahidol University in
Thailand since 1979 and was a
lecturer at Hebrew Union Col-
lege in Los Angeles from 1972 to
1977. He received his master’s
degree from Hebrew Union in
1971 and is a 1967 graduate of
Raymond College, where he re-
ceived a bachelor’s degree in
liberal arts.

Professor David W. Sprunt,
head of W&L’s religion depart-
ment, cites two reasons for
creating the new position. The
first is a current lack of cur-
riculum offerings in Judaism
studies and the second is the
need for a Jewish faculty
member to work with Jewish
students. The search for a per-
son to fulfill these needs began
in the fall of 1982. _

“Two people were offered it
{the job], but they declined it
primarily...because of a lack of
a Jewish community,” said
Sprunt, who said he was looking
for someone with both a
scholarly background and a
commitment to Jewish tradi-
tions. This causes ‘‘a built-in
problem,’’ considering the
Jewish community in Lex-
ington, Sprunt said.

“Marks met those two re-
quirements better than anyone
else we had,” said Sprunt,
citing Marks’ scholarly and

rabbinical training and his com-
mitment to tradition. ‘‘He has a
genuine interest in working
with the students,’’ Sprunt said.

The courses Marks will teach
were approved by the faculty
earlier this winter, before
Marks was hired. He will be
teaching classes in the Old
Testament in the fall and
winter, Introduction to Judaism
in the fall, Contemporary
Jewish Thought in the winter
and a spring seminar. Along
with Professor Harlan R.
Beckley and members of the
other departments, he will be
teaching a course in approaches
to the study of various religions,
which Sprunt considers ‘‘one of
the most interesting courses
around here.”’

While two members of the
Board of Trustees, S L Kopald
Jr. and Frances Lewis, are
Jewish, it was the faculty that
brought the idea to the Board,
which gave encouragement. “‘It
(was) not a matter of the
Trustees insisting on it,’’ Sprunt
said.

Marks has also studied at
Hebrew University Ulpan, and
was elected into Phi Kappa Phi,
the national undergraduate
honor fraternity in 1966. He is a
member of both the American
Academy of Religion and the
Association for Jewish Studies
and is the author of two articles
in scholarly publications.

Three W&L staffers in city council election

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Three members of the W&L
community — Dr. Charles F.
Phillips Jr., Dr. Thomas C.
Imeson and Sue LaRue — have
announced during the last few
weeks that they will seek re-
election to their positions in
Lexington city government.

Clerk of Court Bruce Patter-
son said that no one other than
the incumbents has asked for
petitions to enter the at-large

‘race for City Council seats.

Phillips, who is in his 13th
year as mayor of Lexington,
will seek a fourth term in the
May 1 election. Imeson will
seek his fourth term as a
member of City Council and
Mrs. LaRue will seek her sec-
ond term.

Phillips, an economics pro-
fessor at W&L said that part of

the reason he decided to run |

for the mayor’s office again
was that no one else in the
community expressed any in-
terest in the job. .

“I waited to see if someone
would express an interest, and
no one else did. I wouldn’t be
surprised if someone decided
to run in the last couple of
days,’’ said Phillips.

Unfinished business before
the city council dealing with
such issues as annexation, the
schools,
downtown area also helped
convince Phillips to run again.

Phillips said that annexation
is probably the most important
issue before City Council at

present. Lexington is attempt-

ing to annex 6.8 square miles
of land from Rockbridge Coun-
ty.

“It is not a pleasant ex-
perience for anyone who has to
go through it. But it is the only
way that cities in Virginia can
expand,’’ Phillips said
concerning annexation.

Phillips said that he has gotten
mixed reactions from Lex-
ington residents on annexation
and generally negative reac-
tions from people in the pro-
posed annexed area. However,
Phillips said that some people
in the annexed area have cited
positive aspects of annexation.

“Annexation probably had
an impact on the number of
people running,’’ Phillips said
regarding the lack of opposi-
tion to the incumbents.

He said that he is not sur-
prised by the fact that three
members of the W&L com-
munity are running for city-
wide office. Having lived in
Lexington since 1959, Phillips
said that members of the W&L
community have always
played important roles in the
city’s public affairs.

“These two schools play an
important part in this com-
munity. They are our in-
dustry,’”’said Phillips.

Mrs. LaRue (manager of the
W&L bookstore) cited her con-
cern over annexation, educa-
tion and other issues as the
major reasons she decided to
seek a second term on City
Council.

“It’s really an exciting time
to be on City Council. We’re
right in the middle of some im-
portant projects,’’ Mrs. LaRue
said.

Mrs. LaRue said that she
hopes the city’s problem of a
limited tax base, which promp-
ted the annexation move, can
be resolved inexpensively for
everyone.

“I’m particularly concerned
with keeping the cost as low as

possible. We have a fair suit

compared to other cities who
have won annexations. Our
suit is very reasonable,’ Mrs.
LaRue said.

Mrs. LaRue also said she
thought that the annexation
fight has discouraged some
people from running for City

Council so far this year.

“I wish someone else would
run. I would like to see more
ideas expressed. The thought
that there isn’t anyone out
there to take over is discourag-
ing,”’ remarked Mrs. LaRue.

Mrs. LaRue said she is will-
ing to discuss the city or the
issues with any member of the
W&L community.

Imeson, a chemistry pro-
fessor, also mentioned the
desire to see the annexation
issue resolved as the main
reason he chose to run for a
fourth term on City Council.

“It certainly ranks among

who wanted to express their
concern on the same general
subject.”

“It’s not the special grand
jury per se that concerns the

lawyers,’’ Mann said. “It’s the »

manner in which the investiga-

tion is being conducted and the
advice the special grand jury is
getting from John Read.”’

“I think the grand jurors are
doing their job,” he continued.
“I have no qualms about the
value of the investigation. My

disagreement is purely a func-
tion of the actions of John Read.
That’s the issue that the bar is
concerned with.”’

Attorney Thomas C. Spencer
said that he was also among
those expressing displeasure
with Read’s operation of the
special grand jury.

“The way he’s doing it is

wrong regardless of how effec-

_ tive the investigation is,’’ he

said. ‘‘It seems to me irrelevant
if the special grand jury is ‘suc-
cessful.’

the most important issues,”
Imeson said, comparing an-
nexation to other issues he has
faced in 13 years on City Coun-
cil. ‘There have been other
issues which at the time were
as large.”’

Imeson said most of the peo-
ple he has talked to ‘have
adopted a wait-and-see at-
titude’’ toward the proposed
annexation.

Imeson said that running for
City Council is a low-key situa-
tion because people keep per-
sonalities and party affiliations
out of the race and concentrate
on issues. There is little cam-

paigning in a ‘‘classic sense,”
remarked Imeson.

Imeson said he thinks it is
fairly common for people

associated with colleges and
universities to play a major
role in the civic affairs of a ci-
ty. College people in Blacks-
burg, Williamsburg, Staunton
and Charlottesville play impor-
tant roles in local government,
asserted Imeson.

‘TI don’t feel that where one
finds his employment neces-
sarily indicates that he or she
represents one group com-
pared to another,” he said.

 

“If the public perceives that
he’s being successful, how
much more are they going to ac-
cept tactics like this in the next
investigation?”’

“T really don’t think that
young high school kids ought to

thing about it.”

Spencer said that once when
he was accompanying a client
to a special grand jury session,
Read told him before the hear-

ing to ‘‘leok out, because I’m
trying to set your client up for
perjury.”

He also said that Read has
‘misrepresented facts and the

law”’ to witnesses.

Specifically, Spencer said
Read has been telling witnesses
that they cannot discuss their
testimony, when in fact that is
not prohibited by the Code of
Virginia.

He also said that the scope of

the investigation is too broad,
and that witnesses are being
made victims of ‘‘guilt by
association.”

“TI don’t think he should be
calling in whole classes of peo-
ple,”’ Spencer said. ‘‘You don’t
issue a big widespread
dragnet.’’

“Read is ignoring his profes-
sional responsibilities,”’ he add-

said that ‘‘in no way

it be construed that
mereiy because the question
has been raised, something has
necessarily been done that’s
wrong.”

“For the bar to investigate
one of its own is common-
place,” he continued. ‘‘The
worst part of these things is that
when you’re accused, then
you’re immediately guilty in
the eyes of the public.”

“These people are making
suppositions and innuendoes
about something they don’t
have the information to
evaluate and make a decision,”’
Chief Sutton said.

“T think they’re doing more
harm than good, and they call
themselves officers of the
court.”’

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce
D. Patterson said that when
Read was out of town on March
1, the special grand jury met
without the Commonwealth’s
Attorney for the first time.

‘Nine’ splits with Newport

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team got off to a good
start for the 1984 season by
splitting a doubleheader with
Christopher Newport College at
William and Mary College last
weekend.

In the first game, the Gener-
erals won 4-3 in extra innings
thanks to a strong pitching per-
formance by junior righthander
Billy White and freshman third
baseman Milam Turner’s
game-winning RBI in the ninth
inning.

White pitched a complete
game, striking out five and giv-
ing up only one earned run in
nine innings.

In the nightcap the Generals
fell 7-6 as Christopher Newport
scored twice in the bottom of
the seventh inning for the win.
Sophomore Kirk Breen went the
distance for the Generals in that
game. “i

Senior shortstop Dave War-
renfeltz provided most of the
Generals’ offense Sunday, col-
lecting two hits and five RBIs.

“‘T was very pleased with our
defense, both in the outfield and
the infield,” Murdock said. ‘We
made the routine plays and had
some outstanding individual
plays.

“Our pitching was very ade-
quate. White was outstanding
and Breen had his first com-

catcher Mike Jacoby did a

Murdock said.

Of his team’s hitting, Mur-

the plate was lacking with men
on base. We could have scored
more runs early and late in that
game, but we were a little
Overanxious.”’

The Generals host Division I

Murdock said that the Gener-
als have played well in earlier
scrimmages against the
Keydets.

Radford’s end of the field. The
Generals were unable to con-
vert any of the chances into a
try, the equivalent of a touch-
down in football.

Netters fall to PSU,
down Slippery Rock

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team opened its 1984 sche-
dule last weekend with a loss to
Division I Penn State but follow-
ed up with a victory against
Division II Slippery Rock.

Against Penn State the Gen-
erals were unable to post a
single match win and suffered a
9-0 loss. However, captain Craig
Cannon extended his opponent
to a second set tie breaker, and
number six sophomore Randy
Johns went three sets before
losing.

W&L head tennis coach Gary
Franke said, “They (Penn
State) had been playing indoors
for six weeks. I think that was a
big difference.” Franke added,
“I don’t think anybody played
poorly. Basically, I think we got
beat by a better team.”’

Following the Penn State loss
on Friday, the Generals re-
bounded on Saturday with a vic-
tory against Slippery Rock.
W&L won four of the six singles
matches and also posted vic-
tories in two of the three
doubles contests.

The Generals’ performance
in both matches gave Franke an
idea of his teams’ weaknesses.
Coach Franke believes that his
team needs to become more
consistent in all areas.

Franke also recognizes pro-
blems with his doubles teams.
Although Coach Franke be-
lieves that his number one
doubles team of Craig Cannon
and Roby Mize is playing well,
he is looking at many possibili-
ties as to who will play together
and at what position in the re-
mainder of the doubles line-up.

On Monday bad weather forc-
ed the Generals to cancel a
match with Division HI
powerhouse Rochester. The
teams are not likely to
reschedule the match _ this
season due to tight scheduling
by both programs.

The Generals will play Lehigh
on Monday, at 3 p.m. and then

some mistakes.’’ Daly’s main
concern was that the Generals
did not work together for most
of the first half after they built a
3-0 lead in the opening two and a
half minutes.

Lee Heimert had a hand in all
three of those goals, scoring two
and assisting for Caulley Der-
inger with a crisp pass from
behind the Tech goal. By the
time Heimert earned his fourth
and final assist of the day (on
Kevin Walakovits’ fourth goal
in the third quarter), W&L led,
11-0.

Daly was especially pleased
with Heimert’s- passing, after
the senior went without an
assist while scoring nine goals
last year. ‘‘He showed that he
can be more than a dodger,”
Daly said.

Sophomore Bill Holmes
matched Walakovits’ goal tally
with three in the third quarter,
when W&L connected 11 times
against Tech goalie Dave
Lacast, and one in the fourth.
For the game W&L outshot the
Hokies 81-23.

Time Out...

The Generals were able to
dominate possession of the ball
in large part because of the
work of Rich Schoenberg, who
won all but four of the 25
faceoffs. ‘He showed some ver-
satile moves,” Daly said of
Schoenberg’s performance.

On the few occasions the
Hokies got across midfield, the
best they could manage were
routine shots on Phil Aiken, who
recorded 13 saves.

Tech’s best chances to get on
the board came in the second
quarter. Hokie Defenseman
Doug Politi scooped up a loose
ball at the crease of the W&L
goal and had only Aiken to beat
but was thwarted by the pipe.

Later, with Aiken caught out
of the crease on a failed attempt
to clear, W&L’s Barry Water-
man preserved the shutout by
hitting Ken Dyke’s stick as
Dyke was winding up to shoot at
the empty goal. Waterman
eventually ended the scoring in

dodges through the defense.

In his letter of resignation,
Howard said, ‘‘I have been forc-
ed to work in an atmosphere of
distrust for my abilities and
disrespect for my opinions. I
have been forced to com-
promise my personal convic-
tions for the sake of a ‘united

frustrated with my inability to
express what I deem to be valid

that my contributions to the

decreased, both in the impor-
tance given them and in their
general reception.”

Howard’s_ resignation also
caused some confusion as to
who would replace Jim Messer

Senior law _ representative
Jim Green, appointed parlia-

meeting Tuesday night, called
the constitution a ‘‘very fossil-

According to Green, the
senior law representative has
traditionally acted as a
parliamentarian in keeping the
committee abreast of matters
of constitution and order.

“‘What we are doing in seating
Charlie Alcorn is 100 percent
within the spirit of the student
constitution,”’ he said.

“Our intent was allowing stu-
dent government to continue,”’
he said. Section V, Part F, in the
constitution provides for the
replacement of “student body
officers and all positions of
honor’’ through a special elec-
tion.

“I do not specifically see ‘all

hand provides for the Senior
Class President to take over the
duties of the senior class
representative should that
representative leave ‘‘the
University during the six-week
term.”

“It was our collective best
judgment that this was the pro-
per procedure to follow at this
time. I find that (Section V,
Part F) is not directly respon-
sive and I agree that (Section V,
Part I) is not directly respon-
sive,” Green said.

“‘We are following the plan of
Part I with the authority of Sec-
tion III Part A Number 4,” he
said.

Section III, Part A, Number 4
provides for the President to
“do anything necessary to pro-
mote the best interests of the
Student Body,” provided the
rest of the committee approves.

At the Tuesday night meet-
ing, the committee voted unani-
mously to empower Jenevein to
follow the plan set up in Part I,
whereby Alcorn takes Messer’s
position.

“This constitution does not
speak unequivocally to this un-
fortunate situation. The word-
ing is open to interpretation,”
he said.

Time out-———

(continued from page 7)
continue its present course, if it
is to survive. It is certainly a
sad commentary on the world of
pro sports when, as things have
become, the game is an after-
thought to the paycheck...

...Running down the front
lawn, one can’t help noticing a
23-4) score. When one realizes
the score goes with a lacrosse
match and not a football game,
a doubletake is necessary. It
seems Sunday’s Hokie contest
may have been a case of the
Generals being that good and
Tech being that bad. Confidence
level was probably helped, and
it can’t seriously damage Satur-
day’s home contest against
Navy. Weekend forecast from
here; If W&L is as quick as it
looked, Coach Daly’s attacking
offense will be quite viable
Saturday. A win here would be a
major step in the right direction
toward this team’s tournament
hopes...

Finally, this produces
some confusion: An agreement
to televise the Summer Games
in 16 Communist-bloc nations
has been signed. Price tag: $3
million. Price tag for ABC’s
American TV rights: $225
million, One wonders if we’ll get
70 times better coverage, too....
