A new survey by the Washington and Lee
sociology department shows that 53 percent of
undergraduates oppose the admission of women,
while over 80 percent of the faculty supports such a

move.

Of the students polled, 34 percent expressed
strong opposition to coeducation, and an additional
19 percent said they were somewhat against it.
Faculty responses showed 66 percent strongly in
favor of the admission of women, with 17 percent
somewhat supportive of that change.

EC to decide if not
reporting is an HV

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Failure to report an honor
violation will be in itself an honor
violation if a proposal by the
White Book Revisions Committee
is approved by the Executive
Committee.

Lee Feldman and Mike Reap,
members of the committee, both
confirmed that the committee
has included the failure to report
clause in its recommendations
for changes in the honor system
to the EC. In order for the pro-
posals to become effective the EC
must approve them twice by a
simple majority.

EC secretary Jim Messer,
chairman of the revisions com-
mittee, said that the White Book,
with all proposed changes includ-
ed, will be presented to the EC
Monday night.

Specifically, the proposed
change would list ‘‘lying,
cheating, stealing or tolerating
those who do’’ as examples of
honor violations.

‘Actually it’s not a change. It’s
bringing back the way it used to
be. It’s a revitalization of an old
White Book,’’ Feldman expilain-
ed.

Addition of law rep goes to student vote

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Students will vote next week on
an amendment to the Student
Body constitution that would pro-
vide for the addition of an Ex-
ecutive Committee member to
represent the second-year law
class.

The EC adopted the amend-
ment 10-1-1, with President Bob
Jenevein opposed, Monday night.
In order for the amendment to be
adopted, one-half of the members
of the student body will have to
vote, and two-thirds of those

oting will have to support the

amendment. Polls will be open
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs-
day.

Four members of next year’s
EC were appointed to work with
the officers of the Student Bar
Association Board of Governors
to develop a plan for SBA fiscal
changes. Law students last week
voted by a three-to-one margin
for the SBA to assume fiscal and
administrative autonomy from
the EC.

Appearing at the EC meeting,
outgoing SBA President Kelly
Wrenn said, ‘‘We’re not talking
ah~' secession; we're talking

a re-allocation of the

decision-making process.”’

The SBA wants to be guaran-
teed a fixed percentage of the stu-
dent activities funds it con-
tributes to the EC with no EC
budgetary review, line-by-line
veto or freezing of those funds,
Wrenn said. If ‘‘an amicable solu-
tion’’ can’t be reached, he added,
‘then we're prepared to go to the
Board of Trustees.”’

SBA President-elect John
Sicilian explained that the SBA
would increase the amount given
to the EC during Mock Conven-
tion years and would petition the
EC if it needed more money dur-
i particular year

EC President-elect Cole
Dawson said he is in favor of
working out a compromise with
the Law School. ‘‘It will cut down
on a lot of the abrasiveness at the
beginning of the year between the
EC and the Law School,’’ Dawson
said.

Dawson, vice president-elect
James White, junior representa-
tive-elect Pat Hayden and
sophomore representative-elect
Shayam Menon will represent the
EC for discussions with the SBA
SBA.

Most of the debate about the ad-
ditional Law School represen

(continued on page 12)

Feldman said he voted in favor
of the proposal because he
wanted to reincorprate some of
the qualities of old White Books
that had engendered respect for
the honor system.

“The point we're trying to
make with this is let’s take the
honor system seriously,’ Reap
said.

Reap added that at first he had
mixed feelings about the ‘‘toler-
ance clause,” because he was
afraid an atmosphere in which
everyone was spying on everyone
else might result from the
clause’s adoption. But he said he
felt it was more important for
students to take seriously their
responsibility to confront some-
one they see committing a possi-
ble honor violation.

When asked about the changes
the committee was proposing,
Messer listed several other
changes, but did not mention the
“tolerance clause.”

‘We haven't completed work
yet, but the changes we've made
this year have been helpful in
clarifying confusion. The
changes we are making are very
substantial. I think everyone will
be pleased with the changes
we've made,’ Messer com-
mented.

Messer said the committee
should finish meeting by tomor-
row and a retyped version of the
White Book with the proposed
revisions underlined will be
available Monday.

Another proposed change in the
White Book is that the actual
pledge will be included, Messer
reported. Messer said it is impor-
tant for students to know the ac-
tual wording of the pledge and to
write it out. However, all work is
considered pledged at Washing-
ton and Lee regardless, Messer
noted.

“Il was all for writing out the
pledge,’ said Feldman. ‘It
makes you more aware of what
you are doing,’ he added.

Duty to be Fair

We think it is time for the law school to get a deserv-
ed third. representative to the Executive Committee.
To bring this about, the students must pass a constitu-
tional amendment, which in the past has been a dif-
ficult task.

It is important for the law school to receive a third
representative to the EC for several reasons. First, it
would give the EC more guidance during honor hear-
ings. Because in most cases a student accused of an
honor violation is represented by a law student, it is
essential for the EC to have the best legal guidance in
preparing for both open and closed trials.

Second, the gap between the undergraduate and
law students has been growing, in part, because the
law students feel they are not completely repre-
sented. Currently there is a first-year law represen-

tative and a senior law representative. Law students
argue that with this arrangement, one class will
necessarily be without direct representation.

Third, working on the EC is immensely time con-
suming and a third law representative could help ease
the burden of leadership which often falls on the
shoulders of one or two members.

The undergraduates, however, hold the key to the
success or failure of this endeavor. For a constitu-
tional amendment to pass, half the student body must
vote, and two-thirds of those voting must vote in favor
of the proposal. Undergraduates must not view this
matter strictly as a law school affair. The amend-
ment would affect all students so it is the responsibili-
ty of all students to vote.

Fighting Apathy

We commend the Omicron Delta Kappa leadership
fraternity for undertaking the series of forums it is
holding regarding student life at W&L. Apathy and a
lack of communication have been discussed quite a
bit this year and finally someone is trying to do
something about it. These forums depend on student
participation to work and we encourage all students
to attend these forums, which will be held tonight and
Monday night.

Tonight’s topic is W&L’s intellectual environment
and the topic Monday night is social life at W&L. The
forums begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Northen Auditorium.

To the Editors:

I would urge you all to support
the upcoming referendum con-
cerning a Constitutional amend-
ment that provides for the addi-
tion of another law represen-
tative to the EC. This represen-
tative would serve dual objec-
tives. Obviously, the person
would represent second year law
student interests in ad-
ministrative matters. More im-
portantly though, the additional
representative would provide an
added source of knowledge in
honor related functions.

The added representative
would benefit all students. The
EC would gain additional exper-
tise in the closed hearings,
thereby helping to prevent any
student from being denied a fair
hearing. The amendment would
also afford the EC an additional
advocate to choose from in the
event of an open hearing. This is
a critical point because the first
year law rep (affectionately
known as the law maggot) is nor-
mally not as well versed as the
defense advocates (I know — I
was law maggot last year).

Finally, the additional
representative would help imple-
ment the honor system in the law
school. Law students are more
likely to know students in their
own class and would be less hesi-
tant in reporting potential viola-
tions to someone they knew. This
would facilitate operation of the
honor system university wide.

Review and Outlook Ll hird Law School EC rep needed

I would be happy to answer any
question concerning this amend-
ment. Please give it thoughtful
consideration and hopefully all
will realize this amendment is for
the good of the university. Thank
you.

Ungentlemanly conduct
will not be tolerated |

To the Editors:

Lately it has come to our atten-
tion that the W&L tradition of
gentlemanly conduct has not
been taken seriously across the
footbridge at athletic events.
These games are not attended by
students alone, and it is a sad
state of affairs when alumni and
parents feel the profanity at
athletic events is so severe that

they cannot bring their children.

to a game. Many parents prefer
to listen to a game on the radio in
order to spare themselves the
embarrassment caused by the
profanity that takes place at
athletic events. This type of con-

duct will no longer be tolerated. ©
In the future, reports of profanity
or ungentlemanly conduct at ath-
letic events will be handled by the
Student Control Committee. If
you find yourself unable to
behave as a gentleman at a
game, please do not attend.
Otherwise, you risk being per-
manently prohibited from attend-
ing these events.
Thank you for your coopera-
tion.

Chairman, Student Control
Committee

President, Executive Committee

Amendment passage urged

To the Editors:

It has come to my attention as a
member of the student body and
more recently, the Executive
Committee, that there is an
urgent need for representation in
the Executive Committee from
the second-year law students.

I say urgent, because the posi-
tion can in fact, be created this
year, by amending the university
constitution. This is by no means
an easy task, two-thirds of half
the student body must vote affir-

- Matively, but the time to do so is

now.
With the conspicuous exception
of the second year law class,

every student body class at
Washington and Lee, under-
graduate freshmen to third-year
law students are represented in
the Executive Committee. It is
time for equal representation,
without exception.

After hearing highly _ per-
suasive arguments for the crea-
tion of a third EC law member
from the Student Bar Associa-
tion, the EC committee voted
strongly in favor of adding a 13th
member. This may never come
about, however, if there is not
strong student support, not only
from the law students but from
undergraduates as well. I hope

Caruthers urges amendment

To the Editors:

I am writing in order to en-
courage students to vote for a
constitutional amendment the
Executive Committee has en-
dorsed. This amendment would
add a Second-year Law represen-
tative to the EC, thereby giving
the Law School one rep from each
class. The change is urgently
needed and has been overlooked
in the past.

From an undergraduate view-
point, an additional law school
student would give the EC
another possible advocate, would
add more maturity to the EC, and
would also keep it more in touch
with what goes on at the Law
School.

Please vote for the amendment
on either Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday at one of the referen-

aum polls. The amendment needs

two-thirds of 50 percent of the stu-
dent body to pass.

Phi Columnist
This year has been cnaracteriz-
ed by attempts, some almost
desperate, to ‘‘define”’ this place;
everyone from Markham Pyle to
President Wilson has tried to put
W&L into words. This is, of
course, silly. Attempts to nail

place usually result in intangible,
emotion-tinged descriptions. This
is not to say that these ‘‘special
aspects”’ (things that set us apart

i
My View

from and above other schools)
don’t exist — just that they are
not easily grasped. The con-
creteness is subjective. The
special dimension to our com-
munity is, or ought to be, the
common denominator of charac-
ter — the shared sense of honor
and integrity of which our Honor
System is an outcropping. This
collective ‘‘nobility’’ is doubtless-
ly nurtured by the all-male
camaraderie and the almost
spiritual presence of General
Lee. Regardless of the source,
however, the shared sense of
honor and integrity is the life’s
blood of everything special about
our community. Without it we are
nothing but an ordinary small
university — or actually less than
ordinary because we would be a

| hollow form of a once great place.

 

Without integrity,
WGL is ordinary

down the special aspects of this’

This supposedly shared right-
mindedness, even causing us to
have a ‘“‘System”’ ‘to protect the}
trust, has no definite boundaries.
It centers around the core con-
cept of honor (e.g. lying, cheating
and stealing), but there are fur-
ther implications to expecting in-
tegrity of each other. A lot of
behavior not sanctionable by the
System is nevertheless contrary
to any shared integrity. If we do
want to pressure W&L, then we
should not tolerate such
behavior.

Recently an alumnus had to
take his family away from aj
lacrosse game because of
students screaming obscenities.
How can we purport honor and in-
tegrity while allowing each other
to behave this way? The person
pointing this incident out to me
emphasized the link between
manners and morals. He is cor-
rect; screaming obscenities inj
public, especially in earshot of of-
fendable persons, is a violation of
our common trust. Those stu-
dents who wish to offend others
by shouting in public or by scrat-
ching into elevator doors are
surely a minority here —which is
all the more reason for the ma-
jority to refuse to tolerate such
behavior. I am not, of course,
suggesting that we form lynch
mobs. But some peer pressure in
the direction of what we value
would be more than welcome
these days.

Affirmative Action failing ?

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

Affirmative Action, the govern-
ment regulations requiring the
hiring of minorities in order to fill
quotas, has failed since its incep-
tion, largely because it has
ironically promoted “‘racism and
sexism,’ according to Ad-
ministration Professor Roger
Dean. If programs similar to Af-
firmative Action are introduced,
Dean sees an equally pessimistic
future awaiting them.

According to Dean, a specialist
in behavioral science in the
workplace, Affirmative Action
has “discriminated against one
group in favor of another, the
reverse discrimination dealt with
under the Supreme Court’s
historic 1978 Bakke decision,
which declared racial entrance
quotas illegal for public medical

schools. ‘
“10 promote race is not good

enough without also promoting
merits,’ Dean said.

“You discriminate then against
all groups: women, blacks, Jews,
Catholics.”

Dean referred to the 1964 Civil
Rights Act for further evidence of
the shortcomings of the Affir-
mative Action quotas.

“The Civil Rights Act says you
cannot discriminate against
anyone on the basis of race, sex,
religion, color or national
origin,’ he noted, adding that
presently Gay Rights groups
have tried to include “sexual
preference’’ to that list.

“The penalties involved in
breaking any (of those areas) in
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act

were sufficient to eliminate
racism, but Affirmative Action
has promoted racism ‘“‘by further
deciding not only that such
discrimination should not occur,

but that a sufficient quota or

number should ensure that dis-
crimination no longer exists,”’
Dean said.

The effect of Affirmative Ac-
tion mentality stretches beyond
the hiring process to many
diverse areas, according to Dean.
One such area is education, he
said.

“Only because a student is
black and the teacher is scared of
being called a racist do many
teachers pass blacks,’’ said
Dean. “As a foreigner (to the
United States) and new in 1976, I
was never aware of (the pre-
ferential treatment given
minorities in the U.S.) and the
fear of racism and its label.”’

A native of Bribane, Australia,
Dean says little exposure is given
racism in his native land. The
aborigines never really entered
Australia’s society, he said, and
they are really the only minority
group native to Australia .

‘Australia has formal, legis-
lated racism against non-whites.
The Socialists and the Labor
unions promoted the all-white
policy,” he said. “It limits the im-
migration of non-whites into the
country as well as placing visa
limits on non-whites.”’

“It is totally different from
apartheid (in South Africa)
because it is not discriminating
against those in the country but
those entering the country. Don’t
get confused. Every country has

a right to decide who enters the
country.”’

A second area in shich Affir-
mative Action has had a great in-
fluence is in the recent discussion
over the notion of ‘comparable
worth.”” The comparable worth
idea expands the concept of equal
pay for jobs requiring com-
parably equal levels of skill,
knowledge and duty. It de
emphasizes the actual duties per-
formed in jobs, Dean said, while
placing great weight on com-
parable levels of effort, respon-
siblity, knowledge and working
conditions.

“Comparable worth is more a
male-female issue than a racial
one, but a problem created by
women who want to justify get-
ting higher pay,” Dean said.

Dean cited a recent case in the
state of Washington where laun-
dry workers were suing for pay
equivalent to that received by
truck drivers. The launderers
cited equal levels of skill and
responsibility in the case as war-
ranting equal pay.

“This is dangerous because the
courts will be deciding how much
a company should pay for a job,”’
noted Dean.

He gave a hypothetical case in-
volving a secretary and a truck
driver to illustrate his point.

“(A woman might) choose to
work as a secretary and choose
not to be a truck driver, but then
turns around and says she should
be paid the same amount as the
truck driver,” regardless of her
choice, Dean said. ‘“That’s

wrong.”’

Coverage of honor trial broke Phi policy

. graduate vacation.

By SCOTT MASON
Phi Columnist
When the The Ring-tum Phi printed the
fact last week that a public honor trial had
been held during vacation, it broke policy.
For years the rule has been that infor-
mation about public or private honor trials

is not to be printed. Why? It’s felt that an:

honor trial is for the W&L community only.
“Since the paper goes beyond the com-
munity, we have to be really careful about
what we say,”’ Chief Editor Rick Swagler
explained.

That policy has remained unbroken for
as long as anyone can remember. That is,

until last week when the Phi a took

Reader’s
Advocate

SRA NRO RUE MR EERE SSRN NRRL EH
its policy and threw it out the window. It

printed information about a public honor
trial that had been held during under-
“The thing that
distinguished this (trial) from others is
that students weren’t here. We thought
that there was some sort of duty to tell
students what went on,”’ Swagler said.
That all sounds very generous. But while
the Phi was doing its ‘‘duty,” it was also
turning its back on long-held reasoning for
not covering open trials. Information con-
sidered solely a W&L matter did in fact go

beyond the W&L campus when the Phi
printed last week’s article.

In this kind of Catch-22 situation where
the Phi informed students but at the same
time let the general public in on a campus
matter, the Phi should have stayed by its
traditional policy and not printed any-
thing.

It seems that at least one purpose behind
public honor trials is for students to
witness first-hand the trial process; they
are able to decide for themselves the guilt
or innocence of the accused. Since
undergraduates were on vacation when
the particular trial in question was held,
they wouldn’t have been able to attend the
hearing anyway. And since that purpose
had been defeated, there was really no
reason for the Phi to print information
about the trial. Indeed, the information
was “‘newsworthy”’ only in that it appealed
to a kind of “morbid curiosity.” The
generalities the Phi printed have
generated gossip and rumors about
specifics of the trial (i.e., that the accused
was, in reality, guilty and deserved to be
expelled). All that contributes to the fact
that the Phi allowed a non-campus au-
dience to receive information involving a
private W&L affiar.

Swagler disagrees. He believes that the
vacationing undergradutes needed to
know the trial took place if only to

Strengthen in them an awareness of the

W&L honor system as a whole. ‘Certainly
seeing the trial and deciding for yourself is

one purpose... but it (the trial) is also a
visible sign that the honor system is still
around. Every time that there is an honor
trial, it reminds students that the system is
still there and that it functions,’’ Swagler
said.

As for gossip, Swagler believes that kind
of thing is inevitable. ‘‘I don’t think that by
printing what we did, we generated any
rumors that wouldn’t have been there
anyway.”

Swagler, in fact, isn’t convinced that
open honor trials should be always kept
within W&L boundaries. Coverage of
honor trials could boost parent and alumni
awareness of the honor system, Swagler
believes. ‘“‘They know that the system
works and that we are taking care of
ourselves,’’ he said. This, though, must
outweigh the good of keeping it in the com-
munity, he added.

And that brings us now up to the present.
Although the Phi’s decision last week to
break policy and cover the open honor trial
was a rare occurrence, it may not be rare
much longer. Next year’s editors, Mike
Allen and Bruce Potter, have already
decided to report the results of open trials
next year. Both teams agree that whatever
information they print will be of a general
nature only (the name of the accused, for
example, will be left out.)

The Phi is treading into a very
dangerous area and, what’s worse, it’s
treading carelessly into that area with its
eyes firmly shut. The Phi now has no

policy whatsoever concerning public honor
trials. The policy it did have, the same
policy it has had for years, was the one
that got abruptly killed last week. Now,
Editors Swagler and Cleghorn think they
might start covering open trials, but
they’re not really sure how in-depth their
coverage should be. The same indecision
exists among next year’s editors. It’s this
type of undertainty that can lead to care-
lessness and inconsistent reporting.

In any case, the Phi seems to be ad-
vocating some sort of open trial coverage,
and that’s what is most dangerous of all.
For, by covering open honor trials, the
tendency will be there to dramatize the
event, thereby trivializing the whole honor
system process. There may also be the
likelihood of fueling rumors, rumors that
could taint or distort the character of the
accused. Finally, and most importantly, is
that open honor trials belong within the
confines of the W&L community. It’s a
strange but effective honor system that ex-
ists at W&L, and because it’s different-
from most school’s, outsiders don’t really
understand it. To them it’s Perry Mason
courtroom drama complete with prosecu-
tion, defense, juries and witnesses. At
least that’s the way they’re likely to see it
once the Phi begins covering open honor
trials. And when that happens, the honor
system becomes not the unique, ‘‘sacred,”’
effective system it’s always been, but in-
stead a trivial, unrespected drama that’s
rather like a TV show.

Falwell brings I Moral Majority dogma to W&L

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Jerry Falwell showed last
Thursday night why he and his
Moral Majority have become
such a force in American politics
in recent years.

In his speech in Lee Chapel
Falwell condemned homosexuali-
ty, abortion, drug use and por-
nography, while giving his sup-
port to Ronald Reagan. Israel,
prayer in schools, a strong na-
tional defense and the return of

what he called morality in
America.
The evangelical fundamen-

talist minister displayed the elo-
quence, wit and friendly smile
that have helped mim amass a
following of millions of religious
conservatives.

Since 1979, when he _ heiped
establish Moral Majority, he has
been preaching these philoso-
phies from the pulpit.

Before 1979, Falwell said in his
speech, ‘We actually were losing
the battle on the moral and social
issues because we had absented
ourselves from the (political)
arena.”

The Moral Majority learned in
1979 through a commissioned
poll, Falwell said, that only 55
percent of its members were

registered to vote, compared
with a national average of 72 per-
cent,

“And of the 55 percent
registered....the majority of
them were not even exercising
their basic citizenship right —and
obligation — of casting a vote.”’

‘‘} think you can see that if they
can be committed not just to a
party or a politician, but rather to
principles,’ Falwell said, ‘‘that
we could in fact have a very
significant role in redirecting the

moral health and goals of this
republic of ours.”

The reason he endorses
Reagan, Faiwell said after the
speech, is the president’s views
on morality among other things.

Faiweil said he expects Walter
Mondale to win the Democratic
nomination, run on a ticket with
Gary Hart and lose the election to
Reagan.

‘(Mondale) is, I think,
Reagan’s best choice as an oppo-
nent, because I think he is a
loser.”’

“T really cannot imagine why
any of Reagan's supporters of
1980 would not also be his sup-
porters in 1984,"’ Falweil said.

He said in his speech that he

believed that by electing leaders
committed to traditional morals,
America would experience what

historians will cail a rebirth.

“The majority of Americans
who believe in the values we've
shared tonight are the people who
put (this country) together, and
they are the people who, like
most of you in this room tonight,
should be having the major say in
the direction of this country.”’

Parents who did not instill in
their children a set of traditional
values produced ‘‘a_ social
disease of materialism’’ and ‘‘a
social disease called rebellion
that —— during the ‘60s and ‘70s
particularly — produced the two
decades that we often call the
Dark Ages of the 20th century,
when this nation almost went to
hell.”’

Most of the audience gave
Falwell a standing ovation at the
end of his speech, which was
sponsored by the College
Republicans. Falwell did not
receive any money for his ap-
pearance.

Falwell was booed at one point
in the question-and-answer
period, though, when he respond-
ed to written questions from the
audience. One person stood up to
press Falwell on the question of
whether Moral Majority has ever
banned books.

‘Where did you read that -—— in
Gay Blade?”’ Falwell retorted.

in response to critics who ques-
tioned whether it is right for him
to preach politics from the pulpit,
Falwell pointed out that if it was
all right for civil rights activist
preachers and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, it was all right for him.

Creating a liberal plattorm
on a conservative campus

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention Correspondent

There is little doubt that the 16-
member Committee on Resolu-
tions (the Platform Committee)
of the Washington and Lee Mock
Convention has created a truly
Democratic platform. Consider-
ing the generally conservative
make-up of the W&L student
body, such a task does not appear
to be simple.

Recognizing that the platform
is the only part of a Mock Conven-
tion traditionally designated to
reflect student opinion, the
members of the committee
realized that they had to address
this problem from the outset.

‘We had to reconcile student
opinion with actual Democratic
opinion, but here that simply
would not work too well,’’ related
B. Scott Tilley, chairman of the
Platform Committee.

The 1980 Democratic platform
and the 1982 midterm platform
were the primary reference
sources for the committee,
besides the ideas and knowledge
of individual members.

“We decided it was best to

come up with a Democratic plat-
form based on research and have
the student opinion reflected dur-
ing the debate and voting,”’ Tilley
explained.

A good portion of the commit-
tee’s time has been spent de-
veloping the structure of the
debate, which will be held on the
opening night of the Convention.

Each chapter of the platform
will be addressed favorably by a
majority speaker, the member of
the committee who wrote that
section, as well as a minority
speaker who will present the op-
posing view of the planks. These
speeches will each be limited to
three minutes.

It is at this time that any nine
individual delegates on the floor
will be recognized by chairman
Tilley to give a one-minute
speech for or against that par-
ticular section of the platform.

“At the Convention itself, the
platform debate will be the only
place where each delegate will
have the opportunity to express
himself,”’ said Tilley.

Because it is impossible to ad-
dress every issue contained with-
in an entire platform chapter in

the time allotted, the majority
and minority speakers will center
their arguments around the key
issues of that chapter in an effort
to focus and limit the floor debate
that will ensue.

The 15-page platform will be
contained within the delegate
convention packets to be
distributed during delegate
registration.

The tone of the 1984 W&L
Democratic platform, consisting
of five chapters, is set by a
preamble attacking the ‘‘insen-
sitivity of the current administra-
tion’’ and offering ‘‘solutions that
not only meet the needs of many
but reaffirm our commitment to
improve the conditions of the
least fortunate in society.”’

Chapter One of the platform
deals with the economy, stressing
a theme a fairness for all
Americans. Key planks include
opposition to a Constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced
budget and a call for special sub-
sidies for minority and woman-
owned small businesses.

The second chapter calls for
continued commitment to the
passage of the Equal Rights

Amendment, stating that the
‘‘Reagan Administration is simp-
ly not interested in justice for
women.” Also in this chapter,
titled “‘“Government and Human
Needs,”’ is an education plank
supporting an exemption for col-
lege graduates from paying back
student loans if they become
teachers.

Government operation and
reform is addressed in Chapter
Three of the platform, with key
issues being a call for public
financing of Congressional cam-
paigns and stricter handgun con-
trol legislation.

Chapter Four centers on
energy, agriculture and the en-
vironment, emphasizing the Ad-
ministration’s ‘‘short-sighted”’
energy policy. This section
stresses the development of solar
energy and a goal of producing 20
percent of the country’s energy
needs by the end of the century. A
key issue to be raised during the
platform debate will be this
chapter’s inclusion of a call for a
reduction of federal support for
the development of nuclear
power.

The fifth and final platform
chapter deals with foreign af-
fairs. It contains a plank calling
for the withdrawal of all United
States troops (and others) from
Lebanon as well as a condemna-
tion of the Reagan Administra-

tion’s ‘‘war-like actions’ in E]
Salvador and Nicaragua. Al-
though various weapon systems
are called for in this section, in-
cluding the MX missile and the
Trident submarine, a statement
requesting the ‘‘immediate end to
the arms race with the USSR”’
also is present.

“I feel that the platform aspect
is particularly important because
it ties together two integral parts
of what the Convention is striving
for — a combination of student
opinion and Democratic authen-
ticity,’’ commented Tilley.

Each chapter of the platform
will be voted on separately by a
voice vote.

In related Convention news, the
Cable News Network (CNN) has
confirmed its plans to cover the
Mock Convention on Saturday,
May 12. CNN will be joined by the
RKO Radio Network, United
Press International and the
Associated Press, among other
news organizations, in covering
the Mock Convention.

Co-chairman Steve Lewis also
announced this week that a
“kick-off” party will be held Fri-
day evening, May 4, in Evans
Dining Hall for all student par-
ticipants in the Mock Convention
and invited guests. Two bands,
Targetz and Steps, will be
performing.

D Train, Lite Year featured in SABU Ball

 

The feature band at the SABU Ball will be the nationally acclaimed ‘‘D Train” who will play their top

chart single ‘‘Keep On.”

 

 

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Desiring to attract at least 250
Washington and Lee students and
500 members of the public, the
W&L Student Association for
Black Unity will sponsor the 13th
annual SABU Ball on Saturday,
May 5, at Warner Center.

‘We would like to see 250
members from the W&L com-
munity at the Ball. That’s our
goal,’’ said SABU President Ron
Magee. Magee said he expects
total attendance to run between
750 and 1,000 persons.

The ball, which begins at 8:30
p.m., will kick off with the band
“Lite Year.”’ This Virginia Beach
group will play two 45-minute
sets of Top 40 and contemporary

 

music. According to Magee and
SABU Ball Chairman Ira Pur-
year, ‘‘Lite Year’’ will be follow-
ed by a fashion show of spring
and summer wear.

The Ball’s feature band is inter-
nationally acclaimed ‘‘D Train,”’
which has been named best new
group by several polls. Having
just returned from a very suc-
cessful European tour, the band
has seen its single ‘‘Keep On”
skyrocket to the top of the
overseas charts. Another single,
‘“‘You’re the One for Me,’’ has
also been well received.

According to John D. White,
dean of Minority Affairs, all pro-
ceeds from the ball will go to the
Marjorie Poindexter Student
Fund, which provides financial
assistance to students in times of

unusual emergency or extraor-
dinary need. The fund, establish-
ed in 1983 in memory of Mrs.
Poindexter, who died in Novem-
ber, will be administered by the
W&L Office of Student Financial
Aid. Mrs. Poindexter had served
on the Washington and Lee staff
since 1968.

SABU has never kept any of the
ball’s profits, which have always
gone back to the school, accor-
ding to White. ‘‘We hope to at
least put $2,500 into the (Poindex-
ter) Fund,”’ said Magee.

Both Magee and Puryear term
the event a “remarkable time.”’
They see it as an inexpensive, en-
joyable evening featuring fine
music and free hors d’oeuvres,
beer and punch. Complimentary

carnations will be given to all the
women.

“It (Warner Center) looks like
a nightclub,” explained Puryear.

“Everyone on campus is in-
vited,’’ said Magee, who noted
that there are always plenty of
single men and women in atten-
dance. ‘‘We would hope the entire
W&L community would see what
we are doing as an alternative for
that Saturday night,”’ he said.

The SABU Ball was never
meant to be an alternative to
Fancy Dress Ball, although it
may have once seemed that way.
‘In the past, we haven’t gotten
many white students,’ said
Magee. According to Dean White,
the SABU Ball used to be the
culmination of Black Culture
Week, normally about three
weeks after Fancy Dress.

By moving the ball to the spr-
ing, SABU has seen the event ex-
pand. “Last year was the first
year we moved to the gym,”’
“fagee said. According to

 

Puryear, the SABU Ball, now
known as ‘‘The Spring Thing,’
was almost always a week before
final exams, which cut into atten-
dance. This spring date also
makes the ball more accessible
for area citizens and alumni who
worried about weather conditions
when traveling. ‘“‘The ball at-
tracts a lot of people from the
area,’’ said Puryear.

The SABU Ball is the only
minority function in the local
region that is over a decade old,
according to White. ‘The tradi-
tion of the ball has hung on,” he
said.

Tickets for ‘The Spring Thing”’
cost $10 per person and may be
purchased from the Office of
Minority Affairs in Payne Hall or
the Minority Cultural Center at 10
Lee Avenue, two doors down
from the Sigma Chi Fraternity.
Proper dress is required. Accord-
ing to Magee, a coat, tie and
slacks are appropriate.

The legend about mermaids
has been around for quite awhile,
but never in my wildest dreams
as a child did I envision
something as beautiful as Daryl
Hannah with a tail. This is the
story line of the new release,
Splash, from the people at Disney
(getting a little risque in their old
age).

Flicks
Picks

Tom Hanks plays the basic
lovable leading man who happens
to fall in love with a mermaid
visiting the Big Apple via Atlan-
tis. From the opening scene
where she visits the Statue of
Liberty in the buff, I was in love
with Daryl the Mermaid (the pro-
nunciation of her real name
resulted in several exploding TV
screens, thus the omission).

 

 

John Candy is also in rare form

Daryl’s a Splash

as the hopelessly perverted
brother of Tom Hanks. Director
Ron Howard, of Happy Days
fame, did a splendid job of com-
bining the kind of All-America
comedy Disney is famous fo
with the rowdy slapstick of Candy
and the voluptuous good looks of
Miss Hannah. The net result is an
unusually fine comedy treatment
of a screenplay that could have
easily ended up as kiddie porn.

As for the concept of a mer-
maid for the 80s, the Splash
people did themselves proud by
picking Miss Hannah for the role.
She is fabulously healthy and her
wild blond hairdo was the most
attractive blouse I’ve seen in
years. She is in a word, tubular
(for all you valley people).

So, my advice to the W&L
moviegoer is to definitely go see
this flick because the price of see-
ing a girl redefine the fable is
well worth it, at any cost.
However, one word of caution:
Don’t take a date to this late show
because odds are you won’t be too
interested afterwards. (Unless of
course she can go one-on-one with
Daryl Hannah.) |

makes it fun.”

‘Most of whatever our fee is

‘“‘We want students to identify

times the double-bacon
cheeseburger will be melty and
out of this world, and another
time you won’t go past the first
bite. This goes for the chicken
burgers and other sandwiches as
well, and it has to do with
freshness. When Lloyd’s is busy,
it’s better, because they cook the
sandwiches when you order
them, and they’re hot and fresh.
But when you go, say, in the mid-
dle of the night or in the middle of
the afternoon, the sandwiches are
often already made and kept
fresh only by a warming light.
Food like bacon and chicken
burgers need to be hot, not old
and simply warm, to be good.

Yet if you go during odd hours,
there are certain things which
are always good. Lloyd’s has
delicious and very thick vanilla,
chocolate, and strawberry milk-
shakes. Also, the chicken nug-
gets, a new item, can always be
counted on. They are crunchy on
the outside, and tender on the in-
side, and have a taste not unlike a

Ultimately, the best thing
about Lloyd’s is that it stays open
24 hours a day. I'd be a liar if I
said it was better than Wendy’s,
but late at night, when you've got
no right to be driving, Lloyd’s is
near, cheap and open. And if
you’re pulling an_ all-nighter,
Lloyd’s is the place to get caf-
feine, with hot coffee or huge
cups of iced tea. And the cookies
are good, especially the peanut
butter ones.

Not to forget, Lloyd is a nice
guy. He knows many of us by our
first names and is always friend-
ly. And ever since he opened a
couple of years ago, he’s con-
stantly experimented with new
items. Some have stuck, like the
chicken nuggets, and others, like
the stuffed potatoes, have faded
into well-deserved obscurity. But
there has always been an effort
by Lloyd to expand and improve
the quality.

record to 4-7.

With the Ketrievers leading 6-5,
Caughlin stymied the Generals
seven times in the first five
minutes of the third quarter and
on eight more occasions in the
second half. He had 18% saves on
the game.

Goals by David Johnston and
Barry Waterman gave W&L the
lead, 7-6, before UMBC’s Chuck
Reid scored his fourth goal of the
game to make it 7-7 at the end of
the third. Overall, there were
seven ties and six lead changes.
Neither team led by more than
one goa} until the fourth quarter.

The score was tied 2-2 after the
first quarter. W&L defenseman
Chris John accounted for the
Generals’ second score when he
started a clear at midfield and.
broke through the defense un-
impeded.

In the second quarter, Sandy
Brown scored twice and Lee
Heimert, connected for his 23rd
goal, in an extra-man situation,
_to create a 3-3 deadlock at the in-
termission. °

UMBC’s Mark Hodgkins
started the decisive uprising in
the fourth quarter. His goal was
followed by Mark Gold’s rising
shot that got past goalie John

Let’s not question Mr. Knight's

By MIKE STACHURA

...We saw a good number of
gaping-mouthed reports from the
press this weekend on the so-
called ‘Basketball boot camp” of
Bobby Knight in Bloomington,
Ind., where the 1984 Olympic
hoops team was being selected.
The “Oh my” tone of the

coverage of the tryouts was
almost a questioning of Knight’s
methods. I agree that Mr. Knight
was tough on the Olympic
hopefuls, but I find nothing wrong
with his attitude. Knight sees one
purpose of his Olympic tenure
—and he’s stated it freely — that
being to bring back the gold. Bob-
by Knight. is intense and highly
motivated, but above all, he

knows how to wrench out of some-
one their very best. The boot
camp in Bloomington 1s surely
wustifiable. Knight went into the
Olympic tryouts with some strict-

DiDuro. Then, with 9:31 remain-
ing, Hank Starkey notched his
second goal for a 10-7 advantage.
Greg Goss conpleted UMBC’s at-
tack with goals at 8:34 and 3:24.
W&L's lone goal of the quarter,
by Jeff Mason, made it 11-8 with
7:23 to go.

Saturday, Division III’s 11th-
ranked Denison surprised the

Generals with a five-goal third- -

quarter surge that ended in a 8-5
upset victory for the Big Red.

The Generals countered
Denison’s first three goals. But
after W&L’s Rod Santomassimo

ly defined qualifications for his
Olympic basketball player. He

-wanted, first of all, a solid defen-

sive player, ready to go chest-to-
chest for 90 feet. A very sound
idea because the worst you can
finish with a perfect defense is a
0-0 tie. He wanted quick guards

sense, strong forwards with in-
side and outside capabilities, and
dominating centers with strength
on both ends of the floor. More
importantly, I think Knight
wanted players who made you sit
up and take notice just when they
execute the fundamentals. His
three-a-day workout routine was
an ideal method to weed out — to
paraphrase Tom Payne -— the
sunshine patriot and summer
soldier of the basketball floor. So
let's not question Knight’s
methods. Seems to me, a guy

circled the Denison goal and put
in a screened shot to make it 3-3
with 8:30 left in the third quarter,
the Big Red stunned the 1,000 or
so fans by running off five
unanswered goals. The last four
came within a period of less than
two minutes late in the third
quarter. The outburst proved to
be insurmountable.

A tight defense by the Big Red
and goalie Bill Hall, who came up
with several big saves throughout
the game, frustrated the
Generals and left them surprised.

“There was nothing (from

here’s wishing good luck to a pair
of General squads, track & field

record and let’s hope their good
fortune continues. An_indoor-
outdoor double would be as nice
as it is deserved. And the ODAC
tennis championships will be
here this weekend, starting
tomorrow. It appears Lynchburg
and the Generals will decide the
conference champion. The
Generals need strong showings

they would be efficient at taking
the ball away,’’ said W&L head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘“‘They were
supposed to run with us. But their
defense, especially at midfield,
was better than any team we've
played so far.”’

Denison also took advantage of
several unsettled situations.
Their only goal of the second
quarter came about when Andy

omore defenseman Chris John,

In the third quarter, a suc-
cessful clear led to Henry
Galleher’s goal that put Denison
in the lead for good, 4-3. Three
minutes later, a remarkable ef-
fort by Jay Dugan gave Denison a
two-goal advantage. The soph-
omore midfielder slipped on the
wet field but kept his concentra-
tion to slap in the ball as he was
falling from 15 yards. The Big
Red was called for a one-minute
penalty for slashing nine seconds
later. But Andy John capitalized
on a two-on-one break during the
man-down situation to create a
three-goal margin. The lead
became as big as 8-3 when
Painter and Dan Waterhouse con-
nected.

effective,’ Daly said. ‘‘The
Statistics showed that they
(Denison) were successful on on-
ly 53 percent of their clear, com-
pared to 83 percent for us. The
difference for them was that the
times they broke our ride, they
were able to get goals off of it.”’

Daly was asked if the Generals
underestimated Denison. He
responded, ‘‘It’s hard tosay. Asa
coaching staff, we put in ad-
justments to their rides. We lack-
ed the intensity of Denison and
weren't as up as they were.
Superticially, it seemed that we

Baseball back into the swing of things

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team won four of its six
conference games last week and
in the process, served notice to
the other conference teams that it

will be a force to be reckoned
with in the upcoming ODAC tour-
nament.

The four wins improved the
Generals record to 8-11 (5-7 in the
ODAC).

Starts tomorrow

 

The Generals split a double-
header yesterday with Eastern
Mennonite in Harrisonburg. In
the first game, Billy White hurled
a one-hitter, allowing only a bloop
single in the Generals’ 12-0 -vic-
tory.

Freshman Milam Turner led
W&L’s 14-hit barrage with four
hits in as many at-bats. Hugh
Finkelstein had a three-run home
run and Bill Curtiss had a two-run
shot for the Generals, who scored
eight runs in the first four inn-

ings.

In the second game, Eastern
Mennonite scored in the bottom
of the seventh inning to win 11-10.

The Generals battled back
from an 8-4 deficit early in the
game to lead 10-8 entering the
sixth inning. Eastern Mennonite
averted the loss by scoring two
runs in the sixth inning and the
winning run in the seventh.

W&L was led offensively again

The Washington and Lee tennis
team will defend its 1983 Old

championship title this weekend
with an undefeated conference
record and an overall record of
12-7.

The Generals split matches last
weekend, winning at Hampden-
Sydney by a score of 5-1 and los-
ing at James Madison, 9-0.

W&L won five of the six singles
matches at Farmville before rain
forced the concellation of the
doubles. Head tennis coach Gary

The Generals suffered a set-
back on Monday at JMU, losing
9. Coach Franke does not
believe that his team played
poorly, despite their losing every
match.

“Madison played extremely
well and they have a very good
team. Thet were surprisingly
good,”’ Franke said.

The Generals did play a couple
of close matches. Scott Adams
played a tough match at the No. 4
singles position before losing 7-5
in the second set. Also, the No. 1
doubles team of Craig Cannon
and Roby Mize forced their JMU

matches with Mary Washington
and Virginia.

This weekend the Generals will
host the ODAC tennis champion-
ships as they try to defend their
conference title at the W&L ten-
nis courts. Play will begin on Fri-
day at 9 a.m. with matches from
the first and second rounds of
both singles and doubles. On
Saturday, the consolation round
matches will be played, begin-
ning at 10 a.m. Championship
round play begins at 1 o’clock

The ODAC coaches had not
determined the tournament seed-
ings at press time.

“T think that it will be a two-
team race between Washington
and Lee and Lynchburg,” said
Franke.

A team usually needs to win at
least five of the nine flights in
singles and doubles to acquire
enough points to win the cham-
pionship, Franke said. Franke
believes that everybody on his
team is capable of winning their

flight, but he adds that Lynch-
burg is also capable of winning at
every position.

Franke said that W&L and
Lynchburg are similar teams and
that the team who wants the
championship the most and plays
wellas a team will probably win.

A possible match between W&L
captain and No. 1 singles player
Craig Cannon and Lynchburg’s
Buzz Frey, both of whom will be
vying for All-America status,
could be a major highlight of the
championships. If the two
players meet, it will be in Satur-
day afternoon’s final.

   
    

renfeltz added three hits (two
doubles).

Randy Brown got the loss for
the Generals after relieving
starting pitcher Kirk Breen in the
sixth inning.

W&L defeated homestanding
Bridgewater on Thursday, 5-4,
thanks to a solid pitching perfor-
mance by righthander Breen and
a four-run second inning.

The Generals’ second-inning
explosion came as the result of
freshman Curtiss’ hit, three
walks, a pair of sacrifices and

one Bridgewater error.

WA&L increased its lead to 5-1 in
the seventh after centerfielder
Finkelstein’s home run.
Bridgewater rallied late in the
game, scoring three runs, but fell
one run short.

Breen gave up only one earned

run as three of Bridgewater’s
four runs were unearned.

W&L came. up with its biggest
win of the year Friday by
defeating Lynchburg 11-8 at
Smith Field. The victory was the
Generals’ first over the Hornets,
second in the conference, since
the ODAC was established in
1977.

Freshman lefthander Brown
pitched a good fame after
recovering from a shaky start.
Lynchburg scored six runs in the
first three innings, the big blow
being a grand slam home run,
giving them a 6-5 lead. After the
third inning, Brown surrendered
only two runs.

W&L took the lead for good in
the fourth inning thanks to a
Finkelstein single and _ con-
secutive doubles by Turner, War-
renfeltz and Walsh. Turner had
three hits on the day, as did
catcher Mike Jacoby.

Junior White relieved Brown in
the ninth inning with two men on
base, the tying run at the plate

and no outs. White recorded the
final three outs without allowing
Lynchburg to score.

On Saturday, the Generals split
a doubleheader with Hampden-
Sydney at Farmville. W&L won
the first game 4-3 and lost the
nightcap 10-3.

In the first game, Hampden-
Sydney scored two runs in the
first inning. W&L tied the game
in the second inning and went
ahead 3-2 in the fifth. The Tigers
tied the score in the sixth inning
only to lose the game in the
seventh after Finkelstein came
up with a crucial triple and War-
renfeltz hit a sacrifice fly that
scored the game-winning run.

White (3-1) got the win for the
Generals in the first game.

In the second game, Hampden-
Sydney scored five unearned
runs in the first inning off W&L
starter Peter Detlefs and never
looked back in coasting to a 10-3
victory.

“That was one of the most
satisfying weeks I’ve had as a
baseball coach,” said W&L head
coach Jim Murdock. ‘“‘We came
together as a team, and it could
not have come at a better time.
We are in the middle of our ODAC
schedule and the ODAC cham-
pionships are coming up soon
(May 2-5).”’

“If we eliminate mental
mistakes and big innings, we will
have a very good chance of win-
ning the conference tourna-
ment,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘Our team
goals are still the same as they
were at the beginning of the
season.”’

W&L has several more pivotal
conference games this week. The
Generals will host Catholic in a
double header Saturday (1:30
p.m.) A makeup doubleheader
with Maryville has been ten-
tatively re-scheduled for Sunday
at Smith Field.

Hang gliding: an ‘indescribable dream’

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

Are you looking for something
different to do this spring? If so,
maybe Randy Butler, a W&L
sophomore, can offer you a sug-
gestion: hang gliding. For $20-$80
you can learn to hang glide and
experience what Butler calls ‘‘a
dream.”

Currently Butler is trying to
promote interest in the sport,
which has been somewhat on the
decline nationally.

“Because of diminished in-
terests and a lack of certified
pilots, the United States Hang
Gliding Association is lacking in
funds.’ Butler said, but he is also
quick to mention that the local
chapter, the Roanoke Valley
Hang Gliding Association ‘“‘is
very busy and welcomes new
members.”

Butler started flying last
November and has avidly pur-
sued the sport ever since.

“The feeling I got was, well, in-
describable. I think it speaks for
itself...there you are, 2,000 feet
above the ground and you're fly-
ing. You hold your arms out and
its just like a dream...’ However,
the art of hang gliding is certain-
ly not as easy as strapping a pair
of wings to one’s self and jumping
off a mountainside. There are
many safety precautions and
techniques that must be
mastered.

First, one must be certified by
the U.S.H.G.A. The certificiation
process involves a _ witnessed
demonstration of the techniques
you learn in your first lesson.
After certification, one climbs
through the various skill levels in
the U.S.H.G.A.

As Butler explained, ‘‘Hang I is
the beginning classification, hang
2 the novice, hang 3 intermediate,
hang 4 advanced and hang 5 is
pilot status.”’

Pilot status is very hard to
achieve, for it requires specific

techniques that are closely gaug-
ed by the certification board.
Butler himself has achieved
Hang 2 status, a ranking that re-

-quired many hours of practice.

But Butler adds that the higher
rankings are correspondent with
learned techniques and ex-
perience.

“If you get experienced, you
know to fly into a thermal and let
it take you up,” said Randy. (A
thermal is a pillar of air in which
warm air draws cool air in. The
air pushes up, spreading out as it
gets higher, creating a mush-
room effect.)

“The effect is like that of a bird
circling up — the buzzard isn’t
always circling something dead,
but rather he is allowing this
pocket of air to carry him up.”’

Of course, catching the right
thermal and riding it for a long
period of time is a matter of how
good you are and how lucky you
get.

“I know a guy we fly with in
Roanoke who caught a thermal
and rode for 30 straight miles.
That’s a pretty good ride — but
the longest on record is 241
miles.” If you catch a good,
powerful thermal you can rise up
to 20 feet per second. That’s a
pretty fast rise, but you must
know how to adjust to ensure a
safe flight.

Safety is of major importance
and Butler can offer first-hand
testimony that one must be very
careful in flight.

“One day I was flying near
here and a bunch of my fraternity
brothers were watching. I stalled
out and nosedived. Even though I
was only about 200 feet up, I could
have been dead if I had stalled it
out at, say 50 feet and not been
able to pull out of the dive.”’

According to Butler most in-
juries occur during take-off or
landing. However, he notes that
those interested in learning at
Ronaoke shouldn’t worry about
those dangers because the group

he trains with is very conser-
vative. For safety, most mem-
bers use a hand thrown para-
chute that takes about eight
seconds to become fully
operative, although Butler con-
fesses he isn’t using one at this
point because his hang glider is
not equipped with a harness large
enough for him to carry one.

“Even though I’m not using a
parachute I feel safe with the peo-
ple I’m training with. They are
all good, safety-conscious people
who won’t let you proceed until
you have mastered the tech-
niques on your own level,’’ Butler
said.

Butler is eager to add that it is
very easy to learn to hang glide.
There are a few basic instruc-

tions, like pulling the bar toward
yourself to go down and pushing
away to climb, but these are all
learned in the first lesson. You
even get to fly on your first lesson
— even though it’ll only be at an
altitude of about 30 feet.

“Really, flying here in Virginia
is about a 9 month season. The on-
ly rough time is during the sum-
mer months when the air is hot
and dry. But compared to a state
like Colorado, in which conditions
only warrant a 1-3 month season,
there are plenty of opportunities
to fly.”’

The R.V.N.G.A. takes weekend
trips and some weekday excur-
sions to various mountains
around the Roanoke area. Some
trips even carry the group to

places like Pennsylvania, where
the group competes in cross coun-
try races. Whatever the case, a
good time is guaranteed for the
bold adventurer who steps for-
ward to try the sport.

“Like I said, the feeling is in-
describable. Just picture yourself
2,000 feet above the Blue Ridge
Parkway and I think you'll see
what I mean.”

What Randy Butler really
wants is for people to step for-
ward and try the sport. With inex-
pensifve lessons with profes-
sional instruction just 45 minutes
down the road, he’s hoping the
sphere of influence of hang
= will spread to Lexington,

Golfers take third in ODACs

By MIKE HASSINGER
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee golf
team finished third behind
Lynchburg College and
Randolph-Macon College in the
seven-team field this week at the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference tournament.

Coach Buck Leslie said he was
disappointed with the team’s per-
formance and, while saying he
wasn’t making excuses for his
team’s poor performance, cited
several factors that hindered
their play. The weather was win-
dy, Leslie said, which made the
already difficult course even
tougher, and, more importantly,
the W&L academic calendar is
structured so that the team lost
two weeks of competitive play.
Leslie said this break in the mid-
dle of the season makes his goal
of consistency difficult to
achieve.

“‘The calendar caused us to lose
two weeks of prime playing
time,” Leslie added. ‘“‘We just
need to play more, and regularly,
to be consistent.”

Leslie cited several individual
bright spots in the midst of the
Generals’ defeat. Bruce Blythe
and Turner Friedman shot 155
each for the two-round event 36-
hole event and made the all-
conference team.

Friedman “‘saved us from total

Freshman Mike Friedman

Whit Kelly was hampered by ill-
ness and did not play as strongly
as usual.

By winning the tournament,
Lynchburg has tied Washington

with three tournament titles. The
Generals season will conclude

with a make-up match against
Bluefield College in May. This
match was postponed due to bad
weather, which also took com-
petitive play time from the
Generals.

Although the match will have
no effect on the season’s stand-
ings, Leslie hopes for a win. ‘‘We
just didn’t play as strongly as we
could have (at the ODAC tourna-
ment), and I’d like to see us (beat

Law ’86 claims
IM basketball crown

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

It was a case of height vs.
quickness in Tuesday’s in-
tramural basketball champion-
ship game, and this time Law
’86’s height was a little too much
for Phi Delta Theta’s quickness
in the First Year’s 56-44 victory.

The Phi Delt squad made up for
their height disadvantage with
some scrappy rebounding and
quick-handed defense, coupled
with some stellar outside
shooting from Paul James, who
totaled 22 points on the night.

leaders who dumped in 18 points
apiece from long and short range
and scored the first five baskets.
James, however, cut the lead to
four with his jumper at 14-10, but
Law I, getting help from the
resurgent Paul Ware, ran off six
unanswered points to lead 20-10.

Phi Delt returned the favor
with a 10-4 spurt of their own
from James and freshman Roby
Mize, cutting the Law lead to four
at 24-20. Law ’86 held on to the
28-22 lead at the half.

PDT was quick off the blocks to
start the second half, using a cou-
ple of ‘‘Oh wow!” field goals from
Mize and James to knot the game
at 28.

Law ’86 regrouped following a
time out and proceeded to take
command of the game with a 22-9
surge midway through, giving
them an insurmountable 50-39
lead.

Copping most valuable player
honors were Kelly and Carr. Kel-
ly was a four-year standout at
Hampden-Sydney as an under-
graduate, while Carr was a
member of U.Va.’s '76-77 Atlantic
Coast Conference championship
team.

polls. ‘‘Given the resources the
EC had and what they wanted to
accomplish, I think they went
about their business relatively
well,” he said.

The sociology survey found
that although a majority of the
undergraduates are opposed to
enrolling women, 62 percent of
the respondents agreed that
‘‘coeducation would be in the best
interests of W&L with regard to
attracting academically quali-
fied students.”

“The big difference is that the
faculty has a much greater
tendency to personally prefer

coeducation than the students do,
but there’s not that much of a gap
when they consider the best in-
terest of the university,’’ the pro-
fessor said.

Novack said the data show that
year in school and major appear
to have little effect on a student’s
view on the coeducation question.

Sixty-nine percent of students
from the South opposed admit-
ting women. Sixty-three percent
of fraternity members were
against coeducation, while 58 per-
cent of non-fraternity members
favored it.

Two-thirds of both faculty and
students agreed that the adoption
of coeducation is likely in the
near future. Fourteen faculty
members said they would not re-

main at W&L if it were maintain-
ed as an all-male institution.

Students and faculty disagreed
markedly in their assessments of
the effect of coeducation on the
social environment at W&L.

Eighty-one percent of the
students said the change would
harm the fraternity system (32
percent characterized it as
‘‘great’’ harm), while only 29 per-
cent of the faculty took that posi-
tion.

Two-thirds of students said the
adoption of coeducation would
result in more restrictions on stu-
dent life, while only a quarter of
the faculty agreed with that view.

As advantages of coeducation,
students frequently listed in-
creased academic standards, a

tative centered around whether
that position would become effec-
tive for next year or the following
year. Third-year law student,
Gordon Hammock, has already
been elected upperclass law
representative to represent the
second- and third-year law
classes. A freshman law
representative is elected in the
fall.

Hammock was the only rising
third-year student on the ballot;
his challengers all were rising
second-year law students.

A proviso to the amendment
calls for Hammock to be declared
the third-year representative and
for a second-year representative
to be elected in the fall, if the
amendment passes.

Another Law School EC repre-
sentative “exactly answers the
demands of the law students,”
Sicilian said after the meeting.

First-year law representative
Steve Grist pointed out that the
amendment would require a lot of
effort on the part of the EC to be
passed. ‘Everybody on this com-
mittee is going to have to be
behind it,” Grist said. “If the
committee doesn’t take an active
role in it, the apathy is going to
continue.’’

Before leaving the meeting,
after the amendment had been
passed, Wrenn said, ‘I’m fairly

tional amendment will ever pass.

autonomy, law students also last
week voted against another
referendum calling for the Law
School student government to
“investigate and adjudicate”
honor offenses involving law
students.

“TI felt that was exactly how it
would turn out,” Sicilian said. ‘‘I
felt strongest about (the fiscal
referendum)...[ was hesitant
about wanting to split the honor
system.”

Sicilian, who will head the SBA
delegation to meet with the four
EC members, said he expected to
begin meeting by tomorrow.

‘“‘As much as people think this
is pulling the school apart, it real-

A third proposed change in the
system is that the accused in a
closed honor trial should be
allowed to make an opening
Statement, Messer reported. A
closed trial now begins with the
giving of testimony, and the ac-
cused has no right to an opening
statement, said Messer.

Feldman said he was the only
member of the committee to op-
pose the right of the defendant to
an opening statement. Feldman
said if the defendant is allowed to
make an opening statement the
strength of the opening statement
would play too large a-role in the
outcome of the trial.

“You let the accused define
what facts are relevant,’
Feldman said. ““You make your
evaluation of a person in the first
five minutes after you meet him.
I think you will judge him then,”
concluded Feldman.

Feldman also said that the
committee is recommending a
better orientation program in the
honor system for freshmen and
first-year law students. Feldman
added that it was important that
upperclassmen be made aware of
the changes in the honor code
because ignorance is not an ex-
cuse for an honor violation.

Messer said that in general he
was pleased with the committee’s
work and considered the
presence of four law students on
the committee to have been par-
ticularly helpful. Although he
said the law students and
undergraduates frequently
agreed, Messer said he felt the
law students added a viewpoint to
the discussions that under-
graduates do not typically hear.

Feldman said he felt the pro-
cess was good, but he would have
preferred to have more non-EC
members on the committee.
Three EC members are on the
committee.

‘Since the EC as a whole has to
vote on the changes, I think you
get more impact if you have more
non-EC members and law stu-
dents,’’ said Feldman.

Although Feldman said he
disapproved of some of the pro-
posed changes and probably
would speak out against them, he
added that most of the changes
will improve the system.

“This should be an ongoing
dynamic honor system and not a
static one,” argued Feldman.

Reap said he, too, was satisfied
with the process. Reap described
the process as a_ balancing
system between the need to
tighten the system and the need
to preserve the rights of the ac-
cused.

“I’m very happy with the com-
mittee for this reason. People
were open to possibilities, and
there was a lot of good discus-
sion,”’ Reap said.

‘Although the system’s not
perfect, as long as we keep
reviewing it and keep balancing
the needs of the accused and the
need for maintaining an effective
honor system, I think that stick-
ing with the system will prove

beneficial to W&L,’’ Reap
asserted.
Law students on the committee

are Reap, Jill Faustini, Thomas
Lisk and Steve Grist. Under-
graduates on the committee are
Feldman, Messer, Cole Dawson,
James White and Chris Carter.
