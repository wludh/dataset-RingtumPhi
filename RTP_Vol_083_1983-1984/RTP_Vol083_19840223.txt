Lexington, Virginia,

John W. Elrod, chairman of
the department of philosophy at
Iowa State University in Ames,
Iowa, has been named Dean of
the College at Washington and
Lee, effective Aug. 1.

He will succeed William J.
Watt, who announced last
spring that he would be leaving
the post he has held since 1971.

After a year’s leave of
absence, Watt will return full-
time in the fall of 1985 as a
chemistry professor. While he
was dean he taught one course
inthat department.

Elrod, 44, was chosen from
among 200 candidates who were
screened by a nine-member
dean search committee headed
by President John D. Wilson

He is a recognized authority
on the 19th century Danish
religious philosopher Soren
Aabye Kierkegaard and has

Read’s drug probe raises questions

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

At least 13 Washington and Lee students
have been subpoenaed by the special grand
jury investigating drug trafficking in Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

Several of the students were scheduled to
testify this morning at the 16th session of the
panel, which has become the focus of increas-
ing local controversy.

The special grand jury was impaneled Oct.
24 by Circuit Court Judge George E. Honts III
at the request of Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John” Read.

It cannot issue indictments, but instead can
make recommendations to the regular grand
jury through Read.

W&L Dean of Students Lewis G. John said
he’s ‘‘talked with a number of students
who’ ve expressed a variety of concerns about
the investigation.

‘It’s not only students who are expressing
concern about it, but also others in the com-
munity,” he said.

Dean John said he is uncertain exactly what
effect the special grand jury has had on drug

use at Washington and Lee.

‘‘Kither the use and sale of drugs is not so
widespread as it was, or it has been driven
underground. I sense that one of the two is oc-
curring,’’ he said.

‘Some students have told me that they feel
there is significantly less use than there was a
year ago, and that’s primarily because of the
investigation,’ he continued.

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce Patterson said
that the regular grand jury is next scheduled
to meet on May 7.

‘‘T’m not sure, but I think they plan on being
through before the next grand jury meeting,”’
Patterson said.

A special grand jury normally operates for
a maximum of six months, but state law pro-
vides that the court may make an extension if
it ‘‘determines that the special grand jury i
making progress in its investigation.”’

‘‘Any extension has to be justified,’’ Judge
Honts said. ‘If they present such justifica-
tion, and it is in the best interest of the com-
munity to extend it, then I would doso.”’

The nine jurors have heard testimony from
at least 121 witnesses. In addition, a number
of juveniles have been called. Their names

were not released.

Read said he is continuing his policy of not
commenting on any aspect of the investiga-
tion until it is completed.

In interviews, many local lawyers express-
ed disagreement with the tactics and scope of
the investigation.

‘‘T’ve heard a number of complaints from
attorneys,”’ said J. Todd Jones, president of
the Lexington-Buena Vista Bar Association.

A lawyer who asked not to be identified con-
firmed that he and 13 other local attorneys
met at the Green Valley Restaurant outside
Lexington on Feb. 9 and discussed the in-
vestigation.

Jones would not comment on whether he at-
tended the meeting.

He said that the bar association had taken
no official action, and that no formal action
had been requested.

“I think the system is being abused,”’ said
James T. Adams, a lawyer who ran against
Read for Commonwealth’s Attorney last
year.

“In a grand jury situation, you can ask
questions you couldn't ask in a courtroom

Successor to Watt
named by trustees

had two books on that subject
published by the Princeton
University Press.

The dean-elect was unavaila-
ble for an interview this week.

Last February at Washington
and Lee, Elrod presented a
series of lectures for the depart-
ment of religion.

One of the presentations was
called ‘Einstein and God,” an
examination of Albert Eins
tein’s scientific and religious
ideas, which Elrod developed in
conjunction with an Iowa State
physicist

Watt met Elrod when he was
in Lexington last year

“T thought he was very nice
and I enjoyed meeting his wife
as well,”’ Watt said.

‘‘He seemed like a person wh«
would be very easy to get along
with. He seemed quite friendly
and very open. I enjoyed
meeting him.’

Watt said he decided to give
up his office because he’d been
in it so long. ‘I’ve been here 12
years — you can’t last forever,”
he said.

He also said that this was a
good time for a change because
there is a new president. He
said he had been in office for a
year and a half transition peri-
od, and now it was possible
for President Wilson to bring in
a new dean of the college.

Referring to their respective
specialties, Watt said he’d told
Elrod that in his office ‘there
are chemical problems and
there are philosophical pro-
blems — I’ll leave you all the
philosophical ones.”

Elrod, a native of Griffin,
Ga., studied at Presbyterian
College before getting his
master’s and doctorate degrees
from Columbia University.

He was a lecturer in the
philosophy of religion at Union
Theological Seminary in New
York before joining the lowa
State University philosophy
department in 1971

Review and Outlook

 

‘Yes’ for open exams

After what seemed to be an interminable number of
delays, the Faculty Executive Committee finally ap-
proved the long-awaited open exam policy this week.
If the faculty as a whole approves the proposal March
5, students will be free from the constraints of having
to inform their professors when they intend to take
theirexams. |

One of this university’s major attractions is its
honor system founded in the traditions of Robert E.
Lee. The fact that students already can choose par-
ticular times to take exams is a convenient feature of
our honor system.

Under the proposal passed by the Faculty EC,
students can take their exams at either 9 a.m. or 2
p.m. any day of the exam week. They do not need to
indicate an exam time on their envelopes, although
they must turn in envelopes to the professors with just
their name and course on them.

While this would, indeed, make things easier for
students, there are other benefits.

The exam procedure would be standardized
throughout the school. Many religion students
already operate under the open exam rules. In the
Commerce School, though, students usually have dif-
ficulty changing the time of their exam once they’ve
turned in their envelopes.

Most other departments fall somewhere between
the two extremes, creating nothing but confusion.

The open exam policy would alleviate most of that
confusion, and the student Executive Committee’s
volunteering of student help to distribute exams in the
Commerce School and the history department should
qualm any fears faculty may have about the pro-
posal’s creating too much work for secretaries or pro-
fessors.

The faculty recently has been accused of not follow-
ing the wishes of the student body. It will have the op-
portunity a week from Monday to stem that tide of
criticism while at the same time broadening the ap-
plication of our honor system.

Tie issue : distraction from introspection

To the Editors:

Congratulations, gentlemen,
you’ve made national news
again. While driving through
Washington today, a radio com-
mentator’s lead line caught my
attention. For a_ nationally
disseminated network feature,
he began by suggesting that a
rebellion was near critical mass
at one of America’s colleges.
Somehow I guessed that W&L
was to be named, so I listened
closely through three adver-
tisements, distressed that our
coeducation crises was about to
be aired to the nation.

But no — it was an impending
riot concerning the wearing of
coats and ties at that same
venerable institution that had
the broadcaster agog. He also
found piquant a seeming role
reversal — students wishing a

. dress code while an unnamed

faculty member snorted,
‘‘Medieval!”’ The commentator
was pro, suggesting that dress-
ing like gentlemen would en-
courage acting like gentlemen.
The wording reminded me of
Saint Bob’s profundity, “‘We
have but one rule here...” I was

also interested because my
time in Lexington was also one
of relative upheaval. While we
were not exactly a hotbed of
SDS activity, classes were
disrupted. However, I recall
that even then, and even the
most intensely committed,
Washington and Lee students
were judicious in attempting to
influence their peers. Everyone
seemed to realize that no strike,
no picket line could reasonably
be expected to delay those of us
who, for example, had to get to
Organic lab. Keith Shillington
awaited with tech points in
hand; the age of Aquarius
would simply have to defer
dawning.

Imposing our own ideas of
propriety on others can be tir-
ing and time consuming, but it
provides a wonderful distrac-
tion from introspection. When
resisted, should not he who
seeks to control ask if the
necessity is so great, if the
result is so desirable, as to war-
rant even a little lessening of
liberty or free expression.

I hope all the combatants in
this great clash of principles
can enjoy the conflict, bemused
by the realization that none of it
will matter a whit in five or ten
years, regardless. Now coedu-
cation, on the other hand...

Hugh F. Hill III
Class of 1971

CPR course to be offered

To the Editors:

Once again our Athletic
Department in conjunction with
the American Red Cross will
sponsor a module CPR Course
available for administration,
faculty, staff, and students.
Classes will be conducted from
7 to 9 p.m. Monday through

Ties, ties, ties, more ties

To the Editors:

I was outraged to hear of the
Executive Committee’s vote to
ask the faculty to require
students to wear ‘respectable
clothes, including ties,” to
classes. The whole idea is
ludicrous. We pay almost
$10,000 a year to come here to

learn, not to be subjected to pet-
ty regulations affecting our ap-
pearance. I had to wear a coat
and tie for school since sixth
grade, and I looked forward to
college and its intellectual pur-
suits which were free of such
petty rules.

That's not the most important
point, though. The EC is suppos-
ed to be a representative body.

Yet the student body was never
consulted on the matter of dress
and appearance. Also, isn’t the
issue of the open exam policy
more important than how we
look? I find it hard to believe
that the EC can vote on clothing
regulations, yet continued to
delay its decision on the open
exam policy which is one of the
most important aspects of our
honor system.

The Executive Committee
seems to have forgotten that
Washington and Lee is a univer-
sity, not a finishing school. We
are here to learn to think for
ourselves, not to have our way
of life dictated tous.

Tothe Editors;

Please extend my congratula-
tions to your staff for the infor-
mative and balanced series of
articles on VMI, my alma
mater, in your recent issue of

In reading in the same issue

Faculty EC approves open exam proposal

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Faculty Executive Com-
mittee approved the proposed
open exam policy 8-2 Monday,
junior representative Cole
Dawson reported at Monday
evening’s. Student Executive
Committee meeting.

The faculty as a whole will
debate the proposal and pro-
bably vote on it at its regular
meeting March 5. If approved
the open exam proposal would
go into effect for this semester’s
exams.

As approved by the Faculty
EC, the open exam policy would
allow a student to take an exam
at any time during the final
week of the term. The student
would not have to decide in ad-
vance when he would take his
exam.

The student EC must supply
three students to help distribute
exams in the Commerce School

Mock Con

Robb, Sen.

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention
Correspondent

The ‘“‘call for delegates” of-
ficially has been made by the
organizers of Washington and
Lee’s Mock Democratic Con-
vention and 24 state delegations
‘still have openings.

Nearly the . entire
undergraduate student body
will be needed to participate as
delegates during the convention
to be held May 11 and 12.

The Mock Convention staff

held Delegate Sign-up Night

Jan. 23, in Evans Dining Hall .

with a rather low student turn-
out. The chairmen of the 50
state delegations recruited
students for their delegations
and answered any questions
students might have.

Pete Muller, Mock Conven-
tion co-chairman, said students
will be given another opportuni-
ty to sign-up “in the near
future.’”” Anyone who hasn’t
joined a delegation can leave

and one or two for the history
department. These students
would be appointed from among
all elected student officers.

-The EC also announced that
petitions for candidates for the
Big Three — president, vice
president and secretary — are
due in the EC room Monday at 7
p.m.

A forum among the can-
didates is scheduled Wednes-
day, Feb. 29, at 4 p.m. in Room
327 of the Commerce School and
elections will be the following
Monday, March5.

Also Monday night, the EC
debated, but took no action on,
whether to continue to support
using student body funds for
construction of the student ac-
tivities pavilion in light of a re-
cent vote by the House of
Delegates of the Virginia
General Assembly to raise the
drinking age to21.

To become law, that proposal
still must be approved by the

Virginia Senate.

‘Burford Smith, co-chairman
of the Student Activities Board,
and John Haywood, treasurer,
said raising the drinking age
wouldn’t hurt pavilion func-
tions.

“It would make the use of the
building more attractive and
probably a little more often
because everyone would be in
the same situation,’ Smith
said.

Haywood warned, though,
that if the bill passed, no beer
would be sold at the pavilion.
Because of problems with li-
censing and with getting
students over 21 to serve the
beer, ‘‘we cannot provide beer
for a handful of students and
control it,’” Haywood said.

“] think trying to second-
guess the government just belit-
tles the whole idea of the
pavilion,” freshman represen-
tative Andrew Caruthers said.

The EC did approve an expen-

delegate slots open;
Randolph to speak

his name at the Mock Conven-
tion office in the University
Center, he added.

The primary responsibilities
of a delegate will fall on the
weekend of the convention,
Muller said. Delegates con-
struct their state’s float for the
convention parade and are ex-
pected to be present at all ses-
sions of the convention.

Pending faculty approval,
classes will be canceled on the
opening day of the Mock Con-
vention, Friday, May 11, in
order to allow students to view
the parade and participate in
the opening session.

In addition, delegates are
responsible for keeping inform-
ed of major campaign develop-
ments in their states. Delegates
also will have the opportunity to
participate in various social
events sponsored by their state
prior to the convention.

“Each delegate can have as
much initiative as he wants or
as little initiative as he wants,”’
Muller said. During the conven-

Public hearing tomorrow
on proposed beer bill

A committee of the Virginia
Senate has scheduied a public
hearing tomorrow morning to
debate whether the legal age for
buying beer should be raised
from 19 to21.

The Virginia House of
Delegates approved the bill,
sponsored by Del. Frank D.
Hargrove, R-Hanover, Feb. 14
by a 58-39 vote.

The Senate Rehabilitation
and Social Services Committee
will consider the bill at 9 a.m.
tomorrow, according to a clerk

for the committee.

The Senate Courts and
Justice Committee rejected a
similar bill 10-7 last month.

As passed by the House, the
bill contains a “grandfather
clause’’ that would allow people
who have turned 19 by July 1 to
continue to buy beer.

The House of Delegates pass-
ed a similar bill last year but
had to settle for only raising the
age for purchasing beer to 19
from 18 when the Senate balked
at raising the age to 21.

uon sessions, he said, a del-
egate’s activity can range from
giving input to the platform
debate to discussing ideological
preferences within his delega-
tion in choosing a nominee.

“The delegates compose the
foundation of decision-making,
which ultimately leads to the
correct presidential nominee,”
Muller said.

In related Mock Convention
news, two speakers have been
announced.

Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-
W.Va., will deliver the platform
address, which will be followed
by the platform debate May 11.

Randolph was first elected to
the House of Representatives in

1932 with the Franklin Roose-

velt administration. Defeated
in 1946, he entered the private
sector and then was elected to
the Senate in 1958. He is
presently the ranking minority
member of the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Com-
mittee and a member of the
Labor and Human Resources
Committee and the Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs.

During his 40-year career
as a legislator, Randolph
has been a champion of a
nationwide _ transportation
system and the rights of the
handicapped. The 81-year-old
Randolph announced his retire-
ment from the Senate last year.

Virginia Governor Charles S.
Robb will deliver the introduc-
tory address to the Mock Con-
vention. Robb, who received his
law degree in 1973 from the
University of Virginia, served
as Lieutenant Governor of
Virginia from 1977 to 1981.

W&L President John D.
Wilson and Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips, an economics
professor, will also be address-
ing the convention.

IFC approves

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

The Interfraternity Council
recently unanimously approved
a 1984-85 budget of over $18,000,
and IFC President Emery Ell-
inger said no major changes
were made as compared to last
year’s appropriations.

The largest allotment of the
budget, drafted by IFC
treasurer Willie Wilson, went to
Contact ’84, which received
$7,500 the same amount it
received last year. Never-
theless, Ellinger expressed his
disappointment that Contact
did not publicize the fact that it
is sponsored by the IFC as well
as the Executive Committee.

“The budget was, overall,
non-controversial other than
that Contact part,” Ellinger
said.

In addition to the Contact ap-
propriation, $5,650 was set aside
to pay for the room and board of
two exchange students spon-
sored by the IFC. Although one
of these students plans to
graduate at the end of this
school year, Ellinger said a new
exchange student would be
recruited.

Other expenditures noted in
the budget include $1,663 for a
Rush book, $2,500 for a fraterni-
ty spring weekend and $700 for
miscellaneous expenses, in-
cluding donations to charities
and payments to workers for
picking up trash near frater-
‘nities, Ellinger said.

$100 loan

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

A $100 loan was returned
unused to the Washington and
Lee Executive Committee Mon-
day night by junior Ed But-
tarazzi. The loan, meant to help
finance a Booster Club, was to
have been repaid March 5.

According to Buttarazzi, the
project was stopped because of
a lack of expected support from
would-be supporters. The $100
was to have financed a mailing

$18,000 budget

Ellinger noted that the IFC
sponsored the annual Christ-
mas parade in Lexington last
December, paid for one of the
bands that performed at the
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance and plans to donate near-
ly $350 to the World Hunger
Organization.

Ellinger added that some of
the miscellaneous expenses are
used in the day-to-day operation
of the IFC and that any money
left over from the budget would
be donated to charitable
organizations.

According to the budget
report, the IFC expects to earn

$4,950 from the students who
pay the $15 fee to participate in

Rush activities. In addition, Ell-
inger said, the IFC should ob-
tain about $600 from fraternities

fined for misconduct.

Overall, the IFC needs to
raise $12,463 to break even.
Each fraternity member thus is
required to pay about $15 of the
IFC budget. These payments
are collected by the respective
fraternities. The first payment
is due at the end of March, with
the other due in late April.

In other fraternity news, elec-
tions for IFC President and
Vice president will be held
March 5. Nominations for the
senior and junior justices,
treasurer, secretary and Rush
book chairman will be accepted
at the IFC meeting Feb. 28 at 7
p.m.

returned

to alumni, which Buttarazzi
hoped would generate income.
This, in turn, would have been
used to repay the loan and spon-
sor publicity of university ac-
tivities, so some might not have
considered it a true booster
club.

“It (the name - Booster Club)
was a name for lack of a better
name,” said Buttarazzi, who
does not foresee making
another attempt at the project
in the near future.

Poll shows 1983 grads doing well

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Only 6.4 percent of
Washington and Lee’s Class of
1983 that participated in a re-
cent poll had not entered
graduate school or found a job
by October, according to a
report prepared by the place-
ment office.

The report is based on the
returns from a questionnaire
mailed to all 276 members of the
Class of 1983 who graduated in
June. More than 82 percent of
the 1983 graduates responded to
the survey.

The report notes that 31.2 per-
cent of the W&L graduates went
on to graduate or professional
school, and 60.6 percent found
jobs. Most of those graduates
_who remained unemployed in

~ October indicated that they had
just recently begun to look for a
job, the report said.

“It is concluded from this
finding that unemployement af-
fects only an_ insignificant
number of recent W&L stu-
dents.

“I am now seeing a high de-
mand in almost every forsee-
able job market,” Cappetto
said.

Not only did the 1983 W&L
graduates do fairly well in ob-

taining jobs, but the survey in-

 

   

dicates that most graduates
found jobs that satisfied them.

Almost 88 percent of the
respondents said that their jobs
required a college degree. In
1980, 92 percent of the graduates
reported that their jobs re-
quired a college diploma.

In addition, 85.7 percent of the
respondents said they were
satisfied with the type of work
they were doing, and 77 percent
of the respondents said their job
was consistent with their long-
term career goals.

Graduates in the humanities
had the lowest percentage — 70
percent — of individuals who
believed their job required a
college degree. In 1980,
however, more than 92 percent
of humanities graduates said
their job required a college
degree.

“‘It goes up and down, but I’m
not discouraged by that,” Cap-
petto said.

Cappetto said some of the
people who reported that their
job did not require a college
education, based on the job’s
challenge, probably would not
have gotten the job if they did
not have a college degree.

Merchandising and sales was
the most popular occupation
among 1983 W&L graduates, ac-

cording to the report. Banking |

and finance, real estate and the

military were also popular
career choices for 1983 W&L
graduates.

Occupations that saw major
declines in popularity among
W&L graduates were educa-
tion, government work and
social work and counseling.

Starting salaries for 1983
W&L graduates tended to be
below the national mean
salaries for 1983 graduates, the
report indicated. The median
salary of the 1983 W&L
graduates was $15,000-$16,999,
according to the report.

Business graduates had the
highest median salaries and
journalism and humanities
graduates had the lowest me-
dian salaries.

A possible explanation of the
below average starting salaries
for W&L graduates is that many
W&L students took jobs in the
Southeast, Cappetto said.
Salaries tend to be higher on
average in the Northeast
because the cost of living also is
higher, asserted Cappetto.

Cappetto emphasized that
salary should not be the only
factor a student considers when
looking for a job. People should
find jobs they enjoy, Cappetto
said.

“T would never want a W&L
student to pick a major because
he thinks it’s marketable. Find

work that you regard as en-
joyable,” said Cappetto.

Of the more than 30 percent of
W&L graduates who went on to
graduate work, the most
noticeable decline was among
students going to law school.
Only 11.5 percent of 1983 W&L
graduates, the lowest percent-
age for any year that data was
collected, went to law school.
Fourteen percent of 1980 W&L
graduates went to law school.

“For many years a bright stu-
dent from W&L found it easier
to get into grad school than it
was to get a job. The job market
is improving, and it’s not easier
to get into grad school than it is
to get a job,” Cappetto said.

This year, however, Cappetto
said law schools are reporting a
20-30 percent drop in applica-
tions nationally.

“It’s going to be much easier
to get into law or business
schools. The message to
everyone who is applying to
graduate school is that you
should apply to at least one
place you think is over your
head,”’ advised Capetto.

While law school applicants
from W&L declined in 1983, the
number of W&L graduates go-
ing to medical school increased.
Seven percent of W&L gradu-
ates went to medical school in
1983 as compared to 3 percent of
1980 graduates.

An additional 3 percent of
W&L graduates in 1983 went to
business school and the remain-
ing 8 percent went into a variety
of graduate programs ranging
from aviation to nuclear
engineering.

Former student convicted

A former Washington and Lee
student was found guilty of
possession of cocaine Feb. 6 in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court and was given a suspend-
ed five-year sentence.

Charles M. Phillips, of Mont-
clair, N.J., pleaded guilty to the
charge, which was placed Feb.
4, 1983, after 27.88 grams of co-
caine were found in his posse-
sion.

WGL

According to evidence
presented by Virginia State
Trooper Wayne Oyler, the co-
caine discovered was 33 percent

pure.

Phillips withdrew from the
University following the 1982-83
academic year.

Circuit Court Judge George
A. Honts III heard the evidence
and pronounced both the ver-
dict and the sentence.

Footloose ain ’t Flashdance

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

Question? What is the first
thing you think of when you
hear the word ‘Footloose?’
“Flashdance,” right? Well so
much for word association
because that is about all the two
movies have incommon.

Yes, ‘Footloose’ does have
the obligatory dance numbers
that are as slickly choreograph-
ed and performed as those in
‘“‘Flashdance’” but did you ever
give a serious thought as to the
validity of a female-steelworker
turned stripper in Pittsburgh?
No, neither did I, but it sure
looked good.

The problem with ‘“Foot-
loose’’ is that it tried too hard.
Tackling real problematic
themes such as why people
can’t dance in the corn belt and
whether- ‘Slaughterhouse
Five’’ is a classic in Beaumont,
Iowa. It’s the kind of stuff that
Jerry Falwell could work up a
sweat over, but it left most
wishing that they would just put
on their dancing shoes.

There are, however, some
fine performances by a cast
which is shackled by a screen-
play that might enthrall a
sociologist but left much of the
’ audience trudging up for pop-
corn during the lengthy breaks
in action.

Ren (Kevin Bacon) is the
rebel with a cause. Bacon car-
ries off this Chicago punk
routine well and gets great sup-
port from his redneck pal
Willard (Christopher Penn)
who turns out to be the Michael
Jackson of the International

Harvester set.

The femme fatale is a
preacher’s daughter who is
leaning more toward the devil.
Ariel (Lori Singer) is a tempt-
ing young lass and Miss Singer
fits the character mold like the
skin tight denims she wears.
The Rev. Shaw Moore (John
Lithgow) rants and raves
against the heathen disco infer-
no that threatens to turn his
Sunday services into Dance

Fever, but his is no match for
the all powerful ‘‘movie sound-
track” (hail, oh great Kenny
Loggins) At least the Reverend
was a good sport.

So, my advice to the W&L
moviegoer: Go on and see the
movie. You could do much
worse, just don’t expect to find
yourself jumping to break
dance in the aisles when the
credits roll up.

Choosing among

Lex ’s finest fowl

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

Before discussing what Lex-
ington has to offer in the way of
fried chicken to go I’m going to
take a second to explain the pur-
pose of this new column, the Eat
Beat. (Credit for the name Eat
Beat goes to consultant and

ee
Eat Beat

fellow chow hound, Doug
Teague). Pure and simple, it’s a
consumer guide, and, if I do my
job and you pay attention, then
just maybe you can avoid some
of the needless mistakes which
too often befall the consumer
who, with a couple of bucks in
his pocket and an empty
stomach, is hungry for some-
thing but he doesn’t know exact-
ly what for. This column is aim-
ed especially at late Sunday

afternoons; that time beginning
just after the sports ends and
before the Sunday might movie
begins. Too often there is
hesitation and the next thing
you know the movie’s on so you
settle for dialing the inevitable
7375 for Domino’s. But if you
make your move quickly and
smartly, you can add variety to
your eating life without cussing
yourself after it’s too late
because you wasted your Sun-
day dinner on basic Domino’s
filler.

So where in Lexington do you
go if you have a craving for
fried chicken, and you don’t
have time to drive all the way to
Westmorelands, or spend 30
minutes and six bucks in a
restaurant? You have four
choices: Kentucky Fried
Chicken, Kenney’s, Kroger and
Safeway. Unfortunately,
neither of these places offers a
truly transcendental fried
chicken eating experience, the

‘Scenes from a Marriage’
to be screened this weekend

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present ‘Scenes
from a Marriage’ (Sweden,
1974), directed by Ingmar
Bergman, at 8 p.m. on Friday,
Feb. 24 and Saturday, Feb. 25.
Showings will be in Classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall in the W&L
Law School. There is no charge
for admission and the public is
invited. The film is in Swedish,
with English subtitles.

Director Bergman is, of
course, one of the greatest film
makers of all time. His films
have dealt powerfully with per-
sonal, introspective themes
—loneliness, alienation, psycho-
sexuality, family relationships.
Though “Scenes from a Mar-
riage” continues Bergman’s in-
terest in intimate themes, the

film is something of a stylistic
departure from most of his
earlier works; utilizing an
unusually straightforward and
explicit manner, the film
reflects its origins as a Swedish
television series.

“Scenes from a Marriage’
does not have a particularly ex-
traordinary plot or theme; the
film explores the relationship
between a husband and his wife.
However, it has been hailed for
its unusual frankness, in-
telligence and sensitivity in
dealing with the very intimate
events which may color a rela-
tionship. Critic Roger Ebert has
described ‘“‘Scenes” as ‘one of
the truest, most luminous love
stories ever made, an almost
heart-breaking masterpiece.”’

Cagers fall in first round

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
basketball team lost three of its
last four regular-season games,
then suffered a 65-60 overtime
loss to Lynchburg College Tues-
day night in the opening round
of the ODAC tournament at
Warner Center.

The Generals began the week
of February break by losing at
Roanoke College, 66-62, Satur-
day night. Senior forward John
Lee Graves led the Generals
with 24 points.

Tuesday night W&L traveled
to Eastern Mennonite College to
face a team that finished
seventh out of nine teams in the
ODAC and that the Generals

to Maryville College, a team
they had beaten by 13 points
here earlier in the season, and
lost by eight points, 72-64, for
their third straight road defeat.
Junior forward Scott Shannon,
the team’s second-leading re-
bounder and third-leading
scorer, injured his ankle and
missed the last ten minutes of
the game.

Finally, the team traveled to
Hampden-Sydney for the final
regular-season game. Playing
without Shannon, the Generals
were victorious, 55-48.

The difference in_ the
Hampden-Sydney game was
that the Generals played
defense as they were supposed
to, said head coach Verne Can-
field.

final regular-season record of
14-11 overall and 9-7 in the con-
ference. Catholic and Lynch-
burg both also had 9-7 ODAC
records. The tie-breaking pro-
cedure placed Catholic third,
W&L fourth and Lynchburg
fifth, which meant that the
Generals would host Lynchburg
Tuesday night in the quarter-
final round of the tournament.

W&L beat Lynchburg, 46-45,
in the teams’ first meeting on
Jan. 21 but lost, 67-59, when the
Hornets came to Lexington
Feb.4.

The Generals opened the
game with the spark that seems
to have been lacking in some of
their recent games. Starting off

with 10 unanswered points, the
Generals built their lead to 24-10
with 10 minutes left in the first
half on 10 of 16 shooting.

Then they fell apart. W&L
managed only three points (a
three-point play by Kevin Mc-
Clatchey) in the last 10 minutes
of the half, while shooting one
for five from the floor and com-
mitting five turnovers.

The Hornets took advantage
of W&L’s collapse by making 7
of 10 field goals and tying the
game at halftime, 27-27. -

The second half was fairly
even, as reflected in the score at
the end of it: 49-49. The Hornets
shot 46 percent from the floor
(11 of 24) to the Generals 42 per-

cent (13 of 31).

In the overtime period W&L
fell apart again. Lynchburg
took a 51-50 lead, then went ona
7-0 spurt.

At the end of that spurt, with
one minute left, W&L down
58-50 and his college basketball
career effectively over, Graves
committed his fifth and final
foul. As he walked to the bench
the crowd gave him a standing
ovation. His 519 points this
season (20.0 points per game)
leave him seventh on the all-
time scoring list at W&L, with
1,441.

The Generals shot 3 of 11 from
the floor in the overtime period
and fell, 65-60.

The Generals’ overall record
of 14-12 is the team’s worst since
the 1979-80 season, when the
team went 14-15, but won the
ODAC tournament.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team made its best
showing in recent years at the
NCAA Division III Eastern
Regional meet in Trenton, N.J.,
on Feb. 11-12.

The tournament featured the
top wrestlers from 25 schools in
the Eastern region.

The Generals entered six
wrestlers in the championships,

. andall performed well.

Tim Valliere (167 lbs.), Joe
O’Neill (177 Ibs.) and Jeff Dixon
(190 Ibs.) all captured fourth-
place finishes, falling only one
victory short of qualifying for
the national tournament.

Dixon came painfully close to
qualifying, being eliminated by
only one point in overtime in his
final bout.

Larry Anker (142 lbs.) and
Carlton Peebles (HWT) both
finished fifth in their respective
weight classes.

Brian Lifsted (118 lbs.) won
one match, but was eliminated
by the eventual winner of his
weight class.

The Generals finished the
season witha record of 12-2. The
team won one tournament dur-
ing the year and finished fourth
in the tough W&L Invitational
meet. With the loss of only two
seniors from the 1983-84 team,
W&L wrestling will return eight
of ten starters for the 1984-85
edition.

....Well, back from a week’s
hiatus and it’s time for a review
of that ABC miniseries ‘‘Sara-
jevo.”” A good 80 percent of the
production rivaled “Winds of
Bore (er, War)’’ for excitement
and equaled at times that series
in sports content. Anticlimactic
perhaps best sums up this XIV
winter meeting of the world’s
cold weather athletes.
Everytime the activity in Sara-
jevo got mildly interesting,
ABC decided to put the sports
on hold and give us some
brilliant fluff piece on the
fascinating coffee shop nestled
in the hills overlooking the
Olympic city. And who can
forget the new and improved
“Up Close and Personal”
segments. The Russian speed-
skater playing his guitar made
me actually wish for John
Denver. One wonders, though,
just how exciting any Winter
Olympics can be. Seriously,
there’s cross country skiing and
the biathlon which remind one
of chores more than athletic
contests. As well, ABC’s
coverage did leave me with a
few questions. First, where did
they get those blazers? Glow-in-
the-dark light blue? C’mon Jim.
Did we really need those Ray
Gandolph reports? Nothing per-
sonal, Ray, but the Olympics
means sports or sports-related
not the story of three sisters
who make rugs the old-
fashioned way. Sarajevo is a
wonderfully obscure eastern
European city, or rather
wonderful because it is obscure.
Now that the ABC trucks and
cameras have exposed every
nook and cranny of the Olympic
city, it seems as attractive a
place as...well, Harrisburg, Pa.
All this aside, ABC’s hype could
not take away from the ath-
letes’ special moments. There

most realistic and fun athlete at
the games (No cute, mean-

The Washington and Lee
swimming team lost a dual
meet to Virginia Common-
wealth University in the final
event of the day on Feb. 10 at
Sweet Briar College.

Head swimming coach Page
Remillard is pleased that his
Division III team was very
competitive against the Divi-
sion I program of VCU. Com-
menting on the meet, Remillard
said, ‘‘We took them to the free
relay. It was something a lot of
other teams couldn’t do.”’

The Generals finished their
dual meet schedule with a
record of 6-4. W&L is currently
ranked 6th in the country
among Division II swim teams.

Last weekend the Generals
participated in the Seahawk In-
vitational at UNC Wilmington.
W&L was the only Division III
team at the meet which Coach
Remillard described as ‘‘very,
very fast.”

W&L now has qualified swim-

cording to Coach Remillard,
that figure represents the most

‘ This weekend the Generals

“That’s our big meet,” said
Remillard. Because the Gener-

Remillard also said, ‘‘There

Several Generals are swim-

to the national qualifying time
in their events and may qualify
this weekend. For example, the

McDonald’s to open in August

Construction to begin in April in Maxway Shopping Center

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Burger battles soon may
make their way to the city of
Lexington. A Waynesboro cor-
poration recently leased a
building on U.S. 60 in Lexington
that it plans to convert into a
McDonald’s restaurant by fall.

“It’s fairly definite,” said
R.A. Hendricks, founder and
president of RAHE Inc., con-
cerning the construction of the
fast food restaurant on the end
of the Maxway Shopping center
(across from Safeway Super-
market) in a building that
formerly housed Sears Roebuck
Inc. Construction should begin
in April, according to Hen-
dricks, with opening day
targeted for the last week in
August.

At first, it seemed ques-

 

tionable whether there would be
enough room for parking and a
drive-thru. ‘‘The architects just
gave us some drawings.’’ said
Hendricks, who noted that there
will be 82 parking spaces and a
drive-thru. To accomplish this,
the shopping center’s driveway
will be widened, with drive-thru
customers traveling toward the
Maxway before making a U-
turn to the drive-thru window.

‘Route 60 is the main artery
for the town of Lexington,’’ said
Hendricks, who added that
W&L, Virginia Military In-
stitute and Lexington, ‘‘shop-
ping hub for the Rockbridge
County,” were all factors that
influenced his decision to locate
the McDonalds’s in Lexington.
“The trading area would sup-
porta McDonald’s,”’ he said,
adding that the closest
McDonald’s locations are in
Staunton (37 miles away) and

Approximately 40 employees
will be hired initially. Students
will have a good chance at
employment, as Hendricks
terms the hours ‘‘flexible.”’
Restaurant hours will be 7 a.m.
to 11 p.m., seven days a week,
with the possibility of longer
hours on big social weekends.

‘“‘We’re looking forward to go-
ing down there (to Lexington) ,”’
concluded Hendricks, whose
business is an _ independent
licensee of 16 McDonald’s
restaurants.

situation,’ he said. “To me,
that’s the most significant
thing, and I think John is taking
advantage of it.

“If you’re going to charge
people with something, then
charge them. But this grand
jury is an abuse of public
responsibility,’ he said.

Larry Mann, another at-

'| torney in the field of four seek-

ing the prosecutor’s post last

-fall, also finds fault with the in-

vestigation.

“There’s no question in my
mind that the process is having
a negative impact on this com-
munity,’ he said.

“Part of the problem is the
use of the subpoena power to

compel people to answer ques-
tions that might be answered
voluntarily.”

Bernard J. Natkin, who has
practiced law in Lexington
since 1950, takes a different
view. “John Read got the ap-
proval of the Circuit Court to
have a grand jury, and until we
see the results of it, we should
reserve judgment,”’ he said.

“Tf it’s not worthwhile, he will
be responsible to the electorate.
If the results justify the means,
he shouldn’t be criticized,”
Natkin said. !

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton joined Read and
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds in requesting the
special grand jury.

two choices, either the famous
“regular recipe,’’ or the newer
“extra-crispy recipe.’’ While
I’m the type who likes his
chicken crispy, the nod here
goes to the regular recipe, no
contest. Extra-crispy at KFC is
crispy, but it must lack at least
nine of the Colonels’ 11 secret
herbs and spices. It’s dry and
virtually tasteless — you’ll have

to add salt and that’s bad on the
conscience. Yet the regular
recipe, though hardly great
fried chicken, is the best take-
out in Lexington. The 11 herbs
and spices make a tasty batter,
and it’s a bit more moist than
the extra-crispy, though still not
as moist as it should be. Yet my
main objection with KFC is on
ethical grounds, rather than on
purely culinary grounds; when
they cut up the chicken, they
come up with three breasts —
two side breasts and a center

breast —rather than the two

you would expect. So rather
than getting ‘‘a breast’ like you
ordered, you get two-thirds of a
breast, which looks little more
than bite-size, and represents
something of a rip-off.

Next week I’ll wind up the

fried chicken review, with the
three lesser known spots, Ken-
ney’s, Kroger and Safeway.
