Design for pavilion finalized
Added length to building will allow for tennis court

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Having narrowed the choice
to two potential designs for the
planned University pavilion,
the administration has decided
on a compromise version that
will provide for a_ longer
building, Frank Parsons, ex-
ecutive assistant to President
Wilson, said Tuesday.

The final design, which is sub-
ject to the approval of the Board
of Trustees, provides for a
structure that is 150 feet long
and 92 feet wide with a height of
24 feet to the eaves, said Par-
sons. One of the proposed plans
had called for a building that
was 150 feet long by 98 feet
wide, and the second plan pro-
posed a building that was 130
feet long by 92 feet wide, Par-
sons reported.

The additional length will per-
mit the installation of an indoor
tennis court, Parsons said.
However, he emphasized that
the primary reason for building
the pavilion was to provide
room for social and recrea-
tional activities, not the tennis
court.

Parsons said that architects
had told the University that the
indoor tennis court could be ad-
ded at relatively little cost by
simply lengthening the pavil-
ion.

“I think that this is an accept-
able compromise. The whole
project has been characterized
by a good degree of cooperation
between the Student Activities
Board and the athletic depart-
ment,’’ said Parsons.

SAB Treasurer John
Haywood said that the SAB was
generally satisfied with the
plans for the pavilion.

‘“‘We’re very pleased with the
progress. We really do have a
problem with inadequate
facilities. This will make it
much easier for us to offer
University-wide activities,’’
Haywood said.

The SAB hopes to hold its first

event in the pavilion during
Homecoming weekend in Oc-
tober, Haywood said. At least
four events each semester will
be held in the pavilion, and the
SAB hopes to boost the total to
10-12 dates per semester by
coordinating several Sunday
events with the fraternities,

. Haywood said.

The cost of the new pavilion
will fall somewhere between
$582,000 and $677,000 for the two
original designs, Parsons said.
Architects are drawing up the
modified design of the pavilion
to meet the new specifications
and will be able to provide an
exact price tag when the blue-
prints are completed, explained
Parsons.

“The object will be to effect
savings and reduce the cost of
the building to the lowest possi-
ble cost. We are not seeking to
build a very fancy building, but
one that will last for a long
time,” emphasized Parsons.

Parsons said that he still an-
ticipates that construction of
the pavilion will begin by June 1
and that the building will be
ready by the end of October.

The University has selected
Bass Construction Co. of Rich-
mond to build the pavilion. Par-
sons said that Bass has done all
the University’s construction
since 1976.

Bass built the University
Library and renovated McCor-
mick Hall, Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory and Evans Dining Hall.
Parsons said that Bass sets
realistic cost estimates and gets
the work done on time.

“‘Bass hasn’t missed getting a
job done on time yet,” Parsons
noted.

Parsons said that the
pavilion’s floor will be a type
suitable for athletic events and
able to withstand spilled beer
and cigarettes. Parsons ex-
plained that the athletic depart-
ment had wanted a floor that
athletes would not be injured on
if they fell, while the SAB
wanted a floor that would be

durable. Parsons said that
several surfaces serve both pur-
poses.

Haywood said that the SAB is
satisfied with the type of floor
selected. Originally the SAB
had objected to one type of floor
because it would not adequately
withstand cigarette burns,
Haywood said.

Parsons said the pavilion will
have steel siding and will look
like an athletic fieldhouse from
the outside.

“I only hope that students
won’t park on the baseball field
or other fenced-off areas,” Par-
sons said.

Haywood said that the SAB
wanted better access to the
area and the use of existing
parking lots nearby. Cars also
could be parked near Liberty
Hall, Haywood said.

The site of the pavilion will be
the pine woods north of Lewis
Hall, about 500 feet from
Buildings and Grounds’ offices.
The facility will have a capacity
of between 1,000 and 1,200 peo-
ple.

Student poll shows support
for current 12-12-6 calendar

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Students voting in Monday’s
poll favored by overwhelming
margins the 12-12-6 calendar,
50-minute classes, registration
once per term and a one-week
Thanksgiving vacation.

The faculty calendar commit-
tee voted two weeks ago to re-
tain the 12-12-6 calendar, extend
classes to 55 minutes apiece,
establish a one-week vacation
in the middle of October and re-
quire students to register Yor
their entire following year’s
course-load during the spring of
the preceding year.

The committee had been
scheduled to debate the
possiblity of eliminating
Thanksgiving vacation Friday,
but student representative Lee
Feldman said the committee
did not meet, preferring to wait
for the results of Monday’s poll.

Feldman had planned to rec-
ommend to the committee a
fall-term calendar that would
have no classes on a Monday
and Tuesday in the middle of
October or on the Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday of
Thanksgiving week. That pro-
posal will be presented to the
faculty committee tomorrow,
Feldman said.

The only issue on Monday’s
ballot not garnering at least 90
percent support was 50-minute
classes, for which 491 students,
or 78.9 percent, voted. 131
students favored 55-minute
classes.

The 12-12-44 calendar was
favored by 90.3 percent, or 561
of the voters, the Thanksgiving
break by 93.8 percent, or 577,
over a one-week October break,
and one registration per term,
rather than one per year, by
98.9 percent, or 617 voters. Only
seven students favored the one-
registration-per-year plan.

Feldman said he had ex-
pected more students to support

Review and Outlook

Voice of the Poll

When Lee Feldman, student representative to the
Calendar Committee, presented the committee’s pro-
posed changes at an Executive Committee meeting
two weeks ago, the reaction by the students who were
present was that of great surprise at the drastic
transformation of the University calendar which the
committee had envisioned. Junior representative and
president-elect Cole Dawson called one of the propos-
ed items “ridiculous.”’ We agree for the most part.

A poll taken during Monday’s class elections reaf-
firmed the student body’s negative sentiment on the
proposed changes. With only one exception, student
opinion was over 90 percent against the changes and
in favor of the current system.

Matters of the calendar and class length ultimately
go to the faculty for final approval or rejection. Con-
sequently the faculty also bears the burden of respon-
sibility for deciding what they feel is in the students’
best interests.

Students, though, should not dismiss the faculty as
having a lesser interest in the calendar.

The attitude of ‘‘we pay to go here and they’re paid
to be here” is ignorant at best. Some members of the
faculty have devoted their lives to Washington and
Lee whereas many students will only devote four
years. The faculty has as great an interest in the mat-
ter as the students and should not be discounted.

Specifically, however, we oppose the majority of
the changes the committee has proposed. In light of
the overwhelmingly high negative student opinion, we
think it wise for the faculty to consider this sentiment.

White requested to explain

To the Editors:

I wish to call for a public
statement from the Vice-
President elect of the Executive
Committee, James White, to ex-
plain his role in the bombing in-
cident that took place at the
Sigma Nu fraternity on March
3, 1984. The Ring-tum Phi
(3-15-84) verified the accuracy
of a widely circulated rumor
that White was involved in the
incident. However, the Phi did
not clearly explain his role in it.
As a member of the student
body that White seeks to repre-
sent, I wish to gain a full and
clear understanding of his in-
volvement so that I can make
an objective evaluation of his
qualifications as a represen-
tative and leader.

I believe that all members of
the Washington and Lee com-
munity, and most certainly the
members of the Executive
Committee, should strive to ap-
peal to the highest level of the
characteristics of honor, in-
tegrity, responsibility, and
maturity. I question whether

Correction

Due to a reporter’s error, the
time that Dean of the College-
elect John W. Elrod was offered
the position was misstated. The
Board of Trustees met. in
February, and he was offered
the post shortly after that
meeting.

any of these characteristics
were evidenced by the in-
dividuals responsible for the
bombing of Sigma Nu. I find it
unbelievable that White can
still consider himself worthy of
being a representative and
leader of his fellow students
after having been linked to this
atrocious affair. Further, I
believe that it is an insult to the
university and to the student
body. I want to be able to have

faith in the character of the in-
dividuals who make up the Ex-
ecutive Committee but James
White’s association with the
bombing of Sigma Nu makes it
impossible for me to have faith
in his. I hope he will answer this
call and be able to clear his
name and image. But if he can-
not, or does not, my next letter
will call for his resignation.

White asked to resign

To the Editors:

This year’s Executive Com-
mittee has been one which has
had to deal with very pivotal
issues concerning the well-
being of Washington and Lee.
Consequently, the committee
has fallen prey to widespread
and sharp criticism. I feel that
the E.C. has done remarkably
well in view of all that has hap-
pened, and they have proved
that we need responsible
representatives. This brings me
to the issue of James White and
the events surrounding his role
in the artillery simulator inci-
dent Fancy Dress weekend.
Aside from the fact that there is
no satisfactory explanation for
the bombing, it also presents
the question of Mr. White’s posi-
tion in the Executive Commit-
tee. Mr. White presently holds
the office of sophomore rep and
is the vice-presidential elect. In
my opinion, James White has
proven to the University that he
is quite capable of immaturity
and recklessness. He has also
proven that he is not at all wor-
thy of the position he now holds
on the E.C., as well as the posi-
tion to which he has been

elected. Our Executive Com-
mittee needs able leadership,
not irresponsibility. I therefore
call for the resignation of
James White on these grounds,
and I am certain that I am not
the only student who maintains
this demand. Maybe Mr. White
does have the ethics to at least
do the University this favor.

Did Phi avoid conflict of interest?

By SCOTT MASON
Phi Columnist

The artillery simulator that
exploded in the yard of the
Sigma Nu house earlier this
month may have done more
than raise tempers and break
out a few windows. It may have
set off a tremor afflicting the
decision-making process of The
Ring-tum Phi.

-The Phi Delta Theta house
has become the subject of con-
troversy because of the inci-
dent. It and some of its mem-

Reader’s
Advocate

bers have been punished for
throwing the simulator at the
Sigma Nu house. Those same
members, meanwhile, have
been victims of finger-pointing,
sneers and verbal assaults.
Ring-tum Phi Chief Editor
John Cleghorn is a Phi Delt.
That’s what journalists call a
conflict of interest — when
coverage of an event or organi-
zation is affected by the jour-

   

nalist’s personal involvement.
To readers it means the
possiblity of biased reporting
and slanted news. :

Cleghorn is no doubt embar-
rassed by the fact that his
fraternity is getting a lot of bad
press. He may be tempted to
soften that bad press or may
underplay the incident in order
to save his fraternity further
embarrassment. As chief editor
he has the authority to do that.
He may also lean the other way.
Conscious of the conflict of in-
terest, he may overplay the in-
cident to demonstrate that he’s
not afraid of giving Phi Delt
“‘bad press,” not afraid of sen-
sationalizing the sneers and
verbal assaults that have
resulted from the act.

Cleghorn himself probably
doesn’t know how or to what ex-
tent his involvement as a mem-
ber of Phi Delt has affected his
decisions concerning coverage
of events surrounding Phi Delt.
It may not have affected his
decisions at all. Indeed, the
coverage so far has seemed
fair, accurate and_ well-
balanced. But what’s important

 

is that there’s an appearance of
conflict, and appearance alone
is enough to make readers dis-
trust the credibility of the Phi’s
news reports. There’s a strong
suggestion of slanted news and
biased reporting in the mere
fact that Cleghorn is a member
of the fraternity that’s current-
ly making big headlines.

The Ring-tum Phi is lucky in
that it does have a safeguard
against such conflicts of in-
terest. The decision-making
duties are shared by Cleghorn,
co-Editor Rick Swagler and
News Editor Bruce Potter. If
one of them has a conflict, the
others can fill the decision-
making role.

Conflict of interest was
among several issues that arose
last weekend during the semi-
nar on the ethics of journalism.
Should journalists decide to
participate in activities and
organizations outside the
newsroom, the time may come
when they’ll have to report on
those organizations. That, in-
cidentally, is not a rare oc-
currence.

The purpose here is to avoid

 

Letters

Caruthers clarifies EC action

To the Editors:

Concerning Jim Sarle’s letter
three weeks ago about the In-
dependent Union and the E.C., I
at least can say I was informed
of it beforehand by Jim himself.
I was, however, surprised by its
content. After being appointed
ad-hoc member to the I.U.
(liason would be a better word),
I contacted Joe Cadle and also
spoke with Jim. Jim told me
that he had already submitted
his letter.

Anyway, the reason I was ap-
pointed as ad-hoc member was
because I am interested in the
cause of the I.U. I, as Jim
claimed, am not against the
I.U. but was, however, against

giving it any money under the
circumstances it was re-
quested. I don’t feel the E.C.
should create another S.A.B.
just for the independents but
rather should encourage the
S.A.B. to encompass all stu-
dents in its allotment of ac-
tivities, and I do not mean to
criticize the S.A.B. at all. The
I.U., however, should have col-
lected dues first in order to have
been able to show a firm com-
mitment before it requested
money. At the time, their
response to this suggestion was
why would anyone want to pay
dues to the I.U. when it may not
be around in a month or so. Our
concern lay in the fact that why
should the E.C. itself put money

into the I.U. if it wasn’t able to
prove its stability nor the com-
mitment by its members.
Nevertheless, I will easily be
able to work with Joe and Jim in
encouraging and collecting
ideas. (If anyone has any ideas,
please contact any or all three
of us.) Hopefully, the I.U. is go-
ing to be beginning a collection
of dues in order to show a firm
commitment. I think Jim and
Joe now know the true inten-
tions of the E.C. after talking
with me, and I want to assure
everyone that appointing an ad-
hoc member or liason was not
an abuse of power but rather a
helping hand.
Andrew Caruthers
Freshmen E.C. Representative

Brower calls for more cooperation

To the Editors:

Making clear a few, not so
well known facts, I would like to
help initiate some discussion
about our generally poor rela-
tionship with law _ students.
Before Lewis Hall was built, the
law students moved about the
undergraduate campus as the
fifth class. There was a good
academic relationship amongst
all the students of Washington
and Lee University, and there-
fore, the social relationships
developed more naturally and
without a great deal of effort by
either student level. Further-
more, law students predomi-
nantly served in one or several
of the Big Three positions of the
Executive Committee. There

was a great deal of respect

 

towards the law students from
undergraduates, and this seems
only natural, as these older
students were more mature and
had more to offer in life ex-
perience. Likewise, seniors
command more respect
amongst the undergraduate
school students as they sit at the
head of their peers. The gap
which presently exists is not on-
ly unnecessary, but it’s simply
a damn shame. There are many
law students who disagree with
having to exist at law school
under the Honor System, and I
can sympathize with the fact
that most of you lived at college
under similar honor systems.
If, however, we were to follow
the proposed example of the

University of Virginia, and

allow for the law school to write
its own consitution and have its
own EC, then we might as well
take out the bridge that joins
the two sides now. I am confi-
dent that we can work together
as a body of students who are
fortunate enough to attend
W&L, and hopefully through
friendly cooperation of our
class leaders, and individual ef-
forts, we will initiate better
social relationships again. We
as undergraduates have far too
much to learn from you, and
likewise, there is a great deal
that you can learn from us.
There is no reason that this
can’t work.

biased reporting, to be as objec-
tive as possible. That may be in
and of itself impossible. To be
completely objective means not
having any opinions, for even
opinions about organizations
and events can lead to biased
coverage.

So what’s a journalist suppos-
ed to do? Does he exclude him-
self from his community? Does
he abstain from joining
organizations? Does he not for-
mulate opinions? Is he not sup-
posed to think?

John Cleghorn could have
found himself in a tight position
had he been the only one on the
Phi staff with decision-making
power. As a member of Phi Delt
and as an editor forced to

decide how to play the Phi Delt
story, Cleghorn’s decision-
making effectiveness could
have become caught in the vise.

A conflict of this kind can
easily happen, with Cleghorn or
with anyone on the Phi staff.
The question is, as a responsible
journalist, do you anticipate a
possible conflict and cut your-
self off from all outside activi-
ty? Or do you deal with the con-
flicts as they come?

sion may have caused more

Phi Columnist

On the 2nd of February, a
crew of us piled into the cars
and floored it for Princeton,
New Jersey. It was an in-
teresting trip: a motorcade full
of unreconstructed. Confeder-
ates invading the North. I, for
example, had never been above
the Mason-Dixon before.
Something tells me that I could
have waited another two
decades. At least to see New
Jersey.

I suppose I should get the
matters of record out of the way
first, since even those happy

My View

few who saw the press release
have long forgotten it. Prince-
ton University and Community
College hosts every so often a
Model United Nations Con-
ference at which various
schools play the roles of the
member nations of the real
thing. The model isn’t quite as

_ funny as the real thing, of

course, but they do their best.

We had been coquettish about
this, on the grounds that we had
such a long way to go to get to
Princeton. We told them they’d
have to make it worth our while.
So they gave us the United
States. Panic. The panic in-
creased when we found out that
West Point had been assigned
the USSR. Them people is
mean.

Yours truly ended up as Chief
of Mission. This meant that I
got to sit on the General
Assembly and defend the
United States from all sorts of
attacks. Everybody and their
dog — meaning USSR and
Libya — got in on the act. I
regret to say that everyone
played their parts with great
glee. The last time I saw that
many people in one room cut-
ting down America was in the

faculty lounge..

The reason we refer to this
among ourselves as OPERA-
TION BIG MAGNOLIA is sim-
ple. Old Virginny cleaned up
that weekend. UVa had been
given the role of Her Majesty’s
Government and poured tea so
nicely that they won, deserved-
ly, first place as a delegation.
There are those who suggested
that UVa was perfect for the
role of Great Britain, given that
Charlottesville is the last col-
ony. Three cheers for King
George.

Taking fourth place overall
was the Federal Republic of
Germany, played ably by VMI.
These boys were more than
happy to accept the Pershing
missiles we promised ‘em. I
just don’t see what the fuss is
about.

Hampden-Sydney was Peru.

We took third overall as a
delegation. Jon Zagrodsky ran
the Western Summit meeting
like a Punch and Judy show.
Not even Canada gave the U.S.
any lip. He got a personal first
place out of that one. Lawton
Jackson got a second in his
main committee, against over-
whelming odds. I won
something or other myself. Be-
tween the Virginia colleges,
there were a total of about fif-
teen awards of one sort or
another. Count in Duke and the
Tarheels, and the South had
risen indeed.

But the fascinating thing
about the Conference was the
stuff behind the proverbial
scenes. The drive up was our
first clue. The federal govern-
ment has to have chosen the in-
terstate routes with a view to
seeing just how ugly it could
make them. It must have re-
quired deliberate effort to route
the interstates through country
that awful. The only thing to
relieve the monotony of the
poisoned land is the succession
of chemical plants that speeds
past the car windows. Why, we

A proposed reorganization of
the Student Activities Board
would give it a board of direc-
tors structure that would decen-
tralize responsibility in the
group.

The Executive Committee en-
dorsed the concept Monday in
what it called ‘‘a non-binding
general consensus’’ and asked
that a more detailed plan be
submitted to it next week.

The change was proposed by
Burford Smith, a vice-chairman
of the SAB, and John Haywood,
the organization’s treasurer.

If the revision were enacted,
the group would be headed by a
chairman, under whom would

 

Member suggests

be an executive director.

He would be in charge of six
directors responsible for
specific areas of SAB activity:
entertainment/bands, enter-
tainment/weekends, opera-
tions, publicity, outing/recrea-
tion and films/special events.

Smith said that the reorgani-
zation would ‘“‘almost double the
number of people with im-
mediate input.’’

“Right now, we have a staff of
40 or 50 people, but we haven’t
been able to organize them or
provide enough work for them,’’
Haywood said. —

“Under the new plan, com-
mittee members would feel
they have input and are making
contributions,’’ he said.

“Right now we have a pro-

blem getting them to work
—there’s some hesitation. I
can’t say that I blame them.”

Smith said that the reorgani-
zation would also allow the SAB
to expand its program.

“As it stands now with
responsibility concentrated,
there’s more work than we can
handle,”’ he said.

“‘We want to fulfill the obliga-
tions we have that everyone is
talking about. But the way it’s
set up now, if we started doing
other things, the SAB would
begin to fall apart.”’

Haywood said the new struc-
ture would allow the group to
‘‘do what we do now, only a lit-
tle more effectively.”’ In addi-
tion he said it would ‘‘allow us to
look at a much broader pic-
ture.”’

“Everyone isn’t satisfied,”’ he
said. ‘If they were, we wouldn’t
see these special interest
groups forming, like the In-
dependent Union.” ;

ly a staff counselor for the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board in
Washington, has been ap-
pointed assistant dean of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Law.

Walther’s appointment was
announced by W&L law school
dean Frederic L. Kirgis Jr.,
who also announced that Ed-
ward O. Henneman, assistant
dean since 1981, will return to
full-time teaching in the law
school while also occupying a
newly created position of
associate dean.

Walther will concentrate on -

admissions and financial aid
matters with some responsibili-
ty for student counseling in her
role as assistant dean, Kirgis
said. She will assume her duties
July 1.

In the new position of
associate dean, Henneman will
deal with student affairs,

primarily involving the inter-
pretation and application of
academic rules.

“I am delighted that we are
making these two appoint-
ments,” Kirgis said. ‘Pat
Walther distinguished herself
as a student here at Washington
and Lee, and I am confident she
will approach this new assign-
ment with skill and enthusiasm.
Her presence will allow Ned
Henneman to return his full
concentrations to the classroom
while also providing valuable
assistance to me in other impor-
tant areas.”

Walther received the juris
doctor degree from the W&L
School of Law in 1983. She is a
1979 graduate of Duke Universi-
ty.
While at W&L, she was presi-
dent of the Women Law Stu-
dents’ Organization, served in
the Legal Aid Society and was
on the W&L Law Review.

SNu decides
to drop issue

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The members of Sigma Nu
voted Monday night not to take
any further action in the recent
incident involving two mem-
bers of Phi Delta Theta.

On March 3, an artillery
simulator was thrown from the
Phi Delt house across the street
into the Sigma Nu yard. Sopho-
mores Frank Surface and
James White have admitted in-
volvement in the action.

“‘We do not intend to press
charges at this time,’’ Sigma
Nu President Chris John said
after presiding over an hour-
long debate on the subject.

Phi Delt was given two weeks
of social probation for the inci-
dent, and the students were
each given four weeks of social
probation and will not be per-
mitted to live in the fraternity
house during spring term.

The Student Control Commit-
tee, which levied the penalties,
also instructed the two to pay
for the repair of the damage to
the Sigma Nu House and to
make a personal apology to the
members of the house. ~

Surface and White appeared
before Monday’s meeting of
Sigma Nu and offered an
apology which John said was
satisfactory. Sigma Nu has
been reimbursed for the
damage.

White, a member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the vice
president-elect of the student
body, said that the artillery
simulator was purchased at a
public gun show in Texas.

“It was sold as a novelty
item, a prankster-like device,
so I thought it was no big deal,”
White said Tuesday.

“T can see myself at fault for
giving it to Frank,’’ he said. “I
figured he would do something
with it related to its intent as a
novelty-type item. I shouldn’t
have given it tohim.”’

“This thing has just snowball-
ed on me,” he continued. ‘It
was an honest mistake. It

wasn’t meant as an aggression
against the Sigma Nus.”’

“The problem is that it was
louder than anyone expected,
especially myself,’ he added.
“It surprised the hell out of
me.”

White said that because he
purchased the device at a public
exhibition, he didn’t realize that
there was anything improper
about possessing it.

“I don’t want to have any part
of anything illegal,’’ he said.

“If I had any idea that there
were any illegal implications to
it, I'd have thrown it in the gar-
bagecan.”’

Capt. Robert R. Ripple, a
military science professor, is an
engineer who says he works fre-
quently with devices such as the
artillery simulator. He provid-
ed “‘expert testimony’’ to the
Student Control Committee.

“An artillery simulator is a
large firecracker,’ he said in
an interview. “It is not an ex-
plosive device.”

“It can do no more damage
than a normal large fire-
cracker,” he continued. “It is
made to be used against people,
although you’re not supposed to
come into direct contact with it.

“If you’re not in direct con-
tact with it, there’s no danger to
you.”

According to Ripple, an ar-
tillery simulator is ‘flash
powder tightly wrapped in card-
board. It whistles and is quite
loud.”’

John said the debate at Mon-
day’s Sigma Nu meeting ‘‘got
pretty heated,’’ and that the
vote not to take further action
was not unanimous.

‘Many people are concerned
about what to do about this
situation,’ he said. ‘‘We don’t
see it as an isolated incident.”’

He said there have been a
number of incidents of harrass-
ment between the members of
the two houses. The problem,
according to John, is with in-
dividuals in the fraternity, not
with the Phi Delt leadership.

The managing editor of The
Philadelphia Inquirer told an
audience at Washington and
Lee University’s 10th annual
Journalism Ethics Institute on
Friday that ‘by needlessly
resorting to unnamed sources”’
journalists undermine their
credibility and reduce their ef-
fectiveness.

Gene Foreman presented the
keynote address for the three-
day institute in which W&L
students were joined by pro-
fessors and practicing jour-
nalists for sessions on a wide
range of topics. The institute is
part of Washington and Lee’s
program in applied ethics,
“Society and the Professions.’’

Citing his concern about
credibility in the journalism
profession, Foreman said, ‘“The
heavy reliance on unnamed
sources in our news stories is
engendering suspicion and
distrust among our readers. By
the very act of taking others in-
to our confidence, we strain the
confidence our readers have in
us.””

In addition to inviting
distrust, Foreman noted that
such “blind” sources expose
journalists to other dangers, in-
cluding the threat of defama-
tion suits or even criminal cita-
tions for the failure to reveal a
source.

Despite his concern over the
use of confidential sources,
Foreman would not suggest
that editors simply ban their
use.

“Our mission is to serve as a
conduit of information to our
readers,’’ Foreman said. “That
flow of information would be
greatly diminished if we flatly
ordered our reporters not to
write what they cannot at-

 

“If the public
doesn’t _ believe
what we’re publish-

ing, then it’s logi-
cal to expect its
next step will be to
stop buying what
we print.”

 

tribute by name and title.”’

Instead, Foreman offered six
guidelines that he feels should
be used in deciding whether to
use an unnamed source:

eAn unnamed source should
be a last resort, not an easy
alternative.

elt should be clear that the
source’s physical or economic
well-being might be jeopardized
if his or her name is revealed.

eThe information provided by

anunnamed  urce must be es-
sential to an...iportant story.

To help readers evaluate the
information, unnamed sources
should be described as fully as
possible without giving away
their identity.

elf an unnamed source is
quoted making derogatory
statements about someone,
such a statement must be one
that enhances the public’s
understanding of a crucial
issue. Further, the statement
should be corroborated by
public record or named
sources.
~ eReporters have to be free to
use their judgment in granting
confidentiality but must be ex-
pected to identify sources to
their editors.

Foreman said that while the
journalism profession has
become more sophisticated in
the last generation, readers
have also become more sophis-
ticated. The readers’ skep-
ticism is heightened by jour-
nalists’ use of unnamed
sources, he said.

“Truth, after all, is our basic
commodity. If the public
doesn’t believe what we’re pub-
lishing, then it’s logical to ex-
pect its next step will be to stop
buying what we _ print,”
Foreman said.

‘Hunger hurts’

Group plans famine to raise money

Along the Colonnade of Wash-
ington and Lee University you
see the familiar sight of

students making their way to.

class. But on this morning you
notice a button on a student’s
lapel. It strikes you as odd
because it does not say ‘‘Vote’’
or “Smile”; rather, it says
“Hunger Hurts.”’

The hunger this button refers
to is real. The students wearing
these buttons are going to feel
the hurt of hunger as they fast
March 23 to 24 for the cause of
world hunger. Each student will
skip three meals between Fri-
day noon and Saturday evening.
Those unable to participate are
encouraged to sponsor a famine
participant by contributing $2
per meal skipped.

What good is this small
measure of charity? It may
seem that only a few dollars will
be raised, not nearly enough to
be of any real help; but that is
only one aspect of their mission.
They also wish to raise aware-
ness of the world’s starving peo-
ple. ‘‘After all,”’ a past famine
participant said, ‘‘hunger is 100
percent curable.”

Chaplain Charles C. Caudill of
Virginia Military Institute is in
charge of the Planned Famine
for Washington and Lee and
VMI. ‘‘We plan for those par-
ticipating in the program to
share in the experience of feel-
ing hungry, to learn why hunger
exists in the world and to find
out what we can do about it,”
said Caudill.

Perhaps they will learn to cut
down on food waste. Research-
ers who dug through garbage
cans in a medium-sized city in
the U.S. found up to 3,000
pounds of edible meat dumped
each week.

The practical side of this fast

is that some who otherwise
would have died from hunger
will be saved.

The money from the Planned
Famine will go to Ethiopia,
which has been experiencing
severe droughts since the early
1970s. The lack of rain has
depleted water supplies needed
for both drinking and hygiene.
In addition to malnutrition, the
children suffer from skin and
eye infections.

Dr. Tony Atkins, director of
relief and rehabilitation for
World Vision, the sponsoring
organization, went to Gondar
and Shewa, Ethiopia. “I have
seen many situations of disease
among infants and children,”
he said, ‘‘but I cannot recollect
a scene quite like this — so
pitiful in the’ numbers of
children affected so seriously
by malnutrition,”’ he said.

World Vision International
has been around for 34 years
and reaches more than 70 coun-
tries. Last year 79 percent of its
money went toward direct relief
services,

World Vision will use the
money from planned famines
throughout Virginia for faffa, a
nutritional supplement of grain
and powdered milk produced in
Ethiopia; clothing and blan-
kets; an Ethiopian medical
team; and the maintenance of
an aircraft used to deliver daily
food and medicine to areas in-
accessible by trucks.

The planned famine in Virgin-
ia is expected to raise $50,000
from the 10 to 15 schools involv-
ed. “It is only a drop in the
ocean, but it is a beginning that
will help,” said Atkins.

‘Let not the slight be slighted’

Charles W. Turner. McClure
Press, Verona, Va. 1983. 110. pp
text. Indexed. Illustrations.
By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE
Phi Columnist

Every few years or so, the
select public for whom he
writes receives from Mr.
Turner another slim volume of
reminisces private or histories
public. Like fireflies, these
scarce sparks from a swift pen
flash briefly, illuminating the
small and homelike, and so are
gone. These are books of a sum-
mer dusk.

Let not the slight be slighted.
There is a place for the quiet
and local. It is from love of the
immediate and familiar that we
proceed to the progressively
wider affections of society and
mankind. So saith the prophet
Edmund Burke. Was this not St.

Hinely )

 

James’ point: No man can love
so transcendent and oceanic be-
ing as the Deity, who cannot be
charitable to his laundress, his
maiden aunt and the young cou-
ple down the street whose Lab
tears into the garbage punctual-
ly every Monday at dawn.

In Charles Turner, as his
students will attest, we have a
master of detail. History is an
accumulation of detail. The
broad sweeps of Gibbon or
Macaulay’s brush, the expan-
sive strokes of Churchill and
Toynbee: all paint fiction if the
details be ignored.

Old Zeus is a life of Captain
White, officer in the Liberty
Hall Volunteers of the Stonewall
Brigade. His captaincy is
salient: while his lasting

—albeit local — fame was based
on his career as Professor of
Greek here at W&L, his
military career was the im-

petus for his becoming Robert
E. Lee’s closest confidant in the
Washington College years.

This in turn led to his appoint-
ment as acting president be-
tween the General’s death and
Custis Lee’s confirmation as his
successor; and to his role as the
younger Lee’s prime minister
during his presidency. So we
have in Turner brief lights of a
man whose father was pastor of
Lexington Presbyterian before
the War, and after whom White
Street is named; a man who
served Washington College
under Hamilton Junkin; a man
of letters caught up in a battle,
and the indispensable aide-de-
camp of a warrior-educator.
The subject alone would justify
the work.

Now, this is by no means a
perfect volume. There is first of
all a problem of editing. As for
the copy-editing the lapses,

while trying, are excusable; for
is not this the curse of small im-
prints, private presses and local
publishers? More vexing is the
thicket of footnotes through
which the text creeps. The com-
plaint is not, however, devas-
tating; for the text of those foot-
notes is a treasure chest of the
piquant, the interesting and the
downright amusing.

These are minor cavils. Only
slightly more important is the
question of Mr. Turner’s own
style: Again, this is in large part
the fault of the circumstances
that deprived the book of the
sort of editing secured to an
author by a larger house. This
work came forth unmidwifed.
Mr. Turner’s style is not at all
poor; rather, too long contact
with the Victorian sentence
(White’s are exemplary of the
contemporary trend toward fus-
tian) has left his own diction ac-

look at a Civil War captain shows mastery of detail

cordingly overstuffed.

But it is padded with goodly
things. In the career of Captain
White is reflected the times of
his class and area. We see a
president who failed, sundered
from his students by the dif-
ferences of a coming war, and

another, his successor, who
healed a nation from a small
college in an undistinguished
town. We see young ploughboys
and classics students fighting
the invader side by side and
oecome disillusioned with the
glory of war. Like an academic
Candide, White strolls bewil-
dered through bitter times; and
Turner leads us in tracking him
diligently through it all. For
those who can feel any interest
in men caught up in great
events, this work is a rich vein
of worthy information, pleasing
to the sense of home and history
alike.

VASAP for Dudley ?

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter
When was the last time. you
saw Dudley Moore sober in a
movie? Well, if you discount
his role in Six Weeks(the movie
equivalent of overdosing on

never.

I for one am becoming a little
weary of watching little Dudley
stagger all over the screen,
which comprised the majority
of the action in Unfaithfully

be appropriate punishment if

At the risk of sounding chau-
vinistic, I did love Natassja Kin-
ski as her usual pouty, sensual
persona. So who cares if she
isn’t the most convincing
Italian wife (she just can’t seem
to shake her father Klause’s ac-
cent), she could have played an
Albanian dish washer with
about the same results.

Another mark against the
movie is the appearance of Ar-
mande Assante as Maximillian
Stein, maestro Claude East-
man’s (Dudley Moore) cello-
playing protege. Assante is too
cool, macho, and Frenchy for
my taste. (Where’s Charles

mind.

My recommendation to the

much more of Nastassja and
nothing remotely resembling

The secret of Old Main revealed

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

I’m going to venture to guess
that a large number of Phi
readers have never heard of, or
at least never been to, the Old
Main Sandwich and Cheese
Shoppe, and further, that some
of you who have experienced
Old Main sandwiches never-
theless forget to consider Old
Main at that precious moment
when you decide what you’re in
the mood for: Arby’s, Lloyd’s,
the Co-op...Arby’s, Lloyd’s, the
Co-op....still no enthusiasm.
But, if you’re lucky, somewhere

The
Eat Beat

in that vast expanse of grey
matter those brain cells assign-
ed to Old Main will assert them-
selves. The act of remembering
Old Main is like answering a dif-
ficult question in Trivial Pur-
suit (to me it is anyway). With

both there is the actual sensa- —

tion of the brain at work, and
the realization that in some
small way you’ve gone beyond
the call of mediocrity. Best of
all, the sandwich you get will
probably be even more satisfy-
ing than the fleeting sense of
your own total awareness.

The reason Old Main is secret
to some and forgettable to
others is only because of its
location. Since it can’t be seen
from the street, or from outside,
for that matter, there is nothing
physical to remind you of it. It’s
inside the Old Main Street Mall,
at 29 N. Main St., across from
where White Columns used to
be and catty-corner to Red
Square. ‘or those of you who
get your hair styled at Marie’s
instead of simply cut, you’ll
know that the Sandwich Shoppe
is in the back of the Mall, to the

right.

A quick word on the mall — if
you’ve never been, you owe
yourself a trip. On the outside it
appears to be a big, non-
descript red brick building, yet
the inside is one of the most
charming sights in Lexington.
When I first went there a few
years ago I was very pleasantly
surprised — it reminded me of
the kind of clean, cute little
village streets found in Disney
World, but with the accent on in-
nocence rather than commer-
cialism. Small stores run by
ladies selling gifts, oriental
rugs, satin and lace, etc — not
the kinds of things you’re likely
to buy, but the stores and the
street signs give the mall a
dreamy, escapist feel.

Sitting at the tables outside
the Sandwich Shoppe, with the
sun coming through the glass
roof and the sound of the water
fountain in the background, I
was reminded of the porch
restaurants in the French Quar-
ter of New Orleans, sort of
relaxing and festive at the same
time. Now on to the sandwiches,
what you came for in the first
place.

The Old Main menu lists
specialties and popular com-
binations, but it’s good to keep
in mind that you can make
alterations to suit your taste.
For instance, the Combination
No. 2 is corned beef, pastrami,
and imported swiss with cole
slaw and dressing on a Vienna
roll. I get it without the cole
slaw, and with mayonnaise and
mustard instead of dressing,
and I’m very satisfied.
Everybody’s got their own
sandwich eating peculiarities
—some people don’t like mayo,
or mustard, and I don’t happen
to like anything sweet, like
dressing or Miracle Whip. And
the good thing about Old Main is
that they have quality in-
gredients — you can tell they
don’t walk around Kroger with

One of the newest additions to
the Washington and Lee rock
scene, the ‘Missing Minks,”’
will play in the Cockpit this Fri-
day at 9 p.m. The sextet is com-
posed of freshmen Steve Doran
(manager and vocals), Tom
Maurer (keyboards, vocals),
John D. Wheeler (guitar,
vocals) and Chris Fure (bass.
vocals), along with seniors

Barthe van Doorn (drums) and
Todd Ford (guitar, vocals).
“‘We’re looking to play as
many places in the college area
as possible,” says Doran. The
sextet, formerly known as ‘“‘The
College Boys,”’ was founded in
December and put on its first
performance at the Mary
Baldwin College Pub on Jan. 26.

a shopping cart. The meat isn’t
processed, the cheese comes
from Switzerland, and the
bread tastes homemade. The
Vienna roll is especially good;
it’s chewy, and you have to tug
a little, which is a sign of quality
bread.

Judging from the people I
talked to, the Barbeque Beef
Hero and the Old Main Club are
‘the two most popular sand-
wiches. The Old Main Club is
my second favorite Old Main
sandwich. It’s packed high with
turkey, ham, roast beef, let-
tuce, and mayonnaise. One
source considered it a stroke of
genius that they put it on
Pumpernickel, and I couldn’t
help but agree. I didn’t like the

Barbeque as much, but this is
because I’ve never liked the
way bread tasted when it was
soaked with barbeque sauce.
Write this off as my problem,
for I heard a lot of high praise
for this one. My favorite was the
combination No. 3, with ham,
turkey breast, melted swiss,
and mayo served hot on a Vien-
na roll. Old Main steams their
sandwiches, and this gives
them a melty cohesiveness
which works best on the Vienna
rolls. And for dessert, they have
the best cheesecake in town
— heavy and creamy and moist
whatever on top of a thick
crumb crust.

As well as having good food
and a nice atmosphere, Old

Main is inexpensive, with all the
sandwiches costing about two
dollars. And the two girls that
work there are talkative and
personable. As I was eating my
sandwiches, in walked none
other than Markham Pyle, who
made his regular order, a Taco
Hero, hold the tomato and
heavy on the peppers. Never at
a loss for words, fellow chow-
hound Markham quoth, ‘‘I have
nothing but good to say of the
place. The service is always
cheerful, the food’s great,
reasonable, and it’s a_ full
meal.’’ That about says it.

Next week, the Eat Beat in-
vestigates a mysterious case of
sea sickness in land-locked Lex-
ington.

Student art displayed in duPont

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s annual
Spring Student Art Show is cur-
rently on exhibit in duPont
Gallery. The show includes a
variety of mixed media sculp-
ture, paintings, drawings,
prints and photographs repre-
senting the efforts of nearly 50
W&L art students.

The broad range of styles and
techniques involved in the ex-
hibit lends diversity to the more
than 100 pieces on display. Of
note in water color are Warren
Watkins’ frosty ‘‘Virginia
Winter,’’ Elizabeth Shields’ col-
orful “Spring Melt” and Donald
Smith’s clean and simple
Chinese brush painting, ‘Bird
and Pine Tree.” George Finly’s
ambitious work ‘‘One Night”’ is
one of the few oil paintings on
display, but it ably demon-
strates the depth and latitude of

compostion possible in this
medium.
Several interesting small

drawings in pencil and ink are
being shown. In this category

the work of Jeff Hubbard and -

David Buschman stands out.
Hubbard’s ‘“‘Governor’s Man-
sion” and ‘“‘Colonnade”’ in pen
and ink are finely drawn minia-
tures notable for their clean
detail. Buschman’s pencil
drawing ‘Grandfather Cole-
man” and his pen and ink “Bird
of Paradise’ are superbly ex-
ecuted and contain the best
detail of any drawings. Other
works of high quality are Dun-
can Stone’s “Untitled Nude’’
and Erich Anspach’s ‘Grace
Kelly.”

For the pastel enthusiast
there are Jim Farthing’s strong
and colorful ‘‘Jennifer’s’’ and
Michael Bayer’s bucolic work

“The Valley.”
Sculpture works abound in
the exhibit. Several of the

larger pieces incorporate a
lush, polished dark wood with
brass and iron. Two of Ross
Lynde’s works dominate the
front of the gallery. ‘“‘Working
No. 1” and “Working No. 2”
demonstrate fine craftsman-
ship and imagination. An unti-
tled neon, glass and metal piece
by Lewis Allen at the gallery’s

entrance is also superb. A new
room at the rear of the gallery
contains many more
fascinating sculpture pieces
and should not be overlooked.

The works of two seniors,
Steve Brooks and Charles
Mason, round out the show.
Brooks’ mixed media ‘‘Base-
ment Byzantine”’ brings colored
cloth, paint, wood and plastic
together to create one of the
best pieces in the show. He has
successfully incorporated the
techniques of several modern
American artists into a
cohesive and intriguing whole.
Mason’s photographs, taken
with a Polaroid SX-70 Land
Camera, are also superb. He
shows an innate talent for this
relatively new and growing
field of expression, and we will
undoubtedly see and hear more
of him in the future.

There will be a reception in
the gallery to honor the artists
on Friday, March 23, from 3-5
p.m. It is open to the public, and
beer and chips will be provided.

The show will remain in du-
Pont through March 30.

In Vegas, they say that
nothing is less certain than a
sure thing.

Well, politics is the world’s
biggest crap shoot, and Tues-
day night Walter Mondale had a
new idea — winning a primary.

Ten days ago, on the night of
Super Tuesday, it was to the
theme song of “Rocky” that
Gary Hart entered the ballroom
of the Washington hotel where
his supporters were gathered.

The next day, apparently una-
ware of the senator’s serenade,
- Mondale said on television that
‘Rocky’ is the story of a
fighter who fights back.”

On Tuesday night he did just
that with a crucial victory in Il-
linois.

Dorothy Lynch, Hart’s poll-
ster, said on the “CBS Morning
News’’ on the morning of Super
Tuesday, “As people get to
know him, they’re going to like
him even better.”

Well, familiarity breeds con-
tempt, not confidence, and the
unrelenting scrutiny Hart has

analyst for the Mock Con-
vention.

received in the last few weeks
apparently hurt him on Tues-
day.

Ever since Mondale learned
that he couldn’t take New
Hampshire for granite, the
former vice president has been
campaigning intensely, and it
paid off for him this week.

For most of us, Saturday was
St. Patrick’s Day, but Mondale
campaign staffers called it
‘“‘The Day Without Shame.”’

Sporting a kelly green tie,
Walter O’Mondale made an ap-
pearance before a group of
Chicago’s Irish citizens.

Later, he spoke at a gathering
of the city’s Polish residents. In
an effort to turn Illinois into the
Land of Linkin’, Mondale at-
tempted to associate labor sup-
port for his candidacy with
Lech Walesa and Solidarity.

“I’ve been criticized a little
bit for having union support,”
he said in the understatement of
the hour.

No one is mocking the Mock
Convention now — Political
Director Jack Dent reports that
its strategists were correct on
six out of seven races last week.

It’s getting easier as the field
narrows. Virginia is holding its

biology professor John S. Knox
seeking information about
whether honey could be con-
taminated by coming in contact
with marijuana.
Knox said it was his under-
standing that drug investiga-
tions had revealed that some

county residents were storing
their marijuana in beehives.

He said it was unclear
whether the prosecutor was try-
ing to determine if the honey in
beehives used for such storage

purposes could be tainted, or
whether bees carrying pollen
from marijuana plants could
contaminate honey.

He and chemistry professor
J. Keith Shillington declined to
perform the test.

‘I wouldn’t attempt to do it,
because it would take a very
long time to do with any relia-
bility,” Knox said. ‘I couldn’t
figure out why he came to me
for this.”’

The intern, senior Anthony In-
terante, said that office matters
were confidential and that he
could not discuss the incident.

caucuses over this weekend,
and this was supposed to be a
very good state for John Glenn,
the first astronaut to splash
down without ever taking off.

On March 12, shortly before
Glenn withdrew, Gov. Charles
Robb, who had endorsed him,
sent letters to potential Glenn
delegates, urging them to re-
main uncommitted since it
would give the state some
leverage in the event of a
“‘brokered”’ convention.

The Connecticut primary is
Tuesday, and its Senator
Christopher Dodd has endorsed
Hart. It may be out of self-
interest that many dodd-in-the-
wool Connecticut loyalists vote
for Hart, since their senator
seems to have at least an inside
track on the vice presidential
post.

On March 10, at the time that
Dodd endorsed him, Hart told
the audience: “‘I will find ways
of expressing my appreciation
to Chris later. At the very least,
let me.say that we will have
some lengthy opportunities
over lunch and dinner in the
White House to discuss Connec-
ticut’s problems.”

Caucuses will be held Satur-
day in Kansas, the home state
of Gary Hart (of course that
wasn’t his name then, but you
know whoI mean).

Your past can come back to
haunt you, as Hart discovered
last week when The Wall Street
Journal paid a visit to his high
school in Ottawa, Kansas, and
found out about the time that he
cheated ona chemistry test.

‘He was indiscreet,’’ Lester
Hoffman, Hart’s chemistry
teacher, told the Journal. ‘‘He
and a friend broke into my
classroom at night and took a
copy of the examination. They
were C students, and they got
almost letter-perfect answers to
the 50 questions on that quiz. I
was suspicious, and I found out
what happened.”

It seems Hart started getting
away with things even then. “I

went to the principal,’’ Hoffman
continued, “and he said he
wouldn’t graduate either one of
them. But I said I would put
aside that exam and average
out all the others, and give them
that grade. That way, they both
got C’s. They never came to talk
to me about it.”

It doesn’t seem like that is the
only time that Hart has purloin-
ed ideas. As I read over his
issue positions, I’m reminded of
the comment which a producer
being interviewed on CBS’s ‘‘60
Minutes’”’ last Sunday made
about one of next season’s
television shows: “It’s new
because it’s new for the second
time.”

To make up for his Illinois
loss, you can be certain that
“Gary’s guerillas,’ as _ his
volunteers are called, will be
working in overdrive.

Funds will also be important.
New, special phone lines have
been set up for those wishing to
contribute: 1-800-USA-HART.
Don’t all dial at once, now.

Did you catch the television
coverage of Tuesday’s Illinois
primary? If you were in the
Cockpit, here’s what you miss-
ed

Network anchors can’t afford
to offend any viewers. ABC’s
Peter Jennings explained the
shading on a delegate map ‘‘for
those with non-color television
sets.”

In an interview with Dan
Rather of CBS, Hart said, ‘“‘If I
make only two mistakes in this
campaign, that’s a pretty good
record.’’ Fine. When should we
start counting?

Mondale, in an interview with
Roger Mudd of NBC: “I want to
compliment Sen. Hart and Rev.
Jackson on a good race.”’ Can
you spell ‘‘patronizing’’?

It’s hard to keep all the titles
straight. Jennings pointed out
the delegate count of ‘‘Senator
Mondale”’ (he was, once), and
Cable News Network’s Bernard
Shaw referred to ‘‘former
Senator Hart.”’ |

sion commercial on the air. The

the memorable phrase from it

‘Gary Hart is blown away in the Windy City

would be “‘big fluffy bun.”

Mar. 1 — Sweet Briar’s paper

responsiveness of the adminis-
tration which they title
“‘Where’s the Beef?’’ Clever.

Mar. 2-3 — At Fancy Dress,
W&L men who can’t find their

peatedly asking their friends,
‘“‘Where’s the beef?”

Mar. 10 — At a labor rally in
Illinois, AFL-CIO president
Lane Kirkland says: ‘You can
apply the burger test to Hart.
It’s a big bun, but where’s the
beef?”

Mar. 11 — On the advice of
campaign manager Robert
Beckel, Mondale says to Hart in
the Atlanta debate, “When I
hear your new ideas, I’m
reminded of that ad, ‘Where’s
the beef?’ ”’

Mar. 21 — On CNN’s “‘News-
night,’’ columnist Robert
Novak says of the ‘‘Where’s the
beef?” line: ‘‘I don’t think it’s
dignified. I don’t think it’s very
catchy. I think it’s a little tired
at this point.”

Amen!

Here’s the political outlook
for the next week as seen by
Mock Convention researchers:

KANSAS (C) — Hometown
boy Hart by a slim margin.
Mondale has spent a lot of
money in the state, and has had
an organization in place for a
year.

MONTANA (C) — Hart by a
hair. The state has strong con-
nections with Minnesota, which
helps Mondale.

VIRGINIA (C) — Southern
regional chairman Gene Wood
reports that the uncommitteed
slate will beat Mondale by a
razor’s edge. Hart will run well
in Northern Virginia, and
Jackson has bult a quite respec-
table organization in the state.

CONNECTICUT (P) —
Although popular widom (read:
network divination) says the
state is a Hart stronghold, the
Mock Convention has concluded
that Mondale will win by a slim
margin. Independent voters, a
usual source of strength for
Hart, are not allowed to vote in
the primary, and labor is -well
organized to support (en-
force?) the unions’ endorse-
ment of Mondale.

Six claim A-A honors

The hard work and
perseverance has paid off in
very large dividends for the
Washington and Lee swim
team. The Generals broke six
school records and six in-
dividuals earned All-America
status as W&L came in 15th
(out of 75 schools) at the NCAA
Division III Championships at
Emory University last week-
end.

“It was the best possible way
for the team to finish,’ said
W&L aquatics director Page
Remillard. ‘‘We’ve been work-
ing extremely hard since the
beginning of school and the
hard work has paid off.”

The six All-Americans are
senior Tim Rock, who swam the
1,650-yard freestyle in a time of
16:19.19 to finish 8th; freshman
Jay ReVille, who covered the
400-yard individual medley in a
shool-record 4:08.59 to finish
7th; junior Bobby Pearson,
senior Gary Meyer and sopho-
more Tim Stanford, who team-
ed with ReVille to break the
school record in the 800-free
relay with a time of 6:59.98 to
finish 8th; and Taber Smith,
who anchored the 400-free relay
team, with Pearson, Meyer and
Stanford, which finished 8th and
broke the school record with a
time of 3:09.04. All finishes in
the top 12 at the nationals earn
All-America status.

The Generals also broke three
school records that did not
break into the top 12 times.

ReVille swam the 200-yard in-
dividual medley in 1:58.95 and
finished 20th. Stanford covered
the 100-yard butterfly in 51.8
seconds to finish 14th and the
200-yard butterfly in 1:56.53 to
finish 20th.

“I’m extremely happy for all
six, but it is really gratifying to
see the seniors, Rock and
Meyer, go out in style,” said
Remillard. ‘Both of them had
outstanding careers and de-
served everything they got.’”’

Rock, who came in 5th in the
1,650 as a freshman to earn All-
America status, came full cir-
cle by making it again and
beating his freshman time as a
senior. ‘‘He finished his sculp-
ture. It was a perfect ending for
him. He set his goal to make it
again and he achieved it in
great style,’’ said Remillard.

Meyer, W&L’s lone All-
America last year, capped off
his career with four All-
America awards. He was also
part of W&L’s fourth-place 400-
relay team in 1982.

Stanford was nearly perfect.
He swam four races and had
two individual school records
and was a part of two relay
records.

ReVille, who also swam in
four events, showed that he has
the potential to be a great swim-
mer. ‘He has the talent and the
desire and could be a four-year
All-America,” said Remillard.

Smith and Pearson swam per-
sonal bests in their relay efforts

and earned their first All-
America awards.

“These guys should be proud
of what they have achieved.
They not only wanted to do well

. for themselves, but they wanted

to represent the school and their
teammates and put W&L back
on the swimming map. I feel
that they have done all of that
and more,” said Remillard.

Track dominates opening foes

By MICHAEL MCALLISTER
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
track and field team jumped out
of the blocks quickly this season
by establishing a 3-0 record with
some very impressive victories.

On St. Patrick’s Day, the
Generals traveled to North
Carolina and opened the 1984
season with a dominating 99-39
win over Davidson. By winning
12 of 17 events, W&L proved to
be much too powerful for the
Wildcats.

Junior captain Chris Ives was
the highlight of the meet, cap-
turing the 100-meter dash, the
110-meter high hurdles and the
400-meter hurdles to win a triple
for the Generals.

“For an early meet we per-
formed well,” said head coach
Norris Aldridge. ‘‘It was a team
effort in every respect. We had
nine different winners and
many second and third places.”

Aldridge also noted that
Davidson has been better in the
past, and that the Generals are
going to see tougher competi-
tion as the season progresses.

Besides Ives, W&L got win-
ning efforts from Billy
Rhinehart in the triple jump,
John Burlingame in the long
jump, Scott Doyle in the javelin,
Frank Pittman in the 5,000
meters, Mark Pembroke at 800
meters, Angus McBryde at
1,500 meters, Derrick Freeman
at 400 meters, the mile relay
team of Mark Chapman, Chris
McGowan, Pembroke and
Freeman, and, in his first meet,
freshman Tom Murray in the
shot put.

“It just goes to show that if we
are to become a good team and
are going to win, we need a
team effort,’’ Aldridge said.

That feeling proved to be very
true as the Generals hosted both
Bridgewater and Eastern Men-
nonite in a tri-meet at W&L’s
Wilson Field on Tuesday.

It was Bridgewater’s first
meet of the season, and
although Coach Aldridge had no
knowledge of the Mennonite
squad, he still felt the two rivals
would provide a tough meet
with no team capable of running
away with the win. Coach
Aldridge was pleasantly sur-
prised, though, as the Generals
took eight of the 17 events, scor-
ing 91 points to Bridgewater’s 56
and EMC’s 32.

The difference was the
Generals’ depth and the team
effort they produced. The
Generals placed numerous
seconds and thirds along with a
sweep of the 1,500 meters, led
by Angus McBryde. W&L also
gained first-place finishes from
Townes Pressler in the high
jump, Paul Chapman in the 800
meters, Charlie Alcorn in the
discus, and John Carder in the
pole vault. Billy Rhinehart in
the triple jump and the mile
relay team of Chapman, Mc-
Gowan, Pembroke and Free-
man were the only members
that repeated victories in the
same events that they won at
Davidson.

The first three General vic-
tories were convincing enough
to put the ODAC title within
reach, although the team still
must face ODAC powerhouses
Lynchburg and Catholic. Both
of these schools will be tough,
especially Lynchburg, whom
the Generals just beat out for
the 1984 ODAC Indoor title.

Saturday, the Generals will
compete in the Liberty Baptist
Invitational.

to the video tape

the decision has set an un-
healthy precedent, that the TV
instant replay machine will
become the referee of the
future. I’m sorry (not really),
but first of all these guys are
overreacting. As Bill Millsaps
of the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch said, the decision by the
refs ‘‘made good sense.”’ The of-
ficials were in error, they
realized it (they are to be com-
mended for doing that), and TV
was the logical and only means
of correcting their mistake. So,
where’s the beef? We’ve got
television; but some mindless
rules committee demagogue
has placed an_ inexplicable
taboo on the use of instant
replays, even when using the
dreaded video tape would be the
common sense thing to do.
Frankly, after some of the of-
ficiating I’ve witnessed, the
replay would be a prayer well
answered. This is not to say ins-
tant replays should take the

place of an official, but it seems
fairly accurate to say that the
officials cannot see everything.
The cameras are an aid in a
situation like this, without a
doubt. Let’s take advantage of
what our technology has
brought us. It is not hocum to
say the only good game is a fair
game. It is plain and simple
blind stubbornness to ignore an
opportunity to make a game
fair...

In the Crease magazine has

sion III status in the near

- Lacrossers mired in 3-game skid

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

A couple of crucial situations
in two games over the week has
left the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team on the short end
of the stick, still searching for
its second victory of 1984.

Yesterday, the Generals were
handed a 14-4 defeat by Dela-
ware, dropping their season
mark to 1-3 after Saturday’s
18-7 loss at Maryland.

Wednesday’s contest turned
on a three-minute mandatory
penalty on the Generals’ Rich
Schoenberg. Daly said
Schoenberg dropped his gloves
— an automatic penalty — after
he was elbowed by a Delaware
player.

The Blue Hens scored three
times while Schoenberg sat out,
as they came back from a 2-0
early General lead to go in front
6-2 at the half.

“We came undone at that
point,” General head coach
Dennis Daly said. ‘I thought
things were moving pretty well
upto there.”

In College Park, Md., Satur-
day the Generals stayed even
with Maryland for nearly two
quarters, but a 12-3 second-half
Terp barrage gave W&L its se-
cond loss ina week.

“I felt that they controlled the
game rather than W&L con-
trolling the game. We didn’t
take control of the game
because we didn’t score when
we had early man-up oppor-
tunities, and that hurt us,’’ Daly
said.

“The disappointment was
that I felt good and I think the
team felt good going into the
game, but you come away and
Maryland was just the better
team’”’ Daly continued.

The Terps proved true their
reputation as an_ explosive
team, scoring four goals in a
two-and-a-half minute spurt
midway through the first
period.

Daly said Maryland gained
confidence as they started to
shoot, while the Generals’ lack
of success coupled with some
saves by Terp goalie Kevin
O'Leary had W&L_ shooters
hesitating before their shots.

W&L turned things around
with a score from sophomore
atackman Steve McGrath off an
excellent feed of junior Rod
Santomassimo at 14:21 of the
first quarter.

The Generals pulled within
one goal twice in period two,
getting a pair of scores from
Santomassimo and another
from attackman Lee Heimert.
Santomassimo’s goal at 10:22 of
the quarter put W&L in striking
distance at 5-4.

Then the roof caved in.

‘Their goals were big psycho-
logical advantage goals,’’ Daly
said, pointing to Terp goals 6, 7
and 8 as the turning points.

With 3:36 to go in the half, the
Terps’ Jean Steffen scored a
sixty-yard open-net goal to
make the score 6-4.

Then Maryland took quick ad-
vantage of a late first-half
holding penalty that left the
Generals in a mandown situa-
tion to start the second half.
Senior Jim Ellis scored with
just 16 seconds gone in the final
half.

The last straw came a
minute-and-a-half later when,
playing a man down, Maryland
middie Matt McGeady scooped
up a ground ball, raced down-
field on the fast break and dish-
ed to Jay Harkey for the short-
handed goal.

The Terps scored five un-
answered goals in the first 6:49
of the third quarter. Starting
goalie John DiDuro was then
replaced by Phil Aiken, who
was in turn replaced by
freshman John Church, as the
three faced 51 Maryland shots,
32 coming in the second half.

It was the second time in as
many outings that W&L faced a
hot goalie. The Terps’ Kevin
O’Leary made the best of his
surname on St. Patrick’s Day.
O’Leary faced the brunt of the
Generals’ attack in the first
quarter, at one point saving five
shots ina row.

Reinjuring a toe in quarter
two, O’Leary stepped out, and
teammate Kevin Bilger stood
between the pipes and turned
away four W&L attempts in the
remainder of the _ period.
O'Leary returned to finish the
second half.

The Terps’ other leaders in-

assisted on six Maryland
scores, Jim Ellis and Steffen,

who combined for half the
team’s goals.

The Generals got fine efforts
from Santomassimo (two goals,
one assist), Lee Heimert (two
goals) and Sandy Brown (one

goal, one assist).

W&L looks to rebound out of
its slump Saturday at Wilson
Field as the team faces-off
against the Towson State Tigers
at2p.m.

“It’s just been a matter of a
group getting to know each
other. Unfortunately, it’s been
coming through losses and not
wins,’’ Daly explained.

The Tigers feature strong
performers inseniors Gavin
Moag in goal, and Mark Miller
on attack and junior midfielder
John Connolly.

The Generals’ are seeking
revenge from last season’s 12-8
Towson victory. W&L leads 13-7
in the series dating back to 1963.
The Generals have won 10 of the
last 12 meetings.

Netters knock off GWU

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team scored a major upset
Sunday against Division I
George Washington University
by a score of 5-4 at the W&L ten-
nis courts.

The Generals (6-3) also pick-
ed up victories against Ran-
dolph-Macon, Averett and In-
diana University of Penn-
sylvania last week. The Gener-
als did lose a match, however,
at William & Mary.

“It was the biggest win of the
year so far,”’ said head tennis
coach Gary Franke of W&L’s
upset win over GWU. The No. 1
doubles team of Craig Cannon
and Roby Mize secured the vic-
tory with a win in the final
match of the day.

‘“‘We just played better than :

they did,” explained Franke.

Also on Sunday, W&L picked
up a win against IUP. Coach
Franke used younger varsity
players and several junior var-
sity players in the match, which
W&L won 6-3. Franke said his
purpose in using the mixed line-
up was to give some of his
younger players more ex-
perience in match play.

The Generals traveled to
Ashland on Monday to play
Randolph-Macon in an ODAC
match. W&L swept R-M 9-0 and
improved its ODAC record to
2-0. In that victory, the
Generals won five three-set
matches.

Tuesday, W&L defeated
Averett College by a score of
6-3. According to Franke, the
match with Averett was an

~w, Y Ye = Y wr ~~ Y sor 7 or Y = ~~ are

  
    
   
   
   
     
   

unexpected but helpful chal-
lenge with a lot of close mat-
ches.

The Generals received a
minor setback last Friday in an
8-1 loss at William & Mary.
Franke described the W&M pro-
gram as stronger than W&L’s.

Craig Cannon has established
an individual record of 6-1 at the
No. 1 singles position. His vic-
tories include impressive wins
against the No. 1 players for
Lehigh, William and Mary and
George Washington.

Franke agrees that Cannon is

playing exceptionally well and

believes that his success is the
result of a newly developed
mental toughness and individu-
al work on his groundstrokes.

The Generals played Rich- '

mond today at 3 p.m. and will
play Christopher Newport Fri-
day at 3 p.m., Salisbury State
Saturday at 10 a.m. and VMI
Tuesday at 3 p.m. All matches
will be played at the W&L ten-
nis courts.

Franke believes that this
week’s schedule will be ex-
tremely tough for the Generals.
“‘These are big matches for us if
we want to be considered for the
national tournament,’ he said.

Golfers 15th at JMU

By MIKE HASSINGER
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee golf
team finished 15th out of a field
of 24 squads in its first tourna-
ment of the 1984 season, the
James Madison University In-
vitational, last weekend. The
team title was captured by Divi-
sion I Maryland.

Coach Buck Leslie hopes for
improvement and said, ‘‘I’d
certainly like to see us finish in
the top half of a tournament at
least.” He cited first tourna-
ment jitters, lack of tournament
play and low concentration as
factors for the team’s sub-par
showing.

He does think that the match
was good experience for his un-
tried team and hopes that this
match was the starting point for
a team that will do well this
season. ‘‘We just need more
playing time,’’ said Leslie.

The experienced golfers, cap-
tains Whit Kelly and Bruce
Blythe, both gave the consistent
performances they were ex-
pected to give, finishing at 156

and 154 respectively. Their con-
sistent play is what Leslie has
been seeking from his team all
along.

Turner Friedman and Steve
Jones are expected to improve
their scores. Friedman shot 165
and Jones shot 168, scores
which Leslie said will be whittl-
ed down.

‘Bob Sloan played well. He
delivered a good overall perfor-
mance,’’ Coach Leslie said.

Although freshman Mike
Friedman, the younger of the
brothers, and Sloan played the
fifth and sixth positions, those
positions are only tentatively
filled. Had last week’s match
not been cancelled Leslie feels
that he would have a clearer
view of who would be playing
those slots. The added ex-
perience would have given a
more definitive view of a team
whose needs remain to be seen.

Today’s play will match W&L
against Bluefield in a home
match at the Lexington Country
Club. Coach Leslie expects good
things from his team for today’s
effort.

Baseball falls to BC, 11-4

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team dropped two of
three ODAC home games last
week.

The generals split a double-
header with Emory and Henry
on Saturday and lost to
Bridgewater Tuesday after-
noon.

In the first game against
Emory and Henry, W&L right-
hander Bill White turned in a
- stellar performance, allowing
only two hits and one earned
run in the Generals’ 7-2 victory.

Freshman third baseman
Milam Turner provided most of
the Generals’ firepower with
four RBIs and two hits.

In the nightcap, the Generals’
bats went cold in crucial situa-
tions as Emory and Henry won
6-0.

Emory and Henry pushed five
runs across the plate in the
third inning against starting
pitcher Kirk Breen.

Freshman lefthander Bill

Schoettelkotte pitched five
scoreless innings in relief of
Breen, allowing only two hits.

“We found our strengths and
weaknesses all in one day,”
said W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock. ‘In the first game, we
played with poise and con-
fidence and did everything
right. We hit, fielded, pitched
the way it is supposed to be
done.”’

“In the second game, it seem-
ed a different team took the
field. We didn’t hit well and our
pitching let us down,” Murdock
said.

On Tuesday W&L spotted
Bridgewater a five-run lead in
the first inning and never
recovered, losing 11-4.

Bridgewater added two runs
in the third inning to extend its
lead to7-0.

W&L answered by scoring
three runs in the bottom of the
third, as White had a two-run
double and shortstop Dave War-
renfeltz a one-run single. The
Generals could have reduced
the Eagles’ lead even more but

 

failed to get a hit with the bases
loaded and two outs.

The Generals scored their
last run in the fourth inning,
cutting Bridgewater’s lead to
7-4. Once again, W&L was only
one hit away from a big inning
as two men were left stranded

.on base.

Bridgewater added two runs
in the fifth inning and single
runs in the sixth and eighth in-
nings to put the game out of
reach at 11-4.

Freshman lefthander Randy
Brown settled after his shaky
first inning and pitched well
during the next innings before
being relieved by sophomore
Peter Detlefs in the ninth.

Lefthander Greg Rexrode got
the win for Bridgewater, whose
record now stands at 3-2-1.

W&L fell to 4-5 (1-2 in ODAC
play) with the loss.

The Generals face ODAC foe
Lynchburg Thursday in Lynch-
burg at 3 p.m. The team returns
to Lexington to host Randolph-
Macon in a doubleheader begin-
ning at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at
Smith Field.

My View

(continued from page 3)

all asked, did Delaware and
New Jersey work 20 hours a day
churning out unnatural fibers?
The answer, as we found out
upon arriving in Princeton, is
supply-and-demand. Polyester
blazers in earthy colors seem to
be in at Northern state schools.
Indeed, even the Princetonians
we met wore grubby, un-
WASPy looking outfits. Tsk,
tsk.

To give you an idea of the
situation: as ‘host nation,’ we
expected to be full participants
in the dizzying social round. So
we packed black tie for the
receptions. Well. AC-DC_ T-
shirts were de riguer at the big
functions. Why, some coarse
young woman snarled, were we
so snazzed up (her words)? We
politely explained that since the
program had not specified at-
tire, we naturally assumed that
black tie was required. We were
also asked what the funny black
buttons on our shirt fronts
were; and one girl told Gerald
Shepherd that she’d never even
dreamt of black tassel loafers
before. I believe she was one of
the Michigan State crowd.

That was the same night
Bradford Stengel and I nearly
had to defend the Stars and
Bars with our fists. There were
actually people who objected to
our posting it at our table at the
reception. They must have been

fuming when, later in the eve-
ning, the Virginia schools got
together, gathered ‘round the
flag, and sang ‘Dixie’ and “The
Bonnie Blue Flag.’ One final
note on the reception. They
simply do not play beach music
up North. Atall.

From this experience, I have
drawn the following morals,
which I now pass on to you all. I
think they may come in handy.

FIRST: Don’t go North if you
can help it.

SECOND: Stock up on bour-
bon and cigars before you cross
the Line. I recommend Dixie li-
quors in D.C.

THIRD: Stay away from girls
from Muehlenburg College.
Miss Argentina all but persuad-
ed me to restructure the inter-
national debt structure in her
favor.

FOURTH: Always carry a
flask. It is precisely that sort of
preparedness that got us an in-
vite to Nationals. Their
observer likes bourbon.

FIFTH. Always stay at the
Hyatt, especially if the school is
paying.

This year, only Hollins, Miss
Argentina, and us-all stayed
there.

Boy, life is rough.

With these recommendations

' borne in mind, even in the wilds

of New Joisey, you will be able
to survive with flair, in the best
traditions of W&L. Cheers.

SAB

(continued from page 4)

the social life at Washington
and Lee could be improved,”’ he
said. ‘‘We hope to provide more
regularly-scheduled events.’’

Smith said the chairman
would “‘have the ultimate say,”’
while the executive director
would ‘‘do more of _ the
legwork.”

‘“‘There’s a certain amount of
structure for the directors,’’ he
explained, ‘‘but the other two
need to have a little bit of
latitude.”

He said the chairman would
have the broadest authority and

. would stay in close touch with

the executive director, who in
turn would work on a day-to-day
basis with the seven directors.

“There has to be someone
with ultimate responsibility,’
Haywood said. ‘“Co-chairmen
don’t work. We’ve tried it.”’

“You may get a situation
where you have two equally
qualified people,’ Smith said.
“‘T still wouldn’t make them co-
chairmen.”’

Haywood said he felt the EC
should continue to appoint the
SAB leadership. ‘‘We are their
subcommittee,”’ he said. ‘‘They
should appoint our officers and
members.”

He said he would favor an
election subcommittee of the
EC similar to this year’s
finance committee to review
candidates for SAB positions.

Smith said that ‘‘ideally’’ the
previous year’s chairman
would have some input into the
selection of his successor. He
would then like to see a ‘“‘time
lag’ during which the new
chairman is consulted on the
selection of the executive direc-
tor and director posts.

He said the new structure
would be weakened if people
were appointed for ‘“‘political
reasons,’’ which both he and
Haywood say has been done in

the past.

“It upsets me when someone
gets appointed because he’s a
good guy,”’ Smith said. ‘‘A lot of
times a person can be better
qualified because he doesn’t fit
the mold of everyone else.”’

“By and large, most of the EC
doesn’t know what happens in
the SAB,”’ he continued.

“I would like to see the EC
display a little faith in the
Board. I understand their posi-
tion and responsibility, but they

can’t possibly know all the de-

tails and aspects of our pro-
posal. A

“It’s not as if we decided on it
out of the blue. All we want is to
do the best job we can and rem-
edy some of the problems that
we can see.”

Haywood sounded a similar
note. ‘‘Most of the people on the
EC don’t understand how we
operate,” he said. ‘‘We have the
job of explaining to them what
it’s like now, what’s wrong with
it, and what we want changed.”

‘I see Monday’s action by the
EC as a commitment to the SAB
that they recognize that a struc-
tural change is necessary,’’ he
said.

‘A lot of details still need to
be settled,” he added. ‘‘We’re in
no hurry. We’ll take the time to
work it out.”

Haywood said that while he is
“the strongest advocate on
campus of providing a high
quality of social life for in-
dependents,’’ he would ‘‘ab-
solutely not”’ favor a director in
charge of independent affairs.

‘‘We’re concerned with pro-
viding social activities for the
entire university,” he said.
“We're not going to bend the
organization out of shape for
special interests.”

He said he had the same
response when SABU requested
SAB funds last year.

“There comes a point where

the allocation of funds is
disproportionate to the number
of people involved,’ he con-
tinued.

“IT agree that independents
have some special needs, such
as the scheduling of IM teams.
There’s room for that in the
SAB if it’s needed. But I think in
the long run, the independents
will come out better if we con-
centrate our efforts on the stu-
dent body as a whole.”’

Haywood said that a similar
restructuring was proposed a
year ago, and that he and Smith
have been refining it all year.

He said they were ‘“‘the two
most interested,” the only two
junior officers, and the juniors
with the most seniority on the
Board.

Smith said that the proposal
was ‘‘a culmination of a lot of
discussion” and that both of
them agreed on the needed
changes. _

Calendar-——

(continued from page 1)

55-minute classes, but noted
that proposal did receive twice
as much support as any of the
other changes.

One reason cited by Feldman
for the large number of students
voting in favor of keeping all
aspects of the calendar and
registration the same was the
fact that the status quo choices
were all listed on the left side of
the ballot, and all the changes
were on the right side. Thus a
student could circle the four
proposals on the left side
without really studying the
alternatives, Feldman said.

Feldman said he was pleased
with the turnout for the poll,
conducted in conjunction with
class elections. Feldman added
that turnout would have been
even higher if seniors had had
class officer elections.
