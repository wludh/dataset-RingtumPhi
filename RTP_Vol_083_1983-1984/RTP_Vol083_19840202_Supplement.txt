VMI G WGL: A quiet rivalry

Relationship spans riots
in 20s to parties in 80s

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

Legends abound of the abuse
heaped on Virginia Military In-
stitute cadets by Washington
and Lee students, and vice-
versa. And, according to retired
W&L professor Dr. Charles
Turner, most probably are true.

“When I started teaching
here (1946) things were some-
what antagonistic between the
student bodies,’’ remembered
Turner.

‘‘In sports events and such, I
remember them ending up in
fights, sometimes. And I can
remember when the cadets
used to march to church on Sun-
days. The frats use to mock
them, trying to get them out of
step.”’

Turner also remembers “‘Vee
Mees, as we call them,’’ sneak-
ing over to “‘borrow”’ flags from
Lee Chapel, and W&L students
doing the same in Jackson Hall.

“They were even antagonistic
in church,” he recalled. ‘‘In the
baptist church, we had a special
place, the balcony, reserved for
them. When the church used to
vote on something, even on
something like new members,
they would all vote no, in a
block. But we just used to laugh,
because their vote didn’t count

much anyway.”

Relations between the two
schools had a much more
auspicious start, though. In
fact, VMI was originally a com-
ponent of Washington College.

According to Ollinger Cren-
shaw’s ‘‘General Lee’s Col-
lege,” in 1836 the Virginia
legislature passed a_ bill
“reorganizing the Lexington
arsenal and establishing a
Military school in connection
with Washington College.”’

In 1838, the Virginia Military
Institute was officially orga-
nized. The Washington College
Board of Trustees used money
in its Cincinnati fund to appoint
the Cincinnati Professor of the
College. They elected Colonel
Francis H. Smith, who also
became commandant.

Before the two schools would
formally separate, the Wash-
ington College trustees would
consider, and defeat, a proposal
to combine the two schools into
“The Washington Institute of
Virginia.” When the formal
separation occurred, Dr.
George Armstrong, professor of
chemistry, wrote the Rock-
bridge County delegate to the
General Assembly that VMI’s
independence would ‘‘convert it

_into a College which shall be a

rival of Washington College, of

 

   

 

 

a

 

  

such a character that the
rivalry, between them must
eventually result in the
downfall of one of them or the
other.”’

By the time of the Civil War,
antagonism had clearly begun.

 

Three times (before the battle
of New Market) the cadets were
called into service. And three
times, after seeing no action
and not firing a shot, they
returned to Lexington amidst
the mocking and jibes of
Washington College students.

By the turn of the century,
rocky relations also had
become prevalent on _ the
athletic fields.

“One time, years and years
ago, students broke out in a riot
between the two schools at an
athletic event,’ said W&L
athletic director William
McHenry. ‘That was back
when the rivalry was intense.”’

After that incident, athletic
competition between the two
virtually ceased, said
McHenry. Even in the early
1950s, when McHenry was a stu-
dent here, the wisdom of
athletic competition still was
questionable. The two teams
relented to scrimmage, but it
was closed to student spec-
tators.

Competition in all sports ex-
cept those subsidized by
scholarships at VMI — football,
basketball, and track — was not
resumed until 1971. ‘‘Even when
we were subsidized in athletics,
when we were usually much
stronger, we still didn’t play
them,” said McHenry.

Dr. Turner noted that interac-
tion used to be prevalent among
the schools in the academic
spectrum. He was one of many
professors that used to be in-
volved in a professor exchange
program between the two col-
leges.

But even that is minimal to-
day, according to Dean of
Students Lewis John.

 

“It is too bad there isn’t
(more academic interaction),
but our different natures
preclude a lot of it,’’ he ex-
plained.

Different academic calendars
and daily schedules have
limited the number of pro-
grams, such as a student taking
classes at the other school, said
John. ‘‘It’s not impossible, but it
is difficult. There are a lot of
barriers,” he said.

The major source of aca-
demic cooperation, he added,
has been the cross-referencing
of the card catalogues at the
libraries of each school.

But the degree. of segregation
between the two schools was
made particularly clear to VMI
Chaplain Charles Caudill last
year during a tragic time at
VMI. Three cadets, as well as a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege student, were killed in an
automobile accident on U.S. 11,
just north of Lexington. Not a
single W&L student attended
the memorial service at VMI.

‘“‘W&L and VMI are so close,
we need to get to know each
other more,”’ Chaplain Caudill
said at the time while summing
up the history of the two
schools. The only growth he
said he has seen between the
two schools is their Christian
communities. é

“If two students, one from
VMI and one from W&L, had
been in the car, I don’t know if
there would have been a joint
service,’ he concluded. ‘‘It
would be interesting to see what
would happen. I don’t know.”’

Exactly how is life across the
way? Ask any number of VMI
cadets and one will get any
number of answers: these,
unrealistic, disciplined were a
few of the adjectives used to
describe life at our brother
campus.

If a man from W&L were ask-
ed to trade places with a cadet
for a week and then describe the
experience, ‘“‘harsh’’ probably
would be the predominant ad-
jective used.

Harsh, you say. Well, try this
day on for size. At 6:40 each
morning, 10 minutes of bugle
calls wake the men up and the
fun doesn’t stop until 11:30 each
evening with taps. In between,
there’s morning assembly and
the march to breakfast and then
bugle calls every half hour to
announce each class change.
Cadets can leave the Post from
12:05 to 4:15 on Mondays,

Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Fridays, if they have no after-
noon classes, but at 4:05 there
are 10 minutes of bugle calls to
herald inspection, drill,
athletics or parade.

On Wednesdays, cadets are
allowed to leave from 4 p.m. un-

p.m.

The legend of New Market

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

On May 15, 1864, 247 cadets
charged into battle at New
Market, and thus changed the
history of the Virginia Military
Institute. The annual recogni-
tion of that event is still the
most revered celebration at
VMI.

The Battle of New Market
was the climactic point of Union
General Franz Sigel’s Shenan-
doah Valley campaign of 1864.
General Ulysses S. Grant was
then battling General Robert E.
Lee at Spotsylvania in his quest
to take the Confederate capital
at Richmond, and he realized
the implications that a
simultaneous victory in the
Valley could have.

Not only was the Valley the
breadbasket of the South, but
Sigel could also capture the ma-
jor railroad transportation
centers of Staunton and Lynch-
burg. If victorious, he would on-
ly be 60 miles west of Lee’s left
flank at Spotsylvania. “I pro-
pose to fight it out on this line if
it takes all summer,” said
Grant.

The force charged with stop-
ping Sigel was led by Major-
General John C. Breckinridge,
the former vice-president and
1860 presidential candidate. As
he advanced toward the en-
counter from southwest Vir-
ginia, he found himself greatly
outmanned. The Augusta and
Rockingham County Reserves
had been called up, but that
number was still insufficient.
On May 2, General Francis H.
Smith, superintendent of VMI,
offered the services of the
cadets. On May 10,
Breckinridge called the cadets
into service.

That afternoon, they had par-
ticipated in a Lexington
ceremony commemorating the

death of Thomas ‘Stonewall’
Jackson, a former professor of
physics at VMI, a year earlier
at Chancellorsville, Va.

The cadets cheered as they
broke from ranks upon hearing
the news. They had grown de-
jected listening to reports of the
war and burying local dead
while never being called
themselves. On three occasions
the cadets had been summoned
to oppose the Union raids of
Brigadier-General William
Averell, but each time failed to
find him or fire a shot, return-
ing to the jibes of Lexington
residents. In March, they had
even called themselves _ to-
gether into a mass meeting and
passed a resolution offering
their services to Lee.

The youthful cadet corps was
led by Colonel Scott Shipp, only
24 himself. The veterans teased
the cadets, calling them the
‘‘Seedcorn Battalion.’”’ A
regimental band struck up the
tune ‘“‘Rockabye Baby”’ and the
veterans cradled their rifles in
their arms and sang along.

The confrontation between
Union and Confederate troops
occured May 15 at New Market.
Breckinridge hoped to keep the
cadets in reserve, vowing only
to use them if necessary.

As the battle reached its
peak, the Confederate center
was on the verge of collapse.
Major Charles Semple told
Breckinridge that the cadets
were the only hope, but he
allegedly responded, ‘‘No
Charley, this will not do, they
are only children and I cannot
expose them to such fire as our
center will receive.”

Semple tried to contract the
lines, but soon returned saying
that it was impossible. Breckin-
ridge, with a tear in his eye,
said, ‘‘Put the boys in...and God
forgive me for the order.’’ It is

said that he turned his back as
the cadets charged into battle.

Suddenly, Sigel attempted a
charge with the 34th Massachu-
setts leading the way. The
cadets repulsed them, though,
and Captain Henry A. Wise,
who replaced the injured Shipp,
jumped up and_ =yelled
“Charge!”

The cadets moved forward
like a human avalanche. As
they rushed forward, the
ground, like a swamp from the
rain, literally sucked the shoes
from their feet. ‘‘The Field of
Lost Shoes’’ did not stop them;
and the left and right flanks
rallied around. Soon Sigel’s
whole line was under attack,
retreating, Sigel screaming
orders in German. Unfortunate-
ly, none of his men spoke Ger-
man.

Triumphantly, Oliver
“Brave” Evans waved the flag
of VMI from the top of a cap-
tured caisson from Captain
Albert Von Kleiser’s battery.
Future U.S. Senator Charles
Faulkner took 23 prisoners
himself.

The victory was a costly one:
47 cadets were wounded. Ten
were dead. The cadets quickly
became romantic heroes. Lee
thanked them for protecting his
flank, Breckinridge praised
their courageous actions. Presi-
dent Jefferson Davis addressed
them in Richmond, “Stone-
wall’ Jackson’s old brigade
paid tribute to them, the Con-
federate Congress commended
them and thousands cheered
them. Breckinridge, later ap-
pointed Confederate Secretary
of War, would always refer to
them as ‘‘my cadets.’’

On that day, they had saved
Staunton, protected Lee’s left
flank while he fought at Spot-
sylvania, created a legend and
made a name for the Virginia
Military Institute.

 

Controversy rases
over Rat line

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

On the Chinese calendar,
“The Year of the Rat’’ (year
4682), began Sunday, but you
won’t find anyone celebrating
over at the Virginia Military In-
stitute.

That’s because the freshmen
have become the focus of a bit-
ter conflict between the In-
stitute’s administration and the
upper classes.

“Things are getting pretty
slack around here,’’ a cadet in
the guardroom said Tuesday of
the treatment this year’s Rats
are receiving as a result of ad-
ministration policy.

The Institute is run by the
Superintendent, General Sam S.
Walker, and the Commandant
of Cadets, Col. Harold B.
Snyder Jr.

The head of student govern-
ment is the First Class Presi-
dent, Jamie Edward Clark, an
English major from Sharps-
ville, Penn., who will be in the
Marine Corps.

From the beginning of the
year, there were reports of
“friction’”’ and “‘lack of com-
munication’ between the two
sides.

said at the time that the ‘“‘whole
issue stems from the fact...that
the Administration is bending
over backwards to keep Rats
from leaving.”

The official count at integra-
tion time showed that 43 Rats
had left, but the Cadet said that
the actual figure was somewhat
higher.

The newspaper said that for
each Rat that had left at that
point in the year, the Institute
lost about $8,000 in reim-
bursements to the parents and
loss in state support. Clark said
he was concerned that when the
system gets easier, the ‘‘quality
of the product drops.”’

The First Class acquiesced to
integration reluctantly. ‘They
have listened to me, and
understand we don’t have a
choice, fight or not,”’ Clark said.

An editorial in the Cadet the
following week said the effect of
administration policy was ‘‘to
ram rat integration, in both
ranks and the mess hall, down
the Corps’ throat. Little, if any,
consideration was given to the
First Class,’ which normally
runs the Rat line.

 

‘The whole issue stems from the

fact. .. that the Administration is

bending over backwards

to keep Rats from leaving.’

 

In an interview in eariy Oc-
tober with The V.M.I. Cadet,
the student newspaper, Clark
took a conciliatory tone, saying
that ‘“‘a portion of it was our
fault.”

However, he pointed out the
conflict he faced in having to
follow orders from the admin-
istration as well as trying to ac-
commodate the many wishes of
the cadets.

On Oct. 24, the dispute
escalated when the separate
Rat ranks were dissolved and
the freshmen were ‘‘integrated
into the Old Corps.” In recent
times, this has taken place
much later in the year, after
“breakout,”” when the Rats
achieve fourth class status.

Several nights earlier, the
First Class had voted ‘‘over-
whelmingly’’ against pre-
breakout integration. Accord-
ing to an account in the Cadet,
at Supper Roll the Thursday
night before, by ‘‘throwing his
Regimental Executive Officer’s

collar brass to the floor, Clark .

dramatically proved his sin-
cerity in carrying out the
desires of the class.”’
Integration took place as
scheduled, however, and Clark

On Oct. 28, Clark met with the
VMI Board of Visitors, and
received a vote of no con-
fidence.

The next week, he outlined for
the First Class the options
available to it, including “step-
ping off.”

“The Bullet,”’ known as “The
Rat Bible,” defines a ‘‘step off”’
as “‘the ultimate act of protest
by the Corps of Cadets in de-
fiance of an unfavorable ad-
ministrative policy.”

At the meeting with the First
Class, Clark pointed out that ‘‘a
step off could result in a
dismissal of some members of
the class.”’

In two separate votes that
night, approximately half the
class expressed its approval of
integration, so further protests
were not pursued.

Last week, the administration
(known to Cadets as ‘‘Smith
Hall’’) stated that in the future,
the First Class would no longer
be permitted to work out the
Rats in any manner.

In addition, the Rat Dis-
ciplinary Committee is now per-
mitted to meet only once a week
for half an hour.

First Class reaction has not
yet been determined.

Alumni help cadets

with placement

Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute
alumni play an important role
in assisting cadets find job op-
portunities, Lt. Col. Royce E.
Jones, director of cadet affairs
and placement, said in an inter-
view last week.

About 300 VMI alumni assist
the placement office in helping
caydets find jobs, Jones said.
Alumni not only alert cadets to
possible job openings, but also
do such things as house cadets
who are in a city for a job inter-
view and lecture on aspects of
finding a job, Jones said.

Alumni inform the placement
office of job openings in their

A cadet can specify his
employment interest and even a
geographical preference to the
computer, and receive a print-
out of alumni matching the
specifications who might have
information on job openings,
Jones said.

“Everyone uses something
that fits their situation. A lot of
people are using computers.
The computer just makes it
easier to organize,’’ Jones said.

On occasion, the placement
office also will send out the
resumes of cadets to companies
that request information on
future graduates in certain
fields, Jones said. Unless the
company specifically requests
resumes for certain individuals,

‘ That kind of contact is like having

many sets of eyes instead of just one’

 

own companies and companies
they do business with, Jones
said. The pool of VMI alumni is
too small to provide enough job
openings for graduating cadets
in their own companies alone,
Jones explained.

“That kind of contact is like
having many sets of eyes in-
stead of just one guy,’’ Jones
said.

Jones describes the place-
ment office’s role as being that
of a ‘“‘middle-man’”’ who finds
out about jobs and informs like-
ly candidates of the openings.
The placement office might
suggest that the two parties get
together, but after that it is up
to the cadet, said Jones.

“We purposely don’t want
them to think that we get them
jobs. The responsibility of get-
ting the job is with the cadet,”
Jones emphasized.

In order to spread informa-
tion about job openings and
possible job applicants, the
placement office utilizes
several sophisticated methods.

Jones said the placement of-
fice sends out a bulletin to both
alumni who have volunteered to
assist in placement and to
cadets who have registered
with the placement office. The
bulletin provides information
on both job openings and brief
summaries of the credentials of
cadets looking for jobs.

Starting this year, the place-
ment office also has begun to
use several computer programs
to cross reference cadets seek-
ing jobs with possible sources of
jobs, Jones said. A similar pro-
cedure had been used previous-
ly; however, the cross referenc-
ing had to be done by hand, he
said.

the placement office will send
the company the resumes of
every registered cadet in that
field, he added.

“One thing we don’t do is try
to judge who is a good engineer.
We don’t pick out individual
Students,’ Jones emphasized.

About 60 cadets register each
year with the placement office
to receive assistance in the job
search, Jones said. In addition,
30 alumni, many just coming off
active duty in the military, he
added, register with the place-
ment office.

Although Jones said that he
does not rely on statistics to
justify what the placement pro-
gram does, the px. . has
been fairly successful.

‘About a quarter or a third of
our guys Say they got their jobs
through the placement officer
in their department,” Jones
said.

Nonetheless, Jones said the
career planning part of the
placement office’s program is
probably as important as the
placement part. A great deal of
time is spent teaching cadets
how to go about getting a job
and helping them find a career
that appeals to them, Jones
said.

“The key to the whole career
planning and placement pro-
gram is that the students get in-
volved in it early. A guy has to
find out what a job is about,”’
Jones said.

Jones said that he expects
VMI’s placement program to be
upgraded next year because a
full time placement officer pro-
bably will be added. Jones said
he spends only about half his
time at VMI working on place-
ment duties.

 

 

Running: a daily chore for cadets

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

Did you ever wonder why
VMI cadets constantly are run-
ning across our campus?

According to Dr. Clark King,
chairman of the VMI physical
education department, running
is only a part of an extensive
and rigorous physical fitness
program required for all
cadets.

All freshmen, sophomores
and juniors are enrolled in a
physical education program,
Clark said. The P.E. cur-
riculum is divided into two
parts: classroom study and ac-
tivities. The classroom subjects
include CPR, drug and alcohol
abuse and films. Activities in-
ciude swimming, boxing,
weight training, wrestling and
scuba diving, among others,
King explained.

The freshman, or Rat, class

Front Lawn, February 2, 1984, Page 5

 

has a program that, according
to King, is designed like Out-
ward Bound — an intense exer-
cise program that brings out the
survival element in man. The
Rat program only lasts one
semester. When it is completed
the first-year cadets can then
join another program, such as
aerobics.

Keydets take the aerobics
class four days a week. Each
Keydet has to earn a minimum
of seven points a day. To
receive maximum credit for the
class, a Keydet must earn 40
points a week. Failure to earn
30 points in a week results in a
zero. Similar to the W&L
Physical Education depart-
ment, three zero marks means
the student fails the course
regardless of any additional ef-
fort he puts into it.

Rats at VMI are required to
complete a 1% mile run in 10

 

 

minutes, 30 seconds to receive
credit for the program. Points
can be earned in a variety of
ways, but the amount of points
earned is determined by the in-
tensity of the sport. For exam-
ple, two rats playing raquetball
will receive more points if they
play ata high level of intensity,
whereas if they play lackadais-
ically they will get fewer points,
King said.

According to Dr. King, ‘“‘We
give points based on a pulse of
150 — a 60 percent level for men
of their ages.’’ Some men, said
King, choose to earn all of their
points through running.

“It is all very complicated
and confusing to someone not
aware of or familiar with our
system,’’ adds King. ‘‘There is
one thing we can be assured of
— these men undergo strenuous
workouts — they are very chal-
lenging.

Cadets are upset over possible changes

By FRANK
KOLLMANSPERGER and
BILL JEMIS

OF THE
VMI CADET

While their neighbors, the
students of Washington and Lee
University have struggled with
the questions of coeducation
and necktie requirements, the
cadets at Virginia Military In-
stitute have loudly questioned
administrative directives con-
cerning the Ratline and Rat in-
tegration. Although conflict be-
tween the Corps and the ad-
ministration has become as
much a tradition as the Friday
afternoon parade, the changes
this year have been more startl-
ing and the responses more im-
passioned than in years past.

Brochures describing VMI to.

prospective cadets characterize
barracks life as an experiment
in self government and leader-
ship. The First Class has tradi-
tionally taken the leading role
in this experiment, through
cadet organizations such as the
Honor Court, the General and
Executive Committees and the
Rat Disciplinary Committee.
The Honor Court is composed of
fifteen elected members, five
from the Second Class and 10

social life. So do the cadets
become angry when they hear
parties roaring into the wee
hours while they remain con-
fined to the barracks?

“Yeah,”’ said one upper-
classman, ‘‘but you have to ac-
cept it or you’ll gocrazy.”’

At some point, many cadets
become a little bit tired of life at
the “I’’ and the result is a
phenomenon known as “run-
ning the block” — escaping
from the barracks, usually to an
illegal apartment party or a
W&L fraternity. If caught in the
act, a cadet may face a penalty
of several weeks in confine-
ment.

So what is a good cadet to do
with the petty rules and the
tight hours putting never-
ceasing pressure on him. For
many at the Institute, sports is
the only viable outlet.

As of last year, VMI was
dropped from Division I to Divi-
sion I-AA status by the NCAA.
This means that VMI is not
obligated to schedule all the big-
ger schools in the area. They do
manage to play a good deal of
Division I competition and in
many cases, especially in foot-
ball, they pay for it. A school of
1,500 students just cannot keep
up with a program that has
30,000 students to work with.

The cadets interviewed
seemed to believe that VMI was
heading toward Division III
status but was being pushed to
stay on a scholarhsip level by
the alumni.

 

from the First Class, and they
are directly responsible for ap-
plying the cadet honor — “A
cadet will not lie, cheat or steal,
nor tolerate those who do’’ — to
everyday situations, setting
policies concerning exams,
homework, and status, and en-
forcing those policies regard-
less of the offender’s rank,
positiion or popularity within
the Corps. Its authority is
seldom questioned, and the ad-
ministration is strongly suppor-
tive of the Court and its policies.

The same level of administra-
tion support has not been forth-
coming this year to the other-
three student governing bodies.
While the Executive and
General Committees, which are
composed of the three officers
of the upper three classes, are

responsible for enforcing a self-
imposed standard of conduct
and appearance of cadets in
public, the Rat Disciplinary
Committee (RDC) is concerned
solely with the enforcement of a
strict code of additional restric-
tions placed on the first-year
cadet (Rat.) This last commit-
tee has become the focal point
of conflict between the ad-
ministration and the First
Class.

This year General Sam
Walker, by direction of the VMI
Board of Visitors, has taken ac-
tion to remove perceived ex-
cesses and abuses of the Rat
system, most especially in the
area of physical conditioning
and disciplinary action. These
changes have attracted the
fierce opposition of the

Corps, who feel that the com-
mon hardships and physical
obstacles of the Rat year pro-
vide for a better cadet and a
strong unified class. Amid emo-
tional charges that Walker is at-
tempting to transform VMI into
a model of West Point, his alma
mater, the Corps has been
frustrated in every attempt to
seek redress; and many believe
that the only option left is a

“step off’’ — a demonstration in
which the entire Corps refuses
to attend classes, wear
uniforms, or march in parades.
Past “‘step offs” have been met
with stern reprisals to include
the dismissal of entire classes.
This year is no exception as
Gen. Walker has threatened to
dismiss those cadets who open-
ly defy his directives.

A Rat consumes his ‘square meal’ in the VMI dining hall.

Walker’s determined effort to
“clean up’’ the Ratline and gain
a tighter control of barracks
coupled with the fierce opposi-
tion of the Corps to include the
Rats themselves, only serve to
illustrate the emotional nature
of the issues at hand. VMI men,
whether they be Rats, upper-
classmen or alumni, all at-
tribute the unique nature of
VMI and its successorsuccess in
furthering the ideals on which it
is founded, to the system of in-
doctrination and training of new
cadets known as the Ratline.

Whatever the outcome of the
current power struggle between
Gen. Walker and the Corps may
be, this much is seems certain,
the Ratline, as it has existed in
recent years is an endangered
species destined to be modified
or replaced.

 

 

The mention of alumni raised
another major topic with most
of the cadets — the inordinate
amount of influence the alumni
have on the school. One cadet
called them ‘‘the silent voice;”’
most refer to them as ‘‘pains.”’
Perhaps this is because most of
the tactical officers — faculty
members who help police the
barracks — are VMI graduates
and the commandant (dean of
students), who is in charge of
discipline, is invariably a VMI
graduate.

Needless to say, the new
cadets don’t get much slack
from the old cadets now running
the show. The administration
says it’s all part of the VMI
tradition. The current students
call it pressure, pressure to
make the grade in a world that
is changing outside the parade
grounds of VMI, but remains
static, some say unforgiving, in-
side the institution.

In many cases, students
under the kind of pressure that
cadets insist is real would turn
to drugs for some kind of relief.
Most cadets are quick to admit
that there are drugs on the cam-
pus; heard of, but not seen.

In light of the fact that 11
cadets have been subpoenaed
by the recent grand jury in-
vestigating drug dealing in Lex-
ington, perhaps the problem is a
little worse than many are will-
ing to admit. When asked which
campus had a worse drug pfo-
blem between W&L and VMI,
the general response was that
they were probably about the
same, but that it was not a ma-
jor problem at VMI.

The big difference between
the schools, according to some
cadets, was the two school’s
honor systems. The cadets feel
that theirs is much stricter and,
therefore, taken more serious-
ly. In the same breath, they also

would say that it is unrealistic
because it is too all-encom-
passing and doesn’t give
students enough room for gen-
uine error.

Lying, cheating and stealing
are covered by W&L’s honor
code. VMI’s covers these areas
as well as nearly every other
aspect of daily life. The cadets
say their system works, but at
the expense of any hint of
casual flippancy. The sound of
percussion in the middle of the
night — a cadet being “drum-
med out’’ for an honor violation
—punctuates the respect with
which it is treated.

So, with all its gothic code of
honor, stringent system of dis-
cipline and regimine and the
Spartan way of life, from the ar-
chitecture of the buildings to the
starch-laden meals, is there
still a place in the American col-
lege scene for the kind of ex-
perience VMI has to offer?

The cadets answer with a re-
sounding yes. Why? Because
they fast are becoming the last
of a dying breed — an all-male
military institute. With the ser-
vice academies going coeduca-
tional and pointing toward a
more __ technically-orineted
education, the men at VMI feel
their school offers a superior
education. Some referred to it
as a “pure” military ex-
perience. Pure in a sense that
has been grounded in the values
given the academy by
Stonewall Jackson. There has
been little change since.

First classman A.W. Meade
caught the overriding sense of
pride the cadets have for their
school when asked whether he
thought tradition was the glue
that holds the institute together.

“No,” he replied. ‘It’s people
fighting to hold the tradition

 together.’’

AD, coach satisfied with Cameron Hall

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

An arena seating over 5,000
spectators would seem to be out
of place in small-town Lex-
ington. Not so if you ask Tom
Joynes or Marty Fletcher about
Cameron Hall, the imposing
athletics and convocations
structure on the campus of
Virginia Military Institute.

Joynes, athletic director at
VMI, was initially suspect of the
size of the $7 million facility,
saying in January 1983, “It’s
ridiculous to have a_ building
which seats 5,000 in a town
which only has 5,000 people in
Nig

In the interview last year, he
also said that the arena would
rarely be filled for sporting
events or other functions. He
felt it would be difficult to at-
tract popular bands, saying,
“The type of show that would
come wouldn’t clear enough to
pay for their advertising.”

The hall has been used for
VMI drama productions, ban-
quets, and other special events
like the Founder’s Day Con-
vocation at VMI and former
President Gerald Ford’s speech
in October.

However, it has not attracted
many concerts in its two-and-a-
half year existence. Pure
Prairie League played the hall
in April 1983, and the Fancy
Dress Thursday night concert
was held there in 1982 when the
Atlanta Rhythm Section played.

Joynes explained that
although there was no plan that
it would generate any revenue,
the Board of Visitors at VMI
(similar to W&L’s Board of
Trustees) thought Cameron
Hall would get more get more
business than it does.

Ike Sherlock, Director of
Cameron Hall, declined com-
ment on the issue.

Joynes’ attitude has changed
somewhat over time, however.
He still feels Cameron Hall has
too many seats for basketball
but recognizes its important
functions for the school and the
cadets. “It’s given us a great
place to play basketball and a
great place for graduation and
corps convocations.

‘‘There are too many seats for
basketball, but those extra
seats are used for corps con-
vocations,” Joynes said.

Joynes explained that
Cameron Hall is an improve-
ment as a site for corps con-
vocations and graduation
ceremonies because the
building formerly used, JM
Hall, wasn’t large enough to
seat the cadets, faculty and
guests.

“It was built for the special
needs. It has served its purpose
as a multi-purpose facility,” he
said.

According to Capt. 0.
Lawrence Burnett, Director of
Public Information at VMI,
“VMI had long felt the need for
a multi-purpose auditorium.
The facility was 10 years in the

ia

 

planning.”’

The primary tenant at
Cameron Hall has been head
basketball coach Marty Fletch-
er and his Keydets, who began
playing their home games there
in November 1981 with an open-
ing night contest against the
University of Virginia and
Ralph Sampson. Even then,
with the second best team and
number one player in the na-
tion, ‘“There were still 600 seats
open,”’ Joynes said.

Coach Fletcher, though, feels
it is an excellent facility for

basketball. ‘‘Spectator-wise, I
don’t think there’s a bad seat in
the house. We feel like the
crowd is able to be right there
with us,” the Keydets’ third-
year leader said. Fletcher also
praised the technical aspects of

' the gymnasium.

The hall is rarely more than
half full for a basketball game,
but Fletcher finds this to be no
hindrance to his team’s play.
‘‘We’ve had crowds of 700, 800
people, but the corps is so en-
thusiastic and they cheer so

well for us.

Cameron Hall is a change
from the Keydets’ former
home, affectionately known as
“The Pit,’ where the corps
played an instrumental role in
not only cheering for VMI
teams but also disturbing op-
posing squads.

Fletcher hopes to establish
the same type of atmosphere in
Cameron Hall. “It’s a bigger
place than The Pit. We’ll just
have to work a little harder, and
it seems like it’s starting to
move in that direction.”

VMI clings to Division I status

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute is
one of the smallest schools com-
peting in Division I athletics,
and although major sports
there have had a few lean years
recently, the school’s inter-
collegiate athletic program has
produced success that belies the
school’s size.

The Keydet basketball team
has not posted a winning season
in five years, yet as few as eight
years ago VMI reached the final
eight of the NCAA tournament.

From the 1975-76 season
through the ’77-78 season, the
basketball team went 22-10, 26-4
and 21-7, respectively. In 1976
the team lost to Rutgers, 91-75,
in the Eastern Region finals of
the NCAA tournament. In 1977
the team lost to Kentucky in the
semifinals, 93-78.

The team’s last winning
season before 1975 came in 1941.

The Keydet football team,
which competes in Division
IAA, hasn’t produced the great
successes of the basketball

team, but it has been more con-

sistent. In 1981 the team was
6-3-1, winning against Virginia
Tech and Army. This year,
though, the team posted a 2-9
record.

In track and wrestling, less-
emphasized sports, VMI is
more successful. The track
team has won the state cham-
pionship three out of the last
five years, and the wrestling

successful __ intercollegiate
sports program is important to
VMI. “‘We want to win and we
want to be competitive, but we
haven’t been in the last five
years in our two major sports,”’
said Strickler.

However, there are no major
plans to improve the teams by a
radical change in the program,
and under no circumstances

VMI is going to do everything
possible to compete on a Divi-
sion I level in athletics and win
as many championships in the
state and Southern Conference
as possible,”’ said Strickler.

One of the reasons that a Divi-
sion I program is important to
VMI, he suggested, is the
athletic scholarships attract
athletes who would not normal-

‘VMI recruiting is a little bit tougher because

of the academic and military requirements’

 

team has won 30 consecutive
dual meets over the last three
years.

According to Sports Informa-
tion Director Mike Strickler, a

would VMI drop to a lower divi-
sion, according to Strickler.
“The Board of Visitors (com-
parable to W&L’s Board of
Trustees) set a policy not too
many years ago that states that

ly have become cadets.

“VMI recruiting is a little bit
tougher because of the aca-
demic and the military require-
ments,” he said. ‘‘The type of

recruit they’re looking for is the
kid who can handle the
toughness of the military
system here and still play ma-
jor college athletics and get a

good education.

“If there were no scholar-
ships, VMI would be _ hard-
pressed to get the number of
cadets they want in the bar-
racks,” said Strickler. ‘‘The ad-
missions office and the business
offices have said as much.”

According to Strickler, 159 out
of the 1,300 cadets in the school
are on some sort of athletic
scholarship, with a little over
half that number receiving full
scholarships.

Of that 159, about 145 scholar-
ships go to athletes in football,
basketball, track and wrestling.
The other sports for which
scholarships are awarded are
baseball, soccer, tennis, golf
and swimming.

Athletic scholarships are
funded by the Keydet Ciub,
which this year will raise
$700,000 from alumni for
scholarships.
