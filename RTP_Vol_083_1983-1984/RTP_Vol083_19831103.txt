EC looks at independents

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
formed a subcommittee to han-
dle concerns of independent
students Monday night.

“This is a very, very signifi-
cant committee with a big
task,’ EC President Bob Jene-
vein said. ‘That task is to ap-
pease the independents and
solve the problems voiced by
the independents recently. It’s
certainly an issue that’s come
to the forefront.”’

EC secretary Len Howard,
the only independent on the EC,
freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers, sophomore
representatives Ken Lindeman
and James White and Jenevein
were appointed to the subcom-
mittee.

At next Monday’s meeting,
Jim Sarle of the rejuvenated In-
dependent Union will meet with
EC members and with the SAB
in what Jenevein described as
‘“‘a forum on independent mat-
ters.”

Also last night, junior repre-
sentative Cole Dawson reported
on the progress of the subcom-

mittee investigating the open
exam policy that would allow
students to take exams
whenever they pleased during
the exam week.

Scott Mason, an EC represen-
tative last year, had begun
work on the possibility but
reported to the EC earlier this
year that the biggest opposition
to an open exam policy ap-
peared to be from the Com-
merce School.

Dawson said he had talked to
Edward Atwood, dean of the
Commerce school, and that
Dean Atwood ‘‘seems very in-
terested in the idea.”’

“He seems very willing to
talk about it. I think that we
might be able to work some-
thing out,’’ Dawson added.
‘Dawson said he hopes to talk

_ to the other department chair-

men in the upcoming weeks.
Howard reported that in-
dependent David Sprunt and
SAB member Burford Smith
had been appointed to the sub-
committee arranging social ac-
tivities between Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College and

men member and a fraternity

There was some debate as to

the exact purpose of that sub-
committee and whether, in fact,
it was really needed if W&L
were going to go coeducational.

The main point of debate

centered around whether the
subcommittee should arrange
band and beer parties such as
those normally held by the SAB
and by fraternities or whether
other social and cultural ac-
tivities, such as field trips,
should be arranged.

Bob Bryant, a junior, was ap-
pointed to be in charge of

appointment met no opposition
but provided a light moment

when vice-president Dave
Judge asked Bryant, ‘‘Would

In other action Monday, the
EC commended the SAB for re-
viving Fall Weekend and an-
nounced that upperclass law
students must fill out honor
cards before being allowed to
vote in EC elections.

First Lt. Syd Farrar, a 1980
graduate of Washington and
Lee, was among the United
States servicemen wounded
during last week’s invasion of
Grenada.

A native of Blackstone, Va.,
Farrar was listed in satisfac-
tory condition at Walter Reed
Hospital in Washington Tues-
day.

He had been stationed at Fort
Stewart, Ga.

Farrar was tri-captain of
Washington and Lee’s 1979 foot-
ball team, serving as tight end
and the team’s punter. He was
active in the W&L Army ROTC
detachment. He was president
of the Interfraternity Council
during his senior year.

Washington and Lee Head
Football Coach Gary Fallon
recalled this week that while at
W&L Farrar displayed an in-
spiring character.

“He was an_ outstanding
youngster,” Fallon said. ‘‘He
exemplified (while at W&L)
high spirit and dedication. He
was a gutsy type of guy.”

“It didn’t surprise me that he

Fallon said that the football
team had dedicated this week of
practice in preparation for
Saturday’s game _ against
Catholic University to the
qualities which Farrar repre-
sents.

“Our prayers are with him
for a speedy recovery,” Fallon
said.

 

 

Jury probes drug trafticking

By DAVE JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A special grand jury in-
vestigating ‘‘drug trafficking
and other conditions tending to
promote illegal activity in the
community” began meeting
this week.

The grand jury was requested
by Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. “John’’ Read and
local enforcement officals in
response to a recent rash of
drug-related arrests and con-
victions. According to court
documents filed by Read, there
have been seven convictions for
felony drug trafficking crimes,
and an additional 10 defendants

have been charged with
felonies.

The main target of the in-
vestigation, according to Lex-
ington Police Chief L.O. Sutton,
is the suppliers, rather than the
users, of drugs.

“My primary objective is to
get the people — and I will call
them parasites — who are mak-
ing profits off the people who
are too weak to stand on their
own feet,”’ said Sutton, ‘‘and to
protect young people from be-
coming infected by these
parasites.”’

Some youths, Sutton said, fall
prey to drugs because of associ-
ating with users, and by
eliminating that element this
could possibly be prevented.

By forming the grand jury,
Sutton said, local enforcement
officials hope to be able to com-
bat the drug problem more easi-
ly. Sutton said the special grand
jury, which does not have the
power to indict, could be used to
gain more testimony. A defen-
dant must answer the special
grand jury’s subpoenas, and
must answer their questions,
unlike a standard interrogation
situation. He also said that
along with this testimony comes
varying degrees of immunity.

Sutton, who said he has many
names of people who may be in-
vestigated, could not elaborate
more on the special grand
jury’s procedure, and Read was
unavailable for comment.

Review and Outlook

Clear reflection

Once again, the issue of coeducation has reared its
controversial head.

Since the late 1960s, coeducation sometimes has
been a very hot issue here at General Lee’s college.
This is one of those times.

University President John D. Wilson has said he did
not bring the issue of coeducation to Washington and
Lee, as much as some students would like to believe
he did. He has said he is merely holding up a mirror to
the University, doing what he can to better the
University.

We tend to believe him, but we also believe that
there must be a maximum of free and open discussion
by faculty, students and alumni. When the Board of
Trustees announced the issue was being re-examined,
it added that at its February meeting, methods would
be devised to keep students informed and possibly in-
clude them in the decision-making process.

This is the first step in the right direction. Although
today’s students may only be moderately affected by
coeducation, they can best reflect the reactions of
future students — students who might be attracted to
Washington and Lee.

And, indeed, we feel that it is proper at this time for
the issue of coeducation to be re-examined. A declin-
ing applicant pool and the lowering of academic
standards that might result would seriously damage
the quality of W&L. Yet, the irreversible decision to
go coed would alter 234 years of tradition.

It is for this reason that we urge the administration
and the Board to take as much time as possible to
study the issue carefully before making any decision.
The issue is much too complicated for any decision to
be rushed.

And we do not intend to rush our decision. For as
Wilson holds up a mirror to the University, The Ring-
tum Phi serves as a window between the student body
and the administration, faculty and trustees.

If that window is clouded, it will be impossible to get
an accurate view of what is going on with the issue.

Letter

Cadet-General sees need to stay
all-male as an alternative

To the Editors:

I am a 1982 graduate of VMI
and I am presently a 2nd year
law student here at W&L.
Recently I have read a great
deal concerning the coeduca-
tion issue, and I feel I must
observe a point which has so far
been neglected. That point is
alternative schooling.

There are two facets to my
point about alternative school-
ing: for men in general, and for
W&L and this area as a whole.
Young men in this country have
but five schools to choose from
if they desire an all-male educa-
tional setting. These schools
are: W&L, Hampden-Sydney,
Wabash, The Citadel and VMI.
If the young man does not
desire a military education, his
choice is narrowed to but three
colleges. On the other hand,
young women still have tens of
all-female schools from which
to choose. Thus, despite con-
cern over W&L’s own potential
future admissions problems, I
think it best to consider the
situation on the whole and to
realize how very important it is
for young men to have a viable
alternative to coeducational
schooling.

W&L must also be mindful of
how its actions will affect this
region. This area is the last
place in our nation where the
single-sex alternative thrives.
Three all-male and five all-
female colleges are clustered in

or near the Shenandoah Valley.
W&L’s decision to go coed could
send reverberations throughout
the Valley, prompting each of
the seven other single-sex
schools to reconsider its status.
I do not wish to be an alarmist,
but I believe that a coed W&L
would ultimately destroy the
unique characteristic of the
Valley. Commensurate with
that change would be the near
total destruction forever of the
single-sex alternative to all
future college-bound young
men.

I could cite studies showing
that men and women perform
better scholastically in a single-
sex atmosphere. However, I
consider that fact to be secon-
dary to the possible undoing of
this nation’s last stronghold of
traditional schooling. Single-
sex colleges are not discrim-
inatory, they are an alternative
to coed schooling. And so long
as this republic of ours remains
free, so should the right to
choose a single-sex school.

So I say to the people who will
soon be making this important
decision — do not engross
yourselves in statistics and pro-
jections about W&L’s ability to
survive within a shrinking col-
lege age population pool. First
let us see if W&L may weather
the storm without changing the
face and nature of its and the
area’s educational institutions.
A hasty decision to go coed now,

will, I assure you, never be
reversed. I personally believe
enough qualified young men
will seek the single-sex alter-
native so that the all-male
school may not only survive,
but thrive in an era of dwindling
college age populations As col-
leges across the nation scram-
ble to admit qualified young
men, it may soon be revealed
that our all-male character,
once thought to be a fatal han-
dicap, is proven to be our forte.
The jury is still out on this one
Gentlemen, and so it should re-
main for several years.

Independents strive to form union

Athletic, social needs cited

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The drive to form an indepen-
dent union of students is being
spearheaded by sophomore Jim
Sarle and junior Joseph Cadle,
whose letter to The Ring-tum
Phi (Oct. 13, 1983) regarding the
concerns of independent
students has sparked a number
of responses. In separate inter-
views for the Phi, Sarle and
Associate Dean of Students
Michael Cappeto explained
some of the history of reasons
for an independent union.

According to Dean Cappeto,
at least two fruitless attempts
have been made to form a union
during his nine years here. He
speculated that the failures
resulted from the naturally in-
dependent nature of the non-
fraternity students, as well as a
lack of a definite mission by the
union. He stressed that the in-
dependent students must decide
what they want, and added, ‘‘I
think it can be a very valuable
orgainzation.”’

Sarle has sent a flyer con-
cerning an organizational
meeting of the union to be held
this evening to all independent
students and all freshmen. He is
looking toward two main goals

functions.

Just see Jay before the second game
starts — he runs the contest this Sunday

— developing intramural
athletic teams and trying to im-
prove the social lives and ac-
tivities of independents. He is
not, however, looking to gear
the union solely towards in-
dependents, nor is he trying to
serve as a spokesman for all in-
dependents, he said.

“President Wilson was very
responsive (to the idea),’’ Sarle
said, while Cappeto said, ‘‘Dean
John and | are very interested.”
Yet Sarle envisions’ the
possibility of the problems.
“There seems to be a lot of
hesitancy...as to what kind of
turnout we’ll get. Some people
say that an independent union is
a contradiction in terms. I sup-
pose to an extent that may be
true.’’ With some of the current
controversy concerning frater-
nities, some people fear that a
rift may develop between the
frats and the independents.

Sarle doesn’t believe so,
however. He said that a number
of students would like to play
I.M.s, but have trouble finding
other students to field a team,
and he has been told that some
students at the surrounding
women’s colleges don’t like
fraternity parties. He foresees

the possibility of non-party type

He notes that if fraternities
start having closed parties, in-
dependents will need to have
something to do on weekends,
yet ‘The Student Activities
Board seems somewhat reluc-
tant to run bands on Fridays.”
He said the SAB has an obliga-
tion to provide activities for all
students, and should not
schedule all of its activities
around the fraternities’ social
functions.

At this point, Sarle and Cap-
peto are holding a wait-and-see
attitude. If there is a large turn-
out at this meeting, and the in-
dependents can determine what
they want to accomplish, both
believe that the financial needs
of an independent union could
be met.

The meeting will be held to-
day from 7 to 7:30 p.m. in the
University Center conference
room (formerly Rooms 108-109)
above the Cockpit. ;

Fut

By KEVIN McCLATCHY
Special to the Phi

The Phi Gamma Delta frater-
nity was put on social probation
until Jan. 3 by the Interfraterni-
ty Council judicial board on
Thursday because of an inci-
dent involving two of the frater-
nity’s pledges at W&L’s football
game against Hampden-Sydney
College three weeks ago.

Vincent Lamanna and
Michael McCallister, both
freshman pledges of the frater-
nity, pulled the tail off the
Hampden-Sydney College mas-
cot’s tiger costume during the
game at Hampden-Sydney. The
damage ruined the costume and
the costume must be replaced
by the two students involved.
The cost of a new costume is
$250, according to IFC president
Emery Ellinger.

The ruling on the incident did
not come under the Student
Control Committee, Ellinger
said, because it (the van-
dalism) was definitely ‘‘frat-
related.” “A bunch of guys
from that fraternity were at the
game and the two freshmen in-
volved said that it was ‘heavily

to the mascot,’ ” Ellinger said.

The action taken against the
two freshmen was that they
must replace the costume and
each has written a letter of
apology to the Hampden-
Sydney Dean of Students.

The IFC also took action
directly against the fraternity
as a whole. Fiji had been. on
social probation until Thanks-
giving for previous offenses.
The IFC lengthened the proba-
tion period. In addition to the
probation, the fraternity was

pulls long social probation

fined $150 and they were re-
quired to clean the streets
around the campus after Fall
Weekend, according to Ell-
inger. Fiji also must sponsor a
canned food drive in conjunc-
tion with the annual World
Hunger Drive. The fraternity
must collect at least 300 cans.
The ruling handed down by
the IFC is subject to appeal by
the fraternity to the Student Af-
fairs Committee. All IFC deci-
sions are overseen by the com-
mittee and may be appealed.

Timerman postponed again

Indefinite return due to illness

The scheduled lecture by
author Jacobo Timerman at
Washington and Lee University
has been indefinately postponed
due to Timerman’s illness.

Timerman had originally
been scheduled to speak at W&L
on Oct. 20. That presentation
was postponed and rescheduled
for Nov. 3.

Marty Harmon, co-chairman
of the student organization
sponsoring the lecture, ‘‘Con-
tact ’83,’”’ said that no future

 

date has been set for Timer-
man’s lecture but ind‘cated the
speaker sypmosium still hoped
to sponsor the lecture at a
future date.

Correction

In the last issue of The Ring-
tum Phi, the Student Affairs
Committee was _ incorrectly
described as a body made up of
class officers. In fact the SAC is
a faculty-student disciplinary
committee.

Pryor returns in film

Shows typical taste for tasteless

By COLE DAWSON
Special to the Phi

Richard Pryor once again
shows his rare talent in his new
movie “Here and Now.” The
film is set in New Orleans and is
his latest stage show. Pryor
lives up to Bourbon Street’s
age-old reputation with his flair
for the unexpected. He keeps
his audience, both on and off the
screen riveted with laughter.

In natural Pryor fashion, he
tantalizes and provokes his au-
dience with his usual taste for
the tasteless. I would not
recommend taking your mother
to see this film, unless of course

she is a mudwrestler and chews
Red Man at the dinner table.
Pryor has an innate ability to
bring himself across well to his
audience. He is very comfor-
table on stage and his dialogue
flows very well. His man-
nerisms speak for themselves
and are an integral part of the
show.

He brings the topics of drink-
ing and drugs to bear through-
out, and emphasizes the fact
that he has done neither for
seven months. If Pryor has ac-
tually made this commitment it
is hard to deduce from this film.
One almost gets the feeling that

he is making a_ statement
against drug abuse and alcohol,
but at the same time his is
ironically seeming to condone
them through much of his act.

The movie is good, but begins
to drag in the last half hour. For
Pryor fans it will be most en-
joyable; but for the more sedate
group, that would like to be
entertained by something more
than South Bronx vocabulary at
best, this one is not recommend-
ed. I give the film an average
rating. “Here and Now’’ is
entertaining, but I can only sit
still for so long and listen to any
comedian.

New display combines arts

“Extensions: In Time and
Space,”’ an installation by Bir-
mingham, Ala., artist Edith
Frohock will be in the duPont
Gallery from Nov. 1-18.

The exhibit includes an
unusual collection of painting,
drawings, sculpture, and con-
temporary synthesized music
written by Doug Carroll which
plays continuously while the
gallery is open.

According to the artist the in-
stallation will appear simul-
taneously in three different
locations — Washington and
Lee, the University of Alabama

 

 

in Birmingham, and Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn.
All the exhibits will feature the
same musical composition and
similar paintings and sculpture.
According to Debora Rindge,
art instructor and director of
the duPont Gallery, a viewer
traveling from Birmingham to
Nashville to Lexington would
notice the exhibit gradually
become more complex.
Frohock says she ‘frequently
felt the need to be in more than
one place at the same time. One
show opening simultaneously in
three different states allows me

Roberto yearns for a simpler,
warmer life in Florida or Puer-
to Rico — any place where it
does not snow.

“El Super’ provides the
viewer with a_ refreshingly
human perspective on Hispanic
emigrant culture in the United
States. Though concerned with
working-class people who fled
Castro’s revolution, this work is
not really about politics. In-
stead, ‘El Super’ is a funny
and poignant film which deals
intelligently with the plight of
displaced persons in an alien
society. As one reviewer has
said, “El Super” is ‘an ex-
tremely enjoyable experience
to be shared by anyone possess-
ing a normal complement of
human sympathy.”

Generals again, will
try a fourth time

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team came away
with second place in_ the
Virginia State Championships
last weekend in Richmond, Va.
The Generals lost in the finals to
tournament champion Rich-
mond by a score of 9-4.

The Generals qualified for the
tournament finals by defeating
the University of Virginia 13-4
in the semi-finals. Tim Rock
scored four of the Generals’
goals against UVa.

Concerning the Richmond
game, head water polo coach
Page Remillard said, ‘“Rich-
mond took charge right away

  

IN

and we were never in the
game.”’

C-rated officials called the A-
rated game between W&L and
Richmond. But Coach Remil-
lard believes that W&L would
have lost anyway if A-rated of-
ficals had judged the game. He
did state, however, that Rich-
mond took advantage of the
referees’ inexperience and shut
down the Generals’ offense.

This weekend W&L will host
the Southern League Champion-
ships Tournament. Action will
begin Saturday morning.

The championships will be
the last regular season event for
the Southern League. The top

Canfield sees tough road

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University basketball team has
begun practicing for the upcom-
ing season, and basketball
coach Verne Canfield said his
team will have a very tough
year with only two returning
starters and a difficult schedule
this season.

The Generals only returning
starters are Chris Baldwin, a
5-9, 155-lb. guard, and John Lee
Graves, a 6-5, 190-lb. forward.
Both of the seniors were
selected as the team’s co-
captains.

Last season, Baldwin averag-
ed 2.8 points per game and had
58 assists for the Generals.
Graves, who has started for
W&L since his freshman year,
averaged 15.2 points and 6.7 re-
bounds a game last year.

With a young, inexperienced
team and a demanding sche-
dule which includes 11 games on
the road and eight at home,
Canfield said that two seniors
will definitely play a crucial
role in the success of the team.
“We will be looking toward
them for leadership,’ Canfield
said.

This year’s team includes
eight new players and two new
assistant coaches, according to
Canfield.

The problem with having an
inexperienced team is that a
review course over the basics
and fundamentals of basketball
is necessary at the beginning of
the year, Canfield explained.
He said that taking the time to
teach the new players the
basics will help eliminate some
of those inevitable mistakes a
player will make while in the
game.

“‘We will not make a mistake
that we won’t learn from,” he
added.

This year’s schedule will also
pose some problems for the

Generals, Canfield said. He
stated that most of the con-
ference (ODAC) teams will be
returning three or more
starters and that defending
ODAC champion Roanoke Col-
lege will be particularly strong.
Canfield described this year’s
schedule as a bad one and said
if he had known his team would
be lacking in experience, he
would not have formed such a
difficult schedule. Pointing out
the first seven to nine games as
being particularly tough, Can-
field said he is still optimistic.
“‘T think everybody we play will
know they’ve been in a basket-
ball game,”’ he said.

Although W&L has a lot of
work and preparation to do
before their opening game in
the W&L Tip-Off Tournament
Nov. 18, Canfield said he was
having m n this year. “I
didn’t enjoy coaching that much
last year,”’ he said. Last year’s

team finished with a 17-10
record, but Canfield said there
was no togetherness on last
year’s squad while referring to
this year’s team as one that has
a positive attitude and is willing
to work hard. ‘We believe in
one another,” Canfield said.
‘We have super people, and I
think we can win with super
people.”

Although last year’s team had
more individual ability, they
did not play their best, Canfield
said. ‘‘I want to see this year’s
team play up to its fullest poten-
tial and beyond.”’

Strategically, the Generals
will use a multiple offense and
defense this year, meaning that
the team will be constantly
changing their offenses and
defenses based on the game
conditions and _ personnel
availiable.

The development of the new,
inexperienced players is just a
matter of time, Canfield said.
“‘] definitely feel we will be a
factor (in the ODAC) and we
will work hard,” he said.

Baldwin and Graves also feel
the team will develop and are
optimistic about the upcoming
season.

Speaking of the younger
players, Baldwin said, ‘‘after
they get some game time, they
will be all right.”

According to Graves, the new
players ‘‘will grow up in a
hurry.”’

The two co-captains also said
they were looking forward to
the challenge of leading the
team, and they both have their
goals in mind.

“T just hope I can look back
after the season is over and say
we did the best we could,”
Baldwin said.

Graves mentioned that he
would like to make the All-
Conference team but stated his
overall goal was to do what he
could to make the team come
together as it should.”

Generals clip BC Eagles, 42-

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals combined big
plays early in the game and a
devastating ground game to
snap a two-game losing streak
with a 42-7 thrashing of the
Bridgewater College Eagles
Saturday.

For the second time this
season, W&L returned the open-
ing kickoff for a touchdown and
never looked back. This time
sophomore Chris Bleggi ignited
the Generals with his 90-yard
return on the opening play, giv-
ing W&L a 7-0 lead only 13
seconds into the game.

“Once again we managed to
get a real big boost from the
opening kick-off, just like we
did against Maryville when we
ran that one back for the
touchdown,”’ head coach Gary
Fallon said.

The Generals added two more
first-quarter touchdowns as

 

Girard, White
jearn kudos

Gene Girard, a junior
tailback from Coral Gables,
Fla., needs only five points in
the last two games to set a new
school record for scoring in a
single season. The record of 64
points was established by Bob
Funkhouser in 1959.

Girard has already tied the
single season mark for touch-
downs with 10, sharing that
record with Chris Cavalline. On
the season, Girard has amassed
712 yards on 148 carries and has
an outside chance of reaching
1,000 yards for the season in the
last two games.

Placekicker James White is
also nearing a school record. He
needs only two more point-
after-touchdown kicks to break
Bill Devine’s single-season
record of 23 set in 1981.

 

 

 

       
  

Rick Swagler)

Charlie Alcorn’s interception
set up the first, a 10-yard run by
tailback Gene Girard. Later in
the quarter, quarterback Bobby
Wilson hit tight end Ian Banwell
for a 17-yard touchdown. After
James White added the third of
his six PAT’s, W&L had a 21-0
lead.

This lead was increased early
in the second quarter after
Frank Surface scored on a one-
yard run. After White’s kick,
the Generals led 28-0 and the
score remained the same until
halftime.

In the third quarter W&L put
the game out of reach as Gene
Girard scored on runs of 46 and
three yards, making the score
42). Bridgewater’s lone score
came just before the end of the
third quarter when Eagle
quarterback Randy Bleeden hit
Pete Ritchie for 55 yards for a
touchdown. Stefan South’s ex-
tra point finished the scoring for
the day, making the final score
42-7.

The Generals’ victory was
keyed by a strong rushing at-
tack led by Girard (15 carries,
120 yards) and Surface (13 car-
ries, 84 yards). Of the 361 total
yards of offense, only 17 of them
came through the air as the
Eagles were unable to stop the
W&L ground game.

“Gene and Frank ran excep-
tionally well all afternoon. But
then so did everybody else,”’
Fallon said. “Girard continues
to improve every week. Frank
gave us good blocking and also
had his best day running the
ball. Up front, we were pleased
with the way our linemen open-
ed holes,’’ he added.

Defense also was a bright
spot for the Generals. Bridge-
water was unable to establish a
rushing attack and was forced
to resort to the pass. They found
some success via the pass (12 of
30, 196 yards), but had three
passes intercepted and could

muster only one score against

the stubborn General defense.
Fallon singled out defensive end
Charlie Alcorn for making ‘“‘two
crucial plays by intercepting
one pass to set up our second
touchdown and by trapping the
quarterback for a loss in a key
situation.”

The Generals will host the
Catholic University Cardinals
this Saturday in Lexington.
Catholic is 4-4 on the year and
promises to be a dangerous op-

ponent. This is the last meeting
between the two schools as
Catholic has decided to leave
the ODAC after this year.

“We would certainly like to
end the series with a victory,”
Fallon stated. He added that
Catholic ‘‘could have the best

balance, offensively and defen-
sively, of any team we've
played. I certainly hope we’re
ready to play.”

It’s no go co,
at least from an
athletic perspective

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...Well, it seems I can no
longer avoid commenting on
that dreaded topic looming over
our heads these past weeks.
Anyway, the big boys decided to
devote this issue to it, so I might
as well comply with a few
choice quips on ... shh... coedu-
cation and its relation to the
staid athletic tradition here at
W&L. Mr. Doremus most cer-
tainly is turning in his grave as
the thought of women wearing
the royal blue and white is being
bantered about. I most certain-
ly concur with his resting soul,
as well as some living ones to-
day. Admitting women would
naturally entail the develop-
ment of women’s athletic pro-
grams (see Title IX) and with
that athletics at W&L would be
on that slippery slope toward in-
escapable mediocrity. First,
the refurbishing costs of the
gym would be a matter of con-
cern. Second, with women
would come the need for a re-
vamped — and, in turn, perhaps
restrained — physical educa-
tion program. Third, the effects
on the staff in the athletic
department would be quite
detrimental as many coaches
would have to leave, their spots
to be taken over by the new
women’s sports coaches. Four-
th, adding women’s sports
would most probably mean los-
ing some men’s sports simply
because only so many can be
supported by the university. In

turn, the big sports such as
lacrosse, football, basketball
would have their choice of
players cut in half, making
recruitment twice as difficult as
itis now. The decline would thus
continue as with a smaller
group to select from there

Time out..,

would be fewer better athletes.
The W&L athletic department,
which has earned respect in re-
cent years, would then not be
able to produce the quality
teams it has prided itself upon.
From this there is the very real
possibility that dissatisfaction
athletically speaking would
lead to the abandoning of the
Division III non-scholarship,
true student-athlete philosophy.
The quick fix of athletic
scholarships would become a
reality, and well then we’d be
one of many in the sea of
mediocrity instead of the island
of supremacy W&L athletics
have developed into. No, there
is no debate here. The coeduca-
tion process would be more
trouble than it’s worth. Truer
words perhaps were never
spoken...

..We got congrats galore
for this weekend’s Colonnade:
crusaders. Jay Werner with.
four shutouts and the General
soccer group are playing like
they’ve deserved all season.

that have been plaguing NBA
coaches. Or, they can start pay-

in order to really make use of
those exciting three-to-make-

Werner claims fourth
shutout as soccer splits two

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Sophomore forward Bill
Holmes scored a goal in each
game this week as the Gener-
als’ soccer team split two away
games, defeating Catholic
University, 3-0, on Saturday,
and losing in overtime, 3-2, to
Radford University on Tues-
day.

The victory over Catholic
ended the ODAC season for the
Generals, who finished at 3-3 in
the conference. Lynchburg Col-
lege, which defeated W&L, 2-1,
on Oct. 19, took the ODAC title
witha 5-1 record.

Tuesday’s defeat at Radford
left W&L with a 7-5 record with
one game remaining, a 10:00
a.m. match this Saturday
against Emory University on
Wilson Field.

Although the Generals failed
to capture the ODAC title, head
coach Rolf Piranian is happy

-with the way his team has

developed this season. “‘As a
team we’ve improved, clearly.
We’ve scored more goals and
played better defense,”’ said the
eighth-year coach.

Holmes, Gary Clements, and
freshman Ken Randby scored
the goals against Catholic. The
shutout was the fourth of the
season for junior goalie Jay
Werner, who has a 1.33 goals
against average per game. The
W&L shutout record is seven in
a season and 11 ina career.

Against Radford Holmes and
Steve McGrath gave the Gener-
als a 2-) lead, which they held
going into the final two minutes.
Radford scored with 1:39 left,
however, to send the game into
overtime, then ended the game
seven minutes into the first
overtime with the winning goal.

Holmes now has five goals
and seven assists on the season,
for 17 total points. Senior co-
captain Roland Simon, with six
goals and four assists, has 16
points.

 

An Open Letter from
Lloyd’s of Lexington

Dear Washington & Lee Students:
When we opened our restaurant 3 years ago, we did so hoping

 

that Lloyd’s would become a popular place for students to come
with their friends for a quick meal. We added the most popular
video games in the country to provide a little entertainment in a
conservative town that lacks a lot in the entertainment field.
You have been good to use.

In the past 12 months, Dominos and Arby’s have entered into
the fast food market and sliced the pie. There are only so many
dollars to be spent on food.

One thing that is unique about our ‘‘Lloyd’s of Lexington,”’ is
that the owner works and manages his store, which keeps him in.
touch with the needs of the community. We have responded to
the needs of you students by operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. But, with this, we have excess overhead to pay.

I can tell you that we have tried for the past 3 years to provide
a quality product, with fast, courteous service, in a clean
restaurant. Some businesses would have you to believe that your
business does not matter. Let me be the first to say, if it were not
for Washington and Lee students, Lloyd’s of Lexington would
not survive. ;

We will continue to provide specials to build business. We hope
you will take advantage of these specials, as you could save
some money.

We will be purchasing two of the latest new ‘‘laser disc’’ video
games next week, Dragon’s Lair, and Mach III. These games
are intense. Come by and let them blow your mind.

Please friends, think twice before spending your money in
chain food stores. Your money will be invested back into this
business, to better it, which will benefit you in the long run. As
we celebrate our 3rd anniversary, I would like say thank you; a
million thank you’s for making Lloyd’s better today than yester-
day. Help us make it better tomorrow than it is today.

Respectfully,
Lloyd W. Smith Jr.

1980 student survey leans toward coeducation
Honors thesis finds 50% in favor of change

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Over half of Washington and
Lee students and three-quarters
of W&L faculty members polled
several
coeducation, according to a
sociology honors thesis by
David Bowen, who graduated
last spring.

Students in Sociology 375
(Research Methods) distrib-
uted questionnaires to students
registering for classes during
the winter semester of 1980. Of
1,200 students, 1,050 returned
the questionnaires, a number
that Bowen said makes the
survey representative and
significant.

Of those 1,050 students, 527, or
50.2 percent, favored coeduca-
tion, and 453, or 43.1 percent, op-
posed coeducation. Six percent
had no opinion.

Bowen was not involved with
conducting this survey, but he

   
 

in the fall of 1981 through inter-
campus mail. Creating essen-
tially the same questionnaire as
that distributed to the students,
he found that the faculty greatly
favored coeducation.

Of the 92 faculty members
who responded, 76.9 percent
favored coeducation, 19.8 per-
cent opposed coeducation and
3.3 percent had no opinion.
Although only 68 percent of the
faculty members responded,
Bowen said it was a represen-
tative sample and thus could be
generalized to the faculty as a
whole.

Bowen said his findings were
“surprising to those who are

(continued from page 4)

Both Drew and Settle said
that Hampden-Sydney’s ap-
plications for admission would
probably not increase a great
deal if W&L went coed.

Drew said that only a small
percentage of freshmen enter-
ing Hampden-Sydney listed the
all-male environment as the
main reason they chose the
school. Nevertheless, Drew said
that at least two-thirds of the

years ago favored ©

did survey the faculty members

adamantly opposed to coeduca-
tion. It was surprising to me.”’

Bowen said he felt that even
though nearly all students who
were surveyed have graduated
(last year’s seniors would have
been freshmen then), the sur-
vey probably comes close to re-
flecting current student at-
titudes about coedcuation at
W&L. However, both Bowen
and Dr. David Novack, who
helped him with the project,
pointed out that a_ similar
survey today might not reflect
those attitudes.

“When that survey was
taken,’”’ Bowen said, ‘‘the issue
was not as hot as it is now.
Students know if they’re asked
the same questions now, that
they’re being put on the spot
and what they have to say
might really be important.

“TI don’t see students as
changing as that much,”’ he ad-
ded. “‘But their attitudes might
be clouded a bit by the heat of

   

the issue right now.”

Reading Bowen’s 120-page
thesis, some __ interesting
phenomena come to light.

Using a series of demo-
graphic variables, Bowen found
little relationship between a stu-
dent’s year in school or his ma-
jor and his feeling toward
coeducation. However, he did
find that 36.8 percent of frater-
nity members were strongly op-
posed to coeducation, while 17.8
percent of independents were
strongly opposed, and 42.4 per-

cent strongly supportive.
Bowen also discovered that

72.8 percent of students from
the Northeast favored coeduca-
tion while 34.4 percent from the

 

students are strongly in favor of
remaining all-male.

Capt. O. Lawrence Burnette
Jr., Public Information Direc-
tor at VMI, said that it would be
improper for any offical at VMI
to comment on W&L’s study of
the coed question.

“We have no intention of
changing our all-male status,”
Burnette said.

Burnette said that he would
not elaborate on that statement.

   
   

South favored it. Forty-five per-
cent of the Southerners were
strongly opposed. Virginia,
Maryland and the District of
Columbia were not included in
any regional classification, and
the breakdown in those areas
was fairly similar to that of the
student sample as a whole.

The student questionnaire
also asked if W&L’s all-male
status was a positive or
negative factor in a student’s
decision to enroll at W&L. 23.1
percent said it was a positive
factor and 33.4 percent said it
was a negative factor. However
these numbers were generally
in the minor positive and minor
negative categories rather than
the major positive and major
negative categories. 447
students, or 42.5 percent, said
the single-sex status had no ef-
fect on their decision to enroll.

An objective question, ‘Is
coeducation in the best interest
of W&L as a quality institu-
tion?’’ was also asked. Bowen
found “a shift in sentiment”
between whether a_ student
thought W&L should go coed
and whether it was in the
school’s best interest.

Many students who did not
want the school to go coed
seemed to believe that coeduca-
tion was in the school’s best in-
terest. For example, 29.4 per-
cent, or 309, of the students said
they were strongly opposed to
coeducation. However, 191, or
19.2 percent said it was strongly
not in W&L’s best interest to go
coed.

In terms of the advantages
and disadvantages of coeduca-
tion, W&L students saw a
“more natural and improved

Dr. David Novack advised a W&L student who found support for coeducation.

social atmosphere as the most
important advantage” rather
than academic advantages. The
biggest disadvantage seen by
students was ‘“‘loss of. tradi-
tion.” :

The faculty survey produced
some opposite opinions, though.
The increasing acadcmic pool
and better academics were
cited more frequently as advan-
tages of coeduation than was
the factor of a better social en-
vironment.

Faculty members also named
the expenses involved in going
coeducational and the possible
loss of alumni support as well as
the loss of tradition as disad-
vantages of going coed.

Additional analysis showed
that many faculty members
thought female students would
enhance the academic, social
and classroom environments.

**'.the faculty desire compe-
tent students,’”’ Bowen wrote.
“It looks as though the faculty
are calling for coeducation and
the improved academics which
would follow.”

In his final section, Bowen
wrote, “The majority of stu-
dents believe that the social at-
mosphere at W&L is lacking,
lacking in women and thus
naturalness.”

One question asked students
if they would choose W&L
again. 47 percent of the students
said they ‘‘were not happy
enough with the school to say
they would choose it again.”’ 522
of the 1,050 respondents would
choose W&L again.

In addition, there is a strong
relationship between whether a
student would choose W&L
again and whether he thought

ste

     

W&L should go coed. Students
who would not choose W&L
tended to be in favor of coeduca-
tion, and vice versa.

“This table certainly is
evidence of student dissatisfac-
tion and that this discontent-
ment is related to W&L’s being
an all-male institution,’’ Bowen
wrote.

In the conclusion to the sum-
mary of his report Bowen
wrote, “These two surveys...ap-
pear to indicate that the current
W&L ‘mood’ favors coeduca-
tion.”

And in the introduction to his
main report, he wrote, ‘‘What I
have found more commonly
seems to be a sort of tolerance
rather than a celebration for
single-sex education.

“Although Washington and
Lee’s single-sex student body is
an attractive option for some
students, many others seem
stigmatized. Many students feel
awkward about the single-sex
nature of their school.’’

In an interview earlier this
week from the University of
Richmond, where he is a law
student, Bowen said, “‘I was op-
posed to coeducation before I
did all the research. I was very
concerned about W&L’s tradi-
tions and I still am. I’m very
proud of the school. But I think
it can be better.

“T think it loses out on good
Students and some of the pres-
tige it could have if it were coed.
“A lot of people are not that
informed on the issue,” he con-
cluded. “‘If they had both sides
of the issue, a lot more people
who are opposed to coeducation
might be in favor of it.”

Athletic ‘headaches’ possible

By PAUL CLARK
Staff Reporter

While much has been written
ibout the subject of coeduca-
ion, problems of athletic facili-
y renovation, coaching and re-
‘ruitment have not been
yrought up. According to Wash-
ngton and Lee Athletic Direc-
or Bill McHenry, coeducation
vould cause ‘‘a_ lot of
ieadaches”’ in the halls of
Joremus Gym and on Wilson
Field.

Coach McHenry has _ been
busy conducting his own re-
search into the matter ever
since the issue of coeducation
was re-raised. This Friday,

McHenry plans to offer to the
University Athletic Committee
his findings concerning the in-
tegration of a women’s athletic
program into the W&L athletic
department. He hopes his re-
port will serve as advice and
counsel to the committee, the
faculty and President Wilson,
he said.

The U.A.C. is an advisory
committee which, according to
Dr. George Ray, chairman of
the committee, ‘‘exists to ad-
vise the president and the ath-
letic director on all matters per-
taining to the athletic pro-

gram.”’

The committee is composed
of six faculty members as well
as two alumni and three student
representatives. The three stu-
dent members on this year’s
committee are Marty Bechtold
(784), Ian Banwell (’85) and
Gordon Ogden (’85). Dr. Ray
urges students to use these
representatives to com-
municate student opinion on the
matter of coeducation. How-
ever, Dr. Ray emphasized, ‘I
have not been directed by the
President to look at coeducation
(in sports) in any formal way.
We have held informal discus-
sions in case coeducation be-
comes a reality, and have iden-
tified areas in which coeduca-
tion would have an impact.”

Ray also said that at this
point, or until a decision can be
made on the issue, nothing de-
finitive can be said.

McHenry outlines in his re-
port several of his concerns
about the athletic department
should it be forced to ‘‘go coed.”’
One of the many problems with
the aspect of coeducation is
simple logistics and a lack of
space. Current conditions are
grossly inadequate for any
change of the student body in
sports. he said. Making a sports

program coed these days re-
quires an expense of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
McHenry also cites a terrible
shortage of field space for such
a change.

“We're dealing with a lot of
money when talking about

renovation on this major a

scale,”’ he said.

There is currently not enough
field space to support football,
lacrosse, soccer and baseball
for the men. as well as field
hockey, lacrosse, soccer and
softball for women’s teams,
McHenry said. In addition, for
the women’s teams to be able to
join and to participate in con-
ference championships, W&L
must have a minimum of four
varsity women’s teams. Final-
ly, to make the sports program
coed, other space than just field
space must be found, McHenry
said.

At this point, there is no space
for the addition of locker rooms
for female athletes. Such space
would call for major renovation
of current facilities and addi-
tional construction to provide
adequate facilities. Office
space, said McHenry, is
already a prized possession and
there is absolutely no more
room for offices in the gym

 

unless drastic work occurs in
that department also.

Another aspect coeducation
would bring is the operational
difficulty to the athletic depart-
ment. There would have to be
provisions in the budget, said
McHenry, that ‘‘would allow the
hiring of new coaches, interns
and administrators’ to cope
with the change in the depart-
ment. Almost all of the new per-
sonnel would have to be women
“so we are in compliance with
Title [X,”” McHenry said. (Title
IX is an NCAA rule and federal
regulation which states that
equal facilities and equal oppor-
tunities must be present for
men and women in a coeduca-
tional school.) Coach McHenry

Athletic Director Bill McHenry

 

 

 

added, “‘I don’t think Title IX
would allow an all-male staff to
coach a coed sports program.”’
Here, McHenry is faced with
possible cutbacks in his current
staff to allow the hiring of
female coaches, trainers, in-
terns and administrators that
will be required.

“I would hate to think that we
would have to force some of the
staff from their jobs because of
budget problems entailed by go-
ing coed,”’ he said.

Other budget problems exist.
Somewhere in the endowment
or through outside contributions
must come the funds which will
enable W&L to add all of the
women’s sports to the program:
field hockey, volleyball, la-
crosse, softball, cross country,
track, swimming, golf and ten-
nis. Of these, says McHenry,

Powell, Mudd, Dobyns comment

Three prominent W&L alum-
ni — Supreme Court Justice
Lewis G. Powell, Roger Mudd
and Lloyd Dobyns — also ex-
pressed opinions on coeducation
in interviews with the Ring-tum
Phi this week.

Powell (’29, ’31L) declined
comment on the coeducation
situation “because of my posi-
tion on the Court’’ and ‘“‘because
I don’t know enough about it.’’

Justice Powell said that
‘‘within the last month”’ he had
sent a letter to President Wilson
expressing his views on coedu-
cation.

However, the Justice says
now that ‘‘that letter was not
written in light of some infor-
mation about population trends
that is now being assembled.”’

In a recent decision of the
United States Supreme Court
involving the Mississippi Col-
lege for Women, a state institu-
tion that had been unisex for
many years, the justices upheld
that the all-women policy was
discriminatory since it was a
government school.

 

“WE&L is not

about to go broke.

I don’t agree

that it’s something

that has to be
done

by September.”
—Lloyd Dobyns

 

In a dissenting opinion to the
5-4 decision, Justice Powell ex-
pressed his view that the oppor-
tunity for a choice was an op-
portunity tlt was worth pre-
serving in the courts. That
diversity, he wrote, was a
characteristic of both the
United States and its popula-
tion, and was a tradition. The
country, Justice Powell said,
was made up of diversity.

He also made reference in the
dissenting opinion to the tradi-
tion of excellence which many
women’s colleges had achieved,
including some of the local
women’s colleges. They have
produced superb academic op-
portunities, he said.

Mudd (’50), a correspondent
for NBC News, said, ‘‘My view
is that I’m in favor of retaining
a few good all-male schools.”
He also said said he thinks there
should be some quality all-fe-
male institutions.

As a member of the Board of
Trustees of Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College from 1971 to
1978, Mudd observed an experi-
ment they conducted with coed-
ucation. “It never really work-
ed out satisfactorily for
anybody,” he recalls.

“The women regarded the
men as nuisances. The men felt
set apart — they didn’t feel they
had the facilities. They became
sort of cranks.”’

Mudd was unimpressed by
some of the arguments in favor
of coeducation that are cir-
culating. ‘‘I never felt deprived
of any social experience or any
sort of knowledge that I needed.
We had fairly easy access,” he
said.

He also remarked, “I never
heard that W&L is in financial
trouble.”

Dobyns (’57), editor and an-
chor of NBC News’s “First
Camera,”’ said, “I wouldn’t be
in favor of it. I’m not against it,

  

,

Roger Mudd ( W&L *50)

but I’d have to know a good
reason for it.’’

Dobyns said that the declin-
ing pool of students is a reality,
but “‘to do something because it
is economically desirable is a
very poor reason.

“W&L is not about to go
broke. I don’t agree that it’s
something that has to be done
by September. I know better
than that.’’

“The reasons for having them
are the better argument,’ he
continued. ‘‘That’s the way we
live. If we could all go back to
Victorian clubs, that would be

‘ fine, but we can’t...It thay well

be that these students will work
in a company headed by a wom-
an and think nothing of it.”

W&L students, Dobyns says,
can sometimes get unaccustom-
ed to that attitude toward
women. “When I was here,
women were quite pleasant
starting at 2 p.m. on Friday,
and as long as they were gone
by Sunday night, no harm was
done, and maybe even some
good.

 

_ History

“God knows that was true.
That was undeniably true. It’s
an invalid attitude and is
counterproductive to the liberal
arts education. You can’t argue
for it.’’

“If you’re not used to coping
with something, you’re going to
have difficulties dealing with
it,” Dobyns said. With coeduca-
tion, ‘‘the easiest way to deal
with it would be to say,‘Ha! Ha!
They’ve let a few of the play
things in permanently so that
those of us who want to can play
for seven days instead of two.’ ”’

While the traditional attitudes

about women may not be ap- .

plicable to today’s world, he
says “‘it is also true, whether we
like it or not, that it is easier to
pay attention in class when
there’s nothing to look at be-
sides the blackboard. It is very
difficult not to look at a good-
looking woman.”

If the implementation of
coeducation were being con-

sidered, Dobyns says, ‘‘I would
hope that they would consult the
students, and even go some-
what beyond that.

“It would be interesting to
talk to the future students of
W&L. See what they have to say
about it. The future students are
going to be the ones who have to
live with this.’’

Dobyns was asked his reac-
tion to two slogans being used
by anti-coeducation students on
campus. if

“Better Dead Than Coed”’:
“‘That’s the dumbest thing I’ve
ever heard. What a silly thing to
say. W&L is not going to be de-
stroyed because it lets women
in. That’s pathetically dumb.
Whether it’s desirable is
another question.”

“Girls in the Hay, but not All
Day’’: ‘‘Physiologically,
women are capable of doing
what they do in the hay for the
whole day. Men aren’t.’’

—Mike Allen

 

(continued from page 2)

The recommendation of that
study was to remain all-male.
“They didn’t close the door,”
said Parsons, ‘“‘but they found
no compelling reason at that
time for the University to aban-
don an academic role it had
been filling for a long time —
usefully and successfully.’’

Throughout the _ period,
Huntley consistently consulted
with presidents of recently
coeducated schools, said Par-
sons.

‘‘He was friends with a group.

of presidents of schools that
were similar in size and educa-
tional character to W&L. He
received a lot of good informa-
tion from highly regarded
peers,’’ said Parsons.

decides to go coed, if they are
ever going to do so.

“The general climate is that
there is a greater urgency for
them to make their decision and
get on with it.”

According to Parsons, the
students this year, in com-
parison with years past, ‘‘are
more active in their response
and seem more inclined to come

a eat ate at eaaninaem ate tp

to the defense of the status "a

quo.”

“There is a new element in
student reaction as well,’’ said
Parsons. Students feel more
personally threatened than they
have in previous years, an at-
titude Parsons attributes at
least partially to a fear of a
“potential for change in their
social patterns.”

While Parsons is still ‘‘per-
sonally wrestling’ with the
question, he cited Huntley’s
1968 Parent’s Weekend com-
ment as being as ‘‘true today as
ever.”” When asked when W&L
was going to go coed, Huntley
responded that he did not know
if or when the change would oc-
cur, but that “W&L, with our
history, could not be allowed to
go out of business providing an
alternative no one wants,’’ Par-
sons said.

Fifteen years later, his words
have a hauntingly familiar
sound.

1) “Social fraternities at
Washington and Lee area
valuable and integral part of both
the University and Lexington
communities;”’ coeducation
threatens the existence of
fraternities here at W&L.

2) We think there are other
alternatives to coeducation:
better recruitment, more scholar-
ships, and increased alumni
involvement.

Let’s make sure of our facts and figures
before we make an irreversible change.
