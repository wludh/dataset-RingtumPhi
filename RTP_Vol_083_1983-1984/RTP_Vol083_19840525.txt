The Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees,
meeting in Lexington this
weekend, will devote a major
part of its schedule to studying
the question of undergraduate
coeducation.

When the trustees meet, com-
mittee meetings are normally
held on Friday, and the full 25-
member Board meets Saturday.

60 indictments recommended

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

About 60 indictments and heightened drug
prevention efforts by area schools were
recommended by the special grand jury in-
vestigating local drug trafficking, Circuit
Court Judge George E. Honts III said in a
statement this week.

‘In recommending the approximately six-
ty persons for indictment, we feel that we
have only begun to scratch the surface in
seeking out the users and dealers,”’ the nine-
member jury said in its report.

Honts has said he will not comment on the
number of students who might be involved
with the indictments, which he said were
mostly for felony offenses

During its seven-month investigation, the
special grand jury interviewed more than 200
witnesses, including students and ad-
ministrators from Washington and Lee and

Virginia Military Institute.

In addition, certain student records from
both schools were subpoenaed by the panel.
Some Student Control Committee records
were released to the jury in late January.

The judge on Monday issued the one page
of ‘‘conclusions’’ by the panel, and said that
except for any possible indictments stem-
ming from the jury’s recommendations, he
did not intend to unseal any additional por-
tions of the report.

Recommendations from the special grand
jury can be referred by the Commonwealth’s
Attorney to the regular grand jury, which
can issue indictments.

In his statement, Honts said that while the
grand jury may be recalled at any time,
“whether that Grand Jury will be recalled
has not been determined at this time.”’

When the special jury was impaneled last
October, the judge directed it ‘‘to investigate
recent illegal drug trafficking and certain

other criminal activities in this community.”
“There is, indeed, a large circle of drug
dealers and users within the area, affecting
all age groups, from high schools through the
"oe and involving all levels of socie-
Honts quoted the special grand jury as
Al

The report said that W&L and VMI should
‘implement stringent screening of all incom-
ing freshmen”’ and ‘‘develop affirmative and
effective guidelines for anti-drug programs,
working in concert with the local law en-
forcement authorities. ’’

The jury advised further that when
students or cadets are dismissed for drug
use, possession or dealing, they should be
turned over to local officials for prosecution
The report said that students should be ad-
vised of that policy at the beginning of each
school year

Trustees to discuss
coed, promotions

their reports to a special session
of the full Board on coeducation
this afternoon

Regular committee business
was conducted this morning, and
the regular Board meeting will
be held tomorrow, with adjourn
ment scheduled for the early
afternoon.

Wilson said the trustees are
expected to approve four new
department chairmen for next
year: Dr. Delos D. Hughes in
Politics, Dr. John K. Jennings in
Journalism and Communica-
tions, Dr. Minor L. Rogers in
Religion and Dr. Sidney J.
Williams Jr. in Romance
Languages.

A final decision on coeducation
is expected at a special meeting
of the Board scheduled for July
13 and 14.

Wilson said he expects that
this weekend will be a time of
reflection and discussion of the
subject by Board members.

“The only decision that could
be made at this meeting would
be a ‘no’ decision, and I don’t ex-
pect that to happen,” he said. “‘I
expect the Board will spend its
time learning from each other.”’

The president said he wants
“mainly to listen’ at this
meeting. ‘‘In July, I’ll obviously
have to make a recommenda-
tion, and I'll do that then,’’ he
said.

“T’ll serve as faithfully as |
possibly can to execute the
Board’s decision, whatever it
is,’ he added.

‘T continue to read what alum-
ni continue to tell me at some
length — both pro and con,’’ he
said.

Review and Outlook

Coeducation and
the Burden of Proof

It is safe to say that coeducation has been the most
burning issue affecting Washington and Lee in the
past five years. This is for good reason, as it is a ques-
tion of extreme depth and importance, cutting
straight to the heart of Washington and Lee’s past and
bearing directly on Washington and Lee’s future. It is
necessary that the question of whether Washington
and Lee is to remain — and should remain — single-
sex be asked.

Some have run into the face of coeducation blindly,
waving a flag of tradition. Others have answered the
question just as blindly, saying it is needed for pro-
gress. The question should not be dealt with on an
emotional level; it calls for sober reflection on the ef-
fects of coeducation as well as the effects of remain-
ing single-sex. The question appears to be one of
necessity. Is it necessary for Washington and Lee to
admit women to avert an admissions crisis in the
future? Is it necessary to admit women to improve
even further the academic atmosphere? President
Wilson has said that in the face of such a drastic and
far-reaching change, the burden of proof must lie with
the one advocating the change. We cannot agree
more.

Demographics has been one of the strongest argu-
ments put forth by the proponents of coeducation. A
close study of the numbers reveals that the drop is not
as staggering as it may seem. Assuming that the 30
percent drop among college-age youths in Wash-
ington and Lee’s principal 15-state market is ac-
curate, the actual loss of students would only amount
to three per state each year over the specified ten-
year period. Certainly this is not an insurmountable
barrier, and we hope coeducation is not a panic re-
sponse to simple statistics.

Another point of contention is the strong possibility
that coeducation would greatly diminish the tremen-
dous individuality that Washington and Lee enjoys.
Certainly the Honor System and the traditions of
Lee’s teachings would separate Washington and Lee
from the rest of the nation’s colleges, but it is likely
that the school would slip back into the pack and be
another small, liberal arts school. Individuality in
universities today is a precious commodity.

We have not been sufficiently convinced that
coeducation at Washington and Lee is necessary in
the near future. We would hope that more aggressive
recruiting might help solve the anticipated admis-
sions problem. Certainly finding three more students
from each of our top 15 states is not an impossible
recruiting task.

We are convinced, however, of the validity of the
adage, ‘‘When it is not necessary to change, it is
necessary not to change.’’ We are by no means saying

that Washington and Lee should never admit women
to its undergraduate program, rather that it is not
necessary at this particular time.

Coed: no wonder drug?

To the Editors:

For several months we have
been inundated with the pros and
cons of coeducation (ad
nauseam, I might add) and a lot
of us think that we've heard
enough. Debates, letters,
forums, polls, polls and more
polls have almost numbed many
into apathy, but here is just
another note on the issue.

I like women just as much as
the next heterosexual W&L
gentleman, but I cannot say that
I am totally committed to a
policy of coeducation because I
fail to see what problems co-
education will eliminate. I am
told it will ‘‘raise the academic
standards,’ but aren’t there
other ways of accomplishing the
same goal while remaining a
single-sex institution? I am told
that ‘“‘coeducation is the in-
evitable destiny of single-sex
schools’’ because everyone else
is doing it, but does that mean it
is right for us? There is a big dif-
ference between being different
and being wrong. Further, I am

told that it would ‘‘add variety to
the classroom experience,” but
then I ask, ‘“‘Why did we pick
W&L in the first place?” There
are other small, fine quality,
coed schools in this country,
aren’t there? The sexual homo-
geneity of W&L is no secret.
Gentlemen, we have a lot of
thinking to do, but first we must
realize that coeducation is no
wonder drug to cure all the ails
of this institution. In fact, it
might even bring greater prob-
lems than the ones we face at the

present. This is not a silly issue
like the infamous ‘‘tie episode.”
We owe it to ourselves and to the
future generations of W&L
students to consider carefully
this decision. Let not students 20
years hence look back regretful-
ly, and question, ‘‘Are we better
off now than we were in 1984?”
My mother used to warn, ‘‘look
before you leap.’’ This time it
might serve us well to take heed
my mother’s warning.

MS thanks IFC pie eaters

To the Editors:

On behalf of the Blue Ridge
Chapter of the National Multiple
Sclerosis Society I would like to
thank the folks who contributed
their time and energies in mak-
ing the sixth annual IFC pie-
eating contest, to benefit MS, the
biggest success ever — the IFC,
Dave Perdue, the stadium

grounds crew, Dee Miriello,
Burr Datz and the Delts. Over
$500 was raised at halftime of the

Jenevein applauds Wilson

To the Editors:

Enough controversy for one
year! I’m not writing to take a
stand or to chastise someone
else’s stand on a controversial
issue. I had my fill a long time
ago. I’m writing to thank one
member of this community for
his service which, due to its
nature, required courage and
strength of character. I’m
speaking of President Wilson.
Ever since his arrival last year,
he has butted heads with the stu-

dent body and to a lesser extent,
with the alumni. Speaking from
personal experience, it’s no fun
to butt heads and to incur the
wrath of W&L_ students.
Nevertheless, John D. Wilson
has stood by his convictions and
by his vision of a_ better
Washington and Lee. I can
assure you from my extensive
dealings with him that those con-
victions and that vision are inex-
tricably intertwined. His only
goal for our great school is to

such a goal may seem trite or ob-

President much more lonely
than it had to be.

In closing, we are not obliga-

to approve of the President’s

applaud a man whose integrity
has bound him to his beliefs in

Faculty to recommend

degree for Dederick

The faculty voted 47-38 Mon-
day not to reconsider its original
decision to award a diploma to
William Dederick, who was ar-
rested just prior to his gradua-
tion last May and was later con-
victed on three drug-related
charges.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee suspended Dederick for one
academic year in October and
the faculty recommended he
receive a degree May 7, when it
reviewed degree applications for
1984 commencement.

But journalism professor
Clark Mollenhoff asked Univer-

sity President John D. Wilson to
present the matter to the facul-
ty again because, Mollenhoff
said, the first faculty vote was
based on an incomplete record.

Public record at Clerk of Court
Bruce Patterson’s office show
that, while pleading guilty to
selling cocaine, possessing co-
caine and possessing marijuana
with the intent to distribute,
Dederick admitted to making a
40 percent profit on a sale of co-
caine and threatening the life of
a student who had bought co-
caine from him.

Fellin honored
with ODK award

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s chapter of the national
leadership fraternity Omicron
Delta Kappa has given its
Rupert N. Latture Outstanding
Sophomore Award posthumous-
ly to Thomas J. Fellin, the stu-
dent who died in a fraternity
house fire in April.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton and state investigators
announced May 15 that the April
11 early-morning fire at the Phi
Gamma Delta house probably
was the result of arson.

No suspects have yet been
identified or arrested in the
case, though.

Established in 1981, the award
is given to the Washington and
Lee sophomore who best exem-
plifies the ideals of Omicron
Delta Kappa, which was estab-
lished on the W&L campus in
1914 to recognize leadership in
campus activities — scholastic,
athletic, social, religious and
literary.

The Latture Award is named
for the sole surviving founder of
ODK. Latture, a 1915 graduate of
Washington and Lee, was pro-

fessor of political science at the
univesity from 1920 to 1962.

“Tom Fellin’s death was a loss
felt deeply by every member of
the Washington and Lee fami-
ly,” said W&L junior Christo-
pher Williams, president of the
Alpha Circle of ODK. ‘“‘He em-
bodied all those ideals that ODK
represents, and we felt it was on-
ly appropriate that we make this
award to him.”

A graduate of Bishop Hafey
High School in Hazleton, Pa.,
Fellin was an honor roll (a

grade-point average of at least
3.5 on a 4.33 scale) student and
had been one of Washington and
Lee’s two nominees for a Harry
S. Truman Scholarship.

He had been inducted into Phi
Eta Sigma, the national fraterni-
ty recognizing outstanding
scholarship by freshmen, and
was a member of the College Re-
publicans.

_He served as co-president of
the Phi Gamma Delta social
fraternity, had been co-chair-
man of the Pennsylvania delega-
tion to the W&L Mock Demo-
cratic Convention, and was a
member of the varsity baseball
team.

the faculty (at the first vote) was
incomplete,’ Mollenhoff said
Tuesday.

At Monday’s special meeting,
Mollenhoff told the faculty of the
additional information from the
public record.

“I spelled out what I con-
sidered to be the complete
record and felt that the faculty
should have the complete record
befor the vote,” Mollenhoff said.

After an hour and 15 minutes
of debate, the faculty voted not
to reconsider their original deci-
sion.

“I feel what the faculty did,
they did with their eyes open this
time,”’ Mollenhoff said. He add-
ed that he does not plan to take
further action.

The Board of Trustees has the
power to overturn the faculty’s
recommendation of any student
diploma, but University spokes-

man Jeffrey Hanna said he could
not recall that happening before.

Caruthers thanks Jenevein

To the Editors:

In this last issue I wanted to
write and thank Robert Jenevein
for this year. I’m writing not
necessarily to thank Bob for
specific issues, but I am writing
in order to thank him for his
commitment and strong dedica-
tion to Washington and Lee
University. This year I’ve
witnessed the ‘‘all’” he has been
willing to give and has given to
W&L.

One might put Bob down for
raising some _ controversial
issues this year, but I want to re-
mind everyone that Bob has had
enough guts to stand up for what
he believed in his heart would be
best for W&L in the long run,
even if his belief made him an
unpopular man on campus. I ad-
mire Bob for taking his some-
times unpopular stands. One
must remember that some
alumni and Board members
have supported his stands; the
President of the Student Body
can often be caught in two
worlds.

But enough of that, I am
writing only in order to express

my utmost respect for Bob’s
firm dedication and leadership.
His office on the average re-
quires about three to six hours of
his time every day. Bob has
fulfilled his obligation to the stu-
dent body and has given a little
more. I want to thank Robert
Jenevein for giving the most
valuable gift a person can give to

EC, SBA near agreement on funding control

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

After lengthy negotiations,
subcommittees of the Executive
Committee and the Student Bar
Association have been unable to
agree on the exact amount of law
school student activities funds to
be returned to the SBA. But the
two sides did agree that the SBA
will have almost complete con-
trol over those funds.

“We won't set a percentage
until we figure out a method that
everyone agrees on because
we’ve got our method, and
they’ve got their method,”’ vice
president-elect James White
said.

Monday night, White had
reported to the EC that
preliminary estimates of the
percentage of the law school’s
contribution to the EC that
would be controlled by the SBA
were 84 or 87 percent. Tuesday,
however, White said that those
figures were arrived at while
laying the groundwork for a final
decision and were not binding.

“‘We’ll have a meeting at the
beginning of next year, when
we'll agree on a new method.
Then a new percentage will be
set. We apologize for the delay,
but we want to make sure it’s
done right,”’ explained White.

elect Pat Hayden and sopho-
more representative-elect

EC’s negotiating team for the
talks. SBA President-elect John
Sicilian represented the SBA.

“We anticipate it will work out
very smoothly because we're go-
ing to work it out before school
starts. I don’t see any problems
with it. I think it’s going to work
out great,’’ White added.

Although no fixed precentage
was set, Hayden said it had been
helpful to at least start the talks
this spring.

White said that the percentage
of funds the SBA will control will
vary from year to year. The SBA
president and the EC president
will set the figure at the begin-
ning of each year, White explain-
ed.

White said that although the
negotiating group officially was
a subcommittee of this year’s
EC, it did not have to reach an
agreement on the fixed percen-
tage this year. The matter is
really up to next year’s EC,
White argued.

official fiscal autonomy regar-
ding the fixed percentage of
funds allocated to them, White

said the SBA will be ‘running

their own show.”’ The EC will
have no line-by-line veto power
over the SBA and will only retain
“emergency veto’’ rights, White
said.

“It’s fiscal autonomy in ef-

Hayden said both the SBA and
EC agreed it would be imprac-

autonomy for the SBA this

spring.

White reported that in order
for the SBA’s fiscal autonomy to
become official a constitutional
amendment would have to be
passed. An amendment pro-
viding for a second-year law

this month, and the law school
students are not even here any-

“This is going to be a major
step to reduce all the tension be-

Calendar vote to be made in fall;
October break is part of proposal

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The faculty will vote early
next fall on the calendar com-
mittee report, which includes a
recommendation that Thanks-
giving vacation be replaced by a
one-week vacation in the middle
of October.

The committee, composed of
eight faculty members and two
students, completed its work and
submitted its report to universi-
ty President John D. Wilson
April 30.

In addition to the vacation
change, the report also recom-
mends that classes be extended
to 55 minutes and calls for con-
tinuation of the 12-12-6 calendar
system.

“I have no quarrel with the
committee’s report (regarding
the 12-12-6),’’ Wilson said in an
interview this week.

Although Wilson emphasized
that he will try to remain neutra)

 

toll-free

i

as chairman of the faculty
meeting, “‘I don’t think there’s
any way I would feel good,”
about changing the vacation
schedule, he added.

“I’m not persuaded it would be
wise,”’ said Wilson, adding that
if there were no Thanksgiving
vacation, many students might
go home that week anyway.

Wilson said the report will be
reviewed by the faculty
Registration Committee and the
faculty Executive Committee
before being presented to the
faculty as a whole. He said he ex-
pects a decision to be made in
September or October. —

Senior Lee Feldman, a student
member of the calendar com-
mittee, said he expected both the
12-12-6 and the 55-minute classes
to pass the faculty, but added,
‘Your guess is as good as mine”’
as to whether the proposed
change in the vacation schedule
would be approved.

Feldman said the committee,
which had been meeting since
September, ‘‘was very receptive
to hearing from students. The
committee worked well as a

whole.
“It came down to a classic

Thanksgiving break was repre-
sentative of that. The students
were pretty much disregarded
when it came to the Thanksgiv-
ing break.”’

A student poll taken in March
showed support for the 12-12-6,
but strong opposition to 55-
minute classes and the change in
the vacation schedule.

“We didn’t feel the report ade-
quately reflected student sen-
timents,’’ Feldman said.

The committee’s report also
suggests that ways to relieve
faculty members of the burden
of registration be examined. It
suggests having students return-
ing the following year register
for the entire year’s classes in
the preceding spring as one
possible alternative.

Attached to the committee’s
report is a proposed calendar
that would consist of five six-
week sessions that individual
students or departments could
adjust according to their needs.
Wilson called modular scheme
‘‘a different idea...It would ac-
commodate the different disci-
plines much more readily.”’

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The 1984 school year will
witness the promotion of two
faculty members to emeritus
status, five new department
heads, and three new faculty
members in the military science
department.

Professor of Romance Langu-
ages George F. Drake and Pro-
fessor of Engineering Henry L.
Ravenhorst will both retire at
the end of the current academic
year and become professors
emerti. Their experiences at
Washington and Lee exhibit
some parallels.

“When I first came to
Washington and Lee in 1940, I
had never taught before,’’ said
Drake, the University’s senior
faculty member. Drake’s doubts
concerning whether or not he
was cut out to be a teacher were
quickly dispelled following that
first class held in Robinson 2, the
room next door to his current of-
fice.

“T didn’t even have a master’s
degree at that time,’’ Drake
said. “I began just as an instruc-
tor.” Drake never received a
master’s, but earned his doc-
torate from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In his 44 years of teaching,
Drake has instructed both
French and chemistry. During
World War II, when student
enrollment dwindled ‘‘to 35 or 50
students”, he taught chemistry
in the Army’s AST program. For
18 months, he taught in the
Enlisted Reserve Corps at VMI.
“It was difficult to get jobs ...

up,’”’ said Drake in reference to
the military draft.

Professor Ravenhorst has
taught at Washington and Lee
since 1949. Like Drake, he taught
at VMI, as well as at some sum-
mer military schools.

“‘T had no inclination to go into
teaching until after the (Second
World) War,”’ said Ravenhorst,
who retired in the Reserves 10
years ago. A licensed architect,
he planned to go strictly into ar-
chitecture, yet he considers his
teaching job “‘a very useful and
well-rounded experience.”

Educationally, the two pro-
fessors have very opposite
backgrounds. Ravenhorst is a
1935 W&L graduate, while Drake
graduated from the country’s
first coeducational under-
graduate institution, Oberlin
College, in 1936.

Both, however, have similar
opinions on the issue of coeduca-
tion. Drake believes that if W&L
reaches a point where the life of
the University and its high
academic standards are en-
dangered because of remaining
single sex, then coeducation is
the solution. “I’m not thoroughly
convinced we have reached that
point,”’ he said.

“Basically, with my status as
an alumnus, I feel there is a need
for a single sex school,” says
Ravenhorst, who did graduate
work at Harvard, Dartmouth,
and the University of Alaska.
Due to his high regard for the
Board of Trustees, Ravenhorst
expects the Trustees to deter-
mine what is best for the Univer-
sity. ‘I would certainly feel that
the University could adjust ... ,”’
he said.

Neither of the two professors
has seen a tremendous change in
the students since the 1940’s,
although Ravenhorst has seen
his department’s emphasis
move from_ professional-type
degrees toward a more general
engineering degree.

“Since we changed, we have a
degree in what we call physics
engineering,’ said Ravenhorst,
who received his bachelor’s
degree in electrical engineering.
When he was a student, the
University gave more profes-
sional degrees in specific engi-
neering fields, while the contem-
porary curriculum is meant to
teach basic courses concerning
all aspects of engineering.

Due to the University’s liberal
arts atmosphere, Ravenhorst
sees no need to change the cur-
riculum. “I think what we have
here is a very good program,”
he said.

While neither professor has
specific plans about working at
the University in the future, both
will remain in Lexington. ‘‘This
is, I feel, my home,” said Drake.
‘I’ve lived here longer than any-
where else.”’

Ravenhorst, who will maintain
his private architectural prac-
tice with his son, hopes to com-
plete work on a book relating the
history of W&L’s engineering
department. He and Drake are
both proud to be associated with
Washington and Lee.

“Tt have a great fondness for
Washington and Lee, and some
marvelous contacts with friends
and colleagues here,’’ Drake
said.

Elsewhere on the hill, five
department heads will be step-
ping down for the start of the
1984-85 academic year. Ap-
pointed to a five-year term by
the Board of Trustees, a depart-
ment head may be reappointed,
may ask to step down, and must
step down upon reaching the age
of 65.

Hudson death probe ended

The investigation into the traf-

charges being filed against the
driver of the car, Duncan Stone,
another W&L student.

Jury opposition leader steps down

By ALLEN REESE
and
TORI RICHARDSON
Staff Reporters

Angela Fawcett, a central
figure in the opposition to the
special grand jury, is abandon-
ing her leadership role in oppos-
ing the drug investigations.

“If there is another public
meeting, I feel it would be best
for someone else to head the
coordination,’’ Fawcett said. ‘‘I
can’t afford any more publicity.
However, I wouldn’t mind work-
ing behind the scenes.”

Fawcett said her leadership
role has thrust her into a position
she had not envisioned, and has,
at least temporarily, deprived
her of the custody of her daugh-
ter, Shandah.

Recently, Shandah’s father,
Jonathan Lyle Naff, has been in
contact with Rockbridge County
law officials trying to get
custody of his daughter, accord-
ing to Rockbridge County Sheriff
S.M. Reynolds.

However, due to the recent
controversy, Fawcett said she
voluntarily turned over her
daughter to Naff’s parents until
she disengaged herself from the
Rockbridge County drug investi-
gation.

“Jonathan never tried to get
custody of Shandah. He only
became concerned about her
general welfare after reading
Roanoke Times & World-News
reporter Mary Bishop’s article
on me in the paper.”

“He doesn’t object to me as a
parent. He does, however, object
to the situation that I have gotten
myself into.”

Fawcett claims that Ms.
Bishop’s article had a few facts
that were incorrect and made
her appear to be an unfit mother.

“TI was totally disgusted with
the article because some facts
were wrong and it did nothing
for me except to give me more
bad publicity. As it is now, Iam
forced to hitchhike everywhere
because local law officials are
still harassing me. I can’t even
drive my car around town with-
out being pulled over for some
trivial matter,’’ she claimed.

According to Fawcett, Naff’s
parents, who reside in Roanoke,
have supported her and have en-
dorsed her as the legal guardian
of Shandah.

““Naff’s parents are like my
own. They respect me and agree
that I am the better parent. They
would never back Jonathan if a
custody battle did happen to
arise. However, they are upset
that I didn’t gracefully bow out
of this situation and try to avoid
publicity,”’ she said.

Naff, a 23-year-old self-
employed painting contractor,
has been indicted and convicted
for robbery. He was given 10
years to be served in the
Virginia State Penitentiary. His
time was reduced to approx-
imately four years. He is now on
probation.

Fawcett earlier had admitted
to the use of LSD, marijuana and

Frat gives $500 donation

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s chapter of Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity presented
Stonewall Jackson Hospital with
a $500 donation this week.

The fraternity raised the
money for the gift through a raf-
fle, which was supported by
numerous Lexington merchants.

Lambda Chi Alpha president
Fred Bentley and vice president
Richard DeForest made the
presentation Monday to L.E.

Richardson, executive vice
president of the Stonewall
Jackson Hospital.

According to Richardson, the

fraternity’s gift will be used to
purchase surgical instruments
for use in the hospital’s new
surgical wing.

Bentley said the fraternity,
which has approximately 25
members, plans to make its
fund-raising program an annual
event.

‘Most of us only live in the
community four years, and we
felt it was only appropriate that
we give something back to the
community,’’ Benley said. ‘‘We
decided upon the _ hospital
because there is clearly a need
with the new wing being built.”’

of feeling about coeducation
—for example, why they express
such concern and reservations
about any fundamental change,
however well-intentioned, which
may upset that ambiance
they’ve come to know and love.”’

Prior to becoming the 2lst
president of W&L early last
year, Wilson served as executive
vice president and provost of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
Blacksburg.

“T think Washington and Lee is
more deeply rooted in Southern
culture than VPI is, even though

VPI draws almost entirely from
Virginia and Washington and
Lee is more cosmopolitan,”’ he
said. “‘It is a more deeply rooted
Southern institution.

“I think Robert E. Lee
translated with his own per-
sonality some of those
antebellum values’ which
became a part of the fabric of
this place and remain so today to
our great benefit.”

Wilson said the Executive
Committee, which he heads,
would Thursday examine the
“‘intangibles’’ of Washington and

cocaine. But she said she gave
up using cocaine because she
didn’t care for it.

She became known to the Lex-
ington community for her or-
ganization of a public meeting to
discuss the way officials had
been dealing with her and others
before the grand jury.

Fawcett said since she started
protesting the way the grand
jury had been conducting bus-
iness, her apartment has been
searched and several of her
friends have been questioned. In
addition, she said Jeff Peck of
Protective Services has been out
to her apartment to see if her
daughter was well cared for and

her car has been pulled over a
number of times and impound-
ed. She has also been brought up
before a judge on contempt
charges as a result of her grand
jury testimony. Fawcett said she
feels there was no reason for any
of this to have taken place.

Up until a few weeks ago,
Fawcett was trying to organize a
meeting between law enforce-
ment officials and members of
the public to talk about the grand
jury. However, the grand jury
recently issued its final report to
Judge Honts, ending the in-
vestigative part of their work.

Fawcett has been living away
from her Willow Spring apart-

ment since April 25 due to the
harassment she says she has
been subjected to.

“Since leaving my apartment,
several of my friends have been
busted. I think this is really
ludicrous.’’

Fawcett is now waiting for
Judge Honts to study the recom-
mendations of the special grand
jury and to decide on a course of
action.

“I already have a job waiting
for me when everything boils
over here with the grand jury
“Hopefully; things will be better
for Shandah and me when we
move and I am able to work
again.”

Frats told to clean up acts

Litter problem called ‘unsightly’ and ‘unsanitary’

By PEYTON CRAIGHILL
Special to the Phi

Washington and Lee and Lex-
ington have been plagued for
over 10 years with littered
fraternity house front lawns and
fly-infested dumpsters yet little
has been done to correct this un-
sightly problem.

In a letter dated March 14 of
this year, Health Department
Sanitarian Woody Bowyer wrote
Assistant Dean Dan Murphy, in-
forming him of the department’s
findings in its bi-annual inspec-
tion of the fraternity houses.

“The major problem we en-
counter at the frat houses is im-
proper garbage disposal,’’ he
wrote. ‘‘This department and the
city continually receive com-
plaints about the unsightly mess
and unsanitary conditions
around the garbage storage
areas.”

The trash problem isn’t new
—correspondence concerning it
litters the department’s files.

More than 10 years ago, in
February 1973, a similar letter
was sent to Dean of Students
Lewis John by then Sanitarian
Jack Talbot.

‘The garbage storage areas of
the various fraternities seem to
be the main trouble spot,’’ he
wrote. ‘If these areas were kept
in better condition the whole
campus would benefit.’”’

The university has assured the
Health Department the problem

English dept.

will be corrected.

In 1974 Dean John wrote
Talbot, ‘‘We shall certainly work
with the fraternities to correct
the deficiencies noted in your
reports.”’

A year later John echoed this
commitment. ‘‘You may be
sure,” he wrote, ‘‘that I shall
work with the presidents of the
fraternities involved in giving
particular attention to the trash
situation around the dumpsters
and garbage cans...”

Health Department records in-
dicate the major offenders are
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta,
Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa

Alpha, Sigma Chi and Sigma Nu. -

Last week, Dean Murphy sent
the presidents of these frater-
nities a letter urging them to buy
dumpsters and ‘‘take pride in
the appearance of your fraterni-
ty and become more aware of
the impact the appearance of
your house and lawn has on both
the fraternity system and Wash-
ington and Lee.”’

City and state regulations
don’t require dumpsters for gar-
bage storage areas, provided the
garbage is stored in proper con-
tainers not accessible to flies
and animals. However, several
fraternities continue to use open-
air enclosures that allow
animals in and garbage out.

Furthermore, dumpsters
alone aren’t the answer. The
latest Health Department in-
spection records indicate that
although Phi Delta Theta and

Wornom and Mahanawards

Five Washington and Lee
students were honored by the
W&L department of English dur-
ing an awards ceremony last
Thursday.

Grant David Hamrick won the
Jean Amory Wornom Award for
Distinguished Critical Writing
for a paper titled, ‘The
Language of the Fallen in John

Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’ ’’

Four students won George A.
Mahan Awards in Creative
Writing. David W. Ames won the
senior prose award for his story
titled ‘“‘Two Loves.’’ Robert D.
Bryant won the junior prose
award for “Darling, you gotta
let me know.”’ Brent M. O’Boyle
and J. Keith Pillow both won
freshman prose awards.

Sigma Nu share a dumpster on
Henry Street, there is ‘‘almost
as much trash on the ground as
in the dumpster.”

The problem is frustrating for
Health Department officials and
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment.

Both departments have the
power to issue summonses to of-
fending parties (which would re-
quire them to respond to the
charges in court) but a warning
must first be given.

‘‘We have to give an opportuni-
ty for one to clean up the mess
before we can issue a sum-
mons,”’ Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said. He said the time period for
voluntary compliance is gen-
erally 72 hours.

The only way the department
can give an immediate sum-
mons is if an officer actually
observes someone dropping the
trash. “‘If we didn’t see someone
breaking bottles or throwing
garbage’’’ Sutton said, ‘‘we’re
hard-put to write a summons for
littering.”

Both departments, wishing to
avoid conflict with the school,
say they hope the university will
take the necessary steps to
resolve the problem.

“I would hope we can come up
with some effective enforcement
mechanism by this fall,’ John
said.

He referred to the report by
the recent ad-hoc committee on
fraternities that suggests the
problem be dealt with by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

John said the SAC may con-
sider setting standards the
fraternities must adhere to. If
they fail to do so, he said social
probation may be used enforce
their compliance.

For the present the university
has adopted a ‘‘wait and see”’ at-
titude regarding the problem of
fraternity trash.

“We're now essentially in a
position of waiting to see if they
(the fraternities) choose to take
action,” Murphy said.

“The university hates to be in
a position to tell people what to
do,”’ he continued.

W&L law awards 105 juris doctor degrees

Former Dean Steinheimer speaks on professional conduct

Former Washington and Lee

Greystoke 1s

by CHARLIE ALCORN
Phi Columnist

Having been weaned on Tar-
zan movies, ogling stars like
Johnny Weismuller and Buster
Crabbe as they let out macho
screams of the wild, I felt Ihada
fairly thorough knowledge about
the Legend of the Jungle. Boy
was I wrong.

Greystoke, Lord of the Apes,
was based entirely on the liter-
ary classic,. Tarzan, by Edgar
Rice Burroughs. I had no idea
that Tarzan’s true identity was
that of a wealthy English lord. I

Flicks

thought all Tarzan’s were Olym-
pic swimming champions or at
least mindless body builders like
Miles O’Keefe (and his nude
sidekick, Bo Derek).

Greystoke, produced and
directed by Hugh Hudson, of
Chariots of Fire fame, has evolv-
ed from its serial roots to this
rendition that finally does jus-
tice to the classic novel. Filmed
in the spectacular settings of
The Republic of Cameroon and
Scotland, this film has the same
opulent feel to it that Chariots of
‘ire was recognized for. (Would
ne expect anything less from

e British? )

 

 

true Tarzan

The current Tarzan is master-
fully portrayed by newcomer
Christopher Lambert, whose
multi-faceted miming ability
results in an utterly believable
Lord of the Apes. His supporting
cast, which includes both the
rea) thing and actors dressed as
primates, were equally splendid
in every detail, recreating Tar-
zan’s jungle foster home.

Chariots alum Ian Holm gives
an outstanding performance as
the Belgian anthropologist who
befriends Greystoke and even-
tually returns him to his native
England. Andie McDowell is the
most beautiful and sophisticated
Jane ever to fall for the famed
ape-man. Miss McDowell’s and
Lambert’s bedroom scene has to
rank among the most original
seduction scenes in screen
history, with Tarzan bedding
proper Jane with that most
primal of pick-up lines, uggh,
uggh, urggh! (Go ahead and try
it. The worst she can do is ask for
a translation.)

So, my. advice to the W&L
moviegoer is to, by all means, go
see Greystoke, Lord of the Apes.
At the very least, you'll come out
knowing exactly who the guy is
who’s been swinging on the vines
for 40 years. More than likely,
you'll also come out with a
greater appreciation of your
ancestors. (Apologies go out to
all of you who are not practicing
Darwinist’s.) Happy viewing

 

 

this week and all summer long!

 

‘‘misunderstood and even un-
loved, even when they have
diligently and conscientiously
discharged their professional
obligations.”

Adding that the negative im-
age of lawyers ‘‘just naturally
goes with the territory of being a
lawyer,”’ Steinheimer said that
even though they may be mis-
understood and even unloved
‘“‘you can always command the
respect of others if you act as a
true professional should.”’

Steinheimer, who spent the
past semester teaching law at
the University of Alabama, cited
three specific areas of conduct
necessary for a lawyer to gain
such respect: dignity, decency

and honesty.
“By your manner, ap-
pearances, behavior and

language, you convey an impres-
sion of self-assurance and self-
respect which inspires con-
fidence but falls short of
aloofness,’ Steinheimer said.
‘Remember that the zealous
representation of a client’s
cause does not condone conduct
which is cruel, vindictive,
humiliating or demeaning.”

Honesty is the lawyer’s most
important trait, said Stein-
heimer, who urged the
graduates: ‘‘Resolve to be
honest at all events. Please
remember that the most impor-
tant asset you will have as a
lawyer throughout your profes-
sional career is your reputation
for honesty. No cause, no client
can be worth sacrificing your
reputation for honesty, which is
essential for your own feelings of
self-worth.”

Noting that he had not ex-
horted the graduates to remake
the world or even to try to
remake the legal profession,
Steinheimer said: “I ask only
that you take pride in your status
as a lawyer, though you will be
often misunderstood and un-
loved, and that you bring credit
to yourselves and to your profes-

The Year in W&L Sports

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

... Y'know, you can sit back
and take a review of the year in
W&L sports and be very nitpick-
ingly critical of an otherwise
quite successful year, but I don’t
want to do that. As with any
review and any reviewer, there
are countless ‘‘What if?”’ ’s sur-
rounding this year. In football:
What if the E&H game had come
later in the season? What if the
Hampden-Sydney game hadn’t
been on an off day? Soccer:
What if the final two minutes
against Radford had gone the
other way? Cross country: What
if the last 100 yards in Newport
News had been different?
Basketball: What if Fitz doesn’t
get hurt? What if Reggie
Thomas’ bomb doesn’t go in?
What if they don’t lose to Lynch-
burg in the first round of the
ODACs? Wrestling: What if
Easterns work out better?
Baseball: What if White is rested
for the ODAC championship
game? Track and field: What if
it doesn’t rain in Charlottesville?
Lacrosse: What if you take away
those three-, four-, five-goal
spurts that so many times doom-
ed the Generals’ efforts? Point
is, sure, there were holes, but,
much more than the holes there
were things that W&L athletes
should be proud of.

The football team wasn’t con-
tent to just play the game on
Saturday afternoons. They saw
fit to breaking records every

 

other week. Credit here goes not
only to those who get their
names in the book but also to
those behind the scenes and on
the sidelines. The soccer team

Time Out

was the best 8-5 squad in the na-
tion. Witness their five shutouts.
Tip of the hat to goalie Jay
Werner and departing senior
Roland Simon. Water polo had

another typical Page Remillard
year (25-12), as well as copping
their third straight Southern
League title. And cross country
had a fine season, finishing sec-
ond in the ODAC and watching
teammate Angus (A-A) Mc-
Bryde run three consecutive
brilliant races: He won ODAC
(set a course record), won
Regionals and took tenth (All-
American status) at Nationals.
The same holds true for the
winter’s teams. The General
grapplers had their best year
since ’73 and saw Jeff Dixon go

undefeated throughout the cam-
paign — the first time that’s ever
been done. The swimmers —
hard workers, indeed — only
sent six to nationals and brought

back a 15th place finish and, of

course, six All-Americans ~‘to
put W&L back on the swimming
map.” And basketball gave its
head man Verne Canfield his
17th winning season in 20 years
at W&L, while we watched two
class-act seniors, Messrs.
Baldwin and Graves, show us
how the game is played.

Ruggers finish at 4-2-1;
three could get All-State

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee
rugby club has concluded its
best season in some years and
has three players in the running
for selection to the Virginia
Select Side, an All-State team
that will compete in a national
tournament in New York in
August, according to club co-
captain Bill Jones.

The ruggers finished the
season with a 4-2-1 record, clos-
ing out the season by winning
two of its last three contests. The
Generals beat Virginia Tech and

ATTENTION SENIORS

the Chesapeake Bay Rugby
Football Club and lost to rival
VMI.

VMI defeated W&L, 16-12, but
the ruggers bounced back for a
win over the Hokie squad, 7-4.
Pacing the Generals over the
Tech club were George Borga,
who scored a try, and co-captain
Herb Funsten, who added a kick.

The ruggers finished the year
by defeating the Chesapeake
Bay team, a Baltimore-based
squad, 14-12. Leading the way
for W&L were Funsten, Jones,
Pete Pappasovos and Don
Wilkinson.

sidered for the Virginia Select
Side: Funsten, Jones and
sophomore Nick Berants. The
Select Side will represent
Virginia in a national tourna-
ment in Lake Saranac, N.Y., in
mid-August. The team is to be
named later this month.

With its best season in years,
the rugby club is looking to ex-
pand and gain more recognition,
said Jones.

“We're only losing three guys
off the team, and we’re going to
have a coach next year,”’ Jones
said, “‘so I think we’ll do really
well in the state overall.

“We’ve improved tremen-
dously since last spring,” he said
noting that a tournament sched-
uled for October featuring the
top teams in the state will be the
ruggers first proving ground.

Jones now thinks that some
recognition is to be expected. ‘‘I
think with guys being considered
for the state team and a chance
to be one of the top teams in the
State, I think we will get more
recognition from not only the
athletic department, but also
from the student body as a
whole.”’

Daly, assistants

to run summer

lacrosse camp

Washington and Lee lacrosse
coach Dennis Daly and his assis-
tant Sam Carpenter and Jeff
Long will head a staff of coaches
and present and former players
that will run a summer lacrosse
camp at W&L from July 8-13.

The camp will feature practice
sessions, face-off and goalie in-
struction, intra-ccamp competi-
tion and evening talks.

Enrollment is limited to 200
players, but Coach Daly said he
does not expect the camp to
reach capacity.

Aldridge showed us just how
much of a team game track can
be as his runners, jumpers and
throwers took not one, but two
ODAC team titles. The golfers
gave Buck Leslie another win-
ning season and sent Bruce
Blythe to nationals. The General
netters sent two singles players
and a doubles team to nationals

. again, said hello to a rising star,

Roby Mize, and said goodbye to
another classy individual, Craig
Cannon. Speaking of true cham-
pions, the baseball team turned
a SO-so year into an oh-wow year,
just falling short of their first
conference title in claiming their
best ODAC finish (2nd) ever.
And last but not least, let’s not
forget lacrosse, who despit-
what some kindly call a ‘‘tr’
tion year,” showed tHat i

take more of a man to lose
grace than to win.

In all, you look back and say,
rather enjoyed being a W&L far
in 1983-84.’ Why? ‘Well, you can
talk of wins and losses and
should’ve’s and what if’s, but
-when it comes right down to it, it
was simply a pleasure to be able
to watch suth fine athletes and
dedicated, quality human be-
ings.’....

....AS we run down the colon-
nade one last time for 1983-84, a
much-deserved round of ap-
plause for W&L’s_ honored
athletes at Tuesday’s sports
barbecue. In addition, a con-
gratulations to most valuable
senior athlete Tim Rock (top
grade in any book)... And
speaking of deserved honors, a
tip of the hat to Tim Schurr and
his selection to the South squad
for the North-South senior all-
star lacrosse game on June 9....

....$250,000. Was it worth it,
Portland Trail Blazers? It was
good to see new NBA commis-
sioner David Stern hand down
the fine and establish some
semblance of control on a situa-
tion (the hardshop rule, and the
contract game) that has become
progressively worse. If those in
college ignore their responsibili-
ty of keeping the contract game
legit, then maybe it’s time the
professionals start showing their
maturity...

....TO close, here are some
W&L thoughts for the powers
that be or to whom it may con-
cern: First, something not too
monumental but an operational
point that needs to be con-
sidered: Fix (hint: resurface)
the clay (term used loosely)
courts...Now! Second: For Mar-
ty Fletcher and other VMI hoops
people: Take Roanoke Times &
World-News columnist Doug
Doughty’s advice and schedule
the Generals next year. You’ve
already got three ODAC schools
on your schedule and a W&L-
VMI game might be your only
chance to ever fill Cameron
Hall. And finally, to the B of T
and Friday the 13th Date With
Destiny: W&L is a very special
place. Don’t change that....
By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

With the end of the school year
at hand, here is a quick look at
how fall sports at Washington
and Lee are shaping up for 1984.

Football

Head football coach Gary
Fallon enters his seventh season
at W&L with graduation leaving
several vacancies, namely, of-

fensive linemen and
linebackers.
Fallon, who has led the

Generals to four consecutive
winning seasons, including a 6-3
mark in 1983, said he has been
pleased with his team’s attitude
in the off-season and expects
several underclassmen to step in
and fill the openings along the of-
fensive line and at linebacker.

Fallon also said the incoming
freshman recruits for 1984 ‘‘look
good on paper, but I’ll reserve
my opinions until I see them on
the field.’’

Fallon cited several areas in
which the Generals should be
strong next season. W&L returns
its entire starting backfield and
receivers for the 1984 season.
Fallon also stated that the defen-
sive secondary and line will
feature, for the most part, ex-
perienced players who proved
themselves during the 1983
season.

W&L opens its season against
Dickinson College, a newcomer
to the Generals’ schedule, on
Sept. 8 at home. W&L will play 10
games in 1984 (six at home), as
opposed to nine in 1983.

Seniors Gene Girard, Pat
O’Connell and Tom Wiser will
serve as captains for the 1984
team.

Soccer

Head soccer coach Rolf Piran-
ian enters his ninth season at
W&L with a solid nucleus re-
maining from the 1983 squad to
build on in 1984.

W&L lost only two seniors
from last year’s 8-5 team,
leading Piranian to assess his
team’s prospects for 1984 op-
timistically.

“We're returning so many
solid upperclassmen that we
have to be pretty high going into

next season,’’ Piranian said.

Piranian also said that several
players who played on the junior
varsity last year have greatly
improved and should contribute
in 1984.

Co-captains for the 1984 season
are senior Rob Coleman and
junior Billy Holmes.

The Generals travel to Atlan-
ta, Ga., to participate in the
Emory University Tournament
on Sept. 15 and 16.

Water Polo

Water polo coach Page
Remillard sees 1984 as a ‘‘re-

building year’ for the Generals,
but he believes that a strong
recruiting year combined with
the returning upperclassmen
will keep W&L at the level it has
become accustomed to.
Remillard, who owns a 119-47
record in his five years at W&L,
including three consecutive
Southern Conference champion-
ships, said that the loss of our
Starters (two All-Americans)
from the 1983 team will be
“tough to replace. Early in the
season, I expect that we will take
our lumps. By the end of the
season, I expect us to maintain
the W&L tradition of pulling off

Senior Bobby Pearson and

for the 1984 team.

“I believe that 1984 will be a
building year, but we’ve been
able to win the conference in the
past during building years,’
Remillard said.

Miller, in his 33rd season at

W&L, said W&L has the ‘‘poten-

many things can happen to you.”

of freshman runners appears to
be a talented one, but that he
would be able to ‘‘evaluate them
better at the end of next season.”

Tennis year ‘better than anticipated’

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The 1984 Washington and Lee
tennis team finished their season
with a 13-8 overall record (3-0 in
ODAC Competition), a second-
place finish at the conference
championships, and with two
players who qualified for the
NCAA Division III National
Championships.

“The season was better than I
had anticipated and above our
expectations,” said head tennis
coach Gary Franke. Franke

stated that the team’s constant

improvement through the
season contributed greatly to its
success.

Despite the spring term
absence of their no. 3 singles
player Andy Haring, who was
studying in England, the Gen-
erals defeated several Division I
and II teams, including an upset
over a tough Division I George
Washington team. +

Although the Generals had an
impressive season, their perfor-
mance was not flawless. In their

attempt to retain their 1983
championship title, the Generals
placed second at the ODAC
championships.

Franke said, ‘‘The ODACs
were a little of a disappoint-
ment.’’ Franke believes that the
team’s ODAC tournament per-
formance marks the only perfor-
mance this season in which the
Generals did not play up to their
expectations. He added, how-
ever, that the champion, Lynch-
burg, may simply be a better
team.

Although they were unable to
defend their ODAC title, the
Generals posted very im-
pressive statistics in ODAC play.
In addition to a 3-4 record, W&L
won 21 of the 23 matches played
against its ODAC opponents dur-
ing the regular season.

Senior Craig Cannon (captain)
and freshman Roby Mize quali-
fied to participate in singles and
doubles competition at the
NCAA Division III National
Championships at Emory Uni-
versity in Atlanta, Ga. Cannon
(14-7 in ’84) entered the tourna-
ment ranked 23rd in the nation
among Division III players.
Mize (14-9) entered ranked 35th;
the doubles team of Cannon-
Mize (13-7) was 24th.

Cannon suffered a first round
loss in singles competition. Dean
Packard of Wittenberg defeated
Cannon 6-1, 6-4. Franke believes
that Craig was a little tight and
meted that Packard was playing
well. Packard upset the no. 3
seed of the tournament in the
second round.

Mize obtained a first round
victory, but was stopped in the

second round. Mize defeated
David Ulrich of SUNY-Albany
6-4, 6-3, but Duke Paluett of
Gustavus Adolphus (the no. 2
team in Division III) stopped
Mize, 6-1, 6-4, in the next round.

“Roby played well, but was
unable to take him (Paluett), a
very good player, out of his
groove,’’ said Franke.

The luck of the draw went
against Cannon and Mize in
doubles competition as they
faced the no. 7 seed team of Tim
Corwin and Alex Palledino from
Kalamazoo in the first round.
Cannon and Mize played a tough
match against Corwin and Pal-
ladino before losing 6-4, 6-4. Cor-
win and Palladino reached the
quarterfinals of the tournament.

Coach Franke would have
liked to have seen Cannon obtain
All-American honors _ this
season. He believes that Cannon
had the potential to be an All-
American and that he played
well enough during the regular
season, but that Cannon did not
play well enough at the national
tournament to achieve All-
American status.

Cannon, who will graduate this
year, did receive the tennis
team’s MVP award. Jim Irwin
and Charles Kalocsay will also
graduate this year. Coach
Franke appreciates the ability
and leadership that the seniors
have contributed to the tennis
program during their career at
W&L.

The members of the 1984 varsi-
ty team who will return next
year are Roby Mize, Andy Har-
ing, Scott Adams, Randy Johns
and John Meloy.

Grand jury indictments

(continued from page 1)

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John said that drug awareness
programs have been instituted
in physical education classes,
and that next fall’s freshman
orientation will include a presen-
tation on drugs.

In addition, a task force on
substance abuse was formed in
January as an ad hoc committee
of the Student Health Commit-
tee. It grew to include 20
members, including students,
administrators and others. It
recently issued a statement on
alcohol abuse.

Dean John said the committee
was formed partly as a result of
the grand jury, and partly in
response to the conviction last
fall of three former W&L
students on drug charges, in-
cluding possession and distribu-
tion of marijuana or cocaine.

‘““You have to look at the whole
range of drugs,’’ Dean John
said. ‘‘The most widely used and
abused substance here is
alcohol.”

He said the investigation has
had an effect on campus. “I
think it has probably cut down on
the use,” he said. “From
students I’ve. talked to, it has
either reducéd the level of usage
or driven it further under-
ground.”

‘Although the enforcement of
law is not within the educational
function of the University, no
one should delude himself that
the campus is a sanctuary from
law-enforcement agents,’’ the
University Policy Statement on
Drugs says.

‘‘Law-enforcement agents
have jurisdiction on campus
and, when possessing proper
documents, may legally make
arrests or search any room or

building without prior notice to

University officials.”’

Cases concerning alleged drug
misuse are referred to the Stu-
dent Control Committee.

VMI said in a statement that it
“has a clear and rigorously en-
forced policy on drug abuse: the
use is not tolerated; the penalty
is dismissal.”

Col. William J. Buchanan,
director of admissions, said the
school attempts to check any in-
formation it receives concerning
drug abuse by a potential cadet,
and that ‘‘any conviction beyond
a misdemeanor makes them in-
eligible for commissioning [as a
military officer], and that
makes them ineligible for us.”’

He said that the son of an
alumn wasrecently denied ad-
mission because of a drug-

related conviction.

Capt. Harold A. Willcockson,
deputy commandant of cadets,
said that ‘‘it’s against the rules
to use drugs here. Our purpose is

The special grand jury said in
its conclusions that ‘‘the local
public school administrations
should be urged to implement
within their curricula strong and
meaningful drug abuse clases,
commencing with Grade 4 and
continuing through high
school...”

“It is quite evident, based
upon the testimony of many, that
the majority of college students
who are ‘heavy users’ started
their drug connections in the

tion would affect them.

“T’ve prepared some leading
questions which will suggest and
stimulate conversation on the in-
tangibles,’’ he said. ‘‘I've chosen
some of the things which are us-
ed by those most opposed to
coeducation for Washington and
Lee to test what they say against
our own judgments.”

As examples, he cited ‘‘We
will lose our distinctiveness’’
and ‘‘We’ll become just like all
the other coed schools in
America.”’

Wilson said the Academic Af-
fairs Committee, headed by
Edgar F.. Shannon Jr. of Charlot-
tesville, will take up ‘“‘the ques-
tion of what the University’s

 

report stated.

The jury said it hoped the com-
munity would form a citizens’
committee to implement pro-
grams to educate the public on
the dangers of narcotics abuse.
It said that guidelines from pro-
grams of’ other communities
were included with the report.
The guidelines were not releas-
ed.

Honts said in the statement
that it was his understanding
that Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read plans to:
coordinate his activity with
regard to indictments with
former U.S. Attorney Leigh B.

pointed in April to assist the
panel as a special counsel.

academic prospects are — how
good the classes are, what the
admissions picture is, how im-
portant it is that we maintain our
all-male character, and what the
impact in the classroom would
be of an increase in the size of
the student body.”’

The Budget and Audit Com-
mittee, headed by Jerry G.
South of San Francisco, will look
at three sets of enrollment pro-
jections, and will study the
capital costs involved in a possi-
ble move to coeducation.

One model shows, over an 11-
year period, an undergraduate
student body of 1,000 if W&L
remained all-male, a decline of
350 from the current level.

that it needs to be, but it’s a

reasons for that which I am not
at liberty to discuss.”

Hanes said he ended up ex-
amining more than one witness
on the matter in question. He
said Monday that he had not yet
seen a copy of the jury’s report,
which was submitted to Honts on
May 10.

W&L law professor J. Timothy
Philipps is a member of the local
bar association committee
which is seeking comments and
complaints from citizens on ‘‘the
orderly administration of justice
in Rockbridge County,” in-
cluding the special grand jury.

‘“‘We thought we’d hear from a
lot of people and we just didn’t,
so we decided to take some in-
itiative,”’ he said. ‘‘We waited
for a long time and we got

nothing by just waiting for
volunteers.’’

Philipps said that a_ letter
soliciting comments was sent
Wednesday to local lawyers, law
enforcement agents and school
administrators. He said the let-
ter was also sent to the incoming
and outgoing presidents of the
Student Bar Association.

“The law school donated the
typing and preparation of the let-
ter,” he said, adding that the bar
association paid for the postage.

“lve gotten very little
material from people,” Philipps
said. He said he received com-
plaints from two W&L student:
involving ‘‘peripheral problems
with the police.”’

“They felt the police were do-
ing their job, but a little more
zealously than need be,”’ he said.

 

possibility we have to con-
template if we keep our quality
standards high,”’ Wilson said.
The other two models which
are being studied show a com-
bination of 1325 or 1500 men and

women undergraduates.
The Campus Life Committee,

chaired by H. Gordon Leggett
Jr. of Lynchburg, will study the
effects of coeducation on the
athletic program, residence hall
life, the fraternity system and
social life in general.

The Planning and Develop-
ment Committee, chaired by
S.L. Kopland Jr. of Memphis,

recent six-page questionnaire
exploring attitudes toward the
University and toward the
possibility of coeducation which

assistant national news editor
Jack Kelley, but the story was

killed later in the day.

All three local network af-
filiates, WSET in Lynchburg
and WSLS and WDBJ in Roa-
noke, were notified by students
and dispatched reporters and
cameramen to Wilson’s office.

The amount of coverage of the
event prompted some to criticize
its purpose.

“The thing that ticks me is
that they called a_ reporter
first,’ associate professor of
journalism Robert J. de Maria
said. ‘By going to a professional

reporter, that made me question
their real purpose.”

“They were making a scene
for the media and for the Board
of Trustees,” he continued.
“They accomplished nothing.
They were calling attention to
themselves, not the issue... .
They were protesting, but did
that protest really accomplish
anything in the eyes of the
public?”’

Junior Gib Kerr, one of the
leaders of the group, defended
the sit-in. ‘‘We’re not radicals,”
he said. ‘‘We didn’t do this out of
disrespect. We didn’t mean any
disrespect for President Wilson
or his office. We just wish they'd
pay more attention to our opin-
ion.

‘‘We just thought this would be
the most effective way to get our
opinion across to the trustees.”’

Wilson said he was ‘‘incredu-
lous” when notified Wednesday
night of the possibility of a sit-in.

“I didn’t think that was the
W&L style,’’ Wilson said last
night. “If the students had come
in to talk, it seems that would
have been more the W&L style.
But I couldn’t see them calling

the media and then asking other
students to join them in
something like that. For those
reasons, I thought it had all the
earmarks of being rather ar-
tificial.”’

Wilson was attending the
Board of Trustees meetings all
day and was never in his office
during the sit-in.

Betty Brewbaker, Wilson’s
secretary arrived at 8:20 to find
the students in Wilson’s office.
Allen Cohen of WSET met her as
she walked up the stairs, she
said.

When she first saw the
students, Mrs. Brewbaker said,
she felt ‘‘shame and indignation
that they would be in (Wilson’s)
office, sitting in his chairs. Once
the initial shock was over, I just

. went along with it.”’

Mrs. Brewbaker said the
students obviously had con-
tacted the media. ‘‘They came
prepared to meet the media,”’
she added. ‘‘I really don’t know
what they hoped to accomplish
in the process.”’

“I told them they’ll have ever
somuch more fun at Goshen.”

was Sent to 16,500 alumni.

Wilson said that nearly 6,700
alumns_ returned the forms,
which were tabulated and
analyzed by a _ Richmond
marketing firm.

The president said he is uncer-
tain how much of the material
from the survey will be released.
“In some form it would want to
be shared,’’ he said. ‘I don’t
know what form that will take.”’

The Board’s Nominating and
Investment committees did not
undertake separate studies of
coeducation.

The Executive Committee of
the Student Body last night
hosted a dinner for the trustees,
at which several members of the
committee spoke on their ‘‘Per-
ceptions of Washington and
Lee.”

“It seemed like the most
expedient, courteous and effec-
tive way of maintaining open
lines of communication between
the student body and _ the
trustees,’’ EC President Robert
C. Jenevein said.

“T think it’s a good idea every
year, but it was initiated this
year because of all the hot issues
and the need to maintain those
open lines of communication.”’

Other items on the Board’s
agenda include final approval of
the University pavilion, which is
expected to be completed by
next fall, and the inauguration of
trustee Thomas K. Wolfe Jr. of
New York, who was unable to at-
tend the February meeting.

One matter the trustees will
not have to deal with is the fiscal
dispute between the Executive
Committee and the Student Bar
Association, which had said it
might present the issue to the
trustees.

An agreement was reached
between the SBA, represented
by a group headed by Chairman-
elect John J. Sicilian, and
representatives of next year’s
EC headed by Cole Dawson.

‘It’s all going to be worked out
by next fall,’’ Dawson said at
Monday’s EC meeting. ‘‘So the
trustees won’t be involved at
all.”
