College presidents give W&L top ranking

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

A “‘U.S. News and World Report”’ survey
of college presidents placed Washington
and Lee as the most frequently cited

‘“‘smaller comprehensive university” east

of the Mississippi.

The survey of 662 college and university
presidents, published as the cover story in
the Nov. 28, 1983, issue, noted that
Washington and Lee distinguished itself by
its small size, scholarly atmosphere -and
wide range of course offerings.

In the survey, education editor Lucia
Solorzano and staff writer Barbara Quick

used classifications of institutions of
higher learning developed by the Carnegie
Council on Public studies in Higher Educa-
tion in sending out nine separate surveys
to 1,308 four-year college presidents. Each
president received a survey with a list of
schools in the same classification as
his/her respective college, and, where ap-
plicable, in the same geographic region.
W&L was named as one of the top tive
smaller comprehensive universities in the
country by 47.6 percent of the presidents, far
ahead of the second-place school east of the
Mississippi, Lafayette College (Pa.), which
received 28.6 percent of the votes.
“Presidents of national universities

were given lists of national universities
and were told to choose the top five.’’ Ms.
Quick said during an interview this week.

“Presidents of regional liberal arts col-
leges east of the Mississippi were given
lists of similar liberal arts colleges east of
the Mississippi and were told to choose the
best five colleges in that list or to add to
that list in a blank at the end of the
survey,’ she said.

Ms. Quick said some college presidents
were offended by the idea of rating them-
selves, but she noted that most responses
showed the presidents ‘‘tooting their own
horns.”’

keen adherence to a liberal-arts cur-
riculum while offering a wide range of pro-
fessional programs such as journalism
and business administration.

‘We found Washington and Lee was,
“* ‘a very strong place — at once scholarly
and collegial.’ as we quoted one man,”’
said Ms. Quick in reference to a quote in
the story by Harvard professor-emeritus
David Riesman.

Ms. Quick said the diverse responses
they received seemed to point to one con-
clusion — there is a school out there for
every prospective college student.

Open exam plans

postponed until winter

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Time has run out on the open
exam policy — for this semes-
ter, at least.

The policy may still be ap-
proved in time for winter
semester exams, though, ac-
cording to Cole Dawson, junior
representative to the Executive
Committee, who headed up a
subcommittee to investigate
open exams.

Dawson reported at the EC’s
regular meeting Monday night
that he had not had time to draw
up a detailed proposal — one
that he said was warranted
—for Monday afternoon’s
meeting of the faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee.

In order for the open exam
policy to have been approved in
time for this semester’s exams,
the faculty EC would have had
to make a recommendation this
week in time for the entire
faculty to make a final decision
during the regular faculty
meeting Monday afternoon.

“There’s a lot of detail that
we really have to define,”’
Dawson said. ‘‘We have to work
out the logistics of each depart-

ment and exactly which secre-
taries will be on duty “‘

The open exam policy would
provide for students to sign up
only for a particular exam time,
rather than both time and date,
as is done now.

A student could then take the
exam any day during the exam
week at that time — either 9
a.m. or2 p.m.

Scott Mason, junior represen-
tative to the EC last year, had
initiated the investigation but
met with opposition from the
Commerce School. Mason, who
did not run for re-election,
reported to the EC on his find-
ing earlier this year.

“This really is an important
aspect of the future of - the
school, the honor system and
the exam policy,’’ Dawson said.

However, he said he had
wanted to be able to present the
faculty EC with a comprehen-
sive proposal.

“The faculty EC’s vote will
probably carry some weight
with the faculty. I have been
talking to several professors,
and if we can draft a good pro-
posal, they feel that we’ll be
able to get it through for next
semester,’’ he said.

83% against

plus/minus

for upper
classmen

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

An overwhelming majority of
students voting in yesterday’s
poll cast ballots against the
plus-minus system’s affecting
upperclassmen.

Of the 458 sophomores, jun-
iors and seniors who voted in
the poll, 379, 83 percent, voted
against the new grading system
affecting upperclassmen, 57, 12
percent, supported that system,
and 22, 5 percent, said they
were indifferent or undecided.

The plus-minus grading sys-
tem, which would enable pro-
fessors to grade students on a
scale that would add .33 grade
points to a grade for a plus and
subtract .33 for a minus, was
approved by the faculty in May
1982.

The faculty decided last year
that the system would affect up-
perclassmen as well as entering
freshmen.

The faculty committee on
courses and degrees voted
Tuesday not to recommend to
the entire faculty that the plus-

1eWw and Outlook
Not too late

While the referendum movement against the new
plus and minus grading system is a worthwhile one, it
has been said that it has come too late. When the
faculty voted to adopt the system in the spring of 1982,
the change was reported but little else was mentioned
of it. Not until this fall, when students realized that
they would be affected by the change, has concern
arisen about the system, which, some argue, is being
applied unfairly to the upper three undergraduate
classes which did not enter the university under such
a rule. As with other changes in the academic realm
such as the increased credit requirement, this new
policy should only affect the freshmen who will be
graded by it for four complete years.

Wednesday’s referendum, which showed that 83
percent of those who voted did not favor the imposi-
tion of the new grade scale on the upper three classes,
was a special opportunity for the students to voice
their opinions on the issues. It was a rare chance for
the faculty and the administration to discover the stu-
dent sentiment on a subject over which the students
have no control but are greatly affected. The Ex-
ecutive Committee is to be thanked for providing such
an opportunity.

Four hundred and fifty-eight of the sophomores,
juniors and seniors voted in Wednesday’s referen-
dum. That is roughly half of their number. At a school
which has become marked by its apathy and which
usually turns out at the polls in numbers closer to 20
or 30 percent, the high voter turn-out is significant. It
proves simply that this is an issue of great impor-
tance to the students who will be affected by it. And
for 83 percent of those students to vote against the
move is a fairly clear indication of where the stu-
dent’s opinions fall.

The faculty will meet Monday to decide whether
this new grade system will indeed be applied this fall.
Although the movement against the referendum
comes at the very last minute, a substantial impact
can still be made.

If students seek out their faculty advisers and their
professors, they can have their voices heard in Mon-
day’s meeting. This could further their involvement
ina matter which is otherwise out of their hands.

Although it could be too late to make an impact, it is ©

nevertheless vital that the students have their voices

‘Losing with class’

To the Editors:

During the weekend of
November 19 and 20, I attended
the games of the Washington
and Lee Tip-off Basketball
Tournament. A relatively inex-
perienced Washington and Lee
team lost two close games, and
thus Saturday night’s cham-
pionship game did not include
the Generals. The sparse crowd

at the championship only made
more conspicuous the absence
of the Washington and Lee
coach and players, presumably
the tournament hosts. After the

game, trophies were presented
to the first, second, and third
place teams, and to members of
the all-tournament' team.
Again, no members of our team

were there to congratulate the
winners. I believe this to have
been an embarrassment to
Washington and Lee.

Ina period of many suggested
changes for our institution and
much talk of tradition, let’s not
abandon the tradition of win-
ning — and losing — with class.

Bumper sticker is reactionary

To the Editors:

Recently -I saw a bumper
sticker avowing the predictable
sentiment ‘‘Better dead than
Co-ed.”” The slogan continued
and urged one to ‘‘preserve the
W&L tradition.”

I had alwavs believed that the
“W&L’ tradition’ was of
greater substance than the
mere issue of single-sex educa-
tion.

I had believed that W&L’s
traditions were rationality, in-
telligence and informed judg-
ments: all hallmarks of a fine
liberal arts education.

The reactionary sentiments
reflected by that bumper
sticker connote bigotry and
egoism, and many students in-
sinuate, through buzz words
and association with the univer-
sity, an unimpeachable authori-
ty to speak preemptively.

The coeducational issue will
be decided upon not by the stu-
dent or the alumni, but by
President Wilson and the board
of trustees. It will be resolved
not on the basis of emotions,
preference or sentiment, but
upon clear rational thought.

Academic, not social

To the Editors:

It has come to my attention
that a problem is arising con-
cerning the noise in the Univer-
sity Library. The issue was
originally raised by the Library
Advisory Committee, but I am
writing this letter from my own
experience. Studying in a dorm
room or fraternity house is
close to impossible if you have
serious work to do. The library
is the only place where many
people, myself included, can
study in peace. So if there are
too many distractions to work
even there, those of us who use
it as our sole place of study are

out of luck.

One of the biggest problems
with noise arises when groups
of friends sit together at tables
or adjoining carrels; especially
when a group of fraternity
members gather to study. This
is fine if they do so in a side
room. But when they gather in
the open part of the library they
can cause a great disturbance.
Don’t kid yourself. If you really
want to get something accom-
plished, study by yourself. This
is what carrels are meant for.
Then you can go elsewhere and

Perhaps those who are spur-
red by emotion and “‘tradition’’

in the issue of coeducation
should take heed and refrain
from speaking to the issue until
they can do so in an informed
and intelligent manner, in the

true Washington and Lee tradi-
tion.

No clear advantages in semester system
Students should fight for this one

By Scott Mason

It’s as if John Wilson has lac-
ed up his boxing gloves and
stepped into the ring. He’s hurl-
ed blows at issues involving
fraternities and single-sex
education, and students, buckl-
ing under the force of his
onslaught, fear W&L’s future
may be on the ropes.

Wilson’s most recent target is
W&L’s six-week spring semes-
ter. Upon recommendation
from the committee on courses
and degrees, Wilson appointed
eight professors to determine if
the spring semester should be
dropped from the school’s
undergraduate calendar.

Professors have complained
that the six-week semester isn’t
enough time in which to teach
an entire course. The material
has to be crammed in, and
because teachers are rushed for
time, much of it isn’t gone over
as thoroughly as it should.

Besides that, most faculty see
spring term as a joke, a Six-
week vacation for students to
enjoy afternoons at Goshen and
late-night fraternity parties.
They see the course load as be-
ing too low and spring fever as
being too high.

Reader’s
Advocate

 

 

The six-week spring semester
follows a 12-week fall and 12-
week winter semester. The
newly-formed calendar com-
mittee is thinking about
dividing the 30-week school
year into two 15-week semes-
ters. That would get rid of the
six-week ‘‘vacation.”’

The committee is keeping its
options open. It has some viable
alternatives. The two 15-week

Who has the right?

Communism is a dirty word
in the United States. In recent
decades, we have even seen fit
to commit our men and re-
sources to resist the spread of
communism. For this, the com-
munists we oppose have called
us imperialists. Are they right?
Imperialism is generally defin-
ed as the practice or policy of
forming and maintaining an
empire by the conquest and/or
colonization of other lands. With
this as a working definition,
let’s draw a few comparisons.

My View

 

 

Why did countries have col-
onies? The various reasons can
be grouped in three categories.
The first used to be called the
‘‘white man’s burden.’’
Westerners saw those they col-
onized as morally inferior and
took upon themselves the task

of “enlightening” the natives.
' The second is mercantilism, the

use of colonies as sources of raw
materials and as markets for
finished goods. The third is
geopolitics, the hunger for more
absolute power and greater
strength in international strug-
gles.

Now then, let’s examine our
own foreign policy in terms of
the goals of colonialism. First of
all, we have postured ourselves
as the world’s moral leader, in-
sisting that the American
system should be the world’s
system. In countries such as

China and Vietnam, we have
supported leaders unpopular
among their own people but
loyal to the United States. We’re
doing that even now, most
notably in Central America.
Part of our concern with hostile
takeovers is a concern for loss
of strategic materials such as
petroleum, bauxite, rubber, as
well as for American business
interests whose markets in the
revolutionized nations would
disappear. Therein lies our
mercantilist motivation. Our
desire for military bases
abroad and our deployment of
missiles on foreign soil should

make our geopolitical motiva-
tions obvious. Although there
are differences, our foreign
policy does come disturbingly

. Close to the colonialist model.

International communism is a
threat to our ‘colonialist’

goals, and therefore we combat
it. That is, we oppose com-
munism because it opposes our
empire-building, not because
we have moral difficulties with
communism.

That makes U.S. foreign
policy seem awfully petty, and
many will fight the conclusion
Americans would like to think
that we oppose communism
because it runs counter to the
freedoms we cherish. Yet we
have supported unrepresen-
tative monarchies in Saudi
Arabia and Iran, military
governments such as that in
Guatemala, brutal dictator-
ships in nations like the Philip-
pines, state religion in Israel,
and racist governments like

semester system however isn’t
one of them.

Under this system, students
would be required to take at
least 15 credits per semester in-
stead of 12. The added course
would presumably mean added
work and an extra burden on
students to study.

Competition among students
is often intense. The com-
petitive student places a heavy
emphasis on class standing. It’s.
important that he make good
grades, but it’s essential that
his grades are better than the
next guy’s.

The heavier course load

under a two 15-week semester
system would seemingly make
it harder to get good grades in
all subjects. Students would
now have to put studying time
into a fifth course which before
they didn’t have to worry about.

Because grades are so impor-
tant to the competitive student,
he must somehow alleviate this
extra burden so that his

Communism vs. Colonialism

South Africa. Morality was
never an issue in our dealings
with those countries, yet we
have tried to characterize our
dealings with communists as
moral struggles.

So far this has been an article
with apparent leanings but no
real conclusion. In considering
the information and com-
parisons, what can be conclud-
ed? Perhaps that our nation’s
leaders have been misleading

the public as to the true motiva-
tions behind our foreign policy.
Perhaps they’ve been mis-
leading themselves. Whatever
the case, the lesson to be learn-
ed is that in order to have a con-
sistent and reasonable foreign
policy, we must be a little more
honest with ourselves. If we
want morality to be a foreign
policy issue, let’s demand that
morality equally from our
friends and our foes. If we wish
to maintain the status quo, then
we must stop characterizing
our clashes as moral struggles
and call them what they are:
simple struggles between op-
ponents, characterized not by
great moral questions but by
self-interest. Either way, a
more honest presentation of our
foreign policy aims will
stimulate more _ productive
discussion of our foreign policy
by our policy-makers and by the
public.

At a time when American
resources and American
soldiers are such active agents
of our foriegn policy, we need to
be a little more honest with
ourselves about what we’re do-
ing and why we're doing it.

chances of making all As are as ©

high as they were before the
fifth course was added.
Therefore, he may enroll in
“‘gut’’ courses where an A can
be gotten easily.

Gut courses don’t require a
lot of “‘intellectual stimula-
tion.’”’ The competitive student
is generally more apt to go for
the easy A.

The added work under the two

15-week semester system is
likely to drive students to gut
courses. Consequently, they
won’t be getting as much out of
their education. They’ll be
sacrificing good courses for
easy courses, intellectual
stimulation for an A earned
without having to think. When
that happens, it’s unfortunate
for students but also unfor-
tunate for the school which fails
in its responsibility of properly
educating those students.
Another drawback to the two
15-week semester system is that
it doesn’t provide for off-

campus studies. Internships
can be extremely valuable.
They give students a chance to
gain working experience in the
“real” world. The current six-

week semester is ideally suited
for that purpose.

Whether or not President
Wilson and the calendar com-
mittee decide to adopt the two
15-week semester system in
place of the six-week spring
semester, it’s a sure bet that
students will voice their opin-
ions loudly. They’ve suffered
unexpected blows by what they
see as attacks upon the fraterni-
ty system and single-sex educa-
tion. Now, the school calendar
is under siege. It’s time to fight
back. Another round has begun.

Letter writers charge
Admissions Office

To the Editors:

The question at the heart of
the coeducation issue is the
following: Given projections of
a 22 percent decline in its pool of
applicants, can Washington and
Lee continue to attract a suffi-
cient number of high quality
students while remaining all-
male? Thus far, opponents of
coeducation have, to the extent
possible, tried to avoid this
question. We, therefore, take
this opportunity to respond
directly to the question of
whether W&L can survive with-
out coeducation.

After a detailed examination
of admissions statistics compil-
ed on the fifteen most recent
freshman classes, including the

numbers of applicants, the
numbers of students admitted,
and the numbers of students
enrolled, and of the responses to
questionnaires sent to all
students who are admitted, we
must answer this question with
a definite yes.

Consider, first, the admis-
sions picture in 1976, the last
time the Board of Trustees con-
sidered coeducation. The
number of applications had
dropped to around 1,300 from
slightly more than 1,400 in 1966.
While this figure was not static,
the yearly dips and rises had
tended to be small and to offset
each other. The Board conclud-
ed, wisely, that the number of

really enjoy yourself without
feeling guilty. If you can’t study
by yourself or you study better
with someone find a side room
where you can close the door
and study without disturbing
others. I realize that everyone
needs a break now and then just
to talk; but even this can be
done quietly, just whisper.

Another problem arises in
that underclassmen seem to be
afraid to ask upperclassmen to
be quiet. Everyone has the right
to use the library regardless of
class. It is the upperclassmen’s
responsibility to honor this
right. Last year all you had to
do was snap your fingers and
people would quiet down. There
is no reason why this cannot
continue.

This noise problem is really
serious. With exams coming up

people will start getting really
uptight, and a great many of
them will flock to the library.
This could be hell unless we are
all courteous and respectful of
others’ rights like the
gentlemen that we are supposed
to be. The administration is
really serious about this. There
has been talk about closing the
library at night. It has even
been suggested that monitors
be placed in the library. Come
on guys, we already have a
great deal of freedom in the
library. How many other
libraries do you know of that let .
you sleep in them and put your
feet up on the desks? Let’s not
jeopardize this freedom. We
simply need to be responsible
and monitor ourselves.

The Executive Committee
formed a subcommittee Mon-
day night to explore the
possibility of upperclassmen
serving as registration ad-
visers.

Citing a general student opin-
ion that some faculty advisers
do not offer much help in choos-
ing particular courses, senior
representative Jim Messer
said, ‘“‘but someone who could
devote a little more time during
registration.

“It might run into problems
with the faculty, though.”’

The EC discussed the possi-
bility of students in particular
majors helping other students
interested in taking a course in
that major.

Also discussed was the
possibility of compiling course
critiques to which students
could refer when selecting
courses.

EC examines adviser system

Such a system already exists
at the law school, where each
student critiques his courses,
and the critiques are compiled
and bound in a publication
available to all law students.

“Some times a very good pro-
fessor might have lousy
students who give him a lousy
critique,’’ upperclass law
representative Jim Green said.

“I think the faculty might be
kind of sensitive to it.’’

Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers, sophomore
representatives Ken Lindeman
and James White and senior
representative George
Youmans were appointed to
serve with Messer on the sub-
committee.

In other action Monday night,
the EC decided to recommend
to the faculty Executive Com-
mittee that all classes be
dismissed Friday, May 11, the
first day of the 1984 Washington

 

and Lee Mock Democratic Con-
vention.

Steve Lewis, co-chairman of
the Mock Convention, requested
the action because the Mock
Convention parade will be held
at 10 that morning and the first
session will begin at 1 p.m. He
said classes on that day were
dismissed for the 1980 Mock
Convention. A final decision
must be made by the faculty.

Lewis also said that 25 states
have now raised money for the
Mock Convention. ‘‘I’m reason-
ably optimistic (regarding fund
raising),”’ he added.

The EC also relieved itself of
any immediate responsibility in
dealing with the Independent
Union. After a meeting among
the EC’s committee on in-
dependents, the Independent
Union and the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the organiza-
tions decided that the Indepen-
dent Union would work with the
SAB and would come to the EC
only if problems arose.

Classes will meet
on Saturday

first week back

Washington and Lee students
who stay out too long on New
Year’s Eve this year and don’t
make it back to school until
Tuesday will be relieved to
learn that they will not have
missed classes that Monday.
But, in turn, they will be obliged
to attend classes the next Satur-
day morning to make up for the
lack of Monday classes.

Because Jan. 1 falls on a Sun-
day this year, classes were
pushed back one day in the first
week of Winter term to allow
students an extra day after the
first of January to get back to
school.

“We never make students
come back on the first,’’ said
Edward C. Atwood, dean of the
Commerce School and chair-
man of the Faculty Executive
Committee.

Atwood said that since the
12-124 school calendar was
adopted in 1970, it has been
necessary to schedule Saturday
classes whenever the first falls
on a Sunday, about every six
years. He said the move was
necessary to get in 12 complete
weeks of classes: before the
Winter exam period.

He explained that the daily
class schedule would be thrown
off one day during that week
and that the Saturday classes
will actually be classes schedul-
ed for Friday.

“On Fridays there are really
no afternoon classes,’’ said At-
wood, ‘‘so we are really only
talking about Saturday morn-
ing.”’

Atwood also said that the first
week of Winter term for the
1984-85 academic year has been
pushed back one week and will
begin Jan. 9.

Sentencing dates set

for convicted students

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

After taking three months to
examine the details of each
case, a Rockbridge County Cir-
cuit Court judge has set the
sentencing dates for two
suspended Washington and Lee
students and one former stu-
dent.

Rohrig, a former W&L senior
who was suspended for three
years, will be sentenced Dec. 12
for his conviction in September
of selling marijuana and
possession of marijuana with
intent to distribute.

William L. Dederick, who has
been suspended from the uni-
versity for one year, will also be
sentenced Dec. 12 for his
September conviction of selling
cocaine, possession of cocaine
_ with intent to distribute and
possession of marijuana seeds
and plants with intent to grow
the drug.

A third man, Marc Ham, a
‘ former W&L student who with-
drew from the university after
his September conviction for
possession and sale of cocaine,

The right to a jury that is

New theatre plans studied

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has “made some pre-
liminary studies’ into the
possibility of constructing a
new theatre on the parking lot
east of the U.S. 60 overpass, ac-
cording to executive assistant
to the president Frank Parsons.
Parsons is quick to point out,
however, that these are only
preliminary studies and that
there is currently no source of
funds for the project.

cleared the project with both
William Watt, Dean of the Col-
lege, and Lewis John, Dean of
Students, and that Dederick will
receive no W&L credits for his
work. ;

Dederick has been suspend
for one year by the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

“Because of the sensitivity of
the issue,’ McDaniel said, ‘“‘I
cleared his being on campus
and in my office using the
library and research facilities.

“This is not something that
W&L has supported institu-
tionally. His status as far as
W&L is concerned has not
changed at all,’’ McDaniel add-
ed.

McDaniel said he felt the pro-
ject was worthwhile, both for
the community and for
Dederick.

“There’s not a great deal

“There are other possible
sites,’’ Parsons said, ‘‘(but) this
site does lend itself to the
development of theatre.”

Advantages of this location
include a large parking area
and the availability of the old
railroad station building, to
which the theatre would be jux-
taposed.

“In general, as the concept
has been developed, it would in-
corporate a three hundred seat
proscenium theatre, 33,000
square feet in all.’’ Also includ-
ed would be a black box theatre,
a scene shop, rehearsal areas,

known about the lime kiln,”’ he
added, ‘‘And there really is a
great deal that could be learned
out there.

“It seems to me to be some-
thing for him to do...to indicate
that he has some talents in this
sort of thing.’’

In approving the work-
release project, Honts told
Dederick, ‘‘I think the project is
worthwhile. This is an oppor-
tunity for you to do some useful
work during your incarcera-
tion.”

Among the conditions set by
Honts for the work-release pro-
gram were that Dederick must
return to the jail by 5 p.m. each
day and that he should not let
the project interfere with his
appearances before the special
grand jury investigating drug
trafficking or his presentations
at local high schools.

“Keep in mind that this is a

said.

Plans for the theatre, which
would cost about $5 million
were drawn up by the architec-
tural firm of Ford, Powell, and
Carson of San Antonio, Texas.

‘“‘We don’t have the money for
it yet,’ Parsons said. ‘‘We are
exploring the possibilities of
funding it. Parsons also stated
that a couple of other alter-
natives are being explored, but
he said he was not at liberty to
discuss them.

If funding were available,
Ford, Powell and Carson would
associate with architects in this
area to supervise the construc-
tion.

“If we had a green light to-
day, we could develop the
theatre in two years,’ Parsons
said. ‘‘Because of funding pro-
blems, there is no green light to-
day. This said Parsons, is why
there has not been more news
about the theatre, and why he
cannot say if or when the
theatre will be built.

While there are other projects
under consideration, such as an
activities pavilion and more
student housing, “at the mo-
ment, it (the theatre) is a very
high priority need for us.’”’ Par-
sons said. ‘‘We’ve needed one

Parsons, whose role as the ex-
ecutive assistant to the presi-
dent includes the responsibility

ning. During the fifteen years

1956 Mock Con was marked by tragedy —

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention
_ Correspondent

A keynote address — the focal
point which sets the tone for any
event.

In 1956, the W&L Mock
Democratic Convention almost
didn’t carry out its respon-
sibilities because the keynote
speech cloaked the convention
in a temporary shadow of gloom
— a shadow darkened by
tragedy.

But it was not the keynote ad-
dress itself that enveloped the
convention in darkness — words
of inspiration actually filled
Doremus Gymnasium that day.
Instead, it was the loss of a
public servant that was felt by
all.

It was April 30, 1956, the open-
ing day of the Mock Convention,
and unusually warm Spring
temperatures topping 90
degrees baked the City of Lex-
ington. Washington and Lee
students crowded into the gym
to hear the address of the
keynote speaker, one of the
most experienced statesmen of
the era, Senator and former
Vice President Alben Barkley
of Kentucky.

Barkley had given 50 years of
his life to public service,
reaching his highest office as
Vice President under President
Harry S. Truman. After the ad-
ministration’s defeat in 1952,

Barkley returned to Kentucky
and became one of its Senators.

It was this change from occu-
pying the second highest office
in the land to becoming Ken-
tucky’s junior Senator that the
fiery and deliberate Barkley ad-
dressed after concluding his
prepared speech in front of an
excited and responsive au-
dience.

Barkley: ‘But I no longer
have any personal interest (in
standing for highest office). I
have served my country and my
people for half a century...I
went into the House of
Representatives in 1913 and
served 14 years; I was a junior
Congressman; then I became a
senior Congressman; and then I
went to the Senate and became
a junior Senator and then I
became a senior Senator, and
then I became majority leader
of the Senate, and then vice
president of the United States.
And now I’m back again as a
junior Senator. (laughter). And
I am WILLING to be a junior.
I’m GLAD to sit on the back
row.

“For I would rather be a ser-
vant (his voice booming by
now) in the house of the Lord

than to sit in the seats of the
mighty.”

As the crowd roared its ap-
proval, the 78-year-old Barkley
stepped back from the podium
— and collapsed. Within
minutes he was pronounced

dead of a heart attack.

John Jennings, W&L Pro-
fessor of journalism, was a stu-
dent here in 1956 and was the
sole reporter broadcasting the
Mock Convention on station
WREL when Barkley collapsed.

“I didn’t know what to think. I
was stunned... sort of bewil-
dered. I did not know what was
going on — like everyone else,”’
recalled Jennings.

This is how Jennings describ-
ed the tragedy over WREL in
1956: “Senator Barkley has just
collapsed after saying he would
‘rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than to sit in the
seats of the mighty.’ He is now
being being fanned by the chair-
man of the convention...the
delegates are standing...there
is just an air of disbelief here.”’

All convention proceedings _

came to an end. Only Barkley’s
widow could make the student
delegates return to their task.
‘“‘You have’ unfinished
business,’’ she told convention

officals.

A week later, the students
reconvened and correctly
predicted that Adlai Stevenson
would once again be the
Democratic nominee.

Although Barkley’s keynote
address ended in tragedy, his
final words are regarded as one
of the meaningful and reflective
declarations of all public ser-
vants.

Admissions Office should recruit more actively

(continued from page 3)
applications had not reached
the ‘“‘alarmingly low levels”
cited by Davidson in its decision
to become coeducational; nor
had applications “receded to
near disaster levels,’’ as they
had at Sewanee in the years im-
mediately preceding the deci-
sion there to admit women.
Please remember that, in 1976,
the Board was informed of pro-
jections of ‘‘a levelling off (of
college-age populations) in the
late 1970s and a decline in the
1980s,’ in the report of the
Trustee Study Committee on
Coeducation, which was
chaired by Trustee Frank
Brooks. Why, then, did the
Board decide against coeduca-
tion?

In the press release announc-
ing its decision, the Board cited
“considerations of size, cur-
riculum, and_ traditional
character” as the factors in-
fluencing its decision. In-
terestingly enough, in an Ad-
missions Office survey of this
year’s freshman class, tradi-
tion, size, and academic stan-
dards were the factors most
often cited as influential in a
student’s decision to attend
Washington and Lee.

As we approach a period of
declining numbers of ap-
plicants, President Wilson has
asked the trustees to again con-
sider the question of coeduca-
tion. Recent admissions figures
reveal that the University is in
better shape, with regard to the
number of applicants, than it
was in 1976. The number of ap-
plications for this year’s
freshman class was 1,562, a con-
siderable improvement over
the low of 975. More important-
ly, however, since 1978, the year
in which Mr. William Hartog
came to W&L as director of ad-
missions, the number of
students who have enrolled
here, as a percentage of those
students offered admission, has
nosedived, from 57 percent to 42
percent. It would seem as
though Mr. Hartog has become

anywhere.

complacent, and sees coeduca-
tion as the way to attract
students to W&L without alter-
ing his current recruiting prac-
tices.

We feel that the significant
decrease in the percentage of
student enrolled is not justifica-
tion for admitting women.
Rather, it is an indication that
the Admissions Office is not
working hard enough to attract
students to Washington and
Lee. Please consider a few
more Statistics. First, the
distribution of freshmen by high
school rank is almost identical
this year to that in 1969. But in
1969, 47 percent of the ap-
plicants who were admitted ac-
tually enrolled. This year, only
42 percent enrolled. Some would
argue that this is true because
students do not want to attend
an all-male college. Question-
naires distributed to all
students admitted prove other-
wise. The Trustee Study Com-
mittee on Coeducation reported
in 1976 that ‘‘almost 50 percent”’
of admitted students who chose
to go elsewhere did so based
partially on a desire to attend a
coeducational school. The
results of this year’s survey
show that only 34 percent of the
students who decline offers of
admission here consider the
lack of coeducation to be a
drawback. We must conclude,
therefore, that the inability to
attract students to Washington
and Lee is rooted not in a desire
on the students’ part to attend
coeducational colleges, but,
rather, in less-than-vigorous
recruitment practices on the
part of the Admissions Office.

In a recent poll of 1983
freshmen, conducted by the Ad-
missions Office, 48 percent of
the respondents reported that
they. had first become _in-
terested in Washington and Lee
through alumni (19 percent),
parents (16 percent), or current
students (13 percent). In only 15
percent of the cases did the
university initiate contact,
through student search. More

applicants found out about W&L
through college guides and
other reference books than
through their high school
guidance counselors! The
message contained in these
statistics is that many students
are not applying to Washington
and Lee because they don’t
know about it. While we agree
that alumni and current
students are an important arm
of the admissions process, we
conclude that this arm has
become gangrenous. A repre-
sentative of the Alumni Admis-
sions program, with whom we
spoke, indicated that there is
virtually no cooperation or com-
munication between the Alumni
Admissions program and the
Admissions Office. The Student
Recruitment Committee is
designed primarily for the
benefit of students who have
already applied. Clearly, both
of these organizations are in
need of strengthening and ex-
pansion.

We recommend, therefore,
that the Admissions Office
adopt and practice a policy of
actively recruiting students —
that is, getting them to apply,
and, more importantly, getting
them to attend W&L once they
have been accepted. There is,
currently, no member of the Ad-
missions staff whose full-time
job is to travel to schools and
recruit top-notch students. One
should be hired immediately.
This person need not fly to
Idaho or South Dakota in search
of students; rather, he or she
should concentrate on attrac-
ting students from nearby
states. While W&L is well
respected in areas of high alum-
ni concentration, it is virtually
unknown outside these areas.
As aresult, Washington and Lee
has only a total of 165
undergraduate students from
the nearby states of North
Caroline, Tennessee, Kentucky,
South Carolina and West
Virginia. Surely an_ intense
recruiting effort in these states
could add at least 150 more high
calibre students to the W&L
population during the lean
years ahead. We further recom-
mend that the Admissions Of-
fice strive for closer coopera-
tion with the Alumni Admis-
sions program and that they

work to expand the role of this
program. Additionally, we
recommend that the Student
Recruitment Committee be
enlarged, and that its role be ex-
panded.

We recommend to the Board
of Trustees that they recall the
conclusions they reached - in
1976, namely, ‘‘that coeducation
would almost necessarily re-
quire a substantial increase in
the size of the W&L student
body,” and that coeducation
would represent a significant
break with tradition; and, fur-
ther, we hope that they will con-
sider the fact that it is the small
size and rich tradition of the
University which attracts
students to Washington and
Lee. We further recommend
that they consider that, as
President Wilson has reported,
demographic trends will re-

verse by 1992 and the period of
crisis will have passed. We urge
the Board of Trustees to keep
these factors in mind, to
recognize that any decision
made at this time would be ir-
reversible, and ultimately, to
reject any proposal for co-
education at Washington and
Lee at any time in_ the
forseeable future.

We conclude, finally, that a
‘go-get-em admissions policy,
even without the projected
reversal of demographic trends
by 1992, will ensure that
Washington and Lee can re-
main all-male and academical-
ly excellent long into the next
century.

EC should regard
honor not conduct

To the Editors:

I must take serious issue with
the recent decision of the Ex-
ecutive Committee to consider
the sale of drugs for profit as a
violation of the Honor System.
While I do not disagree with the
premise that one dealing in
drugs should be expelled from
the University, I do not see the
wisdom of placing this trans-
gression under the auspices of
the Executive Committee.

Last year’s White Book em-
phasizes that the Honor System
is designed to foster a mutual
trust within the Washington and
Lee community. Our student
government makes a clear
distinction between honor viola-
tions and conduct offenses. The
former are handled by the EC,
while the latter are under the
jurisdiction of the Student Con-
trol Committee and the Student
Affairs Committee.

One could most simply define
honor and conduct offenses in
the following manner. Honor of-
fenses are those that in the
words of the White Book “‘in-
dicate a student is not worthy of
trust by his peers.’’ Conduct
violations prove that a person is
unable to conduct himself in a

legal or civilized manner, or
that he poses a threat to the
safety of amember or members
of the University community.

While our White Book says
(and I wholeheartedly agree)
that honor cannot be codified, it
goes on to explain that lying,
cheating, and stealing are ob-
vious violations. I do not think
that anyone has been convicted
of an honor violation for any
other type of offense since I
have been at W&L. Yet, an EC
which finds it necessary to elicit
student opinion by a poll on
issues such as coeducation and
grading policies, does not seem
to feel the need to do likewise
when considering a drastic
reinterpretation (not revision)
of the Honor System. This
reinterpretation is even more
radical in light of the fact that
last year’s EC voted against
such a change while this year’s
voted unanimously for the new
policy.

I have always heard and
believed that the single sanction
is justified by a belief that honor
has no degrees. Yet during its

‘debate of the issue of drug

sales, the EC found it necessary
to say that the use of drugs is
different from the sale of drugs,
because a drug dealer has a
profit motive. If the state of
Virginia were suddenly to
reinstate Prohibition, one must
wonder if the EC would feel the

In conclusion, I believe that it
is necessary for the student

Stones show new outlook

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

Several facts must be men-
tioned before the album can be
discussed. First, Mick Jagger
turned 40 last summer and
Keith Richards turns 40 on Dec.
18. Bill Wyman and Charlie
Watts, are even older. Only Rob
Wood, 31, is still a young man. I
do not point out this fact to join
the masses in saying the Stones
are too old. The Who did not
break up because of their ages,
but because of personal dif-
ferences. Their music was still
very much to be admired.

The reason I point out this
fact is that the Stones’ recent
album, Undercover, is also a
great album. Their age would
lead one to believe that the
Stones are too old to be thinking
of politics, girls and
debauchery. To the contrary,
the Stones aren’t too old to think
about these things only their
perspective has changed. Once
known for their reputation as
degenerates and outlaws, they
now have become mature
adults with families of their
own. But the band has not
forgotten its roots, they still like
to write about sex and violence.

“ ~y ‘ >

 

 

Undercover is the album the
Stones have always wanted to
record. The work is steeped in
violence, sex and macho chest-
beating of the male ego. Yet the
Stones deal with these subjects
in a unique approach, not the
Straight-forward approach of
others. Jagger has often said
that these themes are only
meant to poke fun at the intend-
ed objects of attack. Songs
about girls are the Stones
favorite with Some Girls, T&A,
and Brown Sugar. Also the
Stones albums are beginning to
be easily identified by structure
— 10 songs, mostly uptempo
numbers (thank God, all uptem-
po this time), one Keith song,
and one reggae tune.

The best songs on the album
are Undercover, She Was Hot,
Wanna Hold You Too Tough,
Too Much Blood and It Must Be
Hell. The album, unlike others,
has a number of good singles.
An interview in the December
1983 Musician Magazine with
Keith Richards picks the single
to be She Was Hot, but it turns
out to be Undercover. Under-
cover is definitely a step for-
ward for Richards and Jagger.

The song features the steady

~ and always precise backbeat of

aR

Charlie Watts and mixes the

Philip Booth

guitars in a _pseudo-reggae
rhythm. Undercover is_ the
Stones contribution to current
politics. What is going on in
South America? they ask.

Too Tough is also in this
genre. Here the Stones again
assert infallibility of the male
ego. The cut features some
great guitar work from Ron
Wood. It Must Be Hell again
finds the Stones questioning the
world. Jagger calmly asks the
East, “‘What’s wrong with your
worl’?”

Richards’ song on the album,
Wanna Hold You, is not as good
as Happy or T&A, but then
again, it is different. The song
seems to be his declaration of
love for his girl, Patti Hansen.
Unlike most Stones songs, here
Richards says he’ll be the lover
and slave.

Now for the Mick Jagger ex-
planation of love, Tie You Up
(the pain of love). Jagger
should know a lot about the sub-
ject seeing how he has been
divorced from two wives, ac-
counted for a bastard child and
is expecting a new child from
his live-in-partner Jerry Hall.

Overall the Stones new album
is great. It gives us fresh songs
that reflect the current musical
trends of today, but also re-

 

mains true to the Stones’ classic
R&B sound we all love. Also the
album addresses current issues
of our world such as South
America and the East-West ten-
sions, as well as the problems of
violence and ‘‘too much blood”’
on the screen.

Yet the Stones do not overdo
their political feelings like The
Clash nor do they fall in the
Rolling Stone Magazine’s
classic five star category,
which considers deep. political
thought a must. Instead they
address the problems from a
different view, they raise the
issues as questions for the

public to decide.

Undercover is a fine example
of what a band can do even
though they are supposedly
“over the hill.”” The Stones are
very much like the musicians
they admire. Rhythm and Blues
greats such as Muddy Waters
and rock and roll’s founders

such as Chuck Berry still play
their music today as they did
when they were 20. Nothing is
wrong with playing music when
you’re 40 as long as you respect-
fully pass something on to the
next generation. Surely the
Rolling Stones have done this.

Booth is, in his own words,
“not just another artist on the

Film Society presents
Devil’s Playground

The Washington and Lee Film
Society’s third presentation of
the 1983-84 season will be the
1976 Australian film ‘The
Devil’s Playground’ (107
minutes), directed by Fred
Schepisi. The film will be shown
at 8 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 2 and
Saturday, Dec. 3 in classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall in the Law
School. There is no charge for
admission.

“The Devil’s Playground’’ is
director Schepisi’s (The Chant
of Jimmie Blacksmith, Bar-
barosa) semi-autobiographical
account of life in a Catholic
seminary school in Australia in
the early 1950s. Not surprising-
ly, considerable tension is
created by the conflict between
the developing sexuality of the
adolescent boys and the teach-
ings of the Church, ad-
ministered by the school’s

monks. This conflict and the
resulting problems are exacer-
bated by the school’s isolation
and the exclusively-male
character of the student body
and the clerical teaching staff.
Schepisi’s treatment of these
themes is tactful and balanced.
He does not oversimplify or
misrepresent the characters as
stereotypical innocent school-
boys or as dogmatically op-
pressive clerics. Instead, there
is sympathetic understanding

for both the boys and the
teachers, who, after all, are
subject to many of the same
frustrations and constraints.

“The Devil’s Playground is
an intelligent and sensitive at-
tempt to portray the problems
of growing up naturally in an
unnatural environment. Indeed,
few films have so well captured
the sheer embarrassment of
growing up.

Education and athletics

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....All Lexington is disgrun-
tled about such a monumental
topic as high school football
with the off again, on again, off
again soap opera featuring Ron
Pyles and a cast of thousands.
It’s the cast’ of thousands that
I’m worried about. What I think
we have here is alot of missing
information. (Are you listening
out there at the Committee for
Joint Control and the School
Board? ) Missing information, it
would seem, only heightens ten-
sion. Something that the pro-
blem at Lex High didn’t need
any more of. Coach...er ex-
Coach Pyles obviously had
something to say Monday night,
but the School Board refused to
hear it. In the earlier meeting of
the Committee for Joint Con-
trol, more questions were left
unsolved like why was Pyles ac-
tually reinstated, or for that
matter, why was he ever re-
moved? Also, why was Prin-
cipal Glen Stark, the man who
heard the original complaints
against Pyles, not called to
testify? Not tosay that answers
to any of these questions would
immediately rectify the situa-

tion, but a little pertinent would
certainly have gotten matters
back under control and pointed
in the right direction. As it is,
Pyles has resigned, this time
for good, and those who are say-
ing the matter is best left un-
discussed perhaps fail to see the

cifents igh an unresolved

situation can have on the com-
munity and the relationship be-
tween athletics and education, a
relationship that must remain
strong and pure if education, as
a whole, is to be meaningful and

point. The key to the Generals’
success is that they know what
they can and can’t do, and
they’re very good at putting this
knowledge into practice. One
other thing, the Generals are
often going to be outmanned
talent wise. That is, except at

Franke sees success

Washington and Lee’s head
wrestling coach Gary Franke is
very optimistic about this
year’s team. ‘‘We have the op-
portunity to be very com-
petitive in all 15 meets this
year,” said Franke. ‘“‘We have
good wrestlers in most of the
weight classes, and if we stay
free of injury we should have
another successful season,’’ ac-
cording to Franke.

The team, which posted a 9-2
record last year, welcomes
seven returning lettermen. The
team is led by seniors Carlton
Peebles and Tim Valliere and
junior Jeff Dixon. Both Dixon

y

and Valliere were undefeated in
last year’s dual-meet action.

The Generals will open their
season in Lynchburg against
Lynchburg College on Nov. 30.
When the teams met last year
W&L won by a score of 22-21.

On Saturday, Dec. 3, the W&L
Tournament will be hosted by
the Generals. The tournament
will include Hiram College, Get-
tysburg College, George Wash-
ington University, Longwood
College, University of Scranton,
Virginia Military Institute and
York College. Last year W&L
placed seventh in the competi-
tion.

...While we were away there
was that ‘‘fight’”’ extravaganza
staged by NBC. Let’s face it, the
only man who wanted the title
fight in the ring was the one who
couldn’t win it, namely Joe
Frazier. It was all Joe could do
to keep himself from jumping in

fading son. Maybe it’s time, by

McBryde earns A-A status

Senior Angus McBryde earn-
ed All-America status in NCAA
Division III cross country when

he finished tenth in the national .

meet at Christopher Newport
College in Newport News, Va.,
on Saturday, November 19.

McBryde covered the 8,000-
meter course in a time of 24
minutes, 19 seconds.

A week earlier he had cap-
tured the regional qualifying
meet on the same course with a

time of 24 minutes, 36 seconds.
“We had to be happy that
Angus improved his time by 17
seconds from the regional meet
to the national meet,” said W&L
cross country coach Dick Mil-
ler. “Angus had a genuinely
sensational season progressed.
I couldn’t be happier for him.”
Earlier this season McBryde
captured the ODAC individual
crown and was named the Run-
ner of the Year in the ODAC.

Swimmers fall short to Hopkins

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
swimming and diving team lost
a dual meet to Division III na-
tional powerhouse Johns
Hopkins, 57-56, on Nov. 18 at
W&L’s Cy Twombly Pool.

W&L coaches labeled the
defeat a disappointing one. ‘“‘We
were disappointed that we
came so close to beating
Hopkins but just couldn’t quite
do it,” said head swimming
coach Pago Remillard. ‘‘You
can look back over the meet and
find many places where we

could have picked up the
necessary point to win it.”

The Generals (1-1) outscored
Hopkins in the swimming
events, but suffered a 16-2 set-
back in the diving competition.
In NCAA competition, swimm-
ing and diving scores are com-
bined to produce an overall
score.

Diving coach Bob Newcomb
said, “I am not disappointed
with the way that the divers
performed.’’ According to
Newcomb, the divers, freshmen
Joe Donovan and Matt Divito,

Cagers bounce back,

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Generals’ basketball
team defeated Hampden-Syd-
ney, 63-52, Tuesday night in
Warner Center, evening their
record at 2-2 after losing both
games of the W&L Tip-Off Tour-
nament tostart the season.

For the third game this
season, 6-5 senior forward John
Lee Graves led the Generals in
scoring, getting 24 points in the
ODAC-opener against Hamp-
den-Sydney.

In the Tip-Off Tournament
W&L lost the opener to SUNY
Old Westbury, 55-51, and the
consolation game to Eastern
College, 47-45. ‘‘(In the tourna-
ment) the opposition was ex-
tremely strong and we were
very young and inexperienc-
ed,” head coach Verne Canfield
commented. But he added, “‘We
did more things right than
wrong.”

W&L’s first victory of the

 

 

bell)

    
 

season came at UNC-Greens-
boro, 43-42, on Nov. 22. In this
game the Generals applied
some of the lessons they learned
in the Tip-Off Tournament, ac-
cording to Canfield.

‘“‘We found that on offense we
had to control the ball rather
than just run up the court,” said
Canfield.

Against Hampden-Sydney,
the Generals did just that, mak-
ing 25 of 40 field goals (62.5%) to
the Tigers 21 of 44 (47.7%). W&L
also hit on 11 out of 16 free
throws, all in the second half.

The second-leading scorer
behind Graves is 6-2 junior
guard Lex Fitzenhagen, with
9.75 points per game. Fitzen-
hagen had 15 points against the
Tigers, including two three-
point plays late in the second
half that helped put the game
out of reach.

chey added 10 points and junior
forward Scott Shannon had six
points and led the team in re-
bounds with eight.

The Generals’ next game will
be against Ithaca College in the
Ithaca Tournament on Dec. 3.
The other teams participating
will be Lehman and Western
New England.

According to Canfield, all
three of the other teams are
strong, coming off winning
seasons and returning all their
starters.

‘“‘When you play the host team
in the first game, you can ex-
pect the other teams to be
stronger than you,’’ said Can-
field. This is because the host
team tends to make sure it in-
vites less-talented teams to its
tournament, and to make sure it
plays the weakest team in the
first game, according to Can-
field.

He also noted that the fact
that W&L came last in its own
tournament is an indication of
the strength of the Generals’
schedule this season.

“This is the toughest schedule
we’ve had in the 20 years I’ve
been coaching here,’’ said Can-
field.

The Generals’ next home
game is against ODAC-oppon-
ent Catholic University on Dec.

Pyles resigns at Lex High

By PAUL CLARK
. Staff Reporter

The saga has ended. Or
maybe it has just begun. That
seems to be the question these
days at Lexington High School
where head football coach Ron
Pyles has left his job for the se-
cond time this year, this time
for good.

As reported in the Nov. 10
issue of the Ring-tum Phi,
Coach Pyles had come under
considerable pressure from
reports that he had mistreated
his players. After being
dismissed from his coaching
duties by the county superinten-
dent, Pyles was re-instated in a
hearing last month by the Com-
mittee for Joint Control, at
which point his assistant
coaches resigned.

This past Monday Pyles

The Executive Committee
reminds the students that the library is for

studying. Please respect the rights

of others.

 

resigned offically when the
school board refused to allow
Pyles to ‘“‘name names’’ in his
defense. Pyles apparently felt,
and many people seem to agree,
that he should have had an op-
portunity to name people in his
defense.

When the board refused to let j

Pyles speak, he walked to the
front of the room and presented
his resignation.

“T think it’s a shame that...he
couldn’t name people in that
hearing. He basically pleaded
for an opportunity to give his
side of the story,’”’ said Gerald
Darrell, W&L Food Services
Manager.

Many Lexington High parents
and football players say they
feel like they’ve lost a good
coach and a good man. On the
other side, though, many
parents feel like it is time to
move ahead and start anew.
Glen Stark, Lexington High
Principal, has said, “‘it’s all
history now...talking about it
won’t do any good.”’ It would ap-
pear that ex-coach Pyles feels
differently. In a report in the
Lexington News-Gazette, Pyles
said that if he could raise the
money he would take legal ac-
tion against the persons who
tainted his name. He feels that
because of the “‘stigma’’ hang-
ing over him he will not have an
easy time finding a job.

Perhaps Genevieve Fried-
man, mother of team co-captain
Frank Friedman, summed up
many of the parents feelings
best in an Associated Press
release ‘‘If he has to take other
people down with him, if what
he has tosay casts bad things on
other people, then it’s better off
not said.”

At this point, Lexington prin-
cipal Glen Stark has started an
advisory committee of school
board members, teachers, par-
ents, and players to help heal
the wounds caused by the foot-
ball melee. However, the ten-
sion still leaves Lexington High
torn apart.

scribed the turnout as “‘pretty
decent”’ and added that he felt it
was a Significant random sam-

This year’s EC has received
some criticism, Jenevein ack-
nowledged, for taking up the
plus-minus issue nearly a year
and a half after its adoption by
the faculty. He pointed out,
however, that the initial deci-
sion was made too late for the
1981-82 EC to act on it, and that
last year’s EC was caught be-
tween the time the policy was
adopted and its implementa-
tion.

“The general feeling was that
there was something out there
for everybody, not that one was
any better than the other,” Ms.
Quick said.

Conduct decision, not honor

(continued from page 7)
in passively allowing the boun-
daries of honor to stretch
beyond lying, cheating, and
stealing. First, it makes one
wonder what new interpretation

the EC will issue next, Suppose
that the University receives bad
publicity because a freshman
dies in an alcohol-related acci-
dent due to intoxication induced
by liquor which his dorm
counselor obtains for him (not
an unknown practice). Would
the dorm counselor’s actions

suddenly become, to use

freshman representative An-
drew Caruther’s words, ‘‘dis-
honorable and disreputable?”’
Secondly, in handling what
were previously conduct of-
fenses, the EC finds itself in the
precarious position of making
gradations among certain acts.
For example, it is not dis-
honorable to demand drugs, bur
it is dishonorable to .supply
them. With the varying penal-
ties at its disposal, Student Af-
fairs is more capable of discuss-
ing such issues. In the cases in-
volving students convicted of
selling drugs earlier this year,

the SAC not only did not expel
the students, it also assessed
different penalties. There must
have been a good reason for the
SAC’s decisions. An honor con-
viction, however, provides only
one penalty. I do not believe
that a drug dealer deserves to
stay in the university any more
than I believe that a petty thief
deserves to be a student. I simp-
ly assert that different bodies
should expel them. I know that I
cannot trust a thief; a drug en-
trepreneur who provides what
in some circles is a desired
commodity, has only proven
that he is ungentlemanly and
capable of committing a very
serious violation of the law. Il-
legality and dishonor are not

. necessarily synonymous.
