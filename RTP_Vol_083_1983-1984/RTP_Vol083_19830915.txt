Two convicted
on drug charges

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

A Washington and Lee
University senior and a former
‘,&L student have been ordered
jailed until presentence reports
are completed after they were
convicted Friday of selling
drugs to fellow students.

Thomas J. Rohrig of
Michigan, a W&L senior, was
convicted in Lexington Circuit
Court of selling marijuana and
possession of marijuana with
intent to distribute. He faces a
maximum prison sentence of 20
years.

‘(The maximum sentence) is
not a reality...it’s not prac-
tical,’’ Rohrig said. Rohrig is
currently on a work-release
program, which allows him to
attend classes during the days
and requires him to return to
jail at night and on weekends.

“T really want to finish my
last year here,” Rohrig said.
“People make mistakes every
day of their lives — maybe not
as serious as mine — but we all
deserve a chance to come
back.”

 

Tom Rohrig

Rohrig said that the small
3ize of the campus has added to
‘the embarrasment because,
‘everyone’s pointing their
‘inger.”’

William L. Dederick of New
York, whose W&L diploma was
vithheld after his arrest in
May, was convicted of selling

cocaine, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute and
possession of marijuana seeds
and plants with intent to grow
the drug. He faces up to 40 years
in prison and a $25,000 fine, ac-
cording to Commonwealth’s At-
torney Beverly C. ‘‘John”
Read. Dederick is to report to
jail tomorrow at noon, the Lex-
ington Circuit Court Clerk said.

Read said he asked that the
two be jailed until presentence
reports are completed to ‘‘serve
as a deterrent to those who’ve
been selling marijuana and co-
caine...It’s the only deterrent
we have to pushers. For that
type of person, strong action
has to be taken.”’

The presentence reports were
requested by the defendants’ at-
torney and are designed to give
the judge a more thorough
knowledge of the defendant’s
background, aiding his deci-
sions regarding sentencing. The
reports will take four to six
weeks to complete because the
men are from other states.

Read has said he will ask for

stiff sentences.

On the W&L campus, the fate
of the two is up to the Student
Control Committee, which is
composed of class officers. The
committee’s decision may be

appealed.

Read said student informants
whose names were not revealed
in court were used in what he
called an ‘‘ongoing’’ investiga-
tion into drug distribution at the
university.

A third man, also a former

W&L student, Marc Ham, is

scheduled to be tried for posses-
sion of cocaine and sale of co-

caine on Sept. 26 at 2 p.m. in
Lexington Circuit Court. Ham
was arrested April 16 and three
ounces of cocaine were con-
fiscated from his house.

New grade system begins

Some students are unaware of many of the changes

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The introduction this fall of
plus/minus grading to replace
straight letter grades for course
work has provoked little re-
sponse from the university com-
munity, with students and
faculty alike taking a ‘‘wait-
and-see”’ attitude.

Opinion is essentially divided
as to whether the new system
will help or hurt students
overall, and several university
officials, while conceding that
the change likely will have
some effect, expect the impact
on students to be minimal.

Many students interviewed
were under the impression that
the plus/minus grades would
apply only to the 1987 entering
class but, as stated in the
university catalog, the new

system will be used for all
enrolled students.

In response to the misconcep-
tion, Lewis G. John, Dean of
Students, said, ‘‘Distribution re-
quirements and general educa-
tion requirements should be
phased in because students
should have to meet the re-
quirements of the catalog that
was current when they entered.

“This, though, is really only a
refinement in the method of
grading, so the feeling was that
it should be applied to all
classes as of a certain date.”’

The shift in grading pro-
cedure was approved by the
faculty at its May 1982 meeting.
The proposal was submitted to
it without a recommendation by
the Faculty Committee on
Courses and Degrees, which is
headed by William J. Watt,
Dean of the College.

Dean Watt said that his com-
mittee submitted the proposal
at the request of the faculty,
which then adopted it by what
he called a ‘‘significant majori-
_

The presentation was made
without an accompanying opi-
nion, he said, because ‘‘there
was no feeling on the committee
as a whole that a recommenda-
tion was needed.”’

The research for the proposal
was done in 1976, when the com-
mittee, again at the direction of
the faculty, investigated a wide
range of alternative grading
systems.

At that time, Dean Watt said,
many of the faculty members
were concerned about grade in-
flation. Any change in the
marking system was rejected,
partly due to disagreement

Review and Outlook

A Forum

According to the W&L handbook, the Ring-tum Phi
is the university newspaper which reports on all stu-
dent matters and provides a ‘‘forum”’ for student opi-
nion. While we strive to execute the first adequately,

we question the remaining accuracy in the forum
description. On the brink of a new year, the 1983-84
staff seeks to re-establish the Phi as an active and
reflective bulletin board for the student body.

Too quickly come to mind the memories of ir-
responsibly written editorials and the consequent
shower of letters berating the editors for the
‘‘shallow-mindedness’”’ or inaccuracy. Such confron-
tation often transformed the editorial page into a bat-
tle field for written blows between the student body
and the paper.

With the shadow of such confrontation still linger-
ing in some of our minds, we have planned measures
to reform the editorial page into an opinion forum.

Next week two features will debut which are aimed
at cultivating opinion. Next Thursday the Phi will in-
clude the top national and international news stories
of the week. In addition, we will interview faculty and
publish their opinions on news and trends both
domestic and foreign.

These features, in addition to guest editorials and
our own opinions, we hope will spur your response.
Whether this response is favorable or critical, our
aim is to increase weekly correspondence and
decrease campus apathy.

You and the ABC laws

Students will have to step carefully

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Freshmen and the members
of the 17 fraternities at Wash-
ington and Lee face several
threatening changes in the 1983
Rush. With the imposition of the
new drinking law, the arrival of
a new police chief facing his
first Rush season and a new
Alcoholic Beverage Control of-
ficer in Lexington, those par-
ticipating in Rush will have to
step quietly and carefully.

ST
News_ Analysis

For the first time in over 20
years, W&L men will take part
in a dry Rush, as a result of a
law passed last year in the Vir-
ginia legisiature that raised the
minimum drinking age to 19.
The Interfraternity Council, in
conjunction with the university,
has in turn, designed a Rush
schedule that still allows for a
realistic view of the fraternity
system.

The calendar maintains dry
Rush Dates and Open Houses
while simultaneously sustain-
ing times for fraternities to hold
more characteristic beer par-
ties. For rushing freshmen to
see fraternities in both at-
mospheres is essential.

But in sponsoring beer par-

ties, even more responsibility
falls on the leaders of the frater-
nities. During parties, frater-
nities must stay within the
moderate limits of the law or
face criminal charges.

According to the ABC region-
al supervising officer, the
fraternities will be trusted to
extents.

the officers of the fraternity as
well as any persons under 19
found consuming alcohol,
Stoneman explained.

A similar tone of moderation
and authority will be applied
locally by the Lexington police
force. In a meeting with the
fraternity presidents and Rush
chairmen last week Police
Chief L.O. Sutton explained his
policies.

©R easonableness in enforcement

is important, but enforcement

there will be’

 

Stoneman said that the same
enforcement policies for a dry
Rush that the ABC applied to
Virginia Tech this fall would be
used in Lexington.

“We are going to rely on the
fraternities to provide securi-
ty,” Stoneman said. ‘‘We are
not out to get them,” he con-
tinued.

He explained that parties at‘
VPI were not closely :moni-
tored. Only when complaints
were filed with the ABC was ac-
tion taken, he said. If com-
plaints were filed, an under-
cover agent was sent into the
party to investigate. If alcohol
was being served to those under
age, the party was closed and
charges were pressed against

“T like to think of myself as
being reasonable,” Sutton told
the fraternity officers. ‘‘Rea-
sonableness in enforcement is
important, but enforcement
there will be.”’

“I’m not going to be going
around smelling everybody’s
cups,”’ he continued, ‘“‘but if
there are 17- and 18-year-olds
getting crocked and stumbling
around, I’m going to do some-
thing about it.’’

And so it seems that the
fraternities have been given
enough rope to either rescue or
hang themselves. Which will
happen depends entirely on
their ability to walk the straight
and narrow line of ‘“reason-
able”’ security.

Paper is starting on shaky ground

By SCOTT MASON

Spring term seems just a
short time ago. The front lawn
of the Colonnade was littered
with would-be lacrosse players,
shirtless frisbee throwers, and
sun-bathers greased with body
oil.

Summer has breezed by. Last
year’s seniors are gone, this
year’s freshmen have arrived,
new professors have replaced
old, and the Ring-tum Phi has
changed hands.

Chief Editors Rick Swagler
and John Cleghorn are seeking
changes in the Phi — upgrading
the writing, offering a wider
variety of articles, improving
the way the Phi looks and reads.
But the new editors begin their
job on shaky ground.

Generally, the purpose of any
newspaper is to accurately in-
form its readers of what’s going
on around them. When a news-
paper fails to report meaningful
events, its readers are cheated
out of news which may affect
them.

It’s essential that Swagler
and Cleghorn ensure that the
Phi properly covers the news,
especially in light of an incident
last May.

It’s been the policy of the Phi

to cover weekly Executive
Committee meetings no matter
how boring or how trivial the
agenda. And so it should. The
Executive Committee is the
voice of the student body, com-
posed of at least one represen-
tative from each class.

Few realize the enormous
power and responsibility of the
EC. In addition to handling
disciplinary matters, it controls
the purse strings of nearly
every university subcommittee.
It could, for example, take

Readers’
Advocate

away all funds from the Student
Activities Board. That would
mean no Tuesdays in the Pit, no
Fancy Dress, no Homecoming
or Spring weekends.

 

Last May, Bill Roberts, then
editor-in-chief, decided the Phi
would not cover an Executive
Committee meeting involving
White Book revisions (rule
changes). At that meeting, the
Committee discussed the defini-
tion of an honor violation. Ac-

cording to the White Book, an
honor violation is committed
when a person lies, cheats or
steals. The EC debated extend-
ing that definition to include ly-
ing, cheating, stealing, and
other actions generally thought

 

Scott Mason

to be disreputable. This, for ex-
ample, would have made using
drugs an honor violation. As it
stands now, using or selling
drugs is “‘legal’’ in the eyes of
the university.

Roberts did show up at the
Committee’s next meeting and
was asked why the Phi wasn’t
present the week before.
Roberts reply was ‘Who
cares?” A heated argument en-
sued between Roberts and the

Behind the Readers’ Advocate

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

This year’s Ring-tum Phi will
include a forum for students to
praise or criticize the paper
edited by senior Scott Mason.

As the ‘“‘Readers’ Advocate,”’
Mason will criticize or praise
the Phi’s coverage and if
necessary explain the reason-
ing behind editorial decisions.
Mason will also make sugges-
tions for correcting any inac-
curacies or imbalances. In
short, he will voice the concerns
of the readers.

By way of _ introduction,
Mason is a senior from South
Dartmouth, Mass., majoring in

journalism. Last year, he serv-
ed as junior representative on
the Executive Committee.

Last spring, he worked as a
reporter at the Roanoke World-
Times and during the summer
he was a reporter for the CBS
television affiliate in Rich-
mond, WTVR-TV.

At W&L, he has been a report-
er for the Phi, an anchor and
producer of the WLUR-FM
news program ‘‘Meridian”’ and
a news anchor for the evening
news on W&L’s cable television
station, Cable 9.

Mason was chosen for the
position because of his variety
of experience in both W&L stu-

dent government and _ jour-
nalism. We hope this will give
him a unique perspective from
which to comment.

Anyone with questions or
comments concerning the ac-
curacy or fairness of any ar-
ticles should contact Scott
Mason at 463-6861. Mason will
investigate the complaint, if
necessary, and publish a cor-
rection if warranted.

Committee over what the Phi
should and should not be re-
sponsible for printing. Insults
flew, and at least one member
of the EC voted to reprimand
Roberts.

Also present was Rick
Swagler. Swagler, already
named as one of next year’s
editors, was asked what he
thought of the Phi’s absence at
the meeting held the week
earlier. His reply was that the

Phi will cover what it deems is
news, that it will cover EC
meetings if the Committee
stops looking over the Phi’s
shoulder and telling the Phi
what it should print.

The Ring-tum Phi has a duty
to cover every Executive Com-
mittee whether the EC “‘looks
over its shoulder’ or not. The
EC often makes important deci-
sions which affect students, and

it’s the Phi’s responsibility to
provide this information so that
students are aware of what
decisions do affect them and
how they affect them.

People do care about what
goes on inside the EC room.
But, if the Phi doesn’t cover EC
meetings people won’t be allow-
ed the opportunity to care and

will be cheated out of news
which could have an impact on
them.

This year the Phi may find
other committees “‘looking over
its shoulder.’ Those in charge
of Mock Convention may, for
example, press the Phi for
coverage or point out conven-
tion events it deems important
to print. That’s no reason for the
Phi to retaliate by not giving
any coverage of the event. It’s
news, and failure to cover the
event would be irresponsible.

The meeting the Phi missed
last May involved a controver-
sial subject and was one of the
most important EC meetings of
the year. The Phi, however,
didn’t just fail to carry out its
responsibility as a newspaper;
it missed an opportunity to
capitalize on a delicate topic af-
fecting all W&L students and to
editorialize or provide its own
opinion on the matter.

It’s important for Swagler
and Cleghorn to realize their
responsibilities from the start
and to cover the news no matter
who’s looking over the Phi’s
Shoulder. The ground they
begin on is shaky. It’s up to
them to smooth the road ahead.

St. Clair said that the 150
dancers deserved a great deal
of the credit for the Super-
dance’s success. Students from
W&L, Hollins College, Southern
Seminary, Sweet Briar College,
Mary Baldwin College, Ran-

danced in the Superdance.

Paper’s history one of perseverance

By JOHN CLEGHORN

The managing editor leaned
back smugly in his desk chair
and glanced over the clips the
student had submitted in ap-
plication for the summer intern-
ship.

The student sat anxiously
across the desk. The word pro-
cessors tapped quietly in the
newsroom outside the door.

The managing editor flipped
through the articles a last time
and looked up at the student.

“Your resume looks 0.k. and
your clips are pretty good,” he
said, ‘‘but there is one thing.”’

“Yes sir, what’s that?’’ the
nervous applicant shot back.

“What the HELL is the Ring-
tum Phi?”’

It was the year 1897. Henry
Ford was having his first
thoughts about a horseless car-
riage and the Wright brothers
were hard at work in their bicy-
cle shop, laying down the
original plans for something
called an airplane. William Jen-
nings Bryan was trying to con-
vince America that he would be
as effective in the oval office as
in the courtroom.

And in Lexington, several en-
thusiastic young men‘ had
started the first weekly news-
paper at Washington and Lee.

It was a group of wide varie-
ty, that first editorial board.
Members came from Texas,
Missouri, West Virginia, Ken-
tucky and Virginia. You get the
impression that these fellows
were sports buffs at heart. In
the first issue, they stated clear-
ly that their rebel publication
would not rival the Southern
Collegian, the ruling W&L
publication at the time.

Instead, these guys stuck to
sports. Singing and chanting
was the rage at the time and so

these characters decided to
name their new paper after a
popular football cheer. It went
like this:

Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum,

We’re hot stuff from Lex-
ington

Kah, rah, rah, White and Blue

Whoopla, Whoopla, W.L.U.

Stickert Bum

Yes, they did a lot of cheering
back then. A new cheer was
printed in every edition so the
more fair-hearted minks could
cheer on their more sturdy
associates in the trenches. In
addition to the cheers, there
were previews of games, statis-
tics and more songs. Sports fill-
ed the front page, the editorial
columns and the adver-
tisements.

With the turn of the century,
the young paper published a
revolutionary idea: Photo-
graphs. The 1903 graduation
edition included pictures of the
colonnade and the members of
the graduating class. Consider-
ing that the camera was only in-
vented in the 1890s, the editors
must have felt pretty proud.

Through the years, the paper
grew in strength and populari-
ty. Much to the chagrin of the
founding editors, more news
was included later in the four
page weekly.

Veeceseceeesecessesos

In 1921, the paper reported
that the academic average for
the members of the ten frater-
nities on campus was a dismal
71, But on the brighter side, the
paper gladly announced that
the university co-op would re-
open its doors ‘‘for the first time
since the war.”

After a period of growth for
the fraternity system, the paper
came out strongly against haz-
ing. One editorial called for the
end of the weekly beatings of
freshmen pledges.

Fate brought an end to such
menial subjects a decade later.

In the heightening threat of
the second world conflict, one
editorial called for students to
attend to their studies while ‘‘on
borrowed time’’ at the universi-
ty. In the same issue the State
Theatre showed its patriotism
by advertising the newest Hol-
lywood release; “Desperate
Journey’ starring Ronald
Reagan and Errol Flynn.

Slowly the student body and
the Ring-tum Phi staff fell vic-
tim to the attrition of war until
one issue reported that the
paper had ‘“‘ground to a stop.”’
The Phi was not published for
the next two years.

eeverseceeeccccccsese

But the beleaguered young
journalists could not be held
down for long and in 1946 the
Phi came roaring back into
publication and _ popularity.
Assuming the same appearance
and role in the university, the
Phi retook its place and has
been published weekly since
then.

You hold in your hands a
Ring-tum Phi with a purpose
very much the same as that
published since the turn of the
century. The tradition and
history of the W&L weekly
make it a unique and perserver-
ing publication. Much like that
original group of editors, stern
and energetic in their high-
button suit-coats and their
starch-stiff collars, it is the in-
tent and responsibility of the
staff to uphold and improve on
that history.

Orientation called ragged

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

The freshman class under-
went a “ragged’’ orientation
last week, according to the
Dean of Freshmen, H. Robert
Huntley.

“Orientation (this year) was
ragged,’’ Huntley said, blaming
the uneasy period on late or
forgetful speakers, not
students.

“There was a problem with
two many athletic tests at dif-
ferent times which rushed
freshmen meetings with ad-
visers,’’ Huntley added.

This year’s orientation
schedule had several changes.
Freshmen met their advisers
for the first time on an
“academic”’ basis, a change
preferred by the majority of ad-
visers according to Huntley. In
the past, freshmen had a more
social first meeting with their
advisers highlighted by dinner
together and dessert at the ad-

viser’s home. Though freshmen
still went to the advisers’ homes
after the first meeting, numer-
ous events on campus cut short
most of the meetings and led to
many faculty complaints.

While the schedule may have
appeared ‘‘ragged”’ to Huntley,
he spoke highly of their
cooperation and courtesy dur-
ing the week.

One freshman counselor,
Chris Cartmill, also had high
marks for the freshmen’s first
week and the class as a whole.

“They seem to be more ma-
ture than last year’s class,”
noted Cartmill, a second-year
counselor.

Cartmill also felt the orienta-
tion process had several loop-
holes, especially when it came
to the explanation of frater-
nities and the Rush system.

“Who is there to really help
them in the decision ‘process?
Rush questions abound,’’ Cart-
mill said.

New Jersey, also felt the Rush
orientation left many questions
unanswered.

“At the Rush meeting, they
talked about nothing we didn’t
already know or had already
thought about,’’ Spear said.

Spear’s classmate, Jeff Duke,
agreed, noting that rush
vocabulary — ‘rush date,’ ‘bid,’
etc. — had never been ade-
quately explained.

Dean Dan Murphy, Inter-
fraternity Council adviser,
believed this year’s Rush orien-
tation had gone better than in
previous years.

‘About two-thirds to three-
quarters of the freshmen at-
tended Rush orientation,’ Mur-
phy estimated. ‘‘Some fresh-
men had conflicts due to
athletic meetings.”

Murphy also believed the
Rush presentation was ‘‘clearly
presented and understood.’’

Confusion abounded not only
in the area of Rush and frater-
nities, but also in freshmen
questions about the Honor Code.
Len Howard, secretary of the
EC, thought this year’s session
with the freshmen went
smoothly, though he thought
freshmen’s fear of the Honor
System was unfounded and
often turned to the humorous
side. .

“One freshman wondered if
sleeping over at Sweet Briar
was an H.V.,’’ Howard joked.

The numbers on the frosh

Washington and _ Lee’s
freshman class ‘‘just might be a
unique bunch,’ according to
Robert Huntley, dean of W&L
freshmen.

Statistically, this year’s 360
entering freshmen are very
similar to those of previous
years, yet Huntley adds that
they seem to be more compati-
ble.

‘“‘When they’re walking
around the campus in groups of
six or eight, two or more of
them will always speak. Or-
dinarily peer pressure doesn’t
permit that sort of thing,’
Huntley said.

Huntley also added that he
was surprised at how well the
freshmen coped with ‘‘one of

the most miserably hot orienta-
tion weeks in living memory.”

This year’s freshman class
was chosen from a pool of 1,562
applications and include 14
students who finished first or
second in their graduating
class. Twelve incoming fresh-
men were National Merit
Scholarship finalists and six
freshmen received W&L honor
scholarships. The average
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
scores for the new students
were 555 verbal and 595 math.

Members of the class of 1987
come from 280 secondary
schools and represent 32 states
and 7 foreign countries. The
largest group (61) comes from
the commonwealth of Virginia.
New York was second with 43,
followed by New Jersey (30),
Maryland (28), Pennsylvania
(22), Texas (21) and Florida
(18).

Similar to last year, 60 per-
cent of the freshmen attended
public or parochial high schools
while the remaining 40 percent
came from independent
schools.

Washington and Lee awarded
some sort of financial aid to 109
new freshmen, of which 42 were
ranked in the top tenth of their
class.

Overall, 892 students were of-
fered admission to’ W&L with
the 360 deciding to attend.

ummertime:when business is slow

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

If you think Lexington curls
up and goes to sleep during the
summer as might be expected
in a city of 7,300 people — when

nearly 3,000 students head home
for the summer — you’re only
partially correct.

According to area merchants,
business is not that bad during
the summer. Lexington’s tour-
ist trade, summer school at Vir-

ginia Military Institute and the |

various alumni programs at
Washington and Lee pick up the
slack during the summer.

Estimates of the drop in sales ™
ranged from 35 to 40 percent at *

 

close a half-hour earlier during
the week and at 1 p.m. on Satur-
days.

While business at the College
Town Shop is not hurt that much
during the summer, business at
Alvin-Dennis ‘‘drops off a lot,”’
Alvin Carter said.

‘‘We do miss the students in
the summer,’”’ Carter con-
tinued. ‘“You wonder some days
in the summer what you’re go-
ing to do. But we’re still moving
merchandise.”’

ae

Spanky’s restaurant to no drop =

at all at the College Town Shop
clothing store, according to an
informal Ring-tum Phi survey.

Jayne Plogger, assistant
manager of Spanky’s, describ-
ed the summer drop in business
as ‘“‘quite a bit.” She added,
though, that ‘‘this summer was
stronger than usual.” The
restaurant still had an esti-
mated 40 percent drop in sales.

At the other extreme is the
College Town Shop, where co-
owner Martha Derrick said;
“It’s a strange phenom-
enon...business doesn’t drop
off.’

“It’s a different business
(during the summer). It
changes as far as the customer
and what they purchase, but it
doesn’t change in volume due to
the conferences at the schools,
the tourist season and the local
people going on vacation who
want new clothes.”

Only two afternoons this sum-
mer were absolutely dead,’’ Ms.
Derrick said.

The College Town Shop, along
with several other merchants in
town, including Alvin-Dennis,
decided several years ago to
shorten their hours slightly dur-
ing the summer. The stores

v

 

Carter said the slowest period
of the summer is the end of July
and the beginning of August,
but the store still manages to
pick up some of the local trade
and tourism.

Alvin-Dennis’ sales, never-
theless, drop between five and
30 percent during the summer,
Carter said.

Business at the Palms
restaurant ‘“‘actually doesn’t
drop off that much because we
do a good tourism business,”

One of the casualties of the summer business lag is the White Col-

owner Jay Korn said. However
the restaurant does see about a
15 percent decrease in business.

“If we were not a college
town, I could survive.’”’ Korn
added.

Although the absence of
students is felt at McCrum’s
drugstore, another factor con-
tributes to a decline in business
there during the summer
—people just don’t get as sick as
often according to Jerry Robin-
son, manager.

“‘The business is slow in the
summer, and then it does pick
up in the fall,’ Robinson said.
“‘The students are gone and the

| people are on vacation and out
| swimming and enjoying the
| weather.”’

Sam Moore, owner of the

White Front Grocery, said his

business drops about 20 percent
during the summer. “It’s a
nine-month business town. Any

time volume’s down 20 percent,
it hurts. But you get used to the
ebbs and flows.”

Lexington’s tourism trade
does help businesses during the
summer, said Martha Doss,
director of tourism for the city.
During the summer of 1981,
17,697 visitors passed through
the visitor’s center.

That number increased 6.5
percent to 18,856 in the summer
of 1982 when the World’s Fair in
Knoxville brought many tour-
ists down Interstate 81, and
through the town.

The number of visitors this
summer was down slightly to
18,779.

Ms. Doss is one Lexingtonian
who enjoys the peace and quiet
of Lexington in the summer.
“During the summer, it’s so
delightful around here,” she
said. “even parking is very
easy.”

Sigma Nu returns to W&L
with help from headquarters

By TORI RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee com-
munity began its 1983-84 year by
welcoming one of its oldest in-
stitutions back on campus, the
Sigma Nu Fraternity. Having
had its Charter suspended in the
Fall of 1981 after accumulating
$10,000 in debts and failing to
repay loans made by the na-
tional fraternity, the Sigma Nu
fraternity was able to obtain the
permission and funds needed to
reorganize the house and to
repair damages.

Chris John, president of the
W&L chapter, said the Sigma
Nu headquarters, located in
Lexington, played a major part

in the re-establishment: of the
campus chapter. ‘‘This - past
April the W&L chapter of Sigma
Nu celebrated its centennial. At
that time, the national reac-
tivated the chapter’s charter
and informed us of the money

being raised to finance the

renovation of the house,’’ John
said.

Two representatives from the
national headquarters had in-
itiated John and three others
during the Fall of 1982 rush
period. Seven other members
were initiated later in the year.

According to John, the plans
to re-establish the house started
in the summer of 1982.

director of the Sigma Nu na-

had asked if I would be in-

‘the chapter on campus. He

mentioned the importance of
having the house reorgainzed
for the centennial celebration.
And I saw this as a good oppor-
tunity to have a new fraternity
on campus that would have a
positive influence on the rest of
the houses.”

suspended after the university
stopped recognizing it as a
fraternity. The house also had
problems with its neighbors and
had violated many standards
and warnings set by the univer-
sity.

The house, which was exten-
sively damaged by a mysteri-
ous fire set a year ago, required
extensive restoration. Accor-
ding to Mo Littlefield, executive
director of the Sigma Nu na-
tional, much of the money was
obtained from money raised by
Sigma Nu alumni, the national
chapter, and Washington and
Lee.

“The University and the na-
tional chapter were very sup-
portive in helping the house to

   

re-establish ground on campus
out of the $50,000 given to the
W&L chapter, about one-third

.of it came from the university

and the other two-thirds from
alumni and the national.”’

Sigma Nu, which now has 11
members living in the house, is
now financially solvent, accord-
ing to John.

“We got about 60 guys to sign
up for open house this week. I
am sure that the present state
of the house may deter some
guys from pledging our house.
However, the new Sigma Nu
isn’t looking for numbers, we’re
looking for a diverse group of

guys who can add plenty to the
house. We don’t want the same
problems to reoccur.”

Fight teachers join W&L faculty

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

With the start of classes this
week eight teachers joined
Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate faculty, and the
law school gained two.

Joining the undergraduate
faculty were: Joseph Martinez,
assistant professor of drama;
Capt. John D. Smith, assistant
professor of military science;
Lyn F. Wheeler, assistant pro-
fessor of accounting; Jean C.
Dunbar, assistant professor of
English; Robert I. Tharp, in-
structor in art; Ann Taylor
Thornton, part time instructor

in music; Henry Sharp Jr., pro-
fessor of mathematics, Peggy
Hays, assistant professor and
reference and public services
librarian; and Dennis Daly,
assistant professor of physical
education and head lacrosse
coach.

Martha I. Morgan, visiting
associate professor of law, and
Joan M. Shaughnessy, assistant
professor of law were the addi-
tions to the law school faculty.

Martinez plans to “‘[revamp]
the entire acting program.”’
During the next five years he
hopes to increase the number of
drama majors, build a new
theatre, initiate exchange pro-
grams with nearby women’s

 

colleges, and produce plays that
will be more popular with both
drama students and their au-
dience.

Some of the changes will be
apparent in the first production
this year, which will include a
number of samurai sword
fights; stage fighting being one
of Martinez’ specialties. Stunt-
men’s unions have prevented
him from practicing this in the
United States, but he has been
involved in shows that have
toured Europe. Martinez feels
this European experience is im-
portant because it gives a ‘“‘dif-
ferent perspective of the
theatre.”’

John D. Smith, assistant professor of military science; Joan M. Shaughnessy, assistant professor of
law; Lyn F. Wheeler, assistant professor of accounting; (standing from left), Joseph Martinez, assis-
tant professor of drama; Sgt. Ray Kuper, operations sergeant in the university’s ROTC detachment;
Dennis Daly, assistant professor of physical education and head lacrosse coach; Henry Sharpe Jr., pro-
fessor of mathematics; Jean C. Dunbar, assistant professor of English; and, Martha I. Morgan, visiting

Increasing the number of
drama majors to about fifty —
W&L has about 20 now — is
high on Martinez’ list of
priorities. However, at the
same time he wants to keep the
size of the department small
enough to allow a maximum
amount of personal contact,
which he says is one of W&L’s
strong points.

One major weakness, though,
is the lack of women to play
leading roles. By starting an ex-
change program with neighbor-
ing women’s schools (with
whom he has already started
talks) he hopes to remedy this
problem. In addition to increas-
ing the involvement of college
women, Martinez says increas-
ing participation by community
residents, especially in roles un-
suited for college men, is high
on his agenda.

One of the more difficult pro-
jects Martinez has assigned
himself is the construction of a
new theatre. Here he has a
powerful ally in President
Wilson, who has pointed out the
shortcomings in W&L’s theatre
facilities. Plans for a ‘‘very
functional’’ new theatre,
possibly to be built at the site of
the old train station, have
already drawn up, and Mar-
tinez says he hopes construction
can start as soon as possible.

To go with the new theatre the
former University of Illinois
teacher hopes to initiate a new
line of plays, using surveys of
faculty and students to deter-
mine which plays will have the
most appeal and benefit.
However, he hastens to add, the
program will still cover all the
genres of theatre every four
years, so students can be expos-
ed to the full range of the
theatrical experience.

First meeting

 

Executive
Committee

sworn-in

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Nine executive committee
members, including student
body president Bob Jenevein,
were sworn in Monday night by
Dean Lewis John during the
EC’s first meeting of the school
year.

After the swearing-in, the
meeting was devoted to an-
nouncements and reports from
the Cold Check Committee, the
Emergency Student Loan Com-
mittee and the Student
Telephone Union.

A topic of discussion for each
of the three organizations was
collection of money from
graduated students.

Each committee has sent let-
ters to these alumni and is
holding their transcripts until
the money is repaid.

Additional methods for
collecting the money were sug-
gested by EC members. These
included sending letters to the
parents and having the EC’s at-
torney write letters to the
students.

Jenevein announced the for-

James Cook Jr.,
music professor,

dies at age 51

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

James Tucker Cook Jr., assis-
tant professor of music at
Washington and Lee, died at the
age of 51 this summer.

The death on July 5 in a
Waynesboro hospital was re-
portedly the result of lung
cancer.

In August, the university
received a gift of $25,000 from

 

The Ring-tum Phi, September 15, 1983, Page 11

an anonymous donor to estab-
lish an endowed scholarship in
his memory.

According to university of-
ficials, the James Tucker Cook
Jr. Memorial Scholarship will
be awarded to a W&L student
who has demonstrated financial
need and is an active partici-
pant in the music curriculum of
the Fine Arts department.

Cook, a 1954 graduate of
W&L, received his master’s
degree from Columbia. He
taught music at a number of in-
stitutions, including Mary
Baldwin College, before return-
ing to his alma mater in 1968.

An accomplished organist
and pianist, Cook’s specialty

Robert Stewart, head of the
music department, said that
Cook was ‘“‘a thorough, com-
plete musician’ whose “‘first
love was his studio.”

“He always had a solid
outlook,” Stewart said. ‘‘He
was not, like most musicians,
moody.”

Stewart remembers Cook as
“an inspirational teacher” who
“was always interested in his
students’ welfare.’’

The music history courses
Cook taught will not be offered
again until next fall, when a
full-time replacement for him
will be hired. According to
Stewart, the selection process is

H. Marshall Jarrett, a pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee
since 1963, was named by the
University Board of Trustees
this summer to succeed William
A. Jenks as head of the depart-
ment of history.

Jenks, who served the univer-
sity beginning in 1946, retired in
May after chairing the depart-
ment for twelve years. Jarrett
assumed his position on July 1.

William J. Watt, Dean of the
College, said that Jarrett was
chosen by the Trustees on the
advice of University President
John D. Wilson. Jarrett had
been recommended to Wilson
by the President’s Advisory
Committee, which consists of
the three academic deans and
three elected professors.

Watt said that all members of
the history department were
consulted during the selection
process.

A graduate of Washington
and Lee, Jarrett received his
master’s degree and Ph.D.
from Duke University, where
he concentrated his studies in
the French Revolution and the

 

Jarrett named department head

intellectual history of the 18th
and 19th centuries.

The Oklahoma native, who
has conducted historical re-
search in Europe, taught at
Duke and at Westminster Col-
lege in Maryland before joining
the W&L faculty.

Jenks was quite enthusiastic
regarding the appointment of
Jarrett. ‘“‘He is an extremely
competent colleague,” Jenks
said. ‘‘He has been at my right
hand all the years I chaired the
department...I’m delighted he
got the job.”’

Jenks, who said that he could
always depend on Jarrett for
‘“‘good advice,’ said that Jar-
rett did an excellent job of fill-
ing in for him as department
head when Jenks’s work took
him abroad.

“T really have retired,’’ Jenks
said following a vacation to
Mexico. “‘I make it a point to not
even go into the office to pick up
my mail. The department needs

 

Don’t wait in slow lines
for fast food.

 

a clean transfer of administra-
tion.”

Jarrett stated that his pre-
decessors have given him a
“hard act to follow.” “‘I hope at
minimum to keep it like it is,”’
he said with a short laugh.

“Since I was a student here,”’
he said, ‘‘we’ve had four depart-
ment heads. Throughout that
period, the quality of the
department has been very
high...Those men are responsi-
ble for building a strong depart-
ment. It is that tradition of
leadership that I hope to
uphold.”

“The department at the mo-
ment is very strong,” he con-
tinued, ‘“‘but we don’t want to
seem self-satisfied or rest on
our laurels. My goal is to main-
tain our present strength and
look to the future with op-
timism.”’

According to Jarrett, all of
the department’s ‘‘bases are
covered,” except for an Islamic

history course which Jenks
taught. Jarrett said that al-
though this field is ‘certainly
important,’’ the class will tem-
porarily not be offered.

The immediate concern con-
fronting the department, Jar-
rett said, is the curriculum
change approved last spring.
He said that some adjustments
will have to be made, and that
the department would be wat-
ching to see how the alterations
‘“‘will affect our position and

teaching mission. We’ve been
flexible in the past, and we plan
to continue in that direction.”

Jarrett said it’s ‘‘very ex-
citing’’ to work with profes-
sionals like those in the history
department. ‘“‘There is good
variety among our faculty,’’ he
said. ‘“‘They’re very active and
productive, and our new mem-
bers have made a big contribu-
tion to the department.”’

He cites as key strengths the
use of ‘“‘innovative, creative
teaching methods’ and the
wide range of available classes.

‘“‘We cover not only the tradi-
tional European and American
history, but also Latin
American, Far Eastern, Afri-
can, and Indian history as
well,” he continued.

Thousands of Army ROTC graduates, from hundreds of

Some enrolled in ROTC for financial aid to complete col-

ROTC scholarships). Others for the management training
and experience offered by Army ROTC courses. Still others
for the positions of immediate leadership responsibility
following graduation, as officers in the active Army,
Reserves, and Army National Guard.

But most enrolled also to serve their country. Men from
the north, the east, the south, the west ... from small urban

Progress pleases Fallon

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

After losing two veteran
quarterbacks whom he thought
would be returning, head coach
Gary Fallon is now starting a
sophomore who has yet to take
a college snap from center.
You’d think he’d be a little bit
worried about his chances. On
the contrary, the Generals
sixth-year leader has nothing
but praise for his new signal
caller, Bobby Wilson, and says
of the entire squad, ‘‘This is the
hardest working group I’ve

ever had.”’

' The 1983 Generals are solid
everywhere, but their greatest
strength most certainly is the
veteran offensive line. ‘‘No
question about it,”’ notes Fallon,
“that (the offensive line) is the
strength. They led our offense
in’ pre-season. They make no
mistakes.”

The line is anchored by two
time All-ODAC first team
center, senior Glenn Kirschner.
Kirschner is flanked by two All-
ODAC second team guards,
seniors Dan Seal and Craig
Reilly. Rounding out W&L’s

five blocks of granite are
veteran tackles Jim Koenig, a
senior, and Pat O’Connell, a
junior.

The Generals’ backfield was
hurt by graduation and the
departure of quarterbacks Al
Paradise and John Thompson.
Gone are standout performers
Ken Robinson and All-ODAC
first team tailback Chris
Cavalline. Coach Fallon has
these shoes filled quite well
already, commenting, “It’s as
strong a backfield as we’ve ever
had.”’

Wilson, who Fallon calls ‘‘the
quarterback’s quarterback,”
has all of the head coach’s con-
fidence. ‘“‘Bobby has been most
impressive. He has taken over
the leadership role quite well.’’
Completing the W&L backfield
will be Fallon’s “runaway
truck,”’ sophomore Frank Sur-
face and getting the nod at
tailback will be junior Gene
Girard, who will be followed by
sophomore Chris Bleggi and
freshman pleasant surprise
Michael Weaver, as Fallon
hopes to utilize ‘‘fresh legs as
often as we can.”

‘“‘’m not sure how this team

though,” promised Fallon. It

tween the two schools, dating
back to 1921. The series is tied

Water polo to defend title

By DAVE NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team looks forward
to winning its third consecutive
Southern League Championship
as head coach Page Remillard
nears his 100th victory as a
water polo coach at W&L. The
Generals begin their 1983 tour-
nament schedule’ Friday
September 16 at 7:30 p.m. when
they play the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock in the
W&L Fall Classic. The tourna-
ment will be played at the
Warner Center and will also in-
clude teams from Navy, Buck-
nell, Johns-Hopkins, UNC
Wilmington, Richmond, and a
W&L B team.

Evaluating the 1983 season
Remillard said, ‘‘We’ll take our
lumps at the beginning of the
season, but we will play very
well at tournament time.” The
starting line-up for this year’s
team is stronger than last
year’s, but this year’s team
lacks depth. According to Coach
Remillard, ‘‘This year’s start-
ing lineup would beat last
year’s, but last year’s bench

would rip this year’s apart.’’ He
believes, however, that the
depth of the team will improve
as the 14 freshmen improve.

Coach Remillard does not
believe that this year’s team
will win as many games as last
year’s team (26-9) saying, ‘“We
play a much tougher schedule
this year.’’ W&L’s 1983 schedule
includes several encounters
with Navy, Bucknell, Brown,
Slippery Rock and Richmond.
Coach Remillard also states,
“We’ve added two weekend
dates to our schedule which in-
volve several of the top ten
teams on the East coast.

The loss of All-American Erik
Peterson will be offset by a very
strong starting line-up. The 1983
team will feature a team that
revolves around a team concept
instead of revolving around a
single player. ‘‘I am very ex-
cited about the starting line-up.
We have six players who com-
plement each other and want to
help each other win,’’ said
Remillard.

Three co-captains will be
leading the Generals this year.

they are seniors Matt Raven-
craft, Tim Rock and Don Smith.
Ravencraft was tied for second
as a leading scorer and led the
team in assists last year. Bobby
Pearson, who Remillard says is
a very smart player and the
real thinker in the offense, will
also make a significant con-
tribution to the starting line-up.
Much improved sophomores
Ken Johnstone and Tim Stan-
ford are also members of the
starting line-up.

Washington and Lee will
enter a B team in the Fall
Classic this weekend. The team
will primarily consist of
freshmen. The B team plays
their first match of the tourna-
ment against Navy at 5 p.m.
Friday. The purpose of the B
team’s participation is that the
freshmen will acquire some of
the experience needed to help
the entire water polo team im-
prove. Remillard is confident
that his team will improve as
the season progresses. He
stated: “Among East coast
teams W&L has a reputation of
improving a great deal from the
beginning of the season to the
end.”’

Piranian thinking big

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Writer

The 1983 edition of Generals’
soccer is about to unfold as the
booters open their season on
Tuesday against the rival
Royals of Eastern Mennonite.
Game time is 3:30 at Wilson
Field.

The Generals, who finished a
close second in the ODAC (3-1-2
in the conference, and 8-3-2
overall) a year ago, will aim to
better last season’s perfor-
mance. Under the direction of
sixth-year head coach Rolf
Piranian, the Generals will aim
for the NCAA playoffs, a goal
that eluded them last season.

The Generals will have strong
leadership on the field in the
presence of senior co-captain
Roland Simon at center forward
and junior co-captain Rob Cole-
man at sweeper back. W&L’s
soccer program is also pleased
with the return of junior Mark
Sullivan at center midfielder
after a year’s absence. Sullivan
was All-ODAC two seasons ago.

The talent does not stop there,
however, Coach Piranian, who
must replace six starters lost
through graduation, feels,
“Last season we were deep and
now this season those that
played on the B team are ready
to step right in. We also have a
fine crop of freshmen who will

add to our depth.”’

During preseason practices
Piranian felt that they were
very strong offensively. ‘“‘We
are going to be exciting on of-
fense and we will score a lot of
goals,’’ Piranian noted. He also
commented that defensively the
Generals will need some work.

The Generals in pre-season
polls were picked to finish third
this season in the ODAC behind
Lynchburg and Roanoke. How-
ever, Piranian feels differently,
“I believe this is the year that
we can emerge from the pack
and win the conference title.”
The Generals will be hoping to
better last season’s 1-1 overtime
tie with the Royals.

Athletics fills new posts

Long helps lax

Jeffrey J. Long, an All-
America lacrosse player at the
U.S. Naval Academy in the mid-
1970’s has joined the Washing-
ton and Lee University athletic
department as. an assistant
lacrosse coach.

Long, 27, will work with new
head coach Dennis Daly to
diréct the Generals’ program.

A native of Rochester, New
York, Long comes to W&L after
serving one year as graduate
assistant lacrosse and soccer
coach at Alfred University in
upstate New York, where he
received his Master’s degree in
education.

He earned USILA All-
America honors in 1975, 1976

_ and 1977 as a record-setting
attack-man at Navy, where he
received his undergraduate
degree in political science. He
was first-team All-America as a
senior in 1977 when he scored 22
goals and handed out a school
record 53 assists.

In addition to the single-
season assist record Long holds
Navy marks for career assists
(149), career points (233), and
most assists in one game (nine

vs. Hofstra in 1976).

He played in the 1977 North-
South All-Star Game and on the
U.S. team in the 1978 World
Games.

O’Connel promoted

Chuck O’Connell, a member
of the Washington and Lee
athletic department coaching
staff since 1973, has been pro-
moted to assistant athletic
director with responsibility fur
the department’s financial mat-
ters.

“The fine administrative
skills Chuck demonstrated dur-
ing his coaching tenure made
him the natural candidate for
this position,’ stated W&L
Director of Athletics Bill
McHenry, who announced the
promotion on Sept. 1. ‘We have
full confidence he will handle
his new responsibilities effec-
tively and accurately.”

O’Connell, who will continue
as an assistant football coach
and assistant professor of
physical education, takes the
new reins from Jack Emmer,
who in July resigned to become
head lacrosse coach and assis-
tant athletic director at Army.
An eleven-year member of the

W&L department, Emmer had
been assistant athletic director
since 1978.

O’Connell joined the W&L
staff in the summer of 1973 as
offensive line coach for the foot-
ball team, He switched to de-
fense beginning with the 1975
season and became defensive
coordinator in 1978. He was also
an assistant lacrosse coach for
the 1974 through 1983 seasons.

Washington and Lee graduate
Robert S. Newcomb of
Barnardsville, N.J., has return-
ed to the University to serve as
a graduate assistant coach for
the swimming and water polo
teams.

He joins fifth-year aquatics
director Page Remillard, who
coached him during his senior
year.

Newcomb, who holds a 1980
degree in natural science, earn-
ed four W&L letters in swim-
ming and three in water polo.
As a senior he won All-Southern
League water polo honors, serv-
ed as swim team captain, and

...1f I’m not mistaken it’s that
time of year again when the
leaves begin to change colors
and the aroma of cocaine is in
the air. Yes’ that’s right it’s
time for the National Football
League (with an “‘N,”’ as oppos-
ed to ‘‘U.S.”’) A drug problem in
the NFL? Well, at least now we
know why the big boys keep
holding out for the money. Ac-
tually, I’m rather nauseated by
the ‘‘Athletes are people, too’
excuse. That only goes so far.
No amount of stress justifies
drug use. What’s more, the
damage to the NFL caused by
this problem has for all intents
and purposes gone by uncheck-
ed. Sure, there will be fines and
suspensions, but after rehabili-
tation many offenders will be
back. I’d like to believe the
athlete had earned the right to
be put on a pedestal and
respected. But these involved in
the drug scandal have forfeited
that right and it’s not something
they deserve to reclaim...

...Now, on to some more good
news. Speaking of the summer
there were two stories worth a
second look. First, in late June
we learned of a problem in the
tennis world as Guillermo Vilas
was charged with accepting a
guaranteed sum of money for
appearing in a tennis tourna-
ment. The case has yet to be
resolved, and whatever deci-
sion is reached, no one will be
satisfied. However, the point is
that everyone in men’s tennis
freely admits to the existence of
guarantees in the game. Given,
they are not necessary. On the
other hand,.we are dealing with
professionals, people whose
livelihood is this sport. Why not
try to make as much as you are
worth? Also, it would seem that
the “guarantee” is actually a
reward in that only those whose
appearance in the tournament
would be beneficial to the tour-
nament are paid guarantees.
Therefore, are these ‘‘guaran-
tees’ much different than
bonuses paid to football and
baseball players? Think about
it...

...The other topic of interest
of the summer of ’83 was, of
course, the use of anabolic
steroids. Are 80 percent of the
world’s athletes so stupid? Very

em Drugs ‘R’ Us

sad and, unfortunately, very
true. The people who use these
drugs, which aid in muscle
development, deserve no mer-
cy. The reason? These kinds of
drugs irreparably tarnish any
athletic contest because they
remove the essential element of
fairness by lending an unfair, as
well as unchallengeable, advan-
tage to the user. I always say
athletic contests are pure tests
of relative athletic skill.
Steroids and the like cause me
to wonder if they will ever be
that again...
CEC RREMET Ne

Time out...

...Our Prognosticator of Plen-
ty from that splotch on the con-
tinent of North America has re-
turned, lauding his forecasting
prowess. Yes, the Prince of
Jersey is back. The royal word
is thus: ‘‘Too early for NFL
predictions, you’ll have to wait
a week. I’ll remind you that my
baseball predictions (White
Sox, Brewers, Dodgers, and Ex-
pos) are (for the most part)
bearing out — and my rookie
phenom pick, Ron Kittle, has 32
homers...’”’ Ever since he pick-
ed the Derby winner, we
haven’t been able to calm him
down...

..Turning to the Colonnade
and W&L’s fall lineup, I see
some pretty favorable seasons.
Water polo under head man
Page Remillard is stacked once
again and should be able to
make up last year’s “nine
seconds” with time to spare.
Another conference title is
there for the asking for Coach
Dick Miller’s strong harriers.
And if soccer boss Rolf Piranian

Grades

about how it would be im-
plemented.

The newly-adopted plus/
minus system was suggested
last year because, he said, ‘If
the faculty wanted a proposal,
this was the best and most ap-
propriate one.”’

According to Dean Watt, the
principal argument for moving
to plus/minus was that it offers
13 categories for grades instead
of just five.

‘Many faculty members
were concerned that there were
more levels of accomplishment
than available grades,’’ he said.
“They wanted to be able to be
more precise.

“The B and C categories
especially were thought to be
too broad, but they were willing
to expand the greater distinc-
tion to A and D as well.”’

Dean John concurred: ‘The
belief was that letter grades are
too gross measures of achieve-
ment. Grading is such a subjec-

tive thing anyway.”
Under the new system, a
“plus” and ‘‘minus’’ differen-

tiation is available for each let-
ter grade except F. The
numerical equivalent on a 4.00
scale is found by simply adding
.33 to or subtracting .33 from the
figure for the straight letter
grade.

One of the most controversial
aspects of the new system is
that it makes an A-plus, or 4.33,
grade available, where 4.00 was
previously the highest possible
grade.

Dean Watt says this was done
for reasons of symmetry: “If
you have an A-minus, you must
have an A-plus.”’

Also, the Committee on

Courses and Degrees proposal
to the faculty stated that an A-
plus, or 4.33, grading system is
recognized by the Law School
Data Assembly Service
(LSDAS), meaning that some
students could be at a com-
parative disadvantage under
the straight letter scheme.

It is this part of the new
grading procedure that causes
Bennett L. Ross (’83), president
of the student body last year, to
offer the assessment that ‘“‘my
personal feeling is that plus/
minus will slightly hurt grades
overall.

“I don’t personally know
many students who get
A-plus’. Most of your A’s are go-
ing to be A-minuses.”’

Col. Harold Head, University
Registrar, said that while last
year there were three gradu-
ating seniors with 4.00 averages
he doubts there will be any 4.33
final averages.

Head says that from his point
of view, implementation of the
system shouldn’t present any
complications. He foresees only
one potential difficulty, the en-
try of grades into the computer
by the Registrar’s office.

“Any time you have a
mechanical operation and you
add one more step — the
pushing of the plus mark or
minus mark key — you have
another chance to make a
human error, but I don’t see
that that should be a problem.”’

There appears to be no con-
sensus as to the significance
plus/minus will have in overall
averages, but a number of pro-
fessors agree with Dean John,
who said, ‘‘Most of the studies
I've seen show that overall

McDonald to
help hoops

Timothy R. McDonald, a
native of Bristol, Pa., and a 1979
graduate of West Chester
University, will join the
Washington and Lee University
athletic staff Sept. 1 as an assis-
tant basketball coach.

McDonald, 26, comes to the
Generals’ program following
four years as a Pennsylvania
high school coach and teacher.
During the 1979-80 school year

 

he was women’s basketball
coach and physical education
instructor at New Hope-
Solebury High in Hew Hope.
The past three years he has
been assistant men’s basketball
coach and physical education
teacher at his alma mater,
Neshaminy High School in
Langhorne.

“Tim appears to have the
tools to be a quality college
coach,” said W&L head coach
Verne Canfield. ‘We look for-
ward to his input and contribu-
tions, especially to our inside
game where we will need in-
tense instruction and develop-
ment to prepare for the coming
season.”’

McDonald holds his bache-
lor’s degree in health and
physical education from West
Chester, where he played two
years of basketball and served
in the student government.

 

 

 

there isn’t much change.”

There is some disagreement
about the validity of determin-
ing the effect statistically by
looking at overall averages.
Some, like Col. Head, say that
because of other potential in-
terfering factors, it won’t be
possible to state the exact effect
of the plus/minus grading.

any large change in the univer-
sity’s overall grade point
average can be directly at-
tributed to plus/minus.

“The statistics on the
students who are coming and

those who are leaving are

basically the same,’ he said
Ring-tum Phi calculations us-

ing data supplied by the Regis-

‘It may lead to a slight grade inflation

deviation of the mean. In this in-
stance, that would be a fluctua-
tion of .04 in either direction.
There is, however, only one
chance in 20 that the GPA would
vary by as much as two stand-

ard deviations, or .08. That is,
such a large change would oc-
cur randomly only one year out

or a slight grade

deflation, but you'll never really know. All that you'd

be able to do is take a guess.’

“Tt may lead to a slight grade
inflation or a slight grade defla-
tion,” he said, ‘‘but you’ll never
really know. All that you’d be
able to do is take a guess.”’

Dean John also doubts that it
will be possible to state the ef-
fect with any degree of preci-
sion, but says that the change in
the average should give you ‘‘a
rough idea.”

Dean Watt, however, said
that since ‘‘the student body is
always more or less the same,”’

trar show that over the last ten
years, the university GPA has
had a standard deviation (a
statistical measure of varia-
tion) of .04 from a mean, or
average, of 2.6807.

William Buchanan, head of
the W&L politics department
and author of “Understanding
Political Variables,” explains
that statistical theory tells us
that there are two chances in
three that the GPA next year
will fall within one standard

of twenty. Buchanan says that
the odds of the figure varying
by three standard deviations, or
.12, are roughly one in 100.

“If the average varies by
more than one standard devia-
tion, then we’ll know this seems
to be having an effect. You will
be able to say, ‘This is so
unusual that it must be due to
plus/minus grading...

“That would be almost ab-
solutely certain.”
