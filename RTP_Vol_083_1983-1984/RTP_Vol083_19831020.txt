New elections held

Caruthers wins frosh EC slot

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Mac McGrew, Rob Tolleson,
Andrew Caruthers, and Glen
Brock all emerged victorious
from the freshman class elec-
tions held during the past two
weeks.

In a drawn-out election, a se-
cond poll was needed after the
first poll held on Oct. 10. was cut
short and had to be thrown out
because the ballot box was left
unattended during the day.
Voting Regulations Board
Chairman Burns Newsome and
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein discussed
the problem that evening of the
election and the committee
determined the necessity of a
second election to be held
Thursday, Oct. 13.

McGrew, the new class presi-
dent, was the only one who
received a majority of votes in
the second poll. He tallied 130
votes, compared to Jim Bar-
ker’s 51 and Charles Bracken’s
32. All of the other races were
forced to go into run-offs, which

were held Monday.

In the run-offs, Tolleson, a
high school classmate of
McGrew’s, defeated Alex
Bryant by a vote of 117-90 in the
vice-presidential race, while
Brock overcame Chris Carter
by a 47-vote margin in the
University Council elections.

The Executive Committee
field was cut from its original
nine candidates to Caruthers
and Paul Clark, with Caruthers
gaining 136 votes to Clark’s 73.

The drawn-out election raised
the importance of the issue of
getting people to man the polls,
a question discussed at last
Monday evening’s EC meeting.
“‘We have a problem of getting
people to watch the polls. I think
some changes need to be
made,’’ Newsome said.

One suggestion made at the.
meeting was to charge each
candidate a small fee which
would be used to pay the stu-
dents watching the polls. Some
students felt that because of the
honor system, it is unecessary
to man the polls.

Current state law requires a

person to be 19 in order to con-
sume beer and to be 21 to arink
other forms of alcohol.

“Keep high school kids out of
your parties — that’s the big-
gest problem I see,” special
agent Clarence W. Roberts of
the Charlottesville office of the
ABC Board told the group.

“The point is that you’ve got
to check I.D.’s,” he said.
“That’s going to make you or
break you.”’

Many of the regulations ex-
plained by Roberts are complex
and subject to interpretation.
Both he and Chief Sutton stress-
ed that a solid attempt by the
fraternities to comply with the
letter of the law is what agents
are looking for.

“Your good faith effort
means more than anything
else,” Roberts said.

‘Ninety-nine percent of the
ABC agents you deal with are
going to help you and explain
these laws. ABC agents are not,
as some of you may think, dic-
tators. They are public ser-
vants.”’

Chief Sutton sounded a
similar note in his remarks to
the group. “I do advocate stu-
dent control as much as possi-
ble,”’ he said. ‘‘The more you
do, the less I have to do.

He praised the fraternities for
the cooperation they showed his
department during Rush.

fraternities to become retail
outlets of alcoholic beverages,”’
Roberts said.

“There are other businesses
licensed for that function. They
pay much more taxes than
you’ll ever pay. They should
have exclusive control of
alcoholic beverages in your
area.”’

The ‘‘no sales’ provision is
very strictly enforced. A soft
drink vending machine, for ex-
ample, must be made non-
operational during a party.

“Get it out of there, because
it’s going to get you in trouble,”
Roberts said.

Chief Sutton suggested that

agents may gain access to par-
ties.

“They merely have to give
you the opportunity to do what
you would normally do. If they
say they were invited by friends
or that they are someone’s date,
and you invite them in, they are
then your guest, and are free to
act on any violation they see.”

“Regardless of what ruse is
used, any open door is an invita-
tion,” he continues. ‘‘It is not a
crime to assume an identity. If I
hide my identity, that does not
encourage you to commit a
crime.”

Timerman rescheduled

A lecture by author Jacobo
Timerman originally scheduled
for tonight at Washington and
Lee has been postponed and
rescheduled for Thursday, Nov.
¢.

Timerman’s lecture is the
first presentation of the univer-
sity’s speaker symposium, Con-
tact ’84.

According to Contact co-
chairman Marty Harmon,
Timerman’s agent explained
that Timerman is suffering
from physical ailments which
have resulted from his torture
in Argentina.

The program will begin at 8

p.m. in Lee Chapel. The public
is invited to attend, and admis-
sion is free.

A journalist, author, and pas-
sionate advocate for human
rights and social justice, Timer-
man will discuss his imprison-
ment in Argentina and the
political climate in Latin
America.

He is the author of the 1981
volume ‘Prisoner. Without a
Name, Cell Without a
Number.”

Timerman’s life in Argentina
was the subject of a movie on
NBC-TV last spring.

 

 
Page 2, The Ring-tum Phi, October 20, 1983

This year’s freshman class elections had to be held
twice because in the first vote, one poll was left unat-
tended.

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting,
Voting Regulations Board Chairman Burns Newsome
complained to the Committee that there was a lack of
incentive for students to man the polls. _

Sophomore representative James White suggested
paying students to man the polls and received the
backing of President Bob Jenevein. The money to pay
the students would come from an assessment col-
lected from each candidate.

Undoubtedly the polls must be manned. The
presence of an Honor System does not ensure that
dishonorable acts will not occur.

There are many possibilities for solving this pro-
blem — some easier than others — which the Commit-
tee must evaluate.

But the Committee should not presume that respon-
sibility may be bought.

A social pavilion

The question of a student pavilion has been the sub-
ject of discussion at W&L for almost two years now.
Last fall a grain party at Zollman’s Pavilion was shut
down by the ABC and since then, other groups have
been hesitant to hold parties there. This year the new
drinking law has tightened the ABC control even
more. There seems to be no question that a new, more
convenient structure is imperative.

The more pertinent question then has boiled down
to the dimensions and intended use of the structure.
Should it be a building adequate to house large parties
or a small concert? Or should it be more of an indoor
arena large enough to house about three tennis
courts?

While the need for such an arena may be quite
realistic, it seems that a more centrally located social
gathering place is more pressing. A_ pavilion
specifically designed for social events, which is what
an EC subcommittee advocated last year, would
serve as useful in keeping students out of the ABC
threat as well as providing a place where all students

— independents and fraterntiy members — could .

mingle and have a good time.

Although the Board of Trustees vote is likely to be
put off until Febuary, we hope that in the interim an
appointed committee is able to find a satisfactory
solution that will appease both factions.

To the Editors:

To many people at Washing-
ton and Lee, the Honor System
is much more than simply not
lying, cheating, or stealing. It is
a way of life both on and off
campus. Everyone knows the

Honor System has been abused
again and again, but the case of
William Dederick is truly
outrageous. The line between
honor and dishonor must be
drawn somewhere. Charlie

Mature resopnse needed

To the Editors:

Like most of my colleagues, I
am opposed to coeducation at
Washington and Lee. I also
agree that we must step out and
be vocal in our opposition. But I
also feel that we must be re-
sponsible and mature in our re-
sistance.

One of the slogans or “battle
cries” I’ve heard on campus
lately is “Women in the hay, but
not every day.” While this may
reflect the opinions of some, or
even most of the student body, it
is also playing right into the

hands of the proponents of
coeducation.

One of ‘‘their’ leading
arguments is that an all-male
atmosphere breeds a “sexist
and chauvinistic” attitude, one
in which the students develop a
“‘warped’’ attitude toward
male-female relationships.

We have many fine argu-
ments in our favor, all of which
you have heard before. We must
present them in a way that
substantiates and perpetuates
that of our opposition,

Committee and the Student Af-
fairs Committee have done
W&L a great disservice by
allowing this convicted felon to
remain a part of the university
community. The Executive
Committee should take notice!
Perhaps this is asking too
much of the Executive Commit-
tee. Bob Jenevein and Co.
publicized their own fear of
responsibility in Jenevein’s let-
ter to the editors (Ring-tum
Phi, Oct. 13). In his unpubliciz-
ed and ‘informal’ poll, Jene-
vein says “‘We got what we
wanted.”’ What is the EC afraid
of? They are afraid that their
arguments against coeducation
would not withstand criticism.
Bob Jenevein and the EC should
take steps to organize a respon-
sible and proper referendum as
suggested by Mr. N.P. White-
head in the same issue.
Coeducation is probably the
single most controversial issue

ever to hit campus. It has ex-

Cadle stirs independent voices

To the Editors:

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank Joseph Cadle for
his article which appeared in
the Phi last week. Mr. Cadle, I
would like to thank you for
poignantly expressing your
feelings, my feelings, and the
fleeings of a good number of
other independents here at
W&L.

Recent editions of the Phi
have discussed the ‘“‘glamour’’
of Rush, President Wilson’s
concern about the fraternities,
President Wilson’s meeting
with the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, an alumni committee which
is reviewing the fraternities,
and the results of the most re-
cent Rush reports.

What about the independ-
ents?

The independents’ who make
up approximately 40 percent of
W&L’s student body, deserve as
much attention as the frater-
nities. It is only fair that the
alumni should review indepen-
dent life. Further, President
Wilson should be concerned

with independent life and ways
of improving it.

It is about time that Mr. Cadle
and all independents stand up
for their rights as independents.
Independents are constantly
getting neglected by the W&L
community. I urge any and all
independents to speak up and be

counted. Let President Wilson,
the deans, the faculty and the
alumni know how you feel. Also,
I urge you to ask the ad-
ministration to begin taking ef-
fective measures to improve
social life for independents.

Don’t forget women’s deeds

To the Editors:

According to Mr. Jenevein,
many students at W&L “ques-
tion the ability of a woman to
react enthusiastically to the in-
spiration of Robert E. Lee,” I
suggest to all those men a crash
course in Women’s History.
They might try, before coming
to this conclusion, looking at the
work done by Harriet Beecher
Stowe, Abigail Adams, Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton, Susan B. An-
thony, Jane Addams, Charlotte
Perkins Gilman, Virginia
Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir,
Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret
Mead, Indira Gandhi, Shirley
Chisholm, Coretta Scott King,

Barbara Jordan or Golda Meir,
plus countless others. I might
also add that a little investiga-
tion into the values held by
Robert E. Lee himself might
suggest that he was more will-
ing to accept and encourage
change than they are.

So much for the easy life I
praised three weeks back. The
threat to the university requires
all our action. It really does.

Oh. Before I start; I’m not go-
ing to talk about the frater-
nities. Mr. Wilson, with more
haste than judgment, has linked
their problems to the coeduca-
tion issue. I won’t. I should say,
though, that, all their present
difficulties considered, I should
still shudder to imagine life at
the university without their in-
numerable positive contribu-
tions. Mr. Wilson may stay here
long enough to see that. His er-
ror proceeds from inexperience
and from ignorance.

Now, I have yet to see one
good argument for coeducation.
I have been scolded, preached
at, and damned by priests,
presidents, and professors. Not
one has been able to explain to
me why we ought to join the
race to the bandwagon of
‘progress.’

Some in the past have put
coeducation on the same level
as racial integration: they
claim it is a moral duty which
we simply must fulfill. This is of

course patent nonsense. There'
are no reasons to assume that
sex discrimination is a pressing
cause in education. Women are
in at Yale, Harvard, Columbia,
and Sewanee. One or both par-
ties may run one for vice presi-

dent in 1984. Of the three all-

My View

male civilian colleges in the
land, only ours is worth going
to. I fail to see our moral obliga-
tion to go coed; we’re hardly
depriving anyone, you see.
‘Aha,’ says the enemy, ‘If
women are now important in
the ‘real world’? we should
learn to deal with them in col-
lege, just to be prepared.’ True
enough; but why go about it by
coeducation? A liberal educa-
tion should suffice. Through it
we join the great fraternity of
the learned, its members not
separated by time, by culture,
tongue, or race; nor by sex, nor
Death itself. We walk in the
mind with Plato and Dante and
Dr. Johnson; and Dame Julien
of Norwich, Jane Austen, and

 

Opinion

the Bronte sisters. We under-
stand women, as we understand
figures more distant, Roman
essayists and Chinese poets,
through the mind. What can
coeducation add to that? All we
need are willing teachers, will-
ing students.

‘That’s just it,’ says the
enemy. ‘Look at the demo-
graphics. Unless we go coed, we
either have to take fewer
students — not enough to keep
operating — or we have to lower
our standards of quality.’ Now,
this is a very popular argument.
Mr. Wilson, prompted no doubt
by the power behind the throne,
Bill Hartog, is very fond of it.
Unfortunately, it is a very poor
argument. First, it doesn’t take
enough account of the fact that
not all schools compete for the
same student pool. Not just
everyone is right for us, or we
for them. But the worst is this:
the false meaning given to the
word ‘quality.’ By ‘quality, the
coed conspiracy really means
‘board scores.’ I said last time
that there’s more to life than
board scores. No education is
worthy of the name if it creates
squibs who test well, but have

no feeling for sunsets, poetry,

and the right fork. We can look
more carefully at writing
samples. We can listen to the

Alumni Admissions folk more
openly. We can, as Dr. Delos
Hughes suggests, let prospec-
tives design their own applica-
tions. But let’s do something
more than scout for standardiz-
ed people; for those make but
poor scholars. They are in-
capable of inspiration. And
whatever we do, let us have
some intellectual honesty from
Washington Hall.

For you see, there is a
positive argument against
coeducation. Cardinal Newman
knew it: knew that the universi-
ty is a mill for the manufacture
of gentlemen. And no one can be
a scholar without being a gen-
tleman; without that fine sense
of intellectual honor which will
not permit one to plagiarize, to
falsify data, to fake ex-
periments. And in our case, the
manufacturing of gentlemen
will cease when we become a
coed institution. Not because
women cannot be honorable; let
no one suggest that. But
because for us to remake
ourselves would be too costly.

Every parish, regiment, and

school has a_ particular
character: a function of its
past, its nature (the two are
one). Ours is eminently suited
to mold gentlemen. For as
thinkers since Aristotle have
known, until by education the
mind is argued into virtue, the
habit of goodness must be in-
culcated by upbringing. We do
that here by the Honor System.
Its only real claim on our obe-
dience is its antiquity and our
reverence for that: no mere
fear of punishment will suffice
to deter the wicked. Yet if we
can be false to ourself in one
way, what argument do we
make to the next call for ‘enter-
ing the 20th Century’? And what
sort of folk will we get, these
prospectives who got away, but
who would come as long as we
don’t ask them to develop them-
selves, who will graciously con-
descend to come here if we are
false to our past? It is not to be
thought of; it would be the ruin
forever of our university. Let
open the door to one so funda-
mental a change, and nothing
can stop the tide.

Coeducation is, simply,
suicide. I move we come in off
the ledge.

 

By PROFESSOR JOHN C. WINFREY

Question: What impact will our large federal
deficits have on the prospect for continued
economic recovery?

Economists of all persuasions agree that the size
of our deficits and the debt has created special pro-
blems for a sustained recovery. The basic problem
is that financing the debt creates demand for
loanable funds. At the same time the recovery will
eventually encourage firms to demand those same

capital investment. Increased economic activity
also requires a greater portion of the money supply
to carry on the increase in day-to-day business
transactions. With a stable money supply these in-
fluences ordinarily make for higher interest rates
during recovery. But under our special cir-
cumstances it is feared that the size of the current
deficits and debt will add so much to these demands
for money that the resultant interest rates will in-
hibit investment and consumption and thus stall the
recovery.

The explanation of why the deficits are so large
rests on the particular mix of monetary and fiscal
policies which created the recession. The fiscal
policies of the Reagan administration were fashion-
ed on the “supply sider’’ theories which held that in-
flation could be reduced without creating large
unemployment. The solution was to increase ag-
gregate supply by deregulation and special incen-
tives to save. It was assumed that savings would im-
mediately be transformed into investment which
would in turn increase productivity and aggregate
supply. Most economists disagreed with this predic-
tion. The great majority, whom I will term ‘‘neo-
Keynesians,” argued that in a recession firms run-
ning at reduced capacity can hardly be expected to
invest in new plant and equipment. A smaller but

 

funds in order to expand inventories and real

Recovery will halt if Fed
tightens money supply

more influential group the ‘‘monetarists’’ believed
that the only cure for inflation was strict controls
over the money supply.

According to some economists the supply-sider
policies have clearly failed since investment has not
been forthcoming as promised and unemployment
has been severe. However, the recession cannot be
blamed entirely on the fiscal policy of the supply-
siders. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve
led by Paul Volcker, a monetarist, has kept interest
rates high and curtailed both consumer and invest-
ment spending.

To a large extent the large deficits have been an
automatic result of the recession as revenues have
fallen and income-security expenditures increased.
But the various “‘supply-sider’’ incentives and tax
reductions which have reduced both consumer
spending and federal revenues without any compen-
satory increase in investment have certainly ex-
acerbated the deficit problem.

The prospects for continued recovery depend im-
portantly on the Federal Reserve. Even the neo-
Keynesians (who have in the past been accused of
claiming that ‘‘money doesn’t matter’’)

acknowledge that in the current situation a tight 3

monetary policy could be especially damaging. A
‘“‘worst scenario’’ pictures pricesrising slightly in
response to the drought’s effect on food prices, the
Iraq-Iran war raising oil prices, or some combina-
tion of factors and the Fed over-reacting and again
severely tightening the money supply. Economists,
except for the very pure of the monetarists, general-
ly agree that with the increased demand for money
by consumers, businesses and the financiers of the
federal debt, the recovery could well be stifled if a
tight money supply raises interest rates and cur-

tails the availability of funds for consumption and...

investment.

EC supports new pavilion

 

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

An on-campus pavilion
costing about $250,000 received
unanimous support from the
Executive Committee on Mon-
day night.

The Student Activities Board
with the help of the Buildings
and Grounds Department has
drawn up plans for a structure,
according to treasurer, John
Haywood. An additional plan
has been drawn up by the W&L
Athletic Department detailing
its ideas for the facility,
Haywood said.

The plan supported by the EC
would include a pavilion four
times the size of Zollman’s
Pavilion, a parking lot and a
picnic area. The other proposal,
which would cost $1 million,
would be a multi-purpose struc-
ture, about 16 times the size of
Zollman’s, that ‘‘would not be

compatible with a social at-
mosphere,’’ Haywood said.

If the second plan were ap-
proved by the Board, the
university would pay for the
structure. The student body,
though, would be required to
pay for the first plan. —

Under an arrangement with

University Treasurer Stewart
Epley, the student body would
borrow the money from the

school at a nine percent interest
rate over a 15 to 20 year period.
Student taxes would be increas-
ed $15 to cover the loan.

“The problem we're facing
now is whether the Board is go-
ing to consider either pro-
posal,’”’ Haywood said. ‘We
have no facility, essentially, to
hold SAB functions in.”

He added that Evans Dining
Hall is available only once a
semester and is too small and
that the Warner Center is usual-

A

ly only available for Fancy
Dress.

The SAB’s proposed structure
probably would not be able to
accomodate athletic practices
in the case of bad weather.
Should the Board approve the
SAB’s proposal, Burford Smith
said, ‘“‘A very clear delineation
has to be made as to who has
priority usage of it.”’

A discussion regarding the
paying of students to watch the
polls during class and student
body elections was tabled until
next Monday. Burns Newsome,
chairman of the Voting Regula-
tions Board, told the EC he had
problems getting students to
man the polls during last week’s
freshman class elections.

James White, sophomore
class rep, proposed that the EC
pay students to watch the polls.
The money would come from a
$5 charge imposed on all can-
didates.

“We need some kind of incen-
tive to get people out there,”’
White said. ‘The polls, I think,
haved to be manned.”’

EC President Bob Jenevein
agreed. ‘‘We have really limped
through many elections in the
past. There’s no _ incentive,
there’s no reason, besides some
intangible concerns, for any-
body to watch the polls,” he

 

 

SAB, Athletic Dept.
disagree over Pavilion

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Although the Board of
Trustees is expected to hear a
proposal for a student pavilion
this weekend, it is not likely that
the board will vote on the issue
because of differences between
the Student Activities Board
and the athletic department on
the intended use of the facility.

While the need for a pavilion
is mutually agreed upon by both
groups, the SAB is lobbying for
a building of about the size of
the Warner Center and the ath-

letic department is supporting a

building of two to three times
that size which can be used for
indoor athletic practices.

Because of the differences
between the two groups on the
building, the board could
possibly table the subject until
its Febuary meeting and have a
student-administration com-
mittee study the various op-
tions, according to Frank Par-

The proposal the SAB will
present to the trustees this

pose,’ Athletic Director Bill
McHenry said.

McHenry added that the
athletic department has also

submitted its proposal for the

facility.

“Neither one of us is going to
get this facility without the
other,’’ said Dick Miller, assis-
tant athletic director.

“‘We’re not trying to build a
Cameron Hall,’’ he said.
“Neither one of us may get all
we want.”

Haywood said that one
answer to the dilemma may be
the construction of two separate
facilities.

“You just can’t take care of
every need on campus with just
one building,” Haywood said.

Parsons said that a Febuary
decision by the board on the
issue would be ‘‘timely’’
because it will make several
other fiscal decisions at that
meeting.

He stressed the need to give
more time to studying the op-
tions.
“You just don’t address the
question of a pavilion in a
vacuum,” he said.

He explained that subjects
such as ABC control of the
facility, parking, access and its
location in relation to academic
buildings are all factors that
must be considered in the deci-
sion.

Adams calls incumbent ’ ‘ineffective’

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

James T. Adams, who refers
to himself as ‘‘the fourth can-
didate” in the race for Com-
monwealth’s Attorney, says
that the incumbent is ‘‘ineffec-
tive’ and ‘‘totally insensitive”’
and that his other two op-
ponents “simply do not have the
experience or background to
handle the office.”

Adams, a lawyer since 1958
who began practicing in Lex-
ington in 1969 and was previous-
ly the Commonwealth’s At-
torney for Buena Vista, said on
the eve of a debate sponsored by
the League of Women Voters
that he had ‘‘no confidence at

 

te

all’ that he would be elected on
Nov. 8.

“I think (the voters) will go
with a Washington and Lee
graduate,’ Adams said in his
office on Washington Street.
“They’re into the social
thing...that’s all (the voters)
need to know.”

Incumbent John Read grad-
uated from V.M.I. in 1965 and
W&L Law in 1971; Democrat
Larry Mann is a 1970 W&L
graduate; and independent
Robert N. Joyce Jr. graduated
from W&L Law in 1981.

“I’ve never been a part of the
cocktail party and country club
set,” said Adams, who admits
being ‘“‘abrasive.”’

“IT tweak them every chance I

get. It’s just a foible... I have a
weird sense of humor. It keeps
me in trouble all the time.”’

Adams charges that his op-
ponents’ ‘‘ready-made contacts
in the academic community”’
could result in a bias as they ex-
ecuted their duties as the pro-
secutor for Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

“In the administration of
criminal justice, we need to be
as equitable and impartial as
we can be,” he said. He added
that the ‘‘country club, buddy-
buddy”’ atmosphere does not
contribute to that.

Adams, who answers his
business telephone, ‘‘Yes?,’’ is
running as an independent and
was the last to enter the field.

“I was waiting for somebody
who had strong credentials who
had the ability to make changes
in the system’”’ he said. ‘‘What I
get is these two young men
—splendid chaps, I’m sure —
who don’t have the experience
to step into the office and get the
changes effected.”’

“Forgive my immodesty, but
I would go in there and
straighten that mess out quick-
ly... In two weeks, I’d do things
that should have been done
eight years ago.’’

If Gordon Saunders, the
Assistant Commonwealth’s At-
torney, had run, Adams said he
“would have stayed out of it.’’

He continued, ‘‘We can’t lose
the fairness of this criminal

legal system. This is what keeps
the country together, no matter
how bad a job people think we
do with it.”’

Adams has run a modest
campaign that has included two
newspaper advertisements and
hand-lettered posters.

“I don’t have any money,”’ he
said. “What I want to do is get
in there on the pure merits and
issues. If you ask people for

money, then they have strings.

“People have offered me
money which I’ve turned down.
It may seem idealistic, and in
never-never land, but I’d like to
see it happen.”’

Adams was not enthusiastic
about participating in last Tues-
day’s debate. “I believe the

Computer major probed

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The possibilities of a com-
puter science major and an
upgrading of computer science
courses at Washington and Lee
are being investigated by an
eight-man faculty committee
appointed by President John D.
Wilson in August.

The goals of the committee,
chaired by Dr. Thomas Imeson,
director of the computer center,
are to determine potential for a
major field (Bachelor of
Science) in computer science,

to identify computer science
courses to be offered to students
in other areas of the university
and to decide what equipment
and faculty would be necessary
to accomplish these objectives.
Imeson said the committee,
which will report to Wilson by
Jan. 1, is still gathering infor-
mation. In conjunction with
that, a consultant, Dr. Norman
Gibbs, chairman of the com-
puter science department at
Bowdoin College in Brunswick,
Maine, has been hired. Gibbs

tion is somewhat loaded,” he
said.

“In the past, the candidates
they weren’t enamored with
didn’t come off too well.” He at-
tributed this to ‘‘pointed, inane
questions from the floor.”

The League of Women Voters,
Adams believes, is partial to
Read. ‘For one thing, he’s a
member,” he said. ‘‘As far as I

“Almost an entire police

jurisdiction, if that wasn’t a
disaster of the first order, I
don’t know what would be.”’

quence of events was ‘‘absolute-
ly disgraceful. I think it was

ber of the League of Women
Voters they have.’’

The treasurer’s report for the
Rockbridge Area League of
Women Voters dated Sept. 13,
1983, shows that Read has a
“paid membership.”’

“I’m not enamored with the
whole damned thing, but I guess

I have to appear,”’ Adams said.

Adams charges that Mann
and Joyce are ‘‘totally incompe-
tent for the job.”

“I don’t think either of these
kids has ever tried a jury case,”’
he said. ‘They just don’t know
the territory. It’ll take them a
good many years to get there.”

The incumbent’s re-election
is far from assured, according
to Adams. “My feeling is that
he’s in trouble,” he said.

Adams said that Read should
have disqualified himself from
the race because of last year’s
police scandal.

“During his tenure in office,”
Adams said, ‘‘we had one of the
most devastating debacles in
the Commonwealth; gainsay,
the rest of the country.

treated lightly. Nobody in this
has taken responsibility for
those actions.”

“There were no officer con-
victions in any of those cases
where they did not confess,”
Adams said. “‘Those who took
advantage of their right not to
testify against themself re-
sulted in hung juries or were
found ‘not guilty.’ ”

Adams said all this happened
“after three or four years of
John vouching for and support-
ing these same officers in pro-
secuting people in this com-
munity. And they were only
finally accused following in-
vestigation after investigation,
with investigators investigating
the investigators.”

The number of cases Read
has pending in court also came
under criticism by Adams.
~ The Criminal Docket of the
Rockbridge Circuit Court for
the September 1983 term shows
93 cases still to be settled, with
file dates going back to Dec. 14,
1971.

Adams charges that Read
keeps the number of cases on
the docket high “‘to justify his
budget to Richmond” and ‘“‘to
create a dynasty over there.
John has allowed the number of
cases to build up over there, and
has systematically resisted any
efforts to thin them out.

“If you clean up the docket
and get his true cases out there,
anybody could try them with
both hands tied behind his back
with law books in them...

“We don’t have that much of
a crime problem in Lexington
and Rockbridge County. We
never have.”

Adams believes the number
of cases on the docket could be
cut by about 2/3 ‘‘with justice
still being served.”

Two houses punished for harassment

SAE fined, Fiji on soctal probation

By TIM McCUNE
Special to the Phi

Two W&L fraternities have
been punished for harassment
incidents with their neighboring
fraternities.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater-
nity has been fined $100 by the
Interfraternity Council after
breaking windows at the Kappa

Sigma house on three separate
occasions. ‘It was unnecessary
and we felt we had to put a stop
to it,’ said Bob Dees, Kappa
Sigma president.

The first window-breaking in-
cident took place at the end of
August, according to Dees. The
second occurred about two
weeks later and the third about
a week after that. After each

Emery Ellinger, IFC presi-

unusual. ‘‘Usually when. this

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention
Correspondent

Steven Lewis and Peter
Muller are working together as
co-chairmen of the Washington
and Lee 1984 Mock Democratic
Convention.

There is no doubt in their
minds of their purpose.

‘We would really like to
stress the idea of unity. We do
have direction,’”’ said Muller, a
senior from Greenwich, Conn.

These comments came in
light of the recent internal
reorganization of the quadren-
nial Mock Convention, which
seeks to correctly predict the
nominee of the political party
out of the White House.

Four weeks ago the Execu-
tive Committee rescinded the
appointment of Steve Matrazzo
as the tri-chairman of the Mock
Convention in charge of
political research. There will be
no replacement.

The resignations of Len
Howard, lower-South regional
coordinator, and John Hay-
wood, facilities chairman,
followed the EC’s ruling on
Matrazzo.

The political research that

must be accomplished to
nominate the right candidate
will now fall on both chairmen’s
shoulders. Muller also is
responsible for the overseeing
of the 50 state chairmen and
fundraising while Lewis, a
senior from New Orleans, La.,
heads up the administration end
of the convention and keeps
tabs on the steering committee.

The steering committee con-
sists of several law and
undergraduate students who
chair various subcommittees.

The chairmen explained that
Jack Dent, presently upper-
South regional coordinator, will
be removed from this position
and promoted to administrative
assistant in charge of the
political responsibilities.

“He (Dent) will not hold the
authority of Matrazzo — by his
choice and ours,”’ Lewis said.

The South will now be con-
solidated under one regional
coordinator who has yet to be
named.

Both students feel that the
restructuring period that began
with the EC’s firing of Matrazzo
will not have an adverse affect
on the convention. In fact, they
are encouraged by their new
organizati

ization.

“power has been con-
solidated and the structure has
been streamlined,’’ Muller said.

“The stress that could have
remained has been eliminated
and motivation is high,’’ Lewis
explained.

“‘Morale really hasn’t taken a
beating,’ Muller added. ‘‘The
stress that we've’ been
experiencing, especially in the
last few weeks, has been from
the outside not the inside.”’

With the convention schedul-
ed for May 11 and 12, 1984, time
is fleeting for the chairmen as
they work to put on one of the
grandest weekends held at
W&L, and many people in the
W&L community wonder how
this reorganization has affected
their timetable. Both Lewis and
Muller contend that the Mock
Convention is very much on
schedule.

Muller said that concerning
some facets of the convention
they are even ahead of schedule
as at this time in 1979 the date
was not even set for the 1980
convention.

Lewis mentioned how ‘they
have been told by the W&L ad-
ministration that they are
“eons ahead” of past conven-
tions.

“The overall orgainzation
and structure is set and moving
forward. We haven’t experienc-
ed a setback. We had to stop to
re-evaluate our structure but
we haven’t taken a step back by
any means,”’ Muller said.

The chairmen keep an eye on
the progress of the convention
by holding weekly meetings
with their top officers and
assistants. They also get
together with the entire steer-
ing committee every two weeks
and satisfy their long range ob-
jectives by meeting with all the
state chairmen once a month.

Lewis and Muller have con-
tracts between themselves with
target dates and _ respon-
sibilities so they can gauge their

own progress.

Muller, president of the W&L
hockey club and co-chairman of

tee, went to high school at Deer-
field Academy in Connecticut.
It is there that he got interested
in the idea of a mock convention
as he helped to organize the
Academy’s 1980 Republican
Mock Convention.

Lewis was also involved in
student government in high
school. He applied to W&L with
a keen interest in the Mock Con-

Reeves Center gains attention

Chapman emphasizes use by students

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“I want to emphasize that the
Reeves Center is for the stu-
dent’s use,’ says Ben Chap-
man, director of student pro-
jects for the Reeves Center.

The Reeves Center for
Research and Exhibition of
Porcelain and Paintings houses
the extensive collection of
ceramics and paintings given to
Washington and Lee University
in 1967 by Mr. and Mrs. Euchlin
D. Reeves of Providence, R.I.
Located at the north end of the
Colonade in what was originally
a faculty home, the center has
been renovated and enlarged to
house the Reeves collection.

“While it is primarily. a stu-
dent research and study center,
we are engaged in a lot of P.R.
for W&L,” Chapman said. that
public relations role has includ-
ed an article in the fall issue of
Southern Accents magazine,
group tours, a pottery sym-
posium and visits from high
school art classes.

“Last year we had a great
number of people come to Lex-
ington just to see the collec-
tion,” Chapman said. ‘“‘We’ve
had groups of up to 40 or 50 peo-

ple in here at one time.”

Students have been working
with and learning from the
Reeves collection since its ar-
rival at W&L. ‘Students work-
ing at Professor McDaniel’s ar-
cheologic dig at Liberty Hall
were the first to make use of the
collection,’ according to James
W. Whitehead, Director of the
Reeves Center and former
treasurer of Washington and
Lee.

These students compared

ceramic collecting by Mr. and
Mrs. Reeves. Reeves graduated
from Washington and Lee’s law
school in 1927 and married
Louise Herreshoff, a descend-
ant of John Brown of Pro-
vidence, R.I. in 1941. Mrs.
Reeves was a prolific painter
and her work, which is part of
the collection, was discovered
by accident.

tion arrived in Lexington, the
frames were cleaned off and
they discovered the beautiful
paintings underneath.” The
paintings were the subject of a
1976 one-woman show at the
Corcoran Gallery in Washing-
ton, D.C.

The major portion of the col-
lection is made up of pieces
from the major porcelain fac-
tories of England and Continen-
tal Europe, as well as mid-18th-
and early 19th-century Chinese
export porcelain. Chinese ex-
port porcelain was among the
ceramic wares designed and
manufactured specifically for
export to foreign countries, par-
ticularly Western Europe and
America. These pieces differed
substantially from domestically
manufactured porcelain, in that
the designs on the pieces were
copies of scenes of Western life
and culture provided the
Chinese artesians by traders.
“The political, social, economic
and religious scenes of the
period are all in the porcelain,”’
said Whitehead.

observe the current faculty and

The committee, meanwhile,
has surveyed faculty members
and department chairmen to
determine their needs in the
way of computer courses.

So far, according to Imeson,
the major point of discussion
among committee members
has been whether or not the
computer science major should
be part of the mathematics
department. However, Imeson
added, that is the last decision
the committee has to make.
They first must decide what
courses and staff is necessary.

Compared to other private
universities in the state,
Washington and Lee is “‘in a
very good position in terms of
equipment and has been for a
number of years,’’ Imeson said.
“But our course offerings, I
believe, leave a lot to be
desired.”

Washington and Lee’s math
department currently offers six
computer science courses.

The university plans a major
upgrading of the computer
system during the summer of
1985, Imeson said, including

Imeson said the university’s

Computer science does have a.

place in a liberal arts institution

think it fits in the same way as
accounting, as journalism or as
perhaps other academic
disciplines that already exist on

academic discipline on its own
two feet.

“In my mind, we would not
expect to turn out the same sort

As the prices of computers

Generals dumped by H-SC, 20-8

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball team’s ODAC champion-
ship hopes suffered a setback
last Saturday as the Generals
dropped a 20-8 decision to arch-
rival Hampden-Sydney.

Defense was the name of the
game as the Tigers held the
Generals’ offense to 192 total
yards and forced five turn-

overs. W&L crossed midfield

only three times and scored
their lone touchdown late in the
fourth quarter after the out-
come had already been decided.

and continue on its way toa fine
season,” head coach Gary
Fallon said.

Hampden-Sydney controlled

the first half, establishing a 13-0

half-time lead. The Tigers en-
joyed excellent field position
throughout the first two quar-
ters as a result of W&L turn-
overs.

“If our'defense hadn’t played
exceptionally well in the first
half, we could have been down
by more than 13-0 at half-time,”
Fallon said.

After a_ scoreless. third
quarter, W&L cut the deficit to
13-2 after cornerback Barry

Brian Sipe threw five interceptions

in the first three quarters Sunday, and

he’s making about $200,000 a year

“We are not going to let the
loss to Hampden-Sydney spoil

came off the bench to lead the.

Generals to their only ‘touch-
down. Thornton passed for 81
yards, including a 45-yarder to
Tom Wiser that put W&L at the
Tiger two yard-line. Tailback
Kevin Weaver, also a freshman,
covered the remaining ground,
scoring his third TD of the
season. The two-point attempt
failed, making the final score
20-8.

Quarterback Bobby Wilson
had a frustrating day, as he was
unable to complete any of his
eight attempts and threw four
interceptions.

“Bobby had the game you
hope you never get. But they
happen. Brian Sipe (Cleveland

Browns’ quarterback) threw
five interceptions in the first
three quarters Sunday, and he’s
making about $200,000 a year
more than Bobby,”’ Fallon said.
“I told him after the game just
to learn from it but not to dwell
on it. He’ll bounce back.”’

W&L travels to Sewanee,
Tenn., to take on the University
of the South this Saturday. The
Tigers are 4-2 on the year, while
the Generals’ record fell to 3-2
after last Saturday’s loss. Last
year, the Generals held a 20-7
before giving up two fourth
quarter touchdowns to lose,
21-20. Fallon believes that his
team will face a dangerous of-
fense at Sewanee.

“We expect the same sort of

explosive offense that Sewanee
demonstrated a year ago when
they came back against us,”
Fallon explained. ‘‘You never
have those people in the coffin.

And down there, I’m -not sure
there is a coffin — except the
one that visiting teams are
liable to step into.”’

In addition, Fallon believes
his team will rebound with a
strong performance this week.
“The game at Sewanee will be
an indication of what kind of
character and leadership we
have. The leadership and at-
titude have been superb all
season. I have no doubt that
they will continue,” Fallon said.

Then again, maybe not. Marcus

Ruggers a dedicated bunch

By PAUL CLARK
Special to the Phi

Are you looking for a sport
with the aggression of football
and the finesse of soccer? If so,
according to Spencer Dickin-
son, rugby should be your
game.

This year, with a diverse
club, Washington and Lee’s
Rugby team has improved dai-
ly. According to Dickinson, a
senior and four-year veteran of
the club, the team has made im-
mense improvement in the past
two years. In recent years in-
terest had dropped and as a

stress in the record is the ex-
perience the younger players
and the team as a whole has
gained.

One also must take into con-
sideration the status of rugby at
Washington and Lee as com-
pared to other schools. At W&L
rugby is a sport gaining respect
and participants, while at the
same time, the rugby clubs at
other schools are well establish-
ed and to a large part, entirely
funded by their respective
schools. Many of W&L’s op-
ponents have coaches and facil-
ities strictly for rugby, but the

result, the club has fallen on
hard times. But this year a
renewed interest in rugby has
been shown by the addition of
many enthusiastic freshmen
and law students.

Although the Club’s record at
press time was 1-3-1, Dickinson
says the important aspect to

and are self-coached by players
Herb Funsten and John Miller.
Travel expenses and Virginia
Rugby Union dues are defrayed
by contributions from the
school and the budget allocated
the club by the Executive Com-
mittee.

In the face of this economic
adversity, the club has still
managed to improve during the
first half of the season. The
team started off the season by
tying neighbor VMI. Then the
team participated in the Ed Lee
Cup tournament at Pocohontas
State Park in Richmond where
they lost two very close match-
es. In the next game W&L gave
Virginia Tech, its toughest op-
ponent of the season, a hard
game but came up short. How-
ever, the experience the team
gained from the first four mat-
ches enabled them to whip
U.Va. 15-3. The confidence gain-
ed from beating such a large
school as Virginia has given the
team high hopes for finishing
the season with a winning
record.

The team will put its ex-
perience on the line this
weekend against Longwood Col-
lege at Longwood, after which
they will play two more match-
es before culminating the
season at home against arch-
rival Hampden-Sydney on Nov.
12.

All fans are encouraged to
come to the remaining home
games against North Grounds
RFC on Nov. 5, and the H-SC
game the next weekend. In ad-
dition, says Dickinson, ‘‘any
student interested in doing a lit-
tle conditioning or learning
about the game as they play is
encouraged to join the team.”’

New SID named

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee has nam-
ed Mark Mandel, former Sports
Information Director at
Worcester Polytech Institute,
as its new SID after Ken Ries
left W&L in September.

Mandel, who according to
W&L News Services Director
Jeff Hanna was chosen from an
applicant pool of 35, will begin
work in the SID office in
November.

Hanna said Mandel was at-
tracted to W&L because it of-
fers him a better opportunity.

‘Washington and Lee has the
best Division III sports infor-
mation office in the country,”
Hanna said. ‘‘I’ll be surprised if
he (Mandel) is not really good,”
he said.

Mandel, who has been the SID
at WPI for five years, is
familiar with Division III
philosophy and has had the ad-
vantage of running his own pro-
gram there, Hanna said. Hav-

ing the necessary background
in dealing with athletes,
coaches and the media is ex-
tremely important, Hanna said.

Mandel, who has an under-
graduate and a Masters degree
from Syracuse University,
replaces Ken Ries who moved
on to become the SID at James
Madison University. Ries had
been SID since 1979.

“Ken was superb — that’s
why he got the job he did,”’ Han-
na said. Ries had won numerous
awards from the College Sports
Information Directors Associa-
tion for his press releases.
“There is no question,
everybody hates to see him
go...he did such a super job,”
stated Hanna. Ries replaces
Richard Murray at J.M.U. who
will, in turn, become the new
S.I1.D. at the University of
Virginia.

Since Ries’ departure, sports
news has been handled by Han-
na and W&L senior Marty
Bechtold.

ment’s sake. Gee, john, why not

the college football world,
another argument against bowl

Texas and Nebraska should be
able to meet in some sort of
championship, but given bowl

in different bowls. (Texas as

Soccer out of contention

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team dropped two away
games to strong opponents this
week, effectively ruining their
chances for NCAA and VISA
(Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Association) playoff berths, ac-
cording to head coach Rolf
Piranian.

The Generals lost to the Get-
tysburg Bullets on Saturday,
10, and to the Lynchburg
Hornets yesterday, 2-1.

“We're out of the picture.
We’re playing for pride now,”’
said Piranian. The Generals are
already out of the race for the
ODAC title.

The Generals opened the
scoring against Lynchburg ten
minutes into the game, as soph-
omore forward Bill Holmes got
his fourth goal of the season, ty-
ing senior co-captain Roland
Simon for the team goal scoring
lead. Simon, who scored a goal

in each of the first three games
of the season, has one goal in
the last six games. All four of
Holmes’ goals have come in the
last four games.

The Hornets scored their two
goals later in the first half, leav-
ing a 2-1 halftime and final
score.

The Hornets outshot the
Generals, 6-4, for the game.
Piranian cited his team’s poor
shooting and the flow of the
game for the low shot total.
“The game was pretty much
played at midfield,” said Pira-
nian.

The Generals played 82
scoreless minutes against a
physical Gettysburg team
before what Piranian called a
“dubious” handball call gave
the Bullets a penalty kick with
eight minutes left, which they
converted for the only goal of
the game.

The physical play of the
Bullets was a contributing fac-

tor in holding the Generals
scoreless for the first time this
season. ‘‘It got more and more
physical as the game went on,”
commented Piranian. ‘‘I got the
feeling that Gettysburg wanted
to play us that way.”

About the Bullets’ penalty
kick, Piranian noted, ‘‘There
were a couple of situations
where we felt they (the
referees) could have given us
penalty kicks.”

Piranian commended the
play of freshman midfielder
Ken Randby, who was named
Player of the Game. ‘‘He did a
super job defensively and offen-
sively,’’ said the eighth-year
coach.

“We know we've got the
talent out there,” said Piranian.
“We just have to take more
shots and get the job done.”’

The Generals have only one
game next week, a 2 p.m. match
Saturday with Hampden-
Sydney on Wilson Field.

Polo wins one at Invite

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team won one game
and lost three last weekend in
the Southeast Varsity Invita-
tional at Annapolis, Md. The
Generals collected a victory
against George Washington
University, but lost games to
Brown, Harvard and Bucknell.

Commenting on the Generals’
performance, assistant water
polo coach Bob Newcomb said,
“We played relatively poorly
against Brown.” Concerning
the Generals’ 6-5 loss to Har-
vard, Coach Newcomb said,
‘“‘Harvard was our best game.
We should have won. We led
most of the game.”’

He continued, ‘Nobody ex-
pected us to play that well ex-
cept us.”

According to Newcomb, W&L
displayed a very good counter
attack (the transition from of-
fense to defense), but they
made a lot of bad passes on of-

fense.

Kevin Kadesky, senior goalie,
had a very busy weekend.
Following an interview with the
University of Texas Medical
School on Friday, Kadesky
traveled to Annapolis for W&L’s
last two games of the tourna-
ment.

“Kevin Kadesky played
outstanding games. He played
extremely well,” said Coach
Newcomb.

Coach Newcomb also cited
freshman Dan Trice for playing
very good defense.

An important aspect of the
Generals’ participation in the
Southeast Varsity Invitational
is that W&L now has the oppor-
tunity to note any improvement
that they may have made since
they last played “‘top ten’ com-
petition. The Generals last en-
counter against “top ten’’ com-
petition was in the Northeast
Varsity Invitational at Brown
on Sept. 23, 24 and 25. Coach
Newcomb said, ‘We are play-
ing much better. We are not

making as many careless
mistakes as we used to and our
defense is much better.’’

. Newcomb, however, said, ‘““We

cannot generate any offense.”’

The Generals hope to gener-
ate a lot of offense this weekend
when they participate in the
Southern League Tournament
in Richmond, Va. The tourna-
ment will be played on Oct. 21,
22. and 23. W&L is scheduled to
play against Richmond,
Hampden-Sydney, Virginia
Commonwealth University and
the University of North
Carolina at Wilmington.

The W&L-Richmond game
will be the highlight of the
weekend. The Generals hope to
avenge an early season loss to
Richmond. According to Coach
Newcomb, Richmond is playing
good water polo. “The game
will be an indication of how
much we have improved since
the beginning of the season,’’
said Newcomb.

He concluded, ‘“‘It should be a
very good game.”’

McBryde paces harriers
to fifth place finish

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

This past weekend the
Washington and Lee harriers
competed in the Virginia State
Meet and placed fifth among 13
institutions. The Generals, run-
ning on their home course, fell
victim to an off day. Coach Dick
Miller commented, ‘‘We did not
run well and did not improve
our perfromances sufficiently
enough to win.’’ Although the
Generals ran without Paul
Chapman, Coach Miller said he
is not making any excuses.

Liberty Baptist and Radford
University placed first and se-
cond respectively in the meet.
These schools represented the
Division II powers in Virginia.

   

Christopher Newport College
and Roanoke College took the
laurels in Division III ahead of
W&L.

This week the Generals will
travel north to take on Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
foe, Bridgewater College, along
with West Virginia Tech and
Newport News Apprentice
School. The chances look good
for the Generals to improve on
their 7-1 record as W&L placed
ahead of Bridgewater this past
weekend.

Coach Miller noted, ‘‘We are
looking forward to the ODAC
meet in defending our title. Our
biggest challenge will probably
be Roanoke, but we are taking
one meet at a time.”’

cited much debate among the
students, faculty, and adminis-
tration. Unfortunately, most of
this debate has been very super-
ficial. Sexist slogans, such as,
‘Girls in the hay, but not every-
‘day,’’ can only aid those who
support coeducation. It is time
for W&L to meet the real world.
By suggesting that women may
be incapable of reacting to the
inspiration of Robert E. Lee,
Jenevein has stereotyped the
entire: undergraduate student
body as male chauvinists. The
jokes about male chauvinism
are fun until you realize that
they aren’t jokes anymore.

We are just fooling ourselves
if we say we must go coed be-
cause of financial reasons or ad-
missions. W&L has the re-
sources in its alumni organi-
zation and endowment to re-
main single sex and fiscally
secure. The millions that would
be spent on the renovation of the
university could be used to in-
crease the endowment. We can
make it through a few lean
years if we have to lower the
size of our undergraduate
classes. There is no reason to
consider lowering admissions
standards. The drop in applica-
tions need not be so drastic.
West of the Mississippi W&L is
almost. unknown. There are
thousands of prospective
students that never hear of
W&L. Scott Mason and Ian Ban-
well were incorrect in their
assessments of the coeducation
issue in last week’s Ring-tum
Phi. If we go coed, it must be for
the right reasons — ethical
reasons. Do women have the
right to attend one of the finest
— if not the finest — liberal arts
colleges in the nation?

The decision will be made by
the Board of Trustees next
Spring. It is worth asking if the
trustees are really in touch with
the university. With the excep-
tion of President Wilson, none
live in Lexington. They will pro-
bably be most influenced by
John Delane Wilson who has not
yet finished his freshman year
as President. :

Washington and Lee has a
tremendous obligation to the
future generations of students.
This is the only liberal arts col-
lege of high academic standing
that offers young men a single
sex environment. If W&L were
to go coed, the options left to the
male high school seniors would
become very restricted.

Finally, if there are any
doubts about coeducation, we
must remain all-male. We can
always go coed, but we can
never go back!

The student body has reason
to feel helpless in this situation.
The faculty and administration
have a history of making deci-
sions without student input.
President Wilson, by encourag-
ing the issue of coeducation, has
allowed himself to become
alienated from the students

before he really had a chance to
find out what student life is like.

One of President Wilson’s
most recent faux pas occurred

when he addressed a meeting of
the Interfraternity Council. He
allowed himself to be drawn in-
to a debate by appearing to in-
dict the fraternity system for
the faults in our unique and
perhaps’ perverse social
system. The I.F.C. responded
with a near unanimous attack

on what were good intentions on
the part of President Wilson.

This was a typical reaction in
what is the tendency to blame
fraternities for most of our pro-
blems. Students at the
surrounding ‘‘women’s_ col-
leges.’’ must shoulder much of
the responsibility for our lack of
social graces. They encourage
the “‘meat market”’ fraternity-
type party, never failing to
show up every Tuesday,
Wednesday, Friday and Satur-
day night, often drunker than
any minks. One of the advan-
tages of coeducation, and a sure
cure for male chauvinism,
would be to have some smarter
women around.

At the aforementioned I.F.C.
meeting it was agreed that
there are problems with Rush,
fraternity-community rela-
tions, and the physical deteri-
oration of the houses. Instead of
starting any direct motion such

as a committee to revise our ob-
solete system of Rush, I.F.C.
President Emery Ellinger an-
nounced the formation of a
‘“‘Committee for Self-
Improvement.’’ Just what the
duties of this committee are is
unclear. It will be interesting to
see if they accomplish anything
of value.

Joseph Cadle must be com-
mended for his letter to the
Ring-tum Phi last week. He hit

home on every point but one,

Homecoming. Any group may
nominate someone for Home-
coming Queen. Intervarsity,
SABU and others had the oppor-
tunity, but did not make the ef-
fort to show up for the inter-
views.

For the first time in our few
short years at W&L, the student
body is excited. Whether we go
coed or not, we have an oppor-

In support of coeducation

To the Editors:

First I'd like to sincerely
thank Joseph Cadle for elo-
quently voicing the opinions on
fraternities so many of us have
wanted to express for so long.

Now to the issue of coeduca-
tion: W&L should stay all male
because it is a tradition. Well
bloodletting for medicinal pur-

poses was a tradition for more
than 300 years. The tradition of
human slavery dates back past
the building of the great

pyramids of Egypt. The tradi-
tion argument is baloney, and
those arguing it should consider
trading in their Volvos for a
horse and buggy. There looms a
heterogeneous world out there,
and it is simply archaic to at-

tempt to prepare modern young
men for a career in that modern
world while subjecting them to
an all male academic at-
mosphere that has changed lit-
tle this century.

“Unique,” that’s the word
Bob Jenevein used. The dic-
tionary reads, ‘‘being the only
one of it’s kind; solitary; sole.”’
Did you hear that VMI? Half of
those people on the parade
ground are really women!
Perhaps that explains the re-
cent performance of the Keydet
football team.

There are, at last count, five
all male institutions of higher
education in the United States,
two here in Lexington. Not only

aren’t we unique, we're not
even unique in Rockbridge
County!

The social atmosphere here is
totally unnatural, yet I hear
complaints to the effect that
women would be distracting in
class, that women would re-
mind men during the week of
their failures the previous
weekends. Mature adults must
learn to live and coexist on such
a basis. Why not mature under
such conditions, rather than be

thrust into it upon graduation.
When a W&L graduate finds
himself the subordinate of a
woman, I hope he doesn’t
classify her as something that
used to arrive Friday nights,
five to a BMW. Can you picture
Sandra Day O’Connor driving
for an hour in anticipation of
having grain punch spilled on
her while someone slurs ‘‘Whar-
dyagotaschool?”
Those in favor of the status
quo are living in a rich man’s

tunity to change W&L for the
better — if we can keep up the
level of student interest. The
Ring-tum Phi and President
John D. Wilson are two poten-
tial leaders in this change. We

can introduce W&L to the real ~

world.

dream world. If they truely love
W&L and want it to survive as a
fine academic institution first,
and a social club second, then
the statistics are all the persua-
sion they should need. Robert
E. Lee took this university and
turned it around. He dramati-
cally expanded the curriculum,
and took the unheard of step of
abolishing manditory daily
chapel. It is time for a change;
Lee would approve.

ODK responds to criticism

To the Editors:

In the October 13 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, Joseph Cadle ex-
pressed his views on fraternity
influence at Washington and
Lee (“Fraternity Influences
Too Much on the Hill?’”’) In do-
ing so, he cited the criteria for
membership in the Alpha Circle
of Omicron Delta Kappa leader-
ship fraternity as being part of
a situation that is ‘‘just plain
sad.”’ He stated, ‘One of the
categories amidst its (ODK’s)
criteria is labelled ‘social.’ ”
Then he went on to ask, ‘‘Now
how does one cultivate social
leadership skills at W&L if one
is not in a fraternity?”’

To answer Mr. Cadle’s ques-
tion, let me begin by saying that
there are five major ‘‘phases”’
of campus life in which, accord-
ing to the General Council of
ODK, achievement should be

recognized, one of which is
given the heading ‘‘Social, ser-
vice, and religious activities,
and campus government.”’ The
Council suggests that when the
circle attempts to recognize
leaders in this particular
“phase’’ of college life, it should
consider the following: Presi-
dents of campus government
bodies; president of Student Ac-
tivities Board, Presidents of
Junior and Senior Classes;
Presidents of student religious
associations; chairpersons of
big weekend committees;
heads of other major campus-
wide activities or organizations.
Election to membership is on
the basis of merit and irrespec-
tive of a person’s affiliation
with other organizations.
Clearly, then, there are many
ways that one can cultivate
social leadership skills at W&L

without being in a fraternity;
one can, without having frater-
nity membership as a prere-
quisite, set an example through
social cooperation with and in-
terdependence upon various
campus groups.

While I support Mr. Cadle’s
right to publicly express his
views on what he considers to
be a disturbing and shameful
situation at W&L, I must object
to his generalization. The
fraternity system at W&L may
be influential but not enough to
seriously impede an indepen-
dent’s cultivation of superior
social leadership skills. And
finally, may I add that I certain-
ly hope that the Alpha Circle
would not disregard such
achievement.
