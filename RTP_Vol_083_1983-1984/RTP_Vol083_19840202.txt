The Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees
will meet beginning tomorrow
to consider coeducation, next
year’s tuition and other budget
matters.

The 25 members of the Board
will travel to Lexington from
points as far apart as San Fran-
cisco, Tampa and Hartford,
Conn.

This February assemblage is
one of three’ regularly-
scheduled annual meetings of
the trustees.

Friday morning will be
devoted to meetings of the six
committees, and their recom-
mendations will be presented to
the entire Board at its Saturday

 

Trustees to discuss
jcoed issue, budget

session.

Tomorrow atternens. a
special session will be held to
discuss the coeducation ques-
tion.

“The Board, as a Board, has
never had a chance to discuss
the implications of coeduca-
tion,” said University President
John Wilson. “This will be the
beginning of that process.

“An important part of that
meeting will be deciding what,
if any, further directions for
study are warranted.”’

On Oct. 24, following the
Board’s fall meeting, Rector
James M. Ballengee issued a
statement which said that the
trustees had ‘‘asked the Presi-
dent to re-examine the general
question of coeducation in the

EC plans $400, 000
for cost of pavilion

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The student body will commit
$400,000 toward the proposed
student activities pavilion, the
Executive Committee decided
ina special session Tuesday.

Students will face a $25 stu-
dent tax increase for the next 25
years to finance the expen-
diture. The $400,000 will be bor-
rowed at a 9.5 percent interest
rate, creating a total cost to the
students of $1.06 million.

The Student Activities Board
submitted four plans to the EC
at its regular Monday night
meeting. The least expensive
plan, an 11,960-square foot
pavilion with a 14-foot ceiling,
would cost $519,673. The same
size building with a 24-foot ceil-
ing would cost $582,053.

A second building proposed
would be 14,700 square feet.

With a 14-foot ceiling, it would

cost $600,709, and $677,475 with a
24-foot ceiling.

The Board of Trustees will
vote this weekend whether to
approve construction of a
pavilion, and, if so, whether the
university will finance any ex-
penditures above $400,000.

If the trustees fail to approve
any additional expenditures for
a pavilion, the EC has three
choices, as outlined in the
meeting Tuesday: (1) increase
student taxes even more or for
an even greater length of time
(2) have the architects design a
pavilion that can be built for
$400,000, perhaps without some
of the extras in the plans sub-
mitted this week or (3) drop the
idea.

Athletic Director William
McHenry opposes a_ pavilion
used only for social functions,
assistant to the President
Frank Parsons said during

WGL turns over records

Eight students to testify before special grand jury

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘“John’’ Read’s
special drug grand jury fur-
thered its probe of the
Washington and Lee student
body this week subpoenaing at
least eight students in addition
to University discipline records
of seven other current and
former students.

Although records in the
Rockbridge Circuit Court
clerk’s office show that only two
W&L students have been sub-
poenaed to appear before the
jury Feb. 17, sources close to
the investigation said that at
least six others have been
called to testify that day.

Circuit. Court Clerk Bruce
Patterson said the discrepancy

- could be explained in two ways.

Either the Rockbridge County
Sheriff has been unable to serve
all of the subpoenas or Read has
chosen to subpoena witnesses
without making public record in
the clerk’s office, an™ option
which is open to Read, Patter-
son said.

The eight students, all
undergraduates, are the only
W&L students who have been
subpoenaed to date other than
Executive Committee Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein who has said
he was called because of his
familiarity with the student
body.

Student Control Committee
Charlie Alcorn said he turned
over all the names of students
who had appeared before the
SCC in the last three years, a
total of seven, to Dean of
Students Lewis John. The ma-
jority of the cases involved
students caught smoking mari-
juana in the dormitories, Alcorn
said.

Dean John said the docu-
ments were turned over to Read
on Friday after each of the
students involved was given the
option of signing a release giv-
ing the University the right to

release the documents concern-
ing the SCC action against
them.

Such a release is required by |

the Buckley Amendment which
protects the confidentiality of
student records.

According to Alcorn, four of
the seven former and current
students whose SCC records
were subpoenaed signed the
consent release.

“I think we went a little
beyond the Buckley Amend-
ment,’’ said Dean John of the
release which he termed ‘‘infor-
mally worded.”

After increased media atten-

tion in relation to the grand jury

probe, the University issued the
following statement through
News Office Director Jeff Han-
na:

‘‘The university has
cooperated with the special
grand jury by providing that
grand jury certain records of
the Student Control Commit-
tee.”

Dean John would _ not
speculate whether Read plan-
ned to call more W&L students
to testify, saying Read’s in-
vestigation was unpredictable.
_Jenevein said Wednesday

that no Executive Committee
records had been subpoenaed.

Alcorn said he.expected to be
subpoenaed in relation to his in-
vestigation authority after
Jenevien was called. However,
Alcorn said he learned he would
not be called when Dean John
took over the responsibility of
the SCC records.

During the September _in-
vestigations of former W&L
students William Dederick,
Thomas Rorhig and Marc Ham,
Read possessed a list of approx-
imately 50 names of W&L
students, according to Alcorn.
He said the names were sup-
plied by the convicted students
and gained from the checks
written to them.

Alcorn said he had not spoken
with Read since those investiga-
tions.

Dean John was scheduled to
appear before the jury Jan. 27
but said he did not testify and
that his testimony has been
postponed indefinitely.

In addition to the 11 VMI
cadets who had been sub-
poenaed before this week, nine
more cadets have been added to
the witness list, according to
circuit court records.

Review and Outlook

The media blitz

In less than a week, Washington and Lee has been
catapulted into the national news following the Ex-
ecutive Committee’s vote to ask the faculty to require
students to wear ties toclass.

What has followed from this seemingly simple pro-
posal has been a perfect example of how the media
determine what is news. The story which originally
was on page four of The Ring-tum Phi found its way
into the Roanoke Times and World News, the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch, and the Washington Post. It
did not stay a regional story for long, though, as the
Associated Press carried it as well as United Press
International. The dissemination of the story has
grown in geometric proportions as more newspapers
see other newspapers covering it.

Since the approval of the request to the faculty the
EC and Student Body President Bob Jenevein have
been deluged with telephone calls from the media.
Just this week, Jenevein has been interviewed on
WRC, a Washington, D.C. radio station, and WMCA, a
New York City radio station. Wednesday morning he
was contacted by a representative of ABC-TV’s
“Good Morning, America’ about a possible ap-
pearance.

We find it surprising that the national media has
found to be news the simple question of whether or not
students at a small, liberal arts university in a small
Southern town should wear neckties to class.

Perhaps the key to the situation lies in the context.
Here at W&L the idea was taken as the serious pro-
posal it was intended to be. But what about the
perception of the issue by the national media?
Chances are they think it’s cute or novel. ‘‘What will
those W&L boys think of next?’’

When this story is placed next to stories of violence
in Beirut and fighting in El Salvador, it probably
seems petty and trivial. This is where the harm may
lie.

Free publicity is a wonderful thing, provided it is
good publicity. We are afraid, however, that this
media blitz may associate the name of Washington
and Lee with pettiness and triviality, disregarding the
school’s fine academic reputation and time-honored
traditions. This publicity may not be free after all.

Tradition may hint insecurity

To the Editors:
The recent action by the EC
urging the professoriate, on an

_ individual basis, to consider re-

quiring the wearing of neckties
in class is the latest of a series
of ‘tradition’ revivifying pro-
posals aimed at reducing ‘‘stu-
dent apathy,” among other
things. Some of these seem to
have the additional effect of
casting doubt upon the con-
fidence of those who most vocal-
ly and stridently support the
University.

These supporters would make
us know how much we should
respect the “traditional” (a
cliche in all of its declensions by
now) aspects of this school and
nearly everything ever
associated with it, however
vaguely. They do this in gravely
worded letters to the Phi, IFC
announcements and, most
evidently, in EC proposals and
decisions. They stress the
seriousness of long-standing in-
stitutions and the necessity of
their continued veneration.

It seems, though, that this is
done in increasingly less poetic
than commercialistic language
(Mock Convention official sta-
tionery: ‘‘Seventy. six years of
authenticity,” Rather like a
plastic model-kit manufac-
turer) and media (painters’
caps advertising ‘‘fine
gentlemen since 1749”). These
and other related items, like
bumper stickers directing us,
while ‘thinking Mink,” to read
the “U.S. News and World
Report” and to remember our
duty in making ‘‘better women’’
are, to some degree, ostensibly
humorous. Even so, these may
suggest something like in-
security in some of the self-

appointed guardians of our
legacy who aid their prolifera-
tion.

Comparisons to Harvard,
Yale and U.Va. only seem to
add to what may be seen as sort
of a communal inferiority com-
plex. Does one ever hear of
Washington and Lee spoken of
in a Harvard quad, a Princeton

dining club or at one of the
libraries at Duke? This practice
of comparison is, regrettably,
carried in the opposite direc-
tion, as shown at the recent
Roanoke game by the embar-
rassing behavior of W&L fans,
some of whom chanted, ‘“‘Some
day you’ll_work for me!’’ at
(continued on page 9)

EC is ‘misguided’

To the Editors:

I am increasingly offended by
my fellow student leaders on
this campus, in particular the
president and members of
Washington and Lee’s Ex-
ecutive Committee. Their
misguided sensibilities and
warped logic continually disillu-
sion me with regards to the
kinds of students Washington
and Lee is producing.

The Student Body President
speaks of an eagerness to help
the independent students of this
campus, yet writes a commen-
tary with little tone of com-
promise. The EC speaks of an
eagerness to boost morale and
displace rampant student
apathy on this campus, yet they

-insult the President of the

University by questioning his
right to make suggestions to the
student government.

The EC sees the revitalization
of traditions as the way to re-
juvenate this campus. Certain-
ly, no one can quibble with the
principal traditions at W&L;
this institution is built on tradi-
tions of excellence. We needn’t
however, wallow in them either.
Dress codes, assimilation com-
mittees, and the like belong to
an era dead twenty years.

Bringing back 1964 won’t help
this campus, looking to the
future will. I urge the EC to
follow this course rather than
the one they are navigating.

Race detail

wmproper

To the Editors:

Page 5 of The Ring-tum Phi,
of January 26, is devoted to the
criminal records of “former
Washington and Lee students.”’
One of these students ‘is a black
male; the others have no race
or sex at all.

Does this distinction reflect
Chief Sutton’s attitudes? Is it
one that will help this communi-
ty apprehend a felonious fug-
itive? Or is the distinction be-
tween “black males” and
“students”? an index to racial
attitudes — inbred, unthinking
and cruel — that bring dishonor
on us all?

Jean Dunbar
Assistant Professor
Department of English

A ‘No’ vote for neckties

To the Editors:

Neckties do not gentlemen
make, and, with all due respect
to Dr. Futch, it is not the
responsibility of the faculty to
even suggest, much less dictate
what student dress standards
should be.

That the student government
would waste its time on such ir-
relevant superficialities is a sad
comment in itself, but taking in-
to account that this is 1984 and
Ronald Reagan is President,
the absurdity of asking some-
one else to enforce your rules
for you on a subject as trivial as
this doesn’t seem out of tune
with the times.

I am heartened that those
budding bureaucrats on the EC
had enough vision to recognize
the unfortunately deceased con-
dition of one of W&L’s more
meaningful traditions, the
custom of speaking on campus.
Much warm air gets moved
around here extolling the vir-
tues of our ‘community,’ but
that will continue to be no more
than mere hokum until students
learn to behave cordially
toward one another as well as
others on campus.

Beyond the borders of our
alleged utopia, general local
perception of W&L students has
plenty of room for improve-
ment, but we can’t hope too
realistically for this to change
until we have our own house in
order. I find it hard to argue
with people who look upon the
stereotype of the W&L student
as part of a gang of loud-,
smart- and foul-mouthed thugs
speeding through town and
country, tossing imported beer
bottles out of their BMWs.

So, to approach the general
problem of student deportment
from an angle of appearances
rather than more substantive
issues of common decency in
behavior is rather myopic, and
ultimately dangerous. What
will be next? Haircut regula-
tions? Prohibition of non-
designer jeans on the Colon-

nade? I can only suggest that
anyone needing such specific
guidance in determining their
lifestyle might be more comfor-
table at the school further north
on Letcher Avenue, where
they’ll even tell you what to eat
at every meal.

Opinion

Colvin sees resumption as crucial to NATO's future

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

The suspension of
intermediate-range nuclear
arms talks between the Soviet
Union and the United States
threatens the NATO alliance
and gives the Soviet Union an
advantage in the propaganda
war for Western Europe, ac-
cording to politics Professor
Milton Colvin. Colvin sees a
resumption of the talks —
though not necessarily in the
near future —as the only way to
avert a breakup of NATO and
guarantee a free Western Eur-
ope for generations to come.

“The intermediate range
talks are the most important
talks,’ Colvin said in a recent
interview. ‘With hesitation by
the Dutch government to posi-
tion the (Pershing and cruise)
missles, as well as the prevail-
ing sentiments in West Ger-
many against the missiles, the

..competence of the alliance is

called into question. A collapse
of the alliance would give the
neutralist movement in Europe
an impetus. ;

Unspoken
out of the

by MARKHAM SHAW PYLE
Phi Columnist

Universities generally, and
this one in particular, have a
tendency toward self-righteous-
ness at times. Indeed, there are
times when only the news
business preens itself more
readily than does Academe.
One of our most cherished
myths is that of academic
freedom.

I call it a myth because it is
one: the distance between reali-
ty and its representation is
dizzying. Let me give you a few
examples. Some months back,
WLUR-FM and Cable IX co-
sponsored a debate on the ques-
tion of coeducation. It was fair-
ly well attended. But there were
members of the faculty and the
staff of this University who
were conspicuous by their
absence. They were absent
because they were afraid. A
tyranny of opinion has
established itself upon the cam-
pus. And there are those who
oppose in their hearts the
changes they fear are in-
evitable; but they dare not
speak. Not even tenure is an im-
pregnable defense, and they
know it. How many times I have
been commended by night for
my stance against the In-
novators; and always com-
mended off the record, by those

West Germany,” Colvin added.
“As Sir Alfred Mackinder
(British politician and theorist)
noted, he who controls Ger-
many controls Europe.”’

To get the intermediate-range
talks resumed, Colvin ad-
vocates deploying the remain-
ing missiles (primarily cruise
missiles) offshore. He noted the
willingness of the Navy to com-
ply with such a plan as well as
the Soviets’ promise to begin
deployment of their version of
the cruise aboard Soviet subs
off the east coast of the United
States. The accuracy of the
missiles, whether fired from
sea or shore, is the same.

“The point of any resumption
of the talks, though, is to avoid
or evade a nuclear war. After
all, as the old saying goes, ‘If
the enemies are talking, then
they’re not shooting,’ ”’ he said.

The time factor involved in
the talks also is important in
Colvin’s eyes. The Strategic
Arms’ Reduction Talks
(START) are not as important
to the alliance as are the
intermediate-range talks. ‘We
may face ugly choices, if the in-
termediate talks don’t resume,
like the collapse of NATO. That
may come in the form of the
Europeans asking us to leave or

who dare not speak out. If our
faculty and staff were to choose
a patron saint today, it might
very well be Nicodemus.

The president, with the hones-
ty we have come to expect of
that gentleman, admits that
there is unspoken opposition
which dare not speak out. But
he is at a loss, we are all ata
loss, to do anything about it.
Perhaps it is insoluble. But it
seems to me more as if we have
found the solution difficult and
left it untried.

My View

 

 

We must not underestimate
the deadly seriousness of the
blight which threatens the in-
tellectual life of our University.
This brute tyranny of opinion is
a direct attack upon the fun-
damental intellectual right of
disagreeement. That right is
jealously safeguarded because
it assures the continuance of
debate and leaves a niche for
Loyal Opposition. Academe is
well aware that majorities are
all too often dead wrong about
essentials; and has always kept
at least a ghetto set aside for the
minority. After all, in fifteen

the American public not being
willing to sustain the burden of
defending Europe,” said Col-
vin.

A return to the control table,
however, should not be an act of

“If we want a credible de-
fense in Western Europe, we
need better quality U.S. troops
in Western Europe, especially if
we decrease the size of our
presence there. We need a
credible conventional deter-
rence if we submit to a build-
down of our nuclear ability. We
must not give up our credibili-
ty,” hesaid.

“The quality of the U.S.
troops is poor in Western
Europe, a ‘hollow army’ in the
words of the former Chief of the
Army. If we build-down nu-
clear, we must build-up conven-
tional forces. We have a simple
choice: either to live with the
Soviet Union or die with the
Soviet Union. I think sane peo-
ple will choose to live with the
Soviet Union,” he said.

Colvin sees a certain danger
in the continued emphasis on
nuclear warfare in the Euro-
peantheater.

‘Don’t let them fool you. The
present policy of the United
States calls for the use of
nuclear weapons. That is the

opposition must come
closet for the fight

years we may have to admit
they were right. Universities,
like successful religions,
always hedge their bets.

The whole tenor of academic
life relies upon the freedom to
follow offbeat premises to a
starkly unpopular conclusion.
That right is threatened by an
enforced homogeneity of
thought on any matter;
especially ones so pressing as
coeducation and the other New
Improved Ideas. The thing is
dangerous if it arises more or
less spontaneously, as when,
periodically, professordom in-
dulges in one of its frenzied,
lemming-like moves to the left.
But here, given the scope of the
unspoken opposition, that is
unlikely. Rather, it seems pro-
bable that the tyranny was
more enforced than embraced.
And this is more than distress-
ing.

If there are men who are so
determined to Innovate that
they are attempting to enforce
an unnatural agreement on the
issues; men who then attempt
to daunt and persuade by
representing this agreement as
the fruit of consideration: let
them be warned. Theirs is a
form of sly dishonesty which
would not long be tolerated of a
student here. I see no reason
why the Innovators should be
allowed to behave thus.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 2, 1984, Page 3

U.S. policy,” he noted. ‘If what
I say is not acceptable to the
hard-liners, then what they
want must be war. Folks like
the Conservative Caucus and
Richard Viguerie have never
heard a shot fired in anger. I’ve
lived through a war. I have
heard those shots. The hard-
liners are just a nitwit faction.
Let’s not try to placate them.
Let’s run them over.”

Can the United States trust
the Soviet Union? No, says Col-
vin.

“Can they trust us? No. We’
operate in an environment of
mutual distrust. It is difficult to
negotiate in that sort of environ-
ment. I say we can trust the
Soviet Union to the extent that
they do not wish nuclear war
and they can trust us to the ex-
tent that we do not want a
nuclear war. On that flimsy
thread hangs the business of the
whole negotiations.”

According to Colvin, the
Soviets’ leaving the negotiating
table has furthered their goal to
split the United States from the
Western Europe.

“The aim of the Soviet Union
is to separate the United States
from Western Europe, and they
achieved that by walking out of
the talks. It was a smart move
on their part,” said Colvin.

Warning against hopes for an
early resumption of discus-
sions, Colvin nevertheless sees
a return as inevitable.

“The date is not so important.
If we rush to the talks, and we
accomplish nothing, the people
will be let down. There is
always a next time, and in this
case, I believe there will be
many next times,”’ he noted.

“I don’t foresee a new cold
war. No new arms race,” he
said, turning in his chair and
leaning back a bit. ‘‘In the cold
light of dawn, neither side
wants it.”

Arms talks break-up gives USSR advantage

capitulation on the part of the

{ United States, Colvin argues.

“We shouldn’t let the USSR
set the terms for negotiations.
The only meaningful negotia-
tions need trade — give and
take, so to speak,” he said.

The question of Soviet com-
piance with any treaty or agree-
ment reached at the talks
presents Colvin with many
questions. He wonders whether
the United States can better its
ability to-monitor compliance.
Whether the United States
should even participate in talks
with a nation which has shown
flagrant disregard for past
treaties does not bother Colvin.

“Breaking the talks for
whatever reason means losing
Europe. One is a risk, the other
a certainty. I doubt the
American public would support
Ronald Reagan (were he to
withdraw from negotiations) ,”’
Colvin said.

For Colvin, arms talks do not
mean forfeiting security. Quite
the contrary, Colvin views arms
talks as building security not
found in’ weapons of mass
destruction.

“In his most recent book,
“Real Peace,” Richard Nixon
argues that peace equals deter-
rence and deterrence equals
peace. I agree,’’ noted Colvin.

But does Colvin agree with
Ronald Reagan that deterrence
means a buildup of the arsenal?
No.

“But to me, deterrence
means a build-down,” he said.

Colvin noted that the Mutual
and Balanced Force Reduction
(MBFR) talks, which have been
taking place in Vienna for near-
ly 15 years, ought to be em-
phasized in the strategic plan-
ning of the United States. Colvin
supports a reduction of Ameri-
can troops in Western Europe,
but only on the condition that
the draft is reinstituted in the
United States.

Superdance raises $7,000 over $28,000 goal

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity raised $35,264 for the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion at the university’s sixth an-
nual Superdance, which was
sponsored by Miller Beer and
held last Friday, Saturday and
Sunday in Evans Dining Hall.
The total surpassed this year’s
goal of $28,000 and last year’s
total of $33,500.

Money was raised by dancers
collecting pledges, ticket sales,
raffles, food and beverage
sales, pie throws and a pre-
Superdance slave auction.
Those who sponsored dancers
will be billed directly by
M.D.A., and W&L normally
“thas a great collection rate,
close to 90 percent,”’ according
to Chris Williams a junior who
served as Superdance chair-
man along with seniors
Markham Pyle and Rick de
Alessandrini.

uccdays

Dance registration opened at
5 p.m. Friday with actual danc-
ing beginning at 8:15 p.m. The
event lasted for thirty hours, di-
vided into 45 minute dance ses-
sions and 15 minute breaks
along with a two-hour sleep
break Saturday morning.

The dance featured four
bands: Bryce Street, Steps, the
Spark Plugs and Casper, as well
as a number of special events,
including games and pie
throws.

‘Special events were great,”’
said Williams, who felt that the
pie throws, especially the one at
President Wilson, ‘‘were a big
draw.”

“We had asked him (Presi-
dent Wilson) originally, and he
thought he would have a
schedule conflict...but his
schedule worked out.”’

Wilson drew $1,406 from a
number of student organiza-
tions, with Executive Commit-
tee President Bob Jenevein
selected to throw the pie. Others

who had pies thrown at them
were Major John J. Mears and
Colonel David F. Fowler from
the military science depart-
ment, Commerce School Pro-
fessor Delos D. Hughes, English
Professor George W. Ray,
Coach Mervin J. Stickley, jour-
nalism Professor Robert J.
DeMaria and senior Pete White-
head.

The Superdance was accom-
panied by a marathon radio
broadcast over campus radio
station WLUR by Bob Halloran,
Taylor Hathaway and Jim
Strader, which included live
broadcasts from the Super-
dance.

“‘We raised over $150 on the
phone, which is a first,’’ said
Williams about the radiothon.

M.D.A. poster child Joshua
Cross and his mother met with
the dancers and participated in
a question and answer session
which Williams termed ‘‘very
inspiring.”

‘Muscular dystrophy is a
dramatic experience for the
family as well (as the person af-
flicted). The dancers got to see
how much things actually
cost,’’ said Williams, in
reference to the purchase of a
$4,000 wheelchair from Cross.

Cross and other area resi-
dents will be aided by all of the
money raised by W&L, which
last year raised the largest con-
tribution per capita among col-
leges which held a Superdance.
This year’s dance was made
successful mainly through the
efforts of the 53-member steer-
ing committee and 159 dancers
from W&L and other local col-
leges.

For the fourth straight year
W&L student Mike Wyatt col-
lected the most money ($5,000),

followed by Jet Taylor and VMI
cadet Chris Hinton.

Williams, who will chair next
year’s Superdance committee
was especially grateful for the
efforts of faculty advisor Fon-
taine Bostic, who has helped the
dance every year.

‘She does so much for us, and
advises us on a number of
things. She helps us _ year
round,”’ he said. ‘Ricky and
Markham (also) did a super
job.”

All of these people were cited
during the remarks at the con-
clusion of the 30-hour dance-a-

thon. Also cited was Wendy
Turner, the M.D.A. worker who
assisted the steering commit-
tee. Jerry Darrell, food services
director, also was thanked for
his help during the dance. Clos-
ing remarks were made by the
tri-chairman and Dean Lewis
John.

‘Who said Washington and
Lee students are apathetic?”
Dean John queried.

The 1984 Superdance raised
nearly twice as much as the
$17,000 collected by the first
Superdance five years ago.

Open exam decision
put off until March

The proposed open exam
policy, approved by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Thursday,
has run into another hitch,
delaying faculty action until
March 5 at the earliest.

Because a quorum was not
present at Monday’s Faculty
Exectuive Committee meeting,
no vote on the proposal could be
taken. The Faculty EC must act
on the matter before it goes to
the faculty as a whole.

The. student EC called a
special session Thursday to ap-
prove the final proposal and did
sO unanimously. Sophomore
representative Ken Lindeman,
junior representative Darby
Brower and vice president
Dave Judge were absent.

Junior representative Cole
Dawson, chairman of the open
exam subcommittee, said he
received ‘‘a very positive
response and some constructive
criticism”’ from the faculty EC.

eS OS PD WD ee

“Overall, they thought it was
pretty direct and had some good
arguments in favor of the (open
exam) system,’’ Dawson said.

He added, though, that the
members felt it would be better
not to rush a decision this week
and to study the proposal for a
couple of weeks.

The EC, Monday, scheduled a
special meeting Sunday at 7
p.m. to consider any amend-
ments or corrections to the open
exam proposal.

As approved Thursday, the
proposal would allow students
to take an exam during any ex-
am time without notifying the
professor beforehand and with-
out designating a time on the
exam envelope.

KC clarifies request for
neckties on the Hill

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Following a week of publicity,
the Executive Committee Mon-
day clarified and toned down its
request that individual faculty
members require students to
wear ties to class.

“The Executive Committee
does not presume the authority
or the ability to reinstate or en-
force a dréss code of any kind,”’
read a statement approved
unanimously by the committee.
“Our intent...is to encourage
students to dress respectably

and to encourage faculty to -

recognize their privilege of con-

trol in the classroom.”
EC President Bob Jenevein
said the statement was

prepared in consultation with
the other members of the com-
mittee. It was read and ap-
proved with no discussion.

The EC also voted 11-1
against coeducation (Secretary
Len Howard voted for coeduca-
tion) and unanimously for
spring term and Wednesday
night parties.

A $100 loan was approved for
the re-establishment of a
boosters’ club. Ed Buttarazzi,
who requested the funds, said
the money would be for alumni
mailings and promised to pay it
back by March 5.

“‘We’re trying to decrease the
apathy that’s apparent on cam-
pus,’ Buttarazzi said. ‘“‘We’re
looking for any kind of sup-
port.”’

Action on a proposed student
advisor system was tabled until
Monday following a report by
senior representative Jim

Messer of his subcommittee’s
work. Messer developed an
eight-point plan that calls for
EC selection of student ad-
visors, who would be able to
help students, especially
freshmen, in course selection.

In a cover letter to EC
members, Messer emphasized
that student advisors would be
intended to complement, not
replace, faculty advisors and
dormitory counselors. Messer
said dormitory counselors and
faculty advisors often do not
have enough time to devote to
counselling.

‘‘Last year, there were a lot of
freshmen who didn’t know what
to. expect,’’ sophomore repre-
sentative James White said. ‘I
think this system really will be.
a great thing, especially for
freshmen.”’

The EC did approve a letter
requesting a student organiza-
tion secretary to assist with typ-
ing and filing. The secretary
would be paid from university
funds.

Also Monday night, the EC
heard budget reports from:

— The Mock Convention,
which reported having raised 77
percent of its budget. Co
chairman Peter Muller said
openings still were available on
many state delegations, and
that ‘‘there’s no specific time
requirement’’ for delegates to
the convention. The Mock Con-
vention also will sponsor a fund-
raising pavilion party Feb. 25.

— The Emergency Loan Com-
mittee, which reported 16
outstanding loans for a total of
$1,666. Three loans are current,
and 13 are past due.

Phi Gamma Delta House on Preston St. Photo by David Stevens

Fiji regroups,

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

After losing recognition as an
active social fraternity last fall,
Phi Gamma Delta’s future
looks optimistic, according to
co-president Tom Fellin.

According to Dean of
Students Lewis John, the with-
drawal of recognition was the
result of accumulated social
misconduct offenses over the

_years. The Student Affairs

Committee withdrew recogni-
tion immediately after an addi-
tional offense while the fraterni-
ty was on social probation in-
volving an incident involving
the Hamden-Sydney College
mascot.

With backing from their na-
tional organization, Fiji was
granted an appeal from the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. Fiji’s
Alumni House Corporation
presented a plan to the commit-
tee for een out the pro-

blems at the house. The SAC ac-
cepted the plan and turned over
the chores of disciplining Fiji to
the House Corporation.

The House Corporation’s first
action was to set up the Alumni
Board of Control, according to
Richard Sessoms, faculty ad-
visor to Fiji. This board consists
of Fiji alumni in the general
area, and they became respon-
sible for all actions taken by Fi-

ji. The Alumni Board reviewed
each brother and pledge on an
individual basis to determine
whether or not he was deserv-
ing of any disciplinary action.
As a result of this review, 16
members were punished. Three
members were expelled from
the chapter but remain
members of Phi Gamma Delta
on a national basis. Five were
suspended from the house for a
time period ending between the
end of March and the end of
June. The expelled and sus-
— members are not allow-

house for any reason. Eight
other members were placed on
probation — they could be sub-
ject to suspension or expulsion
if their behavior warrants such
action.

The Alumni Board also felt a
change in leadership would be
helpful, Fellin said. The Alumni
Board selected six brothers to
fill the leadership positions and
those brothers decided among
themselves who would assume
the different Cabinet positions.
Fellin and Alex Castelli were
chosen to serve as ‘‘co-pres-
idents.”’

“There is no resentment on
the part of upperclassmen, ””
Fellin said. ‘Everyone is show-
ing a lot of enthusiasm and
there is a big group effort in
everything we do.”

“No expenditure over $100
can be made by Fiji without the
approval of the Alumni Board of
Control,”’ he added. Third-year
law student Jim Forte lives in
the house to serve as a super-
visor and representative of the
Alumni Board.

Fellin has an _ optimistic
oublook for the future of Fiji.
‘“‘We have 11 pledges and hope
to have more coming. I think it
says a lot for all our pledges
when you realize that none of
them depledged during this
whole mess.”’

Fellin added that there was a
lot of pride in the house. “I think

we spent more time on Christ-
mas decorations than any other
house on campus,” he said.

“Their involvement will go a
long way to offset the largest
part of the budget increase,
which is faculty salary,”’ Wilson
said.

Wilson said that based on the
faculty committee’s estimates,
approximately $37,000 worth of
laboratory software would have
to be purchased for the new
department. The most expen-
sive item to be added is a
microcomputer laboratory,
Wilson said.

Wilson said this increase
represented a very small part
of the university’s total budget
and will not precipitate a major
increase in tuition.

“‘We’ll be able to work out an
intelligent program over time,”’
Wilson said. “I think it’s ab-
solutely necessary.”

Wilson noted it was possible
that student interest in the com-
puter science department
might increase over the years

and upset current plans for the
department. He added that a
major upgrading of the main
computer scheduled for 1985
also will increase the universi-
ty’s capacities.

Wilson said he sees value in
computer science both as a
separate major and as part of
double majors. The B.A. degree
in computer science, which re-
quires fewer credits than the
B.S., will be more accessible to
double majors, noted Wilson.

“I do believe it has intellec-
tual substance and merit on its
own. I really look forward to
this development, and I hope
our attempt to find a good
senior person to head the
department will be successful,”
Wilson said.

‘Uncommon Valor’ too common

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter’

You're eight years old, and
you're waiting outside the theater
for your friend’s mother to come
pick you_and your three best
friends up. Ya'll have just seen
Tex Cobb's "Uncommon Valor,
and ya'll are kicking each other
with your P.F. Flyers. Your
friend says, “I’m Tex,” and you
say, ‘No, I'm Tex,” and then you
kick him to prove it.

Up drives Johnny’s mother. She
lets down the back window of the
station wagon and ya'll climb in.
“Did ya'll like the movie?” she
asks.

“It was the best movie I've ever
seen.”

“There's no way it was better
than Billy Jack.”

“It was the fourth best movie
I've ever seen. I liked Billy Jack
better, and Blackbeard’s Ghost,
and Papilon better too. But I want
to see it again tomorrow.”

review:

The creative explosion which
ultimately became Uncommon
Valor occurred when some
screenwriter, told to write a
script based on Bo Gritz’s re-
cent failed POW rescue mission
— and told to make it snappy,
decided to stir in a little Dirty
Dozen. The results are nothing
less than predictable. The
movie begins as Gene Hack-
man, in anguish over his miss-
ing son, gets snubbed by insen-
sitive politicians. A man’s gotta
do what a man’s gotta do, so
Gene goes knocking on the
doors of all his son’s former Ar-
my buddies. At first, each
refuses -— ‘‘Don’t go layin’ a
guilt trip on me, man,”’ — but to
Gene and ourselves, who know
better, they sound like Gilligan
saying, ““You can’t make me,
you can’t make me.”’ Gilligan
did wear the dress (he probably
wanted to), and these guys, ina
display of nothing less than un-

 

‘the movie totally self-destructs

..there is no tension,

only

viewer apathy by the rescue’

 

I’ll stop now. If 1 go any fur-
ther, I might accidentally
radiate the idea that this movie
is so full of basic, childlike
pleasures (see E.T.) that, even
though we’ve become mature,
intelligent young adults, we’ll
still cherish it for its refreshing
innocence and numerous explo-
sions. So I’m putting a stop sign
on Memory Lane in order to put
Uncommon Valor in a more pro-
per, and therefore more nega-
tive, perspective. Here’s the

 

| 165 S. Main St.

 

 

 

common valor, join Gene.

Once decided, they go ‘‘north
of Galveston” to an exact
replica of the Vietnamese
prison camp. The camp, as with
all of the expenses, is paid for
by a wealthy businessman, who
is also missing a son. As the
wealthy businessman, Robert
Stack really inhabits this role,
in much the same way he in-
habits every role. At the end,
when he flashes a_ winning
smile, thus discarding his

stoney image for a moment, we
come to understand why he
keeps that smile in check
whenever possible.

But the scenes at the camp
are easily the movie’s best.
Here, the members of Gene’s
brigade are introduced to the
audience so that we'll care
when they die, or be relieved if
they live. And if Uncommon
Valor has one strength, it’s that
these characters are all
likeable and portrayed good
naturedly. Especially Tex
Cobb. While he is big, ugly and
stupid, he’s also pretty funny,
as when he does his herky-
jerky-kung Fu — Martin Sheen
in Apocalypse Now, before he
chops the mirror dance. If Mr.
T had Tex’s personality maybe
I’d watch the “A-Team.”

But the movie totally self-
destructs when they arrive in
Asia. There is no tension, only
viewer apathy, by the time of
the grande finale rescue. This
Vietnam is very green and very
empty of Vietnamese, and it
would be very easy to win a war
here. When some Vietnamese
finally do appear, it’s only to
run around and get blown up;
there is not one bit of dialogue
or one close-up of the enemy.
The actual rescue has no
method or clarity at all, just a
Chinese fire drill with
fireworks. Worst of all, the
movie loses its sense of humor
when it leaves Galvaston. Just
obligatory problems, obligatory
deaths and obligatory POW’s
who look too much like
obligatory actors trying to look
emaciated and spaced-out. —

So should you go see
Uncommon Valor? Assuming
you’ve cone your homework,
checked the TV Guide for
anything better and you enjoy
just sitting ina theatre, maybe.

Two plays presented
by University Theatre

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

The University Theatre will
present two one-act plays that
differ greatly in tone this
Wednesday and Thursday, Feb.
8 and 9, at 8 p.m. in the
Troubador Theatre.

The first, Woody Allen’s
‘“‘Death Knocks,” is a satirical
comedy. ‘‘What Allen does is
take our greatest fear, death,
and reduce it to a comic situa-
tion,’ said Brian O’Riordan,
who is directing the play. Nat
Ackerman, the protagonist, will
be played by Robert J. Whann
IV. Todd Harvey will star op-
posite him as Death.

The second play, ‘‘The In-

former’’ by Bertold Brecht, is
far more somber. Taken from
Brecht’s ‘‘The Private Life of
the Master Race,’ the play tells
the story of .a couple whose son
is a member of the Hitler
Youth.

“Brecht gives us a warning
that is-as clear today as it was
in Germany during the late 30s:
‘No one is safe,’ ” said director
Chris Lillja. The cast includes
Frank King as the servant,
Chris Cartmill as the husband,
Elizabeth Ray as the wife and
Tom Ziegler as the boy.

Both plays are _ being
presented as part of Professor
Albert Gordon’s directing class.
Reservations are required and
admission is free.

 

‘Kagemusha’ to be

here this weekend

The Washington and Lee
University Film Society will
show ‘‘Kagemusha”’ (‘‘The
Shadow Warrior’’), directed by

- Akira Kurosawa, as its next

presentation on Friday and
‘Saturday, Feb. 3 and 4.

The film, which won the 1980
Cannes Film Festival Grand
Prize, will be shown at 8 p.m.
both evenings in Classroom A of
Lewis Hall, the Washington and
Lee law school building. There
is no charge for admission and
the public is invited to attend.

“‘Kagemusha’”’ is set in 16th-
century Japan and concerns a
powerful warlord and his dou-
ble, a petty thief, who occa-
sionally ‘‘substitutes’” for the
warlord in dangerous situa-
tions. When this leader dies, the
double ‘‘becomes”’ the warlord
ei order to protect and unify the
clan.

463-9152

 

According to Dick Grefe,
faculty adviser of the W&L
Film Society, Kurosawa ‘“‘has
taken great pains to recreate
the costumes, settings and even
the weapons of a violent and
turbulent time in Japanese
history. Nevertheless, Kuro-
sawa did not photograph colors,
and sweeping motions create
enhanced images of epic pro-
portion.”’

Glover
paintings
on display

An exhibition of paintings by
Roanoke artist Ann Glover is on
display in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery
through Feb. 24.

A Roanoke native and a
graduate of Mary Baldwin Col-
lege, Mrs. Glover has taught
painting at the Roanoke
Museum of Fine Arts and
Virginia Western Community
College. She has served as one
of the Virginia Museum’s
traveling artist program in-
structors.

Works by Glover are contain-
ed in several permanent collec-
tions, including the Roanoke
Museum of Fine Arts. She has
had one-woman exhibitions at
the Roanoke Museum of Fine
Arts, the Lynchburg Art
League, Mary Baldwin College

and the Dorsey Gallery in
Roanoke.

duPont Gallery is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Satur-
day, and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sun-
day. Admission is free.

Depressed?
Mood may affect how you Study |

By COLE DAWSON
Staff Reporter

Mood affects memory. A re
cent study concluded by psy-
chology professor David G.
Elmes found that the efficiency
with which students remember
is directly correlated with their
mood and study environment.

Studying over a_ gradual
length of time proved to be
almost three times as effective
in learning and retaining most
material than last-minute
cramming. This analysis was
true for people in an ordinary or
content mood, but the dif-
ference was remarkably
smaller for those students who
were depressed.

The study found last-minute
cramming to be only one-third
less effective than spreading
out one’s study time for
depressed students. Depression
reduced the effectiveness of
more efficient learning situa-
tions.

In fact, according to Elmes,
depressed students had better
recall after cramming than did
the non-depressed students
after cramming.

“It may be that ‘optimal

learning situations may have to
be tailored to the emotional
characteristics of the in-
dividual,’’ Elmes said. Some

students may find it more effi-
cient to cram than to spread out
their work depending on their
mood, the study found.

The Elmes study involved in-
ducing a ‘‘mild depression’”’ by
letting a student ‘‘read through
a long series of self-referent
statements that were very
depressing in  connotation.”’
These included such statements
as, ‘‘all of the unhappiness of
my past life is catching up with
me,” and “I feel so depressed
today, I could go to sleep and
never wake up.”

The students were to think
about the statements and im-
agine they were indeed in those
situations. They were given
miniature personality tests to
ensure that they had reached a
depressive state.

The non-depressed control
group read through statements
that were not emotionally
charging and then given similar
personality tests.

“The particular mood you are
in, determines what you re-

member,’ according to Dr.
Elmes. He concluded that there
is a “‘state-dependent memory
based on mood.’’ That is, “‘if
students themselves are unhap-
py or depressed, then they may
indeed learn better under un-
pleasant studying situations,
like high pressure, than if they
are in a happy or ordinary
mood.”’

At this point it is ‘‘not at all
clear how an emotion, like
depression, influences the
memory directly.” Dr. Elmes
hopes that through his research
he will gain a better under-
standing of how ‘emotions in
general and depression in par-
ticular’ influence what aid how
people remember.

Dr. Elmes has two goals in his
research on mood and the
memory. One is trying to
understand how the memory
system itself works, and he also
is trying to “perhaps define effi-
cient learning situations.”

Elmes has been studying
memory in general since gradu-
ate school; but since 1920 has
been particularly interested in
the conditions that lead to effi-
cient memorizing.

To the Editors:

It is time to reply to pomposi-
ty with: logic. After reading
Markham S§. Pyle’s article in
the Jan. 19 issue of the Phi, I felt
compelled to write you. It is in-
teresting to note that the forces
of single-sex education always
someway bind themselves with
the tradition of Robert E. Lee.
Our ancestors did it this way so

why should not we?

Mr. Pyle defends Washington
and Lee, one of the Best Liberal
Arts Colleges in the nation, with
close minded, sneeringly sar-
castic remarks. Will the admis-
sion of women make us all card-
carrying communist members?
A new San Francisco or Green-
wich Village? Will it deface the
politically active clubs. No, it

ODK lacks publicity

To the Editors:

I agree that it is unfortunate
that few students attended the
O.D.K.-Founders’ Day cere-
mony on Jan. 20. However, I
would not place the blame sole-
ly on student apathy.

In the past announcements
have been made by. teachers
concerning the important event
and the corresponding schedule
changes. This year, out of the
five classes I attended before
the event, not one of my
teachers made mention of the
situation. On campus there
were only one or two signs an-
nouncing the event, and the Phi

was only able to announce it the
week before, undoubtedly caus-
ing many students to simply
forget.

Last year’s ceremony pro-
duced an extremely large atten-
dance due to the fact that it was
the student’s first official con-
tact with our new president. I
doubt this incentive will be a
common occurrence, therefore,
I suggest more promotion by
the ODK Society, administra-
tion and faculty, and less
criticism of the students.

will not. I suggest Mr. Pyle
return to Goshen and get in
touch with his senses.

The spirit of this institution is
found not in the superflous, self-
serving remarks of Mr. Pyle,
but in Lee himself. Robert E.
Lee was an innovator as an
educator. Lee’s proscription for
this college was a demarcation
line in American educational
history. He started one of the
first elective systems in this
country. This was a departure
from the “Classics steeped
prewar education of Southern
gentlemen, all of whom were
expected to take exactly the
same courses in college no mat-
ter what they planned to do in
life.’’ Lee encouraged his facul-
ty to experiment and suggest
new ideas. Lee knew that as a
sanctuary for future Hope,
Washington College had to
change its course to be adept in
the new postwar era.

The charge that the admis-
sion will indirectly drive the
honor code underground and
that the role of student govern-
ment would take place in
revolutionary modes is absurd.
Lee said that ‘‘experience has
shown it (the Honor Code) can
be safely trusted — upon the
honour and self-respect of the
students themselves.” Will the
admission of women corrupt
this spirit which existed then
and today? Mr. Pyle implies
that it will and that is an insult
to every student on this cam-
pus. /

The Ring-tum Phi, February 2, 1984, Page 9

Lee would want it that way, Mr. Pyle

The students of VMI and
Washington College used to
march in a procession, to the
beat of a military drum. ‘Lee
made a point of marching out of
step.”’ he knew that a kindling
of past spirit could not benefit
the future of the South or the
Union. Lee knew that the battle
had ended. His energies were
expended to ensure that an
education through exposure
would enable men to have the
composure to see through
arguments that are as baldly

Slanted and irrational as Mr.
Pyle.

General Lee was a visionary.
He knew that the ability to
change, no matter how bitter
the metamorphosis, was a
necessity in a man’s character.
As President Reagan recently
told us, there are more women
entering executive positions
than ever before. It is no longer
a man’s world. It is time that we
adhere to Lee’s idea of change
and follow his off-beat March.

I think not. Since the eigh-
teenth century our graduates
have been producing records
which stand by themselves
while living lives consistent
with the high ideals enumerated
by our founders and shapers.
Until fairly lately there has
been little perceived need to
make the school a Harvard or a
Yale. Many men have chosen
the school over others such as
those for its unique qualities,
which are beyond comparison.

It seems then, and I suggest,
that this school might benefit
most by urgently striving
toward a new awareness of its
most historically pervasive and

appropriate tradition — un-

spoken, innate self-confidence.
This school has many strengths
which may be best presented in
a manner consistent with our
highest ideal. The gentleman of

Swimmers maintain national
ranking; four place in top 10

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
swimming team defeated
William and Mary 66-47 last
weekend in a dual meet at the
Cy Twombly Pool. The victory
improved the Generals’ dual
meet record to 6-3 and helped
them retain their fifth-place na-
tional ranking in NCAA Divi-
sion III.

Taber Smith swam a personal
best on his split as the anchor-
man of the 400-yard medley
relay, and Tim Rock and Bobhy
Pearson placed first and secon
in the 1000-yard freestyle to help
give the Generals a 15-1 lead
after the first two events.

“It was an uphill fight for
William and Mary the rest of
the way,”’ said head swim coach
Page Remillard. The Generals
clinched the meet in the next to
last event.

Double winner Jay ReVille

According to Remillard, W&L
diver Joe Donovan dove very
well, despite losing his contacts.
Donovan won third place on the
one meter board and second
place on the three meter.

Currently the W&L swim
team is preparing for a dual
meet against Virginia Com-
monwealth on Feb. 10. The
meet will be held at Sweetbriar
College.

In preparation for the meet
against VCU, the Generals are
beginning to reduce the work
load during practices. Remil-
lard believes that the lighter
work-outs will allow the swim-
mers to rest. Also, the Generals
are going to spend more time
working on starts, turns and
race pace.

“VCU is a very, very good
team,” Remillard said. ‘‘A win.
would be the biggest of the year.
It could happen. VCU would
have to make a mistake, but I
haven’t seen a perfect meet
yet.”

...1Us time for a look at col-

final two months of the season,
here are a few thoughts on
everything from the Final Four
to drugs in Maryland. First,
there’s the Heels of UNC.
Frankly, a week ago, I would
have reserved the tournament
championship to the gang from
Chapel Hill. But now that Kenny
Smith (Phil Ford with
Skywalker capabilities) is out
for an indefinite period with a
broken wrist, the outlook may
have been changed. The Heels
are still the team to beat, but
when the game gets close,
Smith’s ability to see Michael
Jordan and his quickness on the
fast break will be missed. They
can get close to the champion-
ship without him (Jordan, Sam
Perkins et. als. are a little
familiar with winning and
aren’t ready to give it up) but

the explosiveness of a UNLV,
the menacing defense of a
Georgetown or the all-court
strength of a DePaul become a
greater threat should any of
these squads meet UNC minus
No. 30. Speakng of threats to the
crown, those three teams along
with the Carolina crowd are my
mid-season guesses as guests in
Seattle come the last weekend
in March. One warning though:
Watch out for those with three
or four losses right now (Mem-
phis St., Syracuse). There will
be surprises, and these teams
will be doing the surprising.
And finally, it saddens, rather
sickens, me to listen to the story
out of College Park, Md., this
week. Adrian Branch was ar-

rested on a mariguana posses- '

sion charge and — get this —
Coach Lefty Driesell said he
knew nothing of Branch’s drug
problems. Nevertheless, Lefty
quickly suspended Mr. Branch
and his accomplice bench
warmer Steve Rivers, saying,
“I am concerned with the per-
sonal welfare of these two in-
dividuals.’”’ Gee, Lefty, your
prepared statement sounds
great. But if you were really
concerned, coach, wouldn’t you
have been able to avoid having
this happen. Maybe Lefty
should think about what the
function of a coach is instead of
how he can entice Joe High

gambling on sports you run the
risks of games being fixed or

England oddsmaking and
gambling are legalized national
pastimes. In England, however,
there are no comparable col-

Hoopsters split,

face E&2H tonight

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
basketball team this week easi-
ly defeated Maryville on Mon-
day night, 75-62, but lost Thurs-
day night, 70-67, to a Catholic
team that W&L had already
beaten earlier in the season.

The win against Maryville in
Warner Center gave the team
an 11-7 record, 6-3in the ODAC. '

The Generals took the early
lead against the Scots and never
let up. W&L went on a 15-5
streak to end the half, leading
30-23. The Generals coasted to
the victory in the second half.

W&L outrebounded the Scots
40-32 and outshot them 48 per-
cent to 40 percent for the game.

The team welcomed the re-

Graves scored a game-high 22
points to pull within 10 points of

In Washington, D.C., Thurs-
day night the Generals lost toa

season, 86-70.

Head coach Verne Canfield

services of 6-foot-8 sophomore

game between the two teams.

Canfield’s worries were well-
founded. The Generals had to

Dixon paces WEL
grapplers to 9-2

By WILLIAM KING and
MIKE STACHURA
Staff Reporters

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team won two of its
three matches on the week, in-
cluding a 33-18 favorable deci-
sion last night against Long-
wood College to raise their
season tally to 9-2.

Last night, the Generals fell
behind the Lancers, 18-9, after
the first six bouts. But three
forfeits and a pin from Joe
O’Neill at 177 lbs. secured the
team victory for W&L. Other
winners on the evening for the
Generals were Jeff Mazza who
registered a fall at 126 lbs.,
Larry Anker (142 (142 lbs.),
Tim Valliere (167 lbs.) and
Carlton Peebles (HWT).

Pacing the Generals on the
season has been junior tri-
captain Jeff Dixon at 190 lbs.
With yesterday’s victory Dix-
on’s season mark stands at a

spotless 17-0.

Dixon is not the only General
with an impresseve record.
Valliere sports a 14-2 slate,
while Anker is 12-5 and Mazza is
11-6.

At the Washington and Jeffer-
son tri-meet, the Generals
defeated the host team 22-21,
thanks to Peebles’ 8-1 decision
at heavyweight. They lost to
Hiram College in their second
meet of the day, 38-12.

Head coach Gary Franke was
pleased with his team’s perfor-
mance in its two meets on the
week,

‘We wrestled very well in the
two wins,” Franke said. ‘‘And
despite the score, I felt that if
we could have wrestled a little
more aggressively, we could

have beaten Hiram.”

Saturday, the Generals play
host to Lynchburg, Furman and
LaSalle for the W&L Quad-
rangular meet, which begins at
1:30p.m.

Pavilion

 

(continued from page 1)

Tuesday’s meeting.

‘“‘He would not oppose a
building that -has some
usefulness to the athletic
needs,”’ though, Parsons added.

When not being used for
social functions, the bigger
pavilions would provide room
for athletic practices and in-
tramural events.

On Jan. 9, the EC approved a
maximum expenditure of $25
per student for 15 years. At that
time, the projected pavilion
cost was $250,000. Detailed
plans were drawn up by the
Richmond architectural firm of
Marcellus, Wright, Cox and
Smith showed an increase over
that estimate by a local firm.

Those plans were presented
to the EC Monday night, when
junior representative Darby
Brower told the EC that the
University would pay the in-
terest on a $400,000 loan.

After a lengthy debate on
whether to spend $400,000 for
the pavilion, the EC delayed ac-
tion until Tuesday.

‘“‘There’s just no way in the
world we can decide right now,
in this meeting, to spend this
money,” EC President Bob
Jenevein said.

SAB co-chairman Burford
Smith opened Tuesday’s
meeting by reporting that the
students would, indeed, be
responsible for both the prin-
cipal amount of the loan and the
interest. Dean of Students
Lewis John, Associate Dean of
Students Michael Cappetto and
Parsons were at the meeting to
answer questions.

Parsons said $25 per student
per year for 25 years, based on
1,700 students, would finance a
loan of $405,365.71.

“Do you want the place?
That’s what you have to ask
yourself,’’ Cappetto said. “Is
the pavilion worth it to you?”

Senior representative George
Youmans answered the ques-
tion. ‘‘This building’s supposed
to last 50 years,”’ he said. ‘‘It’s
going to affect everybody.”

Secretary Len Howard said,
“T’m still very much in favor of
building this facility. We’re go-
ing to need a facility like this.

‘“‘We’re not charging more to
the students as individuals,”
added Howard, noting that all
the EC had to do was extend the
$25 student tax increase from 15
years to 25 years to cover the
loan.

Jenevein suggested that
perhaps the EC should first find
out if the Board of Trustees
would approve such a project
and how much money the board
would be willing to contribute.
Then, Jenevein said, the EC can
make its decision.

Dean John said the student
body was doing the right thing,
though, by presenting the
trustees with a financial com-
mittment.

“There isn’t a whole lot of
money to be found at the mo-
ment,’ Parsons warned. ‘‘The
trustees will be considering re-
quests with a number of other
requirements that are coming
due.

“The university is interested
(in the pavilion),’’ Parsons add-

ed. ‘It will bring great relief
because of the problems we
have getting things set up in the
dinihg hall or in the gym (for a
social event).”

Brower’s motion to increase
the student tax by $25 (to $100
for 1984-85) for a 25-year period
was seconded by Youmans and
approved unanimously.

Before the vote, Cappetto
said, ‘Your sons and daughters
will be seniors here when you’re
paying for it.”

The smaller pavilion would be
about 72 feet wide and 103 feet

long for a total floor space of
7,400 feet. Fire regulations re-
quire at least seven feet of floor
space for each occupant. For
purposes of comparison, Evans
Dining Hall has a floor space of
about 6,300 square feet.

The larger pavilion would be
about 78 feet by 123 feet for a
total floor space of 9,600 feet.
Both pavilions would have a 3-
foot-high stage 24 feet deep.

Both also would have bath-
rooms, dressing rooms, a bar,
an office and storage area. The
larger pavilion would have ad-
ditional storage space.

In making his motion to raise
the student tax $25, Brower
noted that the tax had once been
2 percent of tuition but in recent
years had dropped to about 1
percent of tuition. Even the $100
tax, he said, would only be
about 1.5 percent of the tuition.

In a related matter, the EC
voted Monday to name the
pavilion after former W&L
president and law professor
Robert E.R. Huntley, who left
Jan, 1 to become executive vice-
president for Best Products,
Inc., in Richmond.

everything we can to keep the
alumni, faculty and students of
the University informed about
our progress and in appropriate
ways, involved in our assess-
ments.

“We will discuss at our
February meeting how we

President Wilson said he ex-
pects the session to be divided
into two parts.

The first, with staff present,
will be a general discussion of
the issue and how the Board ex-
pects to proceed.

“The Board concluded in Oc-
tober that the matter warranted
further study, but it didn’t
decide how that study would be
undertaken,’’ Wilson said.
‘“That’s what will be done at
this meeting.”

That will be followed by an
executive session of the
trustees, during which Wilson

said “the Board will be talking
quietly among itself, deciding

_ what’s at stake and what they

regard as the most important
issue.”’

Wilson said that the Board
will use its standing committee
structure to investigate ‘‘this
question of improving Washing-
ton and Lee and the question of
coeducation.

' “The Board could decide that
this does not have merit, and
that we should continue in our
current character,’’ he added. -

In addition to the trustees, the
executive session will include
Alumni Board of Directors
President Peter A. Agelasto III
and Student Body President
Robert C. Jenevein.

Wilson said they will attend
‘because they are by formal
agreement non-voting partici-
pants in Board activities.

“Though they are not formal
members of the Board and don’t
vote,”” he continued, ‘‘they can
and do have a voice. In this
case, it was thought valuable to
have them present from the
beginning.”’

‘‘As it was originally planned
by the Board, we were not in-

- vited to be in that session until I

brought it to President Wilson’s
attention,’’ Jenevein said.

‘“T firmly expressed my
desire and I think other people’s
desire to have students repre-
sented the whole time. I said in
no uncertain terms that I
thought that was the right thing
to do.”’

‘‘T hope they’ ll decide to settle
the issue before the end of this
school year,” Jenevein said.

A combined meeting of the
Budget and Audit and Invest-
ment committees will consider,
among other issues, tuition and
financial aid for the 1984-85
academic year.

University Treasurer E.
Stewart Epley said he will
recommend a substantial in-
crease over this year’s tuition of

He said that in their planning,
they are projecting inflation at5
percent, and the proposed in-
crease is well above that figure.

At Tuesday’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting, junior repre-
sentative Darby Brower, dis-
cussing a student tax increase
to finance the proposed
pavilion, said a $100 student tax
would be 1.5-percent of the pro-
posed 1984-85 tuition. $100 is 1.5
percent of $6,666.67.

‘One of the biggest factors in
that increase is that President
Wilson is concerned with the
level of faculty salaries,’’ Epley
said.

‘‘We try to stay competitive,”
Wilson added, and he said that
consideration would dictate a
higher level of compensation
next year.

Another reason for the in-
crease, Epley said, is inflation
and the increased cost of sup-
plies and equipment, particu-
larly energy.

Also, Epley said, “Dr. Wilson
wants to provide every year a
capital reserve provision’
which would likely be ‘‘in the
low six figures.”’

Possible uses of that would in-
clude purchase of a needed
$250,000 cooler, and replace-
ment of the Harris academic
computer in the 1985-86 school
year.

In addition, Epley said, there
will be a net increase in the
number of faculty next year.
This will include a Computer
Science department head and,
Wilson said, another chair in
the Romance Languages.

Epley said that funded finan-

cial aid for 1984-85 will ‘‘go up,

largely triggered by the in-
crease in tuition.”

Wilson said that the
Academic Affairs committee
will consider, among other
agenda items, the appointment
of a specialist in Judaic Studies
to a newly endowed chair in the
religion department.
