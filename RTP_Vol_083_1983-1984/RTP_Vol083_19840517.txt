Fatal Fiji

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

“ARSON: REWARD”’ signs
were posted outside the charred
remains of the Phi Gamma Del-
ta fraternity house this week,
following the announcement by
investigators that last month’s
fatal fire was set intentionally.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said at a Monday news
conference that the blaze was
started by a substance “‘of a
petroleum nature, probably
gasoline.’ He said that police
have some possible suspects and
motives, but that no charges
have been filed.

‘At this time we will say that,
as a result of laboratory tests,
the total circumstances of the
fire and the physical evidence,
we have now determined that
the fire was originated by ar-
son,”’ Sutton said.

Sutton said after the news con-
ference that the laboratory tests
included samples of debris and
fluids taken from the scene of
the fire.

He said it is likely that some-
one arrested in connection with
the case would be charged

fire ruled arson

with arson and _ first-degree
murder.

The three-story house was gut-
ted by a pre-dawn blaze on April
11, when most Washington and
Lee students were on spring
break.

The victim, sophomore
Thomas J. Fellin, was the only
occupant of the main house when
the fire broke out. The honor stu-
dent and co-president of the
fraternity apparently died of
smoke inhalation.

“This fire was of particular
significance in property damage
and very unfortunate in that the
president of the fraternity...died

as a result of the fire,’’ Sutton
said.

‘‘We are looking in several dif-
ferent directions — we did not
narrow it to one individual,’’ he
added. ‘‘There could be varying
motives.’’

Sutton said the unusual
features of the fire included the
intensity of the heat and the
“burn patterns that were not
consistent with any theory.”’

The police chief also cited the
short time in which the fire
spread as suspicious.

He said that Timothy S. White,
a W&L senior, told investigators

Grand jury disbands

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The special grand jury in-
vestigating local drug traffick-
ing has completed seven months
of work by submitting a report
containing recommendations for
indictments to Rockbridge Coun-
ty Circuit Court Judge George F.
Honts III.

The report is still sealed.
Honts said he received the
report last Thursday but has not
yet determined what action will
be taken.

A special grand jury has broad
subpoena and _ investigative
powers, but cannot issue indict-
ments. It provides recommenda-
tions to the regular grand jury,
which met May 7 and can be re-

‘onvened at any time. ‘‘They
y be called back ina relative

ly short time, and they may
not,”’ the judge said.

Honts said he had given the
report an initial reading, but had
not yet studied it in detail. ‘‘It
waS a sweeping investigation,
and once they got started, the
jurors were a pretty dedicated
bunch from what I’ve gleaned,”’
he said.

“They were required to
specify in the report any indict-
ments which they felt were ap-
propriate, and they have met
that requirement,” he said.

\ccording to Honts, the
report, which is ‘“‘not over-
whelming in length,”’ contains a
first section of indictment
recommendations, and ‘‘three or
four sections which deal with
other matters.’

The judge said that ‘“‘as a

word ‘‘expelled’’ on a student’s

Jenevein said he decided to
withdraw the motion to lower the
number of votes needed to con-
vict someone in an open trial
from eight to five after discuss-
ing the matter with alumni and
trustees. No other members of
the EC, which had given pre-
liminary approval to the
measure by a 5-2 vote last week,
objected to Jenevein’s decision.

Nevertheless, Senior Law
Representative Jim Green read
into the record a letter from the
Student Bar Association also op-
posing the five-vote proposal.

“This proposal not only
tramples the accused’s due pro-
cess rights, but also under this
system, one can imagine the en-
suing civil suits which will tear
at the fabric of Washington and
Lee’s honor system,’’ the letter
charged.

The letter said that if the five
vote proposal were approved,
SBA participation in the future
open hearings was ‘‘questiona

Werner claims fourth
shutout as soccer splits two

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Sophomore forward Bill
Holmes scored a goal in each
game this week as the Gener-
als’ soccer team split two away
games, defeating Catholic
University, 3-0, on Saturday,
and losing in overtime, 3-2, to
Radford University on Tues-
day.

The victory over Catholic
ended the ODAC season for the
Generals, who finished at 3-3 in
the conference. Lynchburg Col-
lege, which defeated W&L, 2-1,
on Oct. 19, took the ODAC title
witha 5-1 record.

Tuesday’s defeat at Radford
left W&L with a 7-5 record with
one game remaining, a 10:00
a.m. match this Saturday
against Emory University on
Wilson Field.

Although the Generals failed
to capture the ODAC title, head
coach Rolf Piranian is happy

-with the way his team has

developed this season. “‘As a
team we’ve improved, clearly.
We’ve scored more goals and
played better defense,”’ said the
eighth-year coach.

Holmes, Gary Clements, and
freshman Ken Randby scored
the goals against Catholic. The
shutout was the fourth of the
season for junior goalie Jay
Werner, who has a 1.33 goals
against average per game. The
W&L shutout record is seven in
a season and 11 ina career.

Against Radford Holmes and
Steve McGrath gave the Gener-
als a 2-) lead, which they held
going into the final two minutes.
Radford scored with 1:39 left,
however, to send the game into
overtime, then ended the game
seven minutes into the first
overtime with the winning goal.

Holmes now has five goals
and seven assists on the season,
for 17 total points. Senior co-
captain Roland Simon, with six
goals and four assists, has 16
points.

 

An Open Letter from
Lloyd’s of Lexington

Dear Washington & Lee Students:
When we opened our restaurant 3 years ago, we did so hoping

 

that Lloyd’s would become a popular place for students to come
with their friends for a quick meal. We added the most popular
video games in the country to provide a little entertainment in a
conservative town that lacks a lot in the entertainment field.
You have been good to use.

In the past 12 months, Dominos and Arby’s have entered into
the fast food market and sliced the pie. There are only so many
dollars to be spent on food.

One thing that is unique about our ‘‘Lloyd’s of Lexington,”’ is
that the owner works and manages his store, which keeps him in.
touch with the needs of the community. We have responded to
the needs of you students by operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. But, with this, we have excess overhead to pay.

I can tell you that we have tried for the past 3 years to provide
a quality product, with fast, courteous service, in a clean
restaurant. Some businesses would have you to believe that your
business does not matter. Let me be the first to say, if it were not
for Washington and Lee students, Lloyd’s of Lexington would
not survive. ;

We will continue to provide specials to build business. We hope
you will take advantage of these specials, as you could save
some money.

We will be purchasing two of the latest new ‘‘laser disc’’ video
games next week, Dragon’s Lair, and Mach III. These games
are intense. Come by and let them blow your mind.

Please friends, think twice before spending your money in
chain food stores. Your money will be invested back into this
business, to better it, which will benefit you in the long run. As
we celebrate our 3rd anniversary, I would like say thank you; a
million thank you’s for making Lloyd’s better today than yester-
day. Help us make it better tomorrow than it is today.

Respectfully,
Lloyd W. Smith Jr.

Geraldine Ferraro — The Fox of Flatbush

NY Congresswoman suggested as viable contender in Democratic V-P nomination race

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

Everyone knew the names of
Mondale, Hart and Jackson for
the number one spot on the
Democratic ticket, but who is
the “Fox from Flatbush” and
who is Senator Lloyd Bensten
(?), Bentson (?), Bentsen (7?) —
whatever?

The Mock Democrats found

Analysis

SARS RE
nominating for the vice-pres-
ident spot a bit tougher to
predict this past Saturday, but
by most standards their choice
was a wise one.

“It was a good choice. It was a
realistic choice. Since the pur-
pose of the Mock Convention is to
be as accurate as possible, it
succeeded,’’ said politics pro-
fessor Milton Colvin, himself
nominated by the Montana
delegation to head the ticket.

Realism aside, the race for the
number two spot on the ticket is
for most political spectators the
real race. Everyone from New
York Governor Mario Cuomo to
House Speaker Tip O’Neill (they
both favor Congresswoman
Geraldine Ferraro of New York,
the aforementioned ‘‘Fox from
Flatbush’) to Richard Nixon
and Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young (who see a Mondale-Hart
ticket as both a unifying move
and a tough ticket) calls the

____Letters

cards differently. Many factors
must be weighed.

Consider the constituencies
the Democratic candidates have
counted within the past year.
Last fall the National Organiza-
tion of Women (NOW) called the
then-eight candidates before He
board to examine and Cross-
examine them. At least two can-
didates emerged pledged pledg-
ing a woman as vice-president if
nominated. Two others — the
two frontrunners today, Mon-
dale and Hart — pledged to
“seriously consider’’ a woman in
the second spot. So, women are
placated by having a Ferraro-
type placed on the ticket.

Or are they? Richard Nixon, in
his magical reappearing act,
noted rather astutely last week,
‘A woman on the Democratic
ticket would not help because the
activist-type women who would
change their vote for president
because a woman was on the
ticket are already for Mondale
and against Reagan. So he’s not
going to pick a woman. He’s go-
ing to take either (Texas Sen.
Lloyd) Bentsen or (Gary)
Hart.”

Nixon’s remark illustrates two
very important considerations
on presidential/vice-
presidential pairings: regional
balance and political balance.
Mondale, seen as a career politi-
cian and as a Minnesotan, needs
a running mate from the South
or West, hence Bentson or Hart.
Ideologically, Mondale is a

liberal in the best sense of
Humphrey and Johnson, '
Bentsen is seen as toeing a
careful line between the
mainstream Democrats and the
‘“‘Dixiecrats’’ or conservatives;
Hart has the voting record of a
liberal but the image of a neo-
conservative for many political
commentators.

Considering Ferraro, there-
fore, really challenged the
preceding three fundamentals of
“presidential pairings.’”’ Her
New York background would at-
tract few voters in the South or
West; her liberal record makes
Mondale’s promises pale in com-
parison.

“T see Ferraro as liberal,’
Colvin said. ‘“You can’t put two
liberals on the same ticket. Any
woman will be perceived as a
liberal.’’

Nixon comes to the same con-
clusion but through different
logic. With regard to the
thoughts going through Mon-
dale’s mind as he settles on a
running mate, Nixon noted: ‘‘He
will bow toward the women, say
he’s considering one, will inter-
view them, and so forth, and will
not take one. The reason he will
not take one is not because he
doesn’t like (them), and not
because he doesn’t think they’re
qualified, (but) because he
thinks a woman on the ticket
isn’t going to help him. And it
wouldn’t.”’

“Hey, listen, it’s very heady
stuff,” Ferraro said in a recent
interview. “But I know full well

 

To the Editors:

You’d be hard pressed to find a
member of the Washington and
Lee community who does not
know what I look like, or how I
stand on the issue of coeduca-
tion, but this is not a letter extoll-
ing the advantages of an educa-
tion in a coeducational environ-
ment, so please don’t turn
straight to the Eat Beat, read a
little further.

Statistics indicate that I
disagree with roughly 60 percent
of the student body on a certain
issue. Anyone who knows me
will tell you that this is fine with
me. You see, I’ve examined the
points made by various people,
considered my own view, and
formed an opinion of my own,
subject to change. Now, when I
walk down the street, I often en-
counter those who possess an op-
posing opinion. The arguments
that they most often present in
their favor include: ‘‘Go to Hell,
Whitehead!” and, ‘‘You’re a ---
ing goose!” Some have asked
me, “Why don’t you ----ing leave
if you don’t like it the way it is?”
but they rarely stick around long
enough for an answer. You see
these statements are usually

made from moving autos or the

 

windows of buildings.

Not once has someone ap-
proached me and said, “I sup-
port the status quo because...”
I’ve approached a few people
who disagree with my opinion,
and it generally leads to a con-
structive argument, in a calm
tone of voice, and, I confess, I’ve
heard some good points in their
favor.

Gentlemen, and ladies, the sad
part of it all remains, many
would rather simply shut me up,
or chase me out, than allow me
toexpress my opinions. Now this
is still an institute of higher
education, dedicated to the
liberal arts. For it to succeed,
there must be a high level of free
thought, free expression and
listening. It’s been said that the
mark of a superior intelligence
is the ability to entertain two op-
posing thoughts in the mind at
the same time. I wish to propose
the following thought to my
fellow students: learn to listen.
When you can listen to what the
other person has to say, you will
be certain to learn something, if
only the weakness of their argu-
ment.

I close with my thanks to the
Mock Convention and its Steer-

Opinions and learning to listen

ing Committee for shutting me
up. Their simple act of censor-
ship brought my cause even
more favorable media attention

more prevalent. Then, the IFC
could have taken a longer look at
its new calendar and truly deter-
mined whether or not it solves
old problems or creates new
ones. I strongly believe that the
latter will ensue.

Thus, I urge students, first to
recognize their UC reps for next
year and demand of them not on-
ly obligatory attendance but also
voicing opinions of the various
classes. In this way, the UC, an
important forum of discussion
between students, faculty and
administrators, will be certainly
efficient and effective.

th only reason I’m on the short

t is because I’m a woman.”

In agreement is San Francisco
Mayor Diane Feinstein, another
oft-mentioned running mate for
Mondale.

“I think there is a good deal of
mouthing going on about a
woman veep,” Feinstein said
recently, adding that Demo-
cratic officials are not as open to
the idea as they sound.

All the arguments and reason-
ing against a woman make Hart
and Bentsen look all the more
likely. Some argue that Hart’s
real ambitions are for 1988, and
taking the number two spot on a
Mondale ticket gives him the
enigma of a loser or ‘‘fuddy-
duddy with a union label,’’ which
he won’t want in 1988. For uni-
ty’s sake, however, a Mondale-
Hart ticket would mean the
Democratic party could survive.

‘“‘In my view Hart would help
Mondale more than Bentsen,”
Nixon noted, ‘because he
reaches a broader constituency
in some of the critical states.”

But is it sane to expect a
Mondale-Hart ticket?

‘Well, they do have a capabili-
ty — on the Democratic side par-
ticularly — to get together. If
Johnson and Kennedy could get
together, I think they, too, could
get together,’’ Nixon said’ well
aware of the potency of the
Democratic ticket in 1960. ‘‘And
that would be a strong ticket.”’

Where does Bentsen fit into the
picture, especially since the

W&L Mock Convention drafted
him?

“Mondale has got to make a
decision as to how important
Texas is to him,” Nixon said,
“Bentsen...would help him in
Texas and Texas is a critical
state. Bentsen, however, would
not help him in other parts of the
country, particularly the Mid-
west. I think for a Mondale
strategy to succeed, he must
also concentrate on winning
states like Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Illinois, New York.
And there Bentsen would not
help him and Hart would.”’

What does all this show? Simp-
ly, politics is a complex
business, best left to odds-
makers to set odds and news
commentators to prophesy. It
shows the Mock Convention,
however, was indeed a realistic
exercise where these considera-
tions entered at some point in the
deliberations. Colvin sees that as
helping the authenticity of the
event.

“An interesting challenge was
raised by the nomination of Fer-
raro. It’s the paradox of nomi-
nating a woman at an all-male
school,” he said, noting that
various press reports concurred.
“Really, we had the best of both
worlds. The possible nomination
of a woman increased the
publicity given to the school
while at the same time, by
ultimately nominating Bentsen,
we are closer to what the na-
tional party will do.”’

W&L sparkles
at Mock Con

AOA TERRE RENE ERROR MERE NTA:
produced a more than over-
whelming result. The entire con-
vention, from the political
research to the parade, demon-
strated the potential of this
place. It is a shame and a
disgrace that so many faculty
thought it not worth their while
to attend — the same faculty
who complain about how
lethargic and apathetic we are.

I saw some faculty faces in the
crowd and some (mostly the
same) at the convention. To
those of you who attended:

Thanks for your support and in-
terest. To those of you who chose
not to: Why? The Mock Conven-
tion is one of the student body’s
opportunities to shine; it seems
that the faculty, of all possible
groups, would want to attend.

I do not say that the conven-
tion, however great it was, ex-
cuses academic and other ex-
tracurricular laziness. The con-
Vention was, however, a (once in
four years) time for the student
body to do something redeem-
ing. And it was spectacular. If
the faculty who are worried
about our seeming worthless-
ness had witnessed the conven-
tion, they would doubtlessly
have had their confidence great-
ly renewed.

The Mock Convention demon-
strated the capabilities of this
place. Perhaps it impressed on
the faculty and administration
who cared enough about us to at-
tend that less than drastic
measures are needed to make
the necessary reforms.

Mock Con exceeds organizers’ expectations

V-P nominee Bentsen says he has ‘ambivalent’ feelings about second spot

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Relaxing in the Mock Conven-
tion office earlier this week, co-
chairman Peter Muller looked
back at the two days he had been
planning for nearly two years.

“Before you could blink an
eye, it was over,” Muller said.

“I was so impressed by how
the convention actually came to
life and was so pleased with how
it actually ended up,” he added.

When Muller gavelled the con-
vention to a close Saturday at
3:57 p.m., the hard work he, the
other members of the steering
committee and the state chair-
men had done on the convention
had come to an end.

For the record, the convention
nominated former Vice Presi-
dent Walter F. Mondale on the
first ballot to be the Democratic
presidential nominee. Mondale
received 664 votes, seven more
than he needed, to 496 votes for
Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., and 133
votes for the Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson.

The vice-presidential voting, a
little more exciting, went to the
second ballot before Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, edged out

"JUST T0 BE THERE"

110 S. Jefferson St - Lexington, VA + (703) 463-3338

 

Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y.
Bentsen needed 17 votes from
the Colorado delegation, which
previously had supported Hart,
to go over the top with 666 votes
to 606 for Ferraro and 40 for Hart
before both California and New
York, a total of 210 votes, switch-
ed from Ferraro to Bentsen.

Bentsen said in a telephone in-
terview yesterday that he had
read about his mock nomination
in The Washington Post. “‘I en-
joyed it. I thought it was fun, and
I enjoyed the speculation,’’ he
added.

Asked whether he was in-
terested in being the vice-
presidential nominee for Mon-
dale, whom he supports, Bentsen
said, “The country could do
worse, and probably will. I have
not sought it and am not doing
anything at all in the way of
seeking it.”

“When one’s name surfaces
this early, reporters go to great
lengths to figure out why that
person should not get (the vice-
presidential nomination), and
someone else comes along,”
Bentsen added.

Bentsen said he had ‘am-
bivalent’ feelings about the
vice-presidential spot, noting

 

that Hubert Humphrey and Lyn-
don Johnson were ‘‘unhappy’”’ in
that role, while Mondale seemed
to have ‘‘a decent working rela-
tionship” with Jimmy Carter.
Bentsen added that serious con-
sideration also should be given
to a woman for the vice-pres-
idential nominee.

Bentsen said he agrees with
the Mock Convention’s selection
of Mondale on the first ballot,
and he said he expects the real
Democrats to do the same in San
Francisco. The four members of
the Senate who spoke at the
Mock Convention this weekend
‘“‘were impressed and, frankly,
amazed at the amount of work
and effort that obviously went in-

to the convention,’’ Bentsen add-
ed.

Each of the delegates at the
Mock Convention represented
three votes that will be cast at
the real Democratic National
Convention July 16-19 in San
Francisco.

Other highlights of the Mock
Convention, which has correctly
forecast the presidential nom-
inee of the party out of the White
House 12 times in 17 attempts
since 1908, included speeches by
Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb
and four United States Senators.

A portion of the platform
debate, scheduled for Friday
evening, had to be postponed to
Saturday morning because of a

Faculty may revote on

diploma for Dederick

A special faculty meeting may
be called to reconsider the deci-
sion to award a diploma to
William L. Dederick, a former
Washington and Lee student who
has been convicted of drug
charges.

The faculty voted last week
that a degree should be issued to
Dederick, who had completed
his. graduation requirements
when he was arrested last May
on charges of sale and posses-
sion of cocaine and possession of
marijuana with intent to dis-
tribute.

“I have had a formal request
from a faculty member that the
matter be reconsidered,’’ Presi-
dent John D. Wilson said yester-
day.

“‘T think frankly that there will

be another vote on that question
so that everyone will have a
chance to consider any addi-
tional information that may
become available,”’ he said.

Wilson said he was scheduled
to meet today with the faculty
member making the request. He
said that after the meeting he
would confer with Dean of
Students Lewis G. John, who is
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee, which suspended
Dederick from W&L for this
academic year.

The next regularly-scheduled
faculty meeting is the day before
Commencement. Faculty sourc-
es said that if another vote were
taken on the Dederick matter, it
would likely be scheduled for
early next week.

lack of a quorum Friday night.

That was one of only a few pro-
blems with the Mock Conven-
tion, though, Muller said.

He also cited the failures of
Mondale to make an acceptance
speech (Tad Devine, Mondale’s
chairmen of delegate selection,
filled in for him) and of the
scoreboard to work as minor
problems.

“Overall, everyone I talked to
seemed to be very pleased,”
Muller said. ‘‘It exceeded all my
expectations. Everything seem-
ed to flow so well, and the con-
vention itself wasn’t just a
tedious schedule of events; it
seemed to come alive.”’

Muller added that he was
pleased with the conservatively-
oriented delegates’ reaction to
the speakers, the platform and
the actual nomination and roll-
call voting process.

“The students did a good job of
playing Democratic,’ Muller
said. “Their enthusiasm grew
and grew. I think it pinnacled
with the  vice-presidential
nomination. ”’

Special to the Phi

Archaeology, excavation, ar-
tifacts. The mere mention of the
‘words leads one to conjure up
images of old men with pipes on
a quest to find missing treasures
buried deep beneath the deserts
of northern Africa or valuable
objects hidden in the ancient
ruins of the Aztecs, or the tomb
of Calcutta. Most other people
—people who have not patroniz-
ed the movies from Hollywood
excessively — may even dream
up images of old valuable ar-
tifacts being proudly displayed
in glass cases set up by the ar-
chaeologist, to be gazed upon by
all for posterity. But these im-
ages, as common as they may
be, are inaccurate, especially to
the students of Professor John
McDaniel’s 377 archaeology /an-
thropology field course, who are
in the midst of an extensive ex-
cavation in the High Hollows
below House Mountain, about
seven miles west of Lexington.

It’s 8:45 a.m., and while most
students are deliberating
whether to hit B period, students
taking ‘‘the dig’’ (as it is com-
monly called) find themselves
on their usual morning trek, car-
rying tools and other necessities
up an old, rugged path to sites
44RB143 and 44RB144. The
students are working on a dwell-
ing site, as well as a suspected
sawmill site located in the High
Hollows.

Arriving at the sites, students
split into their respective
groups. The smaller group will
travel an additional 100 yards to
the sawmill site, located off what
is believed to have been a log-
ging road.

Students work in trenches
about three by five feet with
usually two students to a trench.
Everything from leaves to com-
mon soil must come out of the
trench and be placed in a
separate pile commonly known
as a spoils pile.

“It is critical that the soil from
any one trench be distinguished
from other soil,” said Tim
Williamson. ‘‘Our whole purpose
out here is to map and record ac-
curately; if we fail then we’ve

Sprunt)

undermined the entire project.”

“An artifact’s worth to the an-
thropologist,”’ he continued, ‘‘is
based on its relative position to
other artifacts and features.”

Although the sawmill site has
produced few artifacts, it has
provided clues as to the nature of
economic activity the early in-
habitants engaged in.

“T’m really enjoying myself
out there,’’ said Jeff Sindler, a
freshman working on the site,
“Although we are not finding
many artifacts on the site, we’re
getting an idea of what an early
sawmill looked like.”’

As Jim Worthington, a fresh-
man working on the site, con-
tends, the sawmill site ‘‘obvious-
ly indicates that there was an
outside market for at least
lumber if not many other pro-
ducts.”

Although few artifacts may
exist, features in the soil, such as
coloration or texture, or holes
left by posts, can provide clues

 

yr

as well.

“The frequent anomalies in
the soil indicate that a sawmill
site existed here; for example,
certain patches of what appear
to be sawdust or ash have been
found,” said Denny Samuel,
another freshman working on
the site.

Unlike the sawmill site, the
larger site, believed to have
been a domestic dwelling, has
provided an abundant supply of
artifacts.

“‘We’ve been finding charcoal
pieces, horseshoes...and tobacco
tins,’’ said one student.

Another student described the
many types of ceramic that he
and his trench partner had
discovered. ‘From what we
have found, there are many
types of ceramics which indicate
that economic isolation was not
as common in these areas as was
originally thought.”

A second major aspect of the

in the lab. Students in the course
usually spend one day of the
week in the lab, analyzing ar-
tifacts and computing data.

“The lab lets us clean
everything, process it, and helps
determine dating,’ said Wes
Payne, a junior who supervises
the lab. ‘‘Also it helps us under-
stand mundane factors that
would otherwise not be known,
such as dietary consumption,
what types of utensils were used,
etc...,” he said.

“The process starts by
washing and cleaning the ar-
tifacts,” he continued. ‘‘They
are more accurately classi-
fied...into class and sub-class.
This helps to date the artifact.

and the site.”’

This data is then placed onto a
computer sheet and ultimately
stored in the computer, with the
artifact also being stored in an
accessible location if further
testing is desired.

But what are the overall im-
plications of the project? Pro-
fessor John McDaniel, who
heads the project along with Jim
Adams in the field, addressed
this question.

“Many oral histories and
reports suggest that these areas
were inhabited in the 18th cen-
tury.... We have found that this
is not the case.”’

‘‘Additionally,’’ he said, ‘‘we
are confident that we can use ex-
isting sawmill sites to compare
against the one that we are
presently excavating.”’

Archaeology provides the in-
formation that historians can-
not, due to the many inac-
curacies and sensationalism of
many local histories, McDaniel
said.

But at the same time
McDaniel notes that these inac-
curate histories are not meant to
be intentionally deceiving.
‘“‘When obtaining oral histories
from local residents we con-
tinually find that people want to
impress us with interesting facts
about their ancestors. Unfor-
tunately, the stories have been
around so long that they begin to
seep into local histories and
documents. This presents a real
problem for the historian.”

Inhabitants of the High
Hollows areas left no docu-
ments, McDaniel said.

An example of the value of ar-
chaeological field research can
be crystallized by Wes Payne. ‘‘I
remember when we were ex-
cavating the Liberty Hall site,
we found a map of the building
which had not been previously
known to exist. It gave us an idea
of what Liberty Hall actually
looked like.”

Estelle’s - a good alternative

One of the
hottest, quickest,

tastiest meals

in Lexington

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

Estelle’s Diner, on Randolph
Street next to the back entrance
of Leggett’s Department Store,
is at first glance easily dismiss-
ed. Because, let’s face _ it,
Estelle’s is not pretty. The type
of person who would go in
without ever having heard of
Estelle’s is either the pool-
playing, shower-a-week type, or
the adventuresome fellow who
does wild and crazy things spon-
taneously. But, just as you
shouldn’t do with blind dates
with great personalities, don’t
judge Estelle’s (the book) by its
appearance (the cover).

For at Estelle’s, one can get
one of the hottest, quickest,
squarest, tastiest meals in town.
Every day they have a choice of
two specials, both for $2.25. For
instance, country fried steak,
mashed potatoes, gravy, green
beans, rolls, iced tea or coffee,

and a piece of chocolate cake. It
comes piping hot within five
minutes and tastes home-
cooked, or better in my case
(just kidding, Momma). The
country fried steak was crunchy
on the outside, tender inside, and
covered with enough thick
brown gravy to have some left
over to dip the rolls into. The
mashed potatoes had just

Oar
The
Eat Beat

enough lumps to give them a
potato-like taste and texture, as
opposed to the gluey, maximum-
blend variety, which I don’t like.
The green beans seemed fresh,
not canned, and had little chunks
of ham in them. The cake was
good as well, with a thick layer
of chocolate icing. The only thing
I didn’t like was the iced tea,
because it was pre-sweetened.

Judging from the other time I
had the special, which was
turkey and dressing with rice
and gravy and green beans, the
$2.25 specials at Estelle’s are
always dependable and a good
alternative.

Estelle’s also has
cheeseburgers, foot-long hot
dogs, fried chicken, chicken

burgers, etc. I heard good things
about the cheeseburger, and
while it was good, the best things

about it were its price, a dollar,
and its good size.

Not just a place to eat dinner,
Estelle’s is the only place I know
of in Lexington where you can
play pool and drink beer at the
same time. The beer is cold and
inexpensive, and the pool tables
(there are two) aren’t missing a
single ball.

In the not-that-it-really-
matters-but-I-thought-I’d-
mention-it-anyway department,
Estelle’s is something of a VMI
hangout. Near the entrance, for
instance, there is a Confederate
flag with the words, ‘“‘VMI-
Never Say Die.”’ In fact, Estelle,
who I assume owns and who I
know runs Estelle’s, seems to
know most of the VMI students
(veemee’s is much easier), and
is maybe something of a sur-
rogate mother to them. My only
complaint with the veemees was
their jukebox selections, ‘‘Cum
on Feel the Noize” and a country

music adaptation of ‘‘Where’s
the Beef?”’

So if you’re down on your luck,
you don’t have much cash, and
you want a square meal or a
game of pool, head over to
Estelle’s. The hot meal, the
country music, the posters of kit-
tens with slogans like, ‘‘I think I
need a hug’’ and ‘‘Mama told me
there’d be days like this,’’ might
just do the trick.

Next week, the Eat Beat goes
nuts.

In polite deference to W&L

currently raking in millions for
his handiwork (let’s hear it for
capitalism), I won’t go into the
details about how unmemorable

anyone to repeat one sentence of

is one character who is some-
what amazing, despite the han-
dicap of speaking solely by
means of sound effects (I sup-
pose that’s why he was amaz-
ing). The remaining members of
the cast might have fared better
if they had spoken in sound ef-
fects as well (some things are
still sacred in Hollywood).

In light of the scintillating
review so far of Police
Academy, the only advice I can
give with a clear conscience to
the W&L moviegoer is to be loyal
to your fellow brethren and go
see the movie. Or if by chance
you can’t find time in your busy
spring schedule, give the three

goes on to say that “‘in movies,

ideas...a poetic original.”’

Jonah is a witty and lyrical
farce of people and politics, a
film that should be just the thing
for an evening in spring.

Hollywood producer
Paul Maslansky takes
classmates to the movies

Members of Washington and
Lee’s Class of 1954 were the
beneficiaries of a rare treat
when they returned to Lexington
this weekend to celebrate their
30th reunion.

One of their classmates took
them all to the movies. More
precisely, he took them all to his
movie.

Hollywood producer Paul
Maslansky is a member of that
W&L Class of 54. When he
returned to Lexington on Friday,
he discovered that his latest
film, Police Academy, was
playing at one of Lexington’s two
movie houses.

So Friday night Maslansky
and 40 members of his reunion
class and their spouses, along
with a few other invitees from
the school, presented
themselves at the State Theatre
box office, where Maslansky
proceeded to introduce himself
to the ticket seller and asked to
rent the theatre for a special 11
p.m. screening of his film.

After satisfying the skeptical
ticket seller by producing an ID
to show that he was, indeed,
Paul Maslansky, executive pro-
ducer of ‘Police Academy, he
and his classmates had the
theatre to themselves for the
special screening.

‘Athletes aren’t politicians....’

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...As the Russian boycott deal
begins to get very old and tired
— and it’s only been a week and
a half — here are some thoughts
on the state of the athlete in the
world and where he’s going...or
should we say, where he’s allow-
ed to be going. You can talk until
you’re red in the face — pun in-
tended — but last week’s news-
that-makes-you-feel-like-vom-
iting isn’t going to be turned into
a misprint. The pullout has been
called a_returning-the-1980-
Olympic-favor sort of action. No
doubt. Recent reports from
Poland say Moscow officials
mentioned the action as early as
November. So what is to be done
now? I think we need to go back
to Square One (friendly gather-
ing for athletic competition) for
the simple reason that we’re not
there at the present time. But
something tells me we can’t. It’s
not that we’ve forgotten what the
basis is for the Olumpic move-
ment. Rather, it’s that we’re
really not that ooncerned about
it. That is, at least when it comes
to something as unconnected to
athletics as world politics. (By
the way, we’re just as guilty,
given Southside Jimmy’s
blunderific move in 1980) I think
the Olympics has reached a
point of no return. What once
was a simple meeting of athletes
has now become a forever-en-
tangled meeting of nations and

their athletes. There’s a not-so-
subtle difference there that’s
manifesting itself at present.
Trouble is, when the big boys
play with athletes, they forget
the athletes and in the end

ime Out

they’re the ones getting hurt.
Athletes aren’t politicians.
They’re people who compete in
pursuit of perfection. It doesn’t
work to mix the two species.
Especially when the latter are

 

most enjoyable when left alone...

As we turn to the colonnade,
here’s a tip of the cap to the four
Generals who earned All-ODAC
baseball honors: Dave Warren-
feltz, who was selected to the
first team, and Mike Walsh, Bill
White and frosh Milam Turner.
Problem is, I wish I could extend
first-team kudos to White, but
those who decide such things
saw fit to leave the league’s best
ERA man off the first squad. But
then I guess those who continual-
ly meet the challenge, the clutch
performers, don’t make the list.
C’mon guys, credit where credit

is due...At least the ODAC boys
did not overlook the obvious
twice. They were quickwitted
enough to bestow — most de-
servingly — on John Lee Graves
the student-athlete of the year
award. And with John Lee’s
honor let’s not forget the effort

Frisbee:New club on sold ground after a year

The Washington and Lee
Ultimate Frisbee Club has con-
cluded its 1983-84 season and is
looking forward to next year and
to continuing the high level of
competition and enjoyment that
were present on this year’s
squad, according to outgoing
captain David Thompson.

The team, known as the Nades
— derived from their fair
weather practice site, the colon-
nade —competed against squads
from U.Va., Virginia Tech, Rich-
mond, Charlottesville, James
Jadison, William and Mary, and
Washington, currently the fifth-
ranked team in the country.

As many as 30 players par-
ticipated or practiced with the
team. Thompson pointed to five,
in particular, who led the travel-

ing team.

These included Mark
Machonis, whom Thompson
cited for ‘great hustle on

defense.’’ Thompson also prais-
ed the defensive skills of Steve
Carey. ‘‘He’s our big man, alsoa
great threat on the _ break-
aways.”

An offensive standout this
year for the Nades was Matt
Vawter, who ran the offense and
had an excellent throwing arm,
Thompson said. Vawter will be
taking over the reins as next
year’s captain.

Thompson also mentioned the
strong sidearm of Mel Cote as an
offensive key.

Ultimate is played with seven
players on a team. The field is 80
yards long with two 20-yard end

zones. Players try to score by
advancing the Frisbee across
the goal line via passes.

“The best part of the game is
its lack of officials.’’ said
Thompson. ‘‘Honesty in calling
the fouls is a crucial ethic in the

game.”

As the team looks to next year,
Thomspon said, ‘“‘We encourage
new players at any time.”’ In ad-
dition to its practice sessions on
the colonnade the team also
practices in the gym during the
winter months.

Kadesky, Rock, Stanford

senior field player Tim Rock,
and sophomore Tim Stanford.

This is the first year that W&L
has had more than one athlete
named to the AWPCA All-Amer-
ica team.

“All three are outstanding
water polo players, who have put
in the extra effort and have earn-
ed this award,” said W&L
aquatics director Page Remil-
lard.

“Rock would have made any
All-America team, on any level.
He was an intimidator on both
ends of the pool. Of defense, he
stopped the opponents key offen-
sive threat, ad and he was very
instrumental in our offensive
success,’”’ Remillard said.

‘‘Kadesky, while not as big as
most of the top goalies (he is
5’8”), was a standout all year.
He made the big saves, those
which stopped our opponents
before they could get their
momentum going,”’ he said.

“Stanford is a fast swimmer,
whose conditioning and personal
competitiveness made him an
extremely valuable asset as the
game progressed. In the late
stages of the game, he always
seemed to make the big plays,”’
Remillard said.

Rock earned second team All-
America honors in water polo in
1980, and is a two-time swim-
ming All-America, including this
year (as a result of his eighth-
place finish in the 1,650-yard
frestyle at the NCAA Champion-
ships).

Kadesky had been named to
the All-East Coaches team in
1982.

Stanford was a member of
W&L’s 400-yard freestyle and
800-yard freestyle relay teams
that earned All-America status.

 
Baseball: Murdock

Four All-ODAC, only one first team

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team placed four
players on the 1984 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference all-
conference team announced
Monday.

Senior shortstop and _ co-
captain Dave Warrenfeltz was
the only General to make the all-
ODAC first team.

Three Generals—senior first
baseman and co-captain Mike
Walsh, junior pitcher Billy White
and freshman third baseman
Milam Turner—were named to
the second team.

Based on these facts, one
would guess that W&L head
coach Jim Murdock would be
pleased with the selection of the
all-conference teams. Not so.
Murdock was surpriséd and
unhappy over the exclusion of
White from the first team.

The teams are selected by the
conference coaches, and Mur-
dock believes that ‘“‘politics’’ in-
volved with the selection kept
White off the first team.

“You'd think that grown men
could put away petty jealousies
and personal differences,’”’ Mur-
dock said. ‘‘We’re disappointed
for Billy, but we realize that we
hada good season.”

“I’m definitely not taking
away from our other players
who were selected,” he added.
“I think they all deserved what
they got.”

Warrenfeltz finished the
season with a_ .360 batting
average, second highest for the
Generals. He tied for the team
lead in RBI’’s with 17.

White finished the season with
a record of 6-2 and a scant ERA
of 1.09, best in the ocnference.
He batted .263 and saw a good
deal of playing time at third
base.

Walsh led the team in slugging
percentage at .524 and tied with
Warrenfeltz for the RBI lead
with 17. Walsh, who batted .302,
was second on the team in
fielding percentage at .970, trail-
ing only catcher Mike Jacoby,
who finished the season with a
.980 fielding percentage.

Turner led the team in hitting
with a .361 batting average and
was second in slugging percen-
tage.

Centerfielder Hugh Finkel-
stein was successful on nine of
his 13 stolen base attempts, tops
on the team.

 

Jacoby and White have been
named co-captains for the 1985
season.

“Considering the way we
finished the season — on a

positive note and with a good at-
titude —, I think it will help
tremendously next year,’’ Mur-
dock said. ‘‘We’ll be hard press-
ed to replace our seniors defen-
sively, but we have some good

Ueberroth ’S MisSION:
Stemming Soviet tide

By KEN RAPPOPORT
AP Sports Writer

The president of the Los
Angeles Olympic Committee, in
the face of Soviet insistence that
their pullout from the Summer
Games is ‘‘irrevocable,”’ says he
hopes to stem the ‘‘domino”’ ef-
fect of other nations joining the
boycott.

“We owe it to other athletes
from other countries who want
to be here to try and reverse ‘the
Soviets’ efforts to get others to
join them,” Peter Ueberroth
said Monday. ‘‘We’ll use re-
sources and we’ll use energy
because we owe it to the U.S.
athletes.”’

Ueberroth, also saying he has
not completely given up on the
Soviets coming to Los Angeles,
will try to get them to reverse
their decision at Lausanne,
Switzerland, on Friday, where
the International Olympic Com-
mittee has called an emergency
meeting. The Soviets have an-
nounced that they also will at-
tend the meeting, but their of-
ficials insist they won’t change
their decision to stay out of the
Los Angeles Games.

Ueberroth said Olympics of-
ficials had discussed the pos-
sibility of extending the June 2
deadline for declaration of par-
ticipation in the Games, but that
decision remained up to the IOC.

Asked what he will tell the
Soviets, Ueberroth replied:

“We will say some nice things
and we will say some coopera-
tive things, but we will also say
that we were insulted by some of
the things (they said), such as
that we would try to drug their
athletes.”

Ueberroth also expressed con-
cern about the list of boycotting
nations growing. Eight other

countries — East Germany,
Bulgaria, Vietman, Laos,
Mongolia, Czechoslovakia,

Afghanistan and Hungary,

 

which declared its intention not
to attend the Games yesterday
— followed the Soviets’ lead in
withdrawing from the Games.

“They are trying to influence
the better part of the globe,”’
Ueberroth said of the Soviets —
a charge that was denied Mon-
day at a news conference by
Marat Gramov, chairman of the
Soviet Union’s National Olympic
Committee.

Gramov also said, ‘‘We, in
principle, are against all alter-
native, parallel games, or any
other kind of games seen as a
counter-balance to the Los
Angeles Olympics.” But a Polish
journalist, who requested
anonymity, says sports officials
from the Soviet Union and its
allies met last week to discuss
organizing a  ‘‘counter-
olympics” and decided instead
to divide events among Com-
munist nations.

A sports official, who also
spoke on the condition that he
not be identified, said the com-
petitions would not be held at the
same time as the July 28-August
12 Los Angeles Games to avoid
conflict with the Olympic
charter, which specifically for-

bids counter-games.
The U.S. State Department on
Monday took issue with

Gramov’s statement that all
Soviet complaints about Olym-
pic preparations were ‘‘flatly
refected”’ at an April 27 meeting
in Washington.

State Department Counselor
Edward Derwinski said he was
puzzled by Gramov’s account of
what happened. The State
Department also took the
unusual step of releasing the text
of a document turned over to
Minister-Counselor Victor
Isakov of the Soviet Embassy by
Derwinski.

Derwinski said in a telephone
interview he emphasized U'S.
willingness ‘‘to cooperate and
communicate”’ with Soviet of-
ficials on Olympics matters.

passed by an 8-3 margin after a
lengthy debate. Green, junior
representative Bob Tomaso and
sophomore representative Ken
Lindeman opposed the motion.

Jenevein said that innocent
students still will use the right of
appeal and will win every time.
But not only do you want to get
guilty students out of the univer-
sity, but also you want to prevent
them from ever claiming affilia-
tion to Washington and Lee, Jen-
evein said.

Junior representative Cole
Dawson said that all the students
he has talked to have been in
favor of putting ‘‘expelled’’ on
the transcript, and EC Secretary
Jim Messer said alumni he had
talked to also supported the
measure.

Former EC President Bennett
Ross said that the goal of the

Huntley promoted at Best,
Lewis to step down June 7

Former Washington and Lee
President Robert E.R. Huntley
was named president and chief
operating officer of Best Pro-
ducts Co. Inc. of Richmond this
week.

Huntley, who was W&L’s
president from 1968 to 1983, has
been a Best executive vice presi-
dent and president of the com-
pany’s catalog showroom divi-
sion since January.

The move is the result of an
announcement by Best chair-
man and chief executive officer
Sydney Lewis, a W&L graduate
and trustee emeritus, that he
will relinquish his post on June 7.

He will be succeeded by his
son, Andrew M. Lewis, who cur-

honor system was to get dis-
honorable people out of the
school, not to mark someone for
life, which he said the addition of
“expelled’’ to the transcript
would do.

“Don’t change the system
because you think you’re not get-
ting enough convictions,’ Ross
advised.

Vice President Dave Judge
said that at present the closed
hearing had become meaning-
less because everyone the EC
convicts is going to an open hear-
ing.

Three of four students who ap-
pealed closed hearing convic-
tions this year have been acquit-
ted in open hearings.

Ross said the increased
number of acquittals in open
hearings this year was a fluke.
In the last five years, 50 percent
of the persons who appealed
their cases lost the open hearing,
Ross pointed out.

‘“T don’t think it’s a fluke at
all,” Jenevein said. “It’s a

rently holds the position Huntley
will assume.

Sydney Lewis, 64, will con-

tinue as chairman of the ex-,

ecutive committee of the com-
pany’s board. He founded Best
Products 27 years ago with his
wife, Frances, a member of the
W&L Board of Trustees. Mrs.
Lewis is an executive vice presi-
dent of Best.

For years, the Lewises have
been generous benefactors of
W&L. The law school building is
named for Mrs. Lewis.

Huntley could not be reached
for comment. ‘‘He’s been so tied
up in meetings I haven’t seen
him for three days,”’ his sec-
retary said.

trend. Anyone would be a fool
not to go public next year,’’ he
said.

Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers noted that once
a person is charged the good
standing clause on his transcript
is whited out, but no additional
notations are made on his
transcript even if he is convicted

in the open trial. There must be .

some discouragement from go-
ing to an open trial.

Sophomore representative
James White argued that if a
person knew he was guilty, the
threat of having ‘‘expelled’’ put
on his transcript if convicted in
the open hearing would dis-
courage him from appealing.

Lee Feldman, a member of the
White Book Revisions Commit-
tee, argued that the majority of
students who attend open honor
hearings believe many of the
defendants are guilty, but the
jury acquits them. Because of
this, many students see the
honor system as a ‘“‘joke,”’
Feldman said.

Feldman said that the average
student finds out about a case
before the open hearing, and
thus is disqualified from serving
in the jury. As a result, the
students selected for the jury
tend to be ‘“‘introverts’’ who are
‘not from the mainstream of the
university,’ Feldman argued.
These jurors are less likely to
convict someone than _ the
average student, Feldman said.

“If you make it a little more
trouble to go open, you give the
honor system a little more bite,”’
Feldman said.

In other action, the EC approv-
ed a measure that will give the
EC the option of getting a law
student to help them prosecute
open trials. Initially, the EC
passed the measure by a 5-4 vote
with two abstentions, but after a
—— to reconsider the
measure the EC passed it by a

6-3 margin.

general proposition’’ the jury
honored law enforcement of-
ficials’ stated desire that the
panel focus on dealers, not
users, of controlled substances.

He said that a copy of the in-
dictment recommendations had
been provided to Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
“John” Read, who requested
that the panel be formed and
acted as the main counsel to the
special grand jury throughout its
investigation.

“It’s not appropriate for me to
comment at this time,’’ Read
said.

The judge has not determined
what if any portions of the report
will be released.

“‘T feel that people who need to
be protected should be protected
as strongly as I think the Com-
monwealth ought to prosecute
those who need to be pro-
secuted,”’ Honts said.

“For that reason, as far as the
report is concerned, I would be
disinclined to issue blanket in-
formation that might involve in-
nocent people.’’

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce
Patterson said his office has
handled at least 200 subpoenas
for the special grand jury, about
10 percent of which were for
juveniles.

He said Read had also issued a
number of subpoenas, and that

 

the special grand jury had sum-
moned some _ witnesses _in-
dependently.

In addition, in November the
panel subpoenaed the long
distance telephone records for
the last two years of three
former W&L students.

In January, the special grand
jury subpoenaed certain student
records at W&L and VMI.

Patterson said the investiga-
tion resulted in ‘‘several feet”’ of
transcripts of the sessions.
Three large boxes containing the
panel’s working papers, exhibits
and transcripts and tape recor-
dings have been sealed and turn-
ed over to Honts.

According to Patterson, the
special grand jury held 27 ses-
sions at which witnesses ap-
peared, and an_ unspecified
number of additional meetings.
He said jurors were paid $20 per
session.

A county official said the total
compensation for the nine jurors
was approximately $6,300. By
law, all expenses of a special
grand jury are reimbursed by
the state.

Todd Jones, president of the
Rockbridge County-Buena Vista
Bar Association, said the com-
mittee that organization formed
in March to investigate ‘the
orderly administration of justice
in Rockbridge County,” had
not completed its work.

“When (White) left at 2:30
a.m., he secured the fire that
was in the fireplace, put water
on it and made sure it was out,”
Sutton said.

When the fire was reported at
4:45 a.m., it had engulfed the
east side of the house and had
burned through the roof.

“We know that it went from
nothing to a roaring inferno in
two hours and 15 minutes,” Sut-
ton said. ‘“That’s part of what we
looked at.”’

Gerald Simpson, special agent
with the Virginia State Police
Bureau of Criminal Investiga-
tions, said at the news con-
ference that the fire seemed to
be concentrated in the hallways
of the structure, among other
places.

Simpson said it is possible that
the person who set the fire was
unaware that the house was oc-
cupied. “We're hoping that was

 

Alex Castelli, president of the

mate, said that the arson ruling
was ‘‘a shock to think of.”’

“I was just waiting for the

“There were a lot of rumors go-
ing around..”’

Mark Wilkison, a field repre-
sentative of Phi Gamma Delta’s
headquarters, attended the news
conference.

‘*You’re dealing with someone
who doesn’t have the normal
thought patterns that we do,’”’ he
said. ‘‘We don’t go around burn-

ple. It’s a different mentality.”

through the Virginia Advisory
Committee on Arson Prevention
for information leading to ar-
