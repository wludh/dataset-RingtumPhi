Coed decision
to be delayed

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Copyright 1984 by The Ring-tum Phi

In a shift from previous
statements, University Presi-
dent John D. Wilson is now vir-
tually certain that a decision
regarding undergraduate coed-
ucation at Washington and Lee
cannot be made by the end of
this academic year.

Both he and James M. Ballen-
gee, rector (chairman) of the
Board of Trustees, agree that a
judgment on the coeducation
question probably will be made
sometime during the summer.

“‘T do not now anticipate that
there will be a May decision by
the Board,” Wilson said after
returning from a Monday
meeting with Ballengee in
Philadelphia.

It had been said earlier that
the Board of Trustees would
discuss the issue at its Feb. 4
meeting and vote on it at the
May 26 meeting.

It is now expected that those
gatherings will be used to study
the problem, with a final deci-
sion coming at a special session
during the summer.

“On a subject of this impor-
tance, it’s pretty clear to me
that a special meeting will be
needed,” Ballengee said by
telephone on Tuesday.

“It would certainly be no
later than mid-summer, and I
would hope the issue could be
resolved then.”

“It’s a tremendously com-
plicated issue with many conse-
quences no matter which way it
comes out,” Ballengee said.
“We certainly don’t want to
drag the issue out. It’s impor-
tant to let people who are apply-
ing know what the policy will
be.”

“l’m hoping that no later than
summer, we can know enough
to make a decision,” Wilson
said last week. ‘It would be

enervating for the university to
have the matter suspended in-
definitely.”

The rector said that special
sessions of the Board are rare,
but that ‘‘it has been done on

special occasions.”’

He said that a date for the
mid-summer session will be set
“tentatively” at the February
meeting, and “firmly” in May.

He reiterated that he expects ‘‘a
resolution’ of the question at
that summer meeting.

Ballengee said that the areas
of study will be decided in the
winter, and that preliminary
reports will be given in the
spring. ‘‘We’ll discuss it every
time we meet,” he said.

‘“‘We’re pretty well agreed on
the major outline of the
February meeting,’ Wilson
said Tuesday. ‘‘One session of
the Board meeting will be set
aside for consideration of
coeducation.

“First, we will have a discus-
sion with staff of various
aspects of the coeducation
issue.

“Later, the Board will go into
executive session. Without staff
present, the Board will try to
come to an understanding of
what steps would be most ap-
propriate to pursue.”

Wilson said that Bob Jene-
vein, who, as President of the
Student Body, attends meetings
of the trustees, ‘‘will be invited
to remain when the Board goes
into executive session.’ Alumni
Board of -Directors President
Peter A. Agelasto III will also
attend that session.

It is impossible, Wilson says,
to ‘‘prejudge”’ what studies the
trustees will initiate, He said,
however, that “it will be the
rector’s intention to use the
standing committee structure”

Huntley leaves for Best post

Former University president departs law faculty

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Robert E.R. Huntley, former
president of Washington and
Lee, has joined Best Products
Co., Inc., in Richmond in a
newly-created top admjnistra-
tive position.

Since January 2, Huntley, 54,
has served as a Best executive
vice president and as chief
operating officer of the catalog
showroom division.

The position, which is the
result of a recent corporate
restructuring, makes the 1950
Washington and Lee graduate
responsible for the retailing
firm’s 197 showrooms in 27
states.

Huntley has spent 12 years on
the Board of Directors of Best
Products, which was founded in
1957 by Sydney and Frances
Lewis.

Lewis, a 1940 W&L graduate,
served on the University’s
Board of Trustees until the end
of last year. At that time, his
wife was named to a post on the
Board.

The Lewises have been gener-
ous benefactors of Washington
and Lee. The law school
building is named in Mrs.
Lewis’ honor.

“It came as a surprise, ob-
viously, to me,” President John
D. Wilson said of Huntley’s new
position. ‘‘We’re going to miss
him here.

“‘He’s a young, vigorous cor-

porate lawyer who will bring a
great deal of talent and energy
to his new endeavor. He wanted
a new challenge, and | have a
great deal of sympathy for
that.’”’

Wilson said that the Lewises
had talked to Huntley about the
position when he left office, but
at the time he said such a
change would be ‘‘premature.”’
The Lewises, Wilson said, re-
newed the offer late last year.

Huntley is living in Richmond
during the week, and drives the
two-and-a-half hours back to
Lexington each weekend to join
his family, which will take up
residence in Richmond this
summer. His youngest daugh-
ter is a senior at Lexington High

Review and Outlook

 

 

Taking time

Of all the developments in the coeducation saga the
decision by President John D. Wilson and Board of
Trustees Rector James M. Ballengee not to vote on
the issue at the Trustees’ May meeting is perhaps the
most significant.

Although the issue of coeducation surfaced in a
Ring-tum Phi interview with President Wilson last
spring, the Board did not officially take up the ques-
tion until this past November. At that time Ballengee
said that he expected a vote in May. Up until this
latest development it seemed that this was the
timetable for voicing opinions and being heard.

This additional time will allow more voices to
emerge, especially from the alumni who seemed least
informed. Perhaps more importantly it will allow
people to free themselves from emotional reactions
and their initial reactions. In short there will be more
time for careful, considered thought. A decision af-
fecting a 235-year-old institution should not be made
ina matter of months.

We find it particularly reassuring to see that the
— is flexible enough to reconsider their previous
plans.

It is also essential for Student Body President Bob
Jenevein and Alumni Board of Directors President
Peter A. Agelasto to consider how they might best
represent their particular constituencies. It is equally
important for the students and alumni to make their
opinions known to their respective representatives.

There cannot be too much discussion as long as it is
informed, thoughtful and rational. It is necessary,
especially at this point for this intercourse to con-
tinue.

Cadavers:

Open discussion needed

Tothe Editors:

The members of the Cadaver
Society, both current students
and alumni, have noted with
some concern the manner in
which the issue of coeducation
is being discussed within the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty. Our particular concern is for
those members of the Universi-
ty community who are off cam-
pus and who therefore usually
do not have as immediate ac-
cess to information as do on-
campus students, faculty, staff
and members of the adminis-
tration. This lack of informa-
tion, of course, makes it ex-
tremely difficult to make a
reasonable decision on the
issue, and often has the effect of
making an alumnus susceptibie
to innuendo and rumor. Al-
though the Cadaver Society is
convinced that no member of
the Washington and Lee com-
munity would intentionally
mislead another membcr on
such a question as coeducation,
we fear that this will be the ef-
fect if the forum of discussion is
not broadened in the immediate
future.

The Society is pleased to note
the interview with President
Wilson on the issue of coeduca-
tion in the Nov. 3 issue of The
Ring-tum Phi. We are hopeful
that discussion of this issue will
proceed on the most open and

informed course as possible, a
course that the Society believes
is the only one appropriate for
members of the W&L communi-
ty.

Moreover, we wish to express
our hope that a decision to make
Washington and Lee a coeduca-
tional institution at the
undergraduate level — a deci-
sion which would, of course,
completely change the unique
character of the school — only
be made for the most compell-
ing reasons, While the member-
ship of Cadaver is actively sup-
portive of Washington and Lee,
we believe that before we can
support a move to coeducation,
all available studies must lead
to the unavoidable conclusion

EC erred in public honor policy statement

By BEN HALE
Phi Columnist

The Executive Committee’s
Nov. 14 decision to announce to
the public that selling drugs
could be considered an honor
violation was a grave mistake.
The decision was wrong over
and above the issue of whether
or not dealing is dishonorable.
The EC has no duty to announce
possible honor violations. In-
deed, it has a duty not to an-
nounce its views about honor.

To announce publicly that a
certain act may or may not be
considered dishonorable is to
violate the central procedural
theme of the Honor System.
That procedure not only in-
cludes confidentiality about the
particular case but confiden-
tiality about the entire honor

procedure. Announcing that
dealing drugs is dishonorable or
using drugs or rape or defacing
school property or drinking
under age or any of an infinite
number of construably dishon-
orable acts) is wrong and un-
necessary. The bottom line of
the Honor Code is that: “The
System applies to any conduct

Common

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

Despite the inability of the
Common Market to reach con-
sensus on the topic of
agriculture payments in
December, the European Com-
mon Market will not go the way
of the Zollverein of Germany of
the 1920s, according to history
professor J.D. Futch III. Futch
noted that despite past Euro-
pean attempts to achieve
economic and political unity
through the formation of
trading communities and politi-
cal governing bodies for part:
of the continent, the very fact
that the European Economic
Community has survived since
1957 is a good indication of its
ability to survive for at least
that long into the future.

The latest crisis of the Com-
mon Market came during the
Community’s December
meeting in Athens. With two-
thirds of its budget going
toward agricultural price sup-
ports and rebates for farmers in
the member countries, the
Common Market faces tremen-
dous financial catastrophe
whenever the topic of higher
supports arises. Such was the
December meeting.

The common agricultural
policy (CAP), which pays
farmers not to produce above a
given quantity, takes much of
its financial supports from the
British and West German tax-

considered dishonorable by the
student generation involved,”
(the “‘student generation” be-

ing represented by the EC, as.

the trustees of the honor
system). To specify particular
acts that may or may not fall
under the system is redundant;
all imaginable dishonorable
acts are covered by the code as
it is stated. With the honor code

My View

 

 

stated positively and open-
endedly. It is the students’
responsibility to ‘be honor-
able” rather than ‘‘not be
dishonorable.’’ Dishonor is
defined as it can only be
—through the circumstances
mitigating each individual
case. Theoretically a particular
EC could view bouncing checks
as dishonorable and the next EC
not. The important point here is
that the public’s general under-
standing and faith in the System

need not and should not be jaun-
diced or shaken by - explicit
knowledge of changing EC
views.

The EC does answer to the
student body (and the student
body only) through public
trials. But such open debate as
we’ve had lately about whether
the dealing announcement was
literally right or wrong
—whether dealing is or isn’t
dishonorable — should never
occur. The EC should not open
itself up to unnecessary debate
about its treatment of honor.
The EC should certainly not
participate in such open debate.
Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers’ well-inten-
tioned defense in the paper of
the dealing decision should not
have been written. The EC does
not debate or explain to the
public about its views on honor.
EC members should restrict
their official statements about
honor to private sessions. Once
entrusted with the Honor Sys-
tem, an EC member is in a
sense in a “sacred’’ position
—he doesn’t air the Honor
System in the newspaper.

If in this particular case the
committee sees fit to convict

someone for selling drugs, that
person can appeal to the public;
here and only here do the EC’s
honor views become __ public
ousiness. The EC also does not
answer to administration or
faculty. Any pressure from
Washington Hall to make a
statement about dealing should
have been politely and respect-
fully ignored. The EC does not
operate by precedents either; it
is not in any way constricted on-
ly by the consciences of its
members. Last year’s an-
nouncement might better have
been followed this year with a
statement that this ‘‘student
generation” does not make
public honor statements outside
the official Honor Code. Without
operating on precedents, the on-
ly continuity between EC’s is
the printed Honor Code. Public
statements ‘‘on the side’
weaken the absoluteness of the
code, which is quite sufficient
as is.

Besides calling the EC to un-
necessary public questioning
and dabbling foolishly with the
already comprehensive code,
announcing publicly what may
or may not be considered
dishonorable is more than un-

Market can look to past in

payers. With British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher
and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl both renowned for
their abilities to swing an ax
through budgets, talks of an in-
creased CAP budget met with
deserved ire. The group could
not come to a consensus and ad-

Europe. Many problems arise
with such aspirations.”

“There is a problem with not
speaking the same languages,’’
he noted. The December EEC
meeting was highlighted by
several chilly breakfast meet-
ings where Prime Minister
Thatcher and French Prime

in reference to the two world
wars. “‘Simply to be rescued is
to be put in an embarassing
situation. Needless to say, there
exists a comtemptuous at-
titutde by the French toward
the British.”’

“There exist other attitude
problems, also. The French

‘Unfortunately, the dream of a United States

of Europe has been relegated to flakes,

utopians and Napoleons.’

 

journed without issuing any
statement, the first time any
Common Market meeting has
adjourned as such in its history.
Talk in the European press
told of the impending collapse
of the trading partnership. Such
talk, however, does not ring
true in the ears of Futch.
‘Historically speaking,
anything could happen to the
Common Market,” Futch said.
“In considering the matter,
remember that the EEC was
hoped to be the first step toward
the political unification of
Europe, a United States of

Minister Francois Mitterand
said nothing to each other
because neither speaks the
other’s language.

The differences among
cultures and nationalistic
aspirations also arise.

“(French Prime Minister
Charles) deGaulle’s _na-
tionalism hurt the EEC in its
early days. There is, of course,
the strong antipathy of the
English by the French, though
this is quite intangible since the
French have been rescued by
the British two times in this cen-
tury in 1914 and 1940,” he noted,

note that spaghetti not only is
the national dish of of Italy, but
that it also resembles the
Italian national mind. Again to
the French, Spaniards refer to
maids kept at home,” Futch
said.

Such nationalistic differences
were not considered by the
pioneers of the modern Euro-
pean unification movement,
men like Italian Alcide
De’Gasperi, West German
Konrad Adenauer, or the
Frenchman Reubert Schuman.
These men, considered by
historians to be the fathers of

necessary, it is a huge step
toware a codified, legalistic
Honor System. One of the main
strengths of our Honor System
is its foundation upon ‘‘Honor,”’
not a network of dishonorable
acts. Honor systems that at-
tempt to specify dishonorable
acts and therefore ‘‘outline”’
Honor step into a bottomless
swamp. Honor isn’t a negative
concept. The University of
Virginia’s attempts to catalog
dishonorable acts — with
a list changing yearly —
make a joke of their honor
system. Being honorable be-
came an empty concept. Once
the EC succumbs to the need to
be specific and detailed, there is
no logical boundary (eg if deal-
ing, why not using and then why
not rape, etc.) Our EC should
not pass on to another EC this
dangerous need to codify.

I am not attempting to assail

_ our EC, I think it is doing an ad-

mirable job. (Besides, the deal-
ing mess was started by Ben-
nett Ross’s more experienced
EC, which should certainly
have known better.) I am mere-
ly pointing out a wrong step that
might be corrected — and not
repeated.

Crisis

the Common Market (The
“George Washingtons’’ of a new
group) never really figured the
factor of nationalism into the
equation.

Before these men, countless
others had struggled to see their
dreams of a unified Europe
come to fruition, Futch notes.
One nobleman of Hungarian
and Orietnal descent, Count
Coudenhove-Kalergi, spent
countless years after WWI on
the speaking circuit throughout
Europe stumping for a ‘‘United
States of Europe.’’ He was seen
by many of his time, Futch said,
as an “‘itinerant flake.”’

‘Unfortunately, the dream of
a United States of Europe has
been relegated to flakes, uto-
pians and Napoleons,” he
remarked.

Does Futch see the Common
Market being ruined in the near
future? No.

“There has been relative suc-
cess in both the Common
Market and NATO in that both
have survived as long as they
have. I expect that both will sur-
vive indefinitely. The wonder is
considering the brevity of inter-
national arrangements that
both have survived.”’

“The hope for a Union of
Europe is a utopian hope. In
post World War II Europe with
all its supra-nationalism, hopes
and dreams flourished. I’m
sure there may be some who
are tucked away in European
universities that hope for such a
Union, but I don’t think anyone
takes the notion seriously.’’

Former
students

sentenced

By DAVE JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

Three former Washington
and Lee University students
who were convicted of drug
violations have received
suspended sentences and proba-
tion in Rockbridge County Cir-
cuit Court.

Thomas J. Rohrig, William L.
Dederick and Marc A. Ham
were all given - suspended

sentences and 10 years’ proba-
tion by Judge George E. Honts,
Ill.

Rohrig, who was suspended
from W&L for three years
because of his conviction, had
pleaded guilty to possessing

marijuana with intent to
distribute.

Ham had been convicted of il-
legally possessing cocaine.

Dederick was convicted of il-
legally possessing marijuana
and cocaine.

All three were convicted of
felonies and are no longer at-
tending the university.

Another W&L student charg-
ed with drug violations, Charles
Phillips, is currently awaiting
trial for possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute. A trial
date has not been set.

Youth charged with murder

By DAVE JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A 17-year-old Rockbridge
County youth has been charged
with the murder of a 70-year-old
woman, and the rape and
shooting of another woman liv-
ing with her.

According to an account by
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds, Lillian Shover was
killed in her U.S. 11 house at
about 2 a.m. Dec. 27 after the
youth broke into her house.
Reynolds said that after

shooting Miss Shover, the youth
raped her 30-year-old house-
guest and shot the guest in the
back of the head before leaving.
The woman, a relative of
Shover’s whose name has not
been released, was treated and
later released from an area
hospital.

The youth, a Rockbridge High
School ninth grader whose
name cannon be released be-
cause of his age, has been
charged with six counts, in-
cluding murder, rape, sodomy,
malicious wounding and bur-
glary, according to Reynolds.

The day after the incident
Commonwealth’s Attorney Bev-
erly C. “John” Read filed a mo-
tion seeking the youth’s trial as
an adult, which would move the
trial from Juvenile and
Domestic Relations Court to
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court.

Virginia’s laws provide for
the trial of a juvenile as an adult
in most felonies, including
cases of murder, rape and
burglary.

No date has been set for a
hearing on Read’s motion.

GMU sweeps
debate tourney

George Mason University’s
debate team swept top honors in
both the varsity and junior var-
sity divisions of the 13th annual
W&L Debate Tournament at
Washington and Lee University
last weekend.

In addition, the George
Mason team won the Delta
Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha
Region III tournament which
was held in conjunction with the
W&L debate.

In addition to George Mason
and host Washington and Lee,
the one-day tournament in-
volved teams _ representing
Randolph-Macon College,
James Madison, VMI, Liberty
Baptist, the University of
Virginia, West Virginia
Wesleyan, Fairmont State Col-
lege and the US. Naval
Academy.

W&L debaters won several
trophies in the competition. In
the varsity division, Rob
Gresham, a sophomore from
Rome, Ga., and Chris Lion, a
sophomore from Ofallon, Ill., }
were awarded a third place
team award while Gresham
was awarded fifth place in the
speaker category.

In the junior varsity division...
Paul Smith, a freshman from
Gainesville, Va., and John
Buchanan, a junior from
Tallahassee, Fla., won third
place.

In addition, W&L freshman
Rick Graves of Gulfport, Miss.,
teamed with a Fairmont State
debater to win third place in the

favor of two 15-week semesters
or some other calendar.

The faculty surveys were

to Wise.

“We are still examining the
replies from the faculty, Wise

EC requests a fee increase

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
will recommend to the Board of
Trustees that the base student
activities fee be increased $5 to
$75 next year, with a further ad-
dition possible to finance the
proposed pavilion.

Dave Judge, EC vice presi-
dent made the recommendation
after reviewing general finan-
cial needs of the student
organizations for the 1984-85
school year. The $75 fee, which
still must be approved by the
trustees at its Feb. 3-4 meeting,
was recommended unanimous-

ly.

The proposed pavilion, which
also needs Board of Trustees
approval, will cost $250,000,
which the student body will be
able to borrow from the univer-

sity at a 9.5 percent interest
rate.

SAB Treasurer John Hay-
wood presented five repayment
plans to the EC Monday night.
The plans spanned 9, 10, 15, 20
and 25 years and would require
a per student annual cost rang-
ing from $15.42 over the 25-year
period to $24.37 over the nine-
year span.

terest rate was much better

elsewhere, recommended the
15-year plan, which would cost
each student $18.42 per year for
a total cost of $469,900.

That plan would give the stu-
dent government flexibility to
raise taxes for other needs,
Haywood said, and would not
put the student government too
much in debt. Also, he added,
the normal depreciation period
for any building is 15 years.

Without taking any definite
action, the EC, unanimously ap-
proved a ceiling of $25 per stu-
dent per year to pay for the
pavilion.

That charge would be added
onto the already-existing stu-
dent tax.

The Washington and Lee
Class of 1987 completed its first

average of 2.463 after the Fall
term. Huntley said the .144 dif-
ference was “probably not a
very significant falling off.”’

The Freshmen class ‘average
rose to 2.314 from the mid-term
average of 2.19.

A breakdown of departmental
grading showed that mathe-
matics courses were ‘“‘the ma-
jor villain, as usual,’’ Huntley
said. While this year’s
freshman had a slightly lower
average in math than the previ-
ous two freshman classes, they
did cope better than the current
seniors did as freshmen.

Although this year’s fresh-
men registered slightly lower in
their math, verbal and achieve-
ment scores than last year,
Huntley said he found “no
perceivable significant trends
or patterns,”’

Huntley said he did not know
what effect the new plus/minus
grading system might have
had.

Vlahoplus named Rhodes Scholar

John C. Vlahoplus, a 1983
graduate of Washington and
Lee, has been named a Rhodes
Scholar.

Viahoplus is one of 32 students
from throughout the nation
awarded the Rhodes Scholar-
ships, which sponsor study at
Oxford University in England
for up to three years.

A native of Columbia, S.C.,
Viahoplus is a first-year student
at the Harvard Law School.

Vlahoplus becomes Washing-
ton and Lee’s 13th Rhodes
Scholar and the fifth in the past
12 years. The last W&L student
to win a Rhodes was Edward A.

Johnson in 1980.
Rhodes Scholars are chosen

on a regional basis in the United
States. The candidates are
judged on intellectual achieve-
ment, character, leadership
and physical vigor.

An economics major as a
W&L undergraduate, Vlahoplus
will study international politics
and international law at Oxford.

Vlahoplus received the bache-

Plus/minus
makes debut

By ERIC CAMPBELL
Staff Reporter

After the first term of grading
under the plus/minus system at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, the new system seems to be
on the road toward acceptance.

In an informal poll conducted
for The Ring-tum Phi, the ma-
jority of students interviewed
felt the system will benefit the
students in the long run.

Don Richardson, a_ senior,
remarked, ‘‘In all it’s a better
system...it breaks things up bet-
ter. It’s more competitive.”’

A poll conducted earlier this
year by the Executive Commit-
tee showed 83 percent of the
sophomores, juniors and
seniors were opposed to the new
system.

Twenty-seven of the 50
students interviewed received
more minuses than pluses on
their fall grades. Twelve
students were unaffected by the
new system, and 11 students
received more pluses than
minuses.

A majority of the students felt
the system helped them even
though they received a minus
instead of a plus. These
students felt their grades were
in limbo between, for example,
aBoraC grade.

There was a _ consensus
among the students interviewed
that the hard-working student
would benefit from the new
system. Most students agreed

the professor has a much
greater ability to reward the
hard worker and not the less
diligent student without drop-
ping the grade a full letter.

Rand McClain, a_ senior,
voiced the opinion of quite a few
of the students interviewed. ‘1
don’t like the system at all.., but
in the long run it will all
average out.”’

Some students felt stronger
about the system. ‘‘I hate it...it
stinks. I would have made the
Dean’s List (3.0 grade-point
average) without it,” senior
Marty Bechtold said.

Dean Atwood, a strong sup-
porter of the new system and
president of the faculty, said he
was surprised when he took a
look at his final grade spread.

“I ended up giving out more
pluses than minuses,”’ he said.
‘‘T was surprised because, when
I figured out the overall G.P.A.
of all my grades, the new
system brought up that
average.”’

Another common opinion was
expressed by Alex Castelli, a
sophomore, ‘‘The new system
hurts people with As but it helps
people with Bs and Cs.”

Ricky Zahn, a sophomore,
summed up several students’
feelings rather well.

“I don’t like the. system, but
overall it is more important
what the faculty feels. They are
the ones giving the final
grades.’’

 

‘In all it’s a better system...

it breaks things up better.

It’s more competitive.’

IFC probes Pika incident

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A decision concerning a
pledge-fraternity activity in-
volving Pi Kappa Alpha has
been remanded to the Inter-
fraternity Council Judicial
Board from the Student Affairs
Committee after new facts
about the ase arose at an SAC
meeting Wednesday. The SAC
decision to remand the judg-
ment followed an IFC Judicial
Board original ruling of two
weeks’ social probation last
Thursday

The activity at the center of
the ruling, which occurred in
early December, resulted in
medical attention for two
freshmen pledges; one for a
broken leg and a second for
severe intoxication.

One pledge suffered a broken

leg when he and a group of
pledges were cutting down a
Christmas tree. The freshman
broke his leg attempting to
dodge the tree as it fell, accord-
ing tosourccs.

In the second incident, an
Emergency Medical Service
team examined a freshman
after he returned from the
fraternity to his dormitory in a
severely intoxicated state.

The IFC is scheduled to meet
Tuesday, Jan. 17 to reconsider
the case with the new informa-
tion, the nature of which Dean
John did not disclose.

The SAC will consider the
IFC’s recommendation the
following day, Jan. 18, Dean
John said.

According to IFC President
Emery Ellinger, Pika has
already begun its two-week pro-
bation period despite the IFC’s
reconsideration of the case.

C denies IU tunds

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

“Unless you have something
tosay, I don’t think you’re going
to get a dime,” Executive Com-
mittee President Bob Jenevein
told Jim Sarle and Joe Cadle,
founders and chairmen of the
Independent Union, Monday
night.

Indeed, Sarle and Cadle
received none of their $623.40
request to fund the Independent
Union for the remainder of the
year.

‘“‘We have no money,” Sarle
said, adding that next
September the Independent
Union’s expenses may be added
to either Dean Mike Cappeto’s
or Dean Lewis John’s budget,
instead of the EC-controlled stu-
dent tax fund.

Despite the claims of lack of
money and high participation,
though, no motion was made to
grant the Independent Union
any money. Requests for funds
must be submitted to the EC a
week in advance.

Because the EC doesn’t give
any money to fraternities,
junior representative Darby
Brower said, “I would find it
impossible to give y'all any
money.”

Sarle pointed out that this
would just be one grant and
“then we’ll be off your back”
and added that fraternities
receive support from their na-
tional chapters and from the
university.

“What we’re asking for here
is the basic hardware that we
need to get this organization go-
ing,” Cadle said. “We need a
chance, if we want to get roll-
ing. We can’t continually go to

- for money.”’

The Independent Union’s re-
quest included money for fliers,
telephone, newsletters, sta-
tionery, stamps, a letter to in-

' coming freshmen and miscel-

laneous expenses.

“It seems like we’re creating
a second SAB,” freshman rep-
resentative Andrew Caruthers
charged.

Cadle and Sarle defended that
charge by noting that no student
taxes would be used to sponsor
social events. However, they
also admitted they had never
met with the SAB to discuss
combined social events, and, in
fact, the two organizations have
scheduled bands in the Cockpit
for both Friday and Saturday
night this week.

Cadle criticized the SAB by
saying, ‘‘They’re not doing their
job, in my personal opinion.”

Other members of the EC
said the Union should collect
some kind of dues before. re-
questing EC funds. Len
Howard, secretary and the lone
undergraduate independent on
the EC, said ‘‘I really think the
Independent Union would be
better off working strictly
among the independents.”’

Jenevein encouraged the
Union to work with the SAB and
to collect money from the in-
dependents.

In other monetary action
Monday night, the EC approved
unanimously a $500 addition to
the W&L Political Review
budget for publication of a se-
cond issue.

Reporting on the EC finances,
vice president Dave Judge said
$2,000 remained in the funding
account and $7,363 in the

     
     
   
     
  

463-3106

reserve account. ‘We seem to
be fairly strong in those two
areas financially,” he said.

The EC also scheduled a poll
on coeducation for Friday, Jan.
20. Jenevein reported that the
Board of Trustees would be tak-
ing a genera! survey of student
opinions about what students
think the general nature. of
Washington and Lee should
be.”’

Also Monday night, the EC:

— Voted to ask the faculty
committee on Courses and
Degrees to re-evaluate the allot-
ment of only one credit for Com-
puter Science 100.

— Formed a subcommittee to
investigate the possibility of
hiring a secretary — to be paid
for by the administration — for
student organizations.

— Heard a report from senior
representative Jim Messer on
the possible addition of lights in
the lower parking lot and along
Jefferson Street. Messer said
he’d talked to Mayor Charles
Phillips and that the item might
be on the agenda of a future City
Council meeting.

— Announced that interviews
for the position of Voting
Regulations Board chairman
will be held next Monday.

Law students pen
rights legislation

By MIKE HUDSON
Special to the Phi

As Mike Shaffer and Tom
Howell sweated out their fall-
term exams this month at
Washington and Lee University
Law School, they must have
drawn some comfort from the

' fact that they’ve already ac-

quired some experience in the
law. By writing it.

If the Virginia General
Assembly cooperates next year,
their draft legislation could
become state law.

Last summer as interns at
W&L’s Lewis Law Center, the
two Lexington residents helped
draft the Virginia Human
Rights Act. If approved by the
legislature, the act would
establish a nine-member Vir-
ginia Commission on Human
Rights.

The Virginia Advisory Com-
mittee to the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission asked the law cen-
ter to write the act, which con-

‘solidates federal and state

discrimination complaints.
Adding the existing federal
laws to Virginia law will ensure
that the federal goverment will
reimburse the state or local
goverments for any cases han-
dled by the Virginia commis-
sion or by local commissions,

- also provided for under the act.

Shaffer, Howell and Thomas
A. Rutherglen, a law professor
at the University of Virginia,
divided the duties of writing the
act three ways: Shaffer took the
section on enforcement and set-
ting up the commission; Howell
took the section on housing and
public accommodations; Ruth-
erglen took the section on em-
ployment practices.

Three W&L law professors
provided advice and supervi-
sion.

“It was a nice job for the sum-
mer,” Howell said. ‘Usually

law students don’t get much op-
portunity to have a hand in
anything as momentous as this
:.. Its great to be given a pro-
ject where you start with a
clean slate, and all of a sudden,
you call the shots about how you
want to put it together.”’

Writing the act began with a
month’s research on human
rights acts in more than 30 other
states and on a model act writ-
ten in 1966 by a national con-
ference on encouraging uniform
state laws.

The researchers also studied
legal challenges to the state
acts, which have been numer-
ous.
“A lot of other people have
been trying to clarify the laws,”’
Shaffer said. “It’s been good
that other cities and states have
been working on this. The ’70s
were a good time for civil rights
law.”’

In addition, they sought ad-
vice from the state advisory
committee, the Virginia Equal
Employment Opportunity Com-
mittee and members of Virgin-
ia’s only two local commissions
in Fairfax and Alexandria.

Three drafts have been writ-
ten. After a conference last
month in Richmond at which
several human rights groups
suggested changes, the act will
probably see even more revi-
sions either before or after it is
introduced in the - General
Assembly this winter.

“If the act gets its foot in the
door and actually gets serious
consideration from the General
Assembly, there are going to be
certain trade-offs,’ Howell
said.

Both students said they
thought the act’s chances for
approval were good. State Sen.
Douglas Hilder, D-Richmond,
has failed in earlier attempts to
create a state human rights
commission.

School.

“Tl miss Lexington and
Washington and Lee. I’ve been
there too long not to. I'll be
visiting there often — you can
be sure of that,”” Huntley said in
an interview yesterday from
Richmond.

President Wilson’s recent
report on the coeducation ques-
tion states: ‘“‘Bob Huntley has
been quoted as having once said
that we ‘should not persist in of-
fering a choice that no one
seems towant.’”

Frank Parsons, who is ex-
ecutive assistant to President
Wilson and served Huntley in
the same capacity, said that
Huntley made the remark in the
fall of 1968 at his first Parents’
Weekend as president.

“T never heard him differ
from that view,” Parsons said.
‘“‘What he meant was that we
could not afford to go out of
business offering something
which was traditional yet
undesirable.’

“‘As long as Washington and
Lee could maintain a healthy

admissions environment and
good students. wanted to exer-
cise this alternative, there was
no need to change. But he
thought it would be regrettable
if a school of the character of
Washington and Lee went out of
business because no one wanted
tocome here.”’

Huntley said in the interview,
“It’s the kind of thing that has
to be thought about. That sim-
ply asks the question — it
doesn’t answer it.”’

He said he would not be in-
volved with any of the forth-
coming studies on undergradu-
ate coeducation. ‘I’m staying
away from that, as you might
imagine,” he said.

Wilson succeeded Huntley as
president last January. At the
time that Huntley announced
his resignation after a 15-year
tenure, he said ina statement:

“‘T have achieved as muchas I
can achieve. The achievements
that have occurred here are
quite strong and commendable.

It seems to me that it’s time for ‘

a new president.”’

James M. Ballengee, rector
of the Board of Trustees, said,
“It is my personal view that
President Huntley has been the
most outstanding president of
Washington and Lee since
Robert E. Lee.”’

After Wilson took office,
Huntley returned to the law
school, of which he once served
as dean.

This fall, he taught corporate
finance to 40 second and third-
year students, which he said
was “a very pleasant ex-
perience,”’

Law School Dean Frederic L.
Kirgis Jr. said that Huntley was
“very well received” as a pro-
fessor.

Word circulated this fall that
Huntley was being considered
as a Republican candidate to
oppose Congressman James
Olin of the 6th District in Nov.
1984.

Huntley quickly quashed the
rumors: ‘Politics and running
for office have not and do not in-
terest me,” he said at the time.

 

Wilson

(continued from page 1)

for this research into the
coeducation question.

The committees involved
would likely be academic af-
fairs, budget and audit, plan-
ning and development, and a
proposed university life com-
mittee.

Expected studies, Wilson
said, include effects on the
recruitment and admission of
students, a physical space in-
ventory, and further extension

of the demographic data to the
year 2000.

‘‘T will be very surprised if the
Board does not commission a
large survey of alumni and the
students,” Wilson said last
week.

“In the spring, they’ll be
seeking fuller responses, more
than a simple expression of sen-
timent about the question’ such
as that obtained earlier this
year in a poll by the Executive
Committee of the Student Body.

jor task will be to get ‘‘as clear
an idea as possible of what
Washington and Lee truly is.
What is this university, in
essence?’’

He said they will also have to
determine ‘‘how the male condi-
tion affects the mission and
character of the university.”

That type of appraisal, Wilson
says, is the first step. More
specific studies will then follow.

“If you can get past the in-
tangibles — what impact it will
have on the Washington and Lee
experience, positive or negative
— these things can be quan-
tified,’ he said in December.

As an example, he cited the
cost of renovating or construct-
ing dormitories. He said that’s
not a critical matter, however.
“TJ have a feeling that, over
time, we should build more resi-
dence halls into our planning
anyway,” he said.

“That’s not associated with
coeducation. It’s part of my
conception of a residential set-
ting where we live and work
together.’”’

Because ‘“‘women don’t take
up any more space then men,”
Wilson said it’s possible that
“no physical developments’’
would be needed with a move to
undergraduate women.

However, citing ‘physical
education and playing fields,”’
the President said, ‘‘perhaps
that’s a little naive. I’m sure
we’ll find changes which will
have tobe made.”’

In preparation for the
February meeting, Wilson said
that the trustees will be sent
copies of letters he has received
from the faculty on the question

Architect restores London

Charmian Lacey presents slide lecture

By TED LeCLERQ
Staff Reporter

To those who spend time with
Charmian Lacey, it is impossi-
ble not to become engulfed in
her effervescent child-like love
of life. And like so many suc-
cessful professionals it is dif-
ficult to determine where her
funloving ends and her serious
attitude about her work begins.
Perhaps there is no difference.

In her position as London’s
superintending architect of
Special Services, Ms. Lacey has
breathed life through restora-
tion back into such aged, well
known buildings as Big Ben,

The House of Lords, Buck-
ingham Palace and Westmin-
ster as well as stuffy, creaking
castles across the foggy fields
of Great Britain.

In a slide lecture last Thurs-
day, sponsored by the W&L
department of fine arts and the
University Lecturers Commit-
tee, Ms. Lacey detailed the dif-
ficult but rewarding, relation-

Ship between the buildings and

her ‘‘clients’’ who inhabit them.
‘“‘The work that we do is com-
plex,” Ms. Lacey said. ‘‘In

terms of people, our buildings _

are occupied by very vocal,
knowledgeable, demanding and
sometimes important people.”

 

she contends. :

Although taking on such huge,
cavernous structures could in-
timidate an ordinary architect,
Ms. Lacey draws nothing but
satisfaction from tackling such
jobs.

“Sometimes these people who
occupy these buildings find that
they are inhibited by the
buildings themselves,’’ she
said. “It is part of our skill to
turn that from an inhibition to
an enrichment and a delight
and once one’s clients love their
buildings, our task is very much
simpler.”

Despite the exciting respon-
sibility of overseeing work on
the Crown Historic buildings in
London, Ms. Lacey feels her job
can become quite hectic with
some of her clients.

“There comes a moment
when you decide that patching
will no longer do.’’ Ms. Lacey
said. ‘Then you must get
together a great deal of money
and disrupt your clients for
several years.”’

‘*Yet the most important part
of our work — even though
some of the firms we deal with
don’t understand it at first — is
getting the restoration done
without attracting attention to
it,’ Ms. Lacey said.

In dealing with castles that
are hundreds of years old, Ms.
Lacey constantly encounters
problems of outdated archetec-
tural techniques and obsolete
building materials. In some
cases, deterioration of buildings
is not simply due to the ravages
ot time. She spoke of one castle
which required buttressing
after the second World War.

“The large series of six glass
domed building, which were
damaged by flying bombs in the
war, were designed by a Major
Halkes,” Ms. Lacey said. ‘‘Yet
the difficult part is that they
have gutters five-feet deep and
one-foot wide that need to be

cleaned out,” she continued.

“We haven’t got the money
yet, but we’re working towards
it,’”’ she said.

Ms. Lacey said one of her
most interesting projects has
been the recent restoration of
the House of Lords.

“They had put off letting us
have the building until a big
piece of the roof fell where they
would have been sitting. Lucki-
ly, they weren’t in session that
day,’’ she said.

‘‘The men who were restoring
the ceiling were puzzled at first
about what had caused it to give
way. They then discovered that
the weakness was caused by
great heat from. glass

chandeliers over 80 years ago.”’

Ms. Lacey said.
Although the cleaning of the

House of Lords displaced them

for several years, Ms. Lacey
noted interestingly that the re-
cent cleaning of Big Ben took
much less time.

While most professionals gain
self-motivation from _ the

Satisfaction of having their
work noticed, quite the opposite
is true for Ms. Lacey and her
crew of expert craftsmen and
architects.

“The object of our work, I
hope, is that no one sees what
we have done, but that it looks
very much better.”” Ms. Lacey
Said.

Film Society to show ‘Amarcord’

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present ‘‘Amar-
cord” (Italy, 1974), directed by
Federico Fellini at 8 p.m. on
Friday, Jan. 13 and Saturday,
Jan. 14 in Classroom ‘‘A’”’ of
Lewis Hall in the Law School.

There is no charge for admis-
sion and the public is invited.
The film is in Italian, with
English subtitles.

Said by many to be Fellini’s
most accessible work, ‘‘Amar-
cord” is at once sentimental
and surreal. The story is based
upon the director’s recollec-
tions of growing up in a small
Italian town during the heyday
of Mussolini. To risk a stale
cliche, ‘‘Amarcord”’ is highly
spiced with both sugar and salt;
Fellini is not making a ‘‘sad”’
story or a “‘happy’’ story, but
one in which the viewer will find

varying degrees of those two ex-
tremes.

A translation of the film’s title
might be ‘I remember.”’
“Amarcord could have been
subtitled ‘‘A Year in the Life of
a Town and Some of Its Peo-
ple.” The town in which “Amar-
cord’ is set is similar to small
towns everywhere, even to our
own Lexington. The faces of the
characters may not be familiar,

 

but many of the personalities
will be. In all likelihood, the
viewer will be able to identify
with at least one of the charac-
ters, whether the connection be
in the past, the present, or in
one’s dreams.

“Amarcord”’ is a feast for the
eye and for the imagination and
the Film Society invites all
—Fellini fans and others — to
attend this marvelous presenta-
tion.

Trustee Emeritus dies

Mrs. Christine Hale Martin, a
trustee emeritus of Washington
& Lee, died Friday, December

16, at her home in
Gloucester, Virginia. Mrs. Mar-
tin was elected a trustee in 1978

and retired as trustee emeritus
in 1981.

A funeral service for Mrs.
Martin was held Monday, Dec.
19. Burial was in the cemetery
of Ware Episcopal Church in
Gloucester.

Stene sculpture and prints

in duPont this month

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

W&L professor Larry Stene is
showing a collection of his work
in sculpture and prints in the
duPont Gallery this month.

The exhibit includes 16 prints
and drawings and eleven mixed
media sculptures representing
Stene’s developments in style
and subject matter since he
came to Washington and Lee in
1982. The character of the show
is primarily bucolic with tones
of brown and orange com-
plementing natural materials
such as wood, cloth and twine.

Highly representative of
Stene’s work is the central
sculpture piece, ‘Red/Green
Shift,” 1984. This heavy pine
structure emphasizes contrasts
of color and form found in
nature. Alternating beams are
dyed red and green while the
whole piece rests askew in a
tense but inviting balance. The
subdued contrasting colors
mimic the autumn leaves, and
its massive size and precarious
position reflect the rural en-
vironment of the artist’s home
in Rockbridge County. His
abstract prints and drawings
also carry a pastoral theme
with the use of (natural) tones
and shapes. Together with the
sculpture pieces they show an
interesting development over
time of his intellectual and
visual themes.

Professor Stene has taught
sculpture and print-making at
W&L for the past year and a
half since joining the faculty in
the fall of 1982. This is the first
exhibition of his work in Rock-
bridge County and it will re-
main in the Gallery through the
27th of January.

He has noted that, unlike the
independent artist who works
within an open time schedule,
the ‘“‘artist-educator’’ must
create in “chopped up” time
segments.

According to Stene, such
scarcity of ‘‘pure time” causes
him to work in a faster manner
that is more responsive to basic
materials. That, he adds, re-
quires ‘“‘the courage to be im-
perfect” — a willingness to ex-
periment and ‘rely on one’s
own innate skills, judgment and
wit to produce work under the
constraints of the profession.”

A native of Minnesota, Stene
received his bachelor’s degree
from Moorhead State College
and his master’s from the
University of Illinois.

He was assistant professor in
the art department of Bemidji
State University in Minnesota
prior to joining the W&L faculty
as assistant professor of art in
1982. His work is represented in
the Cooley Collection in Peoria,
Ill, and in private collections in
Minnesota, Illinois and
Virginia.

Theatre plans six
winter productions

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

Six student-directed produc-
tions will be offered this winter
by the Washington and Lee
drama department, including
one play that doesn’t even have
a title yet.

The untitled play, which will
be directed by senior Bob
Ferguson and is being written
by senior Ted Petrides, will be
performed in the Boiler Room
Theatre Feb. 3-8. Set in a
Virginia juvenile detention
home, the play focuses on the
victimization and social label-
ling of minors in the correction
system. Petrides has done ex-
tensive research on the subject,
and has worked as a volunteer
in a juvenile home in Rock-
bridge County.

Petrides will take the script
directly from improvisations
performed by the cast.

“It’s a very natural process
within theatre work, but uncom-
mon at W&L in the last several
years,” he said. The players are
“doing everything a playwright
has to do in order to write a
play,” he said.

Two one-act plays, Woody
Allen’s ‘“‘Death Knocks” and

“The Informer’ by Bertold
Brecht, will be performed Feb.
8 and 9 at the Troubador
Theatre as part of Dr. Albert
Gordon’s directing class. Brian
O’Riordan, a junior, will direct
“Death Knocks,” a play in
which he says ‘‘Allen is reduc-
ing death to a comic situation:
two old Jewish men playing gin
rummy.”

Junior Chris Lillja says he
chose to direct ‘‘The Informer’
because it’s 1984. There is an in-
creasing amount of personal
surveillance by the government
and others. Brecht gives us a
warning that is as clear today
as it was in Germany during the
late 30’s: ‘‘No one is safe.”

The two other members of the
directing class, Larry Butler
and George Weatherly, will pre-
sent their one-acts March 28
and 29 in the Boiler Room.

The other major production of
the winter term will be Ten-
nessee Williams’ ‘“‘Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof,” which will run
March 23-28 at the Troubador.
Drew Perkins, a senior, will
direct. Auditions are open to the
public and will be held Jan. 18
and 19 at the Troubador.

Generals take Tournament title

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

After a 1-1 West Coast road
trip over Christmas break,
the Generals’ basketball team
returned to Warner Center last
weekend and captured the W&L
Invitational Tournament, rais-
ing the team’s record to7-4.

In California on Dec. 20, W&L
defeated the College of Notre
Dame, 58-46. Senior forward
John Lee Graves led the Gener-
als with 14 points, followed by
junior guard Lex Fitzenhagen

with 13.
Two days later the Generals

bowed to Stanislaus State, 88-79.
Graves again led the team with
a career-high 32 points.

“We got a great deal out of
the trip, besides playing two
good basketball teams,’’ said
head coach Verne Canfield.
‘“‘We were exposed to some
outstanding competition.
Stanislaus State was an ex-
cellent team. They play basical-
ly a Division II schedule.”

After a week’s rest and a
week’s practice, the Generals
hosted the W&L Invitational,
which Canfield called ‘‘the
strongest tournament that W&L
has had in my 20 years here. All

three teams that are coming in ©

are proven entities — none is a
patsy — so we will have our
hands full.”

Against Dickinson College
Friday night, the Generals fell
behind 14-6 after six minutes,

 

_day night. The Generals tri-

then closed the half outscoring
the Red Devils 24-6 for a 30-20
halftime lead. W&L never look-
ed back in the second half and
won going away, 64-48.

The game’s statistics reveal a
classic Canfield coaching job.

A tough W&L defense held
Dickinson’s Ted Kirkpatrick,
who averages 22.3 points per
game this season, to eight. No
Red Devil scored in double
figures.

W&L’s deliberate offense pro-
duced 52 percent shooting to
Dickinson’s 48 percent. But
more important, the Generals
went to the free throw line 24
times, hitting 18. By contrast,
Dickinson was four of 12. The
Generals are 73 percent from
the line this season.

Typical of the Generals’ of-
fense was the last play of the
first half. Junior forward Scott
Shannon ripped down one of his
five rebounds and passed to
playmaker Chris Baldwin, who
brought the ball up court. The
Generals passed it around,
waiting for the last shot, then
passed the ball inside to
Graves, who tossed in an 8-foot,
one-handed jumper from the
left side to end the half.

Graves and Fitzenhagen
again led the Generals, with 20
and 13 points, respectively.

In the championship game
Saturday night, the Generals
met Salisbury State, 101-89 win-
ners over Geneva College Fri-

Generais Lex Fitzenhagen and Scott Shannon (54) fight for a re-
bound in the early going against Dickinson, (Photo by Patrick

umphed, 66-60, to win the tour-
nament.

Again the Generals won it at
the free-throw line. Outshot 52

' percent to 47 percent and out re-

bounded 33 to 31, W&L relied on
24 of 34 free-throw shooting to
win. Fitzenhagen, with 14
points, was 10 of 13 from the
line.

By drawing 30 personal fouls,
the Generals limited the Sea
Gulls offensively. Dave Prit-
chett, who had 17 points for
Salisbury against Geneva, foul-
ed out with two points against
W&L.

Graves, averaging 20.2 points
per game this season, was out-
standing, with game-highs of 18
points and 12 rebounds. His ef-
forts earned him tournament
VMP honors.

Joining Graves on the all-

tournament team was fellow co-
captain Baldwin, with eight
assists, seven steals and only
one turnover.

“I was especially happy to
see Baldwin make the _all-
tournament team,” said Can-
field. ‘‘He does not score many
points, but his contributions in
other areas are just as impor-
tant in helping the team win.”’

‘We still have some things to
work on — most notably our
defense — but I’m pleased we
won,” he added. “‘It is impor-
tant to win our own tournament
and the win will help prepare us
for the upcoming ODAC portion
of our schedule.”’

Tonight at 7:30 in Warner
Center the Generals take on
Emory and Henry in the first of
14 ODAC games ina row.

“We are getting close to the
point where I want to be now,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘When we can
make people play our style of
basketball, we should be able to
‘win. Salisbury came into the
game with a high-scoring of-
fense, but we were successful in
making them play at our tem-
po.”
Emory and Henry, 5-19 last
year and 1-8 so far this season,
is led by freshman forward
Kevin Brown, a 59 percent
shooter averaging 17.2 points
per game.

Canfield is not taking the
Wasps lightly, despite their
poor record. ‘‘They have some
great individual talent, so we
must be ready,” said Canfield.
‘Emory and Henry is the prime
example of a team that will be
up for us.”’

everyone’s full of questions:
Why not Auburn? Why not a
playoff? Well, let’s face it,
given the bowl system, no one
team deserved sole possession
of any national championship.
There were at least four very
good football teams this year,
as well as a few others who’d be
willing to give those top four
trouble. Logic seems to be say-
ing, then, “Hey, dummy, how
about a playoff?” I’ll admit it
looks good on the chalkboard.
But, that’s as far as it goes. For
one thing, the bowl games are
too firmly entrenched to be
bypassed for a national playoff.

W&L note: A fine California trip
and an impressive showing at
their Invite last weekend has
the General hoopsters looking
quite ready thank you as they
head into ODAC play tonight.
Although they have yet to play a
totally stellar game, the
Generals have been most profi-
cient at making their opponents
look bad, an ability that gets
you more than half the way
home. P.S.: Watch out for those
freshmen bookends Brideweser
and Spencer, who could con-

playoff system would, you can
bet, require a bit more com-
promising than the planning
committees in Pasadena, New
Orleans, Dallas or Miami are
willing to consent to. Finally, in
a playoff system you’ll run into
problems with the number of
teams selected and how you
select them. Do you pick the top
eight? Sixteen? What’s the dif-
ference between team 16 and
17? How do you keep that
number down? (Just look at the

’ basketball tournament whose

size has doubled in five years. )
And if you have a tournament
format, what precludes the
possibility of a lower team
upsetting everyone to win the
championship? Can they then
be justified as national cham-
pions, despite others who have
better records? No, I think the
present setup is best. It’s simp-
ly the only practical choice. The
problem today is that we’ve
forgotten what a bowl game is
for. It’s time we return the bow]
game to its original place.
That’s as a reward for a job well
done rather than an extraneous
test of a good team’s worthi-
ness...

...Back down to the Colon-
nade, there’s a group that is
almost always overlooked that
deserves some of your atten-
tion. It’s the boys over at

that works extremely hard and
is reaping every benefit it

Rock, freshmen
lead swimmers

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University swim team lost a
close meet against Ship-
pensburg State by a score of
58-55 last Sunday night at the Cy
Twombly Pool.

The Generals held a slim lead
going into the final event: the
400-yard freestyle relay. Ship-
pensburg State (ranked sixth in
NCAA Division II) won the 400
free relay by four-tenths of a se-
cond, and as a result gained the
points necessary to win the
meet, The loss gives the
Generals a 1-2 record in dual
meet competition.

Freshman Jay ReVille led
W&L against Shippensburg
State with three individual vic-
tories. ReVille took first place
in the 200-yard individual
medley (2:02.71), the 200-yard
backstroke™(2: 19.12). ReVille is
undefeated in nine races in dual
meet competition.

In addition to ReVille, senior
Tim Rock and freshman Joe
Donovan have also contributed
outstanding individual perfor-
mances to the Generals this

(10:09.72) so far this season.

According to head swimming
coach Page Remillard,
Donovan, who posted two diving
wins against Shippensburg
State Sunday night, has col-
lected the first diving victories
for W&L in five years.

The Generals’ 1-2 dual meet
record is deceptive. The
Generals’ have lost’ only to
powerhouses in their respective
divisions (Johns Hopkins and
Shippensburg State). The re-
mainder of the Generals’
schedule is also difficult
however. The only teams that
remain on W&L’s 1983-84
schedule are in NCAA Division
i,

Commenting on the Generals’
schedule, Coach Remillard
stated that the team’s goal this
season is to go over the .500
mark against Division I teams.
Remillard said, ‘‘We’ve got our
work cut out for us, but I know
these guys are going to see to it
that it takes place.”

The Generals continue their
schedule this weekend. They
travel to James Madison
University tomorrow night. On
Saturday the Generals will be at
Towson State for a tri-meet that
involves W&L, Towson State
and Loyola.

‘Duke defeats matmen, 35-7

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University wrestling team,
perhaps feeling the effects of
the layoff over the Christmas
holidays, suffered its first dual
meet loss of the season at the
hands of Duke University on
Saturday.

General grapplers lost the
meet by a 35-7 count, leaving

each winning his match. Valli-
ere now sports an overall
record of 5-1, while Dixon’s
record remained unblemished
at6-0.

Head coach Gary Franke was
pleased with the performances
of Valliere and Dixon but was

slightly disappointed with the

remainder of the team.

“‘We were a little rusty after
not wrestling for a couple of
weeks,’’ Franke said. “Valliere

mances out of some other peo-
ple.”

The Generals have a quad-
meet on Saturday, Jan 14, with
Loyola, Johns Hopkins and
Hampden-Sydney. Coach
Franke feels this is a pivotal
meet for his team.

“I cannot be too disappointed
with our loss to Duke, but I
would like to see us get back on
track this weekend. We will

(continued from page 10)
of coeducation, and possibly the
letters he has received from the
17-member Alumni Board of
Directors.

‘I don’t anticipate, but do not
preclude,’ that any other
material on coeducation will be
sent to the trustees before the
Feb. 3-4meeting, Wilsonsaid.

The key expression of Wil-
son’s opinion on this matter is a
20-page, 6000-word document
which is often referred to as the
‘White Paper.”

A confidential copy of the
report dated Oct. 19 was sent to
the 38 trustees and trustees
emeriti at the time of the Oc-
tober Board meeting.

A slightly different version,
dated Oct. 25 and titled ‘‘Reflec-
tions on the Question of Under-
graduate Coeducation at Wash-

“Dr. Wilson, in preparing his
White Paper, attempted to deal
with the matter of coeducation
in as objective a manner as
possible. That notwithstanding,
it is possible that it leads one to
the conclusion or at least in the
direction that he favors coedu-
cation,” he said.

Parsons said that a number of
alumni have written ‘seeking
to counter what they perceive
as the bias in the President’s

paper.”

He added, ‘‘We’ve seen
several indications that some

_ alumni are encouraging others

to write.”’ He said this can be
seen from ‘certain turns of
phrases which keep cropping
up” and from geographical
regions.

 

‘There's a lot of people who want

to be heard on this issu.’

 

ington and Lee,” was sent first
to the faculty and Alumni Board
of Directors.

Shortly thereafter, copies
were distributed to alumni
chapter presidents, class

agents, the 60 Alumni Admis-
sions Program chairmen, and
officials of five nearby colleges.

On Oct. 27, the paper was sent
to the 12 members of the Stu-
dent Body Executive Commit-
tee and to the six head dor-
mitory counselors.

Wilson said that the head
dorm counselors were included
at the suggestion of Dean of
Students Lewis G. John in order
to seek opinion from indepen-
dent students, since the EC is
perceived as being fraternity-
dominated.

A check of records shows that
nine of the 10 undergraduate
members of the EC are in
fraternities; half of the dorm
counselors are in houses.

All were asked for their
response to what Wilson calls
“the Reflections.’’ ‘‘I haven’t
had many letters yet,” he said
Tuesday, putting the number of
student leaders responding at
three or four.

The students received with
the report a cover letter signed
by President Wilson which said
the White Paper was “a
privileged document”’ and that
“wider circulation is not war-
ranted at this time.”’

The report was not available
to the press and public until ear-
ly December, when the full text
was published in ‘‘W&L,’’ the
alumni magazine.

University editor Frank Par
sons says that the paper may be
‘“‘weighted.”” He said, ‘In
response to the White Paper
we’ve had a number of people
say that it has a slight — some
would say not so slight — bias in
the direction of coeducation.”’

Parsons said that the January
magazine will carry ‘‘an ar-
ticulate argument” against
coeducation by trustee
emeritus Jack W. Warner of
Tuscaloosa, Ala., whom Par-
sons characterizes as ‘‘the
leader of the status quo forces.”’

“Since responsible people can
have different points of view, I
think we ought to present those
views in the magazine,” he
said. He added that War-
ner’s ‘knowledge and _ his
feeling about the university are
deeply held, and respected by
those who know him. On his own
initiative, he has shared his
views with his fellow trustees
and other alumni leaders and
his statement is one we felt that
we should present to the entire

alumni constituency.”
Wilson wrote ‘the White
Paper’ during the Alumni

Leadership Conference in Oc-
tober.

During a series of three inter-
views immediately before and
just after Christmas, Wilson
continually maintained that he
had not reached a final decision
on the coeducation question.

The report, he said, ‘‘should
not be construed to be the con-
cluding sense of my mind on the
matter.”

He characterized the
arguments on each side of the
debate as ‘“‘equally compel-
ling,’ and said that further
study was required.

The report mentions an inter-
view he did in October in front
of Lee Chapel with correspon-
dent Lem Tucker of CBS News.

Tucker and producer David
Caravella are on the road with
the Glenn campaign and could
not be reached.

A Washington spokesman for
“The CBS Evening News’”’ said
that the tape is ‘‘still in the
file,’ and could air at some

future time.

The decision to let the coedca-
tion question extend beyond
May isa new development.

An October article in the
Newport News Daily Press
quoted Wilson as saying: ‘I
want to put the question of
coeducation to rest by May
—one way or another.”

In. a December interview,
Wilson said he had begun to
realize that that might not be
possible.

He said he had told a meeting
of the Alumni Association
ez lier that year that a decision
w Juld be made by May.

‘‘T had hoped we would have a
quiet time in the next year so
that we could reach a ‘yes’ or
‘no’ decision by May, which was
then a year down the road,”’ he
said.

‘Now I don’t know whether
that’s still possible or desirable.
There’s a lot of people who want
to be heard on this issue.”’

Rector Ballengee said in a
December interview: ‘I had
hoped we would be able to de-
cide in May...It shouldn’t be left
hanging up there, but we
haven’t concluded exactly how
the agenda will proceed...Pro-
cedure could be very important
here.”’

Wilson apparently did not
originally plan to have the ad-
mission of women as one of the
items on his agenda as universi-
ty president.

At a press conference on Sept.
1, 1982, the day he was named to
succeed Robert E. R. Huntley,
Wilson said that coeducation
had ‘“‘passed out of the realm of
something we have to worry im-
mediately about or think im-
mediately about.

“This university has been
able to attract, it continues to be
able to attract first-rate
students, and retain them, and
to educate them to become suc-
cessful citizens of the larger
world, and that seems to me to
be a useful mission...

“IT would say this: that we
would not be in the position of
advocating change at this
stage. I will not argue with the
Board that we ought to con-
tradict success,’’ he told the
reporters gathered in the Com-
merce School.

Coeducation as an agenda
item has occurred principally
this year. As late as June of last
year Dean of Students Lewis
John told the Christian Science
Monitor:

‘For the time being, we have
chosen to remain single-sex for
essentially two reasons: there
was no compelling need to go
coeducational, and we continue
to attract the students we
need...

“We think Washington and
Lee is a unique institution for
many reasons — its history, its
traditions. Single-sex is only
one of them. For now, as long as
the market holds, there is no
reason to change that,” John
said. :
