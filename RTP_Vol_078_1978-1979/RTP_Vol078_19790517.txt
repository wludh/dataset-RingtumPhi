Admissions Rise Announced

by Stuart Snyder

“It has been a good year for
admissions,”’ said William H.
Hartog, Director of Admissions.
He added, “This year’s ap-
plicants were as good as last
year’s.”

According to Hartog, the Ad-
missions office does not yet
have any statistical figures on
the in-coming class, but he
estimates that the S.A.T. scores
are about the same as last
year’s students.

“This year there were 1,085
applicants,’ Hartog said. He
added that this is 110 more than
last year, which is an increase
of eleven percent over last
year’s total.

Hartog said his office offered
admissions to 654 applicants as
compared to last year’s 684. So
far 369 have accepted against
394 at this time last year. ‘By
September the numbers should
be between 350 and 355 entering

Student Phone-a-thon
Nets $25,000

W & L students, in an annual
telethon for the Annual Fund-
operating budget, raised $25,505
in specific pledges on May 7-9.
The total reflects a significant
increase over the yield of
$19,678 raised last year at this
time.

According to Carter
McNeese, assistant director of
development at W & L, the A-
nual Fund represents 10% or
more of the annual operating
budget, and this year paid about
$570 towards each student’s
education on campus. The
phone-a-thon, begun last year
and chaired again last week by
senior Fred Brimberg,
gathered some 25-30 for 3 nights
of phone calls, soliciting dona-
tions from alumni.

McNeese has called the ac-
tivity a “‘tremendous success
and service to the university.
We definitely plan to continue
the program next year, though
the timing of the Mock Conven-
tion may force us to reschedule
it at a different date.”

“Personally, it is great to
work with these students,’’ he
added. ‘‘Not only funds, but a
great deal of goodwill is
generated as students chat with
alumni. In short, we may see
these students as about the best
‘ambassadors’ W&L has going
at the present time.”’

  
   

university policy,” Hartog said.

The Admissions Office chang-
ed its procedure of notification.
This year it employed a “rolling
admissions policy,’’ in which
notifications start the first of
February and continue until
March, Hartog said.

According to Hartog there
were no changes made in last
year’s new format. ‘‘The only
change was in the topic of the
essay question,’’ said Hartog.

When asked whether the ap-
plicants who took time to fill out
the essay were more willing to
go to Washington and Lee, .
Hartog said,’ ‘I am sure that
the essay has an effect. It
delays some and others do not
get sent atall.”

“Since we are not the first
choice of many who apply, we
want to make it as easy as
possible to apply, but hard for
admission. That way we can br-
ing them here to show them
what we have to offer and
possibly change their minds,”

by David Greer

A Washington and Lee senior
was convicted of an honor viola-
tion Thursday at the first public
honor trial in five years.

A jury consisting of 12
students handed down a guilty
verdict, voting 8 to 4 against the
student, who was tried for
cheating on an exam.

The penalty for committing
an honor infraction is expulsion.

The trial was open only to
members of the W&L communi-
ty, and because the circulation
of the Ring-tum Phi extends
beyond W&L, details of the trial
cannot be revealed here.

Under W&L’s Honor System,
the Student Body Executive
Committee investigates possi-
ble honor infractions and if it
finds that an infraction did oc-
cur, the accused student has a
chance to withdraw from the
university with no mention on
his record of the honor viola-
tion.

Hartog said.

Hartog sees this year’s gain
over last year’s low levels as a
“significant reversal. Especial-
ly, when by 1985 there are sup-
posed to be 23.8 percent fewer
candidates in the nation-wide
applicant pool,” Hartog added.

When asked about the selec-
tion of a candidate who did not
graduate from W&L as ‘Boy
Dean,”’ Hartog said ‘‘the title is
out moded. Since I am not con-
sidered a Dean there really is
no such position.”

“However, the position of
Assistant Director of Admis-
sions has been offered to two
people: Peter Williams and an
undisclosed candidate, whose
name is being withheld until he
notifies the school of his deci-
sion.

Hartog said that the unnamed
person is a graduate of the
University of Alabama with a
B. S. degree. Hartog added,
“‘He is a graduate of the Univer-
sity of Virginia with an M.S. in

A student can opt for a public
trial before a jury selected from
the student body and screened

in a recent policy change
toward fairness, the results of
the public trial are now omitted
from the student’s record.

Education, specifically
Guidance and Councilling. He
has worked at a college in the
South for the past year.”

“My philosophy about the
position (of Assistant Director
of Admissions) is: it is not a
vested right for a W&L
graduate. I need a proper com-
bination of education,
character, and expertise and if
a W&L graduate happens to fit,
great!” Hartog said.

He added, “I do feel that we
need some recent graduate on
the staff, to keep in touch with
the students.’”’ In Hartog’s opi-
nion next year’s admissions’
staff embodies all of what W&L
Ae

Since he feels ‘‘staffing is one
of the most important things,”
he has chosen next year’s staff
for longevity, subjectivity, con-
tinuity and how well it
represents the school. ‘I want
to be able to have them come
back for several years more,”’
he added.

Convicted In Trial

The accused had the aid of
two counsels from the student
body; similarly, the EC used
two of its members to represent
the prosecution.

The president of the Student
Bar Association acted as Chair-
man of the proceedings.

Nader Speech Ends Contact’s Year
May 24 Speech To Complete Presentations

Ralph Nader, consumer ad-
vocate and social critic, will
speak at Washington and Lee
Thursday, May 24. The lecture
is sponsored by Contact, the stu-
dent symposium that brings na-
tional and _ internationally
known figures to speak at W&L.

Nader has been called
everything from Muckraker to
Consumer Crusader to Public

Defender. Time magazine call-
ed him “the U.S.’s toughest
customer.”’

An attorney, Nader has
documented criticisms of of the
government and industry that
has resulted in widespread
public awareness and changes
in industry and government to
benefit the American citizen.

The New York Times said of

Nader: ‘‘What sets Nader apart
is that he has moved beyond
social criticism to effective
political action.”” At least six
major federal consumer protec-
tion laws passed in response to
some of his work support this
statement.

Today Nader speaks of the
growing imperialism of
multinational corporations and

the convergence of corporate
and governmental power. A
Contact spokesman said Nader

will probably speak on the cor-
porate power in America and
the workings of economic
governments.

Nader will speak in Lee
Chapel. The lecture is open to
the public without charge, and
will start at 8 p.m.

EC Appointments

by Ross Newell

The Student Body Executive
Committee announced subcom-
mittee appointments for next
year, after reviewing applica-
tions and conducting interviews
last week.

Bill Ridge and David Harpole
were selected from the group of
four applicants for the positions
of Student Activities Board co-
chairmen. Of the two people
who applied for treasurer of the
SAB, the EC appointed Danny
Raskin. Geoffrey Fauth is the
secretary of the SAB next year.
The EC received only one ap-
plication for this position.

SAB appointments are
perhaps the most important to
the student body in general
because theirs is the primary
responsibility for setting the
tone of student entertainment
for next year, especially in
terms of movies and music.

Sidney Simmons, Craig Cor-
nett and Dick Schoenfeld were
chosen as the chairmen of the
1979-1980 Mock Convention.
These positions will undoubted-
ly take on added importance
with the upcoming presidential
election. The EC received no
other applications for these
positions.

Craig Cornett was re-elected
Mock Convention secretary;
there were no other applica-
tions. Jim Hicks was chosen as
the financial computer director
for the Mock Convention next
year. Hicks’ position is basical-
ly that of a treasurer.

The EC appointed Tim
Brooks as chairman of the Stu-
dent Control Committee from
among the three persons who
applied. The SCC handles many
of the student violations of
university rules and regulations
and dispenses disciplinary
penalties for offenses such as
misconduct in the dormatories.

Of the three persons who ap-
plied for chairman of the Cold
Check Committee the EC ap-
pointed Jim Vines. The Cold
Check Committee has nine
other members-at-large and is
responsible for handling the
cases of students who write bad
checks. The nine members-at-

large are: Steve Abraham, Hub
Kennedy, Mike Malesardi,
Geoff Fauth, Wilbur Harville,
Brian Gibson, David Cordell,
Karl Senig, and James Stanton.

The EC appointed Sam Flax,
a law student, and Channing
Hall, a rising junior, as the two
student body representatives to
the Publications Board. Flax
and Hall were the only persons
to apply.

The Publications Board is the
regulatory body for the student
newspaper, the yearbook and
literary magazine. The board
appoints the editors and
business managers of these
publications.

The EC re-appointed Rob
Neely as chairman of the Voting
Regulations Board. The
primary responsibility of the
board is to organize and run stu-
dent elections.

The EC appointed Jose
Amorin and Dan Weiss as the
SAB film co-chairmen from
among the five applicants who
applied. Amorin and Weiss will
be primarily responsible for
scheduling movies for next
year.

Bill Towler and George
Polizos applied for the position
of SAB entertainment director.
The EC, recognizing the talents
of both applicants, voted to
make Towler and Polizos co-
chairmen of SAB _ entertain-
ment. Doug Dorsey is the SAB
publicity director next year.

The EC appointed the follow-
ing persons SAB members-at-
large: Bill Goodell; Diane
Poole, a law student; David Ir-
vin; Stuart Miller; Chester
Taylor; Dave Meyers and
Larry Wescott.

Jamie Small was appointed
chairman of the University
Center Committee. The UCC is
primarily responsible for book-
ing many of the bands in the
Cockpit. Small said that he
hopes to continue the trend of
increasing and improving the
entertainment in the Cockpit.
The members-at-large on the
UCC are: John Pritchett, Mac
McCoy, Guy Stuart and David
Blackwood.

 

SAB applicants await EC appointment decision.

Students Give Drug Opinions
In Newspaper Poll

by David Greer

Over seventy percent of the
student body responding to a re-
cent poll have used marijuana
at least once.

The poll, conducted by Randy

70 percent of the freshmen, 76
percent of the sophomores, and
66 percent of the juniors said
they had used marijuana.

The respondents said how
often they used the drug. Of the
freshmen, 18 percent said they
had not used it during the cur-
rent school year; 27 percent

The average of all
respondents show that 16 per-
cent had not used marijuana
this school year; 19 percent less
than once a month; 19 percent

In the first five seconds you
know Manhattan is different
because the expected
technicolor is not there — the
film is shot instead in a
beautifully muted black-and
white. The first minutes of the
film are a tribute to New York
City: a long series of shots at
street level, skyline views, and
a climactic scene of nighttime
fireworks over the Hudson. The
explosions burst in time with
the crecendos of the Gershwin
soundtrack, making this a
strong opening scene.

But this is just a prelude, the
overture to a film about the life
and loves of a writer. Isaac
(Allen), the writer, is currently
dating a 17-year old girl (Mariel
Hemingway). His best friend
(Michael Murphy) is dating a
screwy author (Diane Keaton).

Performances
Begin At
Theatre

Beginning next week, the
Total Theater crew will present
the fruit of their labors in the
Troubadour Theatre. There will
be a wide range of presenta-
tions, from one-man shows to
original films to a full-length
comedy production.

Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. three
one-act plays written by
Washington and Lee student
James Leva will be performed.
Thursday’s one-man shows in-
clude performances based on
Shakespearean fools, tragic
characters, Brecht’s ‘Jewish
Wife” and Charles Manson.
They begin at 7:00.

The films are to be screened
May 26, 27 and 28, beginning at
7:00. The full-length comedy
production, What the Butler
Saw is scheduled for per-
formances on May 29, 30 and 31
in the Boiler Room Theater. All
performances are open to the
public and free at charge.

Cool Breeze Featured
Tonight In Cockpit

Tonight, the featured band in
the Cockpit will be Cool Breeze,
from down Hotlanta way, and

these guys are as hot as the.

town. Following on the footsteps
of their friends, the
Nighthawks, tonight’s show
promises to be a winner in
every respect.

Cool Breeze specializes in a
rhythm and blues-oriented ap-
proach to old soul standards,
newer tunes, and original songs
that recall an earlier day in the
genre: when the back beat was
consistent, the guitars would
wail, the singer would sing his
guts out: all that made the blues
and R&B good before it was af-
fected by the predictability of
much disco music today.

Who is Cool Breeze? Vocalist
Bill Sheffield was a member of
Roy Buchanan’s band, and was
on his In The Beginning album.
Rick Kicklighter and Hal Berry
are two tough, sweet, and at the

same time, melodious players.

Bassist Hassan Khan manned
his instrument with the Staple
Singers. John Healy tinkles the
ivory, once a member of the
Band of Desperate Men, and
Tommy Kennedy is the drum-
mer.

The music is modern soul in
that it combines all the great
chops of standard R&B, as well
as newer jazz riffs and phras-
ings very much akin to Benson,
and others.

There will be a cover charge
of $1.00 for all W&L students,
and the show will begin at 8:00.
All fraternity social charimen

are invited guests of Steve
Loehrer, their manager, and
these chairmen can talk to him
about possible rush dates in the
fall.

Next Tuesday, Skip Castro br-
ings his band back to the
Cockpit for their last show of
the year. There will be no
charge for this event, and show
time is at 8:00.

Manhattan: A Woody Allen Triumph

Allen falls in love with Keaton;
Murphy doesn’t know it. The
characters’ confusion mounts,
but the story stays intelligible
and interesting. At its most
complicated moments, the film
maintains its clarity with the
help of Allen’s carefully worded
script, which reveals details lit-
tle by little.

The cinematography in
Manhattan is unique, largely
reminiscent of French and
Swedish films of the late 50’s
and early 60’s. There is a three-
dimensional quality in the
smooth, often static camera,
which allows the viewer to
thoroughly inspect the details of
a given scene.

Allen’s choice of Gershwin
music for a score is especailly
appealing in this film. The sen-
timental moods of the music

combined with the crisp black-
and-white of the photography
remind us of the New York of
the glitter days — when the city
was Safe and romantic.

Every character, from
stereo-typed bit parts to lead
roles, is well cast and suitably
portrayed. Keaton is still the
flighty Annie Hall type, but she
deepens the character and
comes out of it with more
credibility.

Woody Allen’s Manhattan is
everything good we could hope
for in a film. Together in one
show, we see the usual Allen
humor, slicked up and refined,
effective drama, fantastic
cinematography, brilliant ac-
ting, and a great setting. No
doubt about it Manhattan pro-
ves Woody Allen as one of the
great minds in American film.

Commentary :

 

NCAA Must Improve

Tournament System

by Bill Whalen

On Sunday, May 13, the NCAA Division I Lacrosse Tournament
bids were announced and for the first time since 1971, the
Washington and Lee Generals were not one of the eight designated
temas. Not only does this end a seven year streak of tournament
play, but it is notable that the Generals’ streak should end this year.
In 1979, there seemed to be a shift in power in NCAA Lacrosse.

To understand why the Generals did not make the final eight, it is
necessary to look at the way the lacrosse rankings have gone this
year.

The top five positions have been solidly occupied by the same
teams all year long. Johns Hopkins and Maryland have controlled
the first and second slots, while Cornell (until the latest rankings)
has been third. Meanwhile, Navy and Virginia have traded off
fourth and fifth place. The rest of the top ten has been as predic-
table as a horse race. This is all very interesting, but what does this
have to do with W&L?

Basically, this. With five teams cemented in the top five slots,
five out of the eight available bids are already taken. This leaves a
mad scramble for the last three openings. This year, seven teams
— W&L, Syracuse, N. C. State, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ar-
my and Rutgers — could all raise a legitimate claim for one of the
three spots. Simple arithmetic tells us that four teams will not be
included in the playoffs. And in 1979, fate caught up with the
Generals.

But why weren’t the Generals selected? Instead of answering
this, it is easier to look at the three teams that played yesterday:

No. 6 Massachusetts — U Mass was the darkhorse of the race,
and is the most controversial selection. Three wins in ten days over
Harvard, Army and Syracuse gave U Mass enough mementum to
sneak in. However, Massachusetts also lost to three teams —
Rutgers, Brown and Hofstra — that W&L beat. Against four com-
mon opponents, U Mass went 1-3 while W&L went 3-1.

No. 7 Syracuse — There is no room for debate with this selection,
because in head to head competition, Syracuse beat the Generals
10-7. The Orangemen have played six teams that have been ranked
in the top ten, with five of these games being away from home.

No. 8 N.C. State — The Wolfpack was also an expected selection.
N. C. State guaranteed a bid by doing four things this year: (1)
beating North Carolina in their final game (2) losing to Maryland
by only one goal (3) not playing a game since April 28 (the earliest
finish of all tournament teams) (4) not playing W&L this year (it
would have been N. C. State’s turn to play in Lexington this year).
State does have a good team, but how can you believe in a team that
plays competition like Hampden-Sydney?

 

With more Division I teams rebuilding once weak programs and
stronger competition in Divisions II and III, it is becoming harder
to get into the tournament. In the 1977 tournament, six of the eight
teams were repeaters from the year before. In 1979, only five of the
eight teams were in the 1978 playoffs. Eventually, only three or four
teams will be able to consistently make the tourney — and one of
the teams to be hurt by this trend will be W&L. Only the programs
with the most money will get the best results. Teams with limited
financial and scholarship funds — like W&L — will find it more dif-
ficult to stay competitive with the ‘super schools.”’ To help the
smaller schools, the NCAA should change their current standards
for tournament-selecting.

Generals Dump Hofstra;

by Doug Linton

The Generals closed out their
season on a positive note as they
downed the Flying Dutchmen
from Hofstra by a final score of
12-9. John Kemp scored five
goals to lead the attack as the
stickmen added this final game
to their win column to finish the
year at a 9-4 mark.

A 1500-plus crowd saw the
nets dented twice in the early
going. Kemp opened the scoring
for W&L only 20 seconds into the
game, capitalizing on an extra-

Black Leads
In Scoring

John Black led the scoring for
the year with 29 goals and 14
assists. (Rob Staugaitis led in
the assist department with 16.)
Jeff Fritz and John Kemp each
had 25 goals, while Jay Foster
had 18. The key to the Generals’
success (although they received
no NCAA bid) this season had to
be the fact that the scoring was
so spread around the offense,

along with a strong defensive
unit behind the attack.

The W&L stickmen should be
at least as successful next
season, as a strong nucleus of
returning lettermen will be
looking to do some damage to
their opposition in Division I.

(continued from page 4)

At the moment, the NCAA is playing the ‘‘Three Monkeys” game
with this problem. What the NCAA must realize is that its current
system of selecting is too arbitrary. The NCAA should take one of
the following steps:

(A) Develop a point system whereby a team earns points for
playing an opponent. A team would be given points according to the
ranking of the opponent, the performance against that team and
the site of the game. This would discourage a lot of pushover games
and would give a judging committee an equal standard.

(B) Expand the playoff field from eight teams to ten. Give the top
six teams first round byes and let the other four teams play in a
wild-card round. No. 7 would play at home against No. 10 while No.
8 would entertain No. 9. The two winners would then play in the
quarterfinal round, with the winner of No. 7 vs. No. 10 playing the
No. 2 team while the winner of No. 8 vs. No. 9 would play the top-
seeded team. This would give two more teams a chance to make the
playoffs. This year, five of the seven teams would have played.

Hopefully, the NCAA will take some action before lacrlacrosse,
like football and basketball, becomes a sport for only the biggest
and the richest.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On Thursday’s

Perhaps no single event has been more difficult for
this writer to comment upon than the public honor
trial held on campus last Thursday. Above all, it was
a novel experience for the student body, who turned
out in numbers of 600-800 to witness the first public
hearing of their college careers. Few faculty faces
were in evidence; many teachers felt that even this
phase of the Honor System should proceed without
staff participation. Even so, a large number of Thurs-
day classes were cancelled to give students the op-
portunity to witness the entire procedure. Due to the
increasing rarity of public trials, we thank the faculty
(or some of them at least) for giving the student body
a chance to see their Honor System in action.

Moving to what occurred inside the Chapel, thanks
are also due to many people. Picked at random and
with few hours of notice, the jury members blended
patient, open minds with a repeated willingness to ask
questions overlooked by both prosecution and
defense. Considerable research and attention marked
both sides’ presentations, again carried out by law
students and undergraduates. And most of all, we
would like to praise the way in which Kevin Cosgrove,
Student Bar Association President and chairman of
the trial, kept heads cool and the audience at ease in
the crowded, stuffy chapel.

There was considerable concern before the trial
‘hat a ‘‘circus atmosphere’’ would prevail, due to the
1ather unique nature of the event. But the audience
remained largely silent throughout the seven-hour
trial. Opinions on the case itself may have differed
from observer to observer, but one impression was
fairly universal: W&L’s most recent honor trial was
both impressive and fair. The participants showed a
true interest in getting at the facts of the case without
loud words or excess emotion. And the result —
regardless of the verdict — was definite proof that
W&L students continue to hold the Honor System in
the highest esteem. Unpleasant as such trials are,
they remain a great learning experience. To one, to
all, our sincerest appreciation for the objective in-

terest that was displayed last week.

Letters To The Editor

Mr. Gray Coleman
Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Gray,

I want to thank you and your associates for
the distinguished honor you bestowed upon
me and the library two weeks ago with the
Ring Tum Phi award. It is an award which is

highly valued.

The achievements of The Great Move and
the happiness with the new library were
possible because all aspects of the campus
joined together to develop these programs.
One of the most important participants from
the beginning has been the Ring Tum Phi.

To you, your associates and to your
predecessors I am most appreciative of your
interest and support for the emergence of a

strong ‘‘heart of the campus.”’

Maurice D. Leach, Jr.

Dear Editor,

Within the past two weeks, two W&L seniors
have been dismissed from school — with less
than a month until graduation. They were
both found guilty of honor violations — of
cheating on exams. The question we must ask
here is: Why has such a thing happened? And
is this kind of activity typical or atypical?
Because if it is typical, and not atypical as
many seem to believe, then we must be very

when I ask this question, remember that one
reason for so doing is to help bring into focus
the sad state of education in the city of Lex-
ington. What I wish to emphasize is the
alienation of the student from the text, and
from the very core of what should be the
center of his study, himself.

I would like to ask this of the professors and
instructors who believe in a tradition of
teaching that gives rise to ‘cold test”’ files in
fraternities and to the estrangement of the
student who believes that by mastering
several years of these tests that he is
somehow doing something useful with his
time: What is your job? If it is to breed in the
student a habit of collusion and covert prac-
tices that help him to pass a test, which in
turn will enable him to ‘‘make it”’ in the rat
race of the marketplace, then so be it. But, is
this really your job?

Sincerely,

Librarian Michael Odom

The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Mr. Coleman:

The enclosed letter expresses my feel-
ings, as well as those of many concerned
parents, about the existing fraternity
system at W&L. During this whole year, I
have felt that the Ring-tum Phi needed a
parent’s point of view, and belatedly I am
carrying out the dictates of my conscience.

I want to commend you, and your fine
staff, on publishing an excellent college
newspaper this year. You have set high
standards for future editors and staffs to
follow, and your journalistic reporting on
all phases of W&L activities, has never
been more excellent. The Ring-tum Phi is
the principal voice of information for
parents and alumni, and I know I express
the appreciation of all for keeping us so
well-informed.

Good luck in all your future endeavors. ©

A CONCERNED PARENT

Dear Editor:

For quite some time I have wanted to
write concerning the overall fraternity
system at Washington and Lee. The inten-
sive Ring-tum Phi coverage in the past
several issues on problems relating to
fraternity social and residential behavior
has shown good journalistic reporting. The
faculty, Administration, and fraternities
should, however, in all honesty, examine
the overall fraternity system.

In the September 14 Ring-tum Phi, the
Interfraternity Council reported that 393
students registered for fall rush, a number

given in the December Ring-tum Phi by
Professor Frederic L. Schwab. For the
first time, a faculty member bravely
spoke out. Professor Schwab, in compar-
ing the two fraternity systems of W&L and
Dartmouth, explained general policies at
Dartmouth which I, and many concerned
parents, feel should be initiated at W&L.

The first major point he mentioned was
deferred rush. No college in the United
States needs to have deferred rush more
than W&L. With the exisiting system at
W&L, fraternity rush benefits fraternities,
only. For the incoming freshman, the tran-
sition to college life can be traumatic. Con-
ducting rush in late fall, or during the
winter term would allow the freshman to
beoome acclimated to the college
academic program, and would allow both
students and fraternity members the op-
portunity to get to know one another bet-
ter. As Professor Schwab stated, with
deferred rush, ‘“‘The bulk of the freshman
year is for acclimatization, and for
academics. Fraternity life takes the pro-
per back seat.’’ Under the present system,
unless the rushee is from a city where
there are W&L fraternity members, he has
no conception of, or preparation for rush.
The letters written from active fraternity
members during the summer really give
little information about rush. There is no
information sent to the incoming freshman
from W&L, and the Catalogue devotes less
than one-half page to the subject. The
freshman is also totally unaware that the
location of his room, and whether or not his
dorm counselor is a fraternity member,
can be determining factors in his receiving
a fraternity bid or not.

 

“...if over 90% of the W&L freshman class want

to be in a fraternity, then certainly close to that

number should be extended an invitation...”

 

representing ninety-nine per cent of the:

freshman class. The October 12 issue
stated that over half of the freshman class
pledged fraternities. These statistics do
tell the sad story. What happened to the
forty-nine percent of the freshmen who did
not get a bid?

For years the fraternities, the Ad-
ministration, and the faculty have ignored
the fact that far more boys each year want
to affiliate with a fraternity than are given
the opportunity. The total social structure
at W & L centers around the fraternities,
and those boys who deserve a bid, but are
not given the opportunity to pledge, feel, in
fact, that they are social outcasts. The hurt
is very real, and the scar of rejection re-
mains forever. The Independent Union is
an organization in name only, and has
never functioned as a meaningful
substitute for fraternities. Even the W & L
Catalogue states that “*. . . a large portion
of the social life at Washington and Lee
centers around the fraternity chapters.”’

As a member of a national Greek frater-
nity, I have happy memories of my active
fraternity days, and I do feel that there is a
place for fraternities within an
undergraduate, liberal arts educational in-
stitution. I am well aware of the decline of
the fraternity system on all campuses in
the ‘60’s, and the fact that several frater-
nities on the W&L campus folded. I strong-
ly believe, however, that if over ninety per
cent of the W&L freshman class want to be
in a fraternity, then certainly close to that
number should be extended an invitation
to join a fraternity.

For years the Administration has not ad-
dressed itself to the deteriorating fraterni-
ty state of affairs. The Administration and
faculty should have realized years ago that
more fraternities were needed again on
campus, and that existing fraternities
should be pledging more boys during rush.
The first encouraging ray of light was

One of the rebuttals by fraternities to
deferred rush is that houses need the
money from freshmen to operate. If defer-
red rush were instigated, freshmen could
still pay the same amount of dues for their
pledgeship period, and active dues could
be regulated within that time frame. There
are several solutions to this problem, and
the situation would entail adjustment only
during the initial change to deferred rush.

The other aspect of the W&L fraternity
system, which is the most immature prac-
tice of all, is the ‘‘one-man” or “‘two-men”’
blackball system. As Professor Schwab
stated, ‘‘No fraternity at Dartmouth
tolerates the studipity of the blackball
whereby one or two individuals can impose
their bigotry or ignorance on 60 other peo-

 

The Ring-tum Phi, May 17, 1979, Page 7

Parent Addresses Fraternity Question

ple.’”” Any mature person would concur
with this statement. With the selective
screening process involved in the accep-
tance of prospective students at W&L,
there should be relatively few boys who
are not “fraternity material.’’ Certainly, a
sad state of affairs exists when a fine
young man, who has excelled in prep
school, or public high school, is turned
down by the fraternity of his choice
because one or two actives do not “know
him well enough.’’ One of the major
strengths of fraternities on all campuses
has depended for years on the recommen-
dations and support of its fraternity alum-
ni. How very tragic for the rushee when

membership at this point in time? How
kind it would be for fraternities to review
the list of boys who were extremely in-
terested in them, and, where humanly
possible, extend bids now, or at the beginn-
ing of next year to any ‘“‘worthy’’ incoming
sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Why not
let these ‘‘worthy’’ young men take the
place of fraternity members transferring
this year, or those who have already left?
It would be interesting to evaluate the
results of a survey given to independents
concerning various aspects of the existing
W&L fraternity system.

Washington and Lee is coasting along on
its past glories and reputation. The Ad-

 

“Another outrageous fraternity practice...

the fraternity refuses to consider strong
recommendations by alumni, and or facul-
ty advisors. The most distressing situation
of all at W&L is when a fraternity does not
give the utmost consideration to a rushee
who is a legacy, or has strong fraternity
ties. Another outrageous fraternity prac-
tice employed by at least one fraternity is
the use of two colors of ink on rushees’
name tags to designate whether the boy is
from the north or south.

Professor Schwab also mentioned other
practices that could benefit the W&L
fraternity system. He stated that ‘‘No
fraternity at Dartmouth is allowed to
maintain a dining room. . . This rule
discourages fraternity members from
total immersion within a miniature society
of ‘like-thinking brothers’ and forces them
to maintain contact with, and an
allegiance to, the larger college communi-
ty.’’ He also mentioned that the most ac-
tive members at Dartmouth are the
seniors who produce more mature leader-
ship within individual fraternities.

The time has come when the total frater-
nity system must be examined at W&L.
Weekday parties and hazing are only one
small part of the whole problem. If frater-
nities really want to be an instrument for
good, both to the members and the com-
munity,then great soul-searching should
take place. In what way could the frater-
nities substitute hazing for community im-
provements — require physical work in
helping landscape some of the parks and
downtown areas, and maintain various
segments of the college campus? What

ministration, Board of Trustees, and
Alumni Directors should be very concern-
ed about the many problems that are being
carefully “‘buried’’ at W&L. Significant
facts should be considered, such as the
high percentage of dissatisfied students
transferring at the end of this year, and the
dramatic decrease in student applications
for the school year 1978-79.

I greatly admire Professor Schwab for
being the first faculty member to express
concern about the total fraternity system
at W&L. And now, it is my hope that this
letter, expressing the views of many con-
cerned parents, will cause the University
to examine and remedy some of its major
problems.

A CONCERNED PARENT SPEAKS
OUT...

We would like to thank the Concerned
Parent who wrote the very thoughtful Let-
ter to the Editor this week. We encourage
letters from parents, alumni, all members
of the W&L community, and our Lex-
ington readers. However, there are some
problems with this letter. Perhaps we as
students and fraternity members can
clear up some misconceptions expressed
in the letter.

The Concerned Parent wants to know
‘what happened to the 49 percent of the
freshmen who did not get a bid.’”’ The 49
percent in question did not pledge frater-
nities when preference cards were turned
in at the end of Rush. Among this group
were those who joined fraternities later,
those who found they could not afford
fraternity expenses, those who never in-
tended to join a fraternity in the first place
but who wanted to participate in the par-
ties and meet the rest of the student body
and those who received bids but not from
their favorite house. Many freshmen are
just as selective as many fraternites are —
some do not want to join just any house,
just as some fraternities will not bid just
any freshman.

The fraternities are no longer the sole
source of social livelihood in Lexington,
contrary to a statement in the letter. The
options have increased tremendously
since we've been here, especially in the ex-
panded entertainment programs in the
Cockpit. The demise of the Independent’s
Union shows that the independents do not
have a strong enough desire for such a

body to organize in force; the option was
there, but despite strong efforts by a few
the independents did not rally to the cause.

The Concerned Parent repeatedly refers

to Dr. Schwab’s letter of last winter about
the fraternity system at Dartmouth during
his stay there. While a well-written and
thoughtful piece about another fraternity
system, it compared Dartmouth of the late
1950’s to W&L of the mid-1970’s, not ac-

(continued on page 8)
Page 8, The Ring-tum Phi, May 17, 1979

More On The Fraternities At W&L

(continued from page 7)
counting for changing national trends and
failing to mention the present state of
Dartmouth's fraternity system — the
faculty vote to ban fraternities speaks well
enough on that point.

The Concerned Parent advocates defer-
red rush. Deferred rush does occur at
W&L; perhaps the author is advocating
conducting Rush later in the year. The ear-
ly Rush here serves as an orientation for
the freshmen, necessary because the
social structure at W&L is unique and
because this is such a tight-knit communi-
ty. Saying ‘fraternity rush benefits frater-
nities only’’ is a totally irresponsible state-
ment, as is saying a freshman’s dorm
room location and fraternal status of his
dorm councilor are determining factors of
the freshman’s chances during Rush. With
our early Rush, the freshman meets near-
ly half of the upperclassmen and learns
much of how the social system here works
— how to get dates, how to ‘go down the
road,’ and what-not. We cannot agree
more with the statement that ‘transition
into college life can be traumatic” and at

EC Holds Shortest Meeting

WAL the potential for trauma is heighten-
ed by this being a single-sex school,
isolated from female students, and the all-
freshman dormitories. ‘‘Learning the
ropes’’ early in the year helps the
freshman adjust to the climate he will ex-
perience for four more years. There might
not be enough freshmen left for a late rush
if it weren't for the early system.

The Concerned Parent complains about
the one- and two-ball system used in the
fraternities’ selection process. Those not
familiar with the process do not realize
that although a member has the right to
vote against the entire house, fraternal
respect and peer pressure play a strong
enough role that it will be a rare case when
one member balls a freshman against the
wishes of the entire house. Even when one
or two members do not know a freshman,
they will not ball him on this point; they
will respect the recommendations of the
other members.

The Concerned Parent finds it distress-
ing when “‘legacies’’ are not bid. The
Parent should keep in mind that frater-
nites change in the forty years that elapse

between their fraternity days and the pre-
sent; a house can undergo radical changes
in that time. We would even venture to
guess that many parents would not want
their son to join their old fraternity if they
could see them today. Recommendations
and lists of achievements are considered,
but they do not put a freshman on
automatic bid status. The fraternities are
more interested in the individual and his
own merits, not what his uncle in Arizona,
who knows the secret handshake,
thinks about him. As for strong fraternity
ties, every student who has visited other
schools knows that chapters vary im-
mensely from campus to campus; alumni
can attest to changes in the chapters as the
years pass.

Late bidding does occur here at
Washington and Lee. Bids are extended
throughout the year in some cases, and
sometimes freshmen choose to take their
bids late in the year. Others change frater-
nities in the middle of the year. Recom-
mendations from freshmen already pledg-
ed are also frequently considered. So you
see, Rush is not over on October 1; the

doors are not shut to qualified freshmen. A
student can choose to go through Rush
again if he likes. Also, the Concerned
Parent should himself consider the
“significant facts’? about admissions; a
story on page one of this newspaper tells of
an 1! percent increase in applications
returned over last year.

The issues raised by the Concerned
Parent are legitimate ones, but often seen
only on the surface or as related by
discouraged freshmen. Proper understan-
ding of the fraternity system is the first
and most necessary step in solving the pro-
blems that surround the fraternity system
at Washington and Lee; we only wish there
were more observers who would express
their concerns and opinions and allow pro-
blems to be aired. This last comment is
directed not only at parents and alumni,
who do not have a first-hand view of what
occurs in our fraternities, but to those in
the W&L community who think they know
the solutions to fraternity problems
without even educating themselves on the
workings of the system itself.
