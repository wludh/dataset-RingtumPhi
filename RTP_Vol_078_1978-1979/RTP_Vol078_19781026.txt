City Council Members
Meet With IFC on Noise

by Randy Smith
and Charles Tucker

“‘We come in peace,”’ said Dr.
Thomas C. Imeson, a member
of the Lexington City Council, to
fraternity presidents at Tues-
day night’s Interfraternity
Council meeting Members of
the City Council’s Public Safety
Committee met with IFC
representatives to discuss Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance and its
application to fraternity par-
ties.

“There’s no way the city of
Lexington can make any form
of commitment that would con-
travene the enforcement of one
of its ordinances,’ Imeson ex-
plained to the fraternity
presidents.

“We are not looking for con-
cessions from the fraternities,’’
said Imeson, ‘‘but a fair way to
accomodate the citizens of Lex-
ington,” including fraternity
members. ‘We came to hear
what you all feel about the cur-

“Frankly, your houses have
looked like hell,’’ he continued,
but he noted that there had been
a “marked” improvement in
their general appearance and
upkeep this year. Still, how the
community regards fraternities
is. “not something you turn
around overnight,” he added.
Dudley told the Council
members that the fraternities
and the city ‘‘are rapidly ap-
proaching a_ confrontation
crisis—either an officer getting

“The police department’s action is directly proportional

to the number of complaints they receive”

City Council member

 

The meeting between the city
and the fraternities came as a
result of an address delivered to
the City Council about one
month ago by Beau Dudley,
president of Washington and
Lee’s student body, offering
“concessions” to the city’s
noise ordinance in return for a
“relaxation” of the ordinance
during specific times.

Several fraternity presidents
have been summonsed to court
and one was arrested for viola-
tion of the noise statute which
forbids loud noise or stereo
music between the hours of 11
p.m. and7 a.m.

elections, clockwise from lef

In the ensuing conversation
between the _ fraternity
representatives and_ the
members of Council, Imeson
said that fraternities this year
were “paying for the sins’’ of
their “forebearers.” An_ in-
creased frequency of weeknight
parties and decline in the
general appearance of fraterni-
ty houses had lowered com-
munity respect for fraternities
as a group, he said.

“A number of fraternities

Every time a police officer
enters a fraternity around
here,”’ Dudley said, ‘‘it’s like a
fuse ready to go off.”’

“The whole thing is snowball-
ing into cops verses students,
and the noise ordinance is at the
core of it,’ the student body
president continued.

‘“‘We’ve got to weigh
everybody in the balance and
strike a median,’’ Imeson
replied. ‘The police depart-
ment’s action is directly propor-
tional to the number of com-
plaints they receive,” he told

Dick Gregory speaks ’
on America’s “moral and
spiritual bankruptcy”

Comedian and political ac-
tivist Dick Gregory told an au-
dience in Washington and Lee
University’s Lee Chapel Tues-
day night that the United States
is suffering from a moral and
spiritual bankruptcy that
crosses racial and social lines.

The scope of Gregory’s talk
was broad, and his criticism
ranged from present day
morality to the Russians, the
whites, the blacks, big business,
our educational institutions,
organized crime, and big
government.

Gregory challenged his au-
dience to realize what kind of
power they possess to change
the conditions established by
the “‘rich, rich aristocrats.’”

“T really wonder what day
will you young folks realize how

much power you have,’
Gregory said, “‘and that all the
conditions (in the world) are be-
ing created by a bunch of old,
insane, pimp mentality folks;
that when you bring your thing
together, you really don’t have
to tolerate it.’

“‘One day when you really get
hip and decide that you’re not
going to let a handful of rich,
rich aristocrats manipulate
your head and determine when
you gonna die and how you gon-
na die and when nuke bombs
gonna fall and when they not
gonna fall, then they’ll stop it,’’
Gregory said.

The former comedian also
questioned today’s standards of
higher education. ‘Colleges are
too busy teaching students how

E.C. discusses
freshman election,

role of UCC-SAB

by Randy Smith

Irregularities in last week’s
freshman election were again
debated by the Executive Com-
mittee at Monday night’s
meeting. A motion to rescind at
least one of the run-off elections
was defeated by two votes.

Steve Abraham, junior class
representative to the E.C.,said
that he had seen a candidate for
the freshman E.C. position
“standing close to the balloting
area, telling people to vote for
him.” Abraham called the un-
named candidate’s action dur-
ing the run-off election last
Thursday ‘“‘an attempt to in-
fluence the voting process.”

Abraham said that both he
and Rob Neely, head of the
Voting Regulations Board, had
spoken to the candidate about

his solicitation of votes and had
told him that he could not be
near the polling area.

“This was a part of the voting
regulations,” Abraham said,
“and (thecandidate’s actions)
could have had an influence on
the elections.’’ He recommend-
ed that the freshman election
for their E.C. member “be
thrown out”’ on the basis of Will
Mackie’s argument last week
that a candidate for office has a
duty to know the rules of the
election as part of his “respon-
sibilities” for office.

Tom McCarthy, secretary of
the E.C., called Abraham’s pro-
posal ‘‘unreasonable.’’ The
established rule stating that a
candidate cannot be within 15
yards of the polling area was

Student Charged with

drug possession

A member of Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity was arrested and
charged with possession of
marijuana last Wednesday by
Lexington police. A search of
the student’s room reportedly
produced two marijuana plants
and one and a half ounces of pot.

The crime is a misdemeanor
in Virginia.

Officer J.K. Colbert, who
made the arrest, was apparent-

ly issued a search warrant after
spotting the plants in a window
of the fraternity house from the
street. The evidence recovered
has been sent to a Roanoke lab
for evaluation, according to
Chief of Police J.A. Kirby.

Kirby denied that the arrest is
an indication of an ensuing
police crackdown on
Washington & Lee students.

IFC-Judicial Board

In the wake of the arrest of a
Washington and Lee student
and fraternity member on the
charge of possession of mari-
juana, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s Judicial Board determined
that the IFC has no jurisdiction
in drug-related cases. The inci-
dent was referred to the Student

Control Committee.

In another policy decision, the
Judicial Board upheld the pro-
hibition against fraternity
pledge ‘scavenger hunts’”’ out-
side Lexington’s city
limits.‘‘Hazing”’ of pledges was
also outlawed by the IFC.

written down, he said, but was
“unavailable” to the freshman
candidates.

“‘T don’t think we can take any
action against the candidate in
question,” said Rob Calvert,
senior E.C. representative.
“There’s no way of knowing if
every candidate was informed
(of the rule).”’ ;

“I know when I was there and
Rob Neely was there, we told
the candidates we saw (about
the 15 yard rule),’”’ Abraham
said.

“Overturning elections is
pretty serious business,” said
E.C. president Beau Dudley.
“Until we have done a better
job of informing candidates of
the rules, I have trouble over-
turning the election.”’

“‘T think we have to admit our
faults and let this one go,”
Calvert said.

“T can’t see the point of ad-
mitting a mistake and letting it
go,’’ Abraham countered.

Both Neely and Abraham
recommended that the election
be redone, but in the vote,
Abraham’s motion failed 4-6,
with the two new E.C.
members, Jenelle Mims and
Charlie Scott, abstaining.
Abraham, Rob Benfield, Bill

Tucker, and Bob Willis voted
for the motion.

In other action Monday night,
the E.C. decided that the
University Center Committee,
which books entertainment in
the Cockpit, should remain a
subcommittee of the Student
Activities Board and not
become an autonomous group.

The question of independence
for the UCC came up with
regard with a band booked for
the Cockpit by the SAB. Keith
Leeper, chairman of the UCC,
said his committee was “by-

passed’’ by the SAB in the book-
ing.

Leeper asked for
‘‘independence’’ and

“‘autonomy”’ for the UCC from
the SAB (which controls the
UCC’s $4,600 budget).

Doug Jackson, co-chairman
of the SAB, said “all I would
like to do is keep some authority
(over the UCC) with the SAB.”
He added, however, that ‘‘there
is no antagonism between the
University Center Committee
and the SAB.”

Bob’ Willis, sophomore
representative to the E.C.,
outlined the UCC’s problem as
he saw it: “We have one group
that has the money but no
power, and another group that

has drawn criticism for being a
“baby beer.” Lexington is
within the area where the

beverage is being test-
marketed.
Chelsea contains slightly less

than 0.5% alcohol, and is bottl-
ed, packaged, and colored like
beer. The drink has been widely
advertised in test-market areas
as the ‘“‘new not-so-soft drink.”’
The alcohol content is low
enough that it can be sold to per-
sons of any age.

strongly that the concept behind
the new soft drink Chelsea is

pany said.

“I question the fact that they
(the UCC) are spending a large
amount of student funds and
I’m not sure the student body is
well represented on the UCC,”
Willis said.

the E.C., said he saw ‘‘a need
for the UCC to have the discre-
tion and the power to book

John Warner will be visiting
Washington and Lee for a rally
on Nov. 2. The candidate will be
speaking, and considers this
campus one of his most impor-
tant end-campaign §  ap-
pearances. Warner is a 1949
W&L graduate and currently
sits on the Board of Trustees of
the University. Details on the
visit will follow.

The Republican Club is busy
with several campaign ac-
tivities. On Wednesdays at 4:30
p.m., the Campaign Committee
meets i in the Cockpit. All are in-
vited. This Saturday morning
the bumper-branding program
at Kroger will continue. The
committee will be leaving from

 

  

e student center foyer at
about 10 a.m.

Mock elections around
Virginia have been very suc-
cessful for John Warner.

 

Warner to Speak Nov. 2

William and Mary returned a
54% majority for John, while
Old Dominion University’s tally
was 68% Warner. Mary
Baldwin College gave him a
stunning 78% of the vote. With
victories at Clinch Valley and
Richard Bland _ colleges,
Warner’s record on college
campuses is an impressive
5-0-0.

At the Homecoming game,
the club collected over $73.00 for
the Lexington-Rockbridge
United Way. On Monday and
Tuesday of this week a suc-
cessful dorm collection project
was held, part of the continuing
effort of the club to become in-
volved in community activities
as well as political ones.

 

“Nevertheless, in the  in-
terests of corporate and social
responsibility, we have
suspended all test-marketing
advertising and promotion of
Chelsea, and we are studying
the possibility of overcoming
certain well-intentioned objec-
tions to the concept of the pro-
duct.”

some areas of Virginia by

nurses, clergy, and educators.

mote and condition beer drink-
ing among children.

The Secretary of Health, .

Education, and Welfare, Joseph
Califano, Jr., and Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah), a member of
the Senate subcommittee on
alcoholism, have also criticized
the drink.

Hatch said that the beverage
was the brewery’s attempt to
convert children into “a new

bands in the Cockpit.”

Calvert disagreed, saying
that “to solidify the overall
entertainment for the student
body, formal approval (of
Cockpit entertainment) should
remain with the SAB.”

“T think we should keep it (the
UCC) within the SAB because
the SAB was carefully chosen so
that it would represent a con-
sensus of the entertainment opi-
nions” contained in the entire
student body. ‘You're going to
run into problems of having two
entertainment committees on.
campus,” he added.

Beau Dudley ended the
discussion by making a motion
for the University Center Com-
mittee to have “‘full authority”
for Cockpit entertainment. In
the vote, however, Dudley voted
against his own motion, helping
to defeat it 3-8, and keeping the
UCC a “‘subdivision”’ of the Stu-
dent Activities Board.

John Murphy, senior law
school representative to the
E.C., then motioned that the
UCC retain its authority to book
entertainment in the Cockpit
with the SAB’s approval. The
motion passed 9-1-2.

A. Walton Litz, chairman of
the Department of English at
Princeton University, will visit
Washington and Lee University
next Thursday and Friday
(Nov. 2-3) as W&L’s 1978-79 Phi

Meaning of ‘Modernism’,’’ at 8
p.m. Thursday (Nov. 2) in Lee
Chapel on the university’s front
campus. He will conduct an
open class on “modern” poetry
Friday (Nov. 3) at 12:30 p.m. in
Payne Hall. The public is in-
vited to both events.

In his Phi Beta Kappa lec-
ture, Dr. Litz will attempt to
define ‘‘modernism’’ in British
and American literature by
comparing the earlier view of it
as a ‘‘revolutionary’’
phenomenon with the more re-
cent scholarly inclination to
stress the -lines of continuity
between 20th-century writers
and their 19th-century

Musical “Mainsiieam

by Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

Pittsburg’s Stanley Theatre
— Sunday, Oct. 22. The lights
dim as the opening act takes the
stage, and a nondescript man
steps shyly forward to in-
troduce the band. He looks not
at all sure he wants to be here in
front of all these people.

“Hello, my name is Peter,”’
he says quietly. ‘‘I’ll be on ina
little while but first I want to in-
troduce you to a remarkable
group of musicians — Jules and
the Polar Bears.”’ The an-
nouncer is walking off the stage
‘by the time the crowd realizes
that he’s the headline act, the
man they’ve all paid to see.

Such is the unique fame of
Peter Gabriel. While his name
isn’t yet a household word, he is
known by many as the former
lead singer for the supergroup
Genesis.

Since his split from that band
three years ago (which many
observers wrongly predicted
would cause both parties to
wither and die), Gabriel has
begun to establish himself as a
solo artist with two album
releases and several tours, the
latest of which brought him to
the Stanley Theatre in Pitt-
sburgh last Sunday.

Gabriel has a stage presence
nothing short of riveting. Even
during the softer songs and un-
familiar numbers, the 3000-plus
crowd could not help but give its
full attention — perhaps
because it never knew what
he’d do next.

The show began as he walked
almost unnoticed from the back
of the hall to the stage, climbed
up, and sat at the piano — all
with the house lights still full on.
After a humorous solo rendition
of one of his childhood songs,
the show’s star announced that
it was time to “search for the
musicians.”

The lights went out. An eerie
green strobe flashed under the
stage, and equally eerie music
(from Synergy’s Chords) came
out over the speakers. Five
figures appeared one by one in
the audience and walked slowly
to the stage, each swinging a
lantern back and forth as he
moved. The show was ready to
begin.

An imaginative opening to
say the least, and it worked.
Peter Gabriel had grabbed the
audience visually and emo-
tionally, and he wasn’t about to
let go. The band opened with a
powerful rendition of ‘‘On the
Air” and never let up in intensi-
ty.

The concert featured most of
the songs from each of
Gabriel’s two solo albums (both
called Peter Gabriel), including
outstanding verions of ‘“‘Modern
Love,’’ ‘‘Solsbury  Hill,”’
“D.1.Y.,’’ and (surprisingly)
“White Shadow.” The highlight
of the show came as the singer
left the stage during the piano
intro to the bluesy ‘‘Waiting for
the Big One,” apparently to
take a quick break.

Just as the vocals were to
begin, a single spotlight cut to
the middle of the audience to
show a smiling Gabriel, sitting
serenely in a chair with his arm

around the girl next to him. He
sang most of the song from the

audience, using a cordless mike
and without missing a beat.

The band finally left the stage
to an ecstatic response, then
came back for the obligatory
encore — one area where I feel
the show could have been bet-
ter. “Lamb Lies Down On
Broadway” seemed an un-
necessary concession to the
Genesis-only fans in the au-
dience, where ‘‘Down The Dolce
Vita” would have been at least
as effective.

Gabriel and company said
good night once more, the house
lights went on...and the crowd
wouldn’t leave. The band finally
returned to perform the very
mellow ‘‘Here Comes the
Flood,” and that was it. A first
class back-up band, a
phenomenal performer, im-
aginative staging, and even
(you thought it wasn’t possible)
good sound — Peter Gabriel is a
man to watch for, and his is a
show not tobe missed. M.M.:

The All-Stars

If you have been at all im-

pressed by what you’ve been,

reading — or perhaps hearing
— about the debut album by the
Allstars (Tip Your Waitress, on
Adelphi Records), you owe it to
yourself to see them live in the
Cockpit this Friday night.
Neither their album, which is
somewhat thinly produced and

All that jazz

Chick Corea is best known for
the jazz-rock he created with
his Return to Forever groups
during the 1970s. Less well
known are Corea’s roots in
straight jazz. He rose to pro-
minence with Miles Davis in the
late 1960’s before recording
some free jazz with people like
Woody Shaw and Dave Holland

at the very end of the decade.

 

 

Russian poet reads

Andrei Voznesensky, one of the top two con-
temporary Russian poets, will be at W&L on
Tuesday, Oct. 31. He will be in the Bookstore
signing copies of his latest English translation,
Nostalgia for the Present, from 3 p.m. until clos-
ing. At 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel he will read from his
poetry and the visit will conclude with a recep-
tion following the reading, in the Alumni House.
Voznesensky’s appearance is sponsored by the
Glasgow Endowment Committee.

The reading promises to be both unique and ex-
citing. Voznesensky regularly reads to packed
stadiums across the Soviet Union; his books sell
upwards of a hundred thousand copies,
demonstrating his accessibility to those not
steeped in poetic traditions.

The poet throws himself into his readings,
making them into dramatic recitals. His poems
are fresh and energetic; they become
monuments to the living human spirit, as they
condemn the petty materialism that pervades
modern life. In a political sense, they are neither
denunciations nor glorifications of the Soviet
State.

He is not interested in making political
statements, only artistic comments on the
human condition. In the poem “Provincial
Scene”’ he tells the story of a poor, unmarried
peasant women, who struggles through a life of
servitude so that her son can live well.

In the end her son kills her, and stuffs her body
down the toilet. The poem is told as a conversa-
tion between the poet and a friend who had slept
with the woman, and later reviled her as simple-
minded and loose.

“The whole town came to her funeral.

They guessed who'd done it. Suspecting him,

they said: ‘Kiss your mother’;

he refused.

And it was then that they found him out.

But he would not say who his accomplices had
been.”

“You were the killer!” I said to my friend.

Yes, Annie, you drowned in our minds

between news reports and dirty jokes...

heaven and hell do not exist—

you drift somewhere in between. Who are you now
in your new hierarchy?

Voznesensky draws heavily on irony to ridicule
the petty and the materialistic. Describing a
technological exchange between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R.:

We send them our best ballerinas
and get Pepsi-Cola in return...
I long for plumbing and freedom of thought.

In “The Feast’ he tells of a man who takes
food to his animal friends in the forest: a jelly
roll, a tangerine, and vodka. They refuse to eat
these, and decide to eat him instead. He quickly
convinces them that that would be the wrong
thing to do:

“In the morning I down a demitasse

of vodka, the news from TASS,

two plates, two papers, two casseties,

a colleague from work, two apples for dessert .
dipped in DDT.

And then somebody
sits in my liver chain-smoking Gauloises.
Enough cigarettes to kill
forty thousand horses a day.

You want all that nicotine, what do you say?”

Voznesensky comments on his failure to attain
the suggested poetic output for those in his
Poetic Federation in a poem called ‘‘An Ironical
Elegy Born in Those Most Distressing Moments
When...One Cannot Write.’’ Unlike the
stereotypical poetry reading, where the poet
drones monotonously about some esoteric sub-
ject, Voznesensky promises to be good entertain-
ment; he will also show us a side of Russian life
that is sorely neglected in this age of super-
power politics.

During this free period Corea
met saxophonist-flutist Joe Far-
rell, who subsequently played in
the original Return To Forever
and has recorded with Corea off
and on throughout the seven-
ties.

Corea’s new album Friends
brings the two artists together,
along with bassist Eddie Gomez
and drummer Steve Gadd, in an
accoustic setting that produces
a reassertion of Corea’s jazz
roots.

Farrell’s long association
with Corea is very evident on
Friends. His solos show an
understanding of Corea’s har-
monic and rhythmic ideas that
is surpassed only by Corea
himself.

The improvisational in-
terplay between the two is at
times intricate but never con-
fused; perhaps the best exam-
ple of this interplay occurs in
the title track, a song
highlighted by Farrell’s lovely
flute.

Gomez and Gadd are a
stimulating and _ creative
rhythm section. They can swing
hard and they can play mellow,
but they never get overly
repititive.

Gomez’s accoustic bass tone
is somewhat reminiscent of
Stanley Clarke’s, but his style is
his own. Gomez solos crisply in
five of the album’s eight songs,
his best work coming in the title
track. Gadd is simply brilliant.
His spare, subtle style com-
piements perfectly Corea’s soft
but rhythmically dynamic
music.

Gadd shows that the creative
possibilities of a simple drum
set are endless, particularly in
his cymbal work. The rhythms
of this album are not free; Gadd
plays with them imaginatively
withuout losing them.

The compositions here are
strong, and they all carry the
melodic stamp of Corea, one of
the most distinctive composers
in music today.

Jazz-rock elements can be
found on this album, but overall
this is the most uninhibited jazz
to come from Corea in years.
Dedicated to the musician’s
friends, this is a brilliant album
of happily expressive music.
 

First Portrait of Oriel Ross,

1925; 21”

Many Americans know the
names of nineteenth-century
Russian novelists such as
Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and
possibly have read Anna
Karenina or Crime and Punish-
ment. Theater buffs are certain
to be familiar with one or more
of Chekhov’s plays. Yet
relatively few readers outside
the Soviet Union are aware of
Russia’s distinguished poetic
tradition, which reaches back to
Pushkin and Lermontov in the
earlier 1800s and includes in
more recent times
Mayakovksy, Mandelstam, and
Pasternak.

Vosnesensky’s
Influences

It was Pasternak who, toward
the end of his life, became an in-
spiration for a young poet nam-
ed Andrei Voznesensky. During
the past fifteen or so year
Voznesensky has become for his
many readers the best contem-
porary Soviet poet. He has also
read his poems to thousands in
the USSR and to numerous au-
diences in the United States. Ac-

The new show in duPont Gallery, an exhibit of the sculpture of the late Jacob Epstein, will open on
Monday, Oct. 30 and continue through Nov. 21. The exhibit is accompanied by a film on Epstein and his
work, which will be shown on each Monday evening during the show at 7 and 7:30 p.m.

The collection of 35 bronzes has been lent by the Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C., for a
traveling exhibition sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution. These bronzes reflect not only the in-
fluence of African art on Epstein, but also the way he incorporated the character and achievements of
the sitter into the sculpture. The exhibit will include his sculptures of Haile Selassie, T.S. Eliot, and Paul
Robeson, which will indicate why he won such great attention and fame as a portraitist.

cording to reports, he reads or
recites his works with the skill
of a true actor. His poetry (it
has been remarked) reflects a
“mixture of whimsy and
seriousness,” and is concerned
with a broad range of aspects of
the Russian and American
scene.

Mr. Voznesensky has been in-
vited to our campus by the
Glasgow Endowment Commit-
tee. He receites in Russian, of
course, but each poem will first
be read in English translation
by Professor Boatwright.

The poet, W.H. Auden, once
wrote that although he himself
knew no Russian, Vozensen-
sky’s poems, even in transla-
tion, had much to say to him. I
think you will enjoy seeing and
hearing an outstanding and

One thing that every grit
respects is bravery, and when
exceptional acts of bravery oc-
cur, grits love to hear about it.
With this in mind, this weeks
column concerns the fierce bat-
tle between two of my room-
mates, PS and JR, and a
cockroach.

THe battle lines were drawn
about one in the morning when
JR, talking on the phone, was
confronted by a cockroach at
PS’s door. Apparently the roach
was sneaking up on PS who was
studying in his room.

But the ever alert JR sounded
the alert by means of an ef-
feminate scream and then the
battle began in earnest. The
cockroach was both wily and
ruthless and had it not been for
the competent leadership of PS
(of whom the ROTC depart-
ment can be proud) the death
toll could have been much
higher.

With only an occasional out-
burst of terror, PS calmly and
cooly directed his army, JRS,
from a safe distance, of course.

Ariel needs you

by Ben Keesee

Some of you may not realize
it, but the Ariel offers many op-
portunities for participation by
Washington and Lee students.
The most outstanding op-
portunity is, of course, that of
having something you have
written, drawn, or photograph-
ed published in a magazine
which is widely distributed
within the W&L community.
Any works of poetry, prose (fic-
tion or non-fiction), or graphic
arts are heartily welcome for
consideration.

There is also the opportunity
to work on Ariel staff. Whether
you write or not, you can benefit
Ariel by offering your
criticisms and suggestions con-
cerning the format and content
of each issue. Holding a staff
position is not particularly time
consuming, perhaps four or five
hours at most are required per
term for staff meetings.

Ariel staffers will also have
the opportunity to participate in
readings to be arranged with
selected girls schools in the
area.

Finally, the most important
opportunity is that of develop-
ing the potential of Ariel to its
fullest. This opportunity can on-
ly be realized through your help
and cooperation. If you have
any work you would like to have

Water Polo team
goes 10-2

by Sam Campbell

Washington and Lee’s Water
Polo Generals raised their
record to 10-2 following their 4-1
weekend.

The team opened action with
a 15-1 victory over VMI, with
Keith Romich and Biff Martin
scoring five goals each. Then
the Generals traveled to Rich-
mond for their second Southern
League Tournament in three
weeks. Martin and Romich split
ten goals again as W&L handily
defeated the Richmond “B”
team 14-3. Lynchburg College
was the next opponent, and the
Generals had little trouble with
them as W&L won, 14-1. Martin
had four goals, Romich three’
and seven other players had one
goal each, in the most diverse
scoring game of the season. In
W&L’s 17-11 victory over James
Madison, Martin and Romich
each had five goals, and Bob
Newcomb and Drew Pillsbury
had three goals each in a hard-
fought battle.

The Richmond game was the
most physical of the year so far

for the Generals as they came
out on the short side of a 16-7
score. Romich had four goals
and Pillsbury two, while the
W&L swimmers suffered six
stitches and a chipped tooth. As
for the Richmond game, Coach
Bill Stearns had little to say, ex-
cept ‘We were just beaten by a
better team. We gave it our
best, thought.”

W&L was hampered by in-
juries throughout the tourna-
ment, and generally the
replacements played excep-
tionally well under pressure.
One notable performer was Bill
Meyer, who filled in as goalie
for Will Hodges, who is out for
the rest of the season. Stearns
had nothing but praise for
Meyer’s play, and pointed out
that he had had very little play-
ing experience before this
weekend. Meyer was very solid
in the goal, and even con-
tributed two goals during the
weekend.

This week the team returns to
Richmond for the Southern

game of the year, committing
eight turnovers. They were still
able to win, however, thanks to
a missed Sewanee extra point
and some defensive heroics late
in the game. ‘‘Our defense was
definitely the difference in the
game,” said Fallon. ‘They
were able to rise to each
challenge, and they never got
upset.”’

Offensively, the Generals
showed moments of brilliance
and moments of bleakness.
Stewart Atkinson was sensa-
tional in rushing 23 times for 165
yards and two touchdowns, but
he also fumbled twice. In fact,
the entire backfield was
plagued with fumbilitis. Atkin-
son fumbled twice, and fullback
Jim Palermo fumbled once.
One of these fumbles stopped
W&L at the Sewanee 10, while
another fumble gave Sewanee
the ball at the W&L 18, with six
minutes left in the game and
W&L ahead 14-13.

Despite the turnovers, the of-
fense had its most productive
game of the season. W&L rolled
up 325 yards overall, and
Stewart Atkinson’s 59 yard
touchdown run was the longest
play from scrimmage this year.
Atkinson’s touchdown runs of 59
yards and 16 yards were the
type of big play that the offense
has lacked all year.

The game, however, was
determined by the W&L

For Fallon, business as usual

by Bill Whalen

It was business as usual for Gary Fallon on
Tuesday morning. He was assembled with
various assistants, reviewing last Saturday’s
game. The only difference between this session
and others, was that Fallon could enjoy this film.
Last Saturday, Coach Gary Fallon won his first
game as a W&L football coach. ‘I am very hap-
py about the outcome,” said Fallon. ‘‘It was not a
very pretty game, but when you are 0-6, you can-

not afford to be particular.”

The 14-13 victory over Sewanee is the first
reward Fallon has received since taking over at
W&L. Before this season started, Fallong was
seen as the saviour to a program that had not had
a winning season since 1967. Therefore, when the
Generals dropped their first six games, many
fans were disappointed. Fallon, however, re-
mained optimistic. “I only felt disappointed
when we lost a game that we should have won,”

said Fallon.

The season started disastrously for Fallon.
The score of the first two games were 49-7 and
34-7. Then suddenly, the Generals regrouped.

They were to suffer four more losses, but none

ed from them.

were lopsided. ‘‘I felt that we had chance to win
each of those games,’’ said Fallon. ‘We could
see our mistakes from each game, and we learn-

Perhaps the most amazing thing about Fallon
has been his refusal to let the pressure get to him
during this losing streak. ‘If I am upset on the
field, I think it over before I go home. My family
gives me good support, so I try not to let my job

affect my home life.”

Coach Fallon was obviously satisfied with his
first win, but he won’t let it affect this week’s
practice. ‘‘We took Monday off because a lot of
the players were tired. Otherwise, nothing has
been different.”

Fallon was not interested in predicting how the
rest of the season would progress. He was too
busy getting his team ready for this week’s oppo-
nent, Bridgewater College. ‘‘I do not like to look

ahead or look behind,’ said Fallon. ‘‘Right now,

the toughest team is the next one on the
schedule.”’ This is an old cliche, but, then again,
Gary Fallon is an old-fashioned coach.

Bob Bates, explained that every
female runner was supposed to
run one mile while every female
runner ran five miles. This was
not the case however. Bates
said that ‘‘the race was terrific.
The guys ran much more than
the five miles expected of
them.” Bates also said that the
girls did a good job too. “In
many instances, the girls
outran the guys,” he stated. In
fact one girl, Mary Ellen Bon-
tonne, ran 25 miles altogether.
Bates went on to say that his

Eagles, losers last week to
Emory & Henry 27-20, are an in-
jury depleted team. ‘They lost
their best quarterback and they
do not have much depth,” said
Fallon. “We beat them 33-13

“and they should be mad. It will
be a tough game, but we are
capable of beating them.”’

girl had changed. ‘‘They really

A casual atmosphere existed
throughout the race. Bates said
that the atmosphere was casual

weather was just perfect, and
we all had a great time.”’

Soccer Generals
lose 4-0, 3-2,
home Saturday

by Tim Connors

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team lost both games last
week, but played a lot better
than the scores of the games in-
dicate. An inability to capitalize
on scoring chances was once
again the Generals’ main short-
coming.

Last Wednesday W&L hosted
James Madison University and
lost by a score of 4-0. Coach Rolf
Piranian said that the Generals
“played right with” the Dukes,
but a strange goal with 30
seconds remaining in the first
half proved to be the game win-
ner. Sophomore goalie Kevin
Carney allowed only one more
goal while in the game.
Freshman John Guest replaced
Carney and allowed the final
two goals. Carney has now
allowed 9 goals in 18 games, for
a very respectable 2.0 goals-
against average. Piranian was
displeased with the Generals’
“inability to capitalize on many
scoring chances,” a aoe
which has plagued the W&L
booters all season long.

Against Roanoke College,
however, the Generals played a
very impressive second half,
but it was too little, too late.
Roanoke scored three goals in a
sloppily played first half, as the
Generals could not get anything
going on offense or defense. The
second half belonged entirely to
W&L, however, as the Generals
held Roanoke to four shots on
goal while taking 30. Piranian
said that W&L played “brilliant
soccer in the second half, com-
pletely dominating the play.”
He went on to say that the
Generals ‘‘had (our) chances to
score, and never quit, having to
come back from a three goal
deficit” and falling just short,
losing 3-2. Senior midfielder

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Dance marathon at W&L?

After years of tremendous success on other college
campuses, it looks like the idea of a Muscular
Dystrophy ‘‘Dance Marathon”’ is taking root at W&L.
Under the leadership of campus chairman Jay
Blumberg, administration approval has been secured
and a tentative date has been set. Hopefully, the final
result will be a 30-hour event (including a six-hour
break) on the weekend of March 16-17, two weeks
after Fancy Dress.

Blumberg has alread established the general for-
mat for the dance. Continuous music will be played,
with as many live bands as possible. Contestants will
solicit pledges of funds for every hour they dance; a
$30 minimum has been set for each person to gain ad-
mission. Also, conferences are now underway with
Jerry Darrell of Evans Dining Hall to get the use of
that facility for the weekend.

Even so, a massive effort is still ahead if the
marathon idea is to succeed. Blumberg will be
holding an organizational meeting for everyone in-
terested in working on the project next Monday, Oct.
30, at 7:30 p.m. in Room 114 of the University Center.
Involvement from the community is also encouraged.

It’s an exciting idea: a charitable event that ap-
peals to W&L’s innate preference for a long, intense
party. We wish Blumberg and company the best of
luck in the months of planning to come. Above all, we
urge the student body to support the event by atten-
ding Monday’s meeting. Quite simply, nothing like
this has ever been attempted on such a grand scale at
W&L. If it succeeds, there will finally be another
bright spot in those dismal winter weeks...

Death of the “burn-out”

The execution was accomplished so quietly that
there was hardly any notice taken. Even so, all of you
who lost your breath (or your lunch) during those
physical education running tests in your freshman
year may rest assured that they are a thing of the
past. Effective immediately, the P.E. department

has dropped the 12-minute, mile-and-a-half ‘‘burn -

out’”’ from its list of requirements. Only the swimming
test has been retained.

Why the axe-job, after all these years? For some
time, many students have viewed these tests as an in-
convenience, at best. Others have expressed stronger
resentment, asserting that these are merely attempts
to provoke nausea among the students. But those
rows of greenish faces made little or no impact upon
the P.E. staff.

In fact, student displeasure played no part at all in
the department’s decision. What turned the tide was a
growing threat of lawsuits and litigation. W&L
medical records are not famed for their exhaustive
detail, and many students who shouldn’t have run
were recently told to do so — including a diabetic and
an open-heart surgery patient. A few more of these
mistakes, and things could have gotten pretty sloppy,
to say the least.

So the student body will have to get along without
the “burn-out.”’ One of W&L’s most vividly
remembered traditions has gone up in smoke. And on
a campus where tradition reigns supreme, isn’t it sur-

prising that no one is mourning this time?

these facts, I am reluctant to
point out the all-too-miniscule
mistake cited below.

I do not request by this letter
a correction; I just wanted you
to be aware of the error. There
are, however, many other
Southerners who would not be
so understanding. They would
sue you, the Phi, W&L, and no
doubt ask for your head on a
platter.

Please be careful from now
on when reporting the bir-
thplace of our Southern
brethren. Telling a Rebel that
he is a Yankee is tantamount to
calling ‘‘Prissy’’ simple-
minded. I for one would not like
to lose the best editor we’ve had
for a long time to an old-style,
but most effective, lynching,
the victim of which would be
hung from the spire of Lee

of our revered leader.

Most sincerely,

COURSE 101: PREMATURE
PARENTHOOD — Prerequisite:
Irresponsible Sex. It’s a snap
course. Pass or fail. No exams,
term papers, not even any classes.
All that’s required is complacency
about your own sexuality and a
basic naivete that’s sure to keep
you from being in control of your
sex life.

Women will learn to shorten
their college years considerably
and reduce lifetime earning
power substantially through the
birth of an unwanted child or deal
with choices, such as abortion or
_ early marriage.

Men will explore the joint
decision-making process on
issues such as abortion, marriage,
paternity, etc., perhaps ultimately
experiencing the opportunity of
learning to deal effectively with
irate parents, social pressure,

fatherhood, divorce, child sup-

port and so forth.

The foregoing course descrip-
tion is fictitious. It is an attempt
to raise the sub rosa issue of
premarital sex and to call atten-
tion to the fallacy that ostrich-
like behavior will eliminate
having to deal with the danger
of unplanned or unwanted
pregnancy. To bury one’s head

in the proverbial sand most
assuredly will not eliminate
that possibility and, with the
ostrich as a mascot, one day
your luck is apt to fly right out
the window.

The focus of attention ap-
pears to have shifted in recent
years from the sexual behavior
of college students toward that
of teenagers in general and of

 

younger teenagers in par-
ticular, thus statistics regar-
ding intercourse on campus
(which are notoriously difficult
to estimate) are not very cur-
rent. Nevertheless, in the early
part of this decade, it was
estimated that on a national
average about 65 percent of
male college students engage in

“coitus” and about 50 percent of
the college women.

Perhaps you’ve heard about
Semicid Vaginal Contraceptive
Suppositories, which contains a
powerful spermicide called
nonoxynol-9; and you probably
already know that it’s about one
inch long, can be purchased
without prescription and is ef-
fective within minutes after in-
sertion. Perhaps, on the other
hand, you’re really not sure
which days of the month are
“safe” or whether there is such
a thing as a “male” pill and a
“morning after” pill.

In any case, the New York
Times points out (as recently as
June, 1978) that “‘half of the 11
million sexually active U-S.
teens used no contraceptive the
last time they had intercourse.”’
Furthermore, it is believed that
one out of every ten teen-age
girls aged 15 or over in the U.S.
will become pregnant this year ;
and roughly 30 percent will bear
illegitimate children.

Theories are lately being put
forth to explain this epidemic of
teenage pregnancy; that fear of
pregnancy is not as great as it

to W&L. In response to this,
President Huntley has urged
faculty and staff to help make
as many places available as
possible during the activities of
Nov. 3-4.

Students are also urged to
refrain from driving to the cam-
pus on Friday and Saturday
unless absolutely necessary.
Carpools will take a great deal
of the weight off the parents
next week — form your own, or
walk to the hill for Friday
classes.

The Ring-tum Phi, Oct. 26, 1978, Page 9

College birth control:the ostrich as mascot:

once was and that motherhood
is subconsciously desirable as a
substitute identity and rite of
passage into adulthood. One
woman’s magazine indicates
that “many girls think that sex
should be spontaneous and that
contraception would make it
calculated and unromantic.”’
Apparently confirming this
lace of responsible sexual
behavior at the college level,
Richard Hettlinger points out in
this book, Sex Isn’t That Sim-
ple, that ‘Men often assume
quite wrongly that any girl who
agrees to heavy petting or inter-
course has automatically equip-
ped herself for casual sexual ac-
tivity. Many fail to check that
their partner is protected, and
some couldn’t care less whether
she is or not. Some men and
women assume that because
abortion is available as a last
resort, there’s no reason to

worry about pregnancy, ignor-
ing the fact that abortion is
never just a matter of a simple
visit to the doctor’s office.”’

But in defense of collegiate
morals, Hettlinger concludes,
“Unwanted pregnancies (at
least among college students)
are much more likely to occur if
a couple is struggling to avoid
intercourse than if they have
accepted it. Babies are often
conceived because the parents,
not wanting to admit their
desire or accept responsibility
for their actions, failed ‘on prin-
ciple’ to take adequate precau-
tions and were carried away by
passion. It is not the pro-
miscuous who get caught, but
the idealists who discover (too
late) that they were not able to
control their sexual needs and
then find their marriage star-,
ting out with the heavy burden
of the unwanted child.”’

Computer: no diagnosis yet

(Third in a series)
by Stuart Snyder

The results of an inspection
made of Washington and Lee’s
Harris computer by company
technicians will not be available
for about one week.

The Harris Corporation
representatives appeared on
campus Monday at about 1:30
p.m. They inspected the troubl-
ed computer all day Tuesday
and finished Wednesday morn-
ing.

Dr. Thomas Imeson, head of
the Computer Center, will not
comment on the findings until
the company sends him an of-
ficial report, which should come
within the week.

The report

In the report the Harris Cor-
poration will make recommen-
dations as to what should be
done about the problems with
the computer.

According to Imeson the next
step will be to present these
recommendations to the
University Council. Until the
Council discusses the recom-
mendations, no real action can
be taken, Imeson said.

After the U.C. decides what to
do, then the Harris Corporation
will be notified of their course of
action. Imeson said that the
whole process could take a
month.

Harris: a Beginner

The Harris Corporation is a
company of many inconsisten-
cies in procedure, according to
Mr. William Hartbarger, the
Computer Operator.

As a result of these factors
Washington and Lee’s com-
puter system is not the only one
with difficulty. The University
of Vermont is also experiencing
troubles with their Harris
System, states Hartbarger.

Further, according to Mr. O.
Lee Dudley, Director of Data
Processing and Administrative
Work, ‘“‘when our represen-
tative went to test some pro-
grams on a Harris system in
Arkansas, the test computer
was ‘down’ or not operating pro-
perly.” a

According to Dudley, Harris’
control of the computer in-
dustry is less than one percent,
compared to the I.B.M. Cor-
poration’s control of about

ey Ce.

This means that the students
taking computer programing on
the Harris computer will be
hurt, because of the ‘‘basic”’ dif-
ferences between programs on
the Harris and those of the more
common I.B.M., states Dudley.

Because Harris is a beginner
in the field, they lack the right
personnel to properly handle
complex situations, states Hart-
barger.

As with any company, the
Harris Corporation had chang-
ed personnel since the Harris
125 model (owned by W&L)
came out. In these changes the
original designer of the 125 left
Harris, Hartbarger said. This
fact affects W&L and any other
user of this model.

In most computer companies,
the designer leaves behind ex-
plicit directions of how to
operate and repair his com-
puter. But, according to Hart-
barger, this did not happen in
the case of the 125.

Thus, the Harris Corporation

Phineas:

 

people had to fill in the gaps by

themselves. As a result, the
software man’s documentation
is incomplete.

Finally, another problem
within the Harris Corporation is
changes in the 125’s programm-
ing. Hartbarger says that the

 

A ge es

es in computer “soft-

ware’’ are so fast that the com-

pany does not-have enough staff
to handle these changes.

Next week there will be a
behind-the-scenes look into the
1130, still an important tie to the
Harris Computer.

More about “penguins”’

The following is an interview
with Dr. Sigmund Mirth, noted
psychologist, head shrinker,
witch doctor, and dabbler in
cannibalism. (‘If you can’t
cure ’em, eat ‘em. Got to keep
up that 100% effectiveness
rating.’’)

Phineas: Last time, Dr.
Mirth, I mentioned a research
paper on Abnormal
Endearments Among Penguins.
I know that you are considered
an expert in the field having
written your book, Penguins:
The Formal Attire Syndrome.
Would you tell us something
about these feathered fugitives
from Frenchie’s Formal Fair
Rentals?

Dr. Mirth: Sure. It all stems
from early childhood. (Almost
all psychological problems do,
you know.) The father is runn-
ing around in his chic tuxedo for
as long as the little guy can
remember. Since he’s in com-
petition with his father for his
mother’s affections, he-feels he
has to dress up also.

It is interesting to note that
one can seen an annual visita-
tion of this affliction to the city
of Lexington in the middle of
February. It includes thrashing
around on the floor in convul-
sions amongst others with the
same disease, an irresistable
craving for the Big Band Era
(so what if it’s Duke Ellington’s
step-son twice removed?) and a
sudden loss of memory as to
how to go about anything in the
realm of intellectual endeavor,
the University Council not-

withstanding.

Releated to this mental ill-
ness among the penguins is the
Cat and Mouse Complex. With
polar bears roaming Antarctica
you might be wondering why
penguins run around in their
black tuxedos which makes
them stand out from the snow-
white background?

It’s quite simple; they love to
flirt with doom, not unlike the
freshman who puts off his term
paper until the night before it’s
due, the sophomore who decides
to double-major in accounting

and pre-med, the junior who is
sleeping with two girls who just
happen to be roommates
unaware of the other’s noc-
turnal activities, or the senior
who doesn’t have his physical
education requirements com-
pleted by graduation and has
duped himself into believing
that the guy in charge of such
things will show a thimbleful of
mercy.

If you know anyone with these
mental disorders, write to me in
care of the Fencing team: ‘“‘We
aim to maim.”

to make a living and do not
teach students how to live,”’ he
said. He continued by saying
that people are_ too
materialistic, valuing their pro-
perty more than they value
their lives.

‘‘One day, when you
youngsters really dwell in
truth,” Gregory said, ‘‘most of
your major institutions (of lear-
ning) will have to close down or
straighten up. That’s the day
these colleges and universities
will have to be oases of love in-
stead of cesspools of hate.”’

Gregory, who participated in
the civil rights protests of the
1960s, spoke proudly of the
movement:

“I hope one day this country
will get enough integrity and be
mature enough to be honest
about what we black folks did in
the ‘60s,” he said. ‘Never
before in the ‘history of this
planet can you find records to
match the beauty of our
movement, and yet, white folks
just took the attitude that the
communists were behind it.”

Yet Gregory said that despite
past injustices committed
against blacks by whites, he
bares no malaise against
“white folks.”

“‘We black folks still have our
hands out,” he said. ‘“‘One day
we’re going to put our hands in
our pockets, and when that day
comes, you white folks in
America will have lost the only
true friend you had.”’

Stating that he was aware
that his scrutiny of events

might be a bit cynical, Gregory
drew parallels between the
timing of the railroad and New
York newspaper strikes and the
testimony now being given to
the House committee in-
vestigating the assassinations
of John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King, Jr.

He inferred that important
testimony was not covered
adequately by the national
press, as the strikes demanded
more attention. The selectivity
of the press is not in the best
interests of the news, Gregory
inferred.

Gregory, who will be in
Washington, D.C. Friday to
testify before the committee,
continued to infer that the CIA
and the FBI arranged both
assassinations.

“We got a trick for them
come Friday. We’ll show them
documents and say ‘here are 80
percent of the folks who killed
King: retired and off-duty FBI
agents, and we dare you to deny
it cause we got documented
truth,”’Gregory said. _

He cited the coincidental
deaths of six former FBI agents
involved in the Kennedy éin-
vestigations. All were sub-
poenaed to testify before the
committee and all were killed
before they could testify, he
said.

A vegetarian and interested
in health himself, Gregory told
the audience that many of the
preservatives in today’s foods
were developed by the Nazis
and fed to Jews in concentration
camps.

costs so much during. the
winter,’’ he said, ‘‘you eat it all
summer.’

He also said that immitation

vanilla extract includes the
waste from the product tur-
pentine. ‘‘People eat food which
contains as ingredients words
they can’t understand or
pronounce, and they think it’s
all right,” he said.

Gregory revealed thai he has
developed a recipe for a food
made from. six natural
ingredients—including kelp,
sesame seeds, brewers yeast,
and pumpkin seeds—which he
believes can cure the world’s

ertificate of apprecia-

hunger problems.

' “Youhave a big job to do,”’
Gregory told his audience. ‘‘We
can turn it (the system) around.
I beg you to take care of your
bodies, to understand the love
that flows through you.”’

“I do not believe we have
reached the point of no return,”’
he said, ‘‘but we’re getting
there.”’

lacking in energy, nor the rave
reviews it has been receiving
does full justice to the power of
their live performances. Com-
parisons with the Nighthawks,
another East Coasty-based
blues band, are inevitable and,
in many cases, unfair to the
Allstars, but one thing the two
bands do seem to share is the
classic problem of a great con-
cert band unable to duplicate its
live sound on vinyl.

Lucille Schoettle’s vocals in
particular (no to mention her
sensuous presence, one of the
band’s focal points on stage)
seem to lose much of their
power and clarity in the
cramped confines of the recor-
ding studio.

Mark Mainwaring and I were
luck enough to see the Allstars
at the After Sundown Club in
Blacksburg last June (before

they were nothing short of
phenomenal; it’s rare to see a
group of musicians as
“together” as the Allstars.

They struck the perfect
balance between spontaneity
and tightness as they moved
with ease from white-hot ver-
sions of old Muddy Waters tunes
like “Forty Days and Forty
Nights” to smoky r&b ballads
like “The Fever’, displaying

natural showmanship.

So if you like what you’ve
been hearing, (and their album
is excellent — despite my niggl-
ing criticisms it shows an in-
credible amount of promise)
get a jump on the rest of the
world and see the Allstars in the
Cockpit this Friday. It may be
the last chance you'll have to
experience them in such in-
timate surroundings.

Council members, IFC talk noise

(continued from page 1)
the fraternity members.

“Not all of this is coming
down on you just because of of
music,”’ Councilman Larry
Mann explained. He said that
people leaving the parties
sometimes make noise that
results in a complaint being
registered. He suggested that
fraternity members ‘get to
know”’ the people living around
the fraternity house to establish
better community relations.

Andy Fitzgerald, president of
Phi Kappa Psi, suggested that
the police forward noise com-
plaints against fraternities to
the IFC and let ‘‘peer pressure”’
control the noise problem.
Specific names of the complain-
tants would not be disclosed,

just the house against which the
complaint was registered. The
IFC would then impose punish-
ment upon the fraternity in
violation.

Imeson called Fitzgerald’s
Suggestion ‘‘very construc-
tive,’ but told the fraternity
representatives that they could
not expect the City Council to
change the ordinance.

“Any change we make in the
noise ordinance has to be looked
at in terms of how it will affect
the other citizens in the com-
munity (who also violate the
noise statute) ,’’ he said.

‘‘What I’m offering you is not
what you have asked © for
(changes in the ordinance),”’
Imeson told the fraternity

members. ‘‘What we’re asking
for is a live-and-let-live situa-
tion.”

He said that an improvement
in the general appearance of
fraternity houses and a closer
adherence of the noise laws
would “‘probably”’ result in less
Stringent enforcement of the
noise ordinance.
