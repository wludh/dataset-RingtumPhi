IFC To Submit
Proposal

by John Billmyre

An Interfraternity Council pro-
posal dealing with party curtail-
ment will be considered today
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee:

IFC representitives, many
fraternity presidents and
several Executive Committee
members, including President
Beau Dudley and President-
elect Steve Abraham, were pre-
sent at an IFC meeting Tuesday
to dsicuss the faculty proposal
regarding parties.

IFC president Syd Farrar
was met with strong opposition
after indicating that he intend-
ed to ask for a compromise on
the number of parties a frater-
nity would be aliowed to have
each semester.

‘We have compromised this
year and we have been screw-
ed,” said Kappa Alpha Member
Jeff Hamill.

“After a lengthy house
meeting, we don’t think we
should compromise,”’ said Dave
Meyers of Phi Kappa Psi.

But former IFC president Jim
Davis said that the IFC should
come up with something in
writing.

He divided the faculty pro-
posal into three parts, which he

said should be dealt with
seperately.
Hazing, Wednesday night

parties and the one o’clock cut-
off time were the three areas
which Davis addressed.

Bill Tucker, EC member and
KA, suggested an idea that Ab
Boxley of Phi Kappa Sigma also
supported, ‘‘We should give up
fraternity sponsored Wednes-
day night parties.”’

A final proposal to be given to
the faculty will not be com-
pleted until Friday, after the
SAC meeting.

The judicial board did not
meet, but will consider the
cases of several fraternities
that the SAC has charged with
holding a Sunday party, a viola-
tion of the IFC constitution.

Also to be discussed at Tues-
day’s meeting are the proposal
that the SAC will review and

 

final proposals for Rush
schedule changes.
IFC WEEKEND

 

This year’s Interfraternity
Council weekend Saturday will
feature three bands and 60 kegs
of beer. Twenty-five cent hot
dogs will be sold as the Skip
Castro Band, Memphis
Rockabillies, and the Shakers
toss out tunes from 1:00 p.m. til
midnight at Zollman’s
Pavillion.

Tickets to the event are
available free to fraternity
members through their frats,
and guests may purchase
tickets at fraternities at a cost
of $7.50 per couple or $5.50 stag.
The IFC says all students must
have tickets to get in.

Against Coeducation

by David Greer

Coeducation at Washington
and Lee was voted down by a
majority of students responding
to the Ring-tum Phi poll taken
last semester.

Of all the respondents, 57 per-
cent voted ‘no’ to the question
“Should W&L become coeduca-
tional?’’ 35 percent voted “‘yes”’
and seven percent had no opi-
nion,.

The poll, taken during the
class elections March 26, was
completed by about 30 percent

of the freshman, sophomore,
and junior classes.

In a poll taken last year, 56
percent of the students polled
favored coeducation, with the
senior class being the only class
to vote against coeducation.
The Board of Trustees voted
unanimously in 1976 to keep
W&L all-male.

Other Subjects Polled

Of the respondents, 74 percent
voted that the University should
build more on-campus housing.
Of them, 84 percent favored
apartments over dormitories.

Slightly more than half of the
students polled said they had
disputed a professor’s graded
evaluation of their work, and 75
percent felt there is a need for a
process of grade review at
W&L.

Of those who see a need for a
grade review, most felt it could
best be accomplished through
either the department head or a
committee of five professors. 83
percent of the respondents said
a professor’s grade should be
subject to being overturned.

Most students polled felt that
one of the two basketball courts

in the gym should be left open at
all times for general student
use.

Of the respondents to this
question, 78 percent supported
the open courts; nine percent
were against it and 13 percent
had no opinion.

EC Grant Supported

While 52 percent of those poll-
ed agreed with the EC’s deci-
sion to give the lacrosse team
$1,000 to help finance their
training trip to Florida, only 42
percent agreed that any varsity
sport should receive funding
from the EC.

On the question of EC
representation, 51 percent of
the respondents felt the
freshman class should have two
representatives (58 percent of
the freshmen felt this way.) On-
ly 30 percent felt the law school
should have three EC represen-
tatives, though.

Of the fraternity members, 76
percent felt that VMI cadets
should not be allowed into
fraternity parties without in-
vitation. Of the non-fraternity

the university.”’ The selection is
made by the undergraduate
members of the E.C.

Pinney, Murph Comment
On Fraternity Controversy

“I, for one, am not fully
satisfied with fraternities as
they presently operate,” said
Edward L. Pinney, Professor of
Politics, during a short inter-
view last week.

Dr. Pinney has been at W&L
for 16 years and is Chapter Ad-
visor for Sigma Nu.

“I feel the pending resolution

“Success of the motion will
depend mainly on the attitude of
the body enforcing it,’’ Pinney
concluded.

The location of certain frater-
nities and an increase in party-
ing have brought on problems
for fraternities, according to

school Proctor Charles F. Mur-

 

“ Hazing is nowhere near
as bad as it used to be.”

 

Charles F. Murray

in its approximate form will be
a modest step in the right direc-
tion,”’ said Pinney.

Pinney also called the resolu-
tion ‘‘conservative, because it
does not refer to a good many
things that would be hard to ac-
comodate.”’ He gave the omis-
sion of any pledging clause as
an example.

Students’ state of preparation
is the major problem’ it is not as
good on Thursday morning as
on other days,’’ claimed Pinney
Though he does not teach any
Thursday morning classes dur-
ing the fall or winter semesters,
he bases his opinion on ‘‘a lot of
comments from colleagues.’’

ray.

Murray, known to most
students as ‘“Murph’’, has been
Proctor for the past 21 years
and has been involved recently
with noise-level regulation for
mid-week parties.

He gave Phi Gamma Delta
and Sigma Phi Epsilon as ex-
amples of fraternities that par-
ty less often than most houses,
but have had much trouble with
police because of location.

Both fraternities are sur-
rounded by neighbors and close
to Lexington City Manager,
John V. Doane’s home.

“Some people are always go-
ing to complain, but if frater-

nities would quit some of this
midweek partying, things
would not be as bad on the
weekends,’’ said Murph.

But Murph also pointed out
that conditions, which have
grown worse over the past 10
years, have improved during
the past few months.

“The monthly inspection has
really improved the looks and
cleanliness of fraternities,’
Murph said.

“Windows are fixed a_lot
faster and grounds are cleaned
up more often,” Murph added.

He said the biggest area of
improvement has been with
hazing.

‘Hazing is nowhere near as
bad as it used to be,’”’ said. the
Proctor.

He recalled several. years
back when he saw _ people
“come into the gym beat to a
pulp,”’ from paddling and other
fraternity hazing activites.

However, recently, ‘‘I haven’t
seen any signs of abuse lately,
aside from some _hollering,”’
said Murph.

Murph said the fraternities
“serve an important role’’ at
the university in terms of hous-
ing.
“Take away the fraternities,
and where are these guys going
to live?” asked Murph.

Plans for the third annual
Ring-tum Phi Road Race have
been finalized, announced race
director Jerry Darrell in an in-
terview this week.

The 15-kilometer (9.2 mile)
race is scheduled to begin at 9
a.m., Sunday, May 6, at W&L’s
Wilson Field. In addition, there
will be a 2-mile ‘“‘fun run’’ for

- communities — and beyond —

are encouraged to give a part of
their time and energy to this
worthy cause.

EC Clears IU Debts
In Monday Meeting

by David Greer

The student body Executive
Committee voted to take no ac-
tion concerning outstanding
debts owed by the now-defunct
Independent’s Union.

The IU owes the Ring-tum Phi
$39.60 for advertising expenses
incurred earlier this year, Phi
business manager Cove Geary
told the EC.

John Schmidt, who organized
the IU this year, said the group
does not have enough money in
its account to pay the bill.

The EC gave the IU $100 at
the beginning of the year.
Schmidt also collected five
dollars from each member of
the IU.

When he saw that the IU was
not going to work out, he said he
returned to each paying
member four dollars. He said
he had spent about $93 on
publicity and other expenses.

Schmidt bought the ads in

November and October, but did
not receive a bill until late
March. By then Schmidt had
already dispersed funds to the
figuring he would not be billed
for the advertising.

Semidt said his major com-
plaint lay in the fact that the Phi
was so late getting a bill to him.
“Look at the time period involv-
ed,” he said.

Senior EC representative Rob
Calvert said, ‘‘It’s an outstan-
ding bill you have to budget for.
It seems to be your responsibili-
ty.”

Sophmore representative Rob
Willis said, “It seems to me
we’re arguing something that’s
not in our area.’”’

The EC voted to allow
Schmidt to pay as much of the
bill as he could form the amount
remaining in the IU account. He
is also to submit a detailed ac-.
count of expenses to the EC.

In other business, the EC an-

Buck Rogers:

 

Lost in Space

by Dick Barron
and Mark Kinniburgh

It wouldn’t be nice to come
out and say any movie was that
bad, but since we’re kollege
kids and can say anything we
want,Buck Rogers in the 25th
Century is at best insulting. It
lacks everything which made
all its predecessors entertain-
ing. Star Wars, with its
megabuck attendance figures,
was the pace-setter with its in-
telligent characters and clever,
not necessarily brilliant, story
line. The special effects of Star
Wars were adapted for televi-
sion and seen on ABC’s Bat-
tlestar Galactica, an ambitious
and often credible project
which was just recently cancell-
ed. Too bad they couldn’t have
caught Buck Rogers before it
hit the theaters.

Buck Rogers was originally
planned as a television special
before some Hollywood genius
decided to unleash it as a
feature film. It’s not certain,
but that poor clown must have
lost his job by now. Buck
Rogers was filmed with televi-
sion in mind: lots of close-ups
for the small screen; wild, sim-
ple colors; endlessly chattering
dialogue; and annoying, atten-
tion getting music. In a theater,
there are no _ distractions;
hence, no need for all of this
chaos, intended to lure T.V.
viewers back from the kitchen.

Curses! Beaten (Again)
By Those Damn Wahoos

by Doug Linton

The Generals did battle with
the University of Virginia
Cavaliers before a near capaci-
ty crowd of 6500 at Wilson Field
on Sunday, only to end up on the
short end of a 16-9 final score.

The fourth ranked Cavaliers
took an early 1-0 lead before Jay
Foster was able to tie it up five
minutes into the game. UVA hit
once more at 9:00, but Jeff Fritz
tallied only 13 seconds later to
make it 2-2 in an extra-man
situation. The Cavaliers took
advantage of a slashing penalty
and again took the lead. After
UVA got still another goal the
Generals were down 2-4 at the
end of the first period.

Virginia added one more at
the start of the second quarter
to increase the margin to three.
As the crowd became quiet, the
Generals exploded.

Rob Staugaitis had a
beautiful feed to John Hooper,
who put W&L within two, 3-5.
The offense perked up a bit
more and George Santos crank-
ed a hard shot from out front to
cut the Cavalier lead to only
one. At 7:15, less than a minute
later, John Black scored
unassisted on a fast break to tie
the game at 5-5. The Generals
clearly were in control and UVA
was forced to call a timeout to
slow down the tempo.

The break was effective, as
Virginia came right back to
score in less than 30 seconds,
taking a 6-5 lead. Mike Pressler
then came on for the Generals
and the first time he touched the
ball all day he fired a near im-
possible ‘no angle’’ shot to
make it 6-6. UVA was able to get
one more by halftime and the
Cavaliers went into the locker-
room with a 7-6 lead. It looked
as if an upset by the eighth
ranked Generals was still a
good possibility.

The Cavaliers apparently felt
the reality of this threat and
responded respectably. They
came onto the field in the third
quarter and outscored the
Generals 5-1, muffling any
chance of being embarrassed
by a non-scholarship squad.
W&L’s only goal of the period
came off the stick off Santos,
cranking his second of the
game.

Virginia was unrelenting in
the fourth quarter also, outscor-

ing the Generals again, 4-2. It
seemed that the Generals just
couldn’t get more than one or
two shots in a row. The two
W&L tallies came in extra-man
situations — both Black to John
Kemp combinations. When the
buzzer sounded, W&L was still
seven goals short of the
Cavaliers total of 16.

‘“‘We’re not a team to make
excuses,” said Coach Emmer.
“They are a good solid team
with some very fine athletes,
and we got beat. I’m very happy
with the effort the guys put out;
we hung tough.”’

Goalie Bob Clements had
another fine day, despite the
score, with 24 saves. This brings
his season total to 169. It is in-
teresting to note that the
Virginia keeper only had 7
saves, so even if all of those
shots on goal were successful, it
would only have been 16-16. The
offense just wasn’t quite there.
The defense should be credited
for keeping the game as close as
it was!

Since the Generals’ number
eight ranking came out before
the Virginia contest was over, a
playoff berth is still. ques-
tionable. W&L will now go on to
face Washington College,
Roanoke, and wind up the
regular season at home against
Hofstra. Emmer stated that
“we'll just have to take them
one at a time, and let the chips
fall where they may.”

cess over the Spring break as

and upset the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers in an 11-10 thriller. At
game time Rutgers was ranked
eighth, with W&L three behind
them in the number eleven slot.
It was a critical game in respect
to postseason playoff hopes for
each team.

Rutgers got the early lead
with less than three minutes
gone, but Jeff Fritz tied the con-
test just 23 seconds later. Jay
Foster scored next for W&L,
giving the Generals a_ lead
which they were not to sur-
render. After Rob Staugaitis
threaded a pass to John Kemp,
who took advantage of the situa-
tion, W&L led 3-1 at the end of
the first quarter.

Generals 11
Rutgers 10

The Scarlet Knights got
another quick tally to open the
high-scoring second period, on-
ly again to be answered by
Fritz. Rutgers then netted one
more, but another Staugaitis to
Kemp combination made it 5-3
Generals with half of the period
left.

Rutgers then squeezed in
another one before Fritz found
the goal once more. Following
this, defender Steve Johnson
charged downfield to dump the
ball off to Foster, who got his se-
cond strike. Before the dust set-
tled Sandy Mc Donald found the
back of the net off a Geoff Brent
assist, Rutgers capitalized
twice more, and the Generals
led 8-6 at the half.

Both teams seemingly ex-
hausted their offenses in the 14-
goal first half, as the crowd wat-
ched a defensive exhibition for
the rest of the day. Each squad
found the net only once in the
third quarter, with Scott
McLam hitting for the
Generals.

The Scarlet Knights hit first

 

 

in the final period to close the ~

gap to 9-8, before Fritz scored
his fourth unassisted goal of the
day. Rutgers bounced back only
seconds later to make it 10-9
with only 3:32 left in the game.

At 2:45 Brent threw his se-
cond assist to John Black, who
fired what proved to be the win-
ning goal past the Rutgers’
keeper. The Scarlet Knights fell
just short as they got one more
before the final shistle, leaving
the Generals with the 11-10 vic-
tory. ' ’

Netmen Tumble
On Texas Trip

by Nat Lovell

During Spring break, the
W&L netmen ventured to Texas
for what was surely the
toughest part of the schedule.
The Generals were 9-0 losers in
all the matches against the
Division I schools.

On April 18, the University of
Dallas became the first to
defeat the netmen on the trip.
Stewart Jackson was beaten by
Jim Vanier 6-1, 6-3. Shaw Cran-
field was defeated by Bob Vaan-
drager 6-4, 6-1. At number
three, Doug Gaker was edged
by Joe Suri 6-4, 6-4. Pat Norris
lost a three-set match to Mike
Avner 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Dave Con-
stine fell to Fred Redelijk 7-6,
6-4. Wes Yonge was blitzed by
Barry Janse 6-1, 6-1. The Dallas
players finished off the victory
by taking all doubles in two
sets.

The team fared no better the
following day at the hands of
Texas Christian University.

Track Team Aims For
ODAC Title This Week

by Greg Branan

“Coming off exams and
break, we ran extremely well,”’
were the words of track coach
Norris Aldridge relating to the
Generals’ triple wins over Lyn-
chburg, Eastern Mennonite,
and Roanoke College in last Fri-
day’s meet at Lynchburg.

Final score for the meet was
W&L-70, Lynchburg College-61,
EMC-35, and Roanoke-19.

“Our depth pulled us through
with seconds, thirds, and four-
ths,’ Coach Aldridge added.
Many firsts were also tallied.

The 440 yard relay team of
Jeff Brown, Chris Leiser,

Stewart Atkinson, and Norvell
Scott placed first, Rich Bird
took third in the 1500 meters,
Jim Vines took fourth in the 110
high hurdles while in the 400
meters Billy Morris took first,
Dave Cordell third and Jim
Parker fourth. In the 100 meters
Stewart Atkinson was second,
Jeff Brown third and Chris
Leiser fourth, and Rich Bird
came back to place second in
the 800 meters. Russ Rector
was second and Jim Vines third
in the 400 meter hurdles, and in
the 200 meters Atkinson was se-
cond and Brown fourth. The
mile relay team of Billy Morris,
Dave Cordell, Jim Parker and

Atkinson placed third.

In the field events Randy
Austin was first and Scott
Swope third in the javelin; in
the shot-put Phil Dunlay was
first, Buz Manning third and
Larry Davis fourth. In the
discus Manning took first,
Dunlay second and Chip Nunley
third while Russ Rector was
first and Paul Hendrey second
in the high jump.

The 6-1 Generals travel back
to Lynchburg College this
Saturday for the ODAC Cham-
pionships. ‘“‘With Jack Norberg
coming back we stand a really
good chance of winning,”
remarked Coach Aldridge.

games in six days. This took its
toll on the pitching staff and the
hitting. The team began the
week with a 16-9 loss to
Bridgewater, an ODAC oppo-
nent. On Wednesday, April 18,
the Generals split a
doubleheader with West
Virginia Tech at home losing
the first 8-2 and taking the
nightcap 14-8. In the win the
Generals came up with ten runs
in the third inning off of key hits
by Dan Kingman and Rich
Wiles. Doug Hassinger also had
three RBI’s in the game, with a
home run and a single.

The bats cooled off, however,
as the Generals then dropped
single games to Lynchburg 13-0
and Eastern Mennonite 15-5.
The team also dropped a
doubleheader to Newport News
on Sunday by scores of 6-4, and
5-2.

The Generals have games re-
maining with Lynchburg,
Emory & Henry, and VMI, and
may participate in this
weekend’s ODAC Tournament
if they finish fourth or better in
the ODAC race.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Faculty Misperceptions

The recent faculty proposal to restrict fraternities’ social ac-
tivities was met with overall objection and great concern among
the student body. The proposal also caused concern among the
faculty. We are told that six professors approached Dr. Pinney, ob-
jecting to parts of the proposal — they felt it was too lenient. The
problems that led up to the proposal and the student reaction is
largely a result of misperceptions on both sides of the fence.

The faculty (and others in the community) object to much of
what they see in student body actions and attitudes. The faculty is
concerned about the anti-academic attitudes and the decadent
behavior of some of the student body, and they should be concern-
ed. The faculty’s mistake, though, is blaming fraternities for all of
these ills. Cursing at sporting events and general “‘rowdiness”’ are
not necessarily fraternity functions. And Wednesday night parties
are not the root of all evil.

It seems the faculty thinks that by prohibiting Wednesday night
parties the school will enter an intellectual renaissance. What the
faculty fails to see is that in the past two years, before mid-week
parties were restricted to Wednesday nights, there were parties on
several nights of the week. They lasted much longer and were a lot
wilder. And midweek parties in Lexington have helped to lower the
number of organized road trips, which are often more time con-
suming and hence more likely to cause missed classes.

! The faculty also fails to give credit to efforts fraternities and the
IFC made to improve some of the faults. Fraternity inspections
have gone smoothly and the alumni inspection committee was
pleased with the improvements. The IFC took definite measures
when the noise ordinance issue arose, restricting parties (both by
night and hour) and enforcing restrictions with stiff fines for
violators. The IFC went through proper channels to try to reach an
agreement with the town and when this failed, restrictions stayed
intact.

Meanwhile, many students see the faculty’s action as an attempt
to close down the fraternities. This is not the case, however. Some

- may call the proposal misdirected, but the faculty feel that

‘desperate times call for desperate measures,’’ in their effort to
halt this downward trend of behavior. In any event, this proposal is
a piece of rope with which the students can either pull themselves
up or hang themselves. The faculty has the power to govern stu-
dent life and they will use it. If the students react in irresponsible
ways, the faculty will try more extreme measures. But if the
students take it in stride, just as they did the noise hassle, the facul-
ty may see that the students are indeed more responsible than
credited.

The chances are very high that mid-week parties will be pro-
hibited. Students will say, ‘‘It won’t do any good; we’ll just go down
the road.”” But many of the faculty see nothing wrong with this
They object to all members of a fraternity being under social and
economic pressure to attend fraternity sponsored mid-week par-
ties. We hope that the faculty will allow a few parties during Rush
and the beginning of the semesters; after all, the University spon-
sored one of the largest mid-week parties the school has seen after
the Library Move.

A final note: personal harrassment of Dr. Pinney and other
members of the faculty does not help the students’ cause but only
reinforces the perception — or misperception— the faculty may

have of the students.

Letters To The Editor

Student Attacks Lacrosse Fan Conduct

Dear Editor:

W&L students do not deserve their lacrosse
team. After beating eighth ranked Rutgers at
Princeton, the team faced U.Va. last Sunday
in the Generals’ sports event of the year. The
team was in peak form, primed to deal with

the Wahoos, hoping to exploit the home field —

advantage.

The lack of support demonstrated by our
students was disgraceful. Rarely during the
match did the crowd noise rise above a con-
versational level. Instead of wild cheering to
urge our team on, our students contented

themselves with purposeless drinking and
parading new khakis and alligator shirts.
Their superficial posturing, though much in
character, all but eliminated any edge the
team had by playing at Wilson Field. The
final blow came with the fan exodus early in
the final quarter. Nothing like fan apprecia-
tion. Jack Emmer and the players are entit)-
ed to better. How sad it is that they can expect
no more from this community.
Sincerely,
Richard P. Goddard

Barritt Named Department Head

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, who
has taught Spanish at
Washington and Lee University
for 27 years, has been named
head of W&L’s romance
languages department effective
July 1. He will serve a five-year
term in that position.

Dr. Barritt succeeds Dr. G.
Francis Drake as department
head. Dr. Drake has reached 65,
the mandatory retirement age
for department heads. He will
continue teaching French.

The romance languages
department incorporates
French, Spanish and Italian
languages and literature.

The new department head is a
1943 graduate of Washington
and Lee. He received his
graduate degrees from the
University of Virginia. In addi-
tion to general Spanish
language and literature, his
fields of teaching specialty in-
clude medieval and
Renaissance poetry, fiction and
drama.

Dr. Drake, the retiring
department head, has taught at

levening will be the great
Memories of Under-
development (1958), directed by
the Cuban Filmmaker Tomas
Gutierrez Alea, which also ex-
plored the relationship between
documentary material and art.
Its fictionalized account of a
small property owner who
decides to remain in Cuba after
the Revolution, while the rest of
his family, including his wife,
flee to the United States, in-
cludes documentary sequences.
The film focuses movingly on
his memories, his political and
emotional readjustment, and
his unexpectedly vigorous sex-
ual life.

This is a post-Castro political
film, but it is utterly devoid of
polemics. It infuses a documen-
tary llok with as complex and
skeptical a sensibility as that
which informs the finest Euro-
pean films. It has the capacity
to overthrow our assumptions
that we know what Latin
American art and life are like.

The Film Society’s last movie
of the season will be the recent
Italian comedy We All Loved
Each Other So Much, to be
shown on Friday and Saturday,
May 25th and 26th.

Dee Keesler for the Spring
Term while Keesler is not here.

Voting on White Book
changes, the EC passed
changes that include explaining
the options a student has when
witnessing an honor violation.
Under the new wording, he can
either confront the suspect or
inform an EC member of a

possible violation.
The EC also voted to adopt
rules on accépting new

evidence. Now the suspect will
be allowed to decide whether
new evidence can be admitted
and gives him time to prepare
for it. The EC voted to rule that
anything a suspect says to an
EC member can be_ used
against him.

The EC adopted a policy that
a majority decision is needed
for an aquittal, of an honor of-
fense.

Buck Rogers

(continued from page 3)
All of this is calculated to draw
attention from the fact that
there is no coherent story line.
Supposedly, our hero Buck
has been floating through
space, in suspended animation,
for 500 years. When at last he is

liberated from his frigid condi- .

tion, he finds himself involved
in the murky intrigue of the
earth of the future. Buck is con-
fused, to say the least, and the
audience is baffled. The Evil
Princess is bent on taking over
the world (we got that much
straight) and the world forces
don’t like that, as they’re trying

to get friendly with the
princess. The plot starts off
nicely, but it falls apart, and
results in a sloppy blur.

It’s hard to be serious about
the acting in this film. After all,
Bob Denver could have done
more with the lead role than Gil
Gerard. Even the cast of the
doomed Battlestar Galac-
tica had talent, which puts
them way above the cast of
Buck Rogers. There is only one

solution — this film should be

shipped back to television,
preferably Saturday mornings,
where it belongs.

Seniors In Jeopardy

by Stuart Snyder

More seniors are in grade
trouble this year than before.

During the winter term there
were 288 seniors who wanted to
receive a degree, but now that
number is lowered to. 278
because of failure to meet
graduation requirements.

According to Harold S. Head,
registrar, normally about five
students cannot possibly meet
graduation requirements after
the winter term.

He added that the majority of
the ten eliminated were
commerce-school students. He
explained that no matter how
hard they work they could not
graduate in June.

He stated that there are the
usual numbers of June
graduating seniors, approx-

imately a dozen, that must com-
plete spring term courses in

order to graduate.
According to Head, some
seniors must pass certain

courses with A’s in order to
graduate, while others must
take up to nine credits this spr-
ing to fulfill their requirements.

According to Head, students
are required to file a degree ap-
plication by November 1 of their
senior year. ‘“‘We do this so that
we can council the students and
advise them of where they
stand in achieving their
degree,”’ said Head.

“You won't find this system
at larger universities. Usually
they don’t let you know until it is
time to receive your degree,”
he added.

Head stated that there are
many choices that a senior
could make if he were deficient
in credits. He also feels that
most deficiency problems
would have been cleared up if
the students had checked their
standings regularly. ‘‘All a stu-
dent has to do is come in and we
will sit down and discuss how he
is doing,’’ he added.
