W&L’s New Computer is Unreliable

Part one of a series.

by Stuart Snyder

Washington and _ Lee’s
relatively new computer
system has been having more
than its fair share of problems.
Approximately 600-students will
use the new system this year. In
the next two years, the average
student will probably use it five
more times in his courses.

Yet, neither the Harris Cor-
poration, the company from
which the computer was pur-
chased, nor Dr. Thomas Im-
eson, Head of the Computer
Center, know what the majority
of the problems stem from.
However, twenty to thirty per-
cent can be attributed to power
fluctuations caused by the Vep-
co line to the campus, said Im-
eson.

Computer “unreliable”

The superiority of this com-
puter is offset by its unreliabili-
ty. Since it was brought in on
October 27, 1977, it has broken
down or been ‘‘down”’ about fif-
teen to twenty percent of the
business weeks, Monday
through Friday, Imeson said.

In fact, in the first six months
of operation the system was not
dependable at all, comments
Imeson. However, in the “last
four months the reliability has
considerably increased, but as
yet it (the computer) is not
wholly satisfactory,” states Im-
eson.

Although the computer
operators try to keep the Center
open twenty-four hours a day, it
often goes down unexpectedly.

These unfortunate ‘‘downs”’
burden the students by making
assignments late and cramp
professors because of the pro-
blems.

During the week, it is schedul-
ed for regular ‘‘down’’ sessions.
These times are posted in the
Computer Center. The sessions
are needed for the adding or
deleting of computer user
numbers, programs and other
data. But, besides these regular
sessions, the computer takes
some of its own.

The last big shut down lasted
three-and-a-half to four days,
between Wednedsay, Sept. 20
and Saturday, Sept. 23. The pro-
blem was a combination of

University Council says:
Fancy Dress Tradition
Will Remain

by Alan Kendrick

The annual date for
Washington and Lee’s Fancy
Dress Ball will remain the
weekend after the Winter
Break, the University Council
(U.C.) decided unanimously in
last Thursday afternoon’s
crowded meeting.

The U.C.’s decision brings a
halt to a faculty movement to
set Fancy Dress forward one
week to the middle of the winter
break, ostensibly to prevent the
festivities from interfering with
classes and course preparation.

The motion to move Fancy
Dress weekend, introduced by
Harlan Beckley, assistant pro-
fessor of religion, came as a
culmination of a growing
resentment of a few faculty
members to the amount of time
‘‘wasted”’ during the week after
break by students pursuing
social activities.

Beckley stated that he
brought the motion to the U.C.
because of token approval by
students at an Executive Com-
mittee meeting last year when
further action was postponed.

The U.C., a joint committee
representing faculty, students,
and administration, has final
approval on all student affairs.
Discussion of the motion was
participated in by a number of
students and faculty members,
as well as Beckley.

Beckley stated that the entire
week between the holiday and
Fancy Dress is wasted due to
the late return by some
students, a commencement of
festivities as early as Wednes-
day, and a one to three day
hangover period after the
weekend.

Student representative Bob
Mullican said that he had not

hardware and software dif-
ficulties. Software includes the
tapes, programs and operating
systems, whereas hardware en-
compasses the _ physical
machinery. .
According to Mr. William
‘Hartbarger, the Computer
Operator, the Harris people had
been modifying some wiring in
the computer Wednesday morn-
ing and finished before lunch.

        

When Mr. Hartbarger came
back from lunch, the system
was malfunctioning. Specifical-
ly the computer showed that it
was caused by a hardware pro-

. blem.

The Harris people were called
back. After an inspection, the
serviceman found that he had
connected a wire the wrong
way; he denied that it had
anything to do with the

NUMBER 4

malfunction.

Apparently whatever the pro-
blem was, it had also affected
the software. So, for the re-
mainder of the week, the Harris
repair crew tried in vain to cor-
rect the problem.

Finally, on Friday night, they
called the Harris Corporation’s
“trouble shooter,’’ Mr. Richard
Reynolds, who is the company’s
expert. He had it working by
Saturday.

Mr. Hartbarger adds that the
bulk of the time was taken up
acquiring test parts.

To combat the plaguing pro-
blems with the computer, the
Harris Corporation is sending

two specialized represen-
tatives, one versed in hardware
and the other in software. They
will be en campus this Thurs-
day and Friday to inspect the
whole computer system in
order to determine the exact
troubles with the system.
Other problems

Other less serious but impor-
tant problems exist: over-
crowding of the terminals,
which are the students connec-
tion with the computer, and
faculty children using the com-
puter.

Students often experience an
overcrowding in the Computer

Grain Parties face

ABC “crackdown”

Sophomore class officials
have announced that, due to an

ABC “crackdown” on grain
parties, the traditional
Homecoming event at

Zollman’s Pavilion will have to
be limited to students and their
guests.

The party is scheduled for
Saturday, October 14.

“Class passes” will be re-
quired for admittance to the
party. These will be sold in ad-
vance only at the Co-op next
Tuesday through Friday, Oc-
tober 10-13, from 12 to 2 p.m.

If alumni wish to attend the
party, they may pick up special

Climbing Aoitens

A W&L freshman reportedly
took a severe fall during a
mountain climbing outing in
West Virginia last weekend.

Henry Clay, of Shreveport,
La., slipped from a sheer rock
face, fell fifteen feet to a ledge,
glanced off and continued to
drop an additional sixty feet,
where his fall was arrested ap-

proximately eight feet above a
rock ledge by his lifeline,
belayed to a piton which for-
tunately held.

Clay suffered injuries to the
head from contact with the
rocks and bruised back from
the pressure of the lifeline, but
was otherwise unhurt. He is
currently attending classes on a
normal basis.

 

Correction

Due to typographical and
printer’s errors, a story appear-
ing on the front page of last
week’s edition erroneously
stated that W&L senior Bill
Tucker had filed a complaint
against the conduct of both Lex-
ington police officer Jack Pur-
vis and Police Chief James A.
Kirby. The story should have
read:

‘Washington and Lee senior
Bill Tucker has filed a com-
plaint to Lexington Police Chief
James A. Kirby against the con-
duct of police officer Jack Pur-
vis when Purvis arrested

Tucker on charges of speeding
and driving under the influence
of alcohol (DUI).”

The story was factually ac-
curate when written, but the
first paragraph was changed
during the printing process and
the error was not caught in time
by the editor.

In addition, the advice to Tuc-
ker to file an official complaint
came not from Kirby, but from
City Manager John Doane.

The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
errors and any inconvience they
may have caused Chief Kirby.

PreMed Situation Improved

by Mike Perry

Last May, the Ring-tum Phi
reported that the acceptance
rate among applicants to
medical professional schools
had declined to 40% and that
two Phi Beta Kappa graduates
had yet to be accepted.

Dr. James Starling, coor-
dinator of the premedical ad-
visory board reports that sum-
mer acceptances have boosted
the acceptance rate among 1978
premedical graduates to 55.1%
(16 of 29) including Phi Beta
Kappa graduate John Sacco’s
acceptance to the Mediacl Col-
lege of Virginia in Richmond
and Rutgers Medical College. -

While the acceptance rates
for 1977 (65%) and 1978 (55%)
graduates re still low, Starling
points out that these percen-
tages are likely to increase in
the near future as unaccepted
graduates who reapply and gain
acceptance are added to the
total accepted for their respec-
tive classes.

The premedical advisory
group has focused its concern
on the decline in the per-
formance of Washington and
Lee students on the Medical
College Admission Test, a stan-
dardized exam taken by all ap-
plicants to medical schools.

The Medical College Admis-
sions Test, considered to be a
prime determinant in most
medical college admission pro-
cesses, now appears to place
great emphasis on the sciences.
Based on declining MCAT
scores and student feedback,
Dr. Thomas Nye, Chairman of
the Biology Department and a
member of the premedical ad-
visory group, explains that the
advisors are now recommen-
ding that premedical students

“get more science background
material before they take the
MCAT.”

The premedical
board now suggests that
students take Organic
Chemistry, a demanding
course, considered to be one of
the primary courses that
medical schools look at when
evaluating applicants, in their
sophomore rather than junior
year. The advisory board hopes
that this change will encourage
premedical students to take ad-
ditional science courses in the
fall and winter of their junior
year as preparation for the
MCAT.

Although the effects of these
ohanges in curriculum, as
reflected in student per-
formance on the MCAT and in
medical school admissions, will
not be known for three to four
years, several effects are readi-
ly apparent. Several science
faculty members fear that at-
tempts to boost MCAT scores
may jeopardize the goals of a
well-rounded and liberal arts
oriented education. Michael A.
Pleva, associate professor of
chemistry and member of the
premedical advisory board,
suggests that the addition of
organic chemistry to the
sophomore year workload
forces premedical students to
make ‘‘serious decisions earlier
in their college careers’ and
will “require a greater commit-
ment to the sciences.”

Pleva adds that premedical
faculty advisors have reluctant-
ly recommended an increase in
the number of science courses
taken by premedical students.
Many liberal arts schools are
irate over the prospects of a

advisory

change in the nature of the
MCAT, they fear that
premedical students will be
forced to study science at the
exclusion of other fields.
Medical colleges have stated a
preference for the broad educa-
tion provided at a liberal arts
college, but continue to place a
great deal of weight on the in-
creasingly science oriented
MCAT.

Acting chairman of the
Physics Department Dr.
William Newbolt feels that the
test may continue to change and
that the University ‘‘cannot
predicate an entire curriculum
on one test.’’ Newbolt
recognizes the need to better
equip the premedical students
to gain entrance to medical
school, but he claims that these
changes pose other important
problems. Dr. Newbolt claims
that the deferment of physics
until the junior year disrupts
the logical progression of the
material and will require the
addition of a general psysics
course to be taken in the junior
year. Such a course would be
geared specifically to the needs
of the premedical student.

For at least one member of
the premedical advisory group
the decision to offer premedical
students more preparation in
the sciences is merely a realiza-
tion of the needs of premedical
students. Physics Department
Chairman Dr. John Wise
believes that most premedical
students, much like the MCAT,
are oriented toward the
sciences and “‘have included at
least that much science above
the bare minimum in their ma-
jor program in the past.”

Freshman P.E. test
dropped; Law students
ask for separate
graduatin date

by Alan Kendrick

At the September University
Council meeting, Dean of
Students Lewis John announced
that, at the recommendation of
the Physical Education Depart-
‘ment, the Committee in Courses
and Degrees will drop the Motor
Ability Test as a prerequisite
for selection of freshman
physical education courses.

Also, Law School U.C.
Representative Tom Healy
brought to the attention of the
committee a grievance on
behalf of law school students
over having to wait after
finishing classes to hold their
graduation in conjunction with
the undergraduate school.

Many law students are upset
by the sixteen-day delay bet-
ween the end of law school,
which comes unusually early
according to Dean John, and the
June 7 graduation, which is
unusually late, due to the
undergraduate spring holiday.
The undergraduate and law
school graduations have tradi-
tionally been held together.

The feelings of many law
students were expressed in an
editorial by associate editor
Dave Johnson in last week’s
Law News. Excerpt follows:

“The final blow, however, in
this long endured status as se-
cond class citizens, is that law
students will be forced to wait
for two and one half weeks after
final exams to graduate, simply
because it is felt that the law
school should hold its gradua-
tion at the same time as the
undergraduate school. Many
law students have bar review
courses that will prevent them
from attending. Others have
jobs. Even for those law
students who are not prevented
from attending graduation by
one or both of these obstacles
there is still the financial
burden of being unemployed
and remaining in Lexington, or
of traveling back to Lexington.

(Healy announced that peti-
tion had been signed by 96 of 126
senior law students at the time
of the U.C. meeting.) _

Gary Dobbs said, ‘‘A double
graduation would cause
unbelievable trouble” in terms

making arrangements.

The U.C. did vote 17-5 to pass
on the law students’ proposal
“to reschedule the law school

date prior to June 4” to the

further consideration.

Fancy Dress Tradition Preserved

\(continued from page 7)

noticed students in-
discriminately skipping
classes, and that the class
absences and _ preparation
clump was probably a reflec-
tion on small work
assignments. Mullican further
stated that students should be
allowed to decide which classes
they could afford to miss, and
that the U.C. should not address
itself to restricting students’
prerogatives.

Beckley replied that his idea
was not to impose regulations,
but to construct the weekend so
that it would not conflict with
coursework or cause tempta-
tion for students; the weekend
should be scaled down where
possible, he added.

Professor Gary Dobbs of the
Biology Department stated that
he had seen opposition to the
motion last year, which had
been the first time in recent
years that the faculty had at-
tempted any influence in setting
the Fancy Dress date.

“Fancy Dress is a good op-
portunity for the
undergraduates to exercise
their own judgement,’’ Dobbs
said. ‘This motion deprive the
students of an opportunity to
practice maturity,’’ Dobbs con-
tinued.

Hank Hall, Student Activities
Board co-chairman (the com-
mittee responsible for putting
on Fancy Dress), said that it
would not be feasible to stage
Fancy Dress over the holiday.
“We sacrifice our own holidays
to present the best weekend
possible,”’ he said.

Student Executive Commit-
tee vice-president Bill Tucker
said he felt that the faculty had
become particularly annoyed
after last year when the Four
Tops concert and Fancy Dress
had been scheduled hack-to-
back.

This sequence of events was
unusual, he said, and pains will
be taken to assure that such a
close scheduling of entertain-
ment does not happen again.

“Students have the holiday to
get home and away from cam-
pus. They shouldn’t have to stay
here just to attend the dance,”
said Carren Kaston, assistant
professor of English.

“Some students would stay,
some would not. This would be
an excellent chance to exercise
their judgement,’’ Beckley
replied.

David Hamra, student co-
chairman of the U.C., said that
he viewed big weekends as ‘‘an
added incentive to work harder
before and after” the entertain-

ment events.

Kaston said that she didn’t
want the students to miss out on
Fancy Dress, but that she did
object to students missing her
class. ‘‘If teachers make the ef-
fort to hold class, students
should attend,’ she said.

When the vote was taken, all
the members of the U.C. voted
to set Fancy Dress at the nor-
mal date, one week after the
winter break (which will fall in
the first week in March this
year).

Mainstream will be there. Watch next week’s Entertainment page for coverage.

Musical Mainstream

Last Wednesday, Bob Seger
came to Roanoke to do what he
supposedly does best, i.e., to
show off his widely acclaimed
talents on stage. Considering
his reputation, which is based
almost entirely on the image of
Bob Seger as the ‘‘Old Faithful”
of rock’n’roll, the hardworking,
reliable musician who has
payed his dues on the road for
the past 13 years, one would ex-
pect him to be able to master-
fully work his audiences to
achieve whatever effect he
desired. Right? Wrong.

If anything is truly excep-
tional about Seger it is that,
despite all his years of ex-
perience and the relatively high
quality of his recent material,
he still comes across as little
more than a juurneyman rocker
trying to emulate the success of
his artistic superiors. Sure, the
crowd may have been on their
feet for nearly the entire show,
but their “Look, ma, I’m at a
rock concert’ boisterousness
actually seemed to work to
Seger’s disadvantage. It was
cruelly obvious that the majori-
ty of the audience knew Bob
Seger simply as the guy who hit
the charts with ‘‘Night Moves”’

 

a few years back. His older
songs were practically ignored
and when he sang “Beautiful
Loser’’, none seemed to know
what he was talking about.
Which is sad, for ‘‘Beautiful
Loser’’, despite the fact that it
is no more outstanding musical-
ly than the rest of his older
material, is one of the most
brutally honest recognitions of
personal failure ever written.
The title itself is a perfectly ac-
curate description of Seger’s
position in the overall scheme of
rock’n’roll. No one can question
the sincerity of his efforts, but
he is destined to remain in se-
cond place, due to no other
reason than a simple lack of

true inspiration. RM

Betsy delights;
Tycoon’ s a fright

 

 

by Dash Coufal

A few Sundays ago I caught
the nine o'clock show ofThe
Greek Tycoon, only to be disap-
pointed. Though I consider
myself a serious student of the
cinema (meaning that I see all
those obscure French movies at
obscure theaters called “Art
Houses,’’ by The New Yorker.
And you don’t even know who
Isabella Huppert is!) on occa-
sion I will go to see a “‘trashy”’
movie for sheer vicarious
pleasure. Even in the context of
being a ‘Bad’’ movie, The
Greek Tycoon is still one of the
worst movies I have ever seen,
ranking with Mothra vs. God-
zilla.

There are basically four types
of trashy movies I like’ science
fiction, spy thrillers, spaghetti
westerns, and scandal flicks. Of
these four, all that is left to us is
the scandal movie; _ those
delicious poisioned bon-bons of
sexual deviation, family
secrets, and  conspicious
money. The best of these isThe
Betsy, the worst is The Greek
Tycoon. So rhetorically I shall
ask: Why does one high budget
trashy movie succeed and the
other fail?

They both have good actors
for stars. Tycoon has Jaqueline
Bisset and Anthony Quinn (who
took the job because Jackie 0.
failed to say hello to him in a
cafe). But the supporting actors
are poor. And what good is
Bisset if they have her in bed

Eye And Ear:
From She Bookstore

Did you ever wonder what
“cutouts” are or why they’re so
cheap? Did you ever wonder
about the quality of cutout
recordings? Since you can find
them in nearly every record
store they must be popular sell-
ing items, right? Right.

A cutout is quite literally an
album that has been discon-
tinued stock. These. ‘‘cutout’’
records are then sold en masse
to cutout record companies at a
very low price. This low price is
then passed on to the dealers
who sell the cutouts cheaply to
his customers. Cutout records
can usually be identified by the
notches cut out of their jackets.
These notches are cut off the
jackets to help companies be
sure dealers don’t return
cutouts. Cutouts cannot be
returned for any reason. The
notches also help the customer
know that he should not be
paying full price for a cutout
LP.

Companies’ discontinue
albums entirely for business,
not artistic reasons. You can,
therefore, find many real gems
in the cutout bin. Many true
classics are cutouts and once an
album is cut out it is rarely

rereleased in its entirity. For
example, nearly every Beach
Boys album is now a cutout, as
are the albums of David
Bromberg, The’ Byrds,
Donovan, Dr. John, Firesign
Theatre, Richie Havens, Rare
Earth, Spirit, John Sebastion,
Three Dog Night, and many
others.

Since so many of these
coutouts will never be found
again it’s a good idea to keep
track of the cutout stock at the
record stores in town. These
stores get new cutouts every
four to six weeks. Buying
cutouts is an excellent way to
expand your record collection
without destroying your budget.

Dan Scott

with the sheets over her
shoulders and saying hack lines
like, “You don’t have to tell me
how to act! I know I am the wife
of the president!’’ Though The
Betsy has only one famous ac-
tor, Lawrence Olivier, the sup-
porting cast is excellent and
they aren’t acting in material
that is below their ability.

Plot. Plot makes or breaks
trashy movies. There are two
aspects of trashy plots, the first
is the “‘mise-en-scene”’ (in this
case scandal), the second is
conflict and resolution.

The scandal should be about a
well known family and should
tell or insinuate unmentionable
things. Tycoon is a great disap-

Jazz Review

by Spencer Leffel

After playing accoustically
for the last few years with his
Indian band Shakti, British
guitarist John McLaughlin has
returned to electric playing on
his latest album, aptly entitled
“Electric Guitarist.’’ And he
has returned with a vengeance.
This album rates. with
McLaughlin’s best Mahavishnu
Orchestra work and is one of the
best Jazz-rock records of the
year.

McLaughlin assembled a
large cast of musicians to pro-
duce the album, allowing him to
play with a different group on
every song. This not only pro-
duces interesting variety, but
also permits one to listen to the
subtle changes McLaughlin
makes in his playing as he
adapts to various musicians. He
handles all the situations well;
from his funky, humorous play-
ing of ‘“‘Are You The One? Are
You The One?”’ to the soaring,
joyous duet with Carlos Santana
in “Friendship”, McLaughlin
demonstrates his virtuosity.

“Do You Hear The Voices
You Left Behind?’’, the best
song on the album, is strictly
jazz. Dedicated to tenor sax-
ophone immortal John Col-
trane, the tune features one of
the best jazz quartets to be
assembled in recent years:
McLaughlin, Chick Corea on
piano and mini-moog syn-
thesizer, Stanley Clarke on ac-
coustic bass and Jack De-
Johnette on drums. From a
free-form beginning, the song
takes off on Clarke’s running
(not walking) bass. DeJohnette
rides with the beat on his cym-
bals, while at the same time
creating amazing rhythmic ten-
sions with off-beat snare, tom,
and bass drum shots. Besides
playing excellent accompany-
ment for McLaughlin, Corea
gets in two fine solos, one on
piano and one on synthesisor.
But McLaughlin shines

The Washington and Lee Con-
cert Guild season opens with
Terry Strange, pianist, on Mon-
day, October 9, 1978, at 8 p.m.,
in Lee Chapel.

A resident of Lexington,
Terry has contributed im-
mensely to the musical life of
the community as pianist with
the Rockbridge Chorus and Or-
chestra, organist and choir
director at the Timber Ridge
Presbyterian Church, as a
teacher at the Fine Arts
Workshop, and by maintaining
a private teaching studio in his
home.

Terry has taught at the Cadek
Conservatory in Chattanooga,
Tennesee, and at Southern
Seminary in Buena Vista. He
received his Bachelor of Music
degree from Oberlin College,
Master of Music degree from
Indiana University, studying
with Arthur Weiscz, and has
done doctoral work with Julio
Estevan at the Peabody Conser-
vatory in Baltimore. He has
performed at King College in
Bristol, Tennesee, and has had
recitals locally.

brightest. Unlike many
guitarists (Al DiMeola_ im-
mediately comes to mind),
McLaughlin knows when and
when not to show his hand; he
doesn’t try to blow you away
with his fastest licks when they
aren’t appropriate. But the
sizzling rhythms provided here
by Clarke, DeJohnette and Cor-
ea practically beg for hot solo-
ing, and McLaughlin cooks. His
playing is crisp, tasteful and in-
deed reminiscent of some old
Coltrane solos. This song alone
might be worth the price of the
album.

Happily, the rest of the album
is excellent as well. It would be
difficult to find a better line-up
of jazz-rock musicians. Besides
those already mentioned, the
album includes drummers Billy
Cobham, Tony Williams and
Michael Walden, bassists Jack
Bruce and Alphonso Johnson,
keyboardist Patrice Rushen
and violinist Jerry Goodman.
This is still a partial listing, but
if you’ve been following jazz-
rock at all, no more names are
necessary to make the point.
It’s hard to go wrong with musi-
cians of such high calibre, and
McLaughlin hasn’t. His return
to the electric guitar is a
triumph.

A Grit’s Eye View

by Carl Perry

Catchy title, right? Now you
are probably expecting an off-
beat story about some local
hoodlum’s views of world pro-
blems. But that is not the case.
This column will be a semi-
regular feature of theRing-tum-
Phi, especially for the W&L grit
community.

It probably comes as a sur-
prise to many that such a com-
munity exists, but let me assure
you that there is a sizable

The program for this recital
comprises the music of Bach,
Albeniz, Griffes and features
the monumental Variations and
Fugue on a Theme of Handel by
Brahms. As with all Concert
Guild presentations, student ad-
mission is free.

 

Ace Weems and the Fat Meat
Boys will perform in the
Cockpit tonight from 7:30 -
10:30. This is their first per-
formance in the Cockpit this
year.

They placed second in Old-
time competition at Lithia, and
won first place at the competi-
tion at Johnson City. They have
played at the Sea View Inn on
Martha’s Vineyard for two of
the past three years, and the
other year was composed of a
tour through Europe, with
many engagements in Ger-
many, Paris, France, and even
the Brazen Head in Dublin,
England. They recorded an
album last spring for the Car-
ryon label, which shotld be
coming out soon.

minority of grits on campus.
Unfortunately, due to social
pressures, most are forced to
keep their affliction to
themselves. But probably a
greater surprise is that even
more W&L men are ‘‘latent’’
grits.

Self-Help Quiz

The prupose of this first col-
umn is to help you latent grits
out there discover yourselves
via a self help quiz. Below are
several auestigns; if you
' any one of
esitate before
quite possibly
you have been a grit for many
years and have never known it.

Do you feel your heart race a
little faster when you see a car
leaving rubber at an intersec-
tion? Or when you turn on the
“ole” C.B. and put the petal to
the metal? Do you think PBR
should be the national drink,
served at all state occasions?
Do you have this almost un-
controllable urge to wear white
socks with your tuxedo? Do you
enjoy the feel of a gun in your
hands? Do you get particular
satisfaction when you physical-
ly dominate your wimpy room-
mate?

Prabably a majority of you
had difficulty saying no to one
or more questions (living North
of the Mason-Dixon line is no ex-
emption, either). Consequently
you have some tendency toward
grithood. So consider this col-
umn your guide to happiness
and the good things in life.

In future weeks, such things
as the grits’ answer to baseball,
how to make moonshine, and
other topics of interest will be
discussed.

club organizes

In its first several meetings,
the club, which is open to both
majors and non-majors in
English, detailed the aims of
the club for the comming school
year.

A prime activity of the club
will be the sponsorship of
speakers on literary topics of
general, but not exclusive in-
terest to students enrolled in
English courses. To this end,
the club was granted $100 by the
E.C. during the recent budget
hearings.

Other club interests include
the organization of a group of
seminars to aid majors in
preparing for the English com-
prehensive examination.

Another function of the club
will be to send a_ student
representative to departmental
meetings to insure that student
opinion with regard to cur-
riculum and other matters is
expressed.

As well the club forsees play-
ing some role in the selection of

 

new faculty members. (i.e., as
is the case at some other
schools, this would include lun-
ching with a job candidate and
offering impressions of said
candidate to the dapartment. )

The club wants to illuminate
the selection process for
seminar topics, which are now
the object of student sugges-
tions, though nobody knows
quite how.

Finally, the club plans to con-
tact similar groups at neighbor-
ing schools in an effort to share
information and activities. In
this vein, today marks the open-
ing get together of the Sweet
Briar Play Reading Group.
With a carlaod of English club
members in attendence the
group will open their season by
reading ‘‘Philadelphia Story”

The English club will con-
tinue to meet periodically to
discuss the issues as well as
future club activities. All in-
terested students are cordially
invited to attend.

control of the corporation bet-
ween Olivier and his grand-son
Lucian. The movie ends when
the great-grand- daughter’s
lover. (a brilliant engineer)
wins the stock fight by buying
stock with mafia money. Ty-
coon has no ending, The Betsy
does.

Sex is absolutely necessary
for trashy movies. Not the overt
sex found in blue (perhaps more
aptly called ‘“‘pink’’) movies,
but fleeting glimpses and seduc-
tive manners. The thrill is in-
tended to be who is going to bed
with whom and how they got
them there, rather than what
they do there; seduction is the
key. Here Tycoon fails again.
Quinn beds two women in Ty-
coon. The first is his mistress
from the start, so there is no
seduction there and besides the
only thing we see them do is
wrestle in bed (he gets a knee in
the groin.) In order to get Ja-
queline Bisset in bed he has to
marry her, yawn; and we only
see her completely covered by
almost unwrinkled sheets.
Yawn. The Betsy is tremendous
in this respect however. So-
meone is always seducing or be-
ing secuded, and half the time
it’s Oliver. Never overt, the sex
is noe the less deliciously
voyeuristic; Yum Yum.

In short, The Greek Tycoon is
a waste; but I’d go out of my
way to see The Betsy.

musicians

Recently, they were denied
the chance to play at a
Democratic Rally for Andrew
Miller because of their name.
None of the members of the
band answers questions about
their intriguing name, but
research by a history major has
paid off: Ace Weems was a very
influential shepherd in Scotland
during the sixteenth century,
and his “Fat Meat Boys” are
said to be the first members of a
very selective shepherd union.
When one of “The Boys”
became overly attached to one
of Ace’s sheep, he killed the boy
on the spot, and fled to nearby
Nelson County with all of his
Boys. For years they continued
to herd sheep during the day,
and fiddle like hell one the
nights.

The band members are:
James Leva and Chad Crumm
on fiddle, Forest McQuire on
banjo, Steve Seal on guitar and
Michael James Kott on cello.

Also slated for a performance
in the Cockpit is the band,
“Trigger Happy’’. At this time
they are the second hottest band
in the entire city of Baltimore,
and play a very fine mixture of
rock and roll and country rock.
They will be playing from 8:00
until 12:30, and there will be a
cover charge, all of which will
go directly to the band. The
charge will be $1.00 for all
students and their dates; $1.25
for all others.

bined with endless references to
Harleys, sidewalks ‘‘paved with
gold,” neon signs, and “‘broken
angels,”’ serve to undermine the
validity of any spark of
originality that might occa-
sionally appear. Add to all this
the fact that Chinnock’s (you
guessed it!!) gravelly baritone
is one of the most unwieldy and
lifeless voices I have ever heard
on record, and you come up
with what is surely one of the
most brutal efforts to the vinyl
shortage in recent memory. ae

Convention :

This is one in a series of ar-
ticles describing the 1980 W&L
Republican Mock Convention—
its development § and
progress.

At the Executive
Committee’s budget hearing
last week the Mock Convention
made no request for funding
this year. It was, therefore, no
major shock or setback when
none was received. The Mock
Convention, however, is in no
way a-cheap exercise. It’s

estimated that the 1980 conven-
tion’s total expenditures will ex-
ceed $40,000. Although it sounds
like a lot it’s easy to see where
the money goes when the wide
variety of costs are broken
down.

Paying for speakers both
before and during the conven-
tion weekend takes up about a
tenth of the budget. This in-
cludes not only the standard
honorarium but the expenses in-
curred by the speakers
themselves. Turning the gym
into the Convention Center
takes an enormous amount of
decorations and labor. The prin-
ting of the journal, which is
usually distributed for free, is a
rather sizable expense. The ma-
jority of the money used in put-
ting on a convention the size of
W&L’s is in the actual research
iteslf. These expenses include
printing, postage, and
telephone use. Altogether it ac-
counts for about a third of the
budget. This is‘one of the things
that makes the convention at
Washington and Lee unique -
the emphasis above all else
upon accuracy.

The surprising thing about
the Mock Convention is just how
cheap it is for students
themselves. The five dollar ad-

The morning after —

Thurston Howell IV (Where
else besides W&L would a
Howell go?) wearily rolls out of
bed im his second floor, one
room suite, at TKB (Tappa
Kegga Brew). The reason for
Thurston’s ‘“early’’ arousal
(It’s 9:30 a.m. and his first class
isn’t ‘til “‘D’’.) is that one of his
loving fraternity brothers
hadn’t gotten enough of ‘‘Be
Young, Be Foolish’ the night
before, even though the party
clamored on until a mere six
hours ago, and just had to get
his fix by blasting his stereo so
loud that the dentist and his
secretary located across the
street are now doing the Swing.

Our hero dresses in the school
uniform; you heard what that
consists of in this column last
week, folks. Notebooks now
must be found amongst the clut-
ter of his room. ‘‘Hammers and

Nails” and ‘Chopsticks 101”
meet today while the search for
the books to his courses in
“Primitive Art in Mozambi-
que’ and “Rocks for Jocks’’
can wait for tomorrow.

Last night’s regalia left a
devastation to rival Hiroshima.
Most of the windows are things
of the past, and being the mid-
dle of January the living room
is more frigid than the biggest
prudes from the Briar, although
one considerate soul managed
to wedge a VMI Keydet into one
of the frames. Meanwhile, the
poor Rat is wondering how
many demerits he gets for hav-
ing his boots filled with beer.
Little does he know that the
penalty for missing a night in
the barracks (otherwise known
as A.W.0.L.) is attendance at a
W&L Faculty meeting, a fate
far worse than the firing squad.

dition to the student tax is the
only direct financial contribu-
tion students make. Broken
down over four years it comes
out to a dollar and a quarter a
year for one of the most rewar-
ding and memorable of college
experiences. The rest of the fun-
ding comes from three major
sources.

First and most important are
the contributions from parents
and foundations. Specifically,
the Halton W. Sumner’s Foun-
dation of Dallas, Texas has
been most generous over the
years with the convention. Con-
tributions undoubtedly account
for the majority of the Conven-
tion’s income. Revenue from
journa! advertisements offer
the next source of income. The
money is used to help defray the
cost of the journal’s printing.

Lastly, the state delegations
raise money themselves in a
number of ways. The money the
States raise goes towards the
building of their floats, delega-
tion parties, and any research
costs not covered by the Steer-
ing Committee. A small tax is
levied upon the delegations to
help cover the costs they incur
at the expense of the entire con-
vention. With these four sources
of income the convention should
be able to maintain its relative
size. The increase in certain
costs such as postage have put a
little greater strain on the con-
vention but an ambitious
development program should
help meet demands.

later.

Dr. Turner’s research in-
terests included computer
technology, and he was exten-
sively involved in the develop-
ment of W&L’s computer
center. In 1967-68 he carried out
pioneering research for the U.S.
Office of Education on the im-
plications of modern technology
for small-college libraries.

W&L President Huntley, then a
professor of law, worked -with
Dr. Turner in the early stages of
that research.

Dr. Turner was a deacon of
Manly Memorial Baptist

Thurston settles down to the
newspaper where he finds that
even if W&L can’t win a game
at least they have no trouble in
scheduling them; ‘Everybody
wants us for their Homecoming
game.” A quick perusal of the
comics brings Howell up to date
on Popeye and the Wizard of Id.
Steve Canyon is too deep. The
rest of the paper is tossed aside
as if it’s contagious. Not enough
pictures.

There’s absolutely no ques-
tion as to whether he’s going to
walk to school or not. After all,
it’s only a quarter of a mile
away, so he hops in his 1978
Grand Riviera and mutters, *‘I
wonder when I'm going to get
rid of this heap?”’ As he roars
off, Thurston is confident that
the girl he left in the rack will be
able to find her way to the bus
depot.

Freshman QB effort not
enough - W&L loses 28-14

Generals lost their Old Domi-

to Randolph-Macon College,
28-14, in a game played last

Water polo Generals go 2-0;
tourney this weekend

by Sam Campbell

The water polo Generals,
W&L’s most successful and
most exciting fall team, started
off their 1978 season with a bang
last Saturday as they captured
the Johns Hopkins Invitational
Championship. The Generals’
two victories in the meet (over
Villanova 10-7 and Hopkins 18-16
in overtime) were the first two
victories for any fall team.
Drew Pillsbury had seven goals
and Biff Martin three in the first
contest, and Martin came back
with eleven goals in the second
game, while Keith Romich
scored three and Bob Newcomb
and Pillsbury scored two each.

Coach Bill Stearns. cited
teamwork as the key factor in
the victories at Hopkins.
Stearns pointed out that no
starters were lost from last
year’s 11-9 team, and that the
experience of this year’s team
should be its strength. Besides
All-Staters Martin, Romich,
and goalie Will Hodges, the
other returning stafters are
Pillsbury, Newcomb, Mike
Foley, Chip Hoke, and Bill
Meyer. Stearns also is im-
pressed withthe unselfishness
the team has shown so far, and
stressed the importance of a
good passing game against
schools with better swimmers
than the Generals. This game
plan paid off against Hopkins in
the championship game, when
the Generals beat the same
team which won the small col-
lege swimming championships
last year with its passing game.

In identifying the weaknesses
of the team, Sterns was quick to
point out that the Generals lack
depth at every position, and
fatigue could definitely be a fac-
tor when the tournament
schedule starts and the team
plays five games in three days.

Players with little or no ex-
perience in water polo will be
able to gain valuable playing
time as the team approaches
the toughest part of the
schedule. Rookies Aric Johnson
and Herb Gresens have proven
themselves in competition,
though, and several cther less
experienced players will likely
have the same chance before
the season is over.

The team’s next challenge is
the Southern League Tourna-
ment starting Friday night at
W&L, with the Generals taking
on the University of North
Carolina at 7 p.m. in the Cy
Twombly pool. Admission is
free for the entire tournament,
which features UNC, Georgia
Southern, George Washington
University, Duke University,
and East Carolina University.

only 45 yards shy of an all-time rushing record.

Saturday at Wilson Field. The
loss, the General’s fourth in a
row, did have a positive side
because W&L may have found
the man to cure their offensive
woes-freshman quarterback
Rich Hachenburg.

Hachenburg, called on to

replace Scott Swope late in the
second quarter, was able to put
together two scoring drives. It
was the first time this year that
the Generals scored two
touchdowns in one game. ‘‘Rich
came in and gave the offense a
real spark’, said Coach Gary
Fallon. ‘“‘He showed great poise
for a freshman under that type
of pressure.”’

Hachenburg’s heroics proved
to be in vain, as the Generals
fell victim to their old nemesis-
the turnover. W&L turned the

ball over six times, including
four fumbles and two intercep-
tions. Three of these turnovers

the Washington and Lee football

Soccer team comes
up short twice

by Tim Connors
Washington and Lee played
Averett College and Eastern
Mennonite College this week,
and in each game came up on
the short side of a 2-0 score.
Although both games were
decided by the same score, each
had a character all its own.

Against Averett, W&L did not
play a_ particularly strong
game. Coach Rolf Piranian felt
that Averett was ‘not very
disciplined, that they only had
one or two good players’ and
that they played as a “‘bunch of
individuals.’’ He was not pleas-
ed with the way his team played

in this game, as W&L was still
unable to give a total team ef-
fort for the entire game.

When the Generals travelled
to Eastern Mennonite on Satur-
day, it was a different story.
Piranian said that E.M.C.,
which sports a 7-1-1 record for
1978, is ‘‘a very good ballclub”’
and he felt that his team
“outplayed and outhustled”
their opponents, but once again
failed to put the ball in the net.
W&L was hurt by an early goal
which resulted from what Pira-
nian called a ‘‘freaky play’’, but
the Generals did not give up,

scene. This bright young force
is freshman quarterback Rich
Hackenburg.

Hachenburg, a graduate of
Miramar High School in
Miramar, Florida, did nothing
more than complete seven of
twelve passes, for 161 yards and
no interceptions, score one
touchdown himself and throw
for another. This all came in
just over two quarters of play.
Hachenburg entered the game
with just 2:36 left in the half. In
his first series as a college

quarterback, he marched the
Generals 64 yards in six plays to
their first touchdown of the
game. Forty-nine of those yards
came off Hachenburg’s arm, in-
cluding the final seven on a TD
pitch to fellow frosh Mike
Fogarty. Midway through the
third period, the young quarter-
back knotted the score at 14
with an ll-yard scramble to
paydirt. Not a bad day for a
freshman.

Hachenburg came to W&L
because of its academics and
because he wanted a chance to
play college football. He
entered summer practices as
one of five freshmen vying for
the backup slot behind senior
quarterback Scott Swope.
Hachenburg never lost his con-
fidence despite the stiff com-
petition and the appearance
that the only role available was
a reserve. He kept a firm grip
on his belief that ‘‘someday I
would get a shot, and that’s all

(continued on page 14)

led to R-MC touchdowns, while
another stopped the Generals

deep in Yellowjacket territory.

It was Swope who threw both
interceptions. One was caused
by a deflected pass at the R-MC
15, while the other was picked
off by Bill Koepsel at thé W&L
45 and returned for a touchdown
and a 7-0) R-MC lead. ‘‘We ex-
ecuted well on the play’’, siad
Fallon, “their defensive back
just made a great play.”

Randolph-Macon’s_ second
touchdown was an eleven play,
49 yard effort that was set up by
Stewart Atkinson’s fumble, the
General’s third turnover, on the
W&L 49. Larry Lant’s four yard
run gave Randolph-Macon a
14-0 lead.

Just when the game seemed
to be a rout, Hachenburg came
in and marched the Generals
downfield on a six play, 64 yard
scoring drive. The freshman
connected with fullback Jim
Palermo for a 42 yard pass and,
four plays later, found tight-end
Mike Fogarty alone in the end
zone for a _ seven yard
touchdown pass. W&L trailed
R-MC 14-7.

In the third quarter, Hachen-
burg was able to repeat his
magic. With the ball on the
Yellowjacket’s 28, the Generals
appeared to be stopped on
downs when Syd Farrat’s punt
was fumbled by Alex McManus
and recovered by W&L at the
Yellowjacket’s five. On third
and goal from the eleven,
Hachenburg swept around left
end and went untouched for six
points. It was tied at 14-14 with
1:20 left in the third quarter.

As was the case in their other
games, the Generals faded fast.
McManus, up to then the goat of
the game because of his fumble,
took a pitchout and scampterd
62 yards for the winning
touchdown. The third quarter
ended on that play, and the
score was R-MC 21, W&L 14.

The fourth quarter was
dominated by Randolph-Macon.
After recovering a Hachenburg
fumble on the W&L 36, the
Yellowjackets used eleven run-
ning plays to gain their fourth
touchdown, with Halfback Mike

Woolfolk scoring from one yard’

out. The Generals made one last
threat but time expired with the
ball on the R-MC 15. The final
score was R-MC 28, W&L 14.

Even though his team is 0-4,

and is about to equal last year’s
team’s record of going 06
before a win, Fallon is not about
to panic. ‘We still haven’t
played the total game we must
to win. Our defense is still hav-
ing to work too much, but our of-
fense is improving with each
game. We're still making
mistakes, but our freshmen
have developed well and things

should turn around soon.”’
W&L plays the Maryville
Scots this Saturday in

Maryville, Tennessee. ‘Their
strength is in their defense,’’
said Fallon. ‘Offensively,
they’re alot like Randolph-
Macon. They have a scrambling
quarterback and a breakaway
runner. We should have our
hands full all day.”’

Tennis team readies for
homecoming tournament

by John Winans

Last weekend the Washington
and Lee tennis team captured
one of three matches and gain-
ed needed experience at the
James Madison Invitational
Tournament.

The Generals showed im-
provement and gained more of
that experience that Coach
Gary Franke cited as necessary
after last weeks’ tourney. The
Generals three opponents were
Madison, Virginia Tech and
University of Richmond. In the
first match they faced the host
team and beat them handily;
7-2. Singles winners against the
Dukes were Stew Jackson,

Shaw Cranfield, Dave Constine,
Pat Norris and Sumner
Bouldin. All-American Stew
Jackson had to bow out from the
next two matches due to illness.

W&L then faced a strong Rich-
mond team, ending up on the
short end in a real thriller, 5-4.
Cranfield, Yonge and Bouldin
were victorious in the singles
category while Norris and
Cranfield teamed up to take

thier doubles match. In the last
match Frankes’ netmen were
beaten by a very tough Virginia
Tech team 7-2. Yonge and
Bouldin out-scored their op-
ponents and notched another

and they continued to apply
pressure. As was the case last
week against Valley United,
W&L outshot E.M.C. 16-14, but
still lost in the first Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference con-
test for both teams. The second
E.M.C. goal came on a penalty-
kick which was awarded on
what Piranian felt was a ‘‘ques-
tionable call by the officials’,
and he felt that this was
E.M.C.’s only serious scoring
threat. The Generals were forc-
ed to play with ten men during
the last part of the game due to
one player being ejected, but
Piranian said that his team
“kept the pressure on, even
though we were a man short”.
The game was an encouraging

sign for the remainder of the
season, as Piranian said that it
was the “first game in which
(the Generals) played well as a
team all season’, and that it
was a “great effort”.

Upcoming for W&L will be a
big game on Saturday at home
against Elizabethan College
and on Wednesday, October 11,

the Generals will meet the ©

University of Richmond. Pira-
nian is looking for the team-
work displayed by W&L in the
E.M.C. game to carry over into
the remaining games on the
schedule.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Faculty follies...

Two weeks ago in this column, readers were in-
formed of the ‘“‘Fancy Dress motion” facing the
University Council. If the motion passed, all Fancy
Dress activities would occur within the Washington
Holiday. We urged students to attend the meeting;
many did, and had the pleasure of seeing it defeated
unanimously. So Fancy Dress reamins a part of the
‘“‘academic year,” like it or not.

In my excitement over the motion, I was certain
that the discussion at the meeting would be fast-paced
and hard-hitting. Unfortunately, the standard was
somewhat lower. For one solid hour, the administra-
tion members of the U.C. kept the sutdents roaring in
laughter as one foot after another entered its respec-
tive mouth.

Professor Beckley, of the religion department, had
the dubious honor of defending the motion single-
handed. (His co-author, Professor Sessions, is no
longer affiliated with the U.C.). Beckley pushed the
idea of removing a ‘“‘temptation’’ from the student
body. And then the fat hit the fire; Professor Gary
Dobbs’ southern eloquence was aroused. ‘‘This is one
further attempt to protect the students from
themselves,”” he said. “This was dying in my
undergraduate days, it’s dead now, and I want no part
of it.”’

As the meeting progressed, the comments grew in-
creasingly bizarre. One student strongly stated, “‘I’ve
learned more during certain parts of Fancy Dress
‘than I’ve ever learned in a classroom.” The faculty
responded in kind: ‘‘That’s unfortunate...you might
as well go to a social club.”’

The essential question was a valid one: can the U.C.
or any other body tell the students how to spend their
time and money? But the common sense of the matter
was lost in the fog of faculty phrases. Perhaps the
greatest of all came from Professor Beckley, in his
search for some precedent of faculty control on
students. “Of course there are things we refuse the
students,” he said. ‘‘I mean, we don’t allow them to
fornicate on the front lawn...”’ (!) If the professor
knows of some side-activity of that sort which has
ever been a real threat, I wish he’d let the rest of us in
on the action...

The debate swirled on—and so did the uncoun-
trollable laughter. One of my favorite lines was
delivered by Carren Kaston of the English depart-
ment, concerning faculty control: ‘‘I hate being an
authoritarian; I just want you to do what I tell you.’’ I
‘don’t think anyone in the room quite figured that one
out...

Soon after, the final vote was taken. The students
trooped out, satisfied with the result—and in posses-
sion of a valuable lesson. For years, many of us have
wished to witness the debates in that bastion of secret
decision-making, the faculty meeting. But if last
week’s U.C. meeting was any indication of the facul-
ty’s oratorical ability, I believe we students would
rather quit while we’re ahead.

Luce
Scholarships

New York City—Fifteen Luce
Scholars, the fifth group chosen
for participation in a program
operated by the Henry Luce
Foundation, arrived in Asia this
week to take up professional in-
ternships in locations that
range from an architect’s office
in Tokyo to a biology laboratory
in central Java. The Scholars
were selected from over 120
candidates nominated last fall
by 60 colleges and universities
across the country, including
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.
The Luce Scholars Program
was established by the founda-
tion in 1973 to give outstanding
young Americans an exposure
to Asia at an early stage in their
careers.

The competition for 1979-80
Luce Scholars is already under-
way. Nominating institutions
have been asked to present
their candidates to the Henry
Luce Foundation no later than
December 4th. Interested
seniors, graduate of profes-
sional school students, or recent
alumni under the age of 30 are
asked to contact the local Luce
Scholar liaison, Dean Edwin
Craun, for further information.
The foundation emphasizes that
applications submitted directly
to it cannot be considered.

Computer problems

(continued from page 1)
Center when more than eleven
people decide to use the Center
at one time. This often causes a
fifteen minute to an hour delay,
resulting in wasted time.
However, rest assured because
plans are being made to locate
eight more terminals in room
112 of Parmly Hall.

The problem of faculty
children using the computer to
play games can simply be solv-
ed by “bumping” them off the
terminal, Imeson said. The rule
on game playing states that if
class work needs to be done
then the class work takes
precedence. However, by rights
of the university community
and if the children are actually
performing operations with the
computer, then they cannot be
“bumped.’”’’The computer for

the University”

It has been termed “‘the com-
puter for the university’’ by Dr.
Imeson. After a rather lengthy
“suggestion period’ of four
years by the Academic Depart-
ments, the University finally
perceived the need for a new
computer. An initial investiga-
tion showed that there existed
two competative markets:
large computers and small
computers.

However, the  university’s
needs fell somewhere between
the two. There are very few
companies that deal in the im-
termediate range of computers.

The selection committee was
looking for five basic qualifica-
tions: 1) a machine that could
serve both the Academic and
Administrative needs of the
University with a high degree of
ease and accessability in opera-
tion 2) a large ‘on line’
memory 3) a device that utiliz-
ed most of the currently used
high level computer language
4) a cost that was compatable
with the University and 5) at
least seven years of use.

The University decided to buy
a computer as it had done in the
past, because if they were to
rent it each year they would be
paying approximately forty
percent of the initial value. Dr.
Imeson said renting the com-
puter would keep the University
up to date with the constantly
changing world, but W&L has

neither the need nor the ability
to constantly rent a computer.

The selection committee
finally decided on the Harris
Corporation for their computer.
Harris is one of the top com-
panies in the country. The
mother company is best noted
for inter-type, which is the na-
tional standard for newspaper
type.

Harris buys parts form other
companies and assembles them
with their own tape drives, the
mechanism that operates the
memory tapes. However, the
computer is their own deisgn.
When the computer goes
‘“down”’ the Harris people are
there to fix it within a day, but
sometimes it takes them longer
to diagnose the actual problem,
adds Dr. Imeson.

The computer itself is a Har-
ris 125. It consists of two eighty
megabit discs each with a
capacity of processing eighty
million characters of informa-
tion, two magnetic tape drives
to operate the discs, one card
reader, one line printer and a
memory of sixty million
characters.

The computer can handle
most advanced computer pro-
grams with only _ slight
modifications, which means the
university will be in step with
the growing computer sciences
for a while.

Its cost was approximately
300 thousand dollars, totally in-
stalled. However, one-third of
this cost was covered by a grant
from ‘‘The College Association
to Undergraduate Education’’,
which is The National Science
Foundation.

As part of this grant, the
Foundation provices people to
help universitites adapt to the

 

new systems. W&L’s represen-
tative is Mr. Arlon Kemple. He
is now helping to coordinate the
Politics, Economics and Social
Sciences Departments in their
use of the computer.

Another feautre of the com-
puter is its large terminal
capacity. Each costs $1024 and
is directly connected to the
computer. The Harris can han-
dle a maximum of thirty two
terminals. Sixteen are current-

Runners fall short
twice in tri-meet.

by Greg Branan

Despite another sparkling
first place finish by Washington
and Lee’s Rich Bird, the
General’s cross country team
came out on the bottom of last
weekend’s tri-meet at Virginia
Beach, Va.

Bird, a co-captain, led
throughout the 5.2 mile race. He
finished with a time of 27:27,
more than 30 seconds ahead of
the second place finisher. Bird
had finished in the same man-
ner a week earlier at the Davis
and Elkins meet. The other co-
captain, Bob Bates, was the
harrier in third, with a time of
28:10. W&L’s other scorers
were Greg Branan, Brian
Adams, and Mike Conforti.

Bird commented that the
General’s poor showing could
have been due to ‘‘the fact that
most of the course was flat and
we're not conditioned for runn-

ing on flat ground which re-
quires a strong’ steady pace.”
Such a pace is hard to achieve
when training in the mountains.
In all, ten runners made the
trip to Virginia Beach. The
others were Parker Roberts,
Carlos Solari, Howard Herndon,
Bill Sherwin and Tom Gillen.

Final scores for the Generals
were W&L 33-Norfolk State 24;
W&L 28-Roanoke 27. Scoring is
based on one point per place,
therefore the team with the
lower score wins. When com-
paring two out of three teams,
the third team’s places are ig-
nored and filled in with the two
teams places in order. The first
five men from a team score
points.

Next weekend the Generals
travel back to Virginia Beach to
face Virginia Wesleyan, Lyn-
chburg, Norfolk State and

Christopher Newport.

Rich Hachenburg is a very
confident young man. He is con-
fident of his abilities, yet he is
aware of his deficiencies. What
he lacks in physical assets, he
makes up for in desire and

motivation. Most importantly,
he is devoted to bringing foot-

ball success to W&L. There is no
question of his sincerity when
he says, “‘I’ll do anything in my

capabilities, whether on the

be exact. The *‘B’”’ soccer team

Coach Rolf Piranian’s program,
is sure to have a positive effect
on the varsity level on years to
come.

feeder program to help develop

understandable though, as the
“B” level program invites a
greater number of Freshman
and Sophomore ‘‘joueur de foot-
ball” to participate on a col-
legiate level than there would
be without such a program.
This in turn affords Coach Pira-
nian a broader selection of
talent to choose from on a year
to year basis, and which in the
end, can only make a better soc-
cer program.

W&L a winning football team.”’
That’s the kind of ball player
Rich Hachenburg is.

Hatchenburg embarks on his
college football career much
like he began his high school
career. He has had experience
in turning around football pro-
grams. His freshman year of
high school, his team registered
a 1-9 mark. His sophmore year
the team improved to 4-7 and
then 7-4 his junior year. As a
senior, he led Miramar High to
a10-0record.

Just talking with Rich
Hachenburg, one gets the
distinct impression that he
would like nothing more than to
pull an encore turnaround per-
formance for W&L. Now that
he’s gotten his shot and made
the most of it, it is time for the:
curtain to rise again on Rich
Hachenburg. Coach Gary
Fallon states this is the case. In
all probability, Hachenburg will
start against Maryville on
Saturday.

Young Republicans

by Kevin Dwyer

“Warner for Senate’’ is not
just a slogan. The W&L
Republican Club is very much
involved in seeing that the
slogan becomes a reality. The
club is working very hard to
carry Rockbridge County and
Lexington and B.V. for Warner.

The Campaign Committee
meets in the Cockpit every
Wednesday afternoon at 4:30
p.m. The first two meetings
have been very successful and
several projects are underway.
Last Friday, with the help of
numerous girls from the Mary
Baldwin CR’s, the club besieged
the Lexington High School
Homecoming Game _ with
Warner literature. Over 900
pieces were passed out. Another
home game at L.H.S. this Fri-
day will hopefully lead to
another blitz.

Every Saturday morning,
from now until the election, the
club will be bumper branding
cars in Lexington area shopping
center parking lots. The first
two outings were excellent.
Anyone interested may meet at
10 a.m. Saturday mornings in
the lobby of the Student Center.

Along with the Rockbridge
County Republican Committee,
the club will be operating night-
ly phone banks from the county
headquarters, located on
Washington Street next to the
Dutch Inn. The purpose of this
is to identify and draw out the
Warner supporters. As John
Warner went to Washington and

Lee and currently sits on our

g GZ a g g Y g

Al tal tal Ge
Hiv} | “J 7]

Board of Trustees, the support
for him in the area is probably
very strong. Anyone interested
in working with any of the
above projects can contact
Kevin Dwyer at 463-3861.

Virginia Republican Senator
William L. Scott was scheduled
to speak to the club at the Oc-
tober General meeting next
week, but his sister passed
away and thus his schedule was
thrown into disarray. Attempts
are being made to obtain a
replacement.

Lone term plans include the
revival of a significant publica-
tion of the club. In addition to
the monthly Tucknewsletter to
members, the club used to
publish a journal of political
thought and commentary, en-
titled the Washington and Lee
Republican Forum. Such
leaders as J. Kenneth Robinson
and Barry Goldwater, Jr. have
been contributors. Chuck Stin-
nett is going to be the Editor of
this year’s edition, which will
hopefully appear in January.

“At the same time, the pro-
