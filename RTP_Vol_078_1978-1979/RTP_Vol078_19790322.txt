74. Vie Monday
For Class Offices

by David Greer

The student body Executive
Committee received 73 petitions
for class officer elections. (For
the names of candidates, see the
sample ballot on page 2.)

Daniel Carucci announced
that he is running for Senior
Class Vice President-Science as
a write-in candidate.

The campaigning is
restricted to a $10 spending
limit, 15 posters at any one time
(no more than five on the Colon-
nade), and one banner.
Freshman posters are
restricted to the dorms and
Evans Dining Hall.

Elections will be held Monday

 

Student Poll

The Ring-tum Phi will con-
duct a student opinion poll Mon-
day during the elections for
class officers and EC represen-
tatives.

The poll will be at the various
polling places around the cam-
pus and will deal with issues
pertinent to the student body.

We urge all students to spend
the two minutes it will take to
fill out the questionnaire and let
their opinion be counted.

 

 

 

and run-offs will be Thursday.

In other business, the Student
Actitities Board said that there
was a profit of about $1,900 from
Fancy Dress.

The SAB saved money on the
Thursday night entertainment,
the Vandales, and on not being
able to have coins minted this
year, SAB treasurer Bill Ridge
said.

The profit will goto a Spring’s
Weekend concert, the SAB
hopes. The SAB has about
$18,000 to spend on the weekend.

One SAB member said that
there is a chance that the con-
cert might be Jimmy Buffet and
The Pussette-Dart Band, but
that is not definite.

Freshman Stuart Miller
presented to the EC a petition to
have cheerleaders from area
girls’ schools perform at foot-
ball and lacrosse games.

Stuart Body president Beau
Dudley said that he thought
there ought to be W&L students
on the team too.

Senior EC representative Rob
Calvert said that cheerleaders
in the past “caught so much
shit” that the problem would
‘not be in getting them, but
keeping them.”

Miller said that in the past

McCarthy

McCarthy, Rusher Debate

American life.

“The voluntary army was a
mistake,’’ former Sen. Eugene
McCarthy told a large audience
last night in Washington and
Lee University’s Lee Chapel.

McCarthy’s support for
reinstituting some form of
draft system to supplement the
present all volunteer military
was one of the few issues on
which the former senator
agreed with William A. Rusher,
the conservative publisher with
whom he debated various pro-
blems currently confronting the
United States.

“It will take a liberal, not me,
to assure you that there will not
be a draft ever again,’’ Rusher
had said before McCarthy
spoke.

Most of Rusher’s comments
on foreign policy centered on
building an ‘‘adequate and suf-
ficient’’ defense. ‘“‘We must
have a proper defense of this
country against external
threats,” he said.

Rusher implied that the
Soviet Union was the United
States’ chief adversary in the
international arena and that the
U.S.S.R. had won many Third
World countries over to their
side in the past ten years.

McCarthy against overarm-
ing in response to preceived
foreign threats and questioned
talk of ‘the missile gap.”

“The Russians have 5,000
horses in their army and we on-

Lexington, Virginia,

March 22, 1979

ly have 29 and they primarily
pull caissons in Arlington
cemetary,’’ McCarthy said in
mock comparison to the
“missile gap” argument.

“There is never enough
security,’’ McCarthy said. “If
we can destroy the Russians
with two percent (of the United
States’ nuclear capabilities),
then what are we going to do
with the other 98 percent?”’

‘*Each branch of defense feels
the need to have enough
firepower to destroy the world
and each other,’ McCarthy
said. ‘‘We are overarmed in
terms of nuclear weapons.”

Rusher disagreed.

‘It is irresponsible to suggest
that the number of missiles on
one nuclear submarine will suc-
cessfully destroy five cities,’ he
said in response to McCarthy's
charge of defense overarma-
ment. ‘‘Maybe it (the sub-
marine) won't. Maybe the sub
will sink. Maybe it will miss.”’

Rusher said that he had not
heard it said anywhere that the
United States had enough
nuclear fire power to “totally
destroy’’ Russia.

In domestic affairs, the
former U.S. Senator from Min-
nesota and the conservative
publisher and columnist again
disagreed on the effectiveness
of federal regulatory agencies
and the amount of government
involvement necessary in

NUMBER 21

 

Rusher

Rusher used the recent
deregulation of the airlines and
the resulting lower fares as a
positive example of govern-
ment deregulation of industry.

But McCarthy said that the
lower fares had just encouraged
more people to fly during the
current energy crisis. He said
that the increase in airline
passengers has resulted in one
billion gallons more fuel being
used than when the airlines
were under federal regulation.

Rusher said that the expan-
sion of government under
‘liberal’ politicians has
resulted in the difficulties that
will face the United States in the
1980s.

‘We have tried liberalism
and we got the imperial
presidency, we got the welfare
rip-off, and we got the bankrupt
cities in the Northeast,’’ Rusher
said. “We have trifled once with
double digit inflation and it
looks as if we will again.”’

He said that California’s Pro-
position 13 indicated a strong
sentiment throughout the na-
tion, ‘not just a budget balanc-
ing impulse,’ but as a new

Foster Named To

Student Recruitment

by David Greer

Jay Foster was named co-
chairman of the student recruit-
ment committee, in an an-
nouncement obtained by the Phi
this week.

Foster, a junior from Ab-
ington, Pa., will serve next year

    
       
   
     

463-3013 or 463-9400

with Charles Terry.

Foster was chosen from eight
applicants by the present co-
chairmen, Bill Thistlethwaite
and Terry, with the aid of Direc-
tor of Admissions William Har-
tog and admissions counsellors
Mark Putney and Jim
Underhill.

The co-chairman are respon-
sible for scheduling tours for
prospective students and for
Honor Week activities. The
committee itself, founded by a
group of present seniors and ad-
missions officials in 1976, aims
at promoting the image of the
University among prospective
students by bringing them into
contact with interested — up-
perclassmen.

Hartog said that he was ‘‘ex-
tremely pleased’’ to have
Foster selected.

‘“Jay’s background, his _in-
volvement in other activities on
campus, his willingness to
‘spread the word’ were _in-
strumental in our selection,”
Hartog said.

Murph was also presented
with a sweater in appreciation
for his many services over the
years.

Recently Murph has been in-
strumental in avoiding conflicts
with police over noise violations
by patrolling on party nights
and issuing warnings to houses
that are too loud.

The IFC also announced that
fraternity inspection lists are
due March 27.

All fraternities will be visited
on March 28 by the Fraternity
Inspection Committee for a

The Guardsman: A four-star success

by Parker Potter

Lee Kahn’s The Guardsman
is just what this theatre season
needed. Near the end of a
season which has tended to be
experimental and somewhat
unsatisfying — along comes this
gem, cut and polished by Kahn
and everyone associated with
the production.

Even before the orange cur-
tain rises the viewer is sent on
his way to Budapest by the
Chopin piano piece which we
learn is being played by Ilona in
her living room. The curtain
opens on all the main
characters, Ilona (Betty Kahn)
and her husband Nandor (Grant
Kunkowski) both actors.

Present as well are Bela
(Kurt Kammerer) and Mother
(Ginger McNeese), both friends
of the newly married couple. In
a verybally dazzling opening
scene the sorry state of Ilona
and Nandor’s six-month mar-

riage is deftly articulated
against Tom Ziegler’s
marvelous set.

The rapport between costume
and scene in The Guardsman is
remarkable. In the first scene
the ever-constant Bela wears a
coat which probably matches
the wallpaper while Nandor in
his red smoking jacket stands
out against the pastels of the
room, as the spectacle that he
is.

The coherence of the sets and
the costumes to the sense of the
play is paralleled by the
coherence of the acting.
Molnar’s play operates on a
number of levels, each inex-

tricably tied to the rest. As
noted above, Ilona and Nandor
are actors. One level of inter-
pretation asks whether and
when, each has stepped out
from behind a theatrical pose.
Kunkowski is particularly

adept at slipping in an out of the
characters of Nandor. Like
Nandor, Kunkowski has a com-
mand of many roles at once. His
Nandor is completely distinct
from his Guardsman. Yet, at
these moments when Nandor

shines through the Guardsman
character, Kunkowski always
has a firm hand on the rudder.
Kunkowski has a presence not
unlike that of Taylor Harbison.
The whole play is in his eyes. He

Love Beach
Emerson, Lake & Palmer

At the risk of angering the
rabid ELP-haters in Musical
Mainstream’s __ readership,
there’s something that needs to
be said at the beginning of this
review: Love Beach is not
pretentious.” The same is true,
for that matter, of most of the
band’s recorded work. Preten-
sion is an attitude toward one’s
music and one’s fans; it is nota
musical style. Many of the
music-buyers and critics who
condemn ELP’s_ extended,
keyboard-oriented pieces as
pretentious would very likely
rave about Lou Reed’s self-
indulgent sixteen minute
monologue masquerading as
‘“‘Walk on the Wild Side”’ (on the
Take No Prisoners album)...or
Devo’s theory on the role of de-
evolution in the social develop-
ment of mankind (ya wanna run
that one by me one more time,
fellas? ). That’s pretentious.

trying to figure out how to
describe the record’s sheer
awfulness, and I’m afraid I'll
have to take the easy way out —

Greg Lake has always been
ELP’s weak link. His guitar
playing is passable at best, and
his songwriting talents are vast-
ly overrated. Sure, he’s written
some great ones — “Lucky
Man” and ‘“‘From the Beginn-
ing,’ to name just two. He’s
also been re-writing the same
basic material since day one
(somebody ought to tell this guy
there’s more to life than love
songs). Lake has been blessed
with a great voice, which he’s
always used to its full ad-
vantage in concert and on
record...until now. His phrasing
and intonation on Love Beach
are poor indeed, and the lyrics
are downright painful in places

dodging and shifting into and
out of characters. Kunkowski is
always in control of a character
who could either back down an
actor — or run away with him.

Kunkowski is excellent — but
the other players shine too. Bet-
ty Kahn’s Ilona is an ambiguous
delight. With Ilona — one never
quite knows.

She says she’s not taken in by
Nandor’s Guardsman — but
what do we make of her
“confession” to Bela — her
statement of the Guardsman’s
masculine magnificence? What
do we make of the light Mother
sees in Ilona’s eyes — the
sparkle of love? And the final
stroke is Ilona’s stroll to the
window which closes the play.

We are deliberately left hang-
ing. And Betty Kahn weaves
together all the diverse threads
which make up Ilona. She is the
perfect foil (but much more
than a foil) to Kunkowski. All
the playing and posing that
Nandor does loudly, Ilona, also
an actor, does in her own quiet
way. And Kahn doesn’t let that
slip away.

The part of Bela is done am-
ple justice by Kurt Kammerer.
Insightful but not sharp, good
natured and ever attentive,
Bela is exactly the kind of man
who by virtue of his tempera-
ment is perfectly suited to be a

Foster’s goal gives W&L win

Generals escape

near disaster in
8-7 thriller...

by Doug Linton

Some 1000 sunbathers looked
on as the Generals nipped the
Battling Bishops of Ohio
Wesleyan by a score of 8-7 in
overtime at Wilson Field on
Tuesday. Jay Foster had the
game-winning shot with 2:56
gone in the first four minute
overtime period.

Both teams started out very
sloppily. This set the pace for
the entire game, as it was long,
sloppy, slow and dull. Loose
dogs running out onto the field
seemed to be more entertaining
than the squads battling out on
the playing area.

Ohio Wesleyan’s first goal
was a fluke. General keeper
Bob Clements carried the ball
out over the restraining line in
an attempt to clear, but his pass
was intercepted at midfield.
Rick Boyle then shot into an
open goal to give the Battling
Bishops a 1-0 lead. John Black
finally tied it at 1-1 as he took a
Sandy McDonald pass with 6:53
left in the first period. But it on-
ly took OW 21 seconds to answer
that goal, giving the Bishops a
2-1 edge at the end of the first
period.

The second quarter was more
than half over before John
Kemp netted one of the
Generals two ‘‘man-up”’ goals
to tie the game at 2. The other
other goal in the period was also
“man-up” with Mike Pressler
feeding foster. Foster used good
judgement, electing to back up
and take a more controlled shot,
rather than go for the
quickstick. The Generals led 3-2
at the half.

It took Ohio Wesleyan about
one minute into the second half
to tie the score at 3-3. Jeff Fritz
then responded with two
straight unassisted tallies.
After four games, Fritz is
averaging two goals per outing.
These two scores made it 5-3 in
favor of the Generals at the end
of the third quarter.

Ohio Wesleyan’s fourth goal
came at 12:50 — when they
were a man-down. As_ the
Bishops continued to get psych-
ed, Geoff Brent put one in,
unassisted, to make it 6-4,
Generals. Next, OW had a two-
on-one_ situation against
Clements and it was 6-5. Brent
again responded with his se-
cond unassisted tally of the
game to widen the margin to 7-5
for W&L. OW put one more in at
4:07, making it 7-6, and began

thinking realistically about an
upset. Their psyche was over-
whelming to the seemingly
passive Generals. OW then
scored a second man-down
goal, tying the score at 7-7 with
2:39 left in regulation time.

Netmen outmatched in Div. I

by Nat Lovell

On Saturday, March 17, the
Generals lost to a_ visiting
Morehead State Team.
Morehead, a Division I school,
had recruited its top five
players from England with the
sixth coming from Sweden. The
dominated the singles, taking
advantage of what turned out of
be a bad day for some of the
W&L netmen.

At number one singles,
Stewart Jackson lost in three
sets to Richard Leslie 3-6, 6-4,
6-3. Shaw Cranfield turned in a
powerful performance in
beating Dhan Shapurgi 6-3, 6-3,
for the Generals’ only singles
victory. Number three Doug
Gaker went down to Nick Lee
6-3, 6-2. Dave Constine felt he
had “played well,”’ but never-
theless, fell to Philip King 6-2,
6-2. At number four, Pat Norris
could not keep up with the
heavy topspin shots of Martin
Watts and was defeated 6-3, 6-0.
In the final singles match, Wes
Yonge lost a close match to the
swift Swede, Eric Nyberg, 6-4,
6-4.

In doubles, Jackson and Cran-
field lost to Leslie and Shapurgi
in two close sets 7-5, 6-3. The se-
cond doubles team of Gaker and
Constine lost in two sets also,

6-4, 6-4. The last match of the

“day came to a conclusion in a

tense tie-breaker, unfortunately

it went the other way for the
Generals, as Norris and Yonge
lost to Watts and Nyberg, 5-7,
6-2, 7-6.

The following Monday, March
19, the netmen road-tripped to
the University of South Carolina
only to meet defeat in a match
of many tie-breakers — most of
which went in USC’s favor.

Number one, Stewart
Jackson should be commended
for a fine effort against highly
regarded Chris Mayotte (rank-
ed No. 1 in New England
juniors). Jackson did lose,
however, 7-6, 6-3. Shaw Cran-
field was dealt his first loss of
the season at the hands of Bob
Detrich in a very close match
7-6, 7-6. In the absence of Doug
Gaker, Dave Constine moved
into the third slot and fell victim
to Barry Gilbert 6-1, 6-1. Wes
Yonge lost a close match to
David Kramer 7-5, 6-2. Bob
Schuler saw his first varsity
playing time of the season in his
loss to Dru Kefalos 6-1, 6-0.
Sumner Bouldin filled in for the
final singles match but lost 6-1,
6-2.

In doubles, the number one
team of Jackson and Cranfield

saved a little face for the
netmen in beating Kramer and
Gilbert in yet another neck-and-
neck match 7-46, 4-6, 7-6. Con-
stine and Schuler went out
quietly to Anstopoulo and
xefalos 6-2, 6-3. In the third
doubles spot, Yonge and
Bouldin were run over by
Sandler and Fercy, 6-1, 6-1.

Though the Generals may be
taking some lumps in some of
these matches, one does well to

are against Division I schools
who recruit their players with

Syracuse in

10-7 contest

by Doug Linton

The Varsity Lacrosse team
dropped a very important early
season game to the Orangemen
of Syracuse by a score of 10-7
Saturday at Wilson Field. The
team came out on the short end
by the end of the day, but things
could have been a lot different.

The beginning of the game
was incredible. Within 1:36 into
the first quarter, the score was
already 2-2; it looked like the
beginning of a high scoring con-
test. But this was not to be the
case. After George Santos and
Jeff Fritz opened the scoring for
the Generals and tied the game,
both defenses settled down. The
only other shot to hit its mark in
the quarter, came off the stick
of John Black with only 2:53 left
in the period to give W&L a 3-2
lead. This turned out to be the
one and only time the Generals
held the edge throughout the en-
tire game.

In the second quarter the
fans, some 3500 had to sit and
watch as their Generals were
shut out. It turned out to be
quite a long period as the only
scoring was three goals for the
Orangemen, giviing Syracuse a
5-3 halftime lead. Any momen-
tum W&L had seemed to be
disappearing. But both defenses
looked very tough at this point.

This sharp defense continued
for the first five minutes of the
second half. One lapse gave
Syracuse another goal at 11:49,
but Fritz answered with his se-
cond tally of the game (and
sixth of the season) to make it
6-4. From this point on, the
Generals never got any closer
than two. The Orangemen went
on to score three more goals to
give them a 9-4 lead at the end

such close matches. (comtinued on page 5)

Trackmen surprise Davidson
with 74-71 road victory

by Greg Branan

“We ran extremely well,”
were the words of track coach
Norris Aldridge in response to
last Saturday’s dual meet vic-
tory over Davidson College.

The final score was close with
W&L edging Davidson 74-71.
Last year Davidson beat the
Generals by one point. Coach
Aldridge’s prediction of a close
meet was proved as W&L led by
only five points with two events
left, the mile relay and triple
jump. The Generals’ Norvell
Scott took third in the triple
jump while the relay team of
Billy Morris, Dave Cordell,
Stewart Atkinson, and Jack
Norberg won the mile relay.

“Basically, it was just a good
team effort,” added Aldridge.

Top performances included
surprise first and second places

in the 1500 meters by Rich Bird
and Chris Daniel. Daniel
returned to take first in the 800
meters. The Generals swept the
400 meter race with Billy Mor-
ris, Jim Parker, and Dave Cor-
dell, respectively. W&L took
first and second in the pole
vault with Baker Spring and
Bob Campbell taking the
honors.

In other field events Buz Man-
ning was a surprising first in
the discus with a throw of over
130 feet. Also, in his first meet
throwing the javelin, Randy
Austin took second with a throw
of over 162 feet. Scott Swope
placed third in the javelin. Phil
Dunlay placed third in the shot
put. Norvell Scott placed second
in the long jump, while Paul
Hendry placed third in the high
jump.

In other running events the

440 yard relay team of Jeff
Brown, Chris Leiser, Atkinson
and Norberg won. Norberg also
placed first in the 100 meter
dash and first in the 200 meters.
Atkinson took third in the 200.
Russ Rector placed third in the
110 high hurdles, second in the
400 intermediate hurdles and
second in the high jump. Jim
Vines placed third in the 400
meter intermediate hurdles.

Coach Aldridge added that
“improvements are starting in
the throwing and distance race
events.”

This Friday the Generals
travel to Emory and Henry for
a meet that afternoon. In look-
ing ahead, Coach Aldridge said,
“It’s going to be another close
meet. They’re strong in the field
events, have one good sprinter
and a 440 man. They’re loaded
in almost every event.”

of the third quarter. The ninth
goal came with only four
seconds left.

_It took three minutes for
Syracuse to get one more goal,
their last of the day. Jay Foster
responded at 8:21 for the

Generals win

(continued from page 4)

Jerry Broccoli recovered a
crucial ground ball and was
slashed with only 0:17 left, giv-
ing the Generals possession and
a man-up situation. Coach Em-
mer was content to just let the
clock run down, as the penalty
would carry over into overtime.

Fritz, Kemp, Foster and
Pressler passed the ball around
the perimeter of the defense
trying to work a shot as the first
sudden-death overtime period
began. But Foster was later
pushed into the crease; before
he could jump back out the
referee had blown his whistle
and the bail belonged to OW at
3:40. Both teams were now at
full strength.

With about 2:00 left, Broccoli
knocked the ball loose from a
Bishop attackman and W&L
recovered in their own half of
the field. After a successful
clear at 1:48, the Generals
began working the ball again. at
1:04 Black squeaked a pass into
Foster who was waiting in the
crease to fire it home, giving
W&L the 8-7 victory.

Ohio Wesleyan outshot W&L,
46-40, and also recovered 65
groundballs to the Generals’ 55.
It seemed that the ball was
loose for most of the day. W&L
capitalized on 2 of 9 man-up
situations, and turned away
both attempts by the Bishops.
The Generals failed 15 of 38
clearing attempts, while OW
failed only 12 of 32. This victory
brings the Generals up to 3-1 on
the season. :

Clements, save for his early
mistake, looked good. He stop-
ped 16 of the Bishops’ 46 shots.
Both goalies can be credited
with keeping the score as low as
it was.

George Santos also looked
good as he dazzled a few of his
opponents with some excellent
stickwork and moves.

Foster was injured for the
Generals and will not see action
against North Carolina on
Saturday. He reinjured one
ankle and sprained the other.

to Syracuse

Generals, assisted by Geoff
Brent’ making it 10-5. Black
then hit again to net his second
of the day. 10-6, Syracuse. As
the fans were filing out, John
Kemp took a Mike Pressler
pass and drilled it home to com-
plete the day’s scoring at 10-7.

_ But it could have been a lot
different.

Six times the Generals miss-
ed goals by hitting the pipe.
Another key factor was that
W&L was penalized 7 times for
5:30, while Syracuse was only
called twice for 1:30. Although
the Generals can _ pride
themselves on turning away all
7 man-down attempts, this is at
least 5% minutes which couldn’t
be spent trying to score. It is
tough to do a good job with an
offense if your backs are con-
stantly against the wall!

Most of the statistics were
pretty grim. Besides losing all
four faceoffs, the Generals were
outshot 44-29 and beat on ground
balls, 39-27.

The worst stat was the clears.
W&L failed 11 of 30 attempts,
while Syracuse was successful
in 27 of their 31 tries. This was
due mainly to some very un-
characteristic sloppy passing,
and pressure from the
Orangemen.

W&L goalie Bob Clements
was simply shelled. He did
manage to save 22 of the 32
shots that were on goal, and at
least 10 of these saves were
point-black, with 7 coming in
the fourth quarter. Clements
clearly kept the Generals in the
game.

The Generals defense, so
often gone unnoticed, did a very
good job on the whole. Both
Steven Johnson and Jim
Herbert had fine days, but ran
into trouble each time they gave
their man an inch. The
Orangemen came in swarms
and took advantage of each inch
that the Generals gave them.
Syracuse did score 10 goals, but
most of the game they were
forced to keep their passes out
on the permimeter and out by
the restraining line.

WE&L ninth in poll

The Washington and Lee
Generals were ranked ninth in
the nation according to

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Apathy in retreat?

Last Monday, the E.C. room was jammed with people. Every
inch of space was taken, as people spilled into the hallway and
voices strained to be heard above the crowd. Was it another ‘‘Spin-
ners controversy,’’ the rock vs. soul battle that raged here three
years ago? Hardly...For the first time in recent memory, students
of all classes turned out in force to announce their candidacy for
class office. Seventy-three in all, their interest and enthusiasm
should make next week’s elections among the most exciting ever
seen at W&L. Our best wishes to all the candidates — it seems stu-
dent interest wasn’t dead, but merely dozing. -

And speaking of interest, participation in the Dance Marathon
has jumped in the past week. Some students have reported several
hundred dollars in pledges individually, so the first year goal of
$5,000 is certainly within sight. Even so, we strongly urge all non-
dancers to attend the event — including faculty and staff. For a
mere $5, those 30 hours of entertainment can’t be beat.

The committee in charge of the Marathon has worked long hours
since September on this project. But their success is totally depen-
dent on the community. So make this cause good! — the effort
necessary is small...

Wisdom from Tinker Mountain

I call your attention to the editorial at the right, which appeared
in a recent issue of Hollins Columns. While Ms. Mahlum certainly
deserves applause for her concern, I believe there are some fun-
damental misconceptions in her article which should be cleared up.

Above all, though I’ve never gotten a definite quote on the sub-
ject, I feel reasonably certain that President Huntley has never
stayed up nights (a la Dean Wormer), plotting the destruction of
the fraternity system. Neither does he indulge in cheap threats. Ms.
Mahlum accuses him of refusing to believe in the self-government
of fraternities. Yet that is the precise reason why he has not attend-
ed IFC meetings in past years. Not “‘lack of interest’’ but trust is
the factor here. I might also suggest that — even though the Hollins
president may have no more pressing affairs to handle than student
social problems — it would frighten me a little to think that our
president had that much time on his hands. In addition, Ms.
Mahlum should remember that most colleges have deans
(remember them?) to deal with everyday student life.

Also, the point should be made that the fraternity system is not in
reed of improvement, strictly speaking. As it appears on paper, in
the IFC rules, the system is just fine. But fraternities are not carry-
ing out all these necessary requirements. ‘Financial management,
social conduct, and house upkeep”’ are not “‘improvements”’ — they
ure expected.

Finally, I ask that Ms. Mahlum remember that fraternities —
though an important part of campus life — are not official universi-
ty organizations. Only when they begin to affect the campus direct-
ly and in an adverse way is the administration justified in taking
direct action. Comparing our social clubs to the dorms at Hollins is
both unfair and ludicrous. Let me assure all critics that W&L
students continue to govern themselves in campus affairs to the
same degree as Hollins students.

Fraternity members — read Ms. Mahlum’s editorial closely.
Some of her arguments may be misplaced, but her general tone in-

dicates a genuine concern that only you can help to bring to an vod

Hollins Columns editor comments
on Huntley’s message to fraternities

The following is an editorial
from the March 12 issue of Hollins
Columns.

Since fraternity social life af-
fects many members of the Col-
lege, it seems appropriate to
consider both what Washington
and Lee President Robert E.R.
Huntley said and, indeed, what
he did not say in his recent ad-
dress to the W&L Interfraterni-
ty Council.

Huntley described frater-
nities at W&L as, ‘‘the core of
social life’ for students there,
but added ‘‘not as a threat’”’ and
“time is about to run out on the
fraternity system, and for a cer-
tain few fraternities in par-
ticular.’ Why does he offer such
a sweeping statement, ‘‘as a
prediction’? Has he ventured to
think beyond threats and in-
stead wants to see the end of the
fraternity system? Perhaps
since it was not a threat, he did
not want to address the question
of what the W&L administration
will do to get rid of the fraterni-
ty system. However, Huntley
did not offer any suggestions on
how the fraternity system could
be improved. He offered ideas
on where improvements need to
be made, ‘‘financial manage-
ment, social conduct, and struc-
tural or house upkeep,”’ but no
ways which he thought these
areas could be improved.

Huntley asked, ‘‘Do you think
fraternities have the capability
for self-government?’ One
must wonder if he believes they
do. He also placed no blame for
the “overall deterioration of
fraternities” on the University,
yet he stated that it has been
“seven or eight years since I
last met with this group” (the
W&L IFC). His lack of interest
in the IFC seems to be a strong
indicator that some blame
should be placed on the Univer-
sity for the ‘‘deterioration of the
fraternities.”’

 

Huntley’s attitude in general
seems a bit amazing. He
describes the ‘‘youthful ex-
uberance” of fraternities and
later alludes to the time at W&L
as the “transition between
boyhood and manhood’’ in
stressing the importance of
fraternity life. I find it hard to
visualize ‘‘youthful ex-
uberance” and manhood in the
same light. How does he see
these males, as men or boys?

In addition to the interest of
W&L and its problems, it is in-
teresting to look at our own Col-
lege in comparison. Although
there are no sororities at the
College, indeed they were
abolished by students in 1929, a
comparison about how students
are considered in self govern-
ment can be made.

I find that we are taken
seriously here in our social and
dorm life. Students govern and
continue to govern in the Com-
munity Trust System at the Col-
lege. By being wholly student
run in these areas, we are
trusted to make fair and
“adult”’ decisions concerning
our peers, Students are offered
and take the responsibility for
each other. The administration
does not wait seven or eight
years before voicing concern
about student conduct, this of-
fers open communication bet-
ween student and administra-
tion members. No one is hiding
behind a tree, fearing the
resolution of a problem.

(Reprinted with permission from the Lexington News-Gazette,

March 14, 1979)

Housing is again coming to the fore as a need that is not being

adequately met in this area.

All three of the rent-subsidized housing developments in the Lex-
ington area are reported to have waiting lists. The developer of one
of these complexes is considering additional units. But no such con-
sideration by the other groups has surfaced.

Meanwhile, only one of the three area governing bodies,
Rockbridge County, has elected to participate in the federal-state
rental assistance program which aids low income families in
upgrading the level of their housing.

The housing problem: involves the university, as the student
newspaper, the Ring-tum Phi, recently documented in.a special

housing section.

With relatively little on-campus housing available for upper
classmen, students are increasingly vying with local families for
housing. The rooms in private houses, which once provided ac-
commodations for many students, are found to be inadequate for

today’s lifestyles.

The community’s leaders need to again turn increased attention

to the housing situation.

Housing Booklet
In The Making

Sophomore student Executive
Committee representative Bob
Willis is completing work on a
student housing booklet.

Willis, who has been involved
in student housing problems
since the time that the Ring-
tum Phi began its investigation
of the situation, says his booklet
will be printed by the Universi-
ty this summer and will be
distributed to students next fall.

The booklet itself will be an
expanded version of the
newspaper’s Student Housing
Supplement. ‘‘After the Ring-
tum Phi’s housing issue, the
University has made definite
steps toward providing an off-
campus housing service,”’
Willis said.

He has spoken with both
James W. Whitehead, Universi-
ty treasurer, and William N.
Mohler, director of University
Services, about student  off-
campus housing problems and
said that Mohler now has a

bulletin board in his office for
housing information.

Willis is also hopeful about
starting a file of private apart-
ments and houses which are
usually occupied by students.
He encourages students now liv-
ing in off-campus housing to
leave their names and
telephone numbers in Carole
Chappell’s office in the Univer-
sity Center so that work can
begin on the file.

power of initiative.

“Proposition 13. means the
people want to get their hands
around the necks of the politi-
cians who have been ruining
this country,’’ Rusher said.

McCarthy, on the other hand,
blamed most of the United
States’ domestic troubles on
‘our banks, financial institu-
tions’ and corporations.”

He concentrated most of his
attack on the automobile and
advertising industries.

“When you buy a Chrysler,
you are paying them back about
$200 for telling you to buy the
car in the first place,’’ McCar-
thy said. He accused the
automobile industry of

“‘wasting”’ $100 million a year.

McCarthy also said that ‘‘the
American economy is not going
to absorb the unemployed’ in
the U.S. and recommended a
“redistribution”’ of the existing
work.

“If we just distributed the
overtime work, we could
employ another one million peo-
ple,” he said.

During the question and
answer period following the for-
mal debate, Rusher endorsed
former California Gov. Ronald
Reagon as the Republican par-
ty’s presidential candidate for
1980. He said that former Texas
Gov. John Connolly’s chances
at the presidency are “‘pretty
good.”’

was “inherent’’ that Sem
cheerleaders would be abused.

Dudley said that it could be
possible that the EC would pro-
vide funding or partial funding
for the cheerleaders, looking at
the project as if it were a club.

Miller and an EC subcom-
mittee will look into the
possibility of having
cheerleaders next year.

EC members were in agree-
ment that they should be the
talent judges for the
cheerleaders.

Beach. His sheer ability carried
him thought the overall weak
material on Works, Volume 2,
but even that’s not enough to cut
it on the new record.

The list of flaws in this LP
could go on forever. The pro-
duction is muddled and confus-
ed, the title sounds like a Beach
Boys record (& the cover looks
like one), the vinyl...well, you

get the picture. The only en-
couraging note in the Emerson,
Lake & Palmer story at this
point is the report that they'll be
breaking up following a final
tour this summer. That’s good
news, for there are two very
talented musicians (and one
hack) who could clearly profit
from some fresh associations.

It’s too bad in a way, though.
This was a great band.

Kammerer makes Bela just
what he should be — one of us
there on stage. Particularly
telling is the scene where he
repeatedly enters the outer
room behind Ilona’s box at the
opera. Kammerer’s Bela is the
spirit of the audience.

a job well done. Mother is
“mother” to Ilona, though not
biologically. The connection is
somewhat less than clear —
mother is some sort of live-in
friend of the family who does do
windows. The fact is_ that
McNeese plays a woman who
(like so many others) is herself
playing a role. Indicative of
MecNeese’s intelligent, witty
performance is the fact that
even while she’s practically off
stage and certainly not speak-
ing in Act II, she (McNeese)
continues to act. Sitting in the
box, she really does watch the

opera. ;
The three domestics all do

‘their jobs. Rob Davis and Laura

Tilley are proficient and some
of Shirley Hughes’ facial ex-
pressions are priceless,

Lee Kahn deserves baskets
full of good words for his direc-
tion. In this play, timing,
nuance and ambiance are ter-
ribly important. Without a firm
directional hand — this fine
script could easily slip away.

In Kahn’s production, I find
that each line that I would have
underlined while reading the
play is meaninfully accen-
tuated. All the levels of plot and
tone are supported by a superb
sense of what’s going on.

In this manner the wildly
comic and profoundly serious
are allowed to co-exist in the
play (as they do in life).

Finally, The Guardsman
doesn’t give us an answer.
Because of Kahn’s masterful
direction, we don’t ask it to. In
Molnar’s Budapest, tissued
with lies told by women, peopl-
ed by actors — the one certainty
is that there is no certainty. And
we have been. prepared to ac-
cept that.

The Guardsman is a
coherent, unified expression of
the disjointed world around us.
All aspects of the play — the
music, the settings, the acting
— all work to this end. The
Guardsman is an unqualified
four-star credit to all involved.
