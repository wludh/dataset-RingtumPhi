Warner Wins Election

Republican John Warner
defeated Democrat Andrew
Miller by 3,268 votes in Tues-
day’s election for Virginia’s
Senate seat in one of the closest
elections in the state’s history.

Warner's winning margin
was by just over two-tenths of
one percent of the total vote ina
race that was ‘‘too close to call”
for most of the evening and was
not decided until all of the
state’s 1,861 precincts had
reported in by 12:30 a.m.

Warner polled 611,725 votes
state-wide, or 50.13 percent of
the votes cast. Miller received
608,457 votes, or 49.87 percent.

The vote was tabulated by the
News Election Service (the two
wire services and the three na-
tional networks) and is not of-
ficial.

As of publication, Miller had
not yet conceded the election or
called for a recount.

Under Virginia law, the
Democratic candidate can ask
for an official audit of the elec-
tion because the vote difference
was one percent or less.

Mass confusion seemed to sur-
round the top floor of Reid Hall
Tuesday night. ‘

The reason for the apparent
madness was, of course, the
election and its coverage by
Cable Nine TV and WLUR-FM,
Washington and Lee’s student
operated television and radio
stations.

Throughout the building
phones rang, AP machines
clicked, information was taken,
computed, typed or scribbled,
and sent off with runners who
sprinted to the studio. For-
tunately, no one was hurt in the
crowded halls that resembled
Zollman’s during a grain party.

Although the event seemed
confusing and disorganized, it
was really prepared and ran
quite effectively under election
night pressure.

Several people copied and
computed returns for
redistribution while tapes of
conversations and results were
made in a studio. Returns were
posted and recordings played to

up to date on the local and na-
tional election results.

Charlie Smith, who was in
charge of the coverage, looked
disheveled but seemed pleased
as the night wore on. Smith
noted that information did not
always come in fast enough and
said, ‘‘nothing is more difficult
than speaking into a camera
with no information in front of
you.”

Smith did a good job of cover-
ing up the few dry spells in

returns that occurred
periodically throughout the
night.

Information was not only col-
lected from the wire services,
but reporters from Richmond
and other election headquarters
called in with returns.

Cable Nine reporters remain-
ed in constant contact with
television station WDBJ and
radio stations in Roanoke, Rad-
ford, and Charlottesville.

sources to provide viewers with

Law Students Advance to Finals

Three law students from
Washington and Lee University
have advanced to the national
finals in this year’s moot court
(simulated courtroom) debate
competitions as a result of their
first-place finish in regional
competition last weekend, Oct.
27-29.

The three — Jacquelyn K.
Boyden of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
Jerrauld C. Jones of Norfolk,
Va., and James P.
Midland, Mich., all second-year

Osick of

law students — will compete in
the national meet Jan. 29-31 in
New York City.

Eighteen teams from law
schools in Virginia, West
Virginia, Kentucky and North
Carolina competed in_ last
week’s regional competition,
which took place at the Univer-
sity of Richmond’s T. C.
Williams School of Law.

Ms. Boyden, the W&L team

captain, was named best oral
advocate in the regional meet.

This year, the national moot
court competition will focus on
a hypothetical Federal Trade
Commission rule banning
televised advertising of sugar-
coated cereals to children.

Ms. Boyden is a graduate of
the University of Michigan in
Ann Arbor, with a degree in
English literature. Jones is a
sociology graduate of Princeton
University, Osick received his
undergraduate degree in
history from Pennsylvania
State University.

Four Fraternities

Fail Inspections

by David Greer

Four fraternities were placed
on social probation for failing to
meet house maintenance re-
quirements, Interfraternity
Council president Jim Davis
said yesterday.

Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Beta Theta Pi were
placed on two weeks social pro-
bation. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
was placed on one week social
probation.

Each fraternity was given a
checklist to determine the con-
dition of the chapter house and
note necessary repairs on the
structure.

Each fraternity had to meet
the requirements on _ the
checklist and turn it in. Last
week, members of the Fraterni-
ty Inspection Committee in-
spected the houses to see_if they
had conformed to the list.

The four fraternities failing to
meet the standards on the

checklists were referred to the
Student Affairs Committee,
who decided the punishments.

According to Assistant Dean
of Students Dan Murphy, the
fraternities placed on social
probation had misrepresented
themselves on the lists.

The Fraternity Inspection
Committee is a six-member
body made up of students,
faculty, and administrators.
This is the first inspection the
committee has made this year;
one inspection was made last
spring. The inspections were
announced.

Fraternities on social proba-
tion are not allowed to have par-
ties or female guests in the
chapter house. No more than
five members of a fraternity on
probation can be seen together,
except during normal functions
at the house (such as meals or
meetings).

E.G, Gives. $100 to
Independents’ Union

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
gave the recently formed
Washington and Lee _ In-
dependents’ Union $100 at Mon-
day night’s E.C. meeting.

John Schmidt, organizer of
the group, had asked the E.C.
for a $100 loan to pay for ‘‘office
expenses” and “‘publicity’’ to
stir interest in the new
organization.

The Independents’ Union will
attempt to coordinate in-

tramural sports and social ac-
tivities for non-fraternity
students at W&L. .

Schmidt said that he had
‘about 50” students interested
in the Union, and he has weekly
meetings already planned.

The E.C. was unanimous in
granting the Independents’
Union $100 ‘‘to start out.”

In other. action, the E.C.
decided to hold a mandatory
meeting for the freshman class

Pres. Huntley Speaks to Parents

in Defense of a Liberal Arts E

On Saturday, November 4, W&L President
Robert E.R. Huntley delivered a series of
remarks to several hundred parents and
students entitled In Defense of Liberal Arts

Education.

The enthusiastically received address was also
delivered, in somewhat larger form, to the
Robert E. Lee Associates in New York City one

week before.

Huntley, having completed his first decade in
the office of university president, is well known
as a proponent of the “‘liberally educated mind.”
The Ring-tum Phi is grateful for the opportunity
to review some of his remarks.

The word ‘‘liberal”’ is used in
so many contexts with so many
differing connotations that we
may forget that its primary
meaning has to do with
freedom: liberty and liberation.
A liberal education is an educa-
tion designed to liberate the
mind, to free it from ignorance
and from the animal emotions
and instincts which may con-
strict and dominate it, and to
free it from the aimless and
useless thrashings-about to
which the untutored intellect is
prone.

A liberal education is intend-
ed to cause the mind to become
as useful as it is capable of be-
ing. In this sense, the purpose of
a liberal education is the most
utilitarian of all.

Let me mention a few of my
ideas about the way in which a
liberal arts college like
Washington and Lee attempts
— or should attempt — to pro-
vide its students the foundation
of a liberal education, to help its
students develop useful minds.

The curriculum should _in-
clude courses in all or nearly all
the subjects which time has pro-
ven to be fit for disciplined and
orderly inquiry and which

reveal and explore important
segments of mankind’s ac-
cumulated experience. It’s easy
to discern certain subjects
which must be included —
history and literature, for ex-
ample. Others come quickly to
mind; the natural sciences,
philosophy, religion,
economics, for example.

All these subjects, and some
others, readily meet the two
basic criteria I suggested
earlier. Each is a fit subject for
orderly and disciplined inquiry.
Each encompasses a massive
accumulation of thought and
knowledge and wisdom of
mankind over an _ extended
time. Each has been the subject
of orderly and disciplined ex-
ploration by the best minds of
the past. Thus, each can be

taught and learned in a
manageable way.
The courses, properly

selected and properly taught,
must be imbedded in a cur-
ricular structure which is well
ordered and purposeful. A ran-
dom array will not do. The
undergraduate student must be
guided into this curriculum in a
way which will cause him to
achieve two immediate objec-

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

tives. First, he must have a
significant learning experience
in each of the several kinds of
subjects which make up a

liberal arts curriculum —
humanities, natural sciences,
languages, social sciences.
Furthermore, the student is
required to achieve approx-
imate mastery of at least one
liberal arts subject. He may

The ideal of the liberal arts
tradition is not easily attained,
even by those institutions such
as Washington and Lee which
strive purposefully to attain it.
At best, there must be com-
promises and experiments
which changing times seem to
require. But if the ideal is kept
intact, and clearly agreed upon
by those at the college, the way

preparation. And with prepara-
tion as our objective, it is more
likely that we practical
American will want to know:
Preparation for what? — for
what specific tasks?

Thus, for example, it is com-
monly assumed that one who
spends much time in college on,
say, history or English must be
preparing himself to teach
those subjects. Others — that is,
those who don’t plan to teach
them — must defend the ap-
parent impracticality of their
serious study of the humanities.

Education has been confused
with training. A bird dog needs
training, and if he is to be a good
bird dog, he must have training.
A human being needs educa-
tion, and if he is to be a good
human being, he must have
education. Human beings may
also be trained — whether or
not they are educated. But for
an important task, any in-
telligent employer except a
despot will always choose an

 

“For an important task, any intelligent employers except
a despot will always choose an untrained well-educated

person over an uneducated well-trained one. For human

beings, training is important; education is vital.”

‘or physics, or English, for ex-

ample.

Note that this process, the
liberal arts process, is not the
same as what is sometimes call-
ed ‘‘general  education.’’
‘General education,” if I
understand that term, seeks to
tell the student a little bit about
a lot of things — to produce a

well-informed and presumably |
well-adjusted human being. A -

liberal arts education
postulates that the student
should have the real experience
of learning and thinking in each
of several arenas of knowledge
where the greatest minds of the
past have plowed fertile ground
— and that in one of them he
should become, as nearly as he
can, an expert. Its purpose is
not to produce well-informed
graduates, though it may in-
cidentally do that. Its purpose is
to produce well-educated
graduates, who can quickly
become well informed in almost
any field, and who can apply a
tough and discriminating in-
tellect to the information they
obtain.

can be found to achieve for a
preponderance of the graduates
the foundations of a_ useful
mind.

But make no mistake. The
liberal arts educational pro-
cess, and the liberal educa-
tional ideal, are under attack in
a number of ways, both prac-
tical and philosophical.

I am encouraged to some
degree by the increasing
number of speeches and ar-
ticles defending the liberal arts
tradition in education. I am
distressed that there is a need
for a defense. (Someone once
said that a person who must ask
the purpose of a liberal educa-
tion would be incapable of
understanding the answer. )

In part, the need for such a
defense grows out of the univer-
sality of educational opportuni-
ty, which to our credit we as a
nation have come very close to
achieving. But in our quest for
universality we may have tacit-
ly redefined education to mean

untrained well-educated person
over an uneducated well-
trained one. For human beings,
training is important; educa-
tion is vital.

Professional medical educa-
tion has, in my opinion, become
in recent years a prime exam-
ple of destructive pressure on
the liberal arts and on liberal
education. Medical educators
frequently state their belief in
the need for liberally educated
physicans, but the actions of
their schools often belie their
words.

No one expects that medical
schools will be able to provide
their students with a liberal
education. They are primarily
complex — and effective —
training institutions. If the
medical student or the physi-
cian is to become an educated
person, the foundations for that
prospect will almost certainly
have to come from his college
years. Probably few wound

Boiler Room becomes

"A Doll’s House”

by R.B. Ramirez
“There are people one loves,
and others one likes to talk to.”

When one confuses these two -

types of people, it leads to many
difficulties.

These difficulties, and others,
will be explored in Ibsen’s A
Doll’s House, opening next
week in the Boiler Room
Theatre. Al Gordon, the direc-
tor, has promised to produce
the show in all its original Vic-
torian splendor, but in spite of
this all, it will be difficult to im-
agine it as anything but a very
modern play.

It’s hard to think of it as
anything else, though it will see
its 100th birthday next year. It
was, of course, a scandal in its
own time. In Germany, for in-
stance, the script had to be
modified before the show could
go onstage: In Norway this
woman might be able to get
away with such impiety as
walking out on her husband and
children, but let’s not let it be
said that it could happen in Ger-
many!

In our town time, we’ve seen
many stage productions, some
of note, others not, and just in
the last few years there were
two film versions. Doll’s House
has been more or less seized
upon as an _ expression of
feminist sympathy, sort of an
archetypal Joanie Caucus, I
guess, to mention Garry
Trudeau’s affectionate _ por-
trayal of all that’s right with
feminism. Well, I’m as much a
Doonesbury fan as say, Bill
Buckley, but that won't
dissuade me from warning
against the trap of interpreting
art out of chronological con-
text: Ms. Caucus isn’t Nora,
and Ibsen isn’t preaching at us;
all he does really, is present a
difficult problem, very nicely
wrought, for us to argue out
among (or else by) ourselves on
the way home from the theatre.

It’s no accident that the play
ends, rather than begins, in
media res. No, here the issue of
sexual confrontation is not
nearly so important as_ the
dramatic opportunity it pro-
vides. This play is, as Gordon
likes to point out, a happy

drama: a woman leaves much
behind her, and sets out to settle
for herself all the questions
she’s never allowed herself to

modern play, it is thanks to
themes far subtler than that of

principal images of the play are
those of debt and the mas-
querade. Torvald regularly
thunders against debt, not
knowing that the spendthrift
Nora is concealing a loan from
him. Nora is all to ready to con-
sume today and to let her liabili-
ty wait until later. Torvald
hypocritically condemns debt,
but fails to see the debt which he
is bearing: years of blindness
and stupid insensitivity have
accumulated till Nora breaks

Musical Mainstieam

by Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

It’s probably happened to
most rock’n roll fans at one
time or another. You begin
listening toa band when it’s still
virtually unknown. You stand
silent while your friends laugh
when you tell them how good
the group is, and finally watch
almost in disbelief as your band
actually MAKES IT BIG.

That’s how it is with me and
Styx. I wasn’t a fan of theirs
from the very beginning; sur-
prisingly, they’ve been around
in one form or another since
1964, when I was all of six years
old. Dennis De Young joined up
with twin brothers John and
Chuck Panozzo, initially going
under the name of TW4. By
1978, they had added guitarists
John Curulewski and James
Young and began playing local
high schools and colleges as The
Tradewinds.

Finally, in 1970, the band
landed a recording contract
with RCA subsidiary Wooden
Nickel Records and decided to
go under the name Styx. Says
guitarist Young, “It was the on-
ly one none of us hated.”

Even the most loyal Styx fan
would have to admit that the
group’s Wooden Nickel releases
were for the most part dreadful
— poorly conceived and
miserably produced. The one
exception was Styx II, released
in 1972. The single taken from
that particular record, ‘‘Lady,”’
went nowhere at the time.

Something very odd began to
happen, though. People started
calling radio stations after see-

ing Styx in concert (at this point
the band was playing almost ex-
clusively in the Chicago area)
and requesting ‘“‘Lady.”’ This
went on for an incredible 18
months, and Styx finally got
that mythical ‘“‘big break’’ you
always read about.

Dennis De Young tells the
story. “We went to see the
music director of WLS to help
push our new album, Man of
Miracles there was no thought
of ‘Lady’ whatsoever. In the
middle of our conversation he
asked, ‘Oh, by the way, what
would you say if I told you I was
putting Lady on our playlist?.’’
We took it very calmly — danc-
ed a jig on his desk and dove in-
to the water cooler.”’

‘‘Lady” subsequently became
a hit nationwide, of course, but
inability to capitalize on ;that
success caused Styx to change
labels, from from Woeden
Nickel to A&M. They released

and the receptions which follow

The Swedish Bergman, who is
perhaps the most highly regard-
ed director working in film to-
day, helped to inaugurate in the
late 50’s and early 60’s the
“French New Wave,” a move-
ment whose assumptions
dominate the _ international
movie scene even now. The New
Wave, which corresponds con-
ceptually to the ‘‘modern”’
period in literature and pain-
ting, is characterized by ex-
treme aesthetic self-
consciousness and the posing of
challenges to accepted ideas
about morality, reality, and ar-
tistic coherence.

The cornerstone of New Wave
film-making as Bergman
helped to create it is the
“auteur theory,’’ which posits
the director as the true ‘‘star”’
of the film: it is his creative
energy which makes a movie
worth seeing, in the same way
that it is an author’s artistry
which makes a novel worth
reading. Formerly, viewers
went to a movie in order to see a
particular actor or actress,
rather than to follow the career
of a particular artist-director.

Bergman’s early films, like
The Seventh Seal (1956), con-
cern an agonized metaphysical
search for meaning in life.
Beginning notably with Persona
(1966), Bergman concerned
himself more and more with the
actual business of living. Cries
and Whispers, which belongs to
this second group of films, is a
psychological study of three
sisters: Agnes, who is dying of
cancer; Karin, whose self-
control erupts mid-film in sex-
ual violence; and Maria, who
evades emotion through super-
ficiality and frivolous pleasure.
The Maria character is played
by Liv Ullmann. The stunning
reds of the movie’s setting ex-
ternalize the emotional tur-
bulence which the sisters very
largely repress. Ina frightening
scene at the end of Cries and
Whispers, the corpse-like Agnes
holds the living Maria in an em-
brace which represents with
awesome metaphoric power
Bergman’s preoccupation with
the-intrusion of the past into the
present, the difficulty, for the
living, of escaping the
stranglehold of old memories
and people now dead.

by Bill Whalen

The final score of last Satur-
day’s game _ says that
Washington and Lee lost in
what might have appeared as a
well fought match. Anyone,
however, who saw W&L play
Emory & Henry knows that the
Generals lost in an extremely
disappointing way. The
Generals, who had built a 17-0
lead, managed to play poorly
enough in the second half to lose
18-17.

“It certainly was a very
disappointing game,” said
Coach Gary Fallon, ‘‘but when
you have a young team and a
new coaching staff, this can
happen. We had the momentum
and the lead but they blocked
one of our punts and we fumbled
on their four yard line another
time.”

The game was close and hard

than three and a half quarters.
Both touchdowns by SAE came
in the last minutes of the fourth
quarter on passes from quarter-

by Tim Connors

Last week the Washington
and Lee soccer Generals closed
out their season by upsetting
Virginia Wesleyan College 2-1,
and losing a_ disappointing
game to Virginia Military In-
stitute, 3-0, in the “Battle of
Lexington.”

Virginia Wesleyan, the Dixie

Conference champions, entered
the game with an 11-3 record
and needing to defeat the
Generals and Lynchburg Col-
lege in order to get an NCAA
tournament bid. W&L saw to it
that Lynchburg wound up
without the bid, however, as
first half goals by Bryan

Williams and Bill Brown sealed

small size of the audience will
surely effect an increase in the

delicate nuances of expression

which drama needs. It is hoped,
furthermore, that this improve-
ment will come at the expense
of the uncomfortable
“theatricality” demanded by
the design and distance of the
standard proscenium stage.

and exchange student from
Sweet Briar College, will play

Freshman defender Dave Mc-
Collum and sophomore
defender Homer Bliss turned in
outstanding efforts in aiding
sophomore goalie Kevin Carney
to record the victory. Coach
Rolf Piranian was especially
pleased with the way in which
the Generals ‘‘totally
dominated’’ the Marlins,
yielding a mere six shots on
goal while taking twenty-three.

Piranian did not have as
much praise for his charges
after the game at VMI,
however’ as he said that the
Generals ‘‘did not play very
well: VMI dominated the game
throughout.’ He went on to say
that ‘“‘a few defensive errors’’
committed by W&L early in the
first half proved costly. Pira-
nian did have praise for
freshman goalie John Guest,
however, saying he Made
“some beautiful saves, once
stopping a penalty-kick, and
another on a very tough shot.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

ound two:

Calendar problems

By this week, the idea of separate graduation
ceremonies for the law students and the
undergraduates in 1979 has become an accepted fact.
Although no specific date has been set for the Lewis
Hall ceremony, the event will surely precede the June
7 graduation by several days — in order to free the
law graduates for those all-important job offers and
bar review classes. So, with the disputes of the cur-
rent year behind them, the University Council and the
faculty turned this week to a consideration of next
year’s calendar.

Unfortunately, a solution that would both restore
the ‘‘unified graduation” and free the law students
from unnecessary inconvenience remained elusive.
The U.C. debated the matter at some length last
Thursday, and emerged with an alternate
undergraduate calendar that would have made
graduation earlier in 1980. But heavy sacrifices from
the undergraduates were necessary for this — in-
cluding a shortened Christmas vacation and the
transformation of the Washington Holiday into a ‘4
day weekend.”’

Students on this side of Woods Creek may be glad to
know that the U.C.’s ‘‘alternative’’ was rejected by
the faculty last Monday. Instead, the more com-
monplace calendar (drawn up by the faculty E.C.)
was approved. Now all the holidays will retain their
usual length, but graduation will again be late: June
5, 1980.

To make a long story short, it seems we’re once

more ‘“‘between a rock and a hard place.”’ The approv-
ed date of June 5 will again fall after the bar review
classes begin for law graduates. Also, all the other
arguments used this year by the law students for an
early graduation will continue to hold weight. And
although no university official has come right out and
said so, it seems logical to assume that the law and
undergraduate commencement exercises will con-
tinue to be separate in future years.

I still believe that this is an unfortunate situation.
Certainly, there are no villains here; the faculty, in
their concern for the undergraduate calendar and
holidays, clearly chose the lesser of two evils last
Monday. But the growing isolation of the law students
from the student body-at-large remains a serious pro-
blem. Now that the ‘‘graduation battle” has reached a
dead end, one can only hope that other means will be
found to preserve that all-important sense of com-
munity between Lewis Hall and the rest of the cam-
pus.

LETTER TO
THE EDITOR

To the editor of the Ring-tum
Phi:

One’s sympathy for the poor
put-upon fraternities
diminishes spectacularly when
one drives past a fraternity
house and encounters broken
beer bottles in the roadway —
as happened to me last Thurs-
day night on Lee Avenue in
front of the Delt house.

Sincerely,
R.S. Keefe

Saturday. There will be no
cover charge in the Cockpit.

Next Wednesday, at 8, Burr
Datz, Lex Birney, and Ron
Spain will perform a varied
acoustic repertoire. Datz and
Birney will trade hot licks on
some blues numbers, and some
bluegrass numbers, and Spain
will add vocal harmonies and a
searing blues harp. This per-
formance will be free to the
general public.

Journalist
to speak

Harold S. Gulliver, editor of
the Atlanta Constitution, will
speak at Washington and Lee
University Monday, Nov. 13, on
the topic ‘‘Ethics and the Jour-
nalist.”’

The lecture will take place in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

The public is invited to the
lecture, which is sponsored by
Society and the Professions,
Washington and Lee’s program
in applied ethics.

Liberty Hall books listed

The first comprehensive
listing and evaluation of the
books contained in the library of
Liberty Hall Academy almost
200 years ago has been publish-
ed in the new issue of The
Virginia Magazine of History
and Biography, the quarterly
journal of the Virginia
Historical Society.

The article, ‘‘The Library of
Liberty Hall Academy,” is by
Betty Ruth Kondayan, head
reference and public-services
librarian at Washington and
Lee University.

Her research is based on a
recently discovered list of 101
titles in the 18th-century
library.

She notes that more than half

the books remain in the W&L
library’s rare book collections
today. The importance attached
to the library in official Liberty
Hall records indicates that the
early trustees ‘recognized
liberty and a library . . . as in-
separable,” she writes. The
titles themselves reflect ‘‘both
breadth of outlook and
tolerance,’’ she notes.

Huntley: Education is vital

(continued from page 2)
argue with this premise.

But the medical schools are
increasingly squeezing the
undergraduate college in the
direction of diluting seriously
the liberal educational- ex-
perience of the pre-medical stu-
dent. This squeeze apparently
results from the need to screen
the large numbers of applica-
tions for admission to medical
school, an understandable pro-
blem.

Many medical school admis-
sions officers appear to be solv-
ing their problem by laying
primary emphasis on the appli-
cant’s specific achievement in
advanced science courses. The
applicant who has A’s in such
science courses and B’s in, let’s
say, history, English, and
economics will be preferred to
the applicant whose A’s are in
the humanities and whose
science grades are good but not
superlative.

Pre-medical students learn
this simple lesson very quickly
and adjust their course selec-
tion and their study habits ac-
cordingly — to the detriment of
their total educational ex-
perience. And the college itself
must soon react to the pressure,
because if its pre-medical
students do not achieve admis-
sion to medical school the
reputation of the college suffers
in the market-place. It may
react by revising its curriculum
to staisfy the medical school ad-
missions pressure, revisions

which may run counter to the

educational ideals which I have
sketched.

You may ask: Why do the col-
leges permit this unwanted in-
trusion into their domain? The
answer, I am afraid, is not a
happy one. Partly, it is a lack of
conviction. Partly, it is lack of
concern.

It is also possible that many

of our large public institutions
—not all, but many — have long
since lost the battle to preserve
a liberal educational ideal. If
this be true, then the last line of
defense is the independent
liberal arts college, which is not
in a strong position to exert ef-
fective pressure on our educa-
tional system.

The public education system
faces its own problems. In re-
cent years we have all heard
much about the diminishing
college-age population. Most
private institutions — certainly
Washington and Lee — have
long since learned to live, and
indeed desire to live, with stu-
dent populations of stable size.

Most public instituions have
become accustomed to living on
what I would call ‘‘the margin
of growth’’ in the years since
World War II; in those years,
there have been rapid annual
increases in student
enrollments at nearly all public
institutions. At most such in-
Stitutions, increased operating
income is a direct and im-
mediate result of increased stu-

dent body size, but the addi-.

tional costs of enlarged size
tend to lag by several years.

Therefore, even if there are
no permanent unit economies of
scale to be derived from
largeness, there will be an ap-
parent financial health provid-
ed by the margin of growth. As
that growth diminishes or levels
off to zero, the pressure on the
public institution to find
students will become increas-
ingly insistent.

Also as the numbers diminish
and at the same time,
legislators and legislatures

become more and more restric-
tive about their willingness to
keep open the faucet of
unlimited public funds, public
institutions all over the country
are turning to private philan-
thropy. I don’t blame them for
that; I simply cite it as a fact.

I would point out one or two
salient economic points about
that observation. For the public
institution, private philan-
thropy is the icing on the cake.
For us, it is the cake.

There are other threats of this
practical variety. There is
however, one _ philosophical
threat that is perhaps of greater
concern.

I believe there is a growing
doubt among educators and
among the populace of
American about the value of the
kind of education I’ve attemp-
ted to describe. I am no longer
as certain as I would have been
twenty years ago, no longer as
certain as I would like to be,
that most persons in America
agree with my emphais on the
importance of liberal educa-
tion.

I suspect that this grows from
several factors. The increasing
demand for practicality, for im-
mediate applicability of
everything learned, is one.
Another, more disturbing, is the
increasing distrust of reason
and rationality. You can see it
all around you — the turn to the
occult, to the metaphysical; the
eschewing of reason as the
primary basis for human ex-
istence.

To these kinds of criticisms,
education should respond
positively and with conviction.
It is my impression that it has
not yet done so.

At Washington and Lee, I
believe I can speak for the
faculty, the students, and Board
of Trustees in assuring you that
it is our determined intention to
retain our educational ideal. We
will survive as at least one in-
stitution that believes in the
liberal education, #the value of

the human mind, and in the
aspirations of the human spirit.
With continued assistance, this
school, two hundred years from
now, will still represent the
traditions and the strengths
which it has represented for the
two hundred years that have
gone before.
