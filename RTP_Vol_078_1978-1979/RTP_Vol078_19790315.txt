NUMBER 20

 

Abraham, Cotter, Geary Are

Steve Abraham, Les
Cotter, and Cove Geary
were the winners in Mon-
day’s Big Three Elec-
tions for the student body
government offices of
president, vice president,
and secretary.

Abraham defeated write-in
candidate Chris Burnham for
the office of next year’s student

body president by a vote of 438
to 322.

Les Cotter, who ran without
opposition, won the office of
vice president with 586 votes.

Cove Geary, a write-in can-
didate, defeated law student
Kevin Ross 256-116 for the office
of secretary.

Winners In Big Three Election

Abraham collected most of
the undergraduate vote in the
race for the presidency. He poll-
ed 231 votes on the colonnade to
Burnham’s 111. Abraham also
won at the freshman quad
voting area, 174-95.

But Burnham found a source
of strength in the law school
where his campaign was tied to
Ross. Burnham collected 116
votes in the law school to
Abraham’s 33.

Both Ross and Geary found
their support on their respec-
tive sides of the bridge. Geary
found only nine votes in the law
school and Ross pulled in seven
votes on the undergraduate
campus. Z

Rents Increased At Hotel

 

by Joe Scott

Rents at the Robert E. Lee Hotel are going
up between 25 and 110 percent for apartments
currently being offered by new owner Clyde
Mull.

Elderly residents now living in the hotel say
that they cannot afford the rent increases and
some say that they will have to leave.

Washington and Lee University will not
renew its current contract for overflow
freshmen housing at the hotel, even though
they have an option to do so.

Potential office space at the hotel will not be
used as such now because prospective rentors
have backed away from the deal.

Clyde Mull has begun major renovations to
the hotel which he says will be expensive.

The new single room rates are $125 per
month on a 10- month lease. Previous hotel
rents already under contract depend on the
particular situation and Mull said that the
size of the room and size or lack of a bathroom
determine the rents.

Upperclassmen and law students presently
live at the hotel. Marc Birenbaum, a junior,
said that he now pays $100 a month for his
fifth floor room which consists of a single

room with a full bath. He also said that the
rents will remain the same until his lease ex-
pires.

Eight elderly people live on the fourth floor.
Their rents vary accordingly, from $150 for
two adjoining rooms with bath, to $140 for one
large room with bath. The standard rent was
$100 for a single room.

Leases were never drawn between the
previous owners and the elderly residents and
as a result the new rent increases went into ef-
fect March 1.

The new leases at the hotel have several
restrictions.

There is a $100 deposit per room, no option
to renew the lease, a requirement to pay the
first and last month’s rent upon signing the
document, a clause forbidding all pets, a
clause forbidding all objects to be off the win-
dowsills (including the leasee himself sitting
on it) and a clause forbidding all cooking ap-
pliances, heating appliances or ‘‘light
housekeeping” appliances. There is also a
clause that states ‘‘no overnight guests will be
permitted on the leased premises.”’

‘In the event the premises are occupied in
such a manner as to constitute a nuisance to

SAB To Profit
On Fancy Dress

by John Billmyre

The Student Activities Board
could make as much as $3,500 in
profits from this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball.

Traditionally, the SAB has
lost money on Fancy Dress.

‘We budgeted to lose about
$5,000 originally, but several
circumstances resulted in a
profit,”’ said SAB treasurer Bill
Ridge about the $8,000 dif-
ference in the budget figure and
the final tally.

Ridge estimated that a total
of 1,800 tickets were sold at $15
apiece, for a ticket sales total of
$27,000.

Expenses, as closely as they
can be determined at this time,

were estimated at $22,763.55 by
Ridge, for an overall profit on
Fancy Dress of $4,236.45.

One bill, from Buildings and
Grounds for the after-theBall
clean-up, is still outstanding,
Ridge said. He cautioned that
the clean-up bill could run over
$1,000.

James L. Arthur, Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds,
said this year’s clean-up was no
worse than last year’s. The bill
last year was $754.85, Arthur
said.

One major saving over last
year, according to Ridge, was
the cost of Thursday night’s
entertainment. The Vandales

20 Couples Registered
For Dance Marathon

With the Muscular Dystrophy
Dance Marathon only about one
week away, 20 couples have
registered to participate.

Mayor Charles E. Phillips has
declared the weekend
‘*Muscular Dystrophy
Weekend”’ for the city of Lex-
ington.

Events have been planned to
enliven the weekend (March
23-25) and the band schedule is
as impressive as it is long.

Fraternities are going to hold
a Red Square Party Friday
afternoon to get the ball rolling.
That night will be ‘‘Soul Night”
in Evans Dining Hall.

After participating in events
such as arm wrestling, pie
eating, dancing and a wet tee-
shirt competition, those atten-
ding the marathon can listen to
Jimmy Bishop and Turning
Point.

Bishop will play from 8-12
p.m. and will be followed by
Body 2nd Soul from 124 a.m.
Both bands are popular on cam-
pus and Body and Soul features
a former Miss Rockbridge
County beauty queen.

The marathon music will be
cranked again Saturday morn-
ing at 6:00, when tapes are

Contact Debate Scheduled For Wednesday

Former Sen. Eugene McCar-
thy and publisher William A.
Rusher will debate on ‘The
Directions for the 1980s”
Wednesday, March 21, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel

Anticipated as topics of
debate between the two men
will be the United States’ chang-
ing posture on China, the
energy crisis, the balance of
power in Europe, and other
issues expected to affect the
U.S inthe next decade.

MeCarthy is best
remembered today for his
“yrassroots’’ presidential cam-
paign in 1968 which gave a large
boost to the antiwar movement
opposing the Vietnam War.

He again ran for the presiden-
cy in 1976 as an Independent
charging that the United States’
two-party political system was
obselete and had led to ‘‘bipar-
tisan war, bipartisan economic
tailures, and abuse of the Bill of
Rights under both parties.”

McCarthy served as a Con-
“ressman from Minnesota's 4th
District in the 8lst to the 85th
Congresses. ;

He became one of Min-
nesota’s Senators in 1958 and
during his 12-year tenure in the
U.S. Senate was a_ ranking
member on the Senate Finance,
the Foreign Relations, and the
Government Operations com-
mittees.

He is author of several books,
among them **A Liberal Answer
to the Conservative Challenge,”
“The Year of the People,”’ and
“Mr. Racoon and His Friends.”

McCarthy

Currently, he is a syndicated
columnist writing on political
issues for a number of major
newspapers across the country,
among them the Washington
Star.

William <A. Rusher is
recognized as one of the
foremost spokesmen for the
conservative viewpoint in the
country today.

He has been the publisher of

William F. Buckley’s journal
National Review since 1957.

Rusher has also made regular
appearances on ‘The’ Ad-
vocates,"’ an Emmy Award-
winning program on the Public
Broadcasting System. He has
also appeared on the ABC
television network’s ‘‘Good
Morning, America” show.

EC Lends Rugby Club $450

by David Greer

The Student Body Executive
Committee voted to lend the
Rugby Club $450 for the pur-
chase of uniforms.

Club member Doug Willis told
the EC that the club has ordered
30 uniforms for $900 and expects
them to arrive C.O.D. on Fri-
day.

Willis said that the club can’t
collect the entire $900 by Fri-
day, and that the $900 price in-
cludes a special deal that will
give the club extra equipment,
such as rugby balls.

Willis said that last year the
Rugby Club received $1,000
from the EC. Of the that money,
about $300 is left.

Willis said that he does not
know exactly where the money
went, though he is not treasurer
of the club.

He added, though, that closer
track will be kept of the money
in the future.

Sophomore — representative
Bob Willis made the motion to
lend the club the $450, to be paid
back one week after Spring
Break.

EC vice president Bill Tucker
voted against the proposal, say-
ing, ‘‘I don’t see that the job of
the EC is lending money to
athletic teams, be it rugby or
lacrosse or anything.”’

First year law representative
Neal Brickman added that he

would like to see ‘‘some sort of
accounting method that can be
visible’’ used by the team in the
future.

In other business, EC presi-
dent Beau Dudley said he does
not foresee any action being
taken this year on the athletic
petition. The petition requested
leaving one basketball court in
the gym open for student use.

Dudley said that President
Huntley and Dr. Elmes, of the
faculty athletic committee,
gave the impression that

nothing would be done this year.

Junior representative Steve
Abraham said that he had
heard complaints about cam-
paign posters being torn down
on the Colonnade.

Abraham said that one stu-
dent told him he saw a professor
removing a campaign poster.

Dudley said that he would
check with Buildings and
Grounds, saying they may have
a policy against putting tape on
the white column surfaces.

the tenants and to the lessor, it
is the option of the lessor upon
three days notice, to declare the
lease null and void and take
possession of said premises
without recourse to a court of
law.”

Parking is extra too. It’s $10a
month for a reserved space in
the lot behind the hotel.

Elderly Leaving

Several elderly residents of
the hotel are leaving because of
rent increases which they can-
not afford.

‘The reason why we are leav-
ing is because of the rent in-
creases,”’ said one elderly resi-
dent of the hotel. The resident
refused to be identified because
of fear of antagonizing the new
owner. ‘‘We are looking for a
place right now,” the resident
adds.

“It’s not justified for me
(referring to the rent increase)
because I’m on a fixed in-
come,’’ comments one resident.
“I told him (Mull) that we
couldn’t pay the extra money,”
adds another. ‘‘Oh, sure, we'll
have to cut back on some
things.”

“We have nowhere to go,”
they said. ‘‘We haven’t found a
place yet,” they continued. ‘“‘We
are also at a disadvantage, we
have no furniture,’™ they state.
“If you can find a furnished
place as convenient as this, then
I'd like to know about it.’’ The
rent has to be reasonable
though.

“I’m leaving,’ states Arthur
Silver who recently turned 90
years old. ‘‘If I can find a room,
I’ll stay through the summer,”’
Silver adds. ‘‘If I can’t find a
room, well...I’drather not say,”
continues Silver commenting on
whether he feels the 25 percent
increase is fair.

“I will tell you that the rent
increase weighed heavily in my
decision to stay or leave, I have
enjoyed my stay here though,”’
Silver said.

Silver informed Mull that he

Clyde Mull, the new owner of
the Robert EF. Lee Hotel.

 

“Just Social Security and
that's all,’ said Herbert
Camden while outlining his
financial situation. His rent is
also now $125 a month. “I'll
have to live with it,” he adds.
‘*My intentions up till now are to
stay."’ Camden continues.
‘Sure I'll have to cut back on
some things **

“I have to spend a couple
dollars a day for cabs,” says

Camden. “I'm slightly — in-
capacitated. I cant walk
much.”

“I'd rather have lower rents

and see the place full, than
higher rents and few people,”
Camden said.

“Tll have to wait and see,”
said Danny Barker, an
employee for the hotel. *'$125
for two rooms — I’m paying
that rate until the end of March.
He, (Mull) wants $200,” con-
tinues Barker. ‘‘I'd like to have
two rooms at the old rate but I
don’t think that’s possible. I
might have to move,” ends
Barker.

‘“He’s raised everybody’s
rent $25,”’ said Bill Thompson,
now part-time employee of the
hotel. He also lives at the hotel
but has not as yet had his rent
raised on his fourth floor room.
“Everything is going up,’’ said
Tho son. “Here it was reflected
in the rents. I shouldn’t say
anything more about it,” said
Tho son.

Other residents declined to
comment on the new rents.

Silver reflected the general
attitude of the non-college
residents. He, as others stated,
said that the rent increase
would be a burden, it would
jeopardize their opportunity to
stay at the hotel, but nothing
could be done about it because
of the lack of affordable housing
in the area.

W&L Will Not
Renew Lease

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will not renew its lease con-
tract with the Robert E. Lee
Hotel, Dean H. Robert Huntley
said. The lease terminates at
the end of theschool year. |

The Associate Dean of
Students said that the Universi-
ty presently rents the second
and third floors of the hotel for
$575 per single room and $525
per person for a double.

The figures were arrived at
by taking the price of the most

‘expensive single offered on

campus and using that as a rate
for the rooms. The double room
prices were arrived at through
similar means. The reason for
those prices, Huntley said, was
because the hotel rooms were
more luxurious than other
rooms.

Thirty freshmen now live in
the hotel with two dormitory
counsellors.

Huntley said that one reason
why the University would not
renew its lease was because of
differences in the contract
negotiations with hotel owner
Clyde Mull. The University,
however, can still renew its
lease.

Parking Lot
Dispute

One dispute resulted from an
oral agreement with the
previous owners of the hotel
which allowed freshmen to park
in the hotel's lot free of charge.
Mull rejected that agreement
when ownership was transfer-
red to him, which he is legally
entitled to do, and as a result
has asked students living at the
hotel to pay a $10 parking
charge if they want a reserved
space.

Huntley reported that two
students agreed to pay the fee
but that others wishing not to
pay were given permission to
park in the ‘A’ parking lots.
which normally exclude

freshmen automobiles
When asked whether
Washington and Lee will have
an overflow of students next
year and the problem of finding
them available housing,
Huntley remarked that there
will be no overflow of freshmen
and that the University was
aiming for 350 admissions.
‘That is another reason why we
will not lease hotel spaces,”
said Huntley. ‘“‘We won't need
that extra room.”’
Business Deal
Fell Through

The potential renting of the
second and third floors of the
Robert E. Lee Hotel to the
Rockbridge Board of Super-
visors and County School Board
fell through, said Mull, while in-
dicating the outcome with his
thumb pointing to the floor.

Each group was considering
renting seven office spaces, ten
storage spaces, and seven park-
ing spots. The County School
Board was also considering ren-
ting the second floor ballroom.

The rents being considered
were $1270 per month for the
one excluding the ballroom and
$1420 for the one with the extra
room. Mull stated that he is still
willing to allow office space but
made it clear that spaces were
limited and on a ‘“‘first come,
first serve basis.” -

“The whole ball of wax is
riding on this,” said Mull, while
sitting in his new office at the
hotel. “I don’t have much
money,” he adds. “I’ve mor-
tgaged everything. I have no
regrets about it though.”’

“It’s a free
enterprise system”

In explaining the large rent
increase, Mull explained that
“It’s a free enterprise system.”’
and that he personally sees a
return on his new investment.

“There is an expensive mon-
thly amount of dollars and cents
going out to Keep this building in
operation,’ Mull added.

Mull also commented in a
Feb. 15 Ring-tum Phi interview
that ‘‘these residents have been
paying rent figures which
haven't kept up with the times
for many years.”’

Regarding the current park-
ing situation said that “if they
(W&L freshmen) were entitled
to parking they'd get it,” but
they aren’t. ‘It’s in my finan-
cial interests” to charge $10 a
parking space because ‘‘money
has to be generated’ to patch,
pave and line that lot. That
money has got to come from
somewhere, Mull said.
‘Guaranteed parking would be
almost impossible,’ continued
Mull.

There are roughtly 33 spaces
in the lot and only eight left to
rent.

Commenting on his respon-
sibility to the elderly people liv-
ing in the hotel, Mull said that
he is “not running a home for
the aged. I don't get subsidized
by the government to pay my
bills.

“] don't think that’s my

responsibility,’ added Mull
referring to his help in possible
relocation. ‘‘They're not

obligated to me or me to them.”
Moving now to the low cost
housing situation, Mull said that

“the city and county have made
certain kinds of efforts.

“Look at Buena Vista,” he
said, ‘150 housing units were
built and most were occupied.
Next year they were vacant
because the people couldn't pay
their utility bills.” It, un-
fortunately, is a fact of life, he
said.

In Lexington there are three
low income housing situations
with long waiting lists. ‘If the
city condemns X number of
houses a year, where do they
relocate those people. Of course
the building costs cannot be
overlooked. Prices have
skyrocketed.’

The hotel ‘‘isn’t a solution to
the housing situation in Lex-

that the color would be similar
to the present one. The outside
trim will also be repainted, pro-
bably white, and also said there
was a possibility of
sandibasting the exterior
brickwork ‘‘especially in the
back where soot and dirt have
discolored the bricks.”

Mull plans to ‘‘use some im-
agination” and ‘‘dress it up,”
referring to the lobby, in order
to make it attractive.

The hotel water system need-
ed a lot of repairs, said Mull.
The hot water tank was cracked
but a new one should be here
this week he added. ‘This
should double the available hot
water and solve the water pro-

ington — it takes more than my
effort. Last year, 31 students
had to go somewhere. I can pro-
vide 31 spaces plus 31 more.
This can free-up housing around
town,” Mull added.
Going After
Student Rentals

‘What I’m going after is the
student rentals,’ said Mull.
“I’ve been in it for years and I
think I have the experience and
know-how for safe comfortable
living conditions at a cost they
can afford. I’m hope this will
drive 70-odd students to the
Robert E. Lee.’

According to Mull’s play, he
intends to have 70 rooms ready
for the next school year. Ten of
the rooms will be doubles. He
also emphasized he ‘won't hold
rooms empty for offices."’

The subject of repairs evoked
a large response from Mull. He
stated that the building was in
good shape but wasn't quite up
to his standards. Mull said that
he would individually check
every room and fix all pro-
blems.

Repairs

‘All the rooms and halls will
be repainted."’ said Mull adding

blem*’ The timer on the boiler
also had to be replaced at a cost
of over $400.

The present system of oil heat
is going to be changed, Mull
said, and it would be converted
to oil and gas at a cost of ap-
proximately $4,000. Mull said
this system would be more
economical.

To help conserve heat, Mull
said he was going to install
“foyer type doors” in the three
main entrances. “This should
conserve a lot of energy.”’ he
said, and hoped to have the
doors installed in a few weeks.

Referring to the total cost,
Mull said that ‘he will have to
wait and see how much money
is generated."’ The necessity of
the repair will determine its
priority, Mull added. ‘It
depends on how many leases
are signed” in the near future.
“That's the Virginia way, you
pay as you go.

“It's showing good signs,”
concluded Mull, *‘and I've made
no shocking discoveries. I'll try
to work with it the best I can
with the amount of resources |
have at my disposal. | think it
will work out well,” he said.

Musical Mainstream

Remote Control
The Tubes
A &MSP4751

The Tubes are nothing if not
misunderstood. They’ve been
called everything from punk
rockers to ‘‘art’’ rockers
(neither of which is true), and
occasionally portrayed as a
group of drug-crazed perverts
intent upon destroying the
moral fiber of American society
(this last no doubt inspired by

the tongue-in-cheek ‘‘Don’t
Touch Me There’ and the
underground classic. ‘White

Punks on Dope’’).

The key to understanding and
even enjoying the Tubes,
though, is never to take them
seriously (they certainly don’t
take themselves seriously). A
close look at the band’s record-
ed work to date, and more par-
ticularly their stage show,
reveals that the Tubes are a
cultural phenomenon above all
else.

These guys are satirists more
than musicians (though their
musical skills are quite ade-
quate). Their most recent stage
show featured a take-off on
punk rock, complete with safety
pins, a chain saw, and vile lead
singer. During ‘‘Smoke (Vie en
Fumer),’’ the band poked fun at

America’s nicotine habit.

The Tubes in concert are a
unique experience, though it
should be noted that some parts
of the show are not designed for
those easily offended.

Translating the humor and
skill of their live performances
onto viny] has been difficult for
the band, however — until now.
Remote Control is by no means
a great record, but it does
showcase the Tubes’ inherent
strengths (and minimize their
weaknesses) more effectively
than any of the group’s releases
to date.

It doesn’t seem right to call it
a “concept”’ album That im-
plies a great deal of thought and
levity — but the album’s songs
all deal with one subject; name-
ly, television. (Check out the
cover if nothing else — it’s a
minor classic.) The songs and
melodies range from fair to ex-
cellent, with “Turn Me On”’ in
the former category and
“Prime Time,” the single from
the LP, in the latter (could this
one make it on AM radio? ).

As usual, it’s the lyrics that
carry this Tubes album. Par-
ticularly strong are “TV Is
King” and ‘‘Telecide’’ (‘TV
suicide/Whht a lovely way to
die’). Remote Control is a

Love, Wit, Reality:

 

by R.B. Ramirez
“Truth is lies told by a woman,”’
— Ferenc Molnar

Opening next week at the
University Theatre is a show
that has a lot to say...to anyone
who cares much about love, wit,
or the struggle to arrive at an
objective concept of reality.

The play, The Guardsman,
was written by Ferenc Molnar,
a name that, here and now
means very little to us; we
know about as much about it as
we do of 1910 Budapest, both the
setting of the play and the home
of Molnar when he wrote it.

Well, it won’t hurt to know '

more. _
Molnar, after all, was a
leader in the final spasm of

thoroughly enjoyable album, as
long as it’s taken in the spirit
with which it was offered — a
lot of fun with perhaps the
tiniest bit of social commentary
thrown in.

Why does the W&L Bookstore
charge $10 for The Complete
Book of Running when the
Crown Book Stores in
Washington are selling it for
$6.50? The answer is, of course,
a matter of economics, as is the
case with so much of life today.
Crown Books, with their satura-
tion advertising is concen-
trating on current best-sellers
and remainders with -high-
volume fast turnover sales. The
margin of profit on each sale is
very narrow. The owner of

Eastern European _intellec-
tualism before the Great War
ended forever an age that is
remote to us as that of Louis
XIV. Molnar was a sensation in
the old Hapsburg Empire;
there he did for the theatre what
Klimt, Freud, Schonberg,
Mahler, and Kafka were doing
for their respective callings:
giving birth to the 20th century.

It was a new order of thought
to which he belonged, one which
must have realized how much of
the old order depended upon the
gifts of illusion, and how the
time was coming when those il-
lusions could no longer be sus-
tained. The plot of The Guard-
sman has to do with a married
couple, both actors, and she
with a roving eye.

Nandor, the husband, in a
desperate effort to circumvent
the infidelities of his wife Ilona
decides to masquerade as the
Guardsman, and to become not
the husband of the unfaithful
wife, but the lover. She appears
to be taken in, and a romance
ensues, one rooted in the almost
never-grasped option of rejec-
ting the factual, in favor of the
illusion, if that indeed is what
pleases the best.

The play capitalizes effective-

The University Theatre company work out another part of The Guardsman.

Eye And Ear:

Crown Books Stores has strong
financial backing from his

_ father and is expanding rapidly

in the Northern Virginia - DC
area. Independent booksellers
are suffering and yelling bloody
murder. Crown Books claim
that books are too expensive
(and I certainly agree) and that
they are selling what the public
wants. But, the small full-
service stores argue that Crown
Books is doing a disservice to
discriminating and intelligent
readers, now and in the future,

ly upon the device of the play
within the play: the second act
is set in a box at the Budapest
Opera House, and is filled with
telling double  entendres,
characters commenting osten-
sibly on the scene being played
before them, but also, and —
this is important — consciously,
on the scene which they realize
they themselves are playing.

It isn’t until the final act that
we find out that the wife was
never deceived by the hus-
band’s ruse, and didn’t need to
be. The relish of the affair was
not in its substance but its
pretense: sex and love were not
the point of the adultery so
much as the psyche’s need to
wallow in a fantasy of those
very things.

Being confronted with the
truth in the end, in fact, spoils
the entire thing; in fact, Ilona’s
restlessness once again takes
control, and we leave her look-
ing out of a window, waiting not
for love or truth but illusion and
fantasy, a luxury’ she
recognizes and has allowed
herself to enjoy.

I urge you to enjoy the luxury
of seeing the show, certainly

with its narrow selection.

If you want a book which
Crown does not have, they will
not get it for you. Too, Crown
books does not carry so-called
“back list’’ titles. These books
of literary and _ intellectual
merit, are to be found only in
the ‘‘personal’’ bookstores
which comprise the backbone of
the book selling industry. I
would bet, on little direct
knowledge, that many of the
best selling paperbacks of the
W&L Bookstore would not be
found at Crown Books. It seems
to me that at Crown Books peo-
ple browse for bargains rather
than for books.

Bookselling is more than mer-
chandising, it is shared en-
thusiasm for the printed word in
all its vagaries.

iRocky Horror!

by Mark Kinniburgh and
Dick Barron
Media Kids-at-large

Here it is, go see it. The
Rocky Horror Picture Show
will be screened Friday and
Saturday nights at 9:30 p.m.
and midnight and Sunday at
2:00 p.m. in W&L’s duPont
auditorium. We can’t add
anything new to what has
already been said in every ma-
jor publication in the United
States about this movie, but we
can say it’s the most unique
visual experience to hit W&L in
many a year.

During the past two years,
The Rocky Horror Picture Show
has reached bona fide cult
status in the U.S. A film adapta-
tion of the Broadway hit, The
Rocky Horror Show, this film
has attracted a loyal folloiwng
of theater goers who make an
evening of imitating characters
in the movie, complete with
costumes and props.

Fans have always imitated
their screen favorites, most
recently adopting the horn-
rimmed glasses, funny ties, and
loose clothing inspired by Annie
Hall. Rocky Horroradds a new
twist to this type of character
imitation — its fans donning full
transvestite regalia.

Let us explain. Rocky Horror
is a spoof of the horror story
genre, complete with a mad
scientist, in this case, a
transvestite named Dr. Frank
N. Furter. The plot is simple—
two innocents stumble into the
doctor’s strange laboratory
world, which holds such outlan-
dish characters as a warped
butler, a loboto- . mized
delivery boy, a blonde, well-
muscled thing, created by the

Guardsman

(continued from page 4)
scripts to be produced at W&L
in a very long time.

The Guardsman, and, in fact,

Molnar, has not received the at-
tention deserved. This expres-
sionistic treatment of a man
and wife abstracting
themselves from their lives, in
order to remark on them, to
themselves, to each other, and
to us, remains a landmark in
the astonishing progress of 20th
century continental drama.

doctor, and scores of zanies in
skin-tite pants and kiddie
sunglasses. Sounds good? Keep
reading.

Put it all together and it spells
ninety minutes of fun-filled con-
fusion. The characters in the
film are composites, bringing to
mind standard types from
Frankenstein toClose En-
counters. Richard O’brien’s
clever screenplay, music and
lyrics provide a healthy dose of
“gorgeous gals, thrills and
chills, and lotsa larfs and sex.”

The actors are excellent in
their performances, portraying
their roles with indisputable
clarity. Tim Curry, as the mad
Frank N. Furter is both comic
and hauntingly melodramatic

in his theatrical performance.
As the naive Janet, Susan
Sarandon and her obvious
female charms are alone worth
the price of admission, but she
also demonstrates a clear ac-
ting ability.

Rocky Horror is a_ fine
musical as well, most of the
dialogue being set to music
ranging from Rock ‘N Roll to
sing-along Broadway. A special
favorite of most audiences is
“The Time Warp,” named after
a dance similar to the ever-
popular “‘hokey pokey” (’’It’s
just a jump to the left/and then
a step to the right. . .”’). Also
notable is Meatloaf’s rendition
of ‘‘Hot Potootie Bless My Soul’’

the Bottom Line and proceeded
to knock over his table while
getting up to leave, spilling a
very noticeable bottle of reds in
the process, and no doubt thank-
ing his stars that he was in the
Big Apple rather than Toronto.

The rest of the band was safe-
ly tucked away in Nassau at the
time, finishing up work on their
new album and mixing down
some tapes from last summer’s
tour for two King Biscuit
Flower Hour broadcasts to be
aired this spring.

The old theory that musicians
never learn from past mistakes
has recently been reinforced by
a whole slew of musically
disastrous reunion albums that
have appeared in the past few

‘months. The previously men-

tioned McGuinn, Clark, and
Hillman Bank has made a se-
cond try at a Byrds reunion (the
first one having been one of the
biggest financial catastrophes
in the history of the business).
The Guess Who are back
toegther, sans Randy Bachman
and Burton Cummings, the only
ones who really mattered. Badf-
inger has made a second try,
once again without the
assistance of two key members,
and, last but not least, the
Allman Brothers, still trying to
shake off the deaths of Duane
Allman and Berry Oakley, are
back with a new album on

Capricorn entitled ‘‘Enlighten-
ed Rogues.”’

Judging by the looks of
things, the spring of 1979 could
well be a monentous one for
rock’n’roll. Among the artists
due for new releases in the next
few months are Patti Smith,
Nick Lowe, Foreigner, Tom
Robinson, Manfred Mann, Ex-
ile, Cheap Trick, Carlene
Carter, Chuck Berry, Yes,
ELP, Ian Hunter (backed by
Springsteen’s E Street Band),
and, the king of rock’n’roll
himself, Shaun Cassidy.

And, believe it or not, that’s
only a random sampling of
what’s to come. So keep your
ears and eyes open for the spr-
ing of “79 — it may be one of the
best yet. *

In the Cockpit:

 

Now playing at duPont:

The Return of the Pink Panther Peter Sellers, Christopher Plum-
mer, Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom.

Applauded by critics as well as audiences across the country,
Return brings back Peter Sellers as the greatest comedy series
hero of the last 15 years — the fumbling, madcap Inspector
Clouseau. Also back again are all the creative talents who have
made the Pink Panther films so irresistible Writer-director Blake
Edwards, composer Henry Mancini, animator Richard Williams.
Clouseau’s attempts to recover a precious jewel, stolen from a Mid-
die Eastern kingdom, lead from one brilliantly zany sketch to
another, all recalling some of the finest work of the screen’s
greatest comics.

Ace Weems

This weekend, the ever-
popular Ace Weems and the Fat
Meat Boys will return to the
Cockpit. This will be the band’s
first appearance on campus
since they opened the show for
the Allstars at the Library Par-
ty, and many remember what a
rousing performance it was.

James Leva and Chad
Crumm are the fiddlers for the
Fat Meat Boys, and although
both are from the north, they
have a very distinct old
southern sound. When asked
about the group’s unusual
name, they told the tale of an
English shepherd, Ace Weems,
who, while tending his sheep,
constantly played Irish folk
tunes on his fiddle. His music
was overheard by some
pilgrims on their way to the
Crusades, and they broke out
their instruments, and began to
play. They played until the
Crusades ended and all settled
down to fiddling their lives
away.

The Fat Meat Boys have
played up and down the East
Coast, and spend their sum-
mers at festivals and in Mar-
tha’s Vineyard as_ well.
Although they make their home
in Lexington, they do not like to
be known as a “‘local’”’ band.
“That sort of classifies us in a
way that is unflattering” says

What Can Be Done A

by Randy Smith
‘Hey buddy, can you lend mea dime?”

You've probably met him, accidently. His
name is unimportant, and on this particular
spring-like day he was teetering on the
sidewalk in front of Lexington’s Alcohol
Beverage Control (ABC) store.

He's not much on conversation. His red,
glassy eyes seem to look in your direction, but
not really at you. His clothes are ill- fitting
and dirty. His hair is greasy, and his breath
reeks of cheap wine

And he’s asking you for money.

You tell him sorry, and continue on your
way up the street. And you might think to
yourself, ‘What a nuisance these town drunks
are,

In the summer they lounge in front of the
Lyric Cinema and walk up the alley to sun
next to the post office for the afternoon, their
bottle safely hidden in the bushes nearby.

Even in the cold of winter you see them.
Some find shelter on the long winter days ina
room above Clayton’s Taxi on Jefferson
Street.

They are Lexington’s visible alcohol pro-
blem, and nobody really seems to know what
to do about them.

But street inebriants account for only three
percent of the alcoholic population in
Rockbridge County, according to Dr. Robert
P. Varley, director of Alcohol Services of
Rockbridge, Inc., and a former Episcopalian
bishop.

In a recently released state- wide survey
conducted by Virginia's Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Board, Lexington was
ranked fourth in the number of alcohol
related deaths per population in the survey.
Nearby Buena Vista was ranked third.

Lexington was llth in the state in the
number of alcohol related arrests per popula-
tion. Buena Vista was 10th.

As the State Board—which has access to all
hospital records throughout Virginia— aptly
pul it: “The highest arrest rates for alcohol
related violations generally are found in the
southwest, more rural areas of the state.”

The Street Drunk

Although Varley said that there is really no
typical street drunk, he painted a grim
general picture:

“He has no particular skills. He lives in a
one-room arrangement. It's much easier,
frankly, to have a bottle of Ripple or Wild
Irish Rose than it is to cook a piece of food.

“Occasionally, they'll do half a day’s work.
But emotionally and psychologically they are
incapable of any long-term work. They'll
work for a day or two, and make enough

_ money for the next bottle.

“But I'll say this, they're the most generous
guys going. When they get a bottle, they don't
keep it for themselves, they look for a buddy
toshare it.”

 

Varley said most public drunks come from
disadvantaged backgrounds‘‘that economic
bracket where they couldn’t rub two cents
together’’—and their level of education is
usually no better than the sixth or seventh
grade.

They are victims of ‘a high rate of
unemployment, a high rate of illiteracy, and
social frustration,’’ Varley said. ‘‘They are in
a constantly depressed state.”

 

He says his name is Jesse and he’s looking for
work,

His problems are that it is 7 p.m., he has not
bathed in several days, and that he killed off the
better half of a fifth of gin before he walked into
the fraternity house, bottle in hand.

He stumbled around, pretending or thinking
that he knew the students, asking for a job, offer-
ing his bottle.

tt first he was fun to play with—he got confus-
ed when he was spoken to—but the students
quickly tired of making fun of him and left the
roam,

No one could persuade fim to leave. So he
slaved,

He wanted work. “Give me a chance,” he said.

“TL used to work here.” But he couldn't remember
when. He didn't remember any of the faces on
the old fraternity composite pictures.

All he wanted was a job.

His words became more slurred as he slowly
finished his bottle. He began to cry. He got sick
to his stomach. He had been out of work for
seven or eight years, he said.

His bottle was empty by the time he was
escorted out the door. None of the college
students had wanted to touch him, but he
wouldn't have left without “assistance.”

He staggered and fell, got up and weaved his
way slowly down the street toward the next
fraternity house. ,

 

“I think we have to define one thing,’
Varley cautioned, ‘‘they (street drunks) have
the most visibility, but that class of alcoholic
represents, at best, only three percent of the
alcoholic population.”

“The unfortunate part of it is,’’ he con-
tinued, ‘‘that that three percent gets about 80
percent of the attention.”’

center. From there, he anticipates they will
be sent to an alcohol treatment institution, but
at least they’ll be off the streets and out of

, town.

Dr. Varley disagrees, however, that alcohol
treatment programs are an effective answer
for the street drunk’s problems.

sistently with this mood-altering chemical,
that euphoric state is normal— sobriety is ab-
normal.”

Street drunks, said Varley, have ‘‘some
brain damage’”’ as a result of their prolonged
use of alcohol.

“Their ability to comprehend just isn’t
there,” he said. ‘And you can try
psychotherapy, or behavior modification, or
reality therapy and you're just whistling dixie
with a mouthful of crackers.”

‘You don’t break a habit of long-standing in
just 28 days,”’ Varley said.

He also noted that they probably wouldn’t
be able to pay for the treatment. They usually
have no insurance and, if they are lucky, they

 

“The only way to put an end to it (public drunkenness)
is to pull them (the drunks) off the street.”

“It’s completely useless to send a street
alcoholic to a treatment center. They can’t
take it,”’ he said.

“It’s absolutely dumb to take these guys off
the street, bring them in, give them a cake of
soap, a towel, and a shower, and clean sheets.
They’re totally out of it.”

Varley explained that every time a person
gets drunk, he kills 10,000 brain cells that can
never be used again.

“When they bathe their bodies so con-

   

might claim a social security check.

“People say, ‘If they only used willpower.’
But willpower is absolutely worthless for the
addict. They’ve lost it. Alcohol does not
destroy the will’ but it significantly bends it so
that these people are incapable of making
responsible judgments.”

“They are just like advanced diabetics or
advanced epileptics: they need help, but do
not respond to traditional types of therapy,”
Varley said.

. New Library Has Problems

by Joe Dashiell

As construction of the new
undergraduate library nears
completion, several problems
still remain with the library’s
operation.

The major problem is with
students using the emergency
exits on the lower levels instead
of the main exit on the upper
level, Head Librarian Maurice
D. Leach said Wednesday.

The upper level door is in-
tended to be the only regular ex-
it for two reasons, Leach said.

First, from time to time,
books are removed from the
library without first being
checked out. In past inven-
tories, losses have been as high
as 2,000 volumes out of the
200,000 volume total inventory,
Leach said,

He noted that a major con-
sideration in the decision to in-
stall an alarm system rather
than a closed-circuit television
monitoring system was the ex-
istence of the honor code at
Washington and Lee.

In addition, Leach said the
staff conducts studies to deter-
mine how best to utilize the
library’s facilities. “We want to
know who is in the building. We
do statistical counts here that
determine when the building is
open, when it's closed, and what
types of services to provide at
different hours,’ Leach said.

The problem has just become
apparent because workmen
recently finished installing the
alarm system which monitors
the emergency exits.

When a person uses one of the

exits, an alarm sounds behind
the circulation desk, as well as
at the exit.

Recommends "'F lop House”
Varley recommended establishing a ‘flop
house”’ or a “halfway house"’ in Rockbridge
County as the best way of giving the recover-
ing alcoholic ‘‘a chance to get reintroduced in-
to society.”

‘I think we could raise enough money to ac-
quire an old motel, and people would respond
quite readily in an effort to get them off the
street,’’ Varley said. ‘‘But then maintaining it
is going to be the problem because these guys
can’t contribute.”

Attorney Read did not share Varley’s op-
timism for the ‘flop house” concept for treat-
ment. ‘‘I will vehemently oppose a halfway
house, a flop house, or any similar program in
our community,’’ he said.

“I’m for shipping them out,’’ Read said.
The Commonwealth’s Attorney wants to get
the public drunk out of town and into treat-
ment centers like the ones in Harrisonburg,
Charlottesville, and Roanoke. He does not
want to start a treatment center here.

Varley would like to see some sort of a pro-
gram set up for the street drunks in this area.

“They (street drunks) are untreatable, so
you don’t think of them in terms of treat-
ment,” Varley explained. ‘‘They’ve passed
the stage where they can respond. Treatment
should have happened long, long ago.”

“But because they too are human, because
they once had a mother, because they once
had a childhood, we can’t just cross them off
as derelicts, weak-willed or immoral people.

“If we think this through, we begin to look
upon them as people who are perhaps not
salvageable from their illness, but perhaps
we could provide a custodial care so they
don’t have to sleep in gutters, doorways, or
feeze to death in back alleys in the winter
months,”’ Varley said.

“I have no ready answer (for what can be
done to help the street drunks of Rockbridge
County),’’ Varley said, ‘‘but I think that a car-
ing, sharing, imaginative community should
cease condemning them and begin to help
them.”

Generals dump Sea Gulls

by Douglas Linton

The Lacrosse Generals
defeated the Sea Gulls of
Salisbury State College yester-
day afternoon by a score of
16-11, as some 1500 fans looked
on at Wilson Field. This victory
raises their regular season
record to 2-0.

Although it had rained for

most of the day, the game was
still held in the stadium. Along
with a slight wind, the muddy
conditions made for slippery
play and somewhat inhibited
each team’s performance.

The Sea Gulls jumped out to a
2-0 lead early in the first
quarter, but from that point on
Salisbury St. never scored two
consecutive goals. George San-
‘os scored first for the Generals
and after Salisbury St. respond-
2d with one more, John Black
and Jay Foster scored, respec-
ively, to make it 3-3. The Sea
aulls netted one more before
Mike Pressler made the score 4
apiece by the end of the first
juarter.

The second period saw Sandy
McDonald score twice, while
xeorge Santos tallied his se-

cond and John Kemp netted
what was to be the first of his
four goals. The Generals led 8-5
at the half.

Jeff Fritz and John Hooper
each had one in the third to
answer for each of the Sea
Gull’s_ tallies. It was 10-7,
Generals, with one quarter left
to play.

The final period had Santos
hitting his third score, as Fritz
also hit two more of his total of
three for the day. Kemp had an
outstanding period scoring
three more, one of which proved
to be the game winner.

Seven of the sixteen goals

were assisted. John Black had
three, while Fritz, Kemp,

Pressler, and Rob Staugaitis
each helped with one.

While Fritz had three goals
and an assist, it should still be
noted that he didn’t play the
whole game due to a high fever.
He played most of the second
half, but only 50 seconds in the
first. His assist came in these 50
seconds, cold off the bench!

Coach Emmer was fairly
pleased and especially happy
that his midfielders are scoring

more. One of these middies was

his best day wearing a W&L

outstanding play he was named

Although it got its first

Field is in ‘‘pretty good shape,”’
according to maintenance. Bar-
ring further inclement weather,
the field should be in fairly good
condition as the Generals do

respect to the upcoming na-

leaving them with a 1-1 mark,

THE

 

RING-TUM PHI

  

Track team opens
season with second

by Greg Branan

Despite being at home last
Friday, the Generals managed
only a second place in the tri-
meet with Liberty Baptist Col-
lege and Roanoke. The score for
this year’s first outdoor meet
was Liberty Baptist - 83, W&L -
68, and Roanoke - 29.

In commenting on the meet,
Coach Norris Aldridge said,
‘“‘We performed to our
capabilities. It’s not that we
didn’t do well, they just did bet-
ter.”’ He added that Liberty
Baptist was much improved
over last year, “especially in
the weight and throwing
events.”’

The running events went ‘‘as
expected, with pretty good
times for this early in the
season.”

Top performers in the runn-
ing events included tri-captain,
Jack Norberg, who won the 440,
220 and ran a leg on the winning
440 relay team; another tri-
captain, Stewart Atkinson, who
placed second in the 100, 220 and
also ran a leg on the 440 relay
team; Chris Daniel, second in
the mile; and Rich Bird, third in
the mile. Coach Aldridge was
surprised at sweeping the 120
high hurdles. Placing first was
tri-captain Norvell Scott, se-
cond was Russ Rector, and
third was Jim Vines. Scott also

placed fourth in the in-
termediate hurdles as well as
won the long and triple jumps.
Rector also placed second in the
intermediates and third in the
high jump. Chris Leiser and
Jeff Brown completed the winn-
ing 440 relay team.

Coach Aldridge noted that,
“We had the best throws in the
discus for this early in the
season that we’ve had in a long
time. Liberty Baptist just threw
better.”’ Paul Manning and Phil
Dunley were the top performers
here. Also, Bob Campbell, hav-
ing improved over last year,
took second in the pole vault.

Coach Aldridge stated,
“There is room for improve-
ment.”’ Areas for improvement
are the shot-put, half mile,
three mile and high jump.
Aldridge anticipates improve-
ment as “ODAC championships
approach.”

Davidson
Next Meet

This weekend the Generals
travel to Davidson for the first
dual meet. Aldridge stated,
“It’s expected to be close as
they have improved and it’s go-
ing to take a good effort. It will
probably come down to who
gets the breaks.”’

Tennis Team Opens Season
With Romp Over Rochester

by Nat Lovell

On Tuesday, March 13, the
Generals whipped the visiting
University of Rochester.
Though the final score was 7-2,
the match was much closer
than expected with the
Generals having to clinch the
match in doubles.

At number one singles,
Stewart Jackson served and
volleyed his way to a routine
win over a quick but over-
matched Eric Friedman, 6-2,
6-2. Shaw Cranfield saw some
tough tennis in the first set
against Tom Lindh but his un-
canny touch carried him
through to a two-set victory 7-5,
6-1. Big Doug Gaker’s powerful

serve and long reach brought
him a victory over an obnoxious
Mike Mahoney at number three
singles 6-4, 6-4. First-match
pressure got the better of Dave
Constine as he went down to fine
playing John Conlin 0-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Pat Norris, better known for his
doubles prowess, lost a close
match to Chris Beck 7-5, 7-5. At
number six, Wes Yonge battled
through the upper court hur-
ricane to defeat an outclassed
Job Sanderval 6-1, 6-2.

Dominant Doubles
The Generals showed their
dominance in doubles, though
Jackson and Cranfield had to go
three sets to take their match

Lax team rolls 16-11;
Faces Syracuse Saturday

(continued from page 8)
earlier in the year.

According to tri-captain at-
tackman Jeff Fritz, the team
was ‘“‘on the field, but didn’t
really play.” The Generals
were down by an insurmoun-
table margin before they even
knew what hit them.

For some unknown reason,
many team members were
making mistakes that they had
not made in years. This is not in
following with the style of
lacrosse which W&L has been
and is accustomed to. Very
simply put, their customary

   
  
 
 

finesse, both individually and as
a team, was lacking.

Two critical mistakes includ-
ed the Generals twive dropping
the ball in ‘“‘man-up”’ situations.
Not only did W&L drop the ball,
but both times Mt. Washington
players recovered the loose ball
and charged downfield for
fastbreak tallies.

Besides W & L never really
getting their game together, it
must be noted that Mt.

Washington is an extremely
talented club. In the end, the
Generals are simply trying to
shake this one off and look to the
more important regular season.

pair were obviously unac-
customed to playing with each
other, but their pounding serves
and deft volleying proved too
much for the Rochester duo.

The score was 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Gaker’s serve and Constine’s
acrobatics at the net combined
for a solid win over Mahoney
and Conlin at number two
doubles 6-4, 6-3. Norris’ incisive
netplay and Yonge’s touch over-
whelmed Beck and Ken
Rasmussen as they romped to
close out the match 6-1, 6-2. The
Generals should have an easy
time versus Morehead State
this Saturday here in Lex-
ington.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A well deserved
tip of the hat

March might seem like a strange time to write a year-end Enter-
tainment overview. .u contraire. Especially in the case of a wor-
thwhile program — a year-end review is worthless. Who can watch
a superb Film Society offering or hear a great band in the Cockpit
after the end of the year?

So here it is — a mid-year year-end commendation u1 two impor-
tant sources of entertainment this year.

As was Claimed early in the year it is now evident that the W&L
Film Society fills an entertainment gap for an impressive number
of people in the W&L community. Between 150 and 200 people have
viewed each of the Film Society’s five presentations this year. If a
constituency that large can be called a niche — the Film Society
has surely found its niche.

Praise of specific films isn’t the point here. Anyone who has
followed the series has his own favorite films and each of this
year’s films has generated a whole spectrum of opinion. Specific
opinions aren’t important — the chance to form them is.

Apparently many of us find it refreshing to be challenged by a
film rather than be asked to ‘switch off’’ for two hours. The Film
Society has done a risky thing — sticking its collective neck out for
the challenging films they've presented. And their gamble has paid
off.

That the Film Society provides a worthwhile service, well, there
is no question. Large audiences indicate that as do the film selec-
tions. This year’s focus on the ‘West German Film Renaissance of
the ’70's”’ for example, brings us not only films — but truly makes a
coherent series out of a segment of the Society’s offerings.

To those of us who are real film buffs — or those of us who wish
we knew more — this kind of careful, informed film selection can
only be beneficial.

There are two films remaining on the Society's docket this year,
one in late March and one in the spring. To those of you who haven't
taken advantage of the Society — go! — you're in for a differnt ex-
perience — perhaps a challenging two hours — but after all — it is
only a movie.

To the Film Society — my hat is off to you — for a job well done.

But this piece isn’t all high brow. For those of us who are seniors
the changes in the Cockpit over four years are rather profound.

Three years ago — not much really happened there (even the food
seemed lethargic).

Not only has the food picked up — but more to the point — now-a-
days — the cadets aren't the only entertainment down there. Burr
Datz and the University Center committee have tremendously ex-
panded and improved the entertainment available in our ‘pit.

When you get down to it — it’s pretty amazing some of the bands
who've played down there. The All-Stars, the Nighthawks, Glenn
Phillips. Amazing because of the consistently good shows — amaz-
ing because who could ever have dreamed that we could use
xeroxes from ‘Rolling Stone” to promote a band playing at W&L?

Datz and company have put the Cockpit on the map. so to speak.
By making a band feel at home and by providing en-
thusiastic audiences in the intimate setting of the Cockpit — Datz
has made the Cockpit a place where bands —- quality bands — like
to play and want to play.

The Cockpit provides a much needed alternative to the typical
Drifters/Beach Boys/Spinners fare. Rock ‘n Roll, the blues, new
wave, and folk have all had their day in the Cockpit.

Early this year there was some questioning of Cockpit cover
charges. After the Nighthawks, et al, most criticism of that prac-
tice has evaporated. What’s a buck to see a show that would cost $4
or $5 in DC?

The Film Society and the New Improved Cockpit, then are two
new — but important — sources of entertainment on campus. Each
venture, though questioned at the outset, has more than proven that
it deserves to exist — that it fills a definite entertainment gap, and
fill it well.

To these groups — thanks — to those who haven't availed
yourselves of the opportunities provided by these groups — you're
why this year-end review was written in March!

SAB thanks students

Dear Fellow Students,

The members of the SAB wish to thank those of you who
cooperated with us in recovering the Man-in-the-Moon and one:of
the I Love NY signs. Both were returned by last weekend —
anonymously. The other sign and the moon's spoon are still at large
and rumored far beyond the “W&L community.’ We intend to
track them down as well.

Thanks again!

Letters To The Editor

Election and library problems discussed

Dear Editor:

The student government elections which
were held this past Monday are a clear il-
lustration of a growing problem which makes
a mockery of any electoral process.

Any election in which there are three major
positions to be selected and only two can-
didates on the ballot demonstrates that the
students do not believe that their efforts
through student government will substantial-
ly change the welfare of their college ex-
perience.

The University’s position is stated clearly
in the catalog: ‘‘the faculty and ad-
ministrative officials give organizations of
student government full cooperation and sup-
port in the discharge of their respon-
sibilities.”

The only problem with this statement is
that it implies that the students wield a much
greater latitude of influence than is actually
true.

Mike Gallagher’s sandbox analogy (last
year) seems to be particularly true in light of
the developments this year between the town
and the fraternities. The town and the ad-
ministration allow the students ‘‘to discharge
their responsibilities” within the confines of
the sandbox, but the mouse traps snare any
student who ventures outside those hallowed
walls.

This lack of real influence may be a
primary reason for the student apathy in the
latest EC election.

Sincerely,
Mike Foley

 

Electwn Wotue

Dear Editor:

We would like to bring to light a rather an-
noying aspect about the new multi-million
dollar undergraduate library. Despite the
fact thatthere are numerous doors along the
right side of the building and elaborate con-
crete walkways and stairways leading to
these doors which must have cost thousands
of dollars, the only entrance and exit to the
building is the main one on the top level. This
is a considerable and néedless inconvenience
for students coming up from Woods Creek
especially.

The argument that the front entrance by the
main desk should be the only access so the
library staff can watch for unchecked
material leaving the building is absurd. The
honor system is supposed to make such polic-
ing procedures unnecessary at this Universi-
ty. And, unless the staff frisked everyone on
the way out, any security measures designed
to detect easily concealable reading material
would be ridiculously inefficient. It’s our
library and everyone should have plenty of
access to it, especially the students in Woods
Creek who had to put up with the blasting, the
rock drills, and the constant din of construc-
tion for three years.

More Letters To The Editor

Pleas For Dance Marathon

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter as a last ditch effort
to try and get people to dance in Washington
and Lee’s Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon.

It is the first time that something like this
has been tried and there is no reason in the
world why this marathon should not be suc-
cessful. We have given away over 200 in-
formation packets, but as of now only about
twenty people have signed up to dance. If you
plan to dance and have not returned your
registration form to Carole Chappell’s office,
please do so immediately so we can better
plan for food, etc. for the dancers.

I have worked, since October, harder on
this project than anything else in my life. I
have had tremendous help from a great
number of people but all this work will be for
naught if not enough decide to dance. We have
good bands lined up, great prizes, and free
food and beer for dancers. The Dance
Marathon Committee has tried to make it as

tempting as possible for people to take part in
the Muscular Dystrophy Dance Marathon.

But, put partying and prizes and free food
and beer aside for a moment and look at the
cause. Muscular Dystrophy affects children
mainly and many times the person will not
live past the age of thirty. Of course it
depends on the type of dystrophy, but no mat-
ter, it still attacks and cripples many people.
The search is under way for the cure to this
disease and one type of fund raiser that has
brought in a great deal of money is a dance
marathon.

Syracuse University has raised $42,000.
Virginia Tech has raised $20,000. All I am ask-
ing for is $5,000. It can be done but not without
the aid of people willing to dance. Please, if
for no one else, dance for those who can’t.

Thank you,

Jay Blumberg

Chairman, Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon

 

Dear Editor:

Please make note that the Grand Prize for
the Muscular Dystrophy Dance-a-thon is a
trip for the winning couple, not individual, to
Walt Disney World in Florida. The trip will
take place during a three-day weekend in
May, and will be sponsored by Eastern
Airlines, Muscular Dystrophy, and Holiday
Inns, Inc. The trip would normally cost ap-
proximately $400.00, including plane fare,
tickets at Disney Worid, and hotel ac-
commodations., All expenses are pre-paid.
Certain couples have already found enough
sponsors to make their odds of winning very

good. Other dancers still have time to get

enough signatures so that they have a chance

of winning. Of course, the amount of time ac-

tually danced is an important factor. Good

luck to all dancers; your efforts will in the end

prove that apathy is not synonymous with

W&L. The money you raise may help a child

out of his wheelchair; that’s really what this
is all about.

cost about $1,000 less than the
two bands last year, Ridge said.

Another thousand dollars that
was budgeted for coins was not
spent.

The company contracted to
manufacture the coins refunded
the SAB’s money because the
coins could not be produced in

time for the Ball, Ridge said.

He added that several Fancy
Dress workers had not yet been
paid for their labors.

Although the entire Fancy
Dress bill has not been figured
down to the penny, it seems ap-
parent that a large profit will be
made by the SAB on this year’s
Ball.

Inspections March 29

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity fined the Pi Kappa
Alpha Fraternity for violating
the city noise ordinance on Fan-
cy Dress weekend.

Pika received a warning
because their band was playing
too loud at 12:30 Sunday morn-
ing, according to president
Frank Ellerbe.

When police told Pika the
band was too loud, the fraterni-
ty had the band stop playing.

Tapes were put on and were
playing when police arrived and
issued a summons at 1:30.

IFC President Jim Davis
said, ‘‘We decided to fine you
(Pika ) $50 because you did get a
warning and because we want
to discourage other fraternities
from violating the noise or-
dinance.”’

The summons was Pika’s
first of the year. Represen-
tatives from Pika will appear in
court on March 27th.

The IFC also announced that
fraternities should turn in their
monthly checklist on March 27

Each fraternity is allowed to
have only one member on the
Judicial Board.

The positions of Rushbook
Editor and Social] Chairman can
be held by fraternities that
already have one member on
the Interfraternity Council
because neither office votes on
the Judicial Board during the
school year.

Kevin Dwyer of Sigma Phi
Epsilon was the only nominee
for Rushbook editor, and Ab
Boxley of Phi Kappa Sigma was
the lone nominee for Social
Chairman.

Alan Pryor of Pi Kappa Phi
and Tom Dutton of Sigma Phi
Epsilon were nominated for
Rush Chairman. The position is
unique in that the Rush Chair-
man is allowed to vote during
Rush only.

 

 

A gold pocket watch was
reported missing a week ago
Friday by W&L dorm
counsellor William T.
Thistlewaite. According to
police Chief James Kirby the
watch, which is valued at $2,000,
has still not been found and the
investigation is continuing.
