President Huntley Expresses
Concern About Fraternities

by John Billmyre
and Bruce Vail

‘‘Fraternities,’’ said
Washington and Lee university
President Robert E. R.
Huntley, ‘‘provide, for better or
worse, the core of the social life
in numbers and tone.’ But,
W&L’s president added, ‘‘time
is about to run out on the frater-
nity system in general, and for
a certain few fraternities in par-
ticular.”’

He offered his statement ‘‘not
as a threat, but as a predic-
tion.”

After almost half of a school
year that has seen fraternity
presidents arrested for noise
violations, fraternities placed
on social probation for unsight-
ly structural conditions and
fraternities banned

Shortage of Available Low
Cost Housing in Lexington

by Mike Lavitt

Lexington has a serious shor-
tage of satisfactory low cost
housing and city residents with
low or fixed incomes will have
to wait one year or more to ob-
tain a-suitable place to tive, an
investigation by WLUR-F'M and
the Ring-tum Phihas revealed.

But City Manager John V.
Doane told the student media
organizations that Lexington’s
housing situation is no worse
than in other cities.

There are three federally sub-
sidized, rent controlled housing
projects in Lexington, but all
three have long waiting lists.

The largest complex is the
Willow Springs Apartments,

located on Route 39 north of
Lexington. The-other two are
the Lexington- Mountain View

Terrace Housing Project and

the Lexington House Apart-
ments, which is open to senior
citizens and disabled people.

Welfare officials say that a
housing allowance is built into
weHare payments. The housing
allowance is fixed for each com-
munity and should be sufficient
to pay for good housing, said
Betty J. McClure, director of
the Rockbridge Area Social Ser-
vice.

For instance, Mrs. McClure
said the housing allowance is
higher for Lexington than for
Buena Vista, but the allowance
in Richmond is higher than that

from

neighboring girls colleges for
disorderly conduct, Huntley ad-
dressed the Interfraternity
Council and _ fraternity
representatives Tuesday night.

Huntley called the occasion a
“special meeting’ and men-
tioned that it has been ‘‘seven or
eight years since I last met with
this group.”’

Explaining the purpose of the
visit, Huntley said, “I come
because I have worries I want
to share with you.”’ His concern
was with the overall deteriora-

tion of fraternities and the ~
fraternity system.

And he posed to the assembl-
ed group, “Do you think frater-
nities have the capability for
self-government?”

Huntley told the students that
the University administration
and community has_ been
“relatively tolerant, over the
years, of youthful exuberance. -
But change has occurred. It is a
problem that is perhaps one you
inherited, but one that you must

Contact Debate
Rescheduled

‘The sudden illness of former
U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy
caused the cancellation of the
Contact debate Wednesday
night between him and William
Rusher.

The debate has been ten-
tatively rescheduled for March
6, Contact member .Tom Wall
said.

McCarthy’s secretary told
Wall that the former senator
was hospitalized with internal
problems, possibly an intestinal

virus or appendicitis.

Wall said that Rusher was
willing to reschedule and said
that he had indicated that ‘‘both
of us are fired up to doit.”

The debate is sponsored by
Contact, the student organiza-
tion that brings nationally
known speakers to W&L.

The topic for the debate is
“Directions for the 80’s’’ and
will include discussion on sub-
jects likely to affect the country
in the next decade.

Mull Buys R.E. Lee Hotel

by Joe Scott

Last Friday, Feb. 9, owner-
ship of Lexington’s Robert E.
Lee Hotel.was transferred to
restaurant owner Clyde Mull
for $190,000.

The deed, registered in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court at 2:45 p.m., gives posses-
sion of everything on the
premises to Mull including all
furniture.

The hotel complex at 30 S.
Main Street. was formerly own-
ed by the Robert E. Lee Corp.
which bought the hotel on
December 15, 1961 for $125,000.

The corporation paid that
amount off in monthly in-
stallments of $920. A remaining
amount of $11,299.69 not yet
paid will be assumed by Mull as
part of the sale. ;

The hotel complex consists of
the hotel itself, a beauty parlor
in the hotel run by Katherine
Hostetter and three stores tron-
ting Main Street which are
Tilson Real Estate, Printers
Ink, and an unoccupied space,
formerly known as the Bamboo
Garden Restaurant. The City
Market, a small grocery store
separate from the complex at 17
N.- Randolph Street is also in-
cluded.

Dance Marathon Plans

Set For

by Dave Murray

If you haven’t thought about
registering for the First Annual
W&L Muscular Dystrophy
Dance Marathon, you’d better.
You don’t know what you'll be
missing.

Entertainment Chairman
Burr Datz has assembleda
wide range of musicians for the
weekend of March 23-24. There
will be something for everyone.

Leading off Friday night at 8
p.m. will be Jimmy Bishop and
Turning Point. Following the
soul band is Lucky Pierre’s
Blues Band.

Jay Blumberg, chairman of
the event, says door prizes will
be given away also (Jack
Daniels and steak dinners).

Inside Evans Dining Hall
there will be free beer and free
food for dancers.

To dance, a person has to
come up with $30 in pledges.
Couples are encouraged, says
Blumberg, but there should be a
large number of single people
involved also.

Those wishing to watch can
come in for a cover charge and
drink 16 ounces of brew for 50
cents. Blumberg hopes this will
offset some of the costs of the
live entertainment.

When Lucky Pierre’s Blues
Band stops playing at 4 a.m.
Saturday, there will be a rest
period. Dancing will begin
again at 6. From 8 to 10 Satur-
day morning WREL will be
broadcasting live from Evans
Dining Hall.

Datz, who gave a benefit
Saturday night that raised over
$200 for MD and for the lacrosse
team’s trip to Florida, may join
The Blue Grass Express for
morning tunes.

Another highlight will be a
free trip for two to Disney
World. The winners will be the
couple raising the most money.

According to Blumberg,
pledges can be taken over the
phone, which will make it easier
for people to secure pledges.
The signature of the sponsor is
not necessary.

The person pledging agrees to
pay a dancer a certain amount
per hour. Dancers do not have

   

wees

to worry about
pledges either.

From 10 to 1 Saturday Big
John Allen’s Jungle Boogie will
keep the dancers going.
Students may remember Big
John as a janitor at. the
freshman dorms in the past
years.

Dancers only dance 45
minutes per hour. The remain-
ing portion of the hour will be
devoted to exhibitions like the
wet-tee-shirt contest which will
be held sometime during the 30-
hour marathon.

Dodge d’Art from Charlot-
tesville will play from 1-4 Satur-
day afternoon. According to
Datz they play a lot of ’60’s
rock-n-roll, covering Beatles
and Animals tunes, among their
repertoire.

From 4 to6 p.m. The King and

I, featuring former W&L stu-

Castro from Charlottesville will
crank out some more rock-n-
roll from 6 to 10 Saturday night,
and Union Pacific is tentatively
set to play to the end of the
marathon at 2 a.m. Sunday.

Those interested in dancing
for Musuclar Dystrophy can
pick up an information packet
at Carole Chappell’s office in
the Student Center. Registra-
tion forms and _ sponsorship
forms are included.

A goal of $5000 has been set.
Blumberg says that he was told
that 80 percent of the money
raised will go to patient service.

The Marathon should be a
memorable time for all involv-
ed in addition to being a very
worthwhile charity.

Brown’s Taming kills Shakespeare’s spirit

by Parker Potter

As my high school English
teacher Sara Pfaff used to say,
“All great books were written
this morning.” Indeed, a great
work of literature wears its age
well; its central issues should
seem as vital today as they did
the day it was written. .

Many directors have atte ted

to ensure that their rendition of -

Shakespeare has that ‘‘written
this morning’’ feel by dressing a
play up to fit the times. While
this technique can be suc-
cessful, it is a way fraught with
pitfalls (witness last year’s
mutilation of As You Like It at
the hands of the National
Sheakespeare Co any).

Often the best modernization
is a radical retooling of a story a
la Romeo and Juliet a.k.a West
Side Story. Realize, as well,
that many of Shakespeare’s
own plays were reworkings of
older stories...

En tout cas the matter at
hand is Hunt Brown’s senior
thesis production of Taming of
the Shrew. I am afraid that
Brown’s noble attempt to bring
Shakespeare to Washington and
Lee must be counted as another
sacrifice (if well intended) to
the Great God Modern Dress.

Where Brown’s Taming is
perhaps vitalized by modern
garb and some almost inspired
low humor, it fails to tap the
real comic vein in Shakespeare,
the language of the play. It is a
rare character in Brown’s Tam-
ing who feels at ease with the
words of Shakespeare on his
lips. :

The central problem with the
production was telegraphed by
the initial dialogue between
Lucentio (Doug Veasy) and
Tranio (J. Mark Turner). Each
managed to get too carried

away with the flow of the lines .

to pay any attention to in-
dividual words or phrases. ..
A pleasant change of pace
was Bill Rough’s Baptista.
Rough was at ease enough
speaking Shakespeare’s lines to
actually interpret and not recite
them. Further, his ease with the
language allowed him to in-
tegrate thought, word and
gesture. The result was the type
of supple, vital performance
that Shakespeare deserves even
after 350 years. ‘
Both Maria Soltus and Pepper
Tharp as Baptista’s daughters
Kate and Bianca score partial
successes. Miss Tharp seasons
Bianca’s sweetness at the
beginning, with enough in-

 

   
  

   

sincerety that her emergence
as the real shrew at the end is
believable. As are many of her
fellow actors, though, Tharp is
buffaloed by the Elizabethan
diction.

Maria Soltus’ Kate is in many
ways a delight. Her physical

sense of the shrewish, then
spirited, but tame Kate is ex-

Kate Petruchio and Baptista, a

traordinary. Her eyes always
sparkle, the gestures and
nuances are always on target. If
only she could speak the lines as
well as she can look them.
Larry Loveridge’s Hortensio
was an admirable effort.
Loveridge like Rough, let the
language (not the rhythm of the
language) speak for itself. By

   

mong others, prepare for the highly visual banquet scene which

mitigates, in small part, the disappointment of Taming of the Shrew.

Entertainment

letting the language be master,
Loveridge seemed in control of
what he was saying. (Let us not
forget that Sheakspeare is the
genius in question here...)

In attempting to age himself,
Bill Fishback played a well-
nigh unintelligible Gremio.
Many of his speeches were
swallowed up by the voice he af-

   

photo by David Favrot

 

fected to portray his age.

Stan Nolan’s difficulties as
Petruchio are emblematic of
those so endemic to the whole
production. For all his vigor,
Nolan wasn’t able to make his
own the language. of
Shakespeare. Especially ag-
gravating were those instances
where his enunciation became
exageratedly crisp for no
understandable reason.

Among the _ assorted
domestics and flunkies (most of
whom seemed to have been
played by Nick Martin and
Louis McCarter), Nick
Dubrowski as Grumio stood out.
Dubrowski was one of the lucky
few in the play who felt at ease
enough to develop an entire
character. His combination of
clowning and cutting insight
embody the Elizabethan know-
ing fool.

As far as McCarter and Mar-
tin go, their weaknesses and/or
excesses describe well the
essential dilemma of the play.
Whatever he played, McCarter
carried on in a too similar
rolicking swish. Martin, though
sincere as he always seemed,
just didn’t project.

The play was funny enough in
places, in a frantic way. The
mob scene of footmen at
Petruchio’s house or Mc-
Carter’s swish or a bit of
Fishback’s often tiresome

King of the Gypsies: An exotic dog

 

by Dick Barron
Instead of giving us a unique

sinsight into the world of the
-momadic tribes of gypsies, as

one might expect, King of the
Gypsies shows us somebody’s
poverty stricken version of The
Godfather.

The elements of a great story
— power struggles between
families, marriage partners
chosen for children by op-
portunist parents, and renegade
offspring, ready to leave tradi-
tion behind— are there in abun-
dance. Al Pacino made a name
for himself in the hugely suc-
cessful and_ beautifully
rendered Godfather series as
the young man who didn’t need
the trappings of a family
power— who wanted to make
his own way in life, free of ar-
chaic customs and the conflicts
involved.

But like Eric Roberts in Gyp-

sies Pacino was unable to
escape the grip of the family.
The films of the Godfather
series were at once heavy and
crisp, morose and triumphant.
This was due, in large measure,
to their superbly talented sup-
porting casts and director Fran-
cis Ford Coppola’s ability to
mold everything into powerful
art.
We’re not so lucky with King
of the Gypsies, a film of high
aspirations which falls flat. A

him. :

Graphic prints by Turner
McGehee opened last Friday to
a well attended reception and to
the delight of the Washington
and Lee Art community. This
show is quite unusual in that on-
ly infrequently does a recent
graduate receive the honor of a
showing in duPont Gallery. Mr.
Ju of the Art Department ex-
plained this event by saying
that it is rare that a student is
willing to devote the time and
dedication to mastering an art
as Turner has.

The show consists mainly of
silkscreen prints made in the
last 2 and a half years with
some recent etchings and
lithographs. Many of his pieces
feature scenes from the W&L
and VMI area while his newer
pieces focus on images and ob-
jects not geographically confin-
ed

His silkscreens will be a
welcome relief to anyone who

  

has attended many recent create the

silkscreen shows because the
vast majority of his works are
either handcut stencils or hand-
cuts combined with resists, as
opposed the photo stencils from
artists such as Andy Warhol
which are presently dominating
the field. Resists consist of

- making a stencil on the silk with

a brush or other means allowing
the artist to create a rough and
free or textured effect. This can
be clearly seen in either
‘‘Seediess’’ or ‘‘Night Sky’, in
Turner’s show.

Being a printer myself I am
particularly impressed by the
variety of techniques Turner
employs and the skill with
which they are applied. His col-
or selection and application is
far above the average
undergraduate level and should
be considered one of his strong
points. He succeeds in blending
pastel colors to produce a very
harmonic effect while at the
same time allowing them to

One-act “works in progress”

by R.B. Ramirez

This Thursday and Friday
evenings, in the Boiler Room
Theatre, the University Theatre
will produce two ‘‘works-in-
progress,” Dirty Linen by Tom
Stoppard, and The Ghost Sonata
by J.A. Strindberg. These
plays, both somewhat longer
than one-act in length, are being
presented as projects in the
directing class. Rich Allen and
David Sorrells will direct.

Dirty Linen, a recent offering
from the man who brought us
The Real Inspector Hound,
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
and, more recently, Travesties,
is a Satirical portrait of
hypocrisy, moral perversion
and corruption in high places.
The plot, which concerns (if I
reme er correctly) a group of
MPs meeting in the clock tower
at the House of Parliament
(chez Big Ben), is full of Stop-
pard’s sophisticated humor. We
are confronted with a set of

From She Bookstore

this week brought back vivid memories of the
turbulent Vietnam War years when students
across the country plunged into political ac-
tivism.

And at Washington and Lee:

Silent vigils in front of the dining hall at lunch
hour...Petitions, protest posters and banners
everywhere...large contingents off to
Washington for the huge mass demonstra-
tions...a dozen W&L students training as Mar-
shalls there...Cambodia and Kent State brining
eruptions across the nation...coming to work in
the Bookstore at 8:30 a.m. to see a couple of hun-
dred students meeting on the grass in front of
Lee Chapel...Rumors of plans to blow up
buildings, especially the ROTC.,.Student pro-
testors wrapped in blankets against the early
morning chill patroling the campus all night to
protect the buildings...Large mass meetings in
the Cockpit long into the night...the quiet poise
of student body president, Swede Henberg, who

got no sleep for several days...the bright beauty
of the spring days contrasting with the electric
tension of antagonism towards the faculty and
administration who held to the determination not
to close the University...My personal statement
— over and over — “don't oppose violence with
violence”...the growing feeling that, in fighting
the administration here, the students were begin-
ning to forget about Cambodia and Kent
State...the compromise whereby students were
allowed to take “incompletes” in their courses,
only to discover the next fall how hard it was to
make up the credits...the demonstration in Court
House Square against the mining of Haiphone
Harbor, marching through town to the back cam-
pus, past Lee Chapel where the president of
General Motors Corp. was speaking... There was
an excitement and vitality (their very lives were
at stake) which, however however chaotic and
confused it was, still lingers in memory with a
poignant flavor.

parliamentary reprobates, all
intent on putting the finger on
their colleagues and avoiding it
themselves. Only one seems to
be above reproach, and, as we
might have suspected, in the
end he turns out to be the most
reprehensible — or — let’s be
charitable — the most human of
.

The Strindberg play, Ghost
Sonata, deals also with the
theme of facades, but here the
tone is thoughtful and
serious.Ghost Sonata, an ex-
pressionistic drama in three
scenes, comes from the last
period of Strindberg’s life, 1907,

at a time when the author was
breaking away from his ‘‘mid-
dle’ period of naturalistic
writing, to the role of an ad-
vance man for the expres-
sionistic movement. Without
giving away the plot, we could
say that the play treats the
disturbing paradox of truth and
falsehood: which is more
destrictuve? The play really is
a sort of sonata, for it is written
in three scenes, an accummula-
tion of differing states of mind
in a day in the life of a student

A Taming too tame

 

(continued from page 4)

Gremio were sufficient to pro-
voke laughter, but not enough to
sustain comedy.

Word play lost

The true comic aspects of the
play, Sheakespeare’s sparkling
wordplay and the manner of
Kate’s taming lost. Taming
calls for laughter, but the real
laughter, that which is recalled
after the performance, is
engendered by a’. reflection
which Brown’s production
doesn’t know how to ask us to
do.

Brown’s choice of modern

dress may be at the base of the
play’s inability to communicate
on that deeper level. To attempt
to modernize the play is to bring
yet another pressure to an
already difficult project. Had
the play been allowed to wear
caps, doublets and silk stock-
ings, perhaps the players could
have, through immersion in the
play itself, been inspired rather
than befuddled by the language
of Shakespeare.

‘, No easy task

Let it be known that Brown’s
was no easy task. Any director

Nick Dubrowski, Stan Nolan, and Maria Soltus appear in a scene from Hunt Brown’s Taming as Grumio,

Petruchio, and Kate.

and beautiful girl (Laura
Tilley).

In the end, the girl dies, and
the audience is left to ponder, as
much as the young man, the
strangeness of a universe which
so equitably punishes extremes
both of falsehood and of truth.
The Ghost Sonata is, Sorrells
concedes, a difficult play, both
to see and to direct: in fact, this
difficulty had a great deal to do
with his decision to do the play.
“I wanted to make people
think; that’s what I’m after. It’s
a learning experience, that’s all
it’s meant to be. It certainly has
been for me.”

The two plays will be per-
formed this Thursday and Fri-
day only, in the Boiler Room
Theatre, at 8:30 in the evenings.
No reservations are necessary,
and the admission is free. All
are invited to an evening of
stimulating and worthwhile
theatre.

Tenants

te Neer ene

by David Greer

Unless you are a_ very
dedicated hunter, you probably
won’t like killing rats in your
kitchen.

Unless you are training in
your spare time to be a painter,
you probably won’t like having
to repaint the house you are ren-
ting, using your own money.

And unless you are used to liv-
ing in an igloo, you probably
won't like having no heat in
your bathroons or kitchen.

Seldon Clarke and his two
roommates, all Washington and
Lee students, don’t like it
either.

Clarke has lived in the house
he presently rents for two
school years now and the
landlady has not put any money
into the care of the house.

The main problems are with
heat and water, Clarke said.

“Right now are pipes are
frozen,”’ said Clarke. ‘‘When we
informed the landlady, she said
that we’re supposed to have a
warming trend soon.”

The pipes have been frozen
since Saturday, and so the
residents only get water from
one tap — and that’s cold water.

Clarke said that they also
have an underground water
leak. Last month’s water bill
was $75, and the city water
department says that this mon-
th’s bill is already over $100..A
man from the city could tell that
there was a leak without even
using a flow meter.

Although the landlady was
told about the problem two
weeks ago, no plumber has
shown up to fix the leak. The
landlady said that she would
reimburse the renters for the
water that has leaked out.

“The house is in a_ nice
neighborhood,’ said Clarke.
“But it’s a dump sitting there
like a sore thumb.”’

There are gas space heaters
in each of the bedrooms, but
they have no thermostats. The
heater in the living room does
have a thermostat, Clarke said.

“If the heater is off and you
want to turn it on, all you do is
stomp on the floor. That turns
on the thermostat,’ he said.

All of the faucets leak, he
said, and the toilets have run
constantly since the beginning
of the year.

They have killed two rats in
the kitchen, Clarke said, and
they also have problems with
the mice.

The oven in the kitchen has
never worked.

The rooms sag, and Clarke
says he can see sags in the foun-
dation.

The paint is peeling in the kit-
chen, and four ceiling tiles have
fallen after being soaked by a
leak from upstairs.

The three tenants pay $175 a
month rent and about $50 a
month for gas. The water bill
for this month could be over
$150.

Clarke said that he would
definitely not live there next
year and would not recommend
the place to anybody.

When asked about any
recourse a student could take or
what to look for in a lease,
Clarke said, “‘What can you do? rn
They’ve got you over a barrel.”’

Landlords have problems
too.

To begin with, they are not all
mean and greedy or just out to
make a buck as quickly as
possible.

If a landlord seems a little
callous at times, it may be
because he had a bad ex-
perience with a student tenant
sometime in the past.

What about the student living
in an apartment in the base-
ment of his landlord’s home
who was prompt to pay his rent,
but skipped town without pay-
ing for his electricity, water or
gas during his last three months
in the apartment, forcing the
landlord to foot the bill?

What about the students who
let the drain clog and water run
over the rim of the shower
upstairs—not a lot of water, but
enough to soak through the ceil-
ing and into the landlord’s
apartment below after seven or
eight months?

What about the ‘‘nice, quiet
student who never caused any
problems,” except that he liked
greasy carry-out fried chicken
and was nice enough to leave
behind a paper bag full of bones
in the middle of the landlord’s
newly installed carpet, creating
a nice, big grease stain when he
was gone?

Undergraduates ~ searching
for housing in town may run in-
to a landlord who rents only to
law students. He refuses to rent
to undergraduates.

His adamance is usually the
result of an unpleasant ex-
perience he had with an
undergraduate. tenant years
ago, but the unpleasant
memory of the student’s loud
parties and penchance for
destructive behavior linger long
after the student is gone.

One landlady got very upset
this year when she found out
that her student tenants had not
one but three dogs on her pro-
perty, even though the lease
specified no pets.

She might have survived the
‘‘no pet’’ lease violation if one of
the tenants hadn’t cursed her
and told her what a “‘dump”’ her
house was.

As the story goes, the student
challenged her to throw them
out. So she did.

Other headaches for the
landlord might be:

—the squirrels in the attic
who are building a nest in the
chimney that his tenants have
not told him about because,
well, it isn’t their house and
they weren’t planning to live
there next year.

—too much paper in the toilet
upstairs so that it clogs and
backs up all over the bathroom
and seeps into the floor.

—tenants who leave food out,
attracting roaches, but not tell-
ing the owner about the pro-
blem until the pests have begun
to take over the house—possibly
never to be completely exter-
minated.

—the short circuit in the faul-
ty electrical wiring that the
students learn to live with until
it sparks into a small fire and
the landlord loses his house and
his tenants.

Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About

the University’s Student Housing Services

University Owned Housing

by David Greer

While looking for a place to
live in Lexington, students
might want to try some of the
University-owned facilities in
town.

The University rents apart-
ments for 178 students in the
Woods Creek complex. Rooms
cost from $625 to $950 a year,
with options on single and dou-
ble occupancy and suite ar-
rangements.

Baker and Davis dorms hold
37 and 45 students respectively
for $575 a year. All rooms are
single, and Baker dorm houses
only law students.

The two Lee Houses hold 33
students together, and cost $525
for a single and $425 for a dou-
ble.

The Davidson Park Apart-
ments, off Nelson Street, com-
monly called ‘‘The Barracks,”’
house married students. There
are 23 units available (two are
condemned and are used for
storage) and cost $100 a month
for a two-bedroom apartment
and $105 a month for a three-
bedroom apartment.

Woods Creek

Some of the residents at
Woods Creek say that there are
often problems with heating
and hot water, but for the most
part, the apartments are not
bad.

Some students have reported
problems with leaking roofs and
others complained of the easy
access that Buildings and
Grounds personnel have to the

apartments. One student found
people living in his apartment
over the summer while he was

' away.

Davidson Park

One couple living in the
Davidson Park Apartments
said that for cheap housing,
their apartment was pretty
nice. They said that it was
large, but that they had to do
some work themselves to make
the place look better.

They said that the walls were
fairly thin and that they had to
put rugs down on the floor to
keep the place warm, but for

the price such improvements .

could be expected. The couple
also said that the University
was quick to fix any problems
they had with the apartment.

An Interview With the
Director of Univ. Services

In an effort to determine ex-
actly what services Washington
and Lee does provide to assist
students in their search for off-
campus housing, the Ring-tum
Phi interviewed William N.
Mohler, director of University
Services, the administrative of-
fice which handles student
housing.

Question: Does the Universi-
ty maintain a current listing of

Althought it might be unfair to compare Washington and Lee with
larger schools, our university housing services do seem to trail
behind those at other institutions.

Our University Services office does offer a listing of available ac-
commodations, but they are far from current.

The office also does not really have a telephone for students. The
only accessible phone is in the lobby of Washington Hall.

Finally, University Services lacks a list of rental furniture stores.
However, the official word is to ‘‘check Buena Vista.or Roanoke.”

Understanding a Lease and What It Covers

by Bob Shurack

A lease, strictly speaking, is not a con-
tract, but is a conveyance of an interest in
land, like a deed.

To illustrate this point, look at the sam-
ple lease that is printed on page ---. If that
lease ended at line 12, it would be purely a
conveyance of real estate, with no contrac-
tual element at all. And, as such, it would
be a perfectly valid lease.

According to the law of real property,
the tenant would be legally entitled to
possession of the leased premises for the
Stated term, (although the landlord would
be under no duty to put the tenant in actual
possession by ousting persons wrongfully
occupying the premises), and the landlord
would have the right to the payment of the
full amount of the rent at the end of the
term.

Other than the duty not to evict the. te-
nant or disturb his quiet enjoyment of the
premises, the landlord would have no fur-
ther obligation to the tenant.

If the apartment was in such poor condi-
tion as to uninhabitable, that would be no
concern of the landlord. The tenant would
still be obligated to pay the rent.

This is not surprising if one realizes the
nature of a lease as a conveyance.

The tenant becomes the temporary
owner of the demised premises for the
duration of the term of the lease — he owns
a leasehold — and only he can be liable for
the condition and maintenance of his own
property.

Just as one selling a house or a farm is
not responsible to the buyer for its bad con-
dition at the time of purchase or its upkeep
afterwards, the landlord, as a seller of a
leasehold, has no responsibility for the
condition or maintenance of the property

By the year 1500, all of this was pretty
clear.

By that time, the tenant’s interest had
been elevated to that of an interest in land
— an estate in land — real estate, if you
will.

Landlords and tenants began to insert in
their leases special promises called
covenants. These covenants imposed
duties upon the parties that made them.

- ae : as © @
Ps a t
* be Ey.

 

 

In the sample lease, all of the numbered
paragraphs are covenants. These are the
contractual provisions of the lease. If a
party broke his promise or covenant, the
other party could sue him for breach of
covenant.

But even though one of the parties was
breaching his covenants, that did not
relieve the other party from his duty to
abide by his own covenants.

Thus, if the landlord covenanted to
repair the roof when it leaked, and the te-
nant covenanted to pay $100 a year rent, if
the landlord did not repair the roof, the te-
nant was still bound to perform his cove-

    

nant to pay rent. But, of course, the tenant
could still sue the landlord for breach of his
covenant.

In 1500, that was good contract law.

By about 1600, however, the law of con-
tracts had developed the concept of the
mutual dependence of material promises.
In other words, if Smith agreed to paint
Jones’ house for $100, and Smith did not
paint the house, Jones did not have to pay
the $100.

Unfortunately, this development came
too late to be adopted into the real property
law governing the landlord and tenant
relationship, which had been settled one
hundred years earlier. To this day, lease
covenants remain independent, unless
their dependency is expressly provided

for.

By the use of lease covenants, (contrac-
tual provisions in a lease), the landlord
and tenant may establish duties in addition
to or, with respect to the tenant, in
variance of those very few duties that pro-
perty law will otherwise imply in every
lease.

Property law holds that it is the duty of
the landlord to give the tenant the legal
right to possession and not to evict him or
disturb his quiet enjoyment of the proper-
ty.

These minimal obligations of the
landlord are fundamental to the granting
of a leasehold, and cannot be abrogated or
lessened by express covenant in the lease.

But the landlord may, by express cove-
nant, take on additional duties to the te-
nant.

Property law holds that it is the duty of
the tenant to pay rent and not to commit
waste upon the leased property. The te-
nant’s duty not to commit waste means
that he must maintain the property in as
good condition or better as it was at the
time that the tenant became legally entitl-
ed to possession, ordinary war and tear ex-
cepted.

Not only must the tenant refrain from
committing affirmative acts of waste,
such as ripping up the garden or defacing
the walls, but it is his obligation to make
repairs if necessary to prevent consequen-
tial damage.

Thus, if the roof begins to leak, though
from no fault of the tenant, the tenant must
repair it anyway, at his expense, if to allow
the roof to leak would cause damage to
other parts of the house.

This duty to repair, implicit in the te-
nant’s duty not to commit permissive
waste, may be varied by express cove-
nant. In facet, the duty to repair may be
wholly shifted to the landlord.

In modern urban and suburban living, it
is necessary to prescribe many duties
respecting the reair, upkeep and general
livability of dwellings. By means of lease
covenants, these necessary duties may be
fairly apportioned between the landlord
and the tenant.

The sample lease on page --- provides, in
the case of the letting of an apartment, a
fair and reasonable apportionment of
these duties between the parties.

It should be noted that a written lease is

 

not necessary to create the landlord-tenant
relationship.

An oral lease for a term not exceeding
one year is valid and enforceable.

For example, if it was understood bet-
ween you and your landlord that you were
to rent your apartment for the school year,
he could not force you to leave at any time
before the year was up, even though there
was no written lease.

The landlord may claim, however, that
the lease was not for a one-year term, but
was on a monthly basis (technically known
as a month-to-month tenancy). If such
were the case, the landlord could evict the
tenant upon one month’s notice.

But if the landlord brings a law suit
against the tenant for ejectment, the te-
nant may prove the term of the lease by
producing the landlord’s rent receipts.

Since these may not show what the ac-
tual term of the lease was, the tenant
should create his own evidence of the lease
term by inserting a notation on his rent
checks. For instance, the tenant might
write in the lawer left-hand corner on his
first rent check, ‘Lease: Installment Pay-
ment 1 of 12.”

If the landlord accepted checks with
such memoranda written on them, that
should qualify as evidence of the term of
the lease.

Another way to prove the making of, as
well as the term of an oral or written lease
that has been lost or destroyed is by pro-
ducing a writing, no matter how informal,
which includes the terms of a lease that the
parties have agreed upon.

For example, if you give your landlord a
security depoit and he writes on a scrap of
payment, ‘March 1, 1979, received of
Stanley Student, $100 security for apart-
ment for next school year, (signed) Larry
Landlord,’ and he gives the scrap of paper
to you, this should suffice to provie that a
lease was made for the term of the next
school year.

In the sample lease, there is no mention
of the landlord’s remedies in case the te-
nant does not pay the rent. This is because
the law provides the landlord with a
powerful arsenal of remidies which he
may use against the delinquent tenant.

These remedies are available to the
landlord even though the lease does not
mention them.

For example, if the tenant does not pay
the rent, he may come home one afternoon
to find that the landlord has distrained
(seized and taken away) his stereo and col-
or TV, which he may lawfully do if he
believes that the rent is justly due.

But if the tenant has been able to obtain
a favorable lease, he will have some pro-

tection against a landlord who insists upon

   

 

full payment of rent even though he has not
lived up to his own obligations in the lease.

First, because the landlord knows his
obligations, if he has not met them, he will
be less inclined to invoke the judicial
remedies of distraint, ejectment, or suit
for the rent, because there is a danger of
encountering the tenant’s valid defenses to
any such action.

Second, if the landlord does take legal
action, the tenant may successfully defend
and himself recover damages or obtain
other form of relief.

Since 1974 in Virginia, the lease itself has
been of much less importance in
establishing the rights and obligations of
the landlord and tenant.

This is because in that year, the Virginia
legislature enacted a new, comprehensive
law that governs the landlord and tenant
relationship (the Virginia Residential
Landlord and Tenant Act).

With certain exceptions, this law applies
to the landlord and the tenant regardless of
any conflicting provisions in the lease.

However, and this is important, the law
does not apply at all to leased property
that is occupied as a one-family house. For
example, if five students together rent a
house, the law does not apply and the pro-
visions of their lease will be of paramount
importance.

But if a house is divided up into two or
more apartments, the law does apply.

There is a further complication in that if
the landlord rents 10 or more one-family
houses or, regardless of how many one- .
family houses he rents, if he is not a
natural person, i.e., a corporation, the law
is applicable.

Also exempted from the operation of the
law is housing provided by a college or
university.

Under the Virginia Residential Landlord
and Tenant Act, the landlord may not take
from the tenant as security an amount

THIS LEASE made this 7 day of , 1979,
between , residing at
Street, , hereinafter called the
Landlord and , residing at
Street, , hereinafter called the
Tenant,

WITNESSETH: that the Landlord does hereby let and demise to the Tenant the apartment known as Apart-
ment No. on the floorin the building located at Street, City of Lexington,
for the term of years, commencing on the___day of _. , 1979, at an annual rental
of Dollars, payable in equal monthly installments in advance on or before the___ day of each
month of said term.

For purposes of this lease, the word “‘shall”’ is always mandatory and not merely directory.
The parties hereto covenant as follows:

FIRST: The. Landlord has good title to the demised premises and has the unrestricted right to grant a
leasehold in them.

SECOND: The Landlord, as of the first day of the term, shall place the Tenant in actual possession of the

governments, departments, commissions, boards and officers, which may be applicable to the demised
premises and to the sidewalks, alleyways, passageways, curbs and vaults adjoining the same or to the use or
manner of use of the demised premises or the owners, tenants or occupants thereof. The obligations of the
Landlord under this paragraph shall survive the Tenant’s acceptance of the demised premises.

SIXTH: Landlord shall deliver the premises, including every part of the structure thereof and all fixtures,
equipment, and appurtenances therein, in a safe, dry, clean, and tenantable condition and in good and safe
order and repair and shall, at his expense, in order to maintain the same in such condition, make all necessary
repairs, replacements, improvements, and alterations.

SEVENTH: The tenant shall take good care of the demised premises and fixtures and equipment therein
and shall make, as and when needed, as a result op misuse or neglect by the Tenant, all repairs in and about
the demised premises necessary to preserve them in good order and condition, which repairs shall be equal in
quality and class to the original work. However, the Landlord may repair, at the expense of the Tenant, all
damage or injury to the demised premises, or to the building of which the same form a part, or to its fixtures or
equipment, done by the Tenant or the Tenant’s servants, employees, agents, visitors or licensees, or caused by
moving property of the Tenant in or out of the building, due to carelessness, negligence, or improper conduct
of the Tenant, or the Tenant’s servants, employees, agents, visitors or licensees. If the necessity for a repair is

occasioned by fire or some other cause which is include: in insurance maintained by or on behalf of the |

Landlord, the Tenant shall not be called upon fully to pay for this repair, whether or not the reapir is included
among those which the Tenant has covenanted to make. The Landlord shall make the repair in question and
credit the Tenant, after completing such work, with the net proceeds of insurance. . )

EIGHTH: If the Tenant notifies the Landlord of any condition which the Landlord has an obligation to rectify
under this lease, upon the failure of the Landlord within 20 days to rectify the condition, the Tenant may cause
all repairs, replacements, maintenance, alterations, or improvements necessary to rectify the condition to be
made or done himself and may deduct his costs for such work from any installment or installments of rent that
may be due or that may become due. Notice shall conclusively be deemed served upon the Landlord if in
writing and perssonally delivered to the Landlord or sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the
Landlord at the place above designated for the payment of rent.

NINTH: Tenant’s obligations to pay rent shall cease in the event of fire, flood, or the appearance of an defect
in or occurrence of any failure of any part, structure, or fixture of or the interruption of any essential service to
the demised premises, not wrongfully caused by the Tenant, which renders the premises untenantable.

TENTH: The Tenant shall comply with: all laws, ordinances and governmental regulations applicable to the

premises and shall not do or permit to be done in the demised premises anything which shall increase the rate
of fire insurance on the building. If, as a result of a breach of this covenant, the fire rates are increased, the ad-

ditional premium shall be considered additional rent and be paid with the next installment of rent.

ELEVENTH: The Tenant shall conform to the rules and regulations attached hereto and made a part hereof
and shall conform to such other and further reasonable rules and regulations as the Landlord may from time
to time adopt. The Landlord shall not be liable for the breach of the said rules and regulations by any other
Tenants.

TWELFTH: The Landlord shall be liable for compliance with any order or request by any municipal, coun-
ty, state, or deferal official based on any public housing or building code, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, or
requirement.

This lease was prepared by
Bob Shurack, a thirdyear law
student at Washington and Lee
University and legal research
assistant for the Ring-tum Phi.

Of concern to lawyers only,
this provision ensures that a
court construing the lease will
interpret the covenants of the
parties that they shall do
something as meaning that they

must do that thing, and not
merely that they propose to do
it, or that they ought to doit.

This provision effectively in-
corporates into the lease the
Lexington city housing code.

Thus, the landlord who enters
into this lease owes a personal
duty to the tenant to comply
with the city code, and not
merely a duty to the city.

This, in effect, enables the te-
nant to privately enforce the ci-
ty code. He need not rely on the
city inspectors; rather, he can
himself take the landlord to
court if he violates any provi-
sion of the code.

_ This provision creates the

. basic duty of the landlord to

deliver the property in good
condition and to make repairs
as needed to keep it that way.

The precise wording is impor-
tant because every contingency
must be provided for.

For example, ‘repairs’ does
not include work which in-
creases the life of the building.
Thus, the replacing of a roof is
not a repair. Nor is a new fur-
nace or new electrical wiring.

This provision provides that
the tenant must take good care
of the property and must repair
any damages that he causes by
his fault.

This gives the tenant the all-
important right to make needed
repairs himself and deduct the
cost from the rent payments, if
the landlord refuses to make the

repairs.

This requires the tenant to
abide by the city housing code.
Under the code, the tenant must
do such things as keep the plum-
bing fixtures he uses clean and
Sanitary and properly dispose
of his garbage.

THIRTEENTH: If the demised premises or any part thereof shall be condemned for public use, this lease is
to be thereupon terminated and the rent shall be apportioned as of the day of the entry of the order of condem-
nation and the Tenant shall not be entitled to any part of the award in condemnation, and the Tenant hereby

waives any right or claim therein.

[OPTIONAL PROVISION] [The Tenant shall be responsible for payment for the following public utilities
furnished for his benefit: ;

SEVENTEENTH: The Landlord reserves the right to possession and control of the demised premises for the
sole purpose of and only to the extent required for compliance with his covenants under this lease. Landlord
shall notify the Tenant of the specific dates and times of day when Landlord intends to exercise this right, at
least 24 hours prior to such times, but the Tenant may consent to shorter notice. Landlord shall not exercise
this right unreasonably or in a manner that causes unnecessary annoyance or inconvenience to the Tenant.

EIGHTEENTH: Except as required to comly with his covenants in this lease, the Landlord shall not, within
the term of this lease, remove anything from or replace anything within, or otherwise alter in any way the
demised premises, its tixtures, equipment, or appurtenances, unless it be with the express written consent of
the Tenant.

NINETEENTH: The Tenant deposits hereby with the Landlord the sum of $ as security for the full and
faithful performance by the Tenant of all the terms and conditions of this lease, which sum shall be returned to
the Tenant at the expiration of the term provided the Tenan! has fully and faithf-lly performed all the terms
and conditions on his part to be performed. If the Landlord willfully fails to return any security required to be
paid to the Tenant, the Tenant may recover such security due him together with reasonable attorney’s fees. In
the event of a bona fide sale of the premises, subject to this lease, the Landlord shall have the right to transfer
the deposit made by the Tenant to the vendee for the benefit of the Tenant.

TWENTIETH: The Tenant, at the termination of this lease, shall surrender the premises to the Landlord in

SUGGESTED RULES AND REGULATIONS

1. The sidewalk, entrance, hall, passages, stairway or fire escapes shall not be obstructed by the tenants or
used by them for.any other purposes than those of ingress to and egress from their apartments.

2. No signs, advertisements or notices shall be painted or affixed upon any part of the building, outside, nor
shall any article be suspended outside the building.

3. No noisy or disorderly conduct or any conduct annoying or disturbing to the occupants of the building in-
cluding the playing of a musical instrument, or the operation of a television set, radio, or phonograph shall be
permitted in the demised premises between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and the following 8:00 a.m.

4. No animal or bird of any kind shall be taken into or kept in or about the premises without the consent of the
Landlord in writing.

5. The halls of the building shall not be used as a playground for children and no bicycle or baby carriage will
be allowed therein.

6. Nothing shall be hung by the Tenant from or placed on the windows, terraces, balconies, fire escapes or
window sills. Nor shall any mops, towels, rugs, etc., be hung or shaken from any window or door.

7. All garbage and refuse shall be disposed of in such manner as Landlord shall designate.

8. The Landlord may retain a passkey to all premises. No local shall be changed without the prior written
consent of the Landlord and a duplicate key delivered to the Landlord.

9. The Landlord reserves the right to make such additional rules from time t0 to time as shall in the opinion
of the Landlord be necessary.

If the state decides to build a
highway through the house the
tenant is living in, the lease will
terminate and the tenant will
get back any prepaid rent that
is applicable to that part of the
term of the lease over which he
will not be able to live in the
house .

If the landlord controls the
furnace and water heater, then
he must supply heat and hot
water in adequate amounts.

But where there are separate
space heaters and hot water
heaters in the tenant’s rooms,
then that equipment must be
capable of supplying adequate
heat and hot water.

Because the landlord has
rather extensive duties to
repair defects and to maintain
the premises, he must be given
a right to possession and control
so that he may carry out his
obligations.

Otherwise, a court might say
that the landlord’s duty to
repair and maintain and unen-
forceable by the tenant. But the
landlord should not be able to
enter the premises at
unreasonable times (i.e. 3 a.m.)
and should give notice to the te-
nant that he intends to enter.

This gives the tenant a right
to recover attorney’s fees if his
landlord wrongfully refuses to
return the security deposit.

This is important because,
without this right, it would nor-
mally cost more to sue the
landlord to recover the deposit
than the amount of the deposit

itself.

This provision ensures that if
the landlord dies, becomes
disabled, senile, or insane, of if
he sells the property, the lease

_ will still be good and the tenant

cannot be forced to leave the
premises.

This means that if one party
does not perform anything in
the lease that he has promised
to perform, the other party need
not perform his obligations in
the lease.

But the failure to perform
must be of a material nature,
and not minor, inconsequential,
or trivial.

For example, if the
landlord does not fix a furnace
when it breaks down, and the
building becomes very cold, the
tenant need not pay the rent un-
til the furnace is fixed. This is
an extreme measure and should
only be resorted to when it ap-
pears very clear that the
landlord is breaching his
material covenants and he can-
not be moved to take the action
that he ought to.

 

This sample lease is recom
mended to student tenants as an
example of a fair and evenhand-
ed document, ensuring many te-
nant rights not normally found
in leases nor covered by].
Virginia law. The student is
cautioned, however, about any
changes that might effectively
eliminate those rights setforth

 

herein.

LEASE

 

(continued from page S-5)
more than twice the monthly rent.

The landlord must, within five days after
the tenant begins to occupy the premises,
give the tenant a written report itemizing
all damages which then exist.

If the tenant does not object to the
report, in writing, within five days after he
receives it, the damage report will be con-
sidered to be correct.

This revort will be the basis for deter-
mining what damage the tenant has caus-
ed during his occupancy of the premises.

If, at the expiration of the lease, the
landlord keeps any part of the security
deposit because of damages for which he
claims the tenant is responsible, the
landlord must give the tenant a written
notice itemizing the damages and their
amount within 45 days after the termina-
tion of the lease and delivery of possession
of the premises to the landlord.

The tenant has a right to be present
when the landlord makes his inspection to
assess damages. To exercise this right, the
tenant must notify the landlord in writing
that he wishes to be present at the inspec-
tion; if the tenant does so, the inspection
must be made within 72 hours after the te-
nant vacates the premises, and the tenant
is entitled to an itemized list of damages as
soon as the inspection is completed.

If the landlord holds the secuirty for
more than 13 months from the date the
lease was made, the landlord must, when
he returns the security to the tenant, in-
clude interest figured at the rate of three
per cent per year, compounded semi- an-
nually.

In the words of the law, the landlord
must ‘‘make all repairs and do whatever is
necessary to put and keep the premises in
a fit and habitable condition.”’

He must “maintain in good and safe
working order and condition all electrical,
plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating,
air conditioning and other facilities and
appliances” that he supplies.

The landlord must supply both hot and
cold running water and ‘“‘reasonable”’ heat
in season unless the tenant has exclusive
control of the heating and water heating
equipment.

The tenant has the duty to exercise due
care in the use of the premises.

Basically, he must keep the area he con-
trols, including all plumbing fixtures,
clean and safe, he must remove garbage
properly, he must abide by the reasonable
rules and regulations of the landlord, and
he must not disturb his neighbors.

Also, he must permit the landlord to
enter the premises for purposes of inspec-
tion and to make repairs, but the landlord
must give notice beforehand and he may
enter only at reasonable times.

If the landlord does not live up to any of
his material obligations in the lease, or
does not comply with the provisions of the

 

law in a way that “materially affects
health or safety,”’ the tenant may give
written notice to the landlord that the lease
will terminate after 30 days if the landlord
does not remedy the defect within 21 days.

But the tenant may not terminate the
lease if he, himself, deliberately or
careflessly caused the conditon complain-
ed of.

Except for the right of the tenant to ter-
minate the lease if the building is
destroyed or severely damaged by fire,
this is the only tenant’s remedy that does
not require the tenant to go to court. If the
tenant invokes this remedy of termination
of the lease, he must move out when the
lease is terminated.

But if the tenant desires to stay, there
are several ways he can force the landlord
to make the necessary repairs or te pro-
vide the required services.

And the tenant may obtain a reduction in
his rent or, in an extreme case, it may
even by forgiven entirely, to reflect the
decreased rental value of the premises.

Also, the tenant has the right to recover
damages from the landlord.

Unfortunately, however, these remedies
require the tenant to go to court; and
unless he is unsually able, he will require
the services of a lawyer. But the tenant

. May recover from the landlord a
} reasonable attorney’s fee if he does take
> the landlord to court and wins.

Since the tenant ordinarily would re-
quire legal assistance to enforce his rights
under the law, not further discussion is in-
cluded here. The tenant should, however,
as soon as he discovers a condition that is
the landlord’s duty to rectify, send the
landlord a letter by certified mail notifying
him of the condition.

This is necessary to preserve the te-

\ nant’s rights under the law and is especial-
ly necessary to prevent the landlord from

 

 

evicting the tenant who does not pay his
rent because of the poor condition of the
premises.

In such a case, if the landlord sues the te-
nant to recover possession of the property,
the tenant, if he has previously sent the re-
quired notice to the landlord, will be able
to defeat the landlord’s action.

The Virginia Residential Landlord and
Tenant Act also obligates the landlord to
comply with local housing codes.

If the landlord does not comply with the
requirements of the local code, the tenant
has the same remedies against the
landlord as he has for breach of lease
covenants and for noncompliance with the
other enumerated provisions of the state
law.

The Lexington city housing code re-
quires the landlord to supply adequate hot
and cold running water to all sinks,
showers, and bathtubs.

The hot water must be heated to at least
120 degrees F

The landlord must either supply the hot
water directly, or he must equip the
premises with the necessary equipment to
supply the required hot water.

The landlord must supply heating
facilities which are properly installed and
maintained in safe and good working order
and which are capable of heating at least
one-half of all habitable rooms to at least
70 degrees F’.

If the landlord controls the heat directly,
he must heat at least one-half of all
habitable rooms to at least 70 degrees F’.

Every habitable room must have at least
one electrical outlet.

The kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms,
laundry room, furnace room, corridors,
hallways, and porches must have at least

 

one ceiling or wall-type light fixture, which
must be maintained in good and safe work-
ing order.

Common hallways and stairways in
apartment buildings containing five or
more apartments must be adequately
lighted at all times.

In apartment buildings containing four
or fewer apartments, such areas must be
provided with conveniently located light
switches controlling an adequate lighting
system, which may be turned on and off as
needed.

The landlord must keep clean and
sanitary all common areas, but the tenant
is responsibile for keeping the areas that
he occupies clean and sanitary.

Also, the tenant is responsible for pro-
perly disposing of all garbage and rubbish,
which means placing it in adequate con-
tainers, presumably - with tight-fitting
covers.

The responsibility for extermination of
insects and rodents rests with the landlord
unless the leased premises are occupied as
one-family house, in which case it is the te-
nant’s or co-tenant’s responsibility

Apart from relying on the state law or
his lease to force the landlord to live up to
his obligations, the tenant may register
complaints with the city health inspector
that the landlord is violating the city hous-
ing code.

But it must be understood that although
the housing code imposes on the landlord
the duty to repair and maintain the
premises, he owes that obligation to the ci-
ty and not to the tenant.

In other words, the tenant cannot en-
force the code on his own. He can only re-
quest that it be enforced; it is up to the city
to deal with the landlord to achieve com-
pliance with the code.

And the landlord often can, by one
means or another, avoid compliance with
the requests and orders of the city inspec-
tor.

Sometimes The Lease May Be Stacked Against You

by Joe Scott

A careful reading of the lease and
close inspection of the premises you
intend to rent are necessary before
you sign on the dotted line.

Usually you will be presented with
a form lease and be given a casual
tour by the landlord. Ask questions
while you tour because the landlord
does not want to waste his time.

With student housing as scarce as
it is, a landlord’s position will be
“take it or leave it, there is always
somebody who needs a place to
live.”’

Translating a lease into plain,
readable English can often be dif-
ficult. Lease clauses are sometimes
printed in no logical order and im-
portant items are buried deep within
a paragraph. You must read the en-
tire document and be aware of what
you are getting into before you sign.

Striking a phrase or clause in the
lease is legal if you and your
landlord agree. The best procedure
would be to cross out the part in
question and have it initialled by you
and your landlord on all copies of the
lease that you will sign.

If you have already signed the
lease without making these ad-
justments, you can still negotiate the
changes but there are no guarantees
that you will succeed.

As a last resort you can take your
case to court.

Lower courts which deal with
these dipsutes usually regard leases
as the final word which puts the

 leasee at a disadvantage.

Legal proceedings are also time
consuming, expensive and regarded
as a nuisance.

When reading a lease, the reader
before signing should look for poten-
tial problems or ‘‘danger spots.”

The following clauses are major
points to look for. In many states
these clauses are illegal. However,

_the official language in a lease
discourages many tenants from ex-
ercising their legal rights if the
clauses are present. Be aware of the
protections you have.

1. The landlord is not liable for

repairs.

An example:

“This lease and the obligation of te-
nant to pay rent hereunder...shall in
nowise be affected, impaired or excus-
ed because landlord is unable to supp-
ly or is delayed in supplying any ser-
vices or repairs, additions, alterations
or decorations.”

This clause is one example of an
“independent covenant’’ still ap-
plicable in renting. It states that the
tenant’s rent obligations is separate
from the landlord’s obligation to pro-
vide a “‘habitable dwelling.”

Technically, it forbids a tenant to
withhold rent if the landlord does not
fulfill his promises. It backs the te-
nant into a corner by making him
sue or bring legal action against the
landlord. This process is long and
cumbersome.

2. You agree to obey all rules,
whether written yet or not.

“The tenant further agrees to pay all
costs, including legals fees and other
charges that may accure in the event
distraint proceedings are instituted
against the tenant, or in the event suit
for rent or dispossess proceedings are
necessary in order to obtain possession
of the premises, or to collect the rent.”

Rules such as pet and noise
restrictions are common but if any
restrictions are violated it can pro-

 

vde a landlord with an excuse to
evict you or withhold the tenant’s
security deposit. Know all restric-
tions and insist on reading them.
Some leases forbid driving nails into
the walls, for example.

If it is necessary to agree to future
rules, the lease should provide an
“arbitration procedure’ to voice
possible tenant complaints if you
find yourself violating new rules.

3. Agreeing to pay more rent.

“Tenant agrees, during the term of
his lease or any renewal thereof that in
the event there shall be an increase in
real-estate taxes, sewer or water
charges during the year ----, or an
assessment charged by the municipali-
ty on the demised premises for any
period following the date of com-
mencement of this lease, tenant shall
pay his proportionate share of said tax
increase, charge or municipal assess-
ment.”

These clauses enable a landlord to
raise the rent if operating expenses,
such as taxes, increase. Leases over
one year usually contain an
automatic rent increase for each
year whether specified-by amount or
percentage. Understanding this rule
can Save money.

4. Landlord access to your home at
any time.

“Landlord or landlord's agents shall
have the right to enter the demised
premises during reasonable hours, to
examine the same, and to show them to
prospective purchasers, lessees, mor-
tgagees or insurance carriers of the
building, and to make such repairs,
alterations, improvements or additions
as Landlord may deem necessary or
desirable. If tenant shall not be per-
sonally present to open and permit an
entry into said premises, at any time,

when for any reason an entry therein
shall be necessary or permissible
hereunder, Landlord or Landlord’s
agents may enter the same, without
rendering Landlord or Landlord’s
agents liable therefore.”

Leases usually vary with respect
to this clause. This example literally
allows your landlord to break into
your apartment when you are not
there and show the house or apart-
ment to a “‘prospective purchaser.”’
Some courts have modified this
clause and have usually restricted
visiting hours to regular business
hours and require a 24-hour notice
unless there is an emergency.
Courts have also determined that
this right of access cannot be used as
tenant harassment. Proving that
harassment exists usually requires
a court case.

5. Landlord liability in the event of
injury or property damage.

Hazard lists are included in most
leases and state that the landlord is
not liable under those conditions.
Usually the list includes “falling
plaster, steam, gas, electricity, water,
rain or snow which may leak from any
part of said building.”

Form leases contain a sjmilar list
but state that the landlord is respon-
sible if "he or she have been
negligent.”

Leases claiming that the landlord
is not liable even if through his own
negligence are hazards themselves.
Some leases state “that the lessor
shall not be liable for any damage or
injury of the lessee” but do not usual-
ly hold up in court.

If damage occurs to personal pro-
perty, collecting compensation will
in most instances require a court
case.

6. All improvements are property of
the landlord.

“The lessee agrees that no altera-
tions, additions or improvements shall
be made in or to the premises without
the consent of the lessor in writing,
under penalty of damages and
forfeiture, and all additions and im-
provements shall be made by the Te-
nant shall belong to the lessor.”

Most leases require landlord con-
sent before alterations are made.
Once improvements are completed
they belong to the landlord, thereby
enhancing the rental value.

These clauses are intended to’
refer to items that if removed would
damage the premises. Even if
removal would not cause damage,
the Jamdlord still has the right to for-
bid their removal.

7. Adsepting the premises as they

   
   
   
   
   

fessee accepts said premises in
sent conditions.” This clause
usually reinforced by
. "Neither party has made any
Jation or promises, except as
herein, or in some further
ed by the party.”

_you sign, make sure that
ars promised are in writing.
mp avoid future problems.

 

# - Different
_ Types of
- Housing

by Bob Willis

Types of rental housing vary
widely. Although the classifica-
tions are loosely defined, hous-
ing types can be subdivided into
apartments, attached houses
and detached houses.

Each form of housing offers
different features and probably
one rental type appeals best to
your individual lifestyle.

An apartment provides you
with the most service and the
least responsibility. Someone
else takes care of the heating,
yardwork, maintenance, and
redecorating. Also, some if not
all, of the utilities may be in-
cluded in the rent payment.

An attached house,
townhouse or duplex differs
from an apartment in basically
two ways. You usually have a
yard and you assume some
responsibilities for the place’s
operation.

The care of the lawn, the
heating, and general repairs
might rest upon your shoulders.
The utilities may or may not be
included in the rent.

A detached house is often
characterized by more home
space, a larger yard and
perhaps a garage. ;

A separate house has more
privacy than in either of the
other housing categories.
However, you assume respon-
sibility for the upkeep of the
home.

You pay for the orcinary ex-
penses involved in running a
home, such as utilities, lawn
maintenance, and snow
removal, in addition to your
rent.

Some Notes On The Housing Situation

Contrary to popular belief, some
students do not live in dilapidated
houses in the country by choice.
More than a few were forced to live
outside of town because they did not
know that to find housing for
September, you have to start looking
seven months before that.

Some landlords in town survive
very well by relying on word-of-
mouth to advertise the availability
of their apartments. But what if you
are not one of the lucky students who
just happens to be connected to the
housing pipelinev

Even now, in the middle of
February, the great student housing
race in Lexington has been rolling
for a few months now, although it is
just about to begin in earnest.

The winners will take the housing
they desire with their knowledge and
experience of the housing race. The
losers will have to take what they
can get, and be satisfied with it.
Housing in town for students is ex-
panding, but not fast enough to
become truly competitive. Few
landlords will have an empty house
or apartment because no student
was willing to pay their exhorbitant
rental rates.

After a broad investigation of the
student housing situation in Lex-
ington, we must conclude that
Washington ard Lee students are at
a severe disadvantage in this town.
Often they do not know their rights
as tenants. Students also pay the
highest rental rates in the area.
Well, after all, they can usually af-
ford it. But they should at least be
getting their money’s worth.

This special section of the Ring-
tum Phiis an attempt to provide
some of the.information necessary

to give students a fighting chance in
Lexington’s student housing game.
The stakes are high. A lot of money
is involved in student housing, which
can be a very profitable business. It
seems only fair that if students can-
not be on an equal footing with their
landlords legally, they should at
least be aware of the problems and
pitfalls in rental housing.

We have also examined the ser-
vices this University provides
students looking for housing and
found them lacking, very lacking.
But there is hope. All the University
officials we spoke with were en-
couraging and anxious to do more to
help students in their search for ade-
quate off-campus housing. ~

The students who require off-
campus housing are no small group.
In fact, they comprise over a majori-
ty of Washington and Lee’s student
body. At most, the University can
house 691 students (including
freshmen), if all dormatories and
double rooms are filled. But there
are 1,742 students at W&L (including
law students), which means that
over 1,000 students must fend for
themselves in finding a place to live
each year. Fraternities reduce that
number somewhat, to be sure. But
by our estimates, 55-60 percent of the
student body must scramble to ar-
range housing for the next academic
year.

Our concern lies primarily with
those freshmen and sophomores who
are not experienced enough in Lex-
ington’s student housing game to
know that one has to look for next
September’s housing right now. We
are also concerned about the
students who are not who are not
lucky enough to know an_ up-

 

 

perclassman who can pass his house
down to them. There are too many
other things to worry about in col-
lege without having to be concerned
with locating next year’s living
quarters seven months ahead of
time.

can to help students with leases,
utilities, and information about their
rights and obligations as tenants.
What is need now is for a list to be
compiled of housing for students in
Lexington and Rockbridge County.
Hopefully, progress will be made in
that direction in the near future.

Until then, though, present tenants
should warn those who will inherit
their housing next year of the pro-
blems that they encountered with
that house or apartment so that the
students down the line, at least, can
have a chance to upgrade their liv-
ing conditions.

If students insist that their rights
be guaranteed and that repairs be
made before they sign their lease,
then, maybe, we will all get a better
housing deal in this town.

Enforcing Housing Standards

by Joe Scott

Health Inspector Charles Wisecarver en-
forces the miminum housing standards or-
dinance for Lexington and handles tenant
complaints for substandard living conditions.

Previously, enforcement of the ordinance
was the responsibility of Lexington’s building
inspector, but on Oct. 1, 1977, the city council
gave the job to the local health department.
Wisecarver stated that at the time there was
a ‘considerable backlog of cases.”’

‘“‘My primary duty is to the county,” said
Wisecarver. ‘‘I have to work on local housing
when I have time. We have worked off most of
the complaints.”’

The Procedure

The procedure for registering a housing
complaint starts with a phone call to the
health department. If the tenant feels there
are violations of the housing code, then a visit
from Wisecarver is the next stop.

A list of all complaints and possible viola-
tions should be written by the tenant before
the health inspector arrives. Details of each
individual problem are helpful.

Examples of the problems such as roaches,
which emerge mainly at night, are critical in
order to confirm all violations.

Using the minimum housing standards or-
dinance as a guide, the inspector tours the
house and records all violations that he finds.

of the property.

Next a 30-day notice is given to the landlord
which requires him to correct all violations
within the given time span.

Landlord Failure

If, for some reason, the landlord or proper-
ty owner fails to correct the violations within
30 days, then a second and final notice of 60
days is issued by the inspector.

Failure to comply with this notice can lead
to a warrant for the arrest of the property
owner.

Special cases such as a landlord’s inability
to correct the problem immediately are left
up to the discretion of the health inspector.

Wisecarver states that a ‘reasonable
amount of time’”’ is then allowed for the pro-
blem to be corrected. This procedure though
is the exception and not the rule.

Out-of-State Landlords

Problems can arise if the property owner
does not live in the state.

The tenant can still complain about the
housing violations, have the house inspected
and, if violations are found, have his com-
plaint formally registered by the health in-
spector.

The health inspector can then issue the 30-
day and 60-day notices. Unfortunately if the
landlord fails to correct the housing viola-
tions, court action becomes difficult.

Wisecarver Discusses His Job As

Lexington’s Housing Watchdog

by Joe Scott

Charles Wisecarver’s job as
health inspector is a com-
plicated task.

Not only must be deal with
written standards applied to
specific cases, but he also must
deal with he people who live in
the dwellings and its owner.

Interpreting what is ‘“‘a
reasonable amount of time”
necessary for the landlord to
make repairs is difficult.

Bringing all housing up to
standards is, in his words,
doubtful.

The job is endless, ‘‘due to
continuous deterioration’ of
housing, he adds. “‘I wish I had
more time but my primary duty
is to the county.”

“I have to deal with the cold

hard facts,” says Wisecarver.

“If there are housing code
violations, I have to report them
and issue a notice.’ He adds
that “‘my concern and duty is to
bring housing up to standard.”

“In most cases, we can work
out something,’’ states
Wisecarver, referring to times
the landlord has to fix code
violations, ‘“‘but if he fails to
repair the dwelling by the ex-
piration of the final 60-day
notice, then I can have a war-
rant served on him. Then we'll
let the judge decide.”

aa reasonable,’’
Wisecarver adds. ‘“‘If the

landlord can show me he is do-

ing everything he can, then I

will abide by his word.”’
Landlords who fail to repair

 

their houses can only have their
house condemned as a last
resort.

If the house is declared
uninhabitable, then all tenants
must leave. The house then can
be torn down.

The law though makes no pro-
visions for the former tenants.
They must fend for themselves.

“We have no control over
landlord eviction of tenants,”
says Wisecarver. ‘‘We are not
at this time forcing any person
to leave their home, though.”’

Court action against the
landlord is “generally light.’’
There are no maximum
penalties unless there are
repeated violations.

“Last year I was feeling my
way around,’’ stated
Wisecarver. ‘‘I will say, though,
that enforcement will be much
more rigid than it has been in
the past. I will put emphasis on
the vacant housing.”’

“In a town the size of Lex-
ington, I doubt if I can get all
the houses up to standard. As
long as you have certain
tenants, you are going to have
to continually bring the housing
up to standard,” he added.

“‘T see in the next five years
several new government sub-

. sidized low income housing pro-

jects going up around town,’:
Wisecarver said. ‘Until then,
we’ll just have to wait and see
what happens.”’

Unfortunately there is cur-
rently a waiting list of at least
one year for low income housing
in Lexington.

Students Who Took Their
Landlord to Court and Won

by Mike Perry

To many students, the idea of
taking your landlord to court
may seem like a drastic means
of resolving tenant-landlord
disputes, but four Washington
and Lee students found that the
legal process provided a swift
solution to their housing pro-
blems.

Last February, Grant
Leister, Holcombe Baird,
Walton Clark and Parker Potter
obtained a lease from their
landlord, Mrs. Gilbert L.
Brown, to rent the four bedroom
house on McCorkle Drive where
they currently live.

When Leister, who lived in the
house last year, insisted upon
repair of the front door,
refrigerator, and back porch
before signing the lease, he
received a verbal assurance
from the landlord that the
repairs would be made.

Repairs Not Done

Upon their return to Lex-
ington in September, the four
realized that the landlord had
made some repairs, but had
neglected the refrigerator, back
porch, and front door. Leister
says the landlord answered
their complaints with
assurances that ‘she would get
them done as soon as she
could.”’

The four then heard of a
group of W&L students who
were withholding rent from
their landlord until certain
repairs were made.

With no intention of going to
court, the four students sent
Mrs. Brown a letter informing

her that they would withhold

their monthly rent until the pro-
mised repairs were completed.

When the four returned
following Thanksgiving break
they learned that their student
neighbors had been evicted for
nonpayment of rent. Leister
states that the four decided to
go to court ‘‘to protect ourselves
from eviction.” q

What the Law Provides

Grant Leister went to the
Legal Aid Society at the Law
School, studied the Virginia
Residential Landlord and Tenant
Act and “‘determined “that we
had legitimate complaints
under the law.”

Anyone contemplating any
legal action against a landlord
should study the law very
carefully because it contains
ten situations in which
landlords are exempt from the
law. These exemptions include
occupancy by a fraternity and
occupancy in single family
residences where the owners do
not own more than ten single-
family residences subject to a
rental agreement.

Leister also points out that
the legal process is complicated
and it took them three attempts
“to correctly file the papers.”

On Dec. 1, 1978, the four filed
for an “escrow account,”’
whereby, as Holcombe Baird
explains, ‘trent money is paid to
the court and withheld from the
landlord until repairs are com-
pleted.”

They filed the required
documents and their landlord,
Mrs. Brown, was served with
papers requiring her to answer
the charges in court.

In Court

The case came to court on
Dec. 13, 1978 as Leister argued
the case for the four students.
Mrs. Brown retained a local
lawyer.

Leister argued that the
landlord ‘doesn’t do proper
maintenance,’ while -Mrs.
Brown’s lawyer maintained
that the repairs in question
were cosmetic in nature related
the problems faced by a
landlord when she rents to
students.

Leister says that the judge
remarked that Mrs. Brown
should be made to act respon-
sibly with her dealings with ren-
tors and decided to hold $50 of
the rent money while he resolv-
ed a technical point determin-
ing whether or not Mrs. Brown
was exempt from the law.

The students found to judge to
be an asset. As Walton Clark
reflects, ‘‘He asked some really
good questions of her on our
behalf.”’ :

New Lease

Clark thinks that relations
with their landlord are good at
present, but adds that she has
stated that will have an appen-
dage attached to all her leases
releasing her from liability for
repairs ‘‘as a result of our tak-
ing her to court.”’

Clark recommends that any
potential rentor “‘have any pro-
mised repairs attached to the
lease.”

The students also recommend
that anyone contemplating
legal action against a landlord
carefully examine the Virginia
Residential Tenant and Landlord
Act.

rather heavily for that.

‘ But I can’t declare that
we’re going to set aside all of
Baker or Davis or another dorm
for those freshmen.

Q: If there is available
University housing, why pay
the money for the R. E. L.
Hotel?

Mohler: Well, I think you
have a good point. It’s a cir-
cumstantial thing. There are no
hard, fast rules for the way it
works.

We have double rooms in the
Lee Houses. It’s hard to sell an
upperclassman a_ double
room—believe me it is...

I frankly think it’s difficult for
any girl to find housing in Lex-
ington. We’ve been male for two

and a quarters centuries and |

these landladies are afraid of
the girls. They spell trouble for
them, they think, I guess, I
don’t know. So we try to provide
for them. I think it’s very dif-
ficult for them. :

In that we're participating in
an exchange program, it seems
to me that we have some obliga-
tion to them. It isn’t spelled out
anywhere, I believe. But I feel
an obligation to them.

I feel an obligation to every
student here. I hope people
understand that.

And we endeavor to be cordial
and help students when they
come’ and I think they’ll bear
that out.

Our secretaries get together
and kick around things and give
bits of information that they
know that isn’t listed.

That’s very informal, don’t
misunderstand me. I wouldn’t
say that’s the most polished
way of doing it. But we seem to
do it most anyway we can to
find a place for everyone.

I guess what I’m trying to tell
you is that many times we have
vacancies within our dor-
matories.

Q: What about legal services,
legal advice?

Mohler: Well, they (students)
come in frequently to me with
questions relating to that.

Q: What do you tell them?

Mohler: I have very little to
tell them. At this time, I’m not
in a position to help them.

I feel the University maybe
should help them. It would be
very difficult to offer help in
these areas.

At one time, I worked a little
harder on this, I guess,
endeavoring to help the student.
But it’s difficult for me to ar-
range and negotiate contracts
with a landlord. That’s between
the two of you. You want to see
the facilities and see if it suf-
fices for your needs. They want
to eyeball you and see what you
look like.

Q: How do you envision your
job, sir? Do you see yourself as
being mostly concerned with
University housing, and then
helping students find outside
housing as a sidelight.

Mohler: I’m concerned with
every aspect of my work here of
which student housing is a part.
I’m here to help.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A question of honor

A very important question now lies before the
students, faculty, administration, and alumni of this
academic institution: Will the Washington and Lee
community allow a convicted felon to graduate and
hold a degree from this University?

Last week, the Ring-tum Phi published a story
detailing a Rockbridge County Circuit Court case in
which two 1978 W & L graduates and a current senior
were all sentenced to five-year jail terms (with four
and one half years suspended) after pleading guilty to
charges that they had sold marijuana to police under-
cover agents. The crime is a felony in the state of
Virginia and the prescribed punishments were duly
distributed by the court of law.

The W&L community must now pass judgment on
the senior involved. Is he a Washington and Lee
“sentleman’’ and was his conduct, found to be
criminal in society’s judgment, “‘honorable’’ in the
sense of W & L’s honor code?

The White Book summarizes the honor system in
the following statement: ‘“‘A Washington and Lee stu-
dent is to act honorably at all times; is to be trusted
and assumes the obligation to be trustworthy.”

We now ask the entire University community: Is
there a foundation for the honor system, supposedly
one of the pillars of this University’s integrity and
‘raison d'etre, if a person who has been convicted under
society’s laws is not also exorcised from the W&L
community? If a convicted felon is determined to be
an honorable person, what of the student who merely
cheats on one test? Indeed, is there any basis of honor
or trust in a community that accepts criminals? And
where does our definition of ‘‘honor’’ stop, where do
we draw the limit? Does it only cover those who are

unlucky enough to be caught by outside authorities?

We think it only fitting to close with another selec-
tion from the White Book:

It is important to understand that the system is com-
pletely student-administered and concerned solely
with those. offenses which are considered dishonorable
by the student generation involved.

What is to be this student generation’s definition of

‘“thonorable’’?

Editors respond to lacrosse controversy

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Sir:

Iam amazed that the Executive Committee
voted to fund an NCAA Division I team for a
trip to Florida. I cannot believe that the
representatives are willing to set what can on-
ly be viewed as a most dangerous precedent.

The Basketball Generals are planning a trip
to Europe next year. Surely they are as entitl-
ed to student monies as the lacrosse team? If
not, what can you give Coach Canfield as a
viable reason for refusing him the money?
Remember the lacrosse team got $ 1000! !

A reprehensible precedent has been set. It
is not, in Law representative John Murphy’s
words, a “‘one-time thing.’’ Bill Tucker — can
we stop payment on a check for $1000? !?

ple of the widespread consternation
on campus after the EC’s precedent-
shattering grant of $1,000 to the
lacrosse team. Most of us are reluc-
tant to speak any ill words concern-
ing Coach Emmer’s champions —
one EC member probably summed
up the general consensus (unfair
though it may be ) when he called
lacrosse ‘‘the only real sport at
W&L.”’ And several students with
complaints suddenly became silent
when we suggested they write a let-
ter to the newspaper. “‘Sure I have
objections,” said one, “‘but how can
you cut down the lacrosse team?

It’s like calling for the anti-Christ
while sitting in St. Peter’s.’’

Nobody wants to be a heavy in this
affair. However (bet you knew that
word was due to appear soon), we
see problems even beyond the ques-
tion of precedent. Since the ‘‘de-
emphasis” of athletics in 1954, pur-
suits of the scholar have always
come first. This grant by the EC
seems to endorse replacement of the
“‘scholar-athlete”’ with a subsidized
“‘athlete-scholar.”’

Even more distressing is the un-

. fair position in which the lacrosse

team is being placed by both the
athletic department and the EC.
Funds were gained after a legion of
promises were made by the athletic
department — better performance
in the early season, as well as im-
proved chances in the NCAA tourna-
ment. Should these lofty goals be un-
fulfilled (for whatever reason), the
team will be forced to bear the
blame.

In short, the EC has spent half of
their remaining “‘EC funding” for a
project that will, at best, directly
benefit a small segment of the stu-
dent body...and one that could prove
fruitless, leading to still greater
resentment.

More on McCormick inconvenience

Forever quick to respond to student
displeasure, the W&L administration issued
the following statement — via the News Office
— concerning the obstruction of traffic
around the McCormick renovation project.

Hardly anyone has failed to notice, and
comment on, the fencing-off of most of the
area between the Co-op and Newcomb Hall.
This is necessary so that the contractor may
begin site preparation work on the McCor-
mick renovation project, including installa-
tion of a drainage system and underground
utility services, among other good and useful
things. The fact is that not one square inch
has been blocked off more than he absolutely
needs, however — which is (or will quickly
become) apparent even to the most casual of
our many critical observers.

The point is to allow the entire project to
proceed in the most efficient and economical
way. Every other possibility would either add
substantially to the cost of the project, or sub-
tract from the contractor’s capability of ac-
complishing the whole McCormick project as
quickly as everyone wishes, or both.

For the duration, Mr. Parsons suggests that
students and faculty who wish to get from the
dorms of the gym area onto the Front Campus
choose one or the other of the following alter-
natives:

1. Those who can read and write may wish
to cut through the Bookstore and go out the
Co- op door.

2. Others, including dullards and those who
believe the University’s purpose is to inflict
maximum inconvenience on them personally,
are invited to go between the dorm and the
Bookstore, by the dumpsters.

Swimmers now 2-6
after dunking VMI

by Ed Taylor

This past Saturday the W&L
swimming team split two meets
and now has a 2-6 win-loss
record for the season. Thanks to
some outstanding individual
performances, W&L defeated
VMI 75-39, but lost to Old Domi-
nion 62-50. With only one meet
left in the regular season, Coach
Bill Stearns is now ‘‘tapering”’
his swimmers for post-season
competition.

In Saturday’s meet Chip Hoke
won the 1000 free in 10:09.70,
placing him fourth in the nation
in Division III. Other winners
for W & L included diver Jay
Diesing who was victorious in
both the one and three meter
diving events against VMI and
ODU with scores of 225.85 and
199.65. Also, Keith Romich in
the 200 free (1:47.09), and Bob
Newcomb in the 100 free (49.80)
finished first in both meets. In
addition, the 400 free relay
team, consisting of Newcomb,
Hoke, Herb Gressons and Mike
Bernot, won in a time of 3:23.40.

Asked why the team is having
so much trouble this year when
last year they were one of the
best teams in Division III,
Coach Stearns pointed out that,
obviously, the losses of John
Hudson, a 17-time All-
American, and David Kent, a
holder of three state records,
certainly hurt this year’s squad.
However, Stearns also cited two
other interesting points. First,
before the swimming season
began, many of the swimmers
were on a successful water polo
team. In fact, one week before
the first swim meet, the water
polo team was at the Easterns
competing against some top
Division I teams. Second, many
of the schools that W&L swam
against this year were Division
I teams, which of course, give
scholarships. Therefore, the
won-lost record suffered but the
experience gained from the stiff
competition showed some pro-

 

Swimmers are poised for next race in last Saturday's

Warner Center against VMI.

fit. As a result, the tough
schedule should pay off for the
swimmers in the up-coming
state and national meets.
This Saturday, the swimmers
conclude their dual meet season

Generals romp 84-67;
end up 7-3 in ODAC

by Bill Whalen
The Washington and Lee
Generals ended the 1978-79
home season last Tuesday night
with a convincing 84-67 win over
Eastern Mennonite at the
Warner Center. The Generals,
who now stand at 16-7 overall,
finished with a 10-5 home court
record and also finished with a
7-3 ODAC record, after an 0-3

start in the conference.
Tuesday night’s hero did not
play in the game, however. He

was inside Coach Verne Can-
field’s mind. The real secret to
the Generals’ lastest winning
streak (now at three games) is
Canfield’s arduous practices.
Following the 75-63 loss to
Randolph-Macon on Feb. 3, the
coach has “gone back to the
basic of defense.’’ And the
results have been devastating.
In the last three games, the
scores have been 89-53, 82-72
and Tuesday night’s 84-67.
Tuesday night’s game was a

Grapplers Take Four Meets;
Increase Record To 6-3

As opposed to the previous
troubles the Generals were hav-
ing, the wrestling team now is
enjoying new-found success.

that pushed their dual meet
record to 6-3 and assured the
Generals of their fifth con-
secutive winning season under
Coach Gary Franke. Last
Wednesday the Generals
defeated ODAC member
Hampden-Sydney 36-14 and
Longwood College 42-10. Then
over the weekend the Generals
beat Davidson College on Fri-
day 36-20 and Catawba 33-17 on
Saturday.

The win against Sydney,
which kept the Generals
undefeated in ODAC, was never
really close. Ed Rogers’ 18-1
win at 158 secured the team vic-
tory. At the same time the
Generals were’ wrestling
Longwood and only two grap-
plers lost.

The match against Davidson
was the closest of the four and,
as Coach Franke explained, the
Generals got some ‘breaks.’

“A turning point came when the. .

guy wrestling Hank Wall (126)
was ina position to pin Hank but
instead pinned himself.” As

there were at Davidson, six:

wrestlers for the Generals won
at Catawba. Again Rogers was
the deciding win for the
Generals.

Three Generals were 4-0 last
week. Hank Wall (126), Mike
McFadden (150), and Rogers
(158) were the undefeated
wrestlers.

The last dua! meet for the
Generals was at home Wed.
Feb. 14 against James Madison.
The ODAC tournament is at
Lynchburg Feb. 20. From there
Coach Franke plans to bring
Ray Gross, Mike McFadden,
Ed Rogers, Dave Stoefell, Tom
Oxendine, and Dan Kniffen to
the NCAA Division III Qualify-
ing Tournament at Mansfield,
Pa. on Feb. 23-24.

-had received their

typical W&L game, reminis-
cient of the way the Generals
have played all year long. The
Generals could not get untrack-
ed in the first half as the took
early leads of no more than six
points. E-MC came back to tie
the score at 33, but W&L pulled
away toa 43-37 halftime lead.

In the second half, after they
usual
halftime chewing out, the
Generals played like a different
team. W&L put on a spurt of six
straight points to break open a
48-45 game into a 54-45 lead.
From this point, with Ardie Col-
lins and Tom _ Jeffries
dominating the defensive
boards with a combination of
blocked shots and rebounds, the
Generals pulled away to a lead
of 76-61. With Carby Hoy and
Dave Leunig hitting on long
jumpers, Jeffries and R.J.
Scaggs filling in the middle, and
Mike Wenke and Pete Farrell
handing out assists, E-MC
never stood a chance.

Still, Canfield was not totally
pleased with the performance.
“T’d like to get two good halves
out of these guys.” said the
coach. “‘In the first half we have

, » been using our pressure

defense, and by the second half
it wears the opponent down.
This was true against Eastern
Mennonite.”

Leading the Generals were
Hoy with 22 points while Farrell
and Jeffries each chipped in 12.
Leunig added 11.

The Generals ended up with a
7-3 ODAC mark and now can
finish no worse than third in the
conference. Two weekends
from now, on Friday night, Feb.
23, W&L will likely face Lyn-
chburg in an ODAC tournament
semifinal match. As usual, this
means that Lynchburg has been
making a big deal out of having
to play W&L. The Lynchburg
University newspaper has
already likened Coach Canfield
to Woody Hayes. But, as Can-
field reassures us — ‘‘consider-
ing the source of the material, it
doesn’t matter what is said.
They think we make a special
fuss over playing ,Lynchburg,
but it doesn’t matter that much
to us. If they want to say
anymore, they should look at
the record. Eight wins in the
last nine games is pretty con-
vincing.”’

Considering the way that
W&L has been playing, Lyn-
chburg might regret being too
boisterous. Maybe someone
should get Lynchburg in touch
with the Unknown Fans. If Lyn-
chburg has to face the Generals
in the Tournament, they will
need all the help they can get!

Tennis team faces ‘one of
toughest schedules ever’

by Nat Lovell

Though the Washington and
Lee tennis team has lost three
starting players, for various
reasons, and will be facing a
very tough schedule this spring,
first year Coach Gary Franke is
confident that the team will per-
form well.

The loss of last year’s All-
American Ben Johns will
especially hurt the team, but
this year’s group of freshmen
will undoubtedly help fill in the
gap. With returning junior All-
American and Captain Stewart
Jackson and léttermen David
Constine, Pat Norris (both
juniors) Doug Gaker and
Robert Shuler (both
sophomores), the team’s major
strength will be its depth. A pro-
bable lineup consists of Jackson
at number one_ singles,
freshman Shaw Cranfield at
number two singles, Gaker at
three, and a scramble for the
remaining three positions bet-
ween Shuler, Constine,
freshman Wes Yonge, and stan-
dout double player Pat Norris.

A wrestler at heart, Coach
Franke has applied his condi-
tioning expertise to the tennis
team and seems determined to
whip the players into top shape.
They will need all the stamina
they can build up for what
. Coach Franke calls “‘one of the
toughest schedules ever.’
Washington and -Lee annually
faces some of the sternest com-

by Warren Crowdus

As Washington and Lee’s
baseball squad enters its fourth
week of indoor practice ses-
sions, interim coach Chuck
Kroll (Coach Lyles is on sab-
batical) is optimistic about his
team’s chances this spring.
Kroll says the players have
forgotten about the Generals’
dismal performance in 1978 and
are looking forward to the new
season. ‘‘We are going to turn a
few heads around here and play
some good, aggressive
baseball,” said Kroll.

Kroll may have good reason
to be optimistic. Nearly all of
last year’s starter- including
co-captains Dan Kingman and
Rich Wiles, are back this year.
Other returnees are infielders
Mike Busbey, John Stagmaier
and Doug Hassinger, out-
fielders Don Swagart and
Chuck D’Auria, as well as the
ace of last season’s pitching
staff, Chip Chiles.

In addition to this nucleus of
veterans, Knoll has no less than
fifteen freshmen trying out for
the squad. Kroll hopes the
rookies will infuse a healthy at-
mosphere of competition into
the Generals’ training pro-

- gram. The Generals’ new coach
maintains that none of last
year’s regulars are guaranteed
of receiving a starting job. Be-
ing new to Washington and Lee,
Kroll will judge his players on

petition available for a Division
III school, including several
matches with Division I
powerhouses. The team’s Texas
trip features their toughest
games. The Generals will meet
the University of Texas, the
University of Dallas, and top-
ten Division I school Texas
Christian University. The
team’s success is not to be
measured by the number of vic-
tories over such schools as
these, for they will be decidedly
underdogged in these matches.
Instead, it is hoped that the

a

large amount of stiff competi-
tion will prepare them for the
ultimate year end goal of cap-
turing the Division HI National
Chamionships. Washington and
Lee has finished second in these
championships two years runn-
ing. W&L is also a member of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference in tennis though mat-
‘ches between the Generals and
ODAC teams invariably have a
history of being romps in W&L’s
favor. The Generals have never
lost an ODAC match.

 

 

JMU’s fencers did not show up in Saturday’s match against W&L.
Here two General fencers play with each other.

Baseball team seeks
return to respectability

the basis of their performance
this spring, not by past records.

Kroll intends to do much of
his evaluating in Florida over
February break, when the team
will have a spring training
camp in the Orlando area. It is
difficult to judge players on the
basis of indoor performance.
Kroll feels he will have a much
better idea of who his best

players are after seeing the
team perform on the baseball
diamond. The trip to Florida
could also help the Generals get
a jump on their competition in
the early stages of the upcom-
ing season.

Coach Knoll says that one of
his team’s greatest challenges

Despite taking two first
places in last Saturday’s indoor
track meet at Lynchburg Col-
lege, Washington and Lee plac-
ed fourth out of five teams in the
final tally.

Lynchburg won the meet with
72 points followed by
Bridgewater-48, Davidson-58,
W&L-48, and Roanoke-28.

Instrumental in both first
place finishes was tri-captain
Jack Norberg who won the 440
yard run and was a member of
the winning mile relay team.
Other members of the relay
team were Ron Calkins, Randy
Austin and Dave Cordell.
Norberg also placed second in
the 60 yard dash.

Coach Norris Aldridge in-

pointed because the team didn’t

Washington and Lee’s recent-
ly formed Squash Club won its
first match last weekend,
defeating the Roanoke Squash
Club 10-0.

‘This is no fly-by-night club,”
said club president Dee
Keesler, a junior, of the 48
member organization. ‘‘But we
really don’t have the facilities
to accomodate all those in-
dividuals.”

Keesler said the group is
planning a tournament with
squash clubs in Lynchburg and
Charlottesville. Two more mat-
ches for March have already
been planned with the Roanoke
club.

Keesler said his group is in-
terested in converting the two
handball courts in the gym, that
are not regulation size, into
combination squash-racketball

meet.’’

The weak points proved to be
the distance runs, due to ‘‘inex-
perience and depth.”” However,
according to Aldridge, ‘‘there is
potential.” As expected the
strong points were the sprints
while the weight and jumping
events had performed better in
the past.

Others who performed well
were Russ Rector in the high
hurdles and high jump, Bob
Campbell who pole vaulted his
best height ever and Chris
Leiser who ran well in the 60
yarddash.

Coach Aldridge noted that
“Davidson hurt us more than
‘the other teams (did).”’ In look-
@ forward to the only other

of the season, the ODAC

ionships on February 24,

e added, “We have a

to win but we’ll have to
eel all events.”’

““nsufficient facilities for
and racketball at

iL,” he said.
The cost is a deterrent,
however, as the courts would

ost $7,500 each to panel with

weod and make usable for
squash and racketball.

“The money involved is
awesome ($15,000),’’ Keesler
said. ‘I think it’s kind of out of
our scope right now to raise that
much money.”

He said that he would be talk-
ing te the ‘‘proper administra-
tion officials’ in the future
about the possibility of funding
the remodeling project.

“‘We want to follow the same
route as the water polo team
and hopefully become an NCAA
sport,” Keesler said, ‘‘but
that’s not possible without the

proper facilities.’’

Mull purchases R.E. Lee

(continued from page 1)

The leases for the stores run
on a month to month system
with a six month notice before
termination. The beauty parlor
renewed its five year lease on
June 1, 1976.

Mull is a restaurant owner
who also rents apartments
above his College Inn. He has
big plans for his new property
on Main Street and has already
started to put his plan in action.

“It is something over the
years I’ve been looking at,”’
says Mull while running tbe
cash register in his restaurant.
‘Some tell you you are
bananas,”’ he adds, ‘‘and some
tell you of the positive aspects.
You get lots of encouragement
and discouragement. I don’t
know why someone has not
bought it yet,” remarks Mull.

“Some feel that the tremen-
dous financial outlay is too
much of a risk. It has complete-
ly turned them off,” he adds.
“I’m not wealthy by any stretch
of the imagination so I'll have to
work twice as hard. I personally
see a return on the investment
though.”’

“For now I don’t see any im-

mediate changes,’’ Mull says:
with regard to the hotel. ‘I plan
to fill it to capacity though and
will make every effort humanly
possible. I would like to start
signing leases immediately.’’

“T’ll be the first to admit that
I’m in it for the money,” says
Mull, ‘‘and I'll be at it for 10 to
20 years more.”’

“T can tell you though that I
see the rents going up at the
hotel,” finalizes Mull.

‘One thing I will state is that
there will be no restaurant in
the vacant store, that I can
assure you. There are too many
restaurants in town now,” said
Mull.

“T have talked to four or five
people who want to rent it but I
can’t divulge their names
because I don’t want to offend
any of them,” he adds. “The
back dining room and upstairs

ball room are still in the talking
stages.”

“IT have a lot of repairs to
make,’’ said Mull while boxing
a small cheese pizza to go. ‘‘The
structure itself is in good condi-
tion and it also has one of the
best fire ratings in town,’’ he
adds.

‘“‘Removing the restaurant
will get rid of one of the biggest
hazards because that is where
most of your fires start. Fire is
the overriding concern of the
landlord,” states Mull. “‘I have
always had a fear of it.”’

‘The problem will come from
the mechanical aspects, the
plumbing, heating and elec-
trical’’ Mull said. ‘‘That will
need attention and necessary
upkeep.”

“The elevators are in fine
shape and are inspected once a
month by the company who in-
stalled them. They are on im-
mediate call. If they get stuck
between floors we also have
keys to get the people out.

“Monday I’ll go through the
hotel and see what repairs have
to be made,’’ Mull said. “If any
hazards exist, I’ll get them cor-
rected immediately.”

“The parking lot will also
need attention,’ said Mull.
“There are a lot of potholes, and
lines have to be painted for a
parking system presently not
done. ‘

‘‘My first priority though is to
get those free parking signs
down,”’ said Mull. “I feel sure
I’ll charge for the parking.”’

Mull says that he hopes to
have the hotel in operation by
mid-August. “By that I mean
safe, clean, livable conditions. I
should be ready to go for the
79-80 school year,” he adds.
“T’ve shown four rooms
already.”’

“I have not met with the peo-
ple that are living there but I
will make a point to meet with
each one individually and tell
them that I am the new owner,”

said Mull.

“IT am a firm belkever that
everyone has different needs
and different situations.
Presently there are students
living in the hotel on two floors
and elderly people on another.”’

‘The leases are not yet deter-
mined but they will be pattern-
ed after the ones I currently use
at the College Inn,’’ Mull said.

“The leases I use now are 10
month leases. I think they are
the more workable leases,”’
adds Mull. “For students, it
gives them two weeks at the end
to get everything out. No matter
what your leases are though,
you are going to adjust them ac-
cordingly.”

“Costs are always going up,”’
he adds, ‘‘and if I knew how to
keep costs down, I’d be in
Washington D. C., not here,
solving the inflation problem.”

Tenants react to hotel sale

by Joe Scott

Elderly residents of the
Robert E. Lee Hotel are unsure
and worried about their futures.
Clyde Mull, new owner of the
hotel complex since Feb. 9, has
said there will be a rent in-
crease but has not specified the
amount.

Lucille Valentine has lived at
the hotel for 10 years and says
she “‘enjoys it very much.” She
lives on the sixth floor but would
rather not reveal her room
number because ‘‘there’s no
protection here. There is no one
at the front desk,’’ she says.
‘“‘We’ve never had any trouble
though with molesting or
anything.”’

“Mr. Mull has not talked to
me yet,’’ she says referring to
the rent increase. ‘“‘I wouldn’t
like it though because I’m on a
fixed income,’”’ she adds. “‘I
wouldn’t like it one bit.”’

“T like it here,’ says Mrs.
Valentine. “The boys (W&L
students who live on another
floor) are nice. When it last
snowed they offered to go shop-
ping for us.”’

“If the rent goes up, I couldn’t
stay here. I’d go to the poor
house,’’ Mrs. Valentine adds.
“My income isn’t going up
any.”

“I guess we’ll have to find a
place,” says Dorothy Wilson,
Lucille Valentine’s sister. ‘‘At
the moment I can’t think of any
place though,’”’ she adds. ‘“‘It
would have to be close by
because we can’t walk a lot. We
couldn’t afford a taxi.”’

“T like it here too,’’ says
Dorothy Wilson. “It’s a very
comfortable and convenient.”’

Mae Sue Donald has lived at
the hotel for over four years.
“I’ve enjoyed it. I’ve heard that
he is going to’’ she adds, referr-
ing to the rent increase.

“I don’t have anywhere else
to go. I could afford it, but I
need a job,’’ says Donald. ‘“‘I’d
try and find another place but I
hope it doesn’t come to that.’’

“Mr. Mull has not seen me,”’
Donald says, ‘‘I’ve seen him but
he hasn’t talked to me.”’

Still, Mr. Mull recently
assured members of the Ring-
tum Phi staff that he will make
every effort to co-operate with
the elderly residents currently
in the Robert E. Lee. ‘‘forcing
them out is certainly not in my
plans,” he said, and added, “‘I

intend to speak to them all as a
group in the near future. But
some adjustments must be

made, as these residents have
been paying rent figures which
haven’t kept up with the times
for many years.”’

Lack of Low Cost Housing

(continued from page 1)
allowance if tenants are re-
quired to pay their own utility
bills. This would not put too
much of a burden on tenants
who live on welfare or other fix-
ed income. But there isn’t any
space available in any of the
rent-controlled complexes.

‘People have waited two years
or more to get an apartment in
the Mountain View Terrace
Housing Project, said J.B.
Lewis, one of the founders of the
Rockbridge Housing Corpora-
tion, which owns the apart-
ments.

People from anywhere within
Rockbridge County, including
Lexington and Buena Vista,
may apply for a one, two, or
three bedroom apartment
there, Lewis said. The lowest
rent for a one bedroom apart-
ment is $52.50, he said. The
apartment complex contains 40
units in all.

The waiting list at Willow Spr-
ings is not as long, but people
still wait up to a year to get an

apartment there, superinten-
dent Robert Moore said.

The rents are about the same
as in the Mountain View pro-
ject, but the turnover is greater
because Willow Springs has
more than 90 units, Moore said.
Willow Springs is designated as
middle income housing.

Lexington House Apart-
ments, the third rent-controlled
project, has a waiting list “at
least one-year long,’”’ manager
Shirley Leech said.

Lexington House is restricted
to senior citizens and disabled
people. A disabled person with a
family cannot live there, Leech
said.

The project has 78 one-
bedroom apartments, six of
which are designed with low
sinks, wide doors and other
features which make life easier
for disabled persons.

People who live in
Rockbridge County may apply
for a rental assistance pro-
gram, which is also sponsored
by the U.S. Department of

Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, while they wait for a
vacancy in one of these housing
projects. People who live in
rented houses, apartments or
trailers, which meet certain
standards can apply for the pro-
gram, which will pay a portion
of the rent, the program’s direc-
tor Don Johenning said.

In order to qualify for the ren-
tal assistance program the per-
son must meet specific income
guidelines and the place in
which he lives must have
heating and hot and cold runn-
ing water.

The program, which has been
in existence for about six mon-
ths, has helped 21 of 60 ap-
plicants, Johenning said. The
ones who were turned down
either did not meet income
guidelines or lived in  sub-
standard housing.

Residents of Lexington and
Buena Vista are not covered by
the rental assistance program,
he said, but if someone from one
of the cities applies for the pro-
gram he may receive aid after
he moves to the county.

Lexington City Manager John
Doane said that the city council
has never suggested applying
for the federal rental assistance
program. ~-

Doane said he believes the
housing situation in Lexington
is no worse than in other cities.

EC Plans

Grade Review
Discussion
by David Greer

The Student Body Executive
Committee will meet Monday,
Feb. 26, to discuss final pro-
posals for the grade review
plan.

The EC hopes that students
will come to the meeting the
first Monday after Mid-Winter
break, and offer any sugges-
tions before the final draft is
sent to the faculty.

The meeting will be held at
6:30 p.m. in the EC room in the
student center.

In other business, the Student
Activities Board reported that it
lost $200 on their ski trip which
was cancelled. The money was
the initial deposit made for the
trip.

When asked about possible
bands for a spring concert the
SAB said that they were looking
into available bands and they
they had $500 on deposit with a
band agent in New York who
has moved and left no for-
warding address.

The Cold Check Committee
said that it hopes to pay off a
$500 loan from the EC next
month. It said that there is still
a little over $100 owed by
students who have left the
university.

Ring-tum Phi business
manager Cove Geary said that
the student newspaper is
operating in the black with
about $3,000 in assets over
liabilities.

correct.”

Huntley told the gathered
fraternity representatives that
he had heard expressions of
concern about W&L’s fraternity
system from the trustees, alum-
ni, faculty, townspeople. ‘‘Peo-
ple express irritiation at least,
anger at worst, and sadness
more often than not.”’

The areas which Huntley

feels need improvement are

“financial management, social
conduct, and structural or
house upkeep.”’

Asking for help, the universi-
ty president requested that
fraternity leaders ‘‘do what you
can for the school in this field.”’
Huntley stressed the point, ‘I
don’t know exactly what my
role is, but the fraternities’ role
is more important.”

As a long-time resident of the
W&L community, Huntley has
noticed a ‘slipping away of the
fraternity establishment as I
knew it.”’

“There was a time when
fraternity life was a positive ex-
perience and_ provided
reassurance in terms of roots,
friendships, companionship,
and the positive values in life,”’
he said.

“In the days when I was a stu-
dent here the fraternities were
a positive influence against the
negative values I have describ-
ed here, rather than a hotbed to
forment them.”

Huntley stressed the im-
portance of a fraternity during
the ‘‘transition between
boyhood and manhood.” He ad-
ded that fraternities were, at
one time, a reservoir of positive
values, not a place to shed all
moral principles.”

Suggesting a solution to the
problem, Huntley said, ‘What
we ought to do is create an en-
vironment in which positive
values are instilled.”’

“If Iam correct in my facts, a
kind of unarticulated wish ex-

“970707 0-0-0_0_0,0.6.8,'
ona atateta eee

ists in the social life, and the
quality of that life, a wish that it
were better.”’

Stressing a sense of duty,
Huntley told fraternity
members, ‘You have an obliga-
tion to make it better.’ He ask-
ed for a response, even if it was
that fraternity members were
“insensitive” or ‘ ‘‘don’t care.”’

Consistent with his emphasis
on response from the fraternity
men assembled, Huntley sat
down at the end of his speech
and seemed to be waiting for
some response, but he only
received applause.

Huntley rose again, and again
stressed the need for a student-
administration dialog in the
future before he left the room.

As the meeting broke up,
Huntley returned and began the
communication that he hopes
will lead to the rehabilitation of
the fraternity system.

Responding to criticism

Well, it’s nice to know
somebody reads my column.
My Nielson ratings haven't
been too high lately, and my
editor was thinking of pre-
empting me for re-runs of last
year’s editorials.

As for the implication that I
only make intellectually based
organizations targets for my
witticisms, I believe that frater-
nities as a whole have received
their fair share, and they don’t
exactly sit around discussing
Emmanuel Kant. I have men-
tioned the Film Society once
before in passing while the

fraternities have been pelted in
the majority of my articles.

As formothers not loving
snipers, my mother loves me
(Don’t you, Mom?), and I'd
also like it noted that I have
made a conscious effort to dif-
ferentiate myself from last
year’s The Nose Knows. I don’t
butt into people’s private af-
fairs, and I rarely make fun of
individuals.

As for my identity, you'd
never believe it. Isn’t that right
Jimmy, Lois, and Mr. White? I
can’t come out of the closet;
homosexuality is alright these

EC funds

by Jimmy Olson

W&L’s Varsity Sunbathing
Team announced plans yester-
day to petition the Executive
Committee for $1,000 to fund a
training trip to Florida this spr-
ing.

Zonker Harris, coach of W &
L’s sunbathing team said, ‘“‘We
need the time in Florida so that
we can compete with the West
Coast Beach Pack 10 Teams.”
He added, ‘‘Florida’s climate
will prepare us better than
many of our Division III op-
ponents who cannot afford the
trip.”

Harris forsees little problem
in obtaining the money because
the lacrosse team received the
same amount from the E. C.
last week.

Coach Harris added that the
time spent in Florida will be us-
ed for training. ‘‘The team is
already paying for their own
essentials such as meals and
suntan oil,’’ Harris said. The
team has also raised a con-
siderable amount by selling
Polaroid Shades and straw
hats.

Harris deemed the trip essen-
tial with 90 percent of the team
taking ‘‘the dig’’ during the spr-
ing semester. The other 10 per-
cent, who are taking Total
Theater, will remain in Florida
an extra week to give the team
the competitive edge, Harris
said
