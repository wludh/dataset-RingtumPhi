NUMBER 18

Censures Freshman Rep.

 

Calvert’s Statement

Concerning what I feel to be the gross
negligence of an EC member on a
preliminary investigation: although this
situation regards the secrecy of an honor trial
and the discussion must remain in the third
person, this involves something of major im-
portance The Honor System.

This committee has gone to great lengths to
retain its impartiality both while in-
vestigating and hearing trials. It is the over-
whelming understanding of mine that the
committee has remained unbiased and fair
with all respect to the accused. Any contact
with the accused prior to the trial should be
avoided. Under no condition should a member
discuss with the accused any aspect of the
trial such as how he suspects the Committee
will render its decision, assessing his
chances, etc. If a member of the EC is con-
fronted by an accused he must “‘bite his
tongue,’’ so to speak.

Therefore, I feel it is imperative that we as

a committee address this question to restore
the confidence in our ability to review cases
impartially. We have the power to discipline
our own members — we must consider the
distasteful task if for no one else but
ourselves. However, the Honor System and
the Student Body deserve it.

The EC’s Statement

We, as a committee, wish to affirm our
dedication to impartiality and our commit-
ment to fairness. We recognize that, as in-
dividual members, we are not infallible. Fur-
ther, we realize that is is our responsibility to
insure that each of our members maintains
our standards of fairness and impartiality. In
this way, we hope to return the trust the Stu-
dent Body has placed in us.

 

 

Grade Review
Proposal Changed

by David Greer

A member of the stu-
dent body Executive
Committee was censured
Monday night and will
not be allowed to par-
ticipate in any EC func-
tions for four weeks.

The EC voted to suspend
freshman representative
Charlie Scott for misconduct
during a preliminary investiga-
tion of a possible honor viola-
tion.

Senior representative Rob
Calvert read a prepared state-
ment in which he stated that
there had been ‘‘gross
negligence of an EC member on
a preliminary investigation’’
and said that ‘‘we have the
power to disclipline our own
members.”

Calvert recommended
suspending Scott for one month,
stripping him of voting powers
and access to closed sessions.

Scott said that he had return-
ed from a trip out of town and
found a note on his door from a
student who was under in-
vestigation of a possible honor
violation. The note, which Scott
produced, said, ‘‘Charlie — see
me”’ and was signed by the ac-
cused.

Scott said, “I ignored the
message because I believed it
was improper to have any con-
tact with him.”’

‘Scott said that later that night

Allows

he was at a party at his fraterni-

ty house when he was approach-

ed by the accused.

Scott said that the accused
asked him some. procedural
questions and that he felt that it
was his responsibility as a
member of the EC to clarify
them.

‘My original intentions were
just to inform him of EC pro-
ceedures,”’ Scott said. Without
warning, the accused ‘‘just
came out of the blue and con-
fessed tome.”

After the accused confessed
the honor violation to Scott, he
said that he told the accused “‘I
can’t be impartial any more’”’
and he would have to step down
from proceedures. .

“I didn’t know how to handle
the matter after he confessed to
me,” said Scott, ‘‘I disqualified
myself”’ from the investigation.

Scott said that he asked the
accused how he knew who was
on the investigating committee
and the accused told him that he
had learned from friends.

Scott said, ‘‘The accused was
a friend of mine: he asked what
his chances are; I said, ‘What
do you think? After telling me
these things, what do you
think?’”’

“T told him he had to live with
any decision he made,”’ Scott
said, “I never spoke for the

committee, just as a friend, an
individual.”’

“It was never my intention to
give the accused any informa-

Scott’s Statement

I regret that I made an error in judgement
in my handling of the incident, for this I am
very sorry. At the time I thought that I was
acting solely as a friend and in no way in any
official capacity. I now recognize that the two
are inseperable. Things that are said on a
strictly friend to friend basis are often con-—
strued as official. I intended to act in my
capacity as an EC member only to inform the
accused of EC proceedure. I in no way at- .

_ tempted to commit an injustice to the accused

or to the Honor System but merely to give ad-
vice which was asked for by a friend.

with the professor involved with
the disputed grade was dropped
in favor of a proposal for a five-
professor grade review board.

The all-professor grade
review board would hear the
complaint, the professor's
reasoning for the grade, and
would have the power to over-
turn the original grade.

The faculty EC was quick to
respond to the new grade
review proposal, however,
voting it down 8-2 at their
meeting Tuesday, the Ring-tum
Phi has learned. The committee
was apparently divided along
strict faculty-student lines.

Debate on the student EC's
grade review recommendation
was deadlocked Monday when
Neal Brickman, attending his
first EC meeting as first-year
law school representative, of-
fered the proposal that disputed
grades be reviewed by a stan-
ding committee of five pro-

Thursday

Parties

by John Billmyre

Although there is a by-law in
the I.F.C. constitution that pro-
hibits Thursday night parties,
fraternities will be allowed to
party on that night this week.
The Judicial Board of the Inter-
fraternity Council voted Tues-
day night in favor of lifting the
ban on weeknight parties this
week because of Fancy Dress.

LF.C. president Jim Davis
expressed some concern about
the matter saying, ‘‘We don’t
want the boom to come down on
Saturday — as a result of Thurs-
day and Wednesday night par-
ties.”’

Fraternities presented with a
summons on Thursday will
have their cases reviewed by
the I.F.C. Judicial Board.

Washington and Lee's
lacrosse team repaid the $1,000
loan granted them by the stu-
dent Executive Committee at
Monday night's EC meeting.

The money had been used to
help finance a training trip for
the team in Florida over the 10-
day mid-winter break.

Tri-captains Jeff Fritz, John
Black, and Sandy McDonald at-
tended the meeting to present
the $1,000 on behalf of the team.

“We feel we got a lot ac-
complished down there that we
couldn't have gotten done up
here because of the weather,”
Black told the EC, ‘‘and we'd
like to thank the EC for their
support.”

The money came from an
‘anonymous supporter,’’ Black
said.

The lacrosse team also gave
an unused $109 that was raised
by Cockpit entertainment to
help finance the training trip to
help support the Muscular

Dystrophy Dance Marathon.

In other action, the EC ac-
cepted a student petition which
requests the athletic depart-
ment to keep one gymnasium
available for student use.

Michael Gallagher in presen-
ting the 433-signature petition to
the committee said that both
basketball courts were used by
various athletic teams
throughout the day, preventing
students who do not participate
in an organized sport from ac-
cess to the gym.

“We're not against the
athletic teams using one gym.
but the athletic department
could work out a staggered
schedule if they were forced
to,’ Gallagher said.

“Don't except much,” said
Rob Calvert, senior EC
representative, who has also
been trying to open up the gym
himself, *‘People have been try-
ing to discourage me in my ef-
forts.”

Crimes Against Students Up

by John Pryor

A mini-crime wave has struck
both the Law School and the
town of Lexington.

The latest victim was
Suzanne’ Barnette whose
backpack was stolen from her
carrel last week. Perversely the
thieves removed the running
clothes she had in it and left
them in the Ladies Room.

That same evening, Bevin
Alexander’s backpack was
“removed,” but was later
dumped on another student’s
desk. Bevin’s only explanation
for its abandonment lies in the
unique ‘ugliness’ of the item
which deterred the felons.

These incidents followed a
wave of car vandalism in the
parking lots around campus.

At the beginning of the
semester Scott Rayson return-
ed to his car in the easily ac-
cessible Piney Woods only to
find a window smashed in and
his hiking boots gone.

By far the worst of the events
in the recent series was the
“trashing” of five cars belong-
ing to Baker Law Dorm
residents. Scott Tinnon, Dorm
Counselor, was the first to
notice the destruction, which
occurred sometime during the
early morning hours of Sunday,
Feb. 4.

The damage, which was
reported to the police, included
two cars with snapped aerials
(Scott Tinnon’s and_ the
author’s), one with a weather
cover stolen (Jeff Gray), and
one with a stolen distributor
wire (Pete Williams). In addi-
tion, Will Walls’ car was severe-

ly worked over, losing an aerial,
a side view mirror, two tail
pipes, and acquiring a smashed
in door.

Chief J.A. Kirby of the Lex-
ington Police Department notes
that there has been an alarming
increase in student related
crimes.

He has had numerous reports
of students losing items from
their cars, rooms and gym
lockers.

The official reports alone
since January 1 total nine.

Kirby estimates that approx-
imately 75 to 80 per cent of all
larcenies reported in the city
this year are phoned in by
students. The problem has got-
ten so severe that the police
department has separated the
student file from the other
reports.

A factor which has co licated
the investigation is the rash of

Corrections |

The Ring-tum Phi made an
error in the story last issue
about Clyde Mull buying the
Robert E. Lee Hotel.

Mrs. Edna Mull and her hus-
band own the _ property
equally. The court records in-
correctly list the grocery store
behind the hotel that Mull
bought as 17 N. Randolph St.
That address is the one for Flo's
Market, two blocks away.
The correct address for the
store purchased by Mull is not
known.

Also, all of the photographs in
the Ring-tum Phi's Special
Housing Section were taken by
Parker Roberts and Frank
Jones.

tire slashing and petty larceny
in the rest of the town.

Tires have been slashed in the
hopsital parking lot, on East
Nelson Street, and in the Jeffer-
son Street area.

There are rumors of a junior
high gang involved in these in-
cidents but there is little solid
proof.

The University’s Proctor is
not optimistic about cutting
down on the thefts or catching
the individuals responsible.

‘‘We only have five people to
patrol the campus. After two in
the morning we’re down to one.
Add in the increase in key check
points we have with the new
library, and you can see —
we're spread too thin.”’

He doesn’t see any immediate
possibility of hiring additional
security guards.

In the long run increased
security may be inevitable. In
the meantime students are urg-
ed to keep their possessions
locked up and cars parked in a
well-lit area.

Debate
Rescheduled

The Contact debate between
former Sen. Eugene McCarthy
and William Rusher has been
rescheduled for March 21.

The debate, which was
originally slated for Feb. 14,
was postponed due to the sud-
den illness of McCarthy.

The topic of the debate will be
“Directions for the 80’s’”’ and
will include a discussion of
issues likely to affect the United
States in the next decade.

Student Loan Default
Rate 10% At W&L

by Brian Gibson

The number of students who
default on their government-
guaranteed educational loans
has been a source of concern
both to the University Financial
Aid Department and to the U.S.
Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare over the last
few years.

Currently, there are two pro-
grams under which a student
may receive aid, the National
Direct Student Loan Program
and the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program.

The Department of HEW and
the University give a direct
grant to students sharing the
cost of college under a 90-10 per-
cent ration.

Under the other program,
HEW guarantees loans made
from a central lending agency,
here known as the Virginia
Educational Loan Authority.

These are agencies establish-
ed by the states which are em-
powered to sell bonds and loan
the resulting money to selected
students. Virginia also
guarantees loans made by
banks under this program.

While students are in school,
HEW pays 7 percent interest to
the lending agencies.

The percentage of people who
fail to repay their loans has
started to drop after a long
period of increases.

Nationally, the default rate of
the NDSLP is around 17 percent
while that of the GSLP has been
reduced from around 14 to 10.5
percent.

At Washington and Lee, the
default rate for both programs
is around 10 percent which ac-
cording to Dean Pate, Director

of Financial Aid, ‘compares
very favorably to the national
averages.”’

The reason our default rate is
so high is that many students go
on to graduate school and forget
to file a request for deferral of
payment each year, and when
they are contacted, these
“paper defaults’? are erased
from the school’s record but are
still included in the percen-
tages.

To make things easier for the
students, the University is cur-
rently switching from a
quarterly schedule of payments
to a monthly billing system.

This is being done to cushion
the shock of having to come up
with a large payment at the end
of each quarter. Also, the whole
American credit system is
geared to monthly payments,
Dean Pate said, and this will
also make it easier for students
to pay their loans back.

Overall, Washington and
Lee’s record under these pro-
grams compares’ very
favorably to other colleges
across the country.

Jack Anderson Speaks

Noted Journalists Attend W&L Conference

“Investigative reporting is
high-risk journalism,” Jack
Anderson told an Investigative
Reporters and Editors (1.R.E.)
workshop last weekend. ‘“Too_
many newsmen depend on hired
liars for information.”

Anderson was one of eight
Pulitzer Prize-winning _ in-
vestigative journalists who ad-
dressed the conference or took
part in panel discussions. The
conference took place at
Washington and Lee University
in Virginia and was organized
by Clark R. Mollenhoff
(Pulitzer, 1958), now professor
of journalism at W&L and for 25
years Washington correspon-
dent for the Des Moines
Register and Tribune.

About 150 journalists and
journalism students from
throughout the east attended
the three-day Potomac Region
I.R.E. workshop at Washington
and Lee.

In a provocative luncheon
talk, Jack Anderson declared
that ‘‘too many” journalists to-
day ‘‘are becoming creatures of
their keepers.’

“The state department
reporter,” he said, ‘often
begins to look like the foreign
diplomat, wearing tweed
jackets and puffing on a pipe.
The Pentagon reporter often
comes home looking like he just
got off maneuve; Each, in turn,
begins to write critical stories
of the other. Often this does give

us good stories -- but in a
strange way.

‘Press spokesmen are hired
to lie to us; they are expected to
lie,’’ Anderson said. ‘‘There is
not one of them who does not lie
professionally. I would fire a
reporter who would depend on
Jody Powell as a news source.
We don’t call Powell and ask
what is happening -- we call to
tell him what is happening and
ask if he has a comment.”

Again, disagreement.

Later that day, in the session
on Washington investigation the
Star’s Fialka commented: ‘‘Not
all public relations people lie.
Nine times out of 10 they just
don’t know the truth.”’

During his wideranging ad-
dress, Anderson ripped into the
Carter administration and its
attitude of what he called
‘almost inflexible moral cer-
tainty.

Carter gives the impression,
Anderson said, that he has a
direct line to God. And when
you have that, he said, ‘‘you
don’t have to pay much atten-
tion to Cyrus Vance.”

At one point Anderson
described Carter as “an in-
competent President relying on
incompetent advisors . . . an in-
experienced President relying
on inexperienced counselors.”
That, Anderson declared, is the
“big story” of White House
coverage.

Anderson described the role

of his own syndicated column,
‘“‘Washington Merry-Go-

Round,” as ‘a news service
covering the shady side of the
street.”

During the balance of the
weekend, it became evident
that a significant problem for
reporters themselves is defin-
ing how they should act and to
whom they should feel responsi-
ble.

There was a session too on
ethics, moderated by Dr. Louis
W. Hodges of Washington and
Lee. He is head of W&L’s pro-
fessional ethics program.
Among his panelists were A. E.
Fitzgerald, the U.S. Air Force
cost analyst who lost his job --
temporarily -- for whistle-
blowing, and Marvin Stone of
U.S. News and World Report.

Robert W. Greene of News-
day on Long Island, past I.R.E.
president, opened the con-
ference in Lee Chapel and set
the tone for many subsequent
speakers’ remarks. Speaking
on ‘‘Freedom of the Press,”
which he defined as ‘‘a simple
doctrine -- exempt from govern-
ment control,’’ Greene
paraphrased James Madison’s
warning: ‘In a free nation,
rights are not lost overnight;
they are gradually nibbled to
death.”’

Musical Mainstream

bu « Vark . Mainwaring

While considering some possi-
ble topics for this week’s col-
umn, it came to our attention
that one very important area of
popular music had _ been
neglected so far in Musical
Mainstream, that being the
world of singles, commonly
referred to as the top-40.

In order to rectify this over-
sight, we tracked down the
latest issue of Billboard, looked
up the top ten singles of the
week, and proceeded to
evaluate them in terms of basic
quality and, a more intangible
but at the same time very
crucial factor, just how good
they sound on AM radio.

One interesting fact turned up
in the process of reviewing
these singles; with a few excep-
tions, these songs tended to in-
spire more hedging and
qualifications than extreme
judgments one way or the other.
This would tend to reinforce the
commonly held view of top-40 as
bland and homogenized; you
can make your own judgments,
based on the following com-
ments.

Top Ten

1. Rod Stewart ‘Do Ya Think
I'm Sexy”

This one’s a. paradox. Rod
Stewart’s chief strength has
always been his ability to over-
come poor material with his
unique singing style and voice,
but in his latest effort his vocals
don’t even equal (much less
surpass) the mediocre but
passable melody.

‘Comparisons to the Stones’’
‘Miss You’ are inevitable:
both songs feature mainstream
rock artists moving into the
realm of disco, and it’s clear
that Stewart had the Stones’
summer hit in mind when recor-
ding “‘Do Ya Think I’m Sexy,”
conceptually if not melodically.

But Stewart isn’t Jagger, and
he comes across as bored and
narcissistic rather than confi-
dent and believable. At least
“Do Ya Think I’m Sexy”’ isn’t
Stewart’s commercial sell-out,

though — he did that a long time
ago.

2. Pointer Sisters ‘‘Fire”’

Another gift from the
magnanimous Bruce Springs-
teen, “‘Fire’’ has been moving
up the charts with unusual
speed for the past two weeks.
Taken from the standpoint of a
Springsteen fan, the Pointer
Sisters do a _ credible job
musically, especially in the way
they handle the bridge, which is
the song’s crucial point.

However, the fact remains
that ‘‘Fire” was conceived as a
boyish leer, almost in the same
vein as Rod Stewart’s
“Tonight’s the Night,’’ and the
Sisters simply cannot pull off
the difficult task of making the
song believable from a female
viewpoint.

From the standpoint of a
top-40 fan, the song has almost
nothing to recommend it; no
catchy chorus, no distinctive
riff, nothing to really grab you.
“Fire” is one of the more
unlikely, and also one of the
more pleasant, successes of the
year to date.

3. Olivia Newton-John ‘‘A Lit-
tle More Love”

Olivia may be ‘Totally Hot”’

and Robin < « Veredith

now, but ‘‘Little More Love’ is
only slightly less homogenized
than anything else she’s done.
Admittedly, the song iscon-
structed in a rather unique way,
and the way she deadpans the
title line is a real grabber, and
those slashing guitar chords
during the verses are a bit of a
shocker at first. But when you
get down to it, this is still the
same Olivia who favored us
with “Hopelessly Devoted to
You,” and some things just
don’t change.

4. Gloria Gaynor “I Will Sur-
vive”’

Gloria Gaynor’s latest is
1979’s_ version of “I Am
Woman,” an updated, upbeat
female anthem sweeping discos
across the country. The song
features a nice, slow opening,
the obligatory good beat and or-
chestration, and — surprise! —
even intelligent lyrics, a rare
commodity in the disco field.

5. Village People ‘‘Y.M.C.A.”’

Speaking of lyrics. . . okay, so
these are about as weak as they
come. One listen to the melody
and you don’t even care. This
song’s got what it takes — fast,
driving beat, a strong, brassy

A good old movie thriller from Brazil

by Dick Barron

There’s hope yet for the good-
ole movie thriller. I’m not talk-
ing about a Superman or a Star
Wars, but a believable down to
earth suspense film. I’m talking
about The Boys From Brazil
This film brings back the days
when films were solidly produc
ed and acted.

Take a look at the cast
Gregory Peck as Mengele, the
infamous Nazi doctor who hat-
ches a diabolical plot, Sil
Lawrence Olivier (who pro
trayed the hunted Nazi, Szell, in
Marathon Man) returning as a

Nazi hunter, Ezra Lieberman,
and James Mason as Mengele’s
colleague rounding out the list
of eloquent veteran actors.

Twists and shifts

It’s difficult to detail the plot

of The Boys without revealing

the surprise twists and shifts.
Let’s just say that Mengele is up
to something in the jungles of
south America — no one knows
quite what it is, and no one

cares, until an American youth

Slips and falls into some very

messy foul play — Lieberman
finds out and the hunt is on.
Mengele moves ever onward
with his evil plans, while
Lieberman narrows the space
between himself and his prey.

The characters are actual
personalities, but the action is a
product of the imagination of

These explorations have led to
the development of four new
series of work, three of which
will be on view when ‘Sculpture
Plus’’ opens.

Roberts has slipped into the
Washington art scene with sur-
prising ease. A series of his
silkscreen prints was exhibited
this past December at Huber
Gallery in Georgetown. He par-
ticipated in ‘‘36 Hours,” an un-
precedented event where
Walter Hopps, the nationally
known cavalier curator, col-
loborated with The Museum of
Temporary Art and hung every
work brought to the museum
over a straight 36 hour period.
Most recently, he was a part of
“Open City,” a program coor-
dinated by the Washington Pro-
ject for the Arts in which
several D.C. artists opened
their studios for public tours.

Roadside Theatre group

presents historical drama

A true-history drama written
by two 1968 Washington and Lee
University graduates will be
presented next Thursday,
March 8, in W&L’s Troubadour
Theatre under the sponsorship
of the Glasgow Endowment for
the Arts. The free performance
will take place at 8 p.m.

The play is ‘‘Red Fox/Second
Hangin’’’ and was_ pieced
together by the W&L
classmates, Donald H. Baker
and Dudley D. Cocke Jr., from

courthouse records in Wise
County in far southwest
Virginia.

Their troupe, Roadside

Theatre, has presented ‘Red
Fox’’ to widespread critical ac-
claim, particularly in New
York, where it received rave
reviews from the New York
Times, Christian Science
Monitor, Village Voice and The
New Yorker.

The play re-tells the story of
M. B. (Doc) Taylor, a doctor,
surveyor and religious mystic
who was hanged for murder in
1893 in Wise County. In addition

to court records, Baker and
Cocke combed through old
newspapers and — ‘‘most im-

portantly,”’ they say — listened
to oral-history accounts by
older residents of the area who
remembered Doc Taylor or had
memorized stories passed down
in families.

‘“‘What they told us,’’ Cocke
says, ‘often contradicted the
‘book facts,’ but as it turned out,
their version was the one cor-
roborated at major points by
the court records we dug up.”’

The Roadside format is to tell

the story as just that — a story.
The ‘‘actors’’ on_ stage
sometimes portray characters,
but more often they are nar-
rators. They use no props or
costumes’

The New York Times called
“Red Fox’”’ “as stirring to the
audience for its historical detec-
tive work as for the vanishing
art of frontier yarnspinning.’’
The Christian Science Monitor
said the performance ‘“‘was a
remarkable entertainment, the
likes of which New York folks
don’t encounter every day.”
The New Yorker said the story
was presented ‘quietly and
with no pretensions whatever,

but with talent and charm.”’

As a backdrop to the per-
formance, vintage slides help il-
lustrate the story.

Roadside Theatre was found-
ed by Baker and others in 1974
“to find and create a kind of
theatre that makes sense for the
mountains.” It has reached into
the back hollows, mining camps
and farm communities of the
Appalachian where ‘‘conven-
tional theatre seldom, if ever,
travels.”

The group is part of Ap-
palshop, a non-profit media
organization in Whitesburg,
Ky., that produces records,

Let’s face it, who can’t sing
“Y.M.C.A.”’ at the top of their
lungs while driving down the
highway.

6. Bee Gees ‘‘Tragedy”’

The Bee Gees do it again —
nothing short of a plane crash is
gonna stop these guys. The
words don’t match the melody
and feel of the song, but
flawless production and the
group’s writing skills pull this
one off with ease. Warning: the
high-pitched vocals may get on
your nerves after a while (ya
sure these guys are brothers? ).

7. Chic ‘Le Freak”

Without a doubt the most an-
noying thing about AM radio
over the past few months has
been the overwhelming suc-
cess, in both airplay and sales,
of ‘‘le Freak.’’ The song’s ap-
peal is quite frankly beyond
me; it doesn’t even work as a
novelty.

It’s groups like Chic that give
disco a bad name. The
teenybopper elitism inherent in
‘Le Freak”’ is so revolting that
it tends to stick in people’s
minds much longer than an in-
nocuous but well crafted single
like Earth, Wind, & Fire’s
“September.”

March in the Cockpit...

Although all the student
minds are concentrating on
Fancy Dress this weekend,
there will be plenty of entertain-
ment on campus this month.

The Skip Castro Band will
make its debut in the Cockpit on
March 14, a Wednesday night.
They play a very varied songlist
ranging from the Beatles to Ray
Charles, from Elvis Costello to
Otis Redding. In short, they are
a band that COOKS, and they
will receive plenty of exposure
on this campus in the next few
months. See them in the Pit

first, tho’, and tell all your
friends about them.

Friday, March 16 will feature
the good-time sound ofAce
Weems and the Fat Meat Boys.
Most of the student body
remembers the Fat Meat Boys
from their electrifying show at
the Library Party before the
Allstars. They feature the old
time fiddling of James Leva
and Chad Crumm and have yet
to play any place where people
did not dance and have fun.

Cockpit on St. Patrick’s Day.

warmly received by the crowd,
and thrilled them with the
sounds of Jimmy Buffett and
other folk favorites.

Chris Smither is a
singer/songwriter who comes
from the D. C. area and has
played for many different peo-
ple in many different settings.
Bonnie Raitt has done his songs,
and many others. He plays folk
guitar in the style of John Hurt
and Lightnin’ Hopkins. Look for
this guy — he is what Jackson
Browne was five years ago. The
date for the show is still in the
air at this time, however.

Wed., March 28 sees the
Chicken Spankers arrive in
Lexington for the first time.
They play predominantly old
time music with some modern
embellishments. The following
night, the Fiction Brothers will
perform. Flying Fish recording
artists, they have a record
where they play with Country
Cooking, a highly acclaimed
“newgrass” band. Howie Tar-
nower and Alan Senauke play
their guitars, mandolins and
banjo on many of their own
compositions, and are very en-
joyable.

The following night, March
30, Dodge d’Art will perform.
This Charlottesville three piece
band plays many of rock’s
greatest songs from the Sixties
— from the Animals, Beatles
and others, as well as original
compositions. This will be their
first appearance in the Cockpit,
and many of the students will
also hear them at the M.D.
Danceathon.

March certainly looks like it
will be a great month for music
in the Cockpit. Make your plans
now.

8. Nicolette Larson ‘Lotta
Love”’

“Lotta Love”’ is classic Neil
Young, and as such is one of the
loveliest, most addictive
melodies to hit top-40 so far this
year. Unfortunately, the same
slickness that allowed Nicolette
Larson’s version to top the
charts also served to undermine
some of the simple character of
the song, as revealed in Young’s
grittier acoustic version from
the Comes a Time album
(which, by the way, featured
Ms. Larson on_ background
vocals).

9. Barry Manilow
“Somewhere in the Night”

It starts out quietly, just
piano and vocals. Building up
slowly, the song reaches a
veritable crescendo, then fades
slowly into oblivion. But the
question remains: haven’t we

heard this before? Like, last
time, and the time before that,
and...?

Barry Manilow is basically
good at what he does, but he
might be well advised to start
doing it a little bit differently.
“Somewhere in the Night’’ is
throwaway pop of the most
pretentious sort.

10. Leif Garrett “I Was Made
For Dancin’”’

Leif Garrett is one of the chief
perpretrators of a new fad that
can best be described as ‘‘bub-
blegum disco.”’ His singles are
classic top-40 in every way;
light, disco-influenced numbers
with extremely catchy hooks
and just enough gimmickry and
flash to grab the youth market
without alienating the

housewives. If he just didn’t
sound so much like Robin Gibb
after a very painful and damag-
ing accident he might have
something. ~

Scott said that he told the ac-
cused he would have to live with
any decision he made and told
him ‘“‘you can’t be optimistic.”’

Sophomore representative
Willy Mackie said that he had
heard the story from several
sources, including the accused,
and that “the whole chain of
events was really quite dif-
ferent.”

Mackie said, ‘‘He (the accus-
ed) was concerned about what
he had done and you (Scott)
gave him the opinion that he
didn’t have a chance’’ before
the trial. ‘‘What was
represented to him was that
something happened and it was
automatic guilt.”

Mackie also said that he had

who told him not to ask him
about the proceedings.

Scott said that he was speak-
ing to him just as a friend, not
as a member of the committee.

Senior law representative
John Murphy then said, ‘‘He ap-
proached you (Scott) first as an
EC member, and it is hard for
his view of you to change. He
was still looking at your opinion
as revealing what the EC
thought.”

Junior. representative Steve
Abraham and Calvert both
questioned the testimony given
by the accused, pointing out
some discrepancies each time
Scott related his account of the
incident.

Junior representative Dee
Keesler said, “The story has
been watered down each time
Charlie has told it.’’

Scott said, “We are all
capable of making errors in
judgment and I deeply regret
making contact with the accus-
ed. I think the reprimand Rob
has proposed is severe, too
severe.”

Scott added, “I think I should
be allowed to admit my
mistakes and take my lumps
but I shouldn’t be kicked off the
committee for four weeks.”

When asked if he had been
drinking that night, Scott
said,”I wasn’t fully in control
(of myself) that night; I con-
sumed quite a bit of grain”

Law Election

Neal Brickman was the victor
in the election two weeks ago to
fill the first year law school
representative’s position on the
student Executive Committee.

Brickman compiled 46 votes
to Bevin Alexander’s 36 to win
the EC spot vacated by Jenelle
Mims one month ago.

Brickman was present at
Monday night’s EC meeting to
begin his term on the commit-

“tee.

before talking to the accused.

“I can assure the committee
that nothing of this nature will
ever happen again.”

The EC voted 8-1, with
Keesler voting against and Rob
Benfield abstenting, to suspend
Scott from the EC for four
weeks, starting then.

First year law representative
Neal Brickman expressed con-
cern for the lack of representa-
tion of the freshman class dur-
ing Scott’s absence, but the EC
could find no way to appoint so-
meone to the post temporarily.

Murphy pointed out that it
would be like the absence of law
school representatives during

Co-ed Course Offered

A course dealing with the role
of men and women in contem-
porary society will again be of-
fered during the spring term
this year.

Washington and Lee students
enrolled in the three credit
course, Interdepartmental 250,
will be required to live in a dor-
mitory on the Mary Baldwin
College campus for four weeks
with the girls taking the course.

The co-ed dorm is part of the
‘‘living-learning’’ experience of
the course, which will make an
in-depth examination of all
aspects of masculine and
feminine roles in American
society today and in other
cultures.

Five W&L professors and a
similar number of Mary
Baldwin professors will all
teach a part of the course,

which will be structured on lec- °

tures and panel discussions.
As now planned, students will

 

Rent Your Skis From Us

 

attend class Monday through
Thursday morning for two and
one-half hours. In addition,
there will be outside lectures,
films, and other activities.

It is hoped that the living
situation will foster out-of-class
discussions of the topics raised
during the day.

The course will be limited to a
total of 30 W&L and Mary
Baldwin students.

The University will pay for
the room, but not the meals.
Students on the dining hall meal
plan here can transfer their
credit to Mary Baldwin’s dining
hall for no extra charge.

Interested students should
see Dean Craun in his office in
Washington Hall to register.

Lax team pays back
EC with $1,000 gift

by Douglas Linton

The Varsity Lacrosse team is
pleased to make two favorable
reports. Along with the Florida
trip being a great success, the
team was also able to return
$1000 to the Executive Commit-
tee.

Through the generosity of an
anonymous gift, the team hand-
ed the E.C. a check to repay the
scandalous $1000 appropriation
made before winter break. The
matter caused numerous
unpleasant reactions on the
part of the student body. Head
Coach Jack Emmer was ‘‘very
happy to be able to return it.”’

The trip to Boca Raton went
like clockwork. The only pro-
blem, if it can be called such,
was. the long bus ride. The
players all stayed in one big
dormitory room and had an
11:30 p.m. curfew.

There were two practices dai-
ly. Workouts were divided into
two sessions, 2 hours each mor-
ning and about 1!» hours during
the afternoon. Since there were
no other teams down there, all
scrimmages were on an inters-
quad level. Nonetheless, the ac-
tion was quite fierce.

‘We had real good weather
and got a whole lot done that we
couldn’t have otherwise,’’ said
Emmer. He also felt that the
trip enabled him to get a better
look at many players, a view
impossible to obtain inside a
gymnasium. With all the extra
time spent on fundamental
skills and conditioning, Emmer
feels that ‘‘we have to be bet-
=.

The players all seemed to en-
joy themselves. Veterans
Roman Kupecky, John Herbert,
and Joe Olive all displayed their
consistently strong play, among
others. Freshman additions
Mike Pressler and Rob
Staugaitis both show lots of
potential. Coach Emmer also
felt that John Hooper had a
great week. He seemed to enjoy
the opportunity to hit people in
the open field. It was Hooper
who checked Perry Roberts and
broke his collarbone in three
places. Roberts’ injury was
viewed as unfortunate by Em-
mer, but also as ‘‘part of the
game.”

The Generals open their
season with an exhibition game
against the Chesapeake
Lacrosse Club on Saturday. The
contest may be played on
Wilson Field, but that will de-
pend on the weather, since the
field is so muddy. Alternatives
include playing on an upper
practice field, or possibly
traveling to Buena Vista.

Along with Mt. Washington,
Chesapeake is the club team to

beat this year. Coach Emmer
plans to experiement and “try
to get a look at everybody” as
he uses this foreign opposition
to find any weak areas in the
Generals’ game.

Generals lose to Lynchburg

began way back on November
24, finally ended when the

the Generals, the Lynchburg

losses in three of their last four
games.

exist as they lost to Maryville
on February 17, 80-68. The

Indoor track season ends —

outdoor track to start Mar. 9

by Greg Branan

The Washington and Lee
Generals’ indoor track team cut
their winter break in half and
managed a third place team
finish in last Saturday’s ODAC
Championship meet at Lyn-
chburg College.

Coach Norris Aldridge spoke
about the meet saying, ‘‘We did
as well as_ expected.’’
Bridgewater and Lynchburg
dominated the meet, exchang-
ing first place throughout the
meet. The final tally gave
Bridgewater-78, Lynchburg-70,
W&L-36, Emory and Henry-32,
and Roanoke-21.

Aldridge noted, ‘‘Emory and
Henry took points in the sprints
and Bridgewater took a man off
basketball who scored three
firsts, 18 points.’’ These proved
to be the difference in a few
events W&L had planned to
score in.

Top performer for W&L was
tri-captain, Jack Norberg.
Norberg scored first in the 440,
second in the 60, was a member
of the winning mile relay team
and the second place 440 relay
team. His 51.5 time in the open
440 is a new ODAC record sur-
passing the old mark of 52.3.

- Other members of the winn-
ing mile relay team were
Stewart Atkinson, Ron Calkins,
and Dave Cordell. Those on the
400 relay team were Norberg,
Atkinson, Jeff Brown and Chris
Leiser.

Other point getters included
freshman Russ Rector, fifth in
the high jump and high hurdles,
Chris Daniel, third in the 880,
Chris Leiser, fourth in the 60
and the two-mile relay team of
Henry Hairston, Chris Daniel,
Paul Hendry and Billy Morris
came in fourth. In the field
events Phil Dunlay took second
in the 35-pound weight and fifth
in the shot-put, Moose Mrlik,
placed fifth in the 35-pound
weight and Bob Campbell plac-
ed fifth in the pole vault.

Coach Aldridge reiterated,
“We start in January, later
than other teams, and so the in-
door season is used as a
building up season for outdoor
track.” Outdoor track gets
underway March 9 at home
against Roanoke and Liberty
Baptist. Aldridge added, ‘‘The
outdoor season is usually
stronger than the indoor season.
Reasons include new events
such as the 220, intermediate

hurdles, discus and javelin
which are events we have depth
and experience in.’’ The season
appears to be tough with meets
against improved Liberty Bap-
tist, Emory and Henry, and
Davidson teams, as well as
always strong Wake Forest.
This difficult schedule might
not show that this year’s team is
“as good or better than last
year’s,”’ as Coach Aldridge has
stated.

the score of 85-77. 85 points turn-
ed out to be an ominous total for
Washington and Lee, as they
would find out against Lyn-
chburg.

Because the Generals and
Lynchburg had identical 7-3
ODAC records, a coin toss was
held to determine who would
receive the first round bye in
the tourney. Lynchburg won
and W&L, being the third-
seeded team, played the sixth-
seeded team, which turned out
to be the hometown
Bridgewater Eagles.

W&L appeared to be heading
for their third consecutive loss
as they trailed at halftime 44-43.
However, 59 percent shooting in
the next twenty minutes enabl-
ed the Generals to gain a
rematch with Lynchburg by
beating Bridgewater 81-75. Tom
Jeffries paced W&L with 18
points.

The next night, February 23,
came the most heated rivalry in
the ODAC as W&L took on Lyn-
chburg. W&L was_ playing
without center Ardith Collins,
who had broken his right elbow
while trying to block a shot
against Bridgewater. The loss
of Collins made a definite dif-
ference in the game. In his last
game against Lynchburg, Col-
lins dominated the game by
pulling down fifteen rebounds
and blocking five shots.

The Generals appeared to
have the game under control by
holding a 79-74 lead with two
minutes to play. Then center E.
D. Schechterly of Lynchburg
personally outscored the W&L
11-5, and his layup with 35
seconds left won the game. The
Generals had one more chance
to win but they took three shots
and none would fall. Pete Far-
rell’s last second jumper bounc-
ed in and out of the basket and
went halfway through before
popping out. For the third time
this year, Farrell was left
holding the bag by missing the
final shot.

The Lynchburg victory, only
their second in the last ten en-
counters with W&L (and both
were this year), ended the
Generals’ hopes of a_ third
straight ODAC title and a fifth

SID Bill Schnier

to take position
at Old Dominion

by Bill Whalen

According to an _ article
printed in the Lexington News-
Gazette on February 21,
Washington & Lee Sports In-
formation Director William R.
“Bill” Schnier has resigned his
post to become the new Sports
Information Director at Old
Dominion University. Schnier’s
resignation is effective April 6,
when the current semester
ends. Schnier will begin his
duties at the Norfolk, Virginia
school on April 9.

Having been appointed to his
position at W&L in 1976, Schnier
has revamped the W&L Sports
Information Office to the point
where it has received national
attention as one of the best Divi-
sion III organizations. Thirteen
of his brochures have received
citations from the College
Sports Information Directors of
America. Five of these
brochures have earned “Best in
the Nation’ awards for ex-
cellence.

Besides preparing these
brochures, Schnier also keeps
statistics on all W&L varsit™
sports and handles all press
releases. He also is in charge of
the press boxes at the Generals’

deserved it more than H-SC’s L.

ODAC tourney

Franke is Co-Coach of year

by Chris Sisto

Last week the Washington
and Lee wrestling team came
away with several honors that
distingushed them as the best of
the winter here. The Generals
won ODAC Conference Tourna-
ment at Lynchburg College and
became the first team at W&L

to win a conference champion- .

ship this year.

Also at the tournament Coach
Gary Franke of the Generals
was named co-Coach of the
Year for the second year of his
six year coaching tenure at
W&L.

The league title was the third
straight for the Generals in the
three years of the ODAC. The
Generals are also undefeated in
dual meet play in the history of
the ODAC. The strength of the
win came.on Joe Wallace’s pin
at the heavyweight class. His
win, the last final weight class
of the tournament, gave the
Generals a seven point victory.
The Generals finished with 86%
points followed by Lynchburg
with 7934, Hampden-Sydney 49,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On EC

Marathons

With the biggest social weekend of the year now
upon us, you would expect the SAB to become the only
source of campus activity. Not so...last Monday, the
EC met for a marathon three hours — their longest
meeting since budget hearings in the fall — in one of
the most heated sessions of the year.

At that meeting, still another grade review proposal
was debated and passed. The Ring-tum Phi has
previously gone on record as an advocate of some
sort of grade review, and it is our hope that a
reasonable proposal will be passed by both EC and
faculty this year. Unfortunately, we doubt that the
EC’s present proposal has much chance of success in
a faculty vote.

Previously, the EC suggested that the authority to
overturn an unjust grade be placed in the hands of the
head of the department involved. Hopefully, he would
possess the necessary knowledge to judge a student’s
case. But the new motion provides for a 5-man com-
mittee of faculty ‘‘grade-reviewers,’’ and it is likely
that none of them will feel they have sufficient exper-
tise to change the decision of a professor in another
department. Even more, such a proposal may cause
unnecessary conflict and resentment among the
faculty as a whole. We strongly suggest that some
other alternative be found by the EC...The faculty
fangs are going to love chewing up this latest idea.

* EK

In an even more astounding action, the EC voted to
suspend one of its own members for one month for
revealing details of an honor investigation to a friend
under accusation. To our knowledge, this hasn’t been
done in many years — and it’s no.easy task at any
time.

I suppose it’s only human to sympathize with the
suspended member who, caught off guard, forgets the
all-important distinction between ‘‘friend’’ and
“elected official.’ Still, the EC’s action was fully
predictable and typical of their serious concern for all
aspects of the Honor System. As one student said, ‘‘A
crack in the chain just can’t be allowed.’’ At any rate,
we hope this is a lesson that won't call for repetition —
depriving, as it does, an entire class of EC representa-

tion.

Dear Editor:

I was shocked by the editorial ‘‘A question
of honor’ from your last issue.

First, I was surprised by your general lack
of compassion for this fellow student. He’s
been through a lot, and deserves the right to
complete his last half year. You should at
least grant him that before kicking him into
the mud.

More importantly, I question your reason-
ing and interpretation of honor. There have
been a number of obvious honor violations
which were never prosecuted. One, several
years back, involved the firing of a fire ex-
tinguisher in an old woman’s face at a
neighboring girls school. I realize that ‘‘good
fun”’ like this is not covered in the White Book,

but things like this offend our dignity and I
challenge anyone to call it honorable. The
other involved a student throwing a bottle at
the UVa bench during a lacrosse game (we
were even winning by 7 or 8 goals). This ac-
tion was not only disgusting but illegal.

These actions made me ashamed to be a
student here. But, they were honorable
enough by our conventions to escape serious
punishment. Throwing someone out of school
is a serious matter (ask the E.C.) and it is
unbelievable that the editor is getting involv-
ed in this matter. I wonder what our definition
of honorable is, too. I don’t think it is very
honorable to begin our search with a purge of
this student any more than purging our noise
violation convicts.

Legal Consultant Clarifies Point

Dear Editor:

In the article entitled ‘‘Students Who Took
Their Landlord to Court and Won,” which ap-
peared in the February 15th edition of The
Ring-tum Phi, it was stated that, as a conse-
quence of her tenants’ enforcing against her,
by legal proceedings, the duty to make pro-
mised repairs, the landlady will, in the future,
attach an addendum to all of her leases ab-
solving her from all responsibility to make
repairs. It should be noted that, where the
Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
applies, such a general disclaimer is ineffec-
tual.

The Virginia Residential Landlord and Te-
nant Act requires the landlord to ‘‘[c] comply
with the requirements of applicable [local]
building and housing codes materially affec-
ting health and safety,” to ‘‘m Jake all
repairs and do whatever is necessary to put
and keep the premises in a fit and habitable
condition,” and to ‘‘ m Jaintain in good and
safe working order and condition all elec-
trical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ven-
tilating, air-conditioning and other facilities
and appliances. . . supplied or required to be
supplied by him.’’ However, the tenant can be
made to assume responsibility for ‘specified
repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations and
remodeling” (emphasis added) if he assents
to provisions in a written lease or other
writing that so provide.

As I stated in my article entitled
“Understanding a Lease and What it
Covers,” which appeared in the February
15th edition of The Ring-tum Phi, the provi-

Dear Editor:
Many people on this campus, as well as

many members of this town, are under a
great misconception about fraternities at W &
L. These people think frats consist entirely of
spoiled rich kids who have unlimited financial
reserves. This, however, is the exception
rather than the rule. Many frat members pay
for their dues out of their own pocket or
through financial loans. Nevertheless,
regardless of where the money comes from,
paying anywhere from $1,000 to $1,700 per
year just to be in a house is not cheap. Not
everyone can afford to be a member, and
many make great financial sacrifices to stay
active.

Frats, as a whole, don’t have unlimited
funds either. Several houses are currently
taking a “financial bath,’”’ and the ‘“‘rich”
house has become a dying species. Yet, many
students mooch off frats at their social func-
tions as if they were some sort of charity
events.

Being a ‘‘guest”’ in a frat house (regardless
of whether you’re a member of another frat or
not) is a privilege, not a right. Frats can close

exceptions. This should lead the alert reader
to conclude that Mrs. Brown, the landlady in
question, may not effectively disclaim all
liability for repairs by amending her form of
lease.

This incapacity is stated in statutory form
in section 55-248.9 of the Code of Virginia: ‘‘A
rental agreement lease] shall not contain
provisions that the tenant. . . a]grees to the
exculpation or limitation of any liability of the
landlord to the tenant arising under law. . .
A]provision prohibited by ... this section in-
cluded in a rental agreement is unen-
forceable...’’

The reader should be aware that the
Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act
governs all apartment rentals. The only ex-
ception to this statement that is of importance
to The Ring-tum Phi’s readership is apart-
ments which the university rents to students.
The Act does not apply to them. (If a law does
not apply to a given situation or condition,
then the law neither confers benefits, imposes
obligations, nor operates in any manner upon
the parties as to whom it does not apply. As to
them, it is as if the law did not exist.) The Act
also does not apply to rented one-family
houses that are used and occupied as one-
family houses.

For example, if one group of students rents
an entire house as a group, under a single
lease, the Act does not apply to that sitaution;
and the lease that the group obtains from the
landlord will, for the most part, define the
rights and obligations existing between the
group members and the landlord. But if two
or more differnet parts of a house are rented
to different tenants or groups of tenants,
under separate leases, then the Act does app-
ly.

Yours sincerely,

their doors anytime to anyone they choose.
They pay for the parties, it is their house; and
it is their decision as to who can attend their
functions. Contrary to popular belief the
University does not finance these parties;
consequently, they are not meant to be
“university” social functions.

A final intangible is the entertainment fac-
tor. The frat members pay ‘“‘out the nose”’ so
you can have a good time, but how many
times have you thanked them for it, how
many times have you offered to help cover
their costs, how many times have you offered
to clean up after the party was over, how
many times has it even entered your mind? In
my experience, not often; but it is greatly ap-
preciated when such miracles happen.

Therefore, I would like to make a small sug-
gestion to all of you who by some rare chance
find nothing to do around here and just decide
to drop in on one of the frat parties (whether
you’re a frat member or a non-member) —
Don’t abuse your privilege! It can be taken
away.

Grade Review

(continued from page 1)
fessors.
Deadlock Over
Proposal

Discussion began with a pro-
posal by junior representative
Steve Abraham that a commit-
tee of faculty and students be
formed to review grade
disputes. ‘‘This might alleviate
some of the problems of depart-
ment heads not dealing with
complaints,” he said.

But under Abraham’s pro-
posal, the joint student-faculty
grade review committee would
not have the power to overturn
the professor’s grade.

“Schools that have commit-
tees like that seem to have them
break down,”’ said Will Mackie’
sophomore rep.

“But we can’t tell teachers
how to do their job,’’ Abraham
responded. ‘‘No teacher at this
school would like being told how
to grade.”’

‘“‘Faculty members would feel
it an infringement on _ their
rights to have their grades over-
turned,’’ Bill Tucker, EC vice
president said.

“If it doesn’t have the power
to overturn grades, then it (the
committee) wouldn’t achieve

‘much,”’ Mackie said

“Telling a professor that he
has to come before a committee
of appointed students and ap-
pointed faculty is not going to be
accepted warmly,” Brickman
added.

‘“‘We should be realistic about
what we can get through,”
Tucker said.

After some debate, third-year
law school representative John
Murphy recommended that the
grade review proposal be pass-

ed in its latest form (with the
‘ department head acting as an
intermediary between the pro-
fessor and the student).

It was at this point that
Brickman brought out his idea
for an all-faculty committee.

Such a committee would ‘‘get
rid of the outlandish claims’’
that might be made by students
complaining about trivial or
farfetched grading practices.

“Only legitimate claims
would be heard and professors
would be more willing to go
before a committee of peers,”
Brickman said.

Under Brickman’s plan,
students would petition the
standing five-man faculty com-
mittee, a convenient hearing
date would be set for the pro-
fessor and the student to pre-
sent their sides, and the five-
man board would have the
power to overturn a colleague’s
grade.

‘‘There’s a chance that no one
will want to serve on a commit-
tee like this,’ cautioned Rob
Calvert, senior EC represen-
tative, “‘but they should be re-
quired to serve”’ on such a com-
mittee.

The student Executive Com-
mittee voted unanimously to ac-
cept Brickman’s proposal.

After its defeat by the faculty
EC Tuesday, the new grade
review plan will probably come
before the University Council
this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. in
Payne Hall 2.

The faculty next meets as a
group Monday, and that faculty
meeting will be the last chance
to adopt a grade review system
before the semester is over.

 

Latest Student EC Variation To
The Grade Review Proposal

(Rejected By Faculty EC 8-2)

“It is the responsibility of each professor to:

i Provide at the beginning of the course a tentative schedule of
assignments and a description of how the final grade will be deter-

mined.

2. Be willing to discuss and review all aspects of a student’s grade
throughout within a reasonable time after receipt of the grade.

3. Retain throughout the next term all graded material not returned

to the student.

Any student believing that his work has been unfairly evaluated
has the right to bring the matter to the attention ofa standing com-
mittee of five faculty members. A closed hearing will then be held
at which the committee shall discuss the grade with the professor
and the student involved. The faculty committee shall be em-
powered to change a student's grade when a majority of the com-

mittee deems it appropriate.

EC

(continued from page 1)

Gallagher encouraged the
committee to act in behalf of the
student body. He recommended
that the EC present a copy of
the petition to William D.
McHenry, athletic director, and
to the University administra-
tion, ‘‘otherwise he’ll
(McHenry) throw it in the
trash,’’ Gallagher said.

The EC agreed to form a
“liaison committee’ to present
the petition to McHenry in the
hope that guidelines for gym
use will be set up to allow more
students access to the basket-
ball courts.

More Noise

A Washington and Lee
University student was found
guilty of violating Lexington’s
noise ordinance.

Henry Young Hamilton,
president of Kappa Alpha, pled
guilty to violating the ordinance
on Sunday, January 21, at 1:15
a.m.

Hamilton was fined $15 and
court costs.

Hamilton told the court that
the fraternity had a band play-
ing and that their party had
started late and thus was play-
ing beyond the time their noise
permit allowed.

Arresting officer John K. Col-
bert said that Hamilton had the
band stop playing at his first re-
quest.

Judge Joseph E. Hess
sentenced Hamilton to pay a
small fine, saying, ‘I’ve been
starting these things with
minimum fines.”

He implied that further viola-
tions would result in higher
fines.
