Fraternity President Arrested

Lexington’s Noise Ordinance brings
early end to Saturday night party

by Randy Smith

The president of Sigma Chi
fraternity, Tim Brooks, was ar-
rested Saturday night by Lex-
ington police for violation of the
city’s noise ordinance.

Saturday night’s arrest
represents the most severe ac-
tion taken thus far by the Lex-
ington police department in en-
forcing the city’s noise laws.

In a court hearing on the case
Tuesday morning, Judge
Joseph E. Hess of the Lexington
General District Court dismiss-
ed the charges against Brooks
and cautioned Lexington police
officers to use their “ex-
perience and discretion”’ in is-

suing arrest warrants for viola-
tion of the city’s noise ordinance
in the future.

Three times in one week

Brooks had received a warn-
ing that the music was too loud
at a Sigma Chi party the
previous Tuesday. Later that
evening he was given a sum-
mons to appear in court for
violation of Lexington’s noise
law.

City ordinance 15-32(b) for-
bids noise more than 50 feet
from its point of origin between
the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.
Violation of the law can carry a
penalty of up to $1,000 and/or
one year in jail.

Brooks was not given a warn-
ing Saturday night, however,
and was arrested shortly after
he turned on his fraternity’s
stereo system at 11:15 p.m.

The arresting officer was
Lexington policeman Jack C.
Purvis, who had also issued a
summons to Brooks and Sigma
Phi Epsilon president Larry
Bryant on Sept. 5.

In court Tuesday morning,
Brooks pleaded not guilty to
both charges.

not as an approval of violating
the noise ordinance, Brooks

Leach has devised a way of
transfering McCormick
Library’s 250,000 volumes to the
new facility. As soon as exams
are completed (Dec. 15), the
move will begin; for the next 3
weeks, items such as the card
catalog, bound periodicals and
oversize books, and 40-50% of
the stack books will leave Mc-
Cormick. University employees
will carry out most of this first
phase.

But ‘“‘phase two” is a com-
pletely different story, ac-
cording to Leach. At the first
faculty meeting in October,
there will be a request to sus-
pend all classes on Wednesday,
January 10. On this day,
students, faculty, and
townspeople will be invited to
assist in moving the remainder
of the books—as Leach calls it,
“a total W&L project,”’ capable
only on a campus of this size
and character.

Leach has conferred with all
but two academic departments
on the “moving day”’ plan, and
is encouraged by the en-
thusiastic response down the
line.

How will the move be ac-
complished? As Leach describ-
ed it, “There will be so many
lines of people, all coded in
some way. By charts which we
have been working on for some
10 months, they will know ex-
actly where each book is to be

New Library to be Completed by Christmas

Where the

departments
will relocate

With the new undergraduate
library set for completion at
Christmas, the first major step
has been made in what will be a
series of ‘‘departmental
jumps” around campus. For
the past several years, pro-
fessors and students alike have
speculated on the subject of
where it all will end. And now,
the first serious planning on
that subject is set to occur. The
Phi, after days of interviews
with dozens of university
figures, is pleased to announce
the findings of that research.

Plans are already being made
in the School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics for
their move to McCormick

‘Library. Renovation of that

building is to begin immediate-
ly after the library move ac-
cording to Dean Lewis John.
This project is expected to take
no longer than 18 months; so a
fall, 1980 movement time for the
commerce school is likely.
Along with this major move,
several facets of the project are
definite. One is the eventual
transformation of DuPont Hall
into a music-art building. Dr.
Albert Gordon’s plans call for
all the music facilities in Mc-
Cormick to move into DuPont at

Ring-tum Phi Interview

 

Jim Davis speaks out on Rush

The _ Interfraternity Council
reported Tuesday night that 393
students registered for this year’s
fraternity rush which includes
nintey-nine percent of _ the
freshman class. Because of the
importance of this yearly ritual,
the Ring-tum Phi interviewed
Jim Davis, IFC president, for his
general thoughts on the fraternity
rush process at Washington and
Lee.

Q:There have been a number
of changes this year in fraterni-
ty rush, particularly in the
length of rush itself. Can you ex-
plain some of this and the
reasons behind the changes?

Davis: The biggest change is
that there is now one week in
between open houses and the
first rush dates. Last year, the
open houses were held on the
weekends and then the first
rush dates were the next
Wednesday. This year, there is
time for people to see a lot more
of the fraternity houses and get
to know more people.

The administration was also
unhappy about having a rush
date last year the night before
classes began, and lots of
freshmen didn’t show up for the
first day of classes. So we’ve
compromised with the Ad-
ministration to have contact

 

Jim Davis, IFC President, speaks with news staff in this issue.

Q: The rush system itself
seems very short and intensive.
Do you think one week is a long
enough time for fraternities to
get to know freshmen or for
freshmen to make up their
minds about fraternities?

Davis: Yes, I think most
freshmen should be able to
make up their minds within one

their minds.

Q: If rush is such an impor-
tant decision for a freshman, do
you think he will learn enough
to make the proper decision in
just one week?

Davis: If rush were drawn out
over a longer period of time,
most houses would just have a

“The process of rush is the best opportunity at

Washington and Lee to meet a large number of
people in such a short period of time.”

ed procedure, so it was extend-
ed. But now no one feels that an
extension of more than a week
is really necessary.

However, the extension this
year is basically an experi-
ment. It could lead to a further
lengthening of the rush process
in the future.

It’s hard to get feedback on
the effectiveness of rush,
though. Most of the freshmen
are satisfied once they join a
house and they forget about the
hassle they went through.

Washington and Lee?

Davis: The process of rush is
the best opportunity at
Washington and Lee to meet a
large number of people in such
a short period of time. It’s also
unique in that all fraternities
are cordial to one another after
rush ends. You can have friends
in all houses and not be isolated
from them. It makes for a more
close-knit community.

Q: What about the enforce-
ment of rush violations?

“Rush is a state of mind that
the fraternity has.”

 

Q: What about the idea of
having rush in winter term,
after Christmas break, as a way
of getting to know the freshmen
better and not making rush so
intensive?

Davis: That idea was brought
up, but was quickly dismissed
when houses pointed out the
financial side of rush. Basical-
ly, houses need the freshmen,
and they need the money from
the freshmen’s dues. That’s
why rush isn’t after Christmas:
houses need the money sooner
than that to survive.

Q: What would you consider
unique about the rush system at

Davis: The fraternities pro-
vide a good check and balance
in a lot cf instances where the
IFC cannot really police things.
Everybody wants to see a fair
rush and are perfectly willing to
report any blatant violations.
It’s something they themselves
will refrain from doing because
they don’t think it’s fair.

I think we've given frater-

nities a bit more freedom this
year in rush. We're asking them
to use their own discretion in
following the rules of rush tak-
ing the burden off the IFC and
making rush less regulated and
more loose and relaxed.

joining a particular house,
weighs heavily on a freshman’s

longer facade. Rush is a state of
mind that the fraternity has.
The houses are out to show their
best faces and out to be as
friendly as possible to the
freshmen. I think that their
friendliness would continue as
long as they thought they had to
for rush.

Also, there has always tradi-
tionally been a short intensive
rush period at the beginning of
school. Many houses last year
thought rush was a really rush-

Fraternity

Last spring, the Board of
Trustees and the Administra-
tion began emphasizing the
need for improvement in the ap-
pearance and safety features of
fraternities. According to Dan
Murphy,, Assistant Dean in
charge of fraternity affairs,
“Our main concerns are for the
safety and health of fraternity
members.”’ The school ac-
tively supported this position by
making $150,000 in loans to
various fraternities to finance
new construction. These loans
bring the school’s total invest-
ment in fraternities to $650,000.

Most of the problems lie in the
area of safety and health,
especially fire safety. The
deteriorated condition of the
outside of several houses was
also the target of criticism.
Murphy says, ‘‘The fraternities
represent W&L. The poor ap-
pearance of houses hurts the

Late Story:

The Ring-tum Phi has ‘earned
that the Student Activities
Board (SAB), the student com-
mittee that arranged entertain-
ment for the school, ended last
year with a $1,700 deficit.

In the confusion of last year’s
Fancy Dress and the Hulfish
scandal, a number of checks
went unrecorded resulting in
the accounting error, possibly

because the treasurer, Jim
Foreman, quit about that time.

In addition, Calyx, the year-
book, went $2,275 overbudget.

Both deficits were covered by
the Student Body reserve fund.

Details of the budget over-
runs will come out at Monday’s
Executive Committee meeting
which the Ring-tum Phi will
cover for next week’s issue.

school’s alumni relations, rela-

tions with the town, as well as
efforts to recruit new students.”’

Each fraternity was given a
spot inspection and received a
list of priority items. Some
items required immediate at-
tention while others were long
range in nature. The frater-
nities are required to file pro-
gress reports with the school
and are subject to disciplinary
action for noncompliance.

Over the summer, several
houses made improvements
which bring them in line with
school standards. Both FIJI and
Lambda Chi are in the process
of having fire escapes installed.
Delta Tau Delta had a panic bar
placed on their back door and
Sigma Nu had their electrical
systems rewired in order to
meet fire safety standards.
Plumbing and gutter work were
also common, with Pi Kappa
Phi, Phi Delta Theta, K A,

Lambda Chi, FIJI, and SPE all
having some kind of work done.

Many fraternities took steps
to improve their appearance.
SPE had their exterior painted
and did extensive plaster work
inside. Pi Kappa Phi and Phi
Kappa Sigma both installed
new roofs and had work done on
eves and shudders. Pi Kappa
Phi and Sigma Nu had exten-
sive interior plasterwork done
to repair old walls, while Sigma
Nu and Phi Delta Theta had
their balconies and columns
repaired and painted.

Dan Murphy is pleased with
the progress fraternities have
made towards reflecting a more
favorable image of the school.
He says, ‘Fraternities are
strongly supported and _ en-
couraged by the school but must
live up to responsible standards
for this relationship to continue
into the future.”’

site of the language lab is slated
to become the Music 151
classroom, and the listening
room will occupy DuPont 205.
(These two operations are
presently taking place in one
overcrowded room of McCor-
mick.) The remainder of Du-
Pont will contain the following
features: basement—an office
for W&L’s cramped artist-in-
residence, Prof. Ju; second
floor-studio-offices for music
faculty and all music practice
facilities from the University
Center Basement; third floor -
tentatively scheduled for
transformation into one large
rehearsal hall for music and
drama.

The major exit from DuPont
Hall will be by the psychology
department. (German and
philosophy have been moved in
the past year.) The laboratory
rats, and their cohorts, are
scheduled to take the entire
basement level of Tucker Hall
as their new home—bumping
the entire computer center into
the ground floor of that facility.
German and romance
languages will continue to fill
the upper floors of Tucker Hall.
(The changes outlined here are

scheduled to take place after
the 1978-79 academic year.)

If you have remained alert in
the midst of this chaos, you
should have noticed that we left
the language lab without a
home several paragraphs
earlier. Rest assured that they
found a new one over the sum-
mer. Old-timers call it the moot
courtroom in Tucker Hall;
those more recent know it
primarily as the place where
Dr. Futch holds court. At any
rate, Professor Russell Knud-
son and his lab are now perched
at the top of Tucker with the
best view of the new library.

The double-size, all-carpeted
language lab was designed en-
tirely by Knudson and
represents, in his words, ‘‘a top-
notch facility, the best that
money can buy.”’ He noted the
university’s encouraging at-
titude toward the liberal arts:
“There were really no holds
barred. From a separate visual
area to a soundproofed recor-
ding studio, I can say it is one of
the greatest facilities of its
kind.”

Knudson, who has been work-
ing on this transfer literally
every day since commence-
ment in June, saved his

Rush Fines Set

Three of Washington and
Lee’s social fraternities receiv-
ed major fines from the Inter-
fraternity Council’s (IFC)
Judicial Board for violation of
the IFC’s Rush regulations.

Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau
fraternities were fined $150 for
having members in_ the
freshman dormatories at the
improper time.

Phi Kappa Sigma and Delta
Tau Delta were both fined $20
because members were drink-
ing hard alcohol during the

Saturday night open houses.
The original fine for such an of-
fense was $150, but was reduced
because of a misunderstanding
of the rule. The Judicial Board
has now ruled that there will be
no consumption of hard alcohol
by fraternity members at the
remaining rush functions; beer
will be permitted.

Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
was also fined $20 because their
rush official passed out from
drunkenness while performing
his duties at Pi Kappa Phi
Saturday night.

as it will be next summer:
psychology, languages, com-
puters.

At the other end of the Colon-
nade is the building most in
need of structural restoration:
Newcomb Hall. When this
structure is vacant (approx. fall
1980), we enter another phase of
the university’s planning. In the
words of Frank Parsons, assis-
tant to the President, “No
departments have _ been
definitely assigned space in
Newcomb”’ (which will require
a good deal of repair work).
“However, we do intend to
make it available to the
‘homeless departments’ in the
College.”’

The “homeless departments”
are those scattered aimlessly
about the campus. And when
you think of these, the likely
favorite appears to be history,
the largest of them all. Though
strictly tentative, it is true that
a history move would free
spaces all over campus for use
by other operations. (Other
departments mentioned by Par-

sons as_ candidates for
Newcomb Hall include
philosophy, sociology, or
classics. )

In the meantime, there has
been a great exodus from
Washington Hall. The entire

Dean of Students operation
(Deans John, Huntley, Murphy,
Mrs. Miller) is now at the rear
of Payne Hall. According to
Dean Jo “We've been era

fill the entire suite of
Washington Hall, but Dean
John and friends may not be in
Payne Hall forever. It is rumor
only (but a persistent one) that
if the history department
vacated the top floor of
Washington Hall, the Dean of
Students might return to the
central building in that location.
The game goes onward—by
now we have reached beyond
the three to four year mark. But
there is no end to conjecture:
restoration of DuPont and
Tucker Annexes back into their
original use as faculty homes;
the use of one of the two an-
nexes aS a separate ‘‘admis-
sions house,” getting that
operation out of the
mainstream of traffic
altogether; increased student
office space in the student
center basement—and so forth
The facts on these changes
are legion; worse than confus-
ing, they are often contradic-
tory. Even so, with restoration
of McCormick library set for
early 1979, many professors will
begin to dust off the furniture
for a move of some sort. It is,
without a doubt, the most in-

ever performed for the com-
munity. Whether the dust will

New Theater Building Approved

Possible site is near old railroad station

Dr. Albert Gordon, Chairman
of the Fine Arts Department at
W&L, recently announced that
investigation has finally begun
into the proposed building of a
new drama center. In the
spring, the Board of Trustees
officially recognized the need
for such a facility. And after
further research, an architect
will soon be arriving to examine
several tentative sites for a new
theatre building.

Of all the probable areas, the
prominent site to be examined
at this time is a tract of land on
Nelson St. behind Doremus
Gymnasium, adjacent to the old
railroad station. The station is
already owned by the university
and is used for storage by the
drama department. One of
several tentative plans calls for
restoration of the railroad sta-
tion as drama offices and
classrooms, next to the
auditorium facility.

At this time, there are no
funds raised for such a project,
but it is important to note that
this drama complex is the only
new building comtemplated for
construction in the near future.

According to University of-
ficials, there are several ad-
vantages to the Nelson St. loca-
tion. Aside from the presence of
the station building, the slight

   

    
      

distance from the main campus
would make a freer architec-
tural style possible. In addition,
outlying parking facilities
would be available for the many
activities possible in a larger
theatre.

The drama department cur-
rently exists in the Troubadour
Theatre (a former livery stabie
and, according to stories, a
bordello) and the Boiler
Room—named for its earlier
life as the basement of a laun-
dry. To say that the facilities
are grossly inadequate would
stop short of understatement,
but an inventive faculty has us-
ed them in a variety of novel
ways—in productions from
King Lear, Othello, and The
Tempest, to Uncle Vanya,
Three Penny Opera, A Street-
car Named Desire, and Death
of a Salesman. Starting in 1965
with the arrival of professor
Lee Kahn, shop space was ex-
panded, a lobby was built on the
Troubadour, and the Boiler
Room was rented in 1976.

Even so, all have been aware
that these are but temporary
solutions—especially with the
W&L drama program growing
significantly year by year. Long
before the Board of Trustees
voted its approval to further
research, Dr. Gordon had a
description of the ideal teaching

  

facility for W&L Theatre:

*a large proscenium-thrust
auditorium to seat approx-
imately 300 people.

*a smaller, black-box or “‘ex-
perimental’’ theater to seat 100.

*rehearsal hall and offices.

“increased shop space, with
some separation for costume,
props, and make-up facilities
(most of this occurs in one room

at present).
*a “green room’’ or actor’s
lounge.

*classrooms for design, direc-
ting, etc. (classes are presently
taught in the Troubadour lob-
by...)

The emphasis in this plan is
not a huge building, but one of
many uses. Above all, a

teaching place. Gordon and
university officials are en-
couraged by the Board’s
positive response to the pro-
gram’s needs. Until site
research is complete, no
designs or fund-drives will oc-
cur, but for the first time, the
spirit is one of optimism and
hopefulness at the University
Theatre.

Cavalier Daily Goes Independent

CHARLOTTESVILLE - The
editors of the University of
Virginia’s student newspaper,
the Cavalier Daily, have decid-
ed to operate this year without
any university funds so that
they can receive salaries.

The decision comes after an
administrative committee rul-
ed last spring that editors of the
newspaper would not receive
salaries.

Usually the Cavalier Daily, or
CD, receives about $30,000 of its
$200,000 annual operating
budget from the student activi-
ty fund. Such financial support
gave the student activites com-
mittee, headed by an associate
dean of students, the right to
rule against editors’ salaries.

Chi Psi’s Dilemma

Chi Psi is W&L’s newest
fraternal organization. Found-
ed in 1977, this colony has sear-
ched out several locations in its
desire for a house.

After several refusals, a solu-
tion seemingly appeared as Chi
Psi (through the university)
began to negotiote for the rental
of the deserted Ann Smith
school, across from the post of-
fice. But just as the final plans
became certain, the Chi Psi’s
have found themselves blocked
from immediate occupancy.

Even after city council ap-
proval of the Washington and
Lee purchase bid of $130,000
(theirs was the only bid), the ci-
ty attorney has been unable to
declare Chi Psi’s occupancy an
acceptable use of the land.

Fraternities, at this point, are
not yet covered sufficiently on
the city’s newest zoning or-
dinances. Some question re-
mains on whether the fraternity
can lease commercially-zoned
property.

In tracing the records, it can
be seen that no fraternity has
bought or leased any new pro-
perty for some 15-20 years. The
city zoning ordinances were
drawn up after that time, and
made no provision for future
fraternity expansion.

The final decision will remain
unclear until a special hearing
of the City Planning
Commission—scheduled for
Monday, September 25 at 5

p.m.—can meet on the matter.
Its recommendation will go
directly to the Lexington City
Council, where the matter will
reach a final vote in early Oc-
tober.

At the August 10 meeting of
the City Council, the body ap-
proved W&L’s $130,000 bid by a
majority of 4-2. If the City Plan-
ning Commission report is
favorable, the Council may
very well repeat its earlier vote
(Ben Lewis and Taylor Woody
dissenting). The two opponents
felt that the property and land
were in the $175,000-range,
regardless of the fact that W&L
offered the sole bid.

The primary opponent to Chi
Psi’s occupation of the site is St.
Patrick’s Catholic Church. At
the August 10 meeting, Father
Francis Sullivan expressed his
concern over traffic, conges-
tion, and parking problems.
Also, the church holds a Satur-
day afternoon Vigil mass which
he feared would be exposed to
undue noise from Chi Psi.

A retired officer, Col. Philbin,
is the only other neighbor in
close residence. Philbin,
located next door to the Post Of-
fice in the old KA house, spoke
in favor of Chi Psi at the August
10 meeting.

In the meantime, Chi Psi has
rented a series of suites in the
Woods Creek Apartments,
where they will conduct all rush
activities.

Theatre season sports new look

This year’s playbill from the
University Theatre is a bit of a
departure. Unlike previous
seasons which have featured six
or seven major, full length pro-
ductions, this season will see
three major shows mixed in
with four evenings of ex-
perimental theatre.

Major shows will be
presented once each term with
Al Gordon directing Ibsen’s A

Doll’s House and Shaw’s Can-

dida on alternate nights in the
weeks just before Thanksgiving
break. These two marriage

dramas will be performed on
the same Victorian set in the
Boiler Toom in the basement of
Old Main Street. Gordon had

taken on this project to provide
a chance to compare and con-
trast two plays written on

similar themes.

€ nletuinmment
Musical Mainstream

For the average music fan,
summer is a time to sit back
and wait for the inevitable flood
of fall album releases and tours.
Significant new LPs are few
and far between, and the con-
cert scene slows down to a few
major outdoor shows in and
around large cities.

Something happened in the
summer of ’78, though. It was
too much to hope for, but the
Rolling Stones and the Who
slammed back with fine albums
(about which more in future
weeks) after several years in
the doldrums. The Moody Blues
got back together for a reunion
LP and possible tour. Punk rock

sank further into the grave, °

while a few top-notch “new
wave” groups (most notably
the Tom Robinson Band)
released records which are
among the best of the year so
far. And in the “three years
later’’ department, Bruce Spr-
ingsteen’s longawaited follow-
up to “Born To Run” finally hit
the streets, backed by what is
from all accounts a dynamite
concert tour (see below).

Of course, the big news in
rock and roll this summer was
the Rolling Stones’ American
tour-their first here in three
years. Faithful readers of this
column will remember that last
year at this time, I reviewed the
latest Stones live album, “‘Love
You Live.’’ The write-up was a
generally unfavorable one, and
concluded that the magic of a
Rolling Stones concert just
didn’t come through on vinyl--
perhaps you just “had to be
there.”’

Well, this summer I was
there, and the Stones didn’t
come through on dn’t cut it in
person either. Along with
100,000 other people, I saw the
band on June 17 at JFK Stadium
in Philadelphia. According to
most reports, it was one of the
tour’s weakest shows, but cer-
tainly not the only poor one. The
band was half-hearted and just
plain sloppy—Jagger and
Richard weren’t even getting
back to the mikes in time for the
choruses to some of the songs.
Of course, maybe you'd be tired
too if you’d been singing
‘Satisfaction’ for over a
decade. An album as good as
Some Girls deserved a first-rate
tour to back it up, but it seemed
in many cities this summer that
the Rolling Stones just couldn’t
get it up anymore.

‘i — . . = : Bien’

Bruce Springsteen

Bruce Springsteen began his
bid to reclaim the future of
rock’n’roll early this summer
with a tour that could only be
described as gargantuan, in-
volving over 80 shows in 70
cities. Bruce first took the stage
in Buffalo on May 23rd, a few
days before the release of his
long-awaited fourth album,
“Darkness on the Edge of
Town”.

Despite the fact that the
somewhat localized nature of
Springsteen’s popularity tends
to undermine the validity of any
generalizations on the national
level, it was generally conclud-
ed among rock’s critical es-
tablishment that the Springs-
teen tour was the big event of
the summer, equaling the
Stones in volume and far sur-
passing them in quality.

As unusual as it may seem,
the consistent excellence of the
shows was probably the most
surpirsing aspect of the tour,
especially among people who
have followed Bruce since the
release of his first album nearly
6 yeats an6, VEU
‘“Darkness...’’ appeared on the
scene, the single overriding
theme projected from every
Springsteen album and every
Springsteen concert was one of
joyful triumph.

Then came ‘“‘Darkness on the
Edge of Town,’’ whose key
song, ‘‘Racing in the Streets,’
portrayed the author as an in-

by Mark Mainwaring
and Robin- Meredith

dividual trapped in a vicious
circle of sin and rebirth which
could never be truly conquered.
Put simply, the joy was gone,
and much of the thrill along
with it.

The end result of all this
reflection was a slight tinge of
apprehension shared among
mnay Springsteen fans as they
flocked to the concert halls this
summer. Would the joyful
celebrations of youth we had all
lived for be gone, replaced by
bitterly mature, ritualistic
preoccupations with sin and
heritage?

Well, Bruce made all of our
musings and doubts seem
rather ridiculous, as he pro-
ceeded to put on one of the fun-
niest and most emotionally
moving shows I have witnessed.
He managed to create a tension
out of the thematic contrasts
between new and old material
and use it with overwhelming
success. If “the future’’ was
ever truly within his reach, now
is definitely the time.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

On the local concert scene,
Bob Segar will be appearing at
the Roanoke Civic Center on
Sept. 27, along with special
guests Toby Beau. The Doobie
Brothers and UFO will also be
appearing at the Civic Center
on Oct. 5.

The winter term production,
yet to be chosen by Lee Kahn,
will likely be another tradi-
tional theatrical undertaking,
not unlike usual Troubador
fare. The final major work of
the year will be done by Tom
Ziegler and the total theatre
class, possibly combining live
acting and film in some way.

Particularly noteworthy,
though, are the four experimen-
tal productions scheduled two
each in the fall and winter
terms. These experimental pro-
ductions scheduled two each in
the fall and winter terms ex-
perimental productions will
take the place of the senior
thesis shows of past seasons.

According to Al Gordon, the
full scale presentations re-
quired of majors in the past
“tended to turn the director into
a producer.’’ The pressures of
logistics undermined the ability
to concentrate on_ the
creative/artistic aspect of the
experience.

As well as a single large pro-
ject encouraged ‘“‘tunnel vi-
sion.’ Acting students acted,
directing students directed and
exposure to outside areas was
rare. The new arrangement
calls for each major to work on
at least two experimentals and
work on several aspects of
various productions.

Gordon suggests that the new
set-up will provide “more ar-
tistic control and depth.

- Smaller, more managable pro-

jects ‘“‘will allow more ex-
perimentation and will allow
majors to get away from safe
shows’? by avoiding the
pressures of a large one shot
project.

Those most affected by the
shift, the senior majors, seem
pleased with the idea. Hunt
Brown says that, ‘‘It is for the
better.’’ Echoing his sen-
timents, John Jacobsen says, “‘I
think it will encourage serious
work.”’

Openness is the key to this
new approach. Gordon em-
phasizes that faculty participa-
tion in any phase of the ex-
perimental process is welcom-
ed. Any ideas should be directed
toward him. :

Finally, the plans call for
each experimental to be follow-
ed by instant critique by the au-
dience, another wrinkle design-
ed to open the flow of ideas.

In all, the 1978-79 theatre
season at W&L promises to be
different, daring, thought pro-
voking, a tremendous learning
experience for all involved, in a
word, fun.

Summer Spawns Films

by Dick Barron

Summertime is over but the
movies linger on. This was a
great season for the flicks.
There were some fireworks on
the screen and there were some
bombs. Of the many interesting
releases there are three which
immediately come to mind.
Grease, The Eyes of Laura
Mars, and Heaven Can Wait,
are all indicative of the new
climate in the movie industry.

There seems to be a return to
the romantic, entertaining, and
stylized moviemaking of the old
days at the major film fac-
tories. Realism and social com-
ment are taking a back seat to
the thrills, color and showman-
ship that made Hollywood
great.

The film on everyone’s mind
this summer was Grease,
directed by and starring those
Doublemint kids John Travolta
and Olivia Newton-John. Right
off the bat one wonders how
Disco-King Travolta and Olivia
‘“‘Have You Never Been
Mellow’ Newton-John could
make a successful pair.

The combination works
because Newton-John and
Travolta are equally shallow in
their roles as the wholesome
cheerleader and the nice-guy
hood. There are no academy
award winning performances
here, but the movie is flashy
enough to make up for its faults.

Mucially, the pop-disco title
track somehow seems out of
place with the fifties motif.
Travolta’s singing,while it may
lack real agility, has enough
spirit to remain pleasant (a
rock’n roller he ain’t). Newton-
John has long been a pop
favorite, and neither her fars
nor her critics will see any dif-
ference between this and past
efforts. (I heartily approve of
her skin-tight pants.)

Let’s face it, with a strong
supporting cast, some clever
surprises, and a dose of
schmaltz, Grease brings us
back to the movie house for a
mindless escape. So, like Lava
Lites and Billy Beer, Grease
has its place in the limbo of the
useless excell - a place where
things go when they’re not real-
ly good enough to be practical,
and they’re not really bad
enough to be trash.

The Eyes of Laura Mars gives
a sharp contrast to the fluff of
Grease. Starring Tommy-Lee

Jones and Faye Dunaway, Eyes
is a thriller in the Hitchcock
vein. This film gives one a
welcomed relief from lonely
haunted houses and _ horribly
posssessed children.

In Eyes it’s people against
people, doing some pretty horri-
ble things to each other in the
Big Apple. Laura Mars is a
fashion photographer whose
eerie, sexy photos are seen
everywhere from buses to art
galleries. But Laura is having a
problem.

At a most unexpected time
Laura gets a vision of one of her
friends being stalked by a
killer-through the killer’s eyes.
Needless to say our heroine is
rather disturbed as _ she
helplessly watches friend after
friend being stalked and killed,
eventually seeing herself as a
potential victim.

To detail the many twists of
plot would be like explaining the
road to Sweetbriar — you’ve got
to experience it. Excellent
direction and classy opening
titles create the mood for icy
suspense (take a date to this one
and she’ll hold on for dear life).
Overall, Eyes is a chilling treat
for summertime or schooltime.

Heaven Can Wait—directed
by, co-written by, and starring
Warren Beatty is without a
doubt the most consistent and
rewarding of this trio of films.
Beatty has clearly
demonstrated his gift for
creating the type of subtle
romantic comedy which
flourished in the thirties and
forties. A remake of an earlier
film ‘‘Here Comes Mr. Jordan

(1941),’’ Heaven Can Wait is a
somewhat confusing story of a
football quarterback who meets
an early grave.

Unfortunately the represen-
tative from Heaven (Buck
Henry) is a qualified incompe-
tent who snaps Beatty from the
world of the living before his
time is up. Complications
abound when the self of the
quarterback is sent back into
the body of a multimillionaire.

The heart of all this madness
is the millionaire’s romance
with a young activist (Julie
Christie). Beatty and Christie
light up the screen with a pierc-
ing eye contact which hasn’t
been seen since Rhett Butler
swept Scarlett O’Hara off her
feet. Relax, Clark Gable fans,
Heaven Can Wait is by no

means another Gone With The’

Wind, but its romantic content
rates with the greats. Combine
this romance with some fine
supporting actors (Dyan Can-
non shines) and a lively score
and you have possibly this
year’s best movie entertain-
ment. Watch the Academy
Awards for this one.

There it is, a small selection
of thiS season’s offerings. I’ve
selected this group because
they all have a quality of fan-
tasy which is giving new life toa
once troubled industry. These
films, along with earlier hits
such as Star Wars and Close En-
counters, demonstrate that im-
aginative and open ended film-
making allows the viewer to en-
joy and experience movies in a
more satisfying way than hard
edged realism could allow.

Eye And Ear:
From The Bookstore

KK KKK

These last few days have
made it clear that the anatomy
of the Co-op Building is a
mystery to upperclassmen as
well as newly-arrived
freshmen. So many levels, so
many nooks and crannies, so
many functions! As one who
spends most of her waking
hours there, I can perhaps,
dissect the building so that
when spring arrives we won't
find some gaunt soul still trying
to exchange his first issue of
linen.

Administratively, there are
two sections in the building: the
Supply Store and the Bookstore.
The Supply Store handles mer-
chandise (behind the glass
doors, top level), the Snack Bar
(also top level) and the Linen
Service (third level down,
behind the textbooks). The
Bookstore includes a general
book department (second level
down, but first level if you enter
from the freshman door side -
O.K.?) the textbook department
(one level down from there) and
a record shop (fourth level from
the top.)

Granted that the Co-op has a
rabbit-warren pattern about it,
there are areas of grace and
pleasure as well as mystery
here. The Bookstore, with
which I am most familiar, of-
fers in the walnut-paneled,
carpeted area an opportunity
for exploration among about
4,000 different books. Here you
buy books you want, not those
you must. We carry books rang-
ing from cooking to philosophy,
art to travel, and from science
to humor.

All members of the W&L
‘community-and this includes
students who are, after all, the
reason for the University’s ex-
istence, have automatic charge
accounts here. Special orders
for books we do not carry
(there are a few) - are prompt-
ly and precisely processed. We
handle hundreds of such orders
each year and are truly proud of
the service we give.

There are no pressures in the
Bookstore. You are not going to
be graded there or called on to
recite. But it is a lively place

*
*

KKK KK

with plenty of conversation,
discussion, even arguments as
weil as lots of nonsense and

laughter.

By now the students have
found the textbook section of the
Bookstore, -and found it all too
expensive, I suspect, too. There
were some changes, and shor-
tages - supplying textbooks has
a lot in common with Russian
Roulette, but it will all settle out
with out too much agony, we
hope.

Students may charge text-

‘books only if we have authoriza-

tion from his parents. Too,
TAKE NOTE, that books may
be returned only until Oct. ist
and if they are in mint condi-
tion.

Record Store

You have a record store all
your own, stocked to suit your
needs and priced to fit easily
within your budget. The
Washington and Lee University
Record Store is located beneath
the Bookstore in the Coop base-
ment. Since the store is limited
in space we may not carry
every record you want, so
please, if you have any
preferences or special orders
ask the store manager, Dan
Scott, tostock what you want.

We do, however, carry all
sorts of recordings—classical
music from the medieval period
through the 20th century, vin-
tage jazz and blues, ECM jazz,
ragtime, folk, ethnic folk, coun-
try, bluegrass, old time, topical
records, cut-outs, and a wide
variety of pop and rock LP’s.

Records arrive nearly every
day so check the store often to
see what is new. Aside from
music, we carry a complete line
of tapes and record case pro-
ducts at very affordable prices.

The philosophy of the store is,
to carry as wide a variety in
recorded sound as_ possible
while still stocking records that
are popular and well known. So
whether you intend to expand
your record collection or ex-
pand your musical knoweldge,
the W&L record Store is open 8
to 4 weekdays to serve you.

WLUR Returns
Equipment Added

Washington and Lee’s student
operated radio station, WLUR,
will return to the airwaves next
Tuesday morning, the station’s
music director, Mark Mainwar-
ing, has announced.

Located at 91.5 on the FM
dial, WLUR operates as a non-
commerical station, primarily
as an alternative to formats
which can be heard in the area.

Mainwaring said he an-
ticipated few changes from the
format which the station
adopted last spring. The format
includes music for a variety of
tastes, including popular rock,
classical, jazz, and the in-
novative ‘‘Third Ear.”’

One new addition to the sta-
tion, he said, is a _ portable
transmitter which is now on
order. ‘‘This will allow us to do
remote broadcasts from almost
anywhere, without the limita-
tions we’ve had in the past. It
opens up a whole new world for
us—from man in the street in-
terviews to live remote broad-
casts,”’ he said.

The portable transmitter will
be particularly helpful in ad-
ding a new dimension to the sta-
tion’s news department, said
news director Charlie Smith.

 

 

Smith said that the station
planned more “‘spot’’ news in
the form of newscasts of either
five minutes or fifteen minutes
throughout the day.

“Our main objective is to
keep the student informed: it is
amazing to me how few
students really know what’s go-
ing on in the outside world. And
there aren’t a lot of students
who read more than the comics
and sports pages of the

newspaper.”

Smith also said the portable
transmitter would be used to ex-
pand the station’s local
coverage of events, such as stu-
dent government meetings and

Lexington government
meetings.
“In this way, we hope

students can become more in-
formed and participate in-
telligently in the activities of
not only their school, but also
the community which sur-
rounds it,”’ Smith said.

Any interested persons who
would like to help with the sta-
tion, in any phase of its opera-
tion, are encouraged to stop by
the studio. Positions are open to
all.

 

SAB Considers Weeknight Party Ban

The Student Activities Board
(SAB) held its first meeting of
the year Sunday October 10.
Although no business was tran-
sacted, (at this ‘get ac-
quainted”’ meeting) several im-
portant issues were discussed.

A “favorable consensus’ was
given to a proposal made by
Brick Brown of a party at the
Pavillion on the weekend of Oc-
tober 7. Brown’s proposal calls
for the Student Bar Association

to hire a country rock band. The
Executive Committee is to sup-
ply the beer and the SAB the
manpower.

Other discussions call for a
budgeting of about $4000 for
Homecoming. Entertainment is
expected to consist of a mix of
rock and soul.

Because there is no budget as
yet, there have been no plans
made for entertainment in the

Cockpit. Plans will be made as
the budget is drawn up.

Finally, there was some
discussion of Fancy Dress. Last
year there was much talk of
rescheduling Fancy Dress dur-
ing the Washington Holiday to
avoid a conflict between Fancy
Dress and academic work. A
possible promise solution, call-
ing for the banning of Universi-
ty sponsored parties on
weeknights was ‘‘considered.”’

The Ring-tum Phi, Sept. 14,1978 Page9

Sigma Chi president arrested for violation

of Lexington noise ordinance

cont. from p. 1

pointed out that there were par-
ties going on at every other
fraternity on campus Saturday
night with music ‘‘just as loud
as ours,”’

He also said that he went out-
side of the house to check how
loud the music was and thought
that he had ‘“‘accomodated the
ordinance.” Brooks added that
the noise level could not have
disturbed neighbors because
the houses surrounding Sigma
Chi are occupied by students.

Purvis used discretion

Officer Purvis said there had
been no specific complaint, but
that he had been using his
discretion by arresting Brooks.

Sigma Chi’s noise Saturday
could be heard ‘from the
University Cleaners,’ Purvis
said, and was louder than that
coming from the Red Square
fraternities. He said the noise at
those houses could only be
heard as you ‘‘came before the
house.”’

Judge Hess questioned why
Brooks had been arrested on the
second incident Saturday night
and not just issued a summons.
Purvis pointed out that Brooks
had been warned twice and
served with a summons the
previous Tuesday.

The officer also said that he
had been instructed by Police
Chief Kirby that fraternities
were no longer to be warned,
but to be charged so that the or-
dinance would be adhered to.
Purvis noted that the $50 bond
set for Brooks was waved and
the fraternity president was

released on_ personal
recognizance.
In his verdict, Judge Hess fin-

ed Brooks $10 plus court costs
for the first offense and dismiss-
ed the charges levied for the
Saturday night party and arrest
“because of other matters not
being done and the need for
things to be worked out fairly.”

Hess instructed Purvis and
other Lexington police officers
to use their ‘‘experience and
discretion” in deciding whether
to issue a summons or an arrest
warrant for future violations of
the city’s noise ordinance.

Arrest ‘“‘unnecessary”’

In an interview with the
Ring-tum Phi after the trial,
Brooks called his arrest ‘‘un-
necessary.”

‘Purvis’ threats to impound
our sound system were over-
done, and I did not appreciate
his lecture on the evils of col-
lege students,” Brooks said.
“My main concern at the time
was that it was hurting our
Rush,” he added.

“T haven’t the vaguest con-
ception why Purvis would be
against us, if he is,’’ Brooks
said.

Brooks found Judge Hess
“fair and cooperative and
understanding of the situation.
He thought it was unnecessary
for Purvis to arrest me.”

IFC action

The Interfraternity Council
(IFC) jumped into action on the
incident Tuesday night.

Beau Dudley, president of the
student body, spoke before the
assembled group of fraternity
presidents and representatives
and said, “(Police Chief) Kirby
has told his policemen that
there will be no more warn-
ings’’ on noise violations.

“Unless we are willing to
make some concessions to the
town, they will not alter their
policy,” Dudley said. ‘Either
we bite the bullet or our actions
will just be an exercise in futili-

ty.”

Weeknight parties are the
problem”

Dudley suggested a conces-
sion on weeknight parties by
picking only one night of the
week to party and ending the

Getting Your Car
Towed In Lexington

For those of you who will be
unfortunate enough this next
year to have your car towed
away, here is some information
that may prove to be helpful:

If your car is towed away in
the City of Lexington Monday
through Friday between the
hours of 8:30 - 4:30 you can pick
up your car at the city garage.
This is located behind the SPCA
on Campbell Lane, also refer-
red to as “Shop Road.”’ But you
first must go and pay your
ticket at the police station
before going to pick up your car
at the city garage.

However, if you don’t get in to
pick up your car on weekdays
until after 4:30 you must pick it
up that following day. This in-
cludes Fridays—in that case,
you will have to wait until the
following Monday.

You may be lucky enough to
have your car towed away after
business hours (4:30). In that
case your car will be towed to
the police ‘station. You will be
able to pick it up there any time

of the day after regular

business hours.

Now that you have had the
misfortune of having your car
towed away, it will cost at least
$17 to get it on the streets again.
There will be an extra addi-
tional $5 ticket that must be
paid if your car was parked ina
restriced area. This could bring
your whole total to $22 if you
want to reclaim your car from
the city of Lexington.

However, beware if your car
is towed away by Rockbridge

revelry earlier.

“Weeknight parties are the
problem,’’ he said. ‘The town
does not have as much of a pro-
blem with the weekends.’
Dudley also suggested that the
music at parties be turned
down. He_- emphasized,
however, that the fraternities
must ‘work together as a
group.”

In return for partying earlier
and just on one night during the
week, Dudley hopes to receive
the following:
~-no police action taken without
a complaint being registered.

(‘The idea of Purvis taking
his pick of the fraternity houses

when nobody on God’s green
earth is bothered by the music
is wrong,” Dudley said.)

—police to give at least one war-
ning.

—discontinue the enforcement
of the noise ordinance during
the daylight hours.

(Section 15-33 of the city code
states generally that “except in
public emergency” it is
unlawful to use ‘‘sound-
amplifying equipment or
loudspeakers in such a manner
that the sound or noise is audi-
ble to the public.’’)

-wave the noise ordinance for
three weekends a year.

Ring-tum Phi Interview

 

Dudley cautioned that they’ve
got the law, it’s on the books,
and the cards are in their
hands.”’

Dean Dan Murphy, fraternity
advisor, added that the frater-
nities are ‘‘in a no-win situation
now.”

‘What I want is something
concrete to show him (Kirby),”’
Dudley said, ‘“‘to get honest
negotiations going.”’

IFC representatives will meet
again tonight to formulate a
compromise for the city.

WLUR News Director Charlie
Smith contributed to this story.

William Hartog: The New
Admissions Director Is Working

To Make W&L More Attractive

William M. Hartog, W&L’s
new Director of Admissions,
said that his first impression of
W&L was the great amount of
enthusiasm everyone had for
the school. He adds that he
“hasn’t been disappointed”
since that first impression.

He is also pleased with the
openness of students and facul-
ty in making suggestions. Even
though Hartog has a firm grasp
of admissions problems, he
claims he only knows ‘10%
about W&L”’ and that it will
take ‘‘at least a year to learn
the other 90%.”’

Hartog further said that he
did not intend to make any
sweeping changes soon. His
first assurance was that ‘‘we
won’t turn our backs on the
past.” He intends to continue
the developing of bases at
schools that have traditionally
supported W&L.

The enthusiasm that Hartog
has noticed is matched by his
own in tackling the problems of
admissions. He intends to
develop new areas of support,
and has organized an ambitious
travelling schedule. Both he
and his staff will spend a total of
30 weeks on the road from Sept.
17 to Dec. 10.

His ambitious traveling
schedule is an outgrowth of his
view of the role of directors of
admissions. He looks upon them
as being “facilitators,” making
it as easy as possible for the stu-

dent to find out about a school.

He said that W&L doesn’t
have “incredible weight”’ in the
initial stages of contact. For
this reason, it must be made as
easy as possible for the prospec-
tive student to learn of W&L. He
feels that prospective students
must be saturated with
literature.

Hartog also said that W&L
has two demographic
characteristics that usually
hurt an admissions program,
but at W&L he considers them
to be assets. Being a single sex
school in a rural area should be
presented as the strengths of
W&L, and not characteristics to
be apologized for.

The main problem, according
to Hartog, is the prospective
student not visiting W&L. He
feels that meeting the students,
faculty, and administration is
the best way to acquaint the stu-
dent with the strengths of W&L.
He intends to set up a program
for visiting students to stay
overnight in the freshman
dorms.

Hartog is familiar with ad-
missions policies. He was ap-
pointed Director of Admissions
at Rollins College in Florida at
24, but originally had no inten-
tion of entering the admissions
field.

He said he was a combined
history and business major
“simply because I didn’t know
what I was going to do.”’

He went on to receive his
master’s degree in business,
and them taught at his
preporatory school in New York
for a year. He knew he wanted
to work with students and
counsel them, and he con-
sidered teaching an extension of
this interest.

Soon, he was offered the job of
Assistant Director of Admis-
sions, and hoped to eventually
work in student guidance. In-
stead, he was appointed Direc-
tor of Admissions.

He said that the only way his
youth was a liability was in
other people knowing of his lack
of experience. He said that he
“felt conscious of his age, but
had no inferiority complex
about it.” Hartog, now 31, said
that becoming the Director of
Admissions was ‘“‘the best thing
that ever happened to me.”’

Hartog was happy at Rollins,
and W&L was the only other
place he applied for a job. He
heard about the job by word of
mouth, and felt he needed a pro-
fessional change. The president
of the college that appointed
him resigned, Hartog explain-
ed, so he felt no personal
allegiance to any individual.

His staff had also met all the
goals they had set, so Hartog
felt ready for a new challenge.
Although he was not familiar
with W&L before learning of the
job, he has quickly grown to like
it.

 

County. This author had his car
towed 20 feet out at Zollman’s

it cost him $25 to get it back. In

Natural Bridge 1978:

Student Body President Speaks

The annual freshman pilgrimage to Natural Bridge occurred last
Thursday, September 7. A highlight of the overnight trip was the
address by the President of the Student Body. This is one of the first
official duties of the year for new president Beau Dudley, and
represents a most promising start. Rather than a general news
story, we believe that this section gives the essential flavor of the
‘‘Natural Bridge experience.’’ And above all, this should serve as
an introduction to Mr. Dudley, whose name will appear in these
pages time and again.

I’m Beau Dudley, and in one of its weaker moments the Student
Body elected me to serve as President for the coming year. I’m
awfully excited about the year ahead, and I suppose one of the main
points I’s like to make tonight is that I think you all should also be
excited.

 

Freshmen enjoy skyride to the bridge.

“I urge you to take advantage of this wonderful school,

to work for her, and to enjoy her.”

    

Frank Parsons, Betty Munger and others register looks of amusement and/or shock when confronted

with Natural Bridge cuisine.

I remember quite well my own feelings when I came to
Washington and Lee as a freshman in 1970. Before you think that it
has taken me8 years to become a senior, let me point out that I’ma
3rd year law student here. That’s not overly important, but it may
help me illustrate a point to say that my feelings in 1970 were
perhaps 80% fear of wnat lay ahead, and maybe 20% eager an-
ticipation and excitement. On reflection I’m fairly sure that those
figures were just about backwards. It seems to me that you all
should be looking very forward to the next four years, with perhaps
a little bit of nervous anxiety mixed in.

Make no mistake about it, the challenges you will face here will
be demanding ones, both in and out of the classroom. But as I’m
sure you've already heard from your guidance counselors and your
parents, the fact of your admission here is testimony that you can
do the work if you apply yourselves. And I want to assure you that
the benefits of meeting all of the challenges ahead will be almost
immeasurable.

Before I go any further I think I’d better apologize for sounding
like a father, an alumni director, and a preacher during the next
few minutes, but it did occur to me that perhaps I had a few pieces
of advice which I believe are worth keeping in mind as you con-
template your years at Washington and Lee.

 

The first thought I have is that we all should realize how fortunate
we are to have arrived at this point in our lives with the chance to
spend time at W&L having grown from a possibility into a certain-
ty. It probably goes without saying that many others would give
quite a bit to be in our shoes, and to have that same lucky set of cir-
cumstances facing them. I want to suggest to you that being a
freshman at W&L is -»ne of thousands of other positions you could
find yourself in, very few of which would be as appealing and poten-
tially rewarding as the one you're in.

Second, I think that you will benefit from realizing the tremen-
dous opportunity that you have been given by coming to W&L. The
opportunities for participation, contribution, and success presented
at a school of our size and caliber are literally too numerous to men-
tion. If we realize the existence of these opportunities, it seems to
me logical that we should take advantage of them, so that at the end
of our stay here we can experience the great satisfaction that will
come from doing so. More on that a bit later.

It is also my strong belief that we all ought to keep in mind that,
in addition to our own efforts, there are others who deserve our
credit and thanks for the support which has made it possible for us
to be at Washington and Lee. Whether it be our parents, our friends,
or a scholarship fund, it occurs to me that we can all benefit from
keeping in mind that perhaps we owe to those people and to
ourselves a duty to give it our best effort, in order that those who

~ have helped us get to W&L will be rewarded and reinforced through

those efforts.

_ You may well be wondering whether the hard work will be worth : ii
it to you in the long run. There’s a great deal of talk these days
about the value of a liberal arts education, and about who’s getting
what kind of jobs, etc. With the advance approval of several
members of the Executive Committee (who will be held totally
responsible if this is a flop), I’m going to risk telling you a joke
which may be of some relevance in this area. At any rate it’s time
that you were introduced to one of the rivalries which enlivens our
athletic and social atmosphere here.

The story takes place a number of years in the future, at a time
when medical science has progressed to the point where brain
transplants are possible. An enterprising young man who had not
been fortunate enough to attend college approached a well-known
doctor about the possibility of getting a college-educated mind by
transplant. The doctor replied that this would be quite feasible, but
that the doctor would need a little bit more help on exactly the type
of college mind the young man wanted.

“You see,” said the doctor, ‘‘the price goes up depending on the
college you choose. If, for instance, you want a Madison brain it will
cost you five dollars a pound. A Randolph-Macon brain will be
seven fifty a pound, a Hampden-Sydney brain will be about ten

came here in 1970. I believe strongly that you will feel the same
way, beginning here tonight with freshman orientation.

I would like to leave you with one final piece of unsolicited advice
before I quit. I think you ought to really take advantage of
Washington and Lee. Take her for a ride. As a metter of fact I think
you ought to take her for everything she’s worth. Of course I don’t ’
mean that in the sense of milking W&L and putting back nothing in
return, nor do I mean that you ought to slide by with as little effort
as possible and have the last laugh as you leave (and I doubt that
attitude is prevalent among you anyway). But I do think one of the
best ways to enjoy your experience here will come from simply get-
ting involved, from singling out one or more activities and then
making every effort to excell in them. Whether that turns out to be
athletics or drama or publications, whether it will be in fraternity
life, intramurals or most importantly academics, I believe that the

THE

RING-TUM PHI

  

Soccer Team Goes 1-2
In Pre-Season Play

The W&L soccer Generals,
competing for the first time in
the Washington College pre-
season tournament last
weekend, finished third with a
1-2 record. The tournament was
considered a pre-season exhibi-
tion for W&L and will not count
in their overall won-loss record.

The Generals won their first
game 2-1 over Western
Maryland as goals by seniors
Howie Collier (on a penalty
kick) and Todd Tyson provided
the margin of victory. W&L was
defeated 3-0 by host Washington
College as the back to back 180
minutes of soccer proved too
much for W&L’s traveling con-
tingent of 14 players. The
Generals lost to Drexel 2-1 in
their final game on Saturday as
Collier again scored for . W&L.
Sophomore Kevin Carney
played all three games in goal.

Coach Rolf Piranian praised
his team for their effort, saying
“T’m proud of my players
because they hung in there
under adverse conditions with
very little rest and little
substitution. Considering those
factors, they did an excellent
job.”

The Generals open their
regular season this Saturday
with a game against the Garnet
of Swarthmore at 2:00 p.m. in
Swarthmore, Pa. Swarthmore

defeated Navy last year and
Piranian expects them to be one
of his team’s most difficult Divi-
sion III opponents this year.

W&L is home for the first
time against the Valley United
Soccer Club of Roanoke on
September 23rd.

W&L Loses To Madison —
Faces Davidson Saturday

The Washington & Lee
Generals open the home portion
of their 1978 football season this
Saturday hosting Davidson Col-
lege of Davidson, N.C. The
kickoff is scheduled for 1:30
p.m. on W&L’s Wilson Field.
Last Saturday’s opener at
Madison proved to be unsuc-
cessful for the Generals as the
Dukes won 49-7.

Both Washington & Lee and
Davidson are looking for their
initial win of the new year. The
Wildcats suffered a somewhat
unexpected 30-14 loss to visiting
Fordham on Saturday. The
Rams rushed for 364 yards
against DC and stopped the
Cats three times within the 10
yard line in the second half. The
game also took its toll on the

S?
:

 

o

Davidson lineup as starting
quarterback Bob McCarthy and
linebacker Barry Cannon were
lost for the season with injuries.

W&L coach Gary Fallon ex-
pects Davidson to present his
young team with their biggest
challenge of the 1978 season.
“The Wildcats are a physically
imposing team and will certain-
ly be gunning for that first win
on Saturday. My players
haven’t let me down yet and
have given it their all from
thefirst day of pre-season prac-
tice through the Madison game.

- That’s all I can ask for and hope

for the best against Davidson.”

The Generals opened the new
year losing 49-7 at James
Madison last weekend. The
game was closer than the final

Last Saturday’s Football game-
Did all go wrong for the Generals?

by Ray McNulty

The W&L Generals opened
their football season last Satur-
day on a less than impressive
note. They lost to James
Madison University by a score
of 49-7. Madison led by seven at
the half (14-7) and then totally
dominated the second half.

Despite being the underdog,
W&L played a strong first half.
The Generals moved the ball
well and the defense did a fairly
good job of halting Madison’s
attack. W&L had an opportunity
to score in the first half as
senior quarterback Scott Swope
directed the Generals towards
the goal line. Swope, who mixed
his running and passing game
will, still could not, get the ball
into the endzone.

W&L did score near the end of
the first half, but by that time
Madison already had a 14-point
lead. However, the W&L score
seemed to spark the Generals
as they went into the locker
room at halftime.

When the second half began,
it appeared that W&L would

have the momentum. If they
did, it didn’t last too long. It
took Madison only two minutes
to score on a 33-yard torichdown
run. This gave Madison a 14-
point lead and seemed to deflate
the Generals hopes. After that

Madison score it was all
downhill for W&L.
Madison completely

donimated the second half
outscoring W&L 35-0 and set a
Madison school record for first
downs in one game (32).

Several things hurt the
Generals against Madison. The
temperature on the field at
gametime was well over 90
degrees and the game was
played on astroturf. W&L prac-
tices on a grass field while
Madison practices on the turf.
This gave Madison a slight ad-
vantage.

Still, what hurt the Generals
the most was their failure to
establish a running game. The
Madison defense stopped the
W&L running attack and forced
the Generals to throw the ball.

Even star running back Stew
Atkinson could not help the
Generals as he carried the ball
12 times for only 17 yards.

Madison outrushed W&L 479
yards to 51 yards.

As the game went on Madison
looked better and better. It was
soon evident that Madison (a
Division II team) was by far the
superior team. W&L seemed too
inconsistant and appeared to
lack depth at several positions,
expecially in the offensive
backfield.

There were some bright spots
for W&L. Senior quarterback
Scott Swope connected on 16 of
31 passes for 150 yards and one
touchdown and was named
W&L’s offensive player of the
game. Senior flanker Rich
Wiles caught three passes for 61
yards, including a 10-yard
touchdown pass from Swope.
Sophomore slotback Chris
Leiser was W&L’s leading
receiver catching six passes for
62 yards. Leiser also carried the
ball three times for 16 yards.

On defense, senior linebacker
Carl Folcik and senior free safe-
ty Don Crossley led the
Generals conbining for a total of
26 tackles. Folick also had an in-
terception and Crossley was
named W&L’s defensive player
of the game.

Two W&L freshmen played
well against Madison and
should help the Generals this
year. Jim Palermo, a fullback
from Brentwood, N.Y., led the
Generals in rushing with 33
yards on 8 carries for an
average of-4.2 yards per carry.
Another freshman, Mike
Pressler is a_ starter at
noseguard on the W&L defense.
Pressler, from Wilton, Conn.,
made seven unassisted tackles
and played well.

W&L plays Davidson this
Saturday on Wilson Field at
1:30 p.m. Davidson defeated
W&L last year 42-14 at David-
son. The Wildcats should be
tough once again this year and
the Generals need everyone’s

support.

score indicated as W&L trailed
only 14-7 at the half after a
touchdown pass from senior
quarterback Scott Swope to
split end Rich Wiles with 0:35
remaining in the second
quarter. The W&L offense mov-
ed the ball fairly well through
the air against the Dukes as
Swope hit 15 0f 30 passes for 144
yards in being named the
Generals’ Offensive Player of
the Game.

JMU featured an eight man
defensive line in the game
which forced W&L to go to the
air a little more than originally
planned. Sophomore slotback
Chris Leiser caught six Swope
passes for 62 yards to lead the
W&L receiving corps. Because
of W&L’s success through the

- air, the Generals were limited

to 51 yards on the ground.

Does the rushing total worry
Fallon? ‘‘We’re not really con-
cerned about our rushing attack
as the game dictated we pass
the ball. Playing catch up foot-
ball and facing the wide tackle
six defense put a damper on our
running game.’ Freshman
fullback Jim Palermo led W&L
with 33 yards rushing including
one run for 23 yards. Tailback
Stewart Atkinson was keyed on
all day and finished with only 17
yards, leaving him 212 yards
short of W&L’s all-time career
rushing record.

The story of the game was
told in the Duke’s success
rushing the football as they
completed the day with 479
yards on the ground, including
29 first downs rushing (32 in
all). JMU threw only 11 times
and completed six for 75 yards.
W&L free safety Don Crossley
was called on to make 12 tackles
and two assists in being named
the Defensive Player of the
Game.

Linebackers Carl Folcik with
14 tackles and George Ballan-
tyne with nine also played well.
Freshman noseguard Mike
Pressler finished with 7 tackles
but had little support along the
defensive line. It was obvious
the heat of the afternoon (120
degrees on the Madison
astroturf) had an effect on the
Generals’ lack of depth. ‘‘Many
of our players had to go the
whole game in that heat, and as
the second half rolled on, it
eventually began to get to
them,” said Fallon. ‘JMU just
wore us down with their size,
speed, and depth. We gave it all
we had, it just wasn’t enough.”’

What does Fallon plan for
Davidson? “We're going to
make some changes this week
to help remedy our defense
against the rush. Overall, I was
pleased with our offensive ef-
fort on Saturday especially with
the play of center Bob
Burkholder and guard Scott
Smith. In the backfield, Swope
and Leiser played well. Our
linebackers did the job against
the Dukes and we’ll be looking
for that same effort from them
against Davidson. We have to
believe we can win as we
prepare for the upcoming
weekend.’’ Saturday is ‘‘Calen-
dar Day” for the Generals. The
first 500 spectators will receive
poster size schedule calendars.

Coach Lord, Bill Schneir

Win Honors Over Summer

Nroman Lord, well known
Phys. Ed. instructor, athletic
official and campus free lance
political commentator, was
given the 1978 Public Service
Award in July by the Virginia
High School Coaches Associa-
tion.

In receiving this award in
Richmond, Lord added another
honorable notch to his long thir-
ty plus year career at
Washington and Lee. Just a
year ago, Lord was presented
with the Walter Cormack
Memorial Award for his many
track and field contributions in
Virginia.

Lord has done much to
enliven his Physical Education
courses at W&L. For example,
the 1942 graduate of the Univer-
sity of Delaware skillfully
mixes business with pleasure
by requiring his handball
students to play their date in the
game. Not only does Lord for-
ment some student unrest by
putting young lovers against
each other in a “‘battle of the
sexes” but he has his fall
semester aerobics students em-
bark on a ‘Spook-Run’’ on
Halloween nights.

Outside of his collegiate
works, Lord has officiated and
promoted physical fitness
around Virginia for the last thir-
ty two years and presently
serves as the Commissioner of
Officials for the Valley (Va.)
Officials Association. Also, to
cap off his wide array of profes-
sional responsibilities, Lord
serves the American Army as a
sports consultant and toured
Europe this past summer con-
ducting athletic clinics for the
armed forces personnel station-
ed there.

Lord also speaks to interested
audiences on his political views,
which tend to veer to the right of
center. He combines zeal and
eloquence to conduct an effec-
tive ideological vendetta
against the liberal political
philosophy which he feels
permeates Washington, D.C.
Last spring, while speaking to a
sympathetic College
Republican audience, Coach
Lord figuratively presented the -
liberals with a large shovel with
which leftists could shovel their
political thinking. All in all, the
1978 Public Service Award
could not have gone to anyone
less colorful than Norman Lord.

 

Washington & Lee University
Sports Information Director
Bill Schnier, received seven
“Citations for Excellence” for
his sports brochures/press
guides published during the
1977-78 athletic year. The
awards were made by the Col-
lege Sports Information Direc-
tors of America during a sum-
mer conference in Atlanta,
Georgia. President Robert
Peterson of the University of
Minnesota made the formal an-

nouncements.

The award ceremonies con-
cluded the 1978 CoSIDA Sum-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Bureaucratic Delay

And
Problems With Rome...

For at least a dozen years, the Ann Smith school
building at the corner of Lee and Nelson streets has
been one of the more familiar Lexington eyesores.
Though the grounds are kept in presentable condition,
the building itself suffers problems from broken win-
dows to damaged walls and floors. Washington and
Lee has often considered purchasing the building, but
no suitable use could be found. So the general feeling
of relief was understandable when the university sent
in a bid to buy the land, in order to rent the building to
Chi Psi Fraternity.

Chi Psi may be only one year old, but their plans are
impressive and commendable. Blessed with generous
financial support, they are in a position to handle all
interior renovation. And in addition, they agreed to
pay all property taxes on the building for the length of
their stay. Their enthusiasm spread to the Lexington
City Council; on August 10, that body agreed to the
plan. And then, the sudden bombshell. After a month
of delay, the city attorney suddenly found himself
unable to allow the move under present ordinances.
As a result, the City Council must vote again—not on
Chi Psi particularly, but regarding zoning allowances
for all future fraternity acquisitions.

In the forefront of the opposition has been the
neighboring Catholic church. Afraid of a parking pro-
blem, a 9-to-5 business might be more to their liking.
Also, noise during their Saturday mass was mention-
ed as a problem.

Somewhere along the line, though, this argument
strikes a false note. First, the local Catholic con-
gregation (minus those students who tend to walk to
mass) is rather small, even by Lexington standards.
In addition, the Catholic vigil mass occurs near the
fraternity dinner hour—a time that should be counted
upon for reasonable quiet.

We can appreciate the concern of the church coun-
cil, if they fear that the faithful (upon seeing one full
parking lot adjacent to the church) will shrug their
shoulders and keep driving, rather than find an alter-
nate parking spot. But it’s hard to believe that the
faith has slipped so far in this town.

In essence, a severe problem is rearing its head.
Fraternities are already being harassed by quiet-
loving residential neighbors who tie up police lines
every weekend. Chi Psi, on the other hand, has at-
tempted to move into a predominantly commercial
neighborhood. And yet they are encountering another
brand of resistance. The fraternity has no choice but
to hold up its plans for cleaning and restoration of the
building until the bureaucratic process has run its
course. ,

And who receives the biggest injustice of all? The
Ann Smith school, of course, which continues to fall in
on itself. One hopes that Chi Psi has enough resources
to fix the structure as originally planned, if the delays
ever end. The only other residential neighbor, on
Nelson Street went on record as being in favor of Chi
Psi’s plan; he called fraternity people ‘‘loving.” If the
laity can reach such a decision, it is our hope that the
church and city officials can find goodness in poten-
tial fraternity neighbors, too.

The City Planning Commission will meet
September 25 to make a decision, to guide the final Ci-
ty Council vote. It’s an open meeting; any interested
students can attend. The best of luck to Chi Psi and
their restoration plan; Lexington can always spare an

extra white elephant.

A Reluctant Farewell...

The chaos of returning to W&L for the fall is a
familiar yearly ritual, and it is strange to see a
farewell of any sort in this first issue. Unfortunately,
it’s here, and a sad one at that.

Of all the familiar faces on the hill, one of the front-
runners would have to be Shirley Floyd. For many of
you, hers was the first face you saw on campus — sit-
ting at her desk in the lobby of Washington Hall. Ad-
missions was her job (and devotion) ; she has schedul-
ed more tours and interviews than anyone is able to
recount.

Shirley was transferred to ‘‘front desk’’ about 212
years ago. At that time, a new and exciting group was
forming — The Student Recruitment Committee.
Within the past two years, its volunteer ranks have
grown four times over. And acting as co-ordinator
and housemother from the start was Mrs. Floyd.

As the committee members returned this week and
got the news of Shirley’s imminent departure, their
reactions of regret echoed all others who have had the
pleasure of knowing her. Said one senior member,
“She’s been with us from the start...how can she
leave? And who else can hold the volunteers
together?”’

Well, W&L has a knack of putting the right person
at the right job. But when you speak of Shirley Floyd
— that’s someone who had a direct input into the ap-
plication and admission of at least half the campus. A
tough act to follow...

All of us wish Shirley well in her new job, which
takes her back home to Texas. But yesterday, sur-
rounded by flowers on her last day, you just can’t help
feeling that we’re losing someone to which only this
place can really be ‘‘home.”’

DuPont Fund Gives $100,000
More To Washington and Lee

The Jessie Ball duPont
Religious, Charitable and
Educational Fund has given a
grant of $100,000 to Washington
and Lee University for
unrestricted endowment.

The fund was established in
Mrs. duPont’s will for the
philanthropic support of
charitable activities, notably in
higher education.

Mrs. duPont was a major
benefactor of Washington and
Lee during the last 30 years of
her life. In 1947 the university

awarded her the honorary Doc-
tor of Humane Letters degree,
and in 1959 she was elected to
the Washington and Lee Board
of Trustees. She remained a
board member until her death
Sept. 26, 1970. DuPont Hall on
the W&L campus, the fine arts
building, is named in her honor.

One of her principal interests
at Washington and Lee was in
establishing a large number of
individual scholarship and
student-loan funds for ‘‘promis-
ing and worthy students.”

A native of Northumberland
County, Va., she was married in
1921 to Alfred I. duPont. He died
in 1935.

Announcing the grant from
the Jessie Ball duPont Fund,
W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley remarked: ‘‘Mrs. du-
Pont’s abiding interest in
Washingtpn and Lee for more
than three decades during her
lifetime strengthened this
university literally to an im-
measurable extent. In _par-
ticular, I have in mind the ex-
traordinary opportunities she
provided to hundreds upon hun-
dreds of young men whose at-
tendance here became possible
through her far-sighted philan-
thropy. I am proud to be able to
say that I was one of ‘her boys’
during my own student days at
Washington and Lee.”

“So it is particularly gratify-
ing, both on behalf of the univer-
sity and personally, to know
that the faith and confidence
Mrs. duPont demonstrated time
and time again in Washington
and Lee are continued in this
grant from the Jessie Ball du-
Pont Fund and that the singular
reach of her influence continues
to touch and sustain this univer-
sity.”’

A portrait of Mrs. duPont
hangs in Washington Hall, the
main building at Washington
and Lee. The painting was
unveiled in 1974 at Mount Ver-
non by her brother, Edward
Ball of Jacksonville, a trustee of
the Jessie Ball duPont Fund
created in her will.

Gifts Help Meet
Operating Expenses

The annual fund at
Washington and Lee University
raised $802,439 in unrestricted
gifts for operating expenses last
year, according to final figures
released by the university.

The record-high total reflects
an increase of almost 14 percent
over the previous year’s annual
fund total, $705,866, which itself
had set a record.

The size of the average gift
set another record at $142.22, up
from $135.74 a year ago, and
participation jumped to 36.6
percent of all W&L alumni from
the previous year’s 32.3 per-
cent.

W&L counts only gifts from

alumni and parents in its an-
nual fund figures, and only gifts
which are unrestricted and in-
tended to be spent for operating
expenses. Gifts to the universi-
ty’s permanent endowment,
together with all contributions
from friends and from business,
including Washington and Lee’s
share of gifts made through the
12-member Virginia Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges, are not included in the
annual fund totals.

In 1977-78, the $802,439 paid 8.
percent of Washington and
Lee’s $10-million general
operating budget.

New Scholarship
Fund Announced

An endowed scholarship fund
has been established at
Washington and Lee University
in honor of a 1917 graduate of
the W&L law school, Robert
Hancock Jones.

The endowment’ was
established by his brother,
George Rather Jones, a 1937
B.A. graduate of W&L.

Both men live in Dallas.
Robert Hancock Jones, for
whom the scholarship fund is
named, is a retired attorney.

End Of Year Honors
Given To Students

Swimmer John S. Hudson
headed the list of award win-
ners as he was named the reci-
pient of the Preston R. Brown
Memorial Award at the season-
ending ‘All Sports Barbeque
and Award Ceremony” which
was last held May 23rd in the
Warner Athletic Center. The
Preston R. Brown Award is
given to Washington and Le®’s
Most Valuable Senior Athlete
for overall performance and
athletic proficiency during his
college career. It is voted on by
members of the athletic depart-
ment staff, and is considered
the highest honor a Washington
and Lee athlete may receive.

In four years, Hudson has
achieved All-American honors
seventeen different times. Head
coach Bill Stearns calls Hudson,
“By far and away, the best
swimmer in the University’s
history.”” Hudson was W&L’s
first ever national champion
winning the 500 and _ 1650
freestyle events as a
sophomore. He has been a state
of Virginia champion eight
times, is a school record holder

in six events, holds the state
record as a member of the W&L
800 free relay team, and has
been named W&L’s outstanding
swimmer in each of his four
years in Lexington.

Seniors Jeff Slatcoff and
Mark Duncan, both 1977 football
co-captains, were named co-
recipients of the Wink Glasgow
Spirit and Sportsmanship
Award. The Wink Glasgow
Award has been given annually

Since 1958 ‘‘to the W&L
senior(s) who has
demonstrated the _ highest

qualties of true W&L spirit and
sportsmanship in his career.”
This marked the first year that
there have been two winners.
Jim Herbert (Winston-Salem,
N.C.) was named the winner of
the Outstanding Freshman
Athlete award. That award was
established in 1960 to honor the
freshman athlete who showed
the most athletic ability
through his participation in one
or more sports. Herbert played
defensive back in football and
was a defenseman on W&L’s na-
tionally ranked lacrosse team.

with a feeling of goodwill’ —and
one of happiness for the suc-
cessful completion of the
University’s  building-
development program of the
1970’s.
Ok OK

Mr. Leach is indeed a happy
man this fall. After two years of
dynamite and dust, his pet crea-
tion is standing: The solution to
one of W&L’s most frustrating
needs.

McCormick Library, built in
1941, was adequate in its day
day. It housed 110,000 volumes
for a student body of 710
undergrads. But by 1966, the
student body had already in-
creased by 50 percent, and the
number of library holdings
doubled. And in the past 12
years, W&L’s student popula-
tion became nearly 1,400—with
700 different courses taught
every year here, and a fivefold
growth of the library budget.

It was soon after the
“critical’’ label was put on in
the 1966 Self-Study report that
desperate work and research
began. Further renovation of
McCormick was impossible;
that facility became the logical
choice for the new commerce
school in the 1970’s as they con-
tinue to cram into Newcomb
Hall. By 1968, with President
Huntley’s arrival, the central
campus location was suggested
and approved. Board of
Trustees approval on construc-
tion came in 1970. Even so,
designs could not be finalized
until 1974, and funds remained a
consistent problem until 1976.
That summer, $5.4

million(from two estates) was
received by the University—
and with that signal, ground-
breaking began almost im-
mediately.

The new undergrad library is
already predicted to become
the center of the campus—and
no wonder. Roughly four times
larger than McCormick in
square feet, the building has
five floors. It is cleverly built to
straddle the rocky cliffside of
Woods Creek Valley, so that it
will not interfere with the
panorama of the front buildings
(it will be as high as the first
floor of Washington Hall,
descending four stories more in-
to the valley itself).

Billed as one of the most im-
pressive library structures in
the country, a brief comparison
with McCormick tends to back
up the statement. The new
library will seat over 800 peo-
ple, including some 560 in-
dividual carrels (the figures for
McCormick are 300 and 100,
respectively). Fully air condi-
tioned and carpeted, perhaps
the happiest news of all is that
the building will be open 24
hours a day. Two elevators will
serve all floors. And the back
wall of every floor will be
predominantly glass, with
study areas and lounge chairs
looking out over Lewis Hall and
the countryside beyond.

Increased space has allowed
for several other ‘‘extras’’ to be
included. An _ auditorium,
seating 100 people, will be open
to Contact and other speakers.
31 small locked studies, located
off the stacks, will be available
to faculty and honors thesis
students. And many other

“open”’ studies for typing study
sessions, etc., will be scattered
throughout.

Leach is returning the carrels
and open studies to the ‘‘squat-
ters’ rights’ system that used
to characterize McCormick
Library 20 years ago. There will
be no more set assignments to
these places. ‘‘With increased
space for students, we hope that
a rule of first-come, first-serve
will suffice and be respected,”’
Leach commented.

The stack space is an im-
pressive feature—able to ac-
comodate 500,000 volumes or
more. Present holdings will on-
ly fill 35-40% of this area, leav-
ing encouraging room for
growth.

Above all, the faculty is what
Leach called a ‘“‘low-abrasion
building.”’ The idea of a ‘‘main
reading room’’ has been done
away with, and students will
find comfortable areas all over
the 5 stories. The addition of the
small studies and seminar
rooms, he added, has the pur-
pose of retaining the communi-
ty atmosphere of McCormick
Library.

So the light is at the end of the
tunnel six months early for
W&L’s single most impressive
facility—a lasting reminder, in
Mr. Leach’s mind, of two main
points. As he said, “First, the
support and guidance of the
Board of Trustees was beyond
description, as they gave us
everything we could want. And
I believe the new library will
serve as a symbol for W&L’s
renaissance under Huntley in
the 1970’s—a rebirth that has
come to fruition in one short
decade.”’

Maatman Is Awarded

In late July, Washington and
Lee’s championship golfer,
Jerry Maatman, was awarded a
$1,500 N. C.A.A. post graduate
scholarship. Maatman, who
was an Honor Roll history stu-
dent, was the nation’s only col-
legiate golfer to win this
prestigious scholarship. Maat-
man’s four year career
culminated in his receiving All
American honors two years; a
first for Washington and Lee
golf. A graduate of New Trier
High in Wilamette, Illinois, he
won all of his fifty  in-

Maatman’s final year was
successful as he shot a record
low at Longwood Country Club

in Longwood, Va. and ended his
career by shooting a record set-
ting tally of sixty-nine at the
Wooster Country Club in Ohio.
This record was set during the

national championship tourney
in which he placed third. Jerry
Maatman’s coach, Buck Leslie

commented on his young stan-
dout, calling him, “If not the
best golfer certainly one of the
top three ever to play at the
University.’’ Maatman’s play-
ing career brought W&L
several outstanding honors. On
this note, Leslie displays the

praise characteristic of a proud
coach, saying, ‘“Jerry’s the
most dedicated man I’ve ever
coached. He’s an All-American
player and an All-American in-
dividual in the true sense of the
word.”

“ARR ERR ee

Political Clubs

Speak Out

Young Democrats

College Republicans

by Lee Cave

The Washington and Lee
University Young Democrats
will hold their first meeting of
the new year next week at a
time soon to be announced. The
purpose of this meeting will be
to orient new members to the
organization. A guest speaker
and a short reception are plann-
ed.

After two years of building a
Young Democrats organization,
the club is ready to take an ac-
tivist role in local and state
politics.

Explains Ben Winn, Vice-
President of the organization,
“there are many issues this
year and it is time that the two
political clubs on this campus
start debating these issues. Of
particular concern are: a na-
tional energy policy, an
intelligently-made tax cut,
genocide in Cambodia, welfare
reform, civil service reform,
and archaic sex and marijuana
laws.”’

Campaign work will occupy
much of the club’s activities.
Andy Miller, who addressed the
W&L Young Democrats two
years ago, is the U.S. Senate
nominee. Says Lee Cave, the
club’s current president,
“Miller is one of the most ex-
perienced and credible can-
didates for the Senate from
Virginia in years. He has a good
record from his years as At-
torney General, and you can bet
that he will take Virginia’s
ideas on balanced budgets and
taxes to Washington. Miller is
hard-working and very familiar
with the state and its people.”

Membership to the YD’s will
be open for the next few weeks.
Everyone interested in joining
is invited to attend the club’s
first meeting.

by C. Randall Talley

The Washington and Lee
Republicans held their fall
membership drive Monday and
Tuesday, and response was
very good, according to Club
President John Saylor. Final
numbers are not yet available,
but Saylor said that, for a non-
presidential election year, he
was pleased with the results.

The Republicans’ first
meeting of the year will be
tonight at 7 p.m. in the Student
Center in rooms 112 and 113.
The meeting is for all who wish
to find out more about the Club
and its work. Some things
already planned are a picnic
behind Woods Creek Apart-
ments next Friday, with other
College Republican clubs
around the state coming to Lex-
ington to help kick off the school
year, bumper branding this
Saturday, campaign work with

‘some of the women’s colleges,

and mixers. Dates and times
will be announced closer to the
events. Guest speakers are also
being contacted.

Anyone who has not joined the
club and would like to can go to
the meeting tonight or call
Membership Chairman Ray
Nugent at 463-4427.

From The White Book

From time to time, the Ring-
tum Phi, in conjunction with the
Executive Committee, will
publish exerpts from the White
Book to highlight the recent
changes in_ procedure.

Any E.C. member receiving
information indicating that an
Honor System violation may
have been committed shall
report that fact to the president
of the Student Body. Two E.C.
members selected randomly
Shall be chosen to investigate
the allegations. In addition, a
third student investigator shall

be selected from the Student
Body at large by these two E.C.
investigators. The third student
investigator must, however,
come from the same school
within the University as that of
the suspected Honor Violator. If
after investigating the charges,
any two of the three in-
vestigators feel that there is
sufficient evidence of a possible
honor violation of the Honor
System, the President of the
Student Body shall immediately
refer the matter to the Ex-
ecutive Committee.
