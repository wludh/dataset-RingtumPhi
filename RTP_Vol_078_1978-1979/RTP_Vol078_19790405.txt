Fraternities Under Fire

by David Greer

It looks like time could be run-
ning out for fraternities.

A proposal to ban fraternity-
sponsored (weekday) parties
and hazing was presented to the
faculty at its meeting Monday.

The proposal, drafted by Dr.
Edward Pinney, asks the Inter-
fraternity Council to ‘‘devise a
code of social and residential
behavior in fraternity houses”

- that would include conformity

to the noise ordinance, restric-
tions of parties sponsored by
fraternities to weekends, and a
ban on ‘‘hazing.”

me

According to the proposal,
violations of the code would
result in “‘penalties of social
probation of periods from a
minimum of 60 days to one full
semester.”

The proposal states that ‘‘it is
the opinion of the faculty that
the quality of fraternity house
life at the University has fallen,
in some cases, to degrading
levels inimical to the Universi-
ty‘s mission.”

According to Dean of
Students Lewis John, the pro-
posal has been sent to the IFC,
the University Council, and the
Student Affairs Committee. The
proposal is on the agenda for
the faculty meeting on May 6
and could be voted on then.

The proposal requests that
the code be submitted to the
faculty before May 20 ‘‘so that it
may be judged in time for the
last General Meeting of the
Faculty, the Baccalaureate
Meeting “‘

Dr. Edward Pinney o

It should be noted that the
Board of Trustees has given the

faculty the power to oversee

student life.

Pinney said that other
members of the faculty were in-
volved in the proposal. When
asked about his motives for
presenting the proposal and in-
cluding certain items in it, Pin-
ney said, ‘‘My motives are none
of your bloody business.”

Dr. Pinney is the faculty ad-
visor for Sigma Nu fraternity.

The proposal comes in the *

wake of a year of conflict bet-
ween the fraternities and the
faculty, police, townspeople,
and administration.

This year has seen many
fraternities issued summonses
for violation of Lexington’s
noise ordinance and fines im-
posed by the IFC for those
fraternities who were in viola-
tion.

The IFC placed restrictions
on fraternities’ partying in light
of the violations and attempts
were made to reach an agree-
ment to modify the law. The ci-
ty council would not act on the
issue and so the law stands. -

Concern from alumni, ad-
ministration, faculty, and
townspeople prompted monthly

. inspections of the conditions of

fraternity houses. Many houses
failed inspections and were
placed on social probation.

Specific fraternities have
been banned from holding func-
tions at some of the neighboring
women’s colleges.

The president of the Universi-
ty addressed the IFC about his
concern with deterioration of
fraternities and the fraternity
system.

One fraternity was placed on |

social probation for holding an
activity that supposedly in-
terferred with a _ pledge’s
schoolwork. Professors have
expressed concern about low at-
tendance of Thursday classes.

The proposal was met with
mixed reactions among the
faculty and students, but both
bodies are concerned about the
issue.

 

Faculty Proposal For Fraternity Conduct

Motion: That ;
I. The IFC shall undertake, before the end of this academic year, to devise a code of
social and residential behavior in fraternity houses, that must as a minimum include the
following rules and injunctions:

(1) “House Parties,” with or without live music, must be confined to. weekends
(Fridays and Saturdays) and must terminate at reasonable hours, i.e., no later than 1:00
a.m.

(2) All fraternity ‘‘hazing’”’ of pledges must be discontinued. ‘“‘Hazing’’ means any
house-sponsored activity that involves physical abuse such as paddling, verbal abuse
such as shouting, or any other grossly undignified behavior such as group shouting, jum-
ping up and down, soaking with water or other liquids, or repeated performance of ritual
exercise, blindfolded or-otherwise.

(3) Noise levels must be reduced, with particular attention to those occasions that ex-
tend into the evening hours, toa point consistent with local noise ordinances.

(4) The above paragraphs do not exhaust the subject of unacceptable behavior at
fraternity houses, but they should convey to the IFC the clear intent and tone of this
resolution.

II. It is not possible in this short statement to be comprehensively specific about accep-
table behavior. The meaning of “‘hazing,” for example, could be the subject of much
dispute. Still, it is the sense of the Faculty that the quality of fraternity house life at the
University has fallen, in some cases, to degrading levels inimical to the University’s mis-
sion. It specifically charges the IFC with responsibility for enforcement of these provi-
sions. It is our sincere hope that the IFC will be resolute and consistent in approaching
this duty and in meeting its responsibility for fraternity government conferred on the
IFC by faculty delegation ten years ago. Toward that end, House violations will carry
penalties of social probation of periods from a minimum of 60 days to one full semester, a
penalty to carry over into the next term if need be. As disagreeable as some of this may
be, any alternative solution to this pressing problem is almost certain to be far more
disagreeable... -

Please put together your code before the 20th of May and convey its contents to the
Secretary of the Faculty (Mr. Harold Head), so that it may be judged in time for the last
General Meeting of the Faculty, the Baccalaureate Meeting.

April 24.

Syd Farrar
Reacts

“| knew it was coming, I was
not surprised,’”’ said Syd Far-
rar, the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s newly elected president of
the faculty proposal to draw up
a code of ‘‘social and residential
behavior in fraternity houses.”’

Among Farrar’s complaints
with the proposal is its release
so close to exams and that the
motion’s drafters “never gave
the new IFC Judicial Board a
chance.”’

“I’m not saying that we (the
IFC) would have come up with
proposals as strict,” Farrar
said, “but I knew Wednesday
night parties would have to go,
in one form or another.”

Instead of eliminating week-
day parties completely, Farrar
is hopeful that they can be

Evans Dining Hall
To Be Expanded

Construction will. begin this
week on a $795,000 expansion of
the kitchen facilities in
Washington and Lee Universi-

ty’s Evans Dining Hall.
The project — which will be
completed before

undergraduate classes resume
in September — will add an
1,800-square-foot wing onto the
building between the existing
kitchen and a dormitory
building immediately to the
west. The addition will replace
a loading dock.

The facade of the new wing
will blend in with the line of
buildings along that side of
Washington Street from the
university’s Student Center
through the dormitory complex.

The expansion will effectively
double the size of the kitchen
facilities in Evans Hall. The
project is necessary, university
officials note, because Evans
was designed 20 years ago to
serve an average of 350 students
per meal, but today it in fact
serves an average of 600 to 650
per meal, and often as many as
800 at a time.

As a consequence, refrigera-
tion, food-storage, and bak-

ing.and cooking space had
become impossibly overcrowd-
ed and inadequate.

The $795,000 figure includes
$145,000 in new equipment.

Most of the construction
through mid-May will be on the

- outside, with no disruption of

regular food service in Evans.

Beginning soon after W&L’s
spring alumni reunions May 11
and 12, however, inside work is
expected to begin, and the
university will have to make a
number of accommodations to
keep service open.

To as great an extent as possi-
ble, the Evans Hall staff will
simply work around construc-
tion crews, according to Gerald
J. Darrell, manager of food ser-
vices at Washington and Lee.
That may include a_ con-
siderable amount of late-night
and early-morning food
preparation.

Some meals will be cooked in
the Cockpit, W&L’s restaurant
which is located in an adjoining
wing on the other side of Evans
Hall.

There will be a large number
of outdoor cookouts and

Professors Speak Out on Fraternities

Dr. Milton

Colvin

‘‘T believe fraternities can be
a very real and positive force on
a college campus and I’m not
opposed to fraternities per se,
but when fraternities abuse
their privileges or become a
refuge for those who wish to
prolong adolescence, or when
they simply become insensitive
to community norms, then they
should be shut down—and with
a bang,”’ said Dr. Milton Colvin
of the politics department.

Colvin, who was a member of
Zeta Psi fraternity at Yale
University, believes that some
of Washington and Lee’s frater-
nities have overstepped their

bounds and have become
‘insensitive to community
norms.”

‘I don’t want to deny frater-
nities their fun, I simply want to
keep it at a level of modera-
tion,’ Colvin said.

He used Delta Tau Delta as an
example of one of the bad
iraternities. ‘‘The Delt house
should be closed immediately ,”’
he said.

Colvin cited the use in public
of language ‘‘appropriate to a
platoon of recruits, not a com-
munity of women and children’”’
and litter around the fraternity
house as signs that the Delts
have a “‘lack of consideration
for their neighbors.”

‘Students are guests in Lex-
ington,’’ Colvin said. ‘‘They are
fortunate that they are in a
community that has a tolerance
for fraternity life, but that
tolerance has worn thin by
public drunkenness, destroying
furniture, litter, and a noise

 

level that is unconscionable at
certain times of the day.”’

He said that in his own frater-
nity ‘“‘we neither smashed fur-
niture or littered the premises,
but I do not believe that we
drank less.”

“Fraternities can be a place
where young men can learn to
be leaders and shoulder respon-
sibility,’ Colvin said. ‘“‘If
leadership goes by default, and
responsibility is shirked, then
the fraternity becomes an
adolescent playpen, and it is not
in the tradition of Washington
and Lee to encourage perpetual
adolescence.”’

‘My opinion is that if frater-
nities do not abide by the laws of
the community and do not abide
by the rules of the University,
then they have no business on
this campus,”’ Colvin said.

“It is up to fraternity leaders
to take charge and put their
houses in order,” he said. “If
not, they should be closed
without regret and without
remorse.”

But Colvin is not an advocate
of closing all fraternities
because of the behavior of a
few. ‘I don’t want to throw the
baby out with the bathtub,’’ he

(continued on page 6)

Dr. John Evans

“Fraternities, once upon a
time, served more than one
function at Washington and
Lee. They were a place of
refuge for those who were work-
ing very hard. They are now a
place for students to fill up emp-
ty time because they are not
working hard.”

So says Dr. John Maurice
Evans, English professor and
advisor to Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity. Evans sees many
problems in the fraternity
system, but feels those pro-
blems are more deep-rooted
than just loud, late parties.

Evans says that fraternites
used to be ‘‘a training ground
for the upper middle class, the
ruling class. Fraternities are
now a playground.”

“I do not think fraternities
are a bad thing,” says Evans.
“They should be encouraged to
ripen and mature.”

Evans sees a problem stemm-
ing from the attitude toward
alchohol and the fact that the
social code for one to behave
oneself while drinking has all
but disappeared.

atte

‘In the old days, when liquor
was the main drug, gentlemen
were taught to hold their li-
quor.”’ Other drugs, especially
marijuana, replaced drinking
for a while, and so the tradition
of how to “drink like a man”’
disappeared. ‘Now drinking
has come back without the
tradition,” Evans says.
Formerly, upperclassmen
would supervise the younger
students when they were first
exposed to alchohol--usually in
college, as little drinking took
place in high school, he said.
“*The seniors are no longer ac-
ting to train the puppies, put
them to bed when they get ram-

Dr. Jay Cook

Dr. Jay Cook, accounting pro-
fessor at Washington and Lee,
says the fraternities are the
worst they’ve been in 26 years.

That’s how long he’s been
here as a professor. Cook was a
student here and a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Cook said that the fraternity
situation ‘‘was very bad in the
early sixties. -The Dean of

Students was supposed to exer- —

cise control.’’ When he didn’t,
the faculty ‘‘set up a committee
and set very strict rules about
fraternity life.”

“The UC (University Coun-
cil) has done absolutely
nothing, so it’s about time the
power came back to the facul-
a

As for the faculty stepping in
to set rules for the fraternities,
Cook said, ‘‘If the students are
going to act in detriment to
their interests and the interests
of the. University, then we
should step in.”’

As for the recent proposal to
the faculty to restrict fraternity
activities, Cook said, “I have no
objection to the proposal.”’

Cook added, ‘“‘My Thursday
classes have been terrible’’ in

relation to attendance.

Cook objects to fraternity-
sponsored mid-week parties
because students pay for them
whether they go or not, and this
either encourages students to
neglect studies or forces
students to pay for something
they are not getting.

“Everybody in the fraternity
is charged, whether he goes or
not. This I object to — this is
anti-academic,”’ he said.

Cook believes that the
students have to face the conse-
quences of missed study time
and classes, but says, ‘‘I don’t
think they‘re old enough to face
this, especially the freshmen
and sophomores. I don’t think
they’re mature enough when
they get here.”’

Dr. Michael
Pleva

Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
Associate Professor of
Chemistry, feels changes need
to be made in the present frater-
nity system.

He feels that there should be
less pressure on incoming
freshmen to join a fraternity.
He believes that fraternity
rushing should be delayed until
the spring of the freshman year.
“That way he (the freshman)
gets a chance to know the place
before committing himself,”
Pleva stated. He added that
such a system worked at the
college he attended.

Also, he feels that fraternities
do not have the right to put “‘im-
mature’ freshmen through
something they cannot handle.
Pleva felt that most freshmen
can handle the various fraterni-
ty activities. But he is thinking
about those who have trouble
with studies and fraternity ac-
tivities, when he suggests the
delayed rush.

Pleva speculated that his sug-
gestion might “reduce the
number of pledges, but maybe
fraternities will treat the
pledges better,”’ he stated. He
added that not all fraternities
are that way.

Pleva_is against physical
abuse associated with pledging
a fraternity. He stated ‘‘I’m
afraid it will come down to
someone getting hurt or killed
before it all stops.’’ He added,
“There are other alternatives,
such as painting and repairing
the houses’ stuff that is not
physically abusive.”’

“From what I’ve seen and
heard of the present situation, I
am against it,” stated Pleva.

 

Correction

Last week’s article about the
resignation of W&L swimming
coach William J. Stearns er-
roneously implied that Stearns
had been evicting tenants from
his housing.

To clarify the record,
Stearns, to our knowledge, has
not evicted any tenants. In fact,
he has helped several of the peo-
ple living in his houses on Henry
Street (which we highlighted
several months ago) relocate.

The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
error and apologizes for any in-
convenience it may have caus-
ed Mr. Stearns.

For Stearns’ remarks on the
same article, see Letters to the
Editor, page 11.

The Ring-tum Phi Poll was con-
ducted by Randy Smith as his last
official act as News Editor before
leaving for Washington. Because
of space limitations only part of
the results can appear this week;
more will be printed this spring.

The Ring-tum Phi Student
Opinion Poll was conducted on
March 26 during the
Washington and Lee student
elections for class officers for
the academic year 1979-80.

The poll was available to
anyone who wanted to fill one
out and register his opinion.

Although the poll cannot be
taken as an accurate measure
of student opinion as a whole for
those three academic classes, it
is useful as a representative
sample of the opinions held by
those three groups.

Preparations are now under-

Multiple sclerosis is the wor-
thy cause which benefits from
the time and energy of the run-
ners, and according to commit-
tee member Burr Datz, “total
involvement”’ is the goal for this
year’s marathon race. Towards
that end, the race is being
publicized in national running
magazines. In addition, all run-
ners on the 15 kilometer (9.3
miles) course will receive a free
tee-shirt.

A special two-mile race, the
“fun run,” will also be held fo
for those who cannot run the
longer course.

Letters have been sent out to
local businessmen requesting
their support this year, and two
law students, runners in the
Boston Marat Marathon, have
helped to plan the route of the
race, which will start and finish
at W&L’s Wilson Field. .

Trophies will be awarded to

The China Syndrome :

From movie theater to front page

by Dick Barron

No, The China Syndrome
hasn’t been to Lexington, and it
probably won’t be for some
time now, but your intrepid
reviewer drove to Roanoke
recently to see this most impor-
tant film. It’s truly amazing to
see this film about nuclear
power in the aftermath of the
nuclear accident near Har-

the most believable actress
working today.

Jack Lemmon, the supervisor
of the ‘‘Ventana”’ plant is no
Slouch either. In fact, if it’s
possible, he does a better acting
job than Fonda — his every
move is used with maximum ef-
fect.

eager photographer of the

waves for months to come.

 

risburg, Pa. Objectivity prac-
tically leaps out the window
because what was science fic-
tion at the film’s release has un-
fortunately become science fact
—a true life thriller.

Fictional Meltdown

If you haven’t heard already,
The China Syndrome, starring
Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon,
and Michael Douglas depicts a
near meltdown at the fictitious
Ventana nuclear power plant
near Los Angeles. With nerve-
testing pace, the lights flash,
the ground shudders, people run
around like crazy, and the crisis
is eventually averted. The China
Syndrome deals not only with
the potential catastrophe, but
also with many of the touchy
issues surrounding the volatile
nuclear power industry. Many
questions about corporate and
media ethics are raised.

$12 million gross

The backwash from this film
has been immense. The March
30 Washington Post reports that
The China Syndrome grossed
$12 mil. in its first two weeks.
But even before release ‘“‘real-
life utility company lobbyists
launched a concerted effort to
downplay the credibility of the
movie.” And after the film’s
release, executives and _ lob-
byists got a big surprise when
the plant at Three Mile Island
threatened to self-destruct.

Regardless of the coinciden-
tal events of the past week, the
film itself deserves strong com-
mendation. As a thriller in its
own right, The China Syndrome
takes on a motion, a drive, a life
of its own as each harrowing
detail flashes past.

Jane Fonda

Jane Fonda is Kimberly
Welles, the T.V. feature
reporter who is looking for her
big story. Her zealous
character drives a_ hard
bargain, but she realizes soon
that there’s a bit more to the
problem than meets the eye.
Fonda has, in recent years,
become a major actress, giving
consistent and searing per-
formances — she’s just about

nuclear accident, luckily film-
ing inside the plant during the
event. His high energy
character burns throughout — a
man with a mission. Practically
every character is determined
to get his message across,
regardless of who or what gets

in the way. That adds insult to
injury as the characters battle
it out in and around the tower-
ing nuclear plant.

Director James Bridges must
be credited with a flawless job
in adding motion and rhythm to
a film which could have easily
fallen on its back. He uses the
superb cast to its fullest —
holding brightly lit shots when
necessary, adding quick cuts to
intensify strained situations,
and moving the camera with a
brilliant Hollywood high style.
Important to any film is con-
trast, visual or aural, and
Bridges ‘-has added these to
make this one of the most
visually entertaining and ex-
citing films since All the Presi-
dent’s Men. The China Syn-
drome is, hands down, a bright
achievement among the many

Roll over, Rock. Die, Disco.

Whether it’s the beat of the
American Indian Ceremonial
War Drum, the twang of the
Andes Harp, the trill of the Gyp-
sy Flute, or the drone of the
Afghanistani Harmonium,
Americans should be listening
to a different drummer Perhaps
a Pygmy drummer from the
African Rain Forest. In the fif-
ties it was Folk, in the sixties it
was Rock, in the seventies it’s
Disco but in some places for the
past five or ten thousand years
it’s been Ethnic. Well, Ethnic to
most of us.

Ethnic has always been
“in’’...somewhere. Ethnic is
“Old Wave.’ Who needs a
studio when you can go out into
the field and record such things
as the ‘Mushroom Ceremonry
of the Mazatec Indians of Mex-

“Falstaff’’ soundtrack explained

Dear Editor:

We wish to take this opprotunity publicly to
express our regret for the difficulties in the
sound track of Orson Welles’ Falstaff, the
Film Society’s most recent movie. We were
told by the distributor that there would be
some problem with the sound, but we had no
idea how serious it would be. We would also
like to thank the many people who stayed for
the duration to enjoy the beauties of Welles’
visualization of Shakespeare’s material.

Welles has had an odd career, perhaps even
a tragic one. After the financial failure and
the legal threats surroundingCitizen Kane
(Randolph Hearst, on whom Kane was in part
modeled, attempted to block the movie's
release), the big studios refused to allow
Welles full artistic control over his projects,
and he made most of his subsequent films in-
dependently. Falstaff makes manifest some
of the hazards of independent film produc-

tion: the soundtrack was added after the com-
pletion of the film because of severe
budgetary limitations, and the voice
reproduction remains inadequate. One of the
most ambitious and original of all movie
directors has thus been forced to work under
conditions which have hobbled his creative
energies.

We hope all of you will give our series
another go when we present our next two
screeings: a double bill of The Running Fence
and Memories of Underdevelopment (in late
April); and We All Loved Each Other So
Much (in late May). We are especially
grateful to the S.A.B. whose recently renewed
generosity helps make these last two presen-
tations possible.

Sincerely,

Jay Diesing

Glee Club Chronicles...

While most of you enjoyed
home life on our recent
Washington Holiday, the W&L
Glee Club followed a 2300-mile
concert tour through 7 southern
states. The tour was organized
by Dr. Gordon Spice, director,
and was facilitated greatly by
the cooperation of W&L alumni
and friends along the way. The
University’s ‘‘singing am-
bassadors’’ performed to en-
thusiastic audiences in Chapel
Hill and Raleigh, North
Carolina; Rome, Georgia; and
Jackson, Mississippi during the
week-long Washington Holiday
tour.

The tour began in Chapel Hill,
where the club was greeted by
the worst blizzard to hit that
area in 31 years. The group’s
chartered bus literally plowed
its way to Raleigh where a joint
concert with Meredith College
was scheduled. Classes were

cancelled at Meredith, resulting
in numerous opportunities for
W&L men and Meredith women
to try sledding, building snow-
persons and otherwise to enjoy
a southern version of Dart-
mouth’s ‘‘Winter Carnival.”
The evening’s concert was held
on schedule and featured the
combined choirs performing
Haydn’s ‘“‘Te Deum’ (with
piano accompaniment
substituting for a snowed-in or-
chestra).

After the blizzards of North
Carolina, the singers headed
south and west, to the Darl-
ington School in Rome,
Georgia, where an enthusiastic
audience heard the glee club
and Southern Comfort perform
an hour-long program, climax-
ed, as usual, by a rousing rendi-
tion of ‘“The Swing.”

weary singers, a city where
Southern hospitality prevailed.
Following a short program for
the Galloway United Methodist
Church, the club performed two
hour-long concerts at Jackson
Preparatory School and St. An-
drew’s Episcopal School.
Receptions for all three pro-
grams were enthusiastic and
the group was particularly
pleased with the friendliness ac-
corded them at Jackson’s two
fine preparatory schools.

Having sung six concerts in
five days, the glee club was
ready for some “‘rest and relax-
ation.”’ Being a mere four-hour
drive away, what could have
been more inviting than two
days in New Orleans! Despite
torrential rains and_ the
cancellation of Mardi Gras
parades, the W&L fun-seekers
were not to be denied.
“Breakfast at Brennan’s’’ was
followed by oysters at Felix’s,
cocktails at Anything Goes, jazz
at Preservation Hall and final-
ly, sing-alongs at Pat O’Brien’s.
(It was observed on two suc-
cessive evenings that the latter
establishment was almost
“taken over’ by W&L types,
resulting in unprecendented
repetitions of the W&L Swing! )

Reluctantly, the club left the
“crescent city’ to return to
books, studying and the rigors
of academia, stopping over-
night in Atalnta to release
whatever steam was left. They
disembarked the bus on campus
(in the rain, naturally) ex-
hausted, suffering severe cases
of ‘‘bus-lag.”’ but filled with
happy memories of the week-
long musical sojourn to the
south.

The concert tour accomplish-
ed two purposes, according to
Dr. Spice. ‘‘We made students,
alumni and friends aware of
Washington and Lee by our con-
certs and we solidified the glee
club by living together literally
24 hours-a-day for a week.
Whether singing a Renaissance
motet in the chapel at Darl-
ington or raising glasses to the
strains of ‘Vive l’amour’ in the
upper reaches of Atlanta’s
Peachtree Plaza, the W&L Glee
Club is something of which the
University can be very proud.”’

Tonio K.
Life in the Foodchain
Epicll Moon

About a week ago I was look-
ing through one of our rival
music publications and I came
across a review which said
something to the effect that a
man named Tonio K. had just
made the greatest album ever
recorded. So, despite a tenden-
cy on my part to be wary of such
claims (remember Devo), I
knew this was one I had to
check out.

Well, Life in the Foodchain
may not be the greatest album
ever recorded, but it is without
a doubt the funniest, raun-
chiest, and most stimulating
record I’ve heard in a long time.
Tonio K. has Americanized the
New Wave to the point where he
sounds like a cross between Lou
Reed and Jackson Browne if the
two of them had been locked in
a room together for three mon-
ths with nothing to sustain them
but 500 hits of LSD.

The album itself is organized
around a line in the title song
which talks about “‘life in the
foodchain’’ and “love among
the ruins.’’ Side one, subtitled
‘life in the foodchain,” presents
a series of little scenarios of
American life, similar (at least
as far as the lyrics go) to the

type of street dramas you would
expect from Tom Waits or
Bruce Springsteen.

Good as side one is (and in
spots its nothing short of in-
credible), it can’t help but seem
like a warm-up for side two,
which is probably the best con-
ceptual album side since side
two of Bruce Springsteen’s
“The Wild, the Innocent, and
the E Street Shuffle.’’ Tonio’s
vision of “love among the
ruins,’’ presumably meaning
the ruins of American society in
the ‘70’s, includes a love song to
a suspected vampire, threats to
physically destroy his woman if
she leaves him, and a song call-
ed ‘“‘H-A-T-R-E-D’’ which is
beyond any sort of description.

The only thing that worries
me about Tonio K. is that he
might follow the same path as
Warren Zevon and other similar
performers, who have found it
difficult if not impossible to sus-
tain the novelty of their humor
beyond the length of one album.
If he can do it (and my money
says that he can), forget rock‘n-
roll — he could well end being
the future of the world! (If
nothing else, it will be in-
teresting to see how John
Rockwell and the rest of the
folks at the New York Times
handle him — somehow, Mr. K.
jsut doesn’t cut it.)

Professors React

James
Boatwright

James Boatwright, professor
of English, says he sees more
parties that are noisier and go
on longer to be the problem fac-
ing fraternities and the source
of anti-fraternity feelings.

“It’s bad from the point of
view for those who live around
it and in so far as it affects the
performance of students, ‘‘ he
said.

‘‘What’s happening here
seems to be part of a pattern,”
he added. “It’s happening at
U.Va.’ it’s happening at Dart-
mouth.”

“Fraternities ought to
restrain themselves. There
should be more of a public sense
of themselves.”’

Boatwright, who was an SAE
at. the University of Georgia,
said, ‘‘My own fraternity was
not any more dignified or
gentlemanly than those around
here, but we didn’t party as
much. What we certainly didn’t
do was trash the house.”’

‘‘T think there are more pro-

blems with noise, with late par-.

ties,”’ said Boatwright, who has
been teaching here for 19 years.

‘Fraternities could find ways
to make the parties less noisy,
to make them end at a
reasonable time.”’

Boatwright points out that
students now have a greater
capacity for making noise in
that a student with a good

stereo can play music that

covers an entire block, even if .

   

 

he’s not having a party. This
was not likely in his day, he
says.

“I don’t have any objection to
parties one way or another,” he
said. ‘‘A student ought to have
the freedom of choice to do his
work or not do his work, and
face the consequences.”

The problem with mid-week
parties is that many students
feel they have to attend them
because they are paying for
them, he says.

‘‘Mid-week parties have
become an established institu-
tion, or at least that’s the way
students seethem’.”

Colvin

(continued from page 2)
said.

He also said that he is willing
to give fraternities some time
correct their problems. ‘One
has to allow time for change,”’
Colvin said. But he made it

_ Clear that time was running out.

“Where is the leadership in
the fraternities?’ he asked.
“And why don’t they throw the

troublemakers out?”

“Fraternity members will
say, ‘the faculty is forcing us to

“It would have been much

The Interfraternity Council
distributed copies of the faculty
proposal prohibiting mid-week
parties to the fraternities Tues-
day night.

IFC president Syd Farrar
asked the representatives to
take the proposal back to their
fraternities and return. with
comments and_ constructive
criticism.

Farrar hopes to address the
faculty about the proposal at its
next meeting. However, the on-
ly student that may address the
body is the student body presi-
dent.

Farrar said that if he cannot
speak to the faculty he will ask
Student Body President Beau
Dudley, to do it.

In other business, Farrar said

 

that members of the alumni in-
spection committee here last
week told him that they were
“really pleased”’ with the condi-
tion of the fraternity houses and
were “pleasantly surprised.”
He said that some alumni ex-
pressed desire to help the
fraternities; Farrar said he
suggested they help the frater-
nities financially.

The IFC voted to allow Don
Swagart, next year’s rush
chairman, to fill in for senior
justice Mike Mrlik for the Spr-

It was also announced that

tickets for $5 single-$7.50 cou-
ple. There will be 300 tickets
sold to non-fraternity members.

Profs
John M.
McDaniel

The threat of ‘“‘consumption”’
and the threat of alienating the
citizens of Lexington are two of
the major problems facing the
fraternity system. at
Washington and Lee, according
to Dr. John M. McDaniel.

McDaniel, who has_ been
teaching anthropology at W & L
for seven years, was student
here and a member of Delta.
Tau Delta.

“Fraternities could consume
students and be a threat to a
student’s academic affairs, but
are a threat only,’’ McDaniel
said. :

There are other forces that
can consume a student, he add-
ed.

“There is a need to look into
the situation,’’ he said. ‘‘Some
measure of attention has to be
exercised before relations with
the town further deteriorate.”

McDaniel says that not all
fraternities are a problem and
some are a problem’ only at
times.

_ ‘My concern is how do you
keep students from being con-

_ sumed by the attention of the

fraternities.”

McDaniel says that in some
instances “there has been a
decline in the care of the pro-
perty of the fraternities.”

McDaniel believes that where -
changes are needed, “it must
come from within the frater-
nities. If the fraternities are go-
ing to survive, they must en-
courage performance in the
academic realm.”’

Despite problems, McDaniel
feels that the fraternities can .
add much to a student’s life and
development.

bunctious,”” he says. ‘‘Socializ-
ing boys into men does not go
n.’’ Evans does not support the
idea of fraternity-sponsored
parties during the week.

“I have faced Thursday mor-
ning classes with hungover peo-
ple until I am not willing to do it
any more,”’ he says.

‘‘ Fraternities should not be
allowed to organize a formal

_ social event during the week,”’

Evans said, but he adds that he
has no objections to informal
parties during the week.
“Spending fraternity money
makes it (the party) an in-
vested thing to go down and get
a part of. There should be
severe penalties for organized
social functions.’’ Evans sees
the problem lying in cases
where a student who has study-
ing to do might neglect the stu-

‘ dying to attend a party he has

paid for.

Speaking on Cockpit bands
during the week, Evans said,
“There should be no tempta-
tions at the university during
the week.”’

There are short-comings in
the academic atmosphere at
WA&L, he feels, that are showing
themselves in fraternity pro-
blems.

“There is no social pressure
to be intellectual; there is great
social pressure to be anti-
academic,”’ he says.

Generals drop Brown

12-11 in

by Doug Linton

Each team’s goalie had 15
saves amid the pouring rain,
but the Bruins’ keeper let one
too many slip past him, as the
Generals edged Brown Univer-
sity 12-11 in overtime, yester-
day, on Wilson Field. Jeff Fritz
won the game for W&L with
1:22 left in the first sudden
death period, scoring with the
assist of a John Black pass in a
double man-up situation. This
victory, which ties the series
record with Brown at 1-1, was
the second such overtime win
for the Generals this season.

The Generals held an early
3-0 lead. Jay Foster assisted
Black, before Foster went on to
score an assisted goal himself.
After Fritz had the third tally,
the Bruins got their first. Foster
then scored his second, taking.a
pass from Fritz. Brown
responded with one more, but so
did Foster, who netted his third
goal of the quarter following a
pass from John Kemp. The
Bruins got one more to end the
period’s scoring at 5-3.

Brown narrowed the gap to
only one goal, scoring within 20
seconds of the second quarter.
Then it was John Hooper who,
for the second time in two
games, sparked a four goal stint
for the Generals. Foster had his
second assist, finding Hooper
open, to make it 7-4, and then
Fritz followed with still another
unassisted tally. After
Staugaitis’ second assist made
its way to Geoff Brent, who put
it in the back of the net, the
Generals were enjoying a 9-4
halftime lead. Most felt that the
game was in the bag, but the
men from Brown had other
ideas.

The third quarter was a long
and sloppy one, seeing each
team add only one goal to their
totals. The Generals’ tally came
from Black’s second goal, off of
Foster’s third assist.

W&L led 10-5 going into the
last period of play, and they
almost lost it. But as Coach
Jack Emmer will tell you, along
with the rest of his squad,
almost doesn’t count! Brown
had the first word of the
quarter, and then the second
word also, to make it 10-7. San-
dy McDonald responded with an
unassisted score to give the
Generals a four goal lead. But
the Bruins, trying to make their
long trip to Virginia worth-

x aia ce

  

 
 

day’s 12-11 win over Brown.

while, then began their come-
back. After successfully netting
three unanswered goals and
closing the score to 11-10, Brown
charged toward the General
goal one more time. It was a
four on three situation, but the
Bruins’ shot went off the pipe.
Rick Handelman picked the ball
up for Brown and had to make
four fakes before firing the ball
past Bob Clements to tie the
game at 11 all with only 1:57 left
to play. W&L’s last attempts to
score in the quarter were refus-
ed. Brown charged downfield
once more, even changing mid-
dies on the fly, but Clements
made a nice save to force the
game into overtime. But Brown
made one crucial mistake in
slashing defender Dave Nickels
with only a second left in the
quarter. This meant that the
Generals would enjoy a man-up
situation at the start of the sud-
den death period.

Kemp took the first shot in
overtime, but it was saved by
the Brown keeper. Black in-
terfered with the goalies clear
attempt, so the Bruins got the
ball at midfield. After W&L
pressured a bad pass, they
cleared the ball and shot once
more, but again in vain.

The big break came at 1:33.
Fritz was slashed, which would
have put the Generals a man-up
once more. Things couldn’t be
better, right? Wrong! The
referee then slapped a Brown
player with unsportsmanlike
conduct, which gave W&L a two
man advantage!Now _ things
couldn’t be better, and Fritz,
along with the rest of the
Generals, knew it, as he bounc-
ed a Black assist past the
Brown keeper for the winning
strike and his fourthScore of the
day.

When asked about the
pressure of shooting in over-
time, with the possibility of
turning the ball over to the
other team, Fritz simply
remarked, “You don’t think
about missing.” Fritz, who now
has 16 goals, trailing scoring
leader Black by four, was
awarded the game ball for his
efforts.

Coach Emmer said to
remember one thing - ‘“We won,
no matter how we did it!’’ He
feels that the squad is ‘‘a much
better team than we were
earlier in the season.’’ This is
good, because the road ahead is
going to be tough. But Emmer
feels confident that his club can
play with anybody.

Both the offense and the
defense were awesome as the
Generals more than tamed the
Tigers of Towson State by a
score of 13-7 on Saturday. This
was their eighth straight win
over Towson, and W&L now
leads the series 16-10.

The Generals got off to a slow
start as they fell behind early.
John Hooper had the first goal
for the squad off a John Black
pass, with Black himself netting
‘the Generals’ second, assisted
by Joe Olive. W&L fell one shy
of Towson’s early tallies and
trailed 3-2 at the end of the first
quarter. But that was the last
lead that the Tigers enjoyed for
the rest of the day.

The Generals tied the game at
3-3 early in the second period
when Rob Staugaitis found
Black open during an.extra man
situation. Jay Foster then fed
John Kemp, who gave the
Generals their first lead in the
game. W&L then scored their
third consecutive goal of the
period as Jeff Fritz netted one
unassisted. Towson bounced
back to score two more, the se-
cond being a man-up goal, to tie
the game at five apiece.
Staugaitis got his second feed of
the day on a crucial pass to
Jerry Broccoli, who scored an
equally crucial goal to give W &
L a 6-5 halftime lead, one that
they would not relinquish.

The Generals opened the
scoring of the third quarter as
Foster gave his second assist to
Black, who netted his third of
the game. Fritz then scored his

second unassisted goal and it

THE

  

Swimming season:

a final look

A Commentary
by Mike Foley
Some may view the 1978-79 swimming season as unsuccessful.
This view is accurate only when one contrasts this team with the
extraordinary success of Coach Stearns’ squads in past years and
one refuses to recognize that the opponents they faced were
scholarship-ladden Division I schools. Although the swim team lost
blue chippers John Hudson, W&L’s only national champion, and
Dave Kent, a two time state champion, the swimmers finished the
season with a 27th place finish in the Division III National Cham-
pionships. Over 300 schools are members of the NCAA Division III.
To top off Coach Stearn’s final year at W&L, Drew Pillsbury of
Grosse Point, Michigan has earned All-American distinction for the
first time in his career. Pillsbury finished in 6th place in the 200
yard backstroke which missed Dave Kent’s school record by less
than .4 of a second. The junior backstroker also gained All-
American honors in the 100 yd. backstroke, finishing in 11th palce.
Earlier this year, Pillsbury was selected as a member of the

Virginia State Tournament water polo team, in which he led the

W&L team in scoring. He was also water polo co-captain.

Joining Pillsbury was Swim Team co-captain Chip Hoke of Rich-
mond, Va. who earned All-American distinction for the 4th time in
his career. Hoke swam his best race of the year in the 1650, in
finishing in 11th place.

The biggest disappointment of the meet was the failure of senior
co-captain Keith Romich to add to his All-American honors.
Romich, a six time All-American, went on a special diet 3 weeks
before the Nationals as did freshman Mike Bernot. Side effects
from the diet rather than benefits resulted in Romich’s worst na-
tional performance since he has been at W&L. It is indeed tragic to
have this team leader’s illustrious career end in disappointment.
Among the other honors Romich has earned are All-East in water
Polo 1978, 1st team All-Southern Conference 1978 (water polo), 4
time Virginia State Tournament team, water polo captain twice,
MVP twice and swimming MVP for 1979. The swimming and water
polo teams will sorely miss his presence next season.

Promising performances were turned in by Bob Newcomb in the
50 free, Freshmen Mike Bernot and Herb Gresens in the freestyle
relay and diver Jay Diesing.

The head coaching job being vacated by Coach Stearns has at-
tracted some highly regarded applicants. Most notably is Page
Rohmillard, of Claremont-Mudd College in California, who has ex-
pertise in both swimming and water polo. Other applicants are the
head coach of Fordham University of New York City, an assistant
from University of Alabama and the head coach of Madison
University. An excellent water polo coach has also applied from
Occidental College in California.

by Chris Sisto

Despite the varsity baseball’s
3-6 record and their 1-3 showing
of last week head coach Chuck
Kroll is very optimistic about
the future success of the team.
“T’m enthusiastic about this
team. We’re a hustling ball club
and we are improving every
day. We are going to do fine
over the rest of the season.”’

The Generals started last
week with a 5-0 loss to
Bridgewater College, partly
caused by an absent hitting at-
tack. The silent bats continued
for the team as they then lost a
3-0 game to Liberty Baptist Col-
lege. Vic Shepherd pitched well
for the Generals, allowing only
one earned run.

Then Sunday on Smith field,
the Generals split a conference
doubleheader with Hampden-
Sydney, winning the first game
4-2 and dropping the second, 9-5.

Baseball Generals
Still “In the Season”

Prior to the first game the
Generals had never beaten
Sydney. But the tempo was set
early in the first game as the
Generals came up with three
runs in the first inning. Rich
Hachenburg pitched masterful-
ly, allowing only four hits in the
game. Coach Kroll later said
that, “Rich was in complete
control of the game at all time.”’
In the second game the
Generals could not overcome a
barrage of late-inning runs by
Sydney that wiped out a fourth
inning two run lead. Jeff Hag-
gerty was 3-3 at the plate and
had three RBI’s.

Overall, Coach Kroll said,
“My guys have a lot of
pride...we’re a long way from
being out of this season. We
have two very important weeks
ahead of us and I think we’ll do
fine.” In ODAC play the
Generals are now 2-4.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK ST Ix VILLE = eases cy)

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Perspectives-

The recent faculty proposal to curb fraternity “hazing,” week-
day parties, and public drunkenness hit the student body like a
bombshell on Monday. As recently as last week, a substantial
number of W&L students (while responding to the Ring-tum Phi
poll) stated that they saw no danger threatening their fraternity
system. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The pot has boiled over
toa crisis level; criticism of fraternities is at an all-time high in the
community, among the faculty, even at the nearby women’s col-
leges. Still, it may not be too late for the fraternities to recover lost
ground if rapid steps are taken.

Since Professor Pinney’s motion hit the campus, the common
fraternity sentiment has been one of betrayal. ““How can our
teachers oppose their own students?” we have heard. ‘‘Some of my
favorite professors support this proposal.” Perhaps students
should remember that the faculty are full-time members of the
Lexington community as well. Not only have they borne the
frustration of sparsely-attended Thursday classes, but also they
receive constant exposure to public cursing and destruction of pro-
perty. Like the rest of the community, the W&L faculty feel that the
students simply don’t care about their responsibilities to the town.
In turn, the students may have misinterpreted faculty patience as
an equal lack of care. But no longer — as one faculty member said,
“I can’t even take my family toa lacrosse game...We are not going
to let them do that to us, and we have the power to stop it.”

Many faculty members are fraternity men, and continue to sup-
port a well-ordered system on the campus. They don’t view this
proposal as an attempt to shut down fraternities but as a last-ditch
effort to make students realize the ‘‘substantial” sentiment against
them. Even prospective students are being frightened away by this
uproar — as one official stated, ‘“They don’t want 4 years of what
they saw in Animal House.”’ That movie was made as a caracature
of fraternity life, but when it becomes the example— and leads to
the eclipse of W&L’s academic reputation — corrective measures
are bound to be harsh.

Right now, it’s hard for the faculty to find much good at all in
fraternities. But there are still arguments for the system ', which
professors should remember as they hammer out a final solution.
Almost everyone has admitted that there are various degrees of
guilt among the houses, and that it does seem unfair to make all
suffer equally. Also, the recent alumni inspections brought
favorable (if surprised) compliments on the physical inprovements
of the houses. The fraternities— to give them their due — often try
really hard to co-operate with the community. Only when the city
council refused any bending of the noise ordinance, did a resigned
return to the ‘‘old rowdiness’’ occur. Most of all, faculty members
should be aware that fraternities — for good or ill — are still power-
ful drawing cards for incoming freshmen, even now. If all
autonomy is whipped out of the system, it is hard to see any recrea-
tional medium in our thriving metropolis which could take its
place.

Hopefully, some of these thoughts will be remembered as the
sides square off for this latest encounter. No one can doubt the
reality of the present threat — but we can hope that tempers will
cool and reason prevail before a final decision is reached.

“Lacrosse fever ”’

Dear Editor:

As the heart of the lacrosse season is upon
us, we think it would be worthwhile for all of
us to take note of a few facts. For whatever
reason, “lacrosse fever’? seems to be on a
slight decline this year. To be sure, the team
had two very tough losses to Syracuse and
UNC, but the team is deserving of more from
us as fans. Instead of cheering for our own
team it seems that many of us sit in stunned
silence when we’re not ahead by 10 goals, and
wait for each opportunity to ‘dump on’’ the
other team and its coaches. There are no pat-
sies on the W&L schedule; the team needs our
support and we ought to’ give it to them in-
stead of wasting time giving the other side
grief.

More important is the effect our manner of
cheering has on other teams. Like it or not the
Naval Academy will not schedule us in
lacrosse because of the obscene verbal abuse
given their coach and his wife while last in

victims - watch those cheers!

Lexington. The word is spreading and we
could be in real danger of losing future games
against top competition if we can’t ‘‘clean up
our act.’”’ There isn’t a thing W&L can do
when a biggie says ‘‘Sorry, we’re not coming
to Lexington,’’ except look around for a lesser
opponent. Needless to say, nobody wants to
see a schedule full of Kutztowns and Bowling
Greens, so let’s make sure we don’t cause that
problem to arise.

The Wahoos come to town on April 22 for the
annual battle, and what a shame it would be
to lose the opportunity to thrash them in the
future. We don’t have to love the ‘‘Hoos,”’ but
we ought to be able to act decently while
beating the hell out of them. The message
comes down to this: From here on out let’s
keep the cheering loud and keep it clean.
Otherwise, we will be the losers regardless of
the score.

Thanks,

R.E. Lee elderly residents defended

Mr. Gray Coleman, Editor
The Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University

I would like to express my extreme disap-
pointment with the insensitive and morally
repugnant manner in which Clyde Mull, pro-
prietor of the College Inn and new owner of
the R. E. Lee Hotel, has treated several long-
time tenants. As known by readers of
theRing-tum Phi and many Lexington
citizens, the R. E. Lee has been the home of
several elderly people, most of whom are on
fixed incomes. Because of a substantial in-
crease in their rents next year, these people,
most of whom have no relatives in the area,
are being forced into the frightful position of
needing to find a new place to stay. The lack
of suitable low cost housing in Lexington is
common knowledge among students, so most
of us can get a slight feeling for what it must
be like to be elderly and suddenly be left
without a roof over one’s head.

Mr. Mull has made clear that he is just:a
businessman out to make a profit. Even
though claiming to incerase the Hotel rents to

Georges

Hairstylist

a competitive level, he seems to be raising
them well above what the rather unim-
pressive facilities are worth. One begins to
wonder whether or not the loss of these
tenants is such a business enhancing move
after all.

Since I lived in the Hotel my freshman year,
I am well aware of all the non-financial
benefits that other tenants of the hotel receive
from their presence. Certainly, returning
from a hard day of classes to be greeted with
warm affection gave all of us a good feeling
inside. Having someone there all of the time
also made us feel a great deal more secure
knowning that our rooms were safe in our
absence. These people made us feel at home.

Now these loyal friends of W&L and Lex-
ington are being forsaken at the whim of a
capricious businessman. However, I have to
wonder if profits are going to grow at as rapid
a rate as indignation resulting from their
plight. For one, I have to believe that these
elderly people will not be the only losers in the

deal.

To the Editor,

I'd like to tell all you people
who participated or observed
the dance marathon that I
thoroughly supported the cause
and was impressed by the en-
thusiasm and spirit that the
group maintained. I am new to
this area having lived in the
county for about a year. I
wanted to enter the marathon at

the start but circumstances |

prevented me from doing so.
The next best thing was to come
when I could. I danced the last
five hours of the marathon and I
felt pretty weak in the knees, so
I congratulate all those who

persisted, sweated, and held out —

to the very end.

. But one thing upset me ter-
ribly. The Wet Tee Shirt Con-

test. I’d heard about such low,

oppressive entertainment but

had never witnessed it. Part of

me was unbelieving that it was

to actually happen; I believed
W & L consciousness and men-
tality was higher than most
smoke filled bars, so I got close
to observe. What I saw affected

ay.
me so that tears began to cloud
my eyes. I felt very offended,
repulsed and angered. Four
women, one at a time, pranced

about flaunting their bodies in

against each other to see which

Stearns Criticizes Resignation Account

To the Editor:

I have some questions regar-
ding Bill Whalen’s March 29th
article about my resignation
from Washington and Lee.

First, since this season was
(to quote Mr. Whalen) ‘“‘...the
first time in five years that a
W&L swim team has failed to
crack the top ten for Division III
teams,” does it necessarily
follow that the season was a
‘stormy’? one? Mr. Whalen’s
use of the word implies conflict
and controversy which the
mere fact of a team’s not plac-
ing in the top ten does not
substantiate. Besides where is
any mention of this season’s two
team members who achieved
All-American status at the Divi-
sion III championships?

Furthermore, why doesn’t the
Ring-tum Phi make it known
that our Division III swim team
competed almost entirely
against subsidized Division I
colleges this season? The swim
team through the years has con-
sistently challenged a tough
Division I schedule. Despite
this, where does the Ring-tum
Phi note that the swim team has
the highest winning percentage
of any team in W&L history or
of its 15 All-Americans. Why
does the Ring-tum Phi em-
phasize this one “‘disappoin-
ting’? season instead of

crediting our swim team with
its fine competitive efforts and
publicizing the successes which
were made?

It does seem odd that a stu-
dent newspaper would detract
from the accomplishments of
its fellow-student athletes by
focusing so heavily on the
losses. Could it be that the Ring-
tum Phi is not really interested
in accomplishments, but is
more intent upon trying to imp-
ly the possibility of some
disreputable connection _ bet-
ween this season’s ‘‘disappoin-
ting performance’ and my so-
called ‘‘sudden resignation’’? I
suppose, when one thinks about
it, this would be more titillating
copy for readers.

Second, is it really true (to
quote Mr. Whalen again) that
the ‘...Coach himself drew
criticism from _ local
newspapers for his controver-
sial housing practices...?’’ or is
it more specifically true that
the single W&L_ student
newspaper, The Ring-tum
Phi,chose to direct its attention
in a single article to my housing
practices? And is it not true that
other newspaper involvement
amounted to one “‘letter to the
editor,” a letter written in
response to the Ring-tum Phi
article?

Third, does my conversation
with athletic director William
McHenry three months ago
(last December) about the
possibility of my leaving W&L
constitute a ‘‘sudden’’ resigna-
tion? Perhaps, if Mr. Whalen
had actually interviewed Mr.
McHenry instead ot merely bor-
rowing a quotation from a news
release (without proper
reference to the source), Mr.
Whalan would have discovered
that Mr. McHenry and I
originally discussed a formal
resignation decision to be of-
fered in mid-April this year.
Perhaps if Mr. Whalen had ac-
tually asked the appropriate
questions of the people involv-
ed, he would have learned too,
that my formal announcement
came a month early (in March)
because at that t point I was ina

44622446 seaeeteeaeet

position to arrange an interview
between W&L and an excellent
candidate as my successor.

Is it possible that the Ring-
tum Phi really does not know
much about the circumstances
of my resignation?

Finally, the Ring-tum Phi
clearly raises the question of a
possible connection between the
swim team’s “‘disappointing
performance”’ this season, my
“sudden resignation,” and my
“‘interest”’ in coaching the team
this year. But if the Ringtum
Phi really does think this is an
important issue, I wonder why
Mr. Whalen has not included
statements to that effect from
the two men who evaluate my
professional performance —
athletic director William
McHenry and President Robert
E.R. Huntley? Has Mr. Whalen
asked Mr. McHenry and Presi-
dent Huntley or my swimmers
whether or not they think I have
fulfilled my commitment to the
swim team?

Or is it more likely that Mr.
Whalen’s article about my
resignation represents an ex-
ample of incompelte knowledge
turned into journalistic innuen-
does designed for public pro-
vacation rather than enlighten-
ment? I do not think Mr.
Whalen has investigated the
issue of my resignation very
well, and consequently, I’m
sure the Ring-tum Phi does not
object to my questioning its

_journalistic integrity on the

professional integrity.

ploited.

I really object to this type of
“good fun,’’ especially in the
name of a Muscular Dystrophy
Fund-Raiser Dance Marathon.
The contest was in very poor
taste and in support of destruc-
tive social conditioning of this
sexist society. For myself I felt
these women obviously needed
to get eyeball attention and
recognition, and inacturately
represented and reflected the
emale sex.

By writing this article I hope
to reach some of you out there
who encouraged, promoted, or
participated in the WET TEE
SHIRT CONTEST. I can only
trust that there are many more
men and women who felt the
same as I did and that next year
it will be left out of this other-
wise excellent fund-raising
event.

Sincerely,

Students Defend Fraternities
in Wake of

Faculty Proposal

Dear Editor:

The initial outrage which ac-
companied my reading of the
faculty proposal to restrict the
social life (i.e. no weeknight
parties and limited weekend
parties) of fraternity members
has subsidied into a controlled
rage. Once again, the role of
fraternities at Washington and
Lee is being called into ques-
tion. Asked to limit weeknight
partying to one night per week,
fraternities complied. Asked to
turn down the music at parties
by a certain hour fraternities,
albeit somewhat - hesitantly,
complied. I dare say that the
Alumni Committee which
recently scrutinized the
physical condition of all frater-
nity houses on campus was, I
am told, favorably impressed.
Such a result could only come
about through a united fraterni-
ty commitment of time, effort
and money. To imply that the
conditions of fraternity: life here
are idyllic would be a'mistake.
On the other hand, to suggest
that the fabric of the fraternity
system has deteriorated to a
point where radical measures
such as those proposed by the
faculty must be adopted is in
my opinion, a far greater
mistake.

At an institution like W&L the
opportunity to mature from an
inexperienced freshman into a

_ bring to bear,

college graduate capable of
coping with the pressures which
the unbounded freedoms found
outside these walls inevitably
is readily
available. An intricate part of
achieving this maturity is lear-
ning how to balance the intellec-
tual and social aspects of life
here. What the motion before
the Faculty proposes to do is
eliminate the student’s chance

- to achieve that balance by

himself. In the place of the stu-
dent’s attempt at self-discipline
will come faculty restrictions
which will retard this growth
process by limiting, to a large
extent, the student’s freedom of
choice.

What would seperate us, if
such measures were ever to be
implemented, from’ our
neighbors at VMI who labor
under a barrage of rules and
regulations? The major dif-
ference is, obviously, that VMI
cadets choose this regimented
lifestyle. A student coming to
W&L chooses the school mainly
for its academic excellence
and, secondly, for its adequate
social life. W&L presently of-
fers the student a large degree
of freedom in choosing not only
his academic pursuits, but his
individual lifestyle as well. If
such strict measures are passed
and enforced, ultimately
resulting in almost a complete
lack of this social freedom, we
are certain that many students
will “‘choose’’ not to come here
and some may choose not to re-
main. We ask only ask that the
faculty look closely before leap-
ing.

barbecues as well, Darrell said.

And the university has ar-
ranged to ‘“borrow’’ the use of
kitchen facilities at Virginia
Military Institute if the need
arises, he said.

The final day of the W&L
school year is June 7, so the
change in food-service patterns
will last only- three weeks or
slightly longer, Darrell said.

The new addition will consist
of a 66-x-32-foot building. A
walkway will remain between it
and the dormitory just to the
west. The front of the new wing
will be located behind the ex-
isting breezeway which leads
from the dormitory to the din-
ing hall.

Rental List
Being
Prepared

The Office of University ser-
vices at Washington and Lee is
preparing a master list of rental
properties available to students
for the 1979-80 academic year.

The list will be made
available to undergraduates
and law students who will then
make arrangements directly
with the landlords.

The university has invited all
prospective landlords to pro-
vide information for inclusion
on the student housing list.
There is no charge for the ser-
vice. The university has asked
that landlords provide a com-
plete description of the rental
property, a description of fur-
nishings which may be included
in the terms of the rental agree-
ment, special advantages the
property may offer, restrictions
which the landlord imposes,
and full information about
costs, including length of lease
and whether the landlord or the
student pays for utilities.

The information should be
sent to W&L’s Office of Univer-
sity Services in writing.

The university emphasized
that it is able to act only as a
clearing-house for information
and cannot become involved in
negotiating leases or rental
agreements, nor in enforcing
the terms of contracts or handl-
ing disputes between landlords
and students.
