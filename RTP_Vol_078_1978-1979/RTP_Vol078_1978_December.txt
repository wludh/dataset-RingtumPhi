EC Votes in Favor
of Grade Review

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously Monday
night to recommend to
Washington and Lee’s faculty
that students have the right to
question and appeal the final
grade received in a course.

The statement adopted by the
EC would give students ‘‘the
right to review and discuss all
graded material and any factor
entering into the final grade.”
Students with a_ grievance
would then be able to get a
review of the grade with the
head of the department involv-
ed.

Presently, W&L has no pro-
cess through which a student
can appeal a final grade if he
disagrees with the professor’s
evaluation of his work. Also, the
department head cannot now
overturn any grade given by a
professor in his department.

The EC’s statement—perhaps
the most significant action
taken by the Committee this
year—also recommends that
professors provide a course
syllabus at the beginning of the
term which outlines a schedule
of assignments and an ‘‘approx-
imate percentage analysis of

the final grade.”’
The statement adopted dur-
ing Monday’s regularly

scheduled meeting was based
on the recommendations of an
EC subcommittee headed by

about the chances that the

determining grades to the head
of the department.

‘We shouldn’t be hesitant at.

right to review,’’ Willis urged. |

Despite the feelings of some
EC members that the faculty
would never agree to such a
proposal, all Committee
members present agreed with
the principle of the statement
and voted to recommend the
grade review plan to the facul-
ty.

Dudley addresses freshmen in Chapel on independent exams.

by John Billmyre

In explaining the procedures
and benefits of Independent Ex-
ams, Student Body President
Beau Dudley called the exams
“one of the most important
parts of the honor system
here.”’

His comment came during a
general procedure meeting with
freshmen concerning Indepen-

dent Exams Tuesday evening in
a crowded Lee Chapel. Atten-
dance was mandatory for all
freshmen.

Dudley said that while he con-
siders Independent Exams a
strain on the honor system and
a responsibility, he feels this is
a good chance for students to
show what Independent Exams
mean to them.

The best policy for avoiding

Honor Violations is simply not
to talk about them, he said.

Students were reminded to
pick up exam envelopes at the

_registrar’s office and turn them

into professors during the first
class meeting next week. Pro-
fessors will designate on the
folder where exams are to be
taken.

Any exam turned in late or

Buckley to speak
Wednesday

Former Senator James L.
Buckley will speak at
Washington and Lee University
at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 6,
in Lee Chapel.

Buckley was elected to the
U.S. Senate in 1970 as a can-
didate of New York’s Conser-
vative Party, even though he
was registered Republican: He
was defeated for re-election in
1975 by Daniel P. Moynihan (D-
NY).

Perhaps one of Buckley’s best
known achievements as Senator
was The Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
often referred to as_ the
“Buckley Amendment.”’

The Buckley Amendment
allows a student to examine his
permanent record maintained
by educational institutions to
assure the accuracy of its con-
tents.

Buckley’s principal commit-
tee assignments during his six
years in the Senate were Public
Works, Interior, Commerce and
Budget.

His major legislative in-
terests were: the right against
permissive abortion; protection
of the rights of. parents and the

family from governmental in-'

terference; and the protection
of state and local governments
from interference by federal
agencies.

Buckley was also a leading
advocate for a strong defense
and was an early critic of the
politicy of detente.

During his second year in of-
fice, Buckley was named
among the hardest-working and
brightest members of the
Senate in a survey of legislative
staff assistants. In 1976, he was
listed as one of the ten best
Senators by syndicated colum-
nist Jack Anderson.

Presently, Buckley is serving
as director of the investment
banking firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin, and Jenrette.

He is also the vice chairman
of the Republican National
Committee’s Advisory Council
on General Government and is
Chairman of the Subcommittee
on the Rediscovery of
Federalism:

Sen. Buckley is the younger
brother of the well-known
writer and syndicated colum-
nist William F.. Buckley.

The lecture is being jointly
funded by the Mock Convention
and Contact Committees.

Dean Robert Huntley (left) posses with new members of Phi Eta Sigma after their induction Tuesday.

“It’s sort of sad that the sor-
riest combo or dreariest dance
excites more attention or en-
thusiasm from us than the in-
itiation of these young men
whose performance’ and
achievement is emblematic of
the very raison d’etre for the ex-
istence of this University,”
commented Dean Robert
Huntley, coordinator of the
freshman year.

Huntley said that the Phi Eta
Sigma ceremony “goes largely
unnoticed by the University
community as a whole.”

“Such characteristic reserve
toward any organization bear-
ing Greek letters becomes more
explicable when one recalls that
Phi Eta Sigma is not a fraterni-
ty, but a society—a society
dedicated to the ideals of
scholarship and high personal
achievement,”’ Huntley  con-
tinued.

Dean Huntley said that those
students inducted into the socie-
ty Tuesday had achieved ‘‘that
level of intellectual, or at least
academic excellence toward
which we all—faculty, ad-
ministration, and _ student

body—traditionally genuflect
but otherwise ignore.”

The Housing Game—W&L Style

The Great Race Is On

by Chris Chatfield

From this part of the year on,
Washington and Lee students
begin a wild search for a room
or an apartment for next year.
And for the student inexperienc-
ed in the housing game, there
may not seem to be enough
places to live in Lexington.

Many questions are raised:
about University housing, living
in town, and living in the coun-
try. .

William N. Mohler, Director
of University Services, is in
charge of University housing
and can also supply students
with a list of local houses and
apartments for rent.

‘The University has a fairly
large housing system for its
students,”’ Mohler said.

The University has housing
for approximately 275  up-
perclass men and law students
in dormitories and the Woods
Creek Apartments.

Baker Dormitory can house
37 law students, while the
number of law students in the

Woods Creek Apartments
varies from year to year. This
year about 50 law students live
in Woods Creek.

Mohler said that about 130 up-
perclassmen live at Woods
Creek, while another 30 live in
the two Lee Houses. Davis
Dorm can house up to 45 up-
perclassmen, but due to the
large size of this year’s
freshman class, only 26 places
were available to the up-
perclassmen, Mohler said.

To sign up for University
housing, students should turn in
room assignment forms before
Feb. 1. These forms can be ob-
tained in Mohler’s office.

Mohler said, ‘“The University
is not responsible for finding
off-campus housing for the
students. However, we do have
a list of houses and apartments
for rent that the owners have
told us about. The University
acts solely as a clearing house
for this information and can not
offer endorsements for them.”

According to Mohler, Mead
Associates; at 21 N. Main St., is
the largest rental agency in

Lexington. Mead rents the
Country Club apartments (just
outside of town), the Nelson
Street Apartments (in town), as
well as several houses. _

“We try to do everything we
can to find students places to
live,’’ said G. Otis Mead. “‘Itis a
very difficult situation.”

Students should apply at
‘Mead Assoc. directly after
Christmas, with Alice Strecker.
Students are served on a first
come, first served basis. There
is no charge for these services.

John M. Ewing has about 32
apartments (from one to five
bedrooms) to lease. These are
his own apartments and are of
various prices and _ locations.
Ewing can be reached at his
‘home phone number: 463-3272.

Patricia K. Connor Realty, on
Washington Street, as part of
their ‘‘good will’ policy, keeps
a running file on people they
know of who are renting proper-
ty and will give these names to
students. These services are
also free.

You can always try Mr. Duck
at Central Lunch on Main
Street. He often has information
on people renting houses and he
loves to help University
students. And across Main St.,
Clyde Mull of College Inn has
many one-room efficiency
apartments on his upper floors.

So, the great ‘apartment
race” is on! Keep your eyes and
ears open, and make your move
soon.

Many people in Lexington
rent rooms to students but do
not advertise, relying instead
on word of mouth publicity. If
you hear of someone who might
have a place to rent, go see
them. At worst, they will be
happy to put your name on their
waiting list.

duPont shows
Liao prints

by Don Noble

The current exhibition in du-
Pont Gallery, a show of prints
and paintings by Liao Shiou-
ping, will be on view until Dec.
15.

Mr. Liao was born in Taipei,
Taiwan in 1936 and has studied
art at the National Taiwan Nor-
mal University, Tokyo Univer-
sity on Education, Ecole Natio-
nle Superieure des Beaux-arts
(Paris) and other schools. He is
presently a Professor of Art at
the University of Tsukuba,
Tokyo.

Mr. Liao has shown his work
in numerous One Man and
Group Exhibitions throughout
the world and has won many
prizes and awards. He has also
published two books — The Art
of Printmaking and Apprecia-
tion of Modern Prints.

Mr. Liao’s education in art
was originally western in style,
with much emphasis on
realism. However, during his
studies in Paris, he decided to
incorporate his Oriental
heritage into his style. As a
result, his work now is a com-
bination of traditional Chinese
images and contemporary
Western form and technique.

In order to incorporate a
Chinese character into his
work, Mr. Liao had to abandon
his western background in art
and concentrate on the Oriental
view of nature, time, and life.
This outlook is different from
the western conception and in-
volves a different philosophy of
art.

This can be seen most clearly
in the gate images that Mr. Liao
uses, which are very represen-
tative of his style. They draw
from traditional Chinese
themes and are meant to imply
the meaning of life. As man
goes. through life, he travels
through and opens many gates
in order to understand the world

in which he lives. The gates are
symbols of man’s spiritual
journey through life and link the
past, present, and future with
regard to time. Through the
gate, the mystery of life is
revealed, and this is the
message that Liao wishes to
convey.

Liao’s other symbols are
usually simple forms set in ver-
tical and horizontal frames
which imply stability and per-
manence. These draw from the
Oriental outlook on life as an at-
tempt to build in an irrational
world a constant world of idea
— the search for the eternal
truth.

His works also emphasize his
belief that growth and develop-
ment is achieved through the in-
teraction of opposite poles, such
as sun and moon, heaven and
earth, or Yin and Yang. His
most recent expression has
been the adding of natural illu-
sions to the symbolic forms to
suggest the Eastern idea of
matter and spirit merging into
one.

Mr. Liao’s work uses an inter-
national language by express-
ing Oriental ideas through
Western media and technique.
It presents a very different
philosophy from that which we
are familiar with, and because
of its wumiqueness is very
refreshing.

 

East meets West in duPont Gallery. An oriental heritage and occidental training come together in the
unique points of Liao Shiou-ping which will hang in duPont Gallery through December 15.

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Rainer
Werner Fassbinder’s Gothic
thriller Chinese Roulette on
Thursday and Friday nights,

November 30 and December 1,
at 8 p.m. The movie was
scheduled for Thursday and

{Contest!

On Wednesday, January 10,
Washington and Lee will move
into its new library. Books will
be moved from McCormick
Library to The new library. Un-
paralleled academic complex
that it will be, the new library
does lack one thing.

The new library lacks a
name. In an effort to further in-
volve the student body in the
new library, the Ring-tum Phi
is sponsoring a ‘‘Name That
Library” contest. The rules are
simple.

Entries are to be submitted to
the Ring-tum Phi mailbox in
Carole Chappell’s office in the
Student Center. Each entry
should be accompanied by a
brief (25-50 word) statement ex-
plaining the proposed name.

Entries will be judged on the
basis of originality and aptness
and the three best entries will
each be awarded a six pack of
beer of their choice.

Go to it boys.

Cye And Car: Foon The Bookstore

The academic atmosphere swirls with worries.
Papers unwritten, barely thought upon; five hun-
dred pages of Victorian novels (worse yet,
Chaucer) unread; computer terminals
unavailable; and equations, mathematical or
personal, unbalanced. Then the student’s
camel’s back comes near to breaking by the
straws of Christmas’s joys and chores. :

What to give to whom? Where to buy the
perfect present for the perfect person? In such
dire circumstances I will gladly take on, in the
interest of future student sanity, the unlikely role
of Christmas angel.

Books, of course, are surely the varied
delightful solution for all Christmas-gift panic.
They do not disappear with large gulps; they do
not go out of style and they come in all sizes and
prices; lastly they are not made of plastic nor do
their bearings wear out. Books are gifts that
last!

So let’s get on with making an all purpose gift
list so that the chores become joys.

(1) For younger brothers and sisters, nieces
and nephews — Castle; How To Eat Fried
Worms; Macmillan Dictionary For Young Peo-
ple.

(2) For the grandmother who always
remembers your birthday with generosity:
American Album; Country Lady Calendar; Let-
ters Of E.B. White.

(3) For the father who wonders what the hell
you are doing with all that money up there —
show, him with: War And Remembrance; In
Search Of History; General Lee’s College.

(4) For the mother who doesn’t ask the wrong
questions and who laughs at the right time: Julia
Child And Company; Wildflower Gardening; Ar-
chitecture Of Historic Lexington.

(5) For the one-and-only girl of the moment:

Earth From Above; Doonesbury’s Greatest
Hits; The Prophet.
Betty Munger

From the Record Shop:

Aural gratification — what a nice gift idea.

Here are some selections from the Record Store
that might help you if you’re really in a pinch.
(1) For your sister who just returned from col-
lege a changed woman; depressed about her
future, despondent about her grades, and
nauseous over her love life: Sylvia Plath
Reading Her Poetry; Let It Bleed, The Rolling
Stones; Freakin’ At The Freaker’s Ball, Shel
Silverstine.

(2) For your little brother who put ground
glass on your morning grapefruit and thinks he’s
such a comedian: That’s Not Funny, That’s
Sick,” National Lampoon; The Mothers,
Fillmore East — June 1971, Zappa.

(3) For Uncle Charlie who can’t stop talking
about the wonderful good old days: The Wit and
Widsom of Will Rogers; Great American
Speeches, Vol. III, 1931-1947; Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., What I Oppose The War In Vietnam.

(4) For your old high school buddy who just got
back from N.Y.C. and thinks he’s so cool and
cosmopolitan: Southern Prison Blues, Recorded
at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola.

(5) For your other old buddy who just grew one
of those funny pointed beards after taking his
first course in Marxist theory in school: Bertolt
Brecht Before The Committee On Un- American
Activities; Great Actors Of The Past.

(6) For your mother who you love: Dylan
Thomas reading — A Children’s Christmas In
Wales.

(7) For your father who you love: Messiah,
G.F. Handel, Neville Marriner

This second offering of the
film series will be shown as
before in classroom ‘‘C’’ of
Lewis Hall, the Law School. All
members of the university and
town communities are invited
to attend. Admission is free.

Along with the directors
Werner Herzog and Wim
Wenders, Fassbinder has made
the newly resurgent West Ger-
man cinema the most active
and creative in Europe at the
present time. Chinese Roulette
(1976) explores the relationship
between a paralyzed teenaged
girl on the edge of puberty, her
philandering parents, and their
lovers. In the process, the
movie challenges’ the
stereotyped sentimentality with
which we treat the cripple in
our society and art.

The movie progresses from
the beautifully composed,
unsettling opening shots, in
which it is unclear where we are
spatially and what the relation-
ships is between the people we
are watching, through a series
of tautly paced scenes which
make brilliant use of delayed in-
formation. At the end of the
movie, the characters gather to
play ‘Chinese roulette,” ‘a
made-up parlor game ox terrify-
ing psychological sadism.

Unique thrills

Fassbinder’s film is a master-
piece of tension. For the man-
datory chase sequences of
many ‘“‘thrillers,’”’ this movie
substitutes unpredictably paced
human exchange. Because the
movie’s characters exist in a
familial relationship to each
other, the tension of the usual
‘thriller’? genre is im-
measurably intensified and
complicated. When the
suspense is infused with cruel-
ty, this ‘“‘thriller’’ becomes

Comes a western Weekly Calendar

by Dick Barron

This past week I got a chance
to see a film which, although not
currently in Lexington,
deserves a good look. It’ll be
around for Christmas, I’m sure.

Comes a Horseman should
dispel any rumors about the
death of the cowboy film. The
chivalry of the West rides again
in the classic tradition of the
Gene Autry shoot-em-ups. I sug-
gest Autry here, because like
his old serial, Comes A
Horseman is set in the twentieth
century with airplanes and
automobiles. But horses and
cattle and the open-range are
very much alive in Alan J.
Pakula’s latest film.

Pakula, who added driving
suspense to The Parallax View
and who brought crisp energy to
All the President’s Men, brings
his own special brand of direc-
tion to this film. Through a com-
bination of brilliant motion
shots and tricky editing, this

becomes one of the most visual-
ly exciting films of the recent
year.

The tranquility of the dinner
table, and the chaos of the cattle
drive are each emphasized and
strengthened chrough these
clever techniques. When the
script calls for suspense, the

editing is flawless, establishing

the perfect rhythm and pace.

In addition, the 1940s type
water-color tint is well conceiv-
ed as a means of setting the at-
mosphere and adding beauty to
scenic vistas.

Jane Fonda as a feisty ranch
girl, and James Caan, her

Sparring-partner turned helper, -

are impressive, playing every
scene with agility and wit.
Fonda, the cold, lonely
woman against the world, and
Caan, the ex-soldier who comes
back to the ranch, hate and
later come to love each other in
some of the best battle-of-the-

the more intelligent members
of the London social set, reveals
that even these beautiful people
have their actute psychological
problems. Interpreting these
characters will be several of
Sweet Briar’s best known ac-
tresses, who will be joined by
members of the English Club at
Washington and Lee. The
reading will be given in the
Wailes Center Lounge on
Wednesday, December 6, at 7
p.m., and all interested are cor-
dially invited to come and par-
ticipate in a question-answer
period led by Professor John N.
Swift of W&L.

The late T.S. Eliot, best
known for his controversial,
symbolic poems, ‘“‘The Waste
Land,” ‘‘The Hollow Men,”’ and
“The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock,”’ labeled his 1949 play
a “Comedy,” and it does glitter
with bright clashes of wit. But
beneath the sophisticated sur-
face runs deep currents of
spiritual distress and moral
confusion. Hosts Edward and
Lavinia are in a marital crisis
as they learn about affairs in
which they and their friends are

‘tangled. To this discomfort, an

unknown and uninvited guest
probes into their lives in the
belief that they must be ‘‘strip-

‘ ped naked to their souls.”’

Because of the poetic form

,and demanding characteriza-

tion, most of the roles have been

‘pre-cast, but the audience will,

participate in the discussion
that will involve both readers
and listeners, students and
faculty. The promises to be a
very special ‘“‘party’’ on
December 6.

: grinding

sexes scenes since Bogart met
Bacall.

But their battle with each
other is minute compared to
their fight with Jason Robards,
who plays one of the most evil
ranch owners ever to dlacken
the silver screen. He’s a guy
you just love to hate. Not only
does he do bad things, he ob-
viously enjoys doing bad things.
Everybody in the audience is
their teeth over
Robards.

The supporting cast is quite
good. Whether sitting around
the campfire and playing folk
songs with Caan, or helping
Robards to plot his dastardly
deeds, every actor executes his
role with skill.

The script has its flaws, and
for a while, we don’t really
know what’s going on, but once
the film rolls into the cattle-
drive scenes, there’s no turning
back — you’re hooked into your
seat.

Some will say this is a film
about women’s lib — N.O.W.’s
version of the old West — with
Fonda leading the way. Maybe
she’s not in dresses, a demure
little ranch girl, but she’s not
overbearing either, especially
when Caan comes along and
knocks the chip off her shoulder
to even up the score. We could
call this a film about partner-
ship — two people united in
standing up for their beliefs.

Comes A Horseman brings
back the days when movies
were exciting, and you knew
who to pull for in the big shoot-
out. The wide scope of the West
is given everything Alan J.
Pakula’s got, and that adds up
to one of the biggest and most
satisfying films in a long, long
time.

snnawena 1070.10 the Musical Mainstream aevnevey

The end of 1978 is almost upon
us, and this being the last issue
of the Ring-tum Phi for the fall,
we at Musical Mainstream
throught we’d tie up a few loose
ends. First, as is the annoying
habit of music writers
everywhere, our nominations
for the best albums of 1978 (in
no particular order ).

Peter Gabriel: Peter Gabriel
(second album) — brilliant
songwriting and first rate pro-
duction by Robert Fripp help
this LP equal and perhaps sur-
pass the standards set by
Gabriel in his first solo release.

Tom Robinson Band: Power
in the Darkness —no-frills rock
‘n roll returns with a bang.
Distinguished from other new
wave releases by the quality of
the songwriting and instrumen-
tal virtuosity.

 

i}
Tom Robinson

Sea Level: Cats on the Coast’’
— the jazz influences of this
band created a truly unique
sound which gave a new life to
southern rock. Who needs an
Allman Brothers reunion?

Who: Who Are You’’ — the
appeal of this album is definite-
ly there, but we can’t pin it
down. ‘‘Who Are You”’ seems to
fuse the songwriging style of
“Tommy” with the advanced
instrumentation of
“Quadrophenia.”

Rolling Stones: Some Girls —
not definitive Stones by any
means, but these are the Roll-
ing Stones and even mediocre
work by this band is superior to
the best of most other groups.

“blue wave’’ is upon us. As the
favorable review in ‘Rolling
Stone’’ would indicate, the ap-
peal of the Allstars transcends
local boundaries.

Bruce Springsteen: Darkness
on the Edge of Town — was it
worth the wait? Well, maybe
not, but it seems as though a lot
of people let their expectations
cloud their judgment. This may
not be ‘‘Born To Run”’ but it is a
great record nonetheless.

Lou Reed: Street Hassle — an
artistic re-awakening by one of
rock’s pioneering forces.

Boomtown Rats: Boomtown
Rats — ‘‘One of the most stunn-
ing left field debut albums since
Bruce Springsteen’ (Stereo
Review)

Dan Fogelberg/Tim
Weisberg: Twin Sons of Dif-
ferent Mothers — not par-
ticularly significant, but a very
pleasant experimental col-
laboration which showcases the
talents of both performers.

Random Notes

As a quick glance through the
above might indicate, 1978 was
not a particularly asupicious
year in the world of rock ’n roll.
Many of the high hopes built up
in 1977 were dashed this year.
The great promise displayed by
the Dave Edmunds-Nick Lowe-
Graham Parker axis was never
realized, and the surge of in-
terest in local and regional
bands here in the U.S. produced
nothing more interesting than
Devo. For the second con-
secutive yar, Jeff Beck released
no new material (though he is
rumored to be in the studio at
present). However, the lack of
new LPs from Pink Floyd and
Led Zeppelin was a definite
plus.

A number of artists released
particularly disappointing
albums in 1978, among them:
Styx; Emerson, Lake &
Palmer; Genesis; Boston; and
last but certainly not least, Bob
Dylan. The already dismal
Street Legal was not at all imr-
pvoed by the background vocals
of the Mormon Tabernackle
Choir.

And finally, on the local
scene, it’s time somebody
thanked Burr Datz for the im-

Students Robbed of Stereos
Over Thanksgiving Break

Over $3,800 worth of stereo
and photographic equipment
was reported stolen from Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity over
the Thanksgiving break.

According to - Lexington
Police Chief James A. Kirby,
the burglars apparently entered
the fraternity from a fire
escape ladder on the side of the
house, breaking a window to get
in.

Kirby said that University

Proctor Charles F. ‘Murph”
Murray discovered the break-in
the next day, Friday, Nov. 24,
and reported it to the police.

C. Douglas Davis reported
$1,300 in stereo’ yuipment and a
$300 loss of a Minolta camera
and 55 mm lens.

Geoffrey Sisk lost $940 worth
of stereo components and a
Nikormat camera valued at
$250.

Greek Novelist
to Lecture

Vassilis Vassilikos, noted
Greek novelist and journalist,
will deliver a lecture and
reading at Washington and Lee
University in Payne Hall next
Wednesday, Dec. 6, at4p.m.

This will be the first visit to
Washington and Lee for the
Greek author, whose last tour of
the United States was in 1959
under the auspices of a Ford
Foundation grant.

A movie based upon
Vassilikos’ most popular novel,
“Z,’’ will be shown Tuesday,
Dec. 5, at 7:30 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium.

Vassilikos was born in
Kavala, Grecce, in 1933, and
has published both poetry and
fiction which has_ been
translated into 16 languages.
Books of his to appear in the
United States include ‘The
Plant, the Well, the Angel,”

“The Photographs,” and ‘‘The
Harpoon Gun,”’ as well as ‘‘Z.””

A study of Greek society in
the decade preceding the col-
onels’ coup, ‘‘Outside the
Walls,” was published in the
United States and is the first
work of real-life commentary
by Vassilikos to appear in the
United States, according to
James Boatwright, professor of
English at Washington and Lee
and coordinator of the visit.

A reception will take place in
the English seminar room
following the Wednesday after-
noon lecture and reading. The
public is invited to attend both
events.

Vassilikos’ visit — to

Washington and Lee is spon-
sored by the Glasgow Endow-

losing $1,000 in stereo equip-
ment.

All three students are
sophomores living in the frater-
nity house.

Take ‘‘extra precautions

“We may get lucky and
recover this,” said Chief Kirby
about the stereo and
photographic equpment stolen
from Phi Kap.

He said that in the last two
years, “most” of the stereo
equipment stolen from W&L
students during vacations has
been recovered in town by the
Lexington police.

But the Police Chief urged
students to take “extra precau-
tions”’ before leaving Christmas
vacation, suchas:

—lock stereos in a closet in
addition to locking the room;

—students living in residen-
tial areas should ‘‘form a buddy
system” with their neighbors
and tell neighbors when they
are leaving town so someone is
watching the house;

—leave lights on in the house
during the vacation period;

—write down the serial
numbers of stereo equipment so
that it can be identified;

—tell the police when you will
be out of town and they will
check your house three times a
week while you are gone.

“Crime is everywhere and
it’s getting worse,’’ Kirby warn-
ed.

Career Assistance Available

by David Greer

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity offers its students a large
number of services to help the
student both at school and after
graduation. Among them is the
Office of Career Development
and Placement.

The office adjoins the recep-
tionist’s in the Student Center,
and is directed by Assistant
Dean of Students Mike Cappeto.

True, the office has a rather
formidable title. For those just
out of high school, it may evoke
images of flunky guidance
counselors or shrill-voiced proc-
tors handing out SAT’s on
Saturday morning.

But Cappeto is no flunky nor
is he a shrill-voiced proctor. He
won’t tell you that you must be a
geologist when you’ve always
wanted to pilot the Goodyear
blimp.

What Cappeto does is help
students plan their futures by
helping them select a major,
establish a career goal, secure
employment or get into
graduate school.

Cappeto says that he has
many undergraduates come to
him not knowing why they are
in college, much less what they
want to major in. Others
haven’t narrowed their goals
and want to major. in
everything.

For those who have no plans,
Cappeto can help them find a
major that can lead to many
types of employment or
graduate school.

Cappeto also offers career in-
terest tests to students, free of
charge. Privately ad-
ministered, they would cost the
student about $50, Cappeto said.

Although the tests do not dic-
tate what a student will do, they
do help focus his interests, mak-
ing it easier to choose a major.

Cappeto says that his office
does not try to override or
weaken the position of faculty
advisors, but tries to supple-
ment it. He adds that W&L’s ad-
visor system is ‘‘better than
most.”

Most of the students using the
service are seniors who need
help in job placement or
graduate school admission.

The office is not an employ-
ment agency and cannot get
jobs for students, but can help a
student find the job he wants.

One way the office helps a stu-
dent find work is through its job
referral service. Cappeto can
refer students to companies in
the field that might hire them.

Cappeto also keeps track of
alumni who might be able to
help a student in his search.
Usually the alumni are recent

2.8.82 6232.93 3242

344444464

graduates who can advise the
student about the job market,
Cappeto said.

The office also advises
students on how to efficiently
apply for jobs and conduct job
surveys. The office publishes a
guide to writing “‘cover letters”’
and resumes to helping students
with their applications.

To help students choose
graduate schools, the office
keeps directories that sum-
marize different graduate
schools, The directories are ar-
ranged by field, so Cappeto
would supply a list of the
schools of interest to the student
and a brief description of each.
The student can then choose to
write to those in his preferred
size-range or location.

After a student has found a
few graduate schools he is in-
terested in, Cappeto advises
him to talk to professors who at-
tended the schools to find out
more about them.

Alumni still contact the
career office for help in finding
work if they are unemployed or
switching jobs.

Cappeto urges students to
come by to talk to him about
their career plans. His office is
right on the way to the Cockpit,
so stop by one day and see what
he can do for you.

The Executive Committee:

by Randy Smith

There has been very little controversy
this year.

This has come as a disappointment to
some who remember what must have
seemed like an almost weekly barrage of
various sorts of scandals in these pages
last year.

By comparison, this has been a
‘‘dead,”’ almost boring year.

A lack of controversy can mean one of
two things: either scandalous activity is
taking place clandestinely, or everything
is running smoothly and efficiently.

This year’s Executive Committee, at
the pinnacle of Washington and Lee’s stu-
dent government and responsible for the
broad scope of the many activities affec-
ting the student body, is, perhaps, the
most thorough-going and efficient EC in
recent memory.

They have given careful consideration
to each important matter that has been
presented to them, deliberating the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of each side
of the issue. They have also initiated their
own study of different ideas and pro-
posals.

Last spring the Committee members
set down in guidelines what they ex-
pected of all their subcommittees, and
they have held those subcommittees
responsible and accountable to those
guidelines.

There has been a great amount of con-
sistency between the general ideas pro-
pounded last spring, when the Committee
was feeling its way, and the action taken
this fall, when the Committee was in
charge.

Yet, the EC has not been rigid in it
demands, allowing a certain degree of
flexibility.

 

eae RS,
sn Socdoaaial i NAAR

BEAU DUDLEY

The most significant factor in the way
the EC has conducted its business is the
serious attitude of its members. They all
take their job in student government as a
responsibility with which they have been
entrusted.

The pattern was set last spring when
. the newly elected Committee carefully
and methodically selected the persons to
fill the top positions on its subcommittees
— the persons the Committee would have

 

to work with all of this year.

Because of good leadership and strict
accounting standards, subcommittee
chairmen have not overstepped their
bounds and questionable practices have
not been in evidence.

 

 

 

There is no doubt that this year’s EC
has more control over the actions of its
subcommittees that past Committees,
largely due to its demand for monthly
reports and exact financial statements.

As a whole, the EC is conservative —
that is, it is composed of members who
are fiscally prudent and fundamentally
traditionalist.

Although all of its members are new to
student government except one, there is a
wealth of talent and experience on the
Committee, and, at least so far, the
representatives are hardworking and
concscientious.

 

eetccnonseneeee area an neue: ream,

TOM McCARTHY

 

oy : *

Early into the year, the Committee
reaffirmed last year’s ruling that all stu-
dent subcommittee meetings be open.

They went one step further than last
year’s EC and ruled that all meetings and
their agenda be posted ahead of time. But
the Committee stopped short, failing to
require that all committee votes be open,
thus allowing subcommittee chairmen to
close at least part of the democratic pro-
cess to the public.

The diligence of the EC was best ex-
emplified during the five-hour-long
budget meeting of Sept. 26, where $75,000
in student tax money was divided bet-
ween 10 subcommittees and campus
organizations.

The budget hearing produced surpris-
ingly little bloodshed and was generally
an orderly and reasonable process. When
the evening draw to a close, there was no
need to rejuggle the figures because the
totals balanced.

   

JOHN MURPHY

“T look very dimly on any group that
knows they will want money this year and
did not submit a budget to this committee
for consideration tonight,’’ said Beau
Dudley, EC president, on the night of the
budget hearings.

True to his words, the EC has only ap-
propriated $100 since that time, to the
recently formed Independents’ Union.

Carren Kaston’s Film Society was
denied money when it came before the
EC. The Society has approached the
Committee without first checking with
the Student Activities Board (SAB) or the
law school’s film group, both of which

show films on campus with EC funding.
The EC very politely (and correctly)
directed Ms. Kaston to the SAB, where
she found the funds to get her Film Socie-
ty started.

Other positive accomplishments of the
EC have been:

—the granting of some discretion to the
Cockpit managemen to book bands there,
and the decision to keep the Music Union
under the SAB’s financial control (and,
hence, within the EC’s jurisdiction),
thereby eliminating some of the tensions
and confusion that arose in last year’s
tug-of-war to control Cockpit entertain-
ment; this year everyone knows what his
responsibility is, and the result has been
a coordinated program of consistently
high-quality entertainment in W&L’s
tavern;

about the Independent Examination
system and its application to the honor
code (see related article p. 2);

—and the recommendation for some
sort of grade-review process (see EC
story).

ROB BENFIELD

The EC had a rough time, though, with
the freshman elections in October.
' The inexperience of the Committee led
to some confusion about the rules for can-
didates, and some representatives called
for a new election after nine of the 17 can-
didates had been stricken from the ballot
for a failure to turn in financial
statements.

The controversy led the Committee to
re-examine all election regulations to
make sure that the implications were
resolved for the future.

Of particular interest was the debate
over allowing write-in candidates in the
run-off election. The EC swung from one
position to the other in the course of two
weeks.

For the freshman run-off election of
Oct. 19, no write-in candidates were

allowed to enter the race.

But that restriction was reversed on
Oct. 30 by a close 6-5 vote. The decision to
allow write-in candidates in future run-
off elections was upheld by a 7-4 margin
the following week.

Undoubtedly, the subject of write-in
candidates in run-off elections will again
be debated in the early spring.

Important to the success of the EC these
first three month: has been the organiza-
tion and performance of the “‘Big Three”’
(the president, vice-president, and
secretary).

_ DEE KEESLER

EC President Beau Dudley has been
the driving force of the committee.

The articulate, charismatic third-year
law student has had a tremendous in-
fluence over his fellow committee
members and is not shy about expressing
his own viewpoints.

But Dudley is not pretentious with his
opinions and will respectfully give his at-
tention to his colleagues on the commit-
tee.

His leadership has been a definite asset
tothe EC.

Bill Tucker, vice-president of the EC,
has been most effective in dealing with
the SAB, of which he is a former chair-
man.

 

WILL MACKIE

 

CHARLIE SCOTT

Very little gets by Tucker that he does
not notice. Although this is his first year
on the EC, his intimate knowledge of
other student committees and organiza-
tions has been a valuable asset to the
Committee as a whole.

Tom McCarthy is probably the most ef-
ficient and organized EC secretary in the
student government’s history.

He is the one who does the groundwork
for the Committee and makes sure
everything runs smoothly.

His dedication to his responsibilities
may never be matched again, and the EC
probably should consider hiring him as
secretary for life after he graduates.

 

BOB WILLIS

John Murphy, third-year law school
representative, is another whose _in-
fluence has been felt by the Committee as
a whole.

Murphy has made worthwhile contribu-
tions while not overshadowing the
undergraduate members of the EC.

During the budget hearings, he and
Dudley were probably harder on the Stu-
dent Bar Association’s budget requests
than the undergraduates.

Murphy’s common sense has lended a
balanced perspective to the EC.

  

JENELLE MIMS

Rob Calvert, senior representative, is
probably the conservative on a fairly con-
servative body.

Calvert consistently fights for the
established proceedure or group and
usually ends up on Dudley’s side. His in-
fluence has been particularly felt on mat-
ters involving the SAB (as he was a
member of the subcommittee last year).

Calvert, for example, led the fight to
keep the Music Union under the SAB’s
financial control arguing that the SAB
had been ‘carefully chosen so that it
would represent a consensus of the enter-
tainment opinions” on campus.

Rob Benfield, senior representative,
has not led any discussions, although he
does not hesitate to contribute. By and
large, he has sided with the majority opi-
nion

Benfield was a strong proponent of the

THE RING-TUM PHI

W&L Football-what

the future holds

by Bill Whalen

On Nov. 11, the Washington and Lee Generals lost to the
Georgetown Hoyas 27-25. The loss may seen insignificant, consider-
ing the Generals’ final record of 2-8, but it shows the improvement
that occurred at W&L in 1978. :

The architect of this new-found respectability is Coach Gary
Fallon who has completed his first season with W&L. Fallon took
over one of the school’s most unsuccessful teams and, while he did
not improve on the 1977 mark of 3-8, he did lay the groundwork for a
promising future. ‘“‘We started a lot of new players in this pro-

gram,” said the coach. ‘‘I am very excited about the future of both |

the players and the program.”’

Fallon’s ‘‘program’’ began in the most inauspicious way,
however. The Generals lost their first two games by a combined
score of 83-14, including pastings of 49-7 and 34-7. Poor play con-
tinued as the Generals lost their next three in a row to run their
record to 0-5. Fallon dismissed these games as ‘“‘the first part of a
two part season.”’ In the second season, W&L was 2-3, including
losses of 18-17 and 27-25. More importantly, the Generals had evolv-
ed into a team with a winning attitude.

In looking at this year’s team and next year’s returnees, there
are some interesting contrasts. This year’s strength was in the
defense and next year’s team will have some key positions to fill.

Gone will be linebacker Car] Folcik, ODAC Player of the Year.
Also graduating are All-ODAC safety Don Crossley and cornerback
Jack Norberg, the mainstays of the defensive backfield.

W&L will also lose defensive ends Tom Baynham and Greg Lilly.
Therefore, the 1979 team will be strong up the middle, with all in-
terior linemen returning, and weak on the outside with new defen-
sive ends and two new defensive backs.

On offense, W&L will be loaded. The entire backfield returns, in-
cluding quarterback Rich Hachenburg, fullback Jim Palermo and
tailback Stewart Atkinson, who sets a record every time he carries
the ball. The only problem is that he may have no where to run. The
entire right side of the line graduates this year, including
center Bob Burkholder, guard Jim Guynn and AIll-ODAC tackle
George Berry.

Also missing will be All-ODAC split end Richard Wiles.

Hachenburg’s favorite receiver, Chris Leiser, will be back, as
will tight end/punter Syd Farrar. The kicking game will be at its
strongest in years.

Joining Farrar are place kicker Randy Austin, who set a school
record with a 44 yard field goal against Georgetown, and kick-off

man Rich Cerone. With the advantage of six games at Wilson Field
next year, 1979 could be a winning year for W&L.

In his first year at W&L, Gary Fallon experienced most
everything a coach can. He suffered through a six-game losing
streak, enjoyed a two-game winning streak, and saw two games
slip away at the last moment. ‘The one thing I have learned this
year is patience,”’ said the coach. ‘‘Next year, I will use the same
approach as I did this year. I am very proud of what my players did
this year and I look for more success next year. Right now, I want
* them to get away from football.’’ Thus, football ends for 1978.

Generals lose 87-78

against Hampden-Sydney

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
Generals lost their first game of
the season to Hampden-Sydney,
87-78 last night at Warner
Center. The Generals who now
stand at 2-1 overalland 0-1 in
ODAC play, must regroup
before facing Averett on Friday
night

W&L started strongly against

the Tigers by scoring the first.

      
   

Tom Jeffries goes up for shot against Hampden-Sydney last night

eight points in the game. The
Generals held a 22-12 lead with
8:40 left in the first half. At this
point the W&L defense was
never better, as the closest
shotsH-SC could attempt
werel5-20 feet out. H-SC then
outscored the Generals 22-12 to
even it up at 34 all. The once im-
permeable defense was riddled
with easy layups, including
three backdoor passe

to Ed

Owens. W&L Coach Verne Can-
field cited these baskets as “‘the
result of having no help-side
play.”’ In other words, Owens
was not being picked up under
the basket. The teams traded
baskets and H-SC led at
halftime, 42-40.

The Tigers scored the first
eight points of the second half
To take a 50-40 lead. The
Generals trailed 54-48 with 14:35
left but H-SC refused to fold.
Hampden-Sydney went on a 14-6
scoring tear to up their lead to
66-54, a margin that was to
much to overcome. A Pete Far-
rell tip-in reduced the lead to
72-64 with 4:40 left, but but H-SC
went into the “four corners’’
delay and iced the game away
with clutch free-throw shooting
and a little luck.

Suprisingly, Canfield was not

too upset overthe loss. “‘They

outplayed us and we deserved
to lose, ‘‘said the coach. ‘‘We
played good ball for the first
eight minutes, but we slacked
off,’’ continued Canfield. The
coach did make some suprising
moves, however. One was star-
ting Ardith Collins and Rob
Smitherman in the same lineup.
‘“‘Ardith always plays well
against H-SC,”’ said Canfield,
‘tandI felt that he was readyto
have a big game.’’Collins
responded well, scoring 16
points.

Collins was the only starter to
do well. The rest of the starting
five - Tom Jeffries, Carby Hoy,
Mike Wenke, and Smitherman -
shot a combined 13 for 41 from
the field. The player that kept
the Generals in the game was
sub guard Farrell, who poured
in 24 points, making 11 of 17
shots. Farrell’s buckets were
mostly from the outside, and as
seen last night basketball
games are usually not won from
the outside.

Grapplers host tourney on Sat.

by Chris Sisto

The wrestling season began
November 18 as the Generals
participated in a takedown tour-
nament at James Madison
University. Co-captain Ed
Rogers (158) and Ray Gross
(142) finished second and com-
piled 2-1 overall records. Other
top General finishers were Tom
Oxendine (177), Dan Kniffen
(190) and Andy Gottschalk
(134), who all came in fourth.
This type of tournament is only
involved in stand-up wrestling
and there is no team score kept
so there is no overall winner. It
only, as Coach Gary Franke
describes, gives the wrestlers
experience for the upcoming
regular season matches.

The season was supposed to
begin for the Generals on
November 29 but the opener
against Lynchburg has been
postponed until Jan. 15. The
reason for the postponement is
due to a skin disease that the
Lynchburg players have. The
disease, Herpes Simplex, is an

% «

inflammation of the skin. About
eight of the Generals also have
the condition but they should be
ready for the Fifth Annual W&L
Invitational Tournament. This

tournament includes six teams
and runs all day Saturday,
December 2. Admission is free.
The Generals also host VMI on
December 6.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

End of

the term:
winding down

It never fails...Whenever a term draws to a close,
campus activity screeches to a standstill, as everyone
tries to catch up on the schoolwork which has been put
aside for months. Those brown manila envelopes —
the registrar’s own special ‘‘Christmas gift’’ — will be
flooding the campus in a few days. After that, ‘exam
panic” will be in full swing.

But there has been one notable activity in the midst
of this inertia. We would like to thank the E.C. for con-
tinuing their practice of a freshman “‘independent ex-
am orientation.” Over the years, many freshmen
have accidentally violated the honor system through
lack of understanding. Hopefully, the E.C.’s action
will keep these problems at a minimum.

Planning for the library move on January 10-con-
tinues at a fast pace. If all goes well, the campus
should be flooded with grain cups, good music, televi-
sion cameras and more. Watch for a Ring-tum Phi
“‘extra,’’ with final details and instructions, on the
first day of classes next term.

PRALINE IAS AS IN AS A EP

Ariel, W&L’s literary magazine, will make its first
appearance of the year within the next week. The up-
coming issue will feature color photography, and a
wide assortment of student fiction and poetry. This is
the first time in recent memory that student support
of Ariel has resulted in publication of an issue before
Christman, an encouraging sign. Congratulations to
Ben Keesee and staff for their efforts...

With this issue, the Ring-tum Phi ends publication
for the fall term. On the basis of this fall’s issues, we
can point to a growth rate of 35-40% over last year —
and an increase in pages of over 100% since The
News-Gazette assumed printing responsibilities in
May, 1977. Hopefully this increased space has allowed
the newspaper to print more varied and detailed
stories than ever before. Even so, if we have enjoyed
any measure of success this year, it is primarily due
to the many individuals on campus who have offered
their time, suggestions, and support. On behalf of the
entire staff, I give you our sincere thanks.

Survive those exams — and an enjoyable holiday
season to all...

W&L, Dartmouth fraternities compared ©

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I want to correct several misconceptions about
the fraternity system at Dartmouth and
discourage too many comparisons between the
system as it exists here and the system in
Hanover. I wish the system there were our
model, for I feel it operates in a fashion which is
much more compatible with a liberal arts educa-
tion than it does here in Lexington. I graduated
from Dartmouth in 1961 and was an active frater-
nity member.

Several features distinguish the fraternity
system at Dartmouth from that of Washington
and Lee. 1. At Dartmouth, freshmen do not join a
fraternity until the beginning of the spring
quarter, i.e., mid-April of the freshman year.
The bulk of the freshman year is for acclimitaza-
tion, and for academics. Fraternity life takes the
proper back seat. 2. No fraternity at Dartmouth
is allowed to maintain a dining room. Students
eat in the College Dining Hall or in restaurants.
The fraternity is regarded as just one aspect in
the fabric of social life at Dartmouth. This rule
discourages fraternity members from total im-
mersion within a miniature society of ‘‘like-
thinking brothers’’ and forces them to maintain
contact with, and an allegiance to, the larger col-
lege community. 3. In 1960, every college frater-
nity officer at Dartmouth signed a pledge stating
that no written or unwritten clauses existed
within each fraternity’s charter preventing
membership of anyone on the basis of race,

creed, or color. No fraternity at Darmouth
tolerates the stupidty of the blackball whereby
one or two individuals can impose their bigotry
or ignorance on 60 other people. Fraternity
members have told me that such is not the case
here in Lexington. I find that hard to believe and
difficult to accept. 4. At Dartmouth, the most ac-
tive fraternity members are seniors. They live in
the fraternity and hold the major offices. This is
essentially a self-imposed regulation. I think it
produces more mature leadership within in-
dividual fraternities. 5. The fraternities in
Hanover are subject to the same rules and
regulations as the other members of the com-
munity. No special ‘‘dispensations” are either
given or asked for. The College makes no at-
tempt to provide buffers between the fraternity
system and the ‘‘town fathers.”

I hope these facts make it clear that the Dart-
mouth fraternity system operates in quite a dif-
ferent fashion that the fraternity system here.
Quite frankly I feel that the role of the frater-
nities at Dartmouth and the various philosophies
underlying the system there are much more in
harmony with the other institutions and aims
within an undergraduate, liberal arts educa-
tional institution. I think there there is a place for
fraternities here, but I think it is important to
constantly evaluate their role in what is first and
foremost an academic community.

E.C. exam rules

ToAll Upperclassmen :

The Executive Committee would like to take
this opportunity to remind you of your respon-
sibilities during the exam period. Independent
exams are a tremendous convenience to the en-
tire community, and the Student Body must offer
its cooperation to ensure their continuation.

Last year the faculty adopted a new politicy
concerning examination procedures. The rule

reads as follows:

‘“‘A student should not expect to have his ex-
amination graded if it is turned in late, turned in

without the examination questions, or if he takes
the examination in other than the assigned

room.”

This rule will clear up much of the past confu-
sion regarding the implementation of exams.

Sincerely,

The Executive Committee

Class officers
back library move

Dear Classmates:

The Wednesday upon our return to school for
Winter Term, classes will be cancelled for the
purpose of moving books out of McCormick
Library and into the new facility. This move can-
not be a success without total student involve-
ment. Therefore, we encourage and hope to see
the entire W&L student body actively par-
ticipating in the library move.

Sincerely,

Reading program to be offered

As a service to Washington
and Lee students, the Universi-
ty has once again this year
engaged Baldridge Reading
and Study Skills, Inc. to offer on
campus a special program
designed to improve reading
and learning skills in academic
subjects. ~

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sus*-’ con-
centration and te pen
analysis. A student use. nis own
classroom reading materials
rather than mass-prepared in-
structional literature and
mechanical training aids.

This program will be con-

ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 15 through February 9.
Scheduling will be flexible to ac-
commodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be
small to permit necessary in-
dividual attention. Each stu-
dent will attend a total of twenty
sessions, five per week. Tuition
for the program will be $60,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.
Interested students should
register for the course as soon
as possible.

are contemporary compositions
of the early- to mid-’70s.

Organized in 1957, the Ensem-
ble has since performed
throughout Europe, the middle
east and the United States. It
has appeared on numerous
television and radio programs
and has also made a number of
recordings. In 1975, Paul Price
was cited by the Percussion
Arts Society for outstanding
contribution to percussion
education and performance.

Price teaches percussion and
percussion literature and con-
ducts the percussion ensembles
at the Manhattan School of
Music.

Pianist Joshua Price is a
graduate of the Manhattan
School of Music. He has ap-
peared as soloist with or-
chestras in the United States

Dr. Turner
publishes

book of Civil
War letters

The Civil War letters of a pro-
minent Lexington resident and
Washington and Lee University
official, Col. J. K. Edmondson,
have been collected and edited
by Dr. Charles W. Turner in a
volume newly published by Mc-
Clure Press.

The book is entitled “‘My Dear
Emma’: War Letters of James
K. Edmondson, 1861-65,”’ and is
the sixth in a_= series of
Rockbridge histories Dr.
Turner has written or edited in
recent years. ‘‘Emma’’ was his
wife, the former Emily Taylor
of Staunton, whom he married
in 1856 and to whom he wrote
the letters Dr. Turner has col-
lected and edited.

Edmondson joined the
Rockbridge Rifles at the begin-
ning of the war, later the
Stonewall Brigade, and his let-
ters offer a vivid picture of
military supply problems,
camp life, and the typical of-
ficer’s anxieties, hopes and ex-
pectations from the ‘home
front.”

Born near Buena Vista, Ed-
mondson was a graduate of
Washington College and at the
time of the outbreak of the Civil
War was judge of Circuit Court
in Staunton. After the war, he
was elected mayor of Lexington
and judge of the court here.

In 1865, when the war ended,
he became treasurer of
Washington College and held
that position until 1868. Two
years later he became
secretary of the board of
trustees of Washington and Lee
University, as the college was
renamed in that year. He oc-
cupied that latter position for 28
years.

Judge Edmondson’ was
elected Rockbridge’s delegate
to the Virginia General
Assembly in 1893-94. He owned
two of Lexington’s most notable
homes, the Penick-Edmondson
House on White Street, which he
- built, and.Silverwood on South
Main Street, which he purchas-
ed.

The 139 letters which Dr.
Turner used in preparing the
volume are in the archives of
the Rockbridge Historical
Society in McCormick Library
on the W&L campus. The book
also contains’ several
photographs.

Dr. Turner, professor of
American history at W&L, join-
ed the university faculty in 1946,
the year he received his Ph.D.
degree from the University of
Minnesota.

The Executive Committee of the Student Body is concerned over
the existing situation regarding grading, specifically:

A) Students have no appelate process in which to protest their
grades;

B) A student's final evaluation might be based upon work which he
has never seen (e.g. final exams) :

C) Students are sometimes unaware of what weight will be given
each assignment or test in the computation of the final grade.

With these thoughts in mind, the Executive Committee recom-
mends that the Faculty adopt the following guidelines:

I) Students have the right to question any professor concerning a
grade he has received. Any student feeling that he has been unjust-
ly treated has the right to bring the matter to the attention of the
Department Head. The Department Head shall then review the
grade in question with the professor involved.

II) Students have the right to view and discuss all graded material
and any factor entering into the final grade within a reasonable
time after receipt of any grade. Professors shall keep final ex-
aminations for a period of one month into the semester following
examination.

III) At the beginning of the term, the professor should provide a
course syllabus which includes, among other things, a general
schedule of expected assignments and an approximate percentage
analysis of the final grade.

 

Cold Check Committee,
reported that $107.76 of the
$331.20 in debts outstanding to
students who have left the
University had been recovered
since his last report to the EC
one month ago.

Schoenfeld said that the $107
sum represented one person,
and that $223.44 is still outstan-
ding to persons who are no
longer students at W&L.

The Cold Check Committee is
holding $45.43 in bad checks of
current students.

The Student Activities Board
reported that its ski trip to
Snowshoe has attracted only

five students so far. Efforts are
being made to entice females
from the surrounding women’s
colleges to sign up.

position that write-in candidates should
be allowed in run-off elections ‘‘to give
the voters a fair choice.”

Steve Abraham, junior representative,
is the only returning veteran of last
year’s EC.
He has consistently been the strong ad-
vocate of open meetings, and is not shy
about pointing out the Committee’s faults
and weakenesses.
He is noted for his fairness and does not
hesitate to express the minority view.
Abraham was the member who thought
the freshman elections should be done
over, and he has consistently opposed
allowing write-in candidates in run-off
elections.

Dee Keesler, junior rep., has been a
quiet member of the EC and often sides
with the majority.

He was the representative who sug-
gested the freshman orientation about In-
dependent Exams this year.

Will Mackie, sophomore represen-
tative, sits on the right side of the table
with Calvert and Benfield.

He often sides with the majority and, in
ithat regard, upholds what has already

 

EC assessment

been established.

Mackie was instrumental in helping
defeat Abraham’s proposal that the
freshman election be held again by say-
ing that a candidate’s ‘‘responsibility”’ is
to know the rules of the election.

The soft-spoken Bob Willis, sophomore
rep., is probably the most impressive
member of this year’s EC.

He has established himself as the
representative of the independents and
one who is willing to fight the cause for
culture (he was alone in his support of
Kaston’s Film Society).

Willis is a strong supporter of all new
organizations and also led a subcom-
mittee which investigated the possibility
of establishing a grade-review pro-
ceedure at W&L.

His contributions to the Committee
have been significant and he will be a
member to watch in the future.

Jenelle Mims, the first year law school
representative, and Charlie Scott,
freshman rep., have not held office long
enough for a fair assessment to be made
about them. However, both seen to be
more comfortable and relaxed in the EC
room.

In Memoriam

Mrs. Elizabeth
Royall Huntley

Mrs. Elizabeth Royall
Huntley, mother of Washington
and Lee University President
Robert E.R. Huntley, died Sun-
day, November 19, in Winston-
Salem, N.C., where she had liv-
ed for many years.

 

Mrs. Huntley was the widow
of B.F. Huntley. In addition to
her son Robert of Lexington,
she is survived by another son,
Dr. Benjamin F.. Huntley Jr., a
physician in Winston-Salem,

and by six grandchildren.
She was born in the town of
Wake Forest, N.C.,_ the

daughter of the late Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Edward Royall.
Her family had been connected
with Wake Forest University,
then located in that town, for
several generations. Wake
Forest moved to Winston-Salem
in 1956. Her grandfather taught
at Wake Forest for more than 40
years, beginning prior to the
Civil War, and her uncle taught
there for 53 years. Her father
was an alumnus and lifetime
trustee of that university.

It was through her and her
husband’s friendship with the
late Francis Pendleton Gaines,
president of Wake Forest in the
1920s, that the Huntley family
eventually became associated

with Washington and Lee. In
1930 Dr. Gaines left Wake
Forest to become president of
W&L, a position he held for 29
years. The Huntleys maintain-
ed their close friendship with
Dr. and Mrs. Gaines throughout
that time, and when the two

LSAT scores drop

Due to a change in the make-
up in the Law School Admission
Test (LSAT), colleges across
the country are reporting
drastic decreases in scores —
an occurrence which may play
havoc with the admissions pro-
cess in the nation’s law schools.
This information was recently
released by Mike Cappeto,
Assistant Dean of Students and
Director of Career Placement
at W&L.

According to Cappeto, the
Educational Testing Service,
which prepares the LSAT, ‘‘fine
tunes’’ it every year, attemp-
ting to make it discriminate
among candidates more ac-
curately. Last year, they in-
advertantly added too many
questions which led to high
scores. Cappeto commented,
“Last year, there were too
meny scores over 750 that didn’t
belong there. University of
Chicago noticed this first,
reporting 12 times more perfect
scores of 800 than ever before.”

This year, at the insistence of
the Law School Admissions
Council, the ETS refined the
test again — just before the Oc-
tober, 1978 administration. Un-
fortunately for law applicants,
they ‘‘overcompensated’’ for
the original error. And as a
result, scores have entered a
drastic tailspin.

At W&L, last year’s scores
averaged 595; this year they
plummeted to 525. A concerned
Mike Cappeto began to

telephone other colleges in the
area, and discovered similar
dismay. William & Mary
reports score averages down 82
points; VPI is down 90 points
according to local officials; and
though University of Virginia
declined to give a_ specific
number figure, they described
their score drop as “‘alarming.”’

ETS refuses to comment on
these events, and won’t release
nationwide figures until
January or later. So, the pro-
blem becomes obvious. As Cap-
peto states, ‘‘applicants will be
basing their choices of law
schools upon last year’s inflated
LSAT standards, selecting
themselves out of schools in
which they may have a very
good chance of admission.”

To add more fuel to the fire,
law schools appear to be totally
uninformed of this change in the
LSAT. W&L law officials were
unaware of any change when in-
formed by Cappeto. He com-
mented, ‘Somebody — should
take it upon themselves to in-
form the various law
schools...If not, they’re going to
be waiting for high-score ap-
plicants who may never come
in.”

Even so the magnitude of the
LSAT ‘“‘score drop” is_ not
known. As a result, Cappeto
urges students to apply to law
schools assuming that there is
no major discrepancy. Then, as
he says, ‘‘take a few long-shots
in your applications, just in
case.”’
