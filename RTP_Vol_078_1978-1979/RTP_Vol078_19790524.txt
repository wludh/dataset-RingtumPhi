nounced Monday. Chairmen
Sidney Simmons, Craig Cor-
nett, and Dick Schoenfeld called
the convention ‘‘the most pro-
minent of all collegiate political
experiences” in their announce-
ment.

Nader Speaks
Tonight!

Once again, a reminder that
Ralph Nader, consumer
crusader, is scheduled to speak
on campus tonight at 8 p.m. in
Lee Chapel. The lecture is spon-
sored by Contact, W & L’s stu-
dent symposium.

Called ‘‘The U.S.’s Toughest
Customer’’ by Time, Nader will
probably speak on corporate
power in America and the work-
ings of economic governments.

Nader will be greeted at the

afternoon at Dr. Milton Colvin’s
house, rather than a reception

keeping with its tradition of
predicting the nominee of the
party currently out of the White
House.

In other Mock Convention
news, the committee has ap-
pointed 18 additional state
chairmen for the 1980 conclave,
bringing the total to 65. Only
West Virginia remains unfilled,
making this year’s the most
progress ever seen in assembl-
ing a staff before ‘convention

118 To Receive Degrees
In Law Graduation

Separate Ceremony Set For.Sunday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law will award
118 juris doctor degrees during
special commencement exer-
cises this Sunday, May 27, at
4:30 p.m. on the university cam-
pus.

Ariel To Arrive June l

Thirty-two pages of prose and
poetry fill the spring issue of
Ariel, Washington and Lee’s
student literary magazine.
which will be available in the
bookstore June Ist.

According to editor Ben
Keesee the content of this issue
is the best offered to W&L
students in quite a while. The
issue contains no photographs
to allow maximum space for
‘literary’ material.

Asked about the late date of
distribution ‘Keesee replied,
“Well, although printing and
other problems did delay
publication a bit, it was my in-
tention to delay publication as
long as possible in order to in-
clude the best possible
material. We certainly didn’t
intend to leave law students out
in the cold, though, and steps
are being taken to insure that
any law student who wants a
copy of the second issue gets
one.”

The law students’ term ends
and graduation will be held
before the distribution date.
Graduating law students can
have copies mailed to them by
signing a request sheet at the

circulation desk of the law
library. A number of copies will
be reserved for distribution to
law students next fall.

Keesee said his biggest pro-
blem with the second issue was
deciding which pieces to leave
out. ‘‘The response in contribu-
tions for the second issue was
really terrific. We could have
easily run 42 pages of copy plus
pictures if the budget had per-
mitted,’’ he said. He added that
efforts to include as much
material as possible may give a

Carole Chappell called
university proctor Charles
‘Murph’ Murray Wednesday
morning to report a vehicle that
was improperly parked.

Murph arrived at the scene,
anticipating a vehicle parked on
university property in a place it
shouldn’t be. He found, though,
that he could not slap a ticket on
the windshield.

The vehicle was not on
university property; it was in
the middle of the street.

crowded appearance to the
magazine in some spots.

There will be no color cover
on this issue as there was in the
fall. Keesee said although the
color cover played a big part in
the success of the first issue,
funds were limited and he felt it
best to print as much copy as
possible.

He attributed the general suc-
cess of Arielthis year to the sup-
port of the Executive Commit-
tee, Parker Potter, the Ariel
staff and contributors.

Interested members of the
public are invited to attend the

ceremony — which will take
place under the trees in front of
Robert E. Lee’s home, weather
permitting. (If it should rain,
the ceremony will take place in
Lee Chapel. )

Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate commencement
will take place June 7. The
reason for the earlier law
graduation this year — which is
a departure from custom — is
the difference in the academic
calendars between the law
school and the undergraduate
divisions. (The law school re-

mains on a_ two-semester
system, and its second
semester ended Tuesday. The
undergraduate schools are ona
three-term, 12-week-12week-6-
week system, and Spring Term
examinations do not conclude

Besides, there were no wind-
shield wipers to put a ticket
under. In fact, there wasn’t
even a windshield.

It was a bulldozer, parked in
the middle of the street in front
of the student center.

Murph said that three people
wearing fatigues drove the
bulldozer from behind the
ROTC building at about 3:15
a.m. Wednesday. They ap-
parently abandoned the vehicle
in front of the student center
when they saw an approaching

police car.

Murph said whoever took the
bulldozer obviously knew how
to drive one. He also said the the
culprits took the keys to the
bulldozer, and the keys they
took are the only set the con-
struction company has here in
Lexington.

The company does not plan to
prosecute, Murph said, as long
as the keys are returned. The
bulldozer had to be hot-wired to
be returned to the construction
site.

until June 4.)

The speaker at Sunday’s law
commencement ceremony will
be W&L.President Robert E. R.
Huntley. By long-standing
tradition at Washington and
Lee, the president delivers the
principal address at all gradua-
tion ceremonies.

A reception for the law
graduates, their family and
guests, faculty and alumni, will

 

follow the graduation
ceremony.

Who Will The Convention Pick In 1980?

 

 

Reagan, Connally, Baker Are Among The Faces In Cluttered GOP Field

Ronald Reagan

by Ed Taylor

Despite the fact he’d be near-
ly 70 when he took office in the
White House, a recent Time
magazine poll shows Ronald
Reagan as the front-runner for
the 1980 Republican presiden-
tial nomination.

The former governor of
California and onetime liberal
Democrat turned conservative
Republican looms as the early
GOP favorite to assume the
presidency in 1980. In the latest
Gallup Poll of Republican
voters, Reagan led with 31 per-
cent followed by former Presi-
dent Gerald Ford with 26 per-
cent. Former Texas Governor
John Connally was third with 12
of the votes pursued by Senator
Howard Baker of Tennessee
with 8 percent.

However, should Ford choose
not to run — and he has made an
inclination toward this — then
Reagan’s lead jumps to 43 per-
cent followed by Connally with
16 percent.

These early patterns are a far
cry from the 1976 race for the
candidacy when Reagan
started slowly, then came on
strong only to narrowly lose to
the incumbent President Ford.
Had he defeated Ford, Reagan
then would have been the first
candidate in 92 years to take the
nomination away from an in-
cumbent president.

Ronald Reagan was born on
February 6, 1911 in Tampico,
Ill. As a child he became fond of
acting and later attended
Eureka College, a small Chris-
tian Church School near Peoria.
He graduated in 1932 and took a
sports announcing job in Des
Moines, Iowa at WHO, where he
became known as ‘Dutch’
Reagan.

While covering the Chicago
Cubs at spring training in
California, he was asked to take
a screen test and from this his
movie career began. He starred
in such films as ‘Knute

 

Rockne—All American’’ and
“King’s Row.” Although he
didn’t win any Academy
Awards, Reagan utilized his ac-
ting career to sharpen a stage
presence that became a
tremendous asset for him in
politics.

During his acting career,
Reagan was a liberal Democrat
but he later gained fame as an
energetic spokesman proclaim-
ing opposition to centralized
government and support for a
hard-nosed stance by the United
States in foreign affairs. He
strongly supported the free-
enterprise system and
vigorously opposed big govern-
ment.

In 1966, persuaded by friends
from the movie _ industry,
Reagan ran for governor of
California. He was not given
much chance in the race, but
when the votes were tallied he
had swamped incumbent
Democrat Edmund G. Brown
by nearly 845,000 votes.

To put to rest the belief that
his election was a fluke, Reagan
won re-election in 1970 by near-
ly 500,000 votes.

Reagan left the governor’s of-
fice in 1974 and in addition to his
unsuccessful presidential cam-
paign in 1976 he has prospered
as a lecturer, radio commen-
tator and syndicated columnist.
He .now lives in Pacific
Palisades, California with his
wife, Nancy. They have two
children; a daughter, Patricia,
26, anda son, Ronald, 20.

As a front-runner in the 1980
Republican’ presidential
nomination Reagan’s
strategists feel he must start off
winning or he will quickly fade
from the _ public’s favor.
Therefore, a few early primary
victories seem to be a necessity
for Reagan if he expects to win
the Republican nomination at
the 1980 convention in Detroit.

As for the age issue, one sup-
porter said ‘If we win a few
early primaries, it’ll disappear.
If we lose a few, it'll kill us.”’

John Connally

by Craig Cornett

Although he became a
Republican only six years ago,
former Texas governor John B.
Connally is now running hard
for his party’s presidential
nomination and early polls
show him to be a strong con-
tender. The 61-year-old Houston
lawyer became the fourth
declared candidate for the GOP
nomination on January 23 and
has been drawing overflow
crowds on speaking tours ever
since.

Known for a certain self-
confidence and swashbuckling
style, Connally took his lessons
in politics from his mentor:
Lyndon B. Johnson, whom Con-
nally served as a congressional
aide, campaign manager, and
Secretary of the Navy. More
recently, Connally served
President Richard Nixon as
Treasury Secretary for 16
months and later as chairman
of ‘Democrats for Nixon’’ in
the 1972 presidential election.

A staunch political conser-
vative, Connally offers himself
to the nation and his adopted

party as the healer for what he
calls a ‘‘major period of crisis
in our history.’’ He supports a
constitutional amendment for a
balanced budget, eased en-
vironmental controls, incen-
tives for energy production, and
more leeway for the CIA and
FBI.

Connally’s association with
Nixon promises to haunt him
during the campaign, but he
brushes aside criticism by say-
ing: ‘‘My relations with him
(Nixon) were decent and
honest. I served not him, but the
nation. I have no apologies to
make for serving in the Nixon
Administration.”” But heavy
criticism abounds. Sen. George

“McGovern (D-S.D.), the man
Nixon defeated in 1972, has a
more caustic tone. ‘‘I wouldn’t
trust Connally within a mile of
the White House,’’ McGovern
has said. ‘‘John Connally com-
bines the worst of both
Watergate and Vietnam. He’s
the perfect symbol of the
double-talking, double-crossing
politician. He doesn’t even
know what party he belongs
t6.”’

Many of McGovern’s
statements stem from Connal-
ly’s 1975 trial on charges that he
accepted -two $5,000 payoffs
from dairy industry producers
for supporting a price increase
while he was Secretary of the
Treasury. Connally was acquit-
ted on all charges.

While Connally has done
remarkably well in campaign
trips since his announcement,
his home state of Texas could

Howard
Baker

by Norman Ball

Tennessee Senator Howard
Baker all but formally announc-
ed his bid for the 1980
Republican ' presidential
nomination in a TV appearance
May 6. Responding to inquiries
about his possible candidacy on
“Face the Nation,’ Baker
replied, ““You know I am a can-
didate...I’m running hard, I
have a good organization and I
plan to win.”’

This announcement by the 55-
year-old Senate Minority
Leader casts him into an
already cluttered field of GOP
presidential hopefuls, among
them John Connally, George
Bush, Philip Crane, Bob Dole
and, although he has yet to
declare his candidacy, Ronald
Reagan. In recent polls, though,
Baker has emerged reasonably
well, often placing behind
Reagan, Ford and Connally as
the most desirable Republican
presidential candidate.

No stranger to Washington,
Baker first served as a Senator
in 1966, winning handily over
longtime Tennessee governor
Frank Clement. In 1972, he won
re-election with an impressive
62% of the vote, carrying all
eight of the state’s congres-
sional districts, and his ’78 elec-
tion was equally decisive.
Baker’s struggle to grasp
Senate Minority Leader was
just that. He managed to pull
one more vote than Robert Grif-
fin, his opponent in a heated
contest. Baker had tried for the
position two times before
without success.

The Senator first received na-
tional exposure as the ranking
Republican on the Senate
Watergate Committee, and his
name was brought up frequent-
ly as Ford’s most probable run-
ning mate on the ’76 GOP ticket
(although, of course, Robert
Dole was eventually chosen).
Later on this year when Con-
gress considers SALT II,
Baker’s positions on _ the
Foreign Relations Committee
and the Arms Control Subcom-
mittee will offer him added na-
tional recognition.

Ideologically, Baker is hard
to define. He has opposed many
of the traditionally held conser-
vative views during his career,
his most recent defection being
support of the Panama Canal
Treaties — a position which
many Republicans claim will
seriously damage his nomina-
tion chances. During the great

Theatre Brings Hot

Comedy To Boiler Room

by Ben Keesee

A comedy of confusion and
hidden identities characterizes
What The Butler Saw, says
senior drama major and direc-
tor Phil Heldrich: The Universi-
ty Theatre’s production of The
Joe Orton play is scheduled to
run next Tuesday, Friday and
Saturday, May 29 and June 1-2,
at 8 p.m. in the Boiler Room
Theatre as part of the annual
spring Total Theatre program.

The confusion begins with a
psychiatrist’s attempt to seduce
a young woman applying for the
secretary’s job in his office.
Once she is convinced to strip
down for a “physical examina-
tion,’ by Dr. Prentiss (Mike
Moore), the doctor’s wife
stumbles in on the action in the
office — totally unaware of the
girl’s presence. The naked lady
is hidden until Mrs. Prentiss
(Anne Secor) brings in a young
man who stripped her, attemp-
ted a rape and took pictures of
her the night before — and now
intends to blackmail her!

The doctor derives a scheme
which involves switching the
identities of the applicant (Kim
Baker) and the young man,
known as Nick (Charlie
Prioleau) —- who dons women’s
garb to aid in the cover-up. Add-
ed to the confusion is police
surveillance and many other
complications before the final
plot twist at the end.

The play is evidently quite
sexual in nature, and much of
its comic effect relies on
sexually-oriented humor. But it
was a smash success in its
original presentation, though
playwright Orton was killed
before getting a chance to
witness his creation in its final
form.

The script is so liberal, in
fact, that Heldrich said his big-
gest production problem was
obtaining an actress to play the
part of the applicant, Geraldine
Barclay. Originally cast in the
part was a Lexington High
School student. However, when
her father read the script, he

Dodge d’Art In Pit

This Friday at 8:30 p.m. the
featured band in the Cockpit
- will be Dodge d’Art, from
Charlottesville. This will be
their second appearance on
campus since their overwhelm-
ing performance at the MD
Danceathon last March.

Dodge d’Art is Jimmy Eau,
Chris Halpin, and John Young,
on lead guitar, bass and drums,
respectively. It is hard to
believe that only three people
can put out such a good sound,
but they do it song after song.
Jimmy and Chris do all the ar-
ranging of hits from the Sixties,

from such groups as the Stones,

Byrds, and Animals. Jimmy |
also writes many of the original ,

tunes that the band performs —
and they will use half of their
own material in each gig.

The guys are very confident

that their music will be ac- ,

cepted by enthusiastic au-
diences as they continue to play
throughout the state of Virginia,
and other states as well.

There will be a cover charge
of $1.00 for W&L students, $2.00
for non-W&L students.
Showtime is at 8:30 p.m., Fri-
day, May 25.

mine...’’ etc.

Kim Baker, a Mary Baldwin
student, is now cast in the part.
And though she claims that
Heldrich offered her the role
“when I was drunk,’’ she has
stood by her acceptance.

Heldrich said the show should
prove very entertaining. Its
“pseudo-nudity” will draw a
great deal of attention, he
predicted.

Tonight in the Troubadour
Theatre, a series of four one-
man shows will be offered, star-
ting at 7 p.m. Original films
featuring animation, modern
dance, ballet, Shakespearean
spoofs, and an expressionistic
portrayal of life at W&L will be
screened Saturday, Sunday,

Italian Comedy To Be

by Carren O. Kaston

The last W&L Film Society
movie of the season will be Et-
tore Scola’s 1978 Italian comedy
We All Loved Each Other So
Much, in color. It will be shown
free of charge in classroom “‘C”’
of the Law School on Friday and
Saturday, May 25th and 26th, at
8 P.M. An_ end-of-the-year
reception will follow the movie
on both nights in the Lewis Hall
lounge. Everyone is invited.

Scola’s movie pays tribute to
the Italian Neo-Realist school of
film-making and to one of its
greatest directors, Vittorio De
Sica, who is best known for The
Bicycle Thief, Umberto D., Two
Women, and The Garden of the
Finzi-Continis. Italian Neo-
Realism channeled the energies
released after W. W. II into a
cinema of social conscience and
concern for the ordinary man.
It believed in the documentary
power of the everyday surfaces
of life to reveal what was mean-
ingful and ‘‘real’’ about ex-
perience. It sought to define the
possibilities of cinema apart
from the theatre, and it moved
away from the ostentatious ex-
perimeatation in camera and
editing techniques to which the
theatrical background of direc-
tors like Murnau and Eisenstein
had led. Instead, it emphasized
the dignity and value of human

life as revealed in unobtrusive
camera work and minimal
editing.

As ideas about what was
“real” became less sure (par-
ticularly apparent in the rise of
French New Wave films),
however, the Neo-Realist sense
that “reality’’ resided in sur-
faces and external ap-

pearances, the look of things;

came to seem inadequate.
Scola’s tribute to the Neo-
Realist movement, therefore,
both celebrates its humanity,
and reveals the limitations of its
assumptions about what con-
stitutes ‘‘real”’

Golf Team Places
11th In Nationals

The Washington and Lee golf
team finished eleventh in The
Division III National Cha ion-
ships held at the Brandermill
Country Club in Richmond, Va.

W&L was one of twenty teams
selected on the basis of regular
season play. The Generals
finished earlier this month with
a 14-2 overall record.

The four-day tournament,
held May 15-18, saw the golfers
move from a disappointing 19th
place slot after the first round,
and go steadily upward.
However, their advance was
halted just short of the top ten
level.

Five W&L golfers _par-
ticipated in the event: Dave

Leunig, Gerry Barousse, Andy
Fitzgerald, Bill Alfano, and Jim
Kaplan. Barousse, a sophomore
from New Orleans, gained
second-team All-American
honors in finishing at a tie for
eleventh place overall.

Emerging as 1979 team cha
ions were the golfers from
University of California —
Stainslaus, who placed five men
on the three All-American
teams.

W&L coach Buck Leslie was
pleased with the team’s pro-
gress during each round of the
tournament; still, he cited the
difficult Brandermill course as
one reason for his team’s high
scores.

Alumni, Varsity Tie 0-0

On Sunday May 13, the
second-annual Varsity-Alumni
Soccer game was held in a tor-
rential downpour. An _ ex-
perienced, talented alumni
team, captained by John
Buckley ’°’73, threatened con-

The varsity came up with

to be called with fifteen minutes
remaining because of the
dangerous playing conditions.

Many students are complain-
ing about the harsh treatment
the faculty has threatened the
fraternities with for miscon-
duct. Before they begin yearn-
ing for the good old days,
though, they should consider
how it used to be.

A glance through a file of IFC
Judicial Board minutes reveals
that in the mid to late sixties
fraternities were punished
severely for what was then call-
ed misconduct and what is now
standard operating proceedure.

The biggest problems came
from rules prohibiting females
in the fraternity houses after 2
a.m. every night except Friday
and Saturday nights of Dance
Weekends, when they could
stay until 3 a.m.

Here are some examples of
misconduct in connection with
this rule. and the subsequent
punishments :

In 1969, several girls were
seen above the ground floor of a
fraternity and some girls spent
the night, claming their rides
had left them. The fraternity
was placed on social probation
for a month.

In 1966, a housemother saw a
senior come down from the se-
cond floor with his date. He was
reminded that this was against
the rules. He and his date were
discovered the next morning
sleeping on the couch
downstairs. The IFC did not
prosecute the fraternity
because the offense was of an
individual nature, but the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee put the
student on a week’s social pro-
bation. He had to move out of
the house during that period.

In 1966, Murph reported see-
ing several dates leave a frater-
nity after curfew. Because the
house had appeared before the
IFC three times previously, it
was placed on a month’s social
probation.

The IFC heard a case in 1965
where a fraternity had girls on
its premises without a
housemother or chaperone. The
fraternity claimed that the girls
were kept outside on the porch
(where they were given dinner )
and therefore were not in the
house. The IFC clarified the
rule that girls were not allowed
on premises, including the out-
side property, without proper
chaperoning.

The IFC put another house on
social probation for two weeks
for having girls on premises at 4
a.m. in 1970. Another was put on

social probation for a month for
two violations in one weekend.

Rumors in “‘epithetical pro-
portion” of destruction in a
fraternity caused enough con-
sternation on the Hill that the
president of the IFC wrote the
house president, warning him
that his house was putting the
availability of university loans
to fraternities in jeopardy. This
was in 1969.

Rules about hazing and pledg-
ing were enforced by the IFC
when complaints came to its at-
tention.

A fraternity in 1969 held a
pledge activity after the curfew
of 11 p.m. for such activities.
The house was fined $75 and
placed on Conduct Probation

for a year in areas dealing with
pledging.

Two months social probation
was the punishment for one
house who, in 1968, violated
“the basic principles of good
taste.” The pledges put on a skit
in the nude when dates were
present. The president said he
warned the girls of potential
“srossness’’ and asked them to
leave. A fight broke out when a
date was hit on the leg with a
trophy. The Fraternity testified
that there were no references
made to the housemother or her
daughter. Nonetheless, the IFC
took into account complaints
from girls schools and indecent
exposure by two members at a
girls school, when reaching the

The Ring-tum Phi, May 24, 1979, Page 5

Fraternities: On Those “‘Good Old Days”

decision.

For violating the same rule of
violating the principles of good
taste, a house was put on three
week’s social probation. That
house had topless dancers at a
party, who eventually ‘‘took it
all off.”’

Charges of hazing were often
brought before the IFC. A house
was fined $100 for branding its
pledges. The pledges had had
their sides smeared with butter,
and a heated bottle was placed
on the butter. (The mark usual-
ly disappeared within three
days and the pledges testified
that the process did not hurt. )

Student Affairs Committee
imposed a $100 fine on a house

for paddling. In the incident in-
volved, the fraternity claimed
that only one swat with the pad-
dle was administered, and that
was by the pledges’ big brother
as part of a tradition. No
pledges complained of any pain
lasting after the swat.

Another house ‘‘violated the
principles of good taste’’ when
its pledges were across the
street from the house and the
pledge trainer yelled, ‘‘Let me
see 16 moons.”’ Because the IFC
felt this could be damaging to
the fraternity, the fraternity
system, and the University if
witnessed, the house was placed
on six weeks social probation.
This was in 1967.

Admissions Info Encouraging

Fifty-six percent of the ap-
plicants to whom Washington
and Lee University offered ad-
mission for September have
confirmed their decision of
coming to W&L, according to a
summary admissions report by
the university released since
last week’s Ring-tum Phi
report.

The 56 percent figure is an ex-
traordinarily high “‘yield’’ for
any college, according to W&L
admissions director William M.
Hartog, and equals the best
“yield” figure in recent W&L
memory, he said.

Other statistics for the
freshman class that will enroll
in September are even more im-
pressive in many respects, Har-
tog said.

For example, the university
has had a sharp jump this year

in the proportion of ‘‘top-ten-
percent” students who chose
W&L this year, he said.

Of next fall’s total of 369
entering students, 27 percent
rank in the top tenth of their
secondary-school graduating
classes. Last year the com-
parable statistic was 22 per-
cent.

And among next fall’s
freshmen from public high
schools, the ‘‘top-20-percent’’
figure shows an even more
dramatic jump — to 67 percent
from this past year’s 56 percent.

Of the members of the 1979
entering class, 16 at Washington
and Lee will have been valedic-
torians or salutatorians of their
secondary-school classes, Har-
tog reported, and the class will
include five National Merit
Scholars.

All the statistics are unusual
for a college with as small an
entering class as Washington
and Lee’s, Hartog said.

College Board scores remain-
ed almost exactly the same as
they have at W&L for the past
several years — at an average
of 540 on the verbal test for next
fall’s freshmen and 585 on the
mathematics test, Hartog said.
The combined College Board
score average of 1,125 is within
two percent of the comparable
W&L figures for each year in
the 1970s.

He said there appears to have.

been no dramatic shift in next
fall’s freshmen either in terms
of public-school/private-school
breakdown or in state of

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Beware
of confusion...

The faculty’s special meeting on fraternities is
scheduled for Monday — and confusion is the order of
the day. Proposals, counter-proposals, and amend-
ments fill the air and the faculty mailboxes. Some
iprofessors, seeing that this may be “one of those
meetings’, are wondering if attendance is to be
taken. And several others have little or no idea what
they will be expected to vote for or against next week.

It would have been our pleasure to print the various
options already presented by the faculty and student
committees, in order to clear some of the fog. But for
the first time this year, nobody’s talking. Evidently
it’s just “too complex’’ for the Phi to print. Well, this
may be true — and as I remain deeply convinced of
the worth of fraternity self-government, I will cer-
tainly refrain from clouding the issue further.

Still, the fact that many professors are themselves
unsure of the proposals and what is to be gained
disturbs me deeply. I would urge (even implore) the
entire faculty to research the matter and give it
serious thought. It was only two years ago that the
faculty — again in a confused meeting — could come
to no decision over when to have the Washington holi-
day break, and ended the marathon session by
eliminating the break altogether! What a shame if the
fraternities fall prey to, an equally rash decision,
made in the midst of confusion and in the interests of

“setting everybody home in time for dinner...”’ :

Journalism Professor Uncovers
Forgotten Radio Inventor

Every schoolchild knows that
radio was “invented” by an
Italian named Guglielmo Mar-
coni, right? It’s there in black-
and-white in the World
Almanac, isn’t it, and haven’t
there been government postage
stamps saying as much, and
what could be proof more
positive than that?

There’s a spot of a problem,
though, with the conventional
wisdom. The fact, you see, is
that radio was invented — that
is to say: intelligible elec-
tromagnetic impulses were
transmitted from one place to
another place without benefit of
connecting wires — _ con-
siderablybefore Marconi was
even born. :

The true story has been there
in the records, in archives here
and there, in scattered bits and
pieces, for more than a hundred
years. But until now it just
never all got pieced together.
And in instances like that,
legends conjure themselves up,
and everyone knows that fan-
ciful stories die hard or not at
all, like the one Mencken
started about Millard
Fillmore’s installing the first
bathtub in the White House.
‘Tain’t so, McGee, but you can’t

stop people from thinking so’

anyway.

Make no mistake about it;
Marconi’s contributions to the
development of practical radio
technology were monumental,
and he deserves all the postage
stamps and all the entries in all
the almanacs.

But he didn’t invent radio. He
brought it up, but he wasn’t its
father. He was its nanny.

Almost nobody has heard of a
dentist named Mahlon Loomis;
he’s never been commemorated
on a postage stamp, and if you
want to see a memorial to him
you have to pull off Virginia
State Route 7 east of Berryville
and read one of those little road-
side markers.

And that — as Mahlon
Loomis’s pioneering ex-
perimentation enables Walter
Cronkite to aver each evening a
hundred and eleven years later
— that is the way it really is.

The saga is told in the new
issue of Iron Worker, an ex-
cellent, but undeservedly
obscure, quarterly journal
published by the Lynchburg
(Va.) Foundry, devoted largely
to details and sidelights of
Virginia history.

The article is by R. H. Mac-
Donald, a veteran broadcaster
himself and now professor and
head of the Department of Jour-
nalism and Communications at
Washington and Lee Universi-

ty. It’s the result of several —

years’ research and an obses-
sion of modest proportion to set
the record straight that Mac-
Donald has never quite been
able to overcome.

Mahlon Loomis’s “inventive

- mind never stayed quiet long,”’

MacDonald observes with
understatement. Early in his
career he developed a new kind
of porcelain compound for the
manufacture of false teeth. In
1881 he received a patent for a
combination briefcase and
miniature Morris chair that you
took along on the train and it
converted into a desk.

That, though, came after he
had succeeded in developing the
principle of radio communica-
tion and making it work. He
formed a company, but his luck
was like Joe Bptfslk’s in the old
Li’l Abner strip. His first in-
vestors lost everything in 1869’s
Black Friday market crash. A
couple of years later the
Chicago fire wiped out his se-
cond set of backers’ assets.
“Finally, the company was put
to rest forever by the Wall
Street panic of 1873.”’

Loomis lived just about
everywhere at one point or
another. He was born in upstate
New York and grew up in what

today is considered suburban
Washington, D.C. He learned
dentistry in Cleveland, practic-
ed for a time in New York, then
soon afterwards moved to
Massachusetts. In the 1870s he:
lived near Lynchburg, where,
incidentally, he invented a
collar-cuff stay. Chicago was
the site of the series of collapses
of his financial ventures. (None
of this is to suggest that he was
a drifter, of course. After all,
Loomis was an inventor and
possessed an education. So let it
be said simply that he was ec-
centric and very, very mobile. )

He died in. 1886 (and,
peripatetic to the end, was
buried in West Virginia). It was
nine years later that Marconi
received his patent for a system
of transmitting radio signals.

In 1922 Literary Digest, then
preeminent in its field but to-
day, come to think of it, of
memory only slightly more
blessed than Mahlon Loomis’s,
noted with a touch of sadness
that ‘‘plaudits are reserved for
the man who succeeds in mak-
ing the principle or method or
mechanism known to the world,
rather than for the original in-
vestigator. So there is not the
slightest probability that the
name of Mahlon Loomis will
ever supplant that of Marconi
as ‘the father of the radio.’”’

But Iron Worker has lasted
longer than Literary Digest,
and so, as a matter of fact, has
Ron MacDonald. There may be
hope yet.

Washington and Lee’s Ron
MacDonald, chronicler of the
Loomis story, has been hither
and thither himself, too. He
began his career in radio at ©
Boston (Mass.) University.
S»h<cquently he went a little
way north, to Waterbury, Vt.,
but eventually meandered
south and went to work for

Seven faculty members and

In the field of chemistry they
included Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
associate professor of
chemistry; Daniel J. Carucci, a
junior from Pound Ridge, N.Y.;
David H. Harpole Jr., a junior
from Roanoke; Jerome E.

provide the key. The Texas
primary will be crucial for Con-
nally, and he faces stiff com-
petition from fellow-Texan and
former Congressman and CIA
Director George Bush as well as
from former California gover-
nor Ronald Reagan, who did
well in Texas in 1976. Texas’
Republican Gov. William P.
Clements has repeatedly said
that he is committed to seeing
Jimmy Carter lose Texas in the
1980 election and Clements pro-
mises to be a GOP power

broker. The Texas state
legislature is
debating whether to have a
presidential preference
primary in March and a regular
state and local primary in July,
which is thought to be greatly to
Connally’s advantage because
of his old-line conservative
Democratic support. But 12
liberal state senators were ab-
sent from the legislature for
close to a week and the Texas
Senate had no quorum. The Lt.
Governor finally ordered war-
rants for the arrest and return
of the truant senators.

Connally, also considered to
be the wealthiest GOP can-

on which primaries to enter, but
will probably start in New
Hampshire and enter only
primaries in states that earn

than states that only have

racial tensions of the 60’s,
Baker was one of the few
southern politicians who chose
not to exploit the situation,
although he could have preach-
ed racism effectively in
predominantly white Ten-
nessee.

It is expected that much of
Baker’s support will come from
moderate Republicans, _par-
ticularly Ford’s old supporters.
He has few enemies in the party
and in the case of a deadlocked
convention, he might be ad-
vanced as a compromise can-
didate. As Baker himself said,
‘*Republican presidential
chances haven’t been better
since 1952...the country’s

mains to be seen whether the
Republican Party thinks Baker

The Student Body Executive
Committee heard year-end
reports from many of the cam-
pus organizations it provides
funds for.

Dick Schoenfeld of the Cold
Check Committee said the com-
mittee has processed over
$4,000 woth of student’s bad
checks this year. He said
students at the university owe
$381 and students who have left
the university owe $234.

The Student Activities Board
reported that it has set aside
$1,000 for legal fees for the
lawyer handling the contract
dispute with Firefall’s agents.
When accounting for low
revenues from the movies, it
was suggested that perhaps at-
tendance was low due to tighter
security at the door concerning
students smuggling in beer. The
SAB pointed out that many of
this year’s films were very ex-
pensive, and that there was not
sufficient increase in audience
size to justify the expense.

A Calyx spokeman said that
final bills are not in yet, and
that many seniors have not
picked up their pictures or paid
for their sittings. The yearbooks
are expected to be distributed
today or tomorrow.

a reception at a fraternity house
will not be held; instead, Nader
will be greeted at the mock con-
vention cookout this afternoon
at Dr. Colvin’s house.

Wall also suggected that the
IFC draw up a standing list of
fraternity houses for the rota-
tion of receptions, rather than
hve random drawings for each
speaker. He said this might
alleviate problems experienced
earlier this year.

The EC voted to have a party
for the EC members at Beau
Dudley’s house Monday. The
EC originally voted to use $75 of
student funds for this, but
representatives Calvert and
Willis disagreed with the princi-
ple of using student body funds
for something the entire student
body could not benefit from.
The EC changed its decision
and Willis offered to buy a keg
or liquor for the affair. Dydley
and Charlie Scott were ap-

cent of the total. The next states
are, in order, Maryland (9.5
percent), New York (8 per-
cent), Pennsylvania (7.8 per-
cent), New Jersey and South
Carolina (5.4 percent each),
Texas (4.6 percent), and Con-
necticut (4 percent).

Hartog announced in last
week’s Phi that the number of
completed applications W&L
received for 1979 admission was
1,085, up 11.2 percent from last
year’s figure, which had been
the lowest in years. The latest
admissions report continues to
attribute last year’s decline to
the addition of a formidable
essay requirement as part of
the W&L application process.

But the university later con-
cluded that the essay require-
== had a negliglible effect

either on the size or on the
academic talent of the class
that actually enrolled.

Despite last year’s smaller
“pool” of applications, W&L
achieved a class that was ac-
tually larger than the 350 it has
fixed as its annual freshman
goal, and the credentials re-
mained as strong as they had
been in recent years when
larger numbers of applications
were received.

W&L officials speculated that
the essay requirement served
primarily to discourage
students whose writing ability
was inferior.

This year, the university
again included an essay re-
quirement — in modified form
— as part of the application pro-
cedure.
