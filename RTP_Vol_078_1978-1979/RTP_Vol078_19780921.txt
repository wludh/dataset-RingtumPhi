VOLUME LXXVIII

by Randy Smith

In its first meeting of the
school year, the Executive
Committee, Washington and
Lee’s student government, reaf-
firmed last year’s ruling that all
student committee meetings be
open except for committee
votes. No issue can be voted on
in private that has not been
discussed during the public
meeting.

The only exceptions to the
rule are student honor trials,
Student Control Committee
hearings, and final decisions
made by the Student Activities
Board on the Fancy Dress Ball
theme.

In addition, the E.C. specified
that all committee meetings be
noticed around campus, with
the agenda and time, ‘‘well in
advance” of the meeting.

SAB meeting closed

The open meetings issue
came up after a Ring-tum Phi
reporter disclosed to junior
E.C. representative Steve

. Abraham that the SAB had clos-

OR

 

en Meetings Rule

Reaffirmed by E.C.

ed its meeting Sunday night to
the two reporters present ‘‘to
discuss Fancy Dress’’ and its
theme.

Abraham, who instigated the
open meetings rule last year,
said that “‘the idea behind open
meetings was that student body
funds are being“used and the
students should have a say”’ in
how the money is appropriated.

‘All meetings should be open
except for the final vote,”
Abraham reiterated.

Hank Hall, one of the co-
chairmen of the SAB, said that
his committee ‘‘closed the
meeting when we discussed
Fancy Dress, and, as far as I
know, it has always been done
that way.”

The other co-chairman, Doug
Jackson, said that if possible
themes are discussed in public
and in the newspaper,
“everybody will know about
Fancy Dress.” (Traditionally,
the theme of the annual Fancy
Dress Ball has been kept a
closely guarded secret. )

Jackson said that the SAB

gathers its input for Fancy
Dress suggestions ‘“‘from the
members of the board, who
have spoken with their
friends.”

“If you want student input, I
don’t see why you’re afraid to
have an open meeting about it,’”’
Abraham said.

Jackson replied that the SAB
relies on its members, “who
will keep the theme secret.”

“TI don’t understand your
(Abraham’s) lack of faith in the
SAB to make intelligent deci-
sions,’’ said Rob Calvert, senior
E.C. representative,

E.C. president Beau Dudley
added that the Executive Com-
mittee ‘‘bent over backwords to
get a representative group on
the SAB”’ last spring.

The result of the discussion
was a reaffirmation of the open
meeting rule with exceptions
for voting and the ‘‘final deci-
sions being made on the Fancy
Dress theme.’’ The distinction

Rock and Soul bands hired

for Homecoming weekend

by Dick Moss

In a unanimous decision Sun-
day night, the Student Activities
Board voted to hire two bands
for Homecoming Weekend. The
two banks, one rock and one
soul, will tentatively cost $2900,
well over half the $4000-$4500
the SAB had budgeted for the
weekend.

The rock band, Song Bird,
($850) and the soul band, the
Impressions, ($2000) were

among the most expensive
bands considered by the SAB in
the rock and soul categories,
which were the only two
musical categories suggested at
the meeting.

Other suggestions about
Homecoming Weekend discuss-
ed were a keg party in the Law
School field before the concert,
and the use of the old gym for
the concert itself. However, no
definite. decision was reached

on these matters, especially on
the use of the old gym, which
must be approved first by Dick
Miller of the Physical Educa-
tion department.

Other important matters
discussed at the meeting includ-
ed the need for a banquet
license for Zollman’s Pavilion
from the Alcohol Beverage Con-
trol Board (ABC). According to

_IFC to go to City
Council about noise

by David Greer
and Randy Smith

Interfraternity Council presi-
dent Jim Davis will present a
list of fraternity “concessions”
to the noise ordinance to the
Lexington City Council tonight
in an attempt to gain some
police ‘‘bending” of the city’s
noise restrictions for fraternity
parties.

This action follows a meeting
between Lexington Police Chief
James A. Kirby, City Manager
John Doane, Washington and
Lee Student Body president
Beau Dudley, assistant Dean of
Students Dan Murphy, and
Davis last Friday afternoon.

The IFC voted last Thursday
night to send Davis and Dudley
to Chief Kirby with the list of
“concessions” in the hope that
the Lexington police would en-
force the city’s noise ordinance
less stringently. Both Kirby and
Doane suggested that the
students approach the City
Council with their suggestions.

Dudley said that it is
necessary to present the pro-
posals to both the police and ci-
ty hall because the police only
have limited “‘discretion as to
what laws they can waive’’ and
both bodies must agree to in-
formal changes in the law.

Proposed ‘‘concessions”’

The proposed ‘‘concessions”’
include the agreement that
fraternities will have parties
only on one designated
weeknight with all music turned
off at 1 a.m. Weekend parties
will also have a cut-off time,
although the specific time has
not yet been voted on by the
IFC. a

Failure for a fraternity to
comply with these guidelines
will result in a $100 fine for the
first offense and Judicial Board
action for subsequent offenses.

The police, in exchange, it is

hoped, will not enforce the or-
dinance unless violations occur
after the agreed-to hour, and
will issue warnings before ar-
resting offenders. (Kirby has
ordered that no warnings be
given.)

It is also hoped that the police
will only act on a citizen com-
plaint, and will not enforce the
ordinance during the daylight
hours.

In addition, the students will
attempt to gain special permis-
sion to waive the noise or-
dinance completely on W&L’s
three big weekends—
Homecoming, Fancy Dress,
and Spring weekend.

Last Friday

Although no agreement was
reached in last Friday’s ©
meeting, Davis said Kirby was
interested in the IFC’s sugges-
tions, except for the daylight ex-
emption proposal.

Kirby added that the students
would have to approach the City
Council with a petition to have
special permission to have no
cut-off, fime for music on the
threedig weekends.

Davis said that despite these
problems, “It looks pretty
good; I think they’ll go for it.”’

Dissention

Not all fraternities agreed
with the concessions, however.

Sigma Nu president John
Craig did not agree with the
idea of automatic shutdown
hours regardless of noise levels
and the limit of one night per
week for parties. His house a:id
Kappa Alpha did not accept the
concessions.

Phi Gamma Delta felt that

the police’s end of the whole

deal was vague and too open-
ended.

Andy Fitzgerald, president of
Phi Kappa Psi, said that his

Ring-tum Phi Interview

Frank Parsons: W&L’s Man

by Neil Pentifallo

Ten years ago a girl working
in the duplicating center of
Washington and Lee University
took copies of material up three
flights to her boss. She was sure
the copy was perfect. Her
supervisor pulled out a metal
ruler, and showed her the copy
was off center of the original by
1/32 of an inch. He did not repri-
mand her, but showed her that a
metal ruler is more accurate
that the wooden ruler she used.

Frank A. Parsons expects the
employees of the university to
do their best and continually
learn to improve their per-
formance. The difference bet-
ween Parsons and other ad-
ministrators is that he usually
accomplishes this.

Parsons’ demand for perfec-
tion is combined- with a:
thorough knowledge of many
fields. When the duplicating’
center ordered an offset press,,-
Parsons knew how to run it:
when it was delivered. (He:
showed the company salesman,
how it should be run...)

He has held a multitude of
positions at W&L, (every posi-
tion, it seems, except janitor).
He came to W&L as Director of
Information Services (since
renamed the News Office), but
soon assumed more duties.

Under President Fred C.
Cole, (1959-1967) Parsons was
put in charge of institutional
research. This turned out to be
a ‘diluted job,’’ Parsons ex-
plains, because he was not able
to devote energy to any par-
ticular field. Not only did he
coordinate the school’s public
relations efforts, but he wrote
Cole’s speeches, supervised the

  

a?

  
 
   

 

tant to the president” and the ‘‘Curator of Trees and Squirrels.”’

photography was sparked. Bob
Keefe, Director of the News Of-
fice, estimates that 35 people
now have the responsibilities
that Parsons juggled at one
time.

Parsons did not expect to
become so immersed in his

development program. Presi-
dent Cole felt that institutional
and federal assistance were
more important than alumni
fund-raising, and phased out the
development program. He later
decided to reverse this trend,
and Parsons teamed with Far-

Parsons bills himself as the ‘‘general purpose administrative assis-

Damascus Road?

Parsons also listed his posi-
tion as being Curator of Trees
and Squirrels, referring to when
he became a celebrity at the
Dept. of Health, Education and
Welfare. Parsons was working
on an endlessly long application
for funds to be used in building
W&L’s proposed new library.
HEW wanted to know if the new
library would ‘‘create or
precipitate an identifiable long-
term change in the diversi-
ty of species within its natural
habitat?”’ After several idiotic
questions such as this, Parsons
decided to beat the bureaucrats
at their own game. He wrote
that ‘‘the squirrels are the most
visible inhabitants of the site,
but there are occasional
sightings of rabbits, skunks,
and snakes. No effort has been
made to date to determine
whether these are residents or
transients. Some birds nest in
trees that will be removed, but
as noted earlier, there is no
scarcity of other, equally
suitable trees that will re-
main.”’

 

When the duplicating center ordered an offset press,
Parsons knew how to run it, and even showed the
company salesman how it should be run

 

alma mater. He wanted to pur-
sue a career in journalism, and,
was working for the Clifton
Forge Daily Review when he
was called to- W&L. President
Gaines (1930-1959) was in the
midst of expelling football
players from school because of
a cheating scandal, and his
director of public information
resigned. The head of the jour-
nalism department made
several recommendations to

 

WE&L’s last “jack-of-all-trades”

 

duplicating center, handled
sports publicity, was curator of
Lee Chapel, and organized a
self-study report. He also put
out the alumni magazine, which
he says ‘‘was a lick and a pro-
mise’’ but nevertheless an ac-
complishment considering his
other r2sponsibilities. He even
had to take his own picture for
the magazine, and an interest in

Gaines for a replacement, and
Parsons’ name was high on the
list. Parsons recalls that there
is a story that his baldness got
him his job, because Gaines
supposedly wanted someone
mature. All it took was one look
at Parsons’ head to land him the
position.

Parsons was instrumental in
later years in rebuilding the

ris Hotchkiss to delve into the
project.

Soon after, Cole resigned as
president and Robert E.R.
Huntley was selected. Hot-
chkiss assumed the duties of
Director of Development from
Parsons, and Parsons was mov-
ed to his present position. He
now coordinates planning for
the university, and describes
his job in a mouthful as being a

“general purpose admin-
istrative assistant to the presi-
dent.”

According to one campus of-
ficial, Parsons “has a situa-
tional humor...He has a genteel
way of pointing out the absurdi-
ty of some situation or pro-
posal.’”’ Parsons lists his
research topics as being ‘Adolf
Hitler—Misunderstood Good
Guy?”’ and another as being
“U.F.0’s and the Bible—What
Really Happened on _ the

“It will be difficult to tell if
they’re unhappy about having
to find new trees to live in and
sport about. Otherwise no
change in their behavior pat-
tern is anticipated.”

“The library would appear to
have no capacity for affecting
the squirrel’s or other animal’s
genes.”

Soon copies of the ‘‘squirrel
memo” began to appear all
over the HEW web. Parsons
received a letter from the direc-

Behind the Scenes

tor of the agency saluting
Washington and Lee and
wishing that ‘“‘your squirrels
and your great university co-
exist in harmony for many,
many years.”

Parsons explains that a lot of
his job is filling out forms for
the federal government or in-
stitutions. He claims to have a
D.F.A. (Doctor of Federal Aid),
and an M.S. degree (Master of
Squirrels).

Parsons also has a ‘‘super-
ficial interest” in comics. He
plans to present a paper on
them to That Club, a discussion
group in which members cover
different topics. He plans to sell
his comic collection, which
numbers in the hundreds, after
he presents his paper.

Parsons complains that the
nature of his present work gives
him less personal satisfaction
than his earlier responsitilities.
He said that he had more tangi-
ble items when he would write a
speech for Cole, or see the end
result of his work on the alumni
magazine. “‘Now,”’ he says, “I
take pride in what others do
around me and when they
receive recognition.’”’ He ex-
plains that even though he can
look at the Law School and ap-
preciate the planning that he
was so intricately a part of,
there still were many others in-
volved in the project.

Parsons does not brag about
his work; in fact, he is rather
humble. He is glad that he
doesn’t have to work on the
alumni magazine, or sports
publicity, or take pictures for
the school, because ‘‘profes-
sionals are now doing that
work, and much better than I
could.” But how comforting to
know that in the midst of all the
“‘professionals,’’ W&L still has
one last jack-of-all-trades left.

 

 

Homecoming weekend set

(continued from page one)
never was a license for
Zollman’s and the ABC has just
now insisted that there be one.
This applies even for parties
where students provide their
own beverages. Also, no tickets
are to be sold at the door, but
only in advance of any
Zollman’s parties.

Doug Jackson, co-chairman
of the SAB, said that he ‘‘feels
confident that we can get the
license’’ but also said that the
SAB will not apply for it until
after Christmas break. The
reason, according to Jackson, is

that the faculty has pressured
the SAB to have no Thursday
night parties, but has consented
to one Thursday night party at
Zollman’s during Fancy Dress
this year. The faculty, ac-
cording to Jackson, will not con-
sider any other Thursday night
parties this year by the SAB.

In related matters, the SAB is
planning a rebuttal to the
University Council’s suggestion
that Fancy Dress weekend be
held inside the Washington holi-
day this winter.

The SAB also decided to fix
the movie rate at $1 again this

year, with slightly higher prices
on more popular movies. Just
where the movies will be shown
this year is still undecided.

 

 

Correction

The Interfraternity Council
regrets the publication last
week of a statement that Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity had
been fined $20 because their
rush official had passed out
from drunkenness at a rush
function. Phi Gamma Delta was
not at fault and the IFC regrets

the error.

Fulbright Scholarships

now available

by Brian Gibson

The competition for Fulbright
Scholarships for the 1979-80
academic year is now open, ac-
cording to Dr. Charles Turner,
the head of this program at
Washington and Lee. The pro-
gram provides grants for study
abroad: at universities in a
specified country. Also, travel
and living expenses are paid up
to amaximum grant of $3,700.

Seniors with an average of
3.00 or better are eligable to do
graduate work in their field in a
university in a foreign country
for which they apply. These ap-
plications should be made of a
country whose language the ap-
plicant speaks with some
degree of fluency. Dr. Turner
said that most W&L students
have received grants to either
France or West Germany.

Since the program started in
1948, Washington and Lee men

have received scholarships
every year except one. The
most in any one year was four
and last year we had two
scholars. One of these, Mark
Bradley, also received a
Rhodes scholarship. This situa-
tion has only happened once
before, and Dr. Turner said that
both men took the Rhodes
scholarship because it is for two
full years of study at Oxford and
is even more prestigious than
the Fulbright. The Fulbright is
renewable but it is a relatively
rare occurance.

The scholarship program was
started by Senator J. William
Fulbright and was originally in-
tended to serve as a repayment
for the Lend-Lease program of
World War II. Each country
which sponsors scholarships
has a national board composed
of American professors who
select students to receive
grants. Professor Jenks is on
the national board for Austria.

Change in IFC

weekend proposed

by David Greer

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Jim Davis and Bill Mauck
proposed changing IFC
weekend, traditionally held in
the fall, to the spring. They
pointed out that the only
available weekends are two
that either conflict with Hollins’
Fall Weekend or the weekend
following Homecoming.

The spring date will have the
advantages of better weather
and more available funds. It is
hoped that food can be served
as well as beer. A band will also
be \ featured. The fraternities
voted to accept the change.

In other business, Rush
Chairman Chris Volk said that
it is alright for fraternities to in-
vite freshmen down for meals.
He added that there will be no
contact Friday except for Dorm
Rush and the scheduled Rush
Dates. He also said that it is
permissable to give bids at
times other than the Rush
Dates.

Phi Delta Theta was fined ten
dollars for returning two
freshmen late after the {first
rush date. Sigma Nu and Pi
Kappa Alpha were also charged
with late returns and the matter
is being looked into by the IFC
Judicial Board.

This year, 505 grants to fifty-
two countries will be given.
Most of these are given for
European countries and
Washington and Lee alumni
have only gotten scholarships to
European countries in the past.

The Institute of International
Education in New York is the
governing body for this pro-
gram and processes all the ap-
plications. This organization
notifies accepted students
sometime in January for the
coming year. Dr. Turner said
that no student should hesitate
to apply because almost all ma-
jors are represented among the
current Fullbright scholars. In-
terested students should con-
tact Dr. Turner for an applica-
tion or to answer any questions
which they might have.

However, the deadline is Oc-
tober 25, so if anyone is in-
terested, they should talk to Dr.
Turner within the next two
weeks.

Alan Kendrick

Three Washington and Lee
graduates have recently opened
a store for retail backpacking
equipment.

The store, Rockbridge Outfit-
ters, is located at the intersec-
tion of Jefferson and Main
Streets, just off the W&L cam-
pus.
Christopher Camps and Doug
Perkins, who graduated from
W&L last year, and John Scott,
class of 1975, opened the shop
last week.

Camps stated that the store
would make available for pur-
chase on sight many items of
quality name-brand backpacks,
tents, sleeping bags, boots,
clothing, and accessories that
were previously available to
Lexington area residents only
through mail-order catalogs
and that prices would often be
lower than those of the large
mail-order companies.

The outdoorsman who is sick
of getting the wrong size, color,
shape, design, or model in the
mail and doesn’t have the cash
for a bus ticket to the Freeport,
Maine store can now take a few
hundred yards hike to the new
retailer.

In walking into the rustic
store, which has walls done ina
variety of eyecatching inlaid
work, one can find all the
necessities a serious
backpacker needs for a com-
fortable outing. Flyweight
backpack tents by Northface,
Cureka, and Camp Trails,
designed for snow or summer
climate, are set up for examina-
tion in between racks of attrac-
tive, comfortable clothing made
by Coming Attractions and
other handmade clothing com-
panies. Raichle and other hik-
ing and climbing boots and
Dunham hunting boots in all

ofessor of law, and Jay B. Labov, assistant professor
stant mathematics professor; William M. Hartog, ad-
professor of philosophy, and Jean C. Dunbar, assistant pro-

sizes are ready for a trial walk
around the store. And
backpacks, from the tiniest day
packs to the largest, strongest,
best engineered frame packs
may be tried out.

The three partners stated that
they would make every effort to
aid outdoors enthusiasts in
making their plans. A complete
series of the Appalachian Trail
Maps are available and clinics
can be set up with experts in
areas of hiking, camping, clim-
bing, canoeing and skiing.

In addition, high quality snow
skiing equipment (by Beconta:
Kastle skis, Dolomite boots,
LookNevada bindings and
Beconta poles) is available for
purchase or rental, making
possible safer and more en-
joyable skiing on Virginia and
Carolina slopes.

The store also features hand-
crafted local products, ac-
cording to Scott. Available will
be excellent stained glass,
leathercraft and woodcraft pro-
ducts. Local craftsmen are in-
vited to distribute goods
through the store on consign-
ment. An excellent assortment
of frisbees and boomerangs is
also stocked.

For years, one of the most
pleasurable and prestigious ac-
tivitees for W&L men has been
that of backpacking through the
scenic Appalachian Mountains
running so close to campus. The
backpacking man has always
been held in the highest regard
by members of the nearby
women’s colleges. But woe to
the student who arrived on cam-
pus without several years worth
of carefully accumulated equip-
ment: all plans for a_ spec-
tacular weekend would soon
disappear into thin air. Now,
there is a convenient alter-
native.

The End dies

On the vine

by Dick Barron

Last week I attempted to give
you a brief summary of the
more appealing films of the
summer. Now that fall is upon
us, we must endure the late ar-
rivals — those films which are
fresh from summer runs and
are just now chugging into Lex-
ington. One of those summer
leftovers is Burt Reynolds’ The
End. You could say that this
movie was a leftover when it
was put into the can.

Reynolds directs and stars in
this film about a man who is
rapidly dying from a rare
‘‘blood disease.’’ When
Reynolds is informed of his ill-
ness, we become quickly aware
that black comedy takes a
beating in this film. The jokes
come at a fast and furious pace,
but lines requiring tact are
delivered with the finesse of the
Titanic in ice-berg country.

There is a certain way of
delivering a throw-up joke —
it’s either crude or it’s funny.
Mel Brooks, for instance, is
masterful in being crude and
funny at the same time (anyone
who has seen Blazing Saddles
will understand). Unfortunate-
ly, Reynolds starts crude and
stays crude.

This boat is not altogether
sunk becamuse Dom DeLuise is
there to start bailing. Consider-
ing the material he has to work
with (as written by Jerry
Belsen), DeLuise gives a
masterful performance as the
schizoid mental hospital pa-
tient. The funniest moments
come when he argues and con-
verses with himself and his
alter-ego. These scenes give the
movie a few badly needed signs
of life.

Sally Field is as cute and sexy
as ever, but adds no real
substance to this thin story.
Maybe it really is true that less
is more, for it seems that the

 

most humorous moment in the
film was when Reynolds spots a
mental patient making
beautifully screeching bird
sounds. Whoever that guy is,
he’s a comic genius.

Burt Reynolds has been the
creator of some excellent rip
roarin’ entertainment. Smokey
and the Bandit, although lack-
ing literary merit (who cares
anyway?) was an exciting bit of
Americana — the old let’s-beat-
the-system-and-come-away-
rich type of film that gives lots
of action and some gentle folksy
homor to liven things up.
Reynolds should stay away
from the demanding roles of
black comedy. He is too good at
what he does best. The End is
not altogether a bad film, but at
its worst, it makes Reynolds ap-
pear slightly foolish for getting
involved with such a limp pro-
ject.

Those who missed ABC’s Bat-
tlestar Galactica Sunday night
lost out on what could be called
the second coming of Star Wars.
Lorne Greene and a cast of
strange characters, gives us a
look at the world of intergalac-
tic space travel. It’s Star Trek
with a twist — the Galactica is
trying to find earth instead of
trying to find “‘strange new
worlds.”’

With outstanding special ef-
fects by John Dykstra (Star
Wars( it just can’t lose. The
premier episode has already
launche a long list of catch
phraes. So, one Sunday night, if
you feel like cutting through the
“felgercarb’’ of the other net-
works, instead of going out and
walking your ‘“‘daggit,’’ pause
for a “‘micron,’’ tune in ABC,
and let Lorne Greene take you
on a tour of that great
Ponderosa in the sky.

AN ENSEMBLE OF 16 students from the
University last week on a cultural-exchange mission, and gave a 90-minute performance of traditional
Chinese dances, music and other art forms on the terrace in front. of Lee Chapel. The event drew more than
400 spectators to the W&L front campus.

by John R. Risch

If you happened to be on
Washington and Lee’s front
campus last Thursday after-
noon, you may have found
yourself in a atmosphere much
like Central Park’s in New York
City. Professors, students, and
Lexington residents gathered
around the new terrace in front
of Lee Chapel for one of the
most vivid cultural per-
formances ever to come to
W&L. The Youth Good-Will Mis-
sion of The Republic of China
entertained their audience with
an hour and a half program con-
sisting of many Chinese art
forms including, song, music,
defense, dance and painting.

These Taiwanese students
are non-professional _ per-
formers whose college majors
range from Banking and In-
surance to Home Economics.
Under the direction of Dr. You-
Hsin Chien, Dean of Engineer-
ing at Tamkang College, these
students performed as a
gesture to reciprocate the ex-
hibition of the Reeves Chinese
Porcelain Collection in Taiwan
this past July.

first time ever in the Republic
of China. In return, The Youth
Good-Will Mission dicided they
would come to W&L and bring
to life many of the figures pic-
tured on the Chinese Export
Porcelain. Sponsored by a
television station in Taiwan,
these students will give 32 such
performances during their 50
day stay in the United States.

The talent of these students
was surpassed only by the fan-
fare of color generated by their
oriental costumes. Each section
of the program artistically
touched upon many traditions
of Chinese culture. The chorus
sang four traditional folksongs,
the most dynamic being ‘The
Plum Flower.” The plum
flower is the national flower of
the Republic of China.

Instrumentally these students
are quite accomplished using
unique Chinese instruments
such as: the bamboo flute, lute,
wood blocks, and butterfly
guitar. Their’ graceful
demonstration of Chinese Kung-
Fu and boxing, fully
characterized the quick thought
and skilled coordination
necessary to this form of com-
bat. The shouting one might
have heard during the
demonstration is a warning call
the attacker gives in order to
give his opponent a chance to
dodge his strike.

 

Datz offers
workshop

A workshop for acoustic
guitar will be offered to
students this fall. Major topics
to be covered include folk
styles, bluegrass _ styles,
reading of tablature, music
theory, and flat-picking techni-
ques. Meetings will be held
every Thursday at 8:00 in the
Mu Beta Psi room, located in
the Student Center below the
Cockpit.

The workshop will be con-
ducted by Burr Datz. He has
played bluegrass professionally
for five years, and has given
private lessons for the past six
years. For further details, con-
tact him in Evans Dining Hall,
or call ext. 236.

Chinese students perform

The most colorful segment of
the program was the “Chinese
Ribbon Dance.”’ They dance
around while waving foot-long
silk ribbons through the air
creating the effect of brilliant
clouds. Much time a practice is
spent in learning this art.

The “‘Lion Dance” is a dance
that all Chinese men must
learn. The lion requires two
men to control it, one controll-
ing the colorful lion head while
the other controls the rear. The
“Lion Dance” is quite similar to
the well-known ‘Dragon
Dance”’ which requires 50 men
to perform. Both dances are
performed during Chinese New
Year celebrations and at
special religious ceremonies.
These dances also serve as a
method of training for Kung-Fu.

‘Also included in this program

was a demonstration of Chinese
Brush Painting. One of the
female students painted a
branch of plum blossoms in only
five minutes, an art that takes
several years to accomplish.

The painting was presented to
Dean Watt as a gift to W&L. The
program was brought to a close
as the group sang and danced to
three traditional American
songs: ‘‘Oh Susanna,’’ ‘‘As the
Saints Go Marching In’’ and
“T’d Like to Teach the World to
Sing,’’ as an effort to express
the unity and friendship which
is sought by both nations.

After the performance a
reception was held at the Alum-
ni House where all ‘ were
welcome. Since all the sutdents
could speak fluent English,
there were no communication
problems. Dean Watt and Mr.
Whitehead presented each stu-
dent with a special gift and a
souvenir booklet of W&L.

Special thanks must be given
to Professor I-Hsiung Ju, artist-
in-residence, for making this
cultural exchange possible.
Professor Ju, a native of China,
has worked hard in broadening
East Asian studies at W&L and
in trying to closen the ties be-
tween the W&L community and
the fascinating culture of his
homeland. Hopefully, W&L will
again be honored with similar
cultural exchanges in the
future.

The Kuhne exhibit, on view from Sept. 18 through Oct. 6 in duPont Hall on the W&L campus, is the first
exhibit in a visiting artist series which has been organized in cooperation with Dr. and Mrs. Jacob Weins-

tein.

Dr. and Mrs. Weinstein, who own Jacobs Ladder Gallery in Washington, D.C., and are parents of a W&L
alumnus, have worked closely with the Department of Fine Arts in contacting artists for the new series. Dr.
and Mrs. Weinstein have been friends of the university and its art programs for several years, and have
recently established a fund to enable W&L students to study with practicing artists.

During the first week of the exhibit in the duPont Gallery, Kuhne will visit with W&L art students and
conduct discussions in university art classes.

The public is encouraged to attend the reception Friday, which will take place from 7 to 9 p.m.

 

 

Eye And Ear:
Som The Bookstore

Why did the textbooks cost so
much this year? We, of the
Bookstore staff, were braced
for the shock which we knew
was coming at book rush. (We
even considered having smell-
ing salts, brandy and other
restoratives at hand for severe
cases.) As we unpacked and
shelved textbooks by the
truckload this summer, it
became strobe-light clear that
the prices had jumped in giant
leaps.

The economies of the tex-
tbook business are complex and
baffling even to those who sell
them. First off, the Bookstore,
which is owned and operated by
the University, is not a get-rich
operation. It is an essential part
of the academic process, yet it
must be self-sustaining. It must
pay such overhead costs as
salaries, shipping, phone, etc.,
etc. The publishers of textbooks
set a ‘recommended selling
price” for each book and, ex-
cept for some paperbacks, we
pay 80% of the recommended
price PLUS the freight charges
to get those heavy tomes to Lex-
ington, Va., from New Jersey,
Illinois, Minnesota, or Califor-
nia. The textbooks at W&L are
always marked at that recom-
mended price; hauling costs
are never added on.

Next question: who is making
the profit when the same book
goes up a dollar or two in less
than a year? We _ textbook
managers are apt to feel that
the publishers have all the
gravy. However, they certainly
spend time, money and the
charm of lots of simple or
elaborate charts to show that
they are hurting as much as the
poor student. Yet it has been
pointed out (by textbook
managers, of course!) that the
stock of publishing houses runs
ahead of the market on The
New York Stock Exchange: a
good investment.

And what of the faculty which
is the third leg of this sky-
roketing stool? Their role is
simple. They choose the books
which the store will order and
the publisher will ship. The
faculty’s primary concern is, of
course, academic excellence
but many of them do keep a
wary eye on the ballooning
prices.

Next spring the Bookstore
will institute a full-fledged used-
book program. And it is here
that the faculty will play a key
role, by deciding early in May
what books they will use in the
fall of 1979. This will give the
students an opportunity to sell
back to The Bookstore books
which are in good condition. So
the students, in their own self-
interest, should treat those ex-
pensive texts with respect. The
economically wise student will
not use his textbooks to jack up
a flat tire and will hold back on
the gaudy underlining.

WLUR

Beginning this Sunday night
at 10, and continuing every
week throughout the fall term,
WLUR-FM will present a one
hour rock concert. The fall con-
cert series will include live per-
formances by the Who, Bruce
Springsteen, the Electric Light
Orchestra, Peter Gabriel, and
many others. Program Director
Mark Mainwaring indicated
that the tapes to be used came
from a variety of sources, but
emphasized that ‘‘they’re not
the usual live albums available
in any record store. We’ve got a
lot of different material, and
almost all of it is commercially
unavailable.’’ This Sunday’s
concert will feature Elton John,
recorded live at the Montreal
Forum in 1974. WLUR may be
found at 91.5 on the FM dial.

Crafty Hands
Happy the Man
Arista AB 4191

Who are these guys? Sure, the
names are easy enough—
Stanley Whitaker, Frank
Wyatt, Kit Watkins, Rick Ken-
nell, and Ron Riddle. But who
are they? What bands have they
played with? Where do they
come from? I can’t answer any
of these, but I do know who this
band sounds like. Take three
parts Genesis, two parts ELP,
one part each of Jeff Beck and
Jan Hammer, season lightly
with Rick Wakeman and Yes,
and PRESTO—Happy the Man.
First the good news: it’s not
quite as derivative as it seems it
might be. Unfortunately, on
their new album these guys pro-
vide a perfect example of that
which the above mentioned ar-
tists (with the exception of Jeff
Beck) have been accused of
producing for years; namely,
the type of pretentious,
ponderous music that promises
all and delivers nothing.

“THE CHEAP DETECTIVE 53

 

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

It’s a pity, because the band’s
first LP, while showing all the
above influences, demonstrated
a fair amount of instrumental
virtuosity and melodic innova-
tion. The instrumental talent is
still there on the second record;
the songs aren’t. With one or
two exceptions, the tracks on
Crafty Hands just don’t go
anywhere. It all makes for very
nice background music, but not
the kind of stuff worth going out
and spending six bucks on.

MM
Who Are You
The Who
MCA - 3050

First, the review in a nut-
shell: the Who are back with a
vengence. Now the qualifier:
anyone expecting the raw
power of “My Generation” or
Quadrophenia’s ‘“‘The Real Me”’
is gonna be disappointed in Who
Are You. See, it’s just not that
kind of record.

If you reveled in the majesty
of Tommy, or the more subdued
power of Who’s Next, however,
your ship’s just come in. Among
other things, Who Are You
marks the return of the syn-
thesizer as a significant force in
the Who’s music (and it was the
synthesizer that created much
of the tension and joy of Who’s
Next). My associate Robin
Meredith maintains that Pete
Townsend is the only man in the
world who should be allowed to
touch a synthesizer. I don’t

agree, but must admit that Who
Are You tends to support his
claim. Maybe it’s a _ coin-
cidence, but three of the
album’s best songs are ones in
which Townsend uses the in-
strument to create a particular
feeling. In “New Song,” the
synthesizer lurks in the rhythm
section, accentuating the drums
and helping to set the pace.
“Sister Disco’’ finds the instru-
ment being used for both
rhythm and melody—the latter
primarily taking the form of
brief passages to move things
along after Roger Daltrey’s
slower vocal breaks. And last
but not least, the title track’s a
killer, in which a quick syn-
thesizer and acoustic guitar
break culminate in a strong
finish to bring back memories
of the classic ‘‘Won’t Get Fooled
Again’’. It’s not that good, but
the feel is similar. Add that to a
couple of tunes—expecially
“Guitar and Pen’’) which are
throwbacks to the old Tommy
days, and this LP is a winner for
even the marginal Who fan.
Who Are You was well worth
the wait.

Miscellaneous Notes: On the
local concert scene, Bob Seger
will perform at the Roanoke
Civic Center on Wednesday,
Sept. 27 at 8:00 p.m. Toby Beau
will open the show. Seger used
to be Detroit’s best-kept secret,
a rocker with a_ fanatic
hometown following but virtual-
ly unknown on the national
level. He finally hit it big, of
course, with the double
platinum Night Moves, and
hasn’t looked back since.

RING-TUM PHI

  

Franke—from

mats to courts?

by Ray McNulty
In June 1978 Gary Franke,
W&L’s head wrestling coach,
’ was named head coach of the
W&L tennis team. Franke, a
1971 graduate of Mankato State
(Minnesota), is starting his
sixth year at W&L. His wrestl-
ing teams have won ODAC
championships the past two
seasons and Franke was named
the ODAC,s Wrestling Coach of

the Year. .

The new tennis coach is mov-
ing into a program which has
also been successful in the past.
Both the 1976-77 and the 1977-78
W&L tennis Generals finished
second nationally in the Divi-
sion III national tournament.
The former W&L tennis coach,
Dennis Bussard, resigned after

_ the 1978 season to accept:a posi-
tion with Babson College in
Massachusetts.

Coach Franke will have a
strong nucleus of returning let-
termen to build his team
around. Stewart Jackson, a
junior, was an All-American
last year and is the captain of
this year’s squad. Juniors Dave
Constine and Pat Norris were
both voted to the All-Conference
team and will join Jackson on
the 1978-79 team.

The major question is, ‘‘Can a
wrestling coach, who never
played tennis co etitively in
high school or college, take over
as head coach of a team that
finished second in the Division
III national tournament and
continue its winning tradition?”’
It is the opinion of this sport-
swriter that he can. After obser-
ving his tennis physical educa-
tion class, I was greatly im-
pressed with Coach Franke’s
knowledge of the sport. He ap-
peared to know a great deal
about tennis strategy, the
mechanics of the game and he

also has made himself very
familiar with the tennis

rulebook. I think Coach
Franke,s biggest asset is his
ability to establish a good rap-
port with his athletes. I have
spoke to a few of Franke’s
wrestlers and they had nothing
but good things to say about
their coach.

I asked Coach Franke how he
had improved his familiarity
with the game of tennis since
his appointment as head coach.
He said that he had done some
reading over the summer on the
mechanics of the sport, but
most of his knowledge came
from a friend who once coached
at the University of Minnesota.
Franke said he and his friend,

_ who was a Davis Cup member,

discussed the various areas of
the game, including the

physical and emotional aspects .

of tennis.

The tennis team opens its fall
schedule this weekend and I
think it will be interesting to see
how the team reacts to its new
head coach. I believe that
Coach Franke will do a com-

mendable job and the tennis -

team will be successful again
this year. .

Soccer team downed 3-0;

W&L goes 0-2 after Davidson

game — Centre Sat.

by Bill Whalen

The W&L Generals kicked off
the home portion of their 1978
season by meeting the Davidson
Wildcats last Saturday at
Wilson Field. The Generals,
bidding for their first victory of
the season, ended up on the
short side with a 34-7 decision.

Davidson started slowly as
they ran into a_ tenacious
General’s defense. W&L got the
first break of the game when
Davidson, attempting to punt,
mishandled the snap and turned
the ball over on their own 24.
The General’s offense was
unable to move the ball and
Randy Austin’s 39 yard field
goal attempt was blocked.
Davidson took over on their own

20 and proceeded to score their
first touchdown on a seven-
play, 80-yard drive. The score
came on a 45-yard pass from Al
Rhyne to Craig Pyles. Davidson
led 7-0 with five minutes left in
the first quarter.

In the second quarter W&L
drove deep into Davidson ter-
ritory but once again had to set-
tle for a field goal attempt by
Randy Austin, whose 25 yard at-
tempt missed to the right.
Davidson took over and seemed
to be ready to score again but on
a 4th and 1 from the W&L 16,
fullback Bill Johnson was stop-
ped short of a first down. The
Generals now appeared to have
control of the game, until Syd

Farrar’s 41 yd. punt was return-

day against Swarthmore, one of
the top Division III teams in the
nation, and ended up losing by

Cross country
season opens

by Greg Branan

The Cross-Country season
opens this Saturday with a
match against Davis and Elkins
on the opponent’s turf.

In the words of Coach Dick
Miller, “‘It’s going to be tough to
repeat'a 10-5 season.” That win-
loss record was compiled by
last years harriers and was the
most wins for any Cross- Coun-
try team here at Washington
and Lee, yet only managing a
fourth place finish in the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference.
Two of last year’s top five
runners, Alan Weeks and Bill

Welch were lost to graduation.

The top two returnees, and this
year’s co-captains, are Rich
Bird and Bob Bates. Brian
Adams, the only other returning
letterman, is recovering from
an illness and is expected to run
as soon as possible. Another of
last year’s front five, Chris
Daniel, is presently playing soc-
(continued on page 7)

unveil Saturday against the
Valley United Soccer Club of
Roanoke in -the Generals’ ex-
hibition match against this
amateur club. He feels that it
will be exciting and a ‘‘nice
game to watch.”’ Game time is 2
‘p.m. at W&L’s Wilson Field.
Washington and Lee has been
plagued by injuries to key

players during the pre-season, -

but the team hopes to be pulling
together in time for the match
Saturday. Coach Piranian felt

that his team showed “‘the abili- |

ty to play good soccer, but not
for ninety minutes’, as they
must keep up constant pressure
throughout the game. Hopeful-
ly, his new system will help to
alleviate this problem, as they

. will play a more aggressive and

exciting kind of game, putting
constant pressure on the ball,
and always looking to attack.
Coach Piranian says that W&L
“should be able to make better
use of our personnel’’ with his
changes.

In Valley United, the
Generals encounter a team they
have never beaten in six
previous exhibitions. Co-
captains Bill Stone and Roger

Yale, both seniors, will have to
rally their young team to
muster a strong effort for this
game, which is the final tuneup
before the tough part of the
schedule, including the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
games, is upon them. The
teams they have to worry about
this season are Lynchburg and
Eastern Mennonite among their
conference opponents, and
Elizabethtown from out of
state. There are a few games
which the Generals should have
no trouble readying themselves
for, as there exists ‘“‘bad blood”’,
as coach Piranian put it, bet-
ween W&L and Hampden-
Sydney, VPI, James Madison
and Roanoke College.

Looking ahead at _ the
schedule a bit, the Generals
travel to Averett College on
September 27, to Eastern Men-
nonite College on the 30th, and
to Hampden-Sydney on October
4. Their first regular season
home game isn’t until October 7
against Elizabethtown College,
and by then the soccer team
should know where it is headed
and how well Piranian’s system
works.

ed 53 yds. by Davidson’s John
Porter for the Wildcat’s 2nd TD.
Davidson now led 14-0 with 4:33
left in the half. The Generals
held off one last Davidson drive
when cornerback Jack Norberg
picked off Rhyne’s pass at the
W&L 23.

It was not until with 11:49 left
in the 3rd quarter that W&L
began their lone scoring drive.
With the ball on the W&L 29,
tailback Stewart Atkinson car-
ried down to the Davidson 19; a
run good for 52 yards. QB Scott
Swope then threw to Richard
Wiles at the 10 and Jim Palermo
carried the ball to the Davidson
2. Stewart Atkinson’s 1 yard
plunge gave W&L their only
score of the day. With 9:45 left
in the 3rd quarter it was David-
son 14, W&L 7.

On their next possession
Davidson drove to the W&L
eight. However, on a 3rd and
seven from the 8, Alvin Atkin-
son fumbled the ball giving the
Generals possession -on their
own six. Once again, the
Generals looked like they were
in control but the offense stalled
out and punted away, giving
Davidson the ball on their own
48. Craig Pyles 13 yd. run put
the ball on the W&L 30 and on
the next play Rhyne hooked up
with Atkinson for a 30 yd. TD
pass. It was now Davidson 21-
W&L 7 with 14:27 left in the 4th
quarter.

From here on it was all
Davidson. The Wildcats, in
their ‘‘wing-T”’ offense, ran six
rushing plays to go 71 yds. The
big play was Bill Johnson’s 37
yd. run for the score. It was now
Davidson 25-W&L 7 with 10:55
left in the game.

With: the outcome all but
decided, Davidson and W&L
substituted freely. Davidson
went 68 yds. on 8 plays for their
final score, with QB Dan Whit- '
myer scoring on a3 yd. run. The
PAT failed and the final score
was Davidson 34, W&L 7.

After only two games, the:
Generals must regroup. They
have lost both games badly.
Still, their mood is optimistic.

' According to Coach Gary

Fallon, ‘‘The players are still
enthusiastic, and there’s been
no talk of packing it in. Against
both Davidson and Madison we
faced teams with unusual size
and depth. We’ve_ been

. Substituting a lot and trying

players at new positions. In
both games we’ve- simply been

worn down through 4 quarters.’’

The Generals have been
outscored 83-14 in two games.
More importantly, they have
been outscored 55-7 in the se-
cond half, 41-0 in the 4th
quarter. Take away the 4th -
quarters of both games and the
scores would be 28-7 and 14-7.

The bright spots for the
Generals had to be the running
of Stewart Atkinson and the
defensive stands. The defense
stopped Davidson 4 times
within the W&L 30 and caused
the Wildcats to fumble ’8 times.
W&L recovered 5 fumbles‘gnd
made 1 interception. Atkinson
ran 14 times for 84 yards and 1
touchdown. He is now only 128
yds. from tying Randy Broyles’

meet. That home meet is to be

Tennis begins «

by John Winans

In June of this year, Gary
Franke was named head tennis
coach of the Generals. The 1971
graduate of: Mankato State in
Minnesota has coached W&L’s
wrestling team for five years
with a great deal of success. He
was named 0.D.A.C. Coach of
the Year in 1977 for his superior
job during the 1976-77 season.
‘But these days Coach Franke’s
thoughts are running to tennis.

On September 22 the Generals
will travel to Annapolis, Md. to
participate in the Navy Fall In-
vitational. In this tourney and
the one at James Madison the
following week, Coach Franke
will be looking at the in-
dividuals and getting an idea on
player ranking for the coming
spring season. The fall tennis
season will conclude here in
Lexington on October 13-14 with
the Second Annual W&L Fall In-
vitational. The Generals will
have their hands full as
Maryland, Ohio, and Virginia
will all be present for what is
shaping up to be an exciting
Homecoming weekend tourney.

The squad has been practic-
ing now for two weeks and
Coach Franke is optimistic

about this year’s netmen:
Returnees, such as_ All-
American Stewart Jackson, are
not the only reason for his ex-
citement. Two or three top
freshmen will play a key roll in
the coming season. Gary is a
firm believer in physical condi-
tioning, so the tennis team has
been doing a lot to keep in
shape. The combination of
great tennis ability found in let-
termen as well as freshmen

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Fancy Dress:
the heat is on...

It’s time for a small reminder: The fate of the big-
gest social event at Washington and Lee is to be decid-
ed next Thursday.

For many years, several university officials have
bemoaned the cut classes and snoring students that
are a part of Fancy Dress Weekend. Last year,
enough of them served on the University Council to
make this recommendation:

The following motion has been submitted by two University
Council members for consideration at this meeting:

In order

(I) tore-establish a revered tradition,

(II) to allow students and others fully to prepare for and to enjoy
the variety of activities collectively denominated “Fancy Dress
Weekend,”’ without the distractions of classes and classwork,

(III) to allow students and others fully to prepare for and to enjoy
the variety of activities collectively denominated ‘‘School,”
without the distractions of parties and party-work,

(IV) To permit Fancy Dress events to occur on or near their
natural date, viz., Valentine’s Day,

(V) to boost the local economy while reducing student travel ex-
penditures, by inducing more people to remain in Lexington during
at least part of the winter break, and

(VI) to nurse back to health that casualty of overemphasis on
social life—an atmosphere of intellectual excellence.

Be it resolved that the various parts of “‘Fancy Dress Weekend”’
occur only during the ‘‘Washington Holiday.”

Embarrasingly cute for a student—faculty commit-
tee? Certainly. But it’s no joke; this motion will be
voted on next Thursday, September 28, at 4:30 p.m. If
passed, the motion will delight die-hard academicians
on two counts: stripping away the appeal of W&L’s
biggest party weekend, and making the most mileage
out of another hated gift to the students—the
Washington Holiday.

One should note that the membership of the U.C.
changes regularly, and some of the die-hard pro-
ponents are gone. But this motion is still a live one,
and the meeting ought to be worth seeing. If the fate
of Fancy Dress interests you, try to attend as the SAB
fights tosave a W&L tradition—academic or not.

(For those of you who really get inte committee-
room carnage, the Chi Psi case before the City Plann-
ing Commission is also scheduled for September 28 at
5 p.m. A pretty memorable double-feature...)

NOTICE

As mentioned last Spring, the
Executive Committee will be
requiring each of its standing
committees to present monthly
reports.

Briefly written reports must
be submitted and should in-
clude:

committee activities;

2) an up-to-date balanced
financial statement; and

3) a preview of activities in
the forthcoming month.

Each committee shall report
once a month as follows, until
Thanksgiving break.

cumstances the accused may be
given a period of time beyond
the normal 24 hours period
before the hearing. This amount
shall be subject to the approval
of the President of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. Upon
notification of the accused, he
will be informed of his rights.

office
hours

Beau Dudley, president of the
Student body, has announced
that he will be holding regular
weekly ‘‘office hours’’
throughout the year. For the
fail term, they are scheduled
for 9 a.m.-12 noon on
Thursdays. During this time,
Dudley will be available in the
E.C. room in the University
Center for any opinions, sugges-
tions, or complaints.

On those open

committee meetings...

Last Monday, the Executive Committee held its
opening meeting of the year. Before too long, they
were again immersed in debate over one of last year’s
hottest issues: whether student committees should be
made to open their meetings to the entire student
body.

The argument has been kicking around for years,
but for the record, it runs something like this. Student
committee positions (SAB, Contact, Cold Check) are
open for anyone interested in applying. The EC tries
to pick these people on the basis of expertise and/or
interest in the area. Once appointed, these committee
members feel (with some reason) that as long as they
are accessible to outside opinion, they ought to be
allowed to ‘‘get on with the job.” And it’s a fact of life
that the more “‘open’’ these meetings are, the greater
the tendency is to lose any shred of organization and
control. As one disenchanted chairman said last year,
‘We deserve, at least, the credit to make an in-
telligent decision that reflects student opinions.”’

It’s a nice way thought, anyway. We ought to have
some faith in the people we elect or appoint to office.
Unfortunately, there are always a few bad apples in
the bunch. A little late-night arm twisting, a little
fiscal irresponsibility— and pretty soon, the credibili-
ty of each student official is in question. It’s not sur-
prising that students want to drift into a meeting oc-
casionally and see how their thousands of dollars in
student fees are being spent.

So that’s the choice: more student body input vs.
the effective organization of each committee. Either
extreme would be foolish; this year’s EC appeared to
recognize that fact on Monday.

The EC vote revolved around the meetings of one
group: the Student Activities Board, which controls
the major slice of student funds each year. In the
past, the mere mention of open meetings has sent the
average committee chairman under an oxygen tent.
But for once, both groups were able to give enough
ground to make possible the final policy vote. Briefly
stated, the motion requires advance notice on campus
when any major expenditure or decision is to be
discussed by the SAB; that all meetings be open until
a vote is to be taken—and (a new point) that nothing
can be voted on unless discussed in the open session;
and finally, that the SAB will still be allowed to plan
its Fancy Dress themes in secret, as tradition
démands. Regarding Fancy Dress, student opinion
will be solicited beforehand, in ‘‘open idea sessions”’
for themes and decorations. |

This new system is a good one, and an encouraging
sign. We thank the SAB Co-Chairmen for opening
their meetings with so little resistance. In fact, one
hopes that all the other student committees will be as
co-operative. For only after students have the op-
portunity to see how the decisions are made, can
there be a greater faith in our student officials.

Parking At W&L—

Only The Strong Survive

The following feature was
written by Robert S. Keefe,
director of the W&L New Office
and disgruntled bureaucrat...

The keys to running a suc-
cessful college: plenty of football
for the alumni, sex for the
students, and parking for the
faculty.

—CLARK KERR,
when he was
President of UCLA

If you lack confidence in the
ingenuity and imagination and
inventiveness of college kids to-
day, take heart. So what if they
can’t tell a participle from a
patella, and maybe they do
think the multiplication tables
are located in the biology lab.
Lock horns and match wits with
them in the classroom if you
must, but keep out of their park-
ing lots.

It used to be, as recently as
the late 1960s, that Washington
and Lee’s students simply
crammed their cars behind the
gym in a jumble that would
send any self-respecting traffic
engineer to the pacemaker
dispensary. You’d leave your

keys in the ignition, so the peo-
ple whom you’d blocked might
move your car if they were out
of class sooner than you. Even if
you were accustomed to driving
a big American car, you quickly
learned to maneuver a VW or
an Opel, or else you went to the
Co-op for coffee for a few hours.

(The faculty, of course, in-
sists that only the faculty is
reduced to driving VWs and
Opels, that the students all own
block-long Oldsmobiles and
Bentleys, or if a small car, then
at least a Porsche or a Jaguar.
Jealousy is a_ relentless
mistress. )

That pattern endured until six

or eight years ago, with the new
construction on the gym. In due
course, with yet other con-
struction planned on the
campus, Washington and Lee
determined to provide new
parkings areas for its students,
and hired the best parking-lot
designers money could buy.
And lo, a new lot, probably the
most attractive in Virginia or
maybe the world, was opened
near Lee Chapel with ap-
propriate fanfare. It was
designed to accommodate

precisely 68 cars, the number

that had been displaced from
the old 100-by-200 lot where the
gym addition now stands.

The new lot was engineered
within an inch of its life. It has
nooks and crannies
everywhere, bowered with ex-
otic shrubs and trees imported
from all over the world —
everything to distinguish it in
the most emphatic way possible
from your garden-variety
shopping-center parking lot.
And it would hold exactly 68
cars.

The students scoffed at
Washington and Lee and its
high-powered consultants. Sixty
eight cars! Before anyone knew
what happened, they developed
their own pattern for parking an
average of 98 cars there, almost
half again as many as the ex-
perts thought they could. And

generally thev do it without

blocking anyone else. (The ar-
chitects who designed the lot,
GWSM Inc., imported all the
way from Pittsburgh, are still
astonished.) When a student oc-
casionally does block in
another, the victim is absolute-
ly sanguine about it, according
to Frank A. Parsons, who as
assistant to the Washington and
Lee president is in charge of
such things. It doesn’t happen
often, he says, but when it does,
the reaction isn’t one of hysteria
but rather ‘“‘Okay, so maybe I’ll
block you in tomorrow.”’

Not long ago, Washington and
Lee began still more construc-
tion, this time building a new

library. And that meant a whole
lot of faculty parking had to be
eliminated.

Students are used to coping
with advertisty, but Doctors of
Philosphy are another species.
They shine in committee
meetings, but put them in a
real-life parking-lot crisis and
you ve got trouble with a capital
a:

So the university thought —
briefly — of changing the new
Lee Chapel lot from “B” to
‘A,” from upperclassmen to
faculty and staff. But even the
high-powered imported
parking-lot experts from Pitt-
sburgh had to admit defeat and
quash that silly notion. Displace

nearly a hundred students in
favor of 68 professors, and the
consequences would be
unimaginable and_ un-
controllable.

So the faculty lost. Students
now own and control the new
parking lot into which the
university frankly admits it
wouldn’t dare send its agents.
Professors park on side streets
halfway into the county or, if
they are smart, they walk to
school and boast about the exer-
cise they’re getting. Frank Par-
sons, the assistant to the presi-
dent, is one of the brave few
who still parks in the new lot —
but even he had to abandon his
Impala to his wife and
daughter, and buy a Rabbit for
himself, to get away with it.

sions separates the open “idea
sessions’ from the ‘‘decision
making process.” The motion
passed by a vote of 8-1.

Meetings to be posted

In discussing the need for
scheduled student committee
meetings to be posted in ad-
vance, Dudley said that ‘the
students are entitled to know
about all weekly and special

meetings.”
Jackson asked him about
rushed, ‘‘emergency’’

meetings, especially regarding
the short-notice situation when
booking bands.

“T think it’s just as dangerous
if a quote-unquote emergency
situation comes up, that you
take action and justify it later,”’
Dudley replied.

Following his logic, the E.C.
ruled that all meetings and
their agenda be posted ahead of
time ‘‘whenever possible’’ to
maximize student input.

Committee deficits

Grant Leister, business
manager of last year’s Calyx,
attributed the yearbook’s $2,275
loss to publishing costs and
“editorial irresponsibility.”

Although every deadline was
met, he said that the editor,
Temp Webber, had submitted

60 ‘,junk’’ pages, or pages the
editor knows will have to be
changed later. Each ‘‘junk”
page costs $10 to alter.

Leister said the publication
also paid $1,200 more ‘‘than ex-
pected” for color photography.

“This (the deficit) reflects
pretty badly on me, I think,”
the business manager told the
E.C.

Gray Coleman, editor of the
Ring-tum Phi, estimated that
last year,s newspaper lost
“about $1,400.’’ He attributed
the deficit to a ‘massive adver-
tising loss.”’

“Things look a whole lot bet-
ter for ads this year,’’ Coleman
assured the E.C. ‘‘The advertis-
ing staff is bigger than I’ve ever
seen it.”

Both the Calyx’s and Ring-
tum Phi’s debts were paid for
out of the Publications Board
reserve fund.

“We are going to start en-
couraging people to live within
their means,’, Dudley said.

The SAB’s $1,700 deficit from
last year was explained to be 2
result of checks written during
an “interim period” when the
original treasurer, Jim
Foreman, quit and the new
treasurer took over. The checks
written during that time were
never recorded, even though
one amounted to $1,600.

‘I don’t think we need to cry
too much longer over spilled
milk,” Dudley said. “‘We can

IFC hopes to change

noise ordinance

(continued trom page 1)
fraternity did not like the fact
that there was no. definite
agreement of cooperation from
the police. He advocated put-
ting ‘‘pressure on the townspeo-
ple’ by boycotting Lexington.
In response to his arguement,
Dean Murphy said that “‘if you
try to fight this pressure with
your own pressure, I think
you’re going to lose.”’

Dudley pointed out that
fraternity members are break-
ing the law as it now stands, and
should they try pressure tac-
tics, the police would only crack
down harder.

Reasons for the ‘‘crackdown”’

Dudley explained that the
reasons for the recent
crackdown on noise violations

are that “two things have
changed: parties have started
later’ and that ‘Kirby has
taken a different approach to
the problem than his
predecessors.”’

The fraternities are not yet
bound by the list of their conces-
sions to the town, so the IFC is
asking the fraternities to try
and keep the noise down after 11
p.m.

According to Davis, the police
were very cooperative this
weekend and there were no ar-
rests. He hopes that the situa-
tion will remain this way.

“Things are going well,”
Davis said. ‘‘No problems have
interferred with an agreement
being reached between the
police and the students.”’

 

Mainstream

(continued from page 5)

One week and a day after the
Seger show, the Doobie
Brothers will take the stage,
once again at the Roanoke Civic
Center. The band played
Roanoke about this time last
year and put on an excellent
show — far better than I ex-
pected. There’s more to the

 

Doobies than the singles and
commercial rock you hear on
the radio. Opening act is UFO.

One final note, for diehard
Jethro Tull fans only. Ian
Anderson and friends will ap-
pear at the Hampton Coliseum
on Sunday, Oct. 1, along with
power rockers Uriah Heep. It’s
a long drive, but if you believe
the sun rises and sets on Pas-
sion Play, the trip should be
worth it.

Other business

In other action at Monday
night’s E.C. meeting, both the
E.C. and the SAB declined to
contribute to the Student Bar
Association’s (SBA) function
Oct. 7.

The SBA has hired a band to
perform at the Pavillion for the
purpose of building better rela-
tions between W&L’s
undergraduate and law schools.
They hoped that either the E.C.
or the SAB would supply beer.

I’m not so sure the E.C.
should get into the SAB's
business of providing entertain-
ment,’’ Dudley said. ‘I don't
think the E.C. should subsidize
parties,’’ the student body

president continued.

The E.C. voted 5-4 in favor of
a motion “‘not to contribute to
the SBA function on the 7th.”

Hank Hall said that the SBA’s
plans ‘‘came up all of a sudden”
and fell too close to Homecom-
ing weekend for the SAB to act.
He noted that the SAB was
already planning a beer party
Oct. 13, before the scheduled
concert ‘“‘to give people a
chance to get inebriated.”’

The SAB also declined to help
finance the SBA’s party.

In the controversy of last spr-

quished all responsibility for
the student newspaper. It con-
tinued to be published on a

They must both have at least
sophomore standing.

Student committee budgets
