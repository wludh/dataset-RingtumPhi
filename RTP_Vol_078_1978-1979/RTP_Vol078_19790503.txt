Awards Presented

Waller T. Dudley, president
of the student body, was
presented the Frank J. Gilliam
award for recognized service to
Washington and Lee and the
student body by William Watt,
Dean of the College, at Tuesday
night’s senior banquet.

The award, given annually
since 1963, is named in honor of
Frank J. Gilliam, who was
Dean of Students here for may
years.

The recipient of the award is

given $100 and is allowed to
designate $150 to go to a campus
organization. The money is pro-
vided by the Student Body
Fund. The recipient is selected
by the undergraduate members
of the Executive Committee,
who choose him from nomina-
tions submitted by the student
body.
Dudley, a third year law stu-
dent from Alexandria, Virginia,
has held many honors druing
his undergraduate and law
years at W&L.

As an undergraduate, Dudley
was secreatry of the 1972 Mock
Convention, a member of the
Dance Board for three years,
and president for two years of
Phi Kappa Sigma social frater-
nity.

Dudley is a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional honorary leadership
fraternity, and was listed in
Who’s Who in American Col-
leges and Universities.

As a law student, Dudley was
one of two first place finishers
in the Burks Moot Court Com-
petiton, captain of the National
Moot Court Team for the Law
School in 1977-1978, and a
member of the team which won

Firefall, the six-member

Members of the Student Ac-

tivities Board held several
Jemergency meetings this week
to discuss a complicated and
demanding contract rider, or
list of demands, attached to
Firefall’s contract.

Between Firefall’s extreme
demands and Assistant Athletic
Director Dick Miller’s stubborn
rules it seemed that there was
no common ground.

But at last report, Firefall has
compromised some of their
demands, and the concert is
ischeduled to go on at 8:00 p.m.

IFC Drafts Proposal

in Marathon Session

by John Billmyre

The Interfraternity Council
adopted a proposal in response
to the faculty proposal limiting
parties, and passed a by-law
preventing freshmen from
pledging before the fourth rush
date, during a two-hour meeting

Tuesday night.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee will review the proposal to-
day and the faculty will act
upon it Monday. The pledging
change will be enacted next fall.

Both decisions were reached
only after long discussion, IFC
President Syd Farrar had to
call the meeting to order on
several occassions.

Much debate centered around
the definition of ‘‘House Par-
ties’’ and the efficacy of the pro-
posal in limiting parties.

The proposal defines house
parties as ‘‘any function funded
by treasury or billed to the
members on a deferred basis.”’
Included are funded functions
on and off the campus.

The proposal, however, does
not prohibit individuals from
gathering and holding a social
event.

“This proposal will allow all
the individuals to have all the
parties they want as long as

they chip in,’’ according to Syd

Farrar.

David E. Constine III, of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, argued
that the proposal was only an
attempt to postpone the in-
evitable.

“We are just buying time, the
faculty will compromise and
compromise until they get
disgusted with weeknight par-
ties; they can end them,”
argued Constine.

But Syd Farrar argued, “If
we change and the problem re-
mains, then the faculty cannot
nail the fraternities.”’

Mac Kennedy of Beta Theta
Pi saw problems with enforce-
ment of the proposal, should it
be adopted.

“It just contains too many
loopholes,’’ Kennedy said dur-
ing one of the more heated
moments of discussion.

Seldon Clarke of Beta also
talked about loopholes,
“Everyone is going to con-
tribute money, and there will
not be a difference in partying.”

Farrar disagreed because the
proposal ‘‘will place the burden
of the decision on the in--
dividual.’’ He added ‘‘because a
someone has not already paid
for the party, he won’t feel
tempted to go if he has to
study.”

When the vote was finally
taken, 14 representatives voted
in favor of the proposal, two

Dobbs Speech Highlights Senior Banquet

by David Greer

The senior banquet honoring
the class of 1979 was held in
Evans Dining Hall Tuesday
night.

The banquet, revived last
year by the Alumni Association,
honored both the
undergraduate and law school
seniors.

At the banquet the Frank J.
Gilliam award was given to
Beau Dudley, Student Body
President, in recognition of his
service to Washington and Lee
and the student body. The
Ring-tum Phi awards were also
given.

“As you go forth in the
world,’’ said Dobbs, ‘“‘you have
an opportunity to change the at-
titiudes that others have about
ourUniversity.”

Dobbs spoke of
characteristics of W&L that set
it apart from most schools. He
told of how Dr. William Hinton,
who lay dying in Lexington last
January, spoke to Dobbs and
made reference to his ex-
periences with him during
Dobbs’ undergraduate years
here. ‘‘Any organization that
can engender this brand of
loyalty and devotion in the wan-
ing moments of a man’s life has

“They accuse our graduates of being

elitist and thus suspect.”

 

Dr. Gary H. Dobbs, assistant
professor of biology at W&L, ad-
dressed the group, telling the
seniors, ‘‘When you leave this
University, it is my sincere
hope that the mark this univer-
sity made on you was a good
one.”’

Dobbs, who was a student
here from 1966 to 1970, related
experiences he had after
graduating and how his days at

something good, something
clean, and something warm
about it,’’ said Dobbs.

“You are The hope for the
future; the reaffirmation of the
goals and aspirations of this
University,’ Dobbs told the
seniors.

Speaking of the responsibilty
each alumni has for preserving
and spreading the school’s
reputation, Dobbs said, ‘Each

cuse our graduates of being
elitist and therefore somehow
different and thus suspect.”’

 

(It) has something good, something clean,
and something warm about it.”’

-Dr. Gary H. Dobbs on W&L

 

W&L prepared him for those ex-
periences.

Speaking on his graduate
work at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography at the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego,
Dobbs said he found his training
at W&L in such areas as honor
helped him and was noticed by
colleagues and_ professors.
However, Dobbs said he also
found that not all women are
suceptible to ‘‘that Southern
charm honed to a fine edge in
the Shenandoah Valley.’’ Dobbs
said that the training one
receives at W&L is different
from many people’s training
and that a graduate should be
proud of that difference and
used it to the advantage of
himself and others.

The Japan Foundation was
established in 1972 by the
Japanese government with the
objective of promoting interna-

mutual understanding between
Japan and the other nations of
the world.

The fellowship awarded to
Rogers is one of two types of
fellowships offered by The

faculty members, writers, and
artists — who are interested in
upgrading their skills or adding
a new dimension to their profes-
sional capabilities. The reci-

training and experience in some
aspect of Japanese studies.

EC Receives University
Council Petitions

By David Greer

The Student Body Executive
Committee recieved petitions
for Monday’s University Coun-
cil elections.

Eight freshmen, no
sophomores, and two juniors
submitted petitions. There are
two positions for the sophomore
and junior classes and three for
the senior class.

Submitting petitions for the
sophomore representatives
were Bill Alfano, Scott Burr,
Jed Dunn, Ben Jarrett, Bryan
Kocen, Kelly Moles, Stephen T.
Nardo, and Andrew Trotter.

Jeff Bartlett and Marc Ot-
tinger submitted petitions for
the senior positions.

The EC voted that there be a
$7.50 spending limit for the can-
didates and that each may only
put up one banner and 15
posters. Rising sophmores are
restricted to advertising in the
dorms and Evans Dining Hall.

The elections will be held
Monday. Polls will be set up in
front of Newcomb Hall and in
the quad.

In other business, Jay
Blumberg and Burr Datz re-
quested $250 for T-shirts for
participants in the Ring-tum
Phi Road Race, a fund-rasing
project for MS.

Student Body President Beau
Dudley said, “We don’t do
things for charity very much.

It’s high time we did.” With
that, the EC voted to give the
project $200 for the T-shirts.

Grant Leister, business
manager of the Calyx, announc-
ed that the yearbooks are due to
be shipped between May 20 and
May 23. He said that there was a
very real possibility that the
Calyx could make a profit this
year.

Dudley announced that John
Fraser was elected senior law

representative for next year.

The University Theater sub-
mitted a petitions requesting
EC money to rent a dance mat
for $200 a month. Dudley ques-
tioned spending $200 for a
month and having no return,
and sophomore representative
Willie Mackie pointed out that
the petition was from a class
and not a campus organization.
Voting was tabled as there was
no representaive present from
the theater.

Lowry Presents
Economics Articles

Two articles on economics by
Dr. S. Todd Lowry, professor of
economics and aministration at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, are included in two major
economics journals,

Dr. Lowry’s article, ‘‘Recent
Literature on Ancient Greek
Economic Thought,” appears in
the Journal of Economic
Literature, a 27,000-circulation
publication of the American
Economic Association.

His article is a survey and
analysis of the post-World War
II literature, reappraising the
significance of ancient con-
tributions to economic theory,

Dr. Lowry said.

The second article, ‘“‘A
Nightmare in Introductory
Economics,” appears in the
Journal of Economics Issues,
published by Michigan State
University’s economics depart-
ment and research division.
The article is a humorous
dialogue on a technical aspect
of price theory.

Dr. Lowry, who holds a law
degree as well as the Ph.D. in
economics, was educated at the
University of Texas and Loui-
siana State University. He join-
ed the Washington and Lee
faculty in 1959.

Honor Code Supported
In Ring-tum Phi Poll

by David Greer

Most students at Washington
and Lee feel that the Honor code
is effective, a recent poll taken
the Ring-tum Phi shows.

According to the poll, 80 per-
cent of the students in the
freshman, sophomore, and
junior class who responded to
‘he poll agreed that the honor
rode is effective at W&L.

Eleven percent disagreed
with the effectiveness of the
ronor code and eight percent
1ad no opinion.

At the same time, though, 66
ryercent of the respondents said
hat they would like to see the
1onor code more effective.

When asked, ‘‘According to
she White Book, does the honor

pus?’’ 68 percent of the students
polled answered ‘‘yes.” Eigh-
teen percent had no opinion.

The White Book specifies that
the honor code applies
throughout Rockbridge County
and wherever a_ student
represents himself as a
Washington and Lee student.

When the responses were
broken down by class, the
knowlege of this point in the
White Book decreased with age,
that is, more freshmen than
juniors answered correctly.

The students polled felt that a
student should be responsible to
the Honor Code when intox-
icated (on drugs or alchohol).
Eighty-four percent agreed on
this while eight percent

disagreed.

Of the respondents, 40 percent
said they had known of an honor
code violation that was never
reported. The junior class,
which had the strongest sup-
portive responses about the
code’s effectiveness and pursuit
of violators who commited their
crimes while under the _ in-
fluence, had the highest rate of
knowlege of honor violations.
The Executive Committee
recently voted down a proposal
that would make not turning in
a violation a violation in itself.

Most students polled wnat to
keep honor trials closed to the
public. Seventy-five percent of
the respondents answered ‘‘no”’
te the question, “Should all
honor trials be open and
public?”

The present system opens to
the public only appealed trials,
and there has not been an open
honor trial here for many years.

The Deer Hunter: Racism or Reality?

by Dick Barron

By now, The Deer Hunter has
become a common conversa-
tion topic everywhere. It’s a
wonder anybody goes to see it,
since someone invariably men-
tions the extreme gore or ex-
cessive length of some scenes.
But it did win an Oscar for best
picture, and there is some
credibility in that award. Still,
there are several important
criticisms of the film which
need to be answered.

Jane Fonda (not having seen
the film) joined others in a
strong blast of the film’s
“racist’’ content saying, in ef-
fect,The Deer Hunter depicted
the Vietnamese as_ sadistic
gooks with no more respect for
life than the lowest animals.

Maybe there is some validity in
the critics’ charge — The Deer
Hunterpresented the Viet-
namese in stereotyped roles.
Those who oppose the entire
film, however, miss the point
entirely. Yes, the Vietnamese
are depicted in a biased, over-
simplified way, but The Deer
Hunter was not ever intended
to be a sociological profile. If
anything close to that, the film
was more concerned with the
sociology of those Pennsylvania
steel workers which occupy the
majority of the film, that is, if
the producers ever intended
this to be a sociological profile
in the first place.

Like many other works of fic-
tion, The Deer Hunter uses
significant events — times of

chaotic social social change
combined with strong family
traditions As backdrops for the
action of the main characters.
These stereotypes provide in-
teresting and easily identifiable
circumstances againt which we
can observe full character
development. To malign The
Deer Hunter for using
stereotypes or ‘‘racism’’ would
be to dismiss many great films
or works of fiction for being too
simplistic in their depiction of
reality.

The director and all the ac-
tors involved with The Deer
Hunter have created a film tru-
ly deserving of ‘best picture’
status. The lengthy wedding
scene, prior to the Vietnam se-
quences, is justifiable. The in-

Entertainment
Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring
Robin Meredith

This column’s last review of
the country’s top singles was
overwhelmingly positive—so
much so, in fact, that we decid-
ed to try it again. Back by
popular demand (?), Musical
Mainstream’s thoughts on the
current top ten (minus
“Tragedy and ‘I Will Sur-
vive’, which were reviewed
last time).

“Music Box Dancer’’—Frank
Mills—This one was pleasant

enough on first listen. Un-
fortunately, it was barely
tolerable the second time

around, and I found myself
scrambling for the OFF button
the third time I heard it. Cute
instrumentals seem to make it
big every couple of years
(witness ‘‘Nadia’s Theme”
back in ‘76), soaring to the top
of the charts and usually fading

  

even faster. ‘‘Music Box
Dancer”’ is no exception, save
perhaps that it gets old faster
than most. More irritating than
fingernails on a blackboard.

“Knock on Wood’’—Ami
Stewart—You can’t help but
notice the rhythmie and
melodic similarities to the Bee
Gees’ “Tragedy” (not to men-
tion the production), and
“Knock on Wood’ suffers
somewhat by comparison. Ami
Stewart’s rather weak vocals
are almost overcome by _ in-
teresting production and fine in-
strumentation...but not quite.
Without the phrasing and emo-
tion that, say, Donna Summer
could have put into the song,
“Knock On Wood” ultimately
misses the mark. :

“Stumbling’ In’’—Suzi
Quatro and Chris Norman—
This can’t be the real Suzi

 

 

 

 

 

Rockbridge Viewed, a show at duPont Gallery features local sub-

jects,

Quatro. The hard-rocking
leather queen? Sang ‘Your
Mama Won't Like Me’’? I figure
RSO just hid the real Suzi away
long enough to create a low-
powered clone (ditto Eric Clap-
ton). Boring melody, lousy
vocals (Chris Norman seems
unable to carry a tune)—the
song’s just there. Bet your
mama’s gonna love her now,
though.

“Heart of Glass’’—Blondie—
Deborah Harry’s sexy, etherea!
vocals are easily the high point
of this gem. “Heart of Glass”
doesn’t bow] you over on first
listen, but it definitely grows on
you. A surprise AM success,
especially given the ‘‘dirty”
lyrics (apparently Chrysalis
has prepared a version without
the phrase ‘‘pain inthe ass’’).

‘| Want Your Love’’—Chic—
About all that can be said about
this one is that it’s not quite as
bad as ‘Le Freak’’. However,
what it lacks in lyrical banality
it very nearly makes up for with
one of the deadest ar-
rangements to hit the dance
floor in years. Disco songs
aren't supposed to look good on
paper; the responsibility for
dressing them up and giving
them a little life lies with the
producers and arrangers. a
task at which Bernard Edwards
and Nile Rodgers of Chie have
dismally failed. ‘Il Want Your
Love’ is probably one of the
biggest plodders of the year.

“Sultans of Swing’’—Dire
Straits—This is really kind of a
hard one to figure out. Aside
from the obvious fact that it has
absolutely nothing to recom-
mend it as a hit single, my feel-
ings totheir unnecessarily in-
tellectual lyrics and Mark
Knopfler’s Dylanesque vocals
clash from day one, to the point
of being just plain annoying. On
the other hand, Knopfler’s
guitar work is just ds
mesmeriziug as everyone's
been saying. In fact, it could
well be that some of his lines
(continued on page 11)

teraction here between the
characters is amazingly
natural, strikingly low-key, and
this makes the early parts of the
film important and enjoyable.
There is something happening
with these mediocre people that
makes us forget we’re watching
a movie.

We can’t forget the
cinematography which sets The
Deer Hunter far above its com-
petitors. Such depth and clarity
is rarely seen in films today.

The Deer Hunter is a bloody
film, and this makes it difficult
to watch. There are racial

stereotypes and simple presen-
tations of history which, for a
documentary, would be un-
forgivable. But The Deer
Hunter is not a documentary; it
is a film of great visual beauty,
presenting strong acting and a
potent story which are combin-
ed to give us one of the great
films of the seventies. It’s not
about Vietnam,. but about: peo-
ple caught in the Vietnam era
with all of its crazy fragmenta-
tion and misdirected energies.

Total

Total Theater is known as a
spring term tradition at
Washington and Lee. But even
tradition can change, and the 42
students in the Drama Depart-
ment course are taking part ina
new format for this traditional
activity.

Rather than offering one or
two major productions as in the
past, the class will develop
several ‘‘mini-productions’’ as
well as a full seript comedy pro-
duced by senior drama major
Phil Heldrich.

The mini-productions will in-
clude performances in film and
animation, ballet, improvisa-
tion, stage combat and voice,
which are studied in ‘‘mini-
courses’ during the first two
weeks of the course. During the
third and fourth weeks of the
term mini-courses in makeup,
lights and sound, clowning, and
silk screening will be added to
the ballet course. Students
choose the area they wish to
study during the two periods,
but drama professor Lee Kahn
says students gain exposure to
all the areas offered.

Kahn also said that the Total
Theater setup allows students
to work closely with one another
in small groups and as a class.

Effort

He said the situation develops a
‘company attitude, the best
attitude to have in a university
theater.’’

In response to remarks that
total theater is an easy way to
spend the spring, Kahn replies
that ‘there are general
misconceptions about the
course.’’ Although he flatly
states the course is not designed
to be difficult, he is quick to
demonstrate the amount of time
involved in the six credit
course. The class schedule
demands at least seven hours
each day Monday through Fri-
day and projects usually call for
additional time on weekends.
Do students have to put in this
much time? Kahn says ‘‘people
either work or they don’t and
they get the appropriate
grade.”’

If you want to see the results
of the group’s work, students
will perform ‘‘show and tells’’
of their specialties tomorrow
morning from 9:50 til 12:30
which are open to the public.
Later this month final produc-
tions will be staged, including
one-man shows and a series of
one-act plays written by
Washington and Lee student
James Leva.

 
     
 
  

 
Adcock Group Performs in
Cockpit Tonight

At 8:00 p.m. tonight, the
Cockpit and the UCC are proud
to announce that the highly
entertaining and energetic Ed-
die and Martha Adcock and II
Generation are returning to the
W&L campus for their last ap-
pearance of this school year,
and if you haven’t seen them
yet, you,ve really missed a lot!

The Second Generation was
formed in 1971 by Eddie, former
banjo player for the original
Country Gentlemen, along with
Martha Hearon (they were
married three years ago),
Johnny Castle, and Jeff Wisor.
For a few years, they toured in
California by themselves, as
well as renting their tremen-
dous sound system out to other
professional bands. This double
life became very tiresome and
eventually led to the break-up of
the band, somewhere near 1974.

Eddie and Martha continued to
play with one another (pun in-
tended) and concentrated on
albums instead of touring, and
their first albums demonstrated
their excellent blending of
voices and poignant  song-
writing abilities.

It was at this time that Eddie
devised an amplification
system for the banjo, an instru-
ment that posed problems as
far as accurate sound reproduc-
tion. He also began to fool
around a little bit on the electric
guitar, as he tells it, and the
music of II Generation opened
up. Big Johnny returned to play
electric bass, and the band
began to tour again. Eddie now
plays banjo and Telecaster

the show.

bluegrass performers. His
singing and style of banjo play-
ing have for years placed him at
the top of the list as far as pure
talent is concerned. Starting
with Mac Wiseman when he
was fourteen, even playing live
at WREL a few years in a row,
then founding the Country
Gentlemen in 1959, he establish-
ed himself as a_ professional
with a set idea of where his
music should go. Today, he is
satisfied with where it has gone
and where he is going. His
guitar playing is simply
phenomenal Picking with three
fingers of his right hand, mov-
ing everywhere on the neck
with his left, the notes flow from
the amplifier confidently,
whether he’s playing hard rock,
the blues or country riffs.

And finally’ by no means is
this band a strictly bluegrass
band! Rock and roll is a very
big part of their act, and if you
are an R & R fan’ stop by the
Cockpit tonight for their per-
formance.

Nighthawks

Return To

Lexington

Tickets for the Nighthawks
shows on May 15 are still on sale
at Evans Dining Hall from Burr
Datz. For students, prices are
as follows: $3.00 in advance,
$4.00 at the door and $5.00 in ad-
vance for both shows. For non
W&L students, prices are $4.00
in advance, $5.00 at the door.

The last time the Nighthawks
were in Lexington, they sold out
the second show. Their albums
have been well received
wherever they have been
played, and they have played
with all the great bluesmen of
the day. Their stage presence is
among the best in the business,
and they area group that should
not be missed, no matter what
the reason. They enjoyed play-
ing the Cockpit the last time
they were here, and called us up
to see if they could play here
again, so if you are a fan of
rockin’ blues, come out and lend
your support to the best white
blues band in the country. Only
250 tickets will be sold to both
shows, so get yours early.

Cye And Ear:
From he Bookstore

It is early spring of 1984. At
their recent meeting in
Alcapulco the Trustees of
Washington and Lee, after a
lengthy study of the coeduca-
tion question, have voted that
the University will ‘reaffirm
the unique character of
Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate divisions’’ and
will remain an all-male school.
The results of theRing Tum
Phi’s 37th poll of the student
body show that 30% of the
freshman, sophomore and
junior classes are opposed to co-
education by a margin of 51% to
49%. One student is quoted as
saying he wants to be able to
work without the distraction of
women’s presence, as he ex-
pects to do after he graduates.
He is hopeful of securing a posi-
tion in a_ newly-formed
monastery in Antartica.

On April 18, 1984 the Presi-
dent of the United States, invok-
ing the discretionary powers
granted him by the Congress,
orders stringent gas rationing.
The social, emotional and
physical impact of this direc-
tive is immediately and
dramatically apparent on the
Washington and Lee campus.
Within two days there are no
more bicycles for purchase
within a radius of 20 miles from
Lexington. The Virginia State
Police announce that one lane of
Interstate Route 81 will be
reserved for roller skaters and
bicyclers. Jogging, a pervasive
fad of the late 1970’s, is enjoying
a serious revival. A double
marathon is run every Satur-
day: Washington and Lee
students race 25 miles south and
Hollins women run 25 miles
north. The two groups meet in
Buchanan where several new

beer and disco joints do a
flourishing business. Mary
Baldwin College girls become
increasingly popular since
Staunton is only 30 level miles
away in contrast to the 45-50
miles of Blue Ridge Mountain
roads to Sweet Briar and
Randolph-Macon

Farm wagons, well padded
with hay, are the newest’ most
chic style of dating. They are
often equipped with extra plat-
‘forms for combos with battery-
powered amplifiers.
Rockbridge County officials
decide not to enact a noise or-
dinance as much of the
farmers’ income now comes
from the rental of horses and
wagons, plus an extra charge
for the hay.

In October 1984, the Board of
Trustees meeting in Buena
Vista hear a report from the
Dean of Admissions. Applica-
tions have dropped to 10% of the
past five years’ average. He
tells the Board that, excellent
as Washington and Lee’s educa-
tion is, high school students
everywhere say that if they
can’t get to the girls, they will
enroll where the action is. After
two days of debate the Trustees
vote that their deicsion of last
March was too hasty. So “in
keeping with Washington and
Lee’s commitment to a total
liberal arts education’’’ women
will be admitted as of
November 1, 1984.

Commerce School

Awarded Gift

The Harris and Eliza Kemp-
ner Fund of Galveston, Tex.,
has made.a $25,000 grant to
Washington and Lee University
in memory of the late Isaac H.
Kempner ‘Sr., an 1893 W&L
graduate.

The gift will be used toward
the $3.5-million cost of a new
home for the university’s School
of Commerce, Economics and
Politics. A unit in the facility
will be named for Mr. Kempner
in recognition of the founda-
tion’s gift and his notable
career.

. Isaac Kempner was the
eldest son of Harris and Eliza
Kempner, for whom the fund is
named. He was chairman of
U.S. National Bank in
Galveston and was mayor of the
city during World War I. Known
as “Mr. Galveston,” he was
honored by the W&L Alumni

Association at a banquet in his
honor in 1961. He died in 1967 at
the age of 94.

The commerce-school project
began this winter, and is ex-
pected to be completed in time
for the beginning of classes in
the 1980-81 academic year.

The new facility will provide
more than three times as much
space as the current commerce
building, Newcomb Hall, and
will have adequate classroom,
office, library and study space
for the School, now severely
overcrowded. In the past 43
years, since it was given full use
of Newcomb, the commerce
school has expanded its faculty
and curriculum by almost 200
percent, and the number of
students enrolled as majors has
increased from 18 percent of the
undergraduate student body to
45 percent.

IFC Proposal

(continued from page 1)

representatives abstained and
no representatives voted
against the proposal.

Many representatives took a
short break before plunging into
another hour of intense discus-
sion about next year’s rush.

In the past, fraternity
members were allowed to drink
alcohol between, but not during,
open houses.

The proposed change reads
“No alcoholic beverages will be
consumed during and in bet-
ween open houses.”’

“‘We’re trying to make the
rules stricter and keep them
from being wishy-washy,”’ said
Farrar.

He explained that the seman-
tics of certain rules in the past
has hindered enforcement.

Another example dealt with
contact. Formerly fraternities
have arranged to meet
freshmen at certain places and
give them rides to parties.

The IFC concedes that coin-
cidental contact is unavoidable,
“but no transportation can be
provided,” under the new rule.

But the biggest debate
centered on the change that
disallowed pledging until the
fourth rush date.

Five fraternities voted
against the measure and John
Snedden, of Phi Delta Theta, op-
posed the measure adamantly.

At one point discussion turned
into a shouting match between
Snedden and representatives of
SAE and Phi Kappa Sigma.

Most representatives argued
that the new rush calendar does

not allow freshmen and frater-
nity members to know each
other well by the first rush date
and that delaying pledging until
the fourth date will prevent
premature decisions.

Howard Smith of Phi Kap
stressed ‘‘the amount of
pressure four upperclassmen
can place on a freshman,”’ and
said any additional time on
campus will allow a freshman
to become just a little more
secure.

A rush calendar was devised
with rush scheduled to end on
Oct. 1, with the turning-in of
preference cards.

RtP Race

GLASSES ?

Here’s an effective new eye-exercise program that can
produce astonishing results in a very short time...

The Bettervision Eye Clinic is
now offering a program of eye-
exercises that can safety correct
most cases of poor eyesight—so
that glasses or contact lenses
are no longer needed. Originally
developed by Dr. William H. Bates
of the New York Eye Hospital, this
method has been widely used by the
Armed Forces, schools, clinics, and
thousands of private individuals, for
the treatment of:

@ nearsightedness
@ farsightedness
@ astigmatism

@ middle-age sight

For many years it was thought that
poor eyesight was just bad luck, or
something you inherit from your parents.
Scientists now know that most eyesight
problems are caused by accumulated
stress and tension—which squeeze the
eyeball out of shape, and affect the
muscles that do the Tanving The result
is the eye cannot form a clear image, and
the world appears to be blurry. In people
over 40, the natural aging process is also
an important factor.

No matter what
your eyesight problem
the Bates Method can help you.
This is a health care program,
and will benefit
everyone who follows it —
children, adults, and seniors.

It is important to understand that
lasses do not cure a visual problem.
hey are simply a compensating device

—like crutches. In fact, glasses usually
make the condition worse. Because they
make the eyes weak and lazy, a minor
problem often develops into a lifetime of
wearing glasses.

The Bates Me. oi corrects poor
— by strengthening the eye-
muscles and relaxing the eyeball. You do
simple easy exercises that increase your
focusing power, eliminate eyestrain, and
bring your eyesight back to normal.

Because the Bates Method deals with
the basic cause of your eyesight
problem, you can expect to see a definite
improvement in as little as 1 or 2 weeks.
Even if you have worn glasses all your
life—things will become clearer and
clearer, and you will have flashes of good
vision. . .as you gothrough the program,
these flashes become longer and more
frequent...gradually blending into
permanent better sight—at which point
the exercises are no longer necessary.

We usually find that people whose
eyesight is not too bad can return to
20/20 vision in about a month. Even if
your eyesight is really poor, within 2
to 3 months you should be able to put
away your cesar once and for all. Read
these case histories:

 

Aldous Huxley—Nobel Author

‘‘My vision was getting steadily worse,
even with greatly strengthened glasses.
To my dismay | realized I was going
blind. On the advice of my Doctor I
decided to try the Bates Method. There
was an immediate improvement. After
only 2 months I was able to read clearly
without glasses. Better still, the cataract
which had covered part of one eye for
over 16 years was beginning toclear up.”

Rev. Frederick A. Milos, M.S.

‘By following the simple exercises given
in this a. I have coapictaty
recovered my vision. Now | can read for

long periods without my glasses.”’

Ron Moore—Technician

“I originally went to the Clinic to deliver
some equipment—and ended up trying
their eye-exercise program. I am near-
sighted, and have worn glasses for 15
yrs. In just 3 weeks after starting
the program, my eyesight has already
improved to the point where I can now
drive, do business, and watch T.V.—all
without my glasses!"

movement of the eyeball.

This program has been specially
designed for the individual to exercise
at home. Written in simple non-technical
language, it gives you all the guidance
you need to regain natural healthy vision
in just 2 hour a day: illustrated booklet,
complete step-by-step instructions, plus
special charts and displays to ensure
you make rapid progress. The program
is fully guaranteed and there's nothing
more to buy.

By following this program, you will
soon be able to see clearly without
glasses. It's up to you. Ordering the
Bates Method can be one of the best
decisions you ever made. So do it now—

11-6 Lacrosse Win
Sets Up Saturday
Duel With Roanoke

The W&L lacrosse Generals
defeated the Shoremen of
Washington College, 11-6 on
Saturday in Chestertown, Md.
The closeness of the score is
deceiving as the Generals
dominated the game, winning
many key statistical areas.

After Washington College
jumped to an early 1-0 lead,
W&L scored seven unanswered
goals between the mid-way
points of the first and third
periods to put the game away.
This outburst was highlighted
by three goals from junior at-
tackman Jay Foster.

Taking a 9-2 lead into the last
period, the Generals, as has
been the case in other games
this year, began to play
cautiously and allowed
Washington College to gain
momentum and close the score
to 10-6.

With under four minutes to go
in the game, Washington Col-
lege gave it one last try and
came up with two excellent
scoring chances, only to be
frustrated by junior goalie Bob
Clements. For his efforts
Clements was named the ‘‘Can-
non Player of the Game’, an
award that he has won on two

previous occasions.
The W&L attack received
goals from eight different

players, and continue to be led
by the “Big Three’’, Black,
Fritz, and Foster who ac-
counted for nine points in the
contest.

Coach Jack Emmer is
cautiously optimistic about his
teams chances of making the
NCAA tournament knowing
that they must win their two re-
maining games against
Roanoke (ranked second in
Division II-II]) and Hofstra
(ranked fifteenth in Division I)
to receive a bid.

Generals To Take
Europe Trip In’79

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
basketball team has announced
plans to take an international
tour over the Christmas break
portion of the 1979-80 season.
According to Coach Verne Can-
field, the tour will encompass
“six countries: Iceland, Ger-
many, France, Holland, Lux-
embourg and the Bahamas.”

 

The team will also play in a
tournament in Florida before
returning to Lexington.

In order to pay for the trip,
the basketball team is now in
the process of raising close to
$17,000. The team has several
plans for coming up with the
funds, including a raffle for a
basket of ‘“‘cheer,’’ a running

Tennis Team Dominates
ODAC Tourney; Jackson
Captures Singles Title

by Nat Lovell

The Generals rebounded from
a loss to the Wahoos to take the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Championships in Lyn-
chburg over the weekend of
April 27-28. This victory retains
the W&L tennis team’s perfect
record in competition versus
ODAC teams.

On April 25, the netmen
travelled to The Homestead for
a match with the University of
Virginia. The Division I school
came away the winners by the

score of 8-1. Stewart Jackson
put up a fight in a close first set
but Hank Harris took control
and took the match 7-5,6-1. With
Shaw Cranfield ailing from a
sore back, Doug Gaker moved
into the number two slot only to
be met head on by Adam Brock
who won 6-1,6-0. Dave Constine

seems to be finding some of his

old form though he lost a close
match to Brent Hendecks
7-6,6-4. Wes Yonge was shut out
of his match with Rodney
Crowley 6-0,60. Bob Schuler
lost in three sets to Stuart
Horsley 6-1,3-6,6-2.

Jackson and Constine had it
their way in doubles as they
earned the Generals’ only point
by defeating Harris and Brock

7-6,6-2. The University of
Virginia netmen swept the re-
maining doubles to complete
the victory.

The team dominated the
ODAC Championships with 68
points. Hampden-Sydney and
Randolph-Macon followed with
56 points and 48 points respec-
tively. Jackson cruised through
the Number 1 division tourna-
ment taking the final over Mc-
Cauly of H-S 6-3,6-3. Cranfield
also breezed through his divi-

sion taking the final over Kevin

   

it to the finals before falling to
the Hampden-Sydney duo 6-3,
7-5.

The Generals kept the
momentum going as_ they
defeated James Madison on
Sunday by the score of 7-2.
Jackson started slowly but
came back to whip Steve Gill
3-6,6-0,6-3. Cranfield beat Ed
Barnhardt 6-3,6-3. Gaker fell to
Mark Snead 6-2,6-1. Constine
won a see-saw battle with John
Witt 6-1,1-6,7-6. Norris lost a
close match to Dave Rigotti

Baseball Season Over

by Chris Sisto

The General’s varsity
baseball team played only three
games last week and dropped
them all as their long season
nears an end. Their overall
record is 4-15 and their com-
pleted ODAC record is 2-8.

In the first of the three mat-
ches the Generals could not
muster any hitting attack in los-
ing to the Lynchburg cham-
pions, 7-0. Then, on Sunday, tlhe
Generals dropped a

doubleheader to ODAC oppo-
ncnt Emory and Henry, 3-2 and
6-3.

The opener was close
throughout as the Generals
gave up one run in the last inn-
ing to lose the game.

In the second game the
Generals could not get any hit-
ting attack going as they were
outgunned in a _ darkness
shortened game.

The Generals’ last two games
were played yesterday in a
doubleheader at VMI.

5-7,7-5,6-2. Yonge pulled out a
victory over Chris Laybourne
3-6,6-0,6-4. The netmen went on
to take all doubles in three sets.
Four straight days of mat-
ches took its toll on the team as
they lost 7-2 to VPI. Jackson ran
out of gas after a close first set,
and Jim Milley ran out the
match 7-5, 6-0. Cranfield fought

Gaker and Yonge
romped through the second
division winning 6-0,6-2 in the
finals. Norris and Schuier made

his way to a 7-6,6-4 victory over

by Bob McIntosh 6-2,6-0. Con-
stine lost to Bill Hamilton
6-2,7-6. Norris was defeated by
Ron Paquette 6-2,6-2. Yonge
was a 6-2,6-3 loser to Dean
Channell.

Jackson and Cranfield won
their doubles match 6-2,6-2 for
the Generals’ other point.

Golfers Finish At 14-2, Second In ODAC:
But Still Are Uncertain Of NCAA Bid

The Washington & Lee golf
team, which has enjoyed an
outstanding year of victories,
finished up its regular season
play with a 14-2 record. The
season was capped by a 4-
match victory at Ingleside in
Staunton, against Randolph-
Macon (team score total of 417),
Bridgewater (417), Radford
(434) and Roanoke (forfeit).
The W&L team score was 377
for the May 1 matches.

Gerry Barousse and Andy
Fitzgerald ended the day as co-
medalists, both shooting a 74 on
the par-72 Ingleside course.

In other golf play, the
Generals finished a strong se-
cond in the ODAC golf tourna-
ment held last Monday in
Ashland, Virginia. The
Generals’ team total was 600 for
the April 23 game, coming in
with a 14-stroke lead over third
place Roanoke while tagging
only ten strokes behind cham-
pion Lynchburg College.

Again, Barousse was the
Championship medalist,
finishing with a two-round total

and an outdoor concert. The
team will also sell souvenir
booklets which will com-
memorate the highlights of the
tour.

The important thing to
remember about this trip is that
the funds will be collected solely
by the basketball team. ‘We
are not going to tap any of the
alumni,”’ said Canfield. “We
want their input but we do not
want their money.”’

The coach was also very en-
thusiastic about the uniqueness
of a trip to Europe. ‘‘You have
to remember that no other col-
lege in the United States is plan-
ning this sort of trip,’ said Can-
field. ‘‘To say the least, this is
something that has never been
done at Washington and Lee.
We are playing only four games
in Europe but that is not as im-
portant as is taking the trip,”’
added the coach.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Nostalgia and
rude awakenings

The senior banquet, sponsored by the Alumni
Association, is another of those ‘“‘resurrected events”’
which have recently soared in popularity — just like
Fancy Dress in 1974. The overwhelming majority of
the undergraduate seniors were present, and a
healthy number of law seniors, with professors and
staff filling out the circle. For many, it was a mixed
bag of nostalgia, sentiment, and the first rude
awakening that alumni status will come to the class of
1979 in just over a month.

The banquet was climaxed by the presentation of
the Gilliam Award, to the student who has “‘rendered
the greatest service to the University.’’ We are told
that the debate, resulting in the selection of student
body president Beau Dudley, was an unusually short
one for the selection committee. It comes as little sur-
prise. Quite simply, Duuley is one of the most ar-
ticulate, organized, and fair student leaders this cam-
pus has ever been privileged to call to office. After a
year of turbulence for many student groups in 1977-78,
Dudley brought an aura of efficiency from the earliest
weeks of his term in office. Setting the tone for the
EC, but never infringing on each member’s right of
expression, he was an ideal choice when the time
came to recognize a leader. Our heartiest congratula-
tions....

Bringing back the senior banquet last year was
especially welcome to the Ring-tum Phi, giving us a
‘soap box”’ on which to present our annual achieve-
ment awards. This year, we were pleased to
recognize seven very special people, who have cer-
tainly given that “‘little extra” referred to by previous
editors when listing their choices. Specific events or
achievements have always been a favorite area for
our selections; hence, no awards could be more ap-
propriate than the ones awarded to librarian Maurice
Leach and senior Steve Mangan for their astonishing
Library Move in January. The 1,600 people they
mobilized for the day may be the greatest evidence
against those perennial charges of ‘‘W&L apathy”’....

James Whitehead has worked diligently for W&L
for some 20 years; our award to him is in specific ap-
preciation for his efforts in bringing the Herreshoff
paintings to their rightful place in the public eye.
Others receiving awards for their service — to the
Ring- tum Phi in particular — were Pam Hartless and
Fred Clark, whose production expertise and over 20
years of combined experience helped the paper to ex-
pand nearly 200% in the past two years.

No sonner did I mention W&L’s own “‘leprechaun,”’
who magically created the greatest charity event
ever seen at W&L, than the audience bellowed for Jay
Blumberg to stand. Smiling in the face of possible (if
not probable) failure for four months, his energy car-
ried the MD Dance Marathon to a $17,000 mark —
three times the predicted goal. It is most reassuring
to know that this ace organizer will be part of our Ex-
ecutive Committee next year.

And finally...what can you say about everybody’s
second mother? The mention of Betty Miller’s name
as our final honoree brought every senior to his
feet—as if by instinct. I think for many of us she
epitomizes the spirit and warmth of W&L, which the
senior class will be leaving all too soon. As she herself
can tell you, graduate schools won’t be providing can-
dy to go with those bad report cards....

An outstanding group of caring individuals....We
are more than pleased that the senior banquet and the
Ring-tum Phi awards are again joined in an annual

celebration.

Correction

Some of the White Book
changes were inaccurately
reported in last week’s Ring-
tum Phi. The proposal that
would make anything a suspect
says to an EC member usable
against him was voted down.
The EC’s policy regarding
aquittal, which was not a White
Book change, should have read
that it takes two-thirds of the
EC to aquit a suspect.

Mainstream Reviews Top Singles

(continued from page 4)
are so distinctive that they act
as substitute ‘‘hooks’’, embed-
ding, themselves in your brain
just like a catchy chorus or riff
would. Whatever you may think
of Dire Straits, they’re a

change, and a refreshing one at.

that, from standard top-10 fare.

‘‘Reunited’’—Peaches &
Herb—Peaches & Herb are one
of the few really top-notch disco
acts working today, and their
two singles to date, ‘Shake
Your Groovething’’ and
‘Reunited’, have been just
about as classily produced, ar-
ranged, and sung as anything
you’re likely to come across

these days. ‘“‘Reunited’’ is just
as beautiful and relaxing as a
ballad as ‘Shake Your
Groovething’’ was catchy and
sophisticated as a dance
number. Like most good pop,
the song is timeless—you could
just as easily imagine the
BeeGees or Smokey Robinson &
the Miracles doing their own
renditions of ‘‘Reunited’’. More
artists like Peaches & Herb,
Donna Summer, and Sylvester
would without a doubt cut down
on the anti-disco backlash by
demonstrating the truth of the
old adage, ‘‘anything done well
can be entertaining.”

‘What a Fool Believes’—

 

Fraternity Academic
Standings
Winter Term, 1979

  

Doobie Brothers—Putting all
questions of objectivity aside
for a moment, i should say that
in my book ‘‘What A Fool
Believes’ is one of the best
singles to hit the charts so far
this year. I think the main thing
about this one is the rhythm; it
could pass for disco (in fact, it
made number 38 on Billboard’s
Disco Hot 80), but it also rocks
with a sort of quiet intensity
that’s really quite unique. Com-
bine that with the kind of ar-

ranging and production you’d
expect from the Doobies,. and
you come up with something a
cut above most of the competi-
tion.

And as long as we’re in a com-
mercial vein, a recent album
release on the Berserkly label
deserves mention. If you enjoy
light, well-played,  well-
produced, _ singles-oriented
music, check out the Rubinoos’
latest, Back to the Drawing
Board—it’s pop perfection.

think this shows better balance
than in recent years.”

Leslie recalled that his
golfers went to the nationals in
1977, finishing seventh out of 20
teams. ‘‘I think we’re even a lit-
tle better now,” he said.

He expects Lynchburg to get
the NCAA nod for final play.
“Still, we deserve a bid as well.
We beat Lynchburg two out of
three times this year, losing on-
ly in ODAC play.” And, it is
possible — as it happened in
1977 — that two ODAC teams
could be slated for the NCAA
matches, though other con-
ference teams are within the
same selection area as W&L.

Read next week’s Phi for a
profile on the team, and reports
on their NCAA progress.
