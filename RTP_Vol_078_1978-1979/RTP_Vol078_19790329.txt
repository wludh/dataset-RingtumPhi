Dance Marathon Raises $17,000

Three Times More Than Expected Given To Fight Muscular Dystrophy

by David Greer

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s first annual .Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon
grossed $17,052 last weekend,
according to chairman Jay
Blumberg.

Blumberg, who had set the
original goal at $5,000, said that
the results “‘were beyond my
wildest expectations.”

Sophomore Dean Kalamaras
raised the most money in
pledges, bringing in $3,020. In
doing so, he won. a trip to
Disneyworld, which he donated
to MD with the stipulation that
the trip be given to a child
whohas muscular dystrophy.

Blumberg said that about 65
dancers started in the
marathon and about 60 finished.
Their pledges totoal about
$15,000. He expects about a 98
percent collection return.

Blumberg said that there was
much participation from Sweet-
briar and Randolph-Macon Col-
leges, and some from Southern
Seminary Junior College.

The marathon brought in
money other than from pledges.
Fraternities donated beer and
nearly all the fraternities gave
money. Fraternity donations
totaled about $1,400.

Money from admission total-
ed about $1,200, Blumberg said
The pizza eating contest be-
tween W&L and VMI brought
about $97.

Over $300 was raised in an
auction to throw pies in the
faces of famous or infamous
local celebrities. The privilege
went to the highest bidder, and
six people tasted the cream.

Lexington police officer Jack
Purvis went for $70, Dean Ed-

ward C. Atwood for $85, Dean .

Lewis A. John for $70, professor
John Gunn for $45, Dr. J. Holt
Merchant for $25, and professor
Hamden H. Smith for $14.50,
Blumberg said.

Only four or five contestants
participated in the wet T-shirt
contest.

Blumberg said that Saturday
night was the most crowded and
that 25 kegs of beer were emp-
tied during the marathon.

Blumberg said that most of
the pledges were small pledges
from students, and that the
community and parents were
not ‘‘hit hard” for pledges. The
largest single pledge. was for
about $200.

Virginia Tech also raised
$17,000 at its first marathon, but
had about 700 dancers,
Blumberg said. Old Dominion
University has raised the most
money in the state with a total
of $24,000.

None of them come close to

-reaching the per dancer total of

$240 achieved at
Blumberg said.

Blumberg said that there
definitely will be another dance
marathon next year, and hopes
that it will be ‘‘the second major
event of the winter.”’

“This has restored my faith in
the school,” Blumberg said.
“What we did last weekend
went a lot further than just ear-
ning money for muscular
dystrophy.”

“Hopefully next year people
will schedule around us instead
of us scheduling around them.”

Delts Placed On Social
Probation By The IFC

by John Billmyre

Delta Tau Delta was placed
on social probation for the re-
mainder of this semester by the
Interfraternity Council, at a
Judicial Board meeting Mon-
day, for an activity that
‘‘hindered a pledge’s academic
work,” violating By-Law VII,
Section 2 of the IFC constitu-
tion.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee upheld the IFC punishment

on Tuesday and added the
stipulation that no girls are
allowed in the fraternity house
during the probation.

Had Delta Tau Delta elected
to do so, it could have appealed
the penalty before SAC on Tues-
day.

‘We felt we would end up with
the same penalty,” explained
Delta Tau Delta President Andy
DeMuth.

Effectively Delt will be on

probation for one week, since no
fraternity is allowed to hold
parties the week before exams.

“There was good reason for
the trial,’’ DeMuth said. He ad-
ded, ‘‘The decision was
prematurely rendered because
there was pressure from the
faculty and administration for
the IFC to remain a viable
body.”’

Newly elected IFC president

(continued on page 2)

For junior president, runoff
between Powell Jones and Joe
Robles.

For junior vice president:
runoff between Chris Daniel
and Joel Segall.

For sophomore EC represen-
tative, runoff between John
Martin, Stuart Miller, Nelson
Ould, and Jim Wenke.

For sophomore _ president,
runoff between Stephen King
and Glen Koontz.

For sophomore vice presi-
dent: runoff between Jack
Wells and Bud White.

The EC announced that
voting regulations prohibit
write-in candidates for runoff
elections.

In other EC _ business,
Freeman Jones of the Student
Loans Committee requested
and received a loan of $200 from
the EC reserve fund, to be paid
back in a month. He cited an
unusually large number of re-
quests for loans as the reason
for the loan.

Stuart Miller said that Coach
McHenry was_ enthusiastic
about the plan to have
cheerleaders next year and that
he had sent letters to other
small colleges for information
about their cheerleading pro-
grams.

EC Makes Minor Revisions
To W&L’s Honor System

by Joe Scott

Proposed White Book
changes affecting the
Washington and Lee Honor
Code were approved by the Ex-
ecutive Committee on Monday
and Tuesday nights.

Most of the changes were
made to clarify the E.C.’s posi-
tion on rules currently inferred
in honor trial proceedings and
to alleviate problems en-
countered by the E.C. during
honor trials held during the cur-
rent school year.

A new clause was inserted
stated that an individual member
of the Executive Committee
should disqualify himself from
participation in an honor hearing
if in that member's opinion he

would be unable to view the facts
and to judge the accused objec-
tively. The decision to disqualify
oneself should occur only in cases
prejudice

where measurable

could result to judge the accused,

E.C. President Beau Dudley
said that the new clause was
“intended to get something on
paper to authorize actions
presently not covered in the
White Book.”’ He also felt that
the ‘‘second sentence was as
important as the first.”’

Junior Class representative
Steve Abraham disagreed. He
felt it was ‘‘adding volume to
the White Book that was not
needed.’ Sophomore represen-
tative Bob Willis also saw no
need for the addition. The pro-

posal passed 6-5.

Pargraph C on page six was
extended to clarify the E.C.’s
position on admission of new
evidence during an honor trial.
If during the course of a trial, the
E.C. discovers that additional
witnesses and/or evidence may be
introduced provided the accused
agrees and has an opportunity to
prepare for its introduction. If the
accused does not agree the E.C,
shall decide whether to proceed
without the evidence or terminate
the hearing.”

Senior Law _ representative
John Murphy commented that
‘if the preliminary _ in-
vestigative team hasn’t
gathered all the information
then more power to the accus-
ed.”’

Freshman _ representative
Charles Scott disagreed and
said that ‘‘we should have the
opportunity to _ introduce
evidence.’ He also felt that
disallowing this evidence would
be a great injustice to the honor
system.

Added also on page six was an
explanation of the acquittal pro-
cedure. A vote of Acquittal by
more than a majority of the
members hearing the case ter-
minates the hearing with a verdict
of not guilty. This vote of acquit-
tal may be taken at any time dur-
ing the hearing.

‘I wanted to spell out the op-
tions,’’ said Dudley, referring to

the rewording of paragraph H
on page six. “It clarifies
testifies and _ closing
statements.’’ The re-wording
emphasizes that the accused is
allowed to “‘testify and/or read
a closing statement.”’

Choosing to testify makes the
accused answer all questions
asked by the E.C. Questioning
by the Committee during the
closing statement is formally
disallowed.

The accused and his advisors
are now included in the wording
for people who are allowed to
use the tape recording to honor
trial testimony. Previously,
paragraph A-2, page five, made
the tape available only to the
E.C. advocates.

The President may not serve as
a member of an_ investigative
team. The sentence was inserted
in the White Book’s description
of the selection of E.C. honor
trial investigators where
previously it had not been men-
tioned.

Immediate destruction of all
records in the event the accused
is declared innocent has been
changed to destruction of the
tapes at the end of the academic
year. If declared guilty, the
tape will be destroyed after a 10
year period. The White Book’s
wording before indicated that
the tape would be kept per-
manently along with the
Secretary's summary.

Other White Book changes
were re-wordings of old clauses
to emphasize points that E.C.
members wished to clarify. One
clause spelled out the options of
a student when faced with
reporting an honor violation.
‘“There’s no change as far as
I’m concerned,”’ said Dudley.

New sentences emphasizing
the confidentiality of the hear-
ings were passed by a 6-5 vote.
Arguments against the change
focused on the ‘unnecessary
adding on of verbiage.”’

Should the accused withdraw
before going to trial, the notice
shall indicate that the accused
withdrew after having been charg-
ed with a possible honor violation.
The sentence was added by a
unanimous vote to paragraph K
on page seven.

g IFC Puts Delts On

Social Probation

(continued from page 1)
Syd Farrar said, “If no decision
had been made by the Judicial
Board, then we would have lost
faculty or administration sup-
port.’’ Farrar is also a member
of SAC, as president of the IFC.

Both Farrar and Danny Mur-
phy, Assistant Dean of Students
and Assistant Director of Ad-
missions, said the matter was
‘brought up because there was
a complaint.”

The complaint originated
with Dr. Michael A. Pleva,
Associate Professor of
Chemistry, who sent a letter of
complaint to Murphy that was
relayed to the IFC.

“If any individual, fraternity
or faculty member has a case of
any nature that they want taken
to the Judicial Board, I will take
it there, and it will then go to
SAC,”’ said Murphy.

“If something comes to my
attention, I must investigate it
was fully as I can,”’ added Mur-

phy.
The complaint was that a Delt
initiation activity had

prevented a Delt pledge from
attending class fully prepared.
A quiz was scheduled for that
class period and the student
scored below his normal

average, according to the let-
ter.

One student in that class in-
dicated the pledge announced
that he received 14 out of a
possible 20 points.

“They got us on circumstan-
tial evidence,’’ said DeMuth.

Another Delt said ‘‘a subjec-
tive decision had been made by
Farrar before the trial
started.” He added that Farrar
knew the newly initiated Delt
from varsity football.

‘It comes down to said or un-
said peer pressure that you
should be at a fraternity func-
tion,” Farrar said and added,
“It was initiation.”

In other IFC decisions
reviewed by SAC, a $100 fine
and a $30 fine were upheld by
SAC against Kappa Alpha for
damages made on the Lambda
Chi house.

SAC also upheld an IFC
punishment of a member of the
Phi Kappa Sigma house for his
behavior at a pledge banquet at
a local hotel.

Neither the hotel proprietor
nor Phi Kap wanted the matter
to be pursued, but the situation
came to Murphy’s attention and
was investigated.

William J. Stearns,
Washington & Lee’s head swim-
ming coach for the past thirteen
seasons, has announced his
resignation from that position.
Stearn’s resignation will
become effective at the end of
the current academic year.

“T am resigning from my
position to develop my housing
business”, said the coach. “I
have no differences with the
University, I feel it is time for
myself to move on to other lines
of work.”

In thirteen seasons with
Washington & Lee, Stearns has
posted an 84-41 swimming
record and his water polo teams
have gone 25-18 in two years of
intercollegiate competition.

“‘We’re extremely sorry to

see Bill leaving the coaching
profession’’, said Athletic
Director William D. McHenry.
“He has been a very valuable
member of our physical educa-
tion and intercollegiate pro-
grams.”

Stearns’ resignation comes at
the end of a very stormy season
for the swim team. In the past
season, the swimmers’ meet
record was 2-8, as compared to
the previous team’s mark of
10-1. Moreover, the Generals
finished twenty-seventh in this
year’s NCAA Division HII
Championships, while last
year’s team finished tenth in
the same event. This season
was also the first time in five
years that a W&L swim team
has failed to crack the top ten
for Division III teams. It was
also only the second losing
season for a Generals’ swim
team since the end of World
War II.

The coach himself drew
criticism from _ local
newspapers for his controver-
sial housing practices, in-
cluding his policies on renova-
tions and evictions of local

families. Stearns has also been
highlighted in several housing
articles featured in the Ring-
tum Phi.

The swim teams disappoin-
ting performance and Stearns’
sudden resignation naturally
raised the question of his in-
terest in coaching the team this
year. “I believe that my hous-
ing business in no way affected
my coaching ability,” said the
coach. ‘‘Coaching§ at
Washington & Lee was my
number one priority, and I gave
it my best effort.”

Stearns’ resignation comes at
possibly the peak of his
coaching prowess. An earlier
predecessor of Stearns, Cy
Twombly, coached swimming
at Washington & Lee for thirty-
two seasons. Still, Stearns feels
it is the correct decision to
move on. ‘In thirteen years at
W&L I feel that I’ve made the
swimming program very com-
petitive and successful. At this
time, I thing that there is not
much more for me to ac-
complish.”’

No successor to Stearns has
yet been named.

Kimbrough Awarded

Research Grant

Dr. Emory Kimbrough, head
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s sociology and an-
thropology department, has
been awarded a research grant
from the Maurice L. Mednick
Fund for summer work in
England.

The Mednick Fund is ad-
ministered by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges (VFIC), a joint fund-
raising consortium of 12 four-
year private colleges in the
state, including W&L.

Kimbrough will use his Med-
nick research grant for study
this summer at Oxford in the
California Berkeley Worcester
College Program. His work will
be in the areas of national
welfare policy and city govern-
ment, management and
oolitics.

The VFIC administers the
fund to encourage the profes-
sional development of college
teachers and improve their
competence through grants for
research and advanced study,
and to assist highly qualified,
needy students in their up-
perclass years in college. This
year, the VFIC has announced
nine Mednick grants to pro-
fessors in Virginia colleges, in-
cluding Kimbrough, and two
student awards.

Kimbrough has __ taught
sociology at W&L since 1962 and
became department head in
1967. His fields of teaching and
research specialty are
bureaucratic organizations,
population, and _ urban
sociology.

W&L Graduates In Lexington...

Danny
Murphy

by Stuart Snyder

Danny N. Murphy, Assistant
Dean of Students, Coordinator
of Fraternities, and Assistant
Director of Admissions, was
once a Washington and Lee stu-
dent himself. His job entails ex-
actly what his title states.

He helps with high school
recruitment and makes admis-
sions decisions. Also, he is stu-
dent coordinator of Fraternity
Affairs and director of the In-
terfraternity Council. But like
the others in these pages, his
memory of W&L goes back
quite a bit further.

Murphy, originally from Lit-
tle Rock, Arkansas, graduated
from W&L in 1973, majoring in
English and Sociology. He at-
tended W&L during one of its’
most troubled times, a time
period shortly after the Kent
State shootings and just after
the start of the bombings of
Cambodia.

He was a freshman when, as
he recalls, about a week of
disturbance broke out in May of
1970. It was the direct result of
the bombing of Camodia, which
meant expansion of the Indo-
China War, and the Kent State
shootings.

According to Murphy, the
week was punctuated by rallies
in front of Lee Chapel, students
wanting to go to Washington,
D.C. to protest the war,
emergency meetings by ad-
ministration and faculty, and
threats on the R.0.T.C.
building. It all culminated in
about 700 of the 1,365 students
filing for incompletes in one or
more of their subjects to protest
the Vietnam War.

It all started with the United
States bombing of Cambodia,
while the memories of Kent
State were still fresh. Ac-
cording to an official release by
W&L’s News Office, the first
campus student action was an
evening really on Tuesday, May
5, that attracted 400 to 500
students to protest the Cambo-
dian ‘“‘situation.’’ During the
rally, which had no formal
organization, some students re-
quested a one-day strike
against classes the next day.

 

Ve

 

According to Murphy, the ad-
ministration and faculty began
to have emegency meetings to
decide what to do. At about the
same time, some ‘students
from the University of Virginia
or wherever they were from”
came to the campus and started
to conduct rallies in front of Lee

cause,” he said.

‘‘For the most part, the W&L
students felt they were handling
things themselves and the out-
side students were interferring
in things they should not be
meddling in,’’ Murphy said.

He remembered that the out-
side students asked W&L

am.”

Murphy said this was just an
example of how much W&L
does care for its students and
part of the reason why he came
back.

According to Murphy, at the
same time as the “‘intruding”’
students were making their

Murphy reflects on

Vietnam era at W&L:
rallies in front of Lee Chapel, 700 students filing for
incomplete grades, talk of blowing up the ROTC building...

 

Chapel.

In fact, there were speakers
there every day thoughout the
trouble, stated William J. Watt,
Dean of the College.

Murphy recalled going to
listen to some of their speeches.
He said that these students ad-
vocated blowing up
“everything”’ without thinking
what they would do after that.
“They shared the same view as
Abbie Hoffman: the govern-
ment was doing terrible things.
Thus, we should tear it all down
and worry later about
rebuilding it,’’ Murphy said.

Murphy only agreed with the
“outsiders’’ in their opposition
to the war. He felt that they of-
fered no ‘‘viable alternatives.”
He added, ‘‘It is useless to just
blow things up without a pur-
pose.”’

However, Murphy felt that
the outside students were
honest in their efforts. They felt
they were furthering ‘‘the

students what their school was
doing for them. They added that
the administrators were too
slow in their decisions and they
didn’t really care for the
students. .

In fact, according to Murphy,
during one of their speeches,
they even asked out right,
“Where is your President
now?’’ President Huntley was
in the crowd listening to what
they-had to say, as he had been
through most of the speeches.
He spoke up and said, ‘‘Here I

speeches ‘‘threats were made to
blow up our own R.O.T.C.
building.”’

However, in order to insure
the safety of the building, a
group of about 110 students
formed to protect the building,
Murphy stated.

He added, these students used
walkie-talkies borrowed from
the R.O.T.C. building to keep in
touch with one another. “‘It is
ironic because most of the
students were vehemently op-
posed to the Vietnam’ War;

 

however, they felt that violence
to get rid of violence was
wrong,”’ said Murphy.

As Murphy recalled, the
situation eneded with the ad-
ministration and _ faculty
deciding to allow students who
wanted to participate in the ac-
tivities in Washington, D.C. to
take an incomplete in one or
more of their courses. However,
the incompletes had to be made
up by September 30, 1970, he
said.

According to Watt, approx-
imately 700 students elected to
take one or more incompletes,
but he added, many more ac-
tually participated. He conclud-
ed that probably every student
was involved in one way or
another.

Although he did not go to
Washington, D.C., Murphy felt
that it was a worthwhile cause.
He felt the whole experience
was ‘*stimulating.’’
“Of course, some students just
used it as an excuse to get out of
classes, but most were

Dan Scott

by Chris Chatfield

Dan Scott, a drama major,
graduated from W&L in 1977. A
former manager of the Cockpit
(last year) and bartender at the
Lexington Country Club, Scott
now manages« the University
Record Store and is a night disc
jockey on WREL.

When asked about his impres-
sions of changes at W&L in his
first years here, Scott noted
several examples.

“First, when I was an
undergrad there was a lot less
dishonesty. Working at W&L
I've been able to see how much
students steal,’ ’she said.

“It used to bé you could leave
your books somewhere and
come back a few days later to
find them still there — not any
more. In February $140 worth of
records and tapes were stolen
from the record store,’’ Scott
said,

Scott was the manager of the
Cockpit last year. He quit
‘‘because I needed more
money,’ and because of pro-
blems with student organiza-
tions.

“One thing that really blew
me out when I was manager of
the Cockpit was that I literally
had to fight the students for
their own good. I had to fight
them to instate cover charges —
so we could get more bands and
to get a stage built for the per-

academic tastes as changed.
“Students are less concerned
with a liberal arts education.
They just don’t appreciate the
fact that they are in a liberal
arts college which gives them a
chance to try everything.

‘‘The students I see are either

 

Dan Scott:

“Students are either

vocation oriented or...they use these

four years for escape, a last fling.”

 

. formers.

‘“T would love to see the SAB
spend their money intelligently.
I would love to see more diversi-
ty in the way they spend their
money.”’

Scott would like to be a reper-
tory actor or possibly teach
drama. ‘‘I like Lexington,’’ he
said, ‘‘But there is not much op-
portunity for me to beocme
financially solvent working
here.”’

‘My wife, Pam, is a junior at
Hollins and I owe an incredible
amount of money to the univer-
sity, so 1 may be here for a
while.”’

Scott also sees students’

vocation oriented or they see
the inevitability of entering the
business world so they use these
four years for escape, a last
fling.

“Since going to W&L, I’ve
gotten a lot more conservative
in my educational philosophy. If
I went to college again I would
balance my major with Latin or
Greek and more maths and
sciences.”

What Makes

Paul “Flamer” Fleming

by MikePerry ..

Whill most Washington and
Lee graduates leave our town
upon graduation, a few find
their way back to Lexington.
One such W&L alumnus is Paul
‘Flamer’ Fleming, class of
1975, and currently in charge of
the check cashing service at the
University Bookstore. I caught
up with Flemming at Central
Lunch, one of his favorite
hangouts, to discuss
Washington & Lee’s past, pre-
sent and future.

In September, 1967, Fleming
began his academic career at
W&L following a two week
delay caused by a case of viral
pneumonia. He became
disgusted with the ‘‘glorified
boarding school’ atmostphere
and left in November, 1968 to
enlist in the Army. Fleming
found many of the University’s
regulations such as no women
or liquor permitted in the
dorms, regular Saturday morn-
ing classes, a maximum of
three cuts permitted per class,
no freshman cars and a re-
quired dress code (coat and tie)
to be excessive.

Fleming describes the 1960's

cerned with looks and images.”’

On the subject of town-gown
relations, Fleming believes that
many of the existing conflicts,
particularily those related to
the noise ordinance were pro-
mpted by what he termed “‘ex-
cessive Spring term partying”’
and the fact that students were
“setting new records for the
number of bad checks written in
a term” Fleming suggests that
fraternities could ‘‘solve the
noise problem by starting their
parties earlier.’”’ Fleming ex-
plains that fraternity parties us-
ed to start late because dorm
parietals at the neighboring
girls’ schools prevented the
girls from getting to W&L by
9:00 p.m., but today he sees no
reason why parties cannot start
at8p.m.

1972 was not devoid of student
initiated pranks either, as
Fleming recalls that one par-
ticular evening several
members of the freshman class
kidnapped a classmate named
Al Black. The students paraded
through the streets of Lexington
carrying Black on their
shoulders shouting ‘‘Al Black!
Al Black!,” gathering addi-

as a “turbulent era,” par-
ticularily 1968 and _ 1969,
characterized by “noon rallies
in front of Evans Dining Hall by
staff, faculty and students.”
Fleming points out that there
was a great deal of pressure on
students to stay in school and
get into graduate school posed
by the draft. Others felt
pressure to enlist and go to fight
in Vietnam.

While Fleming maintains that
many aspects of the University
were being ‘‘questioned and ex-
amined,” he is quick to point
out that no violence erupted
“like at Berkley.”’ Fleming at-
tributes this to the ‘‘levelhead-
ed’’ handling of the affair by
Administration ‘‘before
anything got out of hand,’’ and
the fact that ‘‘W&L doesn’t ap-
peal to the radical student.”

Following a three year tour of
duty in the Army, including a
year in Vietnam, Fleming
returned to W&L in 1971 and
graduated in 1975. Fleming
found W&L very much changed
due to the abolition of many
bothersome regulations. Flem-
ing was impressed with the
school and proceeded to earn
the nickname ‘‘Flamer’’ for
“flaming out,’’ an expression
for having a good time,’”’ which

Fleming believes that the
Washington and Lee student
body changed in his absence
and was no longer characteriz-
ed) by a ‘‘country-club at-
mosphere”’ consisting of a well-

heeled student body possessing :

‘a different car each semester.
Today students are less con-

tional supporters as they con-
tinued. Local residents heard
the noise and the _ students

cheering “Al Black!” and
reasoned that a race riot was
taking place.

Apathy, says Fleming “‘is the
one thing that hasn’t changed at
W&L.”’ Fleming believes that
students today are ‘‘more ra-
tional about issues’’ and
recognize the limits of student
input in the University decision-
making process.

Fleming calls the present
W&L student body a ‘‘good mix-
ture’ composed of a variety of
backgrounds represented by

Mock Convention:

 

in Richmond to construction
work in Phoenix, Arizona. Last
January, he began running the

“ check cashing service at the

University Bookstore designed
to aid students cashing checks
written on out-of-state banks.
He is kept quite busy —
especially a few weeks back
when a record of $10,444 was
cashed before Fancy Dress
Weekend. His activities in Lex-
ington also include work as the
“Evil Eye,” keeping watch
over student apartments during
the Christmas Break.

On the subject of housing,
Fleming points out that up-

perclassmen have always had
problems finding good housing.
Fleming believes that many
students are irresponsible
tenants, but adds that some
landlords ‘‘do take advantage of
students.’’ Fleming suggests
that the University publish a
booklet or offer a seminar on
the subject of housing covering
leases and rental procedures.
Fleming adds that the Universi-
ty should ‘‘set up a committee
to arbitrate landlord-tenant
disputes without the use of the
courts,’’ — such a committee
would. help to safeguard
landlord’s rights as well.
Fleming does not see
coeducation in W&L’s future.
‘As long as enrollments are up
and finances are stable, _ it
seems W&L fulfills a need. A lot
of other universities went coed
because they had to.’’ Fleming
calls coeducation a- ‘‘dead

issue,” explaining that it
doesn’t come up as much as it
used to. Fleming also foresees a
“challenge to the liberal arts
program’”’ of education. Flem-
ing maintains that students are
questioning whether or not ‘‘the
hassle and expense of a W&L
degree is worth it,” and
believes that the administration
will have to accomodate these
‘students concerned with hav-
ing a more marketable
degree.”’

In terms of his own future,
Paul Fleming explains that he
has always viewed his job at the
Bookstore as a ‘‘temporary’ but
fun experience.”’ His plans for
the future include ‘‘trying to get
out of town as fast as I can’’ and
more specifically returning to
the firm he worked for in Rich-
mond or elsewhere in the field
of personnel management.

hue ak’.

Now that the ‘‘New Wave”’
has gone through birth,
childhood, suffered an early
death, and been reincarnated, it
may be time to try and decide
just what sort of effect it has
had, not upon the _ political
stratospheres of Britain or the
class structure of the Bowery,
but upon the listener, the fun-
damental raison d'etre for
music in the first place.

What, if anything, are we
hearing now that we wouldn't
have been able to hear three
years ago? Did the punks, as
some have claimed, scare the
‘boring old farts’’ into putting a

little life back into their music? -

In other words, what has the
cumulative effect of this
“movement”’ been for a Yank
who's never seen Akron or the
Bowery?

In America as well as in Bri-
tain, the whole thing started as
a reaction to the social,
political, and musical apathy of
the ‘70’s At first it seemed like
everything was coming up
roses. The release of Live at the
Rat and Live at CBGB's ap-
peared to signal a new interest
in the grassroots level of rock
‘n’ roll by convincingly
demonstrating the truth of the
old maxim that a good deal of
the best music never reaches
the public’s ears.

Simultaneously, in Britain,
the Sex Pistols and the Damned
were succeeding in shocking
everyone with their lifestyles as
well as their music, while Nick
Lowe and the rest of the Stiff
gang were gathering on the
sidelines, preparing to attack
that elusive American market.

What to many _ people
represented the ‘‘death”’ of the
New Wave can best be dated to
a period spanning the spring
and early summer of 1978. The
causes of that. death, which
eventually turned out to be only
a dry spell, are just as uncer-
tain as anything else about the
movement, but the three most
significant ones appear to be:
a) a bad case of overcoverage
by the press; b) the idiotic job
of talent scouting done by the
major labels, who favored us
with albums by Tuff Darts,
DMZ, and Pere Ubu (all of
which had one common
denominator — cheap notorie-
ty). while ignoring such ge-
nuinely talented bands as the

Mainwaring and

Real Kids and the Laughing
Dogs; ¢c) perhaps most impor-
tant of all, the Rolling Stones
and Bruce Springsteen, whose
albums and summer tours gave
credibility back to the
mainstream.

As of the present minute,
things appear to have reached a
status quo of sorts. Television
and the Talking Heads followed
up somewhat disappointing
debut albums with great second
efforts, thereby opening the
door for a ‘‘new’’ New Wave
characterized by highly polish-
ed arrangements’ instrumenta-
tion, and production. Mink
DeVille and the Shirts followed
up their Live at CBGB's debuts
with excellent first albums, and
the Stiff did succeed in captur-
ing the American market, at

A shits | le litt,

least to some extent.

So what about those
“cumulative effects’ spoke of
earlier?? Well, even though a
lot of people believe that talent,
like murder, will out, the facts
of life in the recording industry
seem to do an effective job of
stifling this tendency. In other
words, the chances of Blondie
or Talking Heads having singles
reach the top-40 without benefit
of the notoriety surround the
movement of which they were a
part would have been very slim.

Similarly, it’s not very like
that Columbia would have pick-
ed up the US. distribution
rights for the second albums by
the Clash or the Boomtown
Rats, and then proceeded to

This letter is for real. It is no parodist’s fan-
tasy. One breezy spring afternoon in 1968 as I
was walking to my car from the Bookstore a
piece of paper blew against my leg. More
from a sense of order and neatness than
curiosity I picked it up. Eleven years later it
has lost none of its realism and Yes —
War, Watergate and inflation
have swept across us since the distraught
parent wrote that letter. Yet, here is one of
our world’s eternal verities. And I assuredly
would predict that ten to fifteen years from

School, free of charge.

Welles’ Falstaff (1965) is a
free adaptation of several of
Shakespeare’s plays: Richard
II, Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2,
Henry V, and The Merry Wives
of Windsor. Welles came to
Falstaff after considerable ex-
perience with Shakespeare. In
1938, he produced a theatrical
adaptation of Shakespeare’s
historical tragedies in which he

played Falstaff; in 1948, he pro-

duced a movie version of
Macbeth in which he played the
title role; and in 1951, he
directed an adaptation of
Othello for film.

Welles reconceptualized the
material he used in Fallstaff
and made a_ non-academic
Shakespeare movie. It remains
first and foremost a Welles
film. One of a handful of
American ‘auteur’ directors
which today includes Altman,
Scorcese, and Kubrick, Welles

returns and gives added power.

in Falstaff to some of the
bravura camera techniques and
thematic concerns which ap-
peared most notably in_ his
masterpiece Citizen Kane
(1941). Thus, he presents a com-
plexly regarded world of ex-
cess, obsession, and paradox
through stunning work with
light and dark.

Welles shot Falstaff on loca-
tion in Spain and Switzerland
whose castles provides a
dramatic backdrop for this
moving meditation on the con-
flict between a private world of
taverns and wenches and public
work of political responsibility.
Elegiac in tone, the film focuses
largely on the great comic
figure of Falstaff, showing his
relationship with the young Hal
(who becomes Henry V), and
his death. John Gielgud plays
Henry IV, and Margaret
Rutherford is Mistress Quickly.

The Fiim Society will present
two more programs after
Falstaff. The first, in April, will
be a double bill featuring the
Maysles brothers short The
Running Fence (the Maysles
brothers were the directors of
Gimme Shelter), and the ex-
traordinary Cuban movie

ment. The second program, in
May, will feature the recent
Italian comedy We All Loved

wasn't up to. the
material. To begin with, Zoo
Story is Albee’s first play, or the
first to see production, at any
rate, having its premiere on 29
September, 1959, in Berlin, and
in a German translation. It was
about as far off Broadway as
anyone has managed to get,

Zoo Story provided a lot of ex-
perience for Albee, and one
look too closely to
discover the same flashes of wit
and black humor that have

But I was talking of first im-

pressions. I concluded that Zoo
Story’s purpose was to startle
an audience; and maybe to
mock.

It seemed as though the bitter
growls of an angry man were
acceptable things to produce in
front of an audience, and that a
valid function of the stage was
to present the weird and shock-
ing, for they had an absolute
virtue in that constitution.

It took a couple of years of my
own thought and experience,
and a number of re-readings of
the play, to make me change
my mind. Sure, I had always
sensed that the theme of the
play was, or was supposed to
be, ‘“‘love,’’ and that the unor-
thodox threatment of that sub-
ject was what made the play
special.

What I had to come slowly to
see, though, was that the play
was written to celebrate love,
not unorthodoxy, and to explore
the implications of emotional
and spiritual commitment a bit
further than others may have
done.

The fact that the play is the
record of an encounter between
an older man, named Peter,
and a young one, named Jerry,
who, after delivering a message
dealing with the centrality of
love to human existence’ dies, a
suicide, perhaps, or else just a
very surprised young man, has
convinced some readers to

Generals find lost

offense - win 15-10

by Doug Linton

The Generals bounced back
from a loss on Saturday to
smother the Blue Hens of
Delaware by a score of 15-10
yesterday on Wilson Field.
Many team members tried to
steal the show, but to no avail.
as the entire W&L squad ralliec
to raise their season record to
4-2.

George Santos put a John
Kemp pass into the back of the
net within the first minute of the
game, but Delaware retaliated
with three consecutive strikes.
W&L then capitalized on two ex-
tra man opportunities. John
Black scored unassisted before
he later passed off to Jay
Foster, who tied the game for
the Generals at 3-3 by the end of
the first period.

It took Jeff Fritz less than a
minute of the second quarter to
find Black open, who then net-
ted his second goal to give the
Generals a lead which they
were not to relinquish for the
rest of the day. The Blue Hens
managed to squeak two by Bob
Clements and a tough W&L
defense in the second quarter,
but this didn't phase Freshman
Rob Staugaitis in the least.
Staugaitis threaded four con-
secutive assists to Foster, John
Hooper, Sandy McDonald, and
Fritz to give the Generals an 8-5
lead at halftime.

Both defenses were solid in
the third quarter, as each team
scored only twice. It only took
the Blue Hens 18 seconds to
work one shot which found its
way past Clements, but on a
fast break exactly a minute
later, Black scored once more
on a feed from Foster. At 10:15
MeDonald tound Geott brent
open in front. Brent's goal was
followed by the Blue Hens’ se-
cond tally of the period, making
it 10-7 with only a quarter to
play.

Delaware used only 6 seconds
of an extra man situation to
make the score 10-8 at the start
of the final quarter. The
Generals responded with an ex-
plosive four goal surge. John
Herbert had his first goal of the
season off of a Roman Kupecky
pass, but only after Joe Ohve
made a great effort to keep the

action. W&L is now 9-2 and 12th in nation.

Coaches Jack Emmer and
Chuck O'Connell felt the same
way after the game — “‘It was
the medicine that the doctor
ordered!" They also feel that
the momentum will not only
carry over to Saturday's game
against Towson, but hopefully
throughout the rest of the
season.

“It was exactly what we need-
ed,’ said Emmer. “The guys
knew they had their backs to the
wall and they came out smok-
ing. Even though the Generals
gave up three early goals, they
picked up momentum and sus-
tained it throughout the game.
The plavers seemed to enjoy go-
ing back to a double high-post
offense, taking more shots
yesterday than they had in any
other game all season. The
picking and weaving called for
a lot of movement on the part of
the Generals, and they got this
motion, especially from their
middies.

Jay Foster had a good day,
despite two healing ankles. Ot
course he was sore at the end of
the game, but at least W&L had
won, and according to Foster,
“everything always hurts
worse When vou jose.’

Rob Staugaitis was mostly
happy that the team was able to
vet it all together. “We needed a
biz win today, and the fact that
13 of the 15 goals were assisted
says a lot. It makes the win
even bigger.’ Staugaitis too
was pleased with the midfield
motion, noting that “its a heck
of a lot easier to get the ball to

good protection from. Steve
Johnson, Jim Herbert, John
Hooper, Don Rigger and the
rest of the defenders.

The lacrosse team traveled to
Chapel Hill, North Carolina on
Saturday only to be snuffed by
the Tar Heels, 13-6. This makes
the series record between the
two schools 17-8, in favor of the
Generals.

North Carolina exploded for
six early goals. Jeff Fritz and
John Kemp each responded
with unassisted tallies for the
Generals, making it 6-2 at the
end of the first quarter.

In the second period the Tar
Heels scored three goals to the
Generals’ two. John Black took
a George Santos pass and hit for
W&L, with Kemp also netting
his second of the day. By
halftime the Generals faced an
unsurmountable 9-4 deficit.

W&L was shut out in the third
quarter. North Carolina added
two more to make it 11-4 with
only one quarter left to play.

The final quarter was the
closest of the game with each
team scoring twice. Black had
both W&L goals, taking passes
from Mike Pressler and Fritz.
Black's last goal came with on-
ly 12 seconds left in the game.

The Tar Heels changed the
Generals’ man down success
from 1 of 17 attempts to 5 of 25
trys. Even with other aspects of
their game failing, W&L had
previously been able to boast
great strength in this category.
But North Carolina was able to

Tennis team
ends week by
routing VMI 8-1

by Nat Lovell

The W&L tennis team is over
the hump of the season for now,
anyway, as the competition
should ease up some in upcom-
ing matches. Despite missing
various members due to
academics during the past
week, the netmen turned in
some close matches and won
two of five for the week.

On Wednesday, the Generals
took a trip down to Chapel Hill,
Hill, N.C., better know as
paradise. The long trip took its
toll, however, as they lost 9-0 to
UNC. At number one Stewart
Jackson could not get into the
match against Gary Taxman
and lost 6-1, 6-1. Doug Baker
was defeated by Neal Carl] 6-2,
6-1. Pat Norris was blown off
the court by Chris Fenichel 6-0,
6-0. Sumner Bouldin went down
to his old nemesis Tiger Buford
who won 6-0, 6-2. Nat Lovell
completely choked off his first
varsity match and lost to Jamie
Karson 6-0, 6-2. Tim Baird was
obviously watching other things
bounce besides tennis balls dur-
ing his match with Mark Trout-
man, the score was 6-0, 6-3.

At number one_ doubles,
Jackson and Norris lost to Tax-
man and Potts 6-1, 6-4. Gaker
and Bouldin were defeated by
Fenichel and Buford 6-4, 6-0.
Baird and Lovell fell to Heier

and Disco 6-4, 6-3.
Friday saw the netmen lose a
regretful match to George

Washington University by the
score of 5-4. Jackson got off toa
slow start and could not reeover

in time to take the match from
Dave Haggerty who won 6-2,
6-4. Shaw Cranfield continued
his. string of brilliance in
defeating Josh Ripple, 6-0, 6-3.
Doug Gaker came back to beat
Mike Yellin in a close three set-
ter 4-6, 6-4. Dave Constine was
defeated by Mark Bell 6-2, 6-2.
Norris fell to Mark Lichenstein
6-3, 6-3. In the final singles spot,
Wes Yonge was over-powered
by Larry ‘‘Get”’ Small 6-2, 6-2.

In doubles, Jackson and Cran-
field connected for a 6-2, 6-3 win
over Haggerty and Yellin. Nor-
ris and Schuler beat Ripple and
Small 6-3, 7-5. In the deciding
match, the lack of playing time
together showed as Gaker and
Yonge were beated by Bell and
Lichenstein 5-7, 6-3, 6-3.

Saturday, the netmen travel-
ed to George Mason University
and thrashed them 8-1. Jackson
won a close match over Mark
Miller 7-6, 6-4. Cranfield
dominated Ted Meyer 6-1, 6-3.
Gaker whipped Rich Smith 6-1,
6-3. Constine edged Rich Le-
moine 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Norris
recovered to win over John
Kennan 2-6, 6-3, 6-1. Yonge lost
the only match of the day at the
hands of Thomas Wallace 6-3,
3-6, 6-0.

The team went on to take all
three doubles matches to com-
plete the romp.

Monday, the tennis team suf-
fered defeat at the hands of Old
Dominion University 7-2 in a
match that might have gone the
other way. Cranfield turned in

record to 3-1 with
big win over EX&H

by Greg Branon
Despite running in extremely
poor track and weather condi-
tions, the Generals topped
Emory and Henry 8912 -55!2 in

last Saturday’s away dual
meet.

Coach Norris Aldridge
remarked, Overall it was

another good team effort. It was
an impossible day with track
conditions and rain.”

Those with first places includ-
ed Jack Norberg in the 100
meters, Chris Daniel in the
800m, Rich Bird in the 1500m,
Norvell Scott in the 110m high
hurdles, Greg Branan in the two
miles, the mile relay team of

Billy Morris, Dave Cordell, Ron
Calkins, and Russ Rector, Phil
Dunlay in the shot and Bob
Campbell in the pole vault.
Adding points by finishing se-
cond were Billy Morris-400m,
Henry Hairston-800m, Greg
Branan-1500m, Russ_ Rector-
110m high hurdles, Rob Kelley-
long jump, Norvell Scott-triple
jump, Scott Swope-javelin,
Hamilton Davis-pole vault’ and
Russ Rector-high jump.
Aldridge added, ‘‘Jack
Norberg was injured half way
through the meet and we had
good replacements. The
distance men came through as
they had to. Phil Dunlay was a
surprise as we had expected no

points in the shot put.”’

Those with overall good per-
formances’ were. Bill
Chesbrough ‘‘with a 120’ disc
throw,’’ Norvell Scott in all his
events, Scott Swope with “his
best throw ever,’ and the pole
vaulters ‘‘who swept the event **

This Friday the Generals
travel to Wake Forest for a
‘“‘non-scoring meet.” ‘‘It’s just
going to be a relaxed meet with
people going for time,” said
Aldridge. He added, ‘‘We’re im-
proving every week but its go-
ing to be tough to keep the edge
during exam week.’’ The
Generals will put their 3-1
record on the line against ODAC
teams after exams.

JV. lax team
finds success

by Ed Taylor

On Wednesday, March 21, the
JV lacrosse team lost a heart-
breaker, 12-10, to the Amherst
(Mass. ) College Varsity to even
their record at 1-1.

The Generals entered the
final period leading 8-7. They
scored two quick goals but then
watched as Amherst scored
four unanswered goals to win
the contest, 12-10.

Amherst hit the scoreboard
first but the Generals quickly
followed with a _ score by
freshman Timothy Monahan.
After Amherst scored twice,
W&L tied the score at 3-3 with
goals by junior Steve Herold
and sophomore Stuart Reinhoff.
The game rocked along with the
two clubs exchanging goals un-
til Amherst ran off their string
of four goals at the end of the
game.

W&L was led by Reinhoff,
Doug Seitz, Louis Close and
Scott Graham as they each
scored two goals. Monahan and

Herold contributed one goal
apiece. Freshman’ Bob
Carpenter also turned in a fine
game but did not score.

An interesting note on
Carpenter is that he was ex-
pected to play for the varsity
team this season but injured his
knee while playing fall lacrosse.
The coaches want to bring him
back from the injury slowly, but
he should still provide some fine
lacrosse this season.

Earlier in the team’s youny
season, the Generals defeated
the University of Rochester
Varsity, 15-8. As a result the
record now stands at 1-1 for
Coach Rolf Piranian’s team.

Led by the Tri-Captains:
sophomore Kevin Bell and
juniors Steve Herold and Doug
Seitz, the JV Generals should
experience an interesting and
successful season.

The team entertains Roanoke
on April 3, at home, beginning
at 3:00.

| Baseball : 2-3

by Chris Sisto

This year’s edition of the var-
sity baseball team has compiled
a respectable 2-3 record after
the first week of the season.
They opened this year with an
impressive 10-2 whipping of
Eastern Mennonite. Chip Childs
pitched well and Jeff Haggerty
belted the only home run of the
game. The next day, the
Generals split a doubleheader
against Longwood College.
W&L lost the first game 5-2

total minutes, but W&L failed to
capitalize each of the six times.
The Generals were hit eight
times for 6:30.

Goalie Bob Clements had 12
saves to bring his total up to 80
after five games. Ware Palmer
also saw a little action in the
cage for W&L and had one save
while allowing no goals. The
Generals continued their sloppy
clearing, failing 19 and making
26. North Carolina also failed a
few (16), but cleared suc-
cessfully 31 times. This loss
made the Generals 3-2 on the
year.

his usual victory, this time over
Bill Clark 6-3, 6-0. Gaker con-
tinued his history of troubles
versus foreign players as he lost
to Australian Colin Davis 6-1,
6-2. Constine, who is admittedly
having problems this season,
was crushed by Todd Furniss in
a double bagel job 6-0, 6-0. Baird
lost to John Harrison 6-1, 6-3.
Lovell let the cow off the hook
blowing a 4-1 lead in the second
set to lose to Jeff Berg 3-6, 6-4,
6-3. John Daniel found the grip
in time to defeat Tim Knerr 7-5,
6-2.

The team could not pull out
the three doubles matches
necessary to win the match, but
lost them all instead.

Tuesday, the team visited
VMI and came away victorious
8-1. Jackson blew away Bill
Vickers 6-1, 6-2. Cranfield came
back to beat Jeff Hamilton 4-6,
6-1, 6-4. Constine lost in three
sets to Louis Darden 2-6, 6-3, 63.
Norris burned Mare Withers
6-1, 6-3. Yonge.was leading Clay
Wommack 6-4 when the Keydet
developed elbow troubles and
had to default. Bob Schuler
hammered out a victory over
Paul Capozzoli 6-1, 6-1 in the last
singles match.

Jackson and _ Cranfield
coasted to victory in the first
doubles winning 6-0, 6-4. Norris
and Schuler won by default, and
Constine and Younge emerged
victorious over Capozzoli and
Guy Thone 6-3, 6-1.

The Generals took the second
game 4-1 when they came up
with three runs in the sixth inn-
ing of a seven inning game.

Their next opponent was
Randolph-Macon last Wednes-
day, in another double header.
The Generals dropped both
games by scores of 2-1 and 7-5.
In the first game, Childs played
a good game, giving up no earn-
ed runs, and Thad Ellis provid-
ed the only General run with a
home run. In the nightcap, the
Generals lost a 5-4 lead by giv-
ing up three runs in the fifth on
three fielding errors.

Coach Chuch Kroll is pleased
with his team’s play so far this
season. One problem for the
Generals has been working out
the early season fielding
mishaps, however.

The Generals’ next game is at
home this Thursday against
Liberty Baptist and their next
opponent, in another ODAC
game, is Hampden-Sydney in a
double header on Sunday. The
Generals are 1-2 in ODAC play
so far.

has taken less impressive roles
in Animal House, The Great
Train Robbery, and now Inva-
sion. His style is certainly
engaging and relaxed, but one
wishes it were put to better use
in characters other than the
burlesque ones he seems doom-
ed to portray.

Leonard Nimoy, as the token
intellectual in the film, seems to
be repeating himself. Spock
was a good character for Nimoy
back in the Star Trek days — no
emotion, no expression, just
wooden intonations — and he
was an appealing character.
Unfortunately, we can’t seem to
get the Spock out of Nimoy — he
tries, but his delivery still hits
the screen like petrefied wood.

- C’mon Leonard, loosen up!

Brooke Adams as one of the
last to get snatched is a beauty
in her own right, and she’s
enough of a human being to
notice when her husband’s per-
sonality beings to resemble an
ash tray. Her portrayal is warm
and believable, finally one of
the film’s strongest.

The supporting cast is geod,
with no maior faults or outstan-

Director Philip Karfman
pulls off some entertaining
camera work — his tendency to
linger on certain scenes gives a
needed element of suspense to a
film with many faults.

Ultimately, however,
everything combines to keep
the film from ever getting off
the ground. There are some
memorable scenes — a lonely
ship with mournful bagpipes
signals escape and then entrap-
ment. The electronic sound-
track is effective. Some bits of
acting are unusually good. But
the whole thing is wrecked first
by the preposterous choice of
San Francisco as the locale,
secondly by the ridiculous howl-
ing sounds made by the aliens,
and thirdly by several unex-
plainable gaps and holes in the
flow which somehow rob the
film of continuity.

In their attempt to clone the

lifeless, devoid of the qualities

This year’s student.art show
is most definitely an event
worth notice. In contrast to past
years, it is a very large and im-
pressive exhibition. There are
contributions by more than 40 of
W&L’s students. The show also
covers a wide range of media,
styles, and techniques. These
range from Oriental to Western
art forms, from modern to
traditional styles, and include
drawings, prints, -pastels, in-
kwashes, collage, and ‘pain-
tings.

Indeed, this profusion of ef-
fort spills over into the painting
studio from the gallery. It also
offers a truly striking contrast
between the various ap-
proaches which the artists take
in their expression.

Landscapes

There are quite a few attrac-
tive landscapes among the
show. Of special note are a
great number of works by
Marsh Dougherty. These are
truly handsome paintings, some
of which are landscapes of the
area. Mr. Dougherty does a fine
job of manipulating the
elements of his works and
shows a good deal of talent. His
compsotions are well thought
out out, balanced, and show
good use of color and knowledge
of space and perspective. They
convey a pleasant sense of calm
and repose.

Light and line

There are several other nice
landscapes, including Bruce
Whipple’s which subtlely utilize
light and line; Steve Handy’s,

which show a diversity of style

and skill from his almost poin-
tilistic ‘““Yellow Grove’’ to his
fine job on ‘Shore’; Steve

Hellberg’s expressive works;
and Bill Taylor’s emphasis on
limited color and shape. John
Dean also exhibits his highly

in a_ typically good work,
“Crooked Bridge.” Wildlife is
well represented in Robert Cle-
ment’s stark, clear paintings as
contrasted with Graham
Hudgins’ soft pastels.

The human figure has been
used for expressive, emotional
subject in several very different
ways in the exhibit. Phillip
Welch’s ‘‘Navahoes’’ concen-
trate on a rustic, weathered
look; Tim  Lobach chooses
distortion in his ‘“‘Three Black
Men,”’ Tommy Wornom relies

on facial expression and age to
conveny his fellings; while two
of Hugh Montgomery’s pain-
tings depend on silhouette for
expression and have an almost
graphic quality.

enough that we regard the event

Orientals

There are also quite a few ad-
mirable Oriental compositions
which provide a striking con-
trast to the remainder of the
show. Notable among these are
Jeff Fritz’s lovely flower pain-
tings in Chinese ink.

Other contrast is added by the
abstract works displayed. The
most unusual and striking are
Nicholas Martin’s non-objective
works, which suggest space and
light, as well as movement in
‘* 2”. Hunt Brown’s also take
an interesting form of bright
color and distorted shape in his
expression, and can be quite
shocking. It is very satisfying to
see these attempts to break
away from _ illusionary
representation and a concentra-
tion on personal vision and in-
ner feeling.

Drawing

There are also some very fine
drawings on exhibit, particular-
ly Rob Calvert’s and Howie Col-
lier’s works, as well as those of
Andy Holds, Taylor Freeman,

 

and Chase Nelson. These are
often very expressive and show
highly controlled light, shadow,
and depth.

This is not to ignore any of the
works on display. All are very
honest and dedicated attempts
to explore artistic forms and
techniques, as well as modes of
expressing the artist’s personal
style and vision. Many are par-
ticularly noteworthy in that
they are first attempts. They
also certainly show widespread
acceptance of the opportunities
available thorugh the W&L art
program and its teaching staff.
The exhibition will be on view
through Friday, April 13 and
most of the works are for sale.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

For those of you who didn’t make it last weekend,
you missed quite a show. Washington and Lee’s first
Muscular Dystrophy Dance Marathon was a big suc-
cess, raising more than three times the original $5,000
goal in pledges.

But it was more than the dollar figure that made the
Dance Marathon a success. It was the dancers—the
people who gave up most of their weekend for kids
who are confined to wheelchairs — Who, with their en-
thusiasm, made the Marathon a worthwhile and
memorable event.

Not enough has been said about the disease of
muscular dystrophy. It is a methodical, crippling
disease which slowly creeps its way up a youngster’s
body until the muscles in his legs, then his arms, and
finally his neck and literally deteriorate. Most vic-
tims of muscular dystrophy die from heart failure
because their heart muscles just aren’t strong
enough. Almost all of those afflicted with muscular
dystrophy die before they reach their twentieth birth-
day. Right now, there is no cure for this crippling and
tragically hereditary disease. But this is what the
Dance Marathon was all about.

Perhaps we were a little too optimistic last week
when we said apathy was fading at W&L. But the one
hundred or so people who were involved in the Dance
Marathon are from a different breed. It was positive-
ly exhilarating to watch them working so hard for a
very worthy and noble cause.

Jay Blumberg, the Marathon’s chairman and in-
spiration, really deserves his own editorial. His
boundless enthusiasm in keeping the dancers’ spirits
high and the show rolling were almost superhuman.

_Of course we cannot forget that Blumberg began
organizing the Marathon last fall and stayed with it
all the way, organizing the weekend’s events so that
they ran about as smoothly as they possibly could
have. Not enough can be said about the man in the
tuxedo, except that he should take much of the credit
for one of Washington and Lee’s prouder moments.

The Muscular Dystrophy Dance Marathon was a
demonstration of the sort of spirit that many of our
critical elders say our generation does not possess.
All of those who made the weekend a success are to be
commended—from the bands to the dancers to the
workers to the sponsors. The Lexington community
has every reason to be proud of the Dance Marathon
because what it really stood for was a basic human
selflessness and concern for our fellow man that, un-
fortunately, has become a rarity in today’s overly
self-centered society.

Letters To The Editor

Student condemns IFC Judicial

Board decision as a “Kangaroo Court”

To the Editor

In a time when the fraternity system and
the IFC are struggling for judicial credibility,
the “Kangaroo” court decision involving the
Delt House and pledge activities appears
more to be an edict resulting from the
Deltaphobia which pervades the “Hill”
rather than a_ responsible exercise of
undergraduate self-government. The reason I
refer to the IFC as a “kangaroo” court is
because the decision to make an example of
the Delt House was unquestionably made
before any evidence was presented before the
Judiciary Board...and I use that term loosely.
All the evidence which was presented before
the Judiciary Board points to the fact that the
Delt pledge activities were only one hour long
and pledges were warned far in advance that
activities would be held on the night in ques-
tion. Moreover, it seems dubious that having
pledge activities for one hour could seriously
impair the academic pursuits of any con-
scientious student.

In fact, there was no evidence presented
before the Judicial Board which pointed to
negligence on the part of DTD. Syd Farrar,
who is a member of the Judicial Board and

Notice

will be president next year, offered testimony
in which he stated that it was his belief that
the pledge in question was obligated to be at
the DTD pledge activities against his will, in
spite of the pledge’s personal denial of the
conjecture.

It seems readily apparent that if a member
of the Judiciary board had personal senti-
ment concerning any case, it would be the on-
ly responsible decision available to excuse
oneself from the proceeding. Also, since Far-
rar made these sentiments known in the hear-
ing, it follows that the decision to place DTD
on social probation was made before the hear-
ing was actually held. Ultimately, “heat from
the hill’’ is responsible for the actions of the
IFC because the IFC must prove themselves
worthy of self government, as President
Huntley stated in his message to the IFC. In
light of this deicsion, it appears that more
constructive criticism and less pressure
should come from ‘“‘the hill” or more
misdirected use of judicial power will become
the rule rather than the exception.

Sincerely,
Mike Foley
DTD 80°

Arthur Silver: Lexington’s

Oldest Living Legend

by Joe Scott

Arthur Silver, the 90-year-old
living legend of Lexington, is
leaving April-1 and is moving
north to live in Maryland.

He leaves with regrets but
says he will always cherish his
59 years of memories.

His jokes are unending. His
wit still keen. His eyes seem to
look right through you to
analyze your personality and
locate your funny bone. You
have. a_ distinct feeling of
respect.

“IT took all the prizes in my
school,’ said Silver, ‘‘but the
teacher made me put them
back.”’

Born March 3, 1889, in Nor-
wich, England, Silver came to
Lexington 55 years ago after
retiring from his Vaudeville
singing and dancing career.

Murphy

(continued from page 4)

sincere.’’ He says that it was a
good chance for W&L students
to get involved and express
their points of view.

Overall, he felt that the
University handled the situa-
tion very well...and the years
have not changed his feelings
since that May of 1970.

Another event in_ his
freshman year served to shape
Murphy’s whole attitude toward
W&L, involving one of the
courses he was taking. He had
not done well on a biology prac-
tical, and he did not go the pro-
fessor, because he was embar-
rased about the grade.

As it turned out, the professor
came to him and talked to him
about the low grade. After that
he “saw what W&L is all
about.’’ The school is small
enough that the professors can
deal with the students on a one-
to-one basis, Murphy stated. ‘‘It
is that kind of thing that makes
you want to be affiliated with
W&L.”

During his years as a student
at the University he par-
ticipated in intramural sports

‘| played for a week in almost

_ every town in America,”’ said

Silver, ‘‘when beer was two
cents a glass and a movie was a
nickle.”’

Silver opened a clothing and
haberdashery store on Main
Street (now the Printer’s Ink)
after five years of travelling the
roads to sell tailor-made suits.

“They couldn’t get over the
way I made those suits,’’ said
Silver. ‘‘Measuring came
naturally to me. I asked 0 a guy
once whether he dressed to the
right or to the left. He said,
‘make the pants baggy to the
knees.”’”’

‘T like to see people laugh,”’
said Silver. ‘“‘There’s not

enough of it. People need to stay |

in good humor, that’s my
philosophy.”’

‘I was a good singer and

and on the Contact committee.
In his free time he conducted
admissions tours for the
University. He had also been
president of his fraternity,
Sigma Chi.

After graduation from W&L,
he had planned to go to law
school ‘‘as most people did
then.’’ However, upon gradua-
tion a job at the University
opened up. He applied for it im-
mediately and withdrew his law
school application.

He started in July of 1973 in an
administrative position which
included Assistant Dean of
Students. However, the term of
the job was only two years.

After his two years had ex-
pired, he found a job at the
Citizen’s and Southern Bank of
the South, located in Atlanta,
Georgia. He worked there for
two years, until his present
position opened up.

Murphy started to work for
W&L in the fall of 1977. Ac-
cording to him, he has seen
some changes since he was a
student, especially along the
line of fraternity parties. He
said that mid-week parties are

dancer in my day,’’ continues
Silver, ‘‘my personality reflects
that. I can make up a yarn
anytime.”

“But enough of my career.
Who knows me_ anymore.
They’re all gone—six feet
under, you know.”

“A man my age should be
thankful he’s alive,’ said
Silver. ‘‘Age is like an autumn
tree, it just withers away.
Everybody’s born to die. I’ve
had a lot of fun in my life and I
still do. It keeps me going.”’
When you get old, though, you
forget things.

‘‘T walk almost every day and
see all my friends. Usually I eat
in the dining room—its only
$2.90. I don’t eat in ‘the pit’
(W&L’s Cockpit) anymore—
their vegetables are cold.”’

(continued on page 16)

Reflects On W&L

more obvious than when he at-
tended the University, which he
sees is causing increased fric-
tion between the students and
faculty.

Another change he has seen is
in the average student. He
stated that students today tend
to be more conservative than
his fellow students.

Presently students tend to be
more job oriented, but it is
understandable, he said. ‘‘It is
good in one way,” but he feels
that more students should get
out and participate in the com-
munity.

Murphy attributes the dif-
ference to the facts of the Kent
State affair dying down and the
end of the United States’ in-
volvement in the Vietnam War.

However, he added, that is
not to say that his classmates
were too radical. He explained
that they were more conscious
of social issues, because it was
a time when social issues were
the topic.

In the meantime, he enjoys
the atmosphere of the people
who work with him. ‘‘They area
great staff and President
Huntley and Dean John are the
greatest to work with and Mrs.
Miller (the secretary), well, she
keeps it all going.”

Murphy said that he decided
on W&L and Lexington because
of the friendly people and the
personal contact W&L provides.

‘‘You would be surprised. |
find that I am more active here
than when I lived in the big city
of Atlanta,”’ Murphy stated.

His future plans include W&L
for an indefinite length of time.
One may wonder about the op-
portunities for social contact
and friendship for a_ staff
member who has seen most of
his school friends move on —
yet is undemably ‘‘young”’ by
faculty standards. Still, Murphy
is content, developing friend-
ships with administrators and
students alike. Enjoying his uni-
que status as a “‘bridge’’ bet-
ween age groups, he concludes,
“T am perfectly satisfied with
the friendships that I have
now.”

Silver To Leave Lexington After 55 Years

(continued from page 15)

“Other than that, I just sit,”
he said.

“I get called for fraternity
scavenger hunts and parties,”’
said Silver. ‘‘I still like to do it.
I'll go and give them a little
show, and usually I'll have
them in stitches. I can’t walk
that much, though, so it’s not
that frequent anymore.”

“One time I remember was
when I was asked to go to a
fraternity house,”’ Silver said,’
“| didn’t want to walk the
distance so the young man call-
ed and paid for a cab.”

‘I’ve known a lot of people in
my time,” said Silver while
pulling out stacks of
photographs and newspaper
clippings.

“This one SayS to my pal -[r-
thur’signed John Warner. I have
pictures of my shop, my better
half, and acquaintances famous
or not.””

“These clippings are about
me. You see, it says right
there—e' a living legend? I
guess that figures. After all. I
was the smartest boy in my
class. Out of thirteen students

12 were girls. Can't read today,
though. I went to night school.
Oh, I can still keep them com-
ing.”

“There comes a time when
we all have to leave,” said
Silver. ‘‘I still don’t know where
I'll stay,” he added.

“I’ve got a lot of op-
portunities. Probably I'll go to
Rockville (Maryland) and live
with my brother. Or maybe to
Silver Spring to live with my
nephew. I’ve got until Tuesday
to get out,”’ Silver added

‘I think the students are a lit-
tle more behaved today,”’ Silver
said. ‘‘Everyone was just runn-
ing around and having a good
time back in the good old days.
Today there seems to be more
emphasis on studying. College
is too serious,”’ Silver said.

“You should be serious when
you go out into the real world.
It’s so much different out there.
You always have to look behind
you.”

“T never tell dirty jokes to
ladies,’ Silver said, “except
when I know they have peanut
butter legs. Once two ladies
came into the store and asked

me, ‘Mr. Silver, what are
peanut butter legs?’ (They're
easy to spread.) Well, I couldn't
keep a straight face. I may be
old, but I’ve got young ideas.”
‘Lexington has changed. The
people are different. Values
have shifted and there’s no
respect for the old,”’ he said. “A
new broom sweeps clean, but an

old one gets in the corners--
that’s something everybody
should keep in mind.”’

‘‘People have been good to me
and | appreciate it,’ said
Silver.

“For 40 years, Washington
and Lee was my bread and but-
ter. Without them I wouldn't
have existed. It’s time to move

Conducts Readership Studies

Hampden H. Smith III, assis-
tant professor of journalism at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, is the editor of a new semi-
monthly report on newspape
readership studies.

His six-times-a-year reports
will distill research articles on
readership which have been
published in academic and
scholarly journals. Smith is
undertaking the project on
behalf of the Virginia Press
Association, which will
distribute the series to its

“There is a lot of information

Smith as saying, “but editors
don’t have the time, resources,

cases to find it and use it.’’

Smith, a former copy editor

journalism techniques at W&L
