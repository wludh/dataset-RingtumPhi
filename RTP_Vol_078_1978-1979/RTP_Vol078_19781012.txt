Over half of freshmen
pledged to fraternities

by Charles Tucker

More than half of this year’s
freshman class has_ pledged
fraternities, according to Inter-
fraternity Council President
Jim Davis.

The report was issued by
Davis at an IFC meeting Tues-
day night, one day after
freshmen submitted their
preference cards to the council.

Also at the meeting, each
fraternity president reported
the number of freshmen his
house counted as_ pledges.
Sigma Phi Epsilon had the
largest number with 25. Pi Kap-
pa Phi and Sigma Chi were se-
cond with 23 pledges each. Kap-
pa Alpha, Lamba Chi, and Phi
Gamma Delta were tied for
third with 20 apiece.

Contact receives $4,500

In other business Tuesday
night, the IFC passed a motion
to grant $4,500 to the Contact
committee—a $500 increase
over the amount allotted last
year. The increase in funds was
necessitated by the rising fees
demanded by speakers.

Concerning Homecoming
weekend, Davis urged the
fraternities to use discretion in
regard to the length and loca-
tion of their parties.

He asked that parties
scheduled after the Student Ac-
tivities Board’s concert Friday
night be confined to fraternity
basements, and he reminded
the presidents that no Sunday
parties may be held at the
fraternity houses.

Noise ordinance

Davis announced that a deci-
sion was expected from the Lex-
ington City Council next Thurs-
day night on the IFC proposals
to limit partying in return for a
“relaxation”’ of the city’s noise
ordinance.

The IFC had offered to limit
weekday parties to just
Wednesday nights and ending
at midnight, and to have
weekend parties end at 1 a.
In addition to being lible to th
city for violations of the tim
restrictions, fraternities woul
also be subject to a fine fro
the IFC and, possibly, a revoc
tion of partying privileges.

The proposals were submi
ted to the City Council sever
weeks ago.

$100 fines for contact in the
freshman dorms _ between
freshmen and fraternity
members during a ‘“‘no- con-
tact’’ period

“‘Ungentlemanly conduct”’ on
the part of two members of
Delta Tau Delta resulted in a
$100 fine for that fraternity. A
complaint by members of Lam-
ba Chi, where the incident oc-
curred, prompted the action.

According to one member of
Lamba Chi, who was somewhat
reluctant to discuss the inci-
dent, junior Angus Finney and
sophomore John Boger, both

‘Delts, were ‘‘dirty-rushing
girls” at a party at the Lamba
Chi house approximately three
weeks ago.

Boger stated that he and Fin-
ney were told to leave the party
when members of Lamba Chi
“got mad at us because we were
talking to girls.”’ After being
asked by the president of Lam-
ba Chi, Boger said that he and
Finney promptly left.

Finney and Boger intend to
appeal the IFC’s decision.

The Ring-tum Phi Interviews

 

Dr. Shillington:

For eighteen beautiful women
and their dates, the most
memorable experience of this
weekend’s Homecoming
festivities will be the selection
of Washington and Lee’s
Homecoming Queen.

The judging process. will
begin at 3 p.m. Friday when
each contestant is interviewed
for approximately 10 minutes.
Balloting for the winner will be
on a ten point scale, and the
three highest vote-getters will
be the queen and her court.

Following the interviews,
each nominee and her escort is
invited to attend a Reunion
cocktail party at the Alumni
House. After cocktails, there
will be a buffet dinner in honor
of the nominees.

The coronation of the Queen
and her court will take place at
halftime of the W&L-Hampden-
Sydney game.

As is tradition, Dr. James K.
Shillington will crown this
year’s winner and her court
with the style and flair that has
become his trademark. For this
reason, the Ring-tum Phi inter-
viewed Dr. Shillington about his
thoughts on Homecoming and
his unique role in the crowning
ceremonies.

Question: Dr. Shillington, just
how many Washington and Lee
Homecoming Queens have you

crowned?
Shillington: According to my
records, I started in 1963. I think
that’s all of them; every year
since then I’ve been crowning
Homecoming Queens.
Somewhere along the line |
began to help choose them — I

Q: In your opinion, have the
girls been getting better look-
ing, are we getting higher quali-
ty nominees?
Shillington: No, I think they’re
about the same. How could one
see improvement? Human be-
ings are human beings.
Q: Well, I meant aesthetically.
Shillington: Obviously there’s
ups and downs in aesthetics.
Some years there are very
beautiful ones and some years
there aren’t. How can you tell
until you see the crop?
Q: In your mind has W&L ever
picked a Homecoming Queen
who was undeserving of the
honor?
Shillington: Oh, gallantry for-
bid!
Q: Do you see a pattern in a cer-
tain fraternity that can pick the
beauties year after year?

Shillington: I don’t think so. I
think the honor has moved
around quite a lot.

I really haven’t seen any
trend of any kind. One year

college goes, I haven’t seen any
lasting drift from one girl’s
school to the next.

Q: Do you forsee another goed
Homecoming selection coming
up Saturday?

Shillington: I have nothing to
lose but to gain, I think.

Q: Why did you leave the judg-
ing process?

Shillington: Well, that got com-
plicated. At that time I was din-

Purvis cleared of charges

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment cleared officer Jack Pur-
vis of the charges brought
against him by Washington and
Lee senior Bill Tucker for his
conduct during Tucker’s arrest
on charges of speeding and
driving under the influence of
alcohol on the morning of
August 31.

In his letter to Tucker, Police
Chief James A. Kirby quoted
from the final paragraph of the,
investigating officer’s report:
“During my investigation,
which was thorough and com-
plete, I could not find anything
that proved Sergeant Purvis
conducted himself in an un-
professional manner regarding
this incident. I feel that
Sergeant Purvis should be
cleared of the allegations plac-
ed against him by William B.-
Tucker on September 25, 1978.”

Kirby said in the same letter
that he ‘‘concurred”’ with the in-
vestigating officer’s report. The
investigation of the complaint
was conducted by Lt. B. M.
Beard.

When Tucker went to court on
the charges, the driving under
the influence charge was
dismissed and the speeding was
reduced from 41 m.p.h. to 34
m.p.h. ina 25m.p.h. zone.

Asked for his reaction to the
conclusions of the police in-
vestigation, Tucker said,” I
asked Chief Kirby to investigate
the matter to his satisfaction
and decided in advance to agree
to any decision that was made. I
was disappointed that his letter
did not address any of the

specific points that my com-
plaint raised, but I am ap-
preciative of the time and effort
that the investigation required
and of the willingness of Chief
Kirby to consider the matter.’’
“Tam clear in my mind of the
sequence of events and realize
the limitations of an informa-
tion gathering process if that in-
formation is based on word

against word,”’ Tucker said.

“T feel that I was possibly
harrassed by an officer on that
night, but am eager to forget
the incident and return back to
my studies,” he continued.

Tucker then asked if ‘‘anyone
would like to purchase a late
model Chevolet with Texas
plates for a reasonable price?”’

ing with the KAs, and when the

KAs would win, I would be ac-.

cused of tilting the whole thing.
It seemed to me it was fairer
if I did not do the judging. I sup-
pose since I’ve stopped dining
with them that I might well
start again, but I don’t think I
will.
Q: But don’t you think the judg-
ing process might be enhanced
by your experience?

Shillington: I doubt it. I doubt it.

I can’t tell, I have the very best
of everything really: I don’t
have to take the blame,

It (the homecoming Queen
ceremony) has improved vastly
since they give a court to the
queen and now there’s three to
kiss instead of one. That im-
proves things quite a lot.

It would probably be just as
well to kiss them all, but we
don’t have the time...

The Student Activities Board
has been the object of much
criticism over the past few
years because of the quality and
type of concerts they sponsor.
Some people are dissatisfied
with the bands brought here;
others are sure that better

bands could play here wichout
overturning the budget.

According to Mike Cappeto,
head of the University Center,
there are four types of bands:
First, there are the up-and-
coming or the over-the-hill acts
which often play at fraternity
houses. Examples of these
bands would be Bryce Street
and the Drifters, both of which
will appear for less than two
thousand dollars. A more ex-
pensive (approximately
seventy-five hundred dollars)
category of artists is the one
from which performers are
habitually drawn for concerts.
They would include Harry
Cahpin, the Atlanta Rhythm
Section and Orleans.

Bands in the third category
very rarely come here. The

Spinners are in this group. The
expense for this type of group is
from ten to fifteen thousand
dollars which is beyond the per-
missable except on rare occa-
sions. The entire budget for the
SAB is $30,000.

The final groups are in the
“big name” category. Groups
like Fleetwood Mac, et al. hard-
ly ever play colleges because it
does them no good. When they
go on tour, (usually three times
a year for from three to twelve
weeks), they would want to pro-
mote their albums, travel com-
fortably and make money. As a
result, they play large cities
where the publicity potential is
very good.

Scheduling is another pro-,
blem that the SAB faces. Under

Cappeto comments on SAB bands

last year’s new rules put for-
ward by the E.C., the SAB has
to hold public meetings while
deliberating about bands. For
this reason, many opportunities
are lost. Bill Tucker, last year’s
co-chairman of the SAB and
current Vice-President of the
E.C., said, “‘I think that the co-
chairmen should be able to look
at a band without a public
meeting if the merits of that
band and student opinion have
been adequately discussed.”

To summarize, expecting big
name bands to come here
seems an exercise in futility.
Also, smaller but more frequent
concerts appear to be the trend.
Even so, if the factions among

‘the student body ever get

together, we might have a fan-
tastic year.

WE&L freshmen at |
the R:E'L: Hotel

by Ray McNulty

Because of a very large
freshman class, Wahington and ,
Lee University is forced to
house freshmen in an_ off-
campus hotel.

The second and third floors of
the Robert E. Lee Hotel now
serve as a dormitory for the
group of W&L freshmen. The
hotel is located on Main Street
in Lexington, three blocks from
the W&L campus.

The 31 freshmen are under
the tuidance of dorm counselors
Keith Romich and Kevin
McGowan. The freshmen share
the hotel with a group of 15
elderly people who live on the
fourth and sixth floors. Four-
teen W&L upperclassmen have
rooms on the fifth floor.

Dorm Counselor Kevin
McGowan said that most of the
freshmen were “‘reluctant and
pessimistic” about living in the
hotel when they first arrived in
Lexington. He said now that
they have lived there for a few
weeks they all prefer living in
the ‘‘Robert E. Lee.”’

When asked if there were any
problems with the unusual
situation between college
freshmen and the elderly people
living in the hotel, McGowan
said that there have not been
any problems so far and he feels
he has a solution should a pro-
blem arise. ‘‘Quiet hours’’ in the
hotel are on weeknights starting
at 7:30 p.m. until 9 a.m. There
are no quiet hours on weekends.

McGowan’s solution to the
possible conflict with the elder-
ly neighbors is to develop some
kind of friendship with them. He
has all of hiXfreshmen talking
to the older folks whenever they

see them in their spare time.
McGowan said that the
freshmen plan to have a Bingo
session for the older folks
sometime around the
Thanksgiving holiday.

The freshmen living ‘in the
hotel seem to get along very
well. They have all donated
money for a hall refrigerator.
McGowan said that in their
spare time the freshmen usual-
ly play cards and drink beer.
“It’s a really close-knit group)’
said McGowan, “It’s like a
fraternity.”

The freshmen at the ‘‘Robert
E. Lee’’ are also planning a
‘hall party’? with one of the
dorm sections at Sweet Briar. A
cookout on the balcony of the
hotel is also a possibility for
later in the semester.

McGowan said that he has not
had any trouble with the
freshmen so far. ‘“They’re a lit-
tle rowdy, but they know when
they can fool around and when
they can’t,” he said.

All of the freshmen interview-
ed said they liked living in the
hotel and enjoyed their unusual
situation. The only complaint
was about the “‘long walk to the
gymnasium and dining hall.”’

rooms with the additional lux-
ury of private baths. ‘‘At least
you don’t wake up to a cold
floor,’ said one freshman.
Another freshman said that the
girls who came to visit liked the
hotel rooms much more than
the dorm rooms.

Ejay Clark, a freshman who ~
lived in the dorms for two weeks
during summer football prac-
tice, said that there’s no com-
parison between the rooms.
“This is a lot better,” said

Clark.

This is not the first time that
W&L freshmen have had to live
in the Robert E. Lee Hotel. The
same situation occured two
years ago when the freshmen
class was too large for the dor-
mitories. The situation worked
out well then and it appears that
history will repeat itself this
year.

E.C. appropriates
no money

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee ap-
propriated no money at their
meeting Monday night.

A request was heard from a

_ new film society for over $1,000
to finance four very ‘‘special’’
films, however.

Jay Diesing, a spokesman for
the group, submitted a ‘‘ten-
tative’’ budget to the E.C. so the
committee could ‘‘consider the

price of the films and the type of
films we are interested in show-
ing.”’

Among the films listed by the
group were: Cries and
Whispers by Bergman, Day for
Night by Truffaut, and Love
and Arnarchy by Wertmuller.

Carren Kaston, assistant pro-
fessor of English and organizer
of the film society, told the E.C..,

Rupert Latture:
A Tradition of Service

by Ned McDonnell

Many of us feel a twinge of college pride when
we think of Rupert Latture, the very warm yet en-
ticingly aloof gentleman who works in the
anteroom of President Huntley’s office. Not only
the witness of events dating back some six
decades, the man himself is one of W&L’s pro-
udest traditions.

Mr. Latture symbolizes a rarely seen but
stimulating mixture of traditionalism and in-
dependent thinking, of idealism without illusions,
and most of all (and most difficult for me as the in-
terviewer ), of a strong and sincere humility.

From Latture and his co- founders, Omicron
Delta Kappa next took root in Johns Hopkins
University and then beyond to the University of
Pittsburgh. From these beginnings, the
honorary fraternity has established itself in the
furthest reaches of the nation, at 250 or more
schools. But, throughout this prosperous growth,
neither W&L nor Rupert Latture have faded into
ODK obscurity. When the school’s bicentennial
rolled around in 1949, ODK honored the event by
constructing the circular memorial by the supp-
ly store—another design by Latture. This time,
the older but every bit as enthusiastic Latture

didn’t have to contend with a boring philosophy
class but an obstinate W&L ODK president who
wanted the circular bench elsewhere. Latture
won out and the construction began in 1950. The.
national ODK remembered W&L once again in‘
1964, the fraternity’s fiftieth anniversary, by
placing a plaque honoring the founders in Wahs-
ington Hall.

 

By fusing these various qualities into a rarely
failing energy, Mr. Latture has done much over
the years to make life at W&L more fulfilling for.
him...and for us. The most evident Latture con-
tribution is, of course, Omicron Delta Kappa. Bet-

W&L, Mr. Latture, along with his roommate and
“warm friend’’ J. Carl Fischer, concocted after
many conversations the idea for this contributory
organization. As Mr. Latture himself says, ‘“‘We
were both idealistic in that we wanted to make a
contribution to the improvement of life for the stu-
dent body and of value to the University.” To
fulfill this dream, the two young men gathered
with them ten fellow students, two faculty
members, and the president of the University to
launch ODK.

The charter members started a fraternity to
honor and coordinate different types of leadership
on campus. These leaders, (from scholastics,
athletics, public speaking, publications, and the
arts) in the junior and senior classes were tapped
into the feldgling honor society. ‘By bringing
together leaders of these different phases of stu-
dent life,’ Latture recalls, ‘‘they could form a new
and exciting group.’’A few faculty members were
included to keep the merger of these spheres of
campus activities from falling apart under the
strains of divergent interests.

The young Latture, pressed for time and bored
by a philosophy class, designed the ODK key by
using the outline of two different coins, unequal in
size, as his drawing tools and a post card announc-
ing a YMCA (of which he was president in his
years here as a student) meeting as the paper. Ap-
parently, Mr. Latture used the coins effectively
for his design was selected over several others at
the next ODK meeting.

Behind the more conspicuous accomplishment
of being a principal founder of ODK, one finds a
humble man who has, (as Bill Buckley says of
his old school) ‘‘an almost irrational fondness”’
for Washington and Lee. After serving in France
during the Frist World War as an interpreter for

 

 

disassociated from their university, and the
more modern student body and administration.

Over the years, Rupert Latture has seen
Washington and Lee evolve from a small isolated
college of about six hundred students to a
radically different school today. Gone are the
days, now fond memories of Mr. Latture, of crew
races on the Maury during the Commencement
Exercises for the entertainment of the parents of
graduating seniors. The boarding houses of the
early years of this century which served students
like him are now only a murky spectre in the
minds of a few alumni. Rupert Latture saw the
end of the boarding houses come in the twenties
with the advent of the residential fraternity
system started by Beta Theta Pi around
1920-1922. The Saturday night meetings of the
Graham-Lee and of the Washington Literary
Societies (public speaking clubs) have withered
away in the face of increased student mobility
and road trips.

But Rupert Latture has not lamented the
changes — except for a decline in the dressing
tastes of the students. But, in light of the swing
back to more conservative dress in the last cou-
ple of years, Mr. Latture happily jests that there
is still hope for a dapper student body reminis-
cent of the 1930s... Otherwise, Mr. Latture
observes the changes during his sixty three
years in Lexington with his characteristic
stocism: ‘Some ways are better and some ways
may not be; I don’t really care because | take
things the way they come.” Of al) the people on
this campus, he can afford to feel confident and

The History of W&L’s computer

Second In A Series

by Stuart Snyder
At this time the campus com-
puter is used for a number of
jobs, from academics to admis-
sions. So, whether a student is
in Accounting, Chemistry,
Economics, or Politics, he will
run into the computer. Each
department utilizes the com-

puter ina different way.

For example, the Politics
Department programs the com-
puter with information from
previous elections such as: ef-
fects of the unions on an elec-
tion, the politician’s
background, and the results of
the election. The student then
analyzes this data and forms his
own conclusions about how and
why the voters voted a specific
way. Thus, with the aid of the
computer he arrives at the con-
clusion in a much shorter period
than was the case with the old
computer.

On the other hand, the
Chemistry Department
employs the computer to
calculate various complex pro-
blems.

The Administration uses the
computer for materials from
Admissions, Alumni, Business,
Buildings and Grounds and the
Registrar’s Office. It makes
your schedule and even records
your grades! All together it has
a much greater capacity than
the obselete IBM1130 and
PDP8E, the former work
horses.

A unique feature of the com-
puter is the ability to program
games into the memory. By giv-
ing the computer the correct
user number, which acts as a

pass word, everyone can play
any of the three games now in
the memory.

The games include: Adven-
ture, Hangman, and Market.
Adventure is a_ unique
underground adventure in
which the player commands the
computer through an
underground maze of surprises.

Hangman is a word guessing
game in which the computer
gives the player a word without
the letters. The object is to get
the word in three to ten guesses.
The player sets his own guess-
ing limits.

Market is a game simulation
of the stock market in which the
player is-given: six stocks and
their prices, $10,000 to buy the
stocks, and thirty ‘‘days’’ to
make a fortune.

There are other games plann-
ed for the near future. For all
fans, Star Trek is very much
alive. A game by that name is to
be unveiled soon

History

Computers have been at W&L
since the university acquired an
IBM 1620 in 1961. Back then
there was no need for a large
computer; it was used strictly
for the academic and ad-
ministrative needs of the
university.

In 1968 the university pur-
chased an IBM 1130, which was
a little larger in capacity, This
machine is still being used until
all the Administrative  in-
formation can be transferred to
the new computer. During

1970 the university bought from

the school.

The PDP8E was finally put
out of public use after the Har-
ris 125 replaced it. It is now
operated by the Psychology
Department.

FUTURE

According to Dr. Imeson it is
hard to predict the ultimate use
for the computer, but he men-
tioned one certain result.There
will be a general increase in
users, not so much an increase
of various programs as an in-
crease in users. The degree of

this is dependent upon the in-
dividual teaching techniques
that the faculty will choose to
follow.

Mr. Kemple adds that the

future faculty use of the com-
puter will probably be along the
lines of teaching, where the stu-
dent will go to the terminal and
receive individual instruction in
ithe course he is taking.

Homecoming
Brings Bands

by Spencer Leffel

A variety of live music is
scheduled for this Homecoming
Weekend, with two bands slated
for Friday night, October 13,
and -another scheduled for
Saturday afternoon, October 14.

The Student Activities Board
will feature Song Bird, a rock
band, and The Impressions, a
soul band, in Doremus Gym-
nasium at 8 p.m. on Saturday.

Song Bird, a versatile group
from the Carolinas, will lead-off
Friday night’s concert. Featur-
ing a three-piece horn section,
the band plays not only rock and
roll, but funk, funk-jazz and
discoas well. —

Besides the origanal material
it performs, Songbird’s sources
for its music vary from ZZ Top
and Eagles to the Crusaders
and Earth, Wind and Fire. ;

The Impressions will headline
Friday night’s show. An
established soul act, the Im-
pressions are a vocal group of
the Motown shcool.

Both groups were among the
most expensive considered by
the §.A.B. Admission to the con-
cert is free. No alcoholic
beverages will be permitted in-
side the gym, and plice officers
will be present. to enforce the
‘dry rule.

Having played here before,
the Bryce Street Band is
familier to many Washington
and Lee students. The band
plays main-stream rock, featur-
ing music by such artists as the
Beatles, Steely Dan and the
Beach Boys. They will appear
on Saturday.

“Class passes’ will be re-
quired for admission to the
grain party. Students may still
purchase the passes tomorrow
afternoon from 12 until 2 p.m.
No tickets will be sold at the
door. Due to the ABC ruling, the
Zollman’s Pavillion event will
be restricted to Washington and
Lee students and their guests.

 

: Headlining Friday night's Homecoming concert is the noted soul band, The-Impressions.

Happy Traum will appear in
the Cockpit on Wednesday
night, October 25. To most peo-
ple involved in the music scene,
his is a familiar name. His vast
experience in the world of folk,
blues, and country music, and
his versatility as a singer, in-
strumentalist and songwriter,
have brought him critical ac-
claim across the U.S., England,
Europe, and Japan. This past
summer he toured all the major
cities of Europe. In addition to
his recordings and concert ap-
pearances (both solo and with
the Woodstock Mountain
Review), you've heard his
guitar and banjo backing up
Bob Dylan, Jean Ritchie, John
Sebastion and others, and seen

him name on over a dozen best’

selling guitar instruction books.
One of the most popular of these
books is Bluegrass Guitar,
published by the Oak
‘ Publishing company, but also
popular are his instructional
books for beginning guitarists,
especially children ...For years
he contributed a regular col-
umn in Guitar Player

Magazine, illustrating many ex-
amples of guitar techniques and

styles. He has also established °

Homespun Tape Service which
features lessons on guitar (folk,

Currnetly the big one is Who'll

further by becoming a thriller

Nick Nolte churns out a fine

It is not uncommon for the
Bookstore to receive requests
for these kinds of ‘‘study aids.”’
This usually occurs as exams
rise up near and large. But this
year students and cadets have
already begun asking for them.
The cold breath of grades, like
the frosty air outside, seems to
have sharpened early this Oc-
tober.

The volume of reading in
many courses appears to loom
like an avalanche. The number
of pages to be read in a random

selection of required texts
shows a span from 400 to 4,000
pages per course. Time for a se-
cond reading? Time to stop for
thought or wonder? No: more
pages to be turned. Is the range
of experience broad enough to
find bright links with the vistas
on the printed page? So it is not
at all unnatural to want to seek
what others have written about
a particular book. Especially
when a cold-eyed dean of ad-
missions at a law school, say,
may someday look hard at that

damn grade.

However it seems to me that
‘‘study-aids’”’ give pre-chewed,
pre-digested, low-protein food
for thought. There is little to
chew on, little to provide
energy, and very little to grow
on. Junk foods. Hence our reply
to those requests: ‘‘We only
serve it straight here.’’ So, risk

and swallow deep!

Despite a poor audience turnout, the Doobie |
Brothers managed to put on one of the better
rock and roll shows I’ve seen in recent months
last Thursday at the Roanoke Civic Center. The
reasons for the low attendance (the place was
half full at the most) are a bit hard to fathom- the
Doobies played about this time last year to an ex-
cellent crowd. I’d be tempted to guess that it’s
because the band’s last record, Livin’ on the
Fault Line, was a commercial failure compared
to their previous efforts. Most importantly, it
had no monster hit singles, and Roanoke fans are

nothing if not singles-oriented.

The show began pretty much on time with an
‘opening set from British hard rockers UFO: A-
Plus For effort, B for instrumental talent, and
the big D for quality of material. This band’s
songs just didn’t cut it for the most part, and
despite the fact that they performed the sort of
sledgehammer rock ‘n roll that I’ve seen go over
well in Roanoke, UFO’s reception was lukewarm

at best.

AREOSMITH
Enough of past concerts, and on to the future.
For the first time in nearly two years, Aerosmith
will be performing in this area, taking the stage
.at the Roanoke Civic Center next Thursday, Oc-
tober 19, at 8:00 P.M. The 1976 show was a
sellout, and this one should be the same despite a

Sculptor visits W&L

by Don Noble

W&L was visited this week by
H.I. Gates, the artist whose
sculpture is currently on exhibit
in duPont Gallery. Aside from
attending the opening reception
on Tuesday, Mr. Gates spoke to
several of the art classes about
his work.

Mr. Gates received his
bachelors and masters degrees
form the University of Illinois
and is currently an assistant
professor of sculpture at
George Washington University
in D.C.

He has shown his work for the
past 20 years throughout the
U.S. and in Europe, and has
won many prizes and awards.
Mr. Gates was trained during
the era of abstract expre-
sionism and consequintly began
his career by showing works in
this style.

Although he was successful,
he felt that this was not for him
because it was an imitation of
another artist’s style. Thus he
set out to discover an art form
which could convey his own
ideas.

Content is important

Gates feels that technique is
not that important; that content
is the most important aspect of
an artists work. ‘An artist
should be in search of subject
matter. He should have his own
statement—something he wants
to say.”” He believes that his
abstract expressionist work
‘thad no where to go because it
was taken out of context.” The
great change in Gates’ work
took place when he moved to
Maryland. He had always been
fascinated by ruins and decay-
ing structures.

One day while walking in the
woods, he discovered a ruined
pre-Revolutionary War iron
works. This structure inspired
him to develop the art form
which he uses today. His first
works in this style, such as the
furnace and fortress series,
tried to suggest the essence of
these objects. They are not sup-
posed to look exactly like ruins,
but instead to convey the feeling
of them.

I’m turned on by rusting
locomotives and _ ruined
factories— by the essence that
exists around these places. I’m

ing motifs which can be found in
them, which progress through
the various stages of his art.

But perhaps most interesting
is seeing the products of an ar-
tist’s imagination over a 16 year
period of his lifeSeeing how the
styles and techniques have
changed as he has expressed his
personal statement in many dif-
ferent ways.

DAVE EDMUNDS: TRACKS
ON WAX4
Swan Song SS8505

Dave Edmunds has for many
years been the inspirational
father figure and guilding force
behind the British rock revival
(or ‘‘power pop,’’ as it has come
to be called) scene. He, even
more than Nick Lowe, is
responsible for the recent suc-
cesses of such artists as
Graham Parker and Elvis
Costello. An accomplished
guitarist, singer and producer,
he has been making highly
entertaining records of his own
for the past 10 years, en-
compassing everything from
rockified versions of classical
themes to Dylan covers to
recreations of old Phil Spector
productions. |

The key to Edmunds’ talent is
that, despite the inherently

derivative nature of his
material, he has always manag-
ed to maintain a careful distinc-
tion between impersonation and
mere imitation. He has an un-
canny ability to recreate the
sound of almost any significant
slice of rock’n’roll history, be it

‘rockabilly, high pop a-la the

Four Seasons, or his all-time
favorite, Chuck Berry. His
records have always been great
fun, but he consistently leaves
me with the nagging feeling
that some crucial element (the
spark of originality, perhaps?)
is missing.

All this goes by way of in-
troducing his latest album,
“Tracks on Wax 4’’. Perhaps it
shouldn’t be surprising, con-
sidering the recent failures of
Edmunds alumnae Parker and
Costello, that Dave’s newest ef-
fort is also probably his weakest
to date. Whatever the reason,

the material (which, for a
change, is mostly original) is
distinctly substandard, and the
arrangements frequently sound
hackneyed, something I never
thought about any of Edmunds’
previous albums. On the other
hand, the production is magnifi-
cent, and there are a few killer
cuts, mostly notably ‘‘Reader’s
Wives” and’It’s My Own
Business,’’ an obscure Chuck
Berry tune. For pure fun, Dave
Edmunds still can’t be beat, but
be forewarned that there are a
few more weak spots than usual

the ability to exhibit the
disciplined intensity with which
Nolte attacks this final, lone
walk through the desert.

Michael Moriarty and Tues-
day Weld are both adequate in
their roles as the husband and
wife hopelessly caught between
crooks and crooked cops.
Moriarty, through a large part
of the film, seems wooden and
incapable of showing emotion,
but his placid facade eventually
reveals a painful concern for his
heroin and his friends. Weld af-
fects the viewer in the same
way, but she fails to deliver a
sharp character. Her _per-

as vague as her character in the

the final scenes. One supposes
that the sadistic policemen
were provided for comic relief,
but their Cheech and Chong
routine is played out much too
long.

The above facotrs contribute
to bring the film down, but all is
not lost. Who'll Stop the Rain is
untimately saved by its direc-
tor, Karel Reisz. His deep-
focus, wide-angle style allows
the viewer to experience the
most mediocre scenes with new
enthusiasm. A grey-toned color
treatment gives the film a stark
edge of reality, while the well
controlled camera motion
smoothes out the rough spots in
scripting. yi

Finally, Who'll Stop the Rain

becomes a_ satisfying film
because of its technical
superiority. This, combined

with Nolte’s riveting per-
formance at least gives the film
an edge over the rest of its
lackluster competition.

Handelman publishes

paper on Chinese
foreign policy

A research article by a
Washington and Lee University
political scientist on the role of
multi-national corporations in
the formulation of mainland
China’s foreign policy has been
published in the new issue of
“Asian Survey,”’ a scholarly
journal of contemporary Asian
studies.

The article is by Dr. John R...

Handelman, assistant professor
of politics and East Asian
specialist at W&L. His article,

“Penetrating the Bureaucracy:

of the Chinese People’s
Republic: The Role of * Non-
National Actors,” attempts to
assess the degree to which non-
governmental figures influence
official foreign policy, with par-
ticular attention to the develop-
‘ment of the Chinese petro-

chemical industry.

Handelman will also deliver a
paper on a similar topic at the
annual meeting of the Southern
Political Science Association
next month in Atlanta. In his
paper, “China’s Compatibility
Within a Comparative Foreign-
Policy Framework,’ he ex-
amines the extent to which
China is behaving in a more
“ordinary”’ fashion.

Handelman, who holds a
Ph.D. is from Syracuse Univer-
sity and has undertaken post-
doctorate study in Asian politics
under a grant to W&L from the
Mary Babcock Reynolds Foun-
dation, teaches courses in
American foreign policy and in-
ternational relations as well as

‘in Asian politics.

W&L goes 0-5
in football

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
Generals went from bad to
worse last Saturday when they
lost to the Maryville Scots, 13-0.
The Generals, now 0-5 on the
year, played their most listless
game of the season, and if this
game was any indication of
what the future holds, then W-L
will finish 0-10.

Against Maryville, the
Generals were plagued by the
same two basic problems-a lack
of offense and a defense that
played well but could not pro-
vide any spark. “Our team
wasn’t mentally prepared for
this game’’, said Coach Gary

Fallon. ‘Our attitude was -

wrong and we didn’t play well.”

Particularly disappointing
was the play of quarterback
Rich Hachenburg. In his first
career start, Hachenburg com-
pleted three of eight passes for
22 yards and one interception,
while W-L was being shut-out
for the first time this year. “Our
offense needs more consisten-
cy,” said Fallon. ‘We need
more consistency in our passing

game, and our quarterbacks
must produce more points.”’

The offense was so flat that
Fallon tried three
quarterbacks and none were ef-
fective. Scott Scope, replacing
Hachenburg, completed one of
four passes for seven yards,
while Randy Austin’s: lone
throwing attempt was_ in-
tercepted. Overall the quarter-
backs were four of thirteen, for
29 yards and two interceptions.

The two interceptions, along
with two fumbles, gave the
Generals four turnovers for the
day, and 17 in their last three
games. “I feel that the tur-
novers are preventing us from
winning.’’ said Fallon.
‘‘Whenever we turn it over, we
stop our momentum and place
more pressure on our defense.”’

The defense has been playing
well under this ‘‘pressure,”’
however. Against Maryville,
the W-L defense allowed only
two touchdowns and 178 total
yards, but, more importantly,
they avoided their usual ‘‘one-
play lapse’? (when they allow
the opposition a long yardage
touchdown). However, Fallon
was not too impressed with his
defense’s performance. “They
used a second-string quarter-
back and ran a cautious offense,
but they still controlled the
ball’, said Fallon.

With five games played, the
Generals are halfway through
this season. With their 0-5
record, W-L has very little to be
pleased about, but this year’s
team is a victim of cir-
cumstance. Having a new coach
means having to learn a new
system, which puts all the
players <: the same disad-

Water polo Generals go
6-1 after tournament

The Washington and Lee
Water Polo Generals raised
their 1978 season record to 6-1
after a sterling performance
this weekend in Cy Twombly
Pool. In the first Southern
League Tournament, W&L
played five games in forty
hours, winning four and losing
one. Ten teams competed in the
tournament, and the team
championships went to East
Carolina and Richmond, who
each won five games and lost
none.

Coach Bill Stearns calls the
team his best ever, and has high
hopes for them as the season
wears on. He was extremely
pleased with the way his
starters held up during the five-
game span, and commended

calls his team ‘‘the best ever.”’

Washington and Lee’s water polo team

the play of his defense, led by
Will Hodges in goal, Chip Hoke,
Bob Newcomb, and Mike Foley.

In the tournament opener last
Friday, W&L got off to a great
start as they soundly whipped
North Carolina 27-5, with co-
captains Drew Pillsbury and
Keith Romich scoring seven
and five goals respectively.
Romich came back with two
goals Saturday morning as
W&L defeated Georgia
Southern 6-4. Also Saturday,
Bob Newcomb had five goals
and Biff Martin four as W&L
beat George Washington 14-5,
and Romich finished off his
busy evening with three goals
as Duke fell, 4-3. This last game
was not finished until after mid-
night.

Sunday, the Generals drop-

came out of the weekend tourney with a record of 4-1. Stearn

ped their final game 10-9 to East
Carolina in a very fine effort for
the tired swimmers. W&L lost
to the same team by 13 goals
last year, so the improvement
of this years’ team is evident.
Martin contributed four goals in
the ECU loss.

The team’s next action is
another Southern League tour-
nament October 20-21, when the
Generals will play the other
four teams in the league: VMI,
Lynchburg, James Madison,
and Richmond. If the Generals
can do well in this tourney, they
will qualify for the league’s
championship tournament in
Richmond, October 27-28,
where the top two teams qualify
for the Eastern Collegiate
Championships at West Point,
N.Y.

Cross Country team
picks up first victory

Though Washington and Lee’s
top cross country runner, Rich

   
  

A
ih

Bird, was led off course in last
Saturday’s meet in Norfolk,
Virginia, the Generals manag-
ed their first victory of the
season.

The mix up occurred after a
member of the host team cut
the course and them missed a
turn. In cutting the course, Bird
and another runner were in se-
cond and third following the op-
ponent. Bird commented, “It
was his course, we thought he
knew it.’’ The runner missed a
turn, leading the other two off
course. When Bird finally
returned to the course, he was
in twelfth place. He finished in
seventh place, two places
behind the General’s top runner
of the day, Bob Bates.

Final scores for the meet
were Virginia Wesleyan College
120, Christopher Newport Col-
lege 101, Washington and Lee
57, Norfolk State College 46, and
in first place, Lynchburg Col-
lege with 35.

In all, seven runners made
the trip. Those scoring for W&L
in addition to Bates and Brid
were Greg Branan, Brian

Adams, and Mike Conforti. The
two other strong finishers were
Parker Roberts and Carl
Solari. ;

On Tuesday, October 10, the
Generals traveled to Liberty
Baptist College in Lynchburg
for another meet. Despite tak-
ing their full compliment of run-
ners, Washington and Lee was
defeated 21-38.

Placing second overall and
first for the Generals, was co-
captain Bird. Bates, the other
co-captain, finished sixth
overall and second for the
Generals. Completing the five
scorers were Branan, Conforti,
andRoberts.

Other finishers were Carlos
Solari, Howard Herndon, Bill
Sherwin, Sean Smith, Doug
Shipman, and Tom Gillen.

On Saturday, October 14, the
Generals will have their first
and only home meet of the
season. Scheduled to begin just
before the football game, the
opponents include Bridgewater,
Roanoke, and Eastern Men-
nonite.

Soccer team loses twice,
gears for Homecoming game

by Tim Connors
Washington & Lee played two
tough teams this week, and in
both games gave impressive
performances. These per-
formances are indicative of the
improvement which the team

has made over the course of the
season.
Last Wednesday, the

Generals travelled to
Hampden-Sydney and tied the
Tigers 0-0 in double overtime.
W&L outshot Hampden-Sydney

by the amazing margin of 41-21.
Two of the Generals’ goals were
disallowed by the referees
because of penalties. Coach
Rolf Piranian said that W&L
played a ‘“‘very good ballgame’”’
and that ‘‘We were very
unlucky not to have won that
game.’’ Sophomore goalkeeper
Kevin Carney had 19 saves in
the game en route to picking up
his first shutout of the season.
On Saturday W&L hosted
Elizabethtown College and lost

by the score of 4-0. Losing to the
Blue Jays is no disgrace,
however, as they have one of
the top Division III programs in
the nation, having lost only to
the tenth-rated team in the
country, 3-2. Piranian said that
“they scored three goals in the
first three-and-one-half
minutes, and that was our undo-
ing.”’ He said that the game was
“otherwise respectable, as we
were clearly outplayed by an
extremely good ballclub.”’ Pira-
nian went on to say that he
would be ‘‘very surprised if
Elizabethtown does not do well
in the NCAA tournament.”

‘Carney came up with another

fine effort, despite the number
of goals he allowed, turning
away 17 of the Blue Jays’ 29
shots in the game. The Generals
took 14 shots on goal.

Upcoming for W&L are
games with Virginia Tech on
Sunday October 15, Homecom-

ing Weekend, and on Wednes-_

day October 18 with. James

games are at home, with Sun-

vantage. Thus, in these first
five games, we have seen the
Generals learning to play in a
style uncommon to the veter-
ans ‘“‘Because of the new system
it’s been like coaching 60
freshmen’, said Fallon. “‘The
new system has caused a lot of
mistakes, and it’s cost us some
games.”

On bright spot last Saturday
was the running of Stewart
Atkinson. The junior tailback
ran for 52 yards and broke Ran-
dy Broyle’s career rushing
record of 1464 yards’ Atkinson

career yards.

Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference with a 48 yards per
game average.

This Saturday’s opponent is
Hampden-Sydney College. The
Tigers, now 3-2 on. the year,
were preseason favorites to win
the ODAC. “If we can prevent
making mistakes and give our
best effort; then we might pull
off an upset’’, said Fallon. “A
game against a team the

Still, the question remains:

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

About Noise

Lexington’s noise ordinance remains an issue in the
fraternity houses on campus, even though no incident
of major consequence has occurred in the past few
weeks. The noise restriction remains—as does the
threat of arrest if the city statute is broken. The City
Council has not yet returned a verdict on the IFC’s of-
fer to restrict fraternity parties and the machinery of
government seems painfully slow to many impatient
fraternity men. So the fraternities hang in limbo as
the first of W&L’s ‘‘big’’ weekends approaches.

On the bright side, one notes that the police seem to
be more cordial in their dealings with the fraternities
of late. Of the court summonses recently issued for
violating the noise ordinance, none were issued before
the 1 a.m. cut-off time recommended by the IFC for
weekend parties. Of course Homecoming is no or-
dinary weekend, and the festivities scheduled may
Strain relations between the fraternities and the
townspeople yet one more time.

Within the confines of fraternity houses, there is
confusion over the relation of fraternities to the town,
the ‘‘absurdity”’ of the noise restriction, and talk of a
“boycott” to put ‘‘pressure on the town.’’ Many peo-
ple have the mistaken notion that a boycott of the
town’s businesses will somehow force a rescinding of
the noise ordinance.

The validity of the city statute, Section 15-32 (b),
will not be debated here. Suffice it to say that the
noise ordinance is law. Fraternity members have a
hard time remembering that they are members of the
community too, and therefore are subject to the same
laws as the townspeople. Many view this obligation to
the town as unfair. ‘‘Fraternities should be able to
party as long as they want to,” they say. Well, there is
no law against partying, just excessively loud noise.

There have also been rumblings about ‘‘boycot-
ting”’ the city’s businesses ‘‘to put pressure on the ci-
ty’’ to rescind the noise ordinance. Superficially ex-
amined, this scheme can work. Realistically con-
sidered, the boycott idea is a dud.

Roughly speaking, college students comprise one-
third of the population of this town, but half of that
one-third goes to VMI. That means that W&L students
make up one-sixth of Lexington’s population, and one-
half of them are not fraternity members. So, fraterni-
ty members comprise eight percent of the city’s
populace— representing not a whole lot of economic
clout.

The businesses primarily affected by a fraternity
boycott would be the food establishments around
town, and they have as much influence with the City
Council as the fraternities do.

So, it would seem, that there is not much the frater-
nities can do about Lexington’s noise ordinance. A
few weeks ago, the IFC presented the City Council
with a list of “concessions” the fraternities would be
willing to make to the city in return for the ordinance
being “relaxed” at specific times during the week.
When you get down to the bottom line, though, the
fraternities have no bargaining position with the city.
The law is on the books. Like it or not, only Council
can change or rescind a law, and there is not very
much the fraternities can do no matter what Lex-

ington’s city government decides next Thursday. J

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Beckley defends position on
Fancy Dress, student parties

October 9, 1978
Dear Editor:

I am compelled to respond to
Mr. M. Gray Coleman’s
editorial, ‘‘Faculty follies...,”’ in
the October 5th Ring-tum Phi. I
do not care to defend the level of
my discussion at the University
Council, but I am concerned
that Mr. Coleman’s column ob-
fuscates the issue which Mr.
Lad Sessions and I had hoped to
bring before the University
Council and the student body.

The issue is not whether the
faculty should attempt to
regulate the social activities of
the students, as Mr. Coleman
thinks it is. The issue is whether
students and faculty alike are
concerned and frustrated by an
unnecessary conflict between
academic work and social ac-
tivities. This conflict is created
when official social functions
are scheduled so as to cause
students to choose either

academic preparation or social .

activities. Faculty and students
alike have an interest in
regulating community ac-
tivities so that academic work
and official social activities will
compliment each other. We
should try to avoid ‘hard
choices’’ in which the ‘‘rugged
individualist” has to sacrifice
either his academic prepara-
tion and classes or the social ac-
tivities for which he has already

paid.

Neither Mr. Sessions nor I
ever had any intention of trying
to force a change of date for
Fancy Dress upon the students.
We did think that the University
Council was the appropriate
forum for faculty and students
together to discuss the possibili-
ty that Fancy Dress is one
social event which creates an
unnecessary choice between
social activities and academic
pursuits. The SAB seems to
have sensed this conflict.

Although they have not seen fit
to change any Fancy Dress ac-
tivities, they have decided not
to schedule Thursday parties as
a part of the other big social
weekends during the year.

Most of us favor a community
which maximizes individual
freedom, but it is a fetish about
“hard choices” and “rugged in-
dividualism’”’ that leads one to
argue that we ought to, create
conflicts that force unattractive
choices. A thoughtful and order-
ly scheduling of university and
fraternity social events would
maximize the student’s
freedom to enjoy both a plea-
sant social life and academic
diligence. There is a danger
that too many social events.
scheduled at the wrong time
will destroy freedom and force
students to make the “tough
choice.”’ Faculty members may
express their frustration when
they see this situation arise, but
it is for the students, or at least
for students and faculty
together, to remedy the situa-
tion. In the long run the students
probably have more to gain
from a regulated and orderly
social calendar than the facul-

ty.

I hope the other students at
the University Council meeting
did not come away with the im-
pression that anyone was trying
to impose a change in Fancy
Dress upon them. There is no
need for this community to
waste its energy discussing in
loco parentis,an issue on which
all of us are on the same side.
There is, however, a need for us
to discuss the properly ordered

relationship between social ac-

tivities and our academic pur-
suits. I would be delighted for
Mr. Coleman and others to turn
their attention to this issue.

Harlan Beckley
Assistant Professor
of Religion

 

Editor’s Note — Many thanks to
Professor Beckley for this
clarification of his position. Un-
fortunately, it doesn’t change
my opposition to such thought.
The overwhelming student opi-
nion against further social
regulation appears obvious to
me. So who is sounding off
about “‘thoughtful and orderly
scheduling of university and
fraternity social events,”’ if not
certain elements within the
faculty?

It is not my wish to belabor
this point any further, but I
would like to leave Professor
Beckley and company with
some final thoughts. In my four
years as a Student on this cam-
pus, I have seen many
undergraduates perform well in
the present social and academic
environment. Some, it is true,
have not fared so well. But they
appear to be a distinct minority.
So is it fair to regulate the ac-
tivities of the students who can
carry their weight?

Finally, as regards that
minority who habitually suc-
cumb to ‘‘temptations’’...is it
wise to assume that stricter
scheduling of large events will
curb them at all? It has always
seemed to me that there is no
one more inventive than the guy
determined to waste time. Take

one ‘“‘temptation” away — he’s ©

sure to find some other.

In any event, the University
Council has upheld the status
quo for the time being. It looks
as if we students will continue to
struggle along, taking our
choices as they come.

A team of top-notch students
is needed from. the
undergraduate school to par-
ticipate in this year’s College
Quiz Bowl, reports Mr. John M.
Gunn, associate professor of
economics.

The College Quiz Bowl,
resumed last year by the Na-
tional Association of Student
Unions, is a nationwide inter-
collegiate academic competi-
tion in a tournament format,
says Gunn.

Last year’s winners of the na-
tional tournament, held at Stan-
ford, were awarded $10,000 for
their school and also received
individual cash prizes.

Gunn explains that _ par-
ticipants need to be able to per-
form quick recall of academic
minutia. A three-man team is
required, with each student
versed in a different general
area, composed of either
natural sciences and
mathematics, literature and
fine arts, social Sciences and
public affairs. Each student
should also be well-versed in
sports anda hobby.

The executive committee has
allotted $160. for the financing
of a team, and other sources are
available for money, but no
group on campus has expressed
an interest in forming a team.
The E.C. and Student Activity
Board have already been ap-
proached.

An intramural competition
composed of a minimum of ten
matches is required for the for-

film society refused by E.C.

(continued from page 3)

“T assure you, not one of these
films has been shown on this
campus and will not be shown in
the future.”’

Diesing had told the commit-
tee that the SAB’s film service
‘is not providing the type of
films that the W&L community
wants.’’ Members of the film
society had felt that the SAB
would be unwilling to show the
types of films they desired.

Dudley, E.C. president, told the
group that they are entitled to
have their ‘“‘input with the
SAB.”

Both Kaston and Diesing said
they had not approached other
film groups on campus.

Sophomore E.C. represen-
tative Bob Willis said, ‘‘I don’t
think the SAB will be willing to
pump money for these types of
films.”’

Diesing said that the film

John Murphy, E.C. law school
representative, asked Diesing
.why the film society had not
first approached the SAB. Beau ,

society wants “‘to provide a dif-
ferent need and service to the
community.”’

Rob Calvert, senior E.C.1

representative, told the film
society, ‘‘it looks like you all
have not done a lot of in-
vestigating”’ into the different
outlets for films on campus.

‘‘We want to show just one
film that will make a splash,”’
Kaston said.

‘At the very least, I think we
should give them enough money
to show one film,”’ Willis said

But the E.C. voted 7-2-1 to
‘deny money to the film society
at this time,” with the recom-
mendation that they go to the
SAB and the law school’s film
group with their proposals.

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, published this week,
presents the first account of
mid-19th-century Austria’s
policy toward the various states Dr. Jenks’ study draws upon
of Italy during the final decade and coordinates numerous
of Austria’s predominance in Austrian, British and French
the Italian Peninsula. diplomatic documents which
have only recently been
published by Italian historians.

Kenan Jr. Professor of Euro-

In addition, he has incorporated
information contained in un-
published diplomatic  collec-
tions located in Vienna, Turin,
Rome, the Vatican and Paris.

The book traces’ the
background of Metternich’s in-
volvement in Italian affairs bet-
ween 1815 and 1848 and
describes the relationships bet-
ween Francis Joseph’s Austria
and the various Italian states
prior to their unification into a
single nation.

Dr. Jenks identifies the Cri-
mean War as a pivotal moment
of change, following which
sporadic Austrian gestures per-
mitting limited reform were in-
adequate to overcome Napoleon
III's interest in the Italian na-
tional question, British disgust
with Austrian illiberalism, and
growing sentiment in favor of
unification among the, Italian
States themselves. The War of
1859, Dr. Jenks observes, was
brought on by Francis Joseph’s
“obduracy”’ and led directly to
formation of the Kingdom of
Italy and the restriction of
Austrian power to Venetia and
Trieste.

Jenks, a 1939 W&L graduate
with M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Columbia, is one of the na-
tion’s foremost authorities in
Austrian. history. He is the
author of three other books in
the field: ‘“‘The Austrian Elec-
toral Reform of 1907’’ (1950)

‘and “Vienna and the Young

Hitler’’ (1960), both published
by Columbia and reprinted cur-
rently by Octagon, and
“Austria Under The Iron Ring,
1879-1893’ (1965), published by
The University Press of
Virginia.

He has taught at Washington
and Lee since 1946 and has held
visiting professorships at
Virginia, Maryland, Duke, VMI
and Virginia Tech.

Dr. John M. McDaniel, direc-
tor of the archaeological
research project at the ruins of
Liberty Hall Academy at the
edge of the Washington and Lee
University campus, has been

chaeologists.

McDaniel is assistant pro-
fessor of anthropology at W&L.

Dear Phineas,

Is it true that the administra-

tion is planning for the students
to move the books from the old
to the new library?
Yes, it is, although it’s got about
as much chance of succeeding
as John Travolta has of getting
a bid from a Red Square frater-
nity. In reality, lots of other ac-
tivities will be going on that
day.

A pledge scavenger hunt will
be in operation. Some items
on the agenda will be a Com-
merce school paper with a
reference to Shakespeare, a pic-
ture of a thousand spectators at
a soccer game, an English club
member who can explain the ef-
fective interest method, money
for the new Film Society, and a
UVa. football jersey that’s been
retired for contributions to an
undefeated team.

Those of us who wish we were
at Colorado College will head

Phineas: Library Moves

for Massanutten for sledding.
(Skiing? Forget it!) By the
way, if you see a terrified figure
flying down the slopes with less
control than someore with six
cups of grain in hii, heading
for a tree with a Bible in his
hands, and arms raised towards
the heavens, it will probably be
the guy who thought up the idea
of the student book move in the
first place.

So now the question comes up,
how do the books get moved?
Well, there are always the in-
mates at Western State,
although if that happens one
might find the Biography of
Gloria Steinhem situated next
to Diary of A Mad Housewife.
What the hell, you can send
twenty bucks to Collegiate
Research Inc. for term papers
on anything from Abnormal
Endearments Among Penguins
to Zuchini: How to Prepare it
One Hundred and One Ways.

Convention :

This is one in a series of ar-
ticles describing the 1980 W&L
Republican Mock Convention—
Its development and progress.

Washington and Lee’s Mock
Convention is a complete
political workshop with the
primary goal of education. In
this attempt to educate, the
Mock Convention’s efforts are
enhanced by politically astute
speakers. The speakers pro-
gram has an active roll both

before and during the conven-
tion.

This year’s speakers pro-
gram will focus on three areas
of politics. The first area is
political journalism, and its role
in the total political picture.
Secondly, there will be a discus-
sion on current issues by a pro-
minent Republican legislator
from Capitol Hill. The final goal
is to bring to campus a potential
candidate for the 1980

The City Planning Commission in the midst of their debate on the Chi Psi fraternity house proposal.

Fraternity house plan approved

The Lexington City Planning
Commission recently recom-
mended that Chi Psi Fraternity
be granted its petition for a zon-

19380

Republican nomination.

Next year, the pace of the
whole convention quickens as
the final weekend draws closer.
While continuing to bring big
names to campus, there will be
a number of field coordinators
and administrative assistants
from the Republican National
Committee. These profes-
sionals will offer the inside in-
formation and insight that
makes the convention so
realistic.

The Mock Convention has
traditionally brought to the
Washington and Lee campus
many politically important peo-
ple. Former and _ future
Presidents have often taken ac-
tive roles in many conventions,
not only through speeches but
also through personal discus-
sions with various committee
members. President Truman
was the keynoter at the 1960
Convention, and in 1968, Presi-
dent Nixon visited the W&L
campus. President Carter, then

_ Governor of Georgia, addressed

the 1972 Mock Convention.

_ While students at Washington
and Lee have heard great
speeches from’ keynote
speakers, the most memorable
/was that speech given by
former Vice President, Alben
|W. Barkley, in 1956. After
Barkley had delivered an arous-
ing, impassioned speech, he
became so infected with the en-
tire spirit of the event that he
suddenly collapsed and died
before the 1700 shocked people
involved in the 1956 Mock Con-
vention...

ing change so the Ann Smith
School can become a fraternity
residence.

Now, the only step remaining
is for the City Council to ap-
prove the commission’s action.
Council will meet to consider
the zoning change at a special
meeting October 26 at 9a.m.

A zoning change is necessary
because of city laws limiting
fraternity residences in town.
No opposition to the zoning
change is expected since the
major opponents to Chi Psi’s

proposal, the parishioners of St.
Patrick’s Catholic Church adja-
cent to the Ann Smith School,
recently gave their backing to
the fraternity’s plans.

Chi Psi intends to renovate
the building so that all fraterni-
ty members will be able to live
there. :

If all goes according to plan,
the fraternity will be rushing
out of their new lodge next year,
and living there the following
spring.
