McCormick Renovation Begins
$3.5 Million Project to Take 18 Months

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will begin a $3.5-million, 18-
month project shortly to
renovate and completely
remodel its Cyrus Hall McCor-
mick Library building to
become the new home of W&L’s
School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

W&L moved from 73-year-old
McCormick to a new $9.2-
million undergraduate library
building last week.

McCormick will provide more
than three times as much
usable space for the W&L com-
merce division as its current
facility, Newcomb Hall -- 37,545
square feet vs. 11,542.

The commerce school has
been located in Newcomb since
it was founded in 1906 as the
School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration.

The ‘‘new’’ commerce
building will have seven
classrooms, including two

auditorium-like ‘‘conference
classrooms,’ one seating 80 and
the other 50; three seminar
rooms; several studies, and of-
fices for 23 faculty members,

 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 

Twenty-three undergrad
and law students at Washingtpy
and Lee University here we
“tapped” today into membe
ship in Omicron Delta Kappa}
the national honorary leader-
ship society.

The ‘‘tapping’’ ceremony took
place as part of W&L’s annual
Founders’ Day convocation.

The society, which now has
chapters on the campuses of
more than 125 colleges and
universities throughout the na-
tion, was established at
Washington and Lee in 1914.

ODK recognizes superior
leadership achievements in
several fields — athletics, stu-
dent politics, publications,
social and religious affairs, and
the creative arts. Students
“‘tapped’’ must also rank in the
top third of their academic
class.

The twenty-three Washington
and Lee students inducted into
W&L’s Alpha Chapter during
the ceremony today are:

John C. Bovay, Lakeland,
Fla., undergranduate senior ac-
counting major — member, Stu-
dent Recruitment Committee
(admissions), Who’s Who in
Colleges and Universities, and

the dean and staff.

The reading room in old Mc-
Cormick Library will be kept as
the library and reading room in
the commerce school: Current
professional periodicals and
reference and _ research
volumes will supplement the
main commerce collection in
the new undergraduate library.

In addition to extensive
seating capacity in the com-
merce library room, there will
be two nearby rooms of student
carrels — private desk-and-
shelf areas which may be
reserved for an academic term
ata time.

Last year, business ad-

Grain Cups
Arrive

According to University
librarian Maurice D. Leach, the
two thousand souvenir grain
cups — scheduled to be
distributed during last week’s
library move — have finally ar-
rived.

Distribution of the cups has
already begun, and all who par-
ticipated in ‘‘The Great Move”’
are eligible to pick one up
behind the circulation desk in
the new library.

Two thousand of the cups
were ordered by the Library
Move Committee in the late fall,
stated chairman Steve Mangan.
Sufficient time was allowed for
delivery, but the company in
charge of production accidently
mailed the cups to ‘William
and Mary — Lexington,
Virginia,’’ resulting in the late
arrival.

EC Approves Payment

of Student Photographer |

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to allow a
yearbook editor to be paid for
taking fraternity pictures for
this year’s publication.

The EC voted 8-4 to allow
Layout Editor Chris Volk to be
paid $10 for each group picture
of Washington and Lee’s 16
fraternities used in this year’s
Calyx. The money for his com-
mission will come out of the
yearbook’s operating budget.

Grant Leister, business
manager of the Calyx, asked
the EC if paying a student to do
work normally done for free
would be a ‘“‘conflict cf  in-
terest.”

Leister explained that tne
publication had run_ into
deadline complications and had
neither the manpower not the
equipment to take the pictures
by today’s time limitation.

(Leister had originally con-
tacted the Andre photographic
studios in town and was told the
job could be done by today’s
deadline for $20 a fraternity.)

The yearbook’s own
photography staff could not do
the job because they were busy
with other work this week and
did not have a wide-angle lens,
Leister said. It was then that
Volk offered to take the pictures
for $10.

‘“‘What it boils down to is not
the equipment, but the
availability of the
photographers,”’ Neil Sheehan,
Photography Editor of the
Calyx, told the EC. “We are
understaffed.” :

‘How does the staff feel about
another staff member being
paid for the work they do for
free?’’ asked Rob Benfield,
senior EC representative.

“T think it’s a pretty raw
deal,’’ said Leister.

(It was also disclosed that
Volk had _ resigned as
Photography Editor of the
Ring-tum Phi, giving a heavy
work load as the reason for his
resignation. )

“Chris is merely acting as a
businessman and marketing the
skills he has,’”’ said Sheehan.
“There are many people who
will sacrifice their time for a
fee,’’ he added.

‘“‘We’ve got to have those pic-
tures by Thursday night,”
Leister said, ‘‘and Chris has
already taken four pictures.”

“I think the only option we
have is to go with the lowest bid
available, even if it is a stu-
dent,”’ sophomore EC represen-
tative Bob Willis said.

Rob Calvert, senior EC rep.,
formally made the motion that
“Chris Volk receive his fees and
do the work ‘“‘

 

Correction

In the two Executive Commit-
tee stories published in last
week’s Ring-tum Phi, represen-
tative Steve Abraham was in-
correctly identified as a
sophomore.

Abraham is a junior.
The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
jerror.

 

 

 

Voting in a losing battle
against the payment were: Ben-
field, Bill Tucker, EC vice-
president, Tom McCarthy, EC
secretary, and Steve Abraham,
junior representative.

“This action sets the prece-
dent of paying students to do the
work they should be doing for
free,” Tucker said after the
meeting.

‘“‘We were caught in a bind in
having to vote for it’’ because it
was the only option, Benfield
said.

McCarthy said that although
there was no alternative to pay-
ing Volk with the deadline so
close, he was against the pay-
ment “‘in principle.”

John Murphy, EC law school
representative, said that the
complications in the location of
the fraternity reception for
former Sen. James Buckley
were the result of a “lack of
communication between the
Coatact committee and the In-
terfraternity Council.”’

(The reception for Buckley
was scheduled to be held at the
Phi Kappa Sigma house after
an im»romptu meeting between
IFC T'resident Jim Davis and
Conta :t Co-Chairman Tom Wall
two diys before the speech. )

(The normal IFC reception
selection proceedure calls for
random drawings of the eligible
fraternities. Davis told Murphy
that there had not been time to

Three Fraternities Placed
on Social Probation

Three fraternities were plac-
ed on social probation for fail-
ing to meet requirements on
fraternity inspection checklists
at Tuesday:night’s Interfrater-
nity Council meeting.

Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, and Phi Gamma Delta
were all put on two weeks social
probation after a spot inspec-
tion Tuesday found that they
had not met all the re-
quirements on the inspection
checklists.

(Members of a fraternity on
social probation are not allowed
to have parties or attend
organized school functions on
campus. )

IFC member Syd Farrar said
that SPE did not have emergen-
cy phone numbers listed by the
telephones.

PiKA’s house manager said
that they had seven cracked
windows, garbage strewn out of
their garbage pit, one fire ex-
tinguisher empty, and one par-
tially empty.

(One PiKA member said that
these problems met specifica-
tions when the checklist was
completed, but that a freshman
raid on the fraternity house
created the deficiencies. )

The fraternities can appeal
their penalties to the Student
Affairs Committee.

Also at Tuesday’s IFC
meeting it was announced that
Chi Psi was the winner of the
fraternity participation contest
in last week’s library move,
with all 16 members helping.

Second was SPE with 95 per-
cent attendance showing, and
Phi Kappa Sigma came in third
with 85 percent.

As the first place winner, Chi
Psi will receive three kegs of
beer and a commemorative pla-
que in the new library. Second
place will be given a W&L
chair, and third place will
receive two kegs.

The IFC also announced that
it donated $100 to the
Rockbridge Christmas basket.

Admissions Up. 549 Applications Received

by Charlie Smith

Applications for admission to
Washington and Lee are runn-
ing 33 percentof the number of
applications received by the
University at this time last
year, school officials told the
Ring-Tum Phi Tuesday.

According to William Hartog,
Director of Admissions, the
school has received 549 applica-
tions so far, compared with 433
on Jan. 16 of last year.

In addition, a ‘‘record
number’’ of people applied for
early admission this year, Har-
tog said. Of 80 early decision

candidates, 34 were accepted.
This is the same number as
were selected as last year,
which indicates that the school
was more selective in this
regard, he said.

If applications continue to be
received at the present rate, the
University expects to reach
about 1,150 applications for ad-
mission, or about 175 more than
last year, Hartog said.

‘Of the 1,150 applicants, it is
hoped that there will be a total
acceptance of between 590 to 630
students. Hartog said that of
that number, the yield — or

Marathon Registration

by John Billmyre

Registration for W&L’s
Dance Marathon will begin
within the next two weeks, Jay
Blumberg, coordinator of the
event announced Tuesday.

The marathon is presently
scheduled for March 23-24, a
date that accommodates the
largest number of local girls’
schools.

The tenative schedule calls
for a rock band Friday night
and two bands, one disco and
one soul, Saturday night. Ex-
cept for breaks every hour, the
msuic will be continuous.
Special events are still in the

planning stages.

Anyone interested in par-

ticipating is urged to register
before the Washington Holiday
break. Forms for registration
can be found in a package of in-
formation about the dance
marathon. The packages will be
available within two weeks.

Blumberg said the goal for
the marathon is one hundred
couples and $5,000. Those who
plan to particpate must have a
minimum of $30 in pledges.

Pledges do not have to go by
the hour.

number of students who will ac-
tually decide to go to other
schools despite admission to
W&L — should range from 48 to
56 percent.

Hartog said that with the
greater number of applicants,
he feels the school will probably
be more selective than last

year, and thus admit fewer

students.

Hartog said he sees this year
as the beginning of a crucial
period of recruiting and admis-

sions at Washington and Lee.

Last year, admissions fell by
about 30 percent, ‘‘a precipitous
drop which not many schools
could have survived,’’ Hariog
said. ;

Although the large drop in ad-
mission . applications ‘ cai sed
concern among some school of-
ficials, Hartog maintains that
this year’s freshman class
“turned out to be bigger than
average and the academic

Student Housing In Town Has Its

Part I
by Randy Smith

Gary Goodenow and his two room-
mates had no hot water until mid-
October, even though they had been
paying rent since August 15.

The hot water heater did not work
and the gas company condemned it.

It was not until the middle of October
when the landlady’s plumber had
replaced the heater’s exhaust system
with the proper pipe so that it could
pass the gas company’s safety inspec-
tion (the safety valve was also broken,
but the gas company let the heater pass
anyway).

There was also a large pile of gar-
bage in the backyard when they arrived
for the fall semester.

The landlady’s only explanation for
the trash was that the person she had
commissioned to clean up the mess had
not gotten around to it yet.

Goodenow and his roommates pay
$200 a month rent (excluding utilities)
to live in their house on Randolph
Street, only a five minute walk from the
Washington and Lee colonnade.

As originally arranged, the only
source of heat was an old central heater
with two vents in the downstairs en-
trance hallway. The central heater was
supposed to heat the entire house,
upstairs included, even though the
house had not been properly insulated.

“She said, ‘Leave the doors open and
the heat will disperse all over the
house’,”’ said Bob Sillman, another resi-
dent of the house.

“It was very cold when you got up in
the morning,’’ Goodenow said.

After some time, the landlady was
persuaded by her student tenants to put
an electric heater in one of the upstairs
bedrooms and a gas heater in the
bedroom downstairs.

But the coming of colder winter
weather brought on other problems.

 

A builder has said that this chimney
will fall.

A pipe burst in the basement.

The pipe was part of the plumbing of
an old bathroom no longer in use. .

‘As soon as she (the landlady) heard
that the pipe was broken she asked,
‘Have you had the -heater on down
there’?’”’ Goodenow said.

“She told us to leave the heater on all
the time so the pipes — which aren’t in-
sulated — wouldn’t freeze.

“She sets down the rules for who pays
for broken pipes in the lease, so we have
to do as she says, even though the
heater was red-tagged (condemned) by

Ine KMING-IUIME rill, Jdll. 1%, i7/7, Payeoo

Problems

 

This ‘‘red-tagged”’ heater is the only safeguard keeping uninsulated basement water pipes from freez-
ing.

the gas company for not having an ex-
haust system,’’ Goodenow said.

(Anti-freeze was also poured into the
basement bathroom plumbing to guard
against frozen pipes. )

In addition, when the students took
over the house in September the lawn
had not been cut, there was trash in
front of the house, and the kitchen had
not been cleaned, Goodenow said.

The proper ventilation systems were
not installed until early October, so
they had no heat or hot water until then,
even though they, too, had been paying
rent since mid-August.

“It’s the landlady’s responsibility to
check out her property and make sure
everything is in working order,” said
Phil Madeloff, another resident, ‘after
all, we do pay $300 a month rent.”’

The students also complained about a
leak from the upstairs bathroom
(which has a bathtub) through the ceil-
ing into the hallway.

The leak seems to be a recurrence of
an old problem; the ceiling appears to
have been plastered over several times
in the past.

“There is just a general deterioration
of the floor upstairs and the ceiling

 

“You sort of have to fight the world to get housing in this town,

and we just didn’t jump into the housing race fast enough.”’

 

A builder told them that their
chimney will fall down eventually, that
it is only a matter of time.

“She did paint the outside of the
house over the summer,,’ Goodenow
said, “and she did pay for new
lightbulbs — about $4 worth.”’

Goodenow calls the house he is living
ina “hovel” anda ‘‘den of horrors.”’

“It’s our fault that we’re living in this
dump,” he said.

‘You sort of have to fight the world to
get housing in this town, and we just
didn’t jump into the housing race fast
enough,” he continued.

Goodenow and his roommates
estimate they will each pay $1,100 this
year for their present housing
(including rent and utilities) and they
do not think they are getting their
money’s worth.

Case No. 2

Nearby is another house rented by
five W&L students. Although their pro-
blems are not nearly as severe as those
experienced by Goodenow and _ his
roommates, there are similarities.

“‘The gas company had to come three
times and wouldn’t turn on the gas
because of a number of problems,
among them inadequate ventilation for
the heaters in the house,” Joe Scott told
theRing-tum Phi.

“And our landlady had been made
aware of the situation at least by the
beginning of the summer,” he con-
tinued.

“In other words, the house was not
ready for habitation,”” commented Guy
Steuart, another student living in the
house.

“In order to heat my room, a new
heater had to be installed, but they
didn’t exactly finish the job,” said
Scott, ‘“‘so on a clear day, I can look
through the cracks in the old fireplace
and watch the grass grow.”

“We just don’t know when the whole
thing’s going to cave in,” added Scott.

“But then, where else could we live?”’
he asked.

After a slow to average fall
season, the concert calendar
for both Lexington and
Roanoke is definitely looking
up, at least for the next month
or so.

Locally, the Glenn Phillips
Group returns io the Cockpit
for two nights later this
month (Jan. 26 and 27). The
band played here last year to
an extremely enthusiastic
reception. But the real news
as far as Cockpit entertain-
ment has to be the upcoming
shows by the Nighthawks
(Feb. 7). Having seen the
band in Blacksburg last spr-
ing, I can attest that they’re
one of the finest performing
groups you’re likely to see,
particularly in a setting as in-
timate as the Pit. There’ll be
two shows, and a three dollar
cover charge.will be col-
lected at the door.

Moving down to Roanoke,
the next two weeks will
feature two interesting shows
at the Civic Center. Despite
the critical panning of their
most recent release, Boston
continues to tour and sell
zillions of albums — they’ll be
appearing at the Roanoke
Civic Center on Jan. 24.
Boston is surprisingly good
onstage, and they’re no doubt
improved their presentation
since I saw them in Roanoke
nearly two years ago. Open-
ing act is Sammy Hagar, a
talented but undistinguished
rocker of the arena variety. !

One week later, (Jan. 31),
Heart will take the stage, im-
mediately preceeded by
Firefall. Both groups have
had a great degree of com-
mercial success of late, and
should present an interesting

Cye And Ear: From The Bookstore

So a book is on the Best Seller
list. What does that mean? Pro-
bably nothing more than a total,
rather vaguely arrived at, from
a scattering of bookstores
around the country. Busy
booksellers seldom have time to
precisely count the actual
number of each title which have
been sold in the past week. (In.

truth, this week’s Best Seller
lists have been released to us
promoters ten days earlier! )

The Best Seller list gives

booksellers a quick gimmick -

with which to convince
customers that they really do
want to pay $12.50 for Fools Die

nothings of the paperback and

One thing for sure, it does not
mean that a best seller is a
great book. Hardly ever,
although it can happen. Good
books, yes — _ entertaining
books, yes — helpful books,
sometimes. Too, other books of
equal or greater value languish
in the shade, unlit by the
awesome rays of the Best Seller
list. Do Howard Nemerov or
Jorges Luis Borges appear? No,
but we have Linda Goodman’s
Love Signs andJackie Oh!
William Faulkner was long past
the years of his greatest writing
before he ever ‘“‘made it’’ to the
elite roster of the Best Seller.

Those of us who care deeply
about language and ideas must
be grateful, however, that the
Best Seller list convinces people
to come into bookstores, to go
on buying books, and to almost
accidently discover the special
books that never glare from the
top 15. And finally, there’s the
odd occasion when a great book
and the Best Seller list meet —

fortable with the type of movie
known as the Western. The good
ole cowboy flick has always
packed ’em in. In the 60’s, a new
breed of western was born, br-
inging with it a new breed of
star, one of the most enduring of
which has been Clint Eastwood.
Eastwood began with the
western, but he knew when to
quit. The popularity of the
western drama waned in the
early 70’s, and Eastwood
jumped right into his cops and
robbers phase, which was just a
re-packaged version of the old
shoot-em-ups. The days of the
Law and Order flick began to
fade, but the truck driver movie
was right around the corner, to
pick up the slack.

This is the new American
frontier story — the noble
cowboy has given up the clatter
of hooves for the roar of a
diesel. This modern classic
story has given us such
lightweight thrillers as White
Line Fever, Smokey and the
Bandit, and Convoy. The for-
mula runs something like this:
our hero has a job to do (often il-
legal), the fat, stupid sheriff
aims to stop him, “‘ if I have to
chase him clear to Santa Fe,”
and every mother’s son from
Tuscon to Talladega is out to
pick a fight with him, but all is
saved, at the expense of several
very fast cars. Granted, Every
Which Way but Loose is not the
typical trucking movie, but it
operates within the same kind
of formula approach — Clint
Eastwood, the hard fightin’,
hard workin’ guy, meets and
loses his new girl’ a sweet coun-
try singer, and he sets off to find
her. He encounters the villians,
the ever-popular _ sheriff
character is the same type we
saw in the other truck flicks, but
this sheriff isn’t quite as obnox-
ious.

There are enough comic

touches to make the film slight- ©

ly more subtle in its humor than
other similar films. Clyde,
Eastwood’s orangutan is as
engaging a character as Or-
ville, Eastwood’s human friend
(Geoffrey Lewis). Clyde’s ar-

winner

ranged meeting with a female
ape is given the perfect note of
comedy with the sound of
Charlie Rich’s ‘‘Behind Closed
Doors.”’ The well-chosen sound-
track, a country music hit-
parade, is sparingly applied,
adding a well-seasoned flavor to
otherwise bland moments.
James Fargo’s direction is solid
throughout the film, neither
flashy nor sloppy, showing in
crisp detail the beauty of the
Western United States.

Sondra Locke, as Eastwood’s
dream girl, does a competent
job with her ordinary role. The
big hero, Eastwood, shows us
that he really does have the
ability to portray human
warmth — a revelation which
seems almost wasted in a film
of this lightweight type. Writer
Jeremy Kronsberg keeps the
whole thing together, although
getting a little out of control

with the over-frequent fight

scenes. Nevertheless, that’s
what you expect from a western
where the cowboys ride pick-
ups, and Gabby Hayes has turn-
ed into an orangutan named
Clyde.

California Suite

Neil Simon returns with his
latest offering, California Suite.
The prolific Simon has given us
such hits as The Odd Couple and
The Goodbye Girl and such
losers as Murder by Death.
California Suite is an_ in-
teresting Hodgepodge of Simon
at his worst and best.

The film consists of four
unrelated stories. The action oc-
curs in and around a large L.A.
hotel. In the first story, Jane
Fonda. and Alan Alda are
superb as the divorced couple
fighting over their daughter.
The story shows the clash of two
cultures — New York tradi-
tional vs. California trendy. The
other stories involve an English
actress in Hollywood for the
Academy Awards, two couples
on vacation in L.A. anda manin
town for his nephew’s Bar Mitz-
vah. The Alda-Fonda scenes are

more details, call 463-9111, ext.
371.

WLUR

“A.M. on FM,” a new weekly
radio program to be broadcast
by WLUR, will begin this week
with Shakespeare’s ‘‘Othello,”’
starring Paul Robeson, Jose
Ferrer, and Uga Hagen.

Each Thursday at 9:30 a.m.,
the new program will present a
well-known play from either
English or American Theatre.

On Jan. 25, ‘A.M. on FM”
will present ‘Death of a
Salesman” by Arthur Miller.

Robert J. DeMaria, assistant
professor of journalism, will
moderate the program.

Fassbinder, is one of the best
known directors in the contem-
porary West German film
renaissance. (Fassbinder’s 1976
film Chinese Roulette was the
Society’s last movie.) The
American Friend, Wenders’
third film, is a fusion of popular
cinema — the Hollywood
thriller — and a traditionally
more serious cinematic mode,
the character study.

This fusion comes in the wake
of the “French New Wave,” a
development of the 50’s and 60’s
characterized by extreme self-
consciousness of the medium, in
which movies alluded to or used
film history, other films, other
film styles, and other directors
as a frame of reference.

The perimeters of ‘‘serious’’
film were often made more flex-
ible as a result, as is evident, for
instance, in Truffaut’s Shoot the
Piano Player, and Roman
Polanski’s Chinatown.

In The American Friend, a
murder is committed, and the
movie then focuses on the mind
of the murderer as he moves
almost continuously through in-
ternationally cosmopolitan
landscapes of neon-intense col-

or. American moviegoers will
recognize in particular Dennis
Hopper, best remembered for
his role in Easy Rider.

The film’s emotional center is
the relationship between the
murderer (Bruno Ganz) and the
professional killer (Dennis Hop-
per) who is his contact.
Wenders’ films tend to concen-
trate on the emotional inten-
sities between men in the same
way that Ingmar Bergman’s
films concentrate on the emo-
tional intensities between
women. But in The American
Friend, intimacy culminates in
a physical contact which is
achieved trhough violence
rather than through touching.

The Film Society’s next film,
to be shown in February, will be
Louis Malle’s Zazie, a French

comedy.
Society members. are
welcome to join the Film Selec-

tion Committee which will meet
at 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan.
24, in Payne 32F (3rd floor) to
consider the next few films in
the series. We will vote on the
two films to be shown after
Zazie at an open meeting on
Jan. 31, at8 p.m. in Payne 3.

 

Pit showcases
Brazilian quartet

This Saturday night, the
featured band in the Cockpit
will be Minas (pronounced
Meen - yas). Minas is authentic
Brazilian music— one moment
soft and flowing, the next,
energetic and exciting. In their
interpretation of the music of
Antonio Carlos Jobim, one can
imagine the beautiful beaches
with big blue canvas skies, the
red hot sun, colorful people and
a happy life. In contrast, when
they play the ‘‘samba” and
“carnival” music, one is arous-
ed in a primitive sense by the
full and energetic sounds of the
rhythmic percussion Percus-
sion with mixtures of African
and Brazilian elements where
one desires to move and feel the
music.

The voices are soft and soar-
ing, the instruments sensitive
and alive. The mood is happy,

 

Now playing at duPont:

Summer of °42 starring Jennifer O’Neill, Gary Grimes, Jerry
Houser

Astory of growing up complete with the adolescent yearning and
fumbling, adventures and hesitant forays into the mysteries of the
opposite sex. The Summer of ’42 is the story of a boy named Hermie
— 15-years-old and on the threshold of manhood. A simple human
comedy with a timeless feeling...as true today as it was in ’42. The
film is a touching memory piece — it unravels like a bolt of satin in
simple, precise, measured sequences.

something within all listeners.
It is the music and feeling that
one always seems to be sear-
ching for.

. Minas consists of four
members: Orlando on guitar
and vocals, Patricia on piano
and vocals, Rick on Bass guitar,
and Coquinho on drums and
Brazilian folk percussion in-
struments. The sound is
Brazilian-Jazz-Bossa Nova; the
style of Sergio Mendes, Flora
Purim and a mixture of their
own original music.

Minas played in the Cockpit
last term on November 1] and
were well received by a near
capacity crowd, and are reap-
pearing based on the reception
by the crowd. You might be
wise to get a date, and get there

McCormick renovation plans unveiled

renovation. Bass was also
W&L’s agent for the new
library, and university officials
said they were impressed both
with the quality of the firm’s
work and with the construction
schedule Bass observed on that
project -- which was completed

report to the trustees of what
was then called Washington
College in 1869.

McCormick is actually two
buildings — one inside the
other. The central section was
built in 1906, and the library was
then named for Andrew
Carnegie. In 1941 it was

sideration is for one humanities
department and perhaps two in
social sciences to be relocated
in Newcomb,

When they were first built,
neither Newcomb Hall nor
Carnegie Library was architec-

 

six months ahead of original
projections.

As~ with the new
undergraduate library, the
principal subcontractors will be
Harris Heating & Plumbing Inc.
(mechanical) and Howard P.
Foley Co. (electrical), both of
Richmond.

Charles W. Barger & Son of
Lexington will again be the sub-
contractor for excavation,
underground utility-tunnel con-
struction, and architectural and
structural concrete.

W&L’s commerce school is
the oldest in the south. Though
not established until the first
years of the 20th century, the
impetus to add a “commercial
school” to the curriculum
traces to a recommendation by
Robert E. Lee in his annual

FRONT ELEVATION 4

remodeled and enlarged —-by
constructing a new building
around the walls of Carnegie.
The facility was then renamed
for _Cyrus McCormick, the
Rockbridge County native who
invented the reaper. McCor-
mick was an_ important
benefactor and trustee of
Washington and Lee following
the Civil War.

After the commerce school
moves into McCormick, its cur-
rent facility, Newcomb, will be
renovated to house
undergraduate departments in
W&L’s liberal arts and sciences
division, The College, which are
similarly overcrowded and
scattered in various buildings
on the Colonnade. Current con-

turally in harmony with the rest
of the W&L Colonnade.
Newcomb, built in 1882, had a
plain facade, and columns and a
portico were not added for 27
years. Carnegie, built in 1906,
had an impressive — but unhar-
monious — gold dome which
was removed as part of the 1941
enlargement project.

Having been brought into ar-
chitectural unity with the Colon-
nade, however, both buildings
are included in W&L’s designa-
tion as a National Historic
Landmark, described by the

Department of the Interior in -

1972 as “‘this splendid succes-
sion of columned and pilastered

buildings . . . one of the most:

dignified and beautiful college
campuses in the nation.”’

W&L loses Invitational by one in O. T.
Also bows 67-61 to H-SC

by Bill Whalen

A funny thing happens inside
the Hampden-Sydney gym. Not
only do the walls close in on you
and the court seems to be
smaller, but some type of blind
rage overcomes the officials.
And we mean blind! Usually
this blindness occurs at the key
moment in the game, as it did
on Tuesday night when the
Generals visited H-SC.

With 62 seconds left, Pete

Farrell drove in for a layup and
collided with H-SC’s David Cor-
rigan. Farrell’s shot was good,
and the Generals trailed 61-60
when the refs decided that Far-
rel] had charged into Corrigan.
Instead of calling it an inten-
tional foul and awarding Far-
rell two shots (which was right
because Corrigan undercut
Farrell), the zebras gave Cor-
rigan two free throws, both of
which he made to put the game

 

THE

     

RING-TUM PHI

J.V. frosh;

tomorrow's stars

by Bill Whalen

At most colleges, the words
‘‘junior varisty basketball” are
synonymous with the words
“dead end.” A typical junior
varsity player is expected to go
no further in his career. At
W&L, however, j.v. basketball
serves a different purpose.

This year’s squad, coached by
Jim Casciano and Stan Packer,
consists of ten players. All ten
are freshmen, and_ their
development will determine
W&L's basketball success for
the next three years.

Casciano’s coaching aim is
not to build a powerhouse. In-
stead, his goal is to develop
these newcomers into varsity
potential players. This has
always been the duty of the j.v.
since Verne Canfield took over
the W&L basketball program,
and in recent years it has
played a major factor. Of the
five current starters on the var-
sity, three players — Tom Jef-
fries, Pete Farrell and R.J.

Scaggs — are j.v. graduates.
‘Five other players on the varsi-

ty roster have or are par-
ticipating with j.v. teams. In
all, that accounts for eight of
the thirteen men on the feam.
This year’s team is not
without stars, either. The

   

Students don't seem interested in the General's basketball team.

strength of the squad lies in its
starting five. Three of these five
— Travis Patterson, George
Spears and Clark New — also
double as varsity players. Since
all three are freshmen, they do
not figure into Canfield’s game
plans yet, so they get their play-
ing time with the j.v.

The other two starters are
also varsity prospects. They are
guard Chris Schrauth and for-
ward Craig Dye. Schrauth
averages 11.5 ppg while Dye
averages eight points. New is
the team’s leading scorer with a
21.5 point average. Patterson
and Spears both average 13.8
points a game.

The j.v. is 1-3 after four
games. Tuesday night’s 73-71
loss to H-SC was a good exam-

le of the j.v.’s problems. W&L
played well, but only in spurts.
The rest of the time, they made
clumsy errors. The team was
sloppy mainly because it was
their first game in five weeks.
And whenever the j.v. can prac-
tice, they must do so without
Patterson, New and Spears,
who are committed to varsity
practices first. Varsity basket-
ball may come first at W&L, but
j.v. basketball is an important
second.

Only an estimated 350-400 showed up to see Transylvania sink their

teeth into WAL.

ptt a line RIA! pace a Sis Rw eet

away at 63-60. As it was, this
call, plus several W&L
mishaps, sent the Generals to
their second consecutive loss,
67-61. W&L is now 8-5 overall
and 0-3 in the ODAC.

From the tipoff, the Generals
were fighting an uphill battle.
The Tigers jumped to an early
24-8 lead due to aggressive in-
side play. W&L countered with
some strong play by Tom Jef-
fries and Rob Smitherman, but
could only get as close as 32-26
before H-SC edged out to 35-26
at the half. ‘“‘We have to stop
getting ourselves into these
awkward positions,’’ said
Coach Verne Canfield. ‘“They
were too physical and ag-
gressive, and we did not res-
pond well to that.’’ By shooting
36% in the first half, the
Generals were in an early hole.

The second half was different,
though. W&L was able to close
to within four points at 39-35 and
46-42, but could get no closer un-
til they trailed 61-58 with 1:16 to
play. Then came the controver-
sial Pete Farrell play. H-SC hit
on four of six field goals in the
last 46 seconds. W&L could
manage only one free throw.
Jeffries led the Generals’ at-
tack with 20 points, 14 in the se-
cond half. Carby Hoy and Far-
rell each added 11.

W&L 86, Maryville 75

Pete Farrell’s 25 points and
Carby Hoy’s 24 paced the
Generals to an opening round
victory in the W&L Invitational,
last Friday night. The
Generals, who led at the half,
30-28, outscored the Scots 16-8
midway through the second
period to move ahead 70-59.
Farrell and Joy, who were held
to six and eight points in the
first half, combined for 35
points in the last 20 minutes.
The win sent W&L to the cham-
pionship game, where they fac-

ed Transylvania, 80-64 victors
over Ursinus in the preliminary
game.

Transylvania 63, W&L 62 (1 OT)

The Generals lost the cham-
pionship game in overtime to
Transylvania, 63-62, in one of
the most exciting games at
W&L in recent history. W&L
never led in the first half as they
fell behind 4-11, 16-23 and 30-36
at the half. The Pioneers led
47-36 with 16:23 remaining
before the Generals ran off

 

tional’s first round.

Hoy goes up for two against the Maryville Scots in the Invita-

eleven straight points to knot
the game at 47-all with 13:16
left. The lead changed hands
three times before Farrell hit
on one of two free throws with
five seconds left to send the
game into overtime at 56-56.
The lead shifted four times in
the five minute period before
tournament MVP John Hart
made a layup with 55 seconds
left. The Generals tried for one
last shot but Tom Jeffries’ ten-

,foot jumper was blocked and

in a tri-meet here at the
Warner Center. W&L defeated
George Washington University
31-17 and lost to Duke 38-7. Duke
was the overall meet winner as

they also defeated George

Washington 33-ll. Two
freshmen, Mike McFadden at
150 and Clyde Gaylord at heavy
weight had 0-2 marks while five
other Generals had 1-1 records.
All of their: victories came
against George Washington.
Hank Wail at 126 and Ed Rogers
won by pin, Elbert Umila at 18
and Mike McKay at 134 won by
forfeit, while Dan Kniffen at 190

2-0 marks. Ray Gross had a
close 5-4 win against Duke at
142, while Ed Rodgers at a dif-
ferent weight class, had an
easier 8-0 decision at 158.

The Generals now have a

record of 1-2 and Saturday

such as this one: ‘‘His paintings of blacks...reflect his New York training. He finds vitality, humor and

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The death of

“grade review”

Last month, the Executive Committee unanimously
approved a statement that would give students ‘‘the
right to review and discuss all graded material and
any factor entering into the final grade’ in all
courses. This measure would have allowed students
to take their grievances to the proper department
chairman, who would be given the power to overturn
the professor’s grade if necessary.

As it stands, W&L has no ‘‘grade review’’ process.
The faculty has absolute autonomy in this matter, and
approval by that same group was necessary to make
the E.C. statement became law. It was no surprise,
then, that the E.C.’s approval of the statement was
mixed with general pessimism over its ability to pass
in a faculty meeting. (Beau Dudley said it was like

‘‘spitting in the wind.’’) And at last week’s faculty
meeting, any chance of effective grade review was
pretty mucheliminated.

A new statement, prepared by the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee, will be released soon. Students
with grade complaints are now urged to appeal to the
department chairman, after all efforts are made to
deal directly with the professor. The chairman may
act as a “mediator” of sorts, but cannot overturn the
professor’s grade decision. As one faculty member
put it, “‘the change is basically cosmetic...It signifies
that the faculty is sympathetic to the problems of cer-
tain students, but unwilling to surrender any of their
control.”’

In one sense, the faculty’s refusal to agree to some
sort of review process is most unfortunate. Students
with legitimate grade complaints still have no effec-
tive means of action against ‘‘administrative C’s”’
and the like. Unfair grading practices do occur from
time to time despite claims to the contrary. Even so,
we count ourselves among the many who sincerely
doubted the ability of ‘‘grade review’ to be ad-
ministered in a reasonable and fair way. All that can
be expected is that department chairmen will realize
they are the students’ only recourse — and that they
will offer as much aid as possible in their position as
the ‘‘middleman.”’

oe ok

The E.C.’s grade review plan may have been riddl-
ed with difficulties, but other measures proposed in
the same statement were obvious reforms which
should have been endorsed by the faculty. Specifical-
ly, they were requests for a syllabus at the beginning
of each course and an approximate grade percentage
for tests and papers. Many professors refuse to be
held to a schedule of assignments, and often have to
be pinned down to reveal their relative bearing on the
final grade. It is maddening to see that such a simple

duty cannot be performed by the entire faculty.
Proper information concerning the administration
of a course should be seen as the most basic of obliga-
tions to the student. Contrary to what some may
think, a syllabus is a requirement — not a gift.
Academic ‘“‘guessing games’? may be a faculty
favorite, but please try to keep them out of the

Letter

With last week’s issue, Peter Goss
ended his long tenure as Business
Manager of the Ring-tum Phi. Ap-
pointed by the Publications Board in
May, 1977, his first duty was to
oversee the change in printers from
the W&L Print Shop to The News-
Gazette. Added to this tremendous
responsibility was the need to ex-
pand the two-man business staff, in-
crease advertising, and promote
subscriptions.

These and other problems he at-
tacked with energy...and the results
have become an unqualified suc-
cess. The Phi’s advertising revenues
have more than tripled under Goss:
the same growth rate has been see).
in the size of the business staff. Mor
than any other individual, hi:
dedication has made possible the e>
panded size of the Phi as it appear

Changing of the guard...

this year. He will be missed, but w:
are pleased to note that he will rc
tain his seat on the Publication:
Board and will remain on th
business staff in an advisory capaci
ty.
On the recommendation of Goss.
the Publications Board appointed
Cove Geary to serve as Business
Manager for the remainder of the
year. As his successor to sworn in,
Goss commented, ‘‘It is always dif-
ficult to leave an organization with
which one has been so intimately in-
volved with for such a long period of
time. However, it is much easier to
depart knowing that the Ring-tum

Phi will be in such capable hands.”
All of us on the editorial staff
welcome the Phi‘s new Business
Manager, and say a final thanks to

his predecessor for a job well done.

Critical Year For W&L
Admissions, Hartog Says

(continued from page 2)
quality of the entering students
was better than expected.”’

Hartog said that the drop in
applications was -actually a
steady decline, but hit its lowest
level last year.

He cited three factors for the
drop in admissions: an essay in-
serted into applications, a tradi-
tional method of acceptances
and an unaggressive recruiting
policy.

The essay, he said, was in-
serted into last year’s applica-
tion, and is still the topic of
debate. Hartog said its effec-
tiveness has not yet been deter-
mined, but said that it chased
away not just marginal
students, but all students who
had mixed feelings about W&L.

Hartog said that the essay,
which he described as one way
to restrict ‘applicant flow”
really required “research done
by the student to be written
well.”

Traditional recruiting done
by Washington and Lee, said
Hartog, has always revolved
around the traditional centers
of high applications, such as

Baltimore, Atlanta and Dallas.

He said that with the declin-
ing number of potential ap-
plicants, the school must push
beyond these traditional areas
and intensify its recruiting ef-
forts.

To do this, the school has im-
plemented a program just as in-
tense and competitive as that of
any college football team trying
to lure a star athelete. It in-
cludes a substantial increase in
visits to schools, a rise in the

number of mailings of applica-
tions and information about the
school, and a visitation pro-
gram which includes ‘“immers-
ing”’ the student into all aspects
of the school: visiting classes,
eating meals and sleeping and
visiting dorm rooms.

Wall suggested that frater-
nities be chosen in some sort of
order next year, Murphy
reported.

“The IFC didn’t pick the
house in time,” Murphy said. “‘I
don’t think there was any
hanky-panky with the selection
process,” he reported.

Tom Salley, Contact’s other
co-chairman, said that “for the
rest of the year, the houses will
be randomly selected.”

Beau Dudley, EC president,
said that he ‘‘will attempt to get
independent exams in the law

school”’ and was hopeful that an
independent exam system could
be ‘‘put into effect this spring.”

He said he would try to imple-
ment independent exams for all
three law classes, but he called
the examination schedule for
first year students ‘‘the most
equitable system there is.”

“Independent exams would
relieve a lot of pressure,”’
Jenelle Mims, EC law school
representative, said, ‘‘it really
would help.”

Another new key to W&L’s
stepped-up admissions is the
rolling acceptances, said Har-
tog.

Traditionally, candidates
were not informed of their ac-
ceptance or rejection until
March. By that time, said Har-
tog, they might have been ac-
cepted by another school and
‘lost interest’’ in W&L, whether
they were ultimately accepted
or not.

Under the new, rolling pro-
gram, a certain number of

‘students are told whether they
are accepted or rejected each
month.
