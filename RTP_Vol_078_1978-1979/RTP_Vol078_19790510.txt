SAB Concert Cancelled; §

Contract Agents Blamed

by Gray Coleman

and Ross Newell
In an interview Tuesday,
Assistant Dean of Students
Michael Cappeto stated the
reasons behind the cancellation
of the Student Activities Board

concert featuring Firefall,
scheduled for last Saturday
night.

Cappeto began by stating,
“The point is that Washington
and Lee shouldn’t be in this
business. We don’t have the
manpower or facilities for these
big concerts. Madison, for ex-
ample, has 3 full-time profes-
sionals plus their student ac-
tivites board, to make these
concerts go. . . I just don’t see
how we can go on and agree to
bring bands when what they
want is so much different, from
what we can possibly provide.”

Firefall’s advance manager,
who arrived at W & L early on
Saturday, informed Cappeto
that stage and power facilities
were inadequate. The band
workers inferred that the stage
— a 32-by-40 foot rental unit
from Richmond, which cost the

Saturday

by Mike Perry
Washington Hall was van-
dalized sometime after 2:00 last
Saturday morning. University
Proctor Charles F. Murray is
currently investigating the inci-
dent and reports that the van-
dals smeared black paint
across the white doors to
Washington Hall, three columns
and a plaque honoring the Col-
onnade’s distinction as a Na-
tional Historic Landmark.
Murray points out that this
sort of vandalism occurs ‘‘at
least once or twice a year,” and
that while there are many possi-
ble suspects, he believes that a
W&L student probably did it.
Murray relates the vandalism
to another incident occurring
last Friday in Graham-Lees
Dorm in which a dorm
counselor lost $30 and a ring,
and adds that this kind of thing
has “‘happened some all year.”’
Although he ‘hasn't come up
with anything yet,’’ Murray ful-
ly expects that something will
be discovered. A handprint was
found on one of the columns, but
it is doubtful that any of the
fingerprints will prove helpful.
The University has repainted
the doors and columns, and
may have to have the plaque
repaired, but the incident did
not cause any lasting damage.

SAB approximately $500 in spite
of its not being used — ‘wasn’t
of good quality, which is
debatable,’ according to Cap-
peto.

The stage size was just one
point in a hurricane of conten-
tions and mistakes in com-
munication between the band’s
agent, International Creative
Management (ICM), and the
SAB’s_ entertainment broker,
Entertainment Directions.

The Firefall contracts, dated
April 4, 1979, arrived several
weeks ago and the actual agree-
ment met with no objections.
But a series of ‘‘riders,”’ or pro-
mises which must be made by
W&L in addition to contract
price, which numbered several
pages, were As Cappeto stated
— ‘absolutely impossible to
carry out.”

The first rider required the
SAB to pay 50% of the fee even
if the band didn’t play. Cappeto
refused to sign this point ... and
many others which followed, in-
cluding requests that he called
“really entertaining to read.”’

These included the following:
4 immense follow-spots which
“would've fried them on
stage,’’ as Cappeto said; a com-
plete headphone system all
around the hall; a piano tuner,
registered member of the Piano
Technicians’ Guild, available
for sixhours before the show;
all student workers to turn in
their student ID’s to the stage
manager as collateral that they
would remain to help re-load
the band equipment; 12x15 foot
carpeted rooms — one each for

 

 

Washington Hall.

i SZ di sil
Buildings and Grounds workers repair Saturday's damage to

‘guitar tuning,” ‘‘horn rehear-
sal,”’ and so on; full meals, in-
cluding 4 vegetarian dinners;
bottles of Jack Daniels, Remy
Martin Cognac, Cuervo Gold
Tequila, and 3 cases of
Heineken Beer; and more
Heineken and cognac available
with ice ten minutes before the
performance.

With all this, the immediate
cause of caneslilation was
W&l.'s inability to provide 300
amps of ‘‘necessary power’’ in
Doremus Gymnasium. Cappeto
states, ‘‘when the advance peo-
ple got here at 11 a.m., I could
tell they wouldn’t want to play

James W. Whitehead,
treasurer of Washington and
Lee University since 1966 and
secretary of the Board of
Trustees since 1968, will leave
his financial management
duties next Jan. 1 to devote in-
creased attention to his board
duties and to expanded respon-
sibilities for university develop-
ment activities and the curator-
ship of W&L’s nationally impor-
tant art collections.

The university said E.
Stewart Epley of Stephentown,
N.Y., a 1949 Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Washington and
Lee in accounting who was
formerly the chief financial

analyst for a $1-billion series of
college building programs in
New York State, will join the
W&L administration July 1 as

assistant to Whitehead with the
expectation that he will succeed
Whitehead as treasurer six
months later.

Since 1974, Epley has been a
“development staff associate’
of Washington and Lee and has
worked full time in that capaci-
ty since 1977. Development staff
associates represent the univer-
sity in a wide range of opera-
tions, primarily in fund-raising
with additional responsibilities
in alumni relations and admis-
sions, in various geographical
areas of the country where
Washington and Lee has par-
ticular historical strength.
Epley’s area has included most
of the northeast, from New
York, New Jersey, Penn-
sylvania and Ohio through all of
New England.

Whitehead will assume
substantially enlarged duties as
W&L’'s board secretary under
the new arrangement, the
university said. He succeeded
Robert E. R. Huntley in that
capacity when the latter was
elected president 11 years ago.
Shortly afterward, the W&L
board was _ substantially
reorganized, and the new, more
active board has long required
more extensive liaison with the
on-campus university ad-

Fraternity Proposal

The faculty reached no deci-
sion concerning the . fraternity
proposals at Monday's meeting.
A special faculty meeting will
be held to discuss the issue
before the next regular
meeting, members of the facul-
ty said.

In addition to a proposal sub-
mitted to the faculty by Dr. Ed-
ward Pinney that would restrict

many fraternity functions, the
faculty was presented with a
similar proposal drawn up by
the Interfraternity Council,
amended by Student Affairs
Committee, and approved by

Brawl Occurs At

by David Greer

Several Washington and Lee
students and a Hollins student
sustained injuries or were
sprayed with Mace during an
incident with Hollins security
guards Monday night.

The incident occured just
before 1:30 a.m. when several
students were leaving West
Dormitory by the side exit. One
witness said they were just
standing around when a securi-
ty guard came out with a fire
extinguisher in his hand.

The guard accused one of the
students, Michael Devine, a
junior, with spraying it in the
dorms. Devine denied doing
this.

A student who was in the
dorms earlier said he saw an
extinguisher sprayed, but
Devine was not the one spray-
ing it.

Devine said when he denied
shooting the extinguisher the
guard, Eugene Wright, ‘‘just
went beserk”’ and attacked him.

“IT ran into the cop station,”
said Devine. ‘‘I wanted to com-

plain about him. I wanted to
find out if they were carrying
guns.”’

A student who saw the inci-
dent said that the guard had
tried to make Devine leave but
Devine physically resisted dur-
ing a heated verbal exchange.
The witness said the guard
pushed Devine or tried to hit
him.

Devine said, ‘‘I wasn’t doing
any fighting. He was trying to
fight me.”

Mark Turner, a sophomore,
said he saw another guard runn-
ing toward Devine. He said he
tried to stop him, telling him
Devine had not done anyting
wrong.

Turner and the guard fell
over a bench and Wright, ac-
cording to witnesses, ran over
and started spraying Mace at
Turner. Richard Keatley said
he tried to separate Turner and
the other guard when he was
pushed down on the ground.

“IT was pinned down. I didn’t
try to swing or anything,”

EC Endorses Pavillion Plan;
Univ. Council Elections Held

by David Greer
The Student Body Executive
Committee endorsed a plan to
build a facility for student par-
ties on the back campus.
Student Body President Beau
Dudley said he has been work-
ing on an ad hoc pavillion com-
mittee to look into the feasibili-
ty of building a facility for
“alumni gatherings, student
parties, and small concerts.”

clude picnic and cookout

head. He sprayed my face, in
Turner’s face...’’ Keatley said
two other people were also
sprayed.

One Hollins student who was
at the scene was also sprayed
and had to be taken to the in-
firmary. She has been released.

Junior Baker Spring said
when he tried to separate
Turner and one of the guards he
was also sprayed from behind
and was temporarily blinded.

Keatley had lacerations on
his forehead and Turner said he
was unable to see to drive home
and had to let Devine, who
escaped before the spraying,
drive.

facilities, could be rented by
students, faculty, and organiza-
tions. Possible sites for the com-
plex include an area above the
law school or near Liberty Hall.

Dudley said it is possible that
financing for the building would
come from the Student Activity
Tax.

The advantages of the facility
would lie largely in its location.
The areas considered would not
threaten the town’s noise or-
dinance, would reduce student
trips to other similar facilities
out of town, and would provide
an accessible place for use by
students who do not have
transportation to other similar
facilities.

Having been endorsed by the
EC, the plan will probably go to
the Board of Trustees, Dudley
said.

In other EC business, Contact
spokesman Jim Tommins said
Ralph Nader is scheduled to
speak here May 24. Contact
could not get Tom Wolf to speak
this year.

EC secretary Tom McCarthy
announced a plan to have all EC
records stored in the University
Archives, except those from the
past five years. These records
would be open to anyone in-
terested in seeing them, but
would not include confidential
records involving honor trials.

Musical Mainstream

Breakfast in America
Supertramp

In order to get all questions of
objectivity (or lack of same)
out of the way right at the begin-
ning, I must confess to having
been a Supertramp fan from
way back. 1 claim no particular
musical foresight with regard
to the band (well, not much)—
it’s just that I was living in Mon-
treal when their first album
came out, and they were in-
credibly popular there even
four or five years ago.

Still, even though I was look-
ing forward to the release of the
new album, I resisted the temp-
tation to put my thoughts on it
into writing until now. The
album was charted at number
three with a bullet in Billboard
this week, and its commercial
success is just hard to ignore.

The similarities of Breakfast
in America to Supertramp’s
classic Crime of the Century
are several. The group uses a
few of the same lyrical images

Eye And Ear:

Scholarly writing is solid —
and frequently stolid — use of
language. The careful in-
vestigator of, say, an historical
period is deeply involved in the
minutiae of events and forces.
He wants to pack as much in-
formation as possible into his
book. Such history tomes might
be called the pemmican of
writing. High in nutritional
value, they require strong teeth
and sturdy jaws. They make for
tough chewing.

But what about an
undergraduate who wishes to
read of historical events in a
more general and dramatic
fashion? There are such books,
both fiction and nonfiction. The
facts in them are correct and
balanced, yet they move along
at a more spritely pace. The
prose is lively yet the informa-
tion is deadly accurate.

The Guns of August by Bar-
bara Tuchman is a prime exam-
ple. The build-up to the beginn-
ing of World War I and the hor-
rors of that awful first month
are graphically presented. The
Glory and the Dream by
William Manchester gives a
bread sweeping picture of the
past forty years of American
life. Bruce Catton’s three-
volume centennial history of the

Civil War is vivid and exciting.
(I confess to having sat up until
2 a.m. one night to.read how it

all came out!) Other books
which come to mind are The
Greek Way by Edith Hamilton,
Game Plan for Disaster by
Clark Mollenhoff and The
United States and China by
John Fairbank

There is good fiction, too.
Athens during her final days as
a free state in The Last of the

show’’, for example), and one of
the new record’s standout
tracks, ‘Long Way Home’,
uses the same sort of haunting
harmonica opening as the open-
ing track from Crime (Supertra
calls yet another song, ‘Gone
Hollywood”’ its ‘‘last link’’ to
Crime of the Century).

Despite the inevitable com-
parisons, however, Breakfast in
America easily stands on its
own as one of the best LPs
released so far this year.
Whether you like the band or
not, Supertra is and has always
been unique in its melodies and
overall sound (not to mention
concert sound—check ’em out if
you can). Rick Davies’ vocals
are as good as ever on the new
album, and Roger
Hodgson’sstill tend to get on my
nerves. In short. if you haven’t
joined the Supertramp band-
wagon yet, now may well be the
time. Ignore the single (“The
Logical Song’) and buy the
LP—it’s well worth the money.

North Star Band To Perform

Appearing tonight in the

highly recommended by the
Allstars and Skip Castro Band,
as well as the guys playing this
Tuesday, the Nighthawks.
Their music is a fusion of many
styles — rock, jazz, R & B and
country — and is combined to
form a style that is all their own

the defunct Flying Burrito

This six piece band puts a lot
of energy into their rhythm sec-
tion and high harmonies, leav-
ing the lead guitar, piano, and
pedal steel plenty of freedom to
complement their songs. Al
Johnson originated the band,
and plays acoustic guitar, as
well as sings and writes many
of the songs. With the pedal
steel genius of Jay Jessup, the
distinctive lead guitar work of
Gannt Kushner, the driving per-
cussion of Paul Goldstein and
the power house songwriting
and vocal talents of bassist Jim
Robeson and pianist Lou Hager,
the band has proven itself to be
one of today’s most dynamic
and innovative country-rock
acts.

will be $1.50 for students,
somewhat more than usual
because of the large size of the
band, and the fact that they are
highly recommended. Their

that their reception will be so
good that she can route other
excellent acts from Atlanta
through Lexington to D. C. This
is an excellent opportunity for
students to support the Cockpit
music scene, so that it can con-

Show time will begin at 8:00

Baseball Improves

Under Chuck Kroll

by Chris Sisto

If one word could sum up the
1979 baseball season, according
to head coach Chuck Kroll, it
would be ‘“‘frustration.’’ The
Generals showed this as they
finished the season with a bitter
taste in their mouths, dropping
a doubleheader to rival VMI, 3-2
and 6-3. They were in both
games but were overcome in
the late innings when no timely
hitting was produced. The
Generals finished out the
season at 4-17 over all and 2-8 in
ODAC play

The frustration and poor
record is blamed on tough luck
and youth. Kroll said, ‘‘We real-
ly didn’t get our share of the
breaks this year and we
couldn't put it together because
of this.’’ Kroll mentioned a few
‘bad breaks’’ independent of
the team’s play. One example is
scheduling. During the April
break the Generals had to play
seven games in six days. “We
couldn't have any formal prac-
tices during exam week
because of school regulations
and then had to go out and play
a major league  schedule,”’
Coach Kroll added later.

The youth problem caused
some inexperience in a few of

the losses. “Our team was
tough enough to be in most of
the games,” Kroll said, ‘‘but
several times in close contests
our inexperience killed us.”
This is proven by a look at the
Generals roster. There are only
four seniors graduating and
seven other upperclassmen.
The rest of the team is made up
of fifteen freshmen.

Despite the disappointment of
this season, Coach Kroll is
pleased with many aspects of
his team and is optimistic of the
Generals’ future. ‘‘Although our
record wasn’t so great, I ac-

compl shed some of the goals —

I'd set at the beginning of the
year and I know some of the
players fulfilled some of
theirs,’’ he said. However, he
didn’t say exactly which goals
he set or made. Coach Kroll was
also pleased with the team’s at-
titude. He called the team ‘‘gut-
sy” and said they never gave
up. Kroll was happy about the
enthusiasm from the school.
“The administration was very
supportive,’ he said ‘‘and the
maintenance department did a
helluva job getting the field
ready for our games.”’

As for the future. Coach Kroll

quarter and, ultimately, the
game belonged to Roanoke.
Roanoke exploded early and
before the Generals could get
settled down, they were on the
short end of a 40 score. John
Black took a John Kemp pass on
an extra-man situation and
fired it home for the only W&L
goal of the period. Roanoke add-

ed two more and at the end of

 

the first quarter it was 6-1.

As if the lead wasn’t big
enough, one more got past
goalie Bob Clements not much
more than a minute into the se-
cond quarter and it was 7-1.
From this point on W&L took
full control of the game, but
their recovery efforts fell short
as Roanoke was still able to
squirt a few more into the net
before the contest was over.

The Generals outscored their
opponents 3-2 in the second
period. After Art Caltrider
scored and John Black got
another, it was a little closer at
7-3. Roanoke got one more
before Mike Pressler dented the
net, and at halftime the
Generals still trailed, 8-4.

Jay Foster and Kemp got two
more tallies for W&L at start of
the third period and things were
looking up for the Generals as
the gap closed to 8-6. But before
the third period was over
Roanoke netted two more, mak-
ing it 10-6 with only a quarter to
play.

Although the \“enerals never
led in the game, t. ey rallied for
three very quick yoals within
five minutes of the final
quarter. Black had his third of
the day, followed by Kemp’s se-
cond and an unassisted goal by
George Santos.

Washington & Lee Golf

by Ed Taylor

What is it like to play golf at
Washington and Lee and why
would a student attend W&L in-
stead of a Division 1 school to
play golf?

The golf program W&L pro-
vides ‘‘a chance for a boy to
continue with his athletic in-
terest without causing major in-
roads into his academic pur-
suits,’ explained Coach Buck
Leslie. W&L’s philosophy
toward athletics is that a stu-
dent must pursue academics
first and athletics second.
Coach Leslie impresses this
upon his golfers and they come
to realize that golf at W&L is in-
deed a supplement to their
classwork. In addition, the ap-
proach to W&L golf is low-key in
the sense that no_ athletic
scholarships are given but at
the same time it is a determined
one in its pursuit for athletic ex-
cellence.

Because no athletic scholar-
ships per se are awarded, a
W&L golfer relies on his love for
the game and the desire for
competition as his motivating
forces. Furthermore, little
recognition is awarded to the
golf team when compared with
lacrosse, football, or basket-
ball. As a result, the players
must retain their satisfaction
from the game through in-
dividual pride.

This year’s team compiled a
14-2 record, finished second in
the ODAC tournament and

received an NCAA bid to the
Division III playoffs to be held
May 15-18. This marks the third
straight time that W&L has
received an NCAA bid. In 1977,
the team finished as ODAC
champions and ranked 7th na-
tionally. In 1978 the team
repeated as ODAC champions
and returned to the NCAA tour-
nament. Furthermore, Coach
Leslie was named ODAC’s
Coach of the Year in both 1977
and 1978.

Jerry Maatman, Washington
and Lee’s first golf All-
American wrote an article con-
cerning what golf at W&L

 

appearance.

Guts like this have led the golf team are ee

meant to him in his four years
at W&L. In the article he said,
“Although two schools in the
Big Ten Conference offered me
athletic scholarships, I chose
Washington and Lee because of
its excellent reputation and the
University’s philosophy of pro-
moting intercollegiate sports as
a supplement to a student’s
total college education.”
Indeed, the student-athlete
philosophy that Maatman
pointed out and the fact that a
student is given the chance to
participate in college athletics
are two of the major aspects of
the golf program at W&L.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Notes and
more notes

If any student group has a right to feel disillusioned,
we must grant it to the Student Activities Board. After
amassing a large profit on Fancy Dress, the SAB op-
timistically planned a major concert for the spring—
only to have the performance fall through in the face
of a web of complicated contract promises, which
W&L simply cannot provide. Through no fault of their
own, the SAB and the student body have lost nearly
$2,000 of their funds—and the prevailing attitude now
is one of contemplation. Should W&L even bother to
try booking ‘‘big name”’ concert groups in the future?

Compared with the concert halls in Roanoke and
Charlottesville, our own facilities are clearly—and
understandably—less extensive. Many campus
figures feel that W&L can no longer compete in this
business. To that end, there is scheduled a conference
of student and administration leaders to debate the
question next week. If you have any opinions or sug-
gestions in this area, contact an SAB member before
next week...

a

W&L’s Alpha Circle of ODK enlarges its range of
activities every year, and Vice-President Craig Cor-
nett organized one of the most impressive of these re-
cent events yesterday: a ‘“community symposium”’ of
leading town and student figures. Several dozen peo-
ple participated in the 3-hour conference, which
covered topics from fraternity controversy to the
pressures of reporting an honor violation.

Virtually all the townspeople present expressed
their gratitude for the chance to become “‘better in-
formed.” And they were free to share their insights
with the students—the most surprising fact being that
none of them had evil words to say about fraternities
this year. Most noted a recent improvement in
behavior and apprearance, and even more asserted
that fraternities are no worse now than they were
decades ago. So all you indecisive faculty members,
please take note...

aK

For the first time in some five years, a public honor
trial was held this morning in Lee Chapel. These hear-
ings are open (and to be heard) only by members of
the W&L community; since the circulation of the
Ring-tum Phi is somewhat larger than that, we can-
not cover the trial in regular news fashion. Even so,
we encourage any letters or opinions on the conduct of
the hearing and its effectiveness.

Letters To The Editor

Thanks to RtP-Race workers

Dear Editor,

This past Sunday the Third Annual Ring-
tum-Phi 15 KM Road Race was run through
the streets of Lexington and Rockbridge
County. I wish to express my appreciation to
the thirty-five students, dates and W&L staff
members who came out at 6:30 Sunday morn-
ing as volunteer race marshalls, timers, etc.
Four hundred fifty-eight dollars was raised
for the fight against Multiple Sclerosis.

Special thanks go out to President Huntley
who started the race, race co-chairmen Jack

Coffey and Fernando Mancias, and Mike
Wenke, Jim Berlin, Craig Cornett, Mike
Powell, Jay Blumberg, Joe Dashiell, Henry
Weeks and Coach Dick Miller. The race was a
great success due to the hard work of the
aforementioned volunteers and the runners,
who came from all over the state and were
very pleased with the course and organization
of the race, many committing themselves
already for next year’s race.

Jerry Darrell

Race Director

Low academic interest condemned

Dear Editor:

Events over the past year here at W&L
have prompted me to question the health of
intellectual excitement on this campus. A
friend started my doubts about the at-
mosphere when he quoted a professor who
said the student body’s attitude toward
studies was awful. Although my first reaction
was defensive, I’m afraid I can’t be as sup-
portive of the atmosphere here as I once was.

Washington and Lee presents itself as a
school humming with intellectual curiosity
and activity. But where is that curiosity and
activity? Where is that desire to expose
ourselves to the educational and cultural op-
portunities the school offers? How much drive
is there to get a broad liberal arts education
and to develop our capacity to understand a
wide variety of disciplines? I do not see that
curiosity, that activity, that desire, or that
drive, and the absence of _ those
characteristics disturbs me.

What has contributed to my dissatisfac-
tion? Miniscule attendance at the concerts the
music department arranges; almost negligi-
ble attendance among students not required
to attend. Generally light attendance at Con-
tact presentations. A conversation in which a
student says there is no way he could take a
particular course that meets early Tuesday
and Thursday mornings because he would
still be hungover from the party Wednesday
night. Another conversation: a student is
disgusted that a professor insists the student
attend class even though the student is taking
the course pass-fail. A student asking me to
recommend an easy course or two for the next
term. Not an interesting course, but an easy
course. Professors being routinely evaluated
on the basis of their grading, not on their
teaching ability or knowledge.

A friend had a liberal arts curriculum last
term that consisted of: managerial finance,
regulated industries, business law, and com-
puter science. That’s a tough schedule, but it
hardly reflects a quest for an understanding
of the mysteries of the universe or the human
condition. Some people will be alarmed that I
would draw a generalization of the whole stu-
dent body from the schedule of one friend, but
the point is that I don’t think that schedule or
the attitude about Thursday morning classes
or the attitude about attending classes in a
pass-fail course or the desire to find easy
courses is an isolated incident. I think those
attitudes are fairly prevalent, and I wonder

where I can find the intellectualism that col-
lege campuses are supposed to foster.

As much as the faculty complains about the
students’ declining interest in academics in
recent years, I don’t think the entire blame
should rest on the students. In a couple of
classes I took recently, the professor an-
nounced a special help class as exams
neared. That’s admirable, but the professor
then felt obliged to cancel one of the
regularly-scheduled classes to ‘‘make up’’ to
the students, I suppose, the inconvenience of
coming to the help session. The professor’s
own attitude and teaching ability have an im-
portant effect on the class’ interest. That ef-
fect has certainly been strong in my
academic life, and I think a professor should
first react to any detected drop in interest by
examining his teaching methods.

I won’t be simplistic. Low interest in
academics, if it has hit this campus recently,
as the faculty maintains, is not entirely the
result of any faction’s force on campus;
neither the faculty nor the students nor frater-
nity life nor the administration is totally at
fault for the low level of intellectualism at
Washington and Lee. Am I the only one to
notice the overemphasis on grades among the
students? Am I the only student who is
disturbed about parties’ reign at academics’
expense? I am not presumptuous enough to
think so. But if there is a widespread percep-
tion that the intellectual atmosphere here is in
poor health, we should try to alter the com-
bination of teachers’ skills, students’
backgrounds, fraternity activity, and ad-
ministration priorities to produce a stronger
interest in the intellectual side of college life.

I would never say college exists merely for
pedantry or total academic immersion; ex-
tracurricular activities are vital to the well-
rounded adult colleges should graduate. But
at W&L we need to concentrate now on restor-
ing an atmosphere of excitement in learning.
That excitement, not high grades and not
fraternity parties and not an easy ride
through four more years of school, should be
the Washington and Lee community’s goal.
Now, I simply do not see that excitement as
our highest priority. Joe Ripley
Editorial Note: Many thanks, Mr. Ripley, for
your letter. There is a problem, to be sure, but
with the interest and force of expression that
you — and hopefully others — exhibit, there
will be some necessary changes in orienta-
tion.

Miami Dean To Deliver
Tucker Law Lecture

Soia Mentschikoff, dean of
the University of Miami School
of Law, will deliver the 31st an-
nual John Randolph’ Tucker
Lecture in Law next Saturday
May 12 at Washington and Lee
University.

Ms. Mentschikoff’s topic will
be ‘Decision Making, Decision
Consensus — A _ Normative
Analysis.’’ The lecture, open to
the public, will take place at

11:30 a.m. in the Moot Court
Room in Lewis Hall.

A law graduate of Columbia
University, Ms. Mentschikoff
was admitted to the New York
State bar in 1937 and was
associated with law firms in
New York City from 1937 to
1949. She was associate chief
reporter for the Uniform Com-
mercial Code from 1949 to 1951

and a lecturer at the University
of Chicago from 1951 to 1962.

In 1962 she joined the law
faculty of the University of
Miami, and became dean of the
law school in 1974.

Ms. Mentschikoff’s visit is
scheduled to coincide with spr-
ing reunions for alumni of both
the undergraduate and law divi-
sions at W&L.

the date. You could tell from
their attitude.”’

Evidently, phone negotiations
lasted so long that Firefall
never even received the con-
tract, as revised by Cappeto,
before Saturday the 5th.
“Firefall’s agent never told
them we couldn’t provide 300
amps of electricity... and so,
their manager refused even to
unload the truck. From 11 a.m.
until 2:30, we made all efforts to
‘get a portable generator. And at
2:30, the manager informed us
that — even if we got a
generator — the concert
wouldn’t start until 11 p.m. or
midnight, because of the
delay,”’ said Cappeto. At that
point, even the Firefall
manager recommended
cancellation. Cappeto conclud-
ed, ‘‘The point is, this is no fault
of Firefall or W&L. The pro-
blem was in the home office of
their agents, who never told the
band of our refusal to meet cer-
tain conditions. Had _ they
known, they never would have
agreed to play at all — and we
would have had time to drop

down to somebody less well-
known, and less demanding.
But how far down can you go in
popularity, trying to avoid these
riders, and still retain an au-
dience?

The SAB faces an approx-
imate loss of $1,000 on the pro-
ject, though they are currently
paying nothing to Firefall.

The money allocated for the
concert, some $13,000, will not
be spent until the question of
possible legal action by Firefall
is settled, according to SAB co-
chairman Hank Hall in the
group‘s Monday meeting.

When speaking to the E. C. on
the matter, Hall made a state-

ment that may well turn pro-
phetic: ‘In the future, there
won’t be any large concerts. If
they have them, they won’t be
school sponsored.’’ Cappeto
echoes these sentiments: ‘“The
trend is away from small
schools. We are one of the few
that even try to book major acts
— and I’m not sure we should in
the future, for this is but a
single example of what we con-
tend with in every concert we
book.”

Approximately 650 advance
tickets were sold. Ticket
refunds are available until Fri-
day in the Student Center.

ceeded the late Earl S. Matting-
ly as treasurer.

When he became treasurer,
Washington and Lee’s annual
operating budget was
$3,550,687.

This year,
$10,075,646.

Whitehead was educated at
the University of Tampa (Fla.),
where he was director of public
relations for five years. For the
next five years he was national
finance director for the Na-
tional Conference of Christians
and Jews, and from 1955 to 1958
was executive director of the
Empire State Foundation of In-
dependent Liberal Arts Col-
leges in New York, an agency
similar to the 12-member
Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges, of which
Washington and Lee was a foun-
ding member in 1953.

Almost as soon as he became
treasurer — a year later, in 1967
— Washington and Lee received
two related collections of art ob-
jects that were, in time, to

become of exceptional im-
portance in the academic and
art worlds, almost solely
through the efforts of
Whitehead and his wife, Celeste

the late-18th- and early-19th-
centuries, and nearly a hundred
undiscovered —- almost
discarded —- paintings of
Louise Herreshoff a turn-of-the-
century artist who, Whitehead’s
research discovered, ranks her
among the premiere talents of
American expressionist art.

Whitehead is one of only three
persons ever to have been for-
mally honored twice by the stu-
dent newspaper with its Ring
tum Phi award — for the se-
cond time last week, but initial-
ly in 1975 when he _ was
characterized by the students
as ‘financial wizard par ex-
cellence, imaginative baron of
the porcelain and portrait tours,
king of the blue butterflies and,
most important, friend to every
one of us at Washington and
Lee.

Dining Hall Changes

Evans Dining Hall will alter
its food service program star-
ting Tuesday due to construc-
tion closing the kitchen, but the
main dining hall will not close.

The expansion program,
which will enlarge the kitchen
but not affect the dining hall
has to start on the 15th so the
project can be completed by
September 1.

Jerry Darrell, director of
university dining and food ser-
vices, said that he plans to use
cooking facilities at VMI and to
cook out on grills frequently,
but students will still eat meals
here.

Darrell said the refrigeration,
drink facilites, and serving
lines will still be available. He
has outlined several programs
to cope with the construction
and the closed kitchen, and says
he hopes students may like the
change from ‘‘the institutional
cooking they've had all year.”’

Hopefully, a grill can be put
