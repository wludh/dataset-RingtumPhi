Library ‘Moving Day”
Planned for Jan. 10

40 kegs of beer and two bands

As the fall term nears its
close, work continues to rush on
at a mad pace in McCormick
Library for the move to their
new quarters. The move is
scheduled for January, 1979,
barring any unforeseen delays.

Though a _ strike among
manufacturers of library shelv-
ing threatens total completion
of the interior equipment on the
designated date, plans are still
in full force for the movement of
many library books during the
Christmas break — to be
climaxed by a university ‘‘mov-
ing day’’ on Wednesday, Jan.
10. Under the direction of stu-
dent chairman Steve Mangan, a
committee of students and
faculty has been formed to co-
ordinate the day’s events.

If all goes according to plan,
all furniture, special collec-
tions, and oversized books will

be moved to the new facility
before Jan, 10. What will re-
main in McCormick for move-
ment by volunteers, is approx-
imately 40-50% of the regular
stack books.

In a vote of resounding ap-
proval and enthusiasm, the
faculty agreed to cancel class
meetings on Jan. 10 — a
measure unheard of in recent
years — with the understanding
that students will choose to par-
ticipate in the ‘‘moving day.”

Tentative plans call for each
worker — whether student,
faculty member, or town resi-
dent — to make 18 delivery trips
to and from the new library.
The library staff estimates that
this will take approximately six
hours, beginning at 8:30 a.m.
with an hour break for lunch.

The committee stressed,
though, that the day’s events

Newspapers will not change
drastically between now and
the year 2000, according to
Harold S. Gulliver, editor of
theAtlanta Constitution..

Gulliver spoke in Lee Chapel
Monday night in the first of a
series of lectures presented by
the ethics program, Society and
the Professions.

Gulliver said he served on a
committee organized to con-
sider the future of newspapers.
He noted that in the last decade,
newspapers have experienced
remarkable technological ad-
vances.

Possible future developments
include a laser system which
can edit type while the
newspaper presses are rolling
and an alternate form of
newsprint produced from a
fibrous plant.

Gulliver, editor of the Atlanta
Constitution since 1975, also
mentioned several areas of con-
cern in the journalism profes-
sion.

The first area, which he term-
ed “the kiss and tell school of
journalism,” involves coverage
of the private lives of public of-
ficials. As an example, Gulliver

can hardly be classified as
“work.’’ The movement of the
books will be the central event,
certainly — but plans are
underway for a veritable circus
of ‘‘side  attractions,’’
guaranteed to make the univer-
sity moving day an affair to
remember.

For te hungry, the day will
begin with hot coffee and
donuts. This will be followed
with a complimentary lunch for
ail workers, courtesy of Jerry
Darrell and Evans Dining Hall.
And to aid the digestive pro-
cess, taped music will play on
campus throughout the day
(how’s that for a first...).

Local and regional TV-radio
stations have been contacted,
and will be present at the move-
ment site. Station officials have
called the plan ‘exciting and in-
novative,”’ and will provide
generous news exposure.

The committee has also made
plans to produce a memorial

“grain cup,” to be given to all

participants. Other incentive

ideas; such as T-shirts and raf-

fles for larger prizes are still in

The Executive Committee
began serious discussion of
establishment of a Grade-
Review Board at the E.C.
meeting Monday night.

Bob Willis, sophomore E.C.:

representative and a member
of the subcommittee in-
vestigating the proposal, said a
grade-review committee would
be ‘‘very hard for us to form,”
especially since grades cannot
now be overturned. Under the
present system, the professor
has the final say.

Willis made three recommen-
dations to the E.C. as steps
toward a Grade-Review Board:

—that students have a right to
see anything that is graded
(such as final examinations) ;

—professors should outline in
detail the requirements of the
course and the percentage of
the final grade each test will
represent;

—initiate an ‘‘appeal pro-
cess’’ empowering the heads of
departments and the dean of the
college to overturn a final
grade.

The committee will present
its formal recommendations to
the E.C. at the Nov. 27 meeting.

In other action at Monday’s
E.C. meeting, which was noted
for being one of the briefest on
record, the committee made
tentative plans to cancel next
week’s meeting. The committee
will meet in the event of crisis.

 

The Harris Computer:
versatile but troublesome

Last in a series

by Stuart Snyder

The Harris 125 Computer,
Washington and Lee’s newest
computer, is the most
sophisticated and _ versatile
computer that the university
has ever owned. Yet, it ap-
parently has been the most
troublesome of W&L’s four
computers.

The 125 serves both the
Academic and Administrative
needs of the university at the
same time. According to Dr.
Robert B. Brownell, former
director of the Computer
Center, this was not the case
with the 1130, the old computer.
The Administrative and
Academic uses of the old com-
puter were completely
separated because the 1130
could handle only one problem
ata time.

At first, the Administrative
time alloted for the computer
outnumbered that of the
Academic time, but this

gradually changed, stated
Brownell. Finally, the Ad-
ministrative and Academic
times allowed on the computer
were about even.

However, according to
Brownell, this was not totally
satisfactory, because it was for-
seen that the Academic demand
was going to keep on expanding.
Thus the need for a new com-
puter existed.

According to Brownell, the
new computer had to serve the
students, faculty and ad-
ministrators at the same time,
have security in the system so
that no one could reach the Ad-
ministrative files, and be flexi-
ble in it’s applications.

Dr. Thomas Imeson, director
of the Computer Center adds,
the new computer had to con-
tain a large “‘on line’”” memory
and utilize the most currently
used high level computer
language.

Both agreed that cost com-
patable with the University
played a major role in the selec-
tion of the computer.

The selection committee con-
sisting of: Dr. John A. Wise, the
committee chairman, Dr.
Robert B. Brownell, Dr.
Thomas C, Imeson, Dr. Robert
A. Roberts, and the late Dr. Ed-
ward F. Turner Jr. made their
choice of computer system
from six major companies.
These companies were:
Hewlett Packard, Digital
Equipment Corporation,
I.B.M., Data General, Interdata
and the Harris Corporation.

According to Brownell, Har-
ris was included because a
faculty member knew one of the
operators at a Harris Installa-
tion in Arkansas..

A good part of the decision in
favor of the Harris System was
based on the committee’s im-
pressive two-day encounter

Dartmouth Faculty Moves

to Close Fraternities

Today, it is an accepted fact
that very few universities in
America can boast (or bemoan)
the existence of a_ thriving
fraternity system more than
Washington and Lee. With ap-
proximately 70% of the class of
1982 pledged to fraternities,
W&L remains a citadel of the
Greek system. Even so, the
‘‘orandfather”’ of fraternity col-
leges — where the system is the
strongest and the _ highest
percentage of men belong to
fraternities — has always been
Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire.

Many W&L students have
proudly compared our system
to Dartmouth’s — and with
some justice. As a result, the re-
cent controversy surrounding
this northern bastion of frater-
nity life should hit pretty close
to home on this campus...

HANOVER, N.H. — The
faculty of Dartmouth College
recently voted to close the 20
fraternities on the campus, as a
result of a major anti-fraternity

Library landscaping begins

by Charles Tucker

Anyone who has _ recently
traversed the back-campus
area has undoubtedly noticed
the presence of thousands of
grass-like potted plants
blanketing the area between
Newcomb and Reid Halls. Com-
monly known as ‘monkey
grass,’’ their present location in
front of Reid Hall certainly
brightens the construction-
marred turf in that area. But
the location is only temporary.
The durable monkey grass

represents another in the final ,
stages of the library movement, |

and is to be planted in the mall
surrounding the new structure.
Douglas E. Brady, Jr., pro-
jects manager of Washington &
Lee, said that much of this ex-
terior landscaping will be com-
pleted before the end of interior
construction. Immediate land-
scaping priority is being given
to the most visible areas — the
front mall and the land under
the walkway to the new

building.

This week's warm weather has heldped speed the I

campaign. The school’s
trustees, many of whom are
alumni, will take final action on
the measure in a vote next
February.

The faculty move comes in
the wake of the phenomenal
success of “National Lam-
poon’s Animal House,’’ a com-
edy dealing with a college
dean’s attempt to rid the cam-
pus of a hard-drinking, wild-
living fraternity house. Ac-
cording to Chris Miller, one of
the screenwriter’s for the movie
(and a 1963 Dartmouth
graduate), many of the in-
cidents in “‘Animal House’’ are
based on true events during his
years at Dartmouth.

The displeasure of the, Dart-
mouth faculty was already at a
high point previous to the
movie’s release. Last spring,
about a dozen people were
treated for alcoholic convul-
sions during ‘‘Sink Night,” the
installation ceremony for

tionally the year’s wildest
celebration.

Even though records show
that fraternity men at Dart-
mouth have a higher grade-
point average than the overall
campus population, there have
been repeated charges of ‘‘anti-
intellectualism’’ from the facul-
ty. Professor James Epperson,
leader of the anti-fraternity
drive, accused the houses of
“encouraging alcoholism,
misbehavior and values that
have no place in institutions of
higher learning.”’

No one on the Dartmouth

campus is willing to predict the -

outcome of the conflict, but stu-
dent opposition to the proposi-
tion continues to run very high.
More than half of the school’s
4,000 students belong to fratern-
ties, and two new sorority
houses are under attack as well.
Recent polls by campus
organizations proved the ex-
istence of a strong sentiment

the formative stages.

Finally, to celebrate the
library move in grand style, the:
committee has approved plans
for a major party in the vacant
McCormick building Wednes-
day night. The celebration is be-.
ing co-ordinated by Burr Datz,
and will feature the music of.
Ace Weems and the Fat Meat,
Boys and the Charlottesville:
All-Stars. Approximately 40°
kegs of beer will be provided.
The party will be open to all
workers during the day, and
their dates.

Final information on what
may well be the most unique

event of the year will be
reported in the Ring-tum Phi as
plans are set. The present plan
calls for a volunteer force of
900-1000 to participate; students
and faculty should compose the
bulk of this number, but_in-
volvement from townspeople
and other campuses is en-
couraged. Music, food, televi-
sion cameras, the faculty in
their shirt-sleeves, a party at
the end, and a chance to per-
form an invaluable service to
the library we've all been
waiting years to see finish-
ed...Such a combination is not
likely to be repeated anytime
soon — so gear up for a one-of-a-
kind experience next Jan. 10.

 

 

Former Sen. James L.
Buckley will speak at
Washington and Lee on Dec. 6 in
Lee Chapel.

Buckley was the Conser-
vative Party Senator from New
York from 197] to 1976, when he
was defeated for reelection by
Daniel P. Moynihan (D-NY).

Perhaps one of Buckley’s best
known achievements as Senator
was The Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
often referred to as_ the
“Buckley Amendment.”’

The Buckley Amendment
allows a student to examine his
permanent record maintained
by educational institutions to
assure the accuracy of its con-

tents.

Presently, Buckley is serving
as director of the investment
banking firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin, and Jenrette.

He is also the vice-chairman
of the Republican National
Committee’s Advisory Council
on General Government and is
Chairman of the Subcommittee
on the Rediscovery of
Federalism.

Sen. Buckley is the brother of
the well-known writer and syn-
dicated columnist William F.
Buckley.

The lecture is being jointly
funded by the Mock Convention
and Contact Committees.

Convention:

One recurrent question that
people raise concerning the
Mock Convention is what exact-
ly does a state chairman do?
This is a difficult question to
answer because the chairman
of a delegation is pretty much
responsible for everything that
concerns his state. These
responsibilities can cut across a
rather broad spectrum _in-
cluding the obvious area of
political research but also fund
raising, building a float, and
even publicity.

As soon as the chairmen are
announced in the winter term
their first task will be to recruit
officers to work within their
delegation. These will include a
treasurer, secretary and any
other positions to carry out the
necessary administrative func-
tions. Next a delegation must be
recruited. The number of this
group depends upon the size of
the delegation at the real con-
vention. Although most people
would prefer to work for their
home state, considering the
number of students from
Virginia at W&L compared to
the numbers neded to fill the
California delegation, one
quickly sees that it is not very
practical to assign students
always according’ to
preference. Despite a rather
diverse student body there

WL
IU

1980

aren’t too many people here
from Nevada, Alaska, or Guam.

Once the delegations are fill-
ed (hopefully by the beginning
of next year) the state chair-
man is responsible for raising
money from corporations,
parents and alumni within his
state. At the same time he must
oversee the research being done
and begin planning for the
parade.

A good deal of leadership is
required to recruit and run a
state delegation. In the end,
however, it is one of the most
rewarding jobs in the Mock
Convention. If you are consider-
ing it, stop by the Mock Conven-
tion office in room 205 of the
University Center.

Troubled Computer System

The major problem with the
125 is it’s large number of unex-
pected ‘‘down”’ sessions, where
the computer goes out of ser-
vice. A good bit of these
“downs” can be attributed to
known causes, but according to
Imeson neither he nor the Har-
ris Corporation know what the

Dr. Robert L. Wilson, Pro-

computer in the world goes
down once every seven hours,
but in those seven hours it can
accomplish what an average
computer would take weeks to
do.

Similarly, if the 1130 were to
break down once a year that
would be comparable to the 125
breaking down once a month,
explains Wilson.

The unexpected ‘‘downs’’ are
caused by uneven flow of elec-
tricity from VEPCO and other
sources attributed to internal
difficulties stemming from
mismanagement by the Harris
Corporation and W&L’s
operators.

The Harris Croporation and
W&L have done several things
to correct this problem:

First, Harris has_ sent
representatives to W&L to

The Ring-tum Phi, Nov. 16, 1978, Page 3

thoroughly inspect the com-
puter. The results have yet to be
made public.

Second, Imeson has turned
back the baud of the computer,
which should not affect the pro-
cessing time of the computer.
Baud is the number of
characters of information pro-
cessed per second.

Other set backs and problems
associated with the 125 are:
dependence on the 1130, over-
crowding of the terminals, and
game users monopolizing the
terminals.

The dependence on the 1130 is
only temporary and is only
limited to Administrative work,
states Mr. O. Lee Dudley,
Director of Data Processing
and Administrative Work.

According to Imeson, the
complete transfer from the 1130
to the 125 will be finished by
next summer.

Originally, the transfer was
to have been completed by the
first of 1979.

In the mean time there exists
a dual system which is very dif-
ficult to operate under, says
Dudley. Converting the pro-
grams is slow work, he adds.

Overcrowding of the ter-
minals is still a problem. But,
hopefully the planned cluster of
terminals in Parmly Hall will
help to alleviate the problem.

There should be no problem

. with game users tying-up ter-

minals in the future. The once
unwritten rules concerning the
rights of computer users is now
posted on the wall in the Com-
puter Center. It states that
game participants must yield to
legitimate student and faculty
use of the computer.

Even so, only time will tell
whether the situation with the
Harris 125 will ever be cleared

up.

 

Gulliver speech

(continued from page 1)
questioned whether Joan Ken-
nedy’s arrest two years ago on
charges of drunk driving truly
constituted a front page story.

Gulliver also criticized the
performance of the media in in-
forming the public of important
issues. He noted that Richard
Nixon was reelected President
months after the burglary at the
Watergate complex.

He also charged that the news
media wrote off the Carter cam-
paign in 1975.

The Atlanta editor voiced con-
cern about the ‘‘overall climate
that affects both the media and
newspapers.’’ He said many
young journalists today believe
“every story is going to be
Watergate.” >

The conflict between the First
Amendment right of free press,
and the Sixth Améndment right
of fair trial also is an area. of
concern, according to Gulliver.

The old IBM 1130 computer. Information in the 1130 is now being transferred to the Harris 125. The

transfer will be finished by summer,

He said that the Supreme
Court’s opinion on the conflict is
typified by Justice Byron
White’s statement that it is
more important to do
something a about crime, than
to write about it.

Gulliver also mentioned that
the number of independent
newspapers in the United States
is quickly decreasing.

He said that there is much to
be said for both local and chain
ownership of newspapers, but
the question of which system is
better ‘finally gets back down
to the people who run them and
what kind of ethics they have.”

Gulliver, a 1957 graduate of
Yale University, joined the staff
of the Atlanta Constitution in
1962 as a reporter, and was ap-
pointed editor in 1975. He has
co-authored a book on George
Wallace, and is presently work-
ing on one about Jimmy Carter.

Al Gordon’s production of
Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House,
running in the Boiler Room
Theatre this week, is the first
show in the University
Theatre’s shortened ‘regular
season.’’ Though Gordon’s is
not an experienced studio pro-
duction, he hardly picked a safe
play with A Doll’s House.

Ibsen’s script is one full of pit-
falls, into some of which I’m
afraid Gordon and his cast have
fallen. Especially in these days
when Ibsen is hailed by many as
a glorious precursor of today’s
feminist movement, there is a
great temptation to read this
play as a veritable ‘“‘woman’s
lib manifesto.”

The danger with staging such
a ‘“‘manifesto’’ is the temptation
to play it too broadly. This
tendency, along with the cast’s
overco ensatio for an embarass-
ingly small audience (even by
W&L standards), served to
make Act I of A Doll’s House a
less than agreeable experience.

Anne Secor’s Nora seemed to
have a vocal range of shrill to
shrill, and modulations of ex-
pression to match. It was dif-
ficult to imagine that her
thoughless Nora, trampling on
Cristine’s (Rose Gordon) feel-
ings at every turn, was also the
same Nora we learn has been
managing to repay a Shylock
for eight long years on a
shoestring budget. Too much
energy at times kills the reflec-
tion we are told must exist
there. ’

Hunt Brown’s’ Torvald
Helmer poses a similar pro-
blem in the first act. Playing too
broadly at times, Brown falls
prey to the temptation to have
“fun” with lines which beckon
to be trifled with, but which
shouldn’t be. Brown’s relish of
these early scenes leads to no
impression that Torvald actual-
ly enjoys tormenting Nora (his
wife), rather than playing at

OF

 

wi

playing with her. Brown’s Tor-
vald is not the aloof, precise
character that Ibsen wrote.

A part of Brown’s problems
are due to casting. The expan-
siv: qualities he has at his com-

mand do not mesh well with the
fastidious and distanced Tor-
vald.

Dona Flor; an autumn gem

 

by Dick Barron

It’s that time of year again —
the big flood of Hollywood
movies that thrilled you all
summer and in the early fall
has finally dried up. You've
seen Grease eighteen times and
you’ve committed Animal
House to memory. The tattered
remains ofStar Wars and Satur-
day Night Fever have been pull-
ed from the screen and Sgt.
Pepper’s has been put to rest.

So what’s left for America’s
hungry moviegoers (especially
if they’re in Lexington)? Well,
never fear, Dona Flor’s here.
Dona Flor and Her Two
‘Husbands, that is.

Dona Flor and Her Two
Husbands catches the viewer
off guard and keeps him there.
The film opens with a scene of
several men sitting around a
table drinking, singing, and
wearing dresses — everything’s
okay, however, because it’s
canival time. The gang mar-
ches around, singing and
laughing merrily, but suddenly
the merriest one of the bunch
drops dead — stone cold. He
turns out to be the late husband
of Dona Flor. Dona Flor spends
her mourning period
remembering her beloved
Vadhino in a lengthy flashback
sequence. Theirs was an un-
iortunate marriage — Vadhino
went oul gambling to leave
Dona Flor at héme with her
cooking. Vadhino satisifed her
desires, but did little else for
her...

After Vadhino’s death, Dona
Flor marries the local druggist,
a portly man with a “‘passion
for classical music.’’ He leaves
all his passion with the oboe and
leaves Dona Flor physically un-
satisfied. He gives here the
security that the first husband
failed to give, but without the
fireworks of the first marriage.
As they say — “you can’t
always get what you want.”’

That’s a very brief summary
of this long, complex story. One
could detail the plot twists for
the next few pages, but in the in-

' terest of intelligence that one’ll

fectively presented by director
Bruno Barreto. This kind of
story has so many potentially
dangerous areas for a director
that for Barreto to have even
made the film coherent is quite
an accomplishment. Visually
the film has a certain feeling of
realism which is rarely seen in
recent movies. A large number
of the scenes are shot with
natural light in obviously real
surroundings. There are very
few sets.

But that’s not enough. Any

lex, thinking woman (the
woman she is meant to be even
in ActI).

In the second act, Brown also
seems to get Torvald under con-
trol. Torvald becomes patroniz-
ing but detached from’ Nora.
Brown finally makes his Tor-
vald “‘play”’ without putting too
much of himself in to the game.

surety to his portrayal of Dr.

thy is Rank’s momentary lapse
when he thinks he has offended
Nora with his declaration of
secret love for her.

Rose Gordon as Cristine
Linde turned in a superb per-
formance. Her sensitivity
throughout the play, refreshing-
ly incongruous in the first act, is
a delight to watch. It is good to
watch Mrs. Gordon stretch her
“dramatic legs’’ after her last
two, rather burlesque parts.

Except for occassionally
sticking his nose a bit too high in
the air, David Jefferson Sor-
rells plays a convincingly jaded
Nils Krogstad. He successfully
avoid crossing the fine line
which separates his role from
the land of Snidely Whiplash
and melodramatic villains.

Pree Ray and Virginia Dutton
as Anna, the nurse, and Helen
the maid, in the tradition of all
well-played domestics, do what
they’re supposed to do.

The play is staged on Tom
Zigler’s well-conceived set, in
the round. The audience seems
to find itself seated on the
periphery of the Helmers’ living
room. This intimacy makes the
loud first act look excessive but
allows the audience to full ap-
preciate the fine acting leeks in
the play.

Act III is dominated by Secor
and Brown’s fine (and unex-
pected) playing of the climax.
Torvald’s blow up contrasts
very well with his ‘‘reconcilia-
tion’’ with Nora. In the end, a
real dramatic achievement is
gained by the final curtain.

Ducks Deluxe
Don’t Mind Rockin’ Tonite
RCA-AFLI-3025

Ducks Deluxe was formed in
1972 out of the Brinsley
Schwarz/Dave Edmunds axis
which was_ currently
dominating the pub scene in and
around London. They released
two albums and several singles
on British RCA before their
break-up in the summer of 1975.

For the last three years the
Ducks have been a ghost band,
mentioned often in the context
of the surging commercial suc-
cess of friends Dave Edmunds
and Graham Parker, but vir-
tually unheard of due to the fact
that both of their albums have
been long out-of-print.

This set the stage for Don’t
Mind Rockin’ Tonite, a
generous (seven songs per side)
collection of the band’s best
work. The liner notes’ claims
that the Ducks ‘“‘helped mould
the future history of rock ’n’
roll” are somewhat exag-
gerated, but the fact remains
that without the pioneering
work of such forgotten heroes
as Ducks Deluxe and Brinsley
Schwarz the names_ Elvis
Costello and Nick Lowe would
hardly be the household words
they are today.

As for the music itself, there
is something for everybody and
more on Don’t Mind Rockin’...
The band moves with ease from
melodic, Beatles-esque songs
like ‘‘Love’s Melody’ to
delightful cover versions of
“It’s All Over Now,” “I Fought
the Law,’’ and ‘“‘Here Comes the
Night.”

Most importantly, the album

and Robin Meredith

has a cohesive feel to it which is
relatively uncommon among
anthologies — rather than jerk-
ing from one high point to
another, it flows with a very at-
tractive sense of consistency.
Just a sideline; the Ducks
may not have had any direct in-
fluence on the future of rock ’n’
roll, but they do provide an in-
teresting basis for speculation
on the future of such American
“Blue Wave’’ bands as _ the
Allstars and the Nighthawks.
Their current status is much
the same as the Ducks’ was six
years ago. It will be interesting
to see if history repeats itself
and the blues become a major
force in the mainstream of
American popular music as a
result of the dues paid by these
local heroes.

along came such writer! as
Burroughs and Lovecraft with
their offspring of fantasy and
horror. ‘“‘Hard-science”’ authors
added space ships complete
with blue prints, robots and in-
terstellar wars.

Then a fantastic thing hap-
pened on the way back and forth
to outer space: Science began to
catch up with science fiction.
The Golden Age stories of the
1930’s and 1940’s began to ap-
pear as truth in the newspapers.
So sometimes today it is hard to
tell the far-seeing scientists
from the old-time science fic-
tion writers. During the last
couple of decades two sub-
species of SF have burgeoned.
Psychological, ecological, uto-
pian stories with a special angle
of vision or point of view are a
strong force in this “new
wave.” It is often experimental
in form and language.

Fantasy is the other flowering
of today’s SF. J.R.R. Tolkien is
the Superman of fantasy, of
course. (The Hobbit is the all-
time bestseller in the
Bookstore.) There are many
others, however, such as C.S.
Lewis, Anne McCaffery,
William Morris and Ellison.

_ Literary critics are now pay-
ing attention to SF as a serious
branch of literature. Le Guin’s
Farthest Shore won the Na-
tional Book Award in 1973, for
instance. No longer a step-child
in the literary world, much
science fiction writing is now
recognized as fine use of
language.

Science fiction is big business
as well as big literature
nowadays. About 15% of all fic-
tion published today falls under
the expansive canopy of SF.
This makes the selection of
new, high quality books increas-
ingly hard. The Bookstore’s
science fiction shelves are four
times as large as they were six

years ago and still they come.

Here’s a short list of some of
the recent arrivals in the
Bookstore along with some of
the all-time greats. Happy
escape to you:
The Time Machine, Wells
The Star Maker, Stapledon
The Dispossessed, Le Guin
Canticle for Leibowitz, Miller
That Hideous Strength, Lewis

Water Polo season

ends at 15-9

by Sam Campbell

The water polo Generals
finished their season last
weekend at the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Water Polo Cham-
pionships at Brown University.
W&L lost to host Brown, Ohio
State, and M.I.T. for an eighth-
place finish. Keith Romich,
Drew Pillsbury, and Bob
Newcomb each had a goal in the
first game, which Brown won
16-3. In all likelihood, Brown
will be picked to represent the
East in the Nationals on the
strength of their play last
weekend.

In Ohio State’s 14-10 win,
Romich had _ six goals,
Newcomb two, and Pillsbury
and Biff Martin one each. Ohio
State seemed to have the edge
on the Generals chiefly because
they had more experienced
players. Romich had four goals
and Biff Martin made a penalty
shot in the 10-5 loss to MIT.

Coach Bill Stearns looked
upon the trip as a “‘learning ex-
perience,’ but he also
lamented, ‘‘we don’t like to lose
while we’re learning.’’ He ex-
plained that the teams the
Generals regularly play are

simply not of the same calibre
as the teams they faced last
weekend. ‘‘And the only way
we'll be able to improve our
standing,” he pointed out, ‘‘is to
play these teams regularly.”
Stearns spoke of tentative plans
to take a team out to California

late this summer to play some
of the best teams in the country,
and possibly adding some Ivy
League schools to the schedule
next year, but he cited the lack
of money as the greatest hin-
drance to this plan.

Overall, Stearns said he was
very pleased with the play of
the inexperienced team
throughout the season, and
praised Keith Romich for his
fine job in the Easterns, as well
as the other games. The
Generals finished the season
with a 15-9 record against the
best competition in the eastern

United States. Looking forward
to next year, Stearns hopes the
Generals will be able to ac-

complish in one goal that which —

eluded them this season: a win
over Richmond. Romich led the
team in scoring with 78 goals,
while Martin had 74.

Generals comeback fails at
end - lose to GU 25-24.

by Bill Whalen

What does it take to win a
football game? The Washington
and Lee Generals must be
thinking this after losing to the
highly ranked Georgetown
Hoyas on a field goal with eight
seconds left. Last Saturday, the
Generals, who at one point trail-
ed 24-3, came back to lead 25-24
before Jim Corcoran’s 20 yard
field goal ended the game at
27-25. The loss gave Coach Gary
Fallon’s first W&L team a final
record of 2-8.

“TI was very disappointed with
the outcome because we had
played so well to that point,”

said Fallon. “I am also very
disappointed with the  of-
ficiating; it left a lot to be
desired.’’ What particularly
upset Fallon was a controver-
sial call in Georgetown’s last
drive, which could have cost
W&L the win. On fourth and
three from deep in Hoya ter-
ritory, punter Mike Foster fak-
ed a kick and threw a five yard
pass for a first down. A great
play, right? Wrong! “All their
inter-linemen were _ illegally
downfield,” said Fallon. ‘‘There
should have been a penalty on
the play.’’ As it was, the Hoyas
picked up the first down and

were not ready to quit. W&L
had the ball with mintues left in
the half and scored with 0:49 to
go. The key man in the series
was tailback Stewart Atkinson,
who caught a 35 yard pass and
scored on a two yard run to nar-
row the margin to 249 at
halftime.

In the second half, the
Generals ran off 22 straight
points while holding
Georgetown to three points.
Fallon called it, ‘‘the most en-
joyable half of coaching I have
had.’’ W&L scored once in the
third quarter on an 11 yard pass
to Richard Wiles from Rich

Piranian optimistic about
next year’s soccer team

by Tim Connors

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer Generals finished the
season with a record of 3-8-2,
but, according to Coach Rolf
Piranian, there are many
reasons why one should not look |
back on the season with a great
deal of disappointment.

The Generals fielded a very
young team this year, with only|
six graduating seniors on the
squad. Piranian will miss all
six, however, as he said that
“they each made a tremendous
contribution to W&L soccer.”’
The players which he cited are
co-captains Bill Stone and
Roger Yale, along with Todd
Tyson, Howie Collier, Woods
King and Chuck D’Auria. These
six combined with a promising
nucleus of underclassmen to
play what Piranian called ‘‘the
best fundamental soccer that
has been played here in three
years” (Piranian’s tenure as
head coach).

The season also had its share
of disappointments. Piranian
lamented his team’s inability to
‘play 90 minutes of good soc-
cer,”’ that the Generals had a
“few lapses’ of which the op-
ponents took advantage, and in
so doing, took an early lead in

most games. Conversely, the
Generals were plagued by
wasted scoring opportunities,
as their inability to put the ball
in the net when it counted most,
combined with a number of in-
juries, were the major factors
in W&L posting a losing record.

The Generals played one of
their most demanding
schedules ever, as only VMI
among their opponents had a
losing record. Two teams,
Elizabethtown and Lynchburg
colleges, received post-season
bids to play in the NCAA cham-
pionship for Division III. Next
season, Piranian anticipates
“changing the schedule just a

little’ and he expects the
Generals to be ‘‘very com-
petitive.” Piranian maintains
“an optimistic outlook for next
season, as we (W&L) will be
returning the majority of a
young team.’’ Tri-captains
Dana Samuelson, Doug Dorsey
and Doug Seitz will try to lead
the returning talent from this
year, along with some of the
very talented ‘‘B’’ team
players.

eventually drove to the W&L 3
for the game winning kick.

From the way the game
started, it looked like W&L
could make reservations for an
early bus back to Lexington.
The Hoyas scored on their first
and last possessions of the first
quarter to take an early 14-0
lead. The Generals managed a
44 yard field by Randy Austin to
cut the lead to 14-3, but the
Hoyas scored twice to stretch
their lead to 24-3. One of these
scores, a 89 yard kickoff return,
should not have been allowed,
according to Fallon. ‘‘One of
our men was clipped on the
play,’’ said the coach, ‘‘and it
happened right in front of the of-
ficial.”

The Generals trailed 24-3, but

Bird places ninth
in regional meet

by Greg Branan
Despite finishing ninth in last
Saturday’s NCAA Qualifying
Meet, Rich Bird missed qualify-

‘ing for the NCAA National

Meet. Bob Bates, the only other
W&L runner, finished twenty-
third in the regional meet,
about two minutes behind Bird.

Of ten teams present, eight
were from Virginia. Only the
top two five man teams and the
top three individuals not on
those teams go on to the Na-
tionals next weekend.

Of the race, Coach Dick
Miller commented, ‘‘Rich Bird
ran his best race.’’ Bird’s time
was 26:07 on the five mile
course.

On the team as a whole for the
season, Miller commented that
“considering the number of
freshmen on the team, we did
relatively well.’’ Miller added
that he felt each team member
had improved individually to
some degree.

The Generals’ final record
was 7-8-1, and they finished fifth
in the ODAC.

Hachenburg. The freshman
quarterback enjoyed his best
game of the year, completing 18
of 27 passes for 248 yards and
one touchdown.

The fourth quarter saw the
Generals finally go ahead of the
Hoyas. W&L scored on a five
yard run by Chris Leiser to trail
24-22. Once again, the two point
attempt failed. The Generals
took over on the Hoyas’ 25 after
a fumble but a Hachenburg
pass was intercepted. A strong
rush forced a 16 yard punt, and
the Generals moved to the
Hoyas’ 12 before calling on Ran-
dy Austin. Austin’s field goal
with 3:21 left in the game gave
the Generals their 25-24 lead.

The Hoyas started their final
drive on the 13. They moved 84
yards on 14 plays before Cor-
coran ended the game. Two
plays particularly upset Fallon.
One was the fourth down pass,
while another officiating error
was ‘‘when they (the officials)

_ Stopped the clock to move the

markers. This is against the
rules.”” Unfortunately, these
rules are sometimes overlooked
and someone gets shortchang-
ed. This time it was W&L.

The 1978 football season is
over and the Generals, despite a
2-8 record, made some key im-
provements. The most impor-
tant of these is the emergence of
Rich Hachenburg as a capable
quarterback. Stewart Atkinson
had another outstanding
season, running for a season

Basketball

team
promising

by Bill Whalen

Washington and Lee head basketball
coach Verne Canfield projects an aura of
confidence — and he has good reason to do
so. In his fifteenth year at W&L, Canfield
has compiled a record of 225-116, in-
cluding last year’s 22-6 mark. Moreover,
he has posted a winning record each year
since 1966-67 and has coached W&L to the ©
ODAC basketball championship the last
three years. ‘‘This year’s team is a group
that can do the job at both ends of the
court,’’ says Canfield. ‘“‘We are ag-
gressive, intense and very proud.”’

The last two cager teams have gone 23-5
and 22-6, and the 1978-79 team is of the ,
same caliber. ‘‘We have potentially as
good a team as we have had the past two
years. This year’s team has better ver-
satility than in the past. Many players can
play more than one position.”’

The most notable figure gone from last
year’s squad is All- American Pat Dennis, '
who takes with him a 25 ppg average. To
counteract this, Canfield plans to go to a
more balanced attack. ‘‘We should have
five guys averaging in double figures,”’
said the coach. “Do not expect anyone.to
score more than 17 or 18 ppg.”’ The loss of
Dennis is also cushioned by the return of -
eight lettermen, including three year
starter and senior captain Mike Wenke
(5-10), and three year starter and senior
Dave Leunig (6-9). Other starters return-
ing are senior Ardith Collins (6-5) and
sophomore Rob Smitherman (6-7), who
shared time at the center position last |
year. The rest of the returning lettermen
are senior strong forward Jim Berlin

(6-5), junior small forward Tom Jeffries
(6-3), junior guard Pete Farrell (6-0) and
sophomore shooting guard Carby Hoy
(6-1). Nonlettermen on the squad are |
junior small forward Tracy Hodge (6-3)
and sophomore small forward R.J.
Scaggs (6-2).

Rounding out the squad are three
freshmen. They are 6-5 Travis Patterson,
who will be rotated between center and
power forward; 6-2 Clark New, who will
play at small forward; and 6-0 George
Spears, who will be worked as pointguard.

The probable starters will be Wenke at
point guard; Hoy at shooting guard; Jef-

‘good as ever”

by Jake Purcell

“This team may be as good as we’ve
ever had,’’ says head coach Bill Stearns of
this year’s swim team. Despite the

year’s squad, Stearns is confident of his
team’s ability.
is Last year, W&L amassed a 10-1 regular
»-e« season record, and finished tenth among .
_ Division II] schools. That marked the
fourth consecutive year W&L has finished
= in the top ten. This year’s team will have
to do without seventeen time All-
, American John Hudson, as well as school
record-holders Pete Meem and David
Kant, all graduates of 1978.

Stearns, who sports a .713 winning
percentage in twelve years, does have
} four All-Americans returning to the
squad. Among these are co-captains Keith
Romich and Chip Hoke. Romich, school
=» record holder in the 200 fly and 400 and 800
™ relays, and Hoke, a competitor in the
freestyle, backstroke, and _ individual
medley events, will team with fellow All-
Americans Bob Newcomb, a_ junior
» freestyler, and Jay Diesing, a sophomore

diver, to provide a strong base for Stearns
to build a championship team upon. Ex-
perienced returnees George Irvine, div-
ing, and free stylers Bill Ashe and Rob
Massie will provide the supporting cast.
Freshmen are expected to play a big role
on this year’s squad. Stearns hopes for big
things from first-year men Denny
' Cancelmo, a strong breaststroker who
.. may threaten the school mark before this
year is through. Herb Gressens, a free
styler, Trip Johnstone, a breaststroker,
and diver Peter Moody.
= — The biggest problem Stearns foresees is

that of depth. But the Generals tough

number of Division I opponents, should
develop some of the younger swimmers
_and help solve this problem by February
when the team vies for Virginia and Na-
- tional championships.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A call for help...

If all goes according to plan, it looks as though the
student body will be called into action next January to
aid in the final movement of books from McCormick
Library to the new campus facility. It’s an unor-
thodox plan, to say the least — classes haven’t been
officially cancelled at W&L in many years. More than
that, one is struck by the idealism in the plan: that
students will actually want to give a bit of their time
and energy to help open the library six months ahead
of schedule.

An incredible amount of time-has gone into the plan-
ning for this “‘moving day.” In an effort to make it an
enjoyable event, the committee in charge has planned
refreshments, gifts, and music throughout the day.
Finally, there will be a chance to “‘ring out the old,”’ in
a large party within the empty rooms of McCormick
Library. The day’s activities will certainly be one of
the greatest ‘happenings’ in the history of the
university — a celebration of the opening of its most
ambitious building project.

The senior class has patiently endured three years
of dynamite and digging; more than anyone else, they
should be glad to see a successful end to the library
project. Commerce school students should also
realize that an early move will facilitate restoration
of McCormick — and an end to the overcrowding in
Newcomb Hall. In the end, all students who must use
the W&L library system should be grateful for a
building that will offer increased space, round the
clock hours, and more comfortable surroundings. If
the university as a whole has ever had good reason to
celebrate, this is the time.

Still, the most attractive feature of the ‘‘moving
day”’ is the call for student participation by the
university. To put it quite simply, the university is
putting itself on the line — if the students don’t turn
out for the day’s activities, a later move may not be
feasible until April. Further restoration of the
academic buildings on campus (particularly McCor-
mick) will be delayed. But no one will be deprived
more than the students themselves, who will continue
to lack the first-class research facilities they need so
urgently.

I don’t believe that many universities extend their
trust to the students so totally. After years of hard
work, the administration has chosen to call the
undergraduates into action — to ask them to carry the
responsibility that ‘‘one last mile,’’ and then join in a
celebration for a job well done. Such confidence is
really rare these days. It is my hope that the students
(and faculty, and local residents) will turn out in
force for this project, to prove that confidence in their
responsibility isn’t such a risky proposition after all...

Editor:

It seems that we have arrived at that point at
which the W&L administration will have to
decide whether to unify or to separate the
Undergraduate and Law schools. While verbal
homage has been paid to the concept of ‘‘one stu-
dent body,” practical steps have been made in
the other direction.

While I have no burning preference for either
decision, I would like to see a choice made in
order to eliminate the hoopla surrounding the
issue. Students of both schools are worried that
they will become ‘‘second class students’’ or that
the administration somehow prefers the other
group. Library use, parking, housing, and now
graduation exercises have been drawn into the
confrontation as evidence of some prejudice
against one or the other group.

Positive steps can and must be taken, and
soon, to deliniate the position of the schools, in
order to stop this waste of effort and energy. It
simply is not that large an issue. If the Law
School is to become a separate entity, we need
only continue in the direction we have been tak-
ing, while discounting public statements to the
contrary. If the schools are to remain unified,
then calendars will have to be brougiit closer
together with the Undergraduate calendar being
brought more closely in line with that of the Law
School and most other universities and colleges I
can think of), and policies of sharing the
facilities of both schools will have to be
developed.

In either case, neither school need take a back
seat to the other, unless the current policy of
nondecision continues. In that case, everyone
loses.

Sincerely,
Steven L. Higgs ’80

ETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To The Editor:

I appreciate the complimentary article printed
in last week’s ‘‘Phi’’ on WLUR’s Election Night
coverage, but feel that I would be doing a disser-
vice to all of those who helped out in the
monumental effort if I left the impression that I
was a ‘“‘one-man”’ show (although it does seem a
nice thought). Therefore, for the benefit of those
who watched (or listened) to the coverage, these
people were responsible for the project:

ANALYSTS: Joe Dashiell, Ben Keesee, Mark
Richard, Mike Malasardi, Phil Timp, Buddy
Bahakel, John Flower

TABULATORS/GATHERERS: John Jacob,
Dan Weiss, John Billmyre, Jeff Reiter, Matt
Dennan, Bill Ridge, Bill Parks, John Scott,
David Greer, Charles Tucker

FIELD REPORTERS: Mike Lavitt, Doug
Jackson, Jay Taggert

FIELD TABULATORS: Scott McLam,
Palmore Clark, Currin Snipes, Spencer Leffel,
Mark Turner

TELEVISION PRODUCTION CREW: Chuck
Strome, Shaun Levesque

 

Finally, to all of those who watched and later
commented on the coverage a hearty thank you.
I honestly hope everyone enjoyed it, and hope

. that viewers get as much out of it as we did. Ad-

mittedly, there were mistakes made. But I was
very pleased with the result and believe we did
the school proud with our presentation.

Parking Problems; Delts respond

To The Editor:

I appreciate the fact that there is a serius park-
ing shortage at Washington and Lee, as evidenc-
ed by Mr. Keefe’s recent article. Unfortunately,
it does not seem that it will soon go away. What
Iwould like to see permanently eradicated is the
new notion by some members of the University
community that if you cannot find a parking
spot, simply create a new one. I refer specifical-
ly to the practice of some University employees
of leaving cars parked perpendicularly behind
other parked cars in between the freshmen
dorms and the Lee House.

At first it was merely an irritant to move the
one car which exercised this habit (the keys,
after all, were left in the car, and a note was left
saying that if the car was blocking someone else,
then if the car’s owner were contacted, he/she
would move it). Now, regrettably, the practice
has spread, and the number of cars has
multiplied.

Please keep in mind how gross and unfair this
is. Should we, as students, simply create new
parking spaces outside the door of the coop, or
park our cars on the Colonnade? There is sheer
competition for the spots (free enterprise,
maybe) and it is every man for himself. It seems
that whenever students try to fight back and
park in an unusual spot, they receive tickets
from Murph or Lexington’s “‘finest’”’ (and a tow-
ing job to boot). Shouldn’t the same threat hang
over the heads of the people now parking in this

So, please, I implore you, MOVE YOUR CAR
— I don’t want to have to find you, and I don’t
want to have to pay for another dent in my car if
I get angry.

To The Editor:
This letter is in response to R.S. Keefe’s letter
in the Nov. 9 issue.
Fraternities are making an effort to improve
relationships with the community. It does not
‘help matters at all when someone slanders a
fraternity without first investigating the facts. I
have encountered broken glass in the streets of
Lexington also, but I did not accuse the nearest

residence of being responsible for the broken
glass.

One does expect the Director of the News Of-
fice to be fairer in his accusations.

Sincerely,

a __—
Sir:

I was rather intrigued by a letter to the editor
last week in which a certain R.S. Keefe, whoever
he might be, had a close encounter of the worst
kind (broken beer bottles—not more than two) in
the street in front of my present residence, the
Delt house.

If I dare suggest it—while freedom of speech
still exists in Lexington—Mr. Keefe should con-
sider a few tidbits before he hurls his next ac-
cusation toward the Delt house or any other
fraternity on campus.

First, beer bottles in front of the Delt house
Thursday should not imply that a Delt deposited
them there. Wednesday night (the only night
during the week a party can be held, no matter
how peaceful) we had a grain party. I doubt any
Delts were interested in bottled beer that night.

Second, I also doubt that any Delt would break
beer bottles on the side of the road between two
of our cars where a car parking or pulling out
would receive a flat tire.

May I also point out that many people not in
our fraternity were attending out rather tame
party. (Sorry, no broken bones, gatoring, Pagan
rituals, or noise violations.) Any one of the
visitors could have caused your inconvience in
front of our house.

As a final note, I do not, nor ever have, wanted
your sympathy for ours or any other Washington
and Lee fraternity.

All I have ever wanted was a fair chance for
our fraternity and the other fraternities on cam-
pus. I obviously cannot find that chance in your,
sir.

Respectfully,

acting. Sonia Braga in the title
role is absolutely beautiful. Her
sensitive, totally unpretentious
characterization of Dona Flor is
flawless. Jose Wilker, her
disreputable husband, is
perfectly suited for his cheap
hood role, and Mauro Men-
donca, the druggist, executes
an excellent job of portraying
the well-meaning, but
thoroughly boring second part-
ner. '

Musically, Chico Buarque has
done a fine job of scoring the
film. Every theme, including
the pompous oboe for the se-
cond husband is done with a
delightful flair.

Add up a fine director, ex-
cellent actors, and an_ in-

teresting score, finish it up with
an easy-going humorous touch,
and the result is one of the finest
films to come along in yars. If
Heaven Can Wait is a mixed-up

You see, Newton was the beneficiary of a bump of enlightenment.
Undoubtedly, he would have been amenable to other enlightening

The smooth and easy swallow. The fascinating; long-lasting head.
As thousands of others after him, it is only logical that he would
have said, ‘‘It's too good to gulp.’

Fencing Club beats
James Madison

Last Sunday the Washington
and Lee fencing club traveled to
James Madison University for a

defeated JMU’s team with an
overall score of 17 bouts to
James Madison’s 13. In the dif-
ferent weapon competitions the
foil squad won 10 bouts to

Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship is sponsoring a
CLOTHING DRIVE this Thurs-
day and Friday, Nov. 16 and 17.

All of the clothes which are
given will be donated to a local
organization, Total Action
Against Proverty (TAP).

They will distribute the dona-
tions to people in our communi-
ty who express a need for them.
We would greatly appreciate
any contribution, no matter how
old or worn out the clothes are.
You may bring your old clothes
either to the University Book
Store (Co-Op) or the lobby of
the Dining Hall.

JMU’s 6; and the epee squad
won 5 bouts with James
Madison winning only 4 bouts;
and the sabre squad lost 7 to 2.
This was a strong showing.

Fencing foil for W&L on Sun-
day were Clyde Harkrader and
Colt Puryear, both freshmen;
Willie Mackie and John
Stathakis, both sophomores;
and Fletcher Harkrader, a
junior. The epee squad con-
sisted of freshman Dave
Hepler, sophomore Bill Sherwin
and junior Paul Nathan. Dave
Hepler also fenced sabre for the
first time in competition with
the rest of the sabre squad:
juniors Dave Bryant, Dave
Barnes and Bill Hill. Freshman
Steve King did an excellent job
officiating the foil competition,
since he had sustained an in-
jury.

Dr. Worth, the team coach
and advisor sacrificed his Sun-
day to go with the team. His
coaching, moral support and
generosity were invaluable to
the team. We are looking for our
first scrimmage to be only one
of many victories in the upcom-
ing season.

race was run “very smoothly.”’
He added that ‘Coach Dick

without any problems.”’

The Trot is a 2.5 mile course
that is half of the cross-country
course including Telegraph

Cockpit
Attractions

(continued from page 5)
Wednesday, Nov. 29, the band
Trigger Happy will return to the
Cockpit. They last played in the
Cockpit on Oct. 7 to a very en-
thusiastic crowd, and sought
another date based on the
crowd’s reception! The
members of the band are Gary
Scarborough (guitar, vocals),
Gregg Lardieri (piano, organ),
Tim Lawrence (bass), Fred
Tepper (guitar, pedal steel),
and Rick Weisenmiller
(drums). Although some of
their material is original, most
of their songs are from Little
Feat, Marshall Tucker, the
Alman Brothers and J.J. Cale.
Their sound is remarkably
similar to all of the above
bands, and after a few minutes
of listening to them, you will be
able to see and hear that. There
will be a cover charge of $1 for
all W&L students, $1.50 for
everyone else. All of the pro-
ceeds at the door will pay the
band for this performance,
which should be excellent. They
will start at 8 and play until
closing.

Also in the Cockpit that week
will be Eddie Adcock and II
Generation. This professional
band has six albums printed,
and is another example of a
band who wanted a return date
because of the crowd’s recep-
tion at their first gig, last Sept.
13. They have just finished a
tour of the West Coast, which
was very successful. They play
a hybrid of country-rock, with
the emphasis on rock. Eddie
plays banjo and Telecastei and
sings along with his wife, Mar-
tha, who also plays guitar.
Johnny Castle plays an in-
imitable bass guitar, and they
are assisted on the drums by a
musician whose name _ is
unavailable at this time. This
will be Christmas Party Time in
the Cockpit, and Santa will be
selling mugs of foamy stuff to
all college women for 25. BE
there!

Phineas: Equal Rights

There seems to be a plethora
of new groups on campus
recently, so I consider it my
civic duty to give a quick com-
mentary on one of the most con-
troversial of them.

W.O.M.B.A.T. is the Women’s
Organization for the Mandatory
Battle Against Truth and it had
to hit campus sooner or later.
They are obviously proponents
of the E.R.A. believing that
men and women should be
equal in every way. But WOM-
BAT isn’t satisfied with the
E.R.A., and they would like to
carry the idea one miniscule
step further.

They are presently lobbying
for the following laws: 1) that
children be brought up by
strangers because mothers are
more concerned with ‘‘finding
themselves” than with the hap-
piness of the child, 2) that dur-
ing at least the last three hours
of labor in the child-bearing
process the father must be tied
up and whipped so that he will
feel as much pain as the mother
and care for the child that much

more because of the pain he
went through for it, 3) that men
must wear kilts and shave their
legs, and 4) that men must wear
jock straps at all times. (“If we
have to keep our supple appen-
dages confined so must they.’’)

The group does not have a
large following at W&L but
there are a number of law
students involved. After all,
they applauded when the
Supreme Court handed down a
decision that permitted a
woman reporter in the Yankee
locker room. So I can’t com-
prehend what all the hub-bub
was about when I decided to use
the ladies’ bathroom in Lewis
Hall. They called me obscene,
vile, and lecherous. I told them
that if separate but equal
schools weren’t good enough for
the blacks, then separate but
equal bathrooms weren’t good
enough for me. Besides, the
bathrooms aren’t even equal.
Theirs is pink and ours is blue,
and everyone knows that pink is
more aesthetically pleasing to
the eye.

 

Frisbee

Though Washington and Lee
University has over a dozen
organizations created for the
“throwers’’ on campus, there
exist none to satisfy the ‘‘skip-
pers” among us. Recent efforts
at alleviating this injustice have
met with some success, though,
as the University Athletic Com-
mittee has unofficially
recognized a campus Frisbee
club. The representatives to the
committee described the objec-
tive of the club: ‘‘to encourage
greater appreciation of the
Frisbee. This appreciation
‘ranges from the purest recrea-
tional enjoyment to highly ad-
vanced competition.”’

Frustrated “skippers,” your
‘time has come! Join us at our
first meeting this Tuesday,
‘Nov. 28, at 7:30 p.m. in Room
‘114 at the University Center.

The ball and the frisbee,
sport’s two major forms, evolv-
ed from a common ancestor —
the rock. Early rock athletes
were divided into two camps:
throwers and_ skippers.
Throwers like fat, hunky rocks,
something they could get a grip
on, and skippers like the
smooth, flat, skinny ones for
“‘pittying’”’ on the pond. But
there was something about rock
throwing that seemed to bring ©
out the aggressiveness of its
people. Before long, they were
throwing at each other. The
skippers, on the other hand,
were a more esthetic group.
