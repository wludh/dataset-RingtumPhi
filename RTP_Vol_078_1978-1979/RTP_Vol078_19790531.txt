Faculty Accepts
Council Policy

Univ.

by John Billmyre

In a statement passed Mon-
day, the faculty has placed the
future of fraternities in the
hands of their own members
and the Interfraternity Council.

Fraternities must comply
with a new policy next year that
was adopted by the University
Council on May 3.

The new policy limits ‘‘House
Parties” to weekends and
defines parties ‘‘as any function
funded by the treasury or billed
to members on a deferred
basis.”

Fraternities will still be
allowed to have two house-
sponsored weekday parties dur-
ing rush.

Prohibited under the new
policy are parties in Lexington
or at the women’s colleges.

Fraternity members are
allowed to have “chip-in” par-
ties where the party is not
house-sponsored on Wednesday
nights under the new policy.

Fraternities convicted more
than once for violating Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance will
receive escalated punishments
under the new University Coun-
cil policy.

According to a statement the
faculty released after its

meeting on Monday, the faculty
“expresses its faith in this in-
stitution’s students and in their
desire to cooperate,” but is ‘‘not
unwilling to legislate directly
upon any of these matters.”’

Other problems considered
“matters” by the faculty are
the conduct of students at spor-
ting events and women’s col-
leges, the ‘“‘sometimes abusive
and obscene language used in
public and at fraternity func-
tions,” and the exterior ap-
pearance of fraternity houses.

The University Council has
been requested to submit a
report on the i lementation of its
policy to the faculty by early
January.

To be included in the report is
a list of fraternity-related com-
plaints, their source,disposition
and nature.

Also to be presented to the
faculty some time next year are
the results of a Student Affairs
Committee investigation of
fraternities’ role in academic
life at Washington and Lee.

IFC President Syd Farrar
said he was pleased with the
decision because “we have
maintained the right to govern
ourselves.”’

Nader Speaks On

Corporate Power

by David Greer

Ralph Nader, addressing a‘
packed house at Washington
and Lee last Thursday, spoke on
a variety of subjects, focusing
on energy problems and the
dangers of excessive corporate
power.

Nader said that in order for
the market-place economy to
work properly, there must be a
degree of insecurity amoung
the corporations. The giant cor-
porations have become so
secure, he said, that they no
longer feel threatened by con-
sumer pressures.

The government reinforces
the power of the corporations,
he said, through subsidies, in-
flated government contracts,
tax loop-holes, and whole in-

dustry subsidies.
“You don’t go bankrupt
anymore, you go to

Washington,”’ Nader said.

Nader said that the American
public should redefine violence
to go beyond street crimes and
traditional concepts of violence
and include ‘compulsory con-
sumption of pollution’’ and “‘the
silent kind of violence that
sidesteps”’ the senses.

A ‘‘what doesn’t pinch,

doesn’t hurt” ideology keeps
the public from being aware
and concerned about this type
of violence until tragic events
occur, such as the asbestos
poisoning of some shipworkers.

Nader also spoke of how the
educational systems in this

ecutive Committee President
Beau Dudley, who attended the
meeting to discuss both the
fraternity system and a pro-
posal to build an on-campus
pavilion, ‘‘but like most pro-
blems, I would rather solve it
myself.”

Farrar further explained the
proposal’s intent: ‘The faculty
wants to cut down on the
number and intensity of par-
ties.”

He added, ‘‘Hopefully, the
parties will tail off after rush.”

agree, but a Phi Gamma Delta
representative did not. .

Law Admissions Drop
Decline Less Than National Slump

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law received a
total of 1,177 applications for 115
places in the first-year class
that will enroll in September,
the university said this week.

The number of applications
was down 9 percent from the
1978 figure of 1,287 — a smaller
decline, however, than the na-
tionwide drop in applications to
law schools. That national
decline is estimated at between
10 and 14 percent.

The number of applications to
W&L’s law school represented
10 for each place in the entering
class.

The students who have con-
firmed their plans to enroll in
next fall’s first-year law class
are the smartest the law school

has ever had, judged by their
undergraduate grade-point
averages, according to William
McC. Schildt, assistant law
dean.

The mean GPA of the 135
students who have confirmed
their acceptances to W&L is 3.38
on a 4.0 scale, Schildt said, up
from last year’s 3.27. The
averages for the two preceding
years were 3.27 and 3.28.

The average score on the
standardized Law School Ad-
mission Test (LSAT) dropped
eight points, from last year’s
649 to 641 among the students
who have confirmed their inten-
tion to enroll at W&L in the fall.

Last year’s 649 LSAT average
was an exception to the mean
scores in other recent years. In

1977 and 1976, for example, the
comparable score averages
were 639 and 641.

Although 135 students have
confirmed thcir current plans to
attend W&L’s law school, the
university expects thc number
who will actually enroll in
September to be about 115, the
“target’’ first-year class size.
Every year, a number of
students — which W&L expects
to be about 20 this year —
change their plans over the
summer and decide not to at-
tend law school at all or to go
elsewhere.

Contact

Scott Cardozo and Channing
Hall were appointed Contact
Co-chairmen for the coming
year.

Representatives from the Stu-
dent Body Executive Commit-
tee, the Interfraternity Council,
and Contact met Monday night
to receive applications.

Eight students applied for the
positions.

The Senior Class Party will be
held Tuesday in Red Square
from 4:30 to 8:30.

The party will feature kegs,

Admission will. be by class
pass. Alumni and parents and
friends of the seniors are
welcome.

UC Proposal Bans
Midweek Parties

At its meeting of May 3, the University Council adopted by a vote of 19-3 the
following interfraternity Council proposal, as amended by the Student Affairs
Committee, to become effective in September 1979.

“In response to the pending faculty motion, the Interfraternity Council and all of
the individual fraternities have taken a serious look at the concerns expressed in
the motion. It is the consensus of fraternity members and their officials that we
must improve in a number of areas and reaffirm the faith of all concerned that we
are capable of self-government. All fraternities are aware that the situation is in-
deed a serious one in the minds of the faculty. We believe strongly that the IFC
should remain the governing body of fraternities, and that Washington and Lee
would not be made a better place by the mandatory imposition of faculty
guidelines in anything short of an absolute emergency situtation.

The following proposals have been approved by the IFC. They are offered as a
strong indication of our willingness to deal effectively and fairly with the problems
as you have pointed them out to us.

(1) ‘House Parties”’ are defined by the IFC as any function funded by treasury
or billed to the members on a deferred basis. The term will include such a function
held either in Lexington or at one of the women’s colleges. The IFC will adopt a
rule prohibiting any such House Party on any weeknight (Sunday through Thurs-
day). Any violation of this provision will require an automatic investigation by the
Judicial Board, to enforce subsequent punishment. The penalty will increase for
any additional violation. A fraternity will be allowed to have two Wednesday
house-sponsored parties within the first three weeks of the fall semester coinciding
with Rush.

(2) All parties must conform to the local noise ordinance as enforced by the Lex-
ington Police. Any house receiving a summons which results in an ultimate finding
of guilty by a local court will result in an investigation and review by the Judicial
Board, at which time punishment will be decided. The penalty will increase for
each additional violation.

(3) The IFC Constitution strictly prohibits any hazing which constitutes any
physical or emotional hazard to a student or which interferes with his academic
performance. The IFC, as it does now, investigates any alleged incident in viola-
tion of this rule, and any violation will result in an investigation by the Judicial
Board. Weekday pledge activities will be restricted to one night a week and shall
not extend beyond 8:00 p.m. All other pledge activities will be restricted to the
weekends.

(4) The IFC fully understands the intent and tone of the faculty motion, as does
each fraternity. We list the following areas as requiring our attention and improve-
ment, and commit ourselves to good faith efforts in each of these areas:

(a) The public conduct of some members both locally and at our own sporting
events.

(b) The conduct of individuals and fraternities as a group while guests at the

women’s colleges.

(c) The exterior appearance of the fraternity houses and grounds which on oc-
casion is an eyesore to others.

(d) The shouting and sometimes abusive and obscene language used in public
and at fraternity functions.

By recommendation of the Student Affairs Committee and action of the Univer-
sity Council, any violation of the above regulations will result in an automatic and
minimal penalty of two weeks of social probation unless in the judgment of the IFC
Judicial Board and the Student Affairs Committee, there are extenuating cir-
cumstances presented upon appeal.

From The Faculty...

(Passed in meeting of May 28)

To The IFC, SAC, and the University Council:

The Faculty appreciates the constructive action toward more effective self-

oe of fraternities taken by the IFC and endorsed by SAC and the University
ouncil.

_ The Faculty concures with the IFC’s position that self-regulation by fraternities
is preferable to rules the faculty might impose. And it urges you to bear in mind the
following observations.

Fraternities and fraternity members are to govern themselves in accord with
the following catalogue statement:

Fundamental to all other aspirations of Washington and Lee University are two
basic purposes:

— The dedication of all its resources to the development of man’s capacity and
desire to learn, to understand, and to pass on to others the varied benefits of this in-
tellectual growth.

_ — The pursuit of its educational purpose in a climate of learning that stresses the
importance of the individual, his harmonious relationship with his fellow-man and
~ reponsibility to serve society through the productivity of his training and
talent.”

Fraternities undeniably add a dimension to student social life at W&L; that
dimension should complement the educational purposes of the University. Mid-
week party activities on fraternity premises conflict with, rather than comple-
ment, academic life. The faculty feels confident you will, in the months to come,
eliminate such conflicts.

All initiation and pledge activities classifiable as hazing violate the ‘‘importance
of the individual, his personal honor and integrity.” In recent years student reports
to faculty about hazing have increased in number and frequency; many of these
reports describe abhorrent actions degrading to the participants, actives as well
as pledges. You can, by open discussion and inquiry, bring your own forms of
pressure to bear upon those whose behavior disgraces the entire fraternal system.

Excessive noise, ear-splitting live or recorded music, obscene comments, and
lewd or destructive conduct, whether in Lexington or on neighboring campuses,
violate a “harmonious relationship’ with one’s fellow-man. Fraternities enjoy a
generous compromise in the matter of noise since fraternity neighbors generally
tolerate loud party music during weekend evening hours. Fraternities must,
however, respect their neighbors’ right to rest undisturbed in the privacy of their
homes during late night and early morning hours.

The Faculty also anticipates your re-analysis of both the present rushing system
and the entire question of fraternities’ interference with the freshman’s adjust-
ment to academic demands. In the months to come, faculty representatives on the
University Council and SAC will discuss these subjects with you.

The Faculty requests the University Council to submit before January 7, 1980, a
written report on the implementation of its policy of May 3, 1979, and of
disciplinary actions taken to enforce that policy. The Dean of Students should in-
clude in that report a list of fraternity-related complaints including their general
source, nature, and disposition. The University Council is also to share with the
Faculty all results of the SAC investigation of fraternities’ role in academic life
and any steps the Council takes pursuant to that report.

Reluctant but not unwilling to legislate directly upon any of these matters, the
Washington and Lee Faculty expresses its faith in this institution’s students and in
their desire to cooperate in achieving the exalted goals common to us all.

A sexuality survey conducted
at Mary Baldwin College and
Washington and Lee shows that
88 percent of the males and 68
percent of the females who
responded are not virgins.

The survey, conducted by
Steve Abraham and Kristin
Durway, students at Mary
Baldwin and W&L in _ the
Masculine/Feminine Role and
Relations course, was taken
this spring at the two schools.

Of those respondents who are
not virgins, most of them lost
their virginity at age 17. Of the
females, 26 percent were 17, 20
percent 18, and 13 percent 19
years old. Of the males, 18 per-
cent were 16, 26 percent 17, and
19 percent 18 years old.

Of the respondents who said
they were virgins, most said the
reason for not having sex was
religious or moral, with 39 per-
cent of the males and 33 percent
of the females giving this
response. Of the females, 27

percent feared the affect on
future marriage and 16 percent
of the males gave this reason.

Fear of pregnancy was the
reason cited by 22 percent of the
males and only 13 percent of the
females responding to why they
had not had sex.

Of the respondents, 82 percent
of the females and 88 percent of
the males have participated in
oral sex. In answerin~ *4e ques-
tion, ‘““Have you eve mastur-
bated.”” 77 percen of the
females and 88 percy..t of the
males said they have.

When asked if they had par
ticipated in sex with a member
of the same sex, 13 percent of
the males and 18 percent of the

female respondents said they
had.

Few of the respondents said
they had participated in group
sex; only four percent of the
females and eight percent of the
males replied affirmatively.
However, 33 percent of the
males said they would like to
try it while only five percent of
the females agreed.

Most of the respondents of
both sexes have had intercourse
with three or less people — 54
percent of the females and 36
percent of the males. Of the
female respondents, nine per-
cent have had sex with four to 10
people and four percent with
more than 10. Of the males, 30
percent have had sex with four
to 10 people and 26 percent with
more than 10.

Most of the female
respondents (87 percent) who
are not virgins use contracep-
tives. The pill is the most fre-
questly used at 38 percent; 23
percent each use rhythm or
other methods, not including
diaphragm, IUD, or creams or
jellies.

When asked about the fre-
quency of having intercourse,
36 percent of the females and 23
percent of the males said once a
week. Less than once a month
was the highest frequency for
the males, at 34 percent, and se-
cond highest for the females at
14 percent.

Of the male respondents, 65
percent said they have asked a
female if she is presently using
contraceptives when it is ob-
vious they are going to engage
in intercourse. Of those, 74 per-
cent said they used some type of
precaution if her answer was

no. Of those who never asked, 46
percent said they didn’t care if
any precaution was taken, 23
percent did not know how to
mention the subject, and 30 per-
cent considered it understood it
was their responsibility and
took the necessary precaution.

Of the female respondents, 40
percent who do not use con-
traceptives said they had asked
a male they were about to have
sex with if he was going to use a
contraceptive. Four percent
said they had not done this. Of
those who had and whose part-
ner had said he wasn’t going to
use a contraceptive, 89 percent
said they told him they would
not have intercourse. Those

who never asked offered no
response to questions about
their reasons for not asking.
Supposing they were preg-
nant, 39 percent of the
respondents said they would tell
the father and 46 percent said
they would have an abortion.

Supposing a girl they had had
sex with got pregnant, 42 per-
cent of the men would recom-
mend and offer to pay for an
abortion, 17 percent would want
her to have the baby, and six
percent would ask the girl to
marry them. One percent would
never want to see the girl again
and three percent would rather
she not tell them.

The respondents were asked

if they thought premaritial sex
for mere pleasure was as per-
missible as premaritial sex for
love. Of the females, 23 percent
said yes, nine percent usually,
27 percent not usually, and 41
percent answered no. Of the
males, 44 percent said yes, 18
percent usually, 23 percent not
usually, and 17 percent said no.

When asked if they ever had
guilt feelings after having sex,
nine percent of both groups said
they had. 35 percent of the
males and 32 percent of the
females said sometimes, and 50
percent of the males and 41 per-
cent of the females said they
had never had guilt feelings
after sex.

Mahan Awards Presented
To Student Writers

Three Washington and Lee
University students have been
named winners in the annual
George A. Mahan Awards com-
petition in creative writing,
sponsored by Washington and
Lee’s English department.

James R. Leva, an English
major from Morristown, N.J.,
won the junior prose award for
his play ‘“‘Dream Movie.”

An experimental work using a
combination of techniques —
for example, film and live ac-
tors in the same space — the
play was recently performed by
students in Washington and
Lee’s spring drama program.

The sophomore prose award
was presented to Robert S.
Piazza of Baltimore for his

story “‘A Brother of My Own,”
an impressive attempt to catch
an authentic fictional voice, ac-
cording to James Boatwright,
W&L English professor and a
Mahan Award judge.

The poetry award was
presented to Andrew F. Trotter,
a freshman from Roanoke.

The creative writing competi-
tion was established at

 

Washington and Lee by George
A. Mahan of Hannibal, Mo., an
alumnus who died in 1936. The
award consists of a $100
scholarship or $60 in cash.

A Physicist Poses Some Tough Questions
For The Layman About Three Mile Island

By H. Thomas Williams

Assistant professor of physics
.. . A multitude of technical
questions must now be address-
ed by technical people, of
course — by the people who
design, build and operate

nuclear reactors in particular.
These are basically questions
for science and for scientists —
but the ‘‘scientific method” not-
withstanding, they will be
answered in different ways by

tinent to examination of the
Three Mile Island questions is
much smaller yet.

In order to make intelligent
and appropriate policy deci-
sions, therefore, our lawmakers
will have to decide among paths
suggested by nuclear experts
who themselves are in con-
siderable conflict.

different authorities. Public-
policy decisions will generally
be made by non-scientists, and
therein lies a great problem
both for the decision-makers
and for the rest of us.

The scientists who study the
problems must act in an ad-
visory role to the decision-
makers in the power-generation
industry and at various levels of
government. Ultimately, of
course, the major decisions will
be made by the Congress.

Typically, however, a Con-
gressman is a lawyer. Most
Congressmen have
backgrounds in the liberal arts.

The sum of the scientific
training among members of
Congress is miniscule — and

legislators is this: Not all scien-
tists are honest and not all
scientists are competent. How
can one distinguish between
good science and bad? How
does one decide among conflic-
ting scientific viewpoints? The
simple fact that there can be
more than one valid scientific
viewpoint on a single issue may
come as a surprise to laymen; it
is nevertheless true.

In presenting information
about the Three Mile Island
crisis to the public, the news
media sometimes represented
the confusion of the initial days
accurately. In other instances,
however, the media aggravated
or even created the confusion.

were commonly printed as
“Nuclear Plant Potentially Ex-
plosive.”” In point ‘of narrow
technical fact, the headline was
accurate. But to much of the lay
public, conditioned by nuclear-
holocaust fiction or by the
scenarios postulated by those
who are ideologically opposed
to nuclear power and weaponry
policies, the juxtaposition of the
two words ‘‘nuclear’’ and “‘ex-
plosive’”’ conjured up visions of
mushroom clouds, widespread
death, and general devastation.

The fact is that the Three Mile
Island reactor was never in
danger of becoming a nuclear
bomb.

The feared explosion would
have been a chemical one. The
radiation leakage accompany-
ing such a chemical explosion
could indeed have _ been
disastrous — but there would
not have occurred the release of
awesome energy and power of a
true nuclear blast.

So the headline — even

follow.”

The news media must search
for answers to several questions
about their own role in the way
the Three Mile Island incident
was represented to the public.
In such matters — when the
subject matter is poorly
understood both by reporters
and by their readers or listeners
— how can the rights of the
media to report and the public
to know be satisfied? Who,
among those who understand
the scientific complexities and
uncertainties of such a subject,
are the media’s ‘usually
reliable sources’’?

**e#*

The American people must,
as best they can, develop an
understanding of the problems
so conspicuously posed by the
Three Mile Island accident —
and develop an understanding
of the multiplicity of possible
solutions. Beyond the dilemma
of conflicting ‘‘expert”’ opinion,
the public is faced with the pro-

scientific “‘fact,’’ of science’s
limitations. Taking a single
science course in school does
not provide this insight; even a
college degree in a science does
not often lead to this kind of ap-
preciation of science as a whole.

Most members of 20th-
century American society who
are well educated have been
taught an appreciation of the
arts. The analagous 18th-
century appreciation of science
— “natural philosophy’’ — has
all but disappeared, even as it
has changed from the status of
intellectual luxury to near-
requirement for ultimate sur-
vival.

This article is excerpted from
the new issue of the Washington
and Lee University Alumni
Magazine.

Tom Williams writes that
although he is ‘‘a physicist by

belm of receiving nearly all its
information about the con-
troversy through only-partially-
understanding medea. Sorting
it all out is far from easy.

We in the public must look for
intelligent answers to the same
questions our legislators face.
What are the limitations of
science? To what extent are the
questions raised as a result of
Three Mile Island scientific,
and to what extent are they
ethical and moral? How shall
we choose to educate our youth
to answer even more deman-
ding and troublesome questions
to come?

Educators need to examine
the system of teaching, at all
levels, from the point of view of
the degree of understanding
and appreciation of science
they provide the non-scientific
majority. We cannot hope to
make nuclear experts of
everyone so as to be able to han-
dle future Three Mile Islands
wisely — just as the general
public cannot, for example,
aspire to learn enough about
biochemistry to be able con-
fidently to make decisions in the
field of genetic engineering.

But it is not too much to ex-,
pect that we should produce
educated citizens, regardless of
field of academic emphasis,
who possess a comprehension of
what science is, of how it is car-
ried out, of what constitutes

Bests And Worsts Of The Cinema Year

by Dick Barron

For our last movie column of
the year, so it seems ap-
propriate that we look back at
the films of the 1978-79 school
year.

This was not a year for
musicals. Of those ambitious ef-
forts which were released, even
the best lacked the ‘“‘spunk’’
which saves a great film from
mediocrity. Grease, the best of
the lot, was lacking in drive, but
Travolta and Newton-John
made a pretty pair. The Wiz,
with Diana Ross, was big and
splashy, but it failed to warm
the heart with its big city cold-
ness. But we did have fun with
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band. It was perhaps the
worst movie of the year and
that made it fun. The serious
parts were hysterical, and the
attempts at humor were
ludicrous (we weren’t laughing
with it, we were laughing at it).
Never have so many big artists
been assembled for such a
magnificent waste of time and
money.

Another big production,
Superman belongs in a class by
itself. It’s difficult to avoid con-
tradictions when discussing this
film. It was too long, the script
was sappy, and much of the act-
ing was limp, yet the special ef-
fects were’ great, the
cinematography was crisp, and
Chris Reeve made a fine Super-
man. And besides, the man of
steel made a lot of gold for the
movie producers.

Television producers made a
valiant stab at putting their dry
fare into the theaters with the
low-life version of Buck Rogers
in the Twenty-fifth Century.

This along with Battlestar
Galactica’s big-screen re-
packaging proved you can take
‘em off T.V., but you can’t make
em any better in a theater.

In comedy, Neil Simon, usual-
ly a respectable writer, left a lot
of us clamoring to check out of
the California Suite. Mean-
while, comedy newcomer Clint
Eastwood became a good ole
boy in the hit Every Which Way
But Loose — a poor man’s
Smokey and the Bandit.

No one who regularly attends

grade ‘‘B’’ movies could forget
that gang-land classic The War-
riors. For sheer violence, well-
done at that, this movie has it
all. Many audience members
were so inspired by The War-
riors that they joined their
friends in re-enacting certain
scenes. The film was pulled
from several metropolitan
theaters due to this audience af-
fection for holding ‘‘rumbles”’
(or gang-warfare). Washington
and Lee Gentlemen found the
film stimulating as well, but

serious film offerings as well.
The Deer Hunter gave us a
thrilling, albeit lengthy account
of the lives of three Penn-
sylvania steel workers during
the Vietnam war days. With
strong violence and tough per-
formances, this was undoubted-
ly the most devastating film of
the year.

The China Syndrome, starr-
ing Jane Fonda (currently play-
ing in Lexington) is a mighty
thriller in its own right. The
“No Nukes’”’ crowd should get a
kick out of the one-sided view of
power companies, and
everybody should be thoroughly
entertained by this finely
crafted film. (By the way, who
cares about Jane Fonda's
politics? She could advocate the
execution of all children under
age two and she’d still be one of
the most beautiful and talented
actresses on the screen today. )

. . . Which brings us to the
latest favorite, Woody Allen’s
Manhattan, the film achieve-
ment of the year. How can he
top this one?; it’s definitely his
best — too bad there’s only one
director capable of Allen’s
genius.

This year was loaded with
film garbage, but there were
just enough good ones to make a
trip to the theater worthwhile.
Your favorites may not have
been mine, but we all agreed at
various times. One thing is cer-
tain, we have an interesting
summer to look forward to —
Alien and Apocalypse Now
seem to be the best bets. So go

Happy Tunes: New Wave Is Not Washed Up

by Mark Kinniburgh

Despite the many Anti-Disco
T-shirts that you might see on
the street, the disco
phenomenon has blossomed in-
to a huge industry, especially in
the radio world. A_ recent
meeting of 17 disco-oriented
radio stations belonging to the
Burkhartrams group in Atlanta
featured a guest speaker, Dr.
John Parikhal, a social scien-
tist, who spoke on _ the
sociological aspects of disco
versus rock music. In sum-
mary, Parikhal stated that rock
music appeals to young men
who are afraid of sex. Women,
he contended, can’t relate to
rock music, as they prefer a
smoother sex rhythm of disco.
Parikhal also contended that
the violent rhythm of rock ap-
peals to those having ‘‘teenage
sex frustrations,” and ‘“‘a fear
of being sexually inadequate.”

One can understand how im-
portant it is for the disco pro-
moters to have pride in their
product, even though this at-
tempt was at the expense of the
rock world. What is entirely ob-
vious is the immaturity of disco
as a force in music, a relative
newcomer when compared to
R&B and Rock ‘n’ Roll. The
rock world has moved so quick-
ly in the last ten years that only
now am I finding albums that

are excellent and contem-
porary, although produced, say,
in 1969. There is such a wealth
of creativity on which to draw,
such as the Kinks, the Who,
Beatles, the Stones, the Jeffer-
son Airplane, the Bvrds,
CSN&Y, Dereck am _ the
Dominoes to mention a few, and
this solid base of talent has led
the way for the New Wave of To-
day.

While many esoteric writers
and business people will pro-
claim that rock is dead, and
especially “new wave’’ rock is
dead, two vital forces have sur-
faced and become recognized in

their own right as artists. Talk-
ing Heads, a new wave quartet
spawned by a talent search at
N.Y.C.’s CBGB, have _ two
albums released on Sire
Records, the latest of which re-
mains on the Billboard Hot 100
Album chart 40 weeks after its
summer release.

Talking Heads began as an
artistic trio, and upon finding
themselves bored with the art-
rock scene, decided to turn to
pop music. What happened
then, is quite noticeable from
the two albumsTalking Heads
77 and More Songs About
Buildings and Food. “I can’t

Dystrophy Dance Marathon
grossed $17,052 last weekend,
according to chairman Jay
Blumberg.

Blumberg, who had set the
original goal at $5,000, said that
the results ‘‘were beyond my
wildest expectations.”

Sophomore Dean Kalamaras
raised the most money in
pledges, bringing in $3,020. In
doing so, he won a trip to

to MD with the stipulation that
the trip be given to a child

Over 1,100 students, faculty,

saw 150,000 volumns moved in
just two and one half hours.

Maurice Leach, head of the
University’s library, called the
book moving operation
‘‘super,’’ which he defined as
“extraordinaily great’ and
“beyond all expectations.”

Originally, the Library Move
Committee had estimated that
the move would require 1,000.

When asked to assess the
sports program at W&L, Bill
McHenry, athletic director at
W&L, said “We had a good year
this year, though not as good as
last year, and we are hoping for
improvement in the future.”’

McHenry further stated that
the primary goal of the sports
program at W&L is to field
teams that are competive in all
sports in Division III with
lacrosse being competitive in
Division I.

In assessing how the sports
program in general did this
year, McHenry pointed to a
comparison of records of this
year’s teams to last year’s
teams. But making a com-
parison, we must take into ac-
count several aspects which
help to explain the success or
failure of an athletic program.

The factors which contribute
to a team’s final record include
a loss of seniors to graduation,
the competitiveness of the
schedule and injuries to key
players. Therefore, without a
complete analysis of these fac-
tors it is difficult to derive a

 

 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  

 

  

The Outlook For
W&L Sports In 80

complete conclusion when com- _

paring the records of teams
from year to year.

In football, the team’s record
in 1977 was 3-8; in 1978 it was
2-8. The primary explanations
for this, McHenry said, were
the loss of talented seniors, in-
juries and the transition period
of the team to adjust to the foot-
ball philosophies of Head Coach
Gary Fallon. The team was
young and it took time for the
team and Fallon to become
used to one another.

In swimming, the team did
not enjoy as good a year as the
previous year. Last year the
swimmers finished 10-1 and this
year they ended the season at
2-8’ due in part to the loss of a
number of All-Americans. W&L
has (recently) built one of the
best swimming programs in
Division III. But the man who
has been the main catalyst

RING-TUM PHI

behind W&L swimming, Coach
Bill Stearns, has resigned his
post in order to enter private
business.

Named to succeed Stearns as
head of the swimming program
is the former Head Coach of
Clairmont-Mudd College in
California, Page Remillard.
The new coach brings with him
some impressive credentials in-
cluding the fact that annually
his teams have been one of the
strongest in Division III. Fur-
thermore, his water polo teams
were one of the best on the west
coast in Division III.

In the other sports, the teams
this year finished with records
similar to those of last year’s
teams. However, one of the
most interesting aspects of
these other programs was the
lacrosse team. Last year’s
team finished the regular
season with a 9-4 record and
received a bid to the NCAA na-
tional championships. This
year’s team finished the
regular season with an identical
record of 9-4 yet did not receive
an NCAA bid.

Looking ahead to next year,
Head soccer Coach Rolf Piri-
nian and Head Football Coach
Gary Fallon had some _in-
teresting points about their
teams which will kick off W&L
athletics next year. (The
schedules of these teams were
printed in last week’s Phi).

Coach Pirinian said that his
team will be young but should
be competitive. He said the
schedule is realistic and the en-
thusiasm within the program
has been good. He is looking for
players on the ‘‘B” team this
year to be promoted to the Var-
sity next year and contribute to
the soccer program.

In addition, Pirinian said the
players had successful indoor
and spring soccer programs
during the offseason which
should show results this fall.
Thus, barring injuries, the
outlook for the team seems to be

Wiles And Leunig Share

Brown Memorial Award
At Sports Ceremony

Richard B. Wiles (Danville,
Va.) and David E. Leunig
(Albany, N.Y.) were named co-
recipients of the Preston R.
Brown Memorial Award at the
season ending “All Sports
Barbeque and Award
Ceremony”’ held on May 22nd at
the Wilson Athletic Field.
Presented annually since 1950,
the Preston R. Brown Award is
given to W&L’s Most Valuable
Senior Athlete for overall per-
formance and athletic profi-
ciency during his college
career. It is voted on by
members of the athletic depart-
ment staff, and is considered
the highest honor a Washington
and Lee athlete may receive.

Wiles has been a four-year
letter winner in two sports, foot-
ball and baseball. During his
football career he has been
selected first team All-ODAC as
a wide receiver in 1978, while
achieving second team honors
in 1977. This past year Wiles
was selected as a second team
Academic All-American and is
the recipient of a NCAA Post-
Graduate Scholarship. In
baseball he has served as co-
captain the last two years, and
this year received the Coaches
Baseball trophy which is given
in recognition of unselfish
dedication and contribution to
the baseball program. He also
was named W&L’s Outstanding
Freshman Athlete in 1976.

Leunig is also a four-year let-
terman in two sports, namely
basketball and golf. In basket-
ball he ranks tenth on
Washington and Lee’s all time
career points list with 1005
points. This past season he
received the W&L Basketball
award for his contributions to
the program. In 1978 Leunig
received the Coaches and Cap-
tains award and was named se-
cond team all-ODAC.

Leunig’s golf career is
highlighted by being named
ODAC Golfer of the Year in 1977
and 1979 while being named all-
conference three times. This
past year he received the Felix
Smart MVP award and served
as the team’s co-captain.

Pressler Is

Frosh MVP

 

Mike Pressler (Wilson, Ct.)
was named the winner of the
Outstanding Freshman Athlete
Award. That award was
established in 1960 to honor the
frosh athlete who showed the
most athletic ability through his
participation in one or more
sports. Pressler, a graduate of
Wilton High School, played mid-
dle guard in football and was an
attackman on W&L’s nationally
ranked lacrosse team.

The thirteen W&L_inter-
collegiate sports teams combin-
ed for ninety-three victories and
ninety-seven defeats this year.
The 1977-78 varsity teams set a
school record with one hundred
eight victories. With an
undergraduate enrollment of
1397, 342 athletes or 24.5% of the
total student body competed in
intercollegiate contests in
1978-79.

6 Of 13 Teams
End Up On Top

 

Six of the thirteen teams com.
pleted their seasons with win-
ning records — water polo 11-9
in the fall; basketball 17-10,
wrestling 6-5 in the winter; and
golf 14-2, lacrosse 9-4 and track
and field 7-2 in the spring.

Two W&L teams won cham-

- pionships in the Old Dominion

Athletic Conference, both suc-
cessfully defending their 1977-78
titles Wrestling and _ tennis.
Four W&L athletes were named
ODAC Players of the Year in
their respective sports — Carl
Folcik in football, Ed Rodgers
for the second consecutive year
in wrestling, Dave Leunig for
the second time in the last three
years in golf, and Stewart

oe a

Jackson in tennis.

Washington and Lee’s Gary
Franke was named Coach of the
Year in two sports — wrestling
and tennis. This is the first time
that a conference coach has
won the award in two sports.

Three W&L teams achieved
national rankings led by the ten-
nis Generals who finished in a
tie for fourth this spring. The
golf team finished eleventh in
the NCAA Division III national
tournament. The _ lacrosse
Generals completed the year
ranked twelfth nationally by the
USILA in the University Divi-
sion, after being ranked as high
as eighth at one point in the
season.

Five W&L athletes received
All-American honors in 1978-79,
with three of them being first
team choices. The swimmers
led the way with two All-
Americans, Chip Hoke and
Drew Pillsbury. Stewart
Jackson achieved All-American
honors in tennis by finishing
among the top eight singles
players in the national cham-
pionships. Gerry Barousse was
named All-American in golf and
Carl Folcik received honorable
mention recognition in football.

Each sport’s most valuable
performer was announced at
the ceremony as well, and they
are as follows: baseball — Thad
Ellis; basketball — Carby Hoy;
cross-country — Richard Bird;
football — Stewart Atkinson (of-
fensive) and Carl Folcik (defen-
sive); golf — Dave Leunig and
Gerry Barousse; lacrosse —
Bob Clements; soccer — Jack

that they will be energetic, and
a group that cannot be taken
lightly.

Coach Fallon stated that he
expects his team to be an im-
proved team, but young as well.
He pointed to the loss of a
number of talented seniors and
the fact that only eight seniors
will play next year. Thus, the

team will be dominated by-

sophomores and incoming

freshmen.

In addition, the schedule is
composed entirely of Division
III teams and should allow the
team to be competitive in all

games. Also, the transition
period that hindered the team
last year is over and therefore

the team will not have to start
next year learning a new
coach’s football philosophy.

Finally, Fallon pointed to the
fact that the players’ attitude
toward the program is greatly
improved over last year’s. This
can be seen in the tremendous

success of the offseason weight
program.
Hence, the football team can

also point with confidence to a
coming season in which

repeated victories do not seem
a remote possibility.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Farewell

I suppose it is part of Lexington’s charm — that
sense of time standing still which allows our four
years here at W&L to. pass almost before we know it.
But in the past week, a sense that the end has come
for the Class of 1979 is everywhere: the exams are ap-
proaching, no one seems to cash student checks
anymore, Mr. & Mrs. Duck are urging everyone to
visit them one last time before they close next
Wednesday, and so on. You can find seniors
everywhere, standing in silent thought before the Col-
onnade, Lee’s statue, even Goshen Pass.

Our years here may have passed rapidly, but they
were not without memorable achievements. Forgive
me for a most natural bias, but it is my feeling that
the Class of 1979 has been one of the most spirited, ac-
complished groups to be seen on the campus. We were
on hand for every one of those dynamite blasts which
formed the new library, yet the seniors took the lead
in organizing the now-legendary ‘“‘Great Move’’ in
January. Our Mock Convention was done and gone in
1976; still, many seniors have worked long hours since
then, for an event in 1980 they will probably never see.
Members of the Class of 1979 founded the Student
Recruitment Committee, today a vital admissions
force. From our ranks have come two Fulbright
Scholars, not to mention Luce, Truman, and Rotary
— and it seems that our valedictorian will be one of a
small handful ever to graduate with a perfect 4-point
average. The seniors on the 1978-79 Executive Com-
mittee have set a tone of achievement and fairness
that will be hard to equal in any year. And finally,
even this rag you hold at the moment has been
managed by the Class of 1979 for the two years which
saw it grow — hopefully — into a college newspaper of
which we may all be proud.

With this issue, your editor thankfully completes
117 editions of the Ring-tum Phi. It is my hope that
some of the issues were as memorable for you as they
were for us — reflecting most of the victories and
upsets of your time here. And, to those of you who will
be back next year, one request — never hesitate to
give of your time and talents, to the Phi or any other
student organization. With the proper amount of ef-
fort, the Class of 1980 will soon be able to boast an
even better record than ours. And oddly enough, class
spirit notwithstanding, I am sure that this year’s
seniors wouldn’t want it any other way.

Student condemns lack of grade inflation at W&L

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

As a graduating senior, I would like to
recommend a change in W&L’s grading
system. During the last decade or two, most
academic institutions have experienced a
significant amount of “grade inflation.”
Washington and Lee, however, has managed
to keep its typical grade point average well
within the boundaries of the ‘‘gentleman’s C.”’
Although this situation, the indefatigable mis-
sion of our faculty, might be an “effective”
way for them to maintain W&L’s adademic
standards, it places W&L grads at a substan-
tial disadvantage when applying for either a
job or to grad school.

In my case, as well as that of many others,
the lower of two possible grades has been
received a substantially greater number of
times than the higher grade than seems
statistically possible. Although I do not
believe that students should be given grades
they do not earn, I also do not think that the
substantial difference between an 89 and an 80
should receive the same grade point value —
a 3.0. Obviously, the proximity of the 89 to an
A, and the 80 to a C proves that they are not
equal as W&L’s current grading system

Without a doubt, W&L’s grade evaluation
procedure is very inequitable. In my opinion,
and that of many colleges, the implementa-
tion of a plus/minus grading system would
not only remove a great deal of unfairness, by
giving an 89 a 3.5 gradepoint for example, but
would also be an incentive for students to do
more than the bare minimum of work
necessary to break the lower grade category
barriers. In addition, I believe that this
system would be beneficial to students whose
cumulative averages do not accurately por-
tray the quality of their work.

However, even if this improved system is
implemented, the fact remains that the result
of the grading philosophies of many W&L pro-
fessors is still a severe handicap to graduates.
As I mentioned earlier, I do not advocate pro-
fessors assigning students undeserved
grades, yet I also believe, strongly, that pro-
fessors need to be more realistic in evaluating
students’ work. Since students from other col-
leges, our co etitors in applying to graduate
schools, receive substantial breaks in grades,
I believe that the least amount of considera-
tion due W&L students is a break toward the
higher grade in borderline cases.

Faculty Promotions

Announced

Promotions in rank have been
announced for eight members
of the undergraduate faculty at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

Current associate professors
who will become full professors
Sept. 1 are James J. Donaghy of
the physics department, John
K. Jennings of the Department
of Journalism and Communica-
tions, and J. Ramsey Martin of
the philosophy department.

Promoted from assistant to
associate professor will be John
R. Handelman of the Depart-
ment of Politics, John M.
McDaniel of the Department of
Sociology and Anthropology,
Pamela Hemenway Simpson of
the art department, and H.
Thomas Williams of the physics
department.

Isabel Mecllvain, W&L’s
sculptor-in-residence, will be
promoted from instructor in art
to assistant professor.

The promotions in rank were
approved Saturday by
Washington and Lee’s board of
trustees at its regular spring
meeting on the campus.

Donaghy, who received his
Ph.D. from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
has taught at W&L since 1967.
He was an assistant physics
professor at Virginia Military
Institute in 1965-66.

Jennings received his B.A.
degree from W&L and his Ph.D.
from Stanford. He taught at

country focus on the corpora-
tion’s concerns rather than the
consumers. He said that
employment opportunities
determine curriculums at most
schools and that concepts,
rather than current concerns,
get the most attention.

“Once we get into the produc-
tion side of the economy after
graduation, we look at issues
from the side of production, not
consumption,’’ Nader said.

Nader said that presently
power is less succeptible to
displacement and is too secure.
Power should be insecure to be
more responsible.

“If power thinks it can loose
its power, it becomes more
receptive” to consumer needs,
Nader said.

Employment in large cor-
porations ‘‘biforcates the
human personality,” Nader
warned. People should combine
work and value sytems and con-
science at their jobs, and not
leave their consciences at
home.

Nader spoke extensively
about the dangers of nuclear
energy and offered solar energy
as the safest and most feasible
alternative.

“The plan is to keep us hook-
ed on a source of energy, that is
monopolistically and
oligopolistically controlled.
This disqualifies solar energy,”’
he said. When one form of
limited supply energy runs out,
another will be substituted.

Nader said, ‘“The waste is the
first focus of concern about our

Washington and Lee from 1960
until 1969, when he joined the
journalism faculty at the
University of Texas. He return-
ed to Washington and Lee in
1973. His field of teaching
specialty is electronic jour-
nalism.

Martin is a Ph.D. graduate of
Virginia who joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1968. He was assistant dean of
admissions at the University of
Virginia from 1962 until 1965
and taught philosophy at Tran-
sylvania College, Lexington,
Ky., in 1967-68.

Handelman, a specialist in
Asian studies, has taught
politics at W&L since 1973. He
earned his Ph.D. degree at
Syracuse University and has
undertaken postdoctoral
research work at Virginia.

McDaniel, a B.A. graduate of
Washington and Lee, received
his Ph.D. from the University of
Pennsylvania, the year he join-
ed the W&L faculty. His field of
specialty is archaeology, and he
has been the director of
Washington and Lee’s ar-
chaeological excavation at the
ruins of Liberty Hall, W&L’s
predecessor campus, since the
inception of the project in 1974.
He has had numerous articles
published on that ‘dig’ and is

energy problem.’ He believes
that one major catastrophy will
end the use of all nuclear
energy.

The nukes are subject to
disasterous hijackings, the only
industry given limited liability
by the government and are
uninsurable. :

“Tf it’s not safe enough for the
insurance companies, maybe
it’s not safe enough for people,”’
Nader said.

Nukes are the only form of in-
dustry linked to nuclear
weaponary and the only one
whose wastes are deadly for a
quarter of a million years,
Nader said.

“Future generations may
look at us as the most foolish
generation in history” for con-
sidering nukes, Nader added.

“The faster we put the
nuclear mistake behind us, the
faster we put the solar promise
ahead of us, the faster we will
have a safer planet.”’

Nader concluded his two hour
talk with an extensive question

and answer period which con-
tinued at a reception which
lasted until after midnight.

In response to a question
about the honor system at
Washington and Lee, Nader
pointed out that sanctions are
not applied in the real world to
any degree like they are here
with honor violations. For ex-
ample, nobody has been expell-
ed from the nuclear energy in-
dustry for unacceptible prac-
tices.

Speaking on deregulation of
the oil industry, Nader said that
there is no marketplace com-
petition in the oil business, and
therefore regulation should put
a ceiling on oil prices or else the
prices will go up as high as
OPEC wants them to.

Nader left several books at
the library here and suggested
ways students could get involv-
ed in consumer eduaction and
consumer action.

“Community intelligence is
needed as well as individual in-
telligence,” he said.

also surfaced in 1975 out of the
same ambience as the Talking
Heads, the Ramones. First peg-
ged as a punk-rock group, and
therefore a fad, the Ramones
have fought the misnomer
through 5 albums to date. Con-
stantly misquoted and misinter-
preted, the Ramones insist they
are no more “‘punk”’ than the
early Beatles or Elvis Presley.
“The early Beatles were really
great when they wore leather
jackets and were into hard,
solid rock ‘n’ roll,” says guitar
player Johnny Ramone. The
Ramones were first influenced
in their suburban Forest Hills
homes and began playing as a
band in their high school years.
Although they were discourag-
ed from the beginning by
friends and critics, they kept on
and do the same today. ‘Bad
reviews hurt, but they don’t
have to like us . . . what’s really
bad is when a reviewer not only
knocks your work but throws in
personal insults’’ says another
Ramone brother.

Included in the first Ramones
album is a sampling of rapid
fire 4/4 songs which display a
great deal of intensity and
simplicity which had been lost
to pop music since the Presley
days. One such rocker ‘‘Beat on
the Brat” with lyrics to the
same effect; (‘‘Beat on the Brat
with a baseball bat,’’) is an ex-
ample of the mindless power in
rock and roll similiar to ‘‘Kan-
sas City” or ‘Long Tall Sally”
of the Beatles and Elvis. The
Ramones display a great deal of
sheer power on stage or ablum,
and they are impossible to con-
fuse with any other musicians
today.

Both Talking Heads and the
Ramones share my award for
saving rock ‘n’ roll because
they have succeeded in taking
the five basic components of
rock, a singer, a song, guitar,
bass and drums, and coming up
with a fresh new sound that will
last until the eighties while

other sounds will fade. Although
on opposite ends of the artistic
scale, Talking Heads being
more interested in the total pro-
duct of lyric and music and the
Ramones giving attention to
power and delivery, there is a
vital core to the two which will
foster growth in music to the
same extent that the Beatles in-
fluenced fledgling bands of the
early seventies.
