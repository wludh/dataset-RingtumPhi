NUMBER3

E.C. Allocates *75,000 in Student Funds

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
distributed $75,000 to various
student committees at a five
hour budget session Tuesday
night.

The money is derived from
the $45 student tax each
Washington and Lee student
pays for the purpose of funding
recognized student groups and
organizations that provide ser-
vices for the student body.

The Student Activities Board
(SAB), which provides enter-
tainment on campus, received
the largest proportion, $30,910-
an increase of $1,560 over the
amount they were allotted last
year.

Capturing the second largest
amount of the student tax was
the Student Bar Association
(SBA), which represents W&L’s
law students and their varied
activities. The SBA was
allocated $13,358--an increase of
$3,298 over last year.

The organization realizing the
most dramatic increase in fun-
ding over last year was Ariel,
the student literary magazine,
which received $2,100 Tuesday
night as opposed to the $950
granted the previous year.

E.C, accounts

Of primary concern to the
E.C. was raising the level of the
Student Body Reserve Fund
above the $1,990 figure it reach-
ed after paying for the SAB’s
summer deficit. The student
body constitution sets a limit of
$2,500 as the minimum for that
account, which is set aside for
“emergencies.”

‘The Reserve Fund should be
at least $6,000,”’ E.C. president
Beau Dudley said in a
preliminary budget hearing.
The E.C. had $8,000 more in
funds this year because of a $5
increase in the student tax,
primarily to augment the
Reserve Fund.

Following Dudley’s line of
thinking, the committee deter-
mined that $4,100 be added to
the Reserve Fund account to
bring the total up to $6,090.

The E.C.’s own Operating
Budget was slated to be
$2,033.24. That figure was
reduced by the committee by
eliminating three of the four

. telephones that had been in the

four E.C. offices. The savings
realized from this cut allowed
the E.C. to reduce its Operating
Budget to $1,900.

group that knows they will want
money this year and did not
submit a budget to this commit-
tee for consideration tonight,”’
Dudley said

“It seems to me that we
should cut substantially from
the E.C. Funding account and
tell these groups that the money

. will not be available this year,”’

the student body president con-
tinued.

Student Files Complaint
Against Police Officer

by David Greer

Washington and Lee senior
Bill Tucker has filed a com-
plaint against Lexington Chief
of Police James A. Kirby and
Officer Jack Purvis. The com-
plaint stems from the conduct
of Purvis and Kirby following
Purvis’ arrest of Tucker for
driving under the influence of
alcohol and speeding on the
morning of Aug. 31.

In his letter to Kirby, Tucker
states, ‘“‘The source of my com-
plaint centers on _ two
things...the actions and at-
titudes of _ Officer Purvis
and...the timing of my being
charged with speeding and
Dui”

Tucker adds that he is “not

looking for anything to come of
this,” but is filing ‘‘to enable
Police Chief Kirby’s office to in-
vestigate the matter to its
satisfaction.”

On the morning of Aug. 31,
Tucker was returning from a
poker game around 2:45 a.m.
He parked beside Graham-Lee
dorm. Purvis had followed him
to the parking lot and claimed,
according to Tucker, that he
had been speeding and that his
car “left the ground at Main
Street.”’

Purvis said that he suspected
Tucker was intoxicated when
Tucker fumbled while remov-
ing his driver’s license from his

wallet. Tucker claims that the

plastic on his license is torn and
therefore he had _ difficulty
removing it.

Purvis made Tucker take a
sobriety test which Tucker felt
he passed to Purvis’ satisfac-
tion. However, Purvis said that
Tucker could hardly pass it.
Purvis intended to let Tucker
off without a ticket and lectured
him about safe driving.

Before Purvis left, Tucker
asked him, “Officer Purvis,
why do you stop me so much
and particularly why do you

, Stop Texans?’ According to

Tucker, Purvis’ “temperament
altered noticeably and he
charged me with speeding at 41
miles an hour” in a 25 mph
zone. Tucker claims that his
speed was not visible on the
radar screen, but Purvis
testified in court that he showed
the radar to Tucker and said in
an interview that he always
does this.

Tucker said he wanted
answers to a few questions
before he signed the ticket, but
Purvis, instead of giving
answers, arrested Tucker and
took him to the police station
(without reading him his
rights) Tucker kept asking

The committee set the E.C.
Funding account at $2,132, a
reduction of $1,468 from last
year, because they do not an-
ticipate any requests during the
year from established groups
on campus that did not submit a
budget for approval Tuesday.

Other student committee
budgets had to be cut to acheive
the $75,000 figure the E.C. was
given to work with (which was
based on a total number of
17,012 students attending W&L).

SAB budget slashed

The SAB’s original request
was for $35,732. This figure was
quickly reduced by _ co-
chairman Hank Hall to $34,310
before E.C. questioning began
by reducing the calculated ex-
penses for this year’s films
from $4,672 to $3,600 and by
eliminating the $350 allotted for
attending the National Enter-
tainment Conference. The SAB

Phi Delt,

will not send a representative to
the conference this year.

Bill Tucker, vice-president of
the E.C. and former SAB chair-
man, questioned the commit-
tee’s estimated $7,000 loss on
the Fancy Dress Ball. That
figure was reduced to $5,000.

“You have $3,600 budgeted
for films and films are basically
a break-even business,’’ said
Rob Calvert, senior represen-
tative, also a former member of
the SAB.

Hall explained that the SAB
did not “expect to break even”
on films this year because they
plan to show more recent
movies, which cost more to ob-
tain.

Unconvinced, the E.C. fur-
ther reduced the total film
budget to $2,200 for the year.
And when the smoke had
cleared, the SAB was left with

$30,910--$4,822 less than the

Phi Kap

cited for noise
violations Sunday

by Charles Tucker

Phi Delta Theta President
Syd Farrar and Jim Welch, a
member of Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity, were each issued a
summons for violations of the
Lexington city noise ordinance
last Sunday morning.

While Farrar was
unavailable for comment, other
members of Phi Delt maintain-
ed that the noise level was kept
at a minimum and that their
band music could not be heard
on the street. One member
speculated that the police were
attracted due to noise made by
persons on the sidewalk outside
the house. The police arrived at

approximately 1:30 a.m., ac-
cording to members of the
fraternity.

Thirty minutes later Jim
Welch of Phi Kappa Sigma was
taken to the police station and
issued a summons by Lexington
Police Officer Purvis. Welch,
who says he will plead not guilty
to the charge of breaking the
statute, reportedly placed a
stereo speaker in a window fac-
ing out of the fraternity house
and onto Jefferson Street. The
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity
was not charged.

Welch stated that he was

figure they had submitted to the
E.C.

SBA gets 85 percent

The Student Bar Association
requested that the E.C. return
to them 90 percent of the tax col-
lected from W&L’s 344 law
students ($13,932) in a “‘very
detailed” budget outlining how
money would be used.

Last year, the SBA received
85 percent of the tax paid by
each law student.

The SBA budget report listed
six reasons justifying their re-
quest, among them “‘inflation,”’
an $890 ‘deficit at Washington
Hall,”’ and ‘“‘unique’”’ law stu-
dent ‘‘needs.”’

“Since law students have
their own neeas apart from that
of other members of the W&L
community, we feel the SBA is
the group to best meet these
unique attributes of law
students; same as
undergraduate organizations
can best determine how to serve
their constituency, we feel the
SBA has its hand on the pulse of
the law school, and can best
determine how to allocate the
activity fees of law students,”
the budget summary stated.

Many E.C. members were
‘“‘troubled’’ by the SBA’s
reasoning.

Beau Dudley, himself a law
student, asked the SBA to look
at the ‘“‘other side of the coin.
What percentage of SBA funds
should be kept here for Contact
speakers and things like Fancy
Dress? Certainly it seems to us
(the E.C.) that 15 percent is at
least a minimum of what law
students should contribute to
this side of the bridge.”’

‘‘How can you measure this
(the percentage of funds actual-
ly utilized by law students at-
tending undergraduate func-
tions),’’ responded John
Allevato, treasurer of the SBA.
‘Taw students are a little dif-
ferent and we (the SBA) are
best suited to meet their
needs.”’

Tom McCarthy, secretary of
the E.C., called the situation
between W&L’s law and
undergraduate schools a “‘one-

way street,’’ where
undergraduates do not have ac-
cess to all law school activities.

To his criticism, SBA presi-
dent Kevin Cosgrove gave his
assurance that ‘‘there will be
more publicity and _ better
publicity than there was last
year.”

‘Well, I think there’s enough
fat to be trimmed from parts of
their budget that a 5 percent cut
wouldn’t hurt,’’ said Dudley.

Will Mackie, E.C. sophomore
representa‘ ive, said, “I feel the
85 percent figure is a good
amount and will achieve our
end of saving money without
hurting them (the SBA).”’

The motion finally approved
by the E.C. granted the SBA 85
percent of the tax on law
students ($13,158) and $200 to
“offset the debt to Washington
Hall.”’

Contact receives $400 increase

Although the Contact commit-
tee did not receive the full
$7,532.77 it requested of the
E.C., the committee was given
$6,500-—-$400 more than last year.

Tom Salley, co-chairman of
Contact, said that his commit-
tee had hoped to bring six
speakers to campus this year
instead of five, which was the
basis of Contact’s request of
$1,432.77 more than was granted
last year.

“I think it would be unfair to
other groups to authorize an in-
crease of this kind,’’ Dudley
said. ‘It would be a little bit
tough to justify an increase
when we are asking other
groups to make cuts,” the stu-
dent body president continued.

This motion (for $6,500) is the
best we can do and we hope
you'll do your best with it,”
Dudley said.

Ariel to expand

Ariel editor Ben Keesee
presented the E.C. with a $2,866
budget request. The budget in-
cluded the price for three
issues, one with color
photography (in the past, Ariel
has only published two issues a
year in black and white).

Several E.C. members
recommended that Ariel look
into subscriptions, patron

advertising, or other forms of
“‘selfgenerating revenue.’’

“If it takes selling advertising
to put out a quality magazine,

then I am not against doing
that,” Keesee said. He added
that he as editor wants to
“establish Ariel and give it the
potential for growth.”’

Many E.C. members said that
they had been impressed with
the “strides” the literary
magazine has taken recently,
and $2,100 was appropriated.

Ring-tum Phi gets $4,750

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Peter Goss told the
E.C. that advertising revenue
for this year’s paper was ex-
pected to increase $2,100 over
last year, and that he an-
ticipated subscriptions to dou-
ble.

‘This year we have the abili-
ty to both increase the size and
the quality of the newspaper,”
Goss said. ‘‘Any proposed cut
you make this evening would
deprive the W&L student body
of the type of paper they
deserve.”’

Editor-in-chief Gray Coleman
noted that the current staff of
the Ring-tum Phi numbered
“between 43 and 45 people’’
which is ‘‘double the staff of last
year.”

Although he agreed that the
overall quality of the
newspaper had improved,
junior E.C. representative
Steve Abraham said that the
newspaper’s staff should ‘‘be
receptive to the problems we
are having”’ meeting the $75,000
limit.

Beau Dudley urged fewer big
issues, 16-20 pages in length.

In the end, the E.C. voted to
appropriate $4,750 to the
Ringtum Phi’s budget, $535.36
less than requested, but $1,850
more than the newspaper
received last year.

Calyx holding down costs

Grant Leister, business
manager of -the Calyx,
presented a budget for the year-
book which will be substantially
the same as last year’s, but will
cost $1,247 less.

He did request, however, that
the student tax contribution in-
crease $1,011 over last year,
raising the percentage of the
book financed by student funds
by almost 10

another way, Bob Willis, E.C.

Fancy Dress Ticeuns Discussed

by Dick Moss
and Jim Hicks

During the Fancy Dress open
discussion, held in the SAB of-
fice during the regular SAB
meeting, Doug Jackson releas-
ed a tentative list of Fancy
Dress themes for general con-
sideration. That list of themes
included: Fifties, Beach,
Oktoberfest, Colonial America,
Twenties, Las Vegas, Old
South, Star Wars, Orient, New
York City, and the Old West.
Any student who wishes to
make any other suggestions, or
express his opinion of the
themes listed above, is en-
couraged to contact the SAB of-
fice, or any SAB member.

The SAB also announced that
a meeting would be held this

Thursday in the EC room at
4:30 to discuss the University
Council’s suggestion that Fancy
Dress be held within
Washington’s birthday break.

In other major matters before
the SAB, the SAB announced
that Al Gordon has agreed to let
them use duPont auditorium for
their movies this year, on the
condition that no food or drinks
(including alcoholic beverages)
will be allowed in the
auditorium. The SAB also
stated that it would be a student
control offense if any violation
of this condition is found, and all
violators of this rule shall be
referred to the Student Control
Committee. Regulations con-
cerning the use of the
auditorium will be posted out-
side the auditorium by the SAB.

 

student budgets set

(continued from page 2)

gested that fraternities and
organizations be charged $50
more this year for their pages in
the yearbook.

The E.C. voted to appropriate
$9,150 to the Calyx--$861.50 less
than was originally requested,
but $150 more than the publica-
tion received last year.

Smaller clubs

The English Club, formed last
spring, was given $100 of the
$375 requested to sponsor three
speakers from ‘fairly near-by
schools,” according to Parker
Potter, spokesman for the
group.

“T think it’s a good sign to see"

people excited about doing
something culturally oriented,”’
said Bob Willis.

Junior representative Steve
Abraham said that the club
should “have to prove’ that
they were “going to be around
longer than one month.”

“It’s not whether you go
defunct and never operate,”’ ad-

ded John Murphy, the third
year law school representative
on the E.C., “it’s whether you
will operate and get more than
ten people to participate.”

A majority of the E.C. felt,
however, that the English Club
was “worthy enough of a small
investment to see where they
go.”

The E.C. was not willing to
grant the request for $200 to the
Soccer Club to help finance the
Second Annual Liberty Hall In-
door Soccer Tournament.
Dudley suggested that the club
raise revenue by charging an
entrance fee to the tournament
participants or by “‘nitiating
projects on their own.”’

The Pre-Law Society had
originally requested $350, but
president Chip Welch told the
E.C. that his group was “not
asking for anything right now,”’
but might need financial
assistance in the future if they
brought a “big” speaker to
campus.

It is now the responsibility of
the student body to abide by
these guidelines and to main-
tain the trust between the SAB
and the fine arts department. If

the SAB is again asked to leave -

duPont auditorium, the student
body will be without a suitable
location for the weekend films,

and this may result in the
cancellation of the weekend
film series.

The first SAB film this fall
will be Mother, Jugs, and
Speed, a fast-pased comedy
with Bill Cosby and Raquel
Welch. The film will be shown
at 7 and 9 p.m. this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday in duPont
auditorium. There will be an ad-
mission charge of $1. Also, any
person interested in showing
the weekend films and earning
a few dolars should contact one
of the SAB film co-chairmen,
Danny Raskin (463-4089) or Jim
Hicks (463-7855).

at 2:20 a.m., and he and Officer
Purvis sat in the patrol car and
talked. Among the topics
discussed was “the music
which was still blaring from the
Phi Delt house down the
street.”

Interfraternity Council

In a meeting Tuesday night
the Phi Delt arrest was men-
tioned as well as the fact that
the police received six or seven
other complaints. The Phi Kap
arrest was not mentioned
because IFC chairman Jim
Davis felt that the violation was
not in connection with a frater-
nity function.

Davis stressed that it is im-
portant that fraternities keep
within the guidelines prescribed
in the list of concessions
presented to City Council as no
decision has been reached and
it will be “‘ a week or so before
anything positive comes up.”
He added that any fraternity
receiving a summons will have
to appear before the IFC
Judicial Board.

Davis said that he, Student
Body President Beau Dudley,
and Asst. Dean of Students Dan
Murphy will meet Wednesday
with Dr. Thomas C. Imeson, a
professor at W&L. Imeson is the
chairman of the City Council’s
Committee on Public Safety, to
which the matter has been
referred.

Davis said that to get exemp-
tions from the noise ordinance

OO OOOO

on weekends and the Thursday
nights before the three big
weekends the City Council will
have to take action. He said that
Police Chief James A. Kirby
could advise police officers as
to a policy of requiring com-
plaints or giving a warning
before issuing summonses. He
added that the fraternities want
positive determination of noise
levels in violation with the
policy.

Davis suggested that perhaps
police would adopt a plan
similar to the- one used at
University of Virginia in deter-
mining violations. At U.Va., the
police have a decibel meter and
‘stand at the complaintant’s pro-
perty line; if the meter
registers above a predetermin-
ed level, the fraternity is sub-
ject to legal action.

In other IFC business, the
Judicial Board fined Sigma Nu
$75 for putting posters in a
freshmen area advertising a
party. Also, the following
fraternities were fined $10 for
not paying Coach Vern Canfield
for lawn maintenance over the
summer: Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Sigma Nu, Zeta Beta Tau, Delta
Tau Delta, and Pi Kappa Phi.

Rush Chairman Chris Volk
said that houses must pick up
freshmen signed up for rush
dates or face a $20 fine for each
one not picked up. He added
that dorm rush will be held Fri-
day from 3 to5.

Informality marks
Khune’s work

by Don Noble

W&L was fortunate enough to
have been visited last week by
the artist whose works are cur-
rently being exhibited in duPont
Gallery. Dan Khune, who is an
assistant professor of art at
Anne Arundel Community Col-
lege in Maryland, spoke to
several of the art classes. He
explained his paintings and
talked about his approach to
art, which added an extra
dimension to the show.

Kuhne’s approach to the basic
elements of art is fairly in-
formal. He believes that too
much emphasis on color, line,
and other elements can make
the artist too self-conscious and
thereby lose the emotional
quality in the work. Art should
be more spontaneous, not so
calculated and formalistic.

He is especially vocal about
style, and insists that, ‘‘there’s
too much emphasis on style.
That’s something I try not to
think about. A good artist
should try different styles and
always try to do something new.
I tried many ways of painting
before I found where I should
be. I’m an eclectic; I borrow
many styles.”

Kuhne describes his paintings
as, “having to do with that
magical moment when I am one
with the universe.’’ He believes
that his work is akin to the im-
pressionists, and there is a cer-
tain Van Gogh quality in
several of them.

Kuhne does not like minimal
art, which is too basic. He calls
himself a maximal artist; the
more he puts into the painting
the better it is. This achieves a
richness of variety, which can
be seen in the complexity of
vivid colors and strokes. He
compares painting to a sym-
phony, where the brushes are
like different instruments and
the strokes they make like dif-
ferent sounds, all of which come
together to make the work com-
plete, as in his ‘Opera of Spr-

ing.
Kuhne believes that, ‘‘the
most important thing about art

is the content—the spiritual
quality in it. I try to trigger

many kinds of imagery in my ©

work. I paint with all my senses
- a tree should dance in spring,
feel frozen in winter, and look
frightened in a storm.”

Indeed in his painting of a
storm the trees suggest lightn-

 

edaeeorvetp|eeetee

ing and movement. ‘‘You’re
looking in your mind’s eye at
the dream of a tree,’’ said
Kuhne, who also enjoys visual
puns. In his painting ‘Night
time of the Spring Day’’ the
windows and curtains are
meant to suggest an Arab;s
head, while many of the trees
suggest human arms and
hands.

It is especially interesting to
be able to see Kuhne’s
preliminary drawings with the
paintings. These are what he
uses to plan out his paintings.
“Drawings are like X-rays for a
doctor. They are able to capture
something quickly. My drawing
is the vehicle of my meditation.
They should have order, but
also freedom in the order. They
should not be like a

‘photograph.”’

One thing that may be sur-
prising to the viewer is the way
Kuhne does not paint the entire
canvas. He says, “I want my
paintings to be as fresh and
spontaneous as drawings, thus I
didn’t see a need to paint the
whole canvas.”

Kuhne’s paintings do have
this feeling of freshness and
spontaneity. They suggest a
certain power and emotion
which he spoke of. In any event,
it is worth a trip to duPont
Gallery to get an impression of
what he is trying to accomplish
and say in his work.

Poet presents modern view

The poet John Morris will read from his
work on Wednesday, Oct. 4, in Payne 21. Mor-

ris is a graduate of Hamilton College and Col- .

umbia University, and presently teaches
eighteenth-century English literature at
Washington University in St. Louis. He has
published two books of poetry Green Business
and The Life Besides This one, and a critical
study Versions of the Self: Studies in English
Autobiography.

Morris’s poetry deals evocatively, yet not
despairingly with the concerns of modern
man; the isolation of the self, the world’ indif-
ference to the sufferings and doubts of the in-
dividual, and the endless and empty repeti-
tion of human life. Unlike many conte orary
confessional poets, Morris refuses to indulge
in self- pitying laments; rather he reflects on
life with a wry humor which enables us to
laugh or at least smile at the pain he reveals.

Although he aliudes to writers like Blake,
Thoreau, Twain, and Williams, Morris re-
mains highly personal and unpretentious. In
“Between Two Bells” Morris stands in a park

4

Pei teat ete

  
   

hibition

in Japan and listens to the bells of a Buddhist
temple and a Catholic church ringing
simultaneously, yet he refuses to make it into
a metaphor.

I do no want to pretend that this was a moment of
conclusions.

No. It was a moment of standing between the
ringing of two bells.

Inconclusive conclusions are modern man’s
lot according to Morris. He calls to his unborn
son to emerge to a world of suffering and
death:

Fall out of the natural into what small
Deeds you will live in, where,
Whatever you carry in your body to die of and
Whether you go out like a coward or
Aman hanged for the wrong reason,
Screaming with cancer or inch
By bright inch under the knife,
Like us you shall conceive death.
("To an Unborn”)

Besides those dealing with the grim aspects
of life, Morris writes amusing poems, many
of which deal with University life. ‘What the
Professor Said” is a humorous description of
the distance separating the pedagogue and
the pupil. ‘“‘Couch Hour’’ summarizes the ex-
perience of psychoanalysis in seven lines.

A history, a bag of pains,
Interesting only to himself

And not always that,

A mistake no one’s to blame for,
He repeats his errors,

The lesson he knows by heart,
And never learns.

Morris’s wry humor is‘ never clearer than
when he writes of himself. He knows himself
painfully well, and is willing to share himself
with us, without asking for sympathy.
Arthritic, perhaps, and as terrified as now
Of cancer, impatient of the doctor's restraints,

As I potter and mumble in my daughter's garden

I shall go out, despite my salt-free diet,

Full of bourbon and my old complaints.
("Thirty-Seven”)

Morris’s reading will be followed by a wine
and cheese reception in the English seminar
room sponsored by the English department
and the English Club.

“what’s sterile, depressing,
etc., in today’s mores’’ assumes
an entertaining and
sophisticated tone. Through
most of the play, somewhat
longer that one-act in length,
Gray maintains this tone:
quick, sharp, and often less
than kind. In the end, it seems
all to have been rather flip and
shabby, as we realize with a
shock that the humor has in-
sulated us from the
playwright’s seriousness quite
as effectively as the major
character has used liquor, sex,

and the standard electronic con-—

veniences to lessen his unplea-
sant confrontation with reali-
ty’s demands.

John Jacobsen ’79, the direc-
tor, has announced open audi-
tions for five male roles and two
female roles. The auditions will
be conducted this evening and
tomorrow evening, from 7 until
8:30, at the Troubadour
Theatre. Anyone interested in
reading for a part is invited to
attend.

W&L grad
plays Cockpit

Scott Ainslie, a 1974 graduate
of W&L, will return to campus
tonight, for a performance in
the Cockpit. Since he
graduated, Scott has been very
active in various musical
undertakings. He toured Great
Britain and Ireland for two
years, performing for the
British Arts Council, perform-
ing on the public television sta-
tion, the B.B.C. and performing
in various coffee houses
throughout the nation. All of
this was funded by the United
States Information Service:

Since his return to the States,
he has toured the Southeast,
and performed on many public
radio stations in North
Carolina. Primarily a folk ar-
tist, Scott combines British,
Gaelic, and American folk
heritages on his fiddles and ban-
jos.

His show will begin around
7:30, and there will be absolute-
ly no cover charge to anyone.

Power in the Darkness
Tom Robinson Band
Harvest STB-11778

To- paraphrase Jon Landau
(and to risk, no doubt, the same
sort of scorn and ridicule he
received in writing about Bruce
Springsteen), I have seen the
future of rock and roll and it is
the Tom Robinson Band. A little
premature for a band that’s on-
ly released one album? Maybe.
The fact is that I haven’t heard
a better record this year from
any group, much less a new
band.

From the opening chords of
“Up Against the Wall,’’ Power
in the Darkness grabs hold of
the listener and just won’t let
go. Sure, TRB can rock, but so
can a lot of bands. What makes
these guys different? Simply
this: they write songs the likes
of which have been seldom
heard since the old ‘British In-
vasion”’ days. This stuff would
sound good even if Aerosmith
was playing it. Power in the
Darkness contains all original
material, save one song, and
very little can be considered
“filler”? (unusual for a double
album). Outstanding rockers
include the above-mentioned
“Up Against the Wall,’’ ‘Don’t
Take No For An Answer,”
“Ain’t Gonna Take it,’’ and
“Right On Sister.” But TRB
doesn’t play just rock and roll—
some of the album’s best tracks
are on the lighter side, in-
cluding the low-key ‘‘To Good
To Be True,” a moving version
of Dylan’s ‘I Shall Be Releas-
ed,”’ and the very pop-oriented
‘‘2-4-6-8-Motorway” (a British
hit single for TRB).

In short, the Tom Robinson
Band has the songwriting
abilities and instrumental
talent to make it big worldwide.
I see only two things that might
hold them back—both related to
their image, not their music.
First, because they’re new and
British, they may be dismissed
in some. quarters as ‘“‘just
another New Wave band.” It is
true that TRB is an angry bunch
of musicians. The group’s sym-
bol is an upraised, clenched fist,
and when Tom Robinson sings
“we ain’t gonna take it!,’’ you
know he’s not kidding. But TRB
proves that there’s more to
“New Wave’’ than three-chord

rock ‘n roll—when they do ex-
press their frustrations in song
it’s more than pounding guitars
and demented screaming.
Listen to the record; the songs
will stand on their own.

The second possible barrier to
TRB’s success is their release
of a song (included on Power in
the Darkness) called ‘‘Glad To
Be Gay.”’ It’s a good enough
song, actually, but is has (a) of-
fended a few people and more
importantly (b), caused many
potential Tom Robinson fans to
dismiss them as_ another
“curiosity” group, with no real
talent to back them up. Those
who do so are missing a tremen-
dous debut album by a very pro-
mising new band. Power in the
Darkness promises to be one of
the best of ’78; if you buy one
record all year, let this be it.

AN
TOM ROBINSON BAND

Eye And Ear:

From the tidal wave of
enrollments which deluged the
English Department this fall it
seems clear that students have
gotten the message. Their
elders have been proclaiming
with vehemence that young peo-
ple are singularly inept in the
use of their own language.
While being given credit for ad-
ding some vivid words to the
American language, the arriv-
ing generation has been receiv-
ed in recent years with much
headshaking, hand-wringing
and even despair. No
knowledge of sentence-
structure, an unawareness of
such often humorous gaffes as
dangling participles and misus-
ed pronouns. Horrors!

English grammar is not hard
to learn — it makes sense to us.
At least it doesn’t have the verb
placed a mile or so along the

sentence as another language
does. Yet once the basics of bor-
ing routine in_ subjects,
predicates and other oddments
have been digested there comes
the problem of words
themselves. It’s no good know-
ing the structure if you have
nothing much to hang on it.
Often, in the Bookstore we
have requests for books on how
to increase a vocabulary by the
end of next week. Well, ten
years ago would have been a
better time to start, by reading
and more reading. (Incidental-
ly, there are words which I’ve
refused to look up for years, —
such as pejorative, symbiosis,
entropy and moot. However,
I’ve discovered that one of
them, symbiosis, is a great one,
with romantic echoes yet.)
‘There are some _ favorite
short-cuts of mine which I offer

 

for what they are worth. Doing
crossword puzzles. You have to
wrack your mind and surpris-
ing words pop out of your head.
The definitions and stray letters
give leads which help fill in the
empty spaces. Winning is plea-
sant.

The very best help is a
thesaurus (a book containing a
store of words, says Webster’s
International Dictionary.)
There are thesauruses in dic-
tionary form — really just
synonyms — and also in the
more complicated standard
volume. Once you’ve figured
out the latter method it can
widen one’s verbal horizons in
short and lovely order.

And then there are puns. Here
both the eye and ear are put into
play; sense cross-matched with

sound to delight and .appall, .

Coming Home
Hits Home

by Dick Barron

Many of the movie offerings
of the past year have been big
scale productions with flashy
hollywood approaches (Star
Wars, Grease, and Sgt. Pep-
per’s, to name a few). Even
small budget films have, to a
large extent attempted to ap-
peal to the public thirst for
thrills, bigger stars,
louder auto wrecks, and longer
cop chases. An obvious depar-
ture from this trend is Coming
Home,which takes three well-
known stars — Jon Voight, Jane
Fonda, and Bruce Dern — and
places them in serious roles in
an attempt to probe a serious
problem, the Vietnam war.

As memories of the Vietnam
war begin to sink slowly in our
minds, along comes a movie
that brings them back to us in a
personal way. Coming Home is
an anti-war film, but instead of
being shot on the battlefield, the
action is shot almost entirely in
the hospitals and houses of
hometown America.

Assistant basket ball

coach named

Washington and Lee announc-
ed on Tuesday the appointment
of a new assistant basketball
coach.

James P. ‘Jim’ Casciano,
a 1975 graduate of Drexel
University, was named assis-
tant basketball coach by head-

basketball coach Verne Can--

field. Casciano was hired under
a new internship program the
University is instituting this
season, Canfield said.

Casciano was a_ graduate
assistant coach at the Universi-
ty of Delaware last season.
He was part time assistant at
Villanova University during the
1976-77 season. In 1975-76, Cas-
ciano served as freshman coach
and assistant varsity coach at
St. Joseph’s School in
Philadelphia.

Casciano was captain of
Drexel’s 1970-71 freshman
team. While attending Bishop

Kendrick High School in Mor-
ristown, Pa., he was named
honorable mention all-state,
first team all-Catholic, and all
area, in addition to being the
team’s captain and a Scholar-
Athlete recipient.

“We're certainly pleased to
have a coach with Jim’s
background joining us,” said
Canfield. ‘‘we’re looking foward
to his input and his exposure in
the Philadelphia area should be
a big help in our recruiting ef-
forts. He will work in all areas
of our program, including our
junior varsity team, assisting
with the varsity, and in
recruiting.

The 26-year-old is from
Bridgeport, Pa.,and holds his B.
S. degree in Business Ad-
ministration. He expects to
receive his Master of Education
next June.

W&L goes to Centre College
and lose - host Macon Sat.

by Bill Whalen

The Washington & Lee
Generals visited the Centre Col-
onels last Saturday and came
away with a 20-6 loss. The
Generals, now 0-3 on the season,
find themselves in a must win
situation if they are to salvage
any of the rest of the season.
This Saturday’s opponent,
Randolph-Macon College, pro-
mises not only to be a tough
game but also marks the open-
ing.of the General’s Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference.

While his team is off to a
miserable start, Coach Gary
Fallon remains quietly confi-
dent. ‘“‘We like to take each
game separately’’, said Fallon.
“Our defense has improved
with each game but our main
problem has been our offense’s
inconsistency.”

This was never as apparent
as last Saturday when the
General’s offense committed
seven turnovers, including
three fumbles and four in-
terceptions and could put
together only one scoring drive.
“Our offense has been playing
catch-up ball in every game,”
cited Fallon, ‘“‘Which puts a real
burden on the players.”

Against Centre, the Generals
reversed their usual second half
slide by falling way behind ear-
ly in the game. The Colonel’s
first touchdown came after
recovering a fumble on the
W&L three Mike Shannon’s 59
yard run gave Centre their se-
cond touchdown and a 14-0 lead
in the second quarter. A nine-
play, 70 yard drive accounted
for CC’s final touchdown, with
the score coming on a 20 yard
pass from John Quillin to John
Clontz. The Generals trailed
20-0 at the half. ‘‘We still felt we
were in the game, even though
we were behind 20-0,’’ said
Fallon. ‘The defense had been

  

playing well, (only 187 yards
allowed) and we made some of-
fensive adjustments.’’ One of
those adjustments was replac-
ing quarterback Scott Swope
with Chris Leiser.

Defensively, the Generals
played a perfect second half.
They held Centre to only two
first downs and 34 yards in the
last two quarters. More im-
portantly, it was the first time
this year that the Generals have
not collapsed in the second half.
“‘Now they can’t call us a two
quarter football team,’ said
Fallon. ‘If we can put together
sixty minutes of good football
then we'll do all right.”

At this point, however,
Fallon’s team lacks “‘offensive
consistency” and the offense
will have to improve for the
Generals to win, win. ‘“‘We’re
looking for the right quarter-

 

back, and whoever has the best

week in practice will start on:

Saturday,’ said Fallon.

Another key to the General’s:

fate will be the availability of
running back Stewart Atkinson,
whose ankle injury makes him
a probable starter for Satur-
day’s game.

‘*Randolph-Macon’s
strength,” according to Fallon,
‘lies in their strong-suit
defense,”’ which is a 5-2 align-
ment. ‘We'll try to mix-up our
plays to keep them off-balance,
but mainly we want control’ to
control the ball and keep our
defense rested.”

W&L is the underdog in this
game. R-MC is 0-2 but is
predicted to be the strongest
team in the conference aside
from defending champ
Hampden-Sydney. Game time
is 1:30 at Wilson Field.

Soccer team to play ist ODAC
meet after tying Valley United

by Tim Connors

Washington and Lee played
the Valley United Soccer Club
of Roanoke in an exhibition
game last Saturday, and the
two teams battled to a 2-2 tie in
overtime.

Coach Rolf Piranian felt that
the Generals played much bet-
ter this week than in previous
games, and he feels that
“things are finally falling into
place.’”’ W&L_ completely
dominated the game offensive-
ly, taking 44 shots as opposed to
Valley’s 16. The Generals could
not capitalize on _ these
numerous scoring chances,
however, and Piranian feels
that his team must ‘“‘put things
together by better following the
principles ofthe game.”

Todd Tyson opened the scor-
ing for W&L in the first period,
his goal being set up on a pass
from Bryan Williams. A defen-
sive lapse by W&L allowed
Valley to go ahead 2-1 entering
the fourth period, but the
Generals were determined not
to let the game end there. Pira-
nian was proud of the way in

which his team ‘‘never gave
up,” and how Williams came
back with a ‘‘super effort”’ on a
fine individual move, scoring
the goal which sent the game in-
to overtime.

The overtime was dominated
by the W&L offense, with Billy
Brown booming a shot on which
the V.U. goalie had to make a
spectacular save to prevent a
score. Kevin Carney, not to be
outdone in the nets by his oppo-
nent, came up with another

super effort in the second over-
time period to preserve the tie.
As Piranian put it, it was ‘“‘a
question of inches” as to
whether either team would
score, but outstanding  in-
dividual performances nullified
both teams’ chances.

W&L plays host to East Men-
nonite College on Saturday in its
first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference contest, and Piranian
feels that now ‘‘the pressure is
on.”’

Course error ruins
first c-c attempt

by Greg Branan

The Washington and Lee
cross country team began this
year’s season on a controversial
note in last Saturday’s meet at
Davis and Elkins College in
West Virginia.

The Generals were shown the
five mile course in the morning.
At the start of the race,
however, verbal instructions

about the course were given
which .differed with what had
been shown. This new course in-
volved more hills than had been
mentioned before. In addition,
not all the changes were
discussed. Halfway through the
race, D&E’s runners ran a
course that was considerably
shorter than had been shown to

Tennis team readies
for fall tourney

‘ by John Winans

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team made a fair showing
last week at the Navy Fall In-
vitational Tournament, which
was packed with collegiate ten-
nis powerhouses.

Coach Gary Franke chose
Stewart Jackson, Shaw Cran-
field, David Constine, West
Yonge, Pat Morris, Sumner
Boulding, Nat Lovell, Peter
Williams, R. Dan Huebner and
Peter Eliades to make the trip
to Annapolis, Md. ‘‘This was a
top-flight tournament with
some excellent teams and good

athletes. Considering the
amount of practice we’ve had,
we did well,” Franke explained.

The next tennis tournament is
at James Madison this
weekend. Along with W&L and
the Dukes will be Hampden-
Sydney and the University of
Richmond. Franke has already
decided that Jackson, Cran-
field, Constine, Yonge and Nor-
ris will be making the trip to
Harrisonburg and this week he
will decide who will fill the
other two or three slots.

These two tournaments lead
to the Second Annual Fall In-

vitational here at W&L on
Homecoming weekend. ‘We

have to work hard in practice :

this week, get some breaks and
we'll be right at the top this
weekend,” predicted Franke.

- Britons take on the
“Colonies” in W&L debate

Some things in life never
change. The British, who have
been unable to keep from in-
terfering in American politics
for three hundred years, are at
it again.

First it was King George they
wanted to inflict on us. Now it’s
another term for Jimmy
Carter.

It seems a team of debaters
from Cambridge University is
going to visit Washington and
Lee University next week to
argue the question ‘‘Resolved:
That This House Would Re-
Elect Jimmy Carter.”

The Britishers will take the
affirmative.

Washington and Lee,s debate
team -- Washington and Lee be-
ing the school that it is, after all
-- will argue against.

The fracas is scheduled for
Tuesday, Oct. 3, in W&L’s Lee
Chapel, beginning at 7:30 p.m.
The public is invited to witness
the resumption of hostilities
between Great Britain and the
Colonies, and there is no
charge.

This is the sixth encounter in
recent years between the
debaters from W&L and teams
from Great Britain. Previous
topics they have argued have
ranged over whether America
needs a monarchy, whether
America is a_ ‘‘cultural

Toward that end, Drs. Mike
Cappeto and Jim Worth are of-
fering a 6 week seminar entitled
“coping with normal life
stress’. Meeting for 6 weeks in
approximately hour-long §ses-
sions, they will focus on a varie-
ty of techniques which the in-
dividual can employ to reduce
stress and tension that arise in
everyday living. Time manage-
ment, various exercise
regimens, meditation, relaxa-

Monday, October 2, at 3:00 p.m.
in room 114 of the University
Center. All W&L students are
eligible to attend, free of
charge, and may even bring

the Generals. The probelm was
that the front two runners, Rich
Bird and Bob Bates, W&L’s co-
captains, had already run the
longer portion when D&E’s men
cut it short. The cut occurred
immediately before a downhill
run, resulting in D&E’s runners
reaching the bottom first. They
were ahead of Bird and Bates
when earlier they had been 50
yards behind.

At the finish, the score was
27-28 in Davis and Elkin’s favor.
Upon protest, the problem was
resolved, and the score changed
toa tie, 27'2-27'2.

Crossing the finish line first
was W&L’s Rich Bird, fol. low-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On matters
financial

An E.C. budget hearing without bloodshed? Can it
be true? This annual autumn nightmare for student
leaders has always provoked lasting grudges; past
E.C. members have been known to doze openly or
leave the room for liquid courage, while the commit-
tee chairmen begged or brazened their way through
their requests for student tax money. But the current
E.C. members did their homework, and it showed.
The hearings were completed after only five hours —
and no major student organization lost more than 10%
of its original budget request.

This year, student groups requested over $81,000
from the student body tax fund. And even though the
university authorized a $5 tax hike per student, the
total of available funds Tuesday night was $75,000. No
surprise that budget cuts were an obvious result from
the start. What amazes me is how painlessly they
were achieved.

The grestest revision occurred with the Student Ac-
tivities Board, which annually claims about 40% of
the total fund. Maybe the SAB was filled with a spirit
of co-operation; perhaps the co-chairmen were simp-
ly nervous about facing three of their former
members, currently on the E.C. But at any rate, when
their turn came, they confronted the E.C. with $4,000
in self-made cuts. Suddenly, the E.C. found itself well
within the $75,000 limit without hardly twisting one
arm. A quick vote, and the budget was approved to
the sound of applause. So, thanks to the SAB officers
— a few dozen people got to bed earlier and happier
because of your concessions.

Especially encouraging was the E.C.’s growth of
support in other areas. The new English Club receiv-
ed its first official funding on Tuesday. Also, with
nearly 100% of its budget request approved, Contact
may be able to increase its program to seven top
speakers. And above all, pennies from heaven finally
fell on the long-suffering literary magazine Ariel. A
jump in funding of 50% will allow Ariel to increase its
size and number of issues — and even include color
photography.

Even we, the curmudgeons of the Ring-tum
Phi,came out of the hearings reasonably satisified.
The E.C.’s allotment of $4,750 to the newspaper only
covers 25% of our total costs, but it is still the largest
budget grant to the Phi in recent history. We thank
those students who expressed their support of the
newspaper to various E.C. members; it has allowed
us to retain our larger size and format.

Last week, we referred to the budget hearings as
“trench warfare.” Incredibly, it was far from that.
Not a voice was raised, nor was a moment wasted
Tuesday night. The current E.C. is obviously shooting
for an entire year without a major mistake. And if
they can make budget hearings an equitable process,
who’s to say they can’t do all the rest?

vis told him, ‘Son, the sooner
you quit asking questions, the
better off you’ll be.”

Purvis went on to say to
Tucker, “Your behavior in-
dicates...you’re drunk, so I’m
going to charge you with DUI.”

Tucker told Police Lt. Knick
about his dilemma and also told
State Trooper J.L. Hines, who
had come to administer the
breath test. The test was given
at 4:10 a.m. and registered
.04%. In Virginia, one is legally

Beau Dudley, president of
Washington & Lee University’s
student body, formally
presented to the Lexington City
Council a list of ‘“‘concessions”
to the city noise ordinance last
Thursday night.

Speaking on behalf of the
W&L Interfraternity Council
and before an audience com-
prised partially of W&L frater-
nity presidents, Dudley attemp-
ted to ‘‘impress upon City Coun-

review:

(continued from page 5)

Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
portray the obvious victims of
the war. Fonda is the wife,
waiting for her soldier/hus-
band; and Voight is the paralyz-
ed veteran. Dern is the less ob-
vious victim who shields his
anxieties behind an officious
military facade. His wife (Fon-
da) is a volunteer hospital
worker who is reunited with an
old high school acquaintance
(Voight), a patient in the
hospital. Their love story is
often reminiscent of The Other
Side ef the Mountain, but
Voight’s paralysis doesn’t
dominate the film as much as
we might expect.

No, the real concern of the
film is not the physical cruelties
of the war so much as it is the
emotional cruelties. Through
the : tile love affair cormreee

 

greater, and intoxicated but not
in violation if above .05%.
Tucker was then charged by
Magistrate Charles F.
Engleman, who said that Pur-
vis wouldn’t have stopped him
without good cause, and then
said, according to Tucker,
“Son, we may have missed you
on DUI, but you are high on
drugs; I can see it in your
eyes.”’ Tucker was then charg-
ed that he did “unlawfully
operate a motor vehicle on a
public highway under the in-
fluence of alcoholic beverages
or other self-administered in-

cil our strong feeling tha some
sort of change needs to be work-
ed out.’’ The ordinance in ques-
tion is one which prohibits loud
noise such as stereo music after
11 p.m.

One fraternity president was
arrested two weeks ago for
violation of the statute.

The ‘‘concessions” presented
to the Council include the
limiting of fraternity parties to
Wednesday, Friday, and Satur-
day.nights. Also, all music is to
be turned off at midnight on

toxicants or drugs in violation
of Section 14-42 of the Code of .
the City of Lexington, Va.’’ and
for speeding 41 mph in a 25 mph
zone.

Tucker was denied bond that
night and had to spend the night
in jail. He was released on his
own recognizance after a call to
Dean John, who vouched for
him. While in jail, Tucker wrote
all that had happened on a piece
of paper. When he asked for
more paper, the jailer told him
that “We don’t have time for
you to write a...book.”’ Tucker
also asked if he could have his

Dudley stated that the IFC
has taken it upon itself to adopt
the provisions and to enforce
fines upon violation. A $100
penalty will be imposed in the
event of a fraternity’s first of-
fense and revocation of all par-
tying priveledges may be the
result of subsequent violations.
In exchange for these
“concessions,” Dudley asked

“Coming Home”

the marine wife and crippled
veteran, the scriptwriters
(Waldo Scott and Robert C.
Jones) try to convey the emo-
tional hardships that we as a na-
tion endured during the Viet-
nam conflict. Voight represents
the veterans, the injured youth,
and the angry mobs of the pro-
test movement; Fonda, the con-
cerned but somewhat insignifi-
cant sympathizers and Dern,
the military mind, faced with
defeat, who keeps on shouting,
“T just want to be a hero.”
Fonda, Voight, and Dern all
turn out excellent per-
formances in their formidable
roles. Unfortunately, director
Hal Ashby doesn’t quite live up
to his subjects. The semi-
documentary style of Coming
Home, effectively sets the mood
of 1968 America. Make-up,

styles and music are all perfect,

but there are times when the
loud music becomes so annoy-
ing that it distracts, rather than
aids, audience attention.
Ultimately, in the last few
scenes of the film, Ashby’s
direction, where it should draw
the loose ends together, allows
the film, and its characters to
trickle off into a kind of subur-
ban obscurity.

Maybe it’s too soon for history
and films to view the Vietnam
war. in an objective light. Until
that happens, we will just have
to endure such inspired, but
uneven efforts as Coming
Home.

Student initiates investigation of police

Skoal (snuff) back; it was
thoroughly searched before it
was returned.

Tucker went to complain to
Chief Kirby. Tucker says that
Kirby seemed “fairly sym-
pathetic’’ and recommended
that he file a formal complaint,
which Tucker has done.

The case was tried on Sept.
12, before Judge Hess. Hess
dropped the DUI charge and
reduced the speeding charge to
34 mph in a 25 mph.

Tucker filed a two page com-
plaint on Executive Committee
stationary to Chief Kirby. In it,
Tucker states that “‘the purpose
of this letter is not to seek per-
sonal retribution against Of-
ficer Purvis, but to enable your
office to investigate the matter
to your satisfaction.”’

Purvis said in an interview
that he took Tucker in because
he felt Tucker’s behavior in-
dicated that he was intoxicated.
He said he had nothing to do
with Tucker having to spend the
night in jail despite proof of

sobriety or with Tucker being
held without bond; that those
things were up to the
magistrate.

Magistrate Engleman said
that he could not comment on
this specific case, but that he
has the power to hold anyone if
he sees fit, regardless of
whether they are legally drunk.
He said that it was up to his
discretion to hold Tucker even
though Tucker was proven not
intoxicated, but he would not

say why.
The matter is now under
police investigation. Tucker

closed his letter of complaint to
Kirby with “I feel that Purvis’
reaction to the situation is un-
called for and that he may
possibly have been attempting
to intimidate me with the two
charges. For these reasons, I
am officially bringing this mat-
ter to your attention so that you
may respond to it as you see

Convention :

This is the first of a weekly
series of articles about W&L’s
Mock Republican Convention,
which will be held in May, 1980.

In just a little less than 20
months Washington and Lee
students for the seventeenth
time will once again try to ac-
curately predict the presiden-
tial nominee for the party out of
power. The Mock Convention, a
proud tradition at W&L dating
back to 1908, is still a distant
event, but planning has been go-
ing on since the gavel closed the
1976 Convention — a Convention
that accurately nominated both
Jimmy Carter and Walter Mon-
dale. Highly regarded
throughout the nation for its
realism, the Washington and
Lee Mock Convention has the
reputation for being the most
accurate of the nation’s col-
legiate mock conventions. Time
magazine characterized it as
the “biggest and boomingest’’
of all such events. Newsweek
has called it ‘‘the most
realistic.” Syndicated colum-
nist David Brudnoy has said
that ‘‘the results have been im-
pressive over the long run” (11
right predictions, 5 wrong
ones). Such renowned

newspapers as the New York
Boston

Times, Globe,

Washington Post, and Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch have
said much the same thing.

With personal preferences
put aside, the Mock Convention
will be conducting a great deal
of research — trying to pick the
Republican candidate for presi-
dent in 1980. Already there is a
large field of potential can-
didates, from Ronald Reagan to
George Bush, and this fall the
majority of the work will begin.

The Mock Convention is the
largest single event held during
every student’s four years at
W&L — over $35,000 was spent
for the 1976 Convention. There
are numerous positions that
must be filled and every student
will have an opportunity to par-
ticipate, whether it be as a state
chairman, delegation member,
or steering committee member.
In keeping with its drive for ac-
curacy, the convention is divd-
ed into state delegations with
numbers equal to that of the ac-
tual Republican National Con-
vention. Within each delegation
numerous jobs will have to be
filled. For the convention as a
whole, there will also be many
positions. There will be groups
working on public relations and
media coverage, finance and
the parade through Lexington
which traditionally opens the

convention. Aside from the
research that state delegations
will conduct regarding how
their state will vote at the ac-
tual convention, there is a good
deal of work in other political
areas, such as committees to
monitor the campaigns of each
of the candidates, conduct hear-
ings and write the convention
platform, and direct research
into credentials procedures and
party rules.

In keeping with the Mock Con-
vention’s number one goal — to
promote political education and
enlightenment — a speaker’s
program will be held this year,
bringing influential Republican
leaders, potential candidates,
and nationally-known political

_ journalists to campus.

More information will be pro-
vided — check this column from
week to week. Applications for
state chairmanships and steer-
ing committee positions will ap-
pear later during the term.
Each position available will be
well defined with the applica-
tion procedures outlined. Also
to appear in this column are ar-
ticles regarding national
politics, from Republican party
direction to potential presiden-
tial candidates to significant na-

tional issues,

Rush Remembered

Rush! What is rush? Is it a
gaggle (as in geese) of up-
perclassmen, all identically
dressed in button-down Oxford
shirts, khakis, and topsiders,
babbling on about how diver-
sified the house is (’’Well, I’m
from Mobile and he’s from Bir-
mingham, don’t you know?’’) Is
it these same innocuous up-
perclassmen trying feverishly
to persuade some poor, in-
ebriated freshman that all he
has to do is tear the piece of
paper stuck to his chest for a
bond of allegiance to cement his
soul to that of the rest of the
fraternity until unpaid dues do
they part?

Let’s follow a_ freshman
through a session of open
houses. Without naming Greek
letters, he walks into the first
fraternity guided by a brute
who bears a_ strong
resemblance to Quasimodo of
Notre Dame. His appearance is
explained upon arrival by a

gorilla wearing shoulder pads
(the house president) who in-
forms our hero that the guide
was elected to the esteemed
position of house tackling dum-
my.

At house number two our un-
suspecting freshman has the
poor misfortune to be born
north of the Mason-Dixon line
and is immediately sent on the
attic tour. But he is treated like
royalty compared to a dark-
hued friend who can’t unders-
tand why some of the fraternity
members are cutting small
holes in sheets. ‘‘It isn’t time for
Halloween yet, is it?”’

The third house takes an im-
mediate dislike to our freshman
for one of the most insightful,
perceptive, and _ intelligent
reasons this side of New Haven
or Cambridge. There aren’t any
buttons to hold down the collars
on his shirt. He is given the
deluxe freezer tour complete
with hospitable scholar inside to
hand the freshman a coke
before returning to his organic
chemistry. This last caper
comes from a friend of mine in
one of Dean John’s favorite
fraternities.

The fourth fraternity is runn-
ing a gatoring contest. Those
who aren’t totally repulsed and
disgusted get bids, while those
that can’t rock it get sent to the
fifth fraternity on the card, the
Omegas of Faber College.

Cockpit employee can book bands, charge cover

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to allow the
management of the Cockpit,
Washington and Lee’s tavern,
to contract entertainment bas-
ed on gate receipts from a cover
charge.

Burr Datz, assistant manager
of W&L’s food services, made
the request to hire bands on his
own discretion and pay them
with the monies received from
an entrance fee charged all
patrons.

His concern was not with

‘‘Noise”’

(continued from page 9)
that a warning be issued by the
police before arresting the of-
fender.

He also expressed hope that a
citizen-complaint policy might
be adopted, in which police ac-
tion be taken only after a
citizen-grievance has been
received. Such a policy might
help to eliminate the ‘‘subjec-
tivity of the police’ which
Dudley feels is the most disturb-
ing aspect of the ordinance.

Dudley further requested that
leniency of the ordinance be ex-
tended on W&L’s “‘big”’
weekends: Homecoming, Fan-

cy Dress Ball and Spring
Weekend.

usurping the power of the Stu-
dent Activities Board in br-
inging entertainment to the
Cockpit, he said, but in being
able to take advantage of bands
offering to play at W&L with on-
ly a few days advance notice.
“The Cockpit, as an enter-
tainment center, is getting a
pretty good name up and down
the East Coast,’ Datz said,
‘and if some band calls up, I
don’t want to have to tell them,
‘well, we've got a little political
situation here which means I
have to go to the students to see

brought to

suggested the use of an elec-
tronic decibel meter in the
judgement of noise violation, a
policy which has been adopted
by Charlottesville police. Such a
measure would hopefully lead
to “a more objective or-
dinance.”’

Dudley pointed out that the
fraternities have already made
Significant progress’’ in
decreasing the volume of noise.
He also noted that if the pro-
posal is adopted and violation of

 

if it’s o.k., and they don’t meet
‘till Monday.’”’

“If somebody does call up, I
don’t see why we can’t give
them (the students) the op-
portunity to see good bands,”’
Datz continued.

Junior E.C. representative
Steve Abraham said, ‘the
students are paying for use of
this facility (the Cockpit) and
they shouldn’t have to pay
again.’’ He recommended that
persons not connected with the
University be charged a higher
price at the gate. ‘I definately

In conclusion, Dudley asked
that the Council take a good
look at the problem, speculating
that “the City of Lexington
might be in for an unnecessarily
unpleasant year” if something
is not done.

think a W&L student should be
charged less,”’ he said.

The E.C. resolved to
authorize Datz ‘‘to contract
entertainment’’ whose salary
would be based solely on gate
receipts. The plan is to be on a
trial basis during the first
semester and will be reexamin-
ed by the E.C. after Christmas.

In other action at Monday’s
Executive Committee meeting,
Bill Tucker, vice-president of
the E.C., disclosed that the
committee has not retained a

treasurer as prescribed in the
student body constitution. °

The treasurer is supposed to
write all checks,must not be a
member of the student body,
and must be approved by the
President of the University.

Tucker said that as far as he
could estimate, there had not
been a treasurer retained by the
E.C. for three years. The last
person to hold the job was a
retired banker in town who was
treasurer for 45 years, Tucker
said
