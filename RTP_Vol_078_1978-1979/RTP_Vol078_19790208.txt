EC Gives

Lacrosse
Team

$1,000

by Randy Smith

The student Executive Com-
mittee dispensed $1,300 from its
EC Funding account Monday
night, the bulk of the money go-
ing to Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse team for a training trip
to Florida over the winter
break.

By a close 6-5 vote, the EC
gave the athletic team $1,000 to
help pay for the Florida trip,
which W&L lacrosse coach Jack
Emmer said would cost a total
of $5,750.

Monday’s controversial vote
marks the first time in memory
that the student EC has funded
an intercollegiate sport.

Emmer told the committee
that $2,400 had been collected in
contributions from parents and
alumni. The team raised
another $1,000 from the sale of
visors, and found $1,000 in the
lacrosse team’s travelling
budget.

Emmer said he hopes to raise
an additional $200 by collecting
a $1 cover charge that will be
assessed to see an unnamed
band in the Cockpit next week.

“The players are already
paying for their own meals, so
anything the EC can do will cer-
tainly help us on our way,” Em-
mer said.

After some discussion about
other possible sources of
money, Rob Calvert, senior EC
representative, proposed that
the EC “give them (the lacrosse
team) the money that they need
now ($1,350) on a condition that
some attempt be made to repay

_ it in part” by charging a small

President Huntley To Address IFC

by John Billmyre

President Huntley will ad-
dress the Interfraternity Coun-
cil Tuesday, Feb. 13 concerning
the condition of fraternity
houses and the Alumni Inspec-
tion scheduled for spring.

In making the announcement
about Huntley, IFC president
Jim Davis urged ‘‘all represen-
tatives to attend with officers.”’

The announcement came as a
surprise to many at Tuesday
night’s meeting, but Davis said
“a number of us have met with
President Huntley already “

The Judicial Board had a full
slate.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
presented a bill for damages
amounting to $449 by Hollins
College and placed on
two.weeks social probation by
the IFC as a result of a party
held on Jan. 13 at Hollins’
Moody Center.

According to a letter of com-

plaint from Hollins to the IFC,
+wo prints, a partition in the
men’s room, and several signs
have either been destroyed or
are missing.

“An ice cream machine was
broken into and ice cream was
distributed by members of SAE
and several other fraternities,”’

said Billy Webster, SAE presi-:

dent.

Although Webster said, ‘“‘We
accept full responsibility for the
party and will pay for the
damages,” several Judicial
Board members felt the SAE’s
were not the only party to
blame.

Charles Terry, IFC junior
justice said, “‘It’s just like the
PiKA party at Sweet Briar,

’ everyone showed up.’’ Webster

The considered proposal to
change Lexington’s existing
noise ordinance was officially
defeated at the Lexington City
Council’s Feb. 1 meeting.

Councilman Thomas C. Im-
eson, speaking for the Public
Safety Committee, said that
they recommended no change
in the statute because the or-
dinance was no more restrictive
than others in surrounding com-
munities and less restrictive in
one instance.

City Council Makes

In short, ‘‘the committee does
not recommend any change in
the noise ordinance,” Imeson
said.

Imeson pointed out that the
Charlottesville noise ordinance
was enforced through the use of
a decible meter that registers
sound.

City Attorney William O.
Roberts then questioned the en-
forcability of this method and
further stated that he did not
want to ‘‘break legal ground.”’

“It is fair to say that there

was some disappointment
regarding the decision,’ said
Imeson, who attended an Inter-
fraternity Council meeting Jan.
30, where he _ informed
Washington and Lee students of
the decision. Their feeling was
that the Lexington Police
Department was
discriminating against frater-
nities, he added.

“This council does not in any
way condon or permit any
discriminatory enforcement of

supported Terry’s claim and
added, ‘‘Six other fraternities
and many Hampden-Sydney
students showed up.”’

In another discipline related
situation, Davis suggested that
fraternities make a move to
discipline themselves.

Decisions made by the IFC
are subject to review by the Stu-
dent ‘Affairs Committee as
Davis pointed out. He suggested
that decisions made by frater-
nities could be reviewed in the
same manner.

3 File for
EC Law

Position

Three first-year law students
submitted their names to the
EC Monday night for the posi-
tion on the committee being
vacated by Jenelle Mims.

Mims resigned from the EC
last week citing a heavier-than-
expected work load as the
reason for her resignation.

Mims will leave the commit-
tee when a replacement is
selected next Monday.

Students React to
New Fence Around U.C. Debates Grade Review

McCormick Library

by Dave Murray

“They were tearing this place
up when I was a freshman and
they’ll be tearing it up when I
leave. I’ll never get to see it in
one piece.”’

That’s one man’s reaction to
the fence that has recently gone
up around the old McCormick
Library and restricted access to
the back campus.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
the President, says that the con-
tractor in charge of re-modeling
the back campus is trying to be
fair about the situation. There is
a lot of exterior work left to be
done on the back campus. The
outside of the old library will
not be changed, but extensive
landscaping, parking, sewerage
work and other facets of the job
will begin soon.

At first glance it seems that
the fence is very inconvenient
for students who wish to get to
the back campus or wish to get
to the Co-Op from somewhere
on the back campus. But so far
at least there are ways to beat
the set-up.

Tuesday morning there was
an opening in the part of the
fence stretching between the
back of Newcomb Hall over to
Reid Hall. So from Reid Hall or
anywhere on the back campus it
was possible to reach the Co-Op
without having to circle around
the buildings on the colonnade.

If you chose this direct route
you found a fence blocking your
way at the entrance to the Co-
Op. However you could go
aroung toward the bookstore
entrance and slip in between the
boxwood and the side of the Co-

Op and jump up on the porch.

“It’s a C-school plot to cut
down on J-school Co-Op.runs,”’
said Joe Dashiell.

Apparently too many
students caught on to this ploy
and somebody didnt like it.
Tuesday afternoon when the
direct route was taken again it
was a little harder to negotiate.
There was a tangle of barbed-
wire laying on the ground
behind the boxwood.

Perhaps it was this barbed-
wire and several other pieces
which barred access through a
hole in the fence next to
Newcomb Hall that prompted
one student to talk of Gestapo
agents, and of Steve McQueen
slipping through the fence to
freedom.

Some students looked at the
fence as a blessing, however.
One. J-school major said, “If
I'm cruising from the Co-Op to
Reid Hall and I’m almost late
for class, that damn fence is the
best excuse I’ve ever had to can
class.”’

Access to the back campus
from the gym was easy enough
for some students. Instead of
circling all the way around to
the Colonnade some were slipp-
ing through the construction
yard beside the old McCormick
library.

The inconvenience caused by
the fence is just one part of the
picture. Several students were
concerned about how the chain-
link fence looks. Reddes Taper
even went so far as to say that
the fence is,’ ‘“‘A blasphemy to

the beauty of the campus.”
Well, you can’t please
everybody.

Contact Debate
Slated for Wed.

A debate between two na-
tionally known commentators
on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, former U.S. Sen.
Eugene McCarthy and “Na-
tional Review’’ publisher
William A. Rusher, will take
place next week at Washington
and Lee University.

Their debate, sponsored by
‘‘Contact,’’ the student organiz-
ed symposium which brings na-
tionally known commentators
to the W&L campus, will take
place next Wednesday, Feb. 14,
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

“Directions for the 1980s’’ will
be the topic for the debate
which will include discussion on
subjects likely to affect the U.S.
in the next decade.

McCarthy, a two-term con-
gressman and U.S. Senator
from Minnesota, ran for Presi-
dent in 1968, opposing the Viet-
nam War, and again in 1976, as
an Independent questioning the
two- party political system.

William A. Rusher, publisher
of the “National Review”’ since
1957, also writes a syndicated
column, ‘‘The Conservative Ad-
vocate.” He received New York

University School of Laws’s
“Distinguished Citizen Award”’
in 1973 for ‘‘his able articulation
of the conservative viewpoint.”

Dudley vs. Atwood

by David Greer

The University Council voted
to change the wording in the
Faculty Executive Committee’s
Grade Review guidelines to
make the rules a stronger state-
ment of students’ rights.

The adopted guidelines say
that “It is the expectation that
each professor will’ adhere to
the listed guidelines. The U.C.
voted to substitute ‘‘It shall be
the responsibility of each pro-
fessor to” for that phrase.

The U.C. also voted to change
the wording in the phrase ‘‘The
Head of the Department may
then discuss the grade’ and
substitute ‘‘shall’’ for “‘may.”

Dean Edward C. Atwood said
that the faculty EC will vote on
the changes and pass their
recommendation down to the
faculty at its meeting in March
for final approval.

Atwood said that the faculty
EC did not vote on the changes

Photos

The SAB recently announced
that special photographs will be
on sale for the 1979 Fancy Dress
Ball, with its special theme “A
Taste of the Big Apple.’’ The
photo is a night shot of Times
Square in New York City, as it
was on January 27, with
“WASHINGTON AND LEE
FANCY DRESS 1979 — A
TASTE OF THE BIG APPLE”
featured on the color graphics
board atop Times Square. The
message is surrounded by a red
border and features a large ap-
ple in each of the four corners.

For those interested, this
board is the same one used to
display special messages on
New Year’s Eve as well as the
opening credits for Saturday
Night Live.

The photos are due to go on
sale Wednesday, February 14,
and are being offered as a
special limited edition. Only
five hundred have been
ordered, SAB officials reported.
Prices for the photos will be an-

 

nounced at a later time.

at its last meeting because it did
not have written copies of the
change.

Student body president Beau
Dudley said he felt that
‘responsibility’ is a stronger
word”’ and that “‘it is too easy to
weasel around ‘expectation.’”’
He added that “In the minds of
the students, it’s a significant
change.”

Atwood said he felt that the
department head should have a
chance to reject a student’s re-
quest if he felt it was il-
legitimate and pointed out that
there is no punishment involved
for professors not complying
with the guidelines.

Dudley said that under the
present system, a student has
no place to go if a professor does
not want anything to do with a
case, and hoped that the
guidelines would give the
students an alternative. ;

Dr. Robert W. McAhren said

that he did not think bringing in
the department head ‘‘would
achieve any of the objectives on
the list.”’

Dudley said that the grade
review guidelines would be a
preventative measure rather
than a corrective one and that
“frivilous complaints would
water down the power of the
rules.’”’

Dudley stressed that the
guidelines should be followed as
every student had a right to
grade review and a syllabus.
Dean William J. Watt said that
requiring a prescription of
course plans is an infringement
on a professor’s rights. Dudley
pointed out that the guidelines
would only require a general
outline of course expectations.

In other UC business, it was
announced that Thanksgiving
Break would last for a full week
next year and that exams would
start ona Wednesday.

Students Sentenced
On Drug Charges

Two Washington and Lee
graduates, a current senior,
and a Lexington man were
sentenced to jail terms on drug
charges last Wednesday in
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court.

W&L 1978 graduates Spencer
Clark Jackson, 23, of Lexington,
and Chris Reid, of Garden City,
N.Y., and senior James W.
McElroy II, of Fairfax, Va., will
all serve six-month jail terms in
lieu of penetentiary sentences,
and will be on probation after
their release. McElroy will be
allowed to finish school before
he begins his sentence. Jackson
and Reid are to report to the
county jail by Saturday.

Sale of marijuana, the charge
upon which all three were con-
victed, is a felony in Virginia
and carries a sentence of five to
40 years in the penitentiary,
plus a fine of up to $25,000.

The Lexington man, John D.
“Nakkie”’ Keller, 21, was con-
victed of an accomodation sale,
a misdemeanor offense. He

 

    

Mon. - Sat. 9 - 9, Sun. 10-7

received a one year jail
sentence with 10 months
suspended.

All four had previously plead-
ed guilty to charges that they
had sold marijuana. Wednes-
day’s hearing was an opportuni-
ty for the court to hear
testimony from undercover
agents and character witnesses
in an attempt to determine
whether the drug sales should
be classified as a felony or as a
misdemeanor accomodation
sale.

The four were arrested
following an undercover in-
vestigation by State Police
which began in December 1977
and concluded in May 1978.

Jackson was introduced to
police undercover agent Peter
Moorman by Curtis Green, an
acquaintance formerly living in
Lexington. Commonweath’s At-
torney Beverly C. “John’’ Read
said that Green has been given

immunity on other drug
charges.

Law Women Deal With Special Housing Problems

pe meeeneste:

by Stuart Snyder

Rebecca Dolins, a third year °

law student, ‘‘lucked out’”’ last
year when she found an ‘‘ideal”’
place to live this year.

- “But it had not always been:

that easy,’”’ she added. In her
first year she had to sift through
the list of landlords and places
to rent, not knowing which ones
were acceptable for her.

This is not a specific problem
faced by one female law stu-
dent, but one encountered by
the whole law school, male and
female alike.

It is particularly troublesome
to the first year student who
lives a great distance from Lex-
ington and is not familiar with
the ropes, according to Susan
Gray, another law student and
initiator of last year’s pilot pro-
gram to help female law
students find housing.

“The University is helpful in
that it gives the law students a
mimeographed sheet of all
known available places to
rent,”’ she said. ‘‘But,’’ Dolins
added, ‘‘the list is impersonal in
that it neither gives a real
evaluation of what it would be
like to live in the places nor is
the list current.

“Hopefully things will be dif-
ferent this year,’’ speculated
Dolins. She is presently the
head of an organization that will
try to evaluate area housing
and give estimates of the condi-
tions of the housing for students
searching for places to live.

Since the organization
presently only encompasses
law students, the survey being
conducted right now has only
been circulated in the law
school. In fact, according to
Cindy Fausold, a law student
and president of the Women’s
Law School Organization, the
surveys are due February 10,
1979.

According to Dolins, this
survey will help alleviate the
major probelm of landlords
choosing not to advertise. They
prefer to deal by ‘word of
mouth,’ which means that

 

 

many students are often exclud-
ed, she said.

This is not the first year of the
organization. Last year it was
spear-headed by Susan Gray. In
fact, originally it was started to
help just the female law
students, said Gray.

According to Gray, it was
organized because of one major
problem: the difficulty of
female law students in getting a
place to live. “Places are hard
enough to find in a town the size
of Lexington,”’ she adds,. “‘but
some people just will not permit
girls to rent from them for
various reasons.”’

Last spring, the organization
sent out a survey similar to this
year’s. The response was better
than expected, Gray said.

Then, with the help of Nor-
man Mohler, Director of
University Services, the
organization compiled a pilot
list.

According to Gray, Mohler
helped for a while, but then he
became too busy to be any help.
So, they were left on their own.
Unfortunately, it floundered,
said Dolins.

Dolins said that starting too
late was the key factor in last
year’s failure. She adds, ‘‘this
year we have started earlier
and are hoping for much better
results.”

Under the proposed system,
the files will be kept constantly
up to date by use of filing cards.
Invalid cards will be removed
and replaced by valid ones,
Dolins said.

One of the major problems at
present is getting a permanent
office set up, said Dolins. One of
last year’s problems was not

The Ring-tum Phi, Feb. 8, 1979, Page 3

open to the law students right

now, ‘‘ideally we would like to
help anybody,” states Dolins.
“Right now we have our hands
full.”’

“Our objective is not to
replace the current system, but
to provide a viable alternative
for the new and returning law
student who comes in March or

 

“Places are hard enough to find in a

town the size of

Lexington, but some people just will not permit girls to

rent from them for various reasons.”

SS

Presently, a prospective law
student receives from the
University a list of landlords
and places to choose from. But
it is up to the student to
negotiate with the individual
landlord, whether by mail or in
person, which is a disadvantage
to the student who comes from
any distance, said Gray.

having a permanent telephone,
according to Fausold. ““We had
to use the telephone in the Stu-
dent Bar Association and then
go chasing all over the school
for recipients of the calls,’’ she
adds. Ultimately they would
like to have one phone of their
own.

that the system will ‘‘run itself,

instead of off the novelty of the»

idea.”’

neighboring girls’ colleges
presently compose about one
percent of Washington and
Lee’s student body. ‘heir
numbers vary from term to
term, but they still require
housing during their stay.

According to Mohler, girl ex-
change students are advised to
seek university housing, but the
university does not
automatically help them. He
says they have to find housing
like any other student.

“We try to help them when
they come to us,”’ said Mohler.

According to Mohler, three of
the twelve girls are living in the
Woods Creek Apartments with
room for two more. He added
that the Woods Creek Apart-
ments are the only suitable
university housing for females.

Mohler said, ‘‘we feel
obligated to the girls par-
ticipating in the program, but
they have to come to us to get
help with housing.”’

Masieal Mainstream

Much has been written as of
late about the apparent unwill-
ingness of most major labels to
invest any amount of time-or
money into the ‘‘breaking-in’”’ of
new or unknown jazz acts. Col-
umbia, for example, may be
willing to “take a chance”’ on a
comeback album by an already
established artist like Dexter
Gordon, but the road to success
for most young artists generally
leads directly to one of the
many small independent labels
that have been formed in reac-
tion to the inertia of the “‘big-
gies.”’

Until last December, the jazz
market had been dominated by
two labels, Pablo and ECM,
both of which had distribution
deals with major labels (Pablo
with Atlantic and ECM with
Polydor and, more recently,
WEA). Well, as the old saying
goes, it’s time for the “‘big two’”’
to move over and make room
for the new kid in town, Inner
City. In the course of the last
two months, Inner City and its
affiliates (Classic Jazz, Choice,
and Aural Explorer) have
released no less than 23 albums,
ranging from the staid tradi-
tionalism of Arnett Cobb to the
pure funkiness of Hubert
Eaves.

It’s hard for any one person to
rave unreservedly about Inner
City’s releases as a whole, since
they represent such a broad
sampling of today’s interna-
‘tional jazz market, but, to quote
another old saying, there is
definitely ‘‘something for
everyone’ on Inner City. Some
of the standouts to date have
been Art Farmer’s The Sum-
mer Knows, a proudly tradi-
tional program which features
delightful versions of ‘“‘Alfie’’
and the title track (from Sum-
mer of ’42) and, on the more
modern side, slightly fusion- es-
que releases from such
previously unknown artists as
Jeff Lorber and Ryo Kawaski.

Inner City may or may not be
the ‘‘fastest growing label in the
world” (to quote their press
releases), but they are filling a
void in the jazz market that has
been empty for far too many
years. One can only hope that

 

their success will inspire the
rest of the independents to keep
up the proverbial fight and, in
the long run, maybe even bring

about a new surge of interest in:

jazz on the part of the major
labels.

New Wave!

On Friday night the W&L community is in
store for a rare treat. Playing in the Cockpit at 8
p.m. will be a real live new wave band. En route
from Atalnta to New York’s CBGB’s, as opening
act for Devo, the Swimming Pool Q’s will play

the Cockpit.

This once in a lifetime opportunity to ride the
New Wave will cost W&L students $1.00 and

others $2.00.

Says the Atlanta newspaper of the Pool Q’s,
“Their guitar, saxophone and lyrical imagery
bring to mind Captain Beefheart during his
Trout Mask Replica period, but the Q’s sound is
more accessible. Band leader Jeff Caldor says
that, ‘‘At heart they’re good old boys.”’

In any event this 5-pc. New Wave band, com-

plete with a female vocalist,

called a

‘phenomenon unto themselves” promises to be a
lot of fun. Friday night, 8:00, In the Cockpit.

Film Society Presents:

Malle’s Zazie,

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Werner
Herzog’s The Great Ecstasy of
the Sculptor Steiner and Louis
Malle’s Zazie on a double bill
Friday and Saturday, February
9th and 10th, at 8 p.m. Both
films will be shown on both
nights. Screenings of this fourth
offering in the university series
will take place in classroom
“C” of Lewis Hall, the Law
School, free of charge.

The Film Society decided on
Herzog’s ski short The Great
Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner
(1975) to make it possible to see

known directors in the
celebrated West German

by Mark Mainwaring
and Robin Meredith

over my $7.50 almost solely in
anticipation of the opening act
— Triumvirat. I was what you
might call a dedicated fan back
then, since Triumvirat was
playing exactly the sort of
music I loved at the time For
the most part heavy, extended
electronic concept pieces that
touched ground only when ab-
solutely necessary. I just knew
the first part of the show would
be worth the money; besides, I
figured I could always leave
before BTO came on and pound-
ed my eardrums into oblivion.

Triumvirat never showed. My
efforts to get my tickets refund-
ed were to no avail. I sat
through one and a half hours of
Bachman-Turner Overdrive,
AND I even enjoyed it — but I
still felt betrayed.

A La Carte initially caused a
similar reaction. It started out
well enough, with a slowly ris-
ing electronic crescendo of the
opening track (‘‘Waterfall’’). It
soon became all too obvious,
though, that this was not the
same Triumvirat I had known

renaissance of the 70’s. The
other two major directors in the
movement, Rainer Werner
Fassbinder and Win Wenders,
were represented recently in
the series by Chinese Roulette
and The American Friend.

Herzog is the most mystical
of the three, and generally
selects unusual subjects (the
world of the deaf, for instance,
or a man who refuses to move
although the volcano beneath
which he lives is about to erupt)
in order to show people living at
their limits, and to explore what
these limits are.

The Great Ecstasy features

finest ski jumper in the world,
in a meditation on human
physical movement and our
yearnings for flight, for
transcendent experience. Her-
zog narrates his own film, set-
ting up implicit parallels bet-
ween Steiner’s risk-taking and
creativity under extreme
pressure, and his own.

The main feature of the even-
ing is Louis Malle’s Zazie
(1960), a zany French comedy
about a precocious little girl
who goes to visit her uncle in
Paris where she encounters a
series of potentially shocking
social and sexual situations, but
remains unflappable.

Malle, the director of the
recently distributed Pretty
Baby, has a history of making
movies on taboo subjects which,
through his treatment, become
humanized and even accep-
table. His early movie The
Lovers (1958), with Jeanne
Moreau, helped break the
ground for a frank presentation
of sexuality in serious film.

The Film Society has selected
its next two films: Peter
Watkins’ magnificent Edvard
Munch, a movie about the life of
the Expressionist painter, and
Orson Welles’ conflation of
Shakespeare’s Henry IV and V
plays, Chimes at Midnight, in
which Welles himself plays
Falstaff.

From The Bookstore

A recent article I read on the
phenomenal success of the
Blues Brothers album, “‘Brief-
case of Blues,’’ currently the
top selling album in the coun-
try, included a dubious apology
from the music director of radio
station WNEW in New York.
Although that station was one of
the first to play the L.P., and
was largely responsible for its
pre-Christmas start in air-play,
this fellow said in looking back
that he wasn’t sure the Blues
Brothers succeess was fully
justified.

He lamented Joliet Jake and
Elwood Blues’ satire on the
form, but his feelings were mix-
ed because the musicians back-
ing up the duo are truly the best
blues combo that Warner
Brothers Records could have
assembled — lead off by Steve
Cropper on guitar. This music

director’fellow evidently felt
that these two upstart come-
dians deserve their success far
less than the real bluesmen who
have been and indeed still are,
toiling away in black alleys and
back rooms from Chicago to
New Orleans.

In my opinion the ap-
propriateness of Jake and
Elwood’s success story is a
moot point as long as their
album leads novices on to the
wealth of blues music available
on records. There are blues
recordings dating back to the
second decade of this century,
which is really remarkable. The
origins of the blues are obscure
and undocumented, but it is ac-
cepted that the form dates back
long before jazz. The blues is a
rural southern outgrowth of
slavery, originating in_ free-

Steve Abraham, junior EC
representative, disagreed. ‘‘we
just can’t give money to the
lacrosse team and not expect
other teams to come to us,”’ he
said.

Abraham added that ‘“‘this
money (the request for $1,350)
is over half the money we have

left in the EC Funding ac-

count.”

Several EC members asked
Emmer about the possibility of
refunding some of the money at
a later date.

“‘We don’t want to feel there is
a hatchet over our heads to re-
fund the monies,’’ Emmer said.
But the coach did say that he
thought it would be possible to
refund part of the money.

Calvert’s original motion to
give the lacrosse team $1,350
failed by a 4-7 vote. :

A new motion to give the team
$1,000 passed, however, 6-5.

Voting in favor of the motion
were: Calvert, Murphy, Will
Mackie, sophomore EC
representative, Charlie Scott,
freshman rep., EC president
Beau Dudley, and law school
representative Jenelle Mims.

Voting against the funding
proposal were: Keesler,
Abraham, EC secretary Tom
McCarthy, senior represen-
tative Rob. Benfield, and EC
vice president Bill Tucker.

Absent from Monday’s
meeting was Bob Willis,
sophomore EC representative.

The EC also gave $300 to the
Ring-tum Phi to help finance
the student newspaper’s Student
Housing Supplement, scheduled
to be published next week.
Tucker registered the only vote
in opposition to the funding re-
quest.

Further discussion of the

Several fraternities express-
ed concern about the mounting
number of incidents at parties
involving VMI cadets. The
Judicial Board is trying to
locate an emergency number to
call when cadets get out of

The board also decided to en-
force the present rule that

Jay Blumberg, director of
W&L’s Dance Marathon, spoke
at the meeting.

Blumberg said, ‘I would like

added, ‘‘we can’t reach our goal

Although there will be a

Blumberg made a plea for
dancers in order to make the

Of the seven houses inspected
last week, five passed and two

noted the inspection results
marked a ‘“‘significant improve-

Repercussions from the noise
ordinance problem are still be-
ing felt. A copy of the IFC’s let-
ter to city council was cir-
culated at the meeting.

Davis asked all fraternities to
submit a list of scheduled par-
ties so that Murph, W&L’s proc-
tor, can monitor the noise levels
of parties and prevent confron-
tations with the police.

Murph will issue one warning
to house, after which any warn-
ing will result in punitive action
by the IFC.

Davis also reminded frater-
nities that in order to play
amplified music, they must a

Text of Letter to City Council

 

At the outset let us thank you on behalf of the Interfraternity
Council and the student body as a whole for considering our recent
proposal regarding a change in the noise ordinance.

nance unchanged.

After presenting the matter to Council on September 21, we
were informed, quite correctly in a strictly legal sense, that any
change in the ordinance would not be in the form of a ‘compromise’,

but would instead be a change in the law as applied to everyone in

Lexington.

Gramatic decrease in the number of complaints, and more importantly
the fact that not a single summons was issued for violation of the

ordinance until this month after it became known that Council was

rejecting any change in the law.

Councilman Imeson formally announced the decision at the
Interfraternity Council meeting on January 30.
also stated that our improved conduct had played no part in the

decision of Council, which was simply that we would have to live

under the present ordinance.

the noise ordinance,”’ said Im-

eson. “It seems fair to all
elements of the community.”
Imeson arrived late at last
Tuesday’s IFC meeting where
he delivered the committee’s

verdict to the fraternity
representatives.
Saying that fraternity

members would be treated like
any other member of the com-
munity, he refuted claims of
“capricious enforcement” of the
ordinance by police. Hé added
that even though the frater-
nities showed good faith by
maintaining a record: of good

behavior, it would not
necessitate a change.

Imeson then invited unhappy
students to Council’s Thursday
meeting, which few attended.
The reaction to the decision, as
expected, was not favorable. In
response, a letter was written
and delivered to City Council
which summarized student opi-
nion about the Council’s “lack
of faith.”

The letter, addressed to the
City Council, was signed by IFC
president Jim Davis and stu-
dent body president Beau
Dudley and was read aloud by
Mayor Charles F.. Phillips.

When finished, he said that ‘‘it
is not a question of three or four
nights of civil disturbance a
week as opposed to six or seven.
There will be zero nights of civil
disturbance.”’

Phillips added that the abuse
given Imeson at the IFC
meeting was “‘uncalled for” and
that he thought an apology to
Imeson was in order. Imeson
then said, ‘‘I regret that the IFC
interpreted the ruling as it did.”

The Mayor later commented
that he invites any student to
pay taxes, vote and become a
member of the community. “If
they want to kick us all out of of-
fice, that’s fine,” said Phillips.

THE

Indoor Track Team

 

RING-TUM PHI

_ to run on Saturday

by Greg Branan

Winter track gets under way
this Saturday at Lynchburg Col-
lege’s indoor track.

“Its too early to tell,’’ was
Coach Norris Aldridge’s
response to how the team is
shaping up. He indicated that
after Saturday’s meet he would
have a better idea as to where
the team is headed. Aldridge
also noted that it is difficult to
compare this team to another
as he has not seen any others in
the ODAC conference. He did
say that the team “‘should be as
good or better than last year’s.”’

One reason for that statement
is the added depth in the weight
events, sprints, jumping events,
and hurdles. This added depth
makes these events the team’s
strong points, with the excep-
tion of the triple jump. The
General’s top jumpers were lost
to graduation. The weak events
are the distance runs. This is
due primarily to “‘lack of depth
as well as one top runner com-
ing off an illness,” according to
Aldridge.

Top returnees include two of
the team’s tri-captains, Stewart
Atkinson and Jack Norberg, in
the 60, 220 and 440 yard dashes
as well as the mile and 440 yard
relays. Also returning to the 60
and 440 relay are Jeff Brown
and Chris Leiser. Again running

This year’s schedule holds on-
ly two meets, this Saturday’s

Taking part in this Saturday’s

There were 1000-1500 delegates

Most of the discussion at the
conference centered around the
implications of the new football
‘‘Super-Conference”’ in Division
1 and the restrictions Title IX
imposes on co-ed schools. But
as far as Division III is concern-
ed, Coach McHenry was most
enthusiastic about a ruling con-
cerning finaggial aid. Effective
immediately, any schools in
Division III will have to revise
their scholarship packages so
they are consistent with the
established policy of the finan-
cial aid office for all students.

W&L splits two;
At home Feb. 10

by Bill Whalen

After a 74-72 win over Lyn-
chburg and a 75-63 loss to
Randolph-Macon, the Generals’
record now stands at 13-7 with
five regular season games to
play. In addition to these five
games, W&L will play in the
ODAC Tournament to be held at
Bridgewater on Feb. 22-24. The
winner of this tournament
automatically qualifies for the

The Lynchburg game was
probably the. most important
game of the year for W&L. As of
this writing, Lynchburg has lost
only once in ODAC play, but
still has to play Hampden-
Sydney twice. The Generals,
who have lost three ODAC
games, play three more con-
ference games and should win
them all to finish with a 7-3

financial aid budget will be set
aside for athletics, and quotas
of financial aid recipients for
athletics cannot be established.

As McHenry stated, this is the
way W&L has been operating
since 1954, when athletics were
de-emphasized, and now the
rest of the schools W&L com-
petes against will have to follow
the same rules. “‘It should be a
tremendous equalizing factor
for us,’’ McHenry said.

Before the ruling, a school
could abuse the financial aid
program fairly’ easily.
Hypothetically, W&L could
determine an athlete’s financial
need to be $2500 per year. The
school would offer, say, $1200 in
direct grant, $300 in work-study
money, and $1000 in loans.
Another school with a different
policy might offer the candidate
$1200 in direct aid, then dip into
the athletic department budget
for the other $1300, so it
amounts to a $2500 grant.

Lynchburg will meet in the
semifinals of the ODAC Tourna-
ment, with the winner more
than likely to face Hampden-

game.

The Generals’ remaining
schedule follows like this. After
tonight’s game at Emory &
Henry, the Generals are at
home on Saturday, Feb. 10
against Bridgewater. W&L
hosts Eastern Mennonite, in
their final home appearance, on
Tuesday, February 13. The
Generals end the _ regular
season on the road at Maryville
on February 17 and Oglethorpe
(Ga.) on February 19.

Washington and Lee needs to
win seven of their last eight
games (including three ODAC
Tournament games) to reach
the 20 win mark for the third
straight year.

Swimming

The Washington & Lee Swim-
ming Team will return to action
this Saturday at Warner Center
in a tri-meet against VMI and
Old Dominion University. For
the swimmers, who currently
hold a disappointing record of

Fencers spear VMI 16-11

by Bill Sherwin

The Washington and Lee fenc-
ing team took its first victory
from VMI this past weekend in
a tri-fencing meet with UVa.
The meet was held at Cocke
gym at VMI. The club dropped
its match to UVa 16-11.

Dr. James Worth stated that
the UVa team was “very
strong” but also said he was
very pleased with the per-
formance against VMI.

Standouts for W&L were
freshmen Dave Hepler and
Steve King, both of whom
posted 5-1 records in epee and
foil, respectively. In sabre,
Dave Bryant and Dave Garner
were both 3-3 overall. Once
again, Worth had special praise
for team captain Will Mackie,
who in spite of a case of
mononucleosis managed to win
two out of three bouts in foil.
“Will really did a fine job for
us,”’ said Worth. ‘‘He is a very
dedicated and talented fencer.’’

This coming Saturday, the
club faces James Madison
University in what will be its on-
ly meet to be held in the old gym

this year. The meet begins at
1:30, and if the team is vic-
torious, it will hold a .500 record
for the season.

Lax team to take

Lacrosse Coach Jack Emmer
said that the Executive Com-
mitee’s $1,000 contribution to
help defray costs for the team’s

trip to Florida is definitely a one

shot deal.

Emmer also said that every
effort will be made to pay back
the F.C. for at least part of the
money. A small admission fee
will probably be asked for at
least at the first home game,
and there will also be a per-
formance of Burr Datz and
Friends in the Cockpit on Satur-
day with proceeds from a $1
cover charge going to the

lacrosse team.

According to Emmer, the
players will be paying for their
own meals. The money that has
been raised will go to renting a

New rules for Div. III

(continued from page 9)
San Francisco, he immediately
began to politick for the
measure, and it passed the Divi-
sion III members 83-64.

McHenry also proposed that a
limited Spring Football prac-
tice be held without pads, but
this measure was soundly
defeated. Another proposal, to
limit out-of-season practice for
Water Polo, Soccer, and Wrestl-
ing, was withdrawn before the
vote.

But the financial aid rule will
be ‘‘very significant for us,”
McHenry said. The other two
divisions, by the way, cut the
number of grants for football
from 90 to 75 in Division I and
from 60 to 45 in Division II.
These moves, along with the

 

Division III ruling, will un-
doubtedly mean that better
players will be lured to the
smaller schools.

Since the rest of the Division
III members will be playing by
the same rules W&L has been
using for the last 25 years, the
level of competitiveness will un-
doubtedly increase. As

Wrestling news:
All is not well

by Chris Sisto

Last week the Generals’
wrestling team dropped their
dual meet record to 2-3 with a
loss to Liberty Baptist. On
Saturday, three W&L wrestlers
placed points in the Pembroke
State Invitational Tournament.

In Thursday’s match against
Liberty Baptist the Generals
were soundly beaten 49-0. Ed
Rogers, who lost 10-9 at 158, was
the closest the Generals could
come to victory. Coach Gary
. Franke said that the previous
tournament win the Saturday
before had a factor in the
devisive loss. “They have a
very good team and we had a
chance to win a few of the mat-
ches. But we were flat from our
tournament win and could not
get anything together.”

Saturday, the Generals went
to North Carolina to participate
in a tournament at Pembroke
State. This tournament did not
keep combined team points, so

lodgings. The team will be prac-
tising at St. Andrews School and
Boarding at the Florida Atlan-
tic University.

Saying that W&L has been a
slow starting team historically,
Emmer stated that the idea of a
trip to Florida was first thought
up by a group of parents. He
went on to say that this year br-
ings a particularly tough March
schedule, which will make
preseason practice that much
more important.

Emmer said that as far as
next year goes, ‘‘the (athletic)
budget is the avenue” to go
down in regards to funding for
another lacrosse trip. He
hastened to say that this year’s
fund raising was only a tem-
porary arrangement.

no school won the event. For the
Generals, Ray Gross won the
142 class with a 3-0 record;
Rogers finished third at 158 with
a 3-1 record and Dan Kniffen
finished fourth with a 2-2
record. The only other General
who won any matches out of the
seven who participated was Joe
Wallace who was 1-2 in the
heavyweight division. Franke
said that his players did well
but that he had hoped for a few
more individual placements.
W&L’s next match is a tri-meet
Wednesday at Hampden-
Sydney against the Tigers and
Longwood College. The match
against Sydney is a league con-
test and is very important: for
the Generals. The league starts
seeding the wrestlers for the
ODAC championships on
February 20, so it is important
for the Generals to win now in
order to earn a place there This’
weekend the Generals go to
North Carolina for matches
against Davidson on Friday and
Catawaba on Saturday. Franke
said, ‘‘we hope to improve our
dual meet record with four dual
meets in four days.’’ The next
and last home match for the
wrestlers is February 14
against James Madison.

It is our sincere hope that the students and faculty
enjoyed the quiet of the past three weeks. With the
library move completed, we almost forgot what it was
like to dodge newly-constructed fences, irascible con-
struction workers, and the like. But never fear — a
new obstacle course has been erected for our amuse-
ment, and from the looks of things it’s going to be a
part of the campus for some time.

Rest assured that this isn’t a stunt to direct more
shoppers into the Bookstore; it’s not even an attempt
to enclose Dean Atwood within the confines of
Newcomb Hall. The new fences are merely the begin-
ning of a ‘face-lift’, which will see McCormick
Library transformed into the Commerce School. And
it is our understanding that the large amount of
fenced-in space will be necessary for the construction
workers to complete the task as quickly as possible.

Bass Construction Company (who completed the
new library six months ahead of schedule) is again in
charge. They have until October, 1980, to complete the
renovation. But, by taking this large area for work
space, the C-school may be able to move into its new
quarters as early as the summer of that year. As a
result, present convenience has again been traded for
future success.

All of us support the growth of the university. Still,
it would be nice to see the fence lines moved back as
soon as possible — after all, we thought the majority
of this project was to be on the inside. In the mean-
time, we urge students to hang on to the idea of
‘‘progress’’ as they stumble about the campus. Until
some enterprising soul prints a dependable road map,
it’s about all we’re going to have in the months to
come...

If you walk past the corner of Nelson and Main, you
may see several people distributing flyers to the
passers-by. They call themselves the ‘“‘Citizens for the
Protection of Lexington,” and they are currently pro-
testing the renovation plans of the First National Ex-
change Bank. We quote their letter in the passage
below:

The First National Exchange Bank has begun demolishing the
Hopkins Building and intends to replace it with a modernistic struc-
ture. The bank plans to build a parking lot along Nelson Street, in-
stall drive-in tellers, and stick a postage-stamp size plaza at the
corner of our main intersection. Cars in the parking lot will be in
full view from Nelson Street. The drive-in tellers will create serious
traffic problems. And the plaza will attract drunks and litter. The
new building will be set back from Nelson Street, leaving the un-
sightly side of the State Theatre fully exposed...

I see more than a little wisdom in these complaints.

Letters To The Editor

Distressed reader puts
Phineas to the test

To the Editor of the Ring-Tum Phi:

I’ve been.a pretty consistent reader of the
Ring-tum Phi since I moved to Lexington; I
think it’s a good student newspaper, in-
formative and well-written. But I didn’t like
Mr. Phineas’s last column. (Before I tell you
why, though, let me say that I hope I’m not be-
ing humourless about this. Detecting irony in
a text is rarely a sure-fire thing, and if
Phineas’s remarks about— for example —
pinko poets were meant in jest, I can only
plead critical incapacity. )

I guess what disturbed me most about the
column was the tenor of Phineas’s remarks
about the Film Society. Phineas has lam-
basted the society before, and I must admit
I’m beginning to wonder whether he has per-
sonal reasons for repeatedly denouncing an
organization which has always seemed to me
a rather harmless and well-meaning one.
Surely there can be nothing terribly wrong
with occasional cultural events taking place
in, and being supported by, a university?
Phineas’s column implied that students at
Washington and Lee are uninterested in eg-
ghead movies. I hope he’s wrong — I hear, at

any rate’ that attendance at the Film Socie-
ty’s showings is running far ahead that of the
Malibu Beach series. Phineas should at least
remember that, though largely funded by the
(perfidious? ) Glasgow Fund, the society was
created by and for students.

I don’t think this is an argument over taste;
Cries and Whispers isn’t exactly my idea of a
fun time either, and Superman’s high on my
list of movies-to-see. I guess if Phineas wishes
to attack the elements of higher culture
within our midst, it’s okay by me — though I
thought his brand of anti-intellectualism went
out with the McCarthy era. I just wish he’d
sign his name to his column. No mother loves
a Sniper. And if, to borrow Phineas’s idiom,
he’s going to fill the air with cries and
whispers and moans and groans, he should
have the courage to sign his name to his or-
ribili favelle. Anonymous spite columns are
neither funny nor responsible.

Come on, Phineas! If you’re such hot stuff,
come on out of the closet. We'd like to get a
look at you.

Dear Unknown Fans:

There is a need to openly express our ap-
preciation to you for the outstanding support
you demonstrated at the Washington and Lee
Clinch Valley Basketball Game.

Knowing that you have traveled the great
distance from Miami, to attend our game, we
felt the least we could do is say thank you. We
feel privileged to know that since you have
supported such great teams as the Pittsburgh
Steelers, the Boston Celtics, and the Alabama
Crimson Tide, that we are included in this
select group.

You have given our games a new dimension
that will help us develop a home court ad-
vantage for the first time. We hope to con-
tinue to give you something to cheer about
and we also sincerely hope that the
“Unknown Fans’’ will become a W&L Basket-
ball tradition. Let it be known that any team
visiting W&L must be prepared to face the
“Unknown Fans.”

THE BASKETBALL TEAM

To The Editor:

I was terribly dismayed by last week’s ac-
tions of the Faculty Executive. Committee.
How this committee can act as it does — or
perhaps fail to act is more appropriate — is
beyond me. It seems to me that a committee
which has discussed a proposal to some ex-
tent should be able to comprehend the chang-
ing of two words. I must have greatly mis-
judged the abilities of these members of the
committee.

The grade review proposal comes at a par-
ticularily interesting point in time. Not only is
the Faculty E.C. avoiding the clarification of
present policy, it is also condoning the action
of several members of the faculty. Even the
Faculty E. C. must admit something is wrong
when a certain history professor waits until
the day of the next test to hand back the
results of the first one. ;

I urge the committee to examine the pro-
posal with a greater sense of responsibility.

Sincerely,
John Brown’79

3 WE&L Students Convicted on Drug Sale Charges

(continued from page 2)

Moorman testified that he
first bought a $35 ounce of mari-
juana from Jackson on Jan. 19,
1978, in a restroom in the
University Center.

Moorman purchased four
more ounces and an ounce of
what Jackson told him was
hashish (which later proved to
be marijuana) in Jackson’s
apartment the next day.

Jackson told the court he
thought that Moorman was “‘all
right’’ because he had been in-
troduced to him by Green.

The defendant had several
character witnesses appear on
his behalf. Among the witnesses
were Van H. Pate, director of
student financial aid at W&L,
and Gerald J. Darrell, W&L’s
director of food services.
Jackson worked for Darrell in
the dining hall for four years,
and knew Pate through finan-
cial aid counseling.

Also appearing in Jackson’s
defense was his uncle, Bill
Jackson, of Hartford, Conn.,
and James Jones, president of
Light Industries, where
Jackson has been employed

since graduation.

Defense attorney Bernard J.
Natkin said that Jackson had
stopped selling drugs and that
later attempts by Moorman to
buy more marijuana had been
unsuccessful. He asked for pro-
bation.

Read, however, argued that
the character witnesses did not
know ‘‘the other seamy side’’ of
Jackson. He argued for a
fiveyear term in the state
penitentiary and a substantial
fine. :

Judge Rudolph Bumgardner
sentenced Jackson to five years
in the penitentiary on both in-
dictments, to run concurrently.
But he suspended four and one
half years of the sentence,
ordering a six-month term in
the county jail and a five-year
probation period. Jackson will
also have to pay court costs.

Judge Bumgardner gave the
same sentence to Chris Reid,
who sold a half pound of mari-
juana to Moorman for $230 on
Jan. 26, 1978.

Reid had met Moorman in the
Cockpit when looking for
Jackson. He later found a wallet
belonging to Moorman with the
undercover agent’s real name
inside it in the Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity house, where the sale
took place.

Episcopal minister, and a fami-
ly friend from Charlottesville
testified in his behalf.

His employer at Light In-
dustries also testified as a
character witness.

The Lexington News-Gazette
reported yesterday that Reid
had tried to arrange a plea
bargain to substitute a substan-
tial fine for the jail sentence,
but Commonwealth Attorney
Read had turned down the offer.

McElroy was found guilty on
two felony charges of selling
drugs and on another felony
charge of possession with intent
to distribute.

He sold two ounces of mari-
juana to police undercover
agent Michael Countes, who
went to the ZBT house looking
for Jackson or Reid on March
22. :
Countes went to McElroy’s
apartment one week later and
bought another ounce for $35.
The agent testified that he saw
scales for weighing the drugs,
and that another person came
to buy marijuana while he was
there.

Rent Your Skis From Us

McElroy and Countes met for
the last time on May 1, when the
agent bought another ounce of
marijuana and a “Thai stick’,”’
identified himself’ and placed
McElroy under arrest.

The W&L senior testified in
court that he had been selling
marijuana for about a year and
a half when he was arrested. He
said that he had bought a $600
electric guitar and an amplifier
with the profits from his drug
sales.

Character witnesses who ap-
peared in McElroy’s behalf
were two W&L professors—Dr.
William W. Pusey, professor of
German, and Dr. David G.
Elmes, professor of
psychology—and both his
parents.

All testified that they saw “no
problem” with McElroy break-
ing the law again, and the stu-
dent himself said that he now
fully realized the serious nature
of his situation.

He, too’ will serve six months
in jail and be on probation for
five years when he graduates in
June.
