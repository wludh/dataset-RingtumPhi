Computer Down—Again

Stuart Snyder-

Washington and Lee’s newest
computer, the Harris 125 went
‘“down’’ or out of service last
Friday, Jan. 19.

This was only the beginning of
at least five days of trouble.

On Saturday, the computer
went through its regularly
scheduled programming ses-
sion 8:00 a.m. to 12 noon;
however, it remained ‘‘down’’
until two o’clock that afternoon.

According to Dr. Thomas Im-
eson, Head of the Computer

Carrel Distribution

Center, during the next four
days it was down at least five
non-scheduled ‘‘down’’  ses-
sions, including: on Sunday 9:00

- a.m. to 11:30 and 2:00 p.m. to

3:00 p.m., on Monday 1:30 p.m.
to 3:00 p.m., on Tuesday 5:30 to
6:00 p.m. and finally on
Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.

The Harris computer has
been here since the Fall of 1977.
Since then it has been burdened
by malfunctions in “‘hard-
ware,”’ the physical machinery,
and ‘‘software,”’ the tapes, pro-
grams and operating systems.

Poses Problems

by Andy Pick

The visible problem confron-
ting the new University Library
has been the acquisition of
study carrels.

Instead of a_ reservation
‘method of distributing the car-
rels, the new library uses a
first-come, first-served ap-
proach. This method has led to
the stealing of carrels, students
assembling their own carrels,
and other less than honorable
schemes in what has been term-
ed ‘‘The Great Carrel Race.”’

Many students have gone so
far as to sit around the library
and wait for the workmen to
complete a carrel, and grab it
immediately.

According to students sear-
ching for carrels, the advantage
of a carrel is to eliminate lugg-
ing an armful of books around
all day, not to mention having a

private study area.

According to Maurice Leach,
Head Librarian, the main cause
of the situation has been the in-
ability of workmen to complete
the carrels because both the
carrels and the workmen come
from Pennsylvania and have

fallen far behind schedule due -

to bad weather conditions.

Roughly one-half of the an-
ticipated 560 carrels have been
installed. The remaining car-
rels will be installed within the
next two weeks, weather per-
mitting, Leach said.

When all carrels, study
rooms, and study lounges are
completed, the new library will
be able to accomodate approx-
imately one half of Washington
and Lee’s 1600 undergraduate
student body.

If the continued use of the
first-come first-served method
of distributing the carrels
causes any major problems, the
library will possible revert back
to the sign-up procedure of the
past, Leach said.

EC Gives
Cold Check

More Power

The Executive Committee
Monday night extended the Cold
Check Committee’s power to
fine in extraordinary cir-
cumstances.

Dick Schoenfeld, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, ask
ed for the ability to fine ac-
cording to the magnitude of the
offense after his committee’s
recent experience with one stu-
dent who bounced 25 checks, but
could only be fined $10. In this
case, Schoenfeld felt that the
$10 fine would not be a sufficient

(continued.on page 20)

The Harris Corporation ser-
vice people, the ones who did
the repair work previously, are
currently trying to solve the
problem. According to Imeson,
the present problems cannot be
classified as either “‘hardware’”’
or ‘‘software.”

‘We are currently experienc-
ing more than our fair share’”’
(of problems), stated Imeson.

The Harris Corporation, as
yet, has not given an estimate of
when the computer will be
operable, stated Imeson.
However, the computer is
available for student use bet-
ween ‘‘downs.”

Last October, the Harris Cor-
poration conducted a thorough
investigation of the computer to
evaluate it and give recommen-
dations to the University.

A committee was to make a
decision on Harris’ findings and
the decision was to be made
public after the University had
chosen its course of action. Im-
eson said the results cannot be
made public at this time.

The Victims in Lexington’s

Housing Game

by Randy Smith

Mrs. Linda Gordon, 34, has lived in the
small house at 10 Henry St. for 14 years.

But she and her four children will have to
move soon because she cannot afford to pay
the rent, which will be increased from $50 to
$310 a month.

Mrs. Gordon is divorced and her only in-
come is the $335 check she receives each
month from the welfare department.

She is at a further disadvantage because
she has never had a lease to protect her living
arrangement.

Last August, the owner of the property,
Patricia B. Fox, signed a contract to sell 110
Henry St. and a lot behind 109 Henry St. to
William.’ J,’.Stearns, Washington and Lee

University’s swimming coach, the following
year. Under the contract, Stearns was to pay
her $90 a month rent for one year, after which
he would buy the property for $11,750.

The real estate contract effectively gives
Stearns control of the property, so he began
renovating the house, inside and out, even
with the Gordon family living upstairs.

Stearns began by installing a new kitchen
downstairs, rewiring the entire house, and
painting the interior and exterior.

Tuesday ke and his workmen went into the
Gordon apartment and started poking holes in
the ceiling to install a new central heating
system. Mrs. Fox was surprised.

“He said that he wasn’t going to do

anything to her apartment for a year, ‘‘ she

Alumni

Committee

to Inspect Fraternities

by John Billmyre

On Friday, March 30, a three-
member Fraternity Committee
of the Alumni Board of Direc-
tors will be on campus inspec-
ting fraternity houses.

The Committee, headed by
Bob White, will report back to
the Alumni Board of Directors
at their meeting in May. The
Alumni Board of Directors has
direct access to the Board of
Trustees.

The inspection is the result of
a long term concern by many
alumni over the deteriorating
condition of fraternity houses.
According to Dean Lewis John,
the fraternities are coming
under closer scrutiny because
some alumni fear the present
conditions of some houses could
hinder or prevent support by
alumni and adversely effect ad-
missions.

Many alumni contribute
money to fraternities on an in-
dividual basis, but the fraterni-
ty system as a whole does not
receive alumni support.

John noted that inspection of
fraternities by alumni is not un-
common, and that the Alumni
Board of Directors made a
similar move two years ago.
Several alumni from the Alum-
ni Board of Directors randomly
inspected a few houses in a
casual tour this fall.

John also pointed out that the
condition of fraternity houses
affects all aspects of university
life.

According to Dan Murphy,
Assistant Dean of Students and
advisor to the IFC, “Our pur-
pose is to insure the exterior
maintenance and safety of the
fraternities.”

Murphy also expressed a
general concern for the overall
safety of houses. He mentioned
the fire at the ZBT house two
years ago and the fire at the
PIKA house last year.

The IFC gives each house a
checklist once a month. Failure
to comply with the list results in
social probation. ‘‘As long as
people come in advance to

Appeal

Social

Probation

by John Billmyre

Two of the three fraternities
placed on social probation last
week for non-compliance with
inspection standards appealed
their cases before the Student
Affairs Committee Tuesday
afternoon.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, placed on
probation for not having
emergency telephone numbers
next to a pay phone, had its
penalty repealed. Larry
Bryand, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s
president, told the SAC ‘“‘the
phone is never used’’ and that
the phone is located in an
“obscure place.”

Pi Kappa Alpha president
Frank Ellerby also appealed his
fraternity’s case before the
committee. Pika was charged
with having 7 cracked windows,
an empty fire extinguisher, and
a littered trash area.

Ellerbe did not deny the
charges, but appealed the case
because the probation would
have started immediately, and
PIKA has already paid a down
payment for a band for this
weekend. The Committee decid-
ed to let Pika ‘have the party
this weekend ‘and’ begin their
period of probation on Sunday.

Phi Gamma, Delta was also
scheduled to appeal their proba-
tion, but president Keith Van
Lanen said FIJI only wanted to
appeal the decision so that they

could hold a party this past
weekend.

So far six houses have been
inspected and four have failed
inspection.

Sigma Phi Epsilon has passed
inspection twice.

Sigma Chi was placed on
social , probation for having
several cracked windows. Since
their probation the rule has
been changed and cracked win-
dows are no longer considered
broken unless they are unsight-

ly.

discuss the problems, we are
flexible and helpful,’’ Murphy
said. This helpful policy will
continue as long as it is not
abused, he said.

While Murphy said ‘things
are moving in the right direc-
tion,”’ he also pointed out that
there is ‘‘a great deal to be ac-
complished.”’

University
Center

Committee

by Keith Leeper

The University Center Com-
mittee held its first meeting of
the Winter term on Monday,
Jan. 15, to discuss the bands
that will be booked in the
Cockpit for the next three mon-
ths. The committee decided on
the following:

Jan. 24, Sweet Briar’s Sweet
Tones and W&L’s Southern
Comfort; Jan. 26, Glenn
Phillips Group.

Feb. 3, Willie and Gene Nin-
inger; Feb. 14, Tasty Licks.

March 17, Old Hat; March 29,
Fiction Brothers.

These suggestions were taken
before the Student Activities
Board on Sunday night, Jan. 21,
and were unanimously approv-
ed.

In addition to these bands,
Burr Datz will be putting other
special entertainment in the
Cockpit periodically. All of this
insures that next term will see
plenty of good music.

The U.C.C. has committed ap-
proximately half of its remain-
ing funds on bands for this
term. Thus, funds are available
for other bands that come up on
short notice in addition to leav-
ing an adequate amount for Spr-
ing term. Anyone who has any
suggestions concerning bands
or type of music that they would
like to see in the Cockpit is
welcome to attend the weekly
meetings on Monday nights at 7
p.m.

 

 

 

 

 

 

“GESUNDHEIT”

Colonnade Fails
Spot Inspection

by Jimmy Olson

The occupants of several
buildings at Washington and
Lee University will be placed on
social probation for failing to
meet inspection standards.

The Hill Inspection Commit-
tee, a body made up of
students; found that five of the
six buildings spot-checked did
not meet up to standards on the
fraternity inspection lists. The
HIC decided to place the
regular occupants of those
buildings on social probation for
two weeks.

Newcomb Hall was found to
have no smoke alarms and at
least 11 cracked window panes.
Therefore, all members of the
Commerce School faculty will
not be allowed to congregate in
groups of more than five for
social purposes or have girls in
the buildings.

Payne and Washington halls
also had no smoke detectors
and Payne had seven cracked
windows. Faculty and staff in
those buildings are also on.

University Receives
$1,400:'Grant From

Sears-Roebuck Foundation

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity ‘has received an
unrestricted grant of $1,400
from The Sears-Roebuck Foun-
dation as part of a program
under which. $27,388 is being
distributed this year to 25
private calleges and univer-
sities in Virginia.

The grant to W&L was an-
nounced by E. O. Huffman Jr.,
manager of the Lexington Sears
store. The foundation’s gift will
be used to help pay W&L’s
general educational operating

expenses this year, and is part
of $1.1 million the university
must raise through its annual
fund and from business, in-
dustry and foundations to meet
its budget.

“The Sears Foundation has
been — and continues to be —
one of W&L’s staunch sup-
porters in the business com-
munity,” W&L’s Farris Hot-
chkiss, director of university
development, remarked.

“Washington and Lee is

grateful for this grant for three
reasons,’’ Hotchkiss said, ‘‘-
obviously for the tangible effect
it will have on our educational
program this year, but also for
the example it sets for local

business, and for the renewed:

confidence it expresses on the
part of one of the nation’s pro-
minent corporations in the im-
portance of private higher
education as represented by
W&L and by the other indepen-
dent colleges in Virginia to
which The Sears Foundation
has awarded grants.”’

a

social probation. They are
reminded that gathering in the
gym on squash courts is in
violation of the rules.

Graham-Lees dormitory had
several cracked windows; inac-
cessible fire extinguishers, and
no emergency phone numbers
by the pay phones.

The same rules applying to
the C-school and Payne and
Washington halls apply to all
freshmen and dorm counselors
living in the old dorm.

The new library was found to
have litter around the building
and no emergency numbers
near the phones. Since the
library move was done partly to
show the students that it is
“their library,” all those par-
ticipating in the move are
hereby placed on social proba-
tion.

Reid Hall passed inspection,
as it had fire doors, a sprinkler
system, no cracked windows,
accessible fire extinguishers,
and no public phones that need-

ed emergency numbers.
Those placed on social proba-
tion can appeal _ their

punishments at the next HIC
meeting at 12 Friday night on
the footbridge.

An HIC spokesman said that
he felt that it was equitable to
put the members of the faculty
on social probation because
their buildings are not subject
to as heavy use as fraterntieis
and because the school has
about 70 workers at Buildings
and Grounds to keep the
buildings in shape.

He added, ‘‘The students are
alarmed at the deplorable con-
ditions of deterioration of the
buildings on the Hill. The
students are concerned, and
may stop giving money to the
school. We hope these inspec-
tions can bring the buildings up
out of the slum conditins they
are now in. Personally, I’m
scared to walk in the C-school

Frosh polled on career choices

Law, business and medicine
are once again the leading
career choices of Washington
and Lee University freshmen,
according to results of a survey
of entering students taken in
September under the auspices
of the American Council on
Education (ACE).

A quarter of W&L’s new
freshmen — 25.2 percent — said
they intend to become lawyers.
By way of comparison, the na-
tional average for male
freshmen at undergraduate col-
leges was only 6.5 percent.

A fifth of the freshmen — 20.3
percent — said they intend to
enter business. The national
men’s percentage was 16.0.

Medicine was named as their
career choice by 16.4 percent of
W&L’s 1978 freshmen, com-
pared with 6.4 percent national-
ly.

The statistics are taken from
survey data announced over the
‘weekend by the ACE. The
survey, which included 254

other four-year colleges across
the nation in addition to
Washington and Lee, was con-
ducted on the ACE’s behalf by
UCLA. Data were provided for
individual institutions and in
the form of nationwide
averages for comparative pur-
poses.

Law, business and medicine
have been the top career
choices among W&L freshmen
in every recent ACE survey.
This year, however.. the figure
for law dropped from _ its
customary  30-to-35-percent
level, and the percentage of
freshmen who said they were
“undecided”’ on a career rose to
16.4 percent in 1978 from the
previous year’s 11.1 percent.

The drop in law as a career
choice can likely be attributed
to widespread national publici-
ty about the glut of lawyers on
the job market in recent years,
W&L officials say. They noted
that even with the drop, the
figure for. W&L is four times the

national men’s average.

The figures for business and
medicine among Washington
and Lee freshmen this year
were virtually identical to the
W&L figures for each recent

year in previous ACE-
sponsored surveys.
Washington and Lee’s

“strong academic reputation’
was named by 86.5 percent of
the 1978 freshmen as a “‘very
important reason” in deciding
to attend W&L. Only 50.7 per-
cent nationally included that as
one of their ‘‘very important
reasons’ for choosing a college.
As usual, Washington and Lee
freshmen characterized
themselves as politically much
more conservative than their
peers at other colleges — 39.1
percent among W&L freshmen,
against 20.9 percent of male
freshmen nationally. Only 11.8
percent of W&L’s freshmen said
they regard themselves as
liberal, less than half the 23.9-
percent figure nationally.

W&L grads go to work

Data on: W&L’s 1978
graduates, also released this
week, indicate that fewer
students went immediately into
graduate school last year than
in other recent years, and that
‘more went directly into the job
market.

The W&L placement report
shows median starting salaries

for W&L graduates were up by

$1,000 this past year over the
two previous years.

The statistics were compiled
from questionnaires returned
by 251 of 301 graduates, for a
response rate of 83.4 percent.
The survey was conducted by
W&L’s Office of Career
Development and Placement.

Only a little more than a

quarter of the class of 1978 —
27.1 percent — _ entered
graduate study directly after
graduation, the report shows.
That percentage is down from
37.4 a year ago, and from 40.1
percent the year before that.

More graduates went directly
to work in 1978 than in previous
years — 62.7 percent last year,
against 56.6 percent in 1977 and
51.1 percent in 1976, according
to the report.

By late October, when the
survey was concluded, 10.2 per-
cent of W&L’s 1978 graduates
were unemployed, but the
report notes that all but two of
the unemployed survey
respondents either were. not
looking for work at all or had

Among those who went into
full-time graduate study, the
largest percentage, 12.3, were
in law school. Between 3 and 4
percent each were in business
school and medical school, and
slightly fewer than 8 percent
were in other graduate pro-
grams.

Mock Convention

by Syd Farrar

Mock Convention Chairmen
Sidney Simmons, Craig Cornett
and Dick Schoenfeld have been
interviewing candidates for the
Steering Committee and state
chairmen since Christmas
break.

There have been over 100 in-
terviews with about 40 inter-
views yet to be completed. The
interviews are necessary
because it is impossible to pick
the Steering Committee and
state chairmen just from the
applications.

Each applicant has received .

a 10-15 minute interview. Con-
vention tri-chairmen Sidney
Simmons reports that’ in
another week the interviewing
phase of the selection process
will be over.

The names of the applicants
will then be pooled and the
chairmen, considering both the
information on the applications
and the personal interviews,

will choose all the Steering
Committee members and ap-
proximately 35 of the state
chairmen.

The rest of the state chairmen
will be chosen next year from
freshman applicants and those
upperclassmen who have
developed a late interest in the
Mock Convention.

For those who fail to receive a

position, their named will be

given to the state chairman

.whose state they applied for so

that the state chairman can im-

mediately begin to recruit to fill -

the top positions in his own state
delegations.

In general, the response of the
applicants has been excellent.

There have been applicants
form every fraternity, in-
dependents and the law school.

The selections will be made
on the basis of ability. The
chairmen, however, will also
consider the need to attract a
diversity of the student body.

But Stearns did not recall the verbal agree-
ment with Mrs. Fox. Nothing about Mrs. Gor-
don and her children was included in the writ-
ten contract.

“Linda was really the only holdback keep-
ing me from selling the property,’ Mrs. Fox
said. ‘I’m sad this has happened to her. I
didn’t think he was going to go on into her
apartment. She deserves better.”’

“It costs me $40 a month to leave her
there,’’ Stearns said. ‘‘If she had gotten out or
I had forced her to get out earlier, we could
have completed the job of renovating it and
increased the rent already, which would have
helped pay for it.

‘‘She had no lease, so I can give her a 30-day
notice (to leave the premises) ,’’ Stearns said.

‘“‘Would I do that? I told her three months
ago she would have to find another place by
Jan. 15, which has obviously come and gone.

‘‘She said she had no place to stay, so I said,
O.K., if you want to stay here, you can stay
here until June,’’ Stearns explained.

They would just have to ‘‘live around the
remodeling,” Stearns told Mrs. Gordon.

“I don’t feel that there’s anything we can
do,’’ Mrs. Gordon said. ‘‘I don’t have a choice
because I don’t have anyplace to move.”’

“All the houses I’ve found that are big
enough for us to live in are $250-300 a month,”
Mrs. Gordon said, ‘‘and I can’t afford that.”

She did find a place on Houston Street that
was $160 a month, but its heating system is
electric, and Mrs. Gordon did not feel she
could afford the rent, utilities bills, and still
feed and clothe her four children on just $335 a
month.

“It’s inconvenient, there’s no question
about that, but I feel that we’re doing her a
favor because she can stay there for the same
rent,” Stearns said. ‘“‘The rent will still be $50

“Instead of paying for space heaters, she’ll
have a new central heating system,’’ Stearns
said.

‘‘When he finishes the heating system, then
I guess I’ll be heating the whole house,”’ Mrs.
Gordon, already worried about increased
heating costs.

“I'd move if I had someplace to put my fur-
niture, but you just can’t pick up and go with
four children,” Mrs. Gordon said.

Other Property

Stearns has other real estate in the Henry
Street area.

On Oct. 12, 1977, he began buying property
on the street with his purchase of 106 Henry
St. and two lots in Lexington Heights (Arpia

On Dec. 19, 1977, he bought 107 Henry St. for
$13,000. The property is now valued at $27,600
and is charged $207 a year in city property
taxes.

Stearns rents 107 Henry St. for $325 a month
plus utilities on a 12-month lease. The house is
advertised as having five bedrooms, a “‘large
storage area in the attic,” and ‘‘a large
secluded lot.”

Stearns bought 108 Henry St. on May 9, 1978,
for $22,000, although its current value, as
stated in city records, is $19,200, with a city
real estate tax rate of $144.

The W&L swim coach rents this house out
for $390 a month plus utilities on a 12-month
lease. It is advertised as having six bedrooms
and “‘a large basement with two good sized
rooms and a half bath.”’

New Property

Just this past December, Stearns purchas-
ed two more houses in the area, at 8 Henry St.
and the house next to it at 104 Randolph St. He
bought both for $25,000.

Although he is still unsure exactly how
much money he will spend on their improve-
ment, he has already computed their rental
rates for next year.

The house at 8 Henry St. will rent for $190 a
month plus utilities on a 12-month lease. The
rent for that house is currently $90 a month
excluding utilities.

The house at 104 Randolph St. will bring
Stearns $375 a month next year. The combin-
ed rent paid by the tenants presently living
there is $205 a month.

Seven people now live in the big house at 104
Randolph St.

Mr. and Mrs. Paul Price and their two
daughters live in the basement apartment.

Price has been handicapped since birth and
collects disability payments of $480 a month.
His rent is $75 a month and he pays for his own
utilities.

Stearns “did not exactly” talk to them
about raising the rent, Price said. ‘“‘He said
something about after he had gotten a little
further along in fixing the house that he might
have to go up in the rent, but he didn’t set a
price,” he said.

Their new landlord also did not speak to
them about the repairs he would do to the
house.

About the middle of January, Stearns began
to paint the hallway on the first floor. He also
tore down the porch in the front of the house,
pulling down telephone wires and knocking
over the mailbox in the process.

(Section 5-7 of the Lexington City Code re-
quires a permit to dismantle a ‘“‘structure,”’
such as a porch. Stearns had no permit.)

(continued from page 4)

The telephone wires and mailbox were not
replaced until Mrs. Martha Dale, who lives on
the second floor, notified Stearns. The re-
mains of what once was the porch can still be
seen beside the house.

“It would help if he cleaned-up the mess,”’
said Pete Sweet, who lives on the first floor
with his wife. (The Sweets pay $70 a month
rent, excluding utilities. )

“‘T asked him, ‘Do we have to move,’ and he
said, ‘No sir, I'd like for you to stay,’ “‘ Price
told the Ring-tum Phi.’’He said, ‘I’m going to
fix the place up, but I don’t know exactly what
I’m going to have to do with it. I’m going to
have to get some figures on what it’s going to
cost me’.”

‘And he said, After the place is fixed up and
I find out what it’s going to cost me, why I
may have to raise your rent some’ but he
wouldn’t say how much,”’ Price continued.

Stearns’ plans for 104 Randolph St. include
a new stone porch in the front of the house, a
new roof, and shutters.

Displacing People?

“The people who are in there now will have
first option (to rent) if they want,” Stearns
said.

“‘T assume that the people who are upstairs,
in particular, will probably not be able to pay
the increased rent, and I’ve had problems on
this because I think in my own mind, ‘Well,
am I displacing these people that don’t have
as much money as I’d like to see them have?’

‘And then I sit down and say to myself, ‘On
these particular houses there we had to pay
$25,000 on them’and we’ll be putting, I would
guess, between $10-15,000 in those, particular-
ly in 104 Randolph St.

Stearns has a

house is three different shades of white.

“So, if we add those up and I have, say,
$35,000 tied up in there, and I keep the rents at
the present level, you add up those rents and
attempt to pay off a $35,000 mortgage or get a
return on that income and you'd find you can-
not. :

“So my feeling is that if I cannot, and I try
to keep the rents the same way, then I’ve got
to take money from my own family, my wife
and child, to support people that I don’t know
at all,’’ Stearns said in an interview with the
Ring-tum Phi.

I can’t buy a piece of property like that
and leave it in those conditions, for them or
for anybody else. And for me to improve them
(the houses) the way I have to improve them,
I’ve got to charge more rent, or pay it out of
my own pocket, which I don’t have.

“T have a choice. I either don’t buy them
and leave them in the same condition they
were in, or I buy them and attempt to do
something like we're doing here—just
renovating that whole area, which I think is
going to be just a super residential area, and I
think there’s a need for it,’’ Stearns said. ‘I
just think it’s a neat area. It’s located close to
W&L, it’s near the historic area and it’s near
VMI.”’

older houses around Lexington. The houses

soon they’re going to be worthless. The people

‘Unfortunately, there are some people who
can only afford these particular houses. So we

Mrs. Brown is bitter about the rent increase
which will force her out of her present home
when her lease expires in April.

‘‘The reason he (Stearns) is getting rid of us
is so he can put students in here who will pay
that much rent,”’ she told the Ring-tum Phi.
‘“They’re the only ones who can afford it.”’

Where will she goin April?

‘‘T have nowhere to go. I have nowhere to go
because I can’t pay it. I will have to move in
with some of my children and they have
families of their own,’’ Mrs. Brown said.

‘I’ve checked around in the ads in the
paper and the rent is $150 (a month) and you
still have to pay your utilities.

‘“My income has never been substantial
enough for me to buy this place: I wouldn’t be
able to make up the payments,”’ she said.

‘*My lease is up in April, and I figure that’s
when he'll (Stearns) come in and talk to me
about going upon my rent.

‘I’ve just got $178 coming in and if he goes
up on my rent, then I’ll have to move,”’ she
said. ‘‘Or I’ll be out on the street.”’

 

Inside, the light doesn’t work and the floor

Taming’s wild history

 

Senior director Hunt Brown is
moving quickly with rehearsals
for The University Theatre’s
first production of the term —
Shakespeare’s fantasy about
courtship and marriage in
Renaissance Italy, The Taming
of The Shrew. The comedy will
be presented Friday through
Sunday, February 9-11 at 8 p.m.
in the Troubadour Theatre.

All members of the W&L
community are invited to at-
tend. Tickets are free, and
reservations may be obtained
by calling 463-9111, ext. 371.

One of Shakespeare’s earliest
comedies, Taming was compos-
ed between 1590-94. The story
centers on the bold Petruchio
(Stan Nolan), who comes to
Padua to find a rich wife — and
ends up marrying the ‘‘shrew”’
— Katharine (Maria Soltos).
Seeing in her the seeds of a fine,
compassionate wife, he pro-
ceeds to dicipline her in a
distinctive way. In essence, he
‘beats her at her own game,”
hitting servants, throwing
plates, launching into tantrums,
and so forth.

All the while, though, he
assures her that she is the lov-
ing and gentle partner. And by
the end, that very goal is reach-
ed. Unbroken in _ spirit,
Katharine has still learned to
care for others.

This play, certainly within the
realm of farce, is ‘patently
designed to be watched, not
read, full of game-playing and
visual humor. It’s perhaps the
most light-hearted of
Shakespeare’s comedies.”

And now, for a special com-
mentary on the play, the Phi is
pleased to turn this article over
to Dr. George W. Ray, W&L’s
own Shakespearian scholar...

Ibsen’s Nordic couple coldly
dissected in A Doll’s House, the

The Taming of the Shrew

The stage history of this
durable comedy has not been as
happy as Hunt’ Brown’s
welcome choice for his senior
thesis production. Early on,
many seventeenth and
eighteenth-century adaptations

- notably Lacy’s Sauny the
Seot (1667), Bullock’s and
Johnson’s identically-titled The
Cobler of Preston (1716),
Worsdale’s A Cure for a Scold
(17350, and David Garrick’s
afterpiece, Catherine and
Petruchio (1754) — established
the tradition of mangling the
Shakespeare original almost
beyond recognition (I will spare
my gentle readers the par-
ticularities of these atrocities),
a tradition which, said to say,
has continued until the present
day.

Nahum Tate’s perversion of
King Lear drove Shakespeare’s
tragedy from the boards for
over a century and a half, but it
is just as melancholy a fact to
contemplate that
Shakespeare’s Taming was not
seen on the London stage for
over 180 years after the

Restoration, until 1844 at the
Haymarket the Atlantic
in the Colonies the Garrick
alteration held sway _ until
Augustin Daly’s landmark
revival of 1887, still highly
regarded by stage historians
largely for the brilliance of Ada
Rehan’s Kate and John Drew’s
Petruchio.

I pass mercifully over the
enactments of this century, ex-
cept to note that Laurence
Olivier made his stage debut in
Taming (as Katherina) and to
observe that the impulse of
Lacy and his fellow ‘‘im-

Last year, he played the

seemed mesmerized by his
songs. He doesn’t sing, nobody
does, they just play, and their

the music is like non other; it

He’s been compared to (hold

George of Little Feat calls him
“my favorite guitarist, bar
none.”’ He is truly creative, a
master of sounds that even syn-
thesizers cannot duplicate, a fu-
sion of jazz and rock that unites
in sensational melodies, and a
creator of a new musical style.
The man is intense. See him.

Because of contractual dif-
ficulties, the Glenn Phillips
band will play in the Cockpit for

free on Friday night, show time
at 8:30 p.m. There will be a
cover charge for all non-W&L
personnel of $2.00 on Friday.
Because student organizations
could not meet his monetary
needs for two nights, a cover
charge will be asked of W & L
students on Saturday night on-
ly, and this will be $1.00; $2.00
for nen-W & L. If you attend the
show on Friday, you’ll see and
hear just how good this man is,
and will be glad to pay him $1.00
for his art.

Heart

The popularity of Heart is
without question one of the fairy
tale rock success stories of the
seventies, a surprise exceeded
perhaps only be the left-field
debut commercial success from
Boston a couple of summers
back. Heart’s first album,
Dreamboat Annie, went
platinum, and the follow-up,
Little Queen, did the same.

Magazine sold one million
copies within three weeks of its
release in April, 1978, and the
band’s latest, Dog & Butterfly,
shipped gold on release. What is
it about Heart that helps them
sell so many records (and con-
cert tickets — they‘re appear-
ing at the Roanoke Civic Center
on Wednesday, Jan. 31)?

The uniqueness of a rock
group, fronted by two women,
no doubt has a lot to do with it.
Ann Wilson, Heart’s fiery, dark-
haired lead vocalist, composes
all of the band’s music with her
blonde, younger sister Nancy.
Though Ann never had any for-
mal musical training, she learn-
ed the essentials of playing
guitar, flute, and trumpet.

Originally, Ann wanted to
write and _ illustrate poetry
books, but after opting for a
musical career, she began play-

ing with a succession of Seattle
bands until become an integral
part of Heart in 1970.

Nancy Wilson, whose musical
taste runs in a more classical
vein, initially pursued studies in
art at a private Oregon univer-

The Nighthawks have been

prison, and eventually escapes.

The first half of the movie is
interesting. The ironic cir-
cumstances of Hayes’ arrest,
the confusion and terror of both
he and the audience as his cap-
tors speak only Turkish, and the
conditions of the Turkish prison
border, are fascinating. But
flaws already appear: the ac-
ting of the Turks is, as far as I
can tell, good, but that of Hayes’
father can only be described as
stupid; and any time Hayes’
gets nervous they have his
heart thumping away loudly in
the background like Chinese
water-torcher.

As soon as Hayes fails to be
paroled and stops telling us
about Turkish prison and starts
talking about escape, the movie
plunges into the depths of
dullness. He has a five-minute
romance with a gay Swedish
prison buddy that culminates in
a shower (there’s more hot
water in Turkish prison
showers than at the R.E. Lee
Hotel!). His other two prison
buddies can best be described
as ‘drug damaged’’; and
Harvey Korman in a bad Carol
Burnett skit. The continued
over-use of Turkish becomes
annoying and confusing.

Deeper Pathos

It sinks further into the
pathetic after (follow closely
now) he’s transferred to a sec-
tion of the prison for the insane,
is visited by his girl friend who,
while visiting him in a small
visitors’ room, at his request,
unbuttons her shirt and presses
her drooping breasts against
the glass, and he escapes after
he puts on a guard uniform
after killing the warden. Pathos
becomes pathetic. At this point
he too knows Turkish so half of
the last half hour’s dialogue is
Greek to me.

I sould say that the music by
Giorgio Moroder, is the best
thing about the movie. It’s sort
of Munich rock done with
eastern instruments. I will buy

a soundtrack if I can.

I suppose the movie is a com-
mentary on the Turkish penal
system. But then again
everyone has known that their
prisons were horrible since long
before T.E. Lawrence publish-
ed Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So
it really doesn’t follow that we
should pity someone who is
caught red-handed with the
goods, knew the risks he was
taking, and received a co
aratively lenient sentence. You
get caught, you pay the price.

What bothered me most was
not only the self-flattery of the
epigram at the end of the movie
implying that because this
movie was shown at the Cannes
film festival the Turks are
negotiating a prisoner ex-
change, but also the moral con-
sequences. The Turks in
American prisons would have to
pay a higher price than the laws
at the time had required; mak-
ing an exchange, in effect, ex-
post-facto legislation.

Oh, and “shot entirely on
location in Malta’’ in case you
were wondering.

Walk into the incredible

country and r&b influenced
originals to covers of Elvis
Costello and Sam Cooke. What
all this means is that we can an-
ticipate one of the truly great
moments in Cockpit entertain-
ment when the Hawks hit Lex-
ington on February 7.

The granddaddies of the
small-scale blues renaissance
that has been building up in
America over the past five
years of so, the Nighthawks
have been either directly or in-
directly responsible for the re-
cent successes of such bands as
the Allstars and George
Thorogood and the Destroyers.

Mark Mainwaring and I were
privileged enough to see the
Nighthawks in a relatively in-
timate setting at the After Sun-
down Club in Blacksburg last
June, and I think I can speak for
Mark in saying that we were
positively overwhelmed by the
power of their stage _per-
formance (indeed, much as |
hate to say it, they made the
Allstars, who opened for them
on that particular evening, look
like rank amateurs in com-
parison).

The Nighthawks are to the
Chicago Blues what the Rolling
Stones once were to
mainstream rock’n’roll; they
do what they do better than
anyone else is doing it at this
point in time.

Recordings

As unbelievable as it may
seem, (and I know this is begin-
ning to sound at least a little bit
like a press release) their
recorded history is nearly as
brilliant as their live per-
formances. I hedge slightly
here because the one difficulty
the Nighthawks have ex-
perienced has been their inabili-
ty to transfer the power of their
live sound to vinyl.

Nonetheless, the four albums
they’ve released on Adelphi
(their first album, released on
the defunct Alladin label, is cur-
rently unavilable) have been as
varied and consistently ex-
cellent as many equivalent

provers”’ to tinker with the text
has not been often enough
resisted. Two ‘‘modern-dress”’
productions I have seen come to
mind. A VMT production in
Richmond a few years ago set
the play in New Orleans around
1900. If you envisage Petruchio
as Rhett Butler, Kate as
Scarlett O’Hara, and Biondello
and Tranio as Amos and Andy,
then you'd have loved it. As I
recall, a very busy set over-
whelmed what was left of the
text (the hack director began,
as so many before him, by cut-
ting the Induction).

The most recent travesty was
this season’s Royal
Shakespeare production
perpetrated in Shakespeare’s
own home town. The players
began by totally destroying the
set (admittedly a spectacular

 

coup de theatre) and then pro-
ceeded to wreck the play as well
by straining for every farcical
effect. The decision to double
Sly and Petruchio also obscured
the crucial equation between
Sly and Kate: that is Sly, the
tinker transformed into a lord,
is to the Hunting Lord of the In-
duction as Kate is to another
hunting aristocrat, the tutor-
tamer Petruchio. This,
however, is a Pedant’s quibble
alongside such dubious stage
business as Petruchio’s Fonzie-
like entrance on his Harley-
Davidson bike or the detonation
of the adding machine in the
dowry contest between the pan-
talone Gremio and Tranio-
Lucentio.

Fortunately, not all latter-day
directors have failed to heed the
text’s tacit warning against do-
ing ‘‘as I please.’’ I was lucky

enough in 1962 to see Michael
Langham’s luminous produc-
tion in Stratoford, Ontario (still
home of the best Shakespeare
repertory company on this con-
tinent) in which John Colicos
(better known to my children as
the “heavy” on ‘Battlestar
Galactica’) and Kate Reid
gave memorable portrayals of
the two leads.

So one out of three ain’t bad,
as the play itself suggests in the
final “‘obedience test’, and I
have high hopes of improving
my average soon. ‘‘Well, we’ll
see. Come...and let the world:
slip,” says Sly, referring to the
“pleasant comedy’? we now
happy anticipate. An easy com-
mand to obey, I hope, for at
least one out of three among
you.

guitar playing, she joined Heart
in 1974, after the band had
already achieved some regional
recognition.

Utilizing 13 years of acoustic
guitar playing experience, Nan-
cy quickly added electric
guitar, blues harp, keyboards,
and vocals to her repetoire.

Other band members include

Roger Fisher on lead guitar,
Steve Fossen on bass, Michael
Derosier on drums, and Howard
Leese on keyboards and guitar.

Odd as it may seem on the
surface, Heart has been com-
pared by many critics to Led
Zeppelin, and in fact often close
their show with the Led Zep
classic, ‘‘Rock and Roll.’”’ In
any case, the band’s combina-
tion of acoustic numbers and
ballads with straight rock’n roll
should make for an interesting
show at the Civic Center next
Wednesday.

A Taste of the Big Apple

by Parker Potter

In days of yore, Fancy Dress
was named after the exotic
costumes of its participants.
Black tie is today’s required at-
tire, so we still get fancy for
Fancy Dress. The _ best
costumes of all, though, are the
elaborate decorations of the
Student Center/Dining Hall by
the SAB. This year’s ‘‘Taste of
the Big Apple’”’ should be no ex-
ception. (To effect their magic,
the SAB will close the Student
Center Wednesday, Feb. 28, and
the Cockpit at 1 p.m. Friday,
March 2.)

After being drawn to the Stu-
dent Center/Dining Hall at the
appointed hour of 8:30 by a
searchlight, Mr. Fancy Dresser
and his date will notice the two
awnings leading to the two en-

trances, on either side of the .

dining hall. Upon entering Mr.
FD. will check his coat and find
himself in Central Park in
winter.

Underneath a dark blue
starlit sky, he will see several
leafless silver trees, lit from
below and with multitudes of
mini-white Christmas bulbs.
The park will also feature
several lamp posts and park
benches. Off on the horizon one
will see the skyline of New
York.

Plaza Hotel

Pressing onward, Mr. F.D.
will find himself in the lobby of
the Plaza Hotel, formerly the
Cockpit foyer. The lobby will be
decorated with wall sconces
and special chandeliers.

Suddenly Mr. F.D. notices an
outrigger canoe loaded to the
gunwahales with lush tropical
vegitation, hanging over the en-

trance to the Cockpit, which is
actually Trader Vic’s. Trader
Vic’s will be outfitted with tiki
candles, bamboo curtains,
authentic grass mats and a
‘“‘Let’s Go Native’’ mural
featuring tropical dancers. The
tropical rain forest effect will
be accentuated with green and
blue lights.

Shopping
District

Moving from Trader Vic’s
toward what once was Fairfax
Lounge, Mr. F.D. will pass
through the shopping district,
and Bloomingdale’s and Saks
Fifth Avenue in particular. Past

the stores Mr. F.D. will
discover Studio 54 where Fair-
fax once stood. Appearing in
this replica, authentically done
in black crepe paper, will be
Charlie Brown and his ‘“‘World
Famous Carolina Disco.”’
Charlie brings with him strobe
lights, neon display lights,
rotating mirror balls, sound ac-
tivated chase ligts, mirrored
walls, and special effects pro-
jectors.

Should the disco scene not be
exactly what Mr. Fancy
Dresser craves as his ‘“Taste of
the Big Apple” he can always
duck out to the Student Center
library, have his picture made

way.

Subway

Walking down toward the
E.C. room, Mr. F.D. will find
subway maps, advertisements,
white brick walls and big black
crayons, with which he will
leave his own graffiti on the Big
Apple.

The Village

Coming up from the subway,
Mr.F.D. finds the laid back
Greenwich Village scene
holding sway in the E.C. room.
Entertaining them will be the
Brazilian group, Minas.

Retracing his steps through
the subway Mr. F.D. can head
up the back steps where slides
of New York will be shown.
Upstairs, he will find himself on
Broadway complete’ with
authentic show posters. Down
the upstairs hallway, the magi-
cian Fabjance will be perform-
ing in the TV room.

After watching Fabjance, Mr.
F.D. can slip out and around the

R emembering Fancy Dress

“LEXINGTON, VA. —
They’re screaming bloody
murder here’ because
Washington and Lee University
has given up its Fancy Dress
Ball...

“Perhaps (one student sigh-
ed) it can be resurrected.”

The New York Times
1971

The early 1970’s were indeed
lean years for one of W&L’s
strongest traditions— the Fan-
cy Dress Ball. After decades of
popularity, students seemed
more concerned with attacking
any tradition — beloved or not.
Only a few helped keep the
flame burning. (For example,
in this period one person ran in
the W&L student elections for
Fancy Dress President, and his
campaign posters featured a
picture of a little boy and girl
holding hands. The caption was
“What Kind of World Will We
Leave Them? Help bring back
Fancy Dress.’’ The candidate
lost.)

Luckily, after three years of
banishment the student body
again began to yearn for the
lavish decorations and black
ties. The old Dance Board —
with its hierarchical traditions
— had been turned into an open
student committee, the Student
Activities Board. And from the
first year of the ‘‘restoration,”’
when the theme was Mardi
Gras, this group has outdone
itself in presenting the highlight

of the W&L social calendar.
Fancy Dress may be “big
business” now, but its origins
date from a mere 47 dollars and
an imaginative librarian.
Sometime during the 1906-07
academic year Miss Annie Jo
White, W&L’s popular librarian
and part-time drama instruc-
tor, directed a play earning that
phenomenal sum. It would be
fun, she decided, to spend it all
on an elegant dance for the
students. A “bal masque’’...a
fancy dress ball! What could be
more original? She did most of
the costume arranging and
ballroom decorating, and in-

 

vited 40 couples to participate
on the memorable night of
February 12, 1907.

The ball grew quickly. So
quickly, in fact, that by 1909, it
had to be moved from the W&L
gymnasium to the ‘‘skating rink
on Main Street”’ (?!), where it
was held for several years.
Reports in 1913 said that ‘‘the
largest assemblage of college
girls ever seen in Lexington‘ —
some 300 — attended the ball.
Accompanied, we might add, by
“three lady instructors’ who
were to be chaperones.

These early years of Bal Mas-

corner to Radio City Music
Hall, which usually sees service
as Room 114, to catch a movie.

Impatient to hit the dance
floor, Mr. F.D. and his twinkle-
toed date make for the Dining
Hall by way of the Windows of
the World, atop the World Trade
Center, located in the side din-
ing rooms. Visible on all sides
will be the skyline of New York.
As well, thousands of ‘I Love
New York’’ bumper stickers
will be taped to the walls, free
for the taking.

Waldorf

Ballroom

And finally, Mr. F.D. gazes
upon the crowning touch of the
evening. Lester Lanin and his
band playing in the ballroom of
the Waldorf. Attached to the
columns will be floor-to-ceiling
white curtains, and hanging
from each column will be a
silver chandelier. Between the
columns will hang eight 8-inch
mirror balls. Up in the gallery
will be garlands of lush tropical
vegetation (presumably the
overflow from Trader Vic’s).

Hanging behind the band will
be a painted cloth backdrop,
depicting the ‘Great White
Way,” produced by Peter Wolf
of Dallas, designer of the stage
settings for Broadway’s present
revival of The King and I.

Completing the scenario,
when the final strains of music
die out at 12:30, Mr. F.D., ex-
hausted after dancing his little
footsies off, retrieves his coat
and he and his date make for
the door. Passing through the
door, the spell is broken and Mr.
F.D. finds himself back in Big
Lex.

For Mr. F.D. and all others in
attendance, through, the SAB’s
“Taste of the Big Apple’ pro-
mises to be an evening to savor
long after Evans turns back into
a dining hall.

by Dick Barron
This year, the SAB has
selected the Lester Lanin band

 

for the Fancy Dress Ball as the
headline act. This world
renowned band will appear in
the Letitia P. Evans Dining hall
from 8:30 to 12:30 p.m. on Fri-
day, March 1. Lanin’s music
has been described as ‘‘the beat
heard round the world.”’ In-
deed, in its over 30 years,
Lanin‘s band has appeared
before every President from
Truman to Ford at inaugural
balls and other special occa-
sions. Lanin is a favorite of the
British Royal Family, and was
once given the Royal salute by
the queen Mother. Other world
officials have sought Lanin for
their banquets and debutante
balls.

A factor enhancing Lanin’s
popularity is his practice of
varying his program to suit any
occasion. This means that the
Royal Family might hear sets
of continuous music suited to
their tastes, while the slightly
less dignified guests at the Fan-
cy Dress Ball might get, shall
we say, a program suited for
just about anything.

Rock Influence

In 1956, realizing the rising in-
fluence of rock music, Lanin ad-
ded guitars to his Big Band
sound A move which proved un-
popular with the more tradi-
tional society circles. Yet, this
was in keeping with Lanin’s
desire to stay ‘‘several steps

father, founder of the first In-
ternational Orchestra, gave
Lanin much of his philosophy of
music, urging him to develop a
style that was ‘‘distinctive and’
recognizable.”

His recordings include ‘‘Les
at the Tiffany Ball,’’ which was
recorded in 1959 at the Vander-
bilt estate in Newport.

The Lester Lanin Band will
appear throughout the evening
in the ‘‘Waldorf Astoria
Ballroom” at the Fancy Dress
Ball. The Band’s cosmopolitan
flair should create the perfect
mood for this year’s New York
Theme.

Further entertainment...

In addition to the headline
performers, this year’s Fancy
Dress will feature several
smaller, but none the less, ex-
citing acts.

The E.C. Room, disguised as
Greenwich Village, — will
showcase the exciting sounds of
the Brazilian group, Minas.
Minas is a group which should
be very familiar to Washington
and Lee audiences, after their
Lexington debut last spring,
and there return engagement
last weekend.

- In the E.C. Room the Fancy
Dress goer will hear authentic
Brazilian music and its emo-
tional mixtures of flowing and

fancy freebies

In the spirit of Fancy Dress,
the SAB will make available a
number of souvenirs com-
memorating the year’s Taste of
the Big Apple.

Following the popularity of
last year’s souvenir coins, Van
Brook of Lexington, Ky.,
(minter of similar com-
memoratives for the Olympics)
has been commissioned to pro-
duce this year’s. version.
Available free at the door, this
year’s coin (pictured
elsewhere) features the skyline
of New York and the ‘‘Taste of
the Big Apple” logo on the front.
The back will bear the same
design as last year’s coins. Like
last year’s coins, this year’s will
be of a gold finish.

As well, the SAB has ordered
twice as many grain cups as
they did last year. These every

popular cups, available like last
year at three for $1, are
decorated with the New York
skyline in maroon and blue, ona
white background.

The New York State Depart-
ment of Commerce and the Port
Authority have provided for
free, several thousand “I Love
New York’’ bumper stickers
and buttons to be distributed at
various locations throughout
the Ball.

Finally, Fancy Dress posters
will be sold by the SAB.

So, even if the worst should
happen and you wake up Satur-
day morning so hung over that
you can’t remember the night
before, your sourvenir coin,
grain cup, bumper sticker, but-
ton and poster should be of
some help in piecing together
the wonders of your ‘‘Taste of
the Big Apple.”

exciting thythms. Especially
for the ball this year, one can
expect to hear the energetic
drive of Brazilian carnival
music, with its demanding per-
cussion is a special blend of
African and Latin American ex-
pressions.

Minas is known for the energy
they produce at each per-
formance, and it seems only
right that they should join in
this most festive occasion.

As mentioned elsewhere, for
our “Taste of the Big Apple,”
Fairfax Lounge will become the
noted disco, Studio 54. No disco
is complete without its raison
d’etre, as pulsing disco beat.
Our Studio 54 will be powered
by the sounds produced by
Charlie Brown and his World
Famous Carolina Disco.

Through his impressive
stereo system, Charlie sends
out a widely varied repertoire.
Beach and rock music are amp-
ly represented on Charlie’s play
list but his specialty is Funky

   

 

and Disco music. The disco
sounds of the Commodores,
Heat Wave, Donna Summer and
the Bee Gees, to name a few,
will, like Charlie’s famous light
show, bounce around our own
little Studio 54.

As if this wasn’t enough,
entertainment is planned for
Trader Vic’s in the Cockpit, as
well. Negotiations fell through
with the Charlotte Steel Drum
Symphonette, but an even more
pleasing entertainment has
been planned.

Somewhere among the lush
tropical vegetation and the
“‘Let‘s Go Native”’ mural will be
a crew of Polynesian dancers to
pleasantly accent the tropical
motif.

So if the crunch in the main
ballroom becomes too much,
the smaller alcoves of the Stu-
dent Center will provide op-
portunities to get mellow, in the
Village, to get down in the disco,
or go native with Trader Vic
and his Polynesian delights.

 

Fancy Dr
The Arabi

by Parker Potter

Fancy Dress is one of Washington and Lee’s
great traditions, often referred to as the
“premiere collegiate sSouth.”’ As steeped in
tradition as W&L tends to be, it is then a bit of
a shock to see some of the changes which have
taken place concerning Fancy Dress...

The year is 1929, the end of the roaring ’20’s,
just before the Big Crash. The week before
Fancy Dress, in an issue of the Ring-tum Phi
which praises fraternities for reducing the
amount of ‘heavy beating’’ inflicted on
“goats,” which even made padding un-
necessary in some cases(!), the upcoming
festivites are described:

Doremus Gym was the scene of the ball en-
titled “The Arabian Nights,” with music by
Ted Weems and his Victor recording or-
chestra, fresh from an engagement in Cincin-
nati at the Gibson Hotel.

Quoting: ‘The main figure will be led by
T.G. Gibson and Miss Sophia Dunlap from
Mobile, Ala., assisted by E.H. White and Mrs.
White (presumably not his mother, -ed.).
Miss Dunlap who will take the part of
Sheherazade, the cunning wife of the Sultan
Shahryar, will be brought in on a gold litter.
Four freshmen have been chosen to act as
slaves.”

Further, the 1929 article states that ‘‘Miss
Eleanor Fry will give a special dance as a
slave girl.’ One wonders...no photos of this
“‘special”’ dance itself have ever been found...

But seriously, the 1929 Phi makes this an-
nouncement: ‘‘The first figure practice was
held Wednesday night. There will be another
practice Thursday night after the basketball
game.” Practice for Fancy Dress? It only
goes to show that in some instances change
can be a good thing.

On to the ball itself. In 1929 Fancy Dress

was the climax of the ‘“‘Mid-Winter Dance
Set.”’ Another large event of the set was the
Junior Prom held the night before Fancy
Dress Ball. Like today, other smaller enter-
tainments clustered around Fancy Dress.
Among these less formal events were a dan-
sant held jointly by the Phi Gamma Delta and
Beta Theta Pi fraternities from 11 a.m. until 2
p,m. on Friday, Feb. 22, the day of Fancy
Dress. At this fete ‘‘light refreshments were
served.”” From 3-5 p.m. Phi Kappa Sigma
held an open house featuring punch. Punch
was substituted for the originally planned
libation, tea.

That night 2000 revelers in costume entered
the palace of King Shahryar of Persia,
formerly Doremus gym. Decorations for this,
and all other social functions were handled by
Mr. Carl E.L. Gill, an associate professor of
Economics and Business Administration in
the Commerce School. (Dean Atwood take
note...)

Apparently Mr. Gill had a marketable
talent because “‘other schools have tried to
secure the services of Mr. Gill in decorating
for their dances but to this time he has spent
his efforts only on Washington and Lee func-
tions.” Mr. Gill’s efforts were apparently suc-
cesful, judging by the high attendance that
night in 1929.

One of the opening events of the ball was a
preliminary figure in which Lewis Powell
(who has since found his way to the Supreme
Court) and Miss Sally Barnet portrayed im-
portant figures in the Caroline period of
American history.

The highlight of the evening was the main
figure. “The Arabian Nights” figure ap-
peared later with King Shahryar on his throne
surrounded by his court. Sultana Sheherazade

Circus Tricks

Clowns in Ringling Brothers
Barnum and Bailey Circus have
used tricks designed for them
especially by Fabjance.
Likewise, his tricks have been
used at Six Flags parks and in
the Ice Capades. Fabjance has
also been a senior assistant to
the respected magician, the
“Original Blackstone.”’

Magic Teacher

Fabjance, living in Illinois, is
noted as a teacher of magic and
manages his own magic shop in
Bethalto, Illinois.

John Fabjance — described
as “a unique entertainer— not
just another magic act’’ will ap-
pear at the Fancy Dress Ball in
the T. V. room of the student
center, hopefully mystifying
W&L gentlemen and_ their
dates, adding that magic touch
to their “‘Taste of the Big Ap-

W&L, forever fancy

que were not adorned with set
themes. A couple dressed as
George and Martha Washington
generally led that year’s
““figure.’’ Then, in 1916, the im-
mortal Reuben A. Lewis
entered the ballroom dressed as
Louis XVI. His Marie An-
toinette? Miss Annie Jo, of
course. The first theme ball,
that of Versailles, was born.
This practice has continued un-
til the present time.

By the 1930’s, Fancy Dress
was an institution of national
importance. A few of the
highlights of that time...Walter
Winchell introduces the Fancy
Dress Ball over radio in 1932, on
the Lucky Strike nationwide
network hookup...Miss Annie Jo
continues to appear, and poses
for a photo in Life in 1938...The
big bands clamor to appear,
and they all did — Benny Good-

man, Eddie Duchin, Kay Kyser
and his “college of musical
knowledge,”’ Duke Ellington,
Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey,
and more...Hundreds of girls —
from New Orleans, Atlanta,
Louisville, Charleston,
Baltimore — charter entire
railroad cars to come to Lex-
ington. It’s not hard to see, after
all this, why the “grand old
lady”’ of college weekends was
so easy to revive.

And it has done just that.
From the modest beginnings
with 1974’s Mardi Gras, the SAB
has transported us all to the sw-
ing era, Hollywood, Paris,
Egypt — and now, New York Ci-
ty. A male without black tie is
an oddity, though many costum-
ed shieks and harem girls were
seen at last year’s Egyptian
ball. Maybe this spells hope for
a restoration of Fancy Dress in

its literal sense — elaborate
costumes and all. But in any
event, it is doubtful that we will
see obituaries (such as the
following one written in 1971 by
James S. Wamsley, ’50) in the
near future:

“In its time it was fun...It
seemed in its time to have
class...It would be idiotic to ex-
pect modern collegians to find
the joy we did in a recreation of
King Arthur’s court, broadcast
live...But sometimes I wonder if
they’re having as good a time.

“And as we go down the road
to relevance together, a few of
us will wave briefly as we pass-
ed the locked and shuttered
ballroom that was Fancy
Dress.”

Idiotic? Not at all — the few
mourners have been replaced
by hundreds of new followers
for whom “‘class”’ is as vital as
ever.

was brought before the ruler on a litter borne

herself at the Sultan’s mercy as he intended to
kill her.

‘“‘Music from the composition Sheherezade

minutes.”

Fancy Dress Jazz

This year’s Phi is far from the first to print
a retrospective of Fancy Dress. The 1929 Phi
had this to say: ‘When Jazz became the
popular syncopation of Broadway the pro-
moters of Fancy Dress became exceedingly
modern and hired a negro orchestra to give
dancers a taste of the new rag-time.”’

Editorial Comments

Finally, the week after Fancy Dress an
editorial concerned with neglecting George
Washington’s birthday (another big February
event) began “Fancy Dress — Girls —
Costumes adorned with frills and fripperies —
silk and fur — satin slippers that leave tiny
heel prints in the snow — high pitched voices,
careless, joyful, music.”’

Oh for an occasionally frippery — or the
sight of the Commerce faculty hanging
streamers in the dining hall.

 

 

 

 

Though there was a concern for the neglect of George Washington’s birthday in 1929, there should be no
fear of that doday. In fact, several years ago, some generous soul made sure old George was ready for
Fancy Dress.

Delivering the main address .

at last week’s Founders’ Day —
ODK Convocation was an old
and true friend of W&L. Dr.
James G. Leyburn, who came
to the university as dean of the
College in 1947 (and remained
here as a professor until retire-
ment in 1972), appeared before
a crowded audience and spoke
on a favorite subject — the
‘‘Washington and Lee ideal.”’
The Ring-tum Phi is pleased
to reprint sections of the text of
Dr. Leyburn’s speech. He
speaks about traditional values,
yet through his words the
message is, to quote President
Huntley, ‘forever new.”

It always delights me to
return to Washington and Lee,
and I am especially happy to be
allowed a part in this Founders’
Day and ODK Assembly. W&L
has absorbed a good part of my
life and thoughts and affec-
tions; and as you will see from
my remarks, ODK expresses
many of the ideals I have long
cherished for this University.

My acquaintance’ with
Washington and Lee goes back
to my ehildhood, with my
father’s stories about his
undergraduate days here, and
with visits to Lexington, which
had long been the home of the
family. I was struck, even in
those childhood days, by what
seemed to be an _ intangible
quality that pervaded the cam-
pus, as if some indefinable

 

idea that at birth an individual
acquired a kind of attendant
spirit — they called it agenius —
which protected him through
life and which gave him the uni-
que qualities of body and mind
which he possessed. By exten-
sion, they conceived that each
of their important localities and
institutions — the Senate, for
example — had its genius loci.
This “genius of the place’’ was
compounded of its physical ap-
pearance, the distinctive im-
pression it made upon visitors
to it, but more importantly its
way of inspiring affection and
loyalty, its curious quality of
demanding that one work to
make it uniquely great.

To me, W&L has such a ,

genius loci that gives it a quali-
ty which distinguishes it from
every other university. No one
could, after five minutes on this
campus and an observations of
its students, mistake W&L for a
state university or for Notre
Dame or for Georgia Tech. It is
not merely that our campus is
different from theirs, that we
have our special traditions, that
our curriculum is our own,
thatour athletic program is not
the same.

Who can say what has gone
into the creation of the genius of
this place that makes us love it
and recognize its uniqueness?
Our “genius loci’ is compound-
ed of the beauty of the Colon-
nade under snow on a moonlit
night, of sunset behind House

longer recognize.

On the day in which ODK
honors those who have made a
distinctive contribution to the
university I suggest that
Washington and Lee’s genius
loci, like the god Janus, looks in
two directions: backward to our
great heritage, and forward to
our expectations for the future.
It is to the future that our motto
points: non incautus futuri. If
we are truly to be “‘not unmind-
ful of the future,” it might be
well to clarify our hopes for the
university. With diffidence, I
suggest two ideals I have long
cherished for Washington and
Lee.

The first of these ideals is that
of excellence — and I am sure
that all of us would
acknowledge the validty of such
an ideal for a first-rate universi-
ty like ours. But the excellence I
have in mind is of a different
quality from that ordinarily im-
plied by the word. I resort again

‘to classical antiquity.

By common consent, the
Athenians of the fifth century
B.C. reached a pinnacle of
achievement. Within q few
decades (actually only about
tWo generations) the small city
of Athens, not as large as Rich-
mond, produced such men as
Themistocles and Pericles,
Socrates and Plato, Aeschylus
and Sophocles and Euripides,
Phidias, Aristophanes, and
dozes of others whose names
ring down the centuries. How

Dr. James G. Leyburn addresses a packed Evans Hall on “the
Washington and Lee ideal.”

and the ideal had overtones and
undertones far richer than the
ordinary meaning. From the
outset, the school boy in Athens
was made to realize that it was
never enough to be pretty good;
he must strive to excel, and in
every part of his curriculum.

“Our genius loci is compounded of the beauty of the Colonnade under snow

on a moonlit night, of sunset behind House Mountain, of the Honor System,

of great teachers and their courses, of long hours in the library

boning up for tests and exams, of Fancy Dress, of victories (and defeats)

on Wilson Field and in the gym, of going down the road...”

 

spirit hovered about the place
and the people who pass
through its halls. I hasten to
remark that I am by no means a
mystic (who ever heard of a
mystical streak in a bluestock-
ing Presbyterian?). But I am
not alone in sensing this in-
definable quality of which I
speak.

In classical antiquity, that
most practical and hard-headed
of people, the Romans, held the

%.

   

 

Mountain, of the Honor System,
of great teachers and their
courses, of long hours in the
library boning up for tests and
exams, of Fancy Dress, of vic-
tories (and defeats) on Wilson
Field and in the gym, of going
down the road, of pride in
Washington and Lee’s
academic standards — indeed,
of 230 years of accumulated
tradition built up by men whose
names most of us would no

could all this happen? Not, I
think, because of some sudden
miraculous combination of
genes in its citizens, but chiefly
because the Athenians had a
clear ideal to strive for, one in-
culcated into every youth from
the moment he started to
school. The Greek word for this
ideal was arete, and the dic-
tionary blandly defines this
simply as ‘‘excellence.”’ For the
Athenians, however, the word

Now for my point; how could
all this glory come to pass
within a few decades? Not by
some transcendent miracle;
nor do I believe for a moment
that these Athenians had any
better minds than ours. I am
certain that Washington and
Lee men are quite as intelligent
as Athenians of the fifth cen-
tury, quite as quick and
capable. They made an im-

perishable name for themselves —

and for their little city because
they exercised their minds and
creative imaginations to the
fullest, not content to be merely
good in a single field. Why
should this Washington and Lee
community not become the
Athens of America? Can we
truthfully say that our
Washington and Lee ideal of ex-
cellence has so touched our
minds and hearts that every
man here feels the compulsion
to excel in many areas, to open
his mind to new ideas and seek
out knowledge about what is un-

familiar to him?
I have always felt disap-
pointed that many W&L

students so soon begin to
specialize that they miss the
riches of this University’s
superb curriculum, and that
other students seem so intent on
grades that they refuse the

challenge of difficult courses. I
believe I should say that the
besetting sin of Washington and
Lee students is their conven-
tionality of mind — their will-.
ingness to follow accustomed
paths instead of launching out
into the unknown.

I am struck by a curious
phenomenon: that there always
seem to be many more eccen-
trics on the faculty and staff
here at W&L than there are
among the students half their
age. Why should this be? We
certainly encourage incipient
scholars and financiers and
businessmen; but I think the
University would be healthier if
more students left those beaten
tracks. Oddballs are not com-
fortable for administrators and
teachers; nevertheless, I wish
students on the campus more
frequently caused some flutter-
ing in the dovecotes of the
sedate.

Or again, I know how many
honors theses are produced and
that is fine; but why does the °
University not seem to
stimulate other and less con-
ventional forms of originality
and creativity? Where are the
Washington and Lee poets and
novelists, our composers and
painters and sculptors in this
country, for example? Have we
narrowed down the ideal of
arete to make it conform to the
values of a job-getting career?

The second ideal I chierish for
Washington and Lee — and here
I draw upon the French
language of chivilry and
feudalism — is that of noblesse
oblige. It was a recognized part
of the code of a nobleman that
he must undertake obligations
for those weaker and _ less
privileged than himself. Nobili-
ty obligates! No law required
this duty: it was _ simply
understood that, in the very *
nature of things, those who have
power must protect those who
are weak, those who have
means must care for the needy,

RING-TUM PHI

Once again, W&L

loses a close one

by Bill Whalen

Any steady viewer of our
Generals should be noticing a
new trend in their games. W&L
is gradually losing its killer in-
stinct. Tuesday night’s game, in
particular, is a good example.
Of the nine games this year in
which the final margin has been
Six points or less, W&L has won
four and lost five. More im-
portantly, the Generals have
lost the last three of these
games.

This trend really started with
the Transylvania game of Jan.
13. The Generals were able to
stay within one or two points,
but every time they had a
chance to take charge, they fail-
ed to produce. This game
resulted in a one-point overtime
loss. Against Hampden-Sydney
on Jan. 16, the Generals fell
behind by as many as 16 points,
only to close to within one point
and then fold. This game ended
up in a six point loss. Finally,
against Gettysburg, W&L led by
margins of anywhere from one
to six points, only to end up los-
ing by three. These three losses
leave a serious question — why

can’t the Generals win the close
ones?

To quote Coach Verne Can-
field: ‘‘When we go up by a few
points, we fall asleep. What we
need are our experienced
players to be helping out, which
right now they aren’t.’’
Whenever the Generals are in
need of a key basket, their pat-
terned offense falls apart and
they turn into a group of one on

- one artists. On Tuesday night,

for example, when they trailed
by two points with ten seconds
left the Generals set up for one
last shot. Instead of moving the
ball, Pete Farrell took the in-
bounds pass, dribbled twice and
launched an off-balance, 23-foot
fade-away jumper — which is
not your basic high percentage
shot unless you’re a Harlem
Globetrotter.

To erase this ‘‘choke’’ label,
Canfield plans to go back to the
basics of basketball. “‘The team
must mentally play well to
win.’’ When asked how long his
team will work to get mentally
prepared, Canfield offered this:
“We'll practice until we’re
ready.”

Bowling alley - one of a dying breed

by Sam Campbell

With all the emphasis on the
more well-known traditions in
Lexington, we seem to overlook
the many unique aspects of this
town which have come to be a
way Of life for the townspeople.
The Lexington Bowling Alley is
orie of a dying breed — it is one

of a very small number of alleys
nationwide which still employs
manual pinsetters. The owners,
Mr. & Mrs. Jim Barger, say
they have heard of only one
other such alley, located on
Maryland’s Eastern Shore.

The Bargers have been runn-
ing the alley for 17 years. Mrs.

Barger usually handles the
nightly sessions, while Mr.
Barger spends a considerable
amount of time on the road with
his other job. When asked why
they haven’t replaced their
manual pinsetters with the
more-conventional electronic
machines, Mrs. Barger stated,

‘“‘why, it would cost us an arm
and a leg! The people from
Brunswick have been here
before, and they didn’t want to
stay, so we’ve kept it this way.
I’m sure that if the people with
money wanted to, they could
build an alley with all the fancy
equipment, but so far they
haven’t. Most towns this size
don’t even have analley.”’

And most of the townspeople
wouldn’t want it changed.
Leagues and, since a week or so
ago, Intramurals keep the alley
busy six nights a week. The
Men’s Duckpin League bowls
Monday nights, the I-M league
rolls on Tuesdays, the Women’s
League bowls on Thursday,s
and the Mixed Couples compete
on Sunday nights. Other nights
are filled with the other
leagues, so the Bargers are kept
plenty busy. The leagues are
sponsored by various
businesses around town, in-
cluding Southern States, FNEB,
Centel, and Hull’s_ Drive-in
Theatre.

It only costs 75* to bowl a line
at the alley, which is perhaps
the cheapest entertainment in
town. Mrs. Barger says, ‘‘they

soon be calling W&L by a dif-
ferent name. Canfield would
probably suggest something in
the line of ‘‘The Five Stooges.”
This sounds harsh, but it seems
appropriate.

Against Gettysburg, a team
that entered Warner Center
with a 2-10 record, the Generals
played like a_ group of
Strangers. As Canfield put it:
Everyone played much too in-
dividually. We didn’t come
ready to play, and it would have
been a shame if we’d won
because we deserved to lose.”’

From the start, the Generals
appeared to lack the killer in-
stinct that has come and gone
throughout the season. W&L
held leads of two and three
points throughout the first half,
but they could pull away no fur-
ther than 38-32, when Get-
tysburg scored the final four
points of the half to close within
two, 38-36.

In the opening moments of the
second half, the Generals seem-
ed to finally take control of the
game. Two Carby Hoy free
throws upped the lead to 52-47,
but once again the Bullets came
back and this time took the
lead, 63-61, with 5:05 remaining.
W&L led again at 65-63 on a Tom
Jeffries lay-up, but the
Generals could not score
another point until 1:58 remain-
ed in the game. Meanwhile,
Gettysburg ran off eight
straight points to build a 71-65
lead. This lead seemed insur-
mountable when the Bullets led
77-70 with only 44 seconds left.
Then, all hell broke loose.

Jeffries sank a short jumper
to make the score 77-72 with 35
seconds left. Then the craziest
play of the season occurred.
Gettysburg threw the ball in-
bounds and Mike Wenke fouled
Gordon Summers. In apparent
glee or sheer stupidity, the
Bullets’ Bob Venerable grabbed
the W&L basket, resulting in a
two shot technical foul. Sum-
mers missed his one and one
chance, while Wenke made both
technical foul free throws. W&L
trailed 77-74 with 0:34 remain-
ing. Because the technical oc-
curred during a dead ball situa-
tion, there was a jump ball at
midcourt. The Generals con-
trolled and took three shots
before Rob Smitherman went to
the line for two chances.
Smitherman missed one and
made one. It was now 77-75 with
25 seconds left.

Gettysburg choked on
another one and one chance,
and W&L controlled the ball
with 0:21 left. The Generals
called time out with ten seconds
left to set up for one last shot. As
Canfield explains it: ‘‘We
wanted to swing around and
take a shot with six seconds left.
We put up a 23-footer, which is
not sound basketball.’’ In a
situation where team play is
essential, the Generals panick-
ed and lost a game they should
have won.

Coach Canfield summed it up
best. ‘‘We played stupid basket-
ball. That’s stupid, stupid,
stupid...”’

Gifts from alumni put
fencing on rise at W&L

by Bill Sherwin

Thanks to a gift from VMI
fencing coach and Washington
and Lee alumnus Tad Hum-
phreys, the W&L fencing team
is looking forward to its second
season of competitive fencing
this winter.

Mr. Humphreys, a member of
the last fencing team
Washington and Lee had in 1942,
spearheaded a gift of $325.00,
together with fellow alumni Dr.
William M. Manger of New
York City, Mr. T. Haller
Jackson, (Jr.) of Shreveport,
Louisiana, and Mr. George T.
Blackburn of Henderson, North
Carolina. Thanks to the
generous support of these men,
the team was able to buy an
electric Leon Paul scoring
machine. The funds were sup-
plemented by part of the
$1200.00 which was granted to
the team by the Executive com-
mittee last year.

The team was founded in the
winter of 1977 by Dr. James
Worth, university psychologist
and present coach of the squad.
At the time, the only weapon us-
ed was the foil, and much of the
equipment used by the team
was bought by the fencers
themselves. Last year, the
team expanded to the sabre and

epee’, the other two recognized.

weapons in the sport. In 1977,
the team could only compete
against itself, since they lacked
the experience or skill
necessary to challenge other
schools.

But the team of 1978 showed
remarkable improvement, and
recorded its first official victory
last year against James
Madison University. The team
lost two matches that year to

.Dr. Worth,

VMI and George Mason Univer-
sity, both of which have very
good, experienced: teams. ‘‘The
team gained valuable ex-
perience that season,” remarks
Dr. Worth. This year we may do
very well.”

Worth has good cause for op-
timism. The team was _ for-
tunate to acquire some very
good talent in this year’s
freshman class. Dave Hepler, a
freshman from Chatham
Township, New Jersey, and
Steve King, from Akron, Ohio,
were both captains of their high
school teams and have con-
tributed heavily to the epee’ and
foil teams, respectively. In ad-
dition to these talented young
stars, the team is cultivating
tnree first year fencers in the
persons of brothers Clyde and
Fletcher Harkrader, and
freshman Colt Puryear. Dr.
Worth is really impressed with
the development of these newer
fencers. “I feel we have an ex-

-ceptional amount of new talent

this year.

The team thus far is 1-2 on the
season, having dropped mat-
ches to UVa., a team which was

ranked second last year behind
William and Mary. The score

was very close, the final score
being 15-12, and according to
“a few touches
either way could easily have

made the difference in whether ©

or not we could have beaten one
of the best teams in the state. Of
course, I was pleased with the
way we fenced against them.”’
The sabre team, led by junior
Bill Hill, actually defeated the
Sabres of UVa., a result which
pleased Worth very much. He
cited Hill as having an excellent
match and praised Dave

Garner and Dave Bryant for
their performance this year.
“Garner is a good fencer, but he
has had real problems with his
knees, which has hurt him a
bit.”

The fencers face what has to
be the most formidable
schedule of the team since its
1977 rebirth. They face the
Navy squad at VMI this Satur-
day, January 27, and on
February 3 they go against
Duke University in the Warner
Center. On the fourth of
February they take on James
Madison and William and Mary
in a triangular meet, and then
return home on the 24th to face
VPI and VMI. The last meet of
the season before the Virginia
Cup will be another home
match against the Citadel on
March 3.

Swimming now 1-4

by Tim Connors

Despite some outstanding in-
dividual performances,
Washington & ‘Lee’s swimming
team dropped a dual meet to
Towson State on Saturday.
W&L’s record stands at 1-4, and
Coach Bill Stearns is now gear-
ing his swimmers toward post-
season competition.

Junior Bob Newcomb led the
Generals against Towson State,
placing first in three events.
Newcomb won the 50-meter
freestyle, the  100-meter
freestyle, and was a member of
the winning 400-meter freestyle
relay team. Newcomb’s time in
the 50m. freestyle allowed him
to join Keith Romich as W&L’s
qualifiers for the nationals. Also
placing first for the Generals
were Junior Drew Pillsbury,
who won the 200m. backstroke
and was a member of the 400
free relay ‘team, co-captain
Chip Hoke, who won the 1000
free, and co-captain Romich,
who won the 200 butterfly.

Stearns said that although

W&l is “swimming well in-
dividuatly, we are not doing as
well as can be hoped in dual
meet competition.’’ Stearns

pointed to the fact that ‘‘schools
on our schedule who have not
been successful recently have
improved greatly this year.”

He said that rather than ‘‘taper-
ing”’ (resting) his swimmers for
dual meets, that he is having
them ‘‘swim through,’’ that is,
they are working as hard as
ever toward the goal of the state
meet for most, and the na-
tionals for Romich, Newcomb,
and others whom he expects to
qualify before the season is
through.

Stearns makes it clear that
“‘we are not conceding the rest
of the regular season’’ but that,

“at this point our main objec-
tive is to make a strong showing
in postseason competition.”
The Generals’ next meet is on
Saturday at William & Mary,
and Stearns expects ‘‘a tough
meet.”

Invitational Sat.

by Greg Branan

Ray Gross was the only.

Washington and Lee winner in
last Saturday’s The Citadel In-
vitational Meet. The Generals
placed sixth out of eight teams
overall.

Gross, who is only a junior,
defeated his first opponent 7-2,
his next by default, and in the
champion match beat his Duke
opponent 3-2. Coach Gary
Franke commented that ‘‘Gross
did a good job,” considering
“the field that was there.”

At the 167-pound weight class,
W&L got a “‘pleasant surprise,”
as Franke put it, from Dave

Stoeffel. Stoeffel finished third .

in his class winning 4-3, 14-11
and by a pin in the consolation
finals over the same opponent
who had beaten him earlier.

Ed Rodgers at 158, Tom Oxen-
dine at 177, and Dan Kniffen at
190, all won one match and lost
two. Franke seemed pleased
with the results of the meet,
saying that ‘‘we’re where we

Award named for Larson,’77

Coach Verne Canfield has an-
nounced a new basketball team
award which will be given for
the first time this March and be
an annual presentation. The
award is entitled “General of
the Year” and is awarded in the
memory of Chris Larson (W&L,
1977), a four year performer for
the basketball Generals who
was fatally injured in an
automobile accident in August.

The award is given for the
qualities which were symbolic
of Chris’ career at W&L. Each
W&L player is awarded a “‘blue
star’’ for making four or more
assists in one game, grabbing at
least seven rebounds in one
game, hitting a minimum of

three of four free throws in a
game, or being credited with
two or more recoveries, or tak-
ing two or more charges in one
game.

The sixth category is deter-
mined by practice performance

and is voted on by the teams’
senior council consisting of the
four seniors on the 1978-79 team.
After fifteen games, junior Tom ...
Jeffries leads in the number of
“blue stars,” with Mike Wenke
and Carby Hoy close behind.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK —&* MILER

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
The people
of Henry Street

There is a need for more student housing in Lex-
ington. A greater availability of housing for college
students in town would, hopefully, foster more com-
petition, which will give student tenants more clout
with landlords and might even have a beneficial ef-
fect on the rental rates that some believe are already
excessive.

But the need for more student housing must be
weighed against the cost in providing such housing.
Not only must economic factors be considered but the
human price also has to be dealt with. The people liv-
ing on Henry Street belong to the lowest economic
segment of our society. More often than not, they are
usually also the segment most ignored by our society
as a whole.

Mr. Stearns’ renovation of the Henry Street area is
undoubtedly good for the city, both economically and
cosmetically. But it behooves all of us not to forget the
human factor in the renovation seheme. To us, this
whole situation somewhat resembles a Monopoly
game—but with real property and real people. Only,
the people who are getting squeezed out of this hous-
ing game are too poor to play and their present hous-
ing situation is no passing diversion. They are the vic-
tims of the housing game and we are all responsible
for seeing that they are not hurt in the process.

Idealism is a college student’s trademark, we sup-
pose. But if newspapers do not report the plight of
these people and work in their behalf, then what are
newspapers for? Who else will stand up and help those
who do not have the resources to help themselves?
Where will the people of Henry Street go if they
already live in the lowest-cost housing available in the
city? Perhaps some people hope they will just leave
quietly without a fuss, like those before them. But
something is terribly wrong with our sense of values if
we really consider our less fortunate fellow humans
as mere pawns in our game of life. There can be no
greater service than helping your fellow man—and
that is what newspapers are all about.

Some things never change

It looks like all of you ‘‘coeduca-
tionists,’’ who have predicted doom
and destruction for the W&L admis-
sions policy for the past few years,
may just have to eat your words
again. A survey prepared by UCLA
for the American Council on Educa-
tion, shows that W&L continues to
ride a wave of popularity among
qualified high school students.

The records of this year’s
freshmen show that 65% were in the
top quarter of their high school
class, as opposed to the national
average of under 50%. In addition,
almost 70% listed W&L as their first
choice of colleges when they were
applying. This is even more gratify-
ing when one notes that the majority
of our freshmen were accepted by
three or more colleges last spring.

When you come down to it, the
ACE survey held very few surprises.
Approximately 40% of the freshmen
listed themselves as political conser-
vatives, more than twice the na-
tional average. Some 42% of their
parents earned more than $50,000
last year, while the nationwide
survey includes only 7% in that
group. The renovation of McCor-
mick isn’t starting a minute too
soon, for the growing appeal of
business is manifest in the class of

1982 — over 30% listed business as
their probable major! About the on-
ly surprising answer was to the
question: ‘‘Are you a reborn Chris-
tian?” Nearly one-fifth of the
freshmen said yes...

Socially, the W&L freshman con-
tinues to excel — for better or worse.
Survey results state that 70% of our
freshmen think that sex is OK if the
two people ‘‘like each other’’ (only
44% said this on the national scale).
Three quarters of the class has
“Stayed up all night’ (whatever that
means), well above overall stan-
dards. And the final accolade —
while 68% of the nation’s freshmen
stated that they had a marked
preference for beer, W&L freshmen
agreed to the tune of 93%...sort of
restores your faith, doesn’t it?

So, admissions officials take
heart. For another year, you have
succeeded in bringing to W&L the
students that she has traditionally
attracted. They might enjoy three to
five pitchers nightly, and as Dr.
Leyburn said recently, there may
not be many ‘“W&L poets and
novelists,” but they are an ad-
mirable group nonetheless. ‘‘Tradi-
tion’? — for all its drawbacks — con-
tinues, much to our relief, to pay off
at W&L.

Letters To The Editor

Student complains about book
theft, resales to the bookstore

Editor:

I am writing this letter out of frustration and
disappointment more than anything else. When I
entered this University, it was with the
understanding that the honor system was a
viable entity and its observance was more the
rule than the exception. When such optimism as
the Honor System is not backed up by a little
common sense and prevention, then problems
are sure to occur.

The problem which concerns and infuriates me
is that of book theft. Myself and many of my
friends have been victims of this somewhat com-
monplace practice and the number of incidents
is growing. My case is particularly maddening
because I have since located my book but there is
literally nothing I can do.

It all started in the fall semester when I, as a
naive freshman, left my Psychology book in the
cafeteria while I ate lunch. The book had my
name in it as well as my notebook. After eating,
when I came to pick it up, it was gone! The act
was obviously intentional, because whoever took
it removed my notebook and left it.

Checking the various ‘‘lost and found”’ stations
on campus produced no results.

This was the situation until the beginning of
this term when I walked into a friend’s room, and
found my book lying on his desk. Of course I was
bewildered; I never thought a friend would steal

receipt.

I then went to the bookstore and they told me
that used books are bought not by them but by a
book company and there was little they could do.
I was also infuriated by the fact that neither this
book company nor the school ask for any iden-
tification from people selling used books.

Suddenly, I painfully realized that, as three
other students on my hall have, anyone can steal
your books, keep them till the end of the term
and then resell them for a profit to the school.
When I looked at my book I also realized that it
was stolen for resale and not for use because it
was in perfectly new condition without another
name, highlighting, or marks of any kind.

When I did a little checking around, I realized
that this was no isolated incident and that there
is no way to catch the culprit. I have also sug-
gested several ways to lessen this practice with
the manager at the bookstore. One of which
should be a list of ‘‘missing’’ books, with any
identifying marks listed also, which should be
posted in the Coop.

I’m not saying that the honor system is not
working because it functions perfectly in many
instances. Even so, I think that when it is being
broken under certain circumstances, then
preventative measures should definitely be
taken. I’m mad as hell becuase now I don’t feel
that it is safe for me to put my books down, and

Librarian
Appointed

Nan Elizabeth Smith, a 1978
librarianship graduate of
Emory University in Atlanta,
has been named acquisitions
librarian in the Wilbur C. Hall
Library of Washington and Lee
University’s School of Law.

Ms. Smith, who was a library

those who rule must concern
themselves with the welfare of
those who are ruled. Because
one was well-born, one natural
ly assumed full responsibility

for the community All

No men in modern America
are more privileged than
students at Washington and
Lee. Economic background,

education, health, range of ac-
quaintance, knowledge of the
word, personal gifts, awareness
of moral imperatives all
nese advantages and more put
Washington and Lee men in a
position similar to that of the
aristocrats who lived, by the
code of noblesse oblige. Can we
then say that it is characteristic
of this University’s graduates
and students that they
automatically, and without hav-
ing to reflect on the expenditure
of time and energy and im-
agination, exert themselves for
the benefit of their com-
munities?

To return for a moment to the
great Greeks, let’s ask why

great-souled; greatness of mind
and heart; the habit of feeling
and acting worthily under all
circumstances; high-mindness ;
intrinsic nobility (note here the
implication of noblesse oblige).
The Oxford continues: ‘‘In its
earlier use the word implies
especially high courage and no-
ble steadfastness of purpose, in
its later use, high-minded
generosity..’ The was _ what
Newman had in mind when he
named the essentials a universi-
ty should instill in its students,
and put magnanimity among
them.

My hope and dream for
Washington and Lee is that
from this Tap Day forward,
from this day when we honor
those adjudged excellent
among us, your generations of
Washington and Lee men will
dedicate themselves to
magnanimity, to cultivating the
ideals of arete and noblesse
oblige. You could from this day
forward transform the Univer-
sity. Then in future years we
might all look back on this day

character and leadership of Lee
that ODK was founded on this
campus in 1914. Since its
establishment, ODK has spread
to approximately 150 colleges
and universities and has served
as a vehicle for promoting Lee’s
ideals.

Though our purpose today is
to honor campus leaders, I

 

“(.. there always seem to be many more eccentrics
on the faculty and staff here at W&L
than there are among the students half their age.”

 

Athenian youths were so eager
to live to the ideals of arete.
What did they gain? At most, in
a material way, only the crown
of a simple laurel wreath. Much
more important was_ the
awareness that one’s abilities
might bring glory to his polis,
his dear city, that would make it
shine more brilliantly than
ever. Here was something big-
ger than self to live for; and the
more honor one achieved per-
sonally, the more significant his
contribution might be to the
community.

What have you done to make
Washington and Lee a more ad-
mirable university? The first
by-law of this institution
declares that we are not a
denominational institution; but
then the by-law continues: *‘The
obligation to inculcate the
Christian ideal is hereby -af-
firmed.”’ I think I should name
as our greatest shortcoming our
failure to take that obligation
seriously. Whatever else the
Christian ideal comprehends, it
surely includes compassion,
kindness to others, service, lov-
ing one’s neighbor as oneself.
Not many students seem truly
aware of the conditions of life
beyond the campus, of the
poverty and distress and_in-
justices that exist within a mile
of this building and in
Rockbridge County; and I fear
that only a few of our 1700
students are doing anything
positive to alleviate these condi-
tions and this suffering.

There is a_ splendidly
sonorous word, beloved of
Milton and Bacon, that sums up
both the ideal of arete and that
of noblesse oblige. That word is
magnanimity. The great Oxford
Dictionary is rich in its com-
ment on the word. It means

men just before Agincourt, ‘‘We
few, we happy few, we band of
brothers...will stand a tip-toe
when this day is named!”

would like to digress for a few
moments to convey some im-
pressions I have gathered dur-
ing 6'2 years on this campus,
regarding the role which W&L
plays in promoting ODK’s
ideals and the current strength
of these ideals on campus.

As I have mentioned, ex-
emplary character is the chief
prerequisite for membership in
ODK. No tradition of this school
contributes more to developing
the character of students than
does the Honor System which
unlike any other to my
knowledge, is administered and
enforced entirely by students. I
have seen the Honor System
come under substantial
scrutiny and criticism but

because of the system’s
brilliant simplicity and resilien-
cy, it has remained strong. I
believe the University’s policy
of treating its students as
responsible adults is beneficial
to the development of character
and in harmony with ODK’s
ideals. ’
In addition, W&L continues to
stress the importance of the stu-
dent athlete. There are no pro-

fessional athletes at W&L nor:
are participants on athletic.

teams judged. by lower
academic standards than other
students or expected to achieve
athletic success at the expense
of intellectual development.
Nevertheless, W&L has not ig-
nored the importance of
athletics as has been evidenced
during my years in Lexington
by the opening of the new gym
and the construction of the new

moot court teams in recent
years, and the development of
the Law School’s oral advocacy
program in general.

The University has lagged,
perhaps, in promoting the
creative and performing arts.
The commitment to the con-
struction of a new arts center,
however, indicates that a
substantial step is about to be
made in this area and the Alpha
Circle hopes financial con-
straints will not delay its con-
struction:

I would like to conclude with
another personal remark regar-
ding the Alpha Circle’s purpose .
of promoting mutual understan-
ding and respect on campus.
When I arrived in Lexington in
1971, the Law School was located
on the Colonnade and seemed to

fields. Our athletic teams con-
tinue to compile . superior
overall records, the success of
the lacrosse team in particular
since 1971 has been astounding
and is a tribute to the Universi-
ty’s approach to athletics.

In the areas of Journalism,
Speech and the Mass Media I
also have detected progress in

the form of increassed student _

participation and interest on the
part of the University: I certain-
ly do not qualify as more than a
casual observer in this regard
and my list of. improvements
are not all inclusive, but it
seems that WLUR has come a
long way with its increased
broadcasting power and entry
into the realm of cable-T.V. The
Ring-Tum-Phi has improved
and certainly can boast more
student support and respect this
year than it had during some of
my undergraduate days. The

‘resurrection of the Ariel, the

campus ‘literary magazine, is
also note worthy as has been the
success of the Law School’s

 

be an integral part of the
University. Although construc-
tion of Lewis Hall has been a
boon to legal education ‘at
Washington and Lee, the
physical separation of the Law
and Undergraduate schools and
incidental changes have
resulted in occassional
misunderstanding and lack of
cooperation between the
students and faculties of the two
schools.

Since one of the traditional
strengths of the University has
been the closeness of the Law
School and the College, I would
like to encourage, on behalf of
ODK, understanding, flexibility
and cooperation between. these
branches of the University. A
demonstration of mutual
respect and unity at W&L would
be efforts to restore on a perma-
nent basis a single University
graduation ceremony. ODK
pledges itself to the realization
cf this goal and solicits the sup-
port of those in attendance to-
day.

Kilbourne speaks
on advertising dangers

(continued from page 1)

Via Advertising,’’ examined the
specific ways in which adver-
tisements reinforce stereotypes
and affect women’s self-
images.

“Advertising is one of the
primary socializing forces in
our society,” she said. ‘‘Adver-
tisements tell us who we are
and who we should be.”’

Her presentation was an ex-
amination of current advertis-
ing techniques that play upon
our subconscious.

“Advertising is exploitive.
Women are either portrayed as
sex objects or maticulously pet-
ty housewives. In both cases,
women are depicted as an in-
ferior class of human being,”
she said, ‘‘and advertising is the
powerful force that keeps us
trapped in these images and
roles.”

Ms. Kilbourne, who has a
B.A. degree from Wellesley Col-
lege and a M. Ed. from Boston
University. has researched for
10 years the effects of the

experienced, all at the same
time,’”’ Ms. Kilbourne said.
‘The face you want is never the
face you have.”’

Advertisers “turn a woman
completely into an object,”’ she
said, ‘‘and once you _ turn
something into an object, you
start abusing that object.”

Ms. Kilbourne said that the
image that women should be in-
nocent with that “‘little girl
look”’ has harmful effects.

“Innocence is sexier than you
think and is a powerful sexual
message,’’ she said. Ms.
Kilbourne said that 25 percent
of all rape victims are under the
age of 12, and she blamed
advertisers who present ‘‘little
girls as sex objects.”

‘‘Most women work, but
advertisers either ignore this or
come up with a new stereotype:
a woman who does everything,
super woman. She works, does
the shopping, takes care of the
children, does the housework,
and even has time to cheer up
sourpuss,’’ she said.

She also showed adver-

deterent.

(Present Cold Check policy is
that all checks bounced during
the same time period are
counted as only one offense.
Students can be fined up to $5
for their first offense, $10 for
their second offense, and $25 for
their third offense. After a stu-
dent has appeared before the
committee three times, his next
offense is automatically refer-
red to the Student Control Com-
mittee. )

“This is the type of case that
we only have once or twice a
year,”’ Schoenfeld said. He
wanted his committee to have
the discression to refer a case to
Student Control at any time, no
matter what offense.

The EC unanimously approv-
ed Schoenfeld’s request.

(All fines imposed by the Cold
Check Committee can be ap-
pealled to the EC within 72
hours. )

In other action, the EC heard
a request from W&L lacrosse
coach Jack Emmer for funds to
help pay for a trip to Florida
during the winter break for the
entire lacrosse team.

Emmer said that the training
trip, as now planned, would cost
close to $6,000. He expects to
raise $1,000 through the sale of
visors to lacrosse fans. Parents
of the players are also being
solicited for funds and Emmer
hopes they will contribute
$3-4,000. Emmer hoped the EC
would make up the difference.

After many questions and
much debate, the EC deferred
their decision and told the
lacrosse coach to come back in
a few weeks after he had a bet-
ter indication of how much
money would be raised by other
means.

Various smaller committees
also reported to the EC.

David Hamra and Douglas
Burr of the Admissions Com-
mittee told the EC that they had
had very little input this year,
primarily because of the way
the new Admissions Director,
William Hartog had reorganiz-
ed the whole admissions depart-
ment.

‘In view of the last semester,
is there any reason why your
positions whould exist?’’ Dee
Keesler, junior EC represen-
tative, asked them.

The two ad hoc student
members to the Admissions
Committee had no firm reply

Rob Calvert, senior EC rep.,
registered complaints with Syd
Farrar of the University
Athletic Committee about the
lack of room in the gym for
students to play basketball
because of varsity practices.

Farrar told him that varsity
sports get first priority in use of
the gym. Physical Education
classes get second priority, in-
termural sports are next, and
then students may use the gym.

“Dick Miller is in control,”
Farrar told the EC.
