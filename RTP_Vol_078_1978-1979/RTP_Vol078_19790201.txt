Grade Review In Trouble

Faculty EC “Waters Down” Student Grade Review Plan

by Randy Smith

Members of Washington and
Lee’s student Executive Com-
mittee are upset over what the
faculty has done to their pro-
posal for a process of grade
review.

“Their (the faculty’s) point is
that they’re being wishy-washy
with us,” said Beau Dudley, EC
president, about the grade
review policy adopted by the
faculty.

Grade review was the topic of
prolonged debate at Monday’s
EC meeting. Discussion
centered on the differences bet-
ween the student EC’s proposed
grade review and the grade
review policy approved by the
faculty in January.

In late November, the student
EC adopted a statement which
would have given students “‘the
right to review and discuss all
graded material and any factor
entering into the final grade.”
Students with a _ grievance
would then be able to get a
review of the grade with the
head of the department.

The hope was to give students

an outlet through which a stu-

dent could appeal a final grade

if he disagreed with the pro-

fessor’s evaluation of his work.
The student EC’s grade

' review proposal was sent to the

Sophomore

Four candidates will vie Mon-
day for vice-president of the
sophomore class.

Chris Gammon, Rob Willis,
Kevin Dwyer, and Bruce Moore
all submitted petitions to be
placed on next week’s ballot at
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

All four candidates received a
copy of the election rules and
regulations and each was given
a $5 spending limit for his cam-
paign.

The provision for a financial
statement was waved for Mon-
day’s election.

faculty EC for discussion and
possible approval. —

But the grade review state-
ment changed while in the
faculty EC’s hands.

The student EC’s emphasis on
student rights was dropped and
the emphasis became on sug-
gested guidelines for pro-
fessors.

Dean Edward C. Atwood,
chairman of the faculty EC, ex-
plained that the shift in em-
phasis was necessary because
the statement is to appear in the
faculty handbook, which is
oriented toward the faculty, not
students.

Both the shift in emphasis and
the wording of the statement,
which does not bind professors
to the grade reviguidelines,
were sore points with the stu-
dent EC.

“I was disappointed that the
wording was watered down to

‘it is expected that,” Bill

Tucker, EC vice-president and
one of two student represen-
tatives to the faculty EC, said of
the wording approved by the
faculty.

“Well, I think this is a non-
clever way to aviod the issue at
hand,”’ said Dudley.

“This (the faculty EC’s
policy) is just a codification of

City Council Will Not
Change Noise Ordinance ,,

by John Billmyre

A representative of Lex-
ington’s City Council told a
meeting of the Interfraternity
Council Tuesday night that the
city’s noise ordinance will not
be changed, despite a good
behavior record on the part of
fraternities.

After waiting 35 minutes for
the arrival of City Council
member Dr. Thomas C. Im-
eson, fraternity members were
informed by him that the ‘‘City
Council will not change the

 

 

The Executive Committee of the Student
Body is concerned over the existing situation
regarding grading, specifically :

A) Students have no appelate process in
which to protest their grades;

B) A student’s final evaluation might be bas-
ed upon work which he has never seen (e.g.
final exams) ;

C) Students are sometimes unaware of what
weight will be given each assignment or test
in the computation of the final grade.

With these thoughts in mind, the Executive
Committee recommends that the Faculty
adopt the following guidelines:

I) Students have the right to question any pro-
fessor concerning a grade he has received.
Any student feeling that he has been unjustly
treated has the right to bring the matter to the
attention of the Department Head. The
Department Head shall then review the grade
in question with the professor involved.

II) Students have the right to view and
discuss all graded material and any factor
entering into the final grade within a
reasonable time after receipt of that grade.
Professors shall keep final examinations for a
period of one month into the semester follow-
ing examination.

III) At the beginning of the term, the pro-
fessor should provide a course syllabus which
includes, among other things, a general
schedule of expected assignments and an ap-
proximate percentage analysis of the final
grade.

 

 

 

Faculty EC Guidelines

(approved Dec. 8;
present policy)

In response to a petition from the Executive
Committee of the Student Body, the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Faculty recom-
mends that the following statement (which
describes present practice) be inserted in the
Faculty Handbook and a copy be sent to the
Executive Committee of the Student Body.

“It is the expectation that each professor
will:

1. Provide at the beginning of the course a ten-
tative schedule of assignments and a descrip-
tion of how the final grade will be determined.

2. Be willing to discuss and review all aspects
of a student’s grade within a reasonable time
after receipt of the grade.

3. Retain throughout the next term all graded
material not returned to the student.

Any student believing that his work has
been unfairly evaluated has the right to bring
the matter to the attention of the Head of the
Department concerned. The Head of the
Department may then discuss the grade with
the professor involved; however, the final
determination of the student’s grade remains
the responsibility of the professor teaching
the course.”

noise ordinance.”

Imeson compared Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance to
noise laws in other towns such
as Charlottesville, Blacksburg,
and Harrisonburg saying,
“compared to others it is fair.”
He also said that the noise or-
dinance in Charlottesville is
more stringent. :

The ensuing conversation bet-
ween Imeson and fraternity
representatives was often
heated. .

Imeson was quick to point out
that ‘fraternity members will

be treated like any other -

member or citizen of the com-
munity,’’ and that in relation to
the noise ordinance the Council
“‘would not make any weekday
special.”

But most fraternity represen-
tatives questioned enforcement
of the present regulation and
not the possibility of a new or-
dinance. Several represen-

tatives complained that the
noise ordinance is being enforc-
ed selectively.

Imeson disputed this accusa-
tion saying that “I see no signs
of capricious enforcement.”

Imeson’s statement in sup-
port of the Lexington Police
force is a continuation from a
stance taken earlier this year
when he told the IFC in October,
“The police department’s ac-
tion is directly proportional to
the number of complaints they

receive.”

Yet many _ representatives
still disagree, and Jeff Robin-
son became so disgusted with
Imeson that he stood up and left
during the meeting saying, ‘‘Oh
hell, man, we didn’t come here
to listen to this.”’

Contacted after the meeting,
Robinson, who is Kappa Alpha’s
representative, said he
“couldn,t believe Imeson.”’

Rusher will debate on ‘The
Directions for the 1980s’’ on
Feb. 14 in Lee Chapel.

Expected topics of discussion
will be the United States’ chang-

energy crisis, the balance of
power in Europe, and other
issues expected to affect the
U.S. in the next decade.

McCarthy is best
remembered today for his

District in the 81st to the 85th
Congresses.

He became one of Min-
nesota’s senators in 1958 and
during his 12-year tenure in the
U.S. Senate was a ranking

Wednesday, January 24,
marked the revival of the once
popular Ariel Readings. Ben
Keesee, Phil Welch and Mark
Richard journeyed to Sweet
Briar to participate in a reading
sponsored by the staff of
Brambler, the Sweet Briar
literary magazine. Both poetry
and prose were read and
discussed during the two-hour
session held in the Sweet Briar
Writers’ Workshop.

Ariel editor Ben Keesee call-
ed the experience ‘‘well worth
the time.” Further, each of the
participants, felt that there
were many solid constructive
criticisms made. Keesee hopes
to continue the series of
readings with girls from
Hollins, Mary Baldwin and
Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege. .

A second significant step
taken by Keesee is the organiza-
tion of an Ariel business staff.
Business manager Bob
Bergman and other staff
members are attempting to

develop enough advertising
revenue to “‘over go”’ the expan-
sion allowed by this year’s
generous E.C. funding. Under
the proposed system, local
businesses would be patrons of
Ariel and would be listed at the
back of the magazine.

With regard to the production
end of Ariel, Keesee has two
goals. The first is a second issue
before spring vacation. The se-
cond is the formation of a real
Ariel staff to bring continuity to
Ariel’s growth. Keesee says
that ten people attended the last
Ariel meeting and that there
are others who are interested.
Says Keesee, ‘‘Now is the time
to get into the magazine.”’

He says that contributions for
the second issue “‘look good,”’
but that he is looking for draw-
ings and critical pieces.

Keesee commented, ‘I’m
very optimistic about the future
of Ariel. Through the support of
the E.C., staff members and
contributors, great steps are be-
ing made toward a complete
resurrection of Ariel.’

Rusher served for 17 months as
associate counsel to the Senate
Internal Security Subcom-
mittee from 1956 to 1957.

He is the author of many
books, including his most recent
“The Making of a New Majority
Party.” He is also a sydicated
columnist, whose column ‘‘The
Conservative Advocate’ ap-
pears three times a week in

to coast.

Rusher was presented New
York University’s School of
Law ‘Distinguished Citizen
Award”’ in 1973 declaring that
the honor was conferred “‘in

tion of the conservative view-
point.”

Independents’ Union Has
Membership Problems

by Dave Murray

The Washington and Lee
University Independents’ Union
was forced to postpone the elec-
tion of officers Monday night
when a majority of the
membership failed to show up.

Independents’ Union leader
John Schmidt blamed the

sparse turnout on a “media.

blockage.” He plans a mass
media blitz, before trying to
hold elections again a week
from today.

Monday night’s failure was
another bitter pill for Schmidt.
He organized the Union at the
beginning of the year and has
been the driving force behind it
ever since. He has seen en-
thusiasm diminish despite his
efforts.

According to Schmidt W&L
caters to the fraternities. He
pointed to the recent purchase
of housing for the infant Chi Psi
fraternity. ‘‘And I had to grovel
in front of the EC for $100 for 500
people.’’

Although a framework for an
Independent Union is-supposed
to exist at W&L, there are no
funds and there is no meeting
place for the organization.
Schmidt pried the $100 away
from the EC on the condition
that it be used for organiza-
tional purposes. He put up

posters and a large number of
independents attended the first
meeting.

A Christmas party was held
in the Cockpit and it convincted
Schmidt that he would succeed.
Of the 500 independents on cam-
pus, nearly 60 paid dues and at-
tended the party, along with a
large number of girls and some
fraternity members. Perhaps
that’s why he finds it so hard to
quit now.

“‘T hate to see all the work I’ve
done go down the tubes,’’ he
said.

A week from Thursday,
Schmidt will try one more time.
Before the 7:30 p.m. meeting in
duPont Auditorium, however,
he plans to tell as many
students as he can about the
meeting.

Spots on radio and television
are just the beginning. He says
he will also put up 100 posters on
campus. At last Monday’s
meeting Schmidt complained
that his posters had been pulled
down. “I put up 30 posters on
Thursday (before the meeting)
with four pieces of tape on each
one. Now (Monday) there’s
about four left. You think the
wind blew them down?”’

Of next week’s 100 posters,
Schmidt says, “I dare anyone to
rip down one of the posters.’’

KA’s Lease “Leaves Much To Be Desired”

 

by Mike Perry

Just as students have encountered
difficulties in the search for housing,
so fraternities have also had their
problems.

As Kappa Alpha Order president
Henry Hamilton states, ‘We are
presently leasing a house from
another fraternity, and the lease ar-
rangements leave much to be
desired.”’

The KAs rent their East Nelson
Street residence from the Psi Up-
silon Alumni Association of Virginia.

Psi Upsilon was a fraternity here
at W&L until it folded in the spring of
1975. Their fraternity house was
abandoned until the KAs began ren-
ting it in the fall of 1975, following the
reactivation of the Washington and
Lee chapter.

Hamilton explains that ““when KA
reactivated, the house was viewed
as a temporary home until a better
facility could be located and financ-
ed.”’

When the KAs contracted the ser-
vices of Henry L. Ravenhorst, a
local architect and professor of
engineering to investigate the
possibilities of purchasing and ex-
panding their present home or
building another facility, it was con-
cluded that their best option was to
purchase the house from the Psi Up-
silon Alumni Association and begin
renovating it.

The KAs then drafted a plan to
purchase and renovate the house
based up the counsel of William J.
Foresman, a local lawyer, and
Ravenhorst.

After gaining approval from the
University trustees for a loan from
the University last spring, the KA
submitted a $42,5000 bid to purchase
the house. The Psi Upsilon Alumni
Association flatly rejected the offer
claiming that they would only con-
sider the higher price of $70,000.

Although the house is valued on
the Lexington City records at
“$86,800, KA _ president Henry
Hamilton believes that the market
price of the house is actually very
close to their bid.

Make Watson, KA vice-president,
believes that the price favored by
the Psi Upsilon Alumni Association
reflects funds needed by the
Association to cover debts incurred
by the fraternity when it folded in
1975.

As Hamilton states, ‘‘Mr. Robie
(president of the Psi Upsilon Alumni
Association) told me that the $70,000
price represented the remainder of
their mortgage to the University and
outstanding debts.”’

Hamilton does not foresee any pro-

spect of obtaining a more attractive —

lease because he believes the

one-year leases, as they did last spr-
ing for the current academic year.

Watson says that most of the KAs’
objections to the existing lease stem
from the ‘problem of absentee
landlord” and that the landlord has
no knowledge of the real condition of
the house.

Under the existing lease, the KA
chapter is fully liable for all minor
repairs, such as paint, building and
property maintenance. The KAs
have already paid for a host of
repairs, many of which were made
‘to comply with I.F.C. directives.

The lease further states that the
KAs must pay one half of all major
repairs.

Last fall, the house’s water heater

broke down and had to be replaced
at a cost of $500 to the KA chapter.

When the landlord was delinquent
in his payment of his half of the
repair bill ($500), the KAs paid the
full cost of the repair work to the
local plumber. The KAs_ then
deducted this expense from rent due
the landlord and received an angry
response from Psi Upsilon Alumni
Association president Robie.

This year’s lease, which included
a $600 rent increase, now requires
that the KA chapter bear the entire
cost of any major repairs.

KA president Hamilton explains
that ‘‘already this year, we had to
pay for the priority one items re-
quired by the fraternity inspection

committee report of the Student Af-
fairs Committee.”” Hamilton adds,
“We cannot afford to pay for any
more extra expenses for capital im-
provements to the house that would
ordinarily be paid by the owner.”’

The KAs also object that the only
compensation provided for in the
lease for repairs and improvements
to the house must come in the form
of a reduction in the eventual pur-
chase price of the house. Included in
this list are only those repairs deem-
ed necessary by the landlord.

Watson maintains that the
landlord has not made any repairs
on the house (with the exception of
the hot water heater) in the last two
and one-half years.

Good eats at:

Lee’s

By Barron & Potter
Ace News Team

As inevitable as the change of
seasons is a change of manage-
ment of the restaurant on the
corner of Lee and Nelson
streets. Once the Corner Grill,
more recently and more
dismally the Good Trencher-
man, this landmark has more
recently become Lee's Corner.

Thankfully gone is the mock-
deli decor of the Good Trencher-
man. In its place one finds a
thoroughly unpretentious _at-
mosphere. This atmosphere is
created by an interesting com-
bination of modern art and
homey antiques. Particularly
intriguing is the hockey stick
placed over a back exit.

In any case, our business is
food. The menu calls the
restaurant a haven ‘‘for hearty
appetites at reasonable prices.’
Eh viola. such is the case. We
¥orged ourselves for under four
dollars each. One of us really
pigged out and had the
equivalent of two lunches for
under $4. Our repast included a
quarter-pound reast beef sand-
wich, a quarter-pound ham-
burger, and a “super dog.”

We found the roast beef sand-

wich to be generously endowed
with beef. As well, the roast
beef was of a quality rarely to
be found in a simple sandwich.
Pleasantly absent were the
large pockets of gristle com-
monly associated with a roast
beef sandwich. The super dog
was covered with everything
imaginable, including chili,
slaw, mustard, and cheese,
making it juicy and tasty in-
deed.

But what truly distinguishes
Lee’s Corner are the small
touches. Each sandwich comes
fully equipped with a hearty
pile of fresh chips and the best
dill spear this side of a New
York deli.

More reasons to see:

The status of rock and roll has
recently been a questionable
point on this campus for many
reasons: popularity of disco
and/or beach music, preoc-
cupation with other campus ac-
tivities, lack of a good FM radio
station specializing in rock, and

Corner

Another point of interest on
the menu is the soup de jour —
cur day, a rich and pleasing
chicken noodle.

Although we dined on stan-
dard luncheon fare, a dinner
menu is also available. Steak,
seafood, roast beef, and pork
chops, with choice of vegetables
are offered at generally
moderate prices (especially at-
tractive is roast beef au ju
priced at $3.50). :

Owners Roger Dyer and Jim- .

my Greene, with their good food
in a comfortable atmosphere,
make one hope that they have
better luck at this location than
their ill-fated predecessors.

Maiisical Maintiian

by Dick Barron

On the southern leg of their
winter tour of the U.S., Boston
played to a packed house in the
Roanoke Civic Center Wednes-
day, Jan. 24. Sammy Hagar’s
opening set was cut short by
several power failures, even-
tually delaying Boston’s ar-
rival. Once on stage, the
headline band kicked off the
show with ‘Rock n Roll Band,”’
followed by a virtually con-
tinuous concernt of their most
well-known material.

Boston’s performance, led by

guitarist Tom Scholz, was
technically perfect, thoroughly
rehearsed, and true to recorded
versions. Unfortunately, this
automaton approach, appealing
to the adolescent record buyer,
lacks the sponteneity and drive
which might appeal to the more
seasoned concert-goer. Bostom
simply lacks the showmanship
and stage presence so impor-
tant for live concerts. Although
the monotony was broken by a
casually introduced blues
number, one was forced to be
conclusion that, without the ad-

Fraternity Frolics

by Parker Potter
and Dick Barron

After viewing episode no. 2 of
“Delta House,’’ one can only
conclude that the series is
doomed to serving as a poorly
constructed imitation of
‘“‘Animal House.’’ The idea of a
TV spinoff from a _ popular
movie is not new, and it has
been done with some degree of
success in the past (M*A*S*H
being the most successful ex-
ample).

When ‘‘Animal House’ was
taken off the big screen and
turned into ‘Delta House,’’ one
hoped the opportunism of the
big network might create an
entertaining College Comedy.
Including four characters from
the movie (Hoover, D-Day,
Flounder, and Dean Wormer),
“Delta House’ seemed well
conceived.

But the similarity with
‘Animal House’’ ends when the
dim-witted television writers
replace the talented Lampoon
writers. Gone is the sharp edg-
ed directing and _ scripting
which kept ‘Animal House’
viewers coming back for more,

Instead, all we see is a (dare I
say it?) sophomoric atte t at
Kollege Kapers. All is lost is
this sterilized and homogenized
situation comedy. It’s sad to see
the talents of the actors wasted
on the pale skeleton of ‘Delta
House’.

Let’s hope the viewers of

America are smart enough to
remember the joys of ‘“‘Animal
House” — while placing the
bumbling ‘Delta House’’ on
double-secret probation.
Perhaps because it has no ex-
pectations to fulfill, NBC’s
“Brothers and Sisters” makes

vantages of studio mixes, many
of Boston’s songs sound
undeniably alike.

The only true surprise came
when Scholtz tripped on the
stage steps, injuring his hand.
The band was forced to play
minus guitar harmonies, seem-
ingly in control without Scholz
at the helm.

Overall, drummer Sid
Hashian, bassist Fran Sheehan,
guitarist Barry Goudreau, lead
singer Brad Delp, and master-
mind Tom Scholz combined
their powerful talents with an
impressive sound system into a
robot-perfect concert.

Nazareth fans will undoubted-
ly be pleased with No Mean Ci-
ty, but there are no pleasant
surprises in store for the rest of
us. Lead singer Dan McCafferty
shows no signs of the ssensitivi-
ty and eclecticism which made
his recent solo album _ so
delightful, while the resto f the
band seems perfectly content to
pound along in the same old
Nazareth groove. Probably the
most noteworthy things about
this release is the cover art,
which sports some of the most
disguestingly grotesque draw-

rock and roll band put on a
show, then this is the band to

Wednesday, and there will be
two shows, one at 7:30 and one
at 10 p.m. Tickets are $3 in ad-
vacne for students, $4 at the
door, which is comparable to
what they are charging in D.C.,
only you do not have to drive
there to see them. They will
receive 100% of the gate

is an excellent chance for rock
aficionados to support their

similarly like it was for the
Allstars, except that there will
be no tables in the back to allow
those who want to boogie the op-
portunity to do so. The Cockpit
will be closed Wednesday from
5:30 until 6:30 for the set-up,
and all those with tickets will be
admitted at 6:30. Those with
tickets to both shows will not
have to leave after the first
show, and those with tickets to
the second show only should
congregate in the lobby above

the Cockpit near the dining hall,
and not in the Cockpit lobby
near Carole Chappell’s office.
After the first show all those
without tickets. for the second
show will be asked to make
room for those with tickets for
the second show (or in plain
English, they’ll be asked to
leave...).

his secretary) and in the Co-Op

Brothers and Sisters

(continued from page 8)
for somewhat better video fare
than ‘‘Delta House.”

Unlike ‘‘Delta House,’’
‘Brothers and Sisters’ is set in
the present. This serves as both
an advantage and a constraint.
The pressure of vraisemblence
closes off many slapstick op-
tions exploited by ‘Delta
House.”’

By the same token, ‘“‘Brothers
and Sisters” benefits from its
placement in the present. It has
a softer feel to it than does.
“Delta House.’’ As well as a
softer, less frenzied at-
mosphere, ‘‘Brothers and

~ Sisters’ benefits from a closer

focus.

The show deals with the Pi Nu
fraternity and its sister sorori-
ty, the Gamma Delta Iota
House. The Pi Nu House is no
homogenized ‘‘Delta House.”’ Pi
Nu has a pseudo Bluto (Zipper),
a super-straight (Harlan), a
black (Ronald) and an Aill-
American  boy/quasi-Otter
All the fodder for
comic conflict exists within the
Pi Nu house.

The result of this is a more

eis

human situation comedy. A
similar virtue of “‘Brothers and

“Sisters” is the endings of the
episodes. Both episodes to date
have ended on a very whimsical
note, as opposed to the Cadillac
left hanging from a block and
tackle at the conclusion of the
first ‘Delta House.”’

High art it isn’t, but
“Brothers and Sisters” is a
pleasant diversion on a dateless
Friday night.

Student EC Hot Over Faculty Grade Review Policy

Student EC Modifications of Faculty EC
Guidelines (has yet to be approved)

 

It shall be the responsibility of each professor to:
(Substituted for ‘‘It is the expectation that each professor will:”’)

1. Provide at the beginning of the course a tentative schedule of
assignments and a description of how the final grade will be deter-
mined.

2. Be willing to discuss and review all aspects of a student’s grade
within a reasonable time after receipt of the grade.

3. Retain throughout the next term all graded material not returned
to the student.

Any student believing that his work has been unfairly evaluated
has the right to bring the matter to the attention of the Head of the
Department concerned. The Head of the Department shall
(substituted for ‘‘shall’’) then discuss the grade with the professor
involved; however, the final determination of the student’s grade
remains the responsibility of the professor teaching the course.

as far as the effort I must exert
to do a self-satisfying job, are
far greater than I ever imagin-

ed,”’ she said at Monday’s EC

meeting.

_ “I feel I must sacrifice the
pleasure of time spent on EC
matters in an effort to raise my
overall average and rank
among my classmates.

“The Executive Committee of
W&L has magnified my faith in
student government. More than
ever I believe student govern-
ment has a viable and

necessary function on any
university—especially here,”
she said.

Miss Mims has served on the
EC since her election Oct. 16.

Her resignation will not become
effective until a replacement is

elected from among the first
year law class on Feb. 12. (Peti-
tions from candidates for the
position are due to the EC Feb.
5)

“I for one am sorry Jenelle is
leaving us, but I understand the
reason for her decision,”’ said
EC president Beau Dudley, a
third year law student.

 

I must regretfully resign my
position on the Executive Com-
mittee.

Before my work on the EC
began, I knew how much time
and what type of work I would
be doing. I also thought I knew
what the demands of law school
would be.

Being on the EC has taken
neither less nor more time than
I expected. The work has been
enlightening and worthwhile of
any time it has cost me.

The demands of law school, so
far as the effort I must exert to
do a self-satisfying job, are far
greater than I ever imagined.

After talking with several
lawyers over Christmas, I
realized how much I wanted to
pursue a law career. These con-
versations also reiterated how
important grades would be in
acquiring a position with the
firms I am interested in.

On returning to W&L, I learn-
ed that my grades for the first
semester were far below those I
feel are adequate to compete
with others wanting those same
positions.

 

Text of Mims’

Resignation

More importantly, I was
disappointed personally in my
performance on exams.

While I am very appreciative
of the opportunity the first year
students have given me, I must
relinquish this position.

Grades are so much more im-
portant than I ever realized.
The grades I acquire in the next
five semesters will determine
how much of a ‘‘good start’ my
career will have.

I feel I must sacrifice the
pleasure of time spent on EC
matters in an effort to raise my
overall average and rank
among my classmates.

The Executive Committee of
W&L has magnified my faith in’
student government. More than
ever, I believe student govern-
ment has a viable and

Though my time on the EC
has been short, I can say with
confidence that the students of
Washington and Lee are
represented by conscientious
and sincere gentlemen.

representative to the faculty
EC.

Tucker’s attempts to push
through the word changes at
Tuesday’s faculty EC meeting
were unsuccessful.

“The faculty EC does not act
on issues that are brought up
verbally (in a meeting),’’ Dean
Atwood said of the faculty EC’s
decision not to discuss the stu-
dent EC’s two word changes.
“We need a written request, a
petition.”

Atwood said the changes will
be discussed next Tuesday at
the faculty EC meeting if a peti-
tion for the word change is sub-
mitted, which means that grade
review will not come before the
faculty again until March even
though the faculty meets as a

group this Monday. (The facul-

ty meets only once a month. )

A new topic cannot be brought
up in a faculty meeting, Atwood
explained; it has to be brought
up through the faculty EC first.

Generals romp79-65

by Bill Whalen

All the earmarkings for a
W&L loss were there. The
Generals trailed by ten points
two minutes into the second half
and looked to be totally routed.
It seemed that another 6:30
a.m. practice was a strong
possibility. But the Generals,
with some uncommon help from
the bench and the stands, put it
all together to roll to a 79-65 vic-
tory over Clinch Valley Tues-
day night at Warner Center.

Throughout the first half of
this contest, W&L was over-
whelmed by torrid Cavalier
shooting (67% in the first
period). The leader of this
streak was Steve Moore, whose
12 points paced Clinch Valley to
a 41-35 lead. Carby Hoy scored
11 of his 17 points while Tom
Jeffries added 9 of his game-
high 24 points to keep the score
close.

While Clinch Valley controll-
ed the first half, W&L
dominated the second period.
The Generals, who had shot on-
ly 40% in the opening period, hit
on 68% of their shots in the se-
cond half while outscoring
Clinch Valley 44-24. They key
moment in the game came
when the Generals trailed 45-35
with 18:04 to play. Using five
points from Jeffries, W&L ran
off a 9-2 streak to cut the lead to
47-44. Then, Coach Verne Can-
field put Jim Berlin in, and Dr.
Ewe responded with six points
as W&L went ahead 54-53. From
this point, the Generals
gradually pulled away from
Clinch Valley, as they made
good on their final six one and
one chance to win by 14; 79-65.

Despite the sloppy first half
performance, Canfield was
pleased with the overall play.
“It was a super comeback—it
took a lot of guts,” said the
Coach. ‘‘We made some key
recoveries, but they hurt
themselves by going into the
four corners.’’ The coach was
also pleased with the per-
formance of R.J. Scaggs. R.J.
made four recoveries and had
three charges—he played a nice
game.”

The Generals next game is
tonight against Lynchburg.
This is a key ODAC game and
should go a long way in deter-
mining positions in the ODAC

Tournament. ‘‘We’ll do very
well,’’ said a confident Canfield.
“It’s always a treat or a treat-
ment playing there, but we’re
prepared.”

The unknown fans are shown here cheering the Gene

The Unknown Fans:
Finally- Real Fans

by Bill Whalen

A funny thing happened at
Warner Center this week. It was
noisy. Usually any type of
cheering at a W&L basketball
game ends with the playing of
The Star Spangled Banner —
which is exactly when the
Unknown Fans entered the
arena on Tuesday night.

As they walked on the floor,
everyone wondered who these
promulgators of harrassment
were. To begin with, they are

rals to an impressive 79-65 win over Clinch Valley.

basketball fans are not. The
Unknown Fans cheer with the
same intensity whether their
team is ten points ahead or ten
points behind. They openly
harass the officials and the
visiting team. In other words,
they make the game exciting,
which is a big switch from the
mausoleum-like atmosphere of
recent games.

There were approximately 20

basic tan model to such lux-
urious items like the ‘Zebra
Bag” or “The Game Is In The
Bag”. Assembled in their
private section of the stands,
the Unknows Fans’ antics rang-
ed anywhere from placing
group whammies on the Clinch
Valley bench to harassing
Clinch Valley free-throw
shooters with more hexes or
turkey globbles.

But why did this group appear
at ‘Tuesday night’s game? As
one Unknown Fan explained:
“Alabama needed help in the
Sugar Bow]; the Steelers need-
ed help in the Super Bowl, and
W&L needs help at home. We
got a call from a student here
who said that W&L had played
an exciting game against Get-
tysburg, and the fans just sat on
their hands during the game.
Now we will stay here through
the rest of this season and pro-
bably through lacrosse, until we
have done our job.”

One person who could not be
happier is Coach Verne Can-
field. As he stated after the 14
point victory: “I cannot com-
mend them enough. This is the
best support we have had in 15
years. I thought they were
fighting a losing battle with the
rest of the crowd, but they were
incredible. They were certainly
a factor in our win.”

Whatever your personal opi-
nion of these fans may be — one
thing can be honestly said. They
may be rude, loud and obnox-
ious, but they add a lot of excite-
ment to a sport that has been
badly ignored at W&L.

For most of us the month of
February is nothing more than
Fancy Dress, Winter Break,
and a Satisfying feeling that one
month of Winter Term is finish-
ed. For lacrosse Coach Jack
Emmer and the entire
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team, however, February
signals the beginning of intense
preparation for the quickly ap-'
proaching lacrosse season.
Many see this as an important
year for the W&L lacrosse pro-
gram. Although the Generals
have reached the post-season
NCAA tournament for seven
consecutive years, last year’s
ninth place finish in the national
rankings was the team’s worst
showing under head coach Em-
mer. The Ring-tum Phi had the

opportunity to visit with Coach
Emmer this week and discuss
his assessment of this year’s
team.

One advantage of this year’s
team, according to Emmer, is
the number of returning let-
termen. Tri-captains Jeff Fritz,
John Black and Sandy
McDonald along with seventeen
other returnees give the 1979
squad the strongest nucleus of
experienced players which Em-
mer has enjoyed in recent
years. The experience of these
players will go a long way in
determining the success of the
Generals this year. Emmer
cites the many strengths of the
team which are a direct result
of the returning lettermen.
First, the attack positions will
be filled by returning All-
Americans Fritz and Black,
who along with junior Jay
Foster, combined for 14 goals
and 49 assists last year. Having
played together for an entire
season, the trio will be expected
to provide a great deal of the of-
fense for the Generals. Emmer,
however, is quick to say that he
will not be orienting the offense
around these three because of
the return of virtually all of last
year’s midfielders. Midfield has
traditionally been a weak spot

for the Generals but not so this
year, according to the coach.
Along with seniors Sandy
McDonald and Dirk Preper,
Emmer will have juniors
Roman Kupecky, Jerry Broc-
coli, Joe Olive, John Hooper and
sophomores George Santos,
Geoff Brent and John Kemp, all
of whom have at least a year of
* experience under their belts.

One area which Emmer feels
is the key to the success of this
year’s team is at the goalie posi-
tion. The coach says lack of
talent at other positions can be
covered but a good goalie is a
necessity. He sees the Generals
as being fortunate in having an
excellent tender in junior Bob
Clements. Having played
behind graduated All-American
Charlie Brown for two years,
Clements appears to be ready to
step in and do a job for the
team. Emmer cites not only the
ability and confidence of the
junior as being important but
also his leadership. Althought
he’s not as flashy as Brown was,
Clements is a solid, fundamen-
tal goalie. If he plays the kind of
lacrosse he’s capable of, there
may be many frustrated at-
tackmen come the end of May.
Behind Clements, however, the
question marks are raised.

Junior Rob Willis will be return-
ing but has yet to be tested. Em-
mer feels this inexperience may
be a hindrance, but sees Willis
as a hard worker who will get
the job done.

The defensive position ex-
poses one of the weaknesses of
the Generals — lack of quality
depth. Returning are junior
Steven Johnson and sophomore
sensation, Jim Herbert, but the
experience ends there. Emmer
sees defense as critical due to
the new ‘“‘no face-off”’ rule being
introduced this season. The rule
simply allows face-offs at the
beginning of each period rather
than, after every goal. After a
goal‘is scored, the team that
was scored upon will receive
the ball at midfield. This will re-
quire the defending team to
have their six best defensemen
on the field which, according to
Emmer, may pose a problem.
The new rule change should

Grapplers now 2-2

by Chris Sisto

The past week has been very
profitable for the Generals
wrestling team as they defeated
Lynchburg 29-17 in dual meet
play and captured the cham-
pionship of the First Annual
Washington and Lee College In-
vitational.

Thursday’s match against
Lynchburg was supposed to be
the only real competition to the
Generals for the ODAC cham-
pionship. However, the
coaching ability of Coach
Franke proved to be too much
of a match. When he saw Lyn-
chburg’s line-up, Coach Franke
switched several players of his
own to higher weights. ‘‘I
wanted to put Ed Rodgers at 167
to counter a talented player that
Lynchburg had at that weight
and to put a freshman at 158.”
Dan Kniffer, at his usual 190
weight, clinched the General
victory with a pin at 2:42.

The surprise of the week,
1owever, came when the
xenerals clinched the cham-
dionship of one of their tour-
iaments for the first time ever.

“I was really surprised to win
his,”’ Franke said. ‘‘I didn’t ex-

pect this at all.’’ Franke had all
seven of the players he placed
in the tournament receive
points. Two were champions.
Mike McFadden, a freshman
was at 150 and Ed Rodgers was
at 158. Three Generals finished
second, Ray Gross at 142, Dave
Stoeffel at 167 and Tom Oxen-
dine at 177. Kniffen finished
third at 190. Those placements
gave the Generals 67.25 points
an eight and a half point win
over the seven team field.

Franke was also pleased with
his wrestlers’ play. “I didn’t ex-
pect the kids to do so well.
Everyone really produced and
got tournament points.”’

The Generals’ dual meet
record is 2-2 so far and Coach
Franke expects them to do well
in ODAC play, of which the
Generals are _ undefeated.
Franke didn’t express much
concern for the rest of the dual
meet play. He said that Lyn-
chburg was the only real threat
to the Generals in the ODAC
league.

The next home match for the
Generals will be against Liber-
ty Baptist at 8 p.m. Thursday in
the Warner Center.

help the Generals as they have
never been able to find a consis-
tent face-off man.

Unmentioned up to this point
has been the solution to the
team’s depth and defensive pro-
blem. That solution lies in the
yet unproven talent of the
freshmen players. Emmer says

it’s too early to assess any
outstanding freshmen but it ap-

' pears that all the freshmen out

for the team are capable of con-
tributing to the squad. He’s
quick to say that no one’s posi-
tion on the team is safe until the
final cuts are made and that
some of the freshmen may ac-
tually push out some of the
returnees for-a place on the
squad. Having observed fall
practice sessions for the first
time, the coach was able to in-
vite out only those he felt were
capable of playing at the varsi-
ty level. Of the 42 invited to try
out for the team, 10 must be cut
before the start of the season.
These cuts are something that
Coach Emmer says will not be
easy.

When asked the purpose for
the team’s planned trip to
Florida over winter break, Em-
mer offered two reasons. The
first is because the weather in
early February doesn’t allow
the team to practice outside as
much as it should. The second
reason is closely related to the
first. The team plays 10 games
between March 2 and April 4
which comes out to two games a
week. W&L has the reputation
of being a team which gets bet-
ter as the season goes on. This
year, however, it’s important
the team be ready early. Em-
mer feels the team has to be
strong in the early part of -the
season So as not to be faced with
a do or die situation come the
beginning of April. The Florida
trip will be used to concentrate
on conditioning and to. get the
necessary field work, which is
important to the early success
of the team.

As far as the team’s schedule
this year, Emmer sees it as
very demanding and challeng-
ing. When confronted with the
Statement that W&L usually
plays a weak schedule for a
Division I school, the coach
pointed to such teams as UNC,
UVa, Hofstra, Rutgers and
Syracuse. All of these teams are
likely national contenders and
are by no means weak. The
coach stated that W&L must
beat these teams if it hopes to
be invited to its eighth con-
secutive tournament. Emmer

The Ring-tum Phi, Feb:1, 1979, Page 9

Lax team opens training;
match on Mar. 2

also added that the majority of
the team’s “‘big’’ games are
played at home, which should
be an advantage.

When asked which team on
the schedule he saw as being the
biggest test, Emmer quickly
responded with Syracuse
University. He said that they
were ranked right behind the
Generals and are loaded with
talent. He fears W&L might
take the Orangemen too lightly,
something he will try to avoid.
He also said that playing
Syracuse early would provide a
test for the- caliber of lacrosse
the Generals are able to play.

Finally, when asked to give
an overall view of the upcoming
season, the coach said, ‘‘We’re
going to be competitive with
everybody. We’re going to need
good games from our key
players. The intangibles will
make or break us.’’ He says it’s
important the team maintain a

eg

silt (hai?

—<—

high degree of unity and a sense
of poise. He sees winning the
close games as being crucial to
the success of the entire season.
The feam must establish itself
early, get the confidence it
needs 0 win, and continue winn-
ing. Emmer added, ‘‘March is
very important. We’re going to
have to go after the other teams
and get it quick.

The Generals will tune up for
their March 9 season opener
with an exhibition game against
Chesapeake Lacrosse Club on
March 2. Both games will be
home and are, as Emmer
pointed out, very important in
establishing an early con-
fidence in the team. On paper
the Generals look as good as
they’ve been in years. Their
fate, however, will be determin-
ed on the field. With a coach as
successful and experienced as
Jack Emmer, the 1979 Generals
could surprise a lot of people.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

More Noise

After last Tuesday’s I.F.C. meeting, many fraterni-
ty officials are calling the city authorities “indian
givers” and worse — with good cause. Since the fall,
fraternities have had a ‘‘spotless record” overall (ac-
cording to Dr. Thomas Imeson of the City Council) as
regards noise violations. Yet the city authorities
again refused to consider any relaxation of the str-
ingent noise ordinance presently in effect.

In an attempt to pacify local residents the I.F.C.
limited weekday fraternity parties to Wednesdays on-
ly. There have also been greater efforts by the frater-
nities to negotiate directly with residential neighbors.
But ‘“‘waving the olive branch”’ appeared to have no
effect at all on the Council. Instead of helping form a
compromise, Imeson implied that fraternities should
be grateful that Lexington’s noise rules aren’t
stronger — in short, that fraternities had better be
satisfied and keep quiet. And though he invited frater-
nity officials to debate the subject further at the coun-
cil meeting tonight, Imeson added that he will con-
tinue to oppose any change in the noise ordinance.

The City Council’s treatment of W&L fraternities
strikes me as cavalier in the extreme. Recent good
conduct seems to have made no impression at all. As
a result of all this, the I.F.C. is now considering an
end to the ‘“‘Wednesday-only” rule on parties. And
why not? Now that cooperative efforts have stalled,
and fraternities are still subject to the same police ac-
tion, they might as well be able to choose which nights
to have their parties. ;

Despite rumors to the contrary, Dr. Imeson’s
message did include one positive note. There have
been several complaints of “‘selective enforcement”
of the noise ordinance by the police. Imeson stated
that the Council will certainly investigate any in-
cidents of this type. That’s about the only break
they’re ready to give — and it isn’t much — but it’s a
start. .

As the big party weekends approach, we urge all
fraternities to take action; report any evidence of un-
fair noise enforcement to the City Council. Also, try to
attend tonight’s council meeting, or offer your com-
promise suggestions to an I.F.C. member. In any
event, it is our hope that some sort of agreement can
be worked out, before the ‘‘spotless record’’ of the
fraternities is destroyed in a wave of anger and an-
noyance with the city fathers.

Letters To The Editor

Local resident comments on
“architectural embalming” of Henry St.

The following letter was received by the
Lexington News-Gazette this week, respon-
ding to last week’s housing feature in The
Ring-tum Phi. We thank The News-Gazette
for their permission to reprint the following.

Dear Editor:

An article entitled ‘‘Lexington’s Housing
Game” appeared in the January 26, 1979,
issue of the Ring-tum Phi. It seems a member
of the W&L coaching staff has bought a
number of lower-priced houses on Henry and
Randolph streets and is remodeling them. He
plans to rent them out to those able to pay
higher rents, thereby displacing the present
tenants. Several of these can find no place to
go, according to the article.

On more than one occasion, I believe, the
landlord in question has stated that he feels he
is doing the city a service in upgrading local

Admissions Committee

clarifies points
To the Editor:

Although I commend the Ring-tum Phi staff
on an excellent and very entertaining year, I
would like to protest the small, but I believe
significantly misleading coverage in last
week’s paper of the Freshman Admissions
Committee’s report to the E.C.

In all fairness to the Office of Admissions, it
should be made clear that Mr. Hartog has not
reorganized that department in order to
minimize any group’s input into the admis-
sions’ process as was insinuated. The purpose
of the reorganization and the resulting change
in the Admission Committee’s function was to
raise the office’s professional and com-
petitive effectiveness — a move both Monk
Hamra and I explained to the E.C. and fully
support. Secondly, the Phi article was incor-
rect in reporting that Monk and I “had no
firm reply’’ when asked whether our positions
as student representatives to the committee
should continue. As Tom McCarthy noted in
the E.C. minutes, we both believe that our
positions are still an important source of stu-
dent opinion on admission policies and only
recommend that representatives be ap-
pointed by the Executive Committee in the
spring so they can attend the committee’s
early fall meetings.

Thank you for this opportunity to clarify
last week’s article and the new approach
taken by the Office of Admissions.

Respectfully,
Douglas Byrd ‘79

property. “‘I think it was once a beautiful
street’ the article quotes him as saying. I feel
certain comments are in order.

Being familiar with Lexington since 1948, I
feel many of its streets on _ which,
predominantly, persons of African or mixed
descent live are still some of the more attrac-
tive sections of town. In summer they are
shady, and life is lived there, I hope, with less
of a compulsive concern for materiality and
its symbols. Houses, after all, attest to the
love lived inside ‘them and around them,
rather than to the price of the building
materials. I am by no means praising poverty
or insecurity; rather I am suggesting that by
causing such insecurity and distress by
displacing Lexington citizens, such renova-
tion may not be doing Lexington a favor at all
unless alternative low-priced housing is
available.

There is, it seems to me, a thin line between
architectural restoration and mere architec-
tural embalming. Neighborhoods have
organic lives all their own, and Lexington’s
poorer neighborhoods (speaking only of
material poverty) have a right to their in-
tegrity.

Honor System
Questioned

Dear Editor:

Are you sure W&L has an honor system?

I’m notsosure. "

My family owns Flo’s Market (formerly Ci-
ty Market at the corner of Henry and Ran-
dolph streets) and we were appalled at the ac-
tions of two W&L-‘‘gentlemen’”’ Monday night.

The soda machine at the front of the store
had just been refilled and the money taken
out. Two students came into the store, made a
small purchase and proceeded to get sodas
from the machine. Both of them came back in
and reported the machine did not work. One
student had gotten a soda and the other said
that after depositing his 35 cents he could not
get a soda.

Upon checking the machine we found only
40 cents deposited — not 70 cents as the two
students had firmly stated.

Fine example of an honor system, huh?

The W&L fencers lost a real close one to Navy last week. Their next match is against W&M and James

Madison on Sunday.

Fencers foiled by Navy —
Entertain Duke on Sat.

by Bill Sherwin

Dr. James Worth’s fencers
almost took a very close fencing
match from the U.S. Naval
Academy J.V. team this past
Saturday afternoon. Losing it
by a score of 16-11, the club held
Navy to a much closer match
than anyone expected.

The foil squad, led by captain
Will Mackie and freshman
Steve King, lost in matches to
Navy’s foil squad by a score of
5-4. Worth was very pleased
with the foil performance,
noting that Navy had a profes-
sional fencing coach.

In epee, Washington and Lee
was victorious, pulling an upset
victory over the men from An-

napolis by the score of 5-4. Win-
ning for the squad were Dave
Hepler, Paul Nathan, and Bill
Sherwin. Worth praised the
unit, saying ‘“They can really be
proud to have beaten Navy’s
epee, which was really a fine
team. I am very pleased with
the way they fenced.”’

In sabre, the team was not so
fortunate, posting a 7-2 loss.
Winners in this weapon were
Dave Bryant and Dave Garner,
with one victory each.

In an interview Tuesday,
Worth indicated his pleasure
with the team as a whole. He
pointed out that while W&L took
on the J.V. squad for Navy,
most of their fencers saw fairly

regular action with the varsity,
and the varsity team, although
a little better, ‘“‘is really not
much different from the J.V.”’

Captain Will Mackie viewed
the meet as a valuable ex-
perience for the club. “They got
us into it, we will really be
ready for this weekend.”’

Mackie was referring to the
vigorous fencing schedule plan-
ned for the fencers this Satur-
day and Sunday. On Saturday,
the team will fence Duke
University at 1:30. Originally
scheduled to be held in the
Warner Center, due to opposi-
tion from gym officials, it was
decided to hold the meet in
Cocke gymnasium at VMI.

On Sunday, the team is
scheduled to fence William and
Mary and James Madison
University at James Madison.
The meet is scheduled to begin
at2:30p.m.

Swimmers drop 5th

Washington and Lee’s swim-
mers dropped a 69-44 decision to
powerful William and Mary in
Williamsburg on Saturday. The
highlite of the meet for W&L,
now 1-5, was the diving of
sophomore Jay Diesing who
was first in one meter required
diving with 151.6 points and in
the one meter optional diving

with 242.0 points.

His total score of 393.6 easily
qualified for the National
Championships. Other first
place finishers for W&L includ-

ed co-captains Keith Romich in
the 200 (1:50.1) and 500 free
(5:00.6), and Chip Hoke in the
100 free (10:23.6).

No change in
noise ordinance

(continued from page 1)

Imeson invited disgruntled
fraternity members to attend
Thursday night’s City Council
meeting. He said students have
‘‘a right to change something,”’
although a committe upon
which he sits will recommend
“that the rule not be changed.”

The announcement by Imeson
came as a disappointment to
fraternity members who feel
they had made “concessions”
during the fall term in hopes of
reaching a compromise.

Said Imeson, “despite a
spotless record during that
period, there will be no quid pro
quo.”’ Imeson did mention after
the meeting that he has an
“interest in fairness’ and if
there was some indication of
selective enforcement he would
“certainly take action.”’

With the possibility that good
behavior by fraternity houses
will not help the situation, many
representatives at the meeting
discussed the possibility of
removing the ‘party only on
Wednesday restriction.”’

Executive Committee presi-
dent Beau Dudley agreed that
removal of the restriction is a
possibility, and that although he
is “extremely disappointed”
and “sees room for improve-
ment,” he is not ready to give

up yet.

The situation could become
bad with Fancy Dress around
the corner and Winter Weekend
a few days off. The problem will
be even worse in the spring
when houses party with win-
dows open.

Dudley initiated negotiations
between the fraternities and the
City Council last fall. When
questioned about his plans for
the future, Dudley said he
wants ‘“‘to sit back and think it
over for a few days.”

Stirring no less debate, if not
as heated as the noise ordinance
problem, were a list pf proposed
changes for Rush regulations.

One rule drew the most
debate: “There shall be no
pledging until after the fourth
rush date.’, Although the final
decision on the pledging debate
will not be made until spring,
points were made both for and
against the amendment.

While several representatives
pointed out that the present
system prevents freshmen from
seeing more than one house, op-
ponents of the measure said the
new idea would cause money
problems because rush would
be more intensive for a longer
period of time.

A decision on the proposal
will be made at an I.F.C. Rush
Committee meeting in the spr-
ing after the Student Activities
Committee approves a_ ten-
tative Rush calendar.

I.F.C. president Jim Davis
also announced that the Frater-
nity Inspection Committee will
inspect more than three houses,
the normal number, Thursday,
February 1’ The _ inspection
could pose a problem for many
houses that have parties
scheduled for Wednesday night.

Steve Abraham, representing
Delta Tau Delta, proposed that
the present rule calling for an
automatic fine upon receiving a
summons be dropped. The mo-
tion was amended and passed
unanimously.

Fraternities receiving a sum-
mons for noise violations may
now appeal the fine to the I.F.C.

effect Nov. 1.

Prior to Nov. 1 the govern-
ment only paid interest on stu-
dent loans if the adjusted in-
come of the student’s parents
was less than $25,000 a year.

Now, according to Pate, the

government will pay interest on
a loan to any student who can
find a bank willing to lend him
money because the $25,000 in-
come ceiling has been lifted.
The interest rate is currently
seven percent on student loans.
An undergraduate can bor-
row up to $2,500 a year, and can
borrow a miximum of $7,500
over 4 years. Graduate students
can borrow $5,000 a year. The
maximum amount of debt a stu-
dent can accumulate is $15,000.
A student does not have to

begin paying back a loan until
he has finished his education.

A growing number of students
have been defaulting on loans in
recent years. The loans are in-
sured by the government so tax-
payers pick up the tab when a
student does not pay back his
loan. Although the nationwide
rate of defeault is around 13 per-
cent for student loans, it is only
3 percent among Virginia
students.

According to Pate, this is
because students in most cases
can only get loans from banks in
their hometown which they
have dealt with over a period of
time.

Doyon Receives Appointment

Gerard Maurice Doyon, pro-
fessor of art history at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, is the new director of the
University Center In Virginia’s
atelier in Paris — an art and
music studio on the right bank
of the Seine.

The atelier is available to
teachers of music and art from
the University Center’s 15
member institutions for periods
ranging from three months to a
year. They pay no rent, and are
charged only for utilities and
services.

 

Funds for the facility were
donated to the University
Center in 1966 by the president
of Steuben Glass, Arthur Amory
Houghton Jr., to be matched by
the member colleges and
universities. The University
Center has its atelier on a 98-
year lease.

It is located across from
Notre Dame Cathedral, two
blocks south of France’s new
complex for the arts, the Centre
Pompidou.

Doyon, art professor at W&L
for 11 years, studied extensively
in Paris, and his Ph.D. disserta-
tion at Boston University was
on the mural paintings of the
French artist Theodore
Chasseriau. Doyon is also a
painter himself, and among his
one-man exhibitions was a show
at the Galerie Palmes in Paris.

Doyon will carry ou his duties
as director of the atelier from
W&L in addition to his full-time
teaching and chairmanship of
the art division of Washington
and Lee’s fine arts department.
