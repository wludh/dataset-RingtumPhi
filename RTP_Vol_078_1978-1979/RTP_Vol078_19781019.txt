its election Monday, choosing
its representative to the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

Jenelle Mims was the winner
in the law school election cap-
turing 47 of the 82 votes cast.
Bill Abernathy received 22
votes and Mindy Dunn 13 in the
contest for the first-year law
class’ E.C. member.

Today’s run-off for freshman
class president involved Ware
Palmer and Stuart Miller.
Palmer was the biggest vote-
getter in Monday’s election poll-

votes.

Dropped from today’s ballot

to his Graham-Lee dorm room
following dinner to find that his

Presidential candidate’s
banner sabotaged

 

he was very upset and im-
mediately contacted Dean
Robert Huntley, Coordinator of
the Freshman Year, at his of-
fice.

Dean Huntley made several
phone calls, including a call to
Jay Foster, Schott’s dorm
counselor. Foster considered
the matter important enough to
ask George Berry, Assistant
Head Dorm Counselor for his
wing of the dorm, to help in-
vestigate the matter.

Berry and Foster inter-
rogated two freshmen several
times over the course of the
weekend, whom they suspected
of involvement in the incident.

During the weekend’s ques-
tioning, the dorm counselors
discovered that only one of the
students had actually been in-
volved; however, his identity
has not been disclosed.

According to Berry, ‘‘By Sun-
day night we knew who did it
and we confronted him” and
‘the told us that he had done it.”

Jay Foster did not wish to
comment on the incident, but
George Berry stated that the
dorm counselors considered the
incident, ‘‘not a matter for the
E.C...It has been taken to Stu-
dent Control.”

Berry said the incident was
“not a personal attack by one
student on another, it was an ac-
cident that we felt was serious
enough to go to Student Con-

Sigma Chi Fined $100,

Delt Fine Dropped

by David Greer

Delta Tau Delta fraternity’s
fine of $100 for ‘‘ungentlemanly
conduct’’ at the Lambda Chi
Alpha house was reduced to a
“stiff warning’ by the Inter-
fraternity Council’s Judicial
Board Tuesday night. In addi-
tion, Sigma Chi was fined $100
for a ‘‘kidnapping”’ infraction.

Freshman Stan Nolan, a
Sigma Chi pledge, was taken
from the freshman quad by
several Sigma Chi up-
perclassmen and was left on
Route 60 near the Blue Ridge
Parkway. He was picked up by
dorm counselor Bill Tucker,
who was returning from a road
trip.

The upperclassmen
involved—Pete Clements,
Ricky Wallerstein, Marsh Mer-
riman, Ed Jordan, Sam Rogers,
and Jim F lippen—said that they
did not realize that they were
breaking any rules.

The group said that they had
asked dorm counselor Charlie
Smith about kidnapping before
the incident, and that he had
told them that they could not
take anyone from the dorms.
They did not realize that the
quad is considered part of the
dorm area, and said that they
would not have broken the rules
if they had known them.
Clements stressed that they
were ‘‘trying to make sure we
did nothing wrong.”’

by IFC

The group said they created
no disturbance in the quad and
that Nolan put up no struggle.
They notified some other
pledges of Nolan’s whereabouts
so he could be rescued.

Judicial Board member Bill
Thistlethwaite, during the
Board’s deliberations on the
case, said,’ ‘‘a dorm counselor
really messed up this case—he
let them do something wrong.”

Board member Charles Terry
added that he thought, ‘they
were legitimate in that they
thought it was all right that they
were in the quad.”

It was also pointed out that
the Sigma Chi’s violated an IFC
rule against any pledging ac-

Homecoming cost $4,000, SAB says

by Dick Moss

While the final figures are not
yet tabulated, the SAB, ac-
cording to co-chairman Doug
Jackson, spent an estimated
$4,000 this past weekend on
Homecoming. This figure
agrees with the approximate
budget which the SAB had
made for the weekend.

At the SAB meeting Sunday
night, board members were
asked about any reactions they
received about Homecoming,
and while the general reaction
seemed to be good, there were a
few complaints about the noise
and the time factor at the con-
cert Friday night.

Film Society
Given $100

Jim Diesing, president pro-
tem, came before the SAB. to
ask for funds totaling $100 for
second film in their series, the
first being paid for by the
Glasgow Endowment. Diesing
and Professor Kaston were told
to come to the SAB by the E.C.

After a presentation by Ms.
Kaston and Diesing, and a few
minutes of discussion among
SAB members, the SAB voted to
give $100 to the Film Society,
and promised to consider any
further requests for funds from
the Film Society.

Ms. Kaston then left the
= but on her way out,

she told the Board members
that she was “‘very impressed”’
with the considerate manner
with which they had treated
her. She also stated that, ‘“‘The
E.C. seemed to give us the cold
shoulder’’ when they went
before that body, and that this
increased her favorable im-
pression of the SAB.

(See related story
on page 4)

Other Business
In other matters, the SAB an-

nounced a number of bands be-
ing considered for Fancy Dress,
among them, Art Mooney, Glen
Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Duke
Ellington, and Stan Keaton.

The SAB also voted to have
Menus, a Brazilian jazz group,
in the Cockpit, on Nov. 9 or 11,
at a cost of between $150-$200.

The SAB will also be sponsor-
ing a concert by Happy Trom in
the Cockpit Oct. 25, and a guitar
workshop on Oct. 26 in the
music room, led by Trom. The
cost for Trom will be $600.

Nine freshmen removed from ballot Monday

by Randy Smith

“T think the whole election
should be done over Wednes-
day,’ said junior represen-
tative Steve Abraham at the
Executive Committee’s
meeting Monday night.

Nine of the 17 freshman can-
didates for class and committee
offices failed to submit a finan-
cial statement by 7 p.m. Sun-
day, so their names _ were
stricken from the ballot.

Abraham noted that ‘‘a
number of candidates’’ had left
the E.C. room before the com-
mittee established that a can-
didate’s failure to submit a list
of expenses incurred during the
campaigh would result in hav-

ing his name removed from the
ballot.

“I think we moved a little
quickly,” said Beau Dudley,
E.C. president, but he was op-
posed to the idea of reopening
the elections.

‘‘Many freshmen didn’t know
the regulations and only turned
in their petitions (for office),’’
E.C. vice-president Bill Tucker
said.

“When you’re talking about
people running for office, the
very least we can expect of
them is to know their respon-
sibilities,’ argued sophomore
representative Will Mackie.

“I’m not convinced that we
made a mistake,’’ said Dudley.
“] think if it (the election) is

trol,’’ and added, ‘‘I think all
parties involved are satisfied
with the way it has been handl-
ed so far and I am quite sure
there will be no repercussions.”’

Reflecting on the incident,
Dan Schott said, “I can ap-
preciate practical jokes, but
when someone goes to the ex-
tent to damage people’s proper-
ty or valued possessions, that
doesn not appeal to me as fitting
the W&L ideal of a gentleman.”’

Schott indicated that he was
impressed with the manner in
which it was handled, adding
that the matter was ‘“‘dealt with
quickly and quietly. I had very
little to do with it.”’

Dean Robert Huntley called
the matter ‘“‘troubling,” but
praised Dorm Counselors
George Berry and Jay Foster
for doing a _  ‘‘thorough,

straightforward and _ candid
job”’ in their investigation.

that important to them, then
they should be here.”’

Only two freshman can-
didates attended the E.C.
meeting, neither of them to pro-
test the election.

Tucker initiated a motion to
cancel Monday’s freshman
election, but when it came down
to a vote, his only support came
from Abraham and the motion
was defeated 2-8.

Pertaining to today’s run-off
election, the E.C. established
that write-in candidates not be
allowed to run, that the spen-
ding limit be raised $2.50, and
that no financial statement

need be submitted.

In other business at Monday
night’s meeting, the E.C. heard
from the Calyx business
manager that last year’s year-
book editor, Temp Webber, had
apparently charged over $60
worth of personal expenses to
the Calyx.

Grant Leister, Calyx business
manager and representative
from the Publications Board,
told the committee that Webber
had charged camera repair
work totaling $47.03 to the year-

book without his approval. Web-~

ber had also charged $13.20 in

UVa. fraternities warned

CHARLOTTESVILLE
Police officials have sent for-

mal warnings to University of -

Virginia fraternities, threaten-
ing arrest if some steps are not
taken to curb public drinking
and noise violations.

The move came as the result
of repeated complaints by
residential neighbors, concern-
ed about repeated late-night
parties and insufficient trash
disposal. Mayor Lawrence
Brunton of Charlottesville then

met last week with a newly-
formed Interfraternity Council
to inform the students of the
ultimatum.

According to police, the Inter-
fraternity Council leaders have
been most cooperative; un-
fortunately, success has been
rather slow among the fraterni-
ty men in general.

_ Fraternity houses are now
patrolled with police noise
meters. At the present time, the

Charlottesville noise ordinance
goes into effect at 10 p.m. each
night. Therefore, it appears
that these fraternities may soon
face the barrage of summonses
and arrests that have been seen
in Lexington, most recently in
the past few weeks. Charlottes-
ville authorities are ready to
take action; Mayor Brunton
concluded, ‘‘We can’t have a
double standard...We want the
police to enforce our ordinances
the same for everybody.”

E.C. hears committee reports

(continued from page 2)

Cockpit food bills to the Calyx,
Leister said.

Both charges were made
toward the end of last year and
were not discovered until this
year, the business manager told
the E.C.

Both bills were paid for by the .

Pub. Board and were being
mailed to Webber and his col-
lege transcript was being frozen
until the debts were repaid,
Leister said.

While at the meeting, Leister
told the E.C. that this year’s

Calyx had already spent close
to $11,000.

Publisher’s costs amounted to
$10,000 in the first installment,
Leister told the committee.
Senior portraits and darkroom
expenses cost the yearbook $600
and $341, respectively.

The Calyx collected $140 from
undergraduates who had not
paid for their yearbook pictures
during matriculation.

Ben Keesee, editor Ariel, the
student literary magazine, said
that he hopes to publish the first
edition by the week before ex-

ams.

“We seem to be going in the
right direction and I’m very op-
timistic,”’ Keesee said.

The Student Activities Board
announced the appointment of
Robert Neely, a sophomore, as
the new Publicity Director for
the board.

Dick Gregory to
speak in Chapel

Dick Gregory, comedian and
civil rights leader, will speak at
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. on Tues-
day, Oct. 24. The event is spon-
sored by the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity, and is open
to the entire community. No ad-
mission fee will be charged for
the event.

As one critic says, ‘‘It is dif-
ficult to label the prolific ac-
tivities of Dick Gregory. He
became famous as a _ profes-
sional comedian. Today he is a
recording artist, author, lec-
turer, actor, human rights ac-
tivist, social satirist, critic,
philosopher and _ political
analyst, who combines all of
these roles to serve the cause of
human liberation and to
alleviate human suffering
brought on by ignorance and
apathy.”’

Dick Gregory chose a career
in comedy at a time when black
comedians received bookings
only in black clubs and
theaters. In 1961, he was called

as a last-minute replacement at
Chicago’s. Playboy Club. He
was an immediate sensation,
soon appearing in all the top
clubs in the country and on ma-
jor network television shows.

During the civil rights move-
ment of the 1960s, Dick Gregory
participated in every major
(and most minor) demonstra-
tion for human rights in
America. He devoted his time
and talent to benefits for civil
rights groups, peace groups,
and other clusters of people
devoted to human liberation.
Ironically, the doors he had
opened in the entertainment in-
dustry began to slam in his
face, but he has continued his
widespread activities in this
area.

Dick Gregory the lecturer has
become a sought-after speaker
in America on college cam-
puses. He visits more than 300
colleges each school year, and
his popularity among business
groups is rapidly growing.

Entertain

Animal House
hits big Lex.

by Dick Barron

You’ve heard about it, you’ve
read about it, you’ve probably
seen it, and now it’s here. Na-
tional Lampoon’s Animal House
has officially blasted its way in-
to Lexington, and _ sources
report that the town may never
be the same.

This past Friday the thir-
teenth may have brought doom
and bad luck to many, but to the

Film Society scores

Action taken last week by the
Glasgow Endowment Program
saved the fledgling W&L Film
Society from what appeared to
be a very limited engagement.
The Glasgow grant came on the
heels of the Film Society’s un-
successful plea for funds to the
E.C.

Specifically, the Glasgow En-
dowment has offered to provide
up to $1500 in matching grants
to bring modern art films to ca
us. Further, .Glasgow has
agreed to fund the entire cost of
the first Film Society presenta-
tion, Bergman’s Cries and
Whispers.

Bergman’s 1972 masterpiece
is scheduled to be shown Friday
and Saturday, Nov. 9-10, in one
of the large Law _ School
classrooms. Following each
screening there will be a recep-
tion open to all.

Tentatively scheduled for the
second weekend after
Thanksgiving is Fassbider’s
1976 Chinese Roulette. Funds to
match the Glasgow money for
this film were provided by the
SAB.

Generating funds to match
those of the Glasgow Endow-
ment, in order to bring winter
term films to the campus, is a
major concern of the Society,
presently presided over by Jay
Diesing. Unfortunately, an ad-
mission charge to Society films
is impossible because this
jumps the rental fee on a film
from $300 or $400 to well over
$1000 per film.

Instead, the Film Society will
appeal for a subscription-like
donation from those attending
the series. This appeal is
directed mainly to faculty and
townspeople to whom screen-
ings will be open.

In fact, the Society intends to
direct mailings and advertising
toward the entire Lex-
ington/VMI/W&L community.
Donations of up to $25 will make
one a ‘‘member”’ of the Society,
up to $50 makes one a “‘spon-
sor’’ and any donation ex-
ceeding $50 makes one an
‘“‘angel’’ (sic). These in-
dividuals, as well as sponsoring
businesses, will be listed in a
program to be distributed at
Film Society screenings.

Other activities of the Film
Society include the selection of
the films to be shown. Diesing

 

feels that the contemporary art
films selected by the Society fill
a definite gap in campus offer-
ings. No one group has the
money to spend on the type of
films shown by the Society and
‘Professor Jennings’ film
course only deals with the
basics.”

So far Film Society meetings
have played to large crowds of
about 30 students who represent
a cross-section of majors.
Finally, if student interest, as

shown by meeting attendance,
isn’t enough to show a definite
place for the Society on cam-
pus, society advisor Carren
Kaston senses, ‘‘a different at-
mosphere on campus for film
than there has been for a long
time.”’

She feels that the film courses
offered have ‘‘sensitized
students to film,’’ and further,
‘that this is a ripe time’”’ for the
Film Society, as they begin
their first year on Campus.

Musical Mainstream

It appears that summer’s end
has not brought an end to the
series of tours that caused
many people to acclaim 1978 as
the ‘“‘Year of the Road Show.”
While some folks are wrapping
up their summertime treks,
others are just now taking to the
road, and at least one of the ma-
jor events of the summer is still
going on.

The one show out of the new
crop which promises to turn in-

to a major event is Peter -

Gabriel’s first large-scale tour
of the United States as a solo ar-
tist. He recently departed from
his itinerary of 4,000-5,000 seat
auditoriums to play two SRO
shows at the Bottom Line in
New York City which beat the
attendance figures of such New
York favorites as Bruce Spring-
steen and Graham Parker.
Musical Mainstream has been
invited to Gabriel’s per-
formance at the Stanley
Theatre in Pittsburgh on Oc-
tober 27; look forward to more
coverage within the next two
weeks.

In addition, Dave Edmunds,
whose latest album I reviewed
last week, has just embarked on

a major tour of the United
States along with Van Morrison.
Edmunds will be accompanied
by his band Rockpile, featuring
Nick Lowe on bass, and he will

’ also do two shows at the Bottom

Line, this time without Mor-
rison.

On the West Coast, Yes wrap-
ped up their 1978 U.S. tour with
dates at the L.A. Forum and the
Oakland Colisseum. At the final
Oakland show, the band was
surprised with the presence of
the Oakland Raiders’
cheerleading squad; when they
returned to the stage for their
encore, they were each ac-
companied by their own
cheerleaders. Then, believe it
or not, the ladies did a routine
along with ‘‘Roundabout.”’
That, combined with pies in the
faces from their roadies after
the encore, must have made for
a truly bizarre evening for band
and audience alike.

Equally miraculous in some
ways is the fact that, after five
months and over 70 shows in as
many cities, Bruce Springsteen
is STILL on the road. He’ll be
playing at the Capital Centre in
Washington on November 2.

students of Washington and
Lee, it brought Homecoming ’78
and Animal House. That’s one
powerful combination.

The student is now able to go
out and create his own chaos
and then relax while he watches
a repeat of the same thing on
the big screen. Unlike anything
ever filmed before, Animal
House allows the viewer to ex-
perience the less dignified side
of college life in all its shameful
glory.

For those readers who have
been lost in a cave for the last
two months, the story of Animal
House involves two fraternities
at ‘Faber College.’’ One of
these houses (the Omegas) is
supremely perfect, while the
other is a monument to bad
taste (Delta Tau Chi) — the
‘*Animal House.”

The members of the latter in-
clude ‘“‘Bluto’’ (John Belushi),
“Otter” (Tim Matheson), and
“Boon” (Peter Riegert), along
with a large troop of campus
cut-ups. The Animal House is a
leader in its community, with
many achievements to _ its
credit, among them many all
night parties and some of the
most destructive escapades

by Mark Mainwaring
and Robin Meredith

Springsteen fans might be well-
advised to keep their eyes open
for possible dates in Charlottes-
ville or Roanoke.

Just a reminder: Aerosmith,
hot on the heels of their ap-
pearance in Sgt. Pepper’s Lone-
ly Hearts Club Band, will ap-
pear at the Roanoke Civic
Center this Thursday along with
Exile (,’Kiss You All Over’’).
Waylon Jennings and Jessi Col-
ter, the hottest couple in coun-
try and western, will hit the
Civic Center this Friday. Both
shows will begin at 8 p.m.

ever seen at Faber College
(where ‘‘knowledge is good’’).

The story is average, but it
becomes amazing in the hands
of scriptwriters Harold Ramis,
Doug] Kinney, and Chris Miller.
This crackerjack team of
writers from the National Lam-
poon gives this film its never-a-
dull-moment pace, and the well
trained cast gives it a sparkle
that’s rarely seen in today’s
comedy films. :

Film editor George Folsey,
Jr, makes several comic cuts in
the film, the most memorable
being the scene at the Black
nightclub in which Otis Day
tells his band to ‘“‘hit it’ while
several Delta brothers come
literally crashing into the park-
ing lot outside.

Recent attendance figures for
Animal House reveal that the
film has already grossed $60
million and that speaks for its
popularity. For a majority of
the viewers, Aiimal House
looks like a zany comedy about
a bunch of wise-guy frat men.

Many would refuse to believe
the absurd episodes. of
debauchery and _ destruction
which occur there, actually ex-
ist, yet to a large group of W&L
men, the film seems to mirror a
substantial portion of fraternity
life. Fraternities roll on in this
world as tributes to the past and
shelters from the future.

Countless stories of mass
idiocy abound in the lore and
legend of the W&L fraternity
system. Everything from
‘‘gatoring” to “road tripping”’
is given a fair treatment in
Animal House, but what we at
W&L fail to realize is that the
film belongs to all moviegoers
in its sheer comic delight.

There’s quite a bit of Animal
House imitation going on
among today’s college students.

Jacobsen engages
Simon Gray play

by R.B. Ramirez

Last year, the University
Theatre planned to produce
Simon Gray‘s Butley, a play
about a man struggling with
personal relationships in this
modern society. Unfortunately,
it was never presented, but the
week after next, Butley’s com-
panion piece, Otherwise Engag-
ed will open, in a production

that deserves no small amount
of interest.

Otherwise Engaged, as the ti-
tle implies, is about a man,
Simon, who chooses not to em-
brace the world but to ignore it,
to shut it out. One wonders why
Simon behaves in this manner;
indeed, the reasons may be
more complex that they appear
to be.

Well, when John Jacobsen,

Cockpit music

by Dash Coufal

The Bent Mountain Opera
Company will play the Cockpit
on Saturday night, Oct. 21. This

multi-talented four piece band.

from Roanoke plays a variety of
songs from almost every
musical genre. Jim Stallard,
the originator of the band with
his wife, Patty, plays acoustic
and electric guitar, violin and
mandolin.

His wife plays cello, electric
bass and the twangy Jew’s
harp, as well as singing. Kevin
Orcutt plays electric slide and
acoustic guitar and Chuck
Davis handles all the percus-
sion and drums. All four of the
Opera Company sing, and their
four part harmonies are very
well matched.

They will play songs of Janis,
Taj Mahal, Eric Clapton,
Dylan, The Beatles, as well as
some western swing and
bluegrass. The performance
will begin at 8:30 and last till at
least midnight. There will be a
$1.00 cover charge for W&L
students and $1.25 for all non-
W&L guests.

Halloween
Party

This year’s Cockpit Hallo-
ween party will be Oct. 27 and
will have the Allstars, a blues
and rock band, playing from
8:30-12:30.

Describing themselves as a
boogie band, the Allstars from
Charlottesville play everything
from straight 12-bar blues to
Chicago blues to good hard

rock; from Muddy Waters’
“Forty Days and Forty Nights”’
to Bruce Springsteen’s ‘The
Fever’’ and Fleetwood Mac’s
“Tell Me All The Things (You
Do).”

Called ‘Just about the best
blues band in the Southeast,” by
Nick Tosches of The Rolling
Stone, the band features a lead
vocalist named Lucile Schottle,
who “has a voice that seems to
start in her toes and surge up
from there,’ (Charlie Mc-
Collum, The Washington Star).
The band also features a
dynamite harmonica. player,
Doug Jay; two good guitarists,
Rick Green and Steve Bliley;
bass player Steve Riggs; and
drummer Paul Hammond.

The band played the Cockpit
twice last year with great suc-
cess and is expected to repeat
the fun this year. Their new
album Tip Your Waitress is on
Adelphi records and_ is
available in the supply store
record shop. There are no
originals on the album, but it
does feature Koko Taylor's
“Voodoo Woman,” Otis Rush’s
“My Love Will Never Die,”’
Papa Lightfoot’s ‘“‘Mean Old
Train,’ as well as Wyonie Har-
ris’ ‘‘Wasn’t That Good,” a
great old rocker.

The party starts at 8:30 and
the cover charge. will be $1.50
for W&L students and their
dates, $2.50 for non-students,
and only a buck for students
wearing at least the top half of a
costume. Half price brew for
toga clad partyers!! So get out
that white sheet and laurel
wreath and toga!

the director of this production,
saw the original in London (it
has been playing there since
1976, and opened more recently
in New York), he wondered
about this, and hit upon a novel
method of exploring a complex
and interesting character.

The actors, both in the script
and in several improvisa-
tions, have been rehearsed to
within an inch of their lives, and
have spent no small amount of
time in discussions, exercises,
and sharing of ideas, hoping to
maintain a high level of energy
and spontaneity on the stage.

But there’s nothing _par-
ticularly innovative about any
of that. What really makes this
production stand out is the fact
that Jacobsen has decided to let
the part of Simon be shared by
two actors, each highly capable
in his own way. Each of the two
actors, Taylor Harbison and
Kurt Kammerer, has a personal
method of dealing with the role
of Simon, as well as with that of
Dave, who plays opposite him.

At first it would seem as
though such close collaboration
between two actors would lead
them to imitate each other’s in-
terpretation, but this has not
turned out to be the case. They
may have come to occasional
agreements about their
characters, but each will deal
with the task of interpretation
quite independently. The real
kicker is that not until the time
comes to apply makeup and to
don a costume, one short hour
before the curtain rises, will
anyone but the director know
which actor will be given which
part for the evening’s per-
formance. According to
Jacobsen, this is just one more
way to keep actors alert and
primed, for it forces them to
conserve their energy until the
last possible minute.

Jacobsen has gone even fur-
ther in his senior thesis ex-
perimentation. Every evening,
after the show, he hopes that the
audience will remain in the
threatre long enough for the ac-
tors to return to the stage and to
engage them in dialogue about
how the performance went.

The show will run this way for
three nights, and then will close
for two, so that the whole thing
may be re-worked to ac-
commodate the audience’s
comments and_ suggestions.
After two dark nights, the show
will play for two more per-
formances.

Certainly, the actors will be
surprised every evening at least
as much as the audience. It
WILL be a thoroughly different
show each time, and from all
apperances, one could do worse
than to see it all five times.

For reservations, please call

RING-TUM PHI

Football team goes
0-6 after loss to H-S

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee
Generals moved one step closer
to total ignominy by losing their
sixth straight game last Satur-
day to Hampden-Sydney, 14-0.

The contest, played before a
Homecoming crowd of 5,000 at
Wilson Field, was yet another
frustrating 60 minutes of foot-
ball for Head Coach Gary
Fallon.

“Overall, we played our best
game of the year,”’ said Fallon,
‘but those turnovers killed us
again.”

The Generals turned the ball
over five times against H-SC,
including four fumbles and one
interception. Two of the
fumbles were converted into
Hampden-Sydney touchdowns,
while another stopped W&L on
the H-SC 19. “I think our
fumbles may be a result of over
trying,’’ said Fallon.
“Sometimes our runners are
trying too hard for that extra
yard, and they give too many
tacklers a chance to strip the
ball. In last Saturday’s game,
several players were guilty of
doing this.”

Excluding the turnovers, the
game was a tough contest that
featured the work-horse runn-
ing of tai!lbacks Stewart Atkin-
son and Jim Ferguson. Atkin-
son carried the ball 29 times for
112 yards, while Ferguson car-
ried 25 times for 115 yards and
one touchdown. The H-SC
running back needs only 131
yards to break the all-time state
rushing record.

On their first possession in the
game, W&L drove from their
own 46 to the Tigers’ 19 before
Stewart Atkinson fumbled on
the H-SC 20. Hampden-Sydney
then marched 80 yards on 13
plays for their first touchdown.
Bill Newell's ten yard pass to
Tom Gray gave H-SC a 7-0 lead
with 7:30 left in the first
quarter.

This turned out to be the only

score of the first half, as both

Hampden-Sydney was_ twice
able to get inside the W&L 30,
but the closest they came to
scoring was a missed 25 yard
FG attempt.

Action at Sunday’s lacrosse game. It was for ‘a good time.”

Alumni win lacrosse
game, Emmer gets trip

by Chris Sisto

“It was good to get everyone
together and have a good time’,
said head lacrosse coach Jack
Emmer when he described Sun-
day’s fourth annual Alumni-
Varsity lacrosse game. The
alumni were victorious 14-13 on
Dave Warfield’s score with 2:09
remaining in the game. War-
field, who scored five goals in
the game, was a co-captain of
the 1975 team.

The game was close
throughout with alumni holding
the largest leads. These leads
came on two three goal margins
when the score was 4-1 and 6-3.
The varsity came back both
times and this made for an ex-
citing seccond half. Although
the game was close, play was

relatively sloppy. Passes were

-

dropped and _ overthrown,
stickhandling was poor, and
there were several minor
penalties. Emmer was quick to
point out that it is early and
everyone is still “rusty” from
the lack of practice.

Early in the contest it was all
alumni. But with 1:30 remain-
ing in the first period, senior
midfielder Dirk Pieper and
senior attackman John Black
added tallies within forty-five
seconds of each other to pull the
score to 4-3, which was how the
quarter ended.

In the second quarter the var-
sity closed another three goal
lead and tied the score at seven
when junior midfielder Ray
McNulty scored with forty-five
seconds remaining in the
period. The half ended at a 7-7

Soccer team wins twice
against Division I schools

by Tim Connors

Last week the Generals broke
into the win column for the first
time this season with 2-1 deci-
sions over the University of
Richmond and Virginia Tech.
Both schools are in the NCAA’s
Division I, so the prospects of a

year,” said Fallon. Five turnovers, however, ruined it for the

successful remainder of the
season for Washington and
Lee’s Division III team are very
good.

Senior forward Todd Tyson
scored the Generals’ first goal
against Richmond, which
enabled W&L to tie the Spiders
1-1 after the first half. Senior
midfielder Howie Collier scored
in the second half as_ the
Generals’ defense turned in a
strong team effort’ to aid
sophomore goalie Kevin Carney
in recording his first win of the
season. Coach Rolf Piranian
said that W&L ‘‘played real well
as a team,”’ and that he ‘‘made
a couple of changes’ in the
usual alignment that turned out
to be successful.

In Virginia Tech, the
Generals encountered a team
which sported a 5-2 record and
which was ranked 13th in the
Middle Atlantic Region before
the game. Piranian said that
the Gobblers were a ‘‘sounder
ballclub’’ than were the

Generals, but that W&L played
with ‘‘more intensity and more

discipline,’’ and that these were
the two keys to success. Co-
captain Bill Stone broke out of
his season-long scoring slump
in the first half, with an assist
from Bill Brown. Sophomore
Craig Burns’ scored an
unassisted goal for the game-
winner. Piranian said that ‘‘we
had taken some chances defen-
sively in order to get more of-
fensive punch, and it paid off for
us.”

The Generals renewed a big
rivalry yesterday against
James Madison University in a
game that was played after
press time. The Generals had
not beatem JMU since 1970
entering yesterday’s contest.

On Saturday W&L travels to
Roanoke College to renew its
oldest rivalry. The Generals
hold a 23-12-3 advantage over
the Maroons, and Piranian is
looking to maintain the success
which W&L has enjoyed so far

in the series. He has every -

reason to be confident, because
after his team’s first two wins,
Piranian says that ‘“‘we now

tie.

In the third period both teams
scored four goals. The varsity
had its only lead of the game
when junior attackman Jay
Foster scored one of his three
goals of the day just 17 seconds

into the quarter. Junior Middie
John Hooper tied the score at 11
with his goal when only 24
seconds remained. In_ this
quarter Jay Sindler (’78) scored
two of his three goals for the
alumni.

In the final period the alumni
out scored the varsity 3-2 to give
them the winning margin. In
this quarter Warfield scored
two goals.

Coach Emmer was not at all
concerned about the loss. He
said, “It was a lot of fun for
everyone. I just wanted to get a
look at everyone and play
everybody equally.’”” Emmer
was pleased with his team plan
in the second half and also with
the support from the 40 some
alumni who showed up. He also
added, ‘‘I look for a good year
from this team. Our defense
and attack are set and we have
a good nucleus of midfielders.
We should also get help from
our freshmen how didn’t even
play in today’s game.”

Emmer was not only pleased
with the morning game but also
with the post-game reception.
Over 100 lacrosse players,
alumni, and friends awarded
Emmer and his wife Joan an all
expense paid week trip to Ber-
muda. This, a second honey-
moon for the Emmers, is for the
coach’s great success of the
lacrosse program at W&L. A
time not yet been decided for
the trip by the Emmers.

Tennis team ends season
on losing not in Tourney

by John Winans

W&L completed its fall tennis
season here with the last of
their three tournaments, and
ended up on the losing end of all
three of their matches.

The netmen faced three tough
Division I teams in the Second
Annual W&L Fall Invitational
this past Homecoming
Weekend. In their first match
the Generals lost to Ohio

University, 7-2. The doubles
team of Stewart Jackson and
Shaw Cranfield were victorious
in their match against Ohio as
well as in their match with
Maryland. In the next contest,

W&L lost in a heartbreaker to ©

the Terrapins of Maryland 5-4.
This was the closest that a W&L
tennis team ever came to
beating tough Maryland. The
Wahoos of Virginia had more
luck against the Generals,

consciousness. The closest W&L
could get was to the H-SC 40, but
Rich Hachenburg’s fumble end-
ed any possibility of scoring.
This was just the beginning of a
frustrating day for W&L, which
has been shut out twice ina row.

In the second half, things
went from bad to good to bad
again for W&L. Stewart Atkin-
son mishandled a pitchout at
the W&L 33, giving H-SC the
ball. The Tigers drove to the
W&L 16, but Newell’s pass was
intercepted by cornerback Jack
Norberg. Two plays later,
tullback Jim Palemmo fumbled
on the 10, and Hampden-Sydney
ran only one play to score their
final touchdown. Ferguson’s 10
yard run gave H-SC a 14-0 lead,

which they held for the rest of —

the game.

The Generals were not ready
to give up, however. Three
times were they able to move
inside H-SC territory. Once,
they made it to the Tiger’s 37
before punting. Another time,
they got down to the Tiger’s 22,
but Hachenburg’s pass on
fourth down was intercepted.
On their last chance, the
Generals made it to Hampden-
Sydney’s 14, only to be penaliz-
ed to the 30 and, once again
stopped on fourth down. This
was the final nail in the coffin
for W&L.

Every loss is hard for Gary
Fallon to accept, so don’t tell
him this game was a moral vic-
tory. ‘‘We lost to a team that
gave us plenty of chances to
win. I don’t see how anyone
could call that a victory,’’ said
Fallon. ‘“We’re not learning to
accept defeat,’’ said the coach.
“I think this is the main reason
why our games have been so
close. We haven’t lost that
desire to win.”

The Generals, now 0-6 on the
year, have four tough opponents
to play. Last year’s squad beat
Sewanee, Bridgewater and
Georgetown, while losing to
Emory & Henry, 7-6. Sewanee is
coming off a big upset of
Southwestern, 28-13.
Bridgewater upset Hampden-
Sydney, 10-9, and Georgetown
has the top-rated offense among
Division III teams. Even
Emory & Henry is an improved
team, so there is no real break
in the schedule.

This Saturday’s opponent,
and the next to last home oppo-
nent, is Sewanee. The Tigers,
1-3 on the year, are always

tough. ‘‘They’re improving with
each game,” said Fallon.
“They have a strong offensive
backfield and a good pursuing
defense. They’re a lot like
Hampden-Sydney or
Maryville.”

If the Generals are going to

win a game soon, this could be .-

it. Game time is 1:30 at Wilson
Field.

however, winning 9-0.

“Our objectives for the fall
season were met in that we
found our top eight players for
the spring season, as we faced
tough competition and gained
experience that will be very
valuable in the spring,’’ Coach
Gary Franke explained. ‘‘We
were right in there in our mat-
ches and hung tough. The fall
season is for looking over the
talent that you have and for
gaining experience. We ac-
complished both of these
goals.”” The Generals will keep

in practice this winter by play- .

ing some racquetball until the
snow disappears when they can
start to gear up for the spring
season.

“This spring we will be facing
Division I schools which should
give us a real edge when we do
play Division III and con-
ference teams,’’ Franke ex-
plained. Pre-season starts
February 5, and according to
Coach Franke, the Generals
‘will be ready.”

United Way run

planned for Sunday

The Washington and Lee
cross country team and co-
captain Bob Bates have an-
nounced plans for a United Way
Benefit run to take place on
Sunday. The actual run will be
36 miles starting at W&L and
concluding at Sweet Briar. Ap-
proximately 36 runners from
both schools will take part with
each male runner expected to
run five miles and each female
runner to run one. The group
will run along Route 60 east
beginning at 11:00 and plan to
finish their journey in five

le HeHehehehelelepe,

hours. Two vans. will
company the runners.

Bates is hoping to receive a
pledge of $1 per mile for a total
of $36 from each of W&L’s 16
fraternities as well as similair
donations from local merchants
and other interested _in-
dividuals. Bates is looking to
collect over $500 for the area’s
United Way drive. Interested
individuals who would like to

Despite being on their home
course this past Homecoming
Weekend, the cross country
Generals dropped three meets.

Washington and Lee scored 70
points, while Bridgewater
scored 58, Roanoke 54, and
Eastern Mennonite 28.

The first place time of 25:54,
turned in by a Bridgewater run-
ner, was the second fastest time
run on the course. The course
record is 25:21.

“IT ran my best race ever,”’
were the words of W&L’s first
place finisher, co-captain Bob
Bates. Bates’ time of 27:00 plac-
ed him fifth overall and was 35
seconds off the W&L record: for
the five mile run.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Election chaos

Almost anyone who has run for a student office on
this campus will tell you that there isn’t much “red
tape” involved. Fifty names on a petition, a quick ac-
count of your campaign expenditures to the E.C., and
you're there. The whole idea is to give the candidate
more time te present his views to the students.

Sounds pretty easy, doesn’t it? Well, I thought so,
too — until last Monday’s freshman elections. Only
seventeen freshmen presented petitions for the four
class offices, a figure low in itself, compared to recent
years. But the real clincher was that over 50% of
these names had to be dropped from the ballot,
because those candidates neglected to file a cam-
paign expense record with the E.C. Sunday night.

Several candidates protested the omission of their
names from the ballot, and the point was raised that
the Honor System alone should sufficiently curb any
violations of the spending limit. Even so, I feel the
report requirement has more to do with responsibility
than honor. Almost all the candidates were present
when the E.C. requested this report; announcements
were also made in the Phi and the E.C. minutes. And
the ludicrous point is that they only had to account for

‘a spending limit of $7.50. The question arises: if a can-
didate can’t perform such a small task, do you really
want him handling your affairs?

Evidently, such small matters as responsibility
meant very little to the voters. The result of Monday’s
ballot was the most confusing array of ‘“‘write-in”’
votes in recent memory. Voters seemed to have dif-
ficulty remembering who was running for what of-
fice; some write-in contenders received votes in two
or three different races. One can’t help thinking that
if these candidates had been a little more on the ball,
a lot of confusion would have been avoided. At least,
the voters could tell if they were casting the right vote
for the right position. Oddly enough, voters really ap-
preciate that courtesy.

At the E.C. meeting that night, the fog began to lift.
The Voting Regulations Board has been given one
month to establish a revised set of election guidelines,
including a requirement that candidates attend the
rule-setting meeting when petitions for office are due.
The committee then. turned to the business of
freshman run-off elections, scheduled for today. (As a
result of Monday’s fiasco, not one freshman can-
didate received a necessary majority.) Write-in votes
were declared void for the run-offs — a wise move.
Without this restriction, freshman elections (and con-
fusing write-ins) could have continued indefinitely.

Freshmen should thank the E.C. for clearing up this

mess, but the problem is still a disturbing one. The ©

spirit of responsibility and initiative was sadly lack-
ing in this freshman campaign — and that’s not the
road to effective leadership.

tivities taking place outside the
city limits.

IFC president Jim Davis said
that he was not aware of rule’s
existence, but Assistant Dean of
Students Dan Murphy said that
the rule had been ‘‘there for
years” and that the dorm
counselors are responsible for
IFC rules. He added that the
rules ‘“‘must be enforced, or the
IFC Judicial Board will be a
joke.”

The Board voted a $100 fine on
the basis that the pledging ac-
tivity took place outside Lex-
ington.

The Delt fine

In other Judicial Board
business, Delta Tau Delta ap-
pealed their fine of $100 for
“ungentlemanly conduct’ at
the Lambda Chi Alpha house
assessed last week.

All of the Delts involved in the
incident were present at the
meeting, except one, as were
several members of Lambda
Chi.

Delt Ross Germano said that
two Lambda Chi’s had invited
Delts to come to their party. He
said that they were just talking
to girls when Keith Romich, a
Lambda Chi, asked them to
leave.

Before they could leave,
though, Romich returned and
said that they could stay and
that he had ‘‘flown off the han-
dle.”

Then another Lambda Chi,
Herb Jennings, asked them to
leave. Germano said the Delts
left as a group and that he did
not hear any abusive phrases
yelled at the Lambda Chi’s.

(In previous testimony, the
Lambda Chi’s claimed that the
Delts had yelled obscenities at
the Lambda Chi’s when leaving.

Dean William J. Heffernam will be on your campus
on Friday, October 27, 1978 to speak with students
from all disciplines who are interested in the
M.B.A. and Ph.D. degree programs. Twelve con-

ture, Engineering, International Affairs, Jour-

None of the Delts said they
remembered any yelling by the
group. )

Romich commented that not
everything had been said. He
said he had been told that there
were Delts ‘‘dirty rushing” the
house. He said he was ‘‘afraid
they were going to start
something’’ and approached
some of the Delts.

Delt John Boger claimed that
it was then that Romich shoved
Germano. Romich denied this,
but did admit to calling Boger
‘“‘an asshole”’ and then apologiz-
ing and inviting them to stay.

John Kisalus, a Kappa Alpha,
testified that he saw the Delts
leave Lambda Chi and come
across the street to KA. He said
that he heard no yelling and
that none of the Delts seemed
obnoxious at the time. This was
contrary to testimony from
Lambda Chi at last week’s
hearing.

Lambda Chi Jennings then
testified that Delt Angus Finney
had yelled across the party,
“Come on everyone, the Delts
are getting out of here.” Finney
admitted to doing this, and
several Lambda Chi’s said that
his yell constituted a distur-
bance.

Delt Mike Foley asked,
‘“‘When you kick a bunch of guys
out of a house, how do you ex-
pect not to have a_ distur-
bance?’’ Finney added that he
did not see where the problem
lay, as he felt the two houses
were not competing during rush
and that the Delts were not try-
ing to “‘steal girls” (as Lambda
Chi charged) since the Delts
were not having a party that
night; they were just telling
girls about a party the next
week, Finney said.

The IFC president ended the

discussion by commenting that
this was the third time evidence
had been presented in this case,
and the delegations from Delt
and Lambda Chi left the room
so the Board could reach a deci-
sion.

IFC vice-president Rich Huek
started the discussion by say-
ing,’ ‘Frankly, I don’t see what
all the commotion was about.”’

Charles Terry said that as
had been pointed out before, the
two houses had different defini-
tions of behavior. Davis added
that the Board would have to
determine the extent of the
“ungentlemanly _conduct’’
charge.

Thistlethwaite noted the
discrepancies in the testimonies
from the two houses. Davis sup-
ported this by referring to con-
flicting testimony about yelling
at the party: the Lambda Chis
said there was, the Delts said
there was not.

Dean Murphy suggested a
revote, adding that any appeals
would go before the Student Af-
fairs Committee, a group made
up of administration, faculty,
and students. -

Chris Volk moved to keep the
fine as it stood, but Freddy
Moore disagreed, saying that
there was not “‘any solid basis
to lay a fine.”’

Volk replied that he felt
guests should keep manners

‘within the rules of the fraternity

they visit. Sid Farrar said he
felt the case was ‘“‘wishy-

washy.’’ Moore added that the
Board ‘‘can’t fine someone on

wishy-washy evidence.”’

The motion to retain the fine
was voted down, and Davis sug-
gested ‘‘making a warning so
we’ll have something to show.”
The Board decided that because
the Delts were invited they had
a right to be at the Lambda Chi
house, but that such action by
the Delts in the future will not
be tolerated in thefuture.

The Delts were ‘“‘reprimand-

ed” for ‘unruly behavior”
rather than ‘“ungentlemanly
behavior.” Davis explained

that the charge stemmed from
the ambiguities and discrepan-
cies in the testimony which

caused the Board to decide that
what occurred ‘‘was not so
ungentlemanly.”

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee can vote to hear a case after
reading a report from the IFC
or if one of the parties involved
appeals. Lambda Chi indicated
they they will appeal the deci-

sion.

The Judicial Board also
decided to send a letter to the
fraternities reminding them
that pledging activities, in-
cluding kidnapping and
‘trashing’ of rooms, are il-
legal in that the fraternities are
not allowed to do anything that
will interfere with a freshman’s

studying or life in the dorms.

parties have become the rage,
we must not forget that at least
one fraternity at W&L has been
staging its own toga party for
many millenia.

This film depicts college at-
mosphere as it was in 1962, yet
many viewers relate it to
modern college life, while
others react with disdain at the
fact that today’s students are
trying to act like people in 1962.
The point is that the film cap-
tures a way of life and a spirit
which could exist on any college
campus in any era.

Anybody who has ever heard
of college can appreciate the
humor of Animal House. John
Belushi, already a _ popular
figure from NBC’s Saturday
Night, steals the show. It’s hard
to tell where his character
separates from his actual per-
sonality. The college backdrop
is just a vehicle for Belushi, who
could get laughs in any situa-
tion.

The point is that Animal
House is one of those rare
movies which speaks to
everyone, not because of its
cinematic techniques (which
are very adequate) but because
of the fact that no matter what
college you go to, have been to,
or have even heard of, the
movie hits you right where
you live.
