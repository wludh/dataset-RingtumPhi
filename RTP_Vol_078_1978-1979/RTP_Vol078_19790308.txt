EC Reduces
Scott’s Penalty

by David Greer

The suspension of censured

EC member Charlie Scott was
shortened by two weeks by the
Student Executive Committee
Monday night.
Junior representative Steve
Abraham said he felt that the
month suspension of freshman
representative Chariie Scott
was too long and should be
shortened.

Scott was suspended for a
month last week for talking
about an honor violation in-
vestigation to the student in-
volved.

Abraham said he felt Scott
had made ‘‘an honest mistake”’
and that ‘‘a month was too long
for the EC to be without a
representative and a class to be
without a representative.”

Abraham proposed lessening
the suspension, adding, ‘‘If the
committee doesn’t feel what I
say is correct, we should ap-
point the president of the
freshman class to fill in.”

Senior representative Rob
Calvert, who initiated the pro-
ceedings against Scott last
week, said it ‘‘was not a per-
sonal attack on Charlie’ and
that he stood by the four week
suspension.

Sophomore representative
Will Mackie said, ‘‘We do have
the power to fill vacancies’ on

the committee, but that here
“the EC does not have a vacant
post — it’s a new issue about a
temporary issue.”

Mackie added, ‘‘We have
achieved what we wanted and
shown how serious we are.”’

The EC voted 9-2 to allow
Scott to return to his duties on

the EC after next week’s
meeting.
Sophomore representative

Bob Willis said later that he was
not in favor of reducing the
penalty, but he was less in facor
of having the freshman class
without a representative for a
month.

In other business, the
lacrosse team said they wanted
the $109 back that the EC gave
to the Muscular Dystrophy
Committee on their behalf last
week.

The EC had been given the
$109 when it loaned the team
money to go to Florida. When
the team paid off the loan, the
EC voted to give the $109 to MD.

Lacrosse team tri-captain
Sandy McDonald said that the
team had not intended to give
the money to MD, that it had
raised the money in the Cockpit
with the MD committee. The
two organizations were to split
proceeds from the function in
the Cockpit.

Participants In MD

Dance Marathon Needed

 

An all-expense paid trip to
Disney World is the prize for the
person who raises the most
money for the Dance Marathon.

In discussing the Marathon,
coordinator Jay Blumberg,
urges anyone who has registra-
tion forms to return them. The
forms should be given to Carol
Chappell.

Blumberg added that he is not
worried by the small number of
participants, two or three, at
this time. He attributes the pro-
blem to people’s concern with
Fancy Dress.

In order to boost participation
a fraternity Field Day is
scheduled for the Friday of the
marathon. Events include a pie-
eating contest, an egg toss anda
tug-of-war.

Fraternities have made other
efforts to help. Pi Kappa Phi
postponed its formal, scheduled
for that weekend. Sigma Chi did
not, because it had already
scheduled a band and reserved
facilities in Richmond.

Blumberg also plans to ask
fraternities not to have parties
that weekend.

tage of the weekend is on pages 6 and 7.

IFC Holds Election Monday

by John Billmyre

The I.F.C. announced its elec-
tion schedule Tuesday night.

On Thursday night (tonight)
nominations will be taken for
the offices of president and vice
president. The election will be
held the following Monday at
the time of the Big Three elec-
tion.

Houses are allowed to have
only one representative in the
election.

Nominations for Judicial
Board will be taken at Tues-
day’s IFC meeting.

Pi Kappa Alpha president
Frank Ellerby was issued a
summons at 1:30 Sunday morn-
ing for violating Lexington’s
noise ordinance. —

However, progress seems to
have been made in the noise or-
dinance situation despite the
Pika summons. Instead of ar-
resting fraternity presidents
upon receiving complaints this
weekend, Lexington police
issued warnings. Summons
were issued only after a warn-
ing.

According to Interfraternity
Council president Jim Davis

“Three houses were warned,

two turned their systems down,

one didn’t.”” Pika was the only

house to receive a summons
weekend.

Also scheduled at Tuesday’s
meeting was a plan to donate
kegs for the Dance Marathon.
Davis said, ‘‘We are asking you
to donate a keg per house and
it’s the only contribution we’re
asking.”

Fraternity representatives
were also presented with a let-
ter designed to obtain informa-
tion concerning fraternity con-
ditions.

Two questions are posed in

the letter: “1. Do you feel there
are any problems in your
fraternity as it functions now?
2. What can be done to solve
these problems?”’

Presidents were reminded to
keep in mind different aspects
of their fraternities such as in-
spections, police, I.F.C., SAC,
morale, behavior and internal
discipline.

The I.F.C. has requested a
one- to two-page reply which the
Judicial Board will relay to

President Huntley.

Davis said he _ hopes
presidents “‘realize the implica-
tions of this letter.”’

Big Three Election
Set For Monday

Two students filed petitions to the student. Ex-
ecutive Committee for the Big Three election next
Monday and another announced his candidacy late

Tuesday.

Junior Steve Abraham filed a petition to run for

next year’s student

body president.

Junior

Christopher Burnham announced that he is also runn-
ing for president as a write-in candidate.

Junior Les Cotter filed a petition with the EC to run
for vice-president. There were no petitions filed for
the secretary’s position at Monday’s EC meeting.

Late Wednesday, Cove Geary announced that he
would be a write-in candidate for the secretary’s posi-

tion.

EC vice-president Bill Tucker said in Monday’s EC
meeting that he was “extremely disappointed, not in
the quality of applicants we got, but in the lack of par-

ticipation.”’

The candidates will give speeches tonight in Lee
Chapel at 7. The elections will he held Mandav

Candidates For Presidency Square Off On Issues

Steve Abraham

“I was disappointed by .the small
number of candidates,’ said Steve
Abraham, one of two students seeking
election as student body president. ‘‘I was
looking forward to a competitive race.”

Abraham has served on the Executive
Committee for two years and now seeks
victory as one of the student government’s
“Big Three.’’ The election is March 12.

Apathy

“To a large degree, it’s apathy,” said
Abraham referring to the lack of student
involvement in elections. ‘“‘They just aren’t
that interested.”’

“IT think it’s forgetfulness as well as
apathy. One of my goals is to try and get
more students involved. The publicity
could have been better also,” said
Abraham.

Honor

“There is a gross lack of understanding
about honor code procedures,” said
Abraham. ‘‘People just don’t understand
how it works.”

‘“‘The honor code is what you make it,”’
he adds. “It’s one of the strongest in the
country. It doesn’t take too many bad ap-
ples though to discredit the system,” he
continued.

On whether Washington and Lee
gentlemen are responsible to the honor
code while intoxicated, Abraham said that
“it would depend on the particular situa-
tion.”

“TI could understand some situations
where the guy couldn’t be held accoun-
table for anything but I don’t think
students should use drugs or alcohol as a
scapegoat for their actions,’ Abraham
stated. ‘‘I see this as an issue that could be
spelled out more clearly by the E.C. to the
student body.”

“A student represents Washington and
Lee in the surrounding community and
should act as a_ gentleman,’ said
Abraham.

A felony is viewed as unacceptable by
that community. Grand larceny is viewed
as bad in both communities but ‘‘mari-
juana is viewed more toleratnly in a col-
lege society than elsewhere.”’

“IT think the question should have been
addressed to the E.C.”’ added Abraham.

Grade Review

“The issue of grade review is a perfect
example of student apathy,’ states
Abraham. “If people were a lot more
outspoken or demonstrated more of a need
to do something,” he adds, something
might have been accomplished.

“I think the comaraderie of the faculty
limits its success,’ said Abraham. “It
would be very hard for a grade review pro-
gram at Washington and Lee. It is becom-
ing more of an issue,”’ he continues, ‘‘but I
think a true need for grade review should
be shown.”

Admissions

“T have talked to a few people up in the
office,’’ said Abraham while speaking
about student involvement in admissions.

“Hartog is doing a lot of positive things

. to upgrade the recruitment process, I

think it’s something the school desperately
needs,” he adds. ‘‘At the same time I see
recruitment straying away from the stu-
dent body.’’

“You can get the academics almost
anywhere if you apply yourself. A big plus
of the school is. the friends you have and
the people you meet,’’ he said. “I think
visitors notice that.”

More E.C. Reps

“T definitely have done a lot of thinking
on that,’’ said Abraham while speaking on
law school and freshman representatives.
“It’s something that is talked about almost
every year.”’

“] think if you look at the history of law
students on the committee,” Abraham
said, “‘only two or three have fulfilled their
whole terms. It has been disruptive to the
EC.”

ae

    

a

   

‘“‘There’s a learning process involved,”
Abraham continued. “‘You must be aware
of all procedures in order to do a good
job.”’

“If the law school is about 300, I think
two representatives adequately represent
their views,’’ he said.

Freshmen are encountering Washington
and Lee’s honor code, probably for the
first time, said Abraham.

“They miss committee appointments
and the general tone-setting period for the
committee which comes in the spring,’’ he
said.

“There is a period of assimilation for the
whole freshman class and I don’t think two
freshman representatives would alter the
situation or benefit the system.”’

EC Funding of
Varsity Sports

“The only time when it should be done is
when it is a loan with a time stipulation,”
said Abraham referring to E.C. funding of
varsity sports.

“T would be against it in the future,”’ he
added, ‘‘because it could be used as an
argument later. People could point to that
loan this year and say a precedent was
set.”

Only when “all other avenues for
revenue have been exhausted,’’ should an
organization request funds from the E.C.
“A raffle could have been held,’’ adds
Abraham. Two students could have been
picked to go to Florida with the team.

Fraternities

Speaking on noise and fraternities
Abraham said that “I think from the
beginning of the year there has been an ef-
fort on the part of fraternities to behave
themselves and realize their respon-
sibilities.”

“The city forced the issue in a bad way
by enforcing it (Lexington’s noise or-
dinance). It could have been handled in a
better way,”’ he added.

“The city and the fraternities should get
together and straighten this out. I can see
the role of the E.C. president involved in
this situation,” Abraham said.

Coeducation

“What do I think about coeducation?”
asks Abraham. ‘‘Well I think logistically,
the cost of transforming this campus so it
could ideally house women and men at the
same time might be fairly expensive.”

“T think it is something the school should
seriously look into. The real need of
women here is for the academic
pressures.”’

‘“‘Washington and Lee has a strong tradi-
tion — very few all-male colleges are left
in the country. I think a lot of alumni enjoy
that reputation. I would hate to see the
academic standing of the school drop,” he
said.

Abraham ended his interview by stress-
ing one point he thought needed mention-
ing.

“IT have always been an advocate of
opening meetings in students government.

We should be accessible and accountable
to the students always,” he added.

“The student body should be aware
when all student meetings are held. What
we need is more involvement.”’

Abraham was interviewed by Ring-tum Phi
staff writer Joe Scott.

 

Christopher
Burnham

Christopher Burnham is the write-in
candidate for student body president who
joined the race late Tuesday.

Burnham, a junior, is a transfer student
from the University of Connecticut, where
he studied for two years before working
last year on Capital Hill.

His qualifications for the office of presi-
dent are that he was president of the Con-
necticut University Assembly for two
years.

“In this assembly, we _ practiced
Parliamentary debate and I had first-
hand experience with Roberts Rules of
Order, which I have a firm command of,”
he said.

“Additionally, this fall I was appointed
Liberal Party Leader of the W&L
Parliamentary Union in an attempt to br-
ing a Parliamentary Union to W&L.”’ He
feels that his experience in Congress has
given him a ‘good feeling for Parliamen-
tary procedure.”

“My experience with W&L is limited to
the time I have been here, but I don’t
think that would be a hindrance to my be-
ing a conscientious president,’ Burnham
said.

He said that as an independent, he could
adaquately represent both independents
and fraternity members.

“TI have a number of friends in frater-
nities and I once considered joining a
fraternity,’’ he said of his abilities to
represent fraternity members.

Fraternity Problems

“T’m as familiar with the fraternity
system as any fraternity member,” Bur-
nham said.

“The town of Lexington owes a great
deal to Washington and Lee and it’s time
for them to realize our existence as
members of the community.

“The fraternities have done all the ben-
ding and the town has remained stead-

fast. It’s time for the administration to ex- .

ert more pressure on the town.

“I would lead a concerted effort to peti-
tion the administration with all the frater-
nities to act on their behalf to enjoin the
City Council’ to relax the noise or-
dinance, he said.

He wants to get all fraternity members
to lobby the faculty and the administra-
tion to exert pressure on the town about
fraternity noise problems.

Honor

“It is my understanding that W&L has
the most workable honor code in the coun-
try. Are we ineffective because a half
dozen students must leave each fall?

“I’m worried about the increase in
thefts on campus. There has to be an ef-
fort on the part of the students to under-
take the responsibility of seeing the honor
code implemented. There can be no
lassez-faire attitude” (regarding the
honor code).

“Some will say that the honor code
stops at the W&L property line. I
disagree. The honor code applies
throughout the private community of Lex-
ington.

“‘When you leave this campus, you go
out as a representative of the school, and
your actions, good or bad, will reflect on
the school. You must always remember
you commitment to the honor code,” Bur-
nham said.

“‘Insobriety is no excuse (for breaching
the honor code),”’ he said.

Grade Review

“The faculty has rejected the last (stu-
dent) EC proposal for a five-member
faculty grade review board.”” Burnham
feels that a process through which the stu-
dent tries to resolve his grade dispute
with the department head and his own ad-
visor may be more acceptable to the
faculty.

“Again, the faculty must bend with us
and meet us. They must compromise here
as we are doing,” he said.

EC Funding of
Varsity Sports

“T was pleased that the Executive Com-
mittee could act in the capacity of loaning
the lacrosse team the necessary funds for
its trip to Florida. I am not in favor of con-
tinual loans or grants by the EC to the
athletic program.

“T think in this case, though, it was a
very noble gesture, a gesture well taken,
and in this one case, a solid decision. This
year’s case was a special exception,”’
Burnham said.

“TI do not feel it was precedent setting
and I do not foresee other teams coming
to the EC for funds. It’s just not the proper
avenue for grants. If the lacrosse team
comes again next year, I would be wary of
giving it funds,”’ he said.

Coeducation

“Tam more worried about our commit-
ment to a high standard of excellence in
our students than this question of
coeducation,”’ Burnham said.

He feels that with the general decline in
the number of college students in the
country, W&L may either have to lower
adminissions standards or admit women
to keep up enrollment.

. “Tradition must not stand in the way of
academic excellence,” he said.

More EC Reps

Burnham is in favor of the freshman
class having two EC representatives and
the law school having three.

“Freshmen are as much a part of the
community as anyone else. They are not
second-class citizens.

“I feel strongly that the law school
should have three (representatives on the
EC). How can you deny an entire class
representation?”’ he asked.

Burnham would also like to give in-
dependents “‘a place to go.” He would like
to see the development office made into a
social house for students not in frater-
nities.

Such an action would lessen the
“animosity between fraternity members
and independents,’’ Burnham said.
Burnham was interviewed by Ring-tum Phi
staff writer Randy Smith.

 

 
Cotter Unopposed For Vice President

Les Cotter, junior class presi-
dent, is running unopposed for
vice-president of the student
body. He calls the situation of
running unopposed unfortunate,
and says he looks at that aspect

of the election with ‘mixed
emotions’’.
Cotter said that he was

especially disturbed by there
being no candidates for
secretary, saying, ‘“You really
need someone who’s capable or
the rest of the committee won’t
click.”’
’ He attributed the lack of
registered candidates not to
apathy as much as to the idea
that “people just don’t think
they can bea part of it.”’
Honor

When asked whether a Honor

student found guilty of a felony

in a court of law is also guilty of
a breach of the honor code, Cot-
ter said that each case should
be considered individually.’

Cotter said that he did not
know enough about the recent
case of a student being found
guilty of a felony on drug
charges to pass judgement on
that case.

Cotter did say that he felt the
honor code at Washington and
lee is very strong and he plans
to keep the honor system ‘‘fully
intact.”

“There are certain gray
areas that perhaps the orienta-
tion program could clear up,”’
he said. He feels that there is
some problem with applying the
honor system to ‘“‘small viola-
tions”. “Students have to take
the initative to enforce the

University Council
discusses grade review

The University Council met

last week to discuss the latest
suggested changes in the pro-
posed grade review plan but
failed to make any endorsement
of the change.
' The faculty’s major com-
plaint stemmed from their feel-
ing that there is no real need for
a grade review plan, and
especially one that would create
a Standing committee.

Dr. Gary H. Dobbs said that
there would be: potential for
abuse of students, but that does
not mean that there is abuse. He
said, ‘‘Let those who have been
abused stand up.”’

Neal Brickman, second year
law representative, asked how
the EC can demonstrate that
there is a problem with grading.

He offered to create a ‘“‘search
committee”’ to find some cases
where students feel they have
been treated unfairly.

Professor Larry Boetsch
said, ‘“There is a proceedure for
appealing a grade, and that is to
go to the professor involved.”’

Dean Edward C. Atwood said
that last semester 29 grades
were changed for students.

Dean of Students Lewis John
said there is ‘considerable
faculty sentiment that the pre-
sent system is adequate.”

The council closed the
meeting, taking no action
regarding the proposal to
create a grade review commit-
tee. Earlier word changes,
iy will go before the facul-

honor system,’’ he said.

‘Each student has to be on
guard against violations, keep
his eyes and ears open,” he
said. ‘‘The only way to do this is
for each student to keep in mind
his duties under a system of
honor.”’

As for students being respon-
sible for the honor code when in-
toxicated, Cotter said, ‘‘You’re
still responsible for your ac-
tions; you’re still the same per-
son.”

Cotter feels the honor system
here is unique and “‘not even
like the real world.”’

EC Funding Of
Varsity Sports

Cotter does not believe in
blanket EC funding of varsity
sports. Each case must be con-
sidered individually, he says.

“If an athletic team was so
desperate that it would have to
ask the EC for money, the EC
should take a good hard look at
the case before just giving out
the money.”

Grade Review

As for the grade review, Cot-
ter says he doesn’t know if the
present grade review policy is
even necessary.

“You always have com-
plaints,” he said, “I wonder
how legitimate the complaints
are.”

“T can see both sides,

- though,” he said, ‘I think the

EC has made the right deci-
sion.”
Fraternities

Cotter, a fraternity member,
is concerned about fraternity
relations with the town. He sees
a problem in that ‘‘fraternities
and townspeople are trying to
live together, and their
lifestyles are not the same.’

He says there are problems
with the noise ordinance in that

once a fraternity is presented
with a summons it has no
recourse.

“It is obvious from all the

summons that have _ been
issued, the fraternities are not
living harmoniously with the
townspeople, ‘‘Cotter said.
However, he said he was pleas-
ed with the small number of
summons issued recently.
Running On His Record

Cotter says he really isn’t
running on any particular plat-
form as he has no opposition
that has challenged him on any
issues.

“I’m running on my record,”
he said, ‘The vice-president’s
two main duties are to perform

 

the functions of the president in
his absence and be in charge of
dispersement of money to stu-
dent body agencies.”

Cotter says he has taken ac-
counting courses and has serv-
ed as president of both his
sophomore and junior classes.
He says he tries to keep up with
EC proceedings and reads the
EC minutes.

Cotter says he doesn’t agree
with closing meetings just to
keep information away from
students. ‘‘If the students might
benefit from open meetings
they should be open,”’ he said.

Cotter was interviewed by Ring-
tum Phistaff writer David Greer.

Lord of the Rings

An Animated Controversy

by Dick Barron

Ralph Bakshi is America’s
whiz-kid animator. Some say he
took over where Disney left off.
His film career got its break
with Fritz the Cat, the first X-
rated animated film to be
distributed by Hollywood. He
later went on to produce two
relatively unsuccessful films,
Heavy Traffic and Coonskin.
Then Twentieth Century-Fox
picked up Bakshi’s Wizards,
which established him as a
popular success.

Bakshi’s innovative techni-
ques have at once added
creative sparks to the anima-
tion industry and provided con-

troversial subjects for the
critics. His latest film, The Lord
of the Rings, is typical Bakshi
on an inflated scale.

J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord
of the Rings, trilogy has been
approached and avoided by
many animators, including
Walt Disney, who found the
story too complex for easy
translation into film. Bakshi
eventually took on the project
and the result is an important,
but fully chaotic film.

Bakshi’s major innovation
this time was that he shot the
entire movie with live actors
before actually animating the
scen scenes. The animation was

It’s another bout of comedy for Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier as
they return from UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT. J.J. Walker, from
T.V.’s Good Times plays Bootner Farnsworth who has punchlines
that'll break ribs, but no more boxing jab than a gnat. The hilarious
action begins when he’s set up in a title boxing match and bets are
laid with mobsters. There's plenty of fancy footwork and a contest

The Night of the Living Dead

For ten years, The Night of the Living Dead has been terrorizing
its willing victims at midnight showings with visions of can-
nibalism and carnage, its army of resurrected corpses creeping
across the screen in search of human flesh. Made in 1968 and
almost unnoticed, the film sank into the flickering world of the
underground, where it took root like a mutated mushroom. In
theaters from Tokyo to Paris to Madrid to New York it began play-
ing, often in special performances after the last regular feature,
until it beeame a bona fide cult movie for a burgeoning band of
blood-lusting cinema buffs.

What gives the film its special chill is the banality of the enemy.
The monster here is not some giant order of coleslaw gone mad, but
average citizens turned malevolent. And when the army of com-
mon folk gets its victims, the camera, far from shying away, zooms
in for details of the depraved consuming a handful of intestine,
devouring a heart, licking ona lung.

(In addition, the film contains one of this editor's favorite
cinematic scenes, an interview with a dim-witted sheriff. To such
questions as ‘‘How do you kill them?" he answers ‘‘Beat ‘em or
burn 'em — kill the brain, kill the ghoul -- they don't move real
quick; they're dead you know.”’)

Eye And Car:

then drawn from these live
shots, giving the film = an
unusual life-like quality.
However, the effect in many
places was one of simply tinted,
or off-color live action intruding
into the animation and ruining
any sense of consistency.

The live action animation pro-
cess has been used in other
Bakshi films, namely Wizards,
with virtually the same messy
effect. Regardless of the
splashy visuals one might get
from this technique, it seems as
if Bakshi is cheating when he
calls it animation all the time.

For example, there is one
scene, a battle, which looks as if
Bakshi took an old adventure
film and added a psychedelic
tint to it— its very similar to the
effect one gets when he tempers
with the controls on a color T.V.
set — Walter Cronkite gets a
purple face.

Real Animation

Flip remarks aside, there is a
solid content of ‘‘real’’ anima-
tion in the film. Especially ap-
pealing was the Gollum
character—the green, slimy
creature who begs for “my
precious” ring.

The animation is not nearly so
annoying as the screenplay.
The muddy, complex scripting
seems to suffocate the action of
the film. Granted, The Lord of
the Rings is a complicated story
even for avid readers of
Tolkien. The point is that
writers Chris Conkling and
Peter S. Beagle were not
careful enough in shaping a
lucid script — they obviously
assumed the audience was fully
aware of the storyline.

This coupled with the fact
that many of the characters
resembled one another visually,
was cause for much confusion.
There may not be a solution for
this problem, still, one wonders
why it went wrong. There was
certainly enough space for the
telling of the story, as the film
ran a hefty two hours and
eleven minutes.

Edvard Munch

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee
University Film Society will
present Peter Watkins’ Edvard
Munch on Friday and Saturday,
March 9th and 10th. Showings
will take place in classroom
“C”™ of the Law School at 8 p.m.
Admission is free.

Watkins’ magnificent 1976
color film is based on the life of
Edvard Munch, the Norwegian
painter who is now considered
one of the seminal figures of
modern art, the founder, with
Van Gogh, of the Expressionist
movement in painting.

Scorn and Controversy

The movie shows the scorn
and controversy which greeted
Munch's work at the end of the
19th century, and the emotional,
sexual, and artistic tensions he
himself suffered in achieving
his breakthrough. Similarly,
the movie itself breaks through
our expectations about the
limits of cinema by weaving
together biography,
psychology, history, sociology,
pictorial analysis, and fictional
interviews in a daring canvas of
Munch's life, art, and times.

Consumption

Consumption was the major
dread disease of the 19th cen-
tury, the way that cancer is the
dread disease of our own time.
Because tuberculosis has now
been virtually eradicated, we
cannot quite grasp its terrors
even though we know that many
famous people and many
characters we have read about

in literature were among its vic-
tims.

By making frighteningly real
what it was like to die of con-
sumption, the movie further
helps us to understand what life
was like at the end of the last
century.

tnguish and Anxiety

Munch’s paintings, especially
“The Scream,” express the
isolation, anguish, and anxiety
which characterize the way in
which 20th century man very
largely thinks of himself. In the
tradition of New Wave film-
making, the movie makes use of
a-chronological time — se-
quences, time sequences whose
order is fractured and associa-
tional rather than rational and
normatively continuous, to sug-
gest Munch's tormented inner
state as he engaged in. the
creative process.

Living Was Torture

What we get is a picture of a
man for-whom living in the pre-
sent was torture. Unable to con-
trol his associations, Munch is
constantly retreating from ob-
jective reality, from the situa-
tions which his body occupies,
into a mental world which is ut-
terly dominated by his past. He
is the quintessential modern
man: trapped inside of his own
head.

Next in the Film Society's
series will be Orson Welles’
Falstaff, which is based on
Shakespeare's Henry IV adn V
plays. It is scheduled for Friday
and Saturday, March 30 and 31.

Concert Guild Presents:
Stradivari String Concert

The Stradivari String
Quartet, the noted chamber
music ensemble currently in
residence at the University of
Iowa, will present a concert of
works by Haydn, Shostakovich,
and Schuman next Tuesday,

March 13. The concert will
begin at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel,
and is sponsored by the
Washington and Lee Concert
Guild.

The 19year-old ensemble
consists of faculty members at

Musical Mainstream

bu Mark Mainwaring and Robin Meredith

Michael Franks
Tiger in the Rain
Warner Brothers BSK 3294

Michael Franks is one of
those people, in the grand tradi-
tion of Melanie and the Grateful
Dead, who seem to inspire
either undying love or pas-
sionate hatred in their listeners.
I can recall-sitting around with
a group of friends when ‘‘Popsi-
cle Toes’’, a minor novelty hit of
his from a few years back,
came on the radio.

Half of the folks present went
out for a beer run, claiming
they ‘“‘couldn’t take it any
longer,’’ while the rest found
themselves totally captivated
by Franks’ intriquing lyrics and
unique vocal mannerisms.

Well, I must admit, I was one
of the ones who left, but Tiger
in the Rain, Franks’ latest
release on Warner Bros., has
got me firmly under it’s spell.
Franks’ approach is very dif-
ficult to describe; if you can im-
agine Roberta Flack singing
slightly off-key in front of an
airy, almost tropical-sounding
jazz-based ensemble, with a
kinky lyricist thrown in to boot,
then you might have some idea
of just how original his sound is.

Unfortunately, despite all this
originality, Tiger in the Rain
presents one crucial problem;
in many places, it’s hard to tell
whether the record’s appeal
comes from Franks’ singing
and songwriting or from John
Simon’s superb arrangements.

Lifeline

“Lifeline” is a case in point;
one of the album’s weaker
songwriting efforts, it is also
one of its most enjoyable
moments, due mostly to Lou
Soloff’s delightful overdubbed
trumpet duet. Little things like
that keep popping up
throughout the record, doing
much to detract from Franks’
singular talents.

However, the fact remains

that Tiger in the Rain is a rare
commodity, that dreamy, laid-
back, rainy Saturday afternoon
record that you’d only listen to
once or twice a year, but that
sounds surprisingly perfect
whenever you do dig it out. Wait
a second, didn’t they used to

call this mood music???

The much-vaunted Who
autobiographical concert film is

due for release any day now.
“The Kids Are Alright’ was
originally supposed to arrive in
the theaters last spring, but a
number of delays have held it
up until now.

The movie features over 25

the University of Iowa School of
Music. Violinists Allen Ohmes
and Don Haines and violist
William Preucil are all
graduates of the Eastman
School of Music, and cellist
Charles Wendt is a graduate of
Juilliard and of Indiana Univer-
sity.

The Stradivari Quartet is well
known to Lexington audiences,
having - performed ‘here on
several occasions.- The group
has also performed works com-
posed by W&L’s_ Robert
Stewart, music professor and
Concert Guild director, on na-
tional radio and in concert.

The Stradivari Quartet uses
four of the most highly prized
instruments in the world — a set
for string quartet made by An-
tonio Stradivari in the 17th and
18th centuries. The set, owned
by the Corcoran Gallery in
Washington, D.C., has been on
loan to the ensemble since 1967.

The group’s Lee Chapel con-
cert will include Haydn’s String
Quartet no. 2, Shostakovich’s
String Quartet no. 8, and
Schuman’s String Quartet in A
major.

The public is invited to at-
tend.

A Photographic Study
Called “Social Realism”

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s fine arts department will
sponsor a lecture and reception
Friday, March 9, at 8 p.m. in du-
Pont Hall.

Matthew Baigell, professor of
art history at Rutgers Universi-
ty, will deliver the lecture, en-
titled ‘‘Social Realism,’’ which
will take place in conjunction
with an_ exhibition of
photographs by Jacob Riis and
Lewis Hine in duPont Gallery
through March 23.

Baigell, who received his
master’s degree from Columbia
University and his Ph.D. from
the University of Pennsylvania,
is the 1977 recipient of Rutgers
University’s faculty merit
award.

He has written a number of
books and articles on American
painting and is currently com-
pleting a dictionary of
American art.

The reception will take place
in duPont Gallery following the

lecture program.

The gallery exhibition will in-
clude photographs of slum life
in New York City, taken by Riis
in the late 1800s, together with
photographs of child labor
abuses taken by Hine between
1908 and 1917 for the National
Child Labor Committee, ac-
cording to Pamela H.’ Simpson,
assistant professor of : art
history at Washington and Lee.

talents for bringing difficult
material to the screen. But
maybe Lord of the Rings is one
of those stories which will never
fully translate to film because it
possesses so many complicated
levels of sheer fantasy. We can
only hope that Bakshi will
return from this dream of glory
and make a movie that he can
really be proud of.

Generals Stun

Duke, 13-8 In B.V.

by Doug Linton
and Bill Whalen

If you were one of the
multitude that believed the E.C.
grant to the lacrosse team was
for naught, then now is the time
for you to eat your crow. The
Generals, looking impressive
for the second straight time,
rolled to a 13-8 victory over
Duke, yesterday in a game
played at Buena Vista.

The Generals’ second win of
the season was particularly
dramatic because it avenged
last year’s 12-10 loss in Durham.
“Having the field time (in
Florida) made the difference,”’
said coach Jack Emmer. ‘‘Duke
has as good a team as they had
last year, we’re just better.”

In the opening period,
however, this could not be said.
The Generals fell behind 2-0 un-
til goals by Sandy McDonald
and John Hooper left W&L trail-
ing 3-2 at the end of the period.

The second period belonged tu
the Generals. McDonald, John
Black and John Kemp each
scored once to build a 5-3 lead
by the halfway mark of the
game. Equally important was
the play of Devils in the entire
quarter.

After those three goals, the
Generals seemed to had lost
any early shakiness and settled
down to play their own style of
dominant forechecking. Geoff
Brent scored to make it 6-4.
Duke came back to score less
than two minutes later, but
Black netted his second goal of
the day with 9:20 left in the
period. Then Black’s All-
American teammate Jeff Fritz
scored less than thirty seconds

later to stun Duke. Another goal
by Black and one by middie
George Santos put W&L in an
insurmountable advantage at
11-6.

The two teams played evenly
in the fourth quarter as Hooper
scored his second goal and
Black added his fourth to close
out the scoring at 13-8, in favor
of Washington and Lee.

Overall, Black had four goals
while Fritz was limited to only
one goal but added four assists
to give him five points for the
day and 11 total points in only
two games. Likewise, Clements
had another outstanding game,
limiting the opponent to only
eight goals for the second
straight time.

Future Looks Bright
For Fencing Team

by Bill Sherwin

In what was unquestionably
their finest performance of the
year, Washington and Lee’s fen-
cing club thoroughly trounced
the Citadel’s varsity fencing
team by a score of 20-7. It was
the crowning achievement in
what has been a tremedous
year for the fencing squad.

In what was termed by coach
Dr. James Worth as their finest
performance of the year, the
sabre team, led by David
Garner and Bill Hill, shut out
Citadel by a score of 9-0. Both
Garner and Hill were
undefeated, winning all three of
their bouts. Fletcher
Harkrader, a first year fencer,
won both his bouts, and Dave
Bryant, in spite of a case of
asthma, won to complete an im-
pressive performance by the
sabremen.

In epee’, W&L won by a score
of 7-2, in spite of illness suffered
by squad leader Rob Earle, who

was unable to fence. The win- -

ners in epee were Bill Sherwin,
3-0, Dave Hepler, 2-1, and Paul
Nathan, who was also 2-1.

In foil, W&L dropped to the
Citadel by the score of 5-4.
Freshmen Steve King and Colt
Puryear went 1-1.

Team Captain Will Mackie

and sophomore John Stathakis
both went 1-1 on the afternoon.

Dr. Worth attributed the
tough foil competition to the
heavy substitution he made in
order to give some of the more
inexperienced fencers a chance
to fence. He had high praise for
the fencing team, which began
practice at the beginning of the
year and managed a_ 3-3-1
record in its first year of inter-
collegiate competition.

‘The team has really come a
long way this year. I am ex-
tremely pelased with the
dedication to the sport of fenc-
ing which they have shown
me.’’ Worth went on to praise
the team for fencing on difficult
weekends and over vacation,
pointing out that their sacrifice

was for a sport with only club
status.

‘This year the team posted vic-
tories over James Madison,
VMI, and the Citadel, while it
dropped two meets to UVa., and
one to Navy. Ina fencing exhibi-
tion match against James
Madison later in the year, the
team recorded a draw against
JMu, when only ' of the other
squad’s fencers showed up.

With the intercollegiate fenc-
ing season now at an end, the
fencers will now begin competi-
tion in local tournaments spon-
sored by the American Fencing
League of America. With the
valuable experience gained this
year and with the development
of its new talent, the fencing
squad is looking forward to an
impressive year next season.

Lax Team Wins First

start this season by smacking

nonetheless a fair crowd still
gathered to watch the game on
Saturday.

Washington and Lee jumped
to a quick lead, as they scored
the only four goals in the first
quarter. Chesapeake inched as
close as 5-3 by the middle of the
second, but the Generals led 6-3
at the half. From that point on,
Chesapeake never got any
closer than three, with the
Generals leading by as many as
five goals at three times during
the second half. The fourth
quarter proved to be the most
exciting and evenly matched,
with each team scoring four
times.

“We were very pleased,”
stated Coach Emmer. ‘We
were glad to win against a good
team this early in the season.”
But although the team is about
two weeks ahead of where it
would have been without the
Florida trip, Emmer and some
of his players felt that the of-
fense didn’t quite ‘‘flow.’’ Ap-
parently the team had better
executed its offensive tactics in
practice.

Both Emmer and the squad
are very optimistic. ‘‘I’m.sure it
can be better, and when we get
it there, I’m sure we’ll be a
much better team than we were
on Saturday,” said Emmer.

Saturday’s contest was only
an exhibition, but that fact
didn’t keep the Generals from
going all out. The tri-captains
led the scoring, in their usual
Style. Jeff Fritz had 3 goals and
3 assists to head the pack. John
Black also netted 3, and Sandy
McDonald wasn’t far behind
with his 2 goals and 1 assist.
Mike Pressler, John Kemp, Art
Caltrider, and Joe Olive all add-
ed single tallies, with Jim
Herbert, Geoff Brent, and John
Hooper each having an assist.

Goalkeeper Bob Clements
was simply superb; very few
stoppers ever look so sharp this
early in the season. He had 20
saves and allowed only 8 goals.
His consistent defense and
positive attitude could be a key
factor in the team’s success this
spring.

Rodgers Wrestles
In Div. IIT Tourney

Wrestling co-captain Ed
Rodgers, a senior from Mt.
Ephraim, N.J., was Washington
and Lee’s only participant in
the NCAA Division III National
Championships last weekend in
Arcata, California. Rodgers,
who was accompanied on the
trip by wrestling coach Gary
Franke, was defeated in the
first round by his Brockport
(N.Y.) State opponent.

Rodgers, who was named the
1978 ODAC Wrestler of the Year
and was also an all-conference
wrestler for the second con
secutive year, completed the

   
   
  

season with a 16-15-1 record. His
four-year mark at W&L now
stands at 54-27-3.

   

by Bill Whalen

Were the 1978-79 basketball
Generals a success or a failure?
It depends on whose standards
you follow. If you believe that a
winning Season means finishing
over .500, then this year was a
success. However, if you com-
pare this year’s record to those
of the past three seasons, then
the Generals’ combination of 17
wins and 10 losses was below
average. The likely answer is
that W&L’s season was a com-
bination of good and bad, with
neither prevailing.

In reviewing this season,
there were three key stages that
would determine how the team
would progress. The first mo-
ment came when the Generals
were 3-2. Having already lost
two ODAC games and facing a
four game road trip, W&L was
in an early hole. The second
time of crisis came when the
Generals were 8-5. At this time.
W&L had lost its third straight
ODAC game and_= second
straight loss following a 5-1 win-
ning streak. The third impor-
tant stage had to be when the
Generals were 16-7. W&L was
playing its best basketball otf
the season, had won seven
straight ODAC games to tie tor
second place and, with all the
players healthy, had a good
chance at winning the upcom
ing ODAC Tournament. Again
the Generals went on a four
game road trip but found op-
posite results from before by
losing three out of four to finish
witha 17-10 record.

If you like to second-guess
teams, then this group provides
many opportunities. For exam-
ple, what if Dave Leunig had
been healthy all season long?
Granted, Leunig did play in 21
games, but only in half of those
games did he play on two sound
knees. What if the Generals had
one steady lineup for the entire
season”? By the time W&L
Coach Verne Canfield found the
right combination, the season
was already 13 games through.
What if Ardie Collins had not
missed the final Lynchburg
game”? W&L might very well be
in the NCAA Tournament at this
time. And finally, what if the
Generals had won every game
they lost by six points or less?
Instead of being 17-10, . they
would be 22-5 and would have

tied with Hampden-Sydney for
the regular season title.

Of the thirteen members of
this squad, only four will not be
back. Captain Mike Wenke, this
year’s point guard, will be
replaced by junior Pete Farrell
and freshman George Spears
The other three seniors — Col-
lins, Leunig and Jim Berlin
leave the Generals with a lack
of height. Filling this void will
be sophomore Rob Smither

pounds and a shooting touch,
and freshman Travis Patter-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK ‘TI!

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Ill tidings...

It’s difficult to recall any recent event at W&L more
discouraging than the turn-out of candidates for Mon-
day’s “Big Three’’ elections. With only one official
candidate for both president and vice-president, and
none at all for secretary, the political field is the
smallest in recent memory. And judging by the
general lack of campus enthusiasm, it appears that
voter participation may also hit an all-time low point.

Student apathy is hardly a new arrival to this cam-
pus. Looking back, there have been more than a few
major examples this year alone. Voter turn-out was
under 30% in both the freshman and sophomore elec-
tions this year. Student interest in the EC’s grade
review plan has waned, causing that project to
flounder. After a brief spark of interest, the In-
dependents’ Union is again silent. The Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon reports that few students
have opted to give their time, though some weeks re-
main to make the affair a success. And worst of all,
the power and position of our fraternity system con-

tinues to deteriorate, despite valiant efforts by IFC of-

ficials.

Can this be the same university which mobilized
over 1,500 people to move library books on a day
without classes? The same campus which has an EC
noted this year for fairness and efficiency? The same
place where SAB members work around the clock for
Fancy Dress, and publications currently enjoy a
tremendous rise in size and quality? Hard to believe...

Strangely enough, the high ievel of responsibility
seen on campus this year is probably the main reason
for our latest outbreak of apathy. Controversy and in-
efficiency seem to be the only things that awaken the
student body — and by then it’s often too late for
repair. We admit that this year’s EC is going to be a
tough act to follow — but their success should inspire
others to get involved, not lull the student body into a
state of inertia. It is the duty of the students to carry
on the achievements of the current year. So, we en-
courage others to join Messrs. Abraham and Cotter in
the race as write-in candidates. Make your presence
known! Only in this way can we be assured of pro-
gress in the year ahead.

Letters To The

 

 

 

Fancy Dress pack-rats warned

Fellow Students:

The Fancy Dress Ball was a fun time for all
of us here at W&L, especially for those of us
on the SAB who saw our months of planning
and hard work fall into place last Friday
night. The decorations for the student center
required enormous amounts of creative
talent, patience, and money to assemble and
only a few short moments to disassemble
when the ball ended.

Some of the decorations were meant to be
taken as souveniers: posters, stickers, signs
— all the way to glittered trees and lamp-
posts. Other decorations, however, were not.
Specifically, the SAB would like returned im-
mediately the glittered man-in-the-moon and
his spoon (taken from “Studio 54’’) and the
two “‘I Love NY” sign boards (removed from
above the two entrances to the dining hall).
No questions will be asked if these are return-
ed to the SAB office within the week. If they
are not, their removal may become a matter
for the Executive Committee.

We thank the members of the student body
for their help in recovering these decorations.

Sincerely,
Douglas Jackson
Hank Hall

Dear Editor:

I have just finished reading the first ten
issues of this year’s Ring-tum Phi. I knew that
W&L would change during my year abroad,
but I never thought that what was known as
the Rag-tam Pon in past years could be
transformed into such an_ enjoyable
newspaper. Not only do the articles appear
unbiasde; they’re interesting. The old Phi has
even made me feel nostalgia for W & L. That’s
an accomplishment in itself. Keep up the
great work Gray, et al. As we say here in
Spain Enhorabuena! (Congrats! )

Independents’ study

A study is underway to deter-
mine whether Washington and
Lee should provide services for
non-fraternity students above
and beyond the services
already being offered. The
study is being conducted by a
committee composed of frater-
nity and independent students,
and members of the faculty. A
questionnaire has recently been
mailed to all independent
students to generate informa-
tion which can be used by the

committee in formulating
results. Students are urged to
complete their questionnaire
and return them to the Univer-
sity Center or place them in the
container in the Bookstore. The
committee needs this informa-
tion and earnestly requests all
students to return their ques-
tionnaire as soon as possible.
Extra copies of the question-

naire may be obtained in the.

In Memoriam

Dr. E.S. Gilreath

Professor of Chemistry

Esmarch Senn Gilreath, head
of the chemistry department at
Washington and Lee University
for 15 years until 1970 and a
member of the W&L faculty for
29 years, died at his home
Saturday evening. He was 74.

He is survived by his wife,
Sara Taylor Gilreath.

Prof. Gilreath was born Sept.
21, 1904, in North Wilkesboro,
N.C. He earned his A.B., M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry
from the University of North
Carolina, where he also taught
while working on his doctorate.
He spent a year as a research
chemist for American Enka
Corp. before joining the W&L
chemistry faculty in 1946. He
became department head in
1955 and returned to full-time
teaching in 1970. He retired in
1975.

He was the author of a
number of college-level
chemistry textbooks, including
‘‘Elementary Qualitative
Analysis’’ (1969), ‘“Experimen-
tal Procedures in Elementary
Qualitative Analysis’ (1968),
‘Fundamental Concepts of In-
“organic Chemistry” (1958) and

“Qualitative Analysis’ (1954,
translated into Spanish and
published in that language in
1960).

His scholarship and writing
were so highly regarded that
one publisher wrote to him in
1968: ‘‘We could seek further
critical opinions at this point,
but prefer to go right ahead
with copy editing without fur-
ther delay. We are confident of
the quality of the manuscript.”

The son of a physician, he was
particularly interested in
Washington and Lee’s_pre-
medical curriculum, and during
most of his teaching career he
was the university’s advisor to
pre-med students. ©

During the summers, Dr.
Gilreath was frequently a
visiting professor at other col-
leges, including the Univer-
sities of North Carolina, British
Columbia, and Oregon. .

“He was an effective teacher
- particularly in designing and
developing experiments for stu-
dent use,’ William J. Watt,
dean of The College at W&L and
a fellow chemistry professor,
had remarked upon Dr.
Gilreath’s retirement in 1975.

Fancy Dress Went Smoothly

Police Towed 14 Cars, Issued 62 Parking Tickets

by David Greer

Fancy Dress went smoothly
this year for almost everyone
concerned — the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the workers in
the Cockpit, and the revelers
who celebrated the event for the
entire weekend and most of last
week,

The real judgment comes
from those who had to come
face to face with any problems,
the ones who saw them all — the
Lexington Police Force.

The police’s judgment seems
to coincide with that of the
revelers — that everything
went very smoothly.

The main trouble the police
had was with traffic problems.
The police issued 44 tickets for
parking in restricted zones.

The Lexington police towed
nine illegally parked cars over
the weekend, but none were
towed Friday night during the
Fancy Dress Ball.

The State police were busy
towing cars, though, on Satur-
day afternoon at Zollman’s
pavillion.

Trooper W. J. Whitt said that
18 tickets were issued at the
pavillion. Five cars were towed
all the way to the station, and
several more were hooked to
the wrecker when claimed by
the owners.

Whitt said that residents com-
plain when cars are parked
along the road at the pavillion
every time there is a big party.
He said that there are no park-
ing signs out there, but they are
often stolen.

Lexington Police Officer Paul
A. Smothers called it ‘‘a real
good weekend’’ and said that
aside from the traffic, ‘“‘not too
much was out of hand.”

Smothers said people just
don’t seem to care where they
park at the parties, and find
their car ticketed or towed.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said that the weekend
wasn’t too bad, either. He
assigned extra men to work
both nights, though.

Normally he has three men
work the night shifts. This

weekend, he had seven men
working from 8 p.m. to4a.m.

Kirby said that there were
some problems with larcenies
this weekend. He said that a
pocketbook was stolen at the
Ball, and some items were
taken from the dorms last
week.

Kirby said that the students
were good about working with
the police, especially when ask-
ed to turn down music.

There were 51 complaints to
police during the weekend,
most about parking or noise,
Kirby said.

Officer Wayne Rhodenizer

said that the weekend was a lit-

_tle hectic, but “‘more organized
than just a party weekend.”’ He
pointed out that the police
issued 16 noise permits, when
on most big weekends they may
issue half as many.

Only one summons was
issued for violation of the noise
ordinance. Frank Ellerbe at the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity was
issued a summons at 1:30 a.m.
Sunday. -

Lt. C. H. Emore was the of-
ficer in charge of the night force
this weekend. He said that the
weekend could have been

worse, that things went
smoothly considering the
crowds.

EC Gives Lacrosse Team Back Its $109

Mackie suggested giving the
money to MD anyway’ but
senior law representative John
Murphy pointed out that the
money wasn’t the EC’s to give

The EC voted 9-1, with one
abstention, to give the money
back to the lacrosse team.

Contact member Tom Salley
said the McGovern-Rusher

Junior representative Dee
Keesler said some faculty
members had mentioned to him
that a grade review could cause
some teachers to change their
exams from an essay format to
multiple choice in case they
have to justify their grading.

Willis said, “There is a
percentage of professors who
feel that they are infallible’ and
when wrong, refuse to change
the grades.

Dudley concluded the discus-
sion, saying, ‘““Maybe we should
