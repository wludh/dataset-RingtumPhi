Library Move Great Success

1,600 participate in transferring books to new library

A larger than expected
worker turnout helped speed
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s library move yesterday
beyond all preliminary expecta-
tions.

Over 1,100 students, faculty,
alumni, and townspeople had
registered by 9:45 a.m. to move
books from McCormick Library
to W&L’s new library. Susan
Coblentz, in charge of the
registration, estimated that in
all, between 1,500 - 1,600 persons
participated in the.effort which
saw 150,000 volumns moved in
just two and one half hours.

Maurice Leach, head of the
University’s library, called the
book moving © operation
‘‘super,’’ which he defined as
‘‘extraordinaily great’’ and
‘beyond all expectations. ”’

Originally, the Library Move
Committee had estimated that
the move would require 1,000
persons to each carry 18 bags of
books before the transfer from
the old library tothe new one
could be completed. The Com-
mittee had planned for the
move to take seven hours.

‘*We are finished here now”’

But the word was given by
library reference head Betty
Kondayan at 10:50 a.m. that
‘‘everything’s finished.”

‘‘We are finished here now,”
she told the book carriers in the
lobby of McCormick Library.

‘‘There are no more books.”’
Still, eager book porters
crowded the small stack
stairwell and asked if there
were more books they could
carry.

Organization and efficiency

Leach cited a number of fac-

  

“egg: a a ae Toor

tors that contributed to the suc-
cess of the book moving opera-
tion:

—the over 125 people who were
‘“‘behind the scenes’’ directing
the book carriers where to go
every step of the way;

~ —the 320 freshmen and 30 dor-

mitory counselors who were

 

 

briefed the night before on the
procedure so that they could
start right in at 8:30a.m.;

—the Library Move Committee
as a whole;

—the staff of W&L’s law
library, the Marshall Library,
and the Virginia Military In-
stitute’s library who, with their

.*
%

 

expertise, helped make the
transfer of books a smooth
operation.

In particular, Leach named
Steve Mangan, student chair-
man of the Library Move Com-
mittee, Bean Dudley, president
of W&L’s student body, Gray
Coleman, editor of the Ring-
tum Phi,Bob Keefe, director of
W&L’s news office, George
Barr, move consultant, Scott
Beebe, building engineer, and
Jim Arthur for their work in
organizing the book moving
operation.

Leach had special priase for
Margaret Williams, who spent
months working out the
logistics of the move itself.

Williams counted the books,
oversaw their division into sec-
tions, and mapped out the
routes the book carriers would
follow in the transfer operation.

‘She was unbelievable,”’ said
Bean Dudley. “‘She’s entirely
responsible for the efficiency of
the operation.”

‘It makes me sort of happy
that it only took two hours,”
said Miss Williams, ‘‘because it
shows that at least it was well
planned.”

“IT can’t really decide if I'm
surprised or not,” said Dudley,
about the quickness with which
the move was completed. ‘‘It’s
remarkable, but we expect that
ata place like W&L.”

EC Extends Datz’s

by Randy Smith

The Executive Committee
Monday night extended the
authority of Burr Datz, assis-
tant manager of W&L’s food
services, to charge an entrance
fee to pay bands performing in
the Cockpit.

The EC’s action, which came
without a vote, continues the
Cockpit cover charge policy
established in September.

“I think it (the cover charge)
worked to the students’ ad-
vantage by making up the dif-
ference between student funds
and band fees,”’ Datz told the
committee.

He said that the Cockpit had
had six cover charges last
semester, one of them benefit-
ting the United Way.

Datz also praised the work of
the University Center Commit-
tee saying that the group ‘thas
been tremendous, really
tremendous.”

“The student body is getting
the best of this situation,’ he
added.

Bill Tucker, EC vice-
president, asked Datz about the
possibility of obtaining a new
sound system for the Cockpit.

“We can get a_ top-notch
sound system for about $1,500,”
Datz said. The system Datz had
in mind would include a six
channel mixer, speakers,
cables, an equalizer, and would
be mobile for use anywhere on
campus.

The only problem was the

...discusses Contact
before Christmas

At the Executive Committee
meeting before Christmas
break, questions were raised
about the process used in the
selection of the fraternities to
host a reception for Contact
speakers.

The questions arose when
Tom Wall, chairman of Contact,
reported that this year’s first
speaker, former Sen. James
Buckley would have a reception
before his speech at the Phi
Kappa Sigma house.

Steve Abraham, sophomore

EC representative and a
member of the IFC, said that
the selection of the Phi Kap
house for the reception was the
first he had heard of the matter.

Wall told the committee that
the IFC had ‘‘picked a house
that hadn’t had a speaker in the
past year,” and that was all he
knew about the selection.

Wall also reported that
Buckley would cost $3,000,
which would be split equally
with the Mock Convention Com-
mittee.

McDaniel Chairs
Historical Archaeology
Session

John M. McDaniel, assistant
professor of anthropology at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, was chairman of a session on
academic sites in North
America last week at the 12th
annual conference of the Socie-
ty for Historical Archaeology in
Nashville, Tenn.

This was the first year that
academic sites have received
the recognition provided by a
special session at the annual
meeting, McDaniel said.

. McDaniel, who credits the
work undertaken since 1974 at
W&L’s Liberty Hall dig for the
new attention on academic
sites, also delivered a paper,
“The Future: Opportunities,
Challenges and Problems of the
Academic Site Orientation,”
during the conference.

Also speaking at the session
on academic sites were two
Washington and Lee graduates
and a current W&L student.
Their papers dealt with the
analysis of data from the work
at the Liberty Hall excavation.

Parker B. Potter Jr., a senior
from Bexley, Ohio, delivered a

paper, ‘General Cultural In-
sights from the Academic Site;
or, You Can Learn More Than
the Layout of the Campus.”’

Kurt C. Russ, a 1978 graduate
from Buena Vista, spoke on
“The Case for the Application of
Archaeological Techniques
When Extensive Documentary
Evidence exists.”’

And Charles L. Hall, a 1978
graduate from Arlington, read
the opening paper, “The Liber-
ty Hall Academy Site.”

$1,500 price tag, which Tucker
hinted might be paid out of EC
funding.

Also at Monday’s meeting,
sophomore representative
Steve Abraham asked that the
EC investigate the process by
which fraternities are chosen
for Contact speaker receptions.

He said that there was some
discrepency in the way the Phi
Kappa Sigma house was chosen
to host the reception for former
Sen. James Buckley in
December.

“‘T just want to know how it’s
done,” Abraham said.

The Student Activities Board
reported that they foresee no
financial problems in the
future. Winter Weekend is being
planned for Feb. 3.

 

 

 

Ann Smith
Renovation

Plans:

Architects representing Chi
Psi fraternity will begin their
preliminary inspection of the
old Ann Smith School early this
year with an eye toward prepar-
ing detailed renovation plans.

W&L bought the abandoned
school building from the city for
$130,000 in a sale completed
Dec. 8. The university will lease
the facility to Chi Psi, which is
forming a chapter at
Washington and Lee.

Chi Psi will undertake a com-
plete interior renovation of the
structure. Washington and Lee
will maintain the grounds and
the exterior appearance and
has already begun stepping up
security at the building and tak-
ing other measures such as
boarding it up to prevent fur-
ther physical deterioration.

When the renovation begins,
W&L and Chi Psi will maintain
the historic building’s exterior
appearance to the maximum
extent possible, according to
university officials. Because
the building is in Lexington’s
historic district, changes in the
facade would have to be approv-
ed by the city Planning Com-
mission, but preliminary W&L-
Chi Psi plans call for such
changes, if there are any at all,
to be minor.

No specific timetable has
been set for the renovation.

EC to investigate
Cover Charge Power | Buckley reception

by David Greer

The Executive Committee
will investigate possible im-
proprieties in the choosing of
the reception for Contact
speaker James Buckley last
November.

Receptions for Contact
speakers are supposed to be
held at fraternities chosen by
random drawing. But for
Buckley’s reception, Phi Kappa
Sigma was chosen by a decision
made by Contact chairman
Tom Wall and IFC president
Jim Davis.

According to Wall, Pi Kappa
Alpha was originally chosen in
a random drawing. However,
members of Contact and the
IFC realized that PiKA had the
last speaker last year and
decided that it would be more
fair to allow other fraternities
to have a chance to host recep-
tions.

IFC member Syd Farrar sug-
gested removing from the list of

eligable fraternities those who

have hosted receptions in the
past year.

Wall, Farrar, and Davis met
to discuss a re-drawing on the
Monday before Buckley’s
Wednesday night speech. Ac-
cording to Wall, they realized
that they did not have enough
time to chose another fraternity
and be sure that it was able to
host a reception.

Davis said that his house, Phi

Kappa Sigma, would be able to
have the reception, and Davis
and Wall decided to have it
there, Wall said.

Davis then announced at the
next IFC meeting (after the
speech) that the Phi Kap house
had been chosen in a random
drawing.

(Wall told the Executive
Committee that the IFC had
made the selection of the frater-
nity hosting the reception. )

Farrar told Wall and Davis
that he felt that Red Square had
been having too many of the
receptions and that there should
be random drawings from
among the houses that had not
recently had speakers. He add-
ed that Phi Delta Theta had not
had a speaker for the past five
years but that Phi Kap had had
them recently.

Wall said that he thought that
Phi Kap had not had a reception
in the three years he has been
working with Contact.

Wall also said that the loca-
tions for the rest of the recep-
tions this year have been picked
at random, and that Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Zeta Beta Tau are
to be the hosts for the next two
speakers.

Wall said that he realized
Contact and the IFC had had
trouble with the selection for
the Buckley reception, but that
the “problem has been rec-
tified’ by a new proper drawing

Leyburn to speak at ODK—

Founder’s Day convocation

Honorary ODK initiates named

Dr. James Graham Leyburn,
former professor of sociology,
anthropology and ancient
history at Washington and Lee
University and dean of The Col-
lege from 1947 to 1955, will be
the principal speaker at W&L
Founders’ Day ceremonies next
Friday, Jan. 19.

By custom, ‘‘tapping’’

ceremonies for Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national 'eadership
society founded 65 years ago at
Washington and Lee, will take
place during the Founders’ Day
convocation.

 

This year, two prominent
alumni, a Lexington resident,
and a number of current

undergraduates and law
students will be ‘‘tapped’’ into
ODK membership.

The honorary initiates are
Robert A. Fulwiler Jr. of Wilm-
ington, Del., assistant general
counsel for Hercules Powder
Co. in Radford, Va.; Fred O.
Funkhouser of Harrisonburg,
Va., chairman of the board of
United Virginia Bank in
Spotswood; and J. Sanford
Doughty of Lexington, retired
associate director of develop-
ment at Washington and Lee.

The public is invited to attend
the events, which begin at 12:30
p.m. in Evans Hall.

Dr. Leyburn is the noted

social historian whose major
books include “The Haitian
People,’’ winner of the
Anisfield-Wolf Award when it
was first published in 1941 by
Yale University Press, which
re-issued it in 1966, and ‘The
Scotch-Irish,” published in 1962.

He came to W&L after a 20-
year career on the sociology
faculty at Yale. The so-called
“Leyburn Plan” for revising
the W&L curriculum, which he
proposed almost at the beginn-
ing of his tenure as dean, “‘in
large measure formed the
subsequent academic history of
Washington and Lee,’’ Presi-

dent Robert E. R. Huntley com-

mented when Dr. Leyburn

“ retired from teaching in 1972.

Dr. Leyburn is a graduate of
Duke and Princeton Univer-
sities, with degrees in
economics, and of Yale, where
he received his Ph.D. in
sociology. He also holds
honorary doctorates from Duke
and Washington and Lee.

His Founders’ Day address
will be on the subject of ‘“‘ex-
cellence, noblesse oblige (or the
Miltonian concept. of
‘magnanimity’), and _ the
Roman notion of ‘genius loci,’
or ‘genius of place’,” Dr.
Leyburn says.

“In a community such as
Washington and Lee,”’ he says,
“those concepts describe, or

ought to describe, ideals -the
demands imposed upon both in-
dividuals and the place.”

ROBERT A. FULWILER is a
1925 B.A. graduate of W&L. He
earned his law degree from

Junkin painting, sculpture exhibited

A memorial exhibition trac-
ing more than four decades of
painting and sculpture by the
late Marion M. Junkin is cur-
rently on display in W&L’s du-
Pont Gallery.

Junkin, who died June 18,
1977, was the founder in 1949 of
Washington and Lee’s fine arts
department and taught studio
art and art history courses at
W&L until his retirement in
1973. He was head of the art
department until 1968.

He had also founded the art
department at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, and
taught there for eight years
prior to returning to Lexington
and Washington and Lee. He
was a 1927 graduate of W&L and
was a descendant of Dr. George
Junkin, Robert E. Lee’s im-
mediate predecessor as presi-
dent of Washington College.

On view in the gallery will be
42 works of art or series of
works by Junkin, beginning
with finely detailed etchings of
Washington and Lee campus
scenes which were published in
the college annual in the year of
his graduation through his late-
period watercolors, the last of
which he painted in 1970.

Included in the exhibition are
17 watercolors, 13 oil paintings,
a set of five sketchbooks, three
woodcuts, three etchings, two
lithographs, and_ three

sculptures, two in wood and one
of bronze.

Junkin was also noted for his
fresco murals, which will be
represented during an exhibi-
tion ceremony Jan. 12 when a

will be shown. The film was
made almost 20 years ago by O.
W. Riegel, then head of W&L’s
journalism department. The
ceremony will take place at 8
p.m. in duPont Auditorium, ad-
jacent to the gallery, and will be
preceded by a reception at 7
p.m. in the nearby Alumni
House. The public is invited to
both events.

A 32-page illustrated
catalogue of the exhibition is be-
ing published by Washington
and Lee.

Organizer of the exhibition
and principal author of the
catalogue is Dr. Pamela
Hemenway Simpson, assistant
professor of art history at
Washington and Lee. This
year’s is the fourth in a series of
winter exhibitions she has

 

mounted annually to mark im-
portant W&L and Lexington art
resources.

Nineteen of the Junkin works °
in the exhibition are reproduced
in black-and-white in the
catalogue, and the cover shows

scene in full color. The

Under the big top with

 

Superman

by Dick Barron

Anyone who has seen the film
pages of a recent newspaper
will notice the growing amount
of ads for new releases. The Big
Producers are out to get the big
money. They seem to believe
that the public loves a re-make,
a re-hash, or a re-release. This
kind of thinking brought you
The Wiz, The Invasion of the
Body Snatchers and Pinocchio.

The Lord of the Rings and.

 

Superman brought highly
popular and familiar subjects to
the screen while California
Suite merely translated a
popular Neil Simon play into
movie form. Popularity is the
name of the game, and the
results of this money mentality
can often be appealing,
although not always innovative.

They could have called it
anything — ‘Disasters Meet the
Sunday Comix”’ or the ‘‘Ringl-
ing Brothers Make a Movie” —
but they called it Superman. By
now, it’s no secret that Super-
man has become a blockbuster.
It brings in the cash by the
truckload, despite the early
warnings of “too much hype’’.
The special effects are truly im-
pressive. Gone are the days
when George Reeves flew
across our T,V. screens backed
with windy sound effects. Today
we have Chris Reeve, the
newcomer, flying with cables
and boom cranes, special matte
photography and animation —
it’s Star Wars technology on the
streets of Metropolis.

Somewhere, buried under this
circus is a movie — a film, com-
plete with a plot — Superman
grows up, works for the Daily
Planet, and fights crime. The
plot stays buried most of the
time, keeping well away from
the thrills and action.

Marlon Brando, the 3.7
million dollar actor, who por-
trays Superman’s dad is neither
good nor bad — he applies his
competence to his average part.
The same goes for Gene
Hackman, who must have wat-
ched a lot of old Batman
episodes for tips on being a
whimsical crook. Margot Kid-
der as Lois Lane is cute, and
Valerie Perrine is seductive,
while Jackie Cooper is the gruff
Perry White — they all are sim-
ple charicatures in simple
parts. Chris Reeve is excellent,
giving depth to a character
which could have been as flat as
a comic book.

Japan will be given in conjunc-
tion with the visit to the
Washington and Lee University
campus this next week by Prof.
Akira Matsui, a professional
Japanese actor and instructor
in theatre.

Matsui, founder of the
Wakayama Nogaku Kanshokai,
a school in Japan for training
performers in the convention of
classic Japanese acting, will
visit W&L through the
cooperative efforts of the W&L
Asian Studies Committee, the
W&L drama division, and the
Glasgow Endowment program,
established in 1960 to promote
“the art of expression by pen
and tongue.”’

While at Washington and Lee,

Matsui will conduct a five-day
workshop in Noh drama, the
classical theatre form of Japan,
for W&L students and faculty
members beginning Monday,
Jan. 15.

A four-film series, depicting
the different aspects of and
-developments in Japanese
theatre open to the public
without charge, will begin
Wednesday, Jan. 17, with two
films, “Noh Drama’’ and “‘St.
Francis: A Noh Play,” at 7:30
p.m. in duPont Auditorium. The
films will run 90 minutes.

The last two films, “‘Kubuki’”’
and “Bunraku,”’ will be shown
Wednesday, Jan. 24, at 7:30
p.m. in duPont Auditorium. The
two films will run 60 minutes. .
Matsui will also give a public
performance and demonstra-
tion of Noh drama next Friday,
Jan. 19, at 8 p.m. in the

slated

the corner of North Main and
Henry Streets. Again, there will
be no charge for admission.

Matsui began taking lessons
in Noh theatre in 1951 when he
was five years old. He made his
debut one year later, continued
his studies for another 10 years,
and regularly appeared in pro-
ductions in many of Japan’s
theatres. In 1960 he performed
at the Tokyo Olympics and the
International Trade Fair, and
for the National Broadcast Cor-
poration on radio and televi-
sion.

In 1962, Matsui began
teaching Noh in Wakayama Ci-
ty, his home town, where he
later founded a school for train-
ing performers in the conven-
tion of classic Japanese acting.
Today, he also maintains a
school in Tokyo.

Matsui participated in a
cultural exchange trip in 1972 to

‘Vancouver, Canada, Richmond,

Va., and Bakersfield, Calif.,
and has since conducted
workshops at San Francisco
State University, the University
of Hawaii, Boston University
and Amherst College.

by Mark Mainwaring

While flipping through the
most recent issue of Walrus, a
trade paper devoted entirely to
album-oriented FM radio, I
came across a feature which
the folks there called their ‘‘An-
nual Crow-Eating for
Christmas” program. What it
consisted of was more or less an
examination of all the reviews
they had published in the past
year and an explanation of any
errors in critical judgement
they felt they had made. All of a
suddent, my mind was filled
with questions concerning the
nature of rock criticism itself,
and after a period of suitably in-
tense reflection I came to what
may seem to be a painfully ob-
vious conclusion; errors in
judgment are an unfortunate,
but in many ways unavoidable,
result of the entire critical pro-
cess. The pressures. of
deadlines, occassional attacks
of tin-earedness, and the in-
herently elusive nature of some
of the greatest rock’n’roll are
just a few of the factors that
contribute to this problem.
About this time I began to feel
concerned — what if we at
Musical Mainstream had made
some of the same kind of
mistakes?? I immediately dove
into my closet and after a brief
rummage came up with all the
issues of the Phi in which our
column had appeared. Was it
possible that all our conscien-
tious effort had been negated by
some inherent flaws in the form
itself??

Well, as it turned out, things
weren’t nearly as bad as I ex-
pected they might be. In
general, it appears that most of
what was written has
weathered the test of time in the
sense that what sounded great
in May still sounds great today,
and what struck me as pure
trash in October still has the
same effect. However, there
was one major exception, that
being our most recent, ‘‘year’s-
end’’ column. Neglecting
Jackson Brown’s pioneering
Running on Empty was pro-

~ 2,000 pounds of
stampeding revenge
and a man who could

ride him. from hell

Musical Mainstream

bably our our most serious
omission — it was without a
doubt one of the most inventive
and successful concept albums
in recent memory.

Another flaw showed up as a
natural result of being forced to
sum up an entire year’s musical
experience with ten albums.
This restriction necessitated
the omission of such important
releases as Carlene Carter’s
debut album, Mik DeVille’s
Return to Magenta, Patti
Smith’s Easter and, worst of
all, Southside Johnny’s Hearts
of Stone and the two ground-
breaking albums by George
Thorogood and the Destroyers.
These records, in addition to the
ten originally chosen, make
1978 seem much more promis-

ing than it did at year’s end.
Paul Williams (the writer, not
the short songwriter) once said
that no negative critical judge-
ment should be taken seriously.
While I don’t necessarily agree
with this, it is true that most
critics tned to err on the over-
critical side. This tendency was
strong enough in my case to foul
my evaluation of an entire year,
not to mention countless in-
dividual cases that never made
it into print. The crucial point is
that rock criticism should be
viewed as an art form in itself,
with just as many ups and

Library Move

(continued from page 1)
Months in the planning

Planning for ‘the move”
began last January, when
George Barr was hired as a con-
sultant to advise the Library
Move Committee on the dif-
ferent procedures that could be
used to transfer the books. The
decision to have a day-long book
move utilizing students and
other volunteer laborers was
made last spring.

“If this move had been car-
ried out by a professional mov-
ing company, the estimated
cost would be somewhere in the
neighborhood of more than
$60,000," Leach said. ‘‘The
move, at the moment, is
nowhere near that sum of
money.”

A feeling of building the library

Another reason for the
volunteer book carrier ap-
proach to transferring the
books, according to Leach, was
“to create a feeling for the
people—meaning the students,
the faculty, and the people in
the community who use the
library—that they have had a
part in building the new
library.”

As an added incentive,
students were given the day off
from classes so that they would
participate in he move, and a
party was scheduled for
Wednesday night featuring two

bands and 40 kegs of beer, with,
a ticket demonstrating par-
ticipation in the library move as
the entrance fee.

Problems

The only complications Leach
saw in the otherwise flawless
book moving operation were the
congestion problems at the en-
trances and exits to both library
buildings, and the problem of
picking up the 4,000 paper bags
which littered the campus when
‘‘the move’’ was completed.

Lunch also did not run as
smoothly as the organizers had
hoped.

Many people apparently took
advantage of the four areas ser-
ving lunch on four different
floors, even though each worker
was supposed to only have one
roast beef sandwich.

“You'd be surprised how
many people eat on one floor
and run to the next one so they
can get two sandwiches,” said
Burr Datz, assistant manager
of W&L’s food services.

There was also a problem
with trash on many floors
because there were no garbage
cans.

By and large, however,
workers and organizers called
the book moving operation ‘‘a
tremendous success.”

“It was a super job,” Leach
said. “The enthusiasm and
esprit of the participants was
extraordinary.”

 

Students and townspeople walk the specially-constructed ramp
system as the library move progresses.

 

Townspeople,

Alumni help
move books

Hundreds of Lexington residents and
Washington and Lee alumni were among the
1,600 persons involved in yesterday’s book
transfer operation from the McCormick
Library to W&L’s new library.

Thirty townspeople worked during the
Christmas break taking a full inventory of
McCormick Library’s stock and putting up
shelving in the new library to prepare for
yesterday’s big move.

Other community members also worked
“behind the scenes’’ on moving day directing
traffic and ensuring that the books got to their
proper places.

Many other people, either directly or in-
directly involved with W&L, appeared yester-
day, to help transfer the books to the new
library.

Mrs. Henry Ravenhorst, wife of one of
W&L’s engineering professors, said ‘‘the
stairs going down (in the new library) are bad
on old knees.”’ She was undeterred, however,
and managed to make six trips back and forth
between the two libraries.

Two house mothers from Southern
Seminary Junior College in Buena Vista were
also there to work. Miss Beth Gannaway, the
former house mother of Pi Kappa Phi frater-
nity, was outside the new library with Mrs.
Alton Crowell after the move talking with the
students she had known at W&L.

Mrs. Crowell said she thought the move
“was just great, really something,” but she
did not expect to attend Wednesday evening’s
party for the workers.

Samuel Sanderson, W&L class of 1922, look-
ed a little disappointed, though, after travell-
ing from Natural Bridge Station.

“They told me to get here at 10:30, so I only
had time to do one load because it was over so
quickly,” he said.

Stuard Wurzburger, W&L class of 1928 and
one of the ‘‘behind the scenes’’ people direc-
ting the book moving operation, called the
move a “‘terrific job.”

“But,” he asked with a grin, ‘how many
years is it going to be until they find all the
books?”’

| Miller Beer
Is Refused

The Miller Brewing Company expressed
the desire to film a commercial during W&L’s
book moving day yesterday, but were turned
down by the administration before any real
negotiations could begin, the Ring-tum Phi
learned yesterday.

Robert S. Keefe, director of W&L’s news of-
fice, said the commercial would ‘‘not have
been appropriate’”’ because University Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley is on the board of
trustees of Philip Morris Inc., which owns
Miller Brewing Company.

Keefe said that a sales representative of
Miller Beer apparently heard about the
library move and thought it might provide a
good opportunity for a television commercial
without being aware of Huntley’s position on
the board of Philip Morris.

The on-camera actors for the commercial
would have been professionals and not
students, Keefe said.

The sales representative mentioned the
possibility that Miller might donate kegs of
beer for the party after the move, Keefe said.

Pres. Huntley apparently thought that his
position on the board of Philip Morris might
give the appearance of putting pressure on

Miller to give the beer to the party, Keefe ex-

plained.
‘‘For that reason we did not explore the op-
tion of getting the beer for free,’’ Keefe said.
By coincidence, however, all of the beer at
Wednesday night’s party was Miller,
although the University paid for it.

Washington and Lee Univer-

dent library officially opened
this morning at 8a.m.

The library will operate on a
‘imited basis,’ according to
Maurice Leach, head librarian.

There will be a full circulation
service, a reserve service, and
a limited reference service.

“The books are there. The
major difficulities will be the of-
fices and the accessibility to the
people, but there will always be
someone there,’ Leach said.

The library will be open from
8 a.m. until midnight daily.

After the building is completed,
it will operate on a 24-hour basis
whenever school is in session.

There will be 560 study car-
rels in the building. In addition,
there are 15 small study rooms
on three of the floors, and one
room on each floor big enough
to be used as a seminar room.
There are two rooms on Lower
Level 1 big enough to seat 25
people.

An auditorium and rare book
room arefeatured to ‘provide a
place where the campus and the
town can have cultural
meetings,’’ Leach said.

 

    

 

University Throws

Party for Book Movers

Washington and Lee University threw a party last night
and it was a big success.

Almost 3,000 students, faculty, alumni, and townspeople
packed the lobby’ the main reading room, and the first floor
stack of McCormick Library in what was probably the big-
gest party W&L has ever thrown.

Forty kegs of beer flowed most of the night whileAce
Weams and the Fat Meat Boys and the Charlottesville
Allstars played to an enthusiastic crowd.

A green ticket proving participation in yesterday’s library
move was the price of admission. The tickets were fairly
easy to get because George W. Ray, who was dispensing the
tickets, gave them out to the many students who showed up at
the new library after the move had been completed six hours
ahead of schedule.

“Tf you feel guilty, just don’t have quite as good a time as
the other people,’”’ Ray would tell the latecomers.

One aspect of the party that was the most commented on
was the remarkable mixture of different people, many of
whom had probably never partied before.

The Ring-tum Phi diligently circulated through the party to
gather the comments of the party-goers: :

Pres. Huntley (Pres. W&L)—‘‘This is one of the best occas-
sions we’ve ever had at W&L with the mixture here of
students, faculty, and townspeople.”

Frank Parsons (assist. to the Pres.)—‘‘In our wildest dreams
we never envisioned something like this...especially like the
party going on in the stacks; it was a great day, the only trou-
ble was that we ran out of books for people to carry.”

Kathy Levi (Sweet Briar)—“I suggest that all schools turn
their libraries into party centers.”’

Buddy Bowie ( junior )—“‘One of the better parties the univer-
sity has ever had; if they had opened up the rest of the
library, we would have more room to move around in.”

Erica Gibson (RMWC)—‘‘Fantastic party; it’s the best party
you’ve ever had.”

Dean Dan Murphy—“‘It’s a fantastic time; it’s really good to
see the turnout by students and faculty, and all of them really
having a good time.”

Pam Wood (Sweet Briar)—‘‘Great party.”

John E. Hughes (former W&L information services
director )—‘‘This was a mediocre party until I met Pam.”

Andy Pick (sophomore )—‘‘This is the first time I’ve ever got-
ten maximum utility out of the library, but the girls were ug-
ly. ”

Elizabeth Minetree (Hollins)—‘‘It’s a good party, if you can
get to the beer and if you could find somebody you know.”’

Dean Atwood—‘‘It was imperative for me to come to this par-
ty as I live right next door to the old library and I could not go
to bed until the party was over because the music was so
seductive.”

Bill Tucker (senior )—‘“‘I asked Dean Atwood if he was overly
upset about the amount of beer spilled on the floor of his new
building and he replied, ‘I wouldn’t mind if it had been dark
beer.”

Cindy Stover (Sweet Briar )—‘They ought to initiate the new
library like this.”

Maurice Leach—“‘SUPER. The party for me is unique and
absolutely great; I’ve enjoyed the music and goodwill.”

Allison Straughn(‘‘Hollins and proud of it’’)—‘‘I think this
party is very crowded, but I’m having a blast.”’

Scott Graham (junior)—‘‘I’m having a blast too; one more
beer and I’ll really have a blast.”’

Dan Holleran (freshman)—‘‘Hell yeah I’m having a good
time; they have my favorite type of bands—rock and roll.”

Lisa Frey (RMWC)—‘‘It couldn’t have happened in a Walt
Disney movie.”

Beau Dudley (law student)—‘‘Not enough room, but so
what.”

Jim Lewis (freshman)—‘‘I wish Kristie was here.”’

Brenda Burch (RMWC)—‘‘It’s crowded, but great.”’

Marsh Dougherty (junior)—‘‘I like to have sex a lot.”’

Karen Duffield ‘(Hollins College)—‘‘I like being at W&L
where all the nice guys are, but the Allstars were ‘the best’.”’

Doug Perkins (alumnus, merchant)—‘‘The move was great,
theAllstars were super, the girls were fine, and the beers
were Sparse.”’

Kroll selected as
new baseball coach

Charles R. Kroll, a 1975
graduate of Ithaca (N.Y.)
College has been named in-
terim baseball coach at
Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. The announcement was
made by William D.
McHenry, Director of
Athletics at the University.

Kroll joined the
Washington and Lee coaching
staff in the fall as one of two
football interns, and was
responsible for the Generals’
defensive secondary this past
season. Prior to ‘joining the
W&L staff, the 26-year-old
Kroll served as a graduate
assistant at Albany (N.Y.)
State University. While earn-
ing his Masters degree in
Education at Albany, he serv-
ed as head’ junior varsity
baseball coach of a very suc-
cessful college division pro-
gram, and also coached the
defensive line for the football
team.

“Chuck possesses all the
qualities we were looking for
in a successful young coach,”
said McHenry, “In all his
past coaching positions, he
exhibited an ability to
motivate and assist in the
development of his players.
He has an excellent relation-
ship with his players both on
and off the field.”’

Canfield

By Bill Whalen

Five games into the 1978-79
season, Coach Verne Canfield
was faced with quite a dilem-
ma. His team was struggling
along with a 3-2 record; his
‘franchise’, Dave Leunig,
was sidelined with a knee in-
jury, and he had yet to find
that right combination of five
men. As if this were not
enough, his team was about
to embark on a four game
road trip to two tournaments
in which they were underdog-
ged.
But Canfield, the Wizard of
W&L Basketball, made two
simple adjustments—and the
results have been
devastating. The Coach in-
serted R.J. Scaggs and Pete
Farrell into the starting
lineup, and the new unit has
recorded a 4-1 skein, in-
cluding last night’s romp
over Castleton State.

Canfield had _ several
reasons for doing this. ‘‘It
wasn’t that our starting unit
was playing poorly—I felt
that it is important to have
these young guys working

The Washington & Lee
Generals beat Castleton State
100-74, last night, ina game in
which the only question was
whether or not the Generals
would reach the century
mark. The magic moment
came on Jim Berlin’s free
throw with 11 seconds, which
proved to be the only
highlight in an otherwise
sloppy game.

The Generals, who now
stand at 7-3, struggled with
the outmanned Spatans
before putting on a 20-6 scor-
ing spurt to post a 54-37 lead
at halftime. -

Any hopes of a Castleton
comeback were quickly end-
ed in the opening minutes of

the second half as_ the
Generals pulled away to a
70-47 tead. From this point the
outcome was academic, as
Coach Verne Canfield
substituted freely with his
bench.

Leading the scoring parade
was Pete Farrell, who bomb-
ed in 21 points. Tom Jeffries
and Berlin both added 17, a
career high for Berlin.

Pete Farrell then hit two free

ed on 55 shots.

The W&L road-game winn-
ing streak was ended at three
games when Allegheny
knocked off the Generals,

trailed by 19 points with 12
minutes left, came back to
within three points before
finally succumbing to
Allegheny. Hoy and Jeffries,
who led W&L with 16 and 13
points respectively, were
both named all-tourney.

makes new lineup; ends slump

together”, said the Coach.
“Plus, we now have two
seniors (Mike Wenke and Jim
Berlin) who can come off the
bench and give us some
poise.”’ The new lineup starts
two juniors—Tom Jeffries
and Farrell—and three
sophomores—Scaggs, Carby
Hoy and Rob Smitherman.

In the Rose-Hulman
Tourney, the lineup was
perfect. Hoy was named
MVP of the two games, while
the other four players con-
tributed Key points, assists
and rebounds. In the Gator
Classic, Mike Wenke was a
big factor as he provided both
spark and leadership.

If there is one weakness, it
is the lack of overall height.
After the 6-7 Smitherman, the
next tallest if Jeffries at 6-3,
Scaggs at 6-2, Hoy at 6-1 and
Farrell at 6-0. In_ the
General’s loss to Lynchburg,
one of the major problems
was an incapacity to stop the
Hornets’ taller rebounders.

This could happen again.

The highlight of Canfield’s
new arrangement is that it
allows for five under-
calssmen to develop into a
strong unit. Said one observer
in the press box last nite:
“With that lineup, W&L is on-
ly a year away from being a
powerhouse’’.

Swim team 0-3; meets G. W. U. on Sat.

The Washington and Lee
swim team splashes into action
this Saturday against George
Washington after a dismal 0-3
‘pre-Christmas break start.
Coach Bill Stearns attributes
the lack of success to a drawn
out water polo season, but says
he is still confident that the
team will qualify for the Na-
tionals.

Swimming well individually
for the Generals are Captains
Keith Romich and Chip Hoke,
says Stearns. Romich is ranked
in the top five nationally in the
100 free, 200 free, and 200 fly,
setting ‘a new school record in

this event. According to
Stearns, Hoke will ‘‘probably be
ranked’’ in the near future also.
A third All-American, Bob
Newcomb, is swimming well,
says Stearns. Leading the
divers is Jay Diesing, who won
in an upset against VMI.

Five of the swimmers com-
peted during the Christmas
break with thousands of other
swimmers the Fort Lauderdale
Hall of Fame.

Stearns also pointed to the
fact that the Generals are
swimming against Division I
teams that are becoming more

and more inclined to give away
more scholarships. He said that
this is making it harder for
schools like W&L to compete on
this basis.

The Generals are readying

for an away meet with George
Washington on Saturday. W&L

main in the University’s
Health and Physical Educa-
tion Department as an
Associate Professor, and will
take a sabbatical leave dur-
ing the 1979 spring term.

Kroll, a bachelor, is a
native of Scranton, Pa., anda
1970 graduate of Scranton
Central High School. His ap-

pointment is effective Jan. 1,
1979 through the conclusion of
the 1979 baseball season.
W&L is a member of the Old

by Tim Connors

Rolf Piranian, Washington
and Lee’s soccer coach since
1976, has devised a method
wherein soccer players from all
walks of University life are able
to keep in shape in the off-
season and keep themselves oc-
cupied at the same time. It is in-
door soccer, and it’s success,
which is based on its popularity,
has increased tremendously

Wrestlers

The W&L grapplers, 0-1 in
the 1978-79, return to action
this Saturday hosting Duke
and George Washington,
beginning at 1 p.m. in the
Warner Center. There is no
admission charge. W&L will
compete in The Citadel In-
vitational next weekend.

The Ring-tum Phi, Jan. 11, 1979, Page 9

Indoor soccer tourney to be

held at W&L is open to all

since its inception at the beginn-
ing of Piranian’s tenure as head
coach.

The progrem, now in its third
year, culminates with a tourna-
ment in which neighboring
teams are invited to come and
to compete against the best
which W&L has to offer. Pira-
nian is especially pleased with
the attitudes of the teams which
participate in the tournament.
Although many old rivalries are
renewed in the playing of the
games, Piranian says that “a
spirit of comradeship exists’’
among the players, and that
there is no “obsession to win,
that the main object is to havea
good time.” This year, the tour-
nament will take place on Sun-
day, Jan. 28, from 8:30 a.m. un-
til 7:40 p.m. in W&L’s Doremus
Gymnasium.

Leading up to and surroun-
ding the tournament is a league,
which anyone is welcome to

join. The main idea behind the
league is divided into two parts.
It is for the soccer players to
keep in shape during the winter,
and, more importantly, it is an
opportunity for anyone to stay
active during the winter, when
the weather is bad and gym
time is restricted due to the
other athletic programs. This is
the first year in which enough
people have shown an interest
to organize the program into a
such a format. Previously, it
was strictly on a pick-up basis:
Over one half of the current
players are not members of the
soccer team. This shows the ap-
peal which the program has for
a wide variety of students, both
grads and undergrads, as well
as faculty members.

Anyone is still welcome to
join, and if you are interested,
please see Coach Piranian for
assignment to a team and a
schedule.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thoughts on
‘the big move”

The great library move has come and gone after
months of preparation, and heads are still shaking, in
stunned—but pleased—disbelief. Plans originally
called for a volunteer force of 900-1000 people, work-
ing approximately seven hours. But even the most op-
timistic observers were amazed at the final results of
yesterday’s project. Well over 1,500 people arrived for
the move, many of them appearing promptly at 8:30
a.m. And on top of this, the entire production was
completed in under three hours—which must be some
sort of record for volunteer participation.

 

So many people gave their time and expertise to
this event that listing all names would be impossible.
Even so, recognition must be given to some outstan-
ding individuals. Many students have asked which
professional moving company could have devised the
intricate routing system used Wednesday. In point of
fact, the chief honors go to Margaret Williams of
W&L’s own library staff, who began work on this pro-
blem almost one year ago...Steve Mangan, student
chairman of the event, should also be applauded for
his ability to handle endless orientations, name tags,
T-shirts, hole punchers, and the like...The Library
Move Committee, formed by Mr. Mangan and con-
sisting of students and faculty-administration figures,
has also been working steadily since September. This
group suggested the prizes, planned the evening par-
ty, handled publicity matters—and were among the
first to believe strongly that the project had some
chance of success...And riding at the crest of the
wave, Maurice Leach and his library staff receive the
heartiest thanks of all, for their literally unending pa-
tience and leadership. We hope they’re happy in their
new home, completed after years of dynamite
blasting and construction.

 

When the move came to its early finish, many peo-
ple took the opportunity to stroll through the empty
rooms of McCormick Library. If anything ap-

proaching nostalgia is possible when dealing with-

such a building, this was the time for it—and many
old-timers traded stories in the vacant halls. The
most interesting is the oft-repeated tale that the base-
ment of McCormick was the “hiding place’’ for the
Declaration of Independence and the English Magna
Carta during World War II. McCormick, newly
renovated in 1941, was chosen by the Library of Con-
gress for its quiet location and proximity to
Washington. The Magna Carta, then in New York for
display at the World’s Fair, joined the American
documents at W&L when a trans-Atlantic return trip
grew too dangerous.

The papers remained locked away until the close of
the war, and only then was their location revealed...

In retrospect, this has been a week of immense
achievement on the W&L campus. All who par-
ticipated in the move should be proud of playing a
part in the biggest campus-wide activity in recent
years —a single day that, in many ways, symbolized
the growth and prosperity that has been the hallmark
of W&L in the busy 1970’s. In any event, thanks to the
students and other workers, the university received a
New Year’s present that will not be forgotten...

Applications are invited for the positions of

These positions are among the most responsi-
ble entrusted to Washington and Lee students.

guidelines for the selection of Dormitory
Counselors have been established. Applicants
must be at least current sophomores, and
should not have commitments after 8:00 p.m.
which would routinely taken them away from
the dormitory for any appreciable time.
While counselorships are not awarded on an
academic basis, a student who has failed to
maintain a 2.0 average would probably not be
selected. Any counselor who is placed on
Academic Probation after being selected will
be asked to resign.

In order to insure their availability to
counselors are provided with a single room in
the dormitory and with the dinner meal,
which they are expected to eat in Evans Din-
ing Hall. Each counselor will also be expected
to live in his dormitory room seven nights a

-week and MAY NOT SHARE THE RENTAL
ON OR HAVE AN OFF-CAMPUS APART-
MENT.

The primary basis for selection of dor-
mitory counselors will be the applicant’s
general fitness in making the dormitories
suitable living quarters for a_ student’s
freshman year. Each applicant is encouraged
to obtain from Mrs. Miller, the Dean of

More on Junkin

(continued from page 4)

In 1949, when he arrived to
found Washington and Lee’s art
department, Junkin was award-
ed an honorary doctorate. The
citation described him as ‘‘an
artist whose discerning eye has
perceieved beauty and whose
knowing hand has created it . . .
a teacher with a zeal to share
the satisfactions of the world of
art.”

_ Among the notable paintings
in the W&L exhibition is “First
Robin,” singled out for praise

by Life magazine in 1941.
Another is his whimsical
“Autobiography” (1944), in
which Junkin shows himself
-balancing -the demands of
teaching, painting and family
life against backdrops of his
professional environments --
Washington and Lee, New York
City and Nashville.

A number of the paintings are
of Lexington scenes, including
views of Washington and Lee,
Virginia Military Institute and
Goshen Pass. Many of the
others show foreign landscapes
and shorescapes, and there are
a number of portraits and street
scenes, reflecting Junkin’s ap-
preciation of the urban lower

classes, especially blacks in the
1930s and ‘40s.

Most of the works in the
memorial exhibition are from
the collection of his family.
Others are on loan from public
and private collections.

a natural, but even a beneficial,

you get down to it, an honest
love for the music they are
