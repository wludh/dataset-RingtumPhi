Chief Editors

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty will begin admitting women in
the fall of 1985, the Board of
Trustees decided July 14 after a
two-day special meeting.

The decision ends 235 years of
all-male tradition at Washington
and Lee and leaves only a hand-
ful of all-male, non-military
liberal arts colleges.

The resolution, passed 17-7 by
the trustees after what was
described as a “civil” yet
“vigorous” debate, reads as
follows:

“Resolved, that Washington
and Lee University shall admit
qualified students, regardless of
gender, to all of its degree pro-
grams commencing in the Fall
of 1985.”’

The decision was announced at
a 12:45 p.m. press conference in
the Commerce School. Nearly 50
media representatives attended
the conference. About 100
students and faculty members
watched the press conference on
television monitors in Reid Hall.

Reading from a _ statement
prepared by the board, which
had voted on coeducation at
11:50 a.m., Rector James M.
Ballengee said, ‘‘We are con-
vinced that a stronger Wash-
ington and Lee and a stronger
society will be the happy result
of the decision we have made.”

As many as 100 women will be
admitted in the fall of 1985, said
University President John D.
Wilson, adding that the board
had hoped the school would have
as many as 500 women students
within 10 years.

Wilson spoke of the ‘‘integrity,
honor and character here,’’ as
well as “our superior teaching
and learning and academic pro-
gram.

“We believe that these values
that are so important to Wash-
ington and Lee can and will be
enjoyed by men and women
equally, and that they will help
to contribute to making these as
much a part of the future as they
have been of the past,’’ he con-
tinued.

Wilson also said at the press
conference that he had voted in
favor of the motion, Although he
said he didn’t specifically make
a recommendation to the board,
he was the first member -to
speak on the issue Saturday
morning.

“I suppose that could be con-
strued as a recommendation,”
Wilson said.

Another member of the board,
whom Ballengee declined to

identify, made the motion to

adopt the resolution.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Cole Dawson and former
EC President Robert C. Jene-
vein represented the student
body in the trustees’ closed ses-
sions. Jenevein traveled to the
meeting from Dallas at his own
expense.

Looking worn but enthusiastic,
Dawson talked with reporters
following the trustees’ press con-
ference. “It’s going to take an ef-
fort of the whole student body to

implement coeducation in a
positive way,” he said.

“It was really exciting when it
happened. I still cannot believe
the course of history has chang-
ed right here at Washington and
Lee.”’

Dawson said he was in favor of
coeducation. ‘I didn’t come out
and directly tell them that, ex-
actly,” he said. “I told them at
the end that my feelings were
toward coeducation.”’

“I don’t think the market is
there for an all-male school,” he
added. ‘‘This school’s not
marketable as an all-male in-
stitution.”

Charles D. Hurt Jr. of Atlanta,
president of the Alumni Associa-
tion, and former Alumni
Association President Peter A.
Agelasto III, represented the
alumni at the meeting.

Among reports received by the
board this weekend was an
analysis of an alumni survey
conducted this spring by a Rich-
mond research firm. Of the 6,700
alumni who responded to that
survey, 58.5 percent said they
opposed coeducation, 28.9 per-
cent said they favored it, and
10.6 percent said they had no
opinion.

Although Hurt said he did not
make a specific recommenda-
tion that the board defeat
coeducation, he did say the
board was aware of the alumni’s
feelings because ‘‘we have hada
continuous communication with
the board as a whole as well as
individually.”

Alumni will support the deci-
sion, Hurt added. ‘‘I think the
decision was the right decision,
and | think the alumni will ac-
cept the decision,” he said.

noted that ‘‘within the Board’s
membership itself opinion was
divided, and the vote on the
resolution’s adoption, while
strongly in favor, was not
unanimous. However, now that
the decision is made, the

Trustees are united in pledging

their full commitment to the suc-

cessful implementation of the

University’s new course.’’

At the press conference, Bal-
lengee said, ‘‘We determined in
advance that a decision of this
magnitude should not be made
by what one would call a slim
majority or a narrow majority.”
He added that the number of
votes in favor of coeducation, 17,
exceeded the number of votes
the board had decided to re-
quire, but he declined to identify
that number.

Two other trustees, A. Chris-
tian Compton of Richmond and
Edgar F.. Shannon Jr. of Charlot-
tesville, attended the press con-
ference.

Shannon was president of the
University of Virginia when it
first began accepting female
students.

Compton said he voted against
coeducation ‘‘because I feel that
we have put in place at this
university a fine-tuned educa-
tional machine which is pro-
viding a high-quality education
ina single-sex atmosphere,”’ and
has produced ‘‘a body of
outstanding alumni who have

succeeded eminently in all walks
of life.’’

However, Compton said,
“Those of us who love and sup-
port Washington and Lee will
work just as hard to make
coeducation another positive
factor as far as W&L is concern-
ed.”’

“There is no appeal,” added
Compton, a justice of the
Virginia Supreme Court.

Shannon noted that the board
studied many financial projec-
tions before making the. deci-
sion.

Ballengee described the
discussion preceeding the vote
as “entirely civil, as Washington
and Lee gentlemen should be,
one to another . . . . There were
people with differing points of
view.

“All of the issues that you
could possibly imagine were

-discussed. It was a free, full and

frank discussion. I never heard
anyone raise his voice. On the
whole, it was polite.”

Asked his feelings now that the
debate finally had ended, Wilson
said, ‘I feel exhausted, if you
want to be absolutely candid
about it. It’s been a long and
arduous undertaking, (but)
frankly, a rewarding time.”’

“I’m just looking forward to
having it all be over,’’ he had
said in an interview earlier this
week,

‘‘A decision of this magnitude

gee and Virginia Supreme Court

and complexity involves us all in
the re-examination of this
university and its character.
There is a spirit alive on the
campus, a spirit of humaneness.

“I feel very good about the
decision. I think it was the right
decision to be made,’’ added
Wilson, who, along. with
Ballengee, wore a Washington
and Lee tie to the press con-
ference.

Relaxing at Lee House after
the press conference, Wilson ex-
pressed hope that Washington
and Lee now could begin to pian
for the future in other areas.

Wilson said at the press con-
ference that the trustees
authorized creation of a commit-
tee on coeducation, consisting of
Students, faculty and ad-
ministrators, ‘‘to help guide us

‘in every step of the way.”

Female law students and womer
faculty members will aid th
committee, Wilson added.

Among planned _ improve-
ments to the _ university’s
physical plant are a $4 million to
$5 million dormitory, which has
been in the works for some time,
and about $150,000 worth of
renovations to the gymnasium
areas to provide separate locker
room and shower facilities for
female students.

“I trust that you’re supportive
of that,” Wilson added, with a
laugh.

Opinion

 

No, we’re not going to hell in a handbag

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor
“We made history today.
Weare the future.”

--Mondale toasting Ferraro

Painful as it was, the time had
come to wake up, smell the cof-
fee, and admit women to
Washington and Lee.

The ‘no go co” forces have
reached their Appomatox. Now
it’s time for a little reconstruc-
tion.

The well-intentioned anti-coed
people who fail to see that a well-
fought battle is over are wel-
come to take their marbles and
go home; the rest of us are going
to attempt to make coeducation
the best thing that ever happen-
ed to W&L.

It’s heartsickening to realize
that when I think of the people
who love Washington and Lee
the most and would do anything
for it, Lthink of people adamant-
ly opposed to coeducation. Those
people have to feel betrayed.
The hope has to be, though, that
their regard for the institution is
greater than their devotion to
one particular aspect of it.

This has been a most unplea-
sant civil war. During his 1984
commencement address, Presi-
dent Wilson told the graduates,
“I know it has concerned you
that we seem to be divided on
this important matter, students,
faculty, alumni and staff. But

that may be inevitable on a mat-
ter of such significance, and I
live in the faith that it will not be
a permanently disabling condi-
tion.”

We have to hope he’s right.

Dr. Wilson is not, contrary to
popular opinion, the Grinch that
Stole Single Sex. He is a person
who was willing to be the point
man, and consequently to be
subject to unmitigated garbage,
for a change which he, rightly or
wrongly, believed was the best
path for the institution he’d been
hired to serve.

The Board has said what the
policy will be. It is now incum-
bent upon us, through a com-
bination of respect and coopera-
tion, to assist Dr. Wilson and his
administration in implementing
that policy as effectively and as
smoothly as possible.

The student government will
be an important component of
that effort. As you study history,
it seems that strong leaders ap-
pear when they are most needed.
For the W&L student body, such
a man is Cole Dawson.

His is a tough position. He.
follows the incredibly dedicated

. Bob Jenevein, who, like all pro-

minent men, had vociferous,
persistent critics. Cole, who is
capable, willing to listen, and
possesses integrity of the highest
order, is up to the challenge.
Once an opponent of coeduca-

tion, he changed his mind upon
further research and reflection.
He was, like us, willing to
wholeheartedly support single
sex if that was what was re-
quired of him. The trustees,
however, made what he came to
believe was the better choice.
He, by the way, should be
credited with offering one of the
most cogent observations to sur-
face during the coeducation
debate: ‘‘Everyone’s talking
about ‘male camaraderie.’ What
about female camaraderie?”’

The trustees have reached a
conclusion similar to that of
General Lee in April of 1865. It
was time to cut their losses while
what they had was still worth
saving. Lee realized that the
losses he was sustaining were
unacceptable, that to continue
would invite further decimation
of his turf, and that his men’s
commitment to the cause was
waning. The trustees have made
a similar decision.

We have the rare opportunity

to take a unique and still strong
institution and propel it to even
greater distinction.

The trustees aren’t trying to
take our paradise away from us;
they’re making it possible for us
to enhance it.

The pursuit of excellence, both
in ourselves and in future
students, is the key to the con-
tinued vitality and superiority of
the University.

The time is now. The chance is
ours. The fate is Washington and
Lee’s.

WGL going first class

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

Last summer, before the ques-
tion of coeducation was placed
squarely on Washington and
Lee’s agenda, I was talking with
a co-worker who graduated from
William and Mary College, a
relatively small but highly
regarded coeducational school
in Williamsburg.

The conversation turned to
colleges, and, inevitably, to
Washington and Lee coeduca-
tion. Although partially in jest, a
comment my colleague made
that day forever will remain in
my mind.

“Washington and Lee is being
dragged, kicking and scream-
ing, into the 20th century,” he
said.

I believed then that his com-
ment was fairly accurate, and
since, I have come to realize that
it was even more so. Now, after
last weekend’s decision, we have
really entered the 20th century.

And if each of us works at
making coeducation succeed,
Washington and Lee once again
can join the ranks of the most il-
lustrious colleges in the nation —
a position the school certainly
deserves.

No longer will we have to be
dragged into the 20th century.
We can now move into the 21st
century with our head held high,
knowing that we had the courage
to make a decision — in many
ways unpopular and in all ways
difficult — that will benefit this
university.

Many people assume that Lex-
ington and Washington and Lee
are quiet during the summer.
This is not entirely so. A group of
17-year-olds, rising high school
seniors known as Summer
Scholars — both male and
female — were on campus this

month, participating in various |

programs the university offers.

Also on campus this past week
were tourists — again both male
and female — from all over the
country.

They, too, marveled at the
beauty and grace of Washington
and Lee, and its history and
quality.

We must ask: If they had
visited Blacksburg, would they
have toured Virginia Tech?

New student body president reacts to coed decision

To the editors:

The result of this weekend’s
decision is one that will no doubt
hit a nerve in the heart of
everyone associated with Wash-
ington and Lee.

Never before in W&L’s history
has an issue fostered so much
controversy and stirred so much
emotion. Washington and Lee
has survived many battles and
coed will be another one
—Washington and Lee is and
always will be a distinguished
university, due to its unique
educational atmosphere. It will
continue to produce honorable,
intelligent, well-rounded in-
dividuals who will be the movers
and shakers in our society.

Twenty years ago we were one
of many all-male institutions.
~~We were not simply ‘‘another”’
all-male institution, we were uni-
que and will remain so, for the
same_ reasons, far into the
future. We have a strong tradi-
tion of honor, integrity and
strength of character, along with
the many values and ideals in-
stilled in our university by
General Lee.

After the Civil War, Lee had
been defeated — his belover
South had lost al! that it had
believed in for so long. But he
came to Washington College
with an optimistic attitude that
the future would hoic more
what many believed te he

hopeless

 

strength of character and will to
succeed, he created a fine in-
stitution — a better Washington
and Lee. This may seem trivial
and trite, but we must have
similar courage to strengthen
our university — to use this op-
portunity to bring W&L up to its
full potential.

The chemistry of W&L’s pre-
sent atmosphere will change,
but the fundamental foundation
of the W&L experience will go
on. This weekend’s decision is
hard to swallow. Walking around
campus after the decision, I had
a gut-wrenching feeling in my
stomach that came from the ap-
prehension and uncertainty of
the future. Will the intangibles
so crucial to the W&L experience
be lost, or will the admission of
women strengthen our universi-
ty and all that it stands for?

At one time, Washington and
Lee competed strongly with such
schools as Davidson, Duke and
U.Va. There is no question that
W&L provides a much more uni-
que and broadening education
than these schools, but as of 1983
those schools were only accep-
ting 33 percent of their ap-
plicants to fill their freshman
class, whereas we now accept 60
percent of our applicants. The
percentage has gone from 40

‘recent in 1965 to 49 percent in

982, 57 percent in ’83, and 60 per-
t in ’84. The education: that
‘ers, although unique and

highly regarded by its students
and alumni, is simply not that at-
tractive anymore. I know, as I’m
sure you do, of many who con-
sidered W&L but shied away due
to the single-sex factor —also,
many guys who were W&L
material who came and trans-
ferred due to the all-male
character.

I will truly miss the mystical
all-male quality of W&L, but am
confident that admitting women
is a positive move and one that
will make W&L a stronger in-
stitution in the future.

Contrary to seemingly popular
opinion, it was not President
Wilson who brought coeducation
to the forefront and it is not his
“fault’’ (not a fault at all, in
fact) that we are destined to be a
coeducational institution. I real-
ly believe that we are fortunate
to nave such an outstanding
president. Watching him in the
May board meeting and this
weekend, I have seen an in-
dividual with as much dedica-
tion to Washington and Lee as
any person I have ever seen. His
knowledge and emotions for the
school are admirable and deep-
rooted.

Lastly, let me add that our
present Board of Trustees is the
result of 15 years of careful and
deliberate selection by our
former president, Robert E.R.
Huntley. This board has been
acknowledged as. one of the

strongest groups of individuals
to govern the school in_ its
history. They are all deeply
rooted traditionalists, each of
them as dedicated to the univer-
sity and to the preservation of
the unique quality and character
of education at W&L as the next.
There were tears in their eyes as
they said goodbye to a 235-year-
old tradition, and literally near
tears as they gave their last
statements before the vote.

I know many students and
alumni think W&L’s traditions
have been irrevocably lost. I
hope, though, that you will all
pledge your support for a better
Washington and Lee — the

school we love so much. The
decision was a hard one — one
that took into consideration both
students’ and alumni’s views
very seriously. Almost all day
Friday was ‘spent considering
those opinions. But the decision
has been made and the future
and destiny of W&L has begun a
new course. Listening to W&L’s
Latin motto, “Non in cautus
futuri’’ — ‘“‘Not unmindful of the
future’ — remember this as you
look to tomorrow: We have so
much to gain with a positive at-
titude.

Sincerely,

Cole Dawson

Wilson: ‘Integrity, honor’ make W&L unique

Following are excerpts from
an interview with President
Wilson conducted at Lee House
following the July 14 press con-
ference.

Q. — Throughout the meetings
this weekend, was there ever a
point at which you thought the
board might not be able to reach
a decision?

A. — Well, we spent a long time
discussing the pros and cons of
delay, simply to defer a decision

until students and alumni could |

become more fully acquainted
with the whole range of issues
that the board was struggling
with. That might be efficacious,
but the board finally decided
that would be a very bad thing to
’ do, that it would be better in a
way to reject it than to stretch it
out and to keep secondary
schools, prospective students,
current students and key alumni
all wondering what you were go-
ing to do. I don’t think it was
really necessary. It’s been a long
study, really, about a year.

Q. — What can students who are
here now and will be entering in
the fall do to help smooth the
transition to coeducation?

A. — That is a very, very crucial
part of the whole success that we
hope to achieve. I’m not sure I
have a blueprint in mind now. . .
. I think I’ll sit down with the Ex-
ecutive Committee (in the fall)
and get their suggestions on how
that might work. We’re going to
name a steering committee on
coeducation — they’ll give us ad-
vice and counsel on that. But you
know finally it’s going to depend

upon the generosity of spirit of |

  

the Washington and Lee men to
say that ‘we have a good thing
and we want to share it. The
board has decided we have to
share it with women students
equally and let’s see how to
make it easiest for these girls.’
Q. — Do you think the first few
classes of females might have a
problem fitting in?

A. — I believe that that’s been
the experience at other places —
that’ they have felt they’re going
to be a very small minority for
some years while the numbers
build up. And that’s always a

     

Kien ee §

problem with feeling a little bit
special and a little bit different
before they become integrated
into student life on the
newspaper staff, the radio sta-
tion, student government. That
will take probably a few years. I
am sure there are ways of doing
things, ways of talking, ways of
pretending women aren’t there
that we’ll have to try to remold,
all of us. It will require some
sensitivity. At Yale I think they

found a lot of their organiza-
tional structure had to change.
The Outdoor Club never dreamt
that there would be women ap-
plying. Well, they applied. But I
trust we’ll have little difficulty
with that. But I must say, at
first, when I discovered last fall
how strongly the students felt, or
at that time felt, I was never
sure whether the students were
simply reacting to the idea or
whether they were taking real
thought about the future and
well-being of their alma mater. I
think, as the year went on, as

_ more and more factors were

brought out into the open, that
some of that sharp antagonism
tended to soften.

Q. — Why did you take so long to
express directly your opinion on
the issue?

A. — Let me say this, that my
opinion was formed, again, over
an evolutionary process over
time. I had a meeting with my
staff up on the mountain in July
of last summer. Of course, I ar-
rived in January. My faculty
conversations began then in
earnest; I had had fall conversa-
tions with staff about various
aspects of university life. Thén
when I got here, I started these
faculty conversations and then
my senior dinners went on that
spring. And by May I had learn-
ed enough from the admissions
side about the quality and
declines in the key areas. It is
not easy to dismiss the fact that
we have fewer students from the
upper quintile of their high
school graduating classes today
than we had 15 years ago,
remarkably fewer, you can’t

 

Opinion

If they had visited Richmond,
would they have toured Virginia
Commonwealth University?

Perhaps not. Although both -

are good universities, they .are
missing ‘something that Wash-
ington and Lee has. It’s an in-
tangible that’s difficult to
describe, but it extends beyond
the ‘‘all-male spirit” of which we
are so proud. Perhaps it has
something to do with the stately
Colonnade, its freshly painted
columns shining in the summer
sun, the ivy climbing up the back
of its buildings. Or perhaps it is
the new library and Law School,
modern buildings that blend in
so well with those constructed
200 years ago. Or perhaps it is
the statue of George Washington
atop the building named after
him, visible from anywhere on
campus, seeming to watch over
us all.

Now, though, we can make the
further improvements and
changes necessary to return to
that upper echelon of colleges
and universities. Washington
and Lee can once again become
a force to be reckoned with,
rather than a small, liberal] arts
school in the Shenandoah Valley
that is offering a choice fewer

ss iH . « r +tHyy o
and fewer college-age students

seem to want.

Washington and Lee’s doors no
longer will be closed to women.
No longer will we have to turn
away more than 50 percent of the
population. No longer will the
fine education of Washington
and Lee be available to men
alone.

That, I believe, is the crucial
point. What right does (or did)
Washington and Lee have to
deny an education to a woman?

Those tourists this weekend,
those Summer Scholars, ob-
viously found the Washington
and Lee campus and atmos-
phere enjoyable and enlighten-
ing. Several female Summer
Scholars promised to apply here
next year for the fall of 1985.
They realize that the first few
classes of women at Washington
and Lee may have difficulties,
but they were willing to risk that
for a chance to participate in the
Washington and Lee experience.

And we have no right to deny
them that opportunity, based on
a philosophy that became out-
dated in the mid-1900s and seems
archaic today.

The Board of Trustees made
the right decision this weekend
— the decision that had to be
made. In many cases, they may
have put their true persona! feel-

ings aside for the betterment of
this university.

The debate over coeducation
undoubtedly has been long. It
has lasted sporadically for more
than 15 years. Opinions have
fluctuated wildly. Students,
faculty and alumni have
disagreed on the issues. There
has been a great deal of discus-
sion about this university and its
place in American collegiate
society.

But this introspective discus-
sion, whether for or against
coeducation, has been helpful.
We have undergone a rigorous
process of self-examination and
have found faults with the
system in areas other than those
related to coeducation. Without
question, Washington and Lee
has lost something by the deci-
sion — but we have gained more.

With the settlement of the
coeducation question, we can
now turn to fixing those other
problems. Now is the time to put
aside the arguments and the bit-
terness, the slogans and the
bumper stickers.

We all must join together, so
that Washington and Lee can
stride boldly and aggressively
into the future — as the two
great men who gave us our name
would have wanted us to do

just say, ‘Well, heck.’ That’s an
important factor in keeping this
place strong and in keeping the
respect of the school. When I
spoke to the alumni association
in May, I said, ‘I’m going to
mention something you’re not
going to want me to mention but
it’s something I think we’re go-
ing to have to look at.’ That was
in May, but I was still a long way
from knowing what my own
mind would be. Last summer,
when I was up on the mountain
with my staff — just the ad-
ministration, we spent two days
up there — and that was only one
topic, but it was the last one, and
we talked it all through. At that
point, I said, ‘I really do think
this is something that the
board’s going to have to look at.’
But I am not sure even then that
I was then tending toward a
positive evaluation of the pro-
spect. But I have — oh, I can’t
remember how many alumni
groups I’d met by that time;
there were not all that many, it
was in the next year that I went
out to some 30 or 40. I talked to
people from the paper I wrote in
October, I started to get feed-
back. And that’s when you start
to question yourself. I had self-
doubts about this all along. I did
think it was right to raise the
questions associated with it. But
I was perfectly prepared, for ex-
ample, to have the board say, ‘I
think it’s the right thing to do,
probably, but this is the wrong
time to do it or that the alumni
disaffection might be so strong
as to make it not wise.’ So I
didn’t declare myself early
because I hadn’t really made up
my mind in any firm, firm way
until fairly recently. It was pret-
ty widely known that I wouldn’t
have. permitted the subject to
arise at all if I had found it an ab-
solutely unacceptable alter-
native to the university. That’s
what upset some of the alumni.
They assumed that I must have
come here with my mind made
up. I came here, having talked
with the board about it, the
board committee on presidential
search, and that committee said,
‘How do you feel about coeduca-
tion? How do you think about
coeducation?’ We talked at some
length, and I said I thought that
the institution’s decision in the
earlier years not to endorse
coeducation was admirable if it
was proud of what it was doing
and if it was healthy and it was
expert at educating men in isola-
tion, . . . then I had not any
logical difficulty with that. If, on
the other hand, we entered into
difficulties, I said that then I
wouldn't hesitate to raise it with
the board. And they said, ‘Well,
we would want you to do that.’

Q. — Which of the advantages of
coeducation was the most impor-

tant to the board?

A. — The academic quality,
without question.

Q. — Even more than the
demographics?

A. — Oh, yes. The question that
the board asked is ‘How can this

institution improve its academic
standing, ensure its reputation
of academic excellence?’ That
was the question. ‘And by re-
maining all-male, what chances
do we have of that? By changing,
what chances do we have of
that?’ The board committees all
reported out in due course. The
Campus Life committee con-
cluded in its examination that
co-curricular life, extra-
curricular life would on balance
be better with men and women
together. The Academic Affairs
committee report said on
balance, in fact, the academic
quality of our students would im-
prove and the quality of
discourse in the classroom and
the whole ambiance of the
academic side of life.

Q. — You said that Washington
and Lee was unique in ways
other than being all-male. Now
that. we are coeducational, what
are some of those other ways in
which we are unique?

A. — Of course, any institution
can make claims of that sort, but
I do think there’s a pattern of
success here that is traceable to
a heightened sense of mutual
caring. I don’t want to exag-
gerate that, but I think the
students have a lot of respect for
each other and look out for each
other and have a lot of respect
for the faculty and vice versa, so
that creates an environment of,
we call it civility, but of mutual
trust. That translates still fur-
ther into an absolute willingness
by the faculty to meet with
students and to be of help to
them, in their personal lives as
well as in their academic work,
and that, in turn, I think, has
managed to contribute to the
cultivation of self-confidence,
and ultimately we have a
greater measure of success in
the world. I think that it is im-
portant for us to try to recruit
classes with the same human
qualities in our women students
that we’ve managed over the
years to have represented in our
male student population. In
other words, I think character
and integrity and honor and a
desire to learn — all of these
things are important parts of
Washington and Lee and I am
most anxious to ensure that
those qualities are enhanced by
our women students.
Q. Do you think we’ll have any
problem recruiting women?
A. I think the whole admissions
area is going to be very difficult
for all colleges and universities,
when the University of Penn-
sylvania opens a West Coast of-
fice of admissions, and Oberlin
sends out messages to its alumni
hat new admissions efforts are
oing to be required to get
through this decade — these are
strong institutions, coeduca-
tional institutions — I have no
doubt that our work will be cut
out for us. I think this decision
will help us in that work, but I
don’t think it will provide some
quick solution.

News Editor

Although Washington and
Lee’s athletic department will
feel many of the effects of
coeducation, Athletic Director
William McHenry expressed op-
timism that the changes will not
be too drastic.

One of the major concerns in
the athletic department was that
coeducation without an increase
in total enrollment — the change
approved by the Board of
Trustees July 14 — would reduce
the pool of prospective male
athletes, causing a drop in the
quality of W&L sports.

But McHenry said in an inter-
view after the decision that only
the sports with larger squads
—such as football, baseball and
soccer — will feel the effects.

“J think probably in some
sports there won’t be a negative

effect at all,”’ McHenry said.
At the press conference an-

nouncing the coed decision,
university President John D.
Wilson predicted a $150,000 in-
itial cost for the changes needed
on the Warner Center.

McHenry said these will in-
clude dividing the locker room in
half, providing separate en-
trances to the weight room and
the old pool, and adding more of-
fices on the upper level of the
gym. :

Another change required by
coeducation will be the addition
of female staff members, in-
cluding a women’s athletic
director anda trainer.

“I would hope that there would
not be an elimination of any of
our current coaches and
teachers,” McHenry said.

McHenry predicted that addi-
tional field space, which he said
was needed even if W&L remain-
ed all-male, would include an ar-
tificial, all-weather field, an all-
weather track and one or two
more playing fields.

The first female varsity sports
to be introduced will probably be
limited to individual] sports, such
as swimming, track, golf and
cross-country, McHenry said,
with five or six sports offered in
the first two years and 10 to 12
within five years.

 

Coed

Cj continued from page 1

Some of the 17 fraternities
‘could go under”’ because of the
decreased male _ population,
Wilson said, although he noted
that some of those are already
financially unstable.

‘We do have a commitment to
our fraternities,’’ Wilson added.
‘“‘Even now, they’re undergoing
some self-reformation, and
we’re going to encourage that in
every way possible.”’

The possibility of sororities on
campus will be discussed when
the women arrive in 1985, Wilson
said. J

Twenty-two of the board’s 25
members are alumni.

Thomas K. Wolfe, who was
elected to the board in
December but ‘has not been
sworn in, did not, attend., the
meeting because ‘of a ‘weekend
deadline on the serialized novel
he is writing for Rolling Stone.

T. Hal Clarke voted by

telephone from Scotland, where
he was traveling, and J. Alvin
Philpott voted by telephone from
North Carolina.

A number of press accounts of
the event took note of the days on
which the trustees’ discussions
were held. ‘“‘Yes, we know that
yesterday was Friday the 13th
and that today is Bastille Day,”
News Office Director Jeffrey G.

Hanna said in a press kit
distributed at the news con-

ference.

Wilson said in an interview
before the meeting that he
hadn’t expected ‘fhe degree of
broader public i@ferest in the
decisionhere.”

“The hoopla conénues around
us,” he said. ‘That all, frankly,
surprises me, but: it does in-
dicate that Washington and Lee
has a special place in Virginia
and in the South, especially. Peo-
ple are interested in what hap-
pens here.”’ st a

Wilson, who assumed the
presidency early in 1983, receiv-
ed criticism from several

quarters while the debate and ~

study on coeducation were in
progress. Prior to the trustees’
meeting, he was asked how a
decision one way or the other
would affect him as a person and
as an administrator.

‘“ There are some who do
believe that I came with a set-
tled mind on the question and
are in some measure alienated
from me personally,” he said.

“If the decision is to admit
young women to degree can-
didacy, how soon will the
students and alumni members
who opposed it reconcile
themselves to it? Will they at all,
and if so, when? Mixed up in
that, somehow, is how soon, if at
all, they will be willing to give
support to my administration.”

The issue of coeducation has
been debated frequently at
W&L, beginning in 1888.

 

The Board of Trustees’ decision to begin admitting women to
Washington and Lee in the fall of 1985 evoked many reactions from

faculty, students and staff who were on campus for the decision:

¢ Former EC President Robert C. Jenevein, who once vigorously
opposed coeducation but says he has since modified his position,
looked tired and disconsolate after the meeting, but said he hoped
the students would make coeducation work.

“They have to open their arms to the new Washington and Lee,”’
he said. ‘‘That won’t be impossible by any stretch of the imagina-
tion.”’

e Nearly 100 faculty and students watched the press conference
on television monitors in Reid Hall. For the most part, they greeted
Ballengee’s words with applause and listened attentively to the re-
mainder of the press conference, chuckling appreciatively at the
appropriate moments.

¢ Among those watching with interest was Peter Whitehead, who
graduated in May but was one of the leading pro-coeducation
students. Whitehead had unfurled a banner at the Mock
Democratic Convention that read: “Better Coeds than
Deadheads.’

“I think the trustees made an unpopular decision, but it was a
good one,”’ Whitehead said. ‘‘I am pleased. Now I think we’ll see
better male and female students.”

-e Another student who came to Lexington to hear the decision
was Scott Tilley, a rising senior and opponent of coeducation.

“I was very disappointed,”’ Tilley said. ‘“‘Up to the last moment, I
didn’t think they’d doit.

“‘T think Washington and Lee as an institution is going to thrive
and will continue, but I have the feeling that as of today, the
Washington and Lee I’ve come to know and love no longer exists.’’

¢ Dr. Louis W. Hodges, a professor of religion and ethics who led
a committee which studied coeducation in 1969, called it ‘‘just a
splendid decision.”’

“I can’t imagine anything that would have done more to improve
the. education environment,’’ he said. ‘‘The board is to be com-
mended. They worked at it very carefully, and rendered what is
certainly the right decision.” ‘

¢ A faculty member who opposed coeducation and asked not to be
identified because he says he plans ‘‘to keep a low profile hence-
forth,” said the initial female applicants to W&L are likely to be
‘young ladies on the prowl.”’

‘“‘Washington and Lee is going to become Fort Lauderdale
North,”’ he said. ‘‘Most girls are going to enroll here because this is
‘Where the Boys Are.’ ”’

e In the face of all the philosophical and academic viewpoints of
the day, some were more concerned about the practical implica-
tions of the decision. ‘‘Big John” Alexander, who has been a W&L
custodian for 10 years, said he opposed coeducation.

‘“‘Women are one of the most beautiful things God put on earth,
but they’re so much messier than men,” he said very seriously.

¢ Betty Munger, who said she advocated coeducation in the 16
years she was the W&L bookstore manager, was amused but not
surprised at all the media attention given the vote. ‘‘It is interesting
that a small college in the backhills of Virginia should be debating
whether to educate women,” she said.

e As President John D. Wilson exited the news conference, he
made a jesting reference to his daughter, Sara, who will be a high
school junior in the fall.

‘IT want you all to know my daughter won’t be coming here,” he
said. ‘I didn’t want to be accused of being self-serving.”

Shortened Rush, tighter rules spark criticism

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

New Interfraternity Council rules that
put greater constraints on the frater-
nities and additional pressure on the
freshmen drew criticism from fraternity
leaders as Rush began this week, even as
administration officials defended the
changes.

This year’s Rush program is the
shortest in recent years, with less than
two weeks separating the beginning and
end of the annual fall event.

A frequently voiced criticism concern-
ed the requirement that freshmen sign
up for their eight open houses after only
“no contact” days, effectively meaning
that they had to eliminate nine of the 17
houses without ever having visited
them.

New restrictions this year include no
alcohol, women or music at the 10 Rush
Dates, which begin this evening.

Bids may not be extended until the fifth
Rush Date, which is scheduled for Mon-
day, the first day of classes.

A sharply altered Rush program was
originally proposed by the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee on Fraternity Affairs, which was
formed last fall by University President
John D. Wilson. The committee was com-
posed of three students and four
members of the staff and faculty.

The final rules for this year’s Rush are
the result of a compromise between the
committee report, which proposed a one-
week Rush, and an IFC counter-proposal
for a three-week program.

Wilson said he advocates a second-
semester Rush, which he says would in-
terfere less with freshman academic per-
formance.

The president also said he would like to
see a shift in what he admits is the
widespread perception that he is ‘‘out to
get”’ the fraternities.

“Fraternities and Rush in particular
were in desperate need of reform when I
came here,” he said. ‘“Their numbers
had dropped from about 85 percent (of
Students) to 63 percent. That kind of

- decline should have signaled the frater-

nities themselves that they had pro-
blems.”’

“If I had wanted to weaken the frater-
nity system, why would we have spent so
much colonizing Sigma Nu?” he asked.
“T continue to have faith that this frater-
nity system can keep from going down-
hill.”

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of
students for fraternity affairs, said that
although the shortened Rush period is un-

fortunate, it is possible to have a suc-
cessful two-week Rush.

“The calendar doesn’t make too many
people happy,” he said. “I’m not a total
advocate of what’s being done, but it’s a
compromise.’”

English Professor John M. Evans, who
chaired the ad hoc committee, is op-
timistic about the alterations.

“The freshmen may not have had time
to meet fraternity members before open
house sign-up, but we had a more specific
rush book to help them get ready,’’ he ex-
plained.

Fraternity presidents and _ rush
chairmen varied in their criticisms of the
new system, but were nearly unanimous
in denouncing it.

“Rush is way too short — it’s wrong,”
contends Phi Delta Theta President

Team seeks fifth sls season

By MIKE STACHURA _
Sports Editor

 

You’d think a football team that’s lost four of
five starters from its offensive line, including an
All-American, as well as half of its defensive
starters would look to merely survive the storm of
its next season.

You’d think that way unless you happened to be
playing football for Washington and Lee under
head coach Gary Fallon.

Fallon’s Generals go looking for a record-setting
fifth straight winning season Saturday afternoon
in the friendly confines of Wilson Field against
non-conference foe Dickinson.

W&L’s seventh-year leader sees a confident
group of upperclassmen taking charge of his 1984
squad.

“Our upperclassmen are going to settle for
nothing less than what we experienced last year,”’
he said. Last season the Generals finished at 6-3,
tied for second place in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference, had 11 players named to Aill-

Conference squads and broke six team and in-
dividual records.

Fallon is somewhat more reserved in his op-
timism, but says he is just as confident in his
players capabilities.

“The season could go 10-0, or it could go 0-10. I
just don’t know, but I do know that if we’re on our
game, we’re going to give people some problems.”’

“We’ve got to stay healthy, we’ve got to
prepare, we’ve got to maintain our high, positive
attitude, and,”’ he said, pausing, ‘‘the bounces
have got to go our way now and then.”

Offensively, the Generals return a veteran
backfield. Leading the way for W&L will be senior
tailback and tri-captain Gene Girard. The record-
smashing back earned Honorable Mention All-
America status while rushing for 1,011 yards, the
first General to eclipse the 1,000-yard barrier
since the end of subsidized athletics in 1954.

Girard is joined by last year’s starting quarter-
back, Bobby Wilson, who completed over 52 per-
cent of his aerials in 1983, blocking fullback Frank

Thomas J. Fellin of Penn-
sylvania, who had been sleeping
on the second floor.

Less than a month before the
Lexington fire, Mesner was con-
victed on an arson charge stem-
ming from a dormitory fire in
New Jersey.

Mesner was arrested less than
90 minutes after the four-man,
three-woman grand jury return-
ed the indictments Tuesday. He
was at the Catawba Emporium,
a restaurant in Roanoke’s
Crossroads Mall where he work-
ed as a waiter.

In an exclusive telephone in-
terview shortly before four Lex-
ington and Roanoke County law
enforcement agents arrived to
take him into custody, Mesner
said he knew he was a suspect in
the fraternity house fire.

“Several of my friends were
questioned pertaining to this
event — whether they were with
me and whether they thought I
could have done it,”’ he said.

Mesner said he ‘‘knew the per-
son who died and one other’’ at
the fraternity. He said he knew
Fellin because ‘I dated his
girlfriend’s roommate.”

He said he learned of the fire
from friends who saw accounts
of it in the newspaper, and added
that ‘‘there’s no way I could
have done it.”’

“T was home at 12:30 on the
night of the fire and my parents
saw me,” he said. Police say the
Lexington blaze began about 4

learned he was being in-

conducted the interviews with
Mesner’s friends. Mesner said
Spence had not responded to the

Enough

is enough

University President John
D. Wilson says the school is
“not interested”’ in promoting
the admission of women to the
fraternities. Several schools
have done so following the
decision to admit women to
their undergraduate pro-
grams.

“The experiments that have
been tried in other places of
opening up national frater-
nities to women seem to me to
be neither successful nor
called for,’’ Wilson said.

“The argument for it is that
all university programs, even
fraternities, should be open to
students regardless of gender.
I don’t believe that follows as
necessary from anything I
know about collegiate life.”’

Review and Outlook

Speaking of Tradition

As we settle into Lexington for yet another year,
and the hustle and bustle of fraternity Rush and
Orientation Week evolves into the more mundane
routine of classes and the occasional party, perhaps
this is a time for Washington and Lee students to con-
sider both the past and the future of their venerable
institution.

Last year undoubtedly was memorable — drug
allegations, fraternity problems, and, yes, even the
necktie debate, dominated the news. Even more so,
though, last year will be remembered for the spirited
debate about whether to admit women undergrad-
uates.

With the Board of Trustees’ July 14 decision to
begin admitting women next fall, discussion of the
coeducation issue has decreased noticeably in the
first few days of this year.

This perhaps is not so bad. It gives us a chance to
reassess other aspects of the W&L experience while
preparing for the first class of women next year,
when further discussion and news should result.

Some are disappointed about the coeducation deci-
sion. Others are elated. Whatever their personal opin-
ions, most would agree that we have lost a tradition.

But while we may have lost one, let us not squander
the opportunity to retain others. One that easily could
be renewed is the speaking tradition.

A former student committee used to discipline
students who didn’t speak to each other when they
passed on campus. One would hope — indeed, insist
—that re-creation of that committee not be necessary.
Common courtesy and civility dictates that we — as
Washington and Lee gentlemen — greet each other,
whether on campus, in town or ina dormitory.

Washington and Lee prides itself — and rightfully
so — on its small size and personal atmosphere. What
better way to re-establish that pride and that reputa-
tion than merely to say ‘‘Hello’’ when passing some-
one on campus? It is the very least we can do to
preserve the future of this university.

This year could be perceived as a lull between the
storms. Let us take advantage of that respite to im-
prove the University and make it an even better place
for future generations of students — male and female
— toenjoy for years tocome.

And maybe we can even get some studying done.

Two views on Rush
Short Rush great for profs, not students

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

Death and taxes, some say,
are the only certainties in life. I
disagree. Add to that list one
more item — a lack of consensus
on how Rush should be run and
‘what freshmen ought to know
about it.

As an independent by choice,
not a lack of bids, I think Rush is
great. Sure, it is a bit unrealistic,
but what during the first few
weeks of school is normal? What
better way to get to know your
fellow students (‘‘brothers’’)
than to talk to them over plastic
filled with beer — er, I mean soft
drinks, with all the new rules
—while a line-up of attractive
belles giggle as compliments are
dished up by freshmen eager to
receive that bid? After all, that
is fraternity life, isn’t it?

Wrong.

And that is where we need to
examine the system in greater

detail. This year’s two-week

 

Khakis, not acne

By MIKE McALEVEY
and SCOTT HENDERSON
Phi Columnists

It’s that time again: incoming
freshmen, scheduling, matricu-
lation, meetings with advisers
and, yes, resumption of the
Washington and Lee social
habits. Of course, heading the
list comprising the latter is the
fraternity Rush scene.

My View

Not to miss an opportunity to
lure unaware and often insecure
freshmen, each fraternity has
strategically posted its Open
House sign-up booth directly in
the center of the freshman dorm-

 

rushed Rush is great for the pro-
fessors and no one else. Granted,
some hope Rush-wearied
freshmen will now attend class
more readily and get better
grades and perform just as pro-
fessors desire. Gotta whip these
boys into academic shape, they
say. Rush over a _ four-week
period is distracting.

But while their intentions are
good, they are also misguided.
The question here is not so much
the distraction and length of
Rush, but the role which frater-
nities (the traditional center of
social life at W&L) play in rela-
tionship to the University’s role
as educator and, for at least a
freshman’s first two weeks and
no more, surrogate parent. The
important decisions made dur-
ing Rush — including potential
expenditures for fraternity
membership of $5,000 over four
years — deserve greater atten-
tion than a two-week preview.

Reforming Rush is not easy,
nor is it necessarily the solution.

 

itories. Ask you: How is one ex-
pected to make his choice for
Open House dates? Simple.
Some houses use the sure-fire
deployment of beautiful females
to attract attention. Others may
rely on sheer numbers of cloned
fraternity men to generate in-
terest. The false representation
of the house by a couple of face
men has also been successful,
and this is only the first step
whereby our naive youth will be
transformed into model W&L

gentlemen.

Quickly comes the initial
period of evaluation itself — the
Open House. This evaluation is a
two-way street with both fresh-
men and fraternities trying to
create good impresssions while

poe ES

Someone will always complain.
Delayed Rush — theoretically
the best alternative — means
financial havoc for frats and the
prospect of a two-semester
Rush, since freshmen would un-
doubtedly visit fraternities in the
fall anyway. The four-week
Rush, we were told, kept fresh-
men away from their studies ina
time crucial to forming study
habits for their college life. And
a two-week Rush means quick
decisions and little under-
standing of what frat life is all
about.

Perhaps one area which could
be helped is better informing the
freshmen about the fraternity
system. This year’s Rush Book
at least published the financial
figures and guidelines for
membership in each house. Per-
haps in the future, a letter to
freshmen prior to their arrival
on campus outlining the fraterni-
ty system would be helpful. In-

simultaneously judging. Each
sportily clad freshman is
sported off to the house at the ap-

pointed hour in the most im- -

pressive and sporty cars at the
house’s disposal. This tradition
creates a veritable parade of
BMWs, Porsches, Saabs, Corvet-
tes, etc. Then come the sticky
Coke handshakes and potato
chip infested smiles shrouded in
either apprehension or con-
descension, depending on the
point of view. Throughout these
brief encounters, the omniscient

Perdue ‘not really sausfi ed’ with Rush rules

The following is a partial transcript of a
conversation Monday among Interfraternity
Council President David Perdue and Ring-
tum Phi chief editors Bruce Potter and
Mike Allen, Perdue is a senior from Atlanta.

Phi: There are quite a few changes in
the Rush rules from those of previous
years. Are you Satisfied with the set of
rules you’ve been given to work with?

Perdue: No, I’m not really satisfied.
Rush is such a touchy subject. There’s no
really good way to do it...We’ve thought
about all the different options and how it
would be easiest on the freshmen and
easiest on us. A one-week rush has been
done in years past, and apparently it’s
been very successful in the past, 20 years
ago. But before it starts, it’s hard for me
to envision one-week rush being very suc-
cessful because I think a lot of people can
get left out.

Phi: Is the short schedule your main
concern and the reason you're not
satisfied?

Perdue: The fraternities would all love
to have more parties and everything. But
the freshmen aren’t as concerned about
not having as many parties as they are
that they’re narrowing it down to eight
houses without ever having met anybody
at any of the fraternities, and I think that
a lot of people may get missed. With 17
fraternities, if you narrow it down to
eight, you may get missed by a fraterni-
ty, or you may miss a fraternity you like.
I’m a little concerned that some people
may get missed, but we’ll just have to
see. I plan on setting up some kind of
committee after rush is over that’l] go on
all year and try to doa little bit of evalua-
tion and try to come up with a little better
system for next year.

Phi: Rush for you all was five weeks,
then it was four, last year it was three,
and now we’re down to two. What does
this mean? Is this a trend to no Rush at
all?

Perdue: Well, the option of delaying
Rush until maybe after Christmas has
been toyed with. The option of having it
long is pretty much out — I don’t think
they like the idea of a long Rush, which is
understandable when the freshmen are
up here, and right off the bat get thrown
into all that confusion. Something’s got to
be done to appease both sides. The
freshmen have got to be protected, and
the fraternities have to be protected...

Phi: The argument, usually, against
the delayed Rush is financial. Is that
such a concern that that could never be a
reality here?

Perdue: The financial burden would be
hard on the fraternities, but I imagine
they could survive that. I think if ... they
had a delayed Rush, then it would be no-
holds-barred for three months before
that actual Rush started. If it’s put off un-
til after Christmas, I think it would be no-
holds-barred Rush from day one anyway.
That’s a certain possibility. That’s a fault
against that and a fault against the one
we have now because after two weeks it
may continue to be a no-holds-barred
Rush anyway.

Phi: There’s a perception that with the
shorter Rush period and with these dif-
ferent rules, that there’s going to be a lot
of dirty rushing and perhaps more rule-
breaking than we’d expect. Do you think
that’s a valid perception?

Perdue: Dirty rushing is always going
to take place, regardless. I think maybe
people feel pressured in this one week
and they have to go a lot faster in the one
week to make up for a lack of time, sc
maybe dirty rushing will take plaee...

 

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi
IFC President David Perdue

 

 

 

 

Dorm counselors are going to be keeping
a lookout and, of course, the IFC judicial
board’s going to be keeping a lookout.
Other than that, I can just call on
everybody to play by the rules as best as
they can.

Phi: There seems to be a perception
that Rush rules are made to be broken.
Does the IFC expect some infractions
here and close its eyes to some rules and
not to others?

Perdue: A lot of times, they honestly
aren't brought to our attention. There are
expected to be infractions, certainly. You
can’t expect anything otherwise...
Whatever’s brought to our attention,
we'll just have to dole out the
discipline....

Phi: You mentioned that in the short
time, there may be a lot of people left
behind. Do you think that deferred Rush
will become a bigger thing now than
perhaps it has been in the last few years?

Perdue: It may. I hope it will. I hope
that everything works out as best it can
during that week and a half, and then I
hope that people don’t just’ completely
drop the idea. I hope that deferred Rush
does continue. It’s not kind of talked
about in the past, it’s just kind of
something that goes on. There’s not real-
ly any guidelines or rules, But I’d like to
see a lot more deferred Rush and I'd like
people to keep their interest up. Cer-
tainly, there may be a lot of people that
are going to be left out. Deferred Rush,
on their own, without rules or organiza-
tion, is fine.

Phi: You mentioned that there’s a very
short time for the freshmen to evaluate
the houses. Let’s look at it the other way
for a moment. Is this a very realistic way
for the houses to evaluate the freshmen?

Perdue: That’s certainly possible. I
see a lot of problems in that. After sitting
around and drinking iced tea and Coca-
Cola and talking with a guy for an hour
and a half, a week later you have to
decide whether to invite him to join your
fraternity for four years. So, there’s cer-
tainly a lot of room for that to happen;
it’s just going to be up to the individual

fraternities to handle that problem.
Hopefully, we can figure out a better
way. I don’t mean to sound negative
about Rush at all; I think it’s going to
work out very well... think really,
basically, it’s a good plan. I’m a little
concerned with how short it is, but if
everything all the older men I’ve spoken
to have said is true, it shouldn’t be a pro-
blem. I’ve spoken with a lot of people
who’ve said they went through a one
week Rush ... they said it’s no problem.
You just have to be on your toes for that
week and really concentrate on just look-
ing at these guys and really getting
organized about it.

Phi: With all the discussion about the
fraternity system and coeducation and
the shorter Rush, is this going to be a
more intense Rush than in past years?

Perdue: Oh, I’m sure it will be a more
intense Rush. You’re going to have to be
more intense if you’re going to compete
with other houses for freshmen. You’re
going to have to be intense, I think.

Phi: Is that a good thing, to be that in-
tense? Does it give the freshmen the real

idea of what fraternities are all about?

Perdue: We’! just have to say I really
don’t know. I can’t really tell.

Phi: You’re familiar with all 17 houses.
It’s no secret that some of them are
fighting for their survival with this Rush.
Without naming them, how many houses

: are in that precarious position?

Perdue: When they start letting girls
here, there are going to be some houses. I
don’t want to put out a number, I really
don’t but there are going to be some
houses that are just going to diminish.
There are such small numbers, there’s
no way they can survive...This is going to
be a crucial year for those houses.

Phi: At least one administration has
used the term ‘‘eating club,”’ in which,
rather than the bid-and-accept system,
you’re assigned to a fraternity. As cer-
tain houses get weaker and we get the
women here, is that something that
perhaps some people see down the road
for our fraternity system?

Perdue: This is an important year for
all the fraternities. We’re just going to
really have to dig in our heels, and I think
the Interfraternity Council is going to
have to become a much stronger body,
and the fraternities are going to have to
realize the position they’re in this year
and just make a better self-image for
themselves so they can continue (with
the girls here). I don’t see that the frater-
nity system has to get weaker with the
admission of girls here, but we have to
prepare this year. I think this year we
have to put off a better image and we
have to do better for ourselves. This year
being important, what I’m trying to say,
we’re just going to have to dig in our
heels and be prepared for when the girls
get here, because a lot could happen
then.

Phi: You're saying that if you don’t
project a better image, then down the
road you might become something along
the lines of ‘‘eating clubs’’?

Perdue: I really don’t know.

Phi: Which rules are going to be en-
forced most stringently? What absolute-
ly should a house not break? What rules
are safe to break or fudge on?

Perdue: The rules that I would say are
absolute are no contact rules, which is, of
course, the most important ones,

because a lot of times the freshmen are
just bogged down. Dormitory rush is go-
ing to be a lot less. We want to let the
freshmen go up to the dorms and escape
the whole bit of that during the day and

then be able to go through Rush at night.
The alcohol rules are absolutely impor-
tant. No alcohol at these things. The con-
tact rules are important and taking the
freshmen to and from a fraternity and
not letting them stay around there after a
Rush date. If there’s a party afterward,
they have to take them back, and let the
freshmen choose to come back to that
house.

Phi: Are there any rules safe to fool
around with?

Perdue: Of course, I don’t want to say
that there should be any of these rules
broken. The only rules that are a little bit
intangible are just the dirty rushing
rules, where fraternities portray another
fraternity as being not what it really is.
That always takes place, and there’s no
way to control that kind of stuff. All these
rules, of course, should be followed, and I
really can’t see any that could be skirted.
Usually, the ones that are broken are the
contact rules. Every year, somebody has
freshmen where they’re not supposed to
be or they’re having parties when they’re
not supposed to be having one and there
are freshmen there.

Phi: The dominant feeling of some of
these houses is, we’ll take the fine. It’s a
very deliberate thing. Is there a way to
avoid that? Can you make it painful
enough that those rules won’t be broken?

Perdue: I said at the IFC meeting the
other night, that if these rules are broken
then social probation is going to go along
with that. And that’s going to start up as
soon as Rush is over, and so if a house
wants to portray an image to a freshman
that maybe hasn’t torn, they’re going to
be completely crippled for the next two
weeks, and they can’t have any kind of
parties, or any kind of action, or anything
for two weeks after Rush is over, so
that’s a pretty lousy way to start the
year.

Phi: Are there any big changes in the
rules during pledging?

Perdue: I think hazing has always
been, of course, frowned upon in the past
and strongly frowned upon. This year,
it’s going to be watched after a lot close-
ly. The dorm counselors are going to be
brought in; we’re just going to keep a
strict eye. The administration is, of
course, completely, fed up, with it.

Phi: At what point do you start enforc-
ing it?

Perdue: We’ll just have to decide case
by case. I don’t think W&L ever really
has had a bad problem with hazing, not
like a lot of other schools I’m familiar
with.

Phi: The fraternities are sort of under
fire at this point, some people think, from
the administration and the community.
What are some of the things, specifically,
that the fraternities can do that are con-
structive, that will give them a better im-
age?

Perdue: Well, the fraternities are
under a little bit of fire right now, but I
think we have generally pretty much
support. Of course, most of the alumni
are very supportive of us, and I think that
the administration is even somewhat
supportive, but they would just like to see
a little better image portrayed by the
fraternities, and I can certainly see room
for that. A lot of times it seems like all
the fraternities are just drinking clubs,
and we’d like to portray a little better im-
age. There’s a lot the fraternities can do.

We’d like to get a little more involved
—you know, not just be those big houses
in the middle of town — but be a little
more involved in the community of Lex-
ington,

Reynolds Thompson. ‘‘We stepped up our
summer Rush, but the really bad part of
the formal Rush is those guys having to
sign up for Open Houses before they have

even been to the houses.
‘Nobody knows how bad it will be,”’ he

added’ ‘‘Maybe it will be better than we
think.”’

Gray Sanders, president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, had a similar observa-
tion. ‘‘This year’s freshmen have been
cheated,’’ he said.

“Rush is way too short — 14 days to
choose a fraternity for four years means
there are going to be more misjudgments
on both sides than usual.” ;

Sanders also protested the ban on
females at Rush Dates this year. “‘It’s
ironic that we've let girls into the school
but taken them out of Rush,”’ he noted.

Kappa Sigma President John Haywood

 

 

says the new system ‘‘will only weaken
the fraternity system.”

“It’s ridiculous to think that freshmen
can make a good decision by eliminating
half the frats before they have seen any
of them,” he said. ‘‘They think it’s like
pulling a Band-Aid off a cut. The quicker
it’s done, the less it hurts.”

“The whole idea of Rush system is to
give everybody a fair chance, and the
two-week Rush doesn’t do it,’’ agreed
Sigma Chi President Bobby Pifer.

“It’s shifting the emphasis from school
tosummer Rush, and I think Rush will go
on an extra week here after formal Rush
ends.”’

A number of other house leaders
echoed the view that ‘‘deferred Rush’’
will become increasingly important for
freshmen.

“Rush will continue another couple of
weeks after formal Rush ends,’’ Beta
Theta Pi President George Seavy said,
“It just won’t technically be considered
Rush.”’

“I can see not having beer at Open

Houses, but I don’t understand why we
shouldn’t be allowed to have it at Rush
Dates,”’ he said.

“The new system is going to hurt the
frat system,’’ he concluded. ‘‘Maybe
that’s why it was done.”’

Pi Kappa Alpha President Jamie
Nance said he ‘‘came to W&L for the
social life as well as for the academics.”’

“The key combination is to have smart
students and a strong social life,’’ he
said. ‘‘I want the social life of Gainesville
(University of Florida) with the
academics of Harvard.”’

“TI got it here but they are destroying it
with the intensified party regulation,’’ he
continued. ‘‘The Hill wants to eliminate
about six of us, and this new Rush system
is just designed to crush frats. A two-
week Rush is like kindergarten. It’s like
a teacher giving assigned seats.”

Phi Kappa Sigma President Jim Cobb
sees a possible advantage to the new
system. ‘‘No beer and no girls may give
the guys a better idea of the house — a
real chance to get to know the group bet-

”

ter.

Sigma Nu Rush Chairman Mark
Fishman sharply denounced this year’s
Rush scheme, “It is my belief that the
administration is trying to get rid of
some fraternities with this vastly
shortened Rush,’’ he said.

“T believe that Rush not interfering
with academics is good, but they are go-
ing about it in the wrong way. It’s going
to choke off potential fraternity
members.”

Head Dorm Counselor Bob Tomaso
said ‘“‘many of the freshmen are totally
clueless about fraternities.”’

“Under the system where they can
pledge in a week and a half, I think
there’l] be mistakes all around and a lot
of depledging,’’ he said. ‘‘Whoever made
up this Rush claims they are trying to
protect freshmen by making it quick, but
they really are not.”’

“This pseudo-Rush system is not really
helping them get to know the frater-
nities,’ Tomaso declared. ‘‘It’s kind of
scary.”

Mesner was convicted in Bergen
County Superior Court of setting
an October dormitory fire at
Fairleigh Dickinson University.

A school spokesman said
Mesner was enrolled as a fresh-
man mechanical engineering
major at the time of the fire, and
withdrew following his arrest on
anarson charge on Oct. 22.

Chief Burke said Mesner
received a 30-day suspended
sentence, a $1,000 fine and $50 in
other fees.

Bill Carey, director of public
relations at Fairleigh Dickinson,
said the dormitory fire there
consisted of ‘‘a pile of smolder-

smoke to set off a nearby smoke
detector and which was found in

Carey said the fire caused lit-
tle damage. ‘“‘Mesner was sim-
ply in the area and it proved out
that he had been responsible for
the fire,’’ he added.

Mesner said in the telephone
interview that his prior criminal
record includes ‘“‘traffic of-
fenses’’ and the New Jersey
charge.

“They put me up and tried me
along the same lines as the Lex-
ington case — criminal mis-
chief,”’ Mesner said, adding that
he thought the verdict was
“rather unfair.”

Mesner lives with his parents
on the Hollins College campus.
His father, Thomas Mesner, is a
lecturer in history and a

Three former students
indicted by grand jury

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Three former Washington and
Lee students were among the 20
individuals indicted on drug
charges Tuesday in the wake of
a special grand jury investiga-
tion of local drug trafficking.

A Rockbridge County grand
jury returned indictments on
more than 60 counts of drug-
related felonies, including
possession or distribution of co-
caine, marijuana, LSD and
psilocybin (a hallucinogen deriv-
ed from mushrooms).

The seven-month special
grand jury investigation includ-
ed interviews with more than 200
local residents, including the
W&L president, dean of students
and student body president; the
Virginia Military Institute
superintendent and comman-
dant of cadets; the mayor of
Lexington; and other local of-
ficials.

Records of W&L’s Student
Control Committee, which has
jurisdiction over drug-related
disciplinary matters, were
sought by and turned over to the
special grand jury.

from W&L in the spring of 1983,
was indicted on six counts of
distribution of cocaine between
September 1982 and March 1983.

John H. McLarin of Rich-
mond, who was a senior at W&L
in 1983, was charged with two
counts of conspiracy to possess
cocaine in Lexington.

One of McLarin’s roommates
said he was traveling in Califor-
nia and unavailable for com-
ment.

Marshall L. Shearin Jr. of Nor-
folk, who was a senior last year,
was indicted on four counts of
distributing cocaine in Lex-
ington between December 1982
and May 1983.

Shearin could not be reached
for comment. His father said
Shearin had no previous drug
charges against him.

Former VMI cadets indicted —

by the grand jury included:
Steven J.P. Bruening, charged
with two counts of distributing
LSD; Dana Holladay Neal, in-
dicted for possession with intent
to distribute marijuana; Jeffrey
R. Pack, charged with six counts
of distributing psilocybin; and
Vernon R. Perdue, charged with

distribution of LSD and
psilocybin.

Special grand juries are in-
vestigative bodies which

prepare recommendations for
regular grand juries, which may
then act on indictment requests.

The drug panel issued a report
recommending about 60 indict-
ments, according to Circuit
Court Judge George E. Honts
III.

College ‘basics’

telephones

By PAUL SMITH
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Ring-tum Phi has com-
piled the following to help
students with some of the
“basics” of college life:

* unecking accounts. Although
students may want to keep their
home checking account, local
merchants and bankers recom-
mend that students also open
Lexington accounts.

A spokesperson for Dominion
Bank, N.A., said, ‘‘Students
have difficulty keeping records
of the checks they write.’’ Other
bank representatives also noted
that the time delay associated
with clearing checks and receiv-
ing financial statements from a
home bank make having a Lex-
ington account advantageous.

Lexington has three major
banks, Dominion Bank, United
Virginia Bank and First
American Bank of Virginia, all
of which are branches of state-
wide banks.

First American, 22S. Main St.,
allows free checking as long as
the customer’s balance is more
than $200. If it falls below that,
there is a $4 service fee.

A spokesperson for First

Remember, for an interest-

installs cable service for $25, and
there is an $8 monthly charge.

The Home Box Office channel
can be received for another $9.50
a month. Among the regular
cable channels available in Lex-

ESPN, WTBS from Atlanta,
WTTG and WDCA from Wash-

Cable Channel Nine.

Because of the influx of in-

If you’re still looking for a box,
there are plenty left, according
to a spokesman. ‘‘We’ve com-
pletely filled the main post office
(on the corner of Lee Avenue
and Nelson Street), but we have
many left in the annex (on Jef-
ferson Street next to Domino’s
Pizza).”’

¢ Telephones. The Student
Telephone Union at W&L helps
lessen the cost of telephone ser-
vice for the students, explained
chairman Chris Carter, a
sophomore. A student who joins
STU does not have to pay the $75
deposit to the Central Telephone
Co. of Virginia, or Centel.

In turn, STU guarantees that
Centel will receive the money it
is due. Carter explained that the
STU membership fee ($7 for
first-time members) does not
cover the installation fee (for
those not living in a dormitory),
about $41.80, or the activation
fee.

Centel’s business office is at
102 E. Washington St., and an
STU representative will be there

Mid East weavings displayed in duPont

An exhibit of historic and con-
temporary woolen handweav-
ings from the Middle East will
open the 1984-85 season in
Washington and Lee’s duPont
Gallery.

“Tribal Textiles” from the col-
lection of the Sun Bow Trading
Company in Charlottesville will
go on display Monday, Sept. 10.
The exhibition will continue
through Sept. 28.

In connection with the exhibi-.
tion, Saul Barodofsky and Anan-
da Cronin of the Sun Bow
Trading Company will present a
public lecture at 8 p.m. on
Wednesday, Sept. 19, in duPont
Auditorium. The lecture also is

free and will be followed by a.

reception.
“This is the first textile exhibit
that we have had in the duPont

   

Gallery in quite a long time,”’
said gallery director Debora
Rindge. ‘The exhibition
features a great variety and in-
cludes works from different
tribes as well as contemporary
and ancient pieces exhibited side

by side.”

Most of the items in the exhibi-

rumors) and freshmen will still
find greater fascination in the
lure of the Greek houses than in
the classroom. Social life, in the
short run, will still center around
the fraternities.

My advice to freshmen in
Rush is simple. There does exist
social life beyond fraternities,
and with coeducation, the frater-
nity you join this year may not
exist next year. Search and
decide carefully. Remember
that the stage has sets you'll
never see again and all the ac-
tors have the same lines. But
most of all, enjoy it. It will never
be the same again.

dress, physical attributes and
the Open House date attended. A
fiber of polyester places one in
the 5-8 date category in most
houses, while a dapper navy
Brooks Brothers jacket, Duck-
head khakis and Sperry top-
siders may earn a top spot on the
roster. Long hair, acne, facial
hair and earrings bite the big
one. Weak handshakes, sweaty
palms and nasal mucous are
definite no-no’s that are con-
sidered far more important than
academic or athletic ability or
brotherhood potential. One can
discern initial impressions by
the brothers’ comments such as,
“T like the **** out of him,’ or
“He a good ****er.”’ Either of
these dubious honors should be
good for the privileged 1-4 Rush
Date category.

Regardless of one’s perform-
ance in the Open House prelimi-
naries, advancement into the
precarious second round of Rush
Dates is assured. The number of
each person’s Rush Date should
cue him as to what his chances
are for that elusive award of ap-
proval known as a bid. A number
1 denotes profound interest,
whereas a 7 or 8 is far less en-
couraging.

The crowning achievement
each one strives for is the bid.
This decision, of course, is arriv-
ed at by the brothers through no
easy means. Painstaking delib-

eration often leads to heated
debate which occasionally
erupts into violence of a sub-
human nature, whereby more
animosity is generated than is
brotherly love.

What does all this work from
both parties result in? Golden
showers of beer, a din greater
than that evoked by a Ted
Nugent concert, songs sug-
gesting perverted sex acts,
humanly impossible feats of
alcohol consumption and the
maladies associated with both.

This article is not intended as
an indictment of the entire
fraternity system — quite the
contrary, in fact. The social
function the houses serve with
respect to organizing activities
with our sister schools, in-
tramurals, and promoting in-
teraction among W&L students
is commendable. The problem
lies in the lack of time permitted
by a compacted early fall Rush
both for freshmen to become ac-
quainted with the various frater-
nities and for the brothers of the
house to be able to make sound
judgments as to the acceptibility
of the freshmen. After all, which
is more important — the finan-
cial security of the houses during
those early weeks of the fall, or
the proper academic adjustment
to the rigors of college studying
and the ability to make a well-
informed fraternity choice?

Fraternities accountable for
actions, Chief Sutton says

 

By JON MILES
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton feels he’s developed a
strong, positive relationship
with Washington and Lee frater-
nities, but he says that won’t pre-
vent him from “enforcing all
laws fairly and completely.”’

Although there are no plans to
increase patrols during Rush
beyond the two to six cars nor-
mally on the streets, Sutton cau-
tioned that fraternities are ‘‘ac-
countable” for their actions.

Sutton cited excessive noise
and alcohol consumption as the
most pressing concerns of his
department during the two-week

Rush period and during other
major party weekends.

“Many times, the noise can
get out of control if people are
drinking,’ Sutton said yester-
day. ‘‘The two seem to go
together.”’

Sutton added that the police
are obliged to investigate any
complaints or violations of
“noise permits’ ‘‘amplified
sound permits,’ actually
—issued to houses.

The sound permit form re-
quires the name of the individual
running sound equipment in a
house, and that person is respon-
sible for violations during or
after party hours.

Liquor consumption will be
monitored by the police as well

as by the state’s Alcoholic
Beverage Control board.

Although Chief Sutton said
he’s ‘‘not one to smell drinking
cups,”’ public possession of open
bottle or cans is actionable. If a
minor is found in posession of
alcoholic beverages, the frater-
nity can be held responsible.

The A.B.C. now has an agent
permanently assigned to Rock-
bridge to Rockbridge County,
Sutton said, since the agenit*y.has
recovered from an earlier man-
power shortage.

Sutton, a U.S. Army veteran
with 30 years of police ex-
perience in Virginia, reminded
the fraternities that they ‘‘are a
part of this community and
should abide by its rules.”’

() Continued from Page 4

Chief L.O. Sutton said that
“there was information contain-
ed in the report that was of
assistance to us.”’

He said that ‘‘a number’’ of the
indictments he sought and
received stemmed from the
special grand jury probe.

“There are other drug in-
vestigations pending and some
of them may very well have
resulted from the special grand
jury investigation,” he added.

Rockbridge County Sheriff
S.M. Reynolds said the in-
vestigation provided informa-
tion that law enforcement of-
ficials ‘“‘just had to check out.”

“We've acted on everything
we’ve checked out,” he said.
“There are more still to go.”

Honts said he “went through

the exercise’’ of impanelling the
special grand jury because he

respected the request of Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. “John” Read. Sutton and
Read had joined in Read’s re-
quest.

“If it were prescribed to me
again, I would grant it again, in
that context,” Honts said.

“Any time that you have im-
formation and couple that with
awareness and education, you
have a better community.”

Pi Kappa Alpha
President: Michael
Lehman

Rush Chairmen: Jamie
Nance and Bill Metzger
Description:

The house is a three-story
red brick structure located
at 106 N. Main St. Some of
the characteristics of our
typical member include
responsibility and well
roundedness.

Differences:

From a very geographical-
ly diverse bunch of guys,
we have a good mix of
leaders, scholars and
athletes.

Independents?

No, not unless they’re in-
vited.

 

Zeta Beta Tau

President: Jay Boggs
Rush Chairman: John
Riley

Description:

Diversity best describes
the brotherhood of ZBT.
Our members come from
all across the country and
pursue a wide variety of
academic and extracur-
ricular activities, including
journalism, the arts and
business. We emphasize
the idea of the ‘‘social’’
fraternity through a varied
social calendar, enhanced
by our new Little Sisters
program.

Differences:

With 28 members, ZBT is
one of the smaller houses
on campus. We find this
smallness to be not a
burden but an asset, ensur-
ing each member’s in-
dividuality, yet giving us
an uncommonly strong de-
gree of brotherhood. We
also have better food than
any other fraternity could
ever think of having.
Independents?

Of course.

 

Sigma Phi Epsilon
President: Thomas W.
Todd

Rush Chairman: Matt
Coudert

Description:

Sig Ep believes that an im-
portant part of one’s col-
lege experience is the
knowledge gained from
meeting different people
with different views and
lifestyles. The house
stresses the pursuit of
academic excellence while

offering its members an ac-
tive social life. The word
“brother” can describe
any member of the frater-
nity. Although many of the
members are from dif-
ferent parts of the country,
there is a close link be-
tween the members. To
characterize a_ typical
Sigma Phi Epsilon brother
would be almost impossible
because of the diversity of
each member.
Differences:

Many fraternities seem to
be composed in a geogra-
phical sense — members of
a certain fraternity seem to
be from one region of the
country. The members at
Sigma Phi Epsilon repre-
sent all sections of the
country from the West,
Midwest, Northeast and
South. Another major asset
is our location. Our position
is away from _ the
mainstream of college ac-
tivities, thus giving its
members a chance to
relax.

Independents?

Absolutely.

 

Phi Kappa Sigma
President: Jim Cobb

Rush Chairmen: Caulley
Deringer and Roger Dun-
novan

Description:

We have no ‘“‘typical’’
members. We have athletic
captains to Phi Beta Kappa
members. We don’t look. for
any one kind of person. It
would therefore be difficult
to describe our house to an
outsider and give him any
kind of accurate idea. The
guys in the house are all
very unique in my opinion.
Differences:

Again to try and describe
what is different about our
house would take away
from what we have. The
difference is in our
members. I am proud of
what we do at Phi Kap. The
way we keep our house, the
way we conduct ourselves
— but our most outstanding
aspect is our members.

Independents?

The IFC has just adopted a
resolution which limits par-
ties to fraternity members
and their invited guests. It
is therefore our policy to do
just that. Limit the parties
to our members and invited
guests only.

Pi Kappa Phi

President: Edward But-
tarazzi

Rush Chairman: Scott
Waterman

 

Description:

The brotherhood of Pi Phi
represents a very diverse
range of social back-
grounds. We have always
thought that it was the
diversity upon which we
draw our strength. There-
fore, there is no one
description for a typical
brother. Prospective mem-
bers are chosen upon their
merit, not upon their
demographic and
economic backgrounds.

Differences:

The characteristics men-
tioned above can partially
answer this question.
Another difference is that
our brothers concentrate
on unity within the house,
not on conformity to the na-
tional fraternity.

Independents?

We have always prided
ourselves on the attraction
of ‘“‘non-fraternity” stu-
dents to our parties. Unlike
many fraternities we have
no parties that are con-
sidered ‘‘closed.”’

 

Lambda Chi Alpha
President: Fred Bentley
Rush Chairmen: Chris
Lion and Tom Hurlbut
Description:

At Lambda Chi Alpha, we
believe that a fraternity
ought to be a place to foster
close friendships in the
spirit of brotherhood.
Essential to the strength of
this brotherhood is diversi-
ty and individuality. Thus,
our members come from
throughout the country and
from various backgrounds.

Differences:

Lambda Chi is different
from the other fraternities
in several ways. Most im-
portantly, we have aban-
doned the outdated system
of pledgeship and hazing.
In short, our associate
members are accorded all
the rights and respon-
sibilities of a full, active
member. Furthermore,
Lambda Chi is involved in
the community and on
campus with several social
and philanthropic projects.
For example, we recently
raised $500 for Stonewall
Jackson Hospital and
tutored at Lexington High
School.

Independents?

Although official Rush ends
in two weeks, Lambda Chi
Alpha will continue to seek
new brothers. Therefore,
independents are always
welcome to come by and
further acquaint them-
selves with our fraternity.

Fraternities:

 

-

Beta Theta Pi

President: George Seavy
Rush Chairman: Kreg Kurtz
Description:

Betas are a sociable, easy
going group of guys.
However, there is no
typical member. Members
come from all parts of the
country and represent a
cross section of the W&L
student community. Just
about anyone can feel
welcome at the Beta house.
Differences:

The Beta house is compos-
ed of a diverse group of
students who enjoy all
aspects of college life, in-
cluding student govern-
ment, academics, athletics
and social life. Betas have
traditionally been campus
leaders in these interests
and proudly continue to do
So.

Independents?

After Rush, our policy is to
welcome invited guests to
our parties.

AN

Delta Tau Delta
President: Rich Gatti

Rush Chairman: Paul Fearey

Description:

Although most of our
members come from the
Northern part of the United

‘States (Maryland, Mass.,

N.Y.), we do have mem-
bers from Louisianna and
Virginia. Most members
are or have been active in
sports in and out of W&L.
Our typical member is
casual and laid back —
rarely seen in coat or tie.
We like to party but are
also active in other ac-
tivities — intramurals,
raising money for Multiple
Sclerosis in the spring and
an alumni newsletter.
Differences:

Our house is not hung up on
where a person is from, but
what he is like as a person.
Weare very social minded.
We are a smaller house
than others, but feel this
does have its advantages —
we are a Close house which
does a lot together. Delt
does stuff with other houses
— we are not isolated from
them.

 

 

The Ring-tum Phi last week sent que:
nities on campus. The questions w
understanding of what the various hoi
answers to the following questions are r

1. How would you describe your ho
characteristics of your typical member

2. In what way is your house different

3. After Rush, are independents gene

 

Independents?

If they are friends of the
members, independents
are generally welcome to
parties. It is impossible to
support the partying of all
independents on our finan-
ces alone.

 

Kappa Sigma

President: John Haywood
Rush Chairman: Mike
Hutcherson

Description:

Kappa Sigma is a tradi-
tional fraternity whose
members believe that a
fraternity is more than just
a social organization. The
diversity and commitment
of our membership have
always been our major
strengths.

Differences:

We believe that our pro-
gram is the strongest and
most well rounded on cam-

pus. Our goals are sincerity -

and straightforwardness in
Rush, a good social life
with civility and the
development of a strong
fraternal _ relationship
among our members.
Independents?

Yes.

Rush Chairmen: Bill

Description:

We are a very diverse

ts and we because we really are all
in student good friends and do things
€ govern- together even outside the
sphere of the house. We
also interact with other
ipt to mold houses well because of our
‘9a certain involvement with school
, we en- activities and the friends
'idualism, we meet there. We have a
‘y diverse less rigidly structured

Rush than most houses and
are therefore less _pres-
surized. We start out with a
small pledge class and
usually end up with one of
the largest. Last year we
had 20.

Independents?

Yes, we have always used
an open door policy with
the W&L community.

Sigma Chi

President: Bobby Pifer
Rush Chairmen: Jim
Rikhoff and Greg Stites
Description:

Sigma Chi works with a
philosophy of balance with
diversity. Many members
are involved in varsity foot-
ball, soccer, track, tennis
and water polo. Our mem-
bers are representative of
various areas of the coun-
try. Academics, while
strong, are not hindered by
our active social program.
Differences:

Along with our diversity,
Sigma Chi maintains a con-
tinual sense of unity that
prevails throughout the
house. The members are
highly motivated and ex-
cell in all areas of campus
life, whether academics,
athletics or social.
Independents?

We have always had a
policy of accepting anyone
who meets the mandatory
drinking age and acts
responsibly. Many of our
friends did not join a house,
but are always welcome at
our house.

 

Sigma Nu
President: Kelley Ar-
mitage
Rush Chairman: Mark
Fishman

Description: .
There is so much diversity
in our house that it is dif-
ficult to find a_ typical
member. Almost everyone
in the house is from a dif-
ferent state. We have about
50 percent ‘‘Northerners”’
and 50 percent ‘‘Southern-
ers.’’ Some of the brothers
are into sports and some
are not. The common link
between us is our strong
brotherhood — this is true
regardless of where we are
from. Our house does strive
for academics first.
However we believe that in
order to have a strong
academic life we must
have a strong social life,
and we do.

Differences:

Our house is“ different
because we just started it
up again last year. Most of
the juniors ‘in our house

were freshmen who went
through Rush in 1982-83.
However we ended up
pledging Sigma Nu even
though we did it after Rush
was over and even though
we had no house. As stated
before, our house is more
diverse than any house on
campus. We do not look for
people who are from cer-
tain areas of the country
—instead we look for quali-
ty men.

Independents?

Yes.

 

Phi Delta Theta
President:
Thompson
Rush Chairman: Stewart
Speed

Description:

Describing my house to an
outsider (as you put it), I
would basically refer to the
Phi Delts as a solid bunch
of guys, meaning we work
hard (as can be witnessed
by the number of school of-
fices Phi Delts hold) and
we play hard like most
fraternities do. But I think
what separates us from
other fraternities...is the
amount of leadership with-
in our house, including Ex-
ecutive Committee Presi-
dent and Vice President
and the president ‘of the
Senior Class. Also, I think
our house has proven itself
to be one of the more stable
fraternities on campus
throughout the years.
Differences:

Again, I think it’s the
leadership in the house. In-
deed, as I’m sure you are
aware, many of the frater-
nities are ‘‘regional,’’

Reynolds

although this is somewhat _

unfortunate because it.
quite often eliminates peo-
ple based on where they
are from, this is the case,
and yes, I guess Phi Delts
consist mostly of men from
the Southeast.
Independents?

Our parties are generally
open to members and in-
vited guests.

 

Chi Psi

President: Henry Dewing
Rush Chairman:
Kinkead and Chris Jakubek
Description:

Chi Psi is a very diverse
house. Our brothers live in
15 different states, play on
five different University
athletic teams and are in-
volved in many other areas
on campus and in the com-

George

munity. We have brothers
on ROTC and academic
scholarships as well as
brothers on academic pro-
bation. There is no “typi-
cal’ Chi Psi brother.
Differences:

I think we’re perceived on
campus as an ‘‘academic
house.” Although we do
well academically, we
aren’t an ‘‘academic
house.’’ Each brother
strives to do his best in
whatever he does. This is,
however, a personal com-
mitment. That’s what we
look for in Rush — men who
will strive for excellence in
all things.

Independents?

After Rush independents
are generally welcome.

 

“For any of those people
interested in coming by
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, we
encourage you to stop in
and see the house,’’ said
SAE President Gray
Sanders. The house is at 205
E. Washington Street.
David Perdue and Thorn-
ton Brooksbank are the co-
Rush Chairmen.

FIJI

While most houses have |
only Rush on their minds
this year, Phi Gamma
Delta is faced with the task
of rebuilding its house, gut-
ted by fire last spring.

“We've already got some
plans drawn up and they
look really good,” said Fiji
President Alex Castelli.
“The outside will be pretty
much the same, but the in-
side will be much more
space efficient.’”’

Castelli said the walls
that remained standing
after the fire are being
tested this week to deter-
mine whether or not they
can be ifcorperated into
the new structure.

“We recovered some-
thing in the neighborhood
of $400,000 from the in-
surance company, and
we’re hoping to be all mov-
ed in by the fall of ’85,”
Castelli said.

Castelli said Fiji is op-
timistic about this Rush.
Working out of a house on
Henry Street hurts a little, :
he said, because it is not
near many other houses.

Even so, he _ added,
“We're all really sticking
together through all of this
and we’re putting out a
very concentrated effort to
make this a good Rush.”’

Summer News Update

 

Col Alto conveyed

Ownership of the historic Col Alto property on
East Nelson Street has been transferred from
Washington and Lee to Laura Fletcher of Bel Air,
Md., in an out-of-court settlement signed in July.

The settlement ended a three-year legal battle
over the property, given to W&L by Laura Tucker
Mason, Mrs. Fletcher’s sister, in 1957.

Mrs. Fletcher had filed a $1 million lawsuit
against W&L in U.S. District Court in Roanoke. In
the suit, Mrs. Fletcher alleged that W&L had not
lived up to the terms agreed upon when Mrs.
Mason gave the property to the school.

The 1957 agreement between Mrs. Mason and
W&L said that if for any reason W&L ‘‘no longer
desires or is able to retain the premises under the
conditions set forth herein, it will convey the
premises to those persons then living who shall be
determined to be the next of kin of the owner.”’

The building had been used primarily for
storage as well as for housing students and occa-
sional informal social functions. Several pro-
fessors also lived in the outbuildings, or
‘dependencies,’ of Col Alto.

The Col Alto property, near the Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity house, includes a 17-room house
and several surrounding buildings on eight acres
of land.

Col Alto was built in 1827 for James McDowell,
who was governor of Virginia from 1843 to 1846 and
a member of the House of Representatives from
1846 to 1851, For many years, it was the home of
Harry St. George Tucker, who was dean of the
W&L Law School from 1899 to 1901.

Wise wins awards

Dr. John H. Wise, professor of chemistry,
recently won first-place awards in two categories
of computer graphics at the Biennial Chemical
Education Meeting at the University of Connec-
ticut.

Dr. Wise’s graphic programs, which illustrate
chemical principles, won in the minicomputer and
above and microcomputer categories. One of his
graphics will be used as an illustration on the
cover of the publication, ‘‘Computers in Chemical
Education,” later this year.

Earlier this summer, Dr. Wise was one of 290
participants throughout the world at the Ninth In-
ternational Conference of Atomic Physics at the
University of Washington in Seattle.

Former dean dies

Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh, a former Washington
and Lee dean and history professor, died July 26 in
Lexington following a lengthy illness. He was 80.

Dr. Sensabaugh came to Washington and Lee in
1956 as dean of the University. He held that posi-
tion until 1960, when he became a full-time history
professor. He taught history until retiring in 1974,
when he was designated a dean emeritus by the
W&L Board of Trustees.

A native of Dublin, Texas, Dr. Sensabaugh
received a bachelor’s degree in history from
Vanderbilt University in 1925. He received his
Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1928.

Before coming to W&L, Dr. Sensabaugh had

taught at Oklahoma City University for 13 years
and at Birmingham-Southern College for 20 years.
At Birmingham-Southern, he was chairman of the
department of history and political science and
chairman of the division of social sciences.

Dr. Sensabaugh’s field of special interest was
Latin American history, especially Brazilian
history. He spent a year in Brazil studying United
States-Brazilian relations on a_ Rosenfeld
Fellowship.

After retiring from W&L, Dr. Sensabaugh serv-
ed on Lexington City Council and as president of
the Rockbridge County Cancer Society.

Dr. Ennis dies

Dr. Thomas E. Ennis Jr., a professor of account-
ing at Washington and Lee, died in an apparent
suicide July 29.

Dr. Ennis, who was 54, died from carbon monox-
ide poisoning from a car, according to the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff’s Department.

A native of Salisbury, N.C., Dr. Ennis had been
a member of the W&L faculty since 1955.

He received his bachelor of science degree in
1952 and his master’s degree in business ad-
ministration in 1955, both from the University of
North Carolina. He earned his Ph.D. from the
University of Michigan in 1964.

He also served in the Army from 1952 to 1954.

Dr. Ennis, who studied the effects of inflation on
accounting, was a member of the National
Association of Accountants, the American Ac-
counting Association, Phi Beta Kappa and Beta
Gamma Sigma, the business administration honor

fraternity.

W&L receives

bequest from
Parmly estate

Washington and Lee has received a $1.3 million
bequest from the estate of the late Ruth Parmly of
New York City.

Miss Parmly, who died May 8 at the age of 80,
was one of the University’s most generous
benefactors. She had previously given W&L gifts
totaling $2 million to maintain its program in the
sciences, with special emphasis on physics,
physics-engineering and mathematics.

Although she did not have any direct tie with
W&L, Miss Parmly had been aware of a gift made
to the University in the early 1900s by Robert
Parker Doremus, a New York stockbroker.
Visiting the W&L campus for the first and only
time shortly before his death in 1913, Doremus was
so impressed that he bequeathed his entire estate
to the University.

Miss Parmly said that, the story of the Doremus
gift had provided her with ‘‘an indirect connec-
tion’? with W&L. The building that houses the
biology, physics and physics-engineering depart-
ments is named after her father, Charles Howard
Parmly, a professor at City College of New York.

The W&L Board of Trustees will consider a per-
manent use for Miss Parmly’s bequest at its Oc-
tober meeting.

Orientation said ‘hectic’ tor freshman class

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Having freed itself from the
burdens of home, the Class of
1988 now faces the challenge of
its first days at college.

For some freshmen this week,
the challenge began with getting
used to living in a small town
such as Lexington. ‘‘It’s unusual
to live in such a small place, but
it’s a really pretty town,” said
Ty McMains of Baton Rouge, La.

Although McMains had been to
Lexington twice before he mov-
ed in Sunday, some of the fresh-
men were seeing the town for the
first time. Rusty Weiss of Cincin-
nati said he enjoyed being in
Lexington. ‘‘I love it. I was also
surprised that such a small town
_ would pretty much have
everything that you need,” he
said.

The Lexington area didn’t pro-
vide Rob Ryan with everything
he needed. When Ryan arrived
from Southern California at the
Roanoke airport at 7 p.m. last
Friday, he discovered that the
next bus to Lexington wasn’t.
leaving until 3 a.m. “‘I felt like a
total fool,’’ he said. ‘‘I ended up
paying a taxi driver $60 to bring
me to Lexington.”’

After settling in Sunday, the

freshmen were greeted on Mon-

day with placement tests and
orientation meetings. ‘‘It’s been
really hectic,’’ said McMains,
‘but everyone’s been really
friendly and it’s been easy to
meet people.”’

Although Ryan said some of
the meetings lasted a little long,
he said he felt the University
was doing the best possible job of
clearing up all the freshmen’s
questions.

“There still is some confusion,
but it is more of a general confu-
sion of being away from home
and getting used to new sur-
roundings,”’ he said.

Senior dorm counselor Joe
Morelos said everything is run-
ning smoothly. ‘‘Most of the
questions they have are about
curriculum and Rush,”’ he said,
‘‘and there has been more talk
about the chances of the drink-
ing age being raised than about
coeducation.”’

Ryan also said not many fresh-
men were talking about their
class being W&L’s last all-male
class. ‘‘Maybe this spring it will
hit us,” he added.

Ryan said he felt it was too bad
the all-male tradition at W&L
will end because ‘‘there just
aren’t many traditions left to-
day.”

Hunter Applewhite of Rich-
mond said that W&L’s all-male
tradition was attractive but add-

WGL welcomes 1, 715

Orientation for approximately
380 entering Washington and Lee
freshmen began Monday and
classes for all students start next
Monday, Sept. 10.

University officials anticipate
a total enrollment of about 1,350
students in W&L’s undergradu-
ate divisions for the 1984-85
academic year. That does not in-
clude the W&L School of Law,
which has an enrollment of 365.
Classes for law students began
August 22.

   

The entering freshmen were
selected from a pool of 1,502 ap-
plicants for admission. The new
students are from 38 states and
six foreign countries and repre-
sent 281 secondary schools.

Geographically, the largest
contingent of freshmen (82)
comes from the Commonwealth
of Virginia. Maryland is second
with 36 freshmen followed by
Georgia (26), New Jersey (23),
Pennsylvania (20) and New
York (19).

coeducation sounds. Besides, I
figure that the Board of Trustees
knows what’s better for the
university than I do.”’

Morelas said it is too early to
tell how this freshman class is
shaping up.

“T have seen more computers
and some really big T.V. sets.”
He added that he saw one fresh-
man bringing in a pair of six-foot
tall speakers. ‘‘Fortunately,’’ he
said, “he wasn’t on my hall.”’

McDonald’s arrives in Lexington

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

It may be a good time for the
great taste of McDonald’s, but
Lexington’s other fast food
restaurants are still reporting
increased sales since the Golden
Arches’ opening here Aug. 17.

The local fast food connoisseur
can expect some changes in
menu and service from these
eateries, though, including beer
on tap at Arby’s and home
delivery from Pizza Hut.

McDonald’s manager Kathy
McCarty said, ‘‘It (business) has
been great, super.’’ About half of
its business is coming from
Washington and Lee and Vir-
ginia Military Institute students,
while the other half is coming
from people passing Lexington
on Interstate 81, Ms. McCarty
said.

Both Wendy’s and Pizza Hut,
which are near McDonald’s on
East Nelson Street, have seen
sales increase since the middle
of August.

‘‘We don’t have a sign on the
highway,’ said Pizza Hut
manager Jerry Limerick. Both
Limerick and Wendy’s manager
Jeff Lilly said they feel that
motorists getting off the In-
terstate see the McDonald’s
sign, but find they have a choice
once they are on Nelson Street.
Due to state regulations that in-
clude being open for breakfast
by 7 a.m., neither Pizza Hut nor
Wendy’s qualifies to advertise
on the interstate.

Lloyd’s of Lexington and Ar-
by’s, although not reporting in-
creased sales, are not reporting
any decreases either. These two
restaurants, along with Wendy’s
and Pizza Hut, have already
made some changes or will be
making some in the near future.
Arby’s nationwide is_ incor-
porating a hamburger and a
baked potato, similar to Wen-
dy’s, into the menu. The local
Arby’s also has applied for a
beer license and should be serv-
ing beer soon, according to assis-
tant manager Carolyn Emma.

Lloyd’s, sporting new video
games and a “Watch Out
McDonald’s”’ sign, has cut ham-
burger prices from 80 cents to 59
cents. Pizza Hut will be offering
a delivery service starting Sept.
10. ‘‘It will eventually be incor-
porated on a national level. We

have to keep up with the com-
petition,” said Limerick, who
noted the rise of pizza delivery
services such as Domino’s. Piz-
za Hut’s hours are being extend-
ed to 2 a.m. in conjunction with
the delivery service.

Wendy’s, which is reporting
increased sales both locally and
nationwide because of it’s recent
“‘Where’s the Beef?’’ blitz, is
developing a breakfast menu.
‘“‘We had plans to start breakfast
way before McDonald’s came
in,”’ Lilly said.

So whatever the effect of the
new McDonald’s is, and
wherever the beef is, Lexington
has developed into more than a
one-burger town. Students in-
terested in part-time work at
any of these restaurants should
see the managers for applica-
tions.

Law School Class of '87

enrolls 41 percent women

A record number of women
and an unusually high number of
Virginia residents are included
among the 122 first-year
students in Washington and
Lee’s School of Law.

This year’s entering students
come from 22 states and 71
undergraduate institutions.

Women comprise 41 percent of
the first-year class, and that
represents the highest percen-
tage of women in a single law
class since the University’s law

school became coeducational i
1972. .

There are 42 Virginians in the
first-year law class. Although
Virginia normally has_ the
highest representation of
students in the Law School’s stu-
dent body, the number in the

entering class is unusually
large.
The highest representation

from a single undergraduate in-
stitution is the University of
Virginia with 17 graduates
represented in the W&L first-
year class.

Next comes Washington and
Lee with 10 followed by Virginia
Tech with five, the University of
Alabama and Duke with four
each, and Smith and Vanderbilt
with three each.

Included among the first-year
students are a commercial
fisherman who also is the co-
founder of an environmental
organization; a Ph.D. who
taught all grades in a one-room
schoolhouse before teaching col-
lege English; a horticulturalist,
a social worker who specialized
in the prevention of child abuse;
and an administrator for a South
Texas organization that
distributes food to the needy.

Surface, whom Fallon saw as an
important team leader in the
summer workouts, and senior
slotback and tri-captain Tom
Wiser, whom Fallon calls ‘‘a fine
performer and a double threat
that the defense cannot ignore.”’

With senior tri-captain Pat
O’Connell as the only returning
Starter from last year’s All-
Conference offensive line,
Fallon set out to rebuild his of-
fensive line and is now quite
pleased with the result.

“We played a lot of people last
year, so quite a few players have
experience and have shown they
can handle the jobs in the line.
The players that have surfaced
to starting positions this year
were good performers last year.

“We may have lost a little in
size from last year’s line, but I
think we may be a little bit
quicker up front this year than
we have been in the past,’’ he
said.

Balancing out the line with
O’Connell at one tackle, Fallon
sees senior Paul Marasciullo at
the other tackle, senior Craig
Waddell and junior John San-
ders at the guards and senior
Harry Golliday to fill the shoes
of departing All-American Glenn
Kirschner at center.

Junior Chris Bleggi has been
moved from tailback to split end
and is slated to share duties with
classmate Hugh Finkelstein,
who returns after sitting out 1983
with a shoulder injury. At tight
end, seniors Ian Banwell and
Dave Sizemore will handle the
details.

Despite losing six starters,
Fallon remains confident in his
defense. ‘‘Up front, we’re going
to be quite similar to what we
were last year,” he said, in-
dicating returners Jim Lyall
(nose guard), Mark Weaver
(tackle) and Craig Westbrook
(end) will be joined by a pair of
‘‘hard-working’’ juniors in
tackle Alex Castelli and end Tim
Richardson.

Fallon said the real question in

the defense was at the line-
backer position where both of
last year’s starters, John Cole
and Bill Foster, were lost to
graduation. Filling those slots,
however is a group led by senior
Kurt Specht and sophomore Bob
Berlin.

“I have confidence in these
two. They’re both rea! good per-
formers,”’ Fallon said.

The Generals return three of
four starters to the defensive
backfield with hard-hitting cor-
nerback Kelvin Newsome and
strong safety Tim Janyska
leading the way from 1983.

Joining Janyska and New-
some will be junior Chris Wilson,
who filled in at free safety last

year when Bob Jenevein went
down with an injury, and junior
Scott Henderson at cornerback.
Fallon said he is pleased with his
team’s depth. in this area and in-
dicated that as situations dictate
he would use a fifth defensive
back.

The Generals will return the
same pair from last year for
kicking duties. James White,
who holds the W&L record for
most points-after-touchdown in a
single season, will handle the
placement detail, while Gene
Girard will continue as punter.

Saturday’s contest will be the
third meeting between Dickin-
son arid W&L. The Generals lead
the series 2-0, but Fallon is call-

The Ring-tum Phi, September 6, 1984, Page 13.

ing this meeting a ‘‘mystery
game.”

“We're going into this game
almost blind as far as knowing
what to prepare for, as well as
what to prepare against,’’ he
said.

The Red Devils finished 1983 ai
2-7 and are under the tutelage of
interim head coach Wilbur
Gobrecht. Team leaders for the
Pennsylvania school include
two-year starter at quarterback
Stan Abromavage, three-year
starting tailback John Parker
and fullback John Grant.

“Our offense is geared more to
the run,’’ Gobrecht said. ‘‘Ideal-
ly, a good play mix would be two-
thirds' running and one-third
passing, but we'll vary that
some, depending on our situa-

tion, probably up to 50-50.”

“Our weakness could be lack
of overall depth, along with the
fact that we are a young team,”
he said, but proclaimed that
“our program is on the upsw-
ing.”

“It would be awfully nice if I
could say, ‘We’ve got them in
our pocket,’ but, doggone, we
don’t,’’ he said.

Fallon said Dickinson’s 2-7
record is a bit deceptive. ‘‘They
play in a tough league (the

Centennial Conference). I ex-
pect a very tough football
| game.”

Game time on Saturday is 1:30
p.m. at Wilson Field. W&L has
invited the students of Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College as
honored guests for the day.

Remillard plays key role in Olympic effort

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

When the accolades were be-
ing passed out to those victorious
at the Olympic Games in Los
Angeles this summer, Page
Remillard was not exactly
swamped with praise.

Yet, Remillard, who is enter-
ing his sixth season as swim-
ming and water polo coach at
Washington and Lee, played a
vital role in the silver-medal suc-
cess of the U.S. water polo team.

Remillard was the chairman
of the video committee for the
U.S. team. He was in charge of
scouting the American opposi-
tion in Los Angeles. As every
coach knows, a_ thorough
scouting report is crucial to a
team’s success.

Remillard, working with his
assistants on the committee
Gary Troyer and Jim Sprague,
compiled approximately 60
hours of film of various foreign
teams in action during the past
year and a half. The three men
worked for over 300 hours view-
ing and editing the films and
determining the tendencies,

strengths and weaknesses of the
foreign teams. The editing work
was done with equipment from
W&L.

The films were presented to
U.S. head coach Monty Nitzkow-.
ski on March 5. Remillard said
Nitzkowski was well pleased
with the work done by the com-
mittee.

Remillard was in Los Angeles
for the Games, where the U.S.
was undefeated in competition,
tying only eventual gold-medal
winner Yugoslavia. Perhaps, the
quality of the scouting work done
by Remillard and his staff was
shown by the fact that Yugoslav-
ia was the only team competing
in the Olympics that the video
committee was unable to film in
action prior to the Games.

“You can always look back
and say ‘if, if, if...,”’ Remillard
said. Remillard believes that his
Olympic experience will benefit
the water polo program at W&L.
The W&L players will gain
valuable knowledge from the
films made by the video commit-
tee. Remillard added that the ex-
perience and ‘‘inside stories” he
acquired by working with the

  

ALOHA WOK

409 South Main St., Lexington, Virginia 24450

 

U.S. team have “helped to
motivate the W&L water polo
players.”

Remillard views his Olympic
experience as a good one, but
said that he is “kind of burned
out’? due to his strenuous
schedule during the last four
years. He also stated that ‘‘if it
wasn’t for the W&L administra-
tion encouraging this type of per-
sonal exposure, I never would’ve
been involved with the Olympic

team.”’

Remillard plans to reduce the
number of commitments he
makes outside his position at
W&L in the future in order to
“get to know his community.”
He was away from Lexington
nearly 100 days this summer and
traveled approximately 10,000
miles. Remillard said that he
now realizes that ‘‘there is more
to life than water polo and
W&L.”

An objective view of Los Angeles

...Thank you, and it’s a
pleasure to be back in this cor-
ner offering my distorted and
disputed view of the world of
sports.

....Looking back over the sum-
mer, I have to make my first
stop at Los Angeles. Frankly,
I'm rather bored with the talk of
the Dan Rather and David
Brinkley types who have sudden-
ly rediscovered American
patriotism. These were the same
people who reminded us con-
stantly how athletics and sports
should not be mixed when those-
not-seeing-the light decided to
boycott the festivities in
southern California. Let’s look at
these games (remember, chil-
dren play games) in somewhat
of a more objective frame. Sport
is sport and should be enjoyed
for the simplicity of the concept
of competition. The L.A. Games
provided its viewers with many
of those positive moments.
Perhaps, they were positive
because many of those moments

appreciate the performance of
an athlete regardless of where
he comes from. I think it matters
not that four-medal swimmer
Michael Gross is West German,
the winner of the marathon is:
Portugese or that the winners of
water polo had a different ar-
rangement of red, white and

remember and enjoy the effort
it takes to be a_ winner.
The appreciation of athletic
competition goes beyond win-
ning, though. For me, _ the

was probably a moment of un-
fulfilled dreams but also and
most importantly it was a mo-
ment of raw emotion, feelings
that are at the core of sports.
Keeping all of this in mind, it
seems rather boring to mention
that the Communist-bloc nations
were not in the right place at the
right time. Were they missed?
Only in that we had no one to
cheer against, an unhealthy at-
titude indeed and one that has no
place in something as pure as
the Olympic Games. One need
only to look to the Games’ open-
ing ceremonies to realize that
boycotts and the like are a
mistake. Athletes, when they so
chose, have a special way of ris-
ing above the nonsense of this
trivial world in which we live.
Yes, it is a positive feeling we
can take from those last two
weeks in July. Funny, and our
Games did not need a silly and
superficial title to lend them
credence...

....F or our inaugural trip down
the Colonnade, we’ll look at the
General gridders. Frankly,
there’s a tall order to fill with the
departure of four of five offen-
sive frontliners. If that area is
reasonably replaced, a feat that
seems quite possible, W&L is
Staring. at winning season.
number five...A quick guess for
Saturday’s tilt at Wilson Field
against Dickinson: W&L in im-
pressive fashion over a team
that doesn’t have the horses to
play with the Generals...

i And while we’re on the Col-
onnade, here are a pair of an-
nouncements for you the W&L

fan. The new McDonald’s is
sponsoring a W&L-VMI contest
of sorts. The restaurant has
taken out ads in both the W&L
and VMI football programs for
the upcoming season. The school
that returns the most ads to
McDonalds by season’s end will
receive a $500 gift. If W&L men
return the most ads, the $500 will
go toward the University’s Big
Brother program. I don’t know
about you, but I’d consider it a
terrible misfortune if a VMI
gentleman had any reason to
think he was better than a W&L
gentleman. Let’s do our part to
remove any doubt in anyone’s
mind and at the same time give
the Big Brother program a
deserved helping hand...Another
item for the football fan is the in-
augural Woman’s College Day to
begin with Saturday’s game. Ac-
cording to W&L Sports Informa-
tion Director Mark Mandel,
every General home football
game will be devoted to one of
the surrounding schools for. the
fairer sex. This weekend, young
women from Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College will be bused
to Wilson Field for an afternoon
of football Generals’ style and an
evening of entertainment at
their choice. Indeed, an idea
whose benefits are limitless.
Needless to say, gentlemen, I
would recommend you get your
seats early on Saturday....

Finally, a thought on
basebrawls. There have been
two of note: The Padres-Braves
game a few weeks back and last
Sunday’s 15-minute bout be-
tween the Angels and _ the
Yankees. Getting away from
whether it is a horrendous act or
not — it is — I think what is most
disturbing is its reflection on the
professional athlete. These sorts
of brawls have no place in the
game, and what’s more, I do not
think they reflect any sort of
team-looking-after-its-own idea.
Rather, it is the childish reaction
of an over-priced child playing a
game who doesn’t have things go
his way. Somewhere the line has
to be drawn on what is accept-
able behavior for a_ baseball
player (pitchers notably includ-
ed) and what is not. Forget fines
and suspensions. Arrest the
perpetrators on assault and
disorderly conduct charges. The
professional athlete has become
a prima donna simply because
he has been allowed to evolve as
such. I remember when I had

athletes as role models...but just

barely...

...Would be nice if Martina
Navratilova were to lose. Won’t
happen this weekend, though...1
wonder if Tom Landry can pro-
nounce ‘“‘Hogeboom’’ yet. No
doubt Danny White keeps
repeating it in his sleep....

completed his senior year with a
12) dual meet record. He is
among the school’s winningest
wrestlers of all time.

Valliere also was a standout in
the classroom, where he was
consistently a member of W&L’s
Dean’s List and Honor Roll. Last
year, he was a semifinalist for a
Rhodes Scholarship.

No. 1 in state

Washington and Lee was the
most successful Division III
school in the state during the
1983-84 school year, according to
a survey by the Virginia College
Sports Information Directors
(VASID).

The survey, the first for Divi-
sion III schools, showed that
W&L had a winning percentage
of 64.5 (124-68-1).

Only sports recognized as
championship sports by the
NCAA were included in the
survey.

Summer vacation ends early for WGL athletes

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Studying plays, watching
films, running circuits, swim-
ming sprints and running up
mountains, some Washington
and Lee students arrive at
school one-and-a-half to three
weeks before classes begin to
train and practice for fall varsi-
ty sports.

While many Wé&L students
recuperate from their summer
jobs and prepare for the begin-
ning of the academic year dur-
ing the final weeks of summer
break, cross country, football,
soccer and water polo team
members reported to Lexington
to attend pre-season practice
sessions in temperatures
greater than 90 degrees.

Football players returned first
on Aug. 18. Water polo players
arrived next with their practice
beginning Aug. 24. Soccer
players returned at two different
times: upperclassmen on Aug.
30 and freshmen the following
day. Some members of the cross
country team returned to Lex-
ington to train before the team’s
first organized practice on Sept.
1.

The football and water polo
teams have practice routines
that require more than eight
hours of an athlete’s time each
day. Pre-season water polo prac-
tice ends with a four-mile run up
a mountain. Soccer and cross
country also carry a busy sche-
dule with practices twice a day.

In team sports such as foot-
ball, soccer and water polo,
coaches usually require an
athlete’s participation in the pre-
season program if that athlete
wants to compete in the fall, ac-
cording to W&L coaches. These
sports require teamwork, best
obtained by practicing together.
Coaches and players utilize the
two- to three-week period before
classes begin trying to guaran-
tee the success of their pro-
grams.

In cross country, however, in-
dividuals can train on their own
and therefore do not need to
return as early as other athletes.
According to cross country
coach Dick Miller, W&L runners
have summer physical training
programs that require running a
maximum of 50 miles a week.
After returning to school, cross
country runners begin increas-
ing their pace and improving
their times so that their perfor-
mances peak at the end of the
season, when it counts the most.

Football coach Gary Fallon
said he believes upperclassmen
approach his three-week prac-
tice session with a positive at-
titude, but notes that some
freshmen have difficulties dur-
ing the course of the practices.
Freshmen usually have not en-
countered a physical training
program that requires so much
of their strength and energy, he
said.

Freshman Simon Perez of
Harrisonburg admits that water
polo practice drains him
physically. But Perez, who plays
water polo to enhance his
primary athletic ambition with
the swim team, said he has ‘‘no
problems’’ adjusting to W&L
despite the rigorous practice
schedule. Water polo practices
are from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. and
freshman orientation has been
keeping Perez busy this week,
but he said he believes his par-
ticipation in the water polo pro-
gram produces several benefits.
Not only does Perez enjoy learn-
ing to play water polo, but his
association with other players on
the team provided him with
many friends long before most
freshmen arrived in Lexington.
He said having such a group of
friends is important, especially
now. “It is invaluable having
friends at school before you
start. They help you adjust much
better.”’

The only drawback Perez said
he could associate with his par-
ticipation as a freshman in the

water polo program relates to
fraternity Rush. Water polo
practice times prevented Perez
from attending four open house
dates; however, he said this
drawback is a minor one.

Washington and Lee does not
provide athletic scholarships.
The university does not even
grant financial aid based on
athletic ability to athletes who
participate in programs at the
NCAA Division I level. W&L
athletes have no obligation to the
University to compete, much
less return to school early to face
extensive physical training and
day-long practices in summer
heat.

Why do W&L athletes (not only
those who return early to school
but also those who participate in
programs during the year) sac-
rifice so much of their time and
limit their social life to par-
ticipate in NCAA Division III
athletic programs?

“If I didn’t love it, then I
wouldn’t do it,”’ said junior foot-
ball place kicker James White.

 

 

“I play because I love the game,

and if you want to do something

then you go all the way.”’ Cotton Puryear/The Ring- tum Phi
Not only does he enjoy playing The Generals continue their daily grind of practice this week in

football, White also said he
values the discipline Fallon in-
stills in his players. White said
he strongly believes that this
discipline helps him on and off
the football field.

He said he does not mind being
exhausted from practice or sub-
jected to a curfew during Rush
because he finds football and the
values associated with it worth-
while.

White concluded, “‘If you find
something worthwhile, then you
have to be willing to make
sacrifices for it.”’

Ron reaches out, touches Clark

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Journalism Professor Clark R. Mollenhoff
quickly had to swallow the last bite of a chicken
sandwich when his office telephone rang Friday
afternoon.

After taking a swig of water to wash down the
remains of the sandwich, Mollenhoff picked up the
phone on the third ring.

The voice on the other end of the line said, “The
President wants to talk to you and he’ll be right on
the line.”’

“T took another gulp of water,”’ said Mollenhoff.

“My first reaction,’ he added, ‘‘was ‘I wonder
what he’s calling about.’ It’s an election year and
presidents do strange things in election years.”’

When President Reagan came on the line, he
said, ‘‘Hello, Clark — or is it Professor? —
Mollenhoff,’’ said Mollenhoff.

“You take your choice, Mr.
Mollenhoff responded.

The conversation that ensued lasted about 20
minutes, Mollenhoff said, and covered topics
ranging from a baseball game Reagan umpired in
Iowa in the 1930s to current problems within the
Defense Department, about which Mollenhoff has
written for The Washington Times.

In fact, Mollenhoff was able to obtain a front-
page story for the Times based on comments

President,”’

Reagan made during the conversation.

Mollenhoff explained to Reagan the problems
that George R. Spanton, an auditor for the Defense
Contract Audit Agency, had after he discovered
increases in prices of spare parts manufactured
by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

“He was vaguely — he’d heard something of
this,’’ Mollenhoff said, ‘“‘but he was not aware of
the details and to me it was obvious he had been
misled with assurances from (Defense Secretary
Caspar) Weinberger.’’

Reagan asked Mollenhoff to repeat Spanton’s
name, then promised to ‘‘look into’’ the Spanton
case.

Mollenhoff’s story in Monday’s Washington
Times was headlined, ‘‘President will probe
whistle-blower’s case.”’

Mollenhoff said he has had one-on-one conversa-
tions with every President since Dwight
Eisenhower, although he talked with Jimmy
Carter only before he was elected President. This
was his first conversation with Reagan since the
1980 campaign.

Mollenhoff said he was satisfied with both the
conversation in general and with Reagan’s
responses to his questions about the Spanton case.
“Of course,”’ he added, ‘‘this is his strength. He
responds in a way that gives you the impression
and convinces you — it’s very convincing — that
he is genuinely concerned about these matters.”

Interest in W&L up
following coed vote

EE RT tes
By ANDY HOPPES
Assistant News Editor

 

About 450 women have re-
quested applications for admis-
sion next fall to Washington and
Lee, and summer interviews for
both men and women increased
by 67 percent over last year, ac-
cording to the admissions office.

“‘We were not really surprised
by the responses,” said Van
Pate, associate admissions di-
rector, citing the heavy publicity
given W&L’s coed decision.

In addition to the application
requests from females, 402
students were interviewed in
June, July and August, com-
pared to 241 students last year.

Although 67 of the students in-
terviewed were women, Pate
said the number of men inter-
viewed increased by 39 percent
over last year.

“The real surge in visitations
came after the coed announce-
ment. You pretty much have to
attribute the increase to the coed
decision,’’ he added.

“Tt kept us all on the move,”’
Pate said. ‘“We used to feel we
were having a busy day if we in-
terviewed seven or eight stu-
dents. There were days this sum-
mer when we interviewed 14.”

Although few of the students
he interviewed said coeducation
was the reason for their interest
in W&L, Pate said coeducation
was discussed in almost every
interview.

Women students shun ‘the WGL attitude’

ANALYSIS

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

Women at area colleges feel that
Washington and Lee men are often self-
centered and unapproachable to the point of
being rude, according to a recent informal
survey.

Furthermore, many students at the five
local women’s schools say they prefer the
punch-and-cookies politeness of Hampden-
Sydney College to the drunken fraternity
debauchery that results in what they refer to
as ‘‘the W&L attitude.’

The young ladies noted that especially dur-
ing initial visits, they found that a ‘‘stand-

ffis] elitist attitude frequently prevails at

parties. This cantrasts sharply with the

lavish, even fawning, attention they receive
at Hampden-Sydney functions.

Kathryn Pearce, a senior at Mary Baldwin
College, said she’s noticed a sharp difference
in the attitudes exhibited at the two schools,
both of which currently have all-male under-
graduate student bodies.

‘First impressions make a

big difference, and Hampden-

Sydney makes a better one.”

“The Hampcen-Sydney guys love meeting
new people much more than the guys at
W&L,” she said. ‘‘Hampden-Sydney guys ap-
preciate it so much more when we ¢ r

here

‘Although they are still concerned about
the freshmen going through Rush, the girls
get about equai time and attention,’’ she con-
tinued. “At W&L, girls take a back seat.”’

Kara Albert, a junior at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, perceived similar pro-
blems at W&L. ‘‘A lot of girls go to Hampden-
Sydney because they are a lot more friendly
down there,’’ she said,

“Until you know a few people at W&L, no
one talks to you,’’ she explained. ‘‘That’s the
big complaint about W&L guys with Randy

‘Mac girls — that they won’t come up and talk

to you.”

Ms. Albert said that girls are ‘‘an ornament
for freshmen’ at Hampden Sydney as much
as they are at W&L, but at Hampden Sydney

Pate said that he expects
women’s interest in W&L to con-
tinue during the fall.

‘‘We haven’t done a thing yet
to affect the interest of women.
When we start doing the college
nights and visiting schools, we'll
start to collect names of women.
That’s another good source of
applicants,’’ Pate said.

The travel schedule of admis-
sions office personnel will be
“beefed up” this year, according
to Pate, as representatives of the
university begin visiting girls’
high schools and coed high
schools from which women had
not been recruited previously.
Pate said that regardless of the
result of the coed decision, the
admissions office had been plan-
ning to increase the travel
schedule. Several extra days

Bob Jenevein, last year’s
student body president, helped
organize the event that Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan called
“the highlight”’ of last month’s
Republican National Conven-
tion.

Jenevein was a member of
the production staff for the
prayer breakfast the morning
after the close of the conven-
tion, which took place in Jene-
vein’s home city of Dallas.
President Reagan spoke at the
meeting, which received ex-
tensive media coverage, in-
cluding a front-page story in
The New York Times.

“The prayer breakfast
helped Ronald Reagan secure
the high moral ground in this
country, but at the same time
it brought him some intense
criticism,’’ Jenevein said.

He secured the position,
which meant three weeks of
17-hour days, while being in-
terviewed for a job in real
estate. He gave his interests
as ‘‘football and politics —
especially Republican
politics,’ and half an hour
later he was on the prayer
breakfast staff.

His duties included arrang-
ing for a 2,400-member choir

Does fall Rush
deserve a bid?

Tradition, some say, passes
slowly at Washington and Lee.
In some instances, the longevity
of tradition has served us well,
most notable being our all-male
tradition, sacred until it fell like
the Bastille last July. Other
traditions have not served us as
well, most notably that of fall
Rush.

Fall Rush simply doesn’t
work. It sounds odd, but the
back-to-school rush to get new
fraterntiy members has meant,
I daresay, the loss of many
‘‘brothers.’’ By starting the year
with party, party, party, study-
ing has traditionally taken a
back seat, and many freshmen
— far more, I am willing to bet,
than those at schools with defer-
red Rush — are caught with
more than their pants down
come mid-term reports. Over
the years, faculty, students and
the IFC have devised numerous
ways to change Rush so that
both parties (pardon the pun)
benefit in the long run. Frater-
nities need pledge dollars to beef
up Rush-weakened bank ac-
counts; faculty want to see
freshmen in their 8 o’clock (and
all thereafter) classes; students
want to have fun and then study.

This year’s two-week Rush
seemed just the solution to all
those competing interests. In
two short weeks (only one in-
volving classes), Rush would be
over and swept under the carpet
with the fall housecleaning.
Smiles all around the table.

But freshmen, and even some
frats, are losing. Freshmen were
given little time to see all 17
frats, even less time to see them
in a serious, non-partying state
(is that even possible?), and no
time to think over the role they
wished to play in the W&L social

scene. Some fraternities lose
because one party may not have
been the best or because, in the
quick judgments they must
make, freshmen noticed the
given frat had few members.
Freshmen, in this rushed Rush,
must make a very superficial
judgment for what may be the
most important decision they
ever make at Washington an
Lee. Caught up in what one
songwriter has termed ‘‘cosmet-
ic fixation,” they are prone to
mistakes, and expensive ones at
that. A $5,000 decision on the
basis of three hours of casual
chatter and guzzling is bad
business any way around it.

I believe the only solution to
the Rush dilemma is a deferred
Rush. Hold onto your red pens,
faculty. That doesn’t mean a
whole fall of Rush parties. It
means for freshmen a chance to
see a fraternity which must give
up partying before mid-terms
and finals. It means for fresh-
men a chance to see all the
fraternities at leisure and a
chance to explore those he likes.
For fraternities, a deferred
Rush would mean a _ better
chance to rush those freshmen
they most want and not just
those which appear to be okay in
the three times you see them.

Sure, a deferred Rush might
mean a few months of restricted
partying for fraternities unless
they get smart and change their
billing schedules. But when the
decision hinges on the fraterni-
ty’s very existence at W&L 10 or
15 years from now, the effort
seems worthwhile.

Like coeducation, the transi-
tion to a deferred Rush need only
be as painful as we make it.

Let the past be but the past

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott Tilley

“strive to have the nobleness
of character and mildness of
self...to let the past be but the

past.”

— General Robert E. Lee
4 On July 14,

jsides felt like
jthey had been
4sliced, and
emotions
iy a poured out like
a velenae. I was caught up in a
whirlwind of angerness and bit-
terness, all underlined by a
sense of betrayal.

Coeducation, at least to me,
seemed to be an irrevocable
change made for dubious
reasons. Something that I had
come to love and given three
years of my life to had been sud-
denly taken away from me. I felt
powerless to prevent it, which
was the most frustrating aspect.

Those feelings have now sub-
sided into a sense of sadness, a
void similar to that I felt when
my favorite dog died. Is this
year, my senior year, nothing
more than an anachronism, an
enigma destined to be _ re-
membered only in the nostalgia
of W&L as the end of a 235-year-
old era?

Thinking about my _ history
lessons, in retrospect I reckoned
myself similar to Neville
Chamberlain. Desperately I was
clinging to a world that I had
come to love, simply because I
had become secure and comfor-
table in it. Clinging, I was ignor-
ing the inevitable. No wonder,
then, I was shocked when Hitler
invaded my Czechoslavakia.

It is easy to become secure
and complacent in our ‘‘comfort
zones.’’ We all do it. But more
often than not, it is only when we

are bold enough to step, outside are

of our comfort zones that we
challenge ourselves and build
our character such that we
become better men.

So, like Chamberlain, maybe I
had been wrong. Had I been an
appeaser at the cost of W&L’s
academic quality? Had I been an
appeaser at the cost of admis-
sions standards? Could it be that
John Wilson was not W&L’s
Hitler?

Still, I felt betrayed.

After I returned home from
Lexington that fateful weekend,
I felt a great sense of loss and
uncertainty. I told a friend that I
was going to do some reading to
find some truth in the situation.

“The Bible?” he asked.

“No, my books on Robert E.
Lee.”

General Lee’s name had been
invoked during the controversy
to support both sides of the
issue..

“General Lee would have been
in favor.”

“No way. He would have been
opposed.”’

Both are perversions of the
great ideals for which the
General stood. I forced myself to
admit that he was not turning in
his grave. Rather, he is anxious-
ly anticipating the reactions of
those who dearly love the Uni-
versity.

Now that the decision has been
made, we can once again open
our history books and follow the
General’s example, as we do

classes, fraternity Rush and
football games at Washington
and Lee, and you know what that
means:

The only day of the semester
when there are lines in the text-
book section of the Bookstore.

Trashcans full of half-
completed drop/add and pass/
fail forms.

The only week all semester
when some students will visit
their advisers and professors.

A sign in the Bookstore advis-
ing students to go to their first
class before buying books.

Professors asking students in
that first class why they haven’t
already bought their books.

A full classroom for a ‘‘B”’
hour class five minutes before
the class begins.

 

. Swimming. . proficiency - tests -

that remind you more of sum-
mer camp than of university.

More people playing Frisbee
or shooting skeet with fraternity
brothers than watching a W&L
football game (even importing
girls from Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College didn’t help
much).

Monday Night Football on the
Cockpit’s wide-screen television
that’s practically impossible
to see, but three hot dogs for a
dollar making up for it.

Students struggling around
campus with a load of books
under both arms.

Students (and the registrar’s
office) keeping tally of ose who
have not returned to school for a
variety of reasons and those who
have returned after an absence.

Centel to leave Lexington for Charlottesville

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

“It’s not too late till they lock
that door. Then it’s too late.”

Emily Tillery, a _ service
representative who has worked
for the Lexington phone com-
pany for more than 28 years, is
hoping for — but not expecting
—a reprieve from Centel’s plan-
ned. closing of its Lexington
business office Nov. 2.

“We've called everybody we
could think of,”’ she said. ‘‘We’re
not sure what we can do, and we
don’t want to do anything wrong
and get fired for it. But it’s like
my husband said: Losing your

job is like somebody dying.”

The office closing is part of a
Centel ‘‘consolidation program”
announced this summer, under
which eight Virginia service of-
fices will close between now and
November. 2

Lexington customers will be
served from the Charlottesville
office, which is about 70 miles
away, in an attempt to ‘‘reduce
césts and enhance efficiency,”
the company said.

The operations of satellite

facilities such as Lexington will

be combined with those of four
remaining business offices,
eliminating 33 positions state-
wide and saving a projected $3.2

million over the next five years.

Nine employees are slated to
lose their jobs when the Lex-
ington office merges with the
Charlottesville location. The
resulting savings are projected
at $94,000 during 1985.

“What this savings will mean
is that rate increases will not be
as great as some were in the
past,”’ said W.H. Camden, head
of Centel’s Lexington office.

“There’s mixed reaction from
the public, but most of them
understand the cost savings
when it’s explained to them in
detail,”’ he added.

Camden said economies of
scale result from moving per-

sonnel and paperwork to one
central office in a larger city.
The greater efficiency he said
would be passed along in savings
to customers.

He added that customers will
be able to pay their telephone
bills at local banks and will be
able to return telephones when
necessary to a nearby service
facility.

Jim Davis, director of the
Division of Communication of
the State Corporation Commis-
sion, which regulates Centel,
said the commission would be
“‘very hesitant’’ to criticize the
office closings in light of the
potential savings to customers.

“The commission has deter-
mined that the company is try-
ing to save money,” he said.
“That’s what they’re supposed
to be doing. It seems that they’re
trying to help themselves — and
their customers.’’

Davis noted, however, that
Centel had mishandled the
public relations aspect of the
move. ‘‘We think Centel sort of
dropped the ball in letting the
public know what they were do-
ing,’’ he said.

Both Lexington City Council
and the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors passed
resolutions shortly after the an-
nouncement requesting that
Centel provide customers with
further details of the anticipated
effects of closing the office.

“Our area has been, and still
remains, subject to documented
poor telephone service that can
only be made worse by such a
closure,” the Lexington resolu-
tion said.

Camden said that although ‘‘in
past years the service was less
than to be desired,’”’ the recent
installation of newer switching
equipment has resulted in ‘“‘ex-
cellent service.”

Lexington Mayor Charles F.
Phillips, a Washington and Lee
economics professor, said of-
ficials have been meeting with
Centel representatives, and that
“they have not been unrespon-
sive to our concerns.”

“IT feel rather strongly that if
you lose that local contact, you
potentially have greater service
problems,” he said, however.

“It’s taking place at a time
when the whole telecommunica-
tions industry is changing, and
there’s tremendous confusion
among customers, and it’s not
going to be any better,” Phillips
added.

The service representatives,
meanwhile, remain unconvinced
that the move is necessary,
although Camden notes that ‘‘no
one ever likes to be transferred
or relocated.”

Those whose positions are be-
ing eliminated have the option of
relocating to Charlottesville or

WGL ‘famous’ in Kansas, a ‘quirk’ in Pa.

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Assistant News Editor

 

“Washington and Lee Univ.
Bites the Bullet, Goes Coed.”

That’s how the Nashville Ten-
nessean informed its readers
that a small university in Lex-
ington, Va., had broken a 235-
year-old tradition.

now will be required to visit
girls’ schools, he added.

Pate said the women he inter-
viewed were interested in the
same majors and career goals
as the male students. There also
seems to be no distinct pattern of
where the women contacting
W&L live.

The women interviewed so far
tend to excel academically and
participate in school activities,
he said.

“They seem to be well
qualified. They’re going to be
very reasonable candidates for
admission. In fact, reasonable
might be a little mild,’ Pate
said.

Pate said that the University
is ‘‘not wedded to any particular
number’’ of females it would like
to enroll in 1985.

“The number of women who
will enroll will all depend on the
number who are qualified,’ he
said. ‘‘We are not going to use a
double standard.”

 

 

were not alone in receiving quick
notice of W&L’s change. News-
papers across the country, from
Miami to Walla Walla, Wash.,
carried wire service accounts of
the decision.

Jeff Hanna, director of the
W&L News Office, says students
and faculty members will soon
get a chance to look through a
collection of news clippings
about W&L’s decision from
papers across the country. A
clipping service, hired by the
university has seen copies of
hundreds of articles chronicling
the decision.

“I’ve resisted using these clip-
ping services in the past, but this
was something we wanted to
keep track of,’’ Hanna said. It
was worth it. Three months
before the coeducation decision
was made in July, the clipping
service began sending the news
office a copy of every story car-
ried in a newspaper around the
country about W&L. Clippings
concerning the initial announce-
ment of the decision are still
coming in.

“Once we get it more com-
plete, we may take it over to the
library for people to see it,”
Hanna said.

He said the decision probably
received as much notice as it did
in cities far from Lexington
because the decision was made
on a weekend. Newspapers, he
pointed out, are always in need
of filler material on Sundays and
Mondays, when hard news is
scarce.

Newspapers in many cities
east of the Mississippi carried
fairly long versons of the wire
service stories about the deci-
sion, while smaller newspapers
used the story to fill an inch or
two of empty space. No two
headlines were the same — or
even similar. “My favoriate
headline is from the Wichita
Falls Times,’”’ said Hanna. “It
said ‘Famous University Goes
Coed.’ ”

The Norristown (Pa.) Times-
Herald carried the W&L story
under a section entitled ‘‘Quirks
in the News.” The item below
the W&L story dealt with the ar-
rest of three nude sunbathers at
Assateague Island.

Prominent papers such as The
New York Times, USA Today
and The Washington Post also

carried stories about W&L and
coeducation.

“We came very close to being
in Time Magazine the next
week,’’ Hanna said.

Time’s Atlanta bureau resear-
ched the article and interviewed
President John D. Wilson and
several other people involved in
the decision, explained Hanna.
The story got ‘‘bumped’’ from
the issue because it was a busy
news week, with the Olympics
approaching and Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro being selected as
Walter Mondale’s running mate,
he added.

Hanna said he was surprised
more newspapers did not play up
the fact that W&L announced it
was going coed during the same
week that Mondale selected Fer-

raro as the first woman to run
for vice president on a major
party ticket. Hanna said only
USA Today and a radio talk
show host in Beaufort, S.C.,
seemed interested in the
parallels between the Ferraro
nomination and the coed deci-
Sion.

Hanna said he did notice
several errors in the wire ser-
vice stories. The Associated
Press story erroneously re-
ported that George Washington
had founded W&L, and a United
Press International article
described W&L as a place where
most of the students wear ties
voluntarily.

“I don’t think anyone was
wrong about the decision,’ Han-
na said.

Vacation change not recommended

 

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

A proposal to replace the
Thanksgiving vacation with a
one-week October vacation will
not be recommended to the
faculty Executive Committee by
another faculty committee,
University Registrar Harold S.
Head said this week.

The faculty Committee on
Registration and Schedules, of
which Head is chairman, will
recommend to the faculty EC
Monday that the University
lengthen classes from 50 to 55
minutes and that the 12-124
academic claendar be retained.

Head’s committee was asked
to review the proposals made by
an ad hoc calendar committee

established last year to review
W&L’s academic calendar.

The 11-member calendar com-
mittee, which included two
students, submitted its report to
President John D. Wilson April
30.

The package presented to
Wilson included a three-page
report containing four major
propositions: 1) retaining the
12-12-46 calendar; 2) extending
class periods from 50 to 55
minutes, thus extending the
school day from 8 a.m. to 5:55
p.m.; 3) eliminating Thanksgiv-
ing vacation and adding a one-
week break in the middle of Oc-
tober; 4) seeking more ways of
simplifying and reducing the ex-
cessive amount of time and

paper work now involved in.

registration and changes in
registration caused by drop-
adds.

The Registration and
Schedules Committee opposes
the third and fourth recommen-
dations, Head said.

Attached to the calendar com-
mittee’s report is a five-page ap-
pendix containing a proposal for
a calendar consisting of five six-
week terms that would allow for
more flexibility than the current
calendars. That proposal was to
be distributed to department
heads for future consideration.

Ina poll taken by the calendar
committee last spring, more
than 620 students responded.
Results of the poll showed 90.3
percent of the students favoring
the 12-12-6 calendar, 78.9 percent
opposed to 55-minute classes,
93.8 percent opposed to elim-
inating Thanksgiving break, and
98.9 percent opposed to a one
time per year class registration
period.

According to John H. Wise,
chemistry professor and chair-
man of the calendar committee,
the proposals probably will go to
the University Council, con-
sisting of both students and
faculty, after the faculty EC.

“Their (the U.C.’s) recom-
mendations would be brought to
the faculty as a whole,” said
Wise. ‘All these other commit-
tees are doing is making recom-
mendations. The faculty has the
final say on it.”’

The entire faculty was
originally expected to vote on
the proposals in Ootober. ‘‘I
think that’s what they'd like to
do. I don’t know if they’ll be able
to do it,’’ Head said. “If any
changes are made, they would
have to be made before the end
of this calendar year,’’ said
Wise.

department, Patricia M. Wal-
ther as assistant dean of the law
school, Richard G. Marks as
assistant professor of religion
and Lt. Col. Luke B. Ferguson

members. Six are natives of
foreign countries while two
others are coming from teach-
ing assignments abroad.

Ms. Campis (romance lan-
guages) is a native of Puerto
Rico. She received her bache-
lor’s and master’s degrees from

the State University of New
York at Stony Brook and the
master’s of philosophy from
Columbia University, where
she is currently working on her
doctorate. She is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and was a
President’s Fellow at Columbia
in 1978.

Cho (mathematics) is a
native of Seoul, Korea, and a
graduate of Seoul University,
from which he also received his
master’s degree in mathemat-
ics. He received his Ph.D. from
Rutgers. He is a member of the
American Mathematical Socie-
ty and the Korean Mathemati-
cal Society.

Cullen (military science) is a
graduate of the University of
Arizona and came to the W&L
Army ROTC program from
Fort Sill, Okla., where he was a
battery commander and opera-
tions officer.

Gaylard (music) was born in
Ottawa, Canada, and received
his undergraduate degree in
both mathematics and music
from Carleton University of Ot-
tawa. He received the master of
arts and the master of philoso-
sophy degrees in musicology
from Columbia University. He
is a member of the American
Musicological Society and the
College Music Society. He will
teach piano in addition to music
appreciation and_ history
courses.

Gumenik (accounting) is a
native of Newark, N.J. He
received the bachelor of arts
degree from Queens College of
the City University of New York
and both the M.S. and the

of Suffolk, England, and receiv-
ed his bachelor of arts from the
University of Durham, England.
He received a masters of arts
and his doctorate from Duke
University. A native of Colum-
bia, S.C., he has previously
taught for 25 years at Wittenberg
University. He also taught at the
University of Michigan, Win-
throp College, Hampden-Sydney
College and Wake Forest, where
he taught last year as a visiting
professor. He is a member of the
Mathematics Association of
America, the American Mathe-
matical Society and the Ohio
Academy of Science.

Two of the five women newly
appointed to the Washington and
Lee faculty said this week they

have few problems teaching.

their male students, who seem to
be enthusiastic.

“I felt the men would be more
reserved but I have found that
not to be true ... they have been
enthusiastic and _ energetic,”
said Kathy Jo Koberstein, assis-
tant professor of romance
languages.

“So far, I just think it’s fan-
tastic,”’ said Adoracion Campis,
also an assistant professor of
romance languages. ‘‘They
seem very enthusiastic and will-
ing to work hard.”

Ms. Campis, who taught at
Columbia College in New York
before it began admitting
women a year ago, said, ‘‘Here,
the students are more easy-
going, friendlier...in New York,
they’re a little more reserved.”

Both language professors

noted the problems of trying to
teach such things as ‘Miss,’
‘“‘Mrs.”’ and ‘‘Mr.”’ to an all-male
class.

The atmosphere of W&L will
change when women enter the
school next fall, Ms. Koberstein
said. “I think the women that
come here will be bright and
assertive and that it will be
positive for men. around here to

interact with them,” she added.

“It will be an exciting time —

coeducation, a new dean and a
new curriculum — the changes
have really intrigued me.”’

Ms. Campis said the admis-
sion of women will ‘‘not be a
negative thing” and that “it was
hinted that the University was
thinking about coeducation”
when she applied for the posi-
tion.

“T like it this way,” she added,
‘but I think it will be good also
as a coed school.”

Dawson says EC hopes to assist
committees in planning for coed

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee’s
primary goal this year is to ease
the transition to coeducation,
student body President Cole
Dawson said after the year’s
first EC meeting Monday night.

Dawson said the EC plans to
work closely with a number of
campus committees to see
whether any changes need to be
made before women are admit-
ted next fall.

Those committees include the
Board of Trustees’ Committee
on Coeducation, a_ student-
faculty committee chaired by
Assistant Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson and a possible
female committee that would be
chaired by a law student.

Although Dawson voted a-
gainst coeducation in last year’s
EC recommendation to the
Board of Trustees, he said he is
now. a_ strong supporter of
coeducation and will do all he
can to prepare the school for it.

As incoming student body
president, Dawson participated
in the board’s extensive co-
education study and declared at
the July press conference an-
nouncing the coeducation deci-
sion that he had decided during
the summer to support the
change.

“Last year I started out
vehemently opposed to coeduca-
tion,’’ Dawson said this week. ‘‘I
didn’t think Wé&L traditions
would be able to survive with
coeducation.”’

“But every time the board
met, new evidence was pre-
sented that pointed toward

coeduation,”’ he continued.

“I decided to support coeduca-
tion three weeks before the deci-
sion, but I did not overwhelming-
ly support it,’’ Dawson recalled.

“The trustees would look at
me and say, ‘Cole, do we get the
impression that you are for
coeducation?’ and I’d_ say,
‘Yeah,’ and they’d say, ‘Wow.’ ”’

Another of Dawson’s goals is
to make the ‘‘White Book’’ on the
Honor Code more readable for
students. The White Book revi-
sion process begins in January.

Dawson said a lecture from a
graduate stressing the impor-
tance of the honor system that
the freshmen were given during
orientation this year should be
helpful in increasing their a-
wareness of the system.

The new president said he
hopes to increase communica-
tion with the student body and to
make sure that students under-
stand the workings of the Ex-
ecutive Committee, especially
during this year of change.

Last year’s Executive Com-
mittee was criticized for the
haste with which it acted on
some matters, including at-
tempting to reduce the number
of guilty votes needed to convict
a student in a public honor trial
and requesting that professors
require students to wear ties to
class.

“On any major issue I never
want to make a quick decision,”’
Dawson said.

“I think in the past — not
necessarily singling out last
year — a lot of big issued came
up, and the EC president reacted
immediately.’

Representatives of the Ex-

Jecutive Committee and the Stu-

dent Bar Association have
scheduled a meeting today to
determine the percentage of
Law School student taxes that
will be kept by the SBA this year.

EC Vice President James
White, chairman of the EC’s
finance subcommittee, said the
EC returned 79.5 percent of law
student taxes to the SBA last
year. He added that he expects
this year’s, percentage to be
about 80 percent.

The Law School tax increased
by $5 this year, White said. At to-
day’s meeting, SBA officers will
indicate whether that increase
will cover Law School expenses.

“We're going to give the SBA
what they need,’’ White said. He
added that the EC expects a
figure of between 80 and 82 per-
cent, but it will not accept
anything greater than 85 per-
cent.

“If they need more money,
they can come to us at the end of
the year,”’ he said.

White, junior EC represen-
tative Pay Hayden and SBA

EC, SBA to decide

law school allotment

President John Sicilian met last
week and agreed on an estimate
of 80 percent, White said, but
that figure must be approved by
the SBA’s Board of Governors.

Sicilian could not be reached
for comment this week.

This year marks the first time
that the SBA has been auton-
omous from the EC. In past
years, the EC has allocated
funds to the SBA as if it were a
club. However, because. law
students do not participate in
many undergraduate activities,
the SBA wanted to handle its
own money.

Last year, about 20 percent of
the Law School student taxes
went to the EC. White called that
a fair percentage because law
students comprise about 20 per-
cent of the total student body.

“T think it’s going to work out
really good,’’ he added.

Based on an estimate of 350
law students, the total amount of
Law School taxes will be $26,250,
80 percent of which is $21,000.
This means an additional $5,250
would go to the EC this year.

Law students pay a $100 stu-
dent activities fee (the same as
undergraduates) and an addi-
tional $20 to the SBA.

Virginia Film Office, said this
week.

Representatives of the com-
pany visited Lexington with
Spaulding three times during
June and “found a number of
sites they liked and wanted to
use,’’ Spaulding said.

Among those were the Robert
E. Lee Episcopal Church, the
restored Main Street area and
some locations near the Visitor’s
Center, he added.

The 18-hour miniseries for
ABC-TV is to be based on John
Jakes’ Civil War novel, ‘North

Warner Brothers had planned
to film in Front Royal and Rich-
mond in addition to Lexington,
Spaulding said.

After negotiations with ABC,
though, the company was forced
to reduce its production budget
and change its timetable,

eliminating Lexington and Front _

Royal.

The company now plans to
film in Richmond for about a
month early next year, he add-
ed.

Filming will be done in four
states for the miniseries, which
Spaulding said will have a ‘‘very

Pavilion to open Oct. 12;
students to have priority

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Lacking only some paint and
floor covering, the long-awaited
student activities pavilion under
construction near Lewis Hall
will be unveiled Oct. 12,
according to University of-
ficials.

Scott Beebe, assistant super-
intendent of Buildings and
Grounds, said the finishing

every day here at Washington
and Lee.

General Lee fought the
greatest Lost Cause of all, one
much greater than our fight. His
motives were much more
honorable and his consequences
of losing were far greater than
ours.

Yet, upon the inevitable
defeat, he was not bitter. His
devotion to reconciliation and
transition earned him much of
the honorable reputation he en-
joys today — a major reason his
name is held in higher esteem
than that of Jefferson Davis.

I cannot hide my disappoint-
ment. We cannot be expected to
do so. But let us too put bit-
terness aside and work for
reconciliation and transition.

Let us put our devotion to the
University above one aspect of
it. And let us strive for that
nobleness of character that will
allow us to let the past be but the
past and look instead to the ex-
citing and prosperous days
ahead at Washington and Lee.

touches on the building, which
was begun in June, should be
completed by mid-November.

In addition to serving as a site
for a wide range of social ac-
tivities, the pavilion will double
as an athletic facility, par-
ticularly during inclement
weather, according to Beebe,
who is overseeing the construc-
tion.

When completed, the activities
floor will be covered with Mon-
doflex, a quarter-inch, rubber-
based surface similar to that on
many gymnasium floors. The
surface is designed to withstand
the rubber cleats of athletes and
the ground-in beer and cigaret-
tes of dancers.

‘“‘We checked (the surface) at
a similar installation up at
Northwestern, and they said that
they got along fine,”’ said Frank
Parsons, assistant to the Univer-
sity president.

A raised stage has been con-
structed at one end of the
pavilion, and a doubles tennis
court will be marked out on the
main floor. The building is 150
feet long and 92 feet wide and
has a 24-foot tall ceiling.

One of the reasons the pavilion
was built, Parsons said, was to
provide a location for special ac-
tivities other than Evans Dining
Hall and Warner Center.

Another consideration, he
said, was reducing the amount of
driving between campus and
Zollman’s Pavilion, where many
parties have been held in the
past.

A set of guidelines governing
the use of the pavilion was
drawn up last year by the Stu-
dent Activities Board, approved
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee and reviewed by the Board of
Trustees.

The guidelines give first
priority to university-wide social
functions, second priority to
university organizations not
open to all students and third
priority to community and non-
college groups. The pavilion will
have a capacity of about 1,200
people.

“I think it’s going to work out
so that when the students need it,
then that will be the higher
priority,’’ Parsons said.

All social events will be coor-
dinated through Associate Dean
of Students Mike Cappeto and
the SAB, The events may be
scheduled only on weekends, and
the fee is $75 for university
organizations and $150 for non-
university groups, excluding
clean-up costs.

W&L students paid an addi-
tional $25 in activities fees this
year to help finance the pavilion,
which will cost about $650,000.

Mesner to plead not guilty; bond hearing set

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

The man charged with arson
and murder in connection with
last spring’s fraternity house
fire said today that he will plead
not guilty to both charges.

“There’s not much of a deci-
sion to make,” Scot Tanner
‘Mesner said in an interview this
morning at the Rockbridge
County Jail. ‘I’m going to plead
innocent. I am innocent.”’

Mesner, a 19-year-old resident
of Hollins College near Roanoke,
has been held at the jail since he
was indicted Sept. 4 by a Rock-
bridge County grand jury.

A local magistrate has set bail
at $150,000 for a cash bond or
$300,000 for a property bond.

Eric L. Sisler, a local Lex-
ington lawyer who is represen-
ting Mesner, said a bond hearing
has been set for next Wednes-
day.

Attorney G. Marshall Mundy
of Roanoke, who is also repre-
senting Mesner, confirmed that
his client will plead not guilty to
both charges. He called the
amount of the bail ‘‘exorbitant.’’

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton, one of the officers who
arrested Mesner, said a request
for a reduction in bail is ‘‘almost
routine when the amount is that
high.”

Mesner said he was familiar
with the evidence that will be us-
ed in the case, and added, ‘‘I
don’t know how they got an in-
dictment from it.”

“There’s no way in the world
they can prove I was here,” he
said. ‘I can prove I wasn’t
here.”

“Certainly the evidence points
toward me, but it’s not very
strong,” he added.

Commonwealth’s Attorney

Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read said he
could not comment on the nature
of the evidence against Mesner,
but said the suspect could not be
familiar with it.

“His lawyers have not seen
any of the evidence we have
against him, nor has he,’’ Read
said.

Read said there are no plea
negotiations underway between
him and representatives of
Mesner.

Mesner said he’d spent a lot of
time thinking about the charges
against him. “I’m sorry that
Tom died, regardless of how it

happened, because I knew him,”
he said.

Sophomore Thomas J. Fellin
died of smoke inhalation in the
April fire that destroyed the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house.

Chief Sutton said Mesner was
jailed within hours of the grand
jury charge by authority of a
document issued along with the
indictments that serves in lieu of
an arrest warrant.

Nearly 40 other people were in-
dicted by the Sept. 4 panel. The
police chief said he was uncer-
tain whether any of the other in-
dividuals have been taken into

Fini sees Rush, building
as the keys to its future

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

 

 

Members of Phi Gamma Delta
say a new house and a strong
Rush should mean a bright
future for the fraternity despite
the fire that destroyed their
house last spring.

Rush chairman Art Candarian
said 73 people signed up for Rush
open houses at Fiji, and that the
house has been pleased with the
enthusiastic response of fresh-
men.

“The freshmen coming
through Fiji represent a diverse
group of guys from many dif-
ferent states,’ Candarian said.

The focal point of Fiji’s Rush
program has been at 108 Henry
St., where a number of the
fraternity’s members live.

Candarian said he is concern-
ed about dirty rushing, but is
otherwise optimistic about the
fraternity’s pledge prospects.

Several members said the fact

that the fire had brought them
closer together had been helpful
to their Rush effort.

Next year’s Rush should be
quite a bit easier, Candarian
said, since by that time they
should have a new house.

Construction has begun on a
new building on the same site as
the old one. The foundation and
three of the existing walls likely
will be retained.

Candarian said insurance pro-
ceeds are expected to cover the
cost of the new structure.

Two sets of plans are being
considered for: the house. The
finished building is expected to
be similar in appearance to the
old one.

Some members were not total-
ly satisfied with the indictment
of a suspect for the burning of
the house and the death of soph-
omore Thomas J. Fellin.

“Finding the arsonist doesn’t
do any good,” Candarian said.
“It doesn’t bring Tom back.”

custody.

“The reason he was arrested
so quickly was that we didn’t
want him to flee or establish an
alibi,” Sutton said. ‘“There are
all kinds of things he could have
done if he had been allowed to go
free.’”’

“TI couldn’t believe it,’’ Mesner

said of the arrest at the Roanoke
restaurant where he worked. ‘‘I
was on my first day of training,
following another waiter down
the aisle, and the cops come in
and cuff me and stuff me.

“Tt made a real scene in the
restaurant.”

Despite Ms. Albert’s criticism
of the attitude of W&L men, she
still prefers to party in Lex-
ington rather than in Farmville.

“Until you know a few people
at W&L, no one talks to you,’’ she
explained. ‘‘That’s the big com-
plaint about W&L guys with
Randy Mac girls — that they
won’t come up and talk to you.”

Ms. Albert said that girls are
“an ornament for freshmen’’ at
Hampden Sydney as much as
they are at W&L, but at Hamp-
den Sydney they ‘“‘still have a
good time — we're not put
upon.”’

“I think Hampden-Sydney
men are sort of gooberish, ac-
tually,”’ she said. “It’s just that
they are really eager to meet
girls.”’

Trichel Berryman commented
on the W&L party system from
the perspective of a Hollins Col-
lege freshman.

“You meet a million people
during rush,” she said. ‘“‘They
have to go through the routine:
‘What’s your name?’, ‘Where

and remaining in Lexington.

Mary Staton, who began work-
ing for the phone company in
Lexington in 1952, says she’ll
probably accept one of the
operator positions.

“T’ve been up there before in
operator services,’’ she said, ad-
ding that the change would be
“kind of inconvenient” because
‘the hours are split and I have a
small son and live 10 miles out of
town.”’

Mrs. Staton says the Lex-
ington office is important
because ‘‘the customer is
definitely first here.’’ She wor-
ries that the ‘consolidation will
harm elderly customers and
those without checking accounts
who pay their bills in cash.

Marie Odend’hal, who is in her
29th year with the company, was
offered either an operator ser-
vices or a janitor job in Lex-
ington.

She has enrolled in a night typ-
ing class at Lexington High
School in hopes of qualifying for
a plant clerk job at the Centel
service facility on U.S. 60 outside
Lexington.

“I don’t think the customers’
bills are going to go down and
they’re not going to stay the
same,’’ she said.

Mrs. Tillery said it’s ‘‘rough’’
to think of not seeing her
customers again.

“We know most of our
customers by name because
we’ve been here so long,” she
said. “It’s a big company. When
they leave here, they’ll never be
able to provide the same per-
sonal service.”’

“It’s just a big thing,” she con-
tinued. ‘‘They’re losing all their
personal touches.’’

“I’m not sure anyone wants to
hear about it,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s
what hurts. They say they’re

 

 

are you from?’, ‘What year are

you?’, ‘Where’s your
hometown?’.
“The freshmen are just glad to

be there but they can’t wait till
it’s over,’’ continued Ms. Ber-
ryman. ‘‘Overall, it’s not so bad,
because it’s temporary.”

She hopes the situation will im-
prove after Rush. ‘‘The girls are
not getting the attention now
that they may get when Rush is
over,” she said. “There are so
many girls here at parties,
though, that by the time we roll
in around 11 o’clock, we have to
approach the guys.”’

“A lot of guys say in essence,
“You’re here to meet us,’ ’’ Ms.
Berryman complained. ‘But
overall I love it, it’s a fun place
and there are all the good
elements of a party, as well.”’

Margaret Kennedy, a first-
year student at Southern
Seminary, has noticed that the
parties get better after everyone
has had a beer or two to relax.

“At most of the parties I’ve
been to, they’ve all been pretty
wasted and they seemed to have
loosened up by the time I got
there,”’ she said.

Ms. Kennedy said she has
discovered going to parties with

sorry we’re leaving but I don’t
think they really care. If they
did, they’d try to do something
about it.”

Dorothy Coleman, a 27-year
veteran of the Lexington phone
company, said she’ll probably
accept the transfer to Charlot-
tesville because Centel, ‘is a
good company to work for.”’

“T’m afraid I'll have to drive,”’
she said. ‘‘I don’t think I’d want
to quit.”

“I love my job,” she con-
tinued. ‘We're a close-knit fami-
ly that works well together.
Sometimes it takes face-to face
contact to get the job done. I
think we really go overboard to
try to help the customers.”’

She said that a_ special
pleasure of the job is the annual
influx of students at Washington
and Lee and Southern Seminary.

“We look forward to the

students every year,”’ she said.
“They’re like our children when
they come back each year. We
try to educate them about how
they can get stuck with their
bills and things like that.”

“T can’t see the savings,’’ Mrs.
Coleman said of the consolida-
tion. ‘I’m sure it’s there. Maybe
I just don’t want to see it.”’

itial moments at the houses.

“It’s not too hard to get in-
troduced then, because if I am
with somebody they know, then
they come over and I get in-
troduced,” she said.

Polly Paton, a sophomore at
Sweet Briar, noticed the dif-
ference in behavior at the two
schools.

“First impressions make a big
difference, and Hampden-
Sydney makes a better one,”’ she
said. “The Hampden-Sydney
guys make more of an effort to
talk to girls.

“When you go to W&L, it’s
more like a meatmarket situa-
tion, because you know they are
looking around to decide if you
are good-looking enough to talk
to.”

“Once you meet a W&L guy or
two, then everybody is really
friendly,’ Ms. Paton continued.

“If you are an outgoing type of
girl, then you can make it
work,”’ she added. ‘But a lot of
girls aren’t that way.”’

Ms. Paton contends that there
are more important things than
perfect manners, however: ‘‘I’d
still rather go to W&L than
Hampden-Sydney.”’

T ough schedule, tough team

LES
By MICHAEL McALLISTER

Staff Writer

There can be no doubt that the
1984 Washington and Lee soccer
team has quite a_ difficult
schedule this season.

In what head coach Rolf
Piranian calls ‘‘the most
challenging schedule W&L has
ever had,” the Generals will
face defending national cham-
pion UNC-Greensboro and four
other potential contenders for
NCAA post-season tournament
bids. But Piranian is confident
that his team can meet the
schedule’s challenges.

“T feel that it is a tribute to our
players that we have such tough
competition because we have the
talent to win each game,’’ said
the General’s mentor.

Piranian’s confidence is a
result of the fact that the
Generals are a very experienced
team. Only three players were
lost to graduation from last
year’s 8-5 team, but the loss in-
cludes former All-South forward

Roland Simon.

Tremendous talent is also an
important asset to the team this
year. “This is the most talent we
have had in my four years, and if
we play consistently, the
playoffs are very possible,” said
senior Mark Sullivan, one of the
team’s three captains.

“Our defense must be up for
every game if we are to be suc-
cessful,”’ said Piranian. The
defense could be a key to the
season and a team strength if
they play tough every game.
Captain and three-year starter
Rob Coleman, a senior, returns
at sweeper, while senior Todd
Hermann returns at stopper.
Juniors Watson Barnes and John
Templeton and sophomore Mark
Millar, Tom Peters, Jim Sloan
and Jim Tucker will all be trying
to gain one of the two open spots
at the wing position.

will provide the backup.

The midfield positions should
be the team’s strongest asset,
with five experienced mid-
fielders coming back. The

veteran midfield group consists.

of seniors Sullivan, Gary
Clements and Jeff Reichert,
junior Keith Scott and
sophomore Tem Myers, with
sophomore Tommy Pee also ex-
pected to see a lot of action this
year.

The Generals lost the talent of
Simon at forward but are sure
they have quality players who
can fill the gap. Junior Bill
Holmes, the third captain,
scored five goals and had seven
assists in 1983 and should be the
most prominent forward this
year. Juniors Eric Obeck and
David Eckardt and sophomores
Hank Greenberg, Ken Randby
and Corky Parkinson should also
contend for playing time.

The incoming freshmen will
also provide team strength.
“The freshman class lacks in
numbers, but makes up for it
with some excellent quality,”
Piranian said.

“This team has great depth,”
Sullivan agreed. ‘‘There are no
weak links and everyone must
contribute.”

Whether this holds true will be
seen on Saturday and Sunday
when the Generals open their
season at the Emory University

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals combined a
balanced running attack with a
stubborn defense and an ex-
cellent kicking game to turn
back the Dickinson Red Devils
36-7 in the opening game of the
1984 season.

The Generals were in control
throughout the contest, allowing
Dickinson just 133 yards of total

offense. The Red Devils’ lone |

score came late in the second
quarter after they recovered a
fumbled punt in W&L territory.

The Generals. were effective
on offense Saturday. Led by
senior tailback Gene Girard’s 81
yards and two touchdowns on 25
carries, W&L stuck primarily to
ground, churning out 215 total
yards rushing. Fullback Frank
Surface (75 yards on 14 carries)
helped keep the Dickinson
defense off balance with his
charges up the middle.

W&L got on the scoreboard
first when James White booted a
36-yard field goal in the first
quarter. Early in the second
quarter, quarterback Bobby
Wilson scored on a 14-yard run,
and Girard added a 3-yard
touchdown run, giving the
Generals a 17-0 lead.

White kicked his second field
goal of the game later in the
quarter, this one coming from 44
yards and tying a school record
of 44 yards set in 1978 by Randy
Austin. Dickinson scored its only
touchdown after White’s kick,
leaving the Generals with a 20-7
halftime lead.

In the second half, the
Generals quickly eliminated any

hope of a Dickinson comeback.
Wilson, who finished the day
with 70 yards passing, scored his
second touchdown of the day on
a -yard keeper, extending
W&L’s lead to 27-7. The Generals
added two more points to the
lead after an errant Dickinson
snap on a punt attempt sailed out
of the'end zone for a safety.

Girard tallied his second score
of the day in the fourth quarter
on a 3-yard plunge, making the
final score 36-7.

W&L Coach Gary Fallon said
he was pleased with his team’s
performance and could find no
real weaknesses based on Satur-
day’s play.

“We executed well in many
areas, which is crucial, especial-
ly in the first game,’ Fallon
said. ‘The defense played well,
the offense scored when we
needed it and the kicking and
punting teams were outstand-
ing.”

Fallon does believe that his

‘team must improve from its first
performance if it is to defeat
Emory & Henry this Saturday.

“We must improve in some
areas if we are to win this Satur-
day,” he added. “Emory &
Henry is an aggressive, well-
coached team with a lot of retur-
ning veterans.”’

The game, which will be
played at Wilson Field, is the
first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference contest for both teams.
E&H opened its season by
defeating Centre 19-14 last Satur-
day.

“It is an important ODAC
game for both of us,” Fallon
said, ‘‘so I know they will be
ready to play.”’

TIME OUT

... saturday
was probably
the greatest
day of tennis
many of us will
ever see. But
by now that is
rather obvious,

  

 

 

~ and, 1 think,

 

rather trivial. What is worthy of
comment is something that, un-
fortunately, stuck out like a sore
thumb despite the skyrocketing
level of play. Specifically, I am
referring to the Connors-
McEnroe semifinal, a five-setter
filled with spectacular shotmak-
ing and great emotion from both
sides of the net. But these virtues
of the match were overshadowed
by the distasteful lack of sport-
smanship and the general mis-
behavior of Connors and
McEnroe.

The power of _ television

Remillard

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

 

Head water polo coach Page
Remillard and his team have
labeled their coming season as
“The Miracle of 1984.”

“That’s what it is going to take
to beat Richmond and win the
Southern League this year, a
miracle,” said Remillard.

According to Remillard, the
two-week practice session,
beginning Aug. 27, presented
him with physically conditioned
players, positive attitudes, a
“great” freshman class and new
faces on the varsity squad.

Freshman Eric Sullivan and
Kevin Ledderer, a member of
last year’s B team, are new addi-
tions to the varsity.

Ten players, including All-
American Tim Stanford, from
last year’s 25-12 Southern
League Championship team
return to the 1984 team.
Remillard, however, will miss
several important players from
last year’s squad. All-Americans
Kevin Kadesky and Tim Rock
are lost to graduation, while also
missed will be players from last
year’s team who have decided to
concentrate on their swimming
this fall in preparation for the
swim team’s season this winter.
Notably, sophomore Jay Reville,
who had a successful season as a
freshman on last year’s water
polo team but an even more suc-
cessful season on the swim
team, will not play water polo
this year.

Remillard believes that seim-
mers like Reville who concen-
trate on their swimming instead
of water. polo .will. make a

less the obscenities and the ar-
rogance of the once-and-still-
spoiled brats were there to be
seen and, I hope, served the
same relative purpose as ‘“‘The
Day After” strived for.

Last week I said that athletes
could no longer serve as role
models. What is disturbing is
that the fact is so often proved
true. McEnroe and Connors no
doubt put forth great efforts, but
these efforts were marred by the
less than gentlemanly attitude
displayed by both. Too many
times, a picture of Connors
would flash across the screen
with the 32-year-old child mut-
tering something that would
be more at home in a condemned
barroom. Too often, there would
be McEnroe whining about a call
or a shot that hadn’t turned out
in his favor. This is not accep-
table behavior from someone
who can be so easily idolized. Is
there similar behavior from
other athletes? Certainly, but it
is not seen, and those athletes
know that. McEnroe and Con-
nors acted with a _ careless
disregard for their positions. At

hopes for a

swim program.

Remillard views the 1984
water polo program as one that
needs rebuilding. He said, ‘‘We
will have to start some players
who are low on experience but
high on motivation.” Remillard
said he is unsure how his inex-
perienced players will react toa
foreign face in a pressure situa-
tion.

Remillard also stated that he
will have difficulty replacing
last year’s All-American goalie
Kevin Kadesky. Remillard ex-
pressed concern with the goalie
position which Charlie Groh and
Kevin Davidson are competing
for.

He stated that the goalies are
not contributing the 100 percent
quality time that he requires at
practice. He believes that a ma-
jor question is whether the
goalies can push themselves in
practice.

Remillard cited swimming
ability, physical condition and
the coachability of his players as
his team’s strengths. Remillard
believes that this coachability
will allow his team to improve
during the season. According to
Remillard, his players’ positive
attitudes and willingness to

one point, Connors disagreed
with a linesman’s call, stomped
to the umpire’s chair and told
him in no uncertain terms that
the linesman was to be removed.
Kind of akin to saying, ‘“‘No, Pro-
fessor Hughes, this test is going
to be true-false, not essay.’’ On
another occasion, the two began
to complain about the position of
some photographers situated be-
hind the courtside scoreboard.
When the photographers replied
that it was a spot reserved for
them, Connors resorted to name-
calling and an arrogant attitude
in the vein of, ‘Don’t give me any
lip — head, just leave.’ So much
for the Family Hour. The ques-
tion is, what is to be done? Or
rather, can athletes be effective-
ly disciplined? The answer is
quickly becoming, “No.’’ It is in-
deed sad that people with so
much talent can be so lacking in
other areas. I think the message
is clear: Today’s athlete at once
encompasses everything that
one should strive for (talent and
ability) and everything that one
should seek to avoid (offensive
behavior that is unworthy of

‘miracle’

learn and work hard will help
prepare his team for each
weekend’s competition.

Although Remillard’s team
may not win as many games as
last year’s team, he does not
doubt the overall success of the
1984 water polo campaign.

Remillard said, “We may not
be able to continue our winning
tradition during the rebuilding
year but we will continue the
tradition of having great people
participating in the aquatics pro-
gram.”

This weekend the Generals
host the W&L Fall Classic. The
Generals first will play against
VCU at 5 p.m. on Friday. The
tournament will be played on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday at
Duke, Johns Hopkins, Arkansas,
UNC-Wilmington and Dayton of
Ohio also will participate in the
tournament.

Forcasting the weekend’s
competition, Remillard said,
‘“‘Navy is a runaway and then it’s
anybody’s game.’’ Concerning
his team’s performance this
weekend, Remillard said, ‘‘If we
are going to win one it will be
against VCU. That is the game
that we could most use a
crowd.”

team can perform like it did in
victories last year, and goalie
Jay Werner can rise to the occa-
sion when needed —and I think
he can — one would be foolish to
dispute Piranian’s claims....In
polo, it may be once more with
feeling as Remillard’s hard
working polo players go looking
for SL title No. 4 in a row. They
again lose some key people.
(The triumvirate of polo power,
Smith, Ravencraft and Rock, is

talent is there. Suggestion: Take

Bail request by
Fiji fire suspect
denied by judge

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

The man indicted for arson and murder in con-
nection with last spring’s Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity house fire was denied a reduction in his
$150,000 bail yesterday.

Scot Tanner Mesner, a 19-year-old resident of
Hollins College, has been held at the Rockbridge
County Jail since his indictment by a grand jury
Sept. 4.

Following two hours of testimony by five
witnesses, Rockbridge Circuit Court Judge
George E. Honts III concluded that “‘the bond that
has been set in this matter is a proper bond.”
Mesner did not testify.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’
Read had requested that bond be denied
altogether because of Mesner’s “prior criminal
conviction and propensity to set fires, which con-
stitutes a danger to himself and to society,”
according to a motion filed with the court.

G. Marshall Mundy of Roanoke, who in conjunc-
tion with Eric L. Sisler of Lexington is
representing Mesner, argued that his client was
the son of “responsible, good, law-abiding
citizens” and that his release would pose no
“unreasonable danger to himself or the public.”

From the moment Mesner entered the cour-
troom wearing a blue blazer, khakis and Top-
siders until the time he left the chambers to return
to jail, the blond youngster impassively watched
the activity around him, saying little and display-
ing no emotion.

Mesner, the son of two Hollins College pro-
fessors, is currently on a one-year probation for a
previous arson-related conviction.

On Oct. 22, Mesner was charged with three

Moanin’? isa?

Four years ago, Lisa Birnbach
gave birth to ‘‘The Official Prep-
py Handbook,” in which she
discussed ‘‘sarcasm” as one of
seven notably preppy attitudes.
“If a colleague is wearing a
short-sleeved shirt with the
Table of Elements depicted on
the back,” she sniffed, ‘‘it would
be absolutely appropriate to
comment, ‘Nice shirt.’ ’’ Equal-
ly apt, she added, would be
“* ‘Nice girlfriend.’ ”

Now she has emitted a second
volume, “Lisa Birnbach’s Col-
lege Book.”

Nice book, Lisa.

Employing a clever combina-
tion of context-free quotations,
outlandish exaggerations and
damaging omissions, Miss Birn-
bach has savaged Washington
and Lee in a book that likely will
become the “‘in’’ item among
trendy high schoolers in search
of a college.

Turning to the W&L entry,
they will find the description of a
school populated with self-cen-
tered, classless louts. The type
of student W&L hopes to attract
is likely to grimace, hold his (or
her!) nose and quickly look
elsewhere.

Miss Birnbach’s tirade is easi-
ly dismissed, if for no other
reason than because of the mul-
titude of errors that riddle the
book. Sweet Briar becomes
“Sweet Brior’’; V.M.I.’s Ring
Figure ball becomes, of all
things, the “Ring Finger’; the
drinking age here becomes 18 in-
stead of 19 (congratulations,
freshmen! ); and a ‘‘Girls in the

Hay’’ banner becomes ‘‘a
popular bumpersticker.”
In last night’s (this morning’s)

“Late Night with David Letter-
man,”’ Miss Birnbach shared’
that through her scrupulous
research she had learned that
Robert E. Lee founded V.M.I.

bach joshed that a ‘‘typographi-
cal error” in the book made it
appear as though she had rated
Indiana University as having the
nation’s ugliest collegiate males,
when she actually meant to so
designate a school in Penn-
sylvania. Miss Birnbach is
laughing about it; the folks at In-
diana U. likely are not.

Neither are we. After perusing
Miss Birnbach’s glowing de-
scriptions of the cuddly critters
over at Hampden-Sydney and
the devoted denizens of V.M.I.,
we are at a loss to imagine how
she can come to the Collonade
and find nothing but neander-
thals and narcissists.

Do we protest too much? Bear-
ing in mind that it’s the bitten
dog that barks the loudest, are
we attacking poor Miss Birn-
bach to avoid accepting her
harsh assessment of W&L?

We think not. If the honor
system, which she fails to even
mention, is not an integral part
of life here, what is? Do we
“abuse women,”’ or do they al-
low themselves to be abused? (It
takes two to tangle, you know.)
Are minorities ‘‘suppressed,”’ or
do they purposely avoid the cam-
pus mainstream? Is it true that
“there are no women here,”’ or is
the person who said that a social
misfit?

To us, Washington and Lee is
more than button downs, illicit
sex and male chauvinism.

We challenge Miss Birnbach to
return to campus to find out
what General Lee’s College is

’ really like. Lunch is on us.

“This book,’’ she writes in the
Introduction, ‘‘should make you
laugh, make you wince, get you
excited and agitated, and make
you think what a truly insightful

First, let us address the case
that received so much notoriety
in last week’s Phi — namely, the
man’s mistreatment of women.
It’s easy to envision: just tilt
your chair back ard think of
young ladies, —some outgoing,
some not; some attractive and
many less so voluntarily yet
bravely subjecting themselves
to a throbbing mass of predic-
tably sauced men _ that
characterize W&L social events.

It is here that, although one
may attempt to deny it, women
are sometimes targets of foul
language, sexual harassment
and other acts of overt rudeness.
Enhanced by a few cups of warm
keg beer, which in its own right
can make the most religious turn
sour, emotions and judgment
are distorted.

Basically, most incidents of
alleged mistreatment fall into
three categories. Number 1: The
girl is actually out-thought and

General thought

To the Editors:

This morning I read a newslet-
ter (?) on the bulletin board in
Newcomb Hall called ‘The
Unknown General.”’ I had hoped,
rather foolishly I suppose, that
we would not have to deal with
such garbage this year. But
since it was marked vol. 1, no.1, I
suppose that we may expect to
see such litter about our campus
for the rest of the year.

For those of you fortunate
enough to have missed ‘‘The
Unknown General,’’ it bemoans
the fact that W&L has gone coed
and explains, in extremely inept
comparisons, why such action
should not have been taken. For
now I will pass over the unfound-
ed and ungentlemanly (I have a

feeling we will all soon be sick of
that tar-baby-like word) attack
upon President Wilson’s charac-
ter. He is far more eloquent than
I and has no need of my defense.
I will likewise pass over the inac-
curacies regarding past and pre-
sent admission statistics; one
only needs to walk to the second
floor of Washington Hall to get
the real figures. What needs to
be addressed is what General
Lee would have thought of such a
publication as ‘‘The Unknown
Soldier.” I think I am correct in
saying that he would be sicken-
ed

General Lee is widely known
for having worked to heal the
wounds caused by the Civil War.

identity, an identity shaped by
the peculiarities of the school’s
development. One aspect attrac-
ting much interest is that of the
concept of the ‘‘Washington and
Lee gentleman.’’ We try to de-
cide what this means to us and
how to apply it to the particulars
of mundane life. This idea,
though it is hardly clear now,
has evolved over time through
complicated stages. It seems
that we must now decide, in light
of what confronts us, whether we
shall redefine this idea or hold to
a static notion of who shall be a
“gentleman.”

The ideal of the W&L gentle-
man has existed since at least
the late nineteenth century. It
had its basis in a concept of the
gentleman developed from early
times, and, as Philip Mason
shows in his book ‘‘The English
Gentleman,” is exemplified in
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Thacke-
ray, Dickens, Trollope and
Waugh in literature, as well as in
painting music and other expres-
sions of the genius of man. As
Mason said, ‘‘No one was quite
sure who was a gentleman and
who was not.”

It was hard to decide what was
a gentleman, and various no-
tions of this person existed side
by side and at different times.
Some considered that a gentle-
man could only be in a certain
class into which he was born,
while others would allow that
three generations were suffi-
cient to create a gentleman from
new money. Since this country
began as a middle-class venture,
Americans have ostensibly
valued merit more than birth.
While various aspects of the idea
changed when it was brought
from England, certain values of
gentlemanliness were retained.
I think I may fairly add courage
and foresight to General Lee’s
values of honesty, fairness and
respect for private property,
which traditionally come to con-
stitute gentlemanliness to us.

Men who valued these ideals,
among other things, formed
brotherhoods for their preserva-
tion and propagation. These
fraternities were formed of like-
minded men pledged to their
ideals and to each other. They
only admitted those considered
worthy, but, once admitted, one
could expect to be treated as a

John W. Elrod, Washington
and Lee’s recently installed
dean of the college, is swiftly
familiarizing himself with W&L
faculty, students and curricu-
lum, while making plans for
enabling the university to turn
out the “‘ideal’’ student.

Although : the former Iowa
State philosophy department
head has only been in Lexington
since August, Elrod said he is
beginning to realize the all-
‘encompassing capabilities of
W&L gentlemen.

“The overall quality of the stu-
dent body at W&L is higher than
the overall quality of the student
body at Iowa State University,’’
Elrod said.

A highly respected authority
on Danish philosopher Soren

 

s¥yusvyyrya

Aaybe Kierkegard, Elrod’s phil-
osophically oriented approach to
the ideal administration and stu-
dent is extremely evident.

“The goal that we have before
us always is introducing stu-
dents into an appreciation of the
life of the mind — helping them
to see how the life of the mind is
connected to living a good life,
and making sure that we have
the kind of faculty we need in
order to accomplish that goal,”
Elrod observed

Elrod said he sets his sights
for W&L high, and part of ac-

complishing his goals is what he
termed his ‘faculty develop-
ment program.”

“We have a faculty that’s

_ highly tenured,” he said. “‘We’re

a middle-aged faculty. We’ve got
a lot of good people here, and one
of the things we want to concen-
trate on, since we’re not going to

be bringing in a lot of new people
any time soon, is figuring out
ways to help them get away
from the University, to go other
places and teach.”’

“‘We want to keep the faculty
invigorated and give them an op-
portunity to be stimulated in
their thinking and their research
and writing,” he continued.

“The way we have to do that, I
think, is to give people an oppor-
tunity to get away, so I’m going
to encourage people to take sab-
baticals and encourage people to
find faculty members in another
part of the country who would
exchange positions with them.”’

“Students are worried about
getting jobs and worried about
getting into graduate school,”’ he
said. ‘‘So often those career wor-
ries or job worries interfere with
coming to appreciate and under-
stand what the life of the mind is

mistreated. Number 2: The
young lady is a quick thinker and
rather than trying to duel with
her using his pickled brain, the
man chooses to ignore her, and
thus she feels as if she is the vic-
tim of unfriendly behavior.
Otherwise, the drunken male
senses defeat or inferiority and
lashes out with a string of four-
letter words that make Scarface
look like Snow White. She is
mistreated. In the third scenar-
io, some amorous male decides
to sow a few wild oats and grabs
a female flank. This, again, con-
stitutes mistreatment, and is
possibly something to get upset
about, but these occasions are
about as frequent as cold keg
beer.

Now, out of fairness, we must
present that ideal situation
which is easily recognized on the
streets of Lexington or, in its
budding stages, off to one side of
the fraternity house dance floor.
Bleary-eyed looks, induced by
love, lust, drunkenness or lack of
sleep, the courageous parting
with one’s smoke-permeated,
beer-drenched jean jacket to
keep their beloved warm on
those cold Virginia evenings (or

mornings); a girl’s sweet voice
charming her man’s car keys
away. Those are just a few of the

characteristics of the ideal
hookup.
This’ situation fosters

weekends of monogamous felici-
ty; the certainty of the compan-
ionship of the opposite sex; at
least in most cases, a guaran-
teed place to stay; as well as
other benefits. These har-
monious relationships come and
go, heartbreaks are inevitable,
marriages are improbable and
pregnancies undesirable, but at
any rate, an air of justice
prevails.

Out of duty to accuracy more
than desire, we must present
another of those unfortunate
cases — female abuse of males.
Whether your eyebrows raise in
skepticism, satisfaction enters
your brain at having ‘‘them”’
blamed for once, or your heart
quickened with expectancy at
the reassurance that there have
been others like yourself, it is all
the same sad fact.

Let us consider this hy-
pothetical but not uncommon set
of circumstances. A_ girl

He never allowed an unkind
word toward General Grant to
be spoken in his presence.
Likewise, he deplored the idea
expressed in the phrase, ‘‘The
South will rise again!”’ He was a
man to let bygones be bygones.
Although it is uncertain as to
whether Lee would support
coeducation, it seems certain
that after such a decision had
already been made, he would
have supported it and worked to
make the transition as easy as
possible.

Consider also ‘‘The Unknown
General’s”’ last sentence: ‘‘The

 

best reaction was given by
Robert E. Lee after Pickett’s
Charge when he whispered ‘Too
bad, too bad, oh, too bad!!’”’
The sentence is written so as to
make the reader believe that
this is Lee’s reaction to coeduca-
tion rather than to the destruc-
tion of a division 15,000 strong. It
offends one’s intellect to read a
comment so obviously taken out
of context.

Mr. Unknown Soldier, please
do not subject us to this garbage
all year long. This university
will need the full support of its
students, alumni, faculty, ad-
ministration, and staff in the
coming year. It does not need

motivations and objectives. She
drinks a fraternity’s beer,
vomits on their floor, leaves
them to clean it up and blames
them for encouraging her to
drink so much so they may take
advantage of her.

Or what about the hordes of
Savage women that desend upon
any W&L man in hopes of getting
that Fancy Dress bid? They’ll
even chase a red head’s step-
child to get a chance at showing
their face at that annual fiesta.
The elusive M.r.s., more uncom-
mon today than in previous
years, provides a perfect set-up
for the male to get scammed. It
goes something like this: boy
meets girl; boy invites girl to
parties; and just when things
look good, boy picks up girl in an
Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser sta-
tion wagon with wood paneling,
luggage rack and AM tunes.
Poor boy bites the big one.

Inconsiderate men exist here
at W&L, at VMI, at Hampden-
Sydney, in all colleges, and, yes,
in the real world. The same is
true of the women at S.B.C.,
M.B.C., H.C. and R.-M.W.C.,
S.S. and the entire female
population in general. For we all
are subject to the same weak-
ness — intergender inconsidera-
tion and even abuse at times.

gentleman and to have to behave
as one. These high ideals were
associated, by tradition, with the
male gender. This association
was sometimes rigid. Emman-
uel Skikaneder, Mozart’s libret-
tist for his fraternal opera ‘‘The
Magic Flute,” wrote of a manly
brotherhood, where the very
presence of women profanes its
holy temple, for the ‘‘tittle tattle
of women (is) made up of lies.’’

Ideas change, especially ones
which are variously defined. The
evolution of the constitutional
structure of England is a good
example of this, resulting in the
extension of the franchise, show-
ing the evolution of the idea of
who is fit to govern. Both the
ideals of gentleman and fraterni-
ty might be considered in this
way.

Perhaps General Lee meant
his school to be one large frater-
nal body. In his time that body
was much more homogeneous
than it is today. It had to accept
successively its first non-Pres-
byterian, its first man from
below the middle class and its

their lab experiments simply
because they’re excited about
what it means to do and dis-
cover,’ he said. ‘‘That’s the kind
of attitude, or frame of mind that
we want to engender in our
students.

‘“‘We want to put somebody out
into society who’s got a mind,
and a tongue, and a pen that will
help them face a world that we
really can’t prepare them for,”’
he continued.

“We want to put people into
the world not with knowledge
and not with information, but
with habits of mind, analytical
abilities, evaluative abilities and
reasoning facilities,’ Elrod said.

“The bottom line is helping
people to cope in an intellectual-
ly, morally and culturally re-
spectaole and creative way.”’

first non-white (even its first
Texan!). Lee must have meant
his ideals to continue to be
valued despite these particular
changes and for the ‘‘fraternal’’
body to accept, and assimilate,
new “gentlemen.”

Now it seems we are presented
with another change. Through-
out its past men of this school
have responded in a manner con-
sistent with their professed
ideals. Shall we be manly
enough to follow their example
now? Shall we accept these
ladies as ‘‘brothers’’ and
“gentlemen,” or shall we treat
them as unwelcome coeds? Per-
haps our own identity is at stake
in this decision. Unlike some
cultures, Britain’s has kept
much of what was good in the
aristocratic order despite the
growing power of the middle
class. It has done this through
the wisdom of its better men,
who had faith in themselves and
their ideals. We must show faith,
so that our ideals will be worth
accepting and our identity not
lost. By being honest to our own
code, we can perhaps keep this,
in the true sense, always a
“‘gentleman’s college.”’

meant to be in good humor.

She said a large part of her
essay deals with coeducation
because “I was a little unhap-
py at the anti-coed feelings of
the students, which were very
strong and very well expressed
to me last year when I visited. ”

The W&L students who par-
ticipated in the interview said
they were disappointed that
Ms. Birnbach expressed only
one side of student opinion on
the coeducation issue and that
she didn’t make any reference
to the W&L honor system.

“I remember specifically
what was said, and I remem-
ber specifically who said it,
and ... she kind of picked and
chose what she wanted to use,”
said John Cleghorn, chief
editor of The Ring-tum Phi last
year.

“I think we said some things
that she didn’t put in there,’
Cleghorn said. ‘‘I think she had
the notes and asked the right
questions to get a good inter-
view. She chose not to use
them.”’

Ms. Birnbach, who gradu-

7 ated from Brown in 1978, had

“a pretty good fix on what
W&L was going to be like and
she let us know she didn’t think
much of the atmosphere,”’ said
Steve Lewis, co-chairman of
the 1984 Mock Democratic Con-
vention.

“She obviously had this pre-
conceived notion of what she
wrote about. I don’t think it’s
anywhere near accurate,”’
Lewis said. ‘I really don’t
know where she came up with
all those stereotypes about
what she wanted W&L to be
like.’”’

Bob Jenevein, last year’s
student body president, said

that in the interview, ‘‘Nobody
had too many bad things to
say...She could’ve painted a
more realistic picture.”’

A discussion of the W&L
honor system evolved into talk
about Lee, the students said.
“‘He’s a god,’’ she quoted one
student as saying. ‘‘We call
him St. Bob.”

Ms. Birnbach, who said she’d
expected W&L to be ‘‘preppy
heaven,”’ added that the stu-
dents’ fascination with Lee sur-
prised her. ‘‘I didn’t realize it
was going to be an academic
shrine to Robert E. Lee,’’ she
said.

She did not mention the
honor system, however, be-
cause, “I just had to make
choices. There’s only so much
that you can say about a
school. I was limited by
space.”’

During the October inter-
view, the honor system ‘‘was
discussed pretty much, and we
all agreed it worked,’ said
Marty Bechtold, 4 dorm coun-
selor who graduated in May.

The only part that made him
upset, Bechtold said, was the
listing, ‘‘Academic Pressure:
‘Ha, Ha, Ha, (sarcastic
laughter) .’ I totally disagree
with that,’’ he added. ‘‘That’s
totally ridiculous.”

None of the students inter-
viewed recalled remarks dur-
ing the interview quoted in the
book about academic pressure,
favorite school tradition (’’Go-
ing down the road — a bunch of
guys get drunk, pile into a car
and set out to abuse girls at a
chosen girl’s school’’), or worst
things about the school (‘It’s
too conservative; no women;
lots of rich, preppy assholes.”’)

Pete Cronin, editor of the

Calyx last year, said that
although Ms. Birnbach was in-
telligent, he was wary of her.

“T’d say she obviously had a
preconceived notion before she
ever showed up,’’ Cronin con-
tinued. “She thought W&L is
full of a bunch of rich, white,
right-wing, upper middle class,
chauvinistic men. Everything
bad you could ever say about
W&L she has said; I don’t think
she’s said any of the good
stuff.’’

Ms. Birnbach seemed im-
pressed with the campus and
the class she visited, Chapman
said. However, he said, ‘‘there
was a good deal of controver-
sy’’ during the interview.

“She was prodding Bob
(Jenevein) a little bit, and he
gave back as good as he got,”
he said. “But she did seem a
little bit startled at the depth of
his views, how firmly he held
his convictions.’’

The essay part of the review,
Chapman added, ‘‘was Bob
Jenevein’s vision of
Washington and Lee.”’ Many of
the quotes came from Jene-
vein, he said.

Chapman said the interview
evolved into ‘‘polite debate,
that sometimes wasn’t so
polite,’ both between the
students and Ms. Birnbach and

among the students.

Cronin concluded that the ar-
ticle is neither fair nor ac-
curate:

“I think she presented a
slanted view, and hence a view
that was not accurate and it’s
too bad that there are people
who are going to read this and
come away with a precon-
ceived notion about a Washing-
ton and Lee that doesn’t exist

The Student Bar Association
will keep 83 percent of Law
School student taxes this year,
representatives of the Executive
Committee and the SBA decided
Thursday.

SBA President John Sicilian
said he thinks 83 percent is a
good figure. He added that the
difference between 80 percent
and 83 percent is about $400 or
$500, which he called a sum not
worth arguing about.

“With the $5 (student tax) in-
crease, I think we can make it on
that,” Sicilian said.

EC Vice President James
White, chairman of the EC’s
finance subcommittee, said SBA
representatives were unsure
whether 80 percent would be a
sufficient figure. He had said
before the meeting that he ex-
pected this year’s percentage to
be between 80 and 82 percent.

White noted that the EC re-
serve fund is available if the
SBA needs more money. ‘‘They
can still come back at the end of
the year if that 83 percent
doesn’t cut it,’’ he said.

If 83 percent is sufficient this
year, Sicilian said the SBA will
ask the EC to pass a resolution
keeping the same percentage

SBA, EC agree
on tax percentage

each year.

“It’s silly to start every year
fighting about it,” he said. ‘‘It’s
not that much money.”

White said Sicilian and the
other SBA officers have been
‘“‘very cooperative” throughout
the negotiating process.

“I think they’ll (SBA) be hap-
py with it and I know they’ll be
glad to govern their own funds,”
White said. ‘‘I think it’s going to
be a whole lot easier this way.”’

This year marks the first time
that the SBA has been autono-
mous from the EC. In past years
the EC has allocated funds to the
SBA as if it were a student
organization rather than as a
student government.

Based on the total of 367 law
students who matriculated, the
total amount of law school taxes
will be $27,525, 83 percent of
which is $22,845.75. That means
$4,679.25 of law student taxes
will go to the EC this year.

Law students pay a $120 stu-
dent activities fee; $25 goes
directly to funding the building
of the student activities pavilion
and $20 goes directly to the SBA.
Undergraduates pay $100 in ac-
tivity fees, $25 of which goes to
the pavilion.

Sicilian said the SBA will
begin approving requests for
funds from law school organiza-
tions within the next two weeks.

 

White Book in error?

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

Confusion over a sentence in
the White Book arose in the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting
Monday night, when represen-
tatives Bob Tomaso and Andrew
Caruthers announced that there
is a change in this year’s White
Book that was not approved by
the EC last year.

The sentence says that a stu-
dent who is found guilty in either
a closed hearing or in an appeal
in an open hearing will have the
phrase ‘‘not in good standing’
stamped on his official tran-
script when he is expelled.

“The only way that should be
in there,”’ Caruthers said, ‘‘is if
we voted on it. In a sense, that
amendment is not really approv-
ed.”’

After a moment of confusion,
EC President Cole Dawson ex-
plained that he added the sen-
tence himself after a conversa-
tion with University Registrar
Harold Head.

“T talked to Col. Head, and he
said it should say ‘expelled’

Dawson explained, adding that
he wasn’t sure it was in the EC’s
power to make decisions about
what a student’s transcript says.

“It was not passed last year,”
Dawson said, ‘‘but I added it
when I sent (the White Book) to
(EC Secretary) Sam (Dalton) to
be typed up.”

Last year’s EC approved ad-
ding the bdd-standing clause on-
ly for students who appealed a
closed-hearing guilty verdict
and were then found guilty in the
open hearing.

This would deter a student who
knew he was guilty from appeal-
ing, Caruthers said last night.

“The way it’s in there now,
there is no deterrence to appeal-

ing,’’ Caruthers. said.
“Everybody’s going to go to the
open trial.”

Last year three of the four
students who appealed their
closed-hearing verdicts were
found innocent in the open trial.

Caruthers made a motion to
strike the sentence from the
White Book ‘“‘pending the EC’s
decision in two weeks.’’ The mo-
tion passed unanimously.

The Student Association for
Black Unity will not request any
funds from the Executive Com-
mittee this year, SABU Presi-
dent Bryan Johnson said Tues-
day.

Neither Johnson nor Director
of Minority Affairs John L.
White had any comment as to
where SABU’s funds for this
year would come from.

EC Secretary Sam Dalton said
that he thought one of the
reasons SABU didn’t request
money might be that the group
thought it had been treated poor-
ly in the budgeting process in
previous years. Last year SABU
requested $5,100 but received on-
ly $1,500 from the EC.

Dalton said that when he talk-
ed to SABU Vice President Kim

Puleo, who did not return to
W&L this term.

Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Monday in the quads of
Graham-Lees and Davis dormi-
tories for freshman elections
and at the law school for law
elections.

Candidates are limited to ten
812-inch-by-11-inch posters and
one banner of any size. There is
a limit of $10 per person on cam-
paign expenditures.

didates are Andrew Abernathy,

SABU won’t request

Brunson about why the group did
not submit a budget request
Monday night, Brunson said, ‘“‘I
don’t think we’re going to ask for
any funds from the EC this

Last year SABU held its an-
nual ball at a cost of over $10,000
and at an estimated loss of over
$5,000.

Then-President Ron Magee
said after the ball that he
thought SABU’s budget was in
the red.

“We took a beating and it will
have repercussions on our future

activities,” Magee said at the
time.

In other budgetary action, the
EC has $100,950 to dole out to stu-
dent organizations. Budget re-
quests totalling $111,537.90 have
been made by 15 organizations.
The Student Activities Board
made the largest request, asking
for $53,250.

New dormitory being planned for 1987-88

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Planning is underway for the
addition of a new dormitory for
Washington and Lee, with com-
pletion of the facility scheduled
for the fall of 1987.

The residential study commit-
tee will be chaired by Frank
Parsons, assistant to the univer-
sity president, and will report to
the new Coeducation Steering
Committee.

“We want to come up with
solutions that meet the greatest
need,”’ Parsons said. ‘‘Any deci-
sion we make will be subject to
criticism from one group or
another. We’ve got a real task
before us.”

Parsons estimated that with
the planning time and an 18-
month construction period the
most likely date for the opening
of a new dormitory would be
September 1987.

“It’s conceivable if everything
falls into place we could have
housing in place by 1986,” he
said. “I think that would be
rushing things unnecessarily.
Unless there is a compelling
reason why we should make a
crash study, we’ll go with ’87-
88.”’

Parsons added that he still
needs to clarify some of the
guidelines of the project with,
Associate Dean of the College,
Pamela Simpson and President
John D. Wilson, and the commit-
tee’s decisions would be review-

ed by committees of the Board of
Trustees.

Parsons said it was premature
to speculate what form the new
housing would take.

“We have to create housing
that is attractive, functional and
that students will want to rent,”’
noted Parsons.

Parsons did discuss some of
the options and issues that the
committee might consider while
planning for the additional hous-
ing.

Parsons said the university
has several locations available
for new housing. One possible
site is on a tract of university-
owned land west of U.S. 60 near
the old railroad station. Other
possibilities are to extend the
Woods Creek housing to the
other side of the footbridge or to
add another wing to Graham-
Lees Dormitory in order to com-
pletely enclose the freshman
quad, Parsons added.

“At the moment there isn’t
any clear direction as to the kind
of housing or the number of beds

we would provide,’ said Par- .

sons.

Parsons said the committee
could decide to make the new
housing a traditional-style dor-
mitory or something similar to
the Woods Creek Apartments, or
a style somewhere between
those two.

One popular trend in dormi-
tory housing, according to Par-
sons, is ‘‘living and learning.”
This type of dormitory is ‘‘more
than just a place to sleep and

study,’’ Parsons said. Lounges,
a browsing library, seminar
rooms for classes and other
‘“‘commons’’ areas are often in-
cluded in ‘‘living and learning”
dormitories, added Parsons.

Parsons said he feels the
university as a whole needs an
improved ‘‘commons’’ area
where students can congregate.
The main commons area on the
campus now is the Co-op, which
frequently is overcrowded, Par-
sons said.

Regardless of what form the
additional housing takes, both
freshmen and upperclassmen
will be able to live in it, Parsons
said. Although the building of the
Woods Creek Apartments
several years ago temporarily
alleviated student demand for
on-campus housing, the increase
in the size of the Law School once

again has resulted in a housing
shortage, Parsons said.

“T really think that there ought
to be more opportunity to live on
campus,’’ he added.

Whether the dormitory will be
single-sex, coed with men and
women on separate floors or co-
ed with men and women in dif-
ferent rooms on the same floor
will be considered by the com-
mittee.

“One of the simplest options
Would be to designate one dorm
over there as the women’s
dorm,” said Parsons.

“The women might not like
that. I think we might find
quicker dissatisfaction with just
a women’s dorm. We would go
that way if the entering women
expressed a preference for
that,”’ remarked Parsons.

Parsons conducted a survey of

W&L men’s opinions regarding
single sex and coed dormitories
during matriculation, but the
results have not been tabulated.

The committee would also
have to consider what additional
security measures would be
needed to protect women in the
dormitories from intruders.

“We've learned a lot from our
female law students,” Parsons
said.

Parsons explained that when
women first entered the Law
School they pointed out that the
walk across the footbridge was
unlighted and dangerous. In
response, the University added a
number of lights along the sides
of the bridge, Parsons said.

The University also will try to
improve the lighting in some of
the darker areas of the campus
before next year, Parsons said.

Wilson names Dean Simpson

dean of the College at Washing-
ton and Lee, has been appointed

In his charge to the commit-
tee, Wilson said the group’s
main work ‘‘will be to ensure the
happy and successful induction
of young women into our col-
legiate life by anticipating new
opportunities we should seize
upon and potential problems we
should avoid if we can.”’

He added that the committee
will be encouraged ‘‘to use the
experience of other institutions
of our size and character which
have undertaken — similar
changes.”’

Ms. Simpson said that the
committee met last Thursday
and plans to meet weekly.

She said the committee talked
about Wilson’s memo that outlin-
ed what its agenda should be and
provided a series of planning
assumptions within which it will
work.

Those assumptions include a
10-year initial planning period
during which the size of the
undergraduate student body will
increase to about 1,500 students
— 1,000 men and 500 women.

Ms. Simpson said the commit-
tee will meet today with the ad-
missions office to begin studying
admissions policies and pro-
cedures.

In his memo to the committee,
Wilson noted that the committee
should anticipate the need to in-
crease the residential capacity
but should not adopt a policy that
mandates on-campus residence
beyond the freshman year.

Further, the president made
specific reference to adopting a
strong program of athletics for
women “‘to parallel, in appropri-
iate ways, our program for

men.” He added that continuing |

efforts to address ways of br-
inging improvements to the
fraternity system will be
especially important during the
transition.

Among specific subjects that
the committee will address are
admissions policies and pro-
cedures, residential accommo-
dations, university health and
counseling services, athletic
program development, dining
hall operations, student organi-
zation, faculty and staff appoint-
ments, campus security and
campus renovations.

The Coeducation Steering
Committee’s reports on specific
topics will be directed to the ap-
propriate standing committee of
the W&L Board of Trustees for
appropriate action.

Simpson has been a member
of the Washington and Lee facul-
ty since 1973. A graduate of Get-
tysburg College, she received
her master’s degree in art
history from the University of
Missouri and her Ph.D. in art
history from the University of
Delaware.

She was named assistant dean
of the College in 1981 and was
elevated to associate dean in
1983. In addition to her ad-
ministrative duties, Simpson
continues to teach courses in art
history.

A “termless” academic calen-
dar of five six-week units enabl-
ing professors to schedule com-
binations of courses varying
from three to 18 weeks in length
has been proposed by a Washing-
ton and Lee psychology pro-
fessor.

felony arson counts in connec-
tion with several small, early-
morning fires at the dormitory
in which he was living at
Fairleigh Dickinson University
in Teaneck, N.J.

As a result of a plea agree-
ment, Mesner on May 15 pleaded
guilty in Bergen County
Municipal Court to one misde-
meanor count of criminal
mischief, according to testimony
yesterday.

Teaneck Police Chief Bryan
Burke said Mesner was given a
30-day suspended jail sentence
and fined $1,000. Through an in-
terstate agreement, Mesner has
been allowed to report to a
Roanoke probation officer. He
was living with his parents on
the Hollins campus at the time of
his arrest on the Lexington
charges.

Mesner’s father, 39-year-old
Thomas H. Mesner, testified
that if the $150,000 bail were
reduced and his son were releas-
ed, Scot would immediately
begin taking 15 credit hours of
classes' at Virginia Western
Community College in Roanoke.

“We have managed to scrape
together right at $50,000 through
savings and through loans,” said
Mesner, a reference librarian
and history instructor at Hollins.

Mesner, who has round spec-
tacles, a receding hairline and a
diminutive appearance, said ‘‘it
hasn’t been easy for us, going to
the family to ask for money.’’ He
said his parents had been ‘“‘very
generous” in loaning money for
the bond.

The father said that in October
he went to New Jersey to pick up
his son following his arrest on
the arson charges, but that they
had not talked about the allega-
tions.

“We went to see a counselor
about it, and the counselor said
that it was best that we not
discuss it with him and just
move on from there,” he
testified. ‘‘We encouraged him
to seek work, and went on from
there.”’

The elder Mesner confirmed
by telephone that Kaye Lynn
Mesner was his first wife and
Scot’s mother. She was shot to
death on Jan. 10, 1976, in lowa Ci-
ty, Iowa, and Michael Dean
Remmers was later convicted of
premeditated murder in the
case, according to Johnson
County public records.

 

crazy?” are the two responses
professor David G. Elmes said
he has received from faculty
members and administrators
who have seen his idea.

According to Professor John
H. Wise, chairman of the ad hoc
calendar committee, Elmes’ al-
ternative calendar was present-
ed too late for his committee to
consider completely, but was
presented with his committee’s
report to the faculty Executive
Committee Monday.

Mesner’s stepmother, Jeanne
Larsen, an assistant professor of
English at Hollins who has been
married to Mesner’s father for
seven years, said that ‘“‘his
mother is deceased and I’ve
been his full-time mother.”’

Read asked her about the
closeness of her relationship
with Mesner. ‘‘Extremely
close?’’ she asked, smiling and
tossing her head. ‘‘As closely as
suits a 19-year-old....I1 was not
aware of where he was at every
moment.”

On April 13, Mesner was serv-
ed with a “no trespassing”’
notice from the Hollins security
force ‘‘directing him not to place
foot on the Hollins College cam-
pus”~ except for his parents’
house, according to testimony
yesterday.

Arthur Hafdelin, Mesner’s
Roanoke probation officer, said
the order was issued by Hollins
College because ‘‘there’d been
some problems with some coeds
that apparently he had threaten-
ed in some way.”’

“T didn’t ask him why he was
served with that,’’ Ms. Larsen
said. “I felt that was between
Scot and the people at Hollins....I
have some hearsay knowledge,
but I never asked him about
that.”

“Hearsay knowledge?” ex-
claimed Read, addressing the
judge. ‘How in the world can she
come in here and say she proper-
ly supervised her son if she
doesn’t know anything about
him?”’

Robert Lynn, a_ substance
abuse counselor at the South-
west Virginia Treatment Center
in Roanoke, said he treated
Mesner beginning at the end of
May because “he was addicted
to drugs and alcohol.”

Hafdelin testified that if
Mesner were released on bond,
“T would be concerned about the
threat that he could set more
fires....1 have no personal pro-
blems with Scot, but he has a
problem with pyromania and ar-
son.”’

In a statement Mesner made
to New Jersey police on Oct. 22
which was entered as evidence
at the hearing, he admitted that
he had set the dormitory fires
“using a cigarette lighter’’ in
order ‘‘to raise hell and to strike
back, but at what, I don’t know.”

In the remarks to police,
Mesner said that when he was
young he had set a fire on a
metal bridge in Iowa City, Iowa.

“I did not get get along well
with my stepmother, and in
general just disobeyed the fami-

Elmes’ proposal rests upon
five premises: a typical student
will average 10 courses (30 cred-
its) per year; a school year of
more than two terms is desir-
able; the 12-124 calendar is in-
flexible because special courses
and programs are limited to the
spring term and_ unlinked
courses are limited to a duration
of six or 12 weeks; courses differ
in the length required for ade-
quate coverage; and a shortened
Christmas vacation is not de-

ly rules,’ he told police.
“Recently I have felt rather
depressed and oppressed. I am
not sure what I am feeling.’’

Mundy argued that the
Teaneck conviction should not
be a factor in determining bail in
the Lexington case.

“The events that caused his
charge to be reduced from a
felony to a misdemeanor are
something that I’m sure the peo-
ple in New Jersey regret,’’ Read
said. ‘This young man obviously
has a problem with pyromania
and with arson.”

“That’s inflammatory, your
honor,’’ Mundy said, as a wave
of laughter at the unintended
un swept the courtroom.

The Ring-tum Phi, September 20, 1984, Page 7

Proposed ‘termless’ calendar called flexible

sirable.

The proposal calls for an
academic year broken up into
five six-week units, each sep-
arated by at least one week. Ex-
aminations, grading and vaca-
tions would occur during this
week.

Courses could last three, six,
nine, 12, 15, or 18 weeks, accor-
ding to the professors’ desires,
explained Elmes. “In this kind
of scheme, terms have no mean-
ing,” he said.

“It seems to me the program
... We’re in right now is some-
what inflexible. If you want a
one-shot course, you’ve got some
problems,”’ said Elmes, explain-
ing why he designed this pro-
posal. Specific benefits of the
alternative calendar, according
to Elmes, include flexibility of
scheduling for both students and
faculty, and access to internship
programs throughout the year.

“The faculty should be able to
tailor their courses and teaching
load to their own needs and de-
sires,” wrote Elmes in his ex-
planation of the calendar.

Elmes believes that his calen-

dar would benefit weaker stu-
dents who could take a lighter

course load when they had one
difficult or time-consuming
course. The calendar would be-
gin and end “‘at times more con-
gruent with other schools in our
area ... “‘ wrote Elmes in the
proposal.

This calendar would necessi-
tate students’ planning an entire
year’s course load at one time.
“Under a system like this, I’d
think you’d have to,” Elmes
said.

If Elmes’ proposal were ap-
proved, several months of study
would be required, according to
Wise. ‘‘The ball would be back in
their (the calendar commit-
tee’s) court,’’ Elmes said.

Terming his calendar ‘‘a
could-be administrative night-
mare,” Elmes said he has not
tried to solve all of the potential
administrative problems.

“If people thought this had
enough advantages . . . it would
take some time,’’ Elmes said. ‘‘I
want people to think about it.
One of the purposes is getting
people to think about it. One of
the purposes is getting people to
think of alternative ways to set
up the calendar.”’

Cockpit
to rock
Fridays

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Cockpit and WLUR will
embark on a joint venture
tomorrow afternoon — Rock and
Roll Happy Hour. Beginning at 3
p.m., the campus radio station
will broadcast live from the
Cockpit for two hours in what
program director Brian Oliger
calls ‘“‘a great way to unwind for
the weekend.”’

Oliger said the idea of running
a radio show from the Cockpit
came from journalism Professor
Robert J. deMaria and Cockpit
manager Mike Jacoby.

Since this is the first attempt
at broadcasting from the student
bar, planners say all the bugs
have not yet been worked out of
the system.

Take for example, the on-air
talent. Friday’s show will be co-
hosted by Bob Halloran and Cot-
ton Puryear. ‘The thing is,
we’re all pretty clueless,’’ said
Puryear, who will open the show
at3.

“I’m going to walk in there
Friday with a MARTI (remote
transmitter) and a tune list and
wing it.”

Halloran, who is scheduled to

’ be in class at airtime, will join

him later.

Don’t expect to walk into the
Cockpit tomorrow afternoon and
see stacks of records, turntables
and ‘‘cart’’ machines, either. All
the music will be broadcast from
the WLUR studio in Reid Hall,
via the magic of Marconi, with a
little help from a station engi-
neer.

Future plans for the Happy
Hour, which will air every Fri-
day afternoon, include guest
DJ’s from the radio stations at
Sweet Briar and Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College.

Since the purpose of the show
is to broadcast in front of a
crowd, Cockpit patrons will have
an opportunity to be heard on the
radio. Puryear said that he and
Halloran plan to do live inter-
views during the show.

Independent Union
requests EC funds

By ROBERT DORAIS
Staff Reporter

 

The Independent Union, which
was denied funds by the Ex-
ecutive Committee last year,
has requested $1,200 in student
taxes this year in order to ex-
pand its social calendar, chair-
man Chuck Diffenderffer said
this week.

Diffenderffer said the In-
dependent Union plans to sell
permanent memberships that
would admit a student and his
date to IU parties free of charge
this year.

The EC cited the IU’s failure
to charge any kind of dues when
it rejected the IU’s budget re-
quest last year.

Diffenderffer said he hopes the

IU can raise $1,000 from both in-
dividual ticket sales and dues
payments.

The IU’s budget calls for $1,600
to be spent for bands either in
the Cockpit or the new Pavilion,
scheduled to open Oct. 12. Dif-
fenderffer said he would like to
have another ‘‘Saturday Night in
the Pit,” which the IU co-
sponsored with the Student Ac-
tivities Board on Fancy Dress
weekend last year.

The Independent Union offers
students ‘‘the services of a
fraternity without the obliga-
tions” of time and money, Dif-
fenderffer said.

In addition, the IU plans to
organize intramural teams.
Students may sign up at an
organizational meeting Sept. 26
to play intramural tennis and
golf. Independents interested in
playing intramural football
should contact Diffenderffer at
463-3130 by Saturday.

About 50 students attended the
first meeting last year, but at-
tendance dipped after that, Dif-
fenderffer said, because ‘‘it was
really all upin the air.”’

The Independent Union has a
permanent office, Room 205 of
the Student Center, this year,
and both Dean of Students Lewis
G. John and Associate Dean of
Students Michael Cappeto will
serve as advisers.

Another service the IU plans
to offer this year is a cold test
file that students can use either
by paying a fee or by con-
tributing one of their cold tests.
The file will be in the IU’s office.

University Center secretary Carole Chappell tries her phone.

Teaching the teachers

Anyone who’s grappled with
the new university telephone
system knows that when all else
fails (hardly unlikely), you don’t
read the directions. That would
just make it worse.

Instead you talk to Arlene
Black, a Rolm Corp. com-
munications system designer,
who spent two weeks here last
month answering questions
about bugs that professors and
other university staffers had en-
countered in their initial weeks
with their new phones.

Each day she taught several
sessions of 20 people each in a
Commerce School conference
room.

Ms. Black, who did much of
the training when the University
of Virginia installed a similar
system, treats with great humor
the irony of instructing acade-
mics in the seemingly simple
skill of using their desk phones.

“They’ve been very respon-
sive and say ‘Hey, wow’ when
they master a new feature on the
phone,’’ said Ms. Black, who has
worked out of Rolm’s Charlot-
tesville office for three years.

“‘One man came in here saying
that no one needed to teach him
how to use a phone,”’ she recall-
ed. “I told him he was right: if
you want to make a call, you just
pick up the receiver and do it.

The same goes for answering the.

telephone.

“It’s. nothing more than a
telephone,’ I told him, but he
must have been interested in
spite of himself, because he
stayed around to listen to how to
use the other features.”’

“He was probably stewing
because he thought it was
nonsense to come and learn
about a telephone, but at the
same time he was curious
enough to stay,’’ she added.

Ms. Black said she occasional-
ly is asked about the necessity of
some of the phones’ more eso-

teric capabilities.

“You have these features to
make it easier for you to do your
work,”’ she explains patiently.
“They are shortcuts for your
convenience. You may never use
them, but you should know:
they’re there and how to work
them.”’

“Everything’s going toward
computers now, so having a
computerized phone is a big
deal,”’ she added.

She contends that showing
people repeatedly how to use
their “pick” potential’ their
‘“‘camp-on”’ capability or their
‘‘flash’’ function is not as tedious
as it might seem.

“Every group is different and
has different questions,”’ she ex-
plained. ‘You don’t get up there
and read off the instructions like
a robot.

“It takes a certain type of per-
son to train a telephone system
and have the users respond to
it.”

Ms. Black said she uses a com-
bination of slides and ‘“‘hands-
on’ training to make her
trainees comfortable with the
system.

She said she tries to maintain
an attractive yet unobtrusive ap-
pearance so that ‘‘they’re focus-
ing on their telephone and obser-
ving what the phone is like
rather than what I look like.”’

Ms. Black, who went to work
for the company after having
worked for 10 years at a law firm
which had a Rolm system, said
she plans to remain in the
customer service end of the
operation, rather than move to
sales, which is ‘‘where the
money is.”’

“On the support end, I’m doing
something for them,’’ she ex-
plained. “When I’m selling
something, I’m always asking
them to do something for me. I
prefer to be helping them.”’

ERRATIC A NARRE STAN ANE REST RHEE BIRD TIGRE
By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

Although Washington and
Lee’s new computerized tele-
phone system may be confusing,
it will make telephone use more
convenient and cost-efficient, of-
ficials say.

The University’s Central
Telephone Co. of Virginia

‘system was “approaching the

upper limits of its capacity to
serve us,”’ said Frank A. Par-
sons, assistant to the president.

The new ROLM Computerized
Branch Exchange (CBX) sy-
stem, which began service Aug.
1, has many convenience fea-
tures not available on the Centel
system.

Carole Chappell, University
Center secretary, called the
variety of new features on her
21-button telephone “‘very con-
fusing.”

“I have been cutting people
off,’’ she explained, ‘‘including
the dean of the law school at
Yale. However, if I ever figure
this thing out, it will be a fan-
tastic piece of equipment.”

The need for operator-assisted
long distance calling has been
eliminated on most of the sys-
tem’s approximately 460 push-—
button telephones, reducing the
cost of such calls by 25 to 30 per-
cent. Also, the system’s “‘least
cost routing” capability insures
the most economical long dis-
tance rates.

For example, the Washington
and Lee campus is now connect-
ed to the city of Roanoke through
a trunk line installed this sum-
mer. The cost to the University
for leasing this trunk line is
‘“‘very expensive,” said Parsons,
but he added that the normal
cost of long distance calls to that
area would greatly exceed the
leasing price.

University operator Agnes
Gilmore called the system ‘‘cer-
tainly more economical’ since
the W&L community makes
‘tremendous amounts of long
distance calls.”

Parsons anticipates that the
$450,000 system will pay for itself
over a three- or four-year period.

The phones on campus are one
of the three models: the 120, 240
or 400. The 400 model is the most
exclusive, and the University
purchased only five, two of
which are in the president’s of-
fice. Each professor and most
clerical and secretarial workers
use the 120 model, while many
administration officials use the
240 model.

Although the software quality
of the CBX system allows flexi-
ble growth for changing needs,
features now available include
automatic callback, call for-
warding to other extensions and
transferring and reconnecting
capabilities.

In addition, incoming calls
may be transferred automatical-
ly to the different phones in what
is known as a “‘hunt”’ group. For

i = erat

The Ring-tum Phi, September 20, 1984, Page 9

W&L’s new phones: convenient,
cost-efficient and confusing

example, if Laura deMaria of
the Summer Programs office is
unavailable to answer her
phone, the caller will auto-
matically be transferred after
four rings to the office of Robert
Fure, director of Summer Pro-
grams.

Another “‘marvelous”’ feature,
according to Parsons, is system
speed. In the computer’s memo-
ry have been stored 230 long
distance numbers. System speed
allows the user to connect with
those numbers by pushing only
four numbers instead of 12.

Among the numbers included
are those of board members,
local emergency groups, banks
and investment agencies, news
media, printers, suppliers and
libraries, as well as those of
other schools.

Station speed is a similar
feature, except the numbers are
more personal and are asso-
ciated with individual telephone
extensions.

Because each phone now can
be reached by dialing direct, of-
fice extensions are accessible
even when the central switch-
board is not manned.

Mrs. Gilmore noted that a pro-
blem in past years occurred dur-
ing summers, when the switch-
board closed at 5 p.m. and cut off
all outside calls, excluding calls
for administration officials
whose phones were already ac-
cessible through direct dialing.

Parsons said that in planning
the new system, consideration
was given to the ‘‘possibility and
probability that all professors
will want to have a personal
computer” within the next few
years.

Before next summer, the
University will acquire data
modules which will make it
possible to send computer data
transmissions over the existing
telephone lines. This equipment
will be connected to the CBX

system, which already is housed
in the basement of Graham-Lees
Dormitory.

Parsons, who was involved
eight years ago in the selection
of the Centel system, pointed out
that the breakup last January of
AT&T prompted the decision to
investigate new systems.

Since 1976, Washington and
Lee had paid a monthly tariff to
Centel for the use of the old
system. When AT&T was forced
to break up,local offices were
given more freedom. Centel sub-
sequently offered W&L_ the
chance to buy the system it had
been leasing for eight years,

The University instead hired
the Communications Consul-
tants Corp. of Virginia to
analyze its position.

The ROLM Corp. offered the
best technology and in the end
was ‘‘able to meet our specifica-
tions at the lowest cost,” Par-
sons said.

In July, ROLM surveys were
conducted to meet the needs of
individual offices. ‘‘We’ve tried
to give people the phones they
need at the minimum cost,” ex-
plained Parsons, who added that
acquisitions for higher standard
telephone models will be con-
sidered later.

Parsons recognized ‘‘some el-
ement of dissatisfaction (with
the new system) since some of-
fices operated around the old
system.’’ He said he also
realizes that ‘low-level _ in-
timidation” has been generated.

Since the faculty and office
numbers are not yet available to
the public, the University
switchboard still must handle
many incoming calls.

Switchboard operators have
noticed, however, a reduction in
the number of personal phone
calls, and one student worker,
John Janner, remarked that
“people are pleased to bypass
the switehboard.”’

Polo ties
Hopkins
in Classic

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

’’That one goal could make the
difference in our whole season,”’
said head water polo coach Page
Remillard, referring to Kevin
Lederer’s last-second game-
tying goal against Johns
Hopkins that allowed the Gen-
erals to finish among the top four
teams instead of the bottom
four. The Generals placed fourth
in a field of eight teams in the
W&L Fall Classic last weekend.
Johns Hopkins and W&L won
two games and lost two.

Navy won the tournament with
a perfect 5-0 record. The Univer-
sity of Arkansas/Little Rock
finished second.

If the Generals had lost to
Johns Hopkins, they would have
had to play Duke. Remillard did
not want his team to play Duke
this weekend. Because Duke is
in Generals’ conference, Remi-
llard prefers to play them after
his team has had time to im-
prove.

In their final game of the
weekend, the Generals defeated
Dayton 12-11 when Bobby Pear-
son scored on a penalty shot late
in the game.

Dayton had previously won its
game against Arkansas, who
crushed the Generals in the se-
cond game of the tournament. “I
thought that said a whole lot
about how much we improved
over the whole weekend,’’ said
Remillard.

Remillard added, ‘‘Our
freshmen were making mistakes
against Arkansas that they did
not make against Dayton.”

Coach Remillard also noted
that his team’s performance was
not a fluke because the entire
team played well. He stated that
if only one of his players had
played well then one might con-
sider the Dayton game a fluke.

W&L’s Eric Sullivan (6) winds up and fires a shot in the
Generals’ crucial 13-13 tie against Johns Hopkins. W&L. finished
fourth in the eight-team event, earning victories over VCU and

Dayton.

Despite the Generals’ victory
against Dayton, W&L finished
fourth because the total goal dif-
ferential for the tournament
went in Dayton’s favor.

Before losing to Arkansas in
their second game, the Generals
defeated Virginia Common-
wealth, 20-5.

Tim Stanford scored 12 goals
to lead the Generals last week-
end. Stanford, however, had
trouble with personal fouls, ac-
cording to Coach Remillard, and
fouled out of the Dayton game.
Remillard said, “It (foul trou-
ble) is nothing that he can’t get
under control and I am sure that
he will get it under control.”

Remillard also noted that
sophomore Kevin Lederer
“looks very sharp.”’

Prior to last weekend only two
of Remillard’s 21 players had
varsity experience. Remillard
took advantage of last weekend
to give experience to his players.

During practice this week, the
Generals will concentrate on

ball handling and goal keeping,
Remillard said.

“We are still waiting for an
average game from. our
goalies,” said Remillard. He ad-
ded, ‘‘If our goalies come around
like they are capable of, we are
going to be a typical W&L team
and a very strong contender for
the conference crown.”

The Generals will travel to An-
napolis, Md., this weekend to
play in the Southeast Varsity In-
vitational. The top four teams on
the East Coast are also playing
in the tournament. Brown (1),
Slippery Rock (2), Bucknell (3)
and Navy (4) are also ranked
among the top 20 teams in the
country in NCAA Division I.

Despite having many inex-
perienced players on his team,
Remillard believes his team has
a positive attitude about facing
the tough competition this
weekend. “The players want to
play these big teams and test
their individual skills,’ said
Remillard.

Remillard stated that if his
team improved as much as they
did last weekend then his
players will have made a lot of
progress.

Remillard concluded, ‘‘We
could go 0-4 this weekend and
come away having made pro-
gress.”’

Generals stung
by Wasps, 28-0

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Emory and Henry Wasps
used a four-touchdown blitz in
the second half to defeat
Washington and Lee 28-0 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference football opener for both
teams.

E&H (2-0) was its own worst
enemy in the first half, commit-
ting four turnovers. However,
W&L (1-1) was unable to
capitalize on the Wasps’
mistakes, and the two teams
entered the locker room tied 0-0
at halftime.

In the third quarter, E&H
third-team quarterback Sam
Blevins ignited his team’s of-
fense, leading it to two third-
quarter touchdowns and a 14-0
lead.

The Wasps added two in-
surance scores in the fourth
quarter, making the final score
28-0.

Blevins clearly was the key to
E&H’s second-half resurgence.

He completed 10 passes in 15 at-
tempts for 125 yards and one
touchdown and rushed for two
more scores.

W&L was unable to move the
ball consistently against the
stubborn E&H defense. The

Generals totalled only 115 yards
offense in the game.

Quarterback Bobby Wilson,
under heavy pressure from the
Wasp defensive line, completed

_ four of his 17 tosses for 59 yards.

On the day, W&L runners rushed
for 132 yards but had only 54
yards net rushing due to 78 yards
suffered in losses.

Fullback Frank Surface led
the Generals on offense with 41
yards rushing on 14 carries and
three receptions for 39 yards.

Free safety Chris Wilson head-
ed the General’s defense with
two interceptions to go with his
five tackles and seven assists.
Linebacker Kurt Specht added
three tackles and seven assists.

W&L head Coach Gary Fallon
said he was not pleased with his

' that the college
game has be-
come a bit too

teins A .J big bucksy for
its own epee Charley Pell and
the Gator scandal has reached a-
head with the former’s dismissal
and the latter’s Seing indicted by
the NCAA on 107 recruiting vio-
lations. George Vecsey of the
New York Times pointed out in
his space on Sunday that the
great problem in college may lie
not only with the college coaches
but also with that maniacal
species known as the ‘“‘booster.”’
Vecsey wisely calls these beings
“‘who believe their school should
be No. 1...as big a blight, in their
own way, as the people who push
drugs (on athletes).’”’ True’ and
what’s more, Mr. Vecsey, the

 

 

 

drug problem perhaps can be
combatted (as is presently being
done by 30 major college pro-
grams, where drug testing has
been implemented), but the pro-
blem with the booster is as old as
the game itself and all the indict-
ments, no matter how numerous
or flagrant the violations, will
not dissuade Richie Rich, sports
hungry alumnus from East Po-
dunk Tech, from shelling out a
few monetary favors to ensure
that the Techies have another-
winning season. No, the problem
does not lie with the booster — he
is an animal beyond control.
(Indeed, we could all be alumni
someday and heretofore the po-
tential to be boosters looms
large.) Rather, as Vecsey slam
dances on the issue, the problem
lies with “coaches who teach
young people that breaking the
rules is justifiable as long as the
good guys win.” The notion of
athletic competition has been
forgotten with the tendency to-
ward bigger and bigger price
tags in college sports. Season
tickets no longer go to those who
simply want to root for the home
team and pay the listed price.

Cross country team
is faster, confident

A eT
By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

This Saturday the Washington
and Lee cross country team will
open its 1984 season at Mary
Washington College where they
run against the Scots and Wash-
ington College.

Tosay the team is enthusiastic
would be an understatement.
“After Saturday we will be 2-0,”
commented team co-captain
Frank Pittman.

“We're not trying to sound
cocky,’’ said sophomore David
Andrews, “But this is a tighter
and faster team than we had last
year.”’ The time trials from last
Saturday prove Andrews to be
correct. About three minutes
separates junior Eddy Goundry,
the number one runner, and the
number 12 runner. This is ahead
of last year’s pace, Coach Dick

Miller said.

Behind Goundry is a veteran
group of upperclassmen includ-
ing senior captains Pittman and
Mark Pembroke.

The team had two major
losses from last year’s roster,
captain Angus McBryde, an All-
American, and Paul Chapman.

But the team did pick up Con-
rad Boyle, Kevin Kelley and
Gordon Ogden from the track
team as well as eight freshmen.
Of those freshmen, several are
in the team’s top 12. Because of
the new faces the team seems to
have more depth.

Coach Miller refused to make
any predictions for the season,
but Pittman said, ‘‘We will win
the conference and go to nation-
al, and that’s no goal or ambi-
tion, it’s a legitimate estima-
tion.”

Soccer throttled

ByWILLIAMHANNA

Special to the Phi

 

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team opened its 1984 season
with two losses at the Emory
University Invitational Tourna-
ment last weekend. The generals
were beaten by Emory 6-1 on
Friday and lost again to Georgia
State on Saturday by a score of
10-0.

Head coach Rolf Piranian said
he is not going to focus on any
one aspect of the Generals’ play

in preparation for Saturday’s
home opener against Averett.

Piranian said, ‘Obviously,
when you give up 16 goals, you
have to focus on defense, but,
then again, we only scored one
goal and we'll be working on that
as well.”

If last weekend’s games, Pira-
nian said, ‘We are disappointed,
but still optimistic. We will be a
different looking team Saturday
than we were last weekend.”

Game time for Saturday’s
matchis 2 p.m.

No, oftentimes in today’s big
money college game, you’ll get
your requested season ticket on-
ly by throwing in an excessive
and mandatory ‘‘donation” in
addition to the exorbitant ticket
prices. So what, you say. Hap-
pens all the time. Yes, and so it
does. My gripe is not with some-
one specific, not the players, the
coaches or even the boosters.
They are already diseased. My
complaint is with the whole col-
lege system. It’s reached a point

_ where wins and losses are view-

ed in terms of dollars and cents
rather than in terms of lessons
learned and _ characters
strengthened- I’m proud to say
that W&L had enough foresight
to get out of the rat race over 30
years ago. We can only wonder
why the rest of the college world
didn’t see the same light...

.... Returning to athletic decen-
cy and the Colonnade, I haven’t
much to say. The W&L harriers
begin their title quest this
weekend and this group looks
very strong. (Hint: very strong
means ‘‘will go a long way.’’)

Minorities

seefl aS

extraneous to Rush

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Imagine yourself as Kent Dorfman in
‘Animal House,’ being introduced by
the house jock to Abdul, Mohammed and
the other misfits struggling through
Rush. If you’re a black at Washington
and Lee and went through Rush, you
may know the feeling well.

Norman Sigler, a freshman from
Alabama, was one of only three blacks
to go through Rush this year. He didn’t
seem to be bothered by the almost total-
ly white freshman class because he was
the first black to graduate from his high
school. When asked why he decided to go
through Rush, Sigler said he ‘‘just
wanted a chance to meet people and
hopefully get a bid in a fraternity.”

Often he said he got the impression
that fraternity members were just try-
ing to be nice. ‘‘Some houses were fairly
shocked by my walking in, while others
came right up and talked to me,” he
said.

David Perdue, president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, said the group en-
courages everyone to go through Rush.
When questioned about blacks and fra-
ternities, Perdue responded that ‘‘we
handle that whole question with a lais-
sez-faire approach.’’ He said he hoped
fraternities would look at every fresh-
man going through with an open mind
and trying not to be biased. ‘‘We are not
in a position to tell a fraternity whether
they have to let in minorities or not,’’ he
added. ‘‘It’s a question that is up to the
individual house.”

As the only black member of a frater-
nity at W&L, sophomore Everett Hami-
lton of Sigma Nu can look at Rush as a
member, as a minority and as a past
freshman. Hamilton agreed with Sigler
that he was treated cordially by the
fraternities but said he also got the im-
pression the fraternities for the most
part didn’t know what to do with him. He
added that ‘‘as a minority student there
are certain realities you must face.
Some fraternities just won’t let blacks
in.”

When black students in a ‘‘Southern
school’ start trying to get into lily white
fraternities, visions of Black Panther
movements, sit-ins and race riots of the
60s come to the minds of the more
conservative elements of the school. Yet
both Hamilton and Sigler said they had
no intention of trying to make any
‘statement’ or cause trouble. Their
purpose, they said, was to have a good
time and meet people.

John L. White, dean of minority af-
fairs, agrees that Rush is an important
part of ‘‘the W&L experience.”’

“One of the biggest misconceptions
among students is that we tell black
students not to go through Rush,” he
said. ‘Actually, we want all of them to
experience it.’’ He also added the Stu-
dent Association for Black Unity was not
designed to compete with the fraterni-
ties. Hamilton, as a case in point, is a
member of both.

men and presidents of the fraternities,

Violate Rush rules ?

You must be joking

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

Despite widespread conversation
about ‘‘all that dirty rushing,’ the Inter-
fraternity Council Tuesday night voted
penalties against only one house for
Rush infractions, and even that ruling is
being appealed.

Both student leaders and administra-
tion officials said this week that
widespread violation of regulations
went unreported this year because of
fraternities’ reluctance to report each
other.

House presidents say that because
houses frequently had damaging infor-
mation about each other, there emerged
a tacit agreement of silence that
prevented a public airing of interhouse
complaints.

The IFC voted a $200 fine against
Sigma Alpha Epsilon for exceeding the
two-band limit during Rush. The house
had bands on both Saturdays of Rush,
and then had a third one in the country
the second Sunday. SAE maintains that
the limit on bands applied only to Satur-
days and therefore is appealing the fine.

‘Verv few people are willing to name
names or go in front of the IFC,’’ said
Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of
students for fraternity affairs. ‘‘To say
that there are problems is not good
without a specific complaint.”

“T have heard compiaints registered,
but I think it’s important that they come
in front of the IFC,’’ he continued. ‘* You
can’t deal with general compiaints

—you need someone who will fill out an
official compiaint.”’

David Perdue, president of the IFC,
agreed with Murphy that few are willing
to “name names.”

“I didn’t expect many Rush violations
to be reported because I’ve heard people
talking, but no one has been specific and
no one has made a big deal about it,’’ he
said.

“I guess people expect some viola-
tions to take place and I guess they just
don’t want to make a big fuss,’” he add-
ed. ‘I’m aware of hearsay but nothing
worth investigating.

“T really don’t think there are that

' many violations, to tell you the truth

—just a few people stretching the gray
area.”’

Head dormitory counselor Bob Toma-
so said that ‘‘people are very hesitant
about reporting a violation. It takes
than just a trivial matter.”’

‘“T think ail the fraternities are
together on this one,” he said. ‘‘They all
hate the system as it now stands
—especially the open house signup. |
don’t attribute the fewer violations this
year to the new rules but instead to the
fact that the fraternities are sticking
together more.”

Reynoids Thompson, president of Phi
Delta Theta, was upset at the volume of
new rules.

“There were so many rules that they
were hard to keep up with,”’ he said. “‘As
far as violations go, I think there were
more misunderstood rujies than ones

Sweet Briar student killed

APPOMATTOX — One Sweet
Briar College sophomore was
killed and another was seriously
injured early Saturday morning
‘in an automobile accident that
occured while the two returned
to campus from Hampden-Syd-
ney College, authorities said

The accident occurred at 4
a.m. on U.S. 460 in Appomattox
County just outside of Spout
Spring, state police said.

The dark biue 1983 BMW was
westbound when it went off the
right shoulder of the road, hit a
guard rail, and overturned seve-
ral times, according to the police
report.

Anne Kathryn Adams, an 18-
year-old from Melbourne,

Beach, Fla., was killed after she
was thrown from the back seat
of the car. The medical exam-
iner said she died of internal in-
juries.

The driver of the car, Tracy
Anne McCoy of North Andover
Mass., was placed in the inten-
sive care unit at Lynchburg
General Hospital. Her condition
was upgraded to ‘‘satisfactory”’
yesterday.

‘Normally, we can give the
condition of the patient, but in
this case, I can’t give out any in-
formation at all,’’ said nursing
supervisor Elaine Merritt.

State police officer Daniel P.
Beamon, who is conducting a
confidential investigation of the

accident, said that ‘‘the tragedy
of itis that it’s pretty simple — it
seems they just drove off the
road.”

Sophomore Kristen Whitney,
the third person in the car, was
treated at the hospital Saturday
ind then released. She has now
gone to California.

Karen Wagner, Sweet Briar’s
assistant dean of students, said
that an organized mixer was
scheduled at Hampden-Sydnev
Friday night, but that there was
no indication whether the stu-
dents had attended it or were
simply visiting friends at the col-

lege.

Monday night the Executive
Committee refused to issue a
policy statement making it an
honor violation to use a fake
identification card to pur-
chase alcohol at the Cockpit or
at university functions.

The subject arose when
senior David Sprunt, a mem-
ber of the audience, said he
found a wailet containing a

 

fake I.D. and a real I.D. He

said he used the real [.D. to

return the wallet to its owner.
‘*T was just wondering it the
Executive Committee should
make a point of saying that us-
ing a fake 1.D....is an honor
violation,’ Sprunt said.

 

A.V. for D.? Mavee..,

‘*T think the Executive Com-
mittee frowns upon the use of
fake identification,’ EC Presi-
dent Cole Dawson said hesi-
tantly as the audience laugh-
ed. ‘“‘As for it being an honor
violation, that’s decided on the
merits of the individual case.’

Vice President James White
concurred, saying, ‘‘What we
told freshmen during orienta-
tion was that every case is in-
dividual, but in the past there
was a case where the student
was brought up for and
H.V....We’ve made a state-
ment to the freshmen already
during orientation, so I don’t
think anymore need be said.”’

Opinion

 

Bumbling balloting

‘It happens every year... .”’
Sophomore Executive Committee representative
Andrew Caruthers’ comment came during EC debate

Monday night about the most recent student body _

election — for freshman class officers.

Defeated in his quest for office, a freshman had
complained that the EC, after announcing that there
would be two polling places, had set up but one. The
EC’s response, perhaps technically correct, was that
there was a second poll at the Law School.

This, after the EC clearly had indicated — both in
words and in a list of regulations distributed to can-
didates — that two polls would be open for freshmen
to vote.

Confronted by the resignation of a Voting Regula-
tions Board chairman and a lack of people to man
those two polls, the EC (Read: One or two EC
members), though, ‘‘decided’’ to reduce the number
of freshman polls to one.

This is the second consecutive week in which the
student body has discovered an Executive Committee
decision made behind closed doors, by less than the
full committee, for the wrong reasons. Last week, we
learned that President Cole Dawson had added a
phrase to the White Book — a phrase specifically op-
posed by last year’s EC.

The voting fiasco, though, raises another, overar-
ching point. The EC has been through more VRB
chairmen (yet another resigned last week) than the
Soviet Union has premiers.

Something must be done. The job of a VRB chair-
man — convincing fellow students to spend an hour or
more watching polls and then counting the ballots—is
far from glamorous. It seems only to be a time-
consuming job for which the EC did not want to be
responsible. But that should not discount the impor-
tance of the job.

The VRB was established with good intent — to
separate the Executive Committee from the voting
process, in which it usually has an inherent interest.
However, perhaps the time has come to re-evaluate
the role of the VRB.

For once, it would be nice to have an election
without complaints, charges and recriminations.

We would rather not be in a position such as that
suggested jokingly by Caruthers Monday night:
‘Next year, let’s not have elections. Let’s just go,
‘Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.’ ”’

Calyx changes explained

To the Editors:

As editor of the 1985 Calyx, I
feel obligated to inform the stu-
dent body of some of the planned
changes to this year’s book.

First and foremost is the
change to a 12-month book in-
stead of previous years’ nine
month books. By doing this, we
will be able to cover more of the
school year than we have in the
past. Included will be an expand-
ed sports section, with spring
sports, scoreboards and rosters;
important spring events, such as
Spring Weekend and, of course,
Graduation; all events that have
not been covered by the Calyx in
recent memory. Other events
that will be covered will include
last year’s Mock Convention and
the coeducation decision. To
facilitate the inclusion of these
events, the Calyx will have to be
delivered in the fall.

Calm down, calm down now,
don’t panic. I know that this
decision may be unpopular.
After all, the Calyx has been
delivered in the spring for so
long that it has become a tradi-
tion. We all know that old tradi-
tions die hard. I believe, how-
ever, that this change is much
needed and will allow a true
YEAR-book to be made. The
Calyx should be the record of
what happens during the
academic year at Washington
and Lee, and covering only
seven or eight months of that
year is inadequate.

You may be thinking that you
won’t be able to get a copy of the
book, but let me reassure you

that you will have a better oppor-
tunity to get your book than you
have had in the past. If you are
an underclassman, you will be
able to pick your book up in the
matriculation line next year. If
you are a senior, your book will
be mailed to you directly from
the publisher at no extra cost to
you. This system guarantees
that you will have an opportunity
to get your Calyx.

I intend this year’s Calyx to be
an improvement over past
years’ books, including an ex-
panded group section, faculty
pictures by department, an in-
tramural sports page, a ‘‘Year
in the News” section, an enter-
tainment section and an expand-
ed ‘Year on Campus”’ section.
To do this we will have to
enlarge the book by 50 pages.
Another positive change that I
would like to make is the addi-
tion of more color pictures. With
the 12-month book, our color
photo deadline is pushed back
far enough that we may be able
to include color Fancy Dress pic-
tures. These two changes are
possible if the Calyx can raise
the funds needed for their im-
plementation.

Here I would like to correct
some popular misconceptions
about who receives a Calyx. You
pay for your book through the
student activities fee, which is
paid with tuition. In the matricu-
lation line you are only paying
for your picture in the book;
even if you did not get your pic-
ture in the Calyx you are still en-

Discussion
to focus on

Jraternities

To the Editors:

Are the fraternities being pro-
secuted? Is the very foundation
of fraternal life being undermin-
ed — the very life that is such an
integral part of the W&L experi-
ence? If these questions have
come into your mind in the last
several weeks and you have
some constructive criticism,
then I urge you to attend the next
EC meeting this Monday (Oct. 1)
at 7 p.m. in the EC office. The
issues to be discussed will in-
clude the present Rush system,
Wednesday night parties, the
“four party per semester’
limitation and any other fra-
ternity-related concerns. I en-
courage ail fraternity presi-
dents, SAC members and IFC
representatives to come, along
with any freshmen with impres-
sions of the recent Rush sche-
dule, and all other students, ad-
ministrative personnel and
faculty members that would like
to voice an opinion. We can form
a more constructive and realis-
tic impression of the current
situation if everyone comes with
specific thoughts in mind.

On another note, I must com-
mend the freshmen on genera-
ting so much interest in last
Monday’s election. It was great
to see such a large turnout. In
the past, less than half of the
freshmen have turned out to
vote, and I am pleased to say
that over 50 percent turned out
last Monday. It covered a fairly
even distribution among the two
dorm areas — 55 percent of
Graham-Lees voted and 42 per-
cent of the Davis/Gilliam area
voted. It shows a strong amount
of support for campus affairs.

I must, at the same time, ad-
dress a concern of mine relating
to recent campaigning practic-
es. On Monday, Sept. 17, there
were specific guidelines estab-
lished when freshmen petitions
were handed in to the EC (poster
limits, spending limits, and
poster sizes). In several cases,
abuses of these limitations
would have led to the disquali-
fication of several candidates if
they had made it into the runoff
— this would have been an unfor-
tunate result. Please pay closer
attention to these rules in the
future.

Also, there were several com-
plaints voiced that some fresh-
men did not know about the e-
lection. Let me remind all can-

didates that it is your respon-
sibility to make your consti-
tuents aware of this fact. The
Voting Regulations Board can
only do so much advertising for
elections through the EC
minutes and The Ring-tum Phi.

Congratulations to those suc-
cessful candidates and good luck
with your new responsibilities.

Executive Committee

LSAT: San

Creatures are to be introduced into the ter-
rarium at the rate of one every five
minutes. Five minutes is sufficient time for
one creature to devour another or to sting
another to death.

A Mog will eat a Nog.

A Nog will eat a Pog, and will eat a Rog
unless a Wog is present.

A Wog will eat a lone Mog, but two Mogs
together will sting a Wog to death.

Which combination of three creatures
could be introduced into the terrarium in
any order with no casualties?

For the majority of rational, clear-
thinking Americans, the response to this
problem is simple: WHO CARES?

But, unfortunately, for a large
number of Washington and Lee seniors,
the admissions office at the University
of Virginia School of Law cares very
much, as do the admissions offices at
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown,
Duke... '

And forget the Wogs, Nogs and Pogs.
No sympathy is deserved there. Rather,
save it for those poor innocent students
who, aspiring to greatness at the na-
tion’s top law schools, will find them-
selves alone and stung by the two Mogs
this weekend while taking the Law
School Admissions Test.

I was shocked recently when I found
out that one of Domino’s Pizza’s top
delivery men was Washington and Lee,
Class of 1978. Obviously, he was a pre-
law liberal arts major aspiring to

  

MY VIEW

ni

greatness as one of the country’s top
criminal or corporate lawyers until he
ran into the LSAT. The LSAT, from my
understanding, has turned out some of
America’s most intelligent and over-
qualified high school English and
history teachers and manual workers.

My first encounter with the LSAT
came my sophomore year here. Until
then, I had imagined it as being nothing
but a glorified Scholastic Aptitude Test
of the type needed to go to college.

But my roommate, a senior, was a C-
school major with law school plans. My
most vivid memories of the first month
of that year of living together are of him
dragging in at 10:30 or 11 every other
night for almost forever, his hair muss-
ed up, his eyes bloodshot and his brain
frazzled from four hours of a prep
course designed to make him logically
see that a Mog, Pog and Rog are the
three creatures that should be introduc-
ed into the aquarium, obviously, be-
cause from the original set of conditions,
it follows that none of those three prey
upon the others.

My second most vivid memory is the

 

day the results were returned in the
mail. It was a dark and gloomy day over
202 S. Randolph St. Ducking thrown ob-
jects and allowing myself to be used as a
verbal sounding board, I realized that
the LSATs can play a major role in the
direction your life is going to take. The
next week, my roommate started apply-
ing to divinity schools.

As I see it, it is a no-win situation.
If you do poorly, say good-bye to law
school. But if you take a prep course,
study hard and do well, you get into the
law school of your choice....but only at
the consequences of having all faculties
of logical reasoning shot for life.

Actually, maybe it is time for Drs.
Margand, Elmes, Jarrard, et. al., to
take a scientific look at these students
who have been subjected to such per-
verse mind games at the pinnacle of
their academic careers. Do students
who master the logic behind such il-
logical reasoning really begin to develop
the same traits as an isolated rhesus
monkey: withdrawal, biting themselves
and general anti-social behavior?
Maybe that is why W&L’s “favorite
tradition” according to one “college ex-
pert,”’ is getting drunk, rolling down the
road and abusing women: we do have a
high percentage of pre-law students.
And are these symptoms permanent, or
simply long-term? Professor Margand,
we need your help!

The ‘‘Wog”’ problem is an example of

e Inside Insanity’

the part of the test known as analytical
reasoning. The other parts are a writing
sample, reading comprehension, issues
and facts and a section dubiously dub-
bed “logical reasoning.”

“Apple pie tastes good. Since ice
cream is not apple pie, it doesn’t taste
good.”” That is but one example of the
‘logical’ reasoning necessary to under-
stand to do well on this section. The key
is to put logic in the sense of reality
aside and look at logic only in terms of
the given scenario. Understanding that
premise, when given:

All alligators play the piano, except for
Elmo. Some alligators tap dance, but none
both tap dance and play a musical instru-
ment.”

“It becomes second nature for me to
logically justify the conclusion that
“Elmo the alligator tap dances.”’

Right.

All of it reminds me of the advice Col-
umbia gave to her beloved Eddie right
before he was mutilated with an ice pick
by his transvestite lover Dr. Frank-n-
furter in one of my all-time something
movies, “The Rocky Horror Picture
Show.” The advice? ‘Stay Sane Inside
Insanity, Lock the Door and Throw
Away the Key “‘.

But as the fateful day draws nigh, only
one thing really scares me: I think I
understand why the Mog, Pog and Rog
are in the terrarium together.

Is it too late to go to med school?

titled to one. In fact, one of the
problems that we have faced in
recent years is that not every
student would pick up his Calyx;
consequently, we have about 120
1983 books and about 100 of last
year’s books in our office. If you
have not picked up your books,
please come by the Calyx office
sometime and we will be happy
to give you one.

Another popular misconcep-
tion is the cost of the book. Last
year, approximately $7.50 of
your student tax paid for your
copy of the Calyx. The cost of
publishing each book was ap-
proximately $27.75. All of our
other revenues come from con-
tributions from your parents,
advertisements, fraternities and

portraits. We rely heavily on
contributions to pay for the book.
The publishing cost of this year’s
book is budgeted at $43,000. We
are asking the Executive Com-
mittee for $15,000, so as you can
readily see, you are getting a
bargain.

I hope that these changes will
be received as they are intended,
That being the production of the
best publication possible as a
memento of those years spent at
Washington and Lee. Any input,
both positive and negative,
which results in a better book
would be appreciated as would
participation by anyone in-
terested in being a part of the
Calyx staff. If you are interested
in working on the Calyx come by
the office anytime and we’ll be
glad to discuss your interests.

Tampering with Book dangerous

To the Editors:

The little article on page 5 of
last week’s Phi horrified me. Did
Cole Dawson really, all by him-
self, add a clause to the White
Book — did the chief trustee of
the honor system not know bet-
ter than to add an unratified
clause to the honor code? Did he
really quote the registrar, who
has absolutely nothing to do with
the administration of the honor
system, to support this maneu-
ver — did he think an ad-
ministrator’s opinions bound
him in any way? Did he really
not see the significance of the
clause he added — did he not
understand that marking stu-
dents’ transcripts is not a casual
personal decision?

Mr. Dawson perverted the
honor code, as the White Book
states it. He decided that ‘‘not in

good standing’’ would be stamp-
ed on the transcripts of those ex-
pelled in private honor hearings.
This is completely contrary to
the philosophy of our honor
system.

We have an honor system be-
cause we choose to live hon-
orably here — we recognize that
it is the right way, to live. We
have the single sanction so that
we can remove those who cannot
or will not live honorably. We do
not expell students in order to
punish or extract payment; this
would be absurd, negative and
impossible.

Our honor system is beautiful
— and different from other
honor systems — because it is
positive; our community cele-
brates honor in a world of
dishonor — we choose this. We
only have a ‘‘system”’ to remove

 

those who don’t share this
choice. When we don’t mark the
transcript (of a private expul-
sion) we demonstrate where our
values lie: living honorably with
honorable people — not teaching
honor to the world by branding
those who don’t belong here.

KC cuts near]

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee
passed a student organization
budget of more than $100,000 at
12:15 this morning after drastic-
ally cutting the budget requests
of the Independent Union, the
Frisbee Club, the literary
magazine Ariel, the Mock Con-
vention and the Calyx.

Of the 15 budget requests sub-
mitted to the EC, only two — the
Rugby Club’s and the Ski
Club’s — were granted. The re-
maining 13 were reduced by
varying amounts. ?

The EC had $88,350, not in-
cluding $7,000 for the student
body reserve fund and $5,600 in
EC expenses and funding, to
distribute among the organiza-
tions, whose requests totaled
$105,017.90.

The funds come from the $75
activities fee each student pays
with his tuition. This figure
reflects a $5 increase over last
year; an additional $25 goes
toward the new student activi-
ties pavilion.

The Independent Union, which
requested $1,200 to provide
entertainment geared toward in-
dependents, received $257 pen-
ding its first meeting Wednes-
day, after which, EC Vice Presi-
dent and finance subcommittee
chairman James White said, the
EC will be able to determine the
amount of interest in the group
and decide whether to award it
any additional funds.

White and senior represen-
tative Bob Tomaso said the EC
should limit the Independent
Union's budget to organizational
costs, not entertainment costs.

The EC voted 6-3 to accept this
budget for the IU, with Secre-
tary Sam Dalton, junior repre-
sentative Pat Hayden and sopho-
more representative Shayam
Menon opposed.

If the EC decides to award
more money to the Independent
Union, led by chairman Chuck
Diffenderffer, it would come out

of the student body reserve fund.

next week to become final
—White said he asked the stu-
dent organizations to ensure that
they don’t run a deficit this year.
University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley has indicated that if
deficits such as last year’s ap-
pear again, the W&L Business
Office may try to take more con-
trol over student funds, White
said.

Last year the student body
organizations showed a deficit of
$1,411...The EC depleted its
reserve fund to bail out nume-
rous organizations — partic-
ularly the Student Activities
Board — that exceeded their
budgets.

“IT anticipate a little more
responsible accounting — this
year,’ White said.

The following is a list of each
organization, the amount it re-
received and the discussion
preceding the decision:

¢ The Student Activities Board
received $49,450, $7,000 of which
will be returned to the EC to
replace the reserve fund it help-
ed deplete last year.

The finance subcommittee,
which made a recommendation
on each organization's budget
last night, and the SAB had
agreed on a figure $50 greater
before budget deliberations, but
the $50 later was given to the In-
dependent Union.

¢ The Ring-tum Phi requested
$14,852 and received $13,000. The
EC said one of the reasons for
the cut was that the Phi ended
last year with a surplus of
almost $600, which, as establish-
ed by the student body constitu-
tion, reverted to the Publications
Board, which oversees the four
student publications.

One of the themes recurrent in
the explanations of the publica-
tions’ budgets was that if a
publication needed financial
assistance during the school
year, it should turn to the
Publications Board, rather than

¢ Calyx editor David Sprunt’s
request for $15,000 was reduced
to $11,500. Overdue bills totaling
$1,900 that could be paid this
year prompted the EC to cut the
yearbook’s budget. There were
other areas in which the EC said
savings could be made that
would still allow Sprunt to add 50
pages and an additional color
section.

e Contact, the speaker sym-
posium, received $9,000 from the
EC and is expected to receive
another $7,500 from the Inter-
fraternity Council, its cosponsor.

Last year, it was discovered
that Contact had accumulated
about $15,000 in debts. Most of

¢ The Mock Convention re-
quested $6,000 and received
$3,500. The main reason for the
cut was that the group has e-

from last year, and the addi-
tional money it wanted to invest
for the 1988 Mock Convention
was used elsewhere in the EC
budget.

¢ Ariel received half its budget
request of $3,600 because, White
said, the finance subcommittee
decided the literary magazine

pages instead of 20 in each issue.

EC saw places in its budget
where savings could be made.

e The Fencing Team, which is
hoping soon to become a varsity
team, requested $1,454.55 and
received $1,200. Sports clubs
such as this generally were iook-
ed upon with more generosity by
the EC if the members paid dues
and bought their own equipment.

¢ The International Club’s re-
quest of $1,400 was cut by $300
because that was the amount of
its surplus last year.

¢ The Film Society's request of
$1,500 was cut to $1,000, with
some EC members suggesting
that money could be saved by
charging admission to the films

EC decides on honor system changes

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee
discussed honor system matters
at its weekly meeting Monday
night, opening one can of worms
and closing another.

Vice President James White
put forth a motion that would
give the EC an additional two-
minute statement during the
closing remarks in an open
honor hearing. ~

The motion, passed 80 with
two abstentions, needs to be ap-
proved a second time next week
because it deals with the honor
system.

The committee also deleted
two portions of the Honor Sys-
tem’s White Book that said that
a student found guilty in a closed
honor hearing will have a nota-

tion added to his transcript say-
ing he withdrew in bad standing.

Student Body President Cole’
Dawson said last night he added
the sentences to the White Book
over the summer because, ‘‘I
just felt this went along with
what we passed year.”

Dawson introduced the idea of
giving the EC more time to
make its case in open trials by
saying that some law students
had told him that the EC was
taken advantage of in open hear-
ings last year.

“They feel the EC is at a dis-
advantage by not having the last
say in the open hearing,’ Daw-
son said.

‘We do not have a chance to
refute or add anything to the
defense’s statements,”’ he add-
ed.

Currently, the EC makes a

five-minute closing statement,
followed by a statement by the
defense. The motion would give
the EC an additional two-minute
statement after that.

Senior law representative Gor-
don Hammock said that is the
procedure used in U.S. courts.

“This is in fairness to our side
as well as theirs,’’ Dawson said.

In deleting the portions of the
White Book that Dawson said he
added over the summer, the EC
claimed jurisdiction over nota-
tions on the transcripts of expell-
ed students.

One of the reasons he made the
changes, Dawson said last week,
was that he was uncertain if it
was in the committee’s power to
decide the contents of a student’s
transcript.

“T’ve talked with Dean (of
Students Lewis) John about it,

and he confirmed that it is within
the EC’s jurisdiction,” Dawson
said.

The discussion of whether to
re-remove the sentences center-
ed around the same questions
that were debated when they
were first removed last year.

Caruthers said that having a
student’s transcript say ‘‘expell-
ed” only after a guilty verdict in
an open hearing would provide a
deterrent to appealing to the
open hearing.

White added that since it was
in the spirit of the honor system
to keep decisions private, it
would be improper to tell a stu-
dent’s future employer or future
school that he had been found
guilty in a closed hearing.

“On the other hand, if he
wants to go open with it, then
he’s made it public,’’ White said.

By Cotton Puryear The Ring: tum Phi

Posters for this year’s freshman class elections were both abun-

dant and original,

Freshman turnout 55%

About 55 percent, or 198
students, of the freshman class
voted in Monday’s election for
class officers and an Executive
Committee representative, pro-
mpting EC Vice President
James White to call it a ‘great
turnout.”’ .

Jim Lancaster was elected
freshman class vice-president
Monday and John Faulkner won
the University Council represen-
tative election.

In today’s runoff, David
Makepeace, Jay Markley and
Brandt Wood were on the ballot
for freshman EC representative.
A runoff also was held for
freshman class president, for
which Andrew Abernathy and
Micheal Henry competed.

First year law students also
voted in a runoff today for an EC
representative. That contest was
between James Crutchfield and
Bill Thompson.

Former math professor dies

Felix P. Welch, former Cincin-
nati Professor of Mathematics
at Washington and Lee, died
Saturday following a brief il-
Iness. He was 78.

A native of Kewanee, Miss.,
Welch taught mathematics at
Washington and Lee for 30
years, 25 of those as head of the
department of mathematics.

He earned his bachelor of
science degree in chemistry
from Mississippi State Universi-
ty in 1929. He held a master’s
degree in mathematics from the
University of Texas and receiv-
ed his Ph.D. in mathematics
from the University of Illinois.

He served with the United
States Army during World War
II and retired from the Army in
1961 with the rank of major.

Welch began his teaching
career at his undergraduate
alma mater, Mississippi State,
in 1929. He taught at the Stark-
ville, Miss., school for 18 years
before joining the faculty at

Washington and Lee in 1947.

He held W&L’s Cincinnati Pro-
fessorship of Mathematics
throughout his W&L teaching
career.

One of Welch’s fields of
research involved developing
visual aids in mathematics. In
1967, Welch produced ‘The
Theorem of the Mean,”’ an ani-
mated film sponsored by the
Mathematical Association of
America.

He was the co-author with
Washington and Lee mathe-
matics Professor Robert S.
Johnson of a_ text-workbook,
“Calculus.”

He was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, the American Mathe-
matical Association, the Math-
ematical Association of America
and the Virginia Academy of
Science.

When Welch retired from ac-
tive teaching in 1977, the W&L
board of trustees elected him
Cincinnati Professor of Mathe-
matics, Emeritus.

Elections prompt complaints

_mpevraanamiersne sar aD SPECIE ES SAT!
By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN

Staff Reporter

 

Monday’s elections for Ex-
ecutive Committee represen-
tatives and freshman class of-
fieers have prompted what EC
President Cole Dawson termed a
“legitimate complaint.”

At the EC meeting Monday
evening, Steve Roth, a freshman
class presidential candidate who
failed to qualify for today’s
runoffs by six votes, pointed out
that only one poll was open to
freshmen and contended that the
location of that poll was unfair to
some candidates.

Roth, a resident of Davis Dor-
mitory, said that candidates
from Graham-Lees Dormitory
had an advantage since the poll
was located in the Graham-Lees
quad.

“Everyone that won (in Mon-
day’s election) was from
Graham-Lees,” Roth said.

After Roth had presented his
criticism to the EC, sophomore
representative Andrew Caruth-
ers determined from the list of
voters that of 232 Graham-Lees
residents, 133, or 57 percent,
voted; of 58 Davis Dormitory
residents, 27, or 46 percent,
voted; and of 87 students living
in Gilliam, 34, or 40 percent,
voted.

Dawson said he believes the
figures to be ‘‘close enough’’ not
to have been a factor in the out-
come of Monday’s election.

Concerning Roth’s complaint,
Dawson said, “I think the stat-
istics show that having the one
poll in Graham-Lees was not as
great a factor as he thought.”

Dawson said he believes that
the amount of polling places had
no bearing on the election’s out-

come. “‘I think if it had been an
election other than the freshman
election then it would have been
a big deal,” he said.

“‘T think we did conform to the
rules,’’ he said. ‘‘That is my opi-
nion.”’

Vice President James White
moved to stand behind the elec-
tion results pending any input
from the Voting Regulations
Board, until last week chaired
by senior Burford Smith, who
resigned.

While this motion was being
discussed, Caruthers pointed
out, ‘But the VRB’s going to
turn to us and say, ‘What do I do
guys?’ ”’

The motion passed with only
Caruthers opposed.

According to the Voting
Regulation Board’s_ election
regulations, ‘‘there shall be a
minimum of two and a maxi-
imum of five places for polling.’

VRB Chairman Bill Metzger
accounted for that minimum,
saying that another poll was
located at the Law School, where
first year law students were
voting for an EC representative.

Metzger, however, confirmed
that no freshman ballots were
located at the Law School poll.

Chris Carter, who was the
VRB chairman for the latter
part of the ’83‘84 school year,
said, ‘‘If there were no ballots
(at the Law School) for the
freshmen, then they (the VRB)
are in violation of the regula-
tions.”

Carter, however, called the
rules ‘‘vague.”’ ‘“They need to be
straightened out,’’ he said.

At an EC meeting Monday,
Sept. 17, Carter recommended
that the VRB have more than
one main campus polling place.

That evening, the EC announced
that two main campus polls
would be set up for the election.

Metzger, who was appointed
VRB chairman Sept. 20, said
having only one main campus
poll was a ‘‘decision between the
EC and me.”’ He said he believes
the decision does not violate the
VRB regulations, “‘not in my in-
terpretation of the rules.”

‘“T’m standing by the elec-
tion,’’ he said.

“Shortness of time’’ was a fac-
tor in the decision to reduce the
number of polling places from
the number announced at the EC
meeting, said Metzger. “I really
didn’t know what was going on
until a few days ago when I got
hold of the regulations,”’ he said
Monday evening. One of the
responsibilities of the VRB
chairman is to be sure that the
polls are staffed at all times.

Metzger said he “realized
quite quickly that it would take a
lot of effort’’ to find the man-
power to staff the polls.

As a former VRB chairman,
Carter also acknowledged the
difficult task of finding students
to man the polls.

Roth, however, still is not
satisfied.

“Technically they (the EC)
got themselves out of it,” he said
in regard to the confusion over
the number of polls. But Roth
said that the Law School and
undergraduate campus are ‘‘two
different schools,’’ and that the
VRB’s and EC’s decisions re-
main questionable.

Roth also recognizes, ‘‘I can’t
do anything about their deci-
sion.”’

But he said he will not sit idly.
“T plan to run next year,”’ Roth
said, ‘‘to try and straighten it
out.”’

Visiting professor brings Oxford to WGL

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

In one way, saying that you
are going to study at Oxford is
like saying that you are going to
study in the Boston area. Neither
statement narrows things down
a whole lot.

But America’s claims to old,
tradition-filled universities,
even in the Boston area, pale in
comparison to Oxford, Harvard,
America’s oldest college, was
founded in 1636. University Col-
lege, the oldest of the more than
30 colleges that comprise Oxford
University, was founded in 1249.

From Friday to Wednesday,
Washington and Lee, the sixth
oldest institution of higher learn-
ing in the United States, played
host to George Cawkwell, the
vice-master of University Col-
lege.

After Professor Cawkwell’s
lecture to a history class, one
sophomore said it was the best
lecture he had heard since com-
ing to W&L. Why? “It was not
just a talk, but a lecture,’’ he
said. Another student said he
“Jost track of all time’’ during
the lecture.

Asked what makes Oxford uni-
que, a question which has been
scrupulously examined here at
W&L during the past year, Pro-
fessor Cawkwell did not answer
by citing the all-male atmos-
phere, because Oxford is coedu-
cational.

“The two most interesting
things about Oxford are the col-
legiate system...(and) that in-
struction is not based on lec-
tures, but on tutorials,’ said
Cawkwell, adding that some stu-
dents never even attend a lec-
ture during their Oxford years.

According to Cawkwell, the
' college system provides stu-
dents with ‘‘a fairly small group

 

George Cawkwell

and a fairly close group’ with
whom to associate. ‘They live
together in the college and form
their friendships,”’ he said.

Each of the 12,000 students at
Oxford is assigned to a tutor in
his respective college. Each
week, the student writes an
essay that he must defend oral-
ly.

“T would normally have 14 or
15 people who I am responsible
for. I spend about an hour argu-
ing with them about what they
said. It makes students work the
way they don’t work elsewhere,”
Cawkwell said.

The tutorial system is any-
thing. but heaven for a pro-
crastinator. ‘‘The college has
close supervision,” Cawkwell
explained. Those students who
do not do their work are ‘“‘sent
down,”’ as they say on the isle,
or, as Americans say, ‘‘expell-
ed.”’

Neither the college system nor
the tutorial system has been du-
plicated anywhere, according to
Cawkwell. ‘‘No one in his right
mind would set out to create

 

 

Snacks, Beer, Wine

such a thing now. It’s just an ac-
cident of historical survival,’
said the tutor of ancient history,
citing finances as the major rea-
son for his statement.

Although Cawkwell said he is
not very familiar with the
American system of education,
he believes that the English tend
to specialize in a subject at a
much earlier age than do the
Americans.

“They don’t do a broad sweep
of subjects as you do in your
B.A.’s,’’ Cawkwell said. “I think
you’ve got this broad problem
that if you have breadth, you
don’t have depth, and if you have
depth, you don’t have breadth.”

Breadth and depth do not seem
to be a problem for Cawkwell,
who seems very much the Brit-
ish schoolmaster with his white

hair neatly combed back, his
tweed jacket and his accent. A
native New Zealander, he earn-
ed a degree in Classics before
coming to Oxford on a Rhodes
Scholarship in 1946. At Oxford,
Cawkwell earned his degrees in
ancient history and philosophy,
and his ‘‘blue”’ in rugby.

Cawkwell explained that a
‘“‘blue’’ is someone who has
played against Cambridge.
“‘People try very hard to get a
blue,”’ Cawkwell said.

Students chosen to play
against Cambridge receive a
card asking them, ‘‘Would you
like to play against Cam-
bridge?”’ ona certain date.

Cawkwell said the Rhodes
Scholarships used to be more
sports-oriented. The major
sports at Oxford are rowing,

cricket and rugby, three of the
lesser known sports in America.

Cawkwell is the author of the
biography, ‘Philip of Mace-
don.”’ His position of vice-master
would be similar to that of a
vice-president at an American
college.

On Monday, the precise, con-
cise and dry-humored scholar
gave a lecture titled,
‘“‘Thucydides and Athenian Im-
perialism’” in Northen Audi-
torium. Cawkwell gave a lecture
on Tuesday titled, ‘‘Let Sleeping
Dons Lie,”’ a discussion about
his life as a member of the Ox-
ford family.

Cawkwell has been to W&L in
the past and has had contact
with W&L through the exchange
program between the two uni-
versities.

ROTC head will recruit women

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Lt. Col. Luke B. Ferguson, the
new military professor and head
of Washington and Lee’s Army
ROTC, said that women will be
included in the program next
year.

He said he hopes to enroll 10
percent of next year’s female
students in ROTC. “I know
they’ll be the cream of the
crop,”’ he said.

One innovation planned by
Ferguson is to have upper-
classmen in the program per-
sonally contact every freshmen
and sophomore to make them
aware of the benefits of the
ROTC Program.

Sixteen types of scholarships
are offered through ROTC, rang-
ing from four-year to one-year

assignment.

He describes the ROTC pro-
gram here as ‘‘solid.”’

“W&L historically has done
well’’ in maintaining its quota of
commissions, even during the
early 70s, when ROTC pro-
grams were being assailed on
campuses across the country,
Col. Ferguson said. ‘‘The ideal of
the citizen-soldier prevailed at
Washington and Lee.”’

His plans for this year entail
expanding on that solid founda-
tion. Fifty percent of this year’s
participants are new, but, he
said, ‘‘We’ve got quality. The
program includes captains of
athletic teams and presidents of
fraternities.”

There are plans to increase the
number of adventure and field
training exercises, along with
possible aviation assistance
from the local Air National
Guard. Also, experts will be in-
vited to lecture on various
topics, including a local lawyer
to discuss military law, ex-
POWs to explain the military

 

Col. Luke Ferguson

Code of Conduct, and experts in
the fields of special operations,
ordinance and counter-terror-
ism.

The military science depart-
ment is currently developing a
“four-year marketing plan for
1988’’ designed to introduce W&L
students to the military way of
life.

Most students haven’t experi-
enced Army life,” said Fer-
guson, ‘‘and we’d like to see
them for one or two semesters,
even if they’re not potential can-
didates. The Army is not for
everyone, but everyone ought to
know about the Army.”’

On the personal side, Col.
Ferguson and his wife are both
natives of South Boston and have
six children, ranging in age from
four to 17. Although they enjoyed
the metropolitan setting of the
St. Petersburg, Fla., area from
which they have just come, they
are looking forward to the easy
pace of life in Lexington. Col.
Ferguson said it’s nice to ‘‘wake
up and see the mountains
through the window.”

LSAT: 60 face pressure to perform Saturday

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

To become an attorney is the
dream of a large number of
Washington and Lee students.
On an orientation questionnaire,
roughly a third of the freshman
class consistently expresses in-
terest in entering the legal pro-
fession. Four years later, about
15 to 20 percent of them will
enter law school.

For approximately 60 W&L
seniors, a key step in the
weeding process on the road to
becoming a lawyer comes this
Saturday, when they will con-
front the Law School Admissions
Test, known as the LSAT.

The LSAT can be compared to
that nemesis of high school
seniors, the SAT, except that, as
one LSAT-bound senior noted,

 

“everything about this test is at
a much greater intensity.’’ The
test is more difficult, and the
results are a more important
factor in the admissions process.

“The most significant deter-
minants for admission to law
school are the LSAT score and
the undergraduate GPA,”’ said
Edward O. Henneman, assistant
dean of the W&L Law School.
‘‘Anyone who tells you different-
ly is lying.’’

Henneman said an LSAT score
of 40 or above (on a scale of 48)
accompanied by a grade point
average of at least 3.75 almost
guarantees admission to a num-
ber of law schools, including
W&L’s.

An LSAT mark below 35 or a
sub-3.0 GPA may cause some
‘“‘uncertainties,’’ Henneman ad-
ded, but is still acceptable to
many law schools.

Because of the obvious pres-
sure to perform well on the
LSAT, Mike Cappeto, the as-
sociate dean of students and
director of career development
and placement, encourages stu-
dents ‘“‘not to take the LSAT or
any other graduate school exam
without adequate preparation.”’

That preparation can be ac-
complished on one’s own or
through the purchase of LSAT
preparation materials.

A more popular route though
is commercial preparatory in-
struction, such as the National
Center for Educational Testing
course offered at W&L this
month at a cost of $375 for 40
hours of preparation.

David Deipierre, a third-year
law student who was the instruc-
tor for the NCET course, said
“some parts of the LSAT are
coachable,’’ although less so

Law student teaches course

David Delpierre, a third year
law student who is acting as the
Washington and Lee instructor
for the National Center for
Educational Testing’s LSAT
prep course, says he tries ‘‘to
provide the personal prepara-
tion needs of each person taking
the course.’’

Delpierre is a graduate of the
University of Virginia and is the
national secretary of the Student
Bar Association.

He said that having gone
through the admissions process
himself just over two years ago,

he is able to relate to the needs of
students who are today facing
that rigorous process. He said
the peer teaching situation that
exists is ‘‘an indirect fringe
benefit’’ to him.

Delpierre refers to the LSAT
as a “mandatory admissions re-
quirment”’ which is ‘‘coachable
in parts” and ‘is “taken under
pressure.” He urges students not
to “‘take the test more than once
because law schools either
average scores or use them

over going into the test cold.

The class motivates some
students to prepare more in-

who has found the course to be
‘*a confidence-builder.’’

said. “I tell people who I don’t

‘I felt I didn’t really need it,’’ he
said.

“Some people took the course
because they thought they lack-

Despite the test’s unarguable
importance, a poor LSAT perfor-
mance is not necessarily fatal.

the saving grace for applicants
whose LSAT score or GPA is
weak, Dean Henneman said.

Non-numerical factors con-

Stitution’s reputation, extracur-
ricular activities, work ex-
perience and recommendations.

Sutton disappointed by Rush

By JON MILES
Staff Reporter

 

“‘A general lack of coopera-
tion” by the fraternities has
resulted in this year’s Rush be-
ing ‘‘disappointing,’”’ compared
to last year, Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton said yester-
day.

An incident Saturday, Sept. 15,
underscores what Sutton said
was the major complaint about
this year’s Rush: Noise. Wash-
ington and Lee does have an
open party policy, but Sutton
said more people are aware of
the parties than expected.

“There are 1,500 students par-
tying, but 5,000 Lexington
citizens have to hear it,’’ Sutton
said. On Sept. 15, the Phi Kappa
Sigma house was repeatedly
warned to reduce the sound from
its band, which could be heard as
far away as the police station.

A

 

Fraternity President Jim
Cobb admitted that he was warn-
ed “‘seven or eight” times about
the noise. In fact, in recent
weeks, verbal as well as written
warnings have been issued
against the house for having
bands outside.

‘We were more than fair,”’

said Sutton, who was on the

scene. ‘We tried to work with
the people to control the band.”
By 10:20 p.m., after almost an
hour of discussion, tempers were
flaring. Sutton said the fraterni-
ty was “‘irresponsible”’ for its ac-
tions.

Other noise violations have
continued to present problems,
particularly from Wednesday
night parties. Three summons
have been written already for
noise violations from those mid-
week events. At least two of
those were issued to houses that
were warned not to have the par-
ties.

“So far, I’ve gotten a lot of lip
service from presidents about
the noise, but nothing else,”’ Sut-
ton said.

That apparent lack of coopera-
tion, Sutton said, leads him to
feel that some fraternity
presidents have not maintained
control over social activities.
Sutton said he has been called
unfair by certain fraternities,
although ‘‘very few’’ have abid-
ed by all of the Rush rules set by
the University.

Sutton also pointed out that
there were no summons issued
last year until spring term, when
this year’s presidents took of-
fice.

“This batch isn’t acting
responsibly ,’’ Sutton said.

More students than usual also
have been seen in public with
open beer bottles, Sutton said.
“Bither they’re walking around
unconscious or they don’t give a
damn,” he added.

There have been no arrests
this year, though, for open con-
tainers. An arrest can be made
only if the person with the con-
tainer is seen drinking, Sutton
said, otherwise, the police can
only issue a warning.

“We extend students the
courtesy of not following them
around waiting for them to
drink,” he added, ‘‘but they are
abusing that courtesy by ignor-
ing the law.”

The two-week Rush limita-
tions were themselves ignored,
Sutton said: ‘‘It was only shorter
officially.”’ Sutton added that he
understands the competitive-
ness of Rush and how that is
enhanced in a shorter period of
time. But he said he does not
regard that as an excuse to
deliberately circumvent set
policy.

Enthusiastically plunging into
its preparations for the arrival
of the first female students in
1985, the Coeducation Steering
Committee organized six sub-
committees last week and began
reviewing reports from other
colleges that had switched from
all-male to coeducation.

“The mood is incredibly up-
beat,’’ said Dean Pamela Simp-
son, chairperson of the commit-
tee. ‘‘Sure there are going to be
problems that are part of this,
but what an opportunity,’”’ she
said.

Ms. Simpson attributed part of
the reason for the committee
members’ enthusiasm to encour-
aging news from the admissions
office. Van Pate, associate
director of admissions, told the
committee that admissions of-
fice personnel visiting high
sohools have been swamped with
requests for information about
Washington and Lee.

Some of the issues related to
the transition, such as admis-
sions, will be reviewed by the en-
tire committee, while the six
subcommittees will study pro-
blems in specific areas, . Ms.
Simpson explained.

Frank Parsons, executive as-
sistant to the president, will
chair the Residential Accomoda-
tions subcommittee, Dean
Robert Huntley will chair Cam-
pus Security and Immediate Re-
novations, Professor Nancy
Margand will chair Health and
Counseling, Athletic Director
William McHenry will chair the
Athletics subcommittee, Mich-
ael Black will chair Student Or-
ganizations and Lee Hollis will

chair the Fraternities subcom-
mittee.

The subcommittees on Re-
sidential Housing and Campus
Security and Immediate Re-
novations will work closely
together. In planning for a new
dormitory, Residential Accom-
odations will have to be aware of
what modifications in existing
dormitories will be made and
whether these modifications will
be permanent, Parsons said?
Consequently, Huntley will not
only chair his subcommittee on
immediate renovations, but also
serve on Parsons’s subcommit-
tee so the two do not ‘‘work at
cross purposes,’’ Parsons said.

Parsons rejected the idea of
unifying the two subcommittees
because that would have created
a committee that was too large
to be effective, he said.

Ms. Simpson said each sub-
committee chairperson would be
responsible for selecting the
members of his own subcommit-
tee. No deadlines have been set
for when subcommittees should
complete their work, she added.

Most of the committee’s work
at present involves reading
reports and plans from other
universities that have recently
gone coed, Ms. Simpson re-
ported.

Committee members also
hope to visit schools that have
switched to coeducation and
seem to have things in common
with Washington and Lee.

Students told of vote laws

By PAUL SMITH
Staff Reporter

 

In a recent Washington Post
column, Haynes Johnson noted
that of all the factors that will in-
fluence this fall’s presidential
election, ‘‘none stands out as
sharply or holds greater long-
term political significance than
the behavior and attitudes of
young voters, especially those on
college campuses.”

The rising national debt, cuts
in educational programs and in-
creasing war and peace tensions
are all issues that today’s young
people will have to deal with for
the forseeable future.

As a result, the National Stu-
dent Campaign for Voter Regis-
tration observes, ‘‘you would
think that every student in the
United States would be
registered and anxious to vote
this year.”’

Nevertheless, notes that
organization, 14 million
Americans between the ages of

18 and 24 are not registered to
vote, partially because ‘‘many
don’t know how to register or
have been blocked by archaic
laws.”

Some Washington and Lee
students are eligible to register
to vote in Lexington or Rock-
bridge County. The deadline for
doing so is next Saturday.

Since most W&L students are
not natives of this area, state law
says they cannot vote here un-
less they pass certain residency
requirements.

“A student is really no dif-
ferent from anyone else,’’ ex-
plained Lexington registrar
Lucille Joyce. They must main-
tain ‘‘residence all year ‘round
with the intention of staying
here,” not simply for ‘“‘the pur-
poses of nine months of going to
school.”

Elizabeth L. Burch, assistant
to the Rockbridge County regis-
trar, said residence eligibility is
‘not based on any one thing”’
and is ultimately left to the

New day bad for Pit

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

Along with the switch of ‘‘band
night”’ in the Cockpit from Tues-
day to Wednesday, the establish-
ed fraternity party night, came
the question: will it work? So
far, the answer appears to be
“no.”

The change was made, accor-
ding to Mike Guerriero, exec-
utive director of the Student Ac-
tivities Board, in order to pro-
vide independents with another
social option and to give frater-
nity members an alternative to
Wednesday night parties.

After two weeks, a successful
night has yet to be had.

W&L Food Services Manager
Jerry Darrell said Cockpit reve-
nues this year are not anywhere
near where they were last year.
At the bar, he said, the receipts
are about one-third to one-half of
what they were on Tuesdays last
year.

This is due, he feels, to the fact
that the Pit must compete head-
to-head with the fraternities.
Darrell said he is not worried by
the decline in business, however.
‘“‘We’re there to provide a ser-
vice, and whatever happens,
happens,”’ he said.

“We're glad to have it on
Wednesdays,’’ he continued,

“‘because we need a good night.
It’s still the best night of. the
week,.”’

SAB Chairman Burford Smith
said the first two Wednesday
nights in the Pit were ‘‘not tre-
mendously well attended,’ but
that this is ‘‘not that far out of
line’ with the last couple of
years.

Smith cited a more strenuous
fraternity Rush this fall, which
kept some students (including
SAB members) occupied, as
well the failure of the SAB to
adequately publicize the new
band night, especially at neigh-
boring girls’ schools, as factors
in the decline.

Rush and lack of publicity
were also reasons for decreased
attendance stated by Cockpit
manager Chris Brooks. He feels,
though, that it is still too early to
tell how the new schedule will af-
fect the entire year. He does say
that it ‘looks like (the Cockpit)
will be hurt a bit.’”’ Nonethleless,
he is optimistic. ‘‘I think we can
have more successful nights.”’

Along with the drop in atten-
dance, Smith said that the ven-
ture is losing money. He put
losses at about $300 per week
thus far. This is, he said, a pro-
blem common to the beginning
of the year.

“‘discretion of the registrar.”’

She said the primary con-
sideration is ‘‘intent’”’ Whether
the student plans to remain in
the county for an_ indefinite
period of time.

Other factors that may be used
in determining residency, the of-
ficials said, include: location of

‘banking accounts, address on

driver’s license, jurisdiction in
which vehicles are licensed and
registered, degree of economic
independence and freedom from
parental control.

“‘We have some law students”’
who can vote locally, Mrs. Burch
said, “‘because they are mar-
ried, they have a home here,
they participate in community
activities, they drive with a
Virginia driver’s license, they
have Virginia tags, they pay tax-
es, their children are in school
here.’’.

Both the Lexington and Rock-
bridge offices say they will
assist students who wish to
receive an absentee ballot.

For Virginia residents, there
is a simple form that can be
completed and mailed back to
the student’s home city or coun-

ty.

320 choose drop/add

SaaS a EE NRE TTA NE TRAINER
By MICHAEL LONGSHORE

 

Fall term registration saw 320
Washington and Lee _ under-
graduates change their sch-
edules through the Drop/Add
program and 77 upperclassmen
choose to accept a Pass/Fail
grade in an elective course.

University Registrar Harold
S. Head said that the Drop/Add
Statistic, which remained vir-
tually unchanged from last year,
is low compared with most pri-
vate schools. Head expressed
some surprise, though, at the
number of students opting for
the Pass/Fail grade, which
dropped from 133 in fall term
last year to 77 this year, a reduc-
tion of almost 58 percent.

School policy for Drop/Add, as
outlined in the University cata-
logue, requires the approval of a
class change by both the stu-
dent’s faculty adviser and the
appropriate department head as
well as payment of $5. Head
noted that the money defrays the
cost of the forms involved in the
process, the computer work re-

uired and the more than 30
man-hours of overtime work in-

 

_ing to Head. The Pass/Fail

cluded in this phase of registra-
tion. Several years ago, the
University attempted to place a
restraint on the number of
students using the services of
Drop/Add by raising the fee to
$10. This policy was unsucces-
sful, though, and W&L since has
reverted to the $5 fee.

The Pass/Fail option, avail-
able to students from the sopho-
more level up, allows the in-
dividual to receive a grade of
Pass or Fail in an elective
course not counting towards his
major. Head said he feels that
the attitude of the students,
predominantly seniors, who par-
ticipate in the program is that a
teacher would not dare fail
them, especially in the winter or
spring term. The oft-touted psy-
chological advantage of
Pass/Fail is misleading, accord-

course is just as difficult as any
regular course, ‘‘and work is
graded on the same basis,’’ he
added.

Head attributed the decline in
the Pass/Fail option to the view
professional schools take of such
classes and the more serious at-
titude among students.

Dads take first step

on the road

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

Generally, the release of a
band’s debut album on a major
label heralds a big New York
party, with all its associated
trappings, an opening spot dn a
headliner’s tour and, especially
in the past few years, a man-
datory video with overblown
poses and technical gimmickry.

The Dads, a four-man band
from Richmond, celebrated on a
smaller scale this past Sunday
night, the eve of the release of
their self-titled album, by throw-
ing a party in their hometown for
their friends. Afterward, it was
back on the local circuit of bars,
college gyms and fraternity
houses. No studio recluses or
MTV mirages here — they work
out on the rock and roll fun-
damentals.

You won’t hear them com-
plaining, though. They have
forged their sound through three
years of nearly non-stop touring
up and down the East Coast.
Equally at home pounding out
‘‘Twist and Shout’’ and their
Stevie Wonder tribute, ‘Up-
tight,”’ they’ve also added their
own variations on other covers,

A Russian-language feature
film series will begin tonight

Hevsky”’ at 7:30 p.m. in Room

This 107-minute film is a
recreation of the Teutonic
Knights’ invasion of Russia in
1242 and glorifies the history-
changing role of single events

frozen Lake Peipus) that mark-
ed the Knights’ downfall. It

to fame

most noticeably a space-reggae
version of Bobby Fuller’s “I
Fought the Law.”

Yet their passion is their own
music, and the songs they’ve
written, such as ‘‘Imagination,”’
“Do What you Wanna,’ and
“Rhythm Master,’’ hold their
own alongside the older classics.
Their sets have become more
polished, and the move from
cramped fraternity houses and
overcrowded bars to larger
stages is inevitable.

The album itself gives no in-

dication of the fullness and .

diversity of their sounds onstage
— a three-minute song may have
a long introduction, and _in-
strumental jams may pop up at
any time. They have jelled as a
working unit — Bryan Harvey’s
thumping, rumbling bass, Kevin
Pittman’s rhythm guitar and
organ, David Ayers’ multi-
textured lead guitar and Michael
Tubb’s rock (and roll) steady
drumming.

Vocals are their strongest suit,
with Bryan and Kevin alterna-
ting leads and David contribu-
ting backups. The band has
balance and self-confidence, aid-
ed by Victor Benshoff’s always
able and integral sound mixing,
and their live performances are

decision to prepare society
through cinema for the coming
war with Germany, and for the
revival of pre-revolutionary
themes.

Directed by Sergei Eisenstein,
it reflects his un-Marxist switch
from masses to individuals as
the heroes in his works.

will include four additional films
throughout the semester. Each
film mirrors a particular period
of Soviet history:

ing.

They were able to reproduce
this “‘live’’ sound for the album,
thanks in large part to their pro-
ducer, Paul Leka (who is also
president of their label, the CBS
affiliate Estate). Recorded in a
week in a Connecticut studio, the
album has a minimum of over-
dubs and studio trickery, al-
though the band did take a more
active part in engineering side
two than side one, which basical-

ly set down songs they have had
in their repertoire for a while.
“Man With Machinery’ and
“Four Walls’’ give an indication
of even better things to come on
their (let’s hope) second album.

To get that album, however,
they must continue to do what
they’ve been doing — tour and
promote the album around Vir-
ginia and North Carolina. If they
can prove to the label that they
can sell their record, then they

get a bigger boost.

For now (fortunately for us)
we can catch them at fraternity
houses and college pubs, and
wonder at how long it will be
before they burst on the national
scene. .

With “Do What You Wanna’’
as their motto, and hard work as
their creed, ‘“‘The Dads” pro-
mise a good time for all. They
will be appearing at the Cockpit
on Wednesday, Oct. 10.

‘Karate Kid’ worth seeing

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

How does the proverbial ‘‘new
kid on the block’ turn from
“‘picked-on Pete’”’ to black-belt,
win the heart of the best looking
girl in class and wind up face-to-
face with her (also) black-belted
boyfriend? The answers to these
questions are revealed in ‘‘The
Karate Kid,” a well paced, en-
tertaining, if somewhat pre-
dictable, movie being held over
for another week at the Lyric in
Lexington.

After moving from New Jer-
sey to southern California, the
“new kid,’ played by Ralph
Macchio, undergoes a pretty
rough adjustment period, spend-
ing half his time dodging a gang

of bullies, led by his new girl’s
ex. Nearly beaten to a pulp one
night, he decides to fight back,
and with the help of an old care-
taker (Pat Morita Arnold from
‘Happy Days’’), who just hap-
pens to know karate, he learns
not only the skills to fight back
using karate, but also the spirit
behind karate.

Central to this picture is the
relationship between Macchio’s
and Morita’s characters. The
boy has no father; the man no
son. Director John G. Avildsen
takes Robert Mark Kamen’s
script and gives each actor plen-
ty of room to work with, and both
come across well. I was particu-
larly impressed with Morita,
who showed much more depth
(and restraint) in this role than
he did serving Richie and Potsy
hamburgers on ‘‘Happy Days.”

There is something mysterious
about his character, almost
unbelievable, yet he also has a
human side, displayed realisti-
cally in a scene taking place on
his would-be anniversary, and
Morita carries it off extremely
well,

One other point, which was a
big plus, in my opinion, is the
way that Avildsen ends this
movie on an extremely high
note. The emotion reaches a
pitch, and he leaves it there, so
the audience can walk out feel-
ing good, rather than pondering
some explanation after the
climax. He used a similar tech-
nique at the end of another of his
memorable movies, ‘‘Rocky.”’

All in all, despite its predic-
tability, ‘‘The Karate Kid”
works. It is a movie worth see-
ing.

‘My Dinner with Andre’ this weekend

The Washington and Lee Film

Society will mark the beginning
of its seventh season tomorrow
with the presentation of ‘My
Dinner with Andre,” a 1981
American work directed by
Louis Malle.

The film will be screened at 8

p.m, tomorrow and again at 8
p.m. on both Saturday and Sun-
day. All showings are in Class-
room A of Lewis Hall.

By Appointment 463-9588

The W&L Film Society brings
to campus recent ‘‘quality”
films that have been unavailable
in local theaters. In order to
make these works easily avail-
able to a wide audience, no ad-
mission is charged for the show-
ings, although contributions are
accepted.

The Friday and Saturday
showings of ‘My Dinner with
Andre’”’ will be preceded by an

open reception, beginning at 7

Anyone interested in the Film
Society series is invited.

“My Dinner with Andre”
ranks as one of the most surpris-
‘ing success stories in recent film
history. An extraordinarily pop-
ular work, the film consists
almost entirely of a lengthy din-
ner conversation between play-
wright-actor Wallace Shawn and
avant-garde theater director An-
dre Gregory.

Richard Grefe, faculty adviser
to the W&L Film Society, said
that ‘“‘unpromising premise de-

Watercolors displayed

An exhibition of watercolors
by Chinese-born artist Dora Lee
will go on display in Washington
and Lee’s duPont Gallery Oct. 1.

DuPont Gallery is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Satur-
day and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
Admission is free. The exhibition
will remain on view through Oct.
19.

The artist will present a lec-
ture/demonstration at 7:30 p.m.
Thursday, Oct. 4, in Room 9 of
Newcomb Hall. The lecture is
sponsored by the University lec-
tures committee, and is open to
the public.

A reception in Ms. Lee’s honor
will be held from 5 p.m. to7 p.m.
Friday, Oct. 5, in duPont Gal-
lery. That event also is open to
the public.

Born in Peking, Ms. Lee stud-
ied under the tutelage of Yen
Shao-hsaing and the traditional
master Chao Men-Chu. Later,
while living in Japan, she
became the student of one of
China’s great literati painters,
Prince PuJu.

She has lived in Washington,

D.C., since 1957 and has studied
sculpture there with Pietro Laz-
zari.

Her work provides an excel-
lent example of the fusion of two
cultures, the East and the West.

Although she continues to
draw upon traditional Chinese
themes, Ms. Lee also paints
Western subjects with an a-
wareness of Western traditions.

Her work is contained in the
collections of the Smithsonian
Institution, the Museum of
Natural History, the China In-
stitute of New York and the Na-
tional Cathedral in Washington.

She has given several ~“o-
person exhibitions, both in the
Washington area and in New
York City, and has won 42
awards in both painting and
sculpture.

Ms. Lee teaches Chinese tradi-
tional painting and calligraphy
privately in Washington. She

With new pavilion, SAB plans better bands

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

With the availability of better
facilities in the new student ac-
tivities pavilion, the W&L com-
munity soon will be able to enjoy
bigger and better bands, the Stu-
dent Activity Board’s John Hay-
wood said this week.

The Motown group, the Spin-
ners, will be the main attraction
at the grand opening of the
pavilion Oct. 12, Friday night of
Homecoming weekend.

This weekend also will include
a Sunday afternoon party at the
pavilion featuring the
SpongeTones, who performed
during last year’s Fancy Dress
weekend.

The Spinners are the first in a
list of bands — including the
Ramones, Stevie Ray Vaughan
and Scandal — the SAB feels

able to consider for social func-
tions at Washington and Lee
when the pavilion becomes fully
operational in January.

“‘We have the facilities now to
book big bands,’”’ Haywood said.
‘“‘We’ve always had the funds,”’
he emphasized, ‘‘now we have
the facilities.”’

When the SAB tried to book the
popular group Big Country for
Fancy Dress weekend, adequate
facilities were not available.

Haywood said ‘that if the
pavilion had been in use then,
Big Country would have played.

‘“‘We used to have to run bands
off about 100 amps,’’ he said.
“‘Now we have about 600 to 800
amps.”

In the past, Haywood said, the
SAB would be able to use Evans
Dining Hall once a year and
Warner Center once a year,
“‘and then we’d have to get down

September dry in area

A lack of rainfall in the Lex-
ington area this month has left
layers of dust and dirt on cars
and caused students to seek

relief in air conditioned
buildings.
The first 25 days of September

brought 1.22 inches of rain tc
Roanoke, according to the Na-
tional Weather Service there.
Roanoke’s normal September
rainfall is 3.42 inches.

Most of this September’s rain
occurred Sept. 3, when 1.12 in-
ches fell. An additional .04 in-

ches fell Sept. 5 and .06 inches
Sept. 14.

The lack of rain is caused by a
series of high pressure systems
that have dominated the area’s
weather during the past few
weeks, ‘‘Generally, we do have
quite a few dry days in the fall,”’
a National Weather Service
observer said. “Its nothing
unusual.”

A slight chance of showers was
forecast for today. Tempera-
tures are expected to be in the
mid 70s.

on our knees and beg to use the
athletic field,’ he added.

Now that the pavilion is being
built, Haywood said he expects
to see more entertainment for
the community, with the pa-
vilion being used for University-
wide activities Friday nights
and fraternity activities Satur-
day nights.

The higher quality entertain-
ment will be reflected in an add-
ed cost to students, though, SAB
President Burford Smith said
while explaining his group’s
budget request to the Executive
Committee Tuesday night.

“The entertainment out there
(in the pavilion) will be of higher
quality or be a national act,”
Smith said, ‘“‘so we expect to
charge higher ticket prices.”

In its budget request, the SAB
gave a projected need of $81,270,
but requested only $53,250.
Wednesday night, the EC award-
ed it $42,450.

‘“‘The more money we start out
with,’ said Smith, defending his
request, “‘the less money we
have to charge at the door.”

Admission to the Spinners will
be $5, with the entire show
costing over $15,000, twice as

much as last year’s Homecom-
ing weekend.

“This will be the first show in
the pavilion,” Smith added, ‘‘so
we felt justified to put forth a lit-
tle more, since (the pavilion)
will not be used in the fall.”

After Homecoming weekend,
the pavilion will be closed until
January, when the building will
be finished.

The rest of the SAB’s schedule
has not been set, except for the
Fancy Dress Ball March 8.
Tickets for the ball will be $30,
the same as last year, Haywood
said.

‘‘We won’t be looking at the
winter schedule until Novem-
ber,’’ Haywood said, ‘‘and that’s
when we'll start coordinating
with the girls’ schools.”

Lecture scheduled Oct. 4

James M. Cox, Avalon Pro-
fessor of English at Dartmouth
College, will deliver the third an-
nual Shannon-Clark Lecture in
English at Washington and Lee
next Thursday, Oct. 4.

His lecture, entitled ‘‘ ‘Adven-
tures of Huckleberry Finn’: A
Hard Book to Take,”’ is schedul-
ed for 8 p.m. in Northen Audi-
torium of the University Li-
brary. The lecture is open to the
public.

A native of Virginia, Cox holds
degrees from the University of
Michigan and Indiana Universi-
ty. He is editor of ‘“‘Robert Frost:
Twentieth Century Views” and
author of ‘Mark Twain: The

Fate of Humor’ and of nume-
rous essays on a wide range of
American writers.

The Shannon-Clark Lectures
in English were inaugurated two
years ago at Washington and
Lee by Edgar F. Shannon Jr.,
Commonwealth Professor of
English at the University of
Virginia and a W&L alumnus.
The series honors the memories
of his father, chairman of the
Washington and Lee English
department from 1914 until 1938,
and Harriet Mabel Fishburn
Clark, a grandmother of the
donor whose gift to W&L estab-
lished the lecture series.

 

Violations

that were blatantly broken.

“During Rush, you heard so
much that you can take all the
rumors with a grain of salt. Rush
was so short and different that
there was a lot of confusion — we
need fewer and more related
regulations.’’

Gray Sanders, president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said there
were numerous unspoken under-
standings among the houses dur-
ing Rush.

“T think this Rush was cleaner
than in the past, but you don’t
want to turn anybody else in

 

because they could probably
turn you in, too,” he explained.

“Fraternities can sympathize
with their biggest rivals,’ he
continued. ‘‘And your biggest
rivals are usually the most like
you, so you don’t want to turn
them in — it’s definitely a last
resort,

“If you get turned in, more
than likely you got a lot more of
the guys that the other house
wanted.”

Jim Cobb, president of Phi
Kappa Sigma, felt more strongly
about the problems of dirty
Rush.

“‘T heard guys in this house say
that they had heard about viola-
tions,” he said. ‘“The one thing I
knew about with some other peo-

ple — the fact that the SAEs had
a Sunday band I took to the I.C.”’

‘‘Rush is over before anything
would be done about the viola-
tion. If the fraternity were to get
probation, it’s after Rush, so it
doesn’t hurt them. Generally,
though, the houses wouldn’t
want to turn somebody in for
smaller violations.”’

Jeff Boswell, president of Kap-
pa Alpha, particularly felt that
this had been a dirty Rush.

“I definitely don’t fee) that it
was a Clean Rush,’’ he asserted.
“‘T think a lot of houses didn’t
want to turn each other in.
Fraternities have, in general,
felt this year like they had to
abide by the rules now — they
feel the pressure from the Hill.”’

no clear policy on blacks emerg-
ed. Responses to this question
ranged from “Are you kidding
me?”’ to “If the guy is a solid in-
dividual, there should be no pro-
blem.”

Various members of SABU in-
terviewed at Lee House II, or the
Minority Cultural Center, all
said they felt an underlying
degree of tension. Eroll Skyers
said he didn’t think he needed to

have to feel uncomfortable to
join a fraternity and decided not
to go through Rush. Others
echoed his sentiments.

Calvin Rankin added that
“everything the fraternity had
to offer could also be found
within SABU or at Lee House.”’

The common consensus was
that it was easier to just go and
see friends at the various houses
than to have to subject oneself to
a feeling of inferiority due to
skin color.

Alpha Phi Alpha, a_national
black fraternity, in February
1974, according to Dan N. Mur-
phy, associate dean of students
for fraternity affairs. Although
11 students were initiated into
the chapter when its charter was
granted, the chapter only lasted
about two years because it could
not meet a minimum member-
ship requirement established by
the national fraternity.

Murphy added that the ad-
ministration ‘‘encouraged Rush
for any black student who feels
comfortable with the Rush pro-
cess.”’

All the minorities interviewed
as well as Dean White said they
felt a black fraternity was not
the answer. The problem is that
there just aren’t enough blacks
to sustain a chapter. Everyone
would have to be accepted,
destroying the whole idea of
choice within a fraternity. Yet,
all of them encouraged black
freshmen to go through Rush,
even if they did have to put up
with the Abduls and Moham-
meds of the world.

Kickers’ mark

goes to 1-3

Re Tat ER ES RLM
By MICHAEL McALLISTER

Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team captured its first win of
the season Saturday but was
turned back for its third defeat
Tuesday.

The Generals soundly de-
feated visiting Averett Satur-
day, 3-1. Their turnaround was
cut short, however, with a 5-2
loss at Mary Washington Tues-
day.

Coming off a disastrous open-
ing weekend in which they were
outscored 16-1. the Generals

Gridders

needed a strong performance in
their home-opener against
Averett. And a strong perfor-
mance was what they got as they
were able to control play on both
ends of the field.

Goalie Jay Werner remarked,
‘“‘We were a completely different
team (Saturday) than we were
at Emory.”

The visiting Averett squad,

although tied with W&L at the ©

half 1-1, could not keep pace with
the Generals’ team play.

ay Centre, 2/-12

 

Statf erat

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball team dropped its second
consecutive game Saturday
against Centre College 27-12.

The Generals were ineffective
offensively in the first three
quarters, allowing the Colonels
to build an insurmountable 27-0
lead entering the fourth quarter.

Centre scored its first points o
the contest on a 30-yard field
goal in the first quarter. The Col-
onels put the game out of reach
in the second quarter scoring 22
points on a pair of 1-yard scoring
runs by Meredith Evans, a 1-
yard touchdown run by quarter-
back Mike Hall and a two-point
conversion. Centre led the
Generals 25-0 at halftime.

The Colonels increased their
lead to 27-0 in the third quarter
when W&L quarterback Bobby
Wilson was sacked in the end
zone for a safety.

The Generals were able to post

two fourth-quarter touchdowns,
but it was too little too late.
Tailback Gene Girard scored on
a 5-yard pass from Wilson, and
freshman reserve quarterback
Mark Oluvic ran four yards for
the second W&L score, making
the final score 27-12.

W&L totaled 234 yards of of-
fense for the game against Cen-
tre. However, most of this yard-
age came in the fourth quarter
after the outcome of the game
had already been decided.

Girard led the Generals with
73 yards rushing and five pass
receptions. Wilson completed six
of his 20 passes for 70 yards and
one touchdown.

“I was very disappointed in
every aspect of our game,”’ said
W&L head coach Gary Fallon.
“We are becoming very frus-
trated and have begun to put
pressure on ourselves. However,
we have not given up and will
turn the season around soon.’’

“Centre’s kicking game kept
us pinned deep in our own ter-
ritory, and when we could not
move the ball, they got it back in
good field position. We couldn’t
maintain any ball control which
put a lot of pressure on our
defense,”’ Fallon said. “In the
second half we regained a little
poise, but by then the game was
out of reach.”

The Generals (1-2) play host to
Randolph-Macon this Saturday
in an important Old Dominion
Athletic Conference game for
both teams. Randolph-Macon is
2-1 on the season.

“Randolph-Macon is a very
explosive team (32.3 points per
game average), so we will have
to get fired up and get back to
basics. We must get our offense
in gear and put together some
drives in order to keep their of-
fense off the field,’’ Fallon said.

The list of injured General
players continued to grow after
the Centre game. Defensive
tackles Alex Castelli and Mark
Weaver, linbacker James
Cockey and nose guard Jim
Lyall, all starters, sustained in-
juries against Centre. Backup
quarterback Jon Thornton also
was injured in the game. The
status of these players for the
Randolph-Macon game still is
undecided.

“T felt like I was watching
M*A*S*H,” Fallon said about
his team’s injuries against Cen-
tre.

Boxing: The Rocky story is just that—a story

By Mike
Stachura

 

 

....ven though he has been
pronounced as out of the danger
of ‘Parkinson’s syndrome,”
Muhammad Ali — the man who
personified to our generation

' that mysterious yet alluring
sport known as professional box-
ing — has given us all a scare
and perhaps a fearful realization
that the sport whose heroes we
had stood in awe of was some-
thing we should have left behind

with all those other archaic tests
of courage (read: stupidity).

The stories of the past cham-
pion and the great bouts that

in the past week cause one to
wonder about this once revered
test of men and manhood. Dave
Anderson, the sports columnist’s
columnist, paints an all too sad
— yet all too realistic portrait of
the once and future king of the
ring: ‘‘For more than two years

ed, but practically, its banning
can never occur. He writes,
“‘Boxing needs to be governed
better, much better. But boxing
is like sin. It’s too popular to be
abolished.”’

Boxing constantly piques a
spectator’s interest. It is our

now, Ali has been talking like a
man who was 80, his words cling-
ing together like cobwebs of
dust.”’ Anderson asks the ques-
tion that everyone has been ask-

be banned?”’

Anderson’s answer is evasive,

If you are able to step back

fact.

The Rocky story is just that, a

this sport can be, we will be wise
enough to control it before it is

Polo looks to finish second

The Washington and Lee
water polo team suffered four
losses last weekend at the
Southeastern Invitational in An-
napolis, Md., but head coach
Page Remillard isn’t discourag-
ed. Remillard said, ‘‘We have to
take the weekends and put
everything together for the end
of the season.”’

The Generals (2-6-1) lost to
Brown, 20-1, Navy, 21-1, Buck-
nell, 12-1, and Slippery Rock,
17-6. Each team rates among the
nation’s top 20 and Brown and
Navy are members of the top 10.

Remillard, citing Bobby Pear-
son and Tim Stanford for their
outstanding performance last
weekend, said, ‘‘They could play
for any team.’’ Remillard views
the last two weekends of com-

petition as quizzes for his team.
‘“‘We try to take the weekends
and find out how effective our
coaching methods are,’’
Remillard said.

In these quizzes, Remillard
said he concentrates on what his
team needs to improve and not
necessarily the score, but added,
‘“‘We’re very cognizant of the
scores.”

Remillard said, “We could
have worked on scoring more
goals but that would not benefit
us at the end of the season.”

“We did have scoring pro-
blems, but primarily we were
working on other things,’ he
said.

Remillard used much of the
weekend to give experience to
many of his freshmen and sopho-
mores. He also worked on team
defense, which he said he
believes is improving.

Remillard also said that his
goalies have improved. Goalie

Kevin Davidson is injured and is
questionable for this weekend’s
competition. Currently, Jeff
Cohen is playing shall-end goalie
and Charlie Groh defends the
deep-end goal.

Referring to previous competi-
tion as quizzes, Remillard labels
this weekend’s competition a
mid-term when the Generals
host the State Tournament.

W&L’s first game is at 10 a.m.
Saturday in Cy Twombly Pool.

Southern League powerhouse
Richmond, along with Lynch-
burg, Hampden-Sydney, VMI,
Virginia Commonwealth and
James Madison, will be par-
ticipating in the tournament,

Viewing the implications of
this weekend’s competition,
Remillard said, ‘‘If we are going
to contend for the conference
championship we need to finish
second in the state,’ and con-
cluded, ‘‘If we are on our course,
we should finish in the top two.”’

Frats, Hill clash
about regulations

Four-party

rule ended
until winter

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The widely criticized
fraternity party restrictions that
took effect this year were passed
with the knowledge and consent
of student leaders, Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John emphati-
cally told an argumentative stu-
dent gathering Monday night.

More than 50 students packed
the Executive Committee room
to discuss the restrictions, which
many see as the focal point of a
battle between fraternities and
the administration.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee last Thursday suspended the
much-debated ‘‘four parties per
term” rule until winter term,
when the student activities
pavilion will be ready for full
use,

Unchanged, though, is the
mandate that Wednesday night
parties be open only to members
of the house sponsoring the party
and their dates.

Those rules and others came
in for harsh criticism Monday
from students, many of whom
maintainted that the restrictions
unfairly inhibit campus social
life.

EC President Cole Dawson in-
vited fraternity presidents, SAC
members, Interfraternity Coun-
cil members and students to the
discussion, which was held as
part of the weekly EC meeting.

All five faculty members of
the SAC attended: Dean John,
Associate Dean of Students Dan
Murphy and Professors John
Evans, Marshall Follo and Sam-
uel Kozak. One of the duties of
the SAC, which also has five stu-
dent members, is to govern all
matters related to fraternities.

John said the widely casti-
gated regulations were proposed
by last year’s student body and

IFC presidents — Bob Jenevein

and Emery Ellinger —and pass-
ed by the SAC and the University
Council.

The four-party rule was ap-
proved with the understanding
that two houses can hold four
joint parties at each house per
term, and that the pavilion can
be used for parties involving
more than one house.

Evans said the intent of this
rule and the reason for the pavi-
lion were to reduce the wear on
the fraternity houses, which
alumni see as having deter-
iorated in recent years.

“They’re not comfortable with
the amount of people you pack i in
there,’’ Evans said.

Another rule limits Wednes-
day parties to the members of
the fraternity and their dates

and moves the weekly band in
the Cockpit from Tuesday to
Wednesday nights.

More than 50 people squeezed into the Ex-
ecutive Committee room Monday night to par-
ticipate in a discussion about the new rules affec-

ting fraternity parties this year. Among those in -

attendance were the faculty members of the Stu-

dent Affairs Committee, including Dean of
Students Lewis G. John and Associate Dean of

U. Va.:

ANALYSIS

 

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE —‘“‘Miss Fawcett, do you
believe that you have had a fair and just trial?”’

The University of Virginia sophomore, dressed
in a bright pink sweater, white blouse and striped
skirt, paused nearly 30 seconds before respon-
ding.

“T can’t... I can’t honestly say that what’s
been presented by the accusers is all true,” she
said in a halting voice.

Leaning forward, Bobby Blue, chairman of the
trial jury, told Miss Fawcett that she had not
answered the question, and repeated it.

After another pause, Miss Fawcett answered
softly, “Yes, I do.”’

Four hours later, sobbing gently in her
boyfriend’s arms, Monique R. Fawcett of Farm-
ville, Va., left the Honor Committee room in
Newcomb Hall on the U.Va. campus. Found guil-
ty of lying by a 12-student jury, she had just been
expelled from the university.

Unlike the result of most honor trials at U.Va.
(and at Washington and Lee), Miss Fawcett’s
fate quickly would become a subject of campus
discussion. Her name and photograph were plast-
ered across the top of the front page of Monday
morning’s Cavalier Daily.

When’ she left the Honor Committee room,

A look at an honor trial

where Sunday’s 12-hour trial had been held,
representatives of the media obligingly moved
out of her way, respecting her right to privacy in
an obviously traumatic moment.

The presence of the media at the open trial was
one of many differences between an open trial at
the 11,000-student University of Virginia and one
at Washington and Lee, whose undergraduate
student body is about one-tenth that size.

Washington and Lee open honor trials — open
only to W&L students and faculty — are not sup-
posed to be discussed outside the W&L communi-
ty. No one may take notes during the trial, and
The Ring-tum Phi never uses the accused’s name
in any story it might print about the trial.

Such is not the case at the school founded by
Thomas Jefferson, where the honor system is
several years older than ours. A U.Va. student’s
public trial is open to the scrutiny not only of the
university community, but of anyone else who
wishes to attend.

Sunday’s open trial, the first since 1906 that was

‘not an appeal, was attended by about 35 spec-

tators and a dozen members of the media, in-
cluding Charlottesville radio and television sta-
tions and The Associated Press.

In order to be admitted, spectators and the
media had to obtain passes from the Honor Com-
mittee the week before the trial. The Honor Com-

mittee room is only about twice the size of W&L’s

Executive Committee meeting room.
( See Honor, Page 6

Yes, it would
be funny if.

Most of us have sat around
with friends and_ said,
‘“‘Wouldn’t it be funny if...?”’
Well, some Young Democrats
did that last week, and it sort
of got out of hand.

A few Y.D.s, anticipating a
Nov. 6 landslide and anxious
not to let another fad pass
them by, said, ‘‘Wouldn’t it be
funny if...we endorsed Bozo, I
mean Bonzo?”’

Well, people with little ears
tend to have big mouths, and it
wasn’t long before word was
going around that the Y.D.s
were actually going to endorse
Ronald Reagan.

“Whoever leaked it, leaked
it without knowing that it was
a joke,”’ said James K. Mur-
phy, president of the club.

So, folks, it is just a joke.

It’s amazing how these
things get started. Wouldn’t be
funny if...during a microphone
test, the President said he was
going to bomb Russia?

The Y.D.s might actually

Debating for votes

Presidential debates are once more upon us.

Four years ago, most college students probably
yawned through the Carter-Reagan debates. We
heard how Amy Carter was concerned about nuclear
weapons. Ronald Reagan, when he wasn’t telling
Carter, ‘“There you go again,” was sharing a vision
for an America restored to greatness by tax cuts, less
government and a strong defense.

The result of that debate, of course, is history.
Carter lives in Plains, Ga., a self-trained woodworker
and occasional critic of the Reagan administration.
Reagan lives in the White House when he is not on
vacation.

In 1984, the three debates of the Presidential
election— two between Mssrs. Mondale and Reagan
and one featuring Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Bush — will
indeed affect the election on Nov. 6. Some political
analysts discount their effect, noting that a propor-
tionately small amount of the electorate — 10 percent
— is undecided on its choice for the highest office in
the land. Ronald Reagan is leading Walter Mondale in
the most recent polls by anywhere from 15 to 20 per-
cent. Why debate? Let’s have another landslide!

But if the electorate tunes in on Oct. 7, 11 (to see the
Ferraro-Bush duel) or 21, opinions might be swayed.
We ought not to discount the importance of debates or
the ability of those involved to debate with vigor and
effectiveness.

Consider Walter Mondale. His media image has
varied from wimp to sap to quiche-eater since San
Francisco. He has been seen as a man who promises
the world to everyone, including the feminists,
teachers, gays, unions and blacks. His voice has been
whiney and downright tedious. His speaking style, un-
til last week’s fiery speech at George Washington
University, had all but garnered him the Sominex
Award for Sleeping Excellence. Crowds heckle him.
He was featured in a parade in New York City and no

‘one showed up to see him. It seems there are born

losers and then there are Walter Mondales.

Reagan, on the other hand, couldn’t appear to be do-
ing any better. His campaign appearances have been
before large cheering crowds. His speeches have been
upbeat and optimistic and delivered with all the flair
of an accomplished actor. Those familiar themes of
prosperity, peace and promise have become
trademarks of the Reagan campaign. His hair is not
yet gray, and his hearing, when he wants to hear a
question, is improved. He is a leader, the leader. He
probably even wears red, white and blue boxer
shorts.

Despite his seemingly invincible lead, however, the
President remains the one with the most to lose. He
has led a sheltered existence these past few weeks.
Reporters and camera crews have had limited ques-
tion and photo opportunities. The tragic Beirut bomb-
ing has made a nick in Reagan’s teflon coating. His
fumbling on the question of who’s to blame seems to
be backfiring. His command of the facts surrounding
that bombing, and countless other important issues,
has been questionable.

Walter Mondale, on the other hand, has everything
to gain (or lose) by the debates. He has proven a for-
midable debater with all the practice from the elong-
ated primary season. His command of the facts has
been astounding, especially when he gets heated. If he
charges after Reagan with an array of accurate facts,
he could catch Reagan off-guard. As the challenger,
he can be more aggressive and not risk the negative
image voters often associate with such boldness. He
just might be able to convince the Archie Bunkers of
the United States that he could really handle — or
even prefers — hamburger to quiche.

It actually happened

Some of the events of the first
month of this final year of male
chauvinism as we know it makes
us think that perhaps Ms. Wond-
erland spent some time here at
Washington and Lee. Join us for
a peek back through the Lex-

ton looking glass.

Your hose or mine? At least
those EC guys enjoy their jobs.
Now they don’t josh about ther-
monuclear war, like they did last
year (Reagan seems to be taking
up the slack), but they still have
a good time. For example, after
a heated exchange between stu-
dents and administrators over
increased social restrictions, the
ever-spunky Andrew Caruthers
had just the solution: ‘“Maybe

 

I promise

we should require ties at Wed-
nesday night parties.”

I liked it so much, I bought the
committee. The EC was in the
market for a recording/ tran-
scribing system early this year
(that’ll run you several hundred
dollars, by the way), and smooth

showed that the best system was
made by Norelco. “Do you get a

Communication is the answer

To the Editors:

I am writing this letter in
response to the question of frat-
ernity regulation. Hopefully this
issue will not lead to the animosi-:
ty we felt last year with the coed
debate. With good sense and
reasonable negotiation, we can
nip this problem in the bud.

Battle lines have been drawn
between the Hill and the frater-
nities, and it bothers me to see
such an adversarial condition
develop. This has not been the
case in the past and there is no
need for it to continue in the
future. The students and faculty
need to regain the lost sense of
mutual respect and harmony
that characterize the school.

The student-faculty relation-
ship, however, cannot be im-
proved by dictatorial proclama-
tions from the Hill. Such a prac-
tice insults every student’s sense
of responsibility and adulthood.
Democracy clearly does not ex-
ist when the students’ views are
not fairly represented.

I do not intend, of course, to
drop a guilt clause upon the fac-
ulty for igniting this conflict. As
responsible Washington and Lee
men, we all share a little of the
blame for arousing concern over
our social customs. Sure, we get
drunk and sometimes we overdo
it. But college would not be col-

lege if we led only a monastic life

of study. .Lhe faculty. certainly...

To me, the problem
transcends the trivial question of
Wednesday night parties. The
heart of the problem lies in the
breakdown of communication
between the students and facul-
ty. And until relations improve,
a standoff will only perpetuate
the crisis and worsen the
students’ situation.

The answer is not rebellion
—that has proven unsuccessful
in the past. Rather, we should
move to increase our voice on
the Hill through such commit-
tees as the SAC and the IFC until
the decisions which they render
reflect again the opinion of the
student body.

counselor added a note for those

not yet wise to the ways of W&L:
“Customary usually means re-
quired.”

It’s a good thing they’re cute.

Ballet, which is ‘not for wimps,
is free to all WGL ‘macho men’

From Staff Reports

It’s free and it’s good for you.

And we’re not even talking
about Brussels sprouts.

Washington and Lee students
are able to attend presentations
of the Rockbridge Concert-Thea-
tre Series at no charge because
of donations made to the pro-
gram by the university.

The first event of this season is
a performance by the Joffrey
Ballet on Sun., Oct. 14, the day
after Homecoming.

“I want the guys out in
droves,” said A.P. Smith, execu-
tive director of the series, which
offers among its other attrac-
tions this season Dizzy Gillespie,
the American Boychoir and
‘Hansel and Gretel’”’ performed
by the Cincinnati Opera.

The Joffrey performance
begins at 3 p.m. at Lexington
High School.

A university contribution of 25
cents per student, per perfor-
mance makes complimentary
student admission possible. Cost
for a date’s ticket is $5.

A mailing offering discounted
tickets for the entire series will
reach student mailboxes next
week.

Mrs. Smith, wife of a W&L

“the New York Times-Dis-
patch” every day.

I don’t know, but you’re a
cancer. Recently a girl at a
fraternity which shall remain
nameless actually came up to a
guy and said, ‘‘What’s your
sign?” To which the appropriate
response is: “‘I’ll be right back,
but I have to refill this. May I get
you anything?”

This is a weird place.

Isn’t it great?

journalism professor, said vigor-
ous student support of the per-
formances would dispel two no-
tions about W&L students: that
“because there are no girls here,
you’re uncouth macho men’”’ and
that ‘“‘you don’t do enough ser-
vice in the community.”

She said she hopes to arouse
student interest in these cultural
offerings before the advent of
coeducation.

“The girls are going to get the
credit for dragging you into
these performances,’’ she said.
“I don’t think the reason you’re
not coming is that there aren’t
any girls here.”

“Undergraduates have not
developed their artistic taste to
the point where going to a per-
formance other than to a rock
concert is of any importance to
them,’’ she continued.

Mrs. Smith, who has a doc-
torate in education from the Col-
lege of William and Mary, said
W&L men would be missing an
extraordinary experience by
skipping the Oct. 14 perfor-
mance.

“Ballet is the ultimate use of
the human body, its voice and its
mind to present life not as it is,
but as it ought to be at its
height,” she said. ‘‘It is a glori-
fication of the body, and the
most taxing of all physical acti-
vities.”’

“It’s not for wimps,’’ she add-
ed. ‘‘They have to make twirling
a 125-pound body look like throw-
ing around ostrich feathers, and
that’s not easy.”’

The organization was founded
more than 38 years ago by Mary
M. Penick, who now lives in
Roanoke.

“I was embarrassed,” Miss
Penick said. ‘‘They had good
concert series in Staunton and
Lynchburg, and at Sweet Briar
and Hollins. Lexington was the
only one that didn’t have
something like that.”’

“I love Lexington,”’ she said in
explaining her reasons for start-
ing the Series. ‘I grew up in a
house that my family had lived
in for three generations.”’

“It gives me a lot of satisfac-
tion to know that the series has
lasted,” she added. ‘I suppose
thousands of people have seen
these events over the years.”’

Mrs. Smith, who works out re-
gularly for ballet and weightlift-
ing and is training for a mara-
thon, said she hopes W&L men
will at least give the Joffrey per-
formance a try.

“When you ask students if
they’ve been to a performance
like this, they say, ‘Well, no, but
I know I wouldn’t like it,’ ’’ she
chided. ‘“‘That’s the stupidest
possible reason for not going.

- You guys are too bright for it.’”’

Committee to study school’s policies on felons

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

At the suggestion of the
Washington and Lee Board of
Trustees, a committee has been
formed to study the University’s
policies toward drug felony con-
victions, President John D. Wil-
son said yesterday.

“The committee will be re-
viewing the current University
policies and practices bearing
upon the institution’s response to
drug offenses,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘It
will also call for a review of the
institution’s various policy state-
ments bearing upon infractions
of the criminal code.”’

Psychology Professor Leo-
nard E. Jarrard has been named

chairman of the Drug Policy
Review Committee, which also
will include Dean of Students
Lewis G. John, accounting Pro-
fessor Jay D. Cook, journalism
Professor Robert J. deMaria,
religion Professor Louis W.
Hodges and chemistry Professor
Michael A. Pleva. Seniors Darby
Brower and Bob Tomaso and
third-year law student Peter
Baumgaertner will represent
the student body on the commit-
tee.

Wilson said he was pleased
with the makeup of the commit-
tee and feels the variety of
backgrounds will aid the com-
mittee. “Dean John will be
valuable for his past knowledge
of how the University handled

these situations. Dr. Jarrard can
give a scientific view of the
situation and Dr. Hodges can
give an ethical view,” he said.
Jarrard teaches a spring term
course on psychoactive drugs
and behavior during the spring
term, and Hodges is head of the
University’s ethics program.

Jarrard noted that the title of
the committee is restrictive.
“The committee will be looking
beyond simply drug policy re-
view,”’ he said. “‘We will also
look at whether or not there is
enough drug education and coun-
seling going on at W&L and will
look into getting some speakers
in.”

Among questions the commit-
tee should ask, Wilson said, are,

‘‘Must we treat all felony convic-
tions as (potential) grounds for
disciplinary action? Does it mat-
ter whether the offense was com-
mitted in Lexington or at home?
Against a member of the Univer-
sity or a townsman?”’

Wilson also raised the question
of whether a W&L degree car-
ries a testimony that reaches
beyond academic competence.
‘“‘Does a diploma from
Washington and Lee signify just
the completion of rigorous
academic requirements or does
it also make a statement about
the character of the individual
who has that diploma?”’

Although these may be dif-
ficult questions to answer,
Wilson said, they are important

and need to be addressed. ‘‘I feel
that too many students don’t
realize the seriousness of a drug
conviction,’ he said. ‘“‘The im-
plications of any kind of felony
conviction will follow a student
the rest of his life.”’

The board recommended for-
mation of the committee at its
meeting last May, following a
seven-month investigation by a
special grand jury of drug traf-
ficking and use in_ the
Rockbridge County area.

In its report, the special grand
jury said, ‘‘There is, indeed, a
large circle of drug dealers and
users within the area, affecting
all age groups, from high schools
through the two colleges...”

“Thursday morning classes
have almost been wrecked by
Wednesday night parties,”’
Evans said.

 

‘‘Most of us are convinced that

they are an extremely destruc-
tive part of the university,’’ he
added. ‘‘It’s dangerous to have
your students barely conscious
half the time.”’

‘“‘We are indeed trying to
reduce the size of Wednesday
night parties,’’ Murphy said.

Murphy added that as long as
the university was giving reduc-
ed interest rates on the mort-
gages of houses owned by the
university, the school should be

 

able to have some power over
the fraternities.

Some students said it should
be the student’s decision wheth-
er he goes to parties or studies
on Wednesday nights.

Evans said the faculty has ‘‘an
overwhelming responsibility to
the academic part of the univer-
sity.”’

“The faculty that have been
here for a long time realize that
the academic level of students is
much less than it was 10 or 15
years ago,” he said.

“There are members of this
faculty that have been here 35
years,”’ Murphy added. ‘‘I think
you have to appreciate that
there is a long-term commit-
ment to consider, too.

“You can’t let your short-term

good time endanger the long- ~

term health of the institution and
that is, finally, what happens.”

Some students still protested
that restricting Wednesday par-
ties to members of the fraternity
was not only unfair but possibly
counterproductive.

Evans said that restriction
was added because the SAC
didn’t want freshmen fraternity
members to feel compelled to at-
tend Wednesday parties.

Phi Kappa Psi member John
Lewis and sophomore EC repre-
sentative Andrew Caruthers
said the Wednesday night rule
will increase the divisions bet-
ween the fraternities.

“It’s the worst thing in the
world to come up to a door of
another fraternity house and
have a friend of yours say,
‘Sorry you can’t come in,’ ”
Lewis said.

In addition, he said parties at
the pavilion would be ‘“‘horrible”’

because of the size of the build-
ing.

“I'd really rather be at my
fraternity house, where I don’t
have to pay admission and I can
see my friends,’ added Jamie
Berger of Phi Kappa Psi.

“The students just felt that a
train had hit them’”’ when they
heard about the new rule, he ad-
ded.

Senior Louis Jehl of Phi Delta
Theta said that if students had
communicated with their repre-
sentatives, they would have
known about the proposed rules.

“We don’t have anybody to
blame but ourselves because
we’ve been unmotivated,’’ he
said.

Phi Delta Theta President
Reynolds Thompson said every-
one would be happier if the frat-
ernities were given a chance to
improve themselves.

shoot for, and if they fail, then

impose the rules on them,”
Thompson said. “But give them
a chance first.”’

Murphy said that other col-
leges had dealt with their frater-
nity problems by opening frater-
nities to anyone who wanted to
join or by disbanding the frater-
nities.

“T think in contrast with many
of the schools mentioned,”’ John
added, “‘this university is show-
ing support for its fraternities.”

John said he was concerned
that the new rules already are
being violated this year.

“That’s part of our frustra-
tion, that regulations are made
and they’re just broken,” John
said.

EC President Dawson agreed
that was a problem.

“Why don’t we try to live
under these rules?’’ he asked.
“‘Let’s give the system a chance
and try to make relations nicer.”’

Wood wins
EC position

Brandt Wood was elected
freshman class Executive Com-
mittee representative and An-
drew Abernathy was chosen
class president in last week’s
run-off elections.

The run-off, held last Thurs-
day, drew 257 freshmen, a larger
turnout than in the initial elec-
tion, in which 198 students voted.

Wood, who was sworn in at

Monday’s EC meeting by Dean
of Students Lewis G. John, said
he is happy and honored to be
representing his class. “I cam-
paigned hard and it paid off,”
said Wood, who won 45 percent
of the vote.

Publicity

increases

interest in W&L

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee admis-
sions officers, returning from
initial recruiting efforts and
“college night’’ visits across the
country, report a continued high
interest in the university among
high school students — both
male and female.

Admissions counselor Bennett
Ross credited the increased in-
terest to both the coeducation
decision and last year’s U.S.
News and World Report article
that ranked W&L as the best
smaller comprehensive univer-
sity east of the Mississippi.

Ross said that during a recent
visit to 17 high schools on Long
Island, he talked to 130 students
about W&L, compared with the
60 students he met at the same
schools last year. Ross said he
was also much busier than last
year when he visited the Long
Island College Fair, an annual
event that attracts about 16,000
high school seniors.

Ross added that the increased
interest in W&L he encountered
was not just a fluke because
other admissions office person-
nel who had visited the West
Coast, Houston, Dallas and At-
lanta also reported increased in-
terest in W&L.

“‘We are not at a stage when
we can say, yes, this is going to
be a good year. These are not
applications. I can talk to a
million people on the road, but if
only 100 apply then it doesn’t do
us much good,” cautioned Ross,
a former student body presi-
dent.

‘*A lot of people mentioned co-
education and also the U:S.
News and World Report arti-
cle,” he added.

Male students did not talk that
much about coeducation, Ross
said. Their questions about
coeducation mainly concerned
how it will affect their chances of
getting accepted.

“The women had a tremen-
dous amount of information
about W&L,”’ Ross said.

Ross said the prospective
female students were concerned
with the atmosphere for the first
women on campus. Many of the
women had heard of student and
alumni opposition to coeduca-
tion, he added.

“T always stress to them to
visit the campus,’’ Ross said “‘I
think that most of the women

that have come to the campus
have been reassured. I think the

 

Coeducation:

83

What Will It Mean?

 

 

adjustment here is going to be
really easy compared to other
schools.”

Ross said he did not hear any
negative reactions to coeduca-
tion from male students.

‘*No one has said, ‘Gee, I wish
you would have stayed all-male
because I really wanted to go to
an all-male college,’ ” Ross add-
ed

Ross said some prospective
students he talked to also seem-
ed to have been attracted to
W&L by the favorable magazine
article.

“There’s no question that that
kind of publicity helped us,’’ he
said. ‘‘We’ve sent out reprints of
that article to prospective
students. We figure we can get
about two more years’ mileage
out of that article.”

Ross said that in general he
found a great demand for a
small, coeducational, liberal
arts college in the South, and
W&L was trying to meet that de-
mand.

“People appreciate the diver-
sity in the curriculum,’’ Ross
said. ‘‘They can get the advan-
tages of a small school, but still
get the programs of a larger
school.’’

Ross said he has been encour-
aging students to apply to W&L
even if they think their chances
of being accepted are slim.

“‘We might get into a situation
where people think that they
might not be able to get into the
school because it would be so
competitive,’’ warned Ross.

The deadline for applications
for early admission is Dec. 1. In
an average year W&L receives
90-100 early admissions applica-
tions.

Feb. 1 is the deadline for all
applications for admission. A-
bout 1,600 students usually apply
each year.

Meanwhile, admissions office
personne] will continue to travel
around the country. Ross said
representatives of the admis-
sions office will visit more than
600 secondary schools in 37
states.

Honor

OC) Continued from Page 1

Students were not free to wander in and out
when they pleased, as they may do during a Lee
Chapel honor trial. Most of the dissemination of
information about the trial would have to come
from the few who attended and from the campus
newspapers.

Thus, although the trial was not ‘‘open”’ in the
sense that W&L’s are, it was more ‘‘open’’ than
W&L’s because of the media coverage.

The reasons for Miss Fawcett’s decision to seek
an open trial are not clear. Several Honor Com-
mittee members said that perhaps she merely
wished to reveal the inner workings of the U.Va.
honor system at a time when it — and many other
systems, including our own — is under intense
scrutiny.

Had Miss Fawcett been accused of an honor
violation at W&L, though, Sunday’s trial would
have been closed, no matter what her wishes.
Had she been convicted in a closed trial here, her
only appeal would be an open trial.

In Charlottesville, if she had chosen to have a
closed first trial, it would have followed the same
procedures, with the same jury makeup, as Sun-
day’s trial. In addition, if she were convicted and
wished to appeal, her appeal also could be closed.

A U.Va. student convicted of an honor offense is
allowed to appeal only for ‘‘good cause” — if an
error in procedure has been made in the original
trial — or if there is new evidence that, if in-
troduced in the original trial, would have resulted
in acquittal.

The student body Executive Committee is the
jury for a student’s first trial at W&L. At U.Va.,
whether the trial is open or closed, the jury con-
sists of four Honor Committee members and
eight students selected by the counselors from a
random list of 75.

The makeup of a jury for an appeal at U.Va.
would be similar to that of an original trial, while
at W&L the jury for an open trial consists entirely

     

 

tes eee eo eeeeeteeeee

of randomly selected students.

In many respects, Sunday’s trial was similar to
a W&L hearing except that it was much shorter
than most W&L open trials. The actual testimony
lasted only about 5% hours. The jury spent
3% hours during the lunch recess developing
questions for the witnesses who had testified in
the morning session and another three hours
deliberating on the verdict.

The trial proceeded smoothly, with few delays,
and most witnesses were ready to testify when
their turn came and few objections were raised
by the counselors.

At least four-fifths — 10 members — of the jury
had to vote ‘‘guilty’’ for Miss Fawcett to be con-
victed. At W&L, only eight members — two-thirds
— of the jury have to vote ‘‘guilty’”’ for a student
to be convicted.

The scene was reminiscent of many a W&L
honor trial as the crowd outside the Honor Com-
mittee room nervously anticipated the jury’s ver-
dict. Chatting in small groups, napping and mak-
ing some attempts to study, they also exchanged
small talk about the outcome. —

Finally, at 9:15 p.m., more than 12 hours after
the trial had begun, an Honor Committee official
emerged from the trial room to announce that the
jury had reached a verdict.

Miss Fawcett, her parents and her counselors
returned to the trial room. They were closely
followed by the public and the media pushing
their way into the room for the few moments of
this short — but agonizing — session.

Sitting in front of a bust of Thomas Jefferson -

and flanked by the 11 other students who had
made the fateful decision, Blue read the jury’s
guilty verdict.

Miss Fawcett stared forward in seeming
disbelief, then slowly rose from her chair. She put
her arms around her boyfriend, laid her head on
his shoulder and began to cry.

Silently filing out of the trial room, the
observers realized that they had participated ina
process — the essentials of which are the same on
the Grounds as on the Colonnade— that results in
a high degree of trust toward and among Univer-
sity of Virginia and Washington and Lee students.

A question of Honor

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

CHARLOTTESVILLE — The
facts of Sunday’s honor case at
the University of Virginia were
similar to those of an open trial
held at Washington and Lee in
the fall of 1982: a student was ac-
cused of resubmitting a test for
academic credit after markings
had been made on the paper in
an attempt to mislead the pro-
fessor.

The Math 122 — Calculus II
—test of Monique R. Fawcett
which was entered into evidence
showed a grade of 85 out of 100,
whereas mathematics instructor
Steven R. Edwards had record-
ed a score of 62 for the test.

Miss Fawcett had returned the |

test to a teacher’s assistant,
claiming that the score of 85
should, in fact, have been only
82. The accusers said that claim
was merely a ruse to get a “‘B”’
grade recorded for the paper
after the higher scores had been
forged on it. Miss Fawcett’s
counsel claimed she had nothing
to do with the suspicious
regrading.

The instructor testified that
when the test was returned to
him for re-evaluation, he im-
mediately noticed the score was
not in his handwriting and that
some of the marks on the paper
had been “‘badly scribbled out or
erased.”

An examination of the test fol-
lowing the jury’s verdict showed
that some of the markings on the
test had been carelessly scratch-
ed out, a dark felt pen had been
used to trace over some of the
numbers until the ink bled
through to the back of the page,
and erasure had been attempted
on some of the original markings

to the point that there was a hole
in the paper.

In accordance with U.Va. hon-
or system procedure, Edwards
invited another student to
review the test after the teacher
became suspicious. “‘I was sure
it had been tampered with,”’ said
Nelson A. Nieves, one of the two
students who formally accused
Miss. Fawcett. ‘‘There were ob-
viously problems and alterations
with Miss Fawcett’s test.”

Miss Fawcett, who said she
plans a career in oceanography,
testified that she was a ‘‘very
average’ student and that she
was ‘‘not super-impressed”’ with
Edwards’ teaching. She said she
found the marks on the test con-
fusing and had returned the
paper to have them clarified.

“I wanted to know if the grade
should have been higher or
lower,’’ she told the jury. ‘‘When
I first received the test, it did not
look tampered with — it just
looked like sloppy grading.”’

A math department teaching
assistant who had scored a por-
tion of Miss Fawcett’s examina-
tion testified that it was ‘‘not
unusual’ for mistakes to be
made in grading or for students
to request a review of a paper’s
grade.

“Mr. Edwards graded a test,
put a 62 on it, and it had that
grade when it left the math de-
partment,” said Christopher
Hockett, an advocate for the ac-
cusors. ‘‘The test was altered
when it was under Miss Faw-
cett’s control, and she knew it
had been tampered with when

‘The Bear’ struggles
for a passing grade

of scenes. Overall I would say

 

ae his performance was good, but I
think he came on a little strong,
occasionally, when speaking

One of the problems many of about football. From the first
us have when we see a movie is __ time he goes out with his future
that we go into the theater ex- wife, he talks about football in
pecting one thing and get an- ‘‘coach-like” ways. At that

other. This was exactly what
happened to me when I saw
“The Bear,” a film based on the
life of Paul “Bear” Bryant,
which opened at the State in Lex-
ington and across the country
last Friday.

I had hoped ‘‘The Bear”’ would
deal with Paul Bryant, the man,
not simply ‘‘Bear’’ Bryant, the
coach. What I finally realized,
about three-fourths of the way
through the movie, was that, in
the minds of writer Michael
Kane and director Richard C.
Sarafian, there was no way to
separate this man from this
coach.

Gary Busey plays Bryant; it is
his show to make or break as he
is on-screen in all but a handful

point, it seemed inappropriate;
however, when he stands in front
of his teams and tells them
to “hit somebody, help ‘im up,
and tell ‘im you'll be right
back,” Busey is at his best.
Again it is hard to separate this
coach from this man.

There are also some fine se-
quences in “The Bear.” The
training sequences with the
Texas A&M Aggies and Busey’s
reaction to his team when he
first returns as coach of Ala-
bama stand out. This film will
not win an Oscar as Best Pic-
ture, but it is not a bad film
either. It is a must for Bryant
fans; others, however, might
feel that ‘‘The Bear’’ fumbles
the ball just shy of the goal line.

Duck group wings onto campus

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Mention anything regarding
waterfowl on this campus and
one immediately thinks of
favorite Washington and Lee ex-
pressions such as “‘that guy is
such a goose,”’ or “he’s really
goosing out.’’ So when an organ-
izational meeting for a group
called Ducks Unlimited was held
Monday night, an investigation
seemed in order. To clear the
air, D.U. does not hunt, trap,
skin, protect, breed or have
anything to do with the ‘“‘feath-
ered’’ members of the W&L
community.

Founded in 1937, the purpose
behind D.U. is to help restore
and rehabilitate prime water-
fowl breeding grounds in Cana-
da, where over 70 percent of
North America’s waterfowl are
hatched. This plan began be-
cause of the loss of almost all
such lands during the 1930’s dust
bowl era. To date, over 2,400
restoration projects of wetlands
and breeding areas have been

 

completed.

The Tuesday meeting lasted
well over two hours, with a
movie narrated by John Wayne
showing the various rehabi-
litated areas in Canada. The pur-
pose was to establish an organ-
izational committee to oversee
the sportsman’s banquet, the
main source of income for the in-
dividual chapters.

Dick Francis, regional direc-
tor of D.U. for West Virginia and
western Virginia, brought vari-
ous brochures, pamphlets and
advice to show the enthusiastic
group of about 10. Francis re-
tired as chief of the Ohio Divi-
sion of Wildlife after 30 years
with that organization.

As the main source of income
for the individual chapters, the
sportsman’s banquet is quite a
show. Limited edition prints and
decoys, as well as DU’s “‘gun of
the year,” are only a few of the
items to be sold at auction or raf-
fled at the banquet. Ticket prices
have not yet been determined,
but the tentative date for the din-
ner and auction is Nov. 13.

The chairman for the new
chapter here in Lexington is
Eric Obeck, a junior from
Hampton. His family has been
active in D.U. for many years
and his mother was once D.U.’s
artist of the year. Obeck said he
called Andy Crowel, state chair-
man for D.U., who ‘‘really seem-
ed enthusiastic about a chapter
in Lexington.’’ The committee
decided to call the new chapter
‘Rockbridge County Ducks Un-
limited.”” Obeck added he would
“like to open the club up to the
community, especially those as-
sociated with Washington and
Lee.”’

“For people who don’t really
know anything about D.U. ban-
quets, I encourage them to at-
tend or ask their friends about
it,”” said Obeck, who has attend-
ed several of the events.

In buying a ticket for the ban-
quet, one automatically be-
comes a member of D.U. This
entitles the member to decals,
the D.U. magazine and other
items.

Parties, not horses,
draw Foxfield crowd

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE — A
small crowd was on hand for the
Washington and Lee home foot-
ball game Saturday against
Randolph-Macon.

Although the day was dreary
and drizzly, the weather wasn’t
the culprit.

The reason for the low atten-
dance could be found here, 75
miles to the northeast, where the
Foxfield Races attracted nume-
rous W&L students and their
dates for one of the largest par-
ties this side of Fancy Dress.

Although the primary reason
for Foxfield is horse racing,
most students who went said
they didn’t pay much attention
to the horses. But that didn’t
seem to matter.

At least five W&L fraternities
went as groups to the biennial
event and rented party space in
the infield. Many other students
made the road trip in smaller
groups or as individuals.

“‘Even the weather and an oc-
casional horse didn’t interrupt
the party,” freshman Jon Solo-
mon said. “I can see a definite
possibility of limiting Rush to a
one-day activity if it were as

good a party as Foxfield.’’

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent David Perdue called Fox-
field ‘the hugest outdoor party
I’ve ever been to, and we never
saw a horse, but we had a great
time.”

Freshman Steve Szczecinski
said it was ‘‘the biggest gather-
ing for eating, drinking and mer-
riment that I’ve ever been to. . .
and I saw a horse.’”’ Another
freshman, Jeff Lowell, said he
did notice a couple of the horse
races, which he called ‘‘good,”
but that ‘‘it seemed like a big ex-
cuse to party.”

When he thinks of Foxfield,
senior Jeff Blount said, ‘‘I just
think of a wild, colorful after-
noon of eating, drinking and lots
of fun.”

Students from other schools
also were in abundance, al-
though many University of Vir-
ginia students had made a trek
in the opposite direction to
Blacksburg for the Cavaliers’
football game against Virginia
Tech.

“It was a good chance for
students from a lot of schools to
get together,”’ said one sopho-
more. ‘‘No, we didn’t see a lot of
horses — we didn’t really care
that much about it.”’

If the Washington and Lee
faculty follows its Executive
Committee’s recommendations,
next year’s academic calendar
will retain the 12-12-6 format,
and classes will be lengthened to
55 minutes.

In a Monday meeting, the fac-
ulty EC considered the recom-
mendations of both the ad hoc
Calendar Committee and the
Committee on Registration and
Schedules, according to Dean of
Students Lewis G. John. All of
those recommendations were to
have been considered by the
University Council this after-
noon, and are scheduled to be
voted on by the entire faculty
Monday.

“The faculty was sent the
recommendations of the Calen-

 

dar Committee last spring,”
John said. Included in the pack-
age containing the calendar
committee’s recommendations
was a proposal for an alternative
calendar by Professor David G.
Elmes.

Appointed by University Pres-
ident John D. Wilson last fall, the
Calendar Committee completed
its work in the spring and
developed four recommenda-
tions: retaining the 12-12-6 calen-
dar, lengthening class periods to
55 minutes, replacing Thanks-
giving vacation with a one-week
break in October and reducing
paperwork resulting from the
present registration and
drop/add system.

The Committee on Registra-
tion and Schedules recommend-
ed that the faculty accept the
first two proposals, and the
Faculty EC’s recommendation

55-minute classes recommended

was similar.

“There was discussion,’’ said
John, who noted ‘widespread
opposition’’ to eliminating
Thanksgiving break.

“T don’t really expect much
debate myself,’’ said chemistry
Professor John H. Wise, chair-
man of the calendar committee.

Describing himself as_ the
“convener” of the University
Council, John said a faculty co-
chairman and a student co-
chairman would be elected at to-
day’s meeting. This year’s 30-
member UC, composed of 13 stu-
dents, 12 faculty members and
five administrators, has not had
the opportunity to look at or
discuss the proposals as a group.

“Because of the timing, it
makes it a bit difficult.’”’ John
said. “I couldn’t do anything un-
til after the faculty EC
meeting.”

Tailgating adds to spirit of game

A new sidelight has been add-

ed to Washington and Lee foot-

ball games this fall: pre-game
parties sponsored by the Alumni
Association on the athletic fields
above Wilson Field.

The parties, put on with the
cooperation and support of sev-
eral campus organizations, in-
cluding the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and the Student Activities
Board, resemble ‘‘tailgate’’ par-
ties at larger universities.

Two such gatherings have
been held so far and, weather
permitting, they will continue
throughout the remainder of the
Generals’ home football sch-
edule. The purpose, Alumni As-
sociation Executive Secretary
Richard B. Sessoms said, is to
provide a place for the W&L
community to meet and have fun
before watching the football
game.

Both parties have been suc-
cessful, Sessoms said. The first
was put together rather hastily,
he added, but still managed to
draw a good number of students.
The second was less well attend-
ed, but Sessoms attributed that
problem to a conflict with the
popular Foxfield horse races.

However, Sessoms added that
the idea “‘hasn’t had a fair test
yet.”

The plan for the parties, Ses-
soms continued, is to have stu-
dents meet on the fields above
Wilson Field an hour or so before
the kickoff and to have a picnic
lunch and a party. The Alumni
Association arranges live enter-
tainment at the functions, and
many fraternities have
cooperated in the effort.

In addition to increasing sup-
port for the Generals at the
games, Sessoms said another ob-
ject of the parties is to attract
alumni to the campus. “It al-
ways makes us happy when
alumni come on campus for any

reason,” he added.

Cross country downs two foes to hit 4-0 mark

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

Last Saturday the Washington
and Lee cross country team
picked up another two victories

to keep its record undefeated at °

4-0. The Generals defeated Nor-
folk State and last year’s Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Champions, Roanoke College.
The race was run on Roanoke
College’s 4.4-mile figure-eight
course. ‘‘The only problems with
the course were its eight hills
and large amounts of cow ma-
nure spread around,’’ David An-
drews said. Other members of
the team agreed that it was a

Devastating 30-9 first quarter
brings third W&L football loss

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

If you take away the opening
10 minutes of Saturday’s football
game between Washington and
Lee and Randolph-Macon Col-
lege of Ashland, the Generals
lost a hard-fought game by the
score of 19-9. Unfortunately for
W&L the first 10 minutes proved
to be much more important as
far as the outcome was concern-
ed than was the remainder of the
game.

Before the first quarter had
ended, Randolph-Macon scored
30 points against the Generals on
its way to a 49-9 victory. The win
was the first in Old Dominion
Athletic Conference competition

for the Yellow Jackets, whose |

overall record now stands at 3-1.
W&L (1-3) suffered its third con-
secutive loss and is 0-2 in the

 

short course but that the hills
made it a difficult one.

Frank Pittman won the race
for Washington and Lee in 26:22,
15 seconds ahead of second-place
finisher David Lindin (26:37) of
Roanoke. Eddie Goundry finish-

_ ed third (26:47) overall, and se-

cond for the Generals. Sixth and
seventh place went to Ted Myers
(27:11) and Andrews (27:12).
Roanoke placed five runners in
the top 12; Washington and Lee
placed eight and Norfolk State’s
first finisher was in 14th place in
28:33.

“We expected Norfolk to go
out fast,’’ Pittman said. ‘‘but

ODAC.

W&L could do no right during
the first quarter against R-M.
The Yellow Jackets recovered
two of their own kickoffs, con-
verting both into touchdowns. R-
MC quarterback Cody Dearing
had a hand in three of his team’s
four first-quarter touchdowns,
throwing a pair of scoring passes
(28 and 20 yards) to wide re-
ceiver Keith Gilliam, and runn-
ing three yards for the third.

Remon Smith also scored in the ©

first quarter for the Yellow
Jackets on a six-yard run. W&L
made matters worse for itself
when punter B.J. Sturgill was
tackled for a safety after the
snap had gone over his head into
the end zone, giving R-MC a 30-0
lead with 5 minutes remaining in
the first quarter.

they were not a factor after the

in the final score as the Generals
chalked up their second shutout
of the season, beating Norfolk
15-50.

Roanoke was a much closer
race; the Generals won by only
three points, 26-29. “It could
have gone either way between
Roanoke and W&L’”’ Andrews
said. ‘‘We quickly added up the
score at the end to check and see
if we won.”’

‘Walter Alston-type managers are forgotten

 

TIME

By Mike
Stachura

 

 

 

 

....Picking up the papers on
Monday morning, I was irritated
to read that Joe Torre had been
relieved of his managerial duties
by Atlanta’s answer to Howard
Hughes, Ted (call me “ruth-
less”) Turner. The ax-murder-
ing of Torre coupled with the fall
of Rene Lachemann in Milwau-
kee proves once again the old
adage ‘“‘If all else fails, fire the
manager.”

No, I’m not a fan of Torre. My
concern here is with the baseball
owners and their underlings. As
the trend goes toward having
front office, stuffed-shirt types
running the show, handing out
managerial pink slips like they
were sO many Domino’s Wild
Wednesday coupons, the days of
Walter Alston-type managers
and George Halas-type coaches
are gone and, for all intents and
purposes, forgotten. And that
fact, friends, is an unfortunate

turn of events.

Granted, this blame-it-on-the-
manager trend may only be a
function of the times, where if
success is not maintained or im-
proved upon, one ends up sitting
in Bob Uecker’s seats. I also ac-
cept the fact that professionals
are paid to produce. (Hint:
“Professionals” includes the
gents wearing the helmets and

past. Talent did not produce the
same results and breaks did not
go their way.

No, let’s not jump on a coach
or manager for not having his
troops on top. This unhealthy at-
titude has begun to afflict col-
lege and high school athletics, as
well. Everybody’s got to win or
they’re not doing their job. No
one interviews the coach whose

caps.)

I think the problem lies in the
short-sightedness of those pen-
cil-necked geeks doing the hiring
and firing. Torre and Lache-
mann were fired not for poor
managing, but because they
didn’t win a sufficient number of
games. (Front office cannot see
a difference between these two,
but then this is to be expected.)

What it seems wasn’t looked at

The Generals’ soccer team is
very hard to predict so far this
season, but one thing is certain
and that is the fact that they
have started their 1984 Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
season properly.

The team edged out rival
Maryville in a hard-fought con-
test by the score of 1-0 on Satur-
day and went on the road to Har-
risonburg and came away with a
3-2 overtime victory against

team went .500 on the year. The
simple truth is that this man or
woman works at least as hard as
the Joe who’s taken his team toa
fifth league title. Probably har-
der.

If we’re thinking of firing man-
agers, let’s fire them for being
bad managers (read: making
bad decisions, not having their
decisions go bad because of
something beyond their control).
Otherwise, let’s go back to our
big desks and make some deci-
sions that are within our right to

Eastern Mennonite.

The Generals now have a 3-3
record after dropping three of
their first four games. With the
week’s two wins against con-
ference foes, W&L’s ODAC mark
stands unblemished at 2-0.

In yesterday’s game against
Eastern Mennonite, the Gene-
rals got tallies from sophomore
Ken Randby and junior captain
Billy Holmes in regulation. The
winning goal in overtime came
from junior Eric Obeck.

All the Generals needed
against Maryville was a second-
half goal from Holmes, coming

If you’re listening, stuffed
shirts, let’s give coaches and
managers a chance to get estab-
lished. It’s tough to watch your
players and do your job when
you’re constantly looking over
your shoulder....

....Coming back to the Colon-
nade, a group worth your wat-
ching — as they’ll be making
headlines — is Coach Dick Mil-
ler‘s cross country team. The
harriers are off to a 4-0 start and
no one‘s been close yet. This
team has every intention of go-
ing far in 1984, and from this cor-
ner, the view is those intentions
are well-founded. ..It may sound
repetitious, but Page Remillard
has his troops on schedule again.
He seems to do it every year. No
doubt that polo will be there in
November. That 120-some miles
has been cut in half...

....G0od to see Nebraska

many other good teams (truth
should shine through this week-
end in Stillwater, OK). Texas,
however, will not fall as easily.
Watch for its clash with Mus-

tangs of SMU, though....

...Referring back to my initial
thoughts, it was a wise action by
the stuffed shirts in Baltimore to
let Messrs. Ayala, Underwood,
Singleton and Bumbry know
there’d be no more free lunches.
Excess baggage has got to go,
but more importantly manage-
ment was able to recognize ex-
cess baggage. If players con-
sisteiitly don’t produce, find
players who do. (There’s only
one manager in the game who
can hit, field and throw. The rest
aren’t paid to do that.) There
can be no panic button in mana-
gement, contrary to what cur-
rent practices show us....

...Gerry Cooney beat a no-
body decisively. Does it mean
anything? Yes. It means Gerry
Cooney beat a nobody decisive-
ly. That’s all, he’s still a nothing,
but a fourth-round KO means he

. can still throw leather. Getting

people to walk into it may be

two ODAC matches

12 minutes into the half.

Sophomore Jim Tucker had an
outstanding game at sweeper
and was named player of the
game.

' “It was not a pretty win, but it
was a win and we'll take it,”’ said
head coach Rolf Piranian on
Saturday morning’s victory.
“Everyone is pleased tostart the
ODAC season with a win.”

Stastically, the Generals look
like a team much worse than
their 3-3 record would indicate.
The team has been - outscored
22-7 in its first five games,

although that statistic is bloated
by the Generals’ disastrous
opening weekend where they
were outscored 16-1. Since then,
scoring has been even at 6-6.
Another interesting stat is that
the Generals are 2-0 within the
friendly confines of Wilson
Field, but are 1-3 on the road.
Eight players have played a part
in W&L scoring so far.

The Generals are on the road
again Saturday when they travel
to Farmville to take on the
Tigers of Hampden-Sydney in
another ODAC matchup.

Remillard says polo
is now ‘on course’

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

“‘We’re on course,”

Coach Page Remillard re-
acted by saying his team is ‘‘on
course”’ with his preseason goals
after viewing the Generals
second-place performance last
weekend at the Virginia State
Championships played in Cy
Twombly Pool.

“I’m pleased with the team’s
performance so far this year.
We’ve improved much faster
than last year’s team, but last
year’s team improved very
much at the end of the season—
when it counts,”’ Remillard said.

first game for W&L, ran nine
yards for a touchdown, cutting
the Yellow Jacket lead to 30-6.
W&L placekicker James White
added a 40-yard field goal later
in the quarter to make the half-
time score 30-9.

“In the second quarter, we
looked like the team that was
winning,” said W&L head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We were the ag-
gressor, despite being behind by
30 points.”’

Any hope of a W&L comeback

was quickly put to rest in the.

third quarter when Dearing con-
nected with Gilliam for a 70-yard
touchdown pass. Gilliam finish-
ed the game with 118 yards in
receptions on three catches, all
of which were for scores.

R-MC added two more scores,
one later in the third quarter and
the last late in the fourth quart-
er, to make the final score 49-9.

Despite the lopsided score,
Fallon said that he thought his
team played “reasonably well.”

“Our special teams put us in a
deep hole right from the start,
but I don’t think we played that
badly,” Fallon said. ‘‘We did not
quit. We showed the old W&L
spirit and enthusiasm and we
kept on hitting until the game
ended.”

W&L must regroup quickly
this week if it is going to break
its three-game losing streak
against Maryville College in
Maryville, Tenn.

“We need a shot of confidence,
but it will not be easy to find it
this week,’’ Fallon said. ‘“‘Mary-
ville is a very capable football
team. They are big and have
already beaten a good Hamp-
den-Sydney team. The game
should be a real dog fight.”’

The Generals went through the
R-MC game injury-free. Tight
end Ian Banwell and linebacker
Bob Berlin will be back in the
line-up against Maryville.

“We will not cash in the
season,” Fallon said. ““‘We have
a lot of fiber and character on
this team and I am confident
that we will get back on the win-

sing track Pessanecen ese ++ STIG

ning track.”

The Generals placed second in
last weekend’s tournament be-
hind champion Richmond. Rich-
mond defeated W&L 14-8 in the
final game.

Before losing to Richmond, the
Generals (6-7-1) defeated Vir-
ginia (9-1), Virginia Com-
monwealth (9-2), and Hampden-
Sydney (18-5). The Generals’
fourth win of the tournament
was a 5-0 forfeit over no-show
James Madison.

Tim Stanford led the Generals
in scoring with seven goals last
weekend. Freshman Simon
Perez added five tallies for the
Generals’ cause.

Remillard evaluated team de-
fense as pretty good, but added
that team offense was “terrible”
last weekend. The Generals
scored only twice on nine man-
advantage situations (22.2 per-
cent). Remillard said that if his
team is going to be competitive
then they need to score on 70 per-
cent of their penalty plays.

Hoping to improve their of-
fense the Generals have spent
most of this week working on
controlling the ball and scoring
in man-advantage situations.

In the goal last weekend, soph-
omore Jeff Cohen, playing for
the injured Kevin Davidson, pro-
vided the Generals with six
quarters of shutout play in the
shallow end.

Concerning Perez, Remillard

water polo.’

“Eric Sullivan is coming
along. He is adjusting well and

added Remillard.

Remillard described Hall as a
player who works very hard and
“plays better in games than he
does in practice.”

rhe closest game of those first eon-

Homecoming

Concert is
first event
at pavilion

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

 

A concert by the Spinners tomor-
row night kicks off W&L’s Homecom-
ing Weekend and signals the opening
of the student activities pavilion, and
a full schedule of Homecoming ac-
tivities is planned through Sunday
afternoon.

Events sponsored by the Student
Activities Board, the Alumni Asso-
ciation and the Class of 1986 will pro-
vide a backdrop for the Generals’
football game against Hampden-Syd-
ney College Saturday afternoon and
the soccer match with Gettysburg
College that morning.

Friday’s activities begin at 5 p.m.
with an alumni reception for the
Homecoming Queen and her court at
the Alumni House and continue with
a $15,000 show by the SAB in the new
pavilion, located behind Lewis Hall.
Shor Patrol will open the concert at
8:30 p.m. and will be followed on
stage by the Motown group the Spin-
ners.

Tickets for the pavilion show are $5
in advance or $6 at the door.

A main objective of the concert will
be to familiarize students with the
new pavilion, according to John Hay-
wood, SAB entertainment director.

“The success of this concert will
have a bearing on the other kinds of
concerts we have in the new pavi-
lion,”’ he said. ‘‘The SAB wants to br-
ing concerts to the students, but we
have to have their support to make
them go.”’

The SAB will have the job this
year, Haywood added, of changing
attitudes. ‘‘The average mink wants
three bands and all the beer he can
drink for three bucks,” he said. ‘“‘We
want to provide big name entertain-
ment where the focus of the concert
is the group and not the beer.”’

SAB members at the pavilion will
direct traffic, said Haywood, adding
that students should plan to car pool
because of limited parking near the
pavilion. Eventually, a 300-car park-
ing lot will be constructed at the
pavilion site,

Saturday's events lead off with the
soccer game at 10 a.m. on Wilson
Field. Afterward, the Alumni Asso-
ciation and the SAB will sponsor the
third pre-football game party and
picnic on the lacrosse practice field
near Liberty Hall.

Alumni Association Executive Sec-
retary Richard B. Sessoms said the
annual alumni picnic lunch will be in-
corporated into the ‘‘tailgate’’ party
this year. Also planned, he said, is a
jazz band on the field, beginning at
11:30.

OPINION
Honor reconsidered

Last week, a story on the front page of The Ring-tum Phi told
the plight of a University of Virginia second-year
undergraduate who had been convicted of an honor violation.
People at U.Va. hailed the verdict as one upholding the fine
Honor Code that governs student affairs.

 

Two weeks ago, another front-page story more loosely
related to honor also appeared on the front page of The Phi.
Rush violations and violators had not been reported as diligent-
ly during Rush as some had expected. Friends were reluctant
to turn in friends and fraternities were reluctant to turn in their
rivals for sins of which they also were guilty.

So, when I opened up Saturday’s Washington Post, I was both
surprised and astonished to see Jody Powell, press secretary to
President Jimmy Carter, extolling a re-evaluation of the Cadet
Honor Code at the Air Force Academy. Powell, once a cadet at
the academy, had been found guilty of cheating on a history
test in the middle of his senior year and left the acade in
disgrace. Twenty years later, he had decided to visit the cam-
pus he had left in shame.

In the column, Powell professed genuine remorse over the
affair. ‘‘It remains the one mistake, in a lifetime with at least
its share of transgressions, that I most regret — and the one
single incident that taught me most about myself and about
life.”’ But in the 20 years since his departure, the academy has
changed considerably. Women have entered the academy, but
the statement carved over the entrance gate still reads ‘‘Bring
Me Men.” The number and the quality of the applicants since
1964 has risen. Academic pressure has been heightened. To the
surprise of many, the academy weathered well the admittance
of women, although women, by both Powell’s admission and
that of administrators, still face more than their share of
pressure in an already pressure-filled atmosphere.

What bothered Powell the most about the return to Colorado
Springs, however, was the decomposition of the Cadet Honor
Code — ‘‘We will not lie, cheat, steal nor tolerate among us
those who do.”’ For Powell, the ‘“‘heart and soul of the institu-
tion, the principle that I failed to live up to’’ was in trouble. A
cheating scandal last spring showed that many cadets had par-
ticipated in questionable practices. The idea of honor had
deteriorated to such a great extent that it had become apparent
to the superindendent that he had to acknowledge and deal with
the problem. A study is currently underway examining their
Honor Code.

Such a study also is needed here. A parallel can easily be
drawn between the Air Force Academy’s problems and those
we now face at Washington and Lee. With the admission of
women and in the face of an increasing reluctance among
students to report even social infractions, we must confront our
changing view of honor and the ‘‘gentleman.”’ When, as in the
case of last year’s Executive Committee only 21 investigations
were made into alleged honor offenses with two convictions
resulting in expulsions, a serious re-examination of our system
is mandated.

The importance of the Honor System cannot be understated.
At Washington and Lee, it governs far more than our behavior
in the classroom. We are gentlemen — or at least we are sup-
posed to be — both during class and afterwards. There is, some
argue, no boundary to the Honor System. Powell hit on the im-
portance of the honor concept as he reminisced about his col-
lege days. ‘The years I spent there meant more to me than any
other period of my life, and the part that meant most was the
Honor Code that I violated. Though I fell short, thousands of
other young men did not. Their example is a continuing
reminder that human beings are capable of much finer and
better things than we generally suppose.” For Powell, as it
should be for us, the honor code was an integral part of his
education. The challenge it presented then is the same
challenge it presents today — that all of our actions — without
exception — be forthright and honest.

At Washington and Lee, we must confront the same situation
Powell’s school now examines. What is honor to this current
student generation? Do we really believe enough in the system
to report every offense? Are we afraid to report because of the
single sanction clause? Do we still believe, as Powell stated,
that ‘“‘the teaching of a higher standard, a different approach to
life itself, is essential’? Is a standard which all meet really a
standard?

Many people, especially professors, believe we students are
reluctant to turn in honor violations, especially those that are
“‘trivial.”” Perhaps we ought to consider along with the reality
of honor whether a single sanction honor system defeats it own
purpose. Would a multi-sanction honor system work at W&L?
Neighboring schools have met with some success in their
multi-sanction systems. Would we? We think not. As we begin
the transition to coeducation, though, we tread on a natural
breeding ground for consideration of such changes.

usual reading your Ring-tum Phi to-
day or if it’s dipping into your mash-
ed potatoes or flopping over into your
face, don’t worry — you haven’t lost
your coordination. The Phi’s just got-
ten bigger (in case you hadn’t noticed
by now).

Beginning with this week’s issue,
The Ring-tum Phi has switched to
what’s known as a broadsheet for-
mat. For about the last 15 years, The
Phi’s staple has been the tabloid for-
mat, five columns wide and 13 inches
tall.

This six column-by-21%-inch
broadsheet size, although making the
paper appear thinner, will give us
more room for larger pictures,
headlines and stories, thus (it is
hoped) making the newspaper more
attractive and readable.

In addition, it will enable us to
more effectively group stories of
similar interests and to more easily
compartmentalize different sections
of the paper.

As is the case with anything The
Ring-tum Phi does, we would ap
preciate your reaction to and
criticism of these changes. We hope
they are yet another step in helping
The Ring-tum Phi best serve, inform
and entertain the Washington and
Lee community. 1

 

 

Faculty: Teachers or parents?

MY VIEW
By B. Darby Brower

 

 

This year we have experienced a change in the
social life here at W&L because of decisions made
by the Student Affairs Committee of 1983-84. The
changes have been extremely unpopular— as well
as unfair —in the eyes of most students. As the
policies stand now, Wednesday night parties are
limited to the members of the fraternity and their
dates. Members of other fraternities, whether
they are friends of members of the house having
the party, are not allowed to attend. The case is
the same for independents.

This policy, therefore, leaves those students not
affiliated with that fraternity with limited options.
Other fraternities may have their own party or
they can go to the Cockpit. Independents have only
the Cockpit to turn to for student-oriented enter-
tainment. Those are the ground rules and basic
facts of our current Wednesday night social life.

In the past, many fraternities (although not all)
have complained about putting on parties for the
entire campus, which is very often the case when
only a small handful of fraternities have parties on
a Wednesday night. At the same time, the Wednes-
day parties were upsetting to several faculty
members whose class attendance Thursday morn-
ning was either very poor, or many of the students
who did attend were too tired from the night
before to contribute to or pay attention during

class. In addition, the administration was upset by
the deterioration of many houses because of the
numerous large parties.

In response to all of those inputs, the SAC made
the decision to limit individual parties to members
and dates only.

The first of many problems with that policy is
that if the members of a fraternity want to party
on Wednesday night, then they must do so in their
own house. That only creates a more constant
wear on each house, which is supposed to be a pro-
blem the administration wanted to alleviate.
Before, when two houses could go together on a
party, at least only one house took the abuse.

The next problem is that independents can only
go to the Cockpit. What if the student does not like
the blaring music, or what if there is simply no
room in the Cockpit as is often the case?

The worst part of the new policy though, is that
it limits us to when we may party with our friends.
It further separates the students during the week
at a time when so many of us enjoyed spending
time with other fraternity members and indepen-
dent friends either at our own house or at the
houses of others. In years past, most of us felt free
to wander to another house and drink a beer with
friends and talk with them in a setting outside of
the classroom.

Many faculty members say that socializing can
be accomplished during the weekend. But why
can’t we have a choice? I don’t feel it is right that I
should be expected to tell friends of mine, many of
whom have ben coming to our Wednesday parties
for the past three years, that they cannot come in-
to my house to talk and havea beer.

I realize that some of the faculty are sincere in

their concern for our academic performance while
we are here at W&L, but all students need a break
during the week to relax and stop thinking about
the books for a few hours. As a college student, I
feel that we should have the right to choose for
ourselves what we shall do when we can afford a
break and with whom we shall spend that time.

We are old enough to take the responsibility of
our academics, and even for those among us who
are not yet so responsible, will learn from their
mistakes. This includes knowing when you have
time to drink. If all of these decisions and respon-
sibilities are taken away from us, then we do not
benefit as much from a decision-making process
which should be ours in the first place. When are
we supposed to learn responsibility? Isn’t college
supposed to help prepare us for life?

Again, I stress that I seriously believe that the
faculty is truly concerned about our academic
achievements, but I feel that a vital part of every
man’s growth involves learning to answer for
himself through his display of responsibility.

It goes along with the spirit and reputation of
Washington and Lee that we are not only students,
but that we are also a part of a very unique and
special community. This community includes not
only our close friends and fellow students, but also
the faculty. The new policies partially cripple that
community spirit, in that it causes students to
have to act rudely toward one another, and makes
many students feel as though the faculty and ad-
ministration are against them or don’t have faith
in their judgment.

We all benefit much more from each other when
relations are not hindered. Allow students to
choose their own fates.

 

 

 

GREAT NEWS

 

Coed decision criticized

Editors’ Note: The following was dated
Saturday, July 14, 1984.

To the Editors:

A few hours ago I learned of the
trustees’ decision to change 235 years
of tradition at Washington and Lee
University by voting 17 to 7 in favor
of collegiate coeducation. I mourn
this decision ae I would mourn the
death of a close personal friend. The
character of Washington and Lee has
for me been a living force, its stu-
dents, faculty and alumni. The sing-
ular qualities of W&L — its size, its
notion of ‘‘work hard, play hard,’’ the
special cachet of its ‘‘gentlemen’’ —
created an academic environment
that has profoundly influenced me.
The W&L experience helped define
this young man’s goals and relation-
ships, and helped make me what it is
that I am today. In a world fraught
with inconstancy and and disquieting
bias toward a state of inert uniformi-
ty, the University’s unique aura and
traditions have provided for me a
real touchstone, as well as a sense of
continuity with my youth.

The sense of loss I now feel is ac-
companied by a sense of frustration,
and even anger. How did it come to
pass that the trustees could ignore
the 2-1 margin against coeducation in
the alumni poll and the similar mar-
gin in the student survey? Is not the
University a democratic community
of persons beyond the administration
and faculty? Why has it been that
new trustee ballots never included
the nominees’ views on important

issues such as coeducation? Indeed,
were the announced results of to-
day’s trustee vote the same as any
first balloting, and was the deck
stacked in this issue? Why did coed-
ucation suddenly become so vital to
the University’s viability, while I, as
a loyal and supportive alumnus,
learned nothing of its contemplation
until a few short months ago when
the November alumni magazine was
delivered (many weeks late, in my
case)? Furthermore, I question the
timing of the very consideration of
coeducation under the auspices of a
new president with less than two
year’s association with a heritage as
old and deep as W&L’s. How can it be
that the school is proclaimed to be at
“grave risk’ demographically when
it fails to capitalize on offers of time
and experience to assist in the pur-
suit of qualified applicants (in addi-
tion to solicitations for annual checks
and estate considerations)? Indeed,
can it be that today’s trustee vote for
coeducation is irrevocable? I feel, as
part of the W&L community’ that
many questions surrounding today’s
events should be addressed in a man-
ner completely dissimilar to the fait
accompli of coeducation.

I have and will continue to believe
that the all-men’s collegiate alter-
native is viable and valuable in
American education, and important-
ly, that this option worked at W&L.
To me, the purpose of Washington
and Lee has been to instill the ideal of
pragmatic, ethical achievement in
the University’s students. This ideal,

within the unique framework and
history of the school, translated into
the sound preparation of W&L men
for their professional and social
futures. The University I have known
fulfilled ite mission, and I truly
believe its graduates — relative to
their peers — to be both successful
and content in their lives. Unfor-
tunately, I sincerely question the
ability of the school to maintain its
traditions and the essence of its col-
legiate experience in a coed environ-
ment. There truly is a critical mass
at W&L — its 1,350 students are not
Princeton or Dartmouth or Williams
or Virginia — that supports its
“academic village,’’ its fraternities
and athletics (I personally will miss
the excitement of W&L’s national la-
crosse presence), its relations with
its neighboring schools and its other
infra-institutions. And, very impor-
tantly, I question whether a universi-
ty the size of W&L can afford the fi-
nancial disaffection of any part of its
alumni.

Sadly, I feel that a friend I knew
and supported well is passing on.
Perhaps a polite relationship with the
changed school will evolve, perhaps
not, but the W&L of 1985 will never
replace or realize the devotion and
sense of identification that I feel for
the Washington and Lee of 1749 to
1984. My memory of what has been
and my sense of what ought to be
lives on — Rest In Peace, old friend.

Not funny

To the Editors:

The front page article of the Oct. 4
issue of your publication entitled,
“Yes, wouldn’t it be funny if...”
displays a wanton disregard for
sound journalistic style in our cam:
pus newspaper.

The last hope for the continued
healthy life of liberal thought on our.
campus is embodied in the You
Democrats. Such blatant disrega.
for the policies discussed at Y.
meetings is nothing less than a
disservice to the organization involv-
ed and to journalistic excellence.

To our best knowledge and to that
of the Young Democrats and College
Republicans involved, no such
meeting was ever held at which the
topic of endorsing President Reagan
was considered. Furthermore, I (Jim
Murphy) deny ever having uttered
the words which you so generously
attribute to me (leak?) and have no
knowledge whatsoever of anyone in
my organization confusing Bozo and
Bonzo,

Yes, wouldn’t it be funny if...‘“The
Phi got the facts straight?”

Jim Murphy, President
Young Democrats

and

Patrick Hayden, Chairman
College Republicans

Corrections

Jim Murphy, president of the
Young Democrats, said he was
quoted in error in a statement attri-
buted to him on page 1 of the Oct. 4
Ring-tum Phi. The item was face-
tious in tone, but the quotation at-
tributed to Murphy was drawn from
a reporter’s news account of the en-
dorsement matter. The editors
believed the quotation was accurate
when they wrote the item and
apologize for the error.

* *

The Phi Kappa Sigma house
was warned only once, not seven
or eight times, as was reported in
the Sept. 27 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi, to reduce the level of noise
during a Sept. 15 party. Fraternity
President Jim Cobb said the
police worked with the fraternity
and the band to reduce the noise to
an “acceptable level” and that
seven or eight noise levels were
tried before an acceptable one
was reached.

Today we have a brand new race,” exclaim-
Nalter Mondale on Monday in reference to
Sunday debate. with President Reagan.
Tuesday’ s Washington Post described a jubi-
it Mondale, whose pollster, Peter Hart, after
_ tartviewing 600 viewers had found Mondale the
" nnier by a margin of 52 percent to 32 percent.
ther polls described by the newspaper show-
«a Wide Mondale lead, such as the CBS News-
New. York Times Poll, in which Mondale was
pickéd the winner over Reagan by 43 to 34 per-
cept. Others, such as an ABC News poll, showed
Mondale a victor by a narrow margin, 39 to 38
percent.
ialford Ryan, associate professor of speech at
W ashington and Lee and author of a book about
presidential rhetoric, noted significant dif-
ferenees between the candidates. He analyzed
the candidates in terms of what he called the
aracteristics necessary for good presentation:
Ability, trustworthiness, sociability, com-
sure, dynamism and outgoingness.
a:terms of credibility and trustworthiness,
an said Reagan ‘‘appeared to be more credi-
‘because he cited more statistics, more
2ts.,. He seemed to have those things at his

gertips.””

Ryan said that Mondale, on the other hand,
“seemed to rely on more emotional responses.”

However, Ryan added that Mondale’s asser-
tion at the end of the debate that the voters ‘‘still
did not know what Reagan’s tax proposal’’ was
undermined much of Reagan’s credibility and
trustworthiness.

In terms of sociability and composure, Ryan
determined that ‘‘overall, Mondale appeared to
be more composed than Reagan. Mondale
addressed the camera almost immediately after
the question.”’

“Reagan seemed to have to compose himself,
literally, before he answered some of the ques-
tions and appeared internally ill-composed bet-
ween some questions and tried to phrase his
answers,”’ the professor said.

“Reagan wasn’t up to his usual casual style,”’
Ryan noted. Mondale, he said, was more effec-
tive in portraying sociability. The professor said
Mondale was the more dynamic of the two.

“‘Mondale had a lot more gestures,” he noted.
“‘He appears to be a caring, concerned, decent
person. It was very clear that Mondale opened
up to the American people.”

Reagan, according to Ryan, was far less ex-
troverted and dynamic, and much more reserv-
ed, except when he spoke of values and patri-
otism.

Ryan described Reagan’s general speech pos-

ture as defensive. ‘Reagan looks very good
when he has a prepared script, when he has his
teleprompter in front of him,” he said. ‘‘When he
has his notes in front of him, he looks very good.”’

‘He is able to deliver the lines,’’ he continued.
“He is, after all, an actor. He’s very good at de-
livering those lines.’’

‘Ronald Reagan was really not up to his fluid
delivery,’’ he added. ‘‘There were lots of halts,
lots of pauses. That is not his usual delivery.”

Describing the candidates’ emotional appeals,
Ryan said, “It seems as if Reagan looked to the
past, and at best looked at the present. (He)
reiterated his old values, trickle-down theory,
‘what’s good with America.’ ”

Ryan said Mondale looked more to the future,
which he is in a better position to do as a chal-
lenger to the incumbent.

Finally, Ryan judged the logical appeal of the
two candidates. He said the quote that Reagan
used, ‘‘I’m running on my record, while Mondale
is running away from his,”’ will weigh heavily in
the minds of voters.

However, Mondale’s humorous quote by Will
Rogers, ‘‘It’s not what he doesn’t know that
bothers me, it’s what he knows for sure that just
ain’t so,” served a two-fold purpose. It had logi-
cal appeal, while at the same time it undermined
some of Reagan’s trustworthiness, according to
Ryan.

1 Similar offer by The Associated

.ccording to Frank Parsons, exec-

“ut as large as the dish now on the

of the University Library. That
‘is 4.6 meters in diameter.

he Mutual dish would be used to
adcast the Texaco Metropolitan
ra Series, to which WLUR, the
apus radio station, subscribes.
site plan presented by the de-
iment called for the dish to be
ed on the roof of the library.

arsons said the dish currently on
library roof had been placed to
se as little aesthetic damage as
‘ible. A second dish would likely
art from the beauty of the cam-
, and would also weaken the roof
‘cturally. Parsons sees no pro-
a,with the AP dish, which should
glaced on the roof of Reid Hall
.t the end of the calendar year.

During the 1983-84 school year,
rsens said he told Professor Ron-
‘MacDonald, then chairman of the
irnalism department, that, if ask-
he would recommend to Presi-

dent Wilson that the university not
obtain the Mutual dish.

Both Parsons and WLUR officials
said the Texaco Metropolitan Opera
Series could be received with the dish
presently in place on top of the
library. WLUR broadcasts the opera
for 12 consecutive Saturdays begin-
ning in December. Mutual will pro-
vide the boxes necessary for trans-
mission, and by pointing the library
dish at the opera satellite, WLUR will
be able to receive the Met signal.

WLUR has opera broadcasting sch-
eduled from noon to 6 p.m. for the 12
Saturdays, although classics co-di-
rector Bart Smith said the average
broadcast lasts about three hours.
WLUR originally received the Metro-
politan series over telephone lines,
and in recent years has picked up and
rebroadcast the signal from WVTF in
Blacksburg.

David Brittigan of the University
Library’s media center said the dish
can only look at one satellite at a
time. ‘We pick up all the movie chan-
nels...from a satellite,’ he added.
The only programming that will not
be available during opera broadcasts
will be the movie channels because
all other cable broadcasts come from
Lexington Cable Co.

The Mutual satellite will only carry
the opera, but has the potential to
carry additional programming at a
later date.

According to Parsons, The Amer-
ican Bar Association also has ap-
proached W&L about a satellite dish.
The: ABA apparently is anxious to
place a satellite dish somewhere in
western Virginia, although Parsons
believes some site other than the
W&L campus will be chosen.

“‘We would have to examine very
carefully our ability to hold another
antenna,”’ he said.

In a “very harmonious’’ vote, the
Washington and Lee University
faculty approved 55-minute classes
Monday as the only change in next
year’s academic calendar, according
to Dean of College John W. Elrod.

Beginning next fall, classes will
run from 8 a.m. to 5:55 p.m. The rea-
son for lengthening classes from 50 to
55 minutes is that classes starting on
the hour will simplify scheduling.

According to Elrod, the faculty
‘reaffirmed its commitment to the
12-12-6”’ calendar. ‘‘There was one
dissenting vote representing the C-
School.” he added.

The faculty also ‘‘voted very
strongly in favor of retaining three
registration periods’’ and ‘‘very
solidly” in favor of retaining
Thanksgiving break, explained the
dean,

Alcoholism

Father Joseph C. Martin, one of the
country’s leading educators on the
‘disease of alcoholism,” will present
a program titled ‘Chalk Talk’ on
Alcohol” at Washington and Lee
Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Warner Center.

Father Martin’s appearance at
W&L is being sponsored by the Stu-
dent Health Committee and funded
by W&L’s Baur Alcohol Awareness
Program.

An ordained Catholic priest from
Baltimore, Father Martin taught in
seminaries for 22 years before begin-
ning work as an educator in the field
of alcoholism in 1970. Since then he
has lectured throughout the United
States and also in Great Britain,
Europe and the Far East.

In February 1972, the U.S. Navy
made a film of Father Martin’s
“Chalk Talk on Alcohol.” That film
has become a classic in alcohol treat-

committee chairman John H. Wise
presented his committee’s report.
The Committee on Registration and
Schedules then reported, as did the
faculty Executive Committee.

“The recommendations that were
voted on were proposed by the EC,”
Elrod said. The faculty approved all
of the EC’s recommendations, which
included Sept. 2 as the first day of
freshman orientation next year.

The calendar committee’s reports,
which did not mention an opening
date for orientation, recommended
that Thanksgiving vacation be re-
placed with a break in October. It
also called for reduction of the
amount of paperwork and time in-
volved in registration, possibly
through a one-time-per-year
registration period.

Although the calendar committee’s
study resulted in only one change,
both Wise and Dean of Students
Lewis G. John say they believe the
committee did accomplish its mis-
sion.

Professor Halford Ryan

“‘We were appointed last fall and
worked until the springtime,” said
Wise. ‘‘The committee accomplished
the study.”’

“T don’t think you need a major
change, necessarily, to accomplish
something,’ John said. ‘Both stu-
dent and faculty opinion has been ex-
pressed. There’s been a close exam-
ination of the 12-12-6,”’ he said.

According to Elrod, the only real
debate was over the 12-12-6 format.
“A number of departments seem to
be struggling with this system,”
Elrod said.

Citing the physics department as
an example, Elrod explained that
some professors would like more
time to present the same amount of
material. Physics 105 and 106, lasting
a total of 24 weeks, have been length-
ened to a 30-week series of three
courses covering the same material.

Literature prize
announced today

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)
—Poet Jaroslav Seifert, a long-time
Czechoslovak dissident, at 83 today
became his country’s first winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature.

The 18-member Swedish Academy
of Letters cited Seifert, unheralded
and little-known outside his country
and Central Europe, ‘‘for his poetry
which, endowed with freshness, sen-
suality and rich inventiveness, pro-
vides a liberating image of the in-
domitable spirit and versatility of
man.”’

The prize for literature was the
first to be awarded in this year’s
series of Nobel Prizes. Last year, the
literature prize went to Briton Wil-
liam Golding, author of ‘Lord of the
Flies.”

The Norwegian Nobel Commitee
selected the Nobel Peace Prize win-
ner, and it will announce its choice
Oct. 16. Jakob Sverdrup, the commit-
tee’s secretary, said the committee
accepted a record 83 nominations for
the peace prize. Last year, the peace
prize was awarded to Lech Walesa, a
founder of Poland’s outlawed Soli-
darity labor union.

Each 1984 prize carries a record
cash stipend of 1.65 million Swedish
kronor, about $195,000.

The stage inside the student activities pavilion is three feet high, allowing most party-goers to be able to see the band.

Pavilion ‘fun facts’ abound

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Here are some fun facts about the
new pavilion to know and tell your
friends:

The new student activities pavilion
has a floor space measuring 125'2
feet long and 70 feet wide. The max-
imum legal capacity for the building
is 1255 warm bodies. That means that
for every person there are seven
square feet of space that you don’t
have to share with anyone else. So if

somebody tries to invade your space
Friday, tell them they are violating
the legal limit and to move into their
own space, unless of course you don’t
want them to move.

The stage of the pavilion is 25 feet
long and 70 feet wide (meaning of
course that it spans the entire length
of the interior structure). Another
big bonus: it’s raised three feet
above the rest of the interior floor so
everybody in the place gets a good
view of the band. (Unless of course
someone is violating your seven

Has weekend lost
some grandeur?

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

My, how times have changed...

This weekend, in case you haven't
heard (which oddly enough just
might be the case) is Homecoming
Weekend. That means a big game, a
big dance and a queen. Or used to,
anyway.

These days, however, Homecom-
ing barely elicits a raised eyebrow.
Sadly enough, this might come as a
surprise — and a disappointment —to
an illustrious group of visitors who
will attend the event this year.

The group in question is the 1934
General football squad, which is re-
turning for its 50th Homecoming An-
niversary. This marks the first year
that Washington and Lee will host
Homecoming in honor of a certain
class. From now on the class that
graduated from the university 50
years before will be invited to attend
the event.

The homecoming that these alumni
will witness this year, however, is a
far cry from the bash they threw in
1934. The football team was Southern
Conference champions that year, and
excitement for the game was at a
fever pitch.

The Generals played Virginia Tech
— a strong local foe — and handily
had “the Gobblers”’ for dinner, 13-7.

OORDLIIDDEIL aS LIL END rN hd med ha

Homecoming week was sandwiched
between contests against, believe it
or not, Princeton and Navy.

The Ring-tum Phi for Oct. 26, 1934,
proclaimed Homecoming the year’s
biggest weekend. Both Virginia sena-
tors were expected to attend, as were
20,000 visitors, alumni and fans.

This year, the football game
against Hampden-Sydney cannot
boast anywhere near the prestige
that the Tech game did. The Gene-
rals have not played ‘Big League
Football” since 1953.

Is that, though, the only reason
Homecoming has lost some of its
grandeur?

Frank Parsons. assistant to the
president, said ‘It never really had
any grandeur.”’

He said part of the problem with
having a successful Homecoming is
that only 25 percent of the school’s
alumni live in the Virginia area.

Furthermore, a couple of tradi-
tions that formerly marked Home-
coming as a special weekend have
been abandoned. Years ago, there
was a freshman pep rally, as well as
a torchlight parade before the “Big
Game.” The parade was stopped, he
said, for safety reasons.

Secondly, fraternities traditionally
decorated their houses for a contest,
but that custom died out in the late

1960s because of lack of interest.
Besides, Parsons said, the contests
were turning into “‘gross-out mat-
ches. The townspeople began com-
plaining about the obsenity factor.”

square feet of space. )

The ceiling is 24 feet high at the
sides and slopes up to 40 feet at the
center.

Besides the main floor area, there
are also a number of side rooms on
the right-hand side of the pavilion.
Some of the more mundane uses for
these rooms will be an office for the
Student Activities Board, storage for
both the SAB and the Athletic
Department, and two dressing rooms
with attached bathrooms.

More importantly, one room has a
pass-through built in, making it a
very nice bar area. Of course, no
structure built with the consumption
of beer in mind would be complete
without bathrooms. The men’s facil-
ities include three large trough
urinals provided for your privacy
and four enclosed commodes. There
are also three sinks with mirrors for
checking your coif. The young wo-
men have six different commodes to
choose from plus they get an addi-
tional sink and mirror for personal
grooming chores. By the way, both
bathrooms have exits going back into
the pavilion and outside to the gravel
area and the pine forest.

Some people may still be wonder-
ing where the pavilion is exactly
located. Well, if you couldn’t tell
from the photo on the front page,
here’s the scoop. The pavilion is
located behind the law school in an
area known as the “pine forest”
(perhaps because of all the trees
around the place).

Anyway, you drive past Woods
Creek and Lewis Hall and you keep
going past the parking lot. As you roll
on further down the road, your eyes
shall soon behold a humongous struc-
ture of green tin nestled snuggly into
the pine forest. This, my friends, is
the student activities pavilion.

OK, so now you've found the place.
Next question: where the heck do I
park my car? Well, that’s a good one.
The parking lot that is being built for
the pavilion is still under construc-
tion, so that leaves you a few options.
First, you can get there really early
and find a place in the law school
parking lot. Those will go quickly, so
don’t count on them. One quick note
before I go on: Woods Creek types
are advised to walk and not take up
the closer spaces that would be ore
convenient for those comi «, «rom
further away. Besides, the walk will
do you all good.

The next best area to park is in the
upper athletic fields by Liberty Hall.
Here is something important to re-
member if you want to save gas and
money: the exit from Liberty Hall
onto U.S. 60 will be closed to both in-
coming and outgoing traffic. This is a
very dangerous intersection and the
SAB wants to avoid having any accid-
ents. In case you were asleep during
the last couple of sentences, let me
stress that point again. Absolutely no
traffic will be allowed to enter or exit
from U.S. 60. All traffic must go
around the law school. I hope I have
made myself clear on that point.

SAB entertainment director John
Haywood encourages everyone to
carpool out to the pavilion to cut
down on the number of cars in the
area. Here’s a suggestion to the
fraternities: nothing promotes
pledge unity more than a pledge-
sponsored chauffeur service to and
from the pavilion for all interested
brothers.

While the pavilion will be ready for
use this Friday night, it will not be
totally completed. A little work still
remains to be done, and a few finish-
ing touches have to be added to final-
ly make the structure complete.
Among these little additions are
paint on the interior wall of the main
hall and the putting down of the
‘‘Mondoflex”’ floor covering. Sorry,
folks, this weekend we’ll have to par-
ty on concrete floors. We will just
have to wait to party on ‘‘Mondo-
flex.”

Haywood said the pavilion will be
open again for a concert in late Nov-
ember and will be open for a full
schedule of events after the students
return from Christmas break.

In case you were curious about
what happens to the pavilion when
there are no parties being thrown, I'll
fill you in. The athletic department
will have first dibs on the pavilion
during the week. They will use it for
team practice during inclement
weather and will also use the indoor
tennis court (I didn’t mention that
there will be an indoor tennis court in
the pavilion, did I?). Scott Beebe,
assistant superintendent of buildings
and grounds, said that student
organizations are already waiting in
line to get a chance to use the
pavilion for activities.

We hope that now you, the reader,
can be a more informed and effective
pavilion consumer.

Frats get 70%
of freshmen

8y"BILL MARTIEN
bivgt Reporter

 

A larger number of freshmen par-
ticépated in Rush and accepted bids
this fall than did so last year, accor-
ding to University figures.
‘: Through this week, 265 freshmen,
or: ZO percent of the class, have ac-
cepted bids, whereas last year at this
“time 231, or 63 percent of the class,
-had done so.

The increase can partially be at-
triduted to the low level of Rush par-
.ticipation last year.

“Traditionally, 95 percent of an in-
corfiing freshmen class would sign up
fer,open houses,”’ said Dan N. Mur-
phy, associate dean of students for

‘frafernity affairs. ‘‘Last year, 90 per-
cen} of the freshman class partici-
-octed. This year, the percentage was
back up at95.”’

There has been some talk on cam-
pus about houses giving out “‘blan-
ket” bids to increase their member-

|ship. That was said to be partly in
response to the relatively poor level
‘of. dpen house sign-up last year and
partly in anticipation of the lower
number of males in the class entering
‘next fall.

All fraternities did not take that

tack, however, and some fraternities
actually gave fewer bids this fall.

Don Wilkinson of Sigma Chi and
Mike Brooks of Sigma Phi Epsilon
both said their houses gave out a few
more bids than last year, and put the
bid level at ‘‘the mid-thirties.”’

Pat O’Connell, president of Phi
Kappa Psi, said that house gave out
about the same number of bids as
last year, as did Beta Theta Pi. Their
president, George Seavey, put the
number at about 34.

Kappa Alpha was one of the houses
bidding fewer freshmen this year, ac-
cording to president Jeff Boswell,
and he said they ‘‘expect to give even
fewer bids next year.”’

Pi Kappa Phi president Ed Buttar-
azzi said they gave 28 bids, a smaller
number than last year. Pete Detlefs
of Lambda Chi Alpha said his house
extended a lower number of bids this
year.

Gray Sanders of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon said a high acceptance rate
allowed his house to offer fewer bids
this fall than it did last year.

The number of bids given by
houses willing to provide figures
ranged from a low of 25 by Zeta Beta
Tau to a high of 40 given out by a few
fraternities.

EC gets additional
rebuttal in trials

‘By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

ithe Executive Committee will

}iavé a two-minute rebuttal state-
snegt at the end of closed honor trials,
ifa motion passed Monday is approv-
ed again next week.
«<bhe reason for the proposal is to
keep the defense from bringing up a
poirit that the EC could not refute, a
possibility that exists now because
the defense has the last word in the
trial, said Secretary Sam Dalton
arguing for the proposal.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers, the lone dissenter in the
il-l, vote, protested that the EC
should wait until it is able to judge
the effects of last year’s White Book
revisions before making additional
changes.

“I'd rather see an open trial as it is
befere we tack this on,’’ Caruthers
said.

Last year, the EC voted to allow a
law student who is not already a
member of the EC to help it in open
trials and to add the word ‘‘expelled”’
to tite transcript of a student convict-
ed ip an open trial.

The EC currently ends an open
trial with a five-minute closing state-
meat, followed by the defendant’s
five-minute statement.

Caruthers said if the EC has done
its‘ job throughout the trial it
— need more time to make its
“ease.

“The way I see it, our case should
s@nd up whether or not we have the
‘additional two minutes,”’ he added.

Hammock pointed out that the
additional time could be used only to
address points that had already been
brought up in the trial.

“Anything you use in a closing
statement or rebuttal must have
already been used as evidence,”
Hammock said.

“T think if the EC uses (the addi-
tional time) to rebut new doubts,”
first-year law representative James
Crutchfield said, “it would be
harmless and could be heipful.”’

Hammock added that the change
was fair because the burden of proof
is on the EC and because having the
additional time would give the honor
system the same format as U.S.
courts.

Sophomore and senior represen-
tatives Shayam Menon and Dave
Jonson said students they had talked
to supported the idea.

In other action, the EC gave final
approval to this year’s student body
budget after awarding the Film Soc-
iety an additional $200.

The Film Society had requested
$1,500 and received $1,000, $200 less
than it received last year.

Sophomore Jim Foley, the socie-
ty’s representative at the EC meet-
ing, reported that about $500 was
donated to the Film Society at last
weekend’s showing of ‘‘My Dinner
with Andre.”

During budget delibertaions two
weeks ago, some members of the EC
suggested that the Film Society
charge admission to its movies, but
Foley pointed out Monday night that
the films can be rented cheaper if ad-
mission is not charged.

Preparation helps W&L
meet stiff competition

of larger debate teams

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

Although not a highly publicized
organization, the Washington and
Lee debate team, which hosted a
tournament last weekend, has been
anactive part of the W&L scene since
the early 1960s.

Although similar to athletics be-
cause it is an organization engaging
in team competition with other col-
leges, debate also stresses academic
prowess necessary for preparation
and competition.

Before competition begins, teams
are given topics for the debate. One
team argues the affirmative and the
other the negative side of the issue.
Certain points are made by each
team, and it is up to the other team to
respond.

‘Preparation,’ said junior Chris
Lion, ‘‘is very important because you
don’t know what points the other
schools will be running (advoca-
ting).”’

According to Professor Halford
Ryan, coach of the W&L debate
team, “A lot of preparation is
necessary for delivering your case
and as the year evolves you have to
continually update your case.”

The three skill levels for the com-

petition are novice, no experience
necessary to participate; junior var-
sity, some college experience necess-
ary; and varsity, for personal
debates.

As they argue in competition, ‘‘the
debaters are judged on the structure
and analysis of their argument, the
quality and quantity of the evidence
they present and their oral presenta-
tion,’ said Ryan, who frequently
judges the competitions.

The W&L debaters face ‘“‘stiff’’
competition, Ryan said, against
schools that are much larger with
speech departments, speech majors
and coaching staffs.

W&L is in Region III of the national
debate teams, which includes col-
leges in Virginia, Maryland, West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and the District of Columbia.

Lion and Rich Graves will repre-
sent W&L in audience-judged de-
bates (400 to 500 people in the au-
diences) at DePaul University and
the University of Illinois later this
year, when they will present the af-
firmative opinion for the topic
“America Deserves Reagan.’’ In a
debate at all-male Wabash College in
Indiana, they will take the negative
side of the topic ‘‘Coed means No-
ed.”’

SAC to revote
on party rule

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

The Student Affairs Committee
will vote today on a motion to recon-
sider the rule prohibiting guests at
Wednesday night fraternity parties,
Executive Committee President Cole
Dawson said at Monday’s EC
meeting.

SAC chairman Lewis John. the
Dean of Students, said Dawson made
the proposal at last Thursday’s
meeting and the motion was tabled
for a week.

The rule, which restricts Wednes-
day parties to members of the frater-
nity giving the party and their dates,
was passed by the SAC last year,

Fines for
filthy frats

In response to community com-
plaints about litter from fraterni-
ty parties, the Interfraternity
Council Tuesday voted a fine of
$50 against houses whose party
trash has not been picked up by 8
a.m. the following morning.

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean
of students for fraternity affairs,
said he will make informal inspec-
tions on days following parties,
and said if he sees a problem area
he will phone the offending house.
If a complaint is registered by a
local resident, however, the fine
will go into effect.

 

 

 

GOP leads

Washington and Lee students
voting in Tuesday’s mock election
favored incumbent Republicans
Ronald Reagan and John Warner
over their Democrataic challengers
for the positions of President and
United States Senator from Virginia.

In addition, Republican challenger
Ray Garland defeated incumbent De-
mocrat Jim Olin for the seat in the
House of Representatives from Vir-
ginia’s Sixth District, which includes
Lexington.

Reagan received 88.5 percent of the
122 votes cast, to Mondale’s 11.5 per-
cent. Warner, a W&L alumnus, de-
feated Democratic challenger Edy-
the Harrison, 86.4 percent to 13.6 per-
cent. Garland won 69.3 percent of the
votes to Olin’s 30.7 percent.

B. Scott Tilley, editor of the
Washington and Lee Political Re-
view, which sponsored the mock elec-

along with several other controver-
sial rules.

Those rules came under criticism
from students two weeks ago, when
the Executive Commitee held a dis-
cussion attended by over 50 students,
as well as by John and other faculty
members of the SAC.

English Professor John Evans,
chairman of last vear’s committee
that recommended most of the
changes, said the SAC was trying to
limit Wednesday night parties be-
cause Thursday morning classes
have ‘‘almost been wrecked’’ by the
parties.

Some of the students at the discus-
sion responded that the rules pro-
mote division between fraternities
and might cause every fraternity to
have a party each Wednesday night,
since a fraternity’s members could
not attend a party otherwise.

Another reason cited for reducing
the size of Wednesday parties was
the complaints received from the
local community about the noise and
trash generated by the parties.

At Monday’s EC meeting, Dawson
read a letter from a local resident
who complained that the beer bottles
and plastic cups that line Lee Ave.
every Sunday morning were an eye-
sore for people walking down the
street toR. E. Lee Episcopal Church.

The letter, given to Dawson by
John, reported that recently the
trash has included drug parapher-
nalia and contraceptive deviccs.

The EC voted to recommend that
the Interfraternity Council hire a
person to pick up trash that accumu-
lates between fraternities after par-
ties.

Coed dorms likely; floors will separate

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Although no decision regarding
dormitory arrangements for the first
coed freshmen class at Washington
and Lee has been made, Dean Pam-
ela Simpson said the Coeducation
Steering Committee is leaning
toward coed dormitories with men
and women on separate floors.

If this particular plan is accepted,
one floor or section of Graham-Lees,
Gilliam and Davis dormitories would
be reserved for women, Ms. Simpson
said. Women probably would be
housed on the second floors of the
dormitories because security precau-
tions make it unacceptable to house
women on the ground floors, Ms.
Simpson added.

One small housing unit possibly
would be all-female, said Ms. Simp-
son, emphasizing that all the housing
plans for next year are still pre-
liminary.

Ms. Simpson said the question of
whether female undergraduates
would eventually be housed in Baker
Dormitory was undecided. Commit-
tee members are reluctant to force

law students out of Baker, but in
1986-87 housing conditions should be
especially crowded when the second
coed class enters Washington and
Lee a year before a new dormitory is
scheduled to be finished, she explain-
ed.

“That's when the crunch is going to
come. Many sophomore women will
want to live in on-campus housing,”’
Ms. Simpson said.

Generally at Washington and Lee
housing arrangements for men are
set for the first two years because 60
percent of the sophomores move
straight form the freshmen dormitor-
ies into fraternity houses. Only in the
last two years of school do most male
undergraduates begin looking for

housing on their own, Ms. Simpson
said. Consequently, many female
undergraduates probably will expect
that their housing needs will be taken
care of for two years also.

The committee also has discussed
what additional security provisions
will be needed in the freshman dor-
mitories in order to make them safe
for the women Ms. Simpson reported.

“There is a feeling on the commit-
tee that women ought to have a lock-
ed, secure floor. But we don’t want to
impose rules on the women that we
don’t on the men,”’ she said.

Ms. Simpson noted that if everyone
needed to get onto their floor, a stu-
dent would have difficulty visiting a
friend on another floor. At the same
time, however, committee members
do not want unwanted men to roam
the halls of the women’s dormitory
floors.

Ms. Simpson said that in studying
reports from other schools about how
they arranged their housing in the
first years after going coeducational,
she has concluded that problems will
arise no matter which housing plan
the committee selects. The reports
give the committee an idea of what
kind of problems they can anticipate

with different dormitory ar-
rangements, however.
She noted, for example, that

Princeton University originally had
put women in separate dormitories.
However, the women were unhappy
with this arrangement because it

isolated tnem.

Female law students also have
been a tremendous help to the com-
mittee in pointing out small problems
that the University should correct
before the first female
undergraduates arrive, she said.

“W&L is so lucky compared to
other schools that have made the
transition to coeducation. We have
the advantage of having women who
have been here as students,’’ she ad-
ded.

Women law students who spoke to
the committee pointed out that a lack
of privacy at the infirmary might
discourage female undergraduates
from using the health facilities, Ms.
Simpson said. Instead of having to
write your name and ailment on a
roster that everyone can see, as is
currently required, the law students
suggested that a person should be
able to write this information on a
private note.

Ms. Simpson said the law students
also cited problems such as the din-
ing hall menus being filled with too
much’ starchy, heavy foods that
would not appeal to women and the
mirrors in the women’s locker room
in the gymnaisum being so high that
an average-sized women can see only
the top half of her face.

Ms. Simpson said these were all lit-
tle problems that can easily be cor-
rected, but that might have been
overlooked if the law students had
not pointed them out.

Most made snide remarks about it.
Others simply shrugged it off. A
handful even approached it with
frozen blood and a white coun-
tenance. However, the question re-
mains: Why does every wide-eyed
freshman have to endure a swimm-
ing test?

The answer to that is mysteriously
elusive. As is the case with many of
Washington and Lee’s unique char-
acteristics, the ‘‘annual’’ swimming
test appears to be steeped in tradi-
tion. It has endured, certainly, but no
one seems certain how it got started
in the first place.

Astory which frequently circulates
about the swimming test is that the
Doremus family, which donated the
money for the old gym, had a son who
drowned at sea because he refused to
jump from a sinking ship into the
water to try to reach a lifeboat. The
family’s donation, therefore, was
conditional on W&L’s instituting
swimming tests for all students.

“T’ve heard that tale, but I can’t
substantiate it,’’ said William B.
Stearns, a former W&L swimming
coach.

Another story states that a swimm-
ing requirement was written into the
University original charter, but Ath-
letic Director William McHenry
pointed out that there was no pool
when that document was drawn up.

Rupert Latture, a professor emeri-
tus and member of the class of 1915,
said he believed the test arose from
the fact that W&L students used to
drown frequently in the Maury
River. The school had plaques com-
memorating some of these incidents.

However, most of this is primarily
hearsay. The most that can be said in
regard to the test is that it has been
around for a very long time. McHen-
ry, who graduated from W&L in 1954,
said he remembers taking the test.

So, why does the University still re-

quire a swimming test?
“We ieei very strongly that

mystery:

4

student should learn basic 2

techniques,”’ McHenry said.
stated further that the procedure hab
been extremely successful.

To cite an example of the test’s ef.
fectiveness, McHenry last summet
attended an advanced ROTC training
camp at Fort Bragg in North F
lina. A great deal of the training, i
said, was in the water, and those whp

. could not swim were asked to wear

white ribbon around their necks sd:
lifeguard could supervise them closg-
ly. Thirty-one Washington and
students attended the camp, three
whom had been non-swimmers prigy
to attending the university. They hag
no difficulty with the training,
McHenry said. =n

of 17 students.

Of the approximately 360 f rf

who take the test every year, only
about 30 to 35. Of those, two-thirds
simply couldn’t swim and
remaining one-third failed the ex-
amination. :
Before McHenry administers the
test each year, he emphatically asks
that those who cannot swim leave
and not attempt the test. However,
some dorm counselors say that for a
freshman trying to impress his new
classmates, it would be embarassing
to get up and leave. As a result, there
always exists the possibility that’

non-swimmer might attempt . the!

examination when he actually
shouldn’t. Such was the case with &
handful of students this year, accord-
ing to the dorm counselors.

“There is nothing I can really do
about that,’’ McHenry said. ‘They

New computers head plans
integral role for department

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

~ Perhaps it’s appropriate that a pro-
fessor who’s new to Washington and
Lee is heading a department that’s
new to Washington and Lee — com-
puter science.

That department has 43 students
and one professor— Theodore Sjoerd-
sma, who until this year headed the
800-student, 14-professor computer
science department at the University
of Iowa.

Sjoerdsma said this week he sees
his department’s purpose as two-
fold: to supply the needs of prospec-
tive majors and to act as a service to
the rest of the university.

“‘T’d like to have the department be
an integral part of the campus, the
College as we!l as the C-School,”
Sjoerdsma said.

He hopes to add advanced courses
to the curriculum and up to three in-
structors to the department over the
next two years, as well as to intro-

duce students from other disciplines
to the advantages of computers. ,

“The computer enhances many
disciplines,’ Sjoerdsma said, and
when students become aware of
what’s possible, he expects the de-
mand for courses will grow. _

Before they do, though, W&L’s pre-
sent computer system needs to be
enhanced, Sjoerdsma said. He said
he hopes to see some of that accom-
plished during this year so more ad-
vanced courses can be instituted next
year. !

And why does a small, liberal-arts
school need a computer science dé-
partment? 4

“Mainly because computers are
touching you in every part of your
life,” Sjoerdsma replied quickly.
‘*You can’t avoid it,”’

Students of the humanities, espec-
ially, need to learn the benefits gait-
ed by access to computers, he said. y

Sjoerdsma said he is looking for-

¢

d

ward “to taking (the department) _

from almost nothing to somewhere
I'd like to see it be.”’

Something in the Scottish air must
be conducive to young rock and rol-
lers, for lately that land has produced
some of the best bands. The Water-
boys and Aztec Camera have re-
leased second efforts that transcend
pop cliches and have catapulted
them into prominence on the interna-
tional scene.

They are linked in that their
leaders, both young men, are seeking
something beyond the everyday con-
cerns of most young songwriters. As
songwriter and leader of Aztec
Camera, Roddy Frame states in the
title cut, “‘Knife,’’ his search is...

“To understand that heaven,

could be anyplace at all.”

The chief differences in the two
bands are in their sonic approaches
toward achieving this ‘‘understan-
ding.”’

If you like your albums on the epic,
heroic, go-for-broke scale, then The
Waterboys’ ‘“‘A Pagan Place’ is for
you. From the opening acoustic
strumming of ‘‘a church not made
with hands” to the crashing chant of
‘‘a pagan place,’’ The Waterboys, led
by songwriter, producer and lead
singer Mike Scott, steamroll you with
musical sincerity.

Similar sonically to recent bands
like U2 and Big Country (Scotland
again!), The Waterboys opt for a
“‘big’’ sound. Organic instrumenta-
tion, most notably piano and sax-
ophone, is preferred, with repetition
of musical phrases used to reach a
crescendo. Still, the subdued ‘‘the
thrill is gone”’ is as touching an end of
a romance song as anyone’s ever
written.

It is Scott’s vocal prowess that
transforms fairly mundane lyrics in-
toa inystic search:

Concert Guild season

‘iat Ae re Ne aR
By BRUIN S. RICHARDSON III
Special to the Phi

 

The Washington and Lee Concert
Guild began its season last Wednes-
day evening with a performance of
the Richmond Sinfonia, a Chamber
orchestra from the larger Richmond
Symphony. In a return to their tradi-
tional place at the head of the Guilds
series, the Sinfonia again proved to
be popular with the crowd; a large
number of both students and mem-
bers of the community attended the
concert.

Playing a program whose flavor
was decidedly in the clean crisp har-
monies of baroque and early classi-
cal, the sinfonia, under the direction
of Jacques Houtmann, began the
evening with Handel’s Water Music
Suite No. 1 in F Major. Following this
familiar number was Mozart’s Sym-
phony No. 15, a piece written when
the composer was but 16.

Following a brief intermission,
Robert Volkmann’s Serenade No. 9
Op. 69, a composition for strings that
featured the Sinfonia’s principal
cellist, provided a reprieve from the
18th century. Although the cellist
played well, the piece was of ques-
tionable value from a compositional
standpoint.

The final selection on the program
was Haydn’s Symphony No. 92 , the
“Oxford.’’ Well played and weli
known, the piece was met with en-
thusiastic applause, which prompted
Mozart’s ‘‘Eine Kleine Nachtmusik”’
as an encore. In a setting that was
very well suited to their size, the
Richmond Sinfonia provided a fine
start to the Guild’s season.

Pianist Dorothy Lewis-Griffith will

Tickets for the concert are $4 for
adults and $2 for students and will be
available at the door. Season tickets
for the remaining six programs of the
season are still available for $15 for
adults and $6 for students.

Ms. Lewis-Griffith’s program will
include five miniatures for piano
composed by Washington and Lee
University music professor Robert
Stewart.

Other works included in the con-
cert will be from Debussy, Ravel,
Stravinsky and Chopin.

A native of High Point, N.C., Ms.
Lewis-Griffith graduated from the
Juilliard School of Music with the
bachelor’s and master’s degrees in
music and from the Peabody Conser-
vatory of Johns Hopkins University
with a doctor of musical arts de-

grees.

She studied in Paris with a Ful-
bright-Hays grant, first at the Con-
servatoire de Paris and later at the
Ecole Normale de Musique.

While in Europe, she won a prize in
the Geneva International Piano Com-
petition.

She has appeared in numerous solo
recitals at New York’s Town Hall,
the National Gallery in Washington,
the Merkin Concert Hall of the Abra-
ham Goodman House in New York
City and the American Embassy in
Paris.

She has also appeared as a soloist
with orchestras in Rio de Janeiro and
Paris and in the United States with
the North Carolina, Winston-Salem
and Atlanta Symphonies.

She currently is an associate pro-
fessor of piano and related subjects
at Valdosta State College in Georgia.

Clearly, here is a man with vision,

able attempt by The Waterboys to
distill this vision onto viny].

On the surface, Aztec Camera’s
‘Knife’ doesn’t seem as awe-
inspiring as ‘“‘A Pagan Place.’’ The
feel is airier, more open and sonical-
ly less dense. One reason is the re-
liance on leader Frame’s acoustic
guitar to flesh out much of the album.
Frame is in love with melody, and
the album is loaded with hooks.

You can hear strains of Motown,

ty comes to the fore. Like Scott, he is
a unique singer, and also like Scott,
he is a powerful interpreter of his

It was a refreshing change to
see ‘“‘Teachers.”’ This is another
movie set in an urban high school,
but it is more than just another
genre movie. ‘Teachers’ has
been called a comedy, and it is
true that this is a funny film;
‘nonetheless, I can’t consider it a
comedy , rather, it is an entertain-
ing movie with a message.

Nick Nolte plays a social studies
teacher put in the middle of a
legal suit against the school
system by one of his former
students, an illiterate high school
graduate; Jobeth Williams is
another former student, and the
lawyer for the plaintiff in the suit;
and Judd Hirsch is a former
teacher-turned-vice-principal,
now more interested in getting
students through the school than
in educating them. All around
them, you see nearly every
stereotypical character a high
school could have, plus a few
others most schools will never
see. (Richard Mulligan is a stand-

tal hospital who is mistakenly

since the band’s debut, ‘High Land,

come power, yet it has retained its
endearing quality.

Like Mike Scott, Roddy Frame is
concerned with spirituality and
religion, and whether there can be a
place for them in the modern world.
“Knife” and “A Pagan Place”’ are
the logical extensions of this concern,
and it would not be a mistake to say
that these two young men have reali-
zed themselves through their music.

All this is not to say that they are so
“heavy” as to be unlistenable to by
all but the most dedicated. Both
albums are well produced and
eminently listenable, but there is
something more in the grooves than
just ear candy, and repeated listen-

this ensemble, I couldn’t help feel-
ing that there was too much to
keep track of at times, and I felt
very much like the issue-ducking
principal in the movie.

Most important to this movie,
though, is its message that
students are in school to learn,
and that the school and the
teachers are there for the
students. “Teachers” gets this
across quite well time and time
again. In fact, if there is a major
problem with “Teachers,” it
would be overkill. Just as we are
satiated with high school
stereotypes, we are told over and
over about a teacher’s duty; at
times this borders on the sanc-
timonious.

Still, I recommend ‘‘Teachers”’
quite highly. Don’t expect to laugh
at pure fluff. Much of the humor in
“Teachers” is situational. You
can’t help but think about the
message; then again, you can’t
help but laugh at Richard
Mulligan’s character teach about
Washington crossing’ the
Delaware, either.

Q 1

‘We did all right. We did what we
had to do,’’: said head coach Page
Remillard concerning the Generals’
ndefeated weekend. W&L scored
over Lynchburg 25-15,
Washington 11-5, and James
Madison 12-3.

Remillard cited Generals Tim
Stanford, who scored 13 goals, and
Bobby Pearson, who scored 15 goals,
for outstanding play last weekend.

lhey are playing really well,” said
Remillard.

ctories

reorge

Remillard noticed improvement in ~

his team’s offense. The improvement
lies mostly in the team’s ability to
score during penalty situations. In
one game, the Generals scored eight
times in nine attempts with the man
advantage’ The eight for nine statis-
tic compares to the 22% that the Gen-
erals shot in penalty situations last
weekend.

Remillard also said that the of-
fense played patiently and read the
defense well, but that the offense still
needs to improve in those areas.

Remillard hopes that the intensity
that his team picked up last weekend
during their win streak carries over
into this coming weekend when the
Generals travel to Brown University
to play in the second half of the Varsi-
ty Invitational. The Generals will
play Army, Harvard and M.L.T.

The Tigers were shut down after

W&L was beaten in 1955, 35-7, and
did not win again until 1960, as the
Tigers, led by Jim Felty and Bill Ben-
son, would outpoint General squads,
led by Bob Funkhouser, Jack Groner
and Clark Lea, by a 3-1 margin.

In the years from 1960-62, W&L won
three straight in the series, as
General teams in those seasons roll-
ed up a record of 25-1-1.

In 1960, W&L went into the Tigers’
Death Valley — so-called because of
the difficulty for visitors to come out
with a victory — and spoiled H-SC’s
Homecoming with a 14-7 win. Charlie
Gummey ran 10 yards and Ned
Hobbs got a 29-yard pass from Doug
Martin to pace the Generals over H-
SC and their new head coach, J.
Stokeley Fulton (Saturday will be the
25th time Fulton has led the Tigers
against W&L).

The 1961 team became the best
small college team in the country and
was featured in Sports Illustrated,
but received their greatest test from
the Tigers, a 7-4 comeback victory.

Johnny McDaniel, who later
became a professor at his alma
mater, was among the team leaders
of the 1962 squad that beat H-SC, 15-6.

From 1963-78, All-Americans like
Whitey Lipscomb, Sid Kirstein, Ed
Kelly and Ray Dodson paced the
Tigers, who won 12 of the 16 games
played.

In recent years, the series has
seesawed, with W&L winning the
games from '79-’81 and H-SC winning
the last two. The most memorable
games were in ’80 when the Generals
scored 17 unanswered points in the
second half to win in front of a

, Parents’ Day crowd and in '81, the

Generals’ ODAC Championship
season, when W&L spoiled another
Tiger Homecoming by winning 7-6.

In 1984, the teams come toa crucial
mid-season contest, one that could be

a turning point for both teams. Both
are coming off big wins, and both
coaches go in with great respect for
their opponents.

“Their defenses have always been
tough against us. We expect them to
be as high as ever against us. There
is always special emotion going
against W&L,’’ H-SC head man
Fulton said.

W&L’s mentor Gary Fallon, who
has seen six previous General-Tiger
tete-a-tetes, concurs with Fulton.
“It’s going to be a real challenge.
They’ve got a lot of people back and
some fine freshmen, but I hope last
week’s win (at Maryville, 24-14) will
be the turning point for this season.”’

Fulton said he was not aware it was
Homecoming Weekend and said that
this would be an added incentive for
W&L. Fallon sees the festive
weekend as a possible deterrent, but
he said he will ask his players ‘‘to
give a good account of yourselves.”’

Whatever the case, the state’s two
bastions of the Southern gentleman
will meet once again to renew their
annual date with history on Saturday
at Wilson Field at 1:30 p.m. There is
little doubt that the 1984 contest will
live up toits storied past.

Wé&L turns

corner

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee football
team broke its three-game losing
streak Saturday when it came from
behind in the fourth quarter to defeat
Maryville, 24-14.

The Generals (2-3) scored two
touchdowns during the last five min-
utes of the game to overcome Mary-
ville’s 14-10 first-half lead.

Maryville scored the game’s first

touchdown in the first quarter when
quarterback Mike Human completed
a long drive by the Scots with a 14-
year touchdown pass to William De-
laney, The Generals were quick to
answer this score as tailback Kevin
Weaver scored the first of his two
touchdowns of the game on a 21-yard
run. After James White added the ex-
tra point, the game was tied at 7-7.
.s Maryville regained the lead early
in the second quarter when Human
found Jeff Silver for a 14-yard touch-
down pass. Human picked apart the
Generals’ secondary during the first
half, completing 12 of 15 passes for
140 yards.

With time running out in the first
half, W&L backup quarterback Jon
Thornton completed a 51-yard pass to
wide receiver Randy Brown that
moved the ball to the Maryville 13-
yard line. On the next play what ap-
peared to be a drive-ending intercep-
tion turned in the Generals’ favor as
Maryville fumbled on the return, set-
ting for a half-ending field goal at-
tempt. White was good on the 30-yard
effort, giving the momentum to the
Generals as the two teams entered
the locker rooms.

W&L dominated the second half as
the Generals’ defense shut down the
Maryville offense, allowing them on-
ly 49 yards offense and two first
downs. On offense, the Generals
moved the ball consistently against
the Scot defense but failed to score

(?),

==beats Scots

any points until late in the game. Two
W&L drives were stopped when the
Maryville defense held the Generals
on fourth-down plays deep in Scot ter-
ritory.

Following a poor punt by Maryville
in the fourth quarter, W&L put to-
gether its game-winning drive. The
Generals converted a fourth-and-one
situation inside the Maryville 10-yard
line to keep the drive alive, and
Weaver scored the go-ahead touch-
down on a 2 yard run with 4:13 re-
maining in the game. After White ad-
ded the extra point, the Generals had
the lead for the first time at 17:14.

The W&L defense stopped Mary-
ville on its next possesion, and the of-
fense again started with good field
position. W&L fullback Frank Sur-
face put the game out of reach. when
he rumbled 40 yards for his first
touchdown of the season with 2:20 re-
maining in the game, giving W&L a
24-14 lead.

The win was the first for the
Generals in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference competition. W&L is now
1-2 in ODAC play.

W&L tailback Gene Girard led the
Generals’ rushing attack with 112
yards on 31 carries. Surface had 92
yards on nine carries. Quarterback
Bobby Wilson was 8-20 for 73 yards
and no interceptions.

The General defense was led by
senior linebacker Kurt Specht who
was in on 18 tackles. Weaver did dou-
ble duty for W&L, scoring two touch-
downs as tailback and getting four
unassisted tackles and seven assists.

“The Maryville win was just what
we needed,’’ W&L head coach Gary
Fallon said. ‘‘We played well in all
departments; but what was most en-
couraging was that we played with
intensity.”

“The defense settled down after
giving up 14 first-quarter points, and
virtually shut down Maryville in the
second half.

Soccer splits two

By MICHAEL McALLISTER
Staff Reporter

‘The Washington and Lee soccer team
had worked past its slow start and
raced to a 3-0 ODAC mark, but defen-
ding conference champion Lynch-
burg slowed down the machine yes-
terday with a 3-2 victory at Wilson
Field.

W&L now stands at 3-1 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and
4-4 overall.

In what Generals’ mentor Rolf
Piranian referred to as ‘‘a key ODAC
game,’’ W&L could not generate any
‘scoring in the first half and the team
was down 3-0 at the half. W&L fought
back in the second half with goals
‘coming from Ken Randby and Billy
Holmes, but the victory was not to be.

crushed the Tigers by the wide mar-
gin of 7-0. The Generals were the
beneficiaries of a very unselfish of-
fensive performance, as five dif-
ferent players shared in the goal
scoring. Mark Sullivan and Pete Van
Son had two goals apiece, while John
Templeton, Randby and Gary Cle-
ments had one each

“We are obviously putting things
together,’’ summarized Piranian.
“The Mennonite game (3-2 win last
Wednesday) was a good character
builder because we came back and
won the game after we nearly gave it
away. Against Hampden-Sydney, we
had a great game against a very good
team.”

As part of the Homecoming Week-
end festivities; the Generals will host
Gettysburg at 10 a.m. on Wilson

big rival’ and expects a good game.

ei ’ een | eague Championship Series. It was a cute
By Mike __ Cinderelia story, but when the going got

of green. It was disappointing to see

America’s diamond sweethearts fold like

so many houses of cards, but at the same time it was reassuring to see a
team that really wanted to win, do so.

Ninety percent of the diehard Cub fans had the cork all but popped on the
champagne bottle when the Padres scored six times in the last two at-bats.
Anoccurrence that left, it seems, given the Little League errors made by the
Cubs as the game came to a climax, the darling Windy City 9 in unison with
mouths agape. And that, sports fans, is not the attitude of a winner.

The Cubbies made errors, mental and physical, that put the Hamburger
Team on the road to Detroit. First, Sutcliffe walks the lead-off man in the
bottom of the seventh. Mistake: Jim Frey does not take him out of the game.
Think, Jim. He’s been struggling and there’s no tomorrow. Even if he
weren't, a change of pace couldn’t hurt. It would at least give you a chance to
regroup. Second, a ground ball that my mother could have gloved goes
through first baseman Leon Durham’s iegs. You simply make those plays,
no questions asked. Third, Tony Gwynn hits a screamer at my former (em-
phasis here) franchise player Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg doesn’t make the
play. C’mon, man, when it’s Game 5 of the League Championship Series, you
sacrifice your life to knock down a possible run-scoring hit. If not, you don’t
belong in the World Series. Finally, the Cubbies face Gossage in the eighth
and ninth and not in either inning did the lead-off hitter attempt a bunt. You
got the lead-off man on the night before and you saw what happened. Think.

But no, the Cubs did not think. It brings to mind thoughts of last year’s
Australia’s Cup, where Dennis Conner and the Americans took an early lead
in the final race and then played not to lose rather than to win. The conse-
quences of such a gutless attitude are rather obvious.

When trouble — correction, the challenge— arose, the Cubs ran scared.
Running scared doesn’t cut it. The Padres showed what does, and that’s
meeting adversity head-on with the self-confidence that you will succeed
performing to the best of your abilities.

he real problem for the Cubs was not their opponents’ but the number of
their opponents. Most teams only have one. The Cubs on Sunday had two.
The Padres and themselves....

...Back down on the Colonnade, there are signs that Homecoming
Weekend will not be as devastating as it looked a few weeks ago. The
Generals, thanks in large part to the tremendous effort of their defense,
came to life in the fourth quarter last Saturday in Tennessee and beat a team
that has a 13-7 win over the uninvited and always obnoxious Squidmongers.
H-SC will unquestionably be up for this contest, but I saw last weekend as a
turning point. A win here would solidify W&L’s direction for the rest of the
season... Cross country is at 6-0 and still counting...

....Let’s talk announcers. First, the best in any game right now is Bob
Kostas with NBC. Keith Jackson is the best college football man ever.
(Watch Saturday’s Texas-Oklahoma fest to see what I mean). And one other
thing, as annoying as Howard is, it was good to hear him in the booth for the
American League Series. He’s grating, kind of like a bad commercial, but
we realize it wouldn’t be half as fun without him, even if we are laughing at
him...

....Finally, something you might have missed at the championship series
and the World Series. The Commissioner, the new guy Peter Ueberroth, is
doing his job. What a difference a year makes. No shots of Bowie in the rain
or cold, It won’t be like a World Series, and isn’t that a relief...

Dawson gives views on honor, parties

Following is an edited transcript of a conversation
Monday among Executive Committee President Cole
Dawson and Ring-tum Phi chief editors Mike Allen
and Bruce Potter. Dawson is a senior economics ma-
jor from Houston who plans to attend law school.

Q. Toward the end of last year, there was some
controversy about the honor system — changes
that had been made with it and perhaps some
dissatisfaction with what had happened at some
open trials. What is your perception of how this
year’s student body looks at the honor system
—has there been a change over the summer?

A. I think there is definitely a different perspec-
tive this year toward the honor system, and a lot
of that may come through freshmen because the
freshman honor orientation program went ex-
tremely well. It was held out at Liberty Hall,
where there was a very relaxed atmosphere, and
everybody really got a lot out of it. I had
freshmen come up to me during Rush and they
said how well they thought it went and they
couldn’t believe we had such a strong honor
system — they’d never seen anything like this
before. At the high school they came from, there
was no conception of an honor system. Also, the
first year law orientation this year was a lot
stronger than it’s been in the past. Beau Dudley,
who is an alumnus of the undergraduate and law

schools and was president of the student body in
his third year of law school, spoke to them about
how the honor system has implications in the real
world, the tangible and intangible concepts that
go along with the honor system in the real world
and how it really and truly has affected his life.

Q. A lot of law students complain that they have
a professional code of ethics that makes the honor
system unnecessary.

A. He talked about legal ethics and how it’s
really pertinent to the real world and that the
things that go on in the honor system are parallel
to how ideally you should act in the real world.

Also, last year was such a controversial year,
with coeducation and other issues, people were
just relieved to end the year. I think Bob Jenevein
did an excellent job last year. I think Bob’s inten-
tions were a hundred percent behind the honor
system and the traditions at W&L. But I think he
went to extreme lengths to implement those feel-
ings.

Q. Other than the freshman orientation at
Liberty Hall and the orientation for first year law
students, what have you and the new Executive
Committee done to relieve some of the controver-
sy you said was felt toward the end of last year?

A. We've tried to come across with a very
cooperative attitude. We don’t want to seem

pushy. The White Book revision (allowing the EC
additional rebuttal time at open honor trials) is
going to help the honor system and we let it sit out
in front of the student body for three weeks to get
their input. We went to extreme measures to
make sure that everybody knew what was going
on. We didn’t pass it one week and the next week
quickly get it in the White Book.

We're trying to get more involved in the com-
munity. Alcohol Awareness Week is going to be a
big program put on by us. Also, sponsoring that
career symposium was a big thing that carried
over from last spring.

Q. How does the honor system become
strengthened? Is there any way to tell that the
honor system is stronger? Is it an increased
number of people kicked out, or is that not the
best way to measure it?

A. Not at all. I think the best way to judge
whether the honor system is strengthened is by
the way the honor system is perceived out there
— in the fraternity houses, on campus — and how
people express their feelings toward the honor
system, whether they’re positive or negative. A
lot of that comes through the Executive Commit-
tee and whether the Executive Committee has

night. ‘“‘I came to a new understand-
ing today. I had misunderstood what
I was told before.”’

Plante added that Simpson said she
“should be very careful’ in talking
with the press. Plante said she was
also told to ‘keep my agreement with

response time

The Executive Committee will
get an extra two-minute rebuttal
at the end of open honor trials, ac-
cording to a White Book revision
given final approval by the com-
mittee Monday night.

The resolution gives the EC two
minutes to rebut the defendant’s
five-minute closing statement,
which follows the EC’s five-
minute closing statement at the
end of open honor trials.

Secretary Sam Dalton, the only
EC member who reported student
opposition to the motion, said
another senior told him that stu-
dents saw the EC as only trying to
ensure it can get convictions in
open honor trials.

Sophomore representative An-
drew Caruthers voted against the
motion, as he did last week when
it was initially proposed. Fresh-
man representative Brandt Wood
abstained.

“The reputation of the EC is
more important than a technical
change,” said Caruthers.

Alcoholism educator Father Joseph C. Martin told a
Warner Center crowd Tuesday that ‘‘a lot of the time,
when you drink, you don’t even think about the fact that
you're playing Russian roulette with your life.”’

Martin, an internationally-recognized lecturer and
the creator of the film classic ‘‘Chalk Talk on Alcohol,”
added that ‘‘most drinking that is done after high school
is because it is the macho thing to do or the sophisti-
cated thing to do.”

Scattering ‘‘old AA stories’’ throughout his 90-minute
presentation, the Baltimore native described himself as
an alcoholic who has been treated. ‘‘Once contracted, it
is not lost until death — there is no cure,” he said. “It
also gets worse until death.”

“Everybody’s got theories about drinking, and we
usually share our misconceptions over a few drinks,”’
he said.

One of those myths is that alcoholism is symptomatic,
a symptom of a deeper underlying cause. That misses
the point, said Martin: ‘‘Knowledge of cause never did
anything for anybody.”’

“It’s not a stimulant,’’ he added, addressing another
common misconception. ‘‘People think it is because of
the crazy things they do when they drink it.’’

“Alcohol does not stimulate sexually,’’ he continued.
“What it does is knock out control over what’s already
there.”’

Martin called alcoholism a ‘‘peculiar disease’’ that is
the only ‘‘terminal illness...we joke about.’’ He said he
attempts to find a bit of the comic in the tragic with his
presentations.

For example, he warned the female members of his
Lexington crowd that they were crazy if they went out
will men wno nad been drinking. ‘‘People don t cause

accidents,’’ he admonished. ‘‘Accidents cause people.”’
People drink, Martin said, for a variety of reasons.
One is that ‘it’s a ‘big people’ drink — in tact, the law
won't allow us to drink it until we reach a certain age.”
Martin also said it’s done for social reasons —
“Alcohol has been called a social lubricant, and most
people are easier to take when they're well-oiled.”’

Drinking is also a matter of custom. ‘We drink
alcohol at births, deaths, weddings, wakes...Mondays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays...,’’ he teased.

“We drink booze because it makes us feel good.
There’s no mystery to that,’’ the speaker added.
“Alcohol is definitely a painkiller. We say kiddingly,
‘You were feeling no pain last night,’ but it’s true.”

Shifting gears, Martin said that ‘‘alcohol kills by the
ton on the highway.”

“Your drinking is your own business; your driving is
your own business,” he said. ‘‘But if you combine them,
now, by God, it’s my business, because now it’s a threat
to my life.”

“It is physically impossible to drive while your brain

is drugged and not be affected by it,’’ he said. ‘‘I believe
that driving in a drugged condition is a breach of cons-
cience.”’

Martin said that determining whether someone is an
alcoholic is not a complex question. ‘‘An alcoholic is
someone whose drinking causes problems,” he said.
‘‘What causes problems, is one

“If your drinking is making trouble and you want to
stop the trouble, stop drinking.”’

“If you're worried about your drinking, it’s a classic
case of where there’s smoke, there's fire,’’ he said
“You don’t worry about non-problems.”’

‘Ask yourself if you've ever drunk more than you
determined you were going to drink,’ he added. “If
your answer is yes, you may be an alcoholic.’

Advice for advisers

This Monday, students will begin registering for the Winter
Term. While freshmen may not realize the importance of
registering for classes, they — like all upperclassmen — will
find the choices great, the desire lacking and the faculty ad-
visers busy.

Faculty advisers are the most important people in the
registration process, yet for many students, the faculty ad-
viser is unhelpful, unconcerned and unavailable.

Nothing can be done about student apathy toward registra-
tion. Nothing can be done to make the desisions any easier.
But something can be done about faculty advisers.

All too often, students during this week are greeted in their
faculty adviser’s office by ‘“‘Gee, I haven’t seen you since
orientation’ (or ‘last spring,’’ in the case of upper-
classmen). That is the fault of the student. Faculty advisers
are available daily for student consultation. But the case of
the student seeking advice only to find unreasonable office
hours or no office hours is prevalent also.

The Sept. 26 issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education
featured an article on advisers. Author Victor Cahn noted
that ‘‘of all the assignments a college teacher faces, none
tends to be more casually discharged than advising students
about their academic program... But advising is too impor-
tant not to be carried out more diligently. In fact, perhaps
more than any other pedagogic task, it reflects a teacher’s
view of the value and purpose of a college education.”’ That is
pretty heady stuff.

At W&L, there are those few — and a rotten apple, indeed,
spoils the barrel — who serve not as active participants in the
class selection process but as passive purveyors of class
cards. They reduce themselves and thus their Ph.D.s, for all
they are worth, to the minor task of stamping schedule cards
and casual conversation.

Faculty advisers ought to take their responsibilities more
seiously. They have the obligation to emphasize the value of
certain classes or disciplines and broadening concerns. ‘‘If
we,’’ wrote Cahn, a professor at Skidmore College, ‘‘have
convictions about what education should entail, then at these
private conferences we have the responsibility to say so. To
do less is professional cowardice and a disservice to our
students.”

Notes from the editors

The arrival of women at Washington and Lee means a lot
more than the addition of a few bathrooms. Most organiza-
tions will have to rethink their policies and practices in light
of this fundamental change in the character of the institution.

The Ring-tum Phi is no exception. We welcome the addition
of women to the student body, and we’re striving to make the
adjustments necessary to serve that new audience.

The practice at most newspapers, including The Ring-tum
Phi, is to identify women on second reference as Miss Smith,
Mrs. Green or Ms. Jones. Standard procedure is for the re-

porter to ask the subject of a story which of the courtesy titles ©

she prefers.

The Phi is reluctantly but not grudgingly abandoning the
practice.

This week we had occasion to do our first major story about
a woman student enrolled at W&L. A member of the staff
raised the point that many women students are likely to be of-
fended by the policy. We talked with a number of women and
professors about the matter, and there was universal agree-
ment that courtesy titles are an anachronism that should be
dropped. There are only W&L students, they argue — not
male W&L students and female W&L students. Even our
typesetters complain about the use of the tities. One pro-
fessor suggested that if we continued the practice when
females arrived on campus, we’d be strung up in the quad
—and not by our toes.

We think the titles are a nice anachronism. We open doors
for women, we give up our seats to women and we stand when
they enter the room. We do these things out of respect, not
condescension. To us, they are acts of esteem, not
chauvinism. They’re just things that a gentleman does. But
perhaps we, like the school, need to come into the 20th cen-
tury.

Apparently chivalry is dead. It’s painful to be one of the the
pallbearers, but from now on, on second reference women
will be referred to in The Phi simply by their last names.

We think they’re entitled.

The editors wish to formally disassociate themselves from
the Canterbury Fellowship advertisement on page 4. We
realize that the wording of the message and the use of the
Christ image in that way may offend some readers. We also
recognize that some readers may object both to the nature of
the ad and to having any group’s views held up to ridicule.
In balancing the Canterbury Fellowship’s right to air its
views and our readers’ right not to be subjected to material
that may insult their convictions, we felt that as a newspaper
for the entire community we should err on the side of
freedom of expression.

MY VIEW

By B. Scott Tilley

  

 

I have no great love for Hampden-Sydney
students.

I used to have a certain respect for them,
though — a respect born out of certain innate
characteristics that I believed they possessed and
that I envied for Washington and Lee.

All of that changed this past weekend.

It is hard tosay what brought about the change.
Part of it was the football game, another part was
a friend at Hampden-Sydney sending me their
guide to etiquette for students.

For years and years, The Phi, student govern-
ment, the faculty and countless others have be-
moaned the student apathy at Washington and
Lee. Last year, student apathy had reached an
apparent pinnacle.

It was obvious — at football and basketball
games with smaller attendances than those of our
high school J.V. games, at an embarrassingly low
turnout at the school-wide Omicron Delta Kappa
convocation on General Lee’s birthday, in many
facets of school spirit.

The Executive Committee, led by Bob Jene-

vein, recognized this and made a noble effort to.

draw out that dormant school spirit. Unfortunate-
ly, all that is now remembered of that effort is the
“Great Tie Fiasco.’’ In retrospect, maybe an ef-
fort to artifically add class to the student body
while restoring enthusiasm and school spirit was
doomed to fail. Still, it was a valiant effort.

But that was what I had always heard about H-

SC, until this weekend. It seemed to be a highly
respected school, everyone talking about stu-
dents’ manners, their dress, their school spirit,
their class. Yes, it was supposedly a classy stu-
dent body. And don’t forget polite — much more
polite than those animals at W&L.

And I had seen it myself — their whole student
body turning out for football games, ardent
school spirit bordering on unhealthy obsession,
and khakis and ties present almost to the point of
monotony, yet adding an inexplicable class to the
institution from Farmville.

After the heart-felt debate on coeducation last
year, the love of our University by our student
body was apparent. But I have struggled with the
same question many others have: Why isn’t it
more visible?

To this end I tried to determine exactly why it is
visible at a school like Hampden-Sydney. What I
found stunned me. It was contained in the book,
“To Manner Born, To Manners Bred: A Hip-
pocket Guide to Etiquette for the Hampden-
Sydney Man.”’

And we thought ties to class were artificial! If
the only path to school spirit is through something
like this, I’m glad W&L passed.

If H-SC’s manners book were a joke, like ‘‘The
Preppy Handbook,’’ I would feel better. But it
purports to be serious. Students read it, and are
encouraged (Read: required) to abide by it. It
gives rules of proper etiquette in dress, introduc-
tions, food, drink, even how to hold silverware.

It reminds you that at cooktail parties, ‘‘two
traditional taboos are politics and religion,’’ and
that ‘‘ethnic, racial, or religious jokes are always
in bad taste.’’ And, don’t forget that an ‘‘engrav-
ed invitation to the Governor’s Mansion, the
White House or Buckingham Palace, obviously

Miss Manners goes to Hampden-Sydney .

Maybe they should read the foreword, a re-
minder that ‘Arrogance, or the presumption of
privilege, is the purest of bad manners.” ?

Returning to the point at hand, the guide also
tells students that ‘‘at Hampden-Sydney a jacket
and tie are traditional (Read: required) at foot-
ball games.”

Maybe we desire class and school spirit at
W&L. But I also do not want it if the only way to
achieve it is with a coded list such as Hampden-
Sydney’s. We decided last year that we did not
want a return to the assimilation code. s

This weekend provided a glimpse of hope,
though I don’t remember when Wilson Field has _
been that packed during my first three years at: '
W&L. At the risk of sounding silly, I must also ad-
mit that I got shivers up my spine when the band
played the “W&L Swing.’’ As the crowd got °
caught up in the electricity of enthusiasm, people _
sang along, the PiPhis waved their blue and white
handkerchiefs, and for one brief moment we were *
all showing a special feeling — a pride in ,
Washington and Lee.

The band is a neat touch at football games. I -
would like to see more people learn the words to
the Swing, though. I would also like to see guys _
keep wearing ties to football games. The pre-
game parties and tail-gating on the upper field .
have also helped to restore an interest in Satur-
days at Wilson Field. Maybe that interest will
grow until we start staying at games for the dura- ~
tion rather than leaving at halftime.

I hope that all of these will continue, that there
will be a resurgence of school spirit here at
General Lee’s College. But if it happens, let it not
be because it is mandatory and written in a little
brown book. Let it be because it comes naturally
out of a love for W&L.

How (not?) to prepare for midterms EC rep says

OUR VIEW

By Mike McAlevey
and Scott Henderson

 

It’s that time again. Midterms
have rolled around and certainly
there will exist that handful — or
more likely, campus full — of pro-
crastinators that find themselves
neck deep in test material. How do
we handle these mountainous loads
of tribulation? It is our view that
several modes exist.

Probably one of the more promi-
nent factions, and undoubtedly the
one Scott subscribes to, is the all-
night club. These die-hard A-seekers
can be characterized by a gradual
metamorphosis that usually begins a
little after the pre-test day dinner.
After a brief shower, these eager
beavers confidently stroll into the
library, ready to attack the insur-
mountable load that lies ahead with
the zeal of a female Fancy Dress bid
seeker.

At this point, he will demonstrate
joviality and self-assurance, casually
talking to passers-by, taking occas-
ional food breaks and maybe even
getting a little of the material out of
the way. By about midnight, doubt
has set in. This stage is marked by
loss of several outer garments, beads
of sweat on the brow and a pile of hair
off to one side of the notebook that
resembles a rodent of size propor-
tional to the amount of material yet
to be covered.

By 3 a.m., panic has sloughed off to
lethargy and it’s time for a rejuven-
ating cup of coffee or (a) coke. Hell,
if one cup will keep him awake for a
half hour, just think what six or seven
cups will do. The ensuing 45-minute

ay ystH

fiasco usually entails athletic feats,
such as the five-floor stair marathon,
the middle aisle 40-shelf dash and a
few games of wadded cold test
basketball that would undoubtedly
spark the interest of any hustle-
conscious coach.

And then depression and fatigue
set in. The eyes strain as the written
word changes form and meaning
after numerous readings. Babbling
uncontrollably and incoherently
from caffeine, he spins forth a half-
awake, ruthless attack on everyone
from the torturous professor that
made such unreasonable demands to
the homosexual that keeps casually
shuffling by the afflicted’s carrel
with lustful eyes that just won’t allow
him to concentrate.

By morning, the individual can be
easily discerned among a crowd as
he who reeks like a four-day dead
highway skunk and exhibits bald pat-
ches suggesting radiation exposure,
a redness of eyes indicative of satan-
ic possession and an untold number
of forehead bruises and puncture
wounds from dozing off into blunt ob-
jects and pencils. The outcome of the
test is academic, pardon the pun.

Another approach is the ‘‘There’s
no hope, I may as well bag it’’ phil-
osophy. This individual, depending
upon his aspirations for graduation
and obtaining a reasonable GPA,
may take several different routes.
For one, he may attempt to drown his
hurt puppy-face conscience in
amounts of alcoho! that could wash
away or at least stupify the entire
population of India.

Another, less self-injurious, ap-
proach is to head down the road and
hope to lasso some patronizing heifer
that will perform acts at unimag-

    
 

 

 

 

 

 

inable self-degradation in order to
boost her man’s plummeting ego.
Then there is the case of he who
wallows in self pity, exalting the
shame he has exacted on his family
and friends, sure that the world will
stop revolving at any moment unless
out of dignity and duty, he ends it all
by subjecting himself to local fast
food, the analog to Socrates’ hem-
lock.

It would not be just were we not to
mention the few, the proud, the ones
most of us hate, the diligent. All-
nighters are scoffed at, being reserv-
ed for those crickets in the cold that
have carelessly and idly fiddled their
time away or the little pigs that will
be chomped by the wolvish fangs of
tomorrow’s test because of their
hastily constructed test preparation.
These well briefed scholars are the
ones. Leafing through their thrice-
copied, immaculately organized
notes, they bear a smugness of
expression and anticipate a good
night of sleep while our Bruce Jenner
Maxwell House man sweats himself
into premature balding and
ulcerated oblivion. Our ‘‘bag it’ boy
wallows in alcoholic numbness, bo-
vine lechery or brutal self-brand-
ishment, depending on his individual
disposition. By midnight, the in-
dustrious student will return home to
get a good night’s sleep before the
test. Come morning, he may non-
chalantly browse through his notes
before a healthy breakfast.

Finally, the motley bunch will as-
semble. From the neatly dressed stu-
dent grinning wryly with two well-
sharpened number two pencils on
hand, to the slumbering mass of
nondescript human flesh in the back
of the room, it is midterm time.

police are

very flexible —

To the Editors: .
I am writing this letter in reference
to the student-held attitude that the
police are constantly ‘‘out to get’
Washington and Lee students.
Upon my arrival to W&L, I, and
many other freshmen, heard through
the grapevine the popular rumor that
we should beware of the student-hun-
gry police officers who had been
waiting all summer to hassle W&L
studets. Yet, I haven’t found it to be
true. I am not saying that some indi-
viduals aren’t hassled, but the over-
all attitude of the police department
is quite different from the view ‘of
many students. a
While recently on assignment for
the Executive Committee, I spoke
with Sgt. Richard Rice of the police
department. Sgt. Rice offered his
assistance for the upcoming Alcohol
Awareness Week, saying the depart-
ment is eager to help and inform the
W&L community. Upon hearing of
the attitude of many of the students;
Sgt. Rice said, ‘The police depart-
ment respects and protects W&L stu-
dents and is often more lenient on
social functions than many townsfolk
would like.”’ >
I was impressed with the officer’s
remarks and hope the W&L students
will realize that police try to be flexi-
ble, and that the department’s job of
maintaining an agreeable atmos-
phere for everyone in the community
is not an easy one. t

credibility and whether students
respect the system the Executive
Committee is trying to promote on
campus. So far, I think that it’s come
across really well.

Q. What you’re saying about the
fraternity houses and campus is true.

' Two years ago, people did not talk

, about exams. Last year, they did.
It'll be interesting to see what hap-
pens this year.

A. We are going to stress the con-
cept that nobody talk about exams
during the exam period at all

, whether it was easy, hard, with
people who aren’t in the class,

‘anything. If need be, we'll pull

, somebody in here.

' Q. Obviously you feel that the
perception of the honor system has

, declined recently, maybe even going
back a long way. Why and how has it

" been allowed to decline?

.. A. The 60s and early 70s were pro-
bably the roughest times for the
honor system, during those really
rebellious times. Now it seems we’re
heading back toward a very conser-
‘vative feeling in America in general

— in the way people dress, the way

“people act, the goals people are set-

‘ting for themselves. It seems to me
that the honor system will strengthen
along with that. I think that last year,

‘ unfortunately, hurt the honor system

_ a lot because of the open hearing sit-

uation, with people getting off in the

open hearings. Students would go in

, and they would say, “That guy is

‘guilty and I can’t believe they’re

going to let him off.’ When people

_ think that, then they think no matter

"what they turn into the EC, it’s going

ing and the randomly-selected stu-
dent body jury and they’re going to
get off.

New general education re-
quirements affecting this year’s
freshman class were a response to a
‘general awareness that high schools
.are not preparing students as they
once did, according to the committee

‘that recommended the revisions.
- But that return to ‘‘traditional”’
subjects has generated differences of
opinion among members of the class
-of 1988.

Freshman Bill Payne, for exam-
ple, considered the effects of the new
‘requirements on students’ grades. ‘‘I
\think people have problems with cer-
tain subjects,” he said. ‘‘It’s a strug-
‘gle to take all these basic classes.”’

According to another freshman,
.Norm Sigler, however, college is a
place for liberal arts. Sigler believes
‘that a basic knowledge of a variety of
subjects is “necessary to be success-
ful’ and that the general education
‘requirements provide a ‘‘broader
,aspect of what college offers.’

Breadth, according to Professor
‘Sidney Coulling, chairman of the
“special committee, is one of the re-
_ quirements for a liberal education.

To satisfy this requirement, the
Committee on General Education re-
. commended that students be profici-
ent in the humanities, both natural
‘arid social sciences and math-
eratics.

__'The committee began developing
its proposals in the fall of 1981, short-
ly: after its appointment by then-
President Robert E. R. Huntley. Pro-
fessors Coulling, William Buchanan,

’ Al Gordon, Edward Hamer, Bruce

_ Herrick, Leonard Jarrard, John Jen-
nigs, Robert McAhren, William Ses-
sions and H.1’, Williams, assisted by

Pr Deans Edward Atwood and William
Watt, met regularly throughout that

' academic year and reported their
final proposal, which passed the com-
mittee unanimously, to the faculty in
April of 1982.

.,At a special faculty meeting in
March 1983, the new curriculum was
approved by a two-to-one margin.

. Coulling noted that one major point
of the new curriculum is not to re-
quire specific courses but to require
proficiency.

For example, the six required
eredits in literature may be fulfilled

Resume help available

closed hearing activity has there
been this year?

A. It has been an average year.

Q. Last year the main topic of con-
versation around here was coeduca-
tion and this year for a while it was
Lisa Birnbach, but now it seems to be
a perceived rift between the students
and the administration over the new
social rules. How deep is that rift — is

 

“The administration
definitely does have
our best interest in
min

 

it real? Do people think it’s worse
than it is?

A. I’ve thought about that a lot.
From what I perceive, people don’t
believe that the administration has
the students’ best interests in mind
as far as what will perpetuate a well-
rounded character of W&L. They per-
ceive that they’re bringing on
coeducation and bringing all these

rules on and trying to make our stu-
dent body more intellectual. W&L
has always fostered a well-rounded
atmosphere and it’s produced the
movers and shakers in society and in
the world and in our community. Stu-
dents perceive that the adminis-
tration is trying to get away from
that and trying to apply too much
academic pressure.

But I don’t think that’s the case at
all. I think the administration defin-
itely does have our best interests in
mind. If you think about it, by the
time you get to be a senior, you’re so
paranoid about getting a job that
you’re going, “‘Why are my grades
not better? I’ve got to get more in-
volved on campus. Why haven’t I
done these things?’’ Well, the ad-
ministration sees these problems.
They may not have the best solution,
but they’ve come up with the one that
they’ve rationalized to be the best.

The weekend party restriction
won’t change things that much. The
Wednesday night party situation will.
From what I’ve seen, people have
been receptive and have cooperated
with the rule. They don’t like it, but I
think the fraternities are abiding by
it for the most part.

Q. You say people think the ad-
ministration is trying to make us
more academically intense.
Eventually we have to confront the
question: Are we an institution of
higher learning, or are we a country
club? Is it possible to be both?

A. I don’t think that you want to
have a country club atmosphere and
I don’t think you want just an intel-
lectual atmosphere. I think that
there’s a compromise and there’s a
middle of the road that you do want.

Q. Do we study too much?

A. Or do we not study enough? It’s
up to the individual. I think I found
my happy medium, and I think I’m
getting the most out of my W&L ex-
perience.

Q. You point out that in fact the im-
pact of these rules may not be that
great, but they’re perceived as being

very serious. Do you think that it’s
possible that the Hill could take even
more severe measures?

A. If students choose to ignore the
rules blatantly, I think the faculty
and the administration will take a
strong stand to correct what they
perceive as a problem.

Q. Are students ignoring the rules?

A. Not that I’ve seen. I don’t think
that they’re ignoring them.

Q. It has been suggested that if
things continue down the road
they’re going, eventually the frater-
nities will just be eliminated. That’s
something you want to avoid, I take
it.

A. Getting rid of the fraternities?
Absolutely. I don’t want to get rid of
the fraternities. I think the frater-
nities play a central role in the Wash-
ington and Lee experience — I think
they always have, and I think they’ve
been an important part of the school.
They lend part of the character to the
W&L atmosphere. You know the old
adage, ‘“‘We work hard, we play
hard.”’

Q. Yes, but Cole, do we work
hard?

A. You’re always going to have
your people who play too hard, and
you’re always going to have your
people who work too hard and then
you’re going to have your people in
the middle. Which way is it now? I’m
not sure. I think that there needs to
be a serious attitude toward study-
ing. I think that students need to get a
grip and get serious. They have their
futures to think about ané they need
to prepare. I think people who come
to this school and play hard and don’t
do well academically are really miss-
ing out and they’re missing the point
of the W&L education. There’s such
an opportunity to learn in this school.
One thing that is so obvious to me

about this campus is the quality of
the people admitted. Even the people
who don’t do well academically are
smart.

Q. What is the best way for
students to realize that potential — to

prepare themselves for the real
world and make the most of the W&L
experience? Is it to party hard?

A. I think it’s to study extremely
hard on the weekdays. To go out and
socialize on Wednesday nights
releases a lot of the tension. When
you release that tension, you can be
more comfortable studying harder
because you know that every couple

 

“The fraternities
play a central role in
the Washington and
Lee experience.”’

 

of days you’ll have the chance to go
out and have a good time. Especially
with the all-male character of W&L, I
think that’s been important. When
coeducation comes, you're going to
be able to socialize while studying’
over in the C-School, in the library or
whatever and a lot of the tension will
be released that way. But now I think
it’s important to have that break

midweek and on the weekends.

I think also athletics play a very
important part in the W&L experi-
ence. You should take advantage of it
while you’re here — IMs or varsity
sports — because we’re not so big
that it prohibits anybody to par-
ticipate.

Q. We talked earlier about some of
the things the EC has done right this
year. What mistakes have you
made? What have you done wrong
80 far this year?

A. None of the decisions that I have
made so far this year have been rash
decisions. I think my decisions have
been thought out, have been carried
through as what I perceived to be the
correct solution to a problem. Some
solutions that I have come up with
may not have as great of a desired
impact as others. Some of them may
not have come across as well as
others, but I think the intentions were
good. Any decision that I have made,
if I could go back now and be in the
same time without knowing what I
know now, I would have made the
same decision. I don’t regret making
any decisions that I’ve made.

Q. We’ve touched on a number of
areas — the honor system, communi-
ty involvement of the student body,
repairing relations between the
students and the administration. If
your committee could accomplish
one thing and be known for accom-
plishing that one thing, what would it
be?

A. Strengthening the honor system,
in the eyes of the student body. We
started off on a good foot with orien-
tation, we’re revamping the honor
system pamphlet, I have stressed the
honor system in speaking with with
the faculty and have asked that they
require their students to write out the
pledge in full. I think that enhances
the understanding of the pledge and
what it means to turn in work that is
your own. You can’t find that in
many other colleges.

Q. Thank you, Cole.

alk at new general ed requirements
Math help available for struggling students

through one of the foreign language
departments. Similarly, a  jour-
nalism course stressing expository
writing could be used to fulfill the
English composition requirement.

In the May 1983 edition of the
Washington and Lee University
alumni magazine, Coulling wrote
that this aspect of the plan is an ‘‘at-
tempt to bridge artificial barriers
between departments.”’

In addition to the literature and
composition requirements, students
must now obtain 12 credits of a
foreign language; 12 in the fine arts,
history, philosophy and religion cate-
gory; 10 in science and mathematics,
including one laboratory science and
at least one math course; and nine
credits in the social sciences, which
include economics, politics, psycho-
logy and sociology and anthropology.

The requirement for one credit of
physical education was retained in
the new curriculum.

Students may waive their need to
take some courses through the
means of proficiency tests and ad-
vanced placement courses in high
school.

Also, a student’s courses in his
major may now count toward fulfill-
ing the general education require-
ments.

Underlying these requirements,
according to Coulling, is an attempt
to ‘propel the well-prepared student
forward and require the less well-
prepared student to become well-
prepared, to overcome his inade-
quacies.”’

Sigler, who said he is planning on
majoring in chemistry, recognizes
that some courses inevitably will
cause some students trouble. He add-
ed, however, that ‘“‘most professors
here are willing to help students who
have trouble... if you work at it.”’

Payne, who is considering a geo-
logy major, said, “I’m taking
English, and I’m not really inter-
ested. I’m interested in geology, and
I feel I’m learning more.”’

To fulfill the foreign language re-
quirement, Payne also is taking a
Spanish course. “For a geology
major,”’ he said, “I’m not so sure
how important Spanish is.’’

Payne, however, recognized that
his negative attitude toward some of
the new requirements may be biased.
“I think I just flunked my first
Spanish test,’’ he said.

A great many people will argue
that there is no such thing as Cal-
culus in “real life,’ but there is
something called Calculus here at
Washington and Lee and many fresh-
men are currently doing rather poor-
ly in that subject. To remedy that,
the University is offering a refresher
seminar for those struggling with
some of the more abstract concepts
involved in Calculus.

Conducted by Dennis Warwick, an
instructor from VMI, the sessions are
on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to
8 p.m. in Robinson 6.

Professor Henry Sharp, head of the
Mathematics Department, cited the
new General Education Require-
ments as part of the reason so many

freshmen are having a great deal of
difficulty with calculus. He said a
great many students simply do not
have enough mathematics back-
ground and are having to take
courses they are not properly
prepared to take.

Warwick blames much of the pro-
blem on what he calls “‘The Calcu-
lator Syndrome.” He said that many
students are lost if they are not given
a simple, cut and dried formula to
use,

Although Professor Sharp could
not supply any exact figures, a large
number of freshmen are failing the
subject. This number encompasses
both Calculus 101 and the newly add-
ed Discreet Mathematics 102, which
the seminar also covers. About 300 of
the 360 freshmen at W&L are taking
some form of mathematics this term.

Warwick is well acquainted with
courses such as this as he has tutored
at VMI as well as Mary Baldwin for
eight years.

Phil Sherrill, a freshman who at-
tended one of the classes, said that he
felt he was getting much out of it.

“T had trouble in high school,’’ he

said. “My background is bad.”

Kevin Fox, another freshman,
said, “It’s helping a lot. I’m doing
horrible in Calculus now and I need
the help.’”’

Warwick is not using a book, but
explains concepts that the students
are having trouble with.

Football team sees how it may look in 2034

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

Standing on the Washington and
Lee sidelines before Saturday’s
Homecoming football game, John F.
McFadden Jr. and his teammates
from W&L’s 1934 Southern Confer-
ence championship football team
issued a warning to the 1984
Generals.

‘Boys, we want you to take a good
look at us because this is the way
you’ll look 50 years from now,”
McFadden said they told the current
Generals.

The 1934 Generals were honorary
captains for Saturday’s game, a 41-21
defeat at the hands of arch-rival
Hampden-Sydney College.

One of only two W&L Southern Con-
ference championship football teams
(the other was 1950, when the team
went to the Gator Bowl), the 1934
Generals compiled a 7-3 record and
clinched the conference champion-
ship with a 14-7 victory against the
University of South Carolina in Col-
umbia, S.C.

This weekend, the first time many
of the team members had seen each
other since their glory days, provided
a ‘‘wonderful’’ time, and team mem-
bers said they were ‘“‘treated like
royalty.”

“It was wonderful,” said McFad-
den, who lives in Kingstree, S.C. ‘‘A

lot of them I hadn’t seen in 50 years.”’
the activities, McFadden added,
“kept us pretty busy...At our age,
that’s about all we could do.”

“We had time to swap some
yarns,’ said Edward W. Hiserman of
Charleston, W.Va.

As well as trading stories about the
heydays of Washington and Lee foot-
ball, the ‘five-star Generals,”’ as 50-
year alumni are called, compared
the Washington and Lee of 1984 with
the school they knew in 1934.

“The school hasn't changed
much,” said Lewis W. Martin of
Hilton Head, S.C. ‘‘We always dress-
ed with a coat and tie or a letter
sweater (for athletes). That's one of
the things I don’t like about it — the
way the students dress now. I think
they should dress a little neater than
they do.”

Students’ dress also was cited as a
change by other alumni. ‘‘The stu-
dents looked awfully young,’’ Mc-
Fadden said. ‘The thing I think that
has changed the most is the dress.
When we were there, we wore coats
and ties to every class. They don’t
look like the same people as we had
atall.”’

George W. Harrison of Henderson,
N.C., was a member of the Vigilance
Committee, which ensured that stu-
dents followed such rules as wearing
a coat and tie to class and speaking to
fellow students on campus.

Harrison said the committee ‘had
a few paddles”’ to punish disobedient
students. ‘‘I don’t believe any kind of
punishment like that is necessary
now,” he added, “but I believe we
should have something to get the
dress code back.”

One aspect of Washington and Lee
life that has changed greatly, and
with which these alumni are fami-
liar, is athletics. In 1954, Washington
and Lee ended a rich football tradi-
tion by eliminating subsidized athle-
tics and scholarship athletes.

Before then, the alumni said, near-
ly 20,000 people (compared with the
3,500 at Saturday’s game) sometimes
could be expected for W&L home
games. Temporary wooden stands
often had to be erected along the far
side of Wilson Field to handle the
overflow crowds.

“W&L football was pretty big
time,” said Martin, who played
guard. (Asked whether that was of-
fensive or defensive guard, he re-
sponded, ‘‘In those days, you played
both ways.”’) “It hasn’t changed a
whole lot because football today is
probably a whole lot better than
when I came along.”’

McFadden, who was starting
quarterback his freshman year and
backup quarterback in 1934, said the
quality of play and the atmosphere of
Saturday’s game was similar to
games 50 years ago.

Many of the scholarship football
players worked in the beanery (or
dining hall — situated where the
Bookstore is now) to earn money for
their meals, Harrison said.

Harrison, who described himself as
“a rinky-dink,’’ said he ‘‘played dur-
ing the week and rested up on Satur-
day.’’ A kicker, he added that five or

six other players could kick better
than he did, and he was listed as the
third-string center.

Hiserman, who had only an acad-
emic scholarship, joined the football
team as ‘“‘ a ‘‘walk-on’’ and played
halfback. ‘Crowds were bigger,
then,’’ he said, ‘‘although I was sur-
prised at the size of the crowd Satur-

day. I thought they had a good-sized
crowd, considering everything.”’

During the Depression, Washing-
ton and Lee usually began each year
with about 1,050 students, a number
that declined to about 900 by the end
of the year as financial problems
forced some students to leave school,
Hiserman added.

Exchange student named queen

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

As the Virginia gentlemen roared
from the bleachers and the sun peak-
ed over Wilson Field Saturday, the
moment of truth had arrived for 18
young women as Professor Keith
Shillington announced the 1984
Homecoming queen.

The winner was 19-year-old
Kathleen Plante, a Hollins College
junior who has been an exchange stu-
dent at Washington and Lee for the
last two terms. She represented Pi
Kappa Alpha and was escorted by
Dave Jonson.

The competition was judged by a
panel of university officials who con-
sidered appearance, outside activi-
ties and a 10-15 minute interview they
conducted.

Plante plans to spend next
semester in Kitakyushu, Japan,
where she will teach English conver-
sation to elementary school students.

Her possible long-range goals in-
clude obtaining a degree in interna-
tional law.

In adjusting to the all-male en-

vironment here, she found a slight
discomfort at ‘‘being noticed in the
cafeteria and in the classroom when
speaking out.”’

She said that although the men
tend to over-react to her presence,
they seem to accept her now that the
novelty has worn off.

The Homecoming queen received
an engraved pewter cup, a dozen red

carnations, and an “enchanting
crown.”’ Her duties, which consisted
of attending the alumni cocktail
party, posing for pictures and answer
questions from reporters, are now
technically over. 4

Plante is the fifth consecutiv
queen from Hollins and the second
consecutive Pika representative to
win the title. :

President [ John] Wilson”’ in answer-
ing questions. She declined to specify
the nature of that agreement.

She said that she and Wilson
“discussed my interest as an ex-
change W&L student in transfer-
ring.”’

Plante said that although she in-
tends to apply, her admission ‘“‘is not
a certainty.”

She said she has met twice with
Hollins President Paula Brownlee for
“basic career counseling.’ She said
the two ‘‘discussed the possiblity that

 

a few...a measurable number of girls
would be interested in transferring.’’s

“As far as a mass exodus is con;
cerned, that’s not something I think
will happen at all,”’ she said. 3

Dr. Robert A. Spivey, president of
Randolph-Macon Women’s College,
said that because ‘‘W&L decided that
they were going to take a normal
number of transfer students’?
—about 20 per year — he expects
there won’t ‘‘be any great number of
transfers from the local women’s col
leges.”’ ;

Hallman said Tuesday that oné
female transfer application and one
female early decision application
have been received by the admis-
sions office.

SAB pleased with pavilion weekend

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

After a successful trial run in the
Homecoming festivities last week-
end, the student activities pavilion
will be placed back under wraps until
January, Student Activities Board of-
ficials said.

“We were more than satisfied,”
said SAB Executive Director Mich-
ael Guerriero when asked about the
pavilion’s performance. Only a cou-
ple of minor problems kept the pavi-
lion from proving flawless.

The structure was used Friday
night for the Spinners concert and

  

Sunday afternoon for the Junior
Class party.

Guerriero said that the people he
spoke with had nothing but praise
for the pavilion and the weekend’s
set-up. The bands were especially
impressed with the dressing rooms
and the loading docks for their equip-
ment, he said. The bar was mention-
ed as a strong point by the beer dis-
tributors, Guerriero added.

On the negative side, the SAB was
only using one of the two doors for
spectator admission to Friday’s
show. This resulted in a long line out-
side the pavilion and about a 15-
minute wait to get inside.

Guerriero said that the SAB simply
did not anticipate the number of peo-
ple who showed up. He estimated
that the show on Friday: night was
about three-quarters full. This,
however, was not the case Sunday
afternoon, when a drastically
smaller crowd turned out for the

U.S. Sen. John Warner, a Repub-
lican from Virginia running for re-
election this year, will visit
Washington and Lee, his alma mater,
during a campaign swing through
Lexington next Thursday, Oct. 25.

Warner will be appearing at a con-
ference at VMI that morning and will
be on the W&L campus from 12 to 1
p.m. Tentative plans call for him to
speak in Lee Chapel at noon, accord-
ing to Pat Hayden, chairman of the
WA&L College Republicans.

Warner, who won election to his
first term in 1978, is challenged by
Democrat Edythe Harrison.

Junior Class party.

Another setback over the weekend
was the parking situation. There was_
not sufficient room for all who drove
to the pavilion to park.

There is some talk, Guerriero said,
of a pavilion parking lot being built in
the future to accomodate students.
He added that the gravel road behind
the pavilion may be paved from U.S. —
60 to give the area another entrance.

The next step for the pavilion is the _
laying of a floor that, it is hoped, will
be indestructible. Workmen were not
able to do this prior to last weekend’s_ |
activities. The floor will resist cigar-
ette burns and other party mishaps.

Since the pavilion will also be used,
for indoor athletic practices, the
structure must be readied for these -
as well. The projected completion
date for the SAB’s activities. is
December, which will have the
pavilion ready for student affairs in
January.

Warner to campaign here

Warner’s visit will coincide with ©
one by a medical student who was in :
Grenada when U.S. troops invaded |
the island a year ago.

The student will speak about thein- °
vasion at 3:30 p.m. in Room 221 of the .
Commerce School. His speech will be
followed by a question and answer ‘
session and a debate between W&L .
politics Professor John Handelman
and journalism Professor Clark R. |

sion was justifiable. ‘

The Lexington City Planning Commission recommended last Thursday
that City Council approve the permit necessary for the Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity to begin rebuilding at the site where its house was destroyed by
fire last spring. City Council must hold a public hearing before the permit
can be granted. Commission Chairman Henry L. Ravenhorst said they
_ received two letters opposing the permit and a petition signed by four in-
dividuals who opposed the permit. He said one of the signers was Lee Doane,
, a W&L law student and wife of City Manager John V. Doane. Ravenhorst
|, said that supporting Fiji at the hearing were Dean of Students Lewis John;
Richard B. Sessoms, the fraternity’s adviser; and a representative of the
| Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. He said that except for Doane, those opposing

the permit ‘‘were quite remote” from the house, and the commission felt
“everything else indicated that it had been used as a fraternity house for a
long time and that it was desirable that it continue to be used in that way.”
Ravenhorst, who is also an architect on the project which is scheduled for
, completion in Sept. 1985, said there will be small interior changes and that a
steel structure will be built inside the existing outer walls, which will be re-
tained. ‘‘That’s the whole intent — to keep the building looking as much the

‘Alumni say honor code
-remains a key concern

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Washington and Lee Alumni
Board, which met in Lexington this
weekend, is concerned with what it
sees as a weakening of the honor
system, student Executive Commit-
tee Vice President James White said
Monday night.

White, who attended the board’s
meetings, added, however, that
“they were pretty pleased with the
changes of the White Book revisions

committee.”’

‘ Last year, the EC passed White
Book changes that allow it to stamp
“‘expelled’’ on the transcript of a stu-
* dent found guilty in an open honor
trial and that allow it to use an extra
law student to assist it in prosecuting
‘open honor trials.

The alumni board expressed con-
cern that students, especially in the
Law School, don’t have enough re-
spect for the honor system, White
said.

The board suggested the possibility
of freshman orientation taking place,
as it did until a few years ago, during
a three-day retreat at Natural
Bridge. It also recommended a
stronger orientation for first-year
law students.

Dawson said he thought freshman
orientation went well this year. ‘“‘The
freshmen got a lot out of it,” he said.
Orientation about the honor system

was held at Liberty Hall.

Senior law representative Gordy
Hammock added that Dawson’s ori-
entation this year for the first-year
law students was well done.

‘Many law students don’t think
they are bound to the honor system
because they’re bound to legal re-
strictions,’’ junior representative
Michael Black noted.

White also reported that the alumni
board discussed the coeducation
decision, met with the Coeducation
Steering Committee and said that
donations from alumni to the Annual
Fund are down so far this year.

The alumni board met with student
body leaders Thursday afternoon for
informal discussions about problems
facing the university and students’
opinions about those problems.

The alumni. board, chaired by JE:

Charles Hurt Jr. of Atlanta, serves as
an advisory committee to the Board
of Trustees.

Also at Monday night’s EC meet-
ing, the committee decided once
again to investigate the possibility of
presenting another open exam
proposal to the faculty.

The proposal, as drawn up last
year, would allow students to take ex-
ams any time during exam week,
without having to specify a time or
day in advance, as they must now.

A similar proposal developed by
last year’s Executive Committee was
rejected by the faculty, 43-42, last
spring.

schools say coed is a plus

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Guidance counselors from several
high schools in the Washington and
Lee recruiting area say interest in
W&L has increased somewhat be-
cause of the coeducation decision,
but the counsleors do not see the deci-
sions having any immediate impact
on the school’s academic status.

“T have always recommended
W&L to my students,”’ Nancy Wise, a
counselor at Porter-Gaud, a high
school in Charleston, S.C., said. ‘The
academic quality of your university
has always been good. It (coeduca-
tion) doesn’t raise or lower my opi-
nion of W&L,’’ she added.

Ms. Wise said that the coeducation
decision makes it easier for her to
convince male students to attend
W&L. She said that in the past she
had to explain W&L’s relationship
with the nearby women’s colleges in
order to overcome students’ fears
that W&L was too isolated.

“It makes it less of a battle for me.
I don’t have to convince people that
there actually are women on cam-
pus,’’ Ms. Wise said.

Two students who told her last
spring that they would not apply to
W&L because it was all-male have
changed their minds now that the
university has decided to go coed,
reported Ms. Wise. However, no
female students at Porter-Gaud have
said they woul apply to W&L,
although one young woman has ask-
ed about the school, she said.

Ms. Wise said that after Porter-
Gaud went coed about 10 years ago,
the SAT scores of its students did im-
prove steadily due to the increased
applicant pool. She said W&L could
probably expect a similar ex-
perience.

“T think you will have strengthened
your position. I’m sorry to see your
traditions pass’”’ Ms. Wise said.

Brother Kenneth Sylvester, college
placement director at all-male
Chaminade High School in Mineola,

N.Y., said Chaminade students
always have been interested in W&L
because of its good academic and
athletic programs. However, some
students had been deterred from
going to W&L because it was all-

What Will It Mean?

 

male, Brother Sylvester said.

“After four years of an all-male at-
mosphere, they didn’t want to go to
an all-male college,’’ Brother
Sylvester explained.

“T didn’t think anything less of
W&L for the decision (on coeduca-
tion) or anything more. I think it’s
going to make it more competitive
for my male students to get in,”’
Brother Sylvester said.

A.E. Venturino, a counselor at
Douglas S. Freeman High School in
Riohmond, said interest in W&L
among male students has not chang-
ed since the coed decision, but sev-
eral female students at Freeman
have expressed interest in W&L.

Venturino said that before the
coeducation decision students who
were interested in W&L would also
consider schools such as Davidson,
the University of Virginia, Duke and
Hampden-Sydney. The decision to go
coed has not changed W&L’s status in
relation to these schools.

“For the students that we’re see-
ing, it (coeducation) doesn’t seem to
make any difference,’ Venturino ad-
ded.

Steven Munger, a counselor at
Worcester Academy in Worcester,
Mass., said he thinks W&L will con-
tinue to compete with the ‘‘better
East Coast liberal arts colleges” for
students, with coeducation not mak-
ing a significant change in W&L’s
status among those colleges.

“Personally, I don’t see any dif-
ference in how I’m going to look at
the school. I don’t think people select-
ed it because it was an all-male col-
lege,’’ Munger said.

Munger said five or six of his
students are considering W&L this
year, and in past years three or four
students from Worcester would ac-
tually apply to W&L.

“I haven’t gotten any feedback
from male students as to whether the
coed factor has made a differ-
ence...It has a definite appeal to the
one young lady in my senior class
who is interested in W&L,” said
Munger, chuckling.

Joffrey’s acting was better than its ballet

Here’s to all of you guys who think
guys who do ballet are all wimps.
Can you jump straight over a girl’s
head in a split without her even bend-
ing her' neck? Come on, she’s only
about 5’4”’.

I’m talking, of course, about the-
Joffrey Ballet performance this Sun-
day that so few of you went to. Oh,
I’m sure that you all had legitimate
reasons for not going, but it would
have been nice. After all, it was free.

The Joffrey performance was very
good technically, though not very
much of it was actually ballet. The
children in the audience enjoyed it
very much, and a few of them came
up and asked me if I were in the
“play.” In many ballet companies,
the performers don’t act and the au-
dience does not enjoy it too much.
The Joffrey’s acting was excellent,

though in one number, the girl, Meg
Gurin, was merely being a flirt when
she was supposed to be a whore.
However, she was an excellent dan-
cer, along with being very beautiful.
Her partner, Frank Affrunti, didn’t
have too much lacking either. For
those of you that think male dancers
are wimps, take a look at his legs
(though I’m sure you’d much rather
look at Meg’s).

The costumes for Meg and Frank’s
number were black with silver and
red sequins. The number the children
liked best, “The Steadfast Tin
Soldier” had the most colorful
costumes. The tin soldier was in full
military regalia and the gypsy had a
long, flowing yellow and orange
costume. There were five rats and a
cat who looked very realistic because
of their papier-mache heads, and two
urchins dressed in baggy 17th cen-

tury clothing. The one who did the
five-and-a-half foot leap had a jack-
in-the-box costume with red, dark
green and white checks. The father
reminded me a lot of a butler, partly
because of his very proper costume
— tails.

Joffrey performers have dance
classes about five hours a day, which
for the men consists mainly of lifting
120 pounds of gir] for five hours. They
are on tour for up to eight months
each year, and one of the performers,
Adam Sklute, has not seen his mother
ina year and a half.

Sklute is the youngest male dancer
in the company, and he has only been
a member since this summer. The
ages in the company range from 16 to
22. The dancers who have not gradu-
ated from high school are taking cor-
respondence courses, and many pro-
bably will never go to college.

TIME

week, there was one incessant question
OUT.... that seemed to echo from every idle chit-
chat on campus, whether it be among pro-
fessors, or students or men from buildings
and grounds. The question: What’s wrong
with W&L football? Why is W&L losing and
why are they getting beat so decisively.

 

 

 

By Mike
Stachura

 

 

 

Well, believe it or not, I cannot put my finger on it. What I can say is that
the games W&L has lost so far were games I thought, going in, were able to
be won. I’m sure in reflection Coach Gary Fallon thinks if things had been
just a tad different in a number of occasions, the outcomes might have been
all that different.

There isn’t much fear here that the Generals will finish at .500 or better. If
they don’t, it won’t be because they were outmanned on the field. The pro-
blem is why there should be any doubt at all about the team finishing on the
up side this fall.

What one can do is to point to a number of little things that, while perhaps
not totally explaining the lack of success in numbers, anyway, do at least
appear to be contributing factors in the W&L malaise this fall.

First and foremost, for the large portion of most of their games this fall,
the Generals seem to be doubting whether they can win. Case in point was
Saturday when W&L appeared as fired up as any team I’ve ever seen.
What’s more, the boys in blue win the opening kickoff. They proceed to go
nowhere fast and dig that early hole that they've been doing all season.

Something in this area of the game plan has got to change. That first
possession sets the tone for the game. Make sure that you do something
(work a trick play, knock someone on his rear end, yell at someone,
whatever) to keep that level of intensity. Don’t let your opponent have any
inkling that he’s remotely got any kind of an edge.

A second point is obvious, but worth mentioning. The little mistakes have
been killing the Generals. I don’t know how these mistakes can be avoided
other than to remind those making them to simply think. I have every con-
fidence that the Generals are smart enough to think, to step up in the pocket,
to not panic, to go beyond the x’s and 0’s on the chalkboard and make the ex-
ceptional play (I know they can do this. They’ve shown it. Look at Maryville
and last week.) , and to recognize when something’s not working.

Finally and this is a point the moaners and groaners have failed to
vocalize, if not realize — these four losses have been to very good football
teams, teams that don’t need an excess of open doors to get the jump on you.
Macon, Emory & Henry and the Squids may very well go to the wire for the
ODAC title. The Centre game was on the road, far away, and here’s a guess
that this team or any W&L squad does not travel well. (For those wondering,
Maryville and Centre are only in the same state geographically, not ability-
wise.) To win any one of these games required a much-better-than-average
performance from the Generals, a level of play that unfortunately didn’t
materialize.

In conclusion, this has been an indictment of no one. I think the team is cer-
tainly good enough to win the rest of its games. I also think they were
capable of winning some of those lost. Once they realize that fact fully — a
feat they’re quite capable — those Sunday brunch quarterbacks will have
nothing to moan and groan about....

....Other Colonnade notes: Tip of the hat to the harriers on their feat in
Farmville over the weekend. Not that cross country is much of a spectator
sport, but Saturday the Generals will be home for the only time this year. If
you get a chance, be there for the finish, a little before 12:30...

....One final note, talk about your contradictory actions, NCAA chief
Walter Byers is seriously concerned that subsidized athletics are nearing the
breaking point, that in reality what many top Division I-A teams are nothing
more than well-paid semi-professional squads. He estimates players may be
receiving $20,000 a year. Problem with his concern is that at the same time,
the famed Proposition 48 (700 minimum SAT’s for scholarship athletes) is
being tamed to avoid discrimination of blacks. Sounds nice (as in “Nice
book, Lisa’), but c’mon Walt, you can’t have it both ways, either you believe
in the first part of the term ‘‘student-athlete”’ or you don’t....

MADNESS!

 

The Generals’ Danny Jayne (33) bursts through the line in third
quarter action from Saturday’s 41-21 loss to arch-rival Hampden-

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The rivalry between Washington
and Lee and the University of the
South might not carry the same in-
tensity as does the one with Ham-
pden-n-Sydney, but do not think for
one second that the two teams treat
the annual contest as just another
game.

“This rivalry has built up since
I’ve been here,’’ W&L head coach
Gary Fallon said. “The schools are
very similar. Both are academically
oriented and have the same type of
kids. When we recruit in the South,
the name Sewanee often comes up.

James White’s third-quarter field goal got W&L
within six points of the Tigers, but that would be the

We end up playing against the kids
we recruited.”’

“It’s a good rivalry,’ said Sewanee
boss Horace Moore. ‘‘The alumni of
both schools are from the same areas
of the country, and we usually go
after the same young men.”’

“I practically raised (W&L co-
captain and senior tailback) Gene
Girard,” Moore said. ‘‘I had him ata
summer camp. He was a good, tough
kid then, and he still is. He also is a
good football player.’’

Both W&L (2-4) and Sewanee (0-5)
are coming off lopsided losses last
week. Sewanee was defeated sound-
ly; 56-8, by Georgia Southwestern,
and W&L lost a Homecoming Week-

end contest to H-SC, 41-21. Both
teams need a victory this week to get
back on track.

Against the H-SC last week, W&L
was the victim of three big plays that
proved to be the difference in the
game

The Tigers got on the scoreboard
first five minutes into the first
quarter when Brad Cary kicked a 21-
yard field goal. After the Generals
failed to move the ball on their se-
cond possession, the snap from cen-
ter sailed over punter B.J. Sturgill’s
head, giving the Tigers the ball on the
W&L one-yard line. Tiger fullback

increasing the H-SC lead to 10-0.

In the second quarter, W&L re-
serve fullback Danny Jayne scored
on a one-yard run that had been set
up by his 21-yard run on the preced-
ing play. James White missed the ex-
tra point, making the score 10-6.

Cary kicked his second field goal,
this one from 46 yards, with 3:42 re-
maining in the half to extend H-SC’s
lead to 13-46. The Generals came right
back with a score of their own when
quarterback Jon Thornton threw a
54-yard touchdown strike to wide
receiver Hugh Finkelstein with only
19 seconds remaining in the half.
W&L’s two-point attempt failed,
leaving the score 13-12 at halftime.

Two plays in the third quarter kill-
ed whatever chances of victory the
Generals had. On the first play from
scrimmage in the second half, Tiger
tailback David Kelly ran 61 yards
around left end for a touchdown. The
Tigers went for two and made it, upp-
ing their lead to 21-12. After White
had pulled the Generals to within six
points at 21-15 with his 39-yard field
goal, H-SC defensive tackle Doug
Parsons intercepted an attempted
screen pass by W&L quarterback
Bobby Wilson and returned it 14
yards for a touchdown. The Tigers in-
creased their lead to 41-15 with two
fourth-quarter scores. W&L got its
last score with 6:07 remaining in the
game when Thornton hit tight end
Ian Banwell with an 11-yard scoring
toss, making the final score 41-21.

Kelly was a one-man show for the
Tigers, rushing for 213 yards on only
20 carries and scoring once. H-SC had
387 yards of total offense, with all but
64 of those yards coming on the
ground.

W&L generated most of its offense
through the air as it was unable to
establish a running game. Thornton
completed 11 of 18 passes for 257
yards and two scores but was sacked
seven times for 87 yards in losses.
The Generals had only 25 net yards
rushing as the Tiger defense had
tackles for losses totaling 125 yards.

“T was disappointed in the margin
of defeat,’’ Fallon said. ‘“‘We put
ourselves in a hole, came back to
make it close, and then we made
some more mistakes. But despite the
score, I feel we played well at
times.”

Fallon warned that his team must
not take winless Sewanee too lightly
if itis to win.

 

 

 

DELIVERS"

“They are 0-5, but they have lost to
five good teams,”’ Fallon said. ‘‘They
are used to tough opponents. They
will be hungry when we play them
because they know they can compete
with us. The hungry athlete is the
most dangerous one.”’

The Generals lead the overall ser-
ies with Sewanee 17-15. However,
Sewanee has won the last two years
(16-10 in 1983) and the last eight
games between the two teams have
been decided by a touchdown or less.

Polo evens

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

After trailing 6-1 at the end of the
first period, the Washington and Lee
water polo team outscored M.I.T.
10-2 to earn an 11-8 overtime victory
at the Northeast Varsity Invitational
in Providence, R. I. last weekend.

In addition to defeating M.I.T., the
Generals (10-10-1) lost two games
during last weekend’s competition.
W&L suffered losses to Army 13-8
and Harvard 16-8.

Discussing his strategy during the
fourth quarter against M.I.T., Rem-
illard said that he had his team play
for a tie and go for a win in overtime.

“*We couldn’t afford to turn the ball
over while we were going for the win-
ning shot and give M.I.T. another
chance to score.”’

Remillard said his team would
have a better chance of winning the
game if his team could push the
game into overtime. The Generals
outscored M.I.T. 3-0 in the overtime
period.

Remillard attributed his team’s
comeback victory to his team’s con-
fidence in its ability to score.
Remillard said that when the Gener-
als began playing better offense,
M.L.T. had to play tougher defense,
which in turn detracted from M.I.T.’s
offensive effort.

Remmilard cited Tim Stanford and
Bobby Pearson for playing ‘110 per-
cent” all weekend. He also stated

The Washington and Lee rugby
club improved its record to 3-1 Satur-
day with a 20-12 victory over a team
from James Madison University at
W&L.

The team, which does not have var-
sity status, has also defeated the
teams from the University of Virgin-
ia and Hampden-Sydney College this
season, while losing only to a club
from Roanoke.

Team member Chris Komosa, a
junior, said that while the players en-
joy playing rugby, he doesn’t think
the sport will ever achieve varsity
status.

“There aren’t a lot of guys coming
out of high school who know enough
about the game,” Komosa said.

He added, however, that interest in
rugby at W&L is relatively strong
because many larger schools have
trouble fielding teams.

The W&L team will take on a team
from the Virginia Military Institute
Sunday at VMI. The following week-
end, the team will participate in a

finished with a time of 25:29.

Liberty Baptist had runners finish
in first, third, fifth, seventh and
eighth places, earning 24 points.
Christopher Newport College finish-

W&L was led by Frank Pittman in
12th place in 26:59, one minute and 30
seconds out of first place. Three
seconds later came Eddie Goundry
(27:02) in 14th place. Richard Moore
(27:57) in 23rd place, David Andrews
(28:05) in 32nd and Gordon Ogden
(28:25) in 41st helped earn the
Generals a total of 113 points.

Football? No, Phootball

The NPL is the ultimate armchair
owner’s league. Here’s how it works.
The league is composed of 10 teams
divided into the Long and Short Divi-
sions. Each team consists of 12 play-
ers. Each week W&L’s would-be
George Halases submit a seven-play-
er starting lineup to the league office.
This lineup includes a quarterback,
two running backs, two wide recei-
vers, a tight end and a placekicker.

The NPL team then receives a
point for every point that each player
scores in his NFL game. Quarter-
backs get six points for every
touchdown pass they complete.

The NPL was founded at W&L by
Jeff Hanna in September 1981. Be-
cause he had been involved with
similar leagues in the past, he ap-
pointed himself commissioner of the

Other ODAC teams finishing in-
cluded Hampden-Sydney in fifth
place with 133 points and Roanoke
College in seventh with 183 points.

The Generals, who remain 6-0 in
dual-meet competition, will bring the
Victory Tour to Lexington this Satur-
day hosting West Virginia Institute of
Technology, Bridgewater College
and Newport News Apprentice
School. This will be the only home
meet for the Generals on their five-
mile course.

“The course is one of the hardest
I’ve ever run,”’ said co-captain Mark
Pembroke. ‘‘The hills don’t help you
since they are steep and rocky going
down. They slow you down too
much.”

NPL and staged the league’s first
draft. The NPL has been going
strong ever since.

Procedurally, the NPL operates
much the same as the NFL Players
can be placed on waivers, and free
agents can be signed throughout the
season. :

The NPL regular season lasts 13
weeks, after which the playoffs
begin. The playoffs consist of a Divi-
sion Championship game, with the
winners meeting in the Supper Bowl,
the NPL’s equivalent of the Super
Bowl.

Hanna is quick to point out that
there is little skill and much luck in-
volved in the game. “The only skill
involved is making sure that the
players that you draft have not
retired.”’

Weaver played well, especially dur-

“Usually when you put a freshman
in the game you risk slowing the
team’s momentum or their screwing

Although W&L went 1-2 last week-

Hazards of Question-mongering: —

 

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Helmut Schmidt greets a VMI cadet following yesterday afternoon's

parade,

called for by Schmidt

Former West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt told a Virginia Mili-
tary Institute audience last night that
a ‘‘dual-track philosophy’’ of
strength and negotiation is the best
policy for nations to follow in this
time of ‘arms race and cold war.”’

Schmidt told a crowd of 3,250 at
VMI’s Cameron Hall that the two as-
pects of this proposed. ‘‘grand strat-
egy”’ are ‘‘the ability to deter if need
be and to defend or, if necessary, to
contain; and cooperation, mainly in
the field of arms limitation.”

The 67-year-old Schmidt, who led
West Germany’s Social Democratic
Party from 1974-82, is on a three-
month lecture tour of American col-
lege campuses.

He criticized the diplomatic ap-
proach taken by the United States
and the Soviet Union in the early
years of the Reagan Administration,
charging there was little more than

Wilson to urge
board to look
to year 2000

‘‘shouting on both sides.’

“It was loudspeaker diplomacy, if
it was diplomacy atall,”’ he said

Schmidt warned that ‘‘Russian ex-
pansion lives on’ and the Soviet
Union has ‘‘a sense of mission’’ and is
willing to ‘‘bear great sacrifice and
hardship” to accomplish its goals.

“Obviously this empire needs to be
contained by our alliance,” he said.
‘We need to have the means to con-
tain further Russian expansion.”

Schmidt noted that the convention-
al arsenals of Western nations are
dangerously inadequate. ‘‘All-out
nuclear war may be necessary be-
cause we lack troops and we lack the
ability to transport troops to spots
where they would be needed,” he
said.

Schmidt, who worked as an econo-
mist before he entered German poli-
tics, said that high US. interest rates

‘terminated’:

librarian resigns as of July

White hints at
EEOC lawsuit

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

Minority Affairs Director John L. White said this
week he has been “‘terminated’’ by University Presi-
dent John D. Wilson effective in June. White said he has
retained an attorney to represent him in the matter.

He said he was informed of the decision in a memo-
randum from Wilson dated Oct. 22.

“On a delicate personnel matter, I’m not going to
have any comment at this time,’’ Wilson said yester-
day.

White, who has been minority affairs director for five
years and graduated from Washington and Lee in 1974,
said that when he spoke with Wilson on Tuesday, the
president told him he had been an ineffective recruiter.

‘He claims that he has serious doubts about my abili-
ty to do the job,” White said. ‘‘I agree that he has the
right to say that.”’

White said he had hired an attorney because ‘‘it’s
what you have to do to retain your job.”’

‘‘One of the remedies available to me is the provision
that I could be reinstated in my position,’ he said.
“Depending on what the EEOC [Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission] says or what the federal
court says, if it goes to federal court, I could be
reinstated.”’

White said a possible basis for a discrimination suit
derives from the fact that ‘‘one of the bases on which
I’m being dismissed is I’m ineffectual as a recruiter.”’

He explained that although minority recruiting is
down, he is only one of five recruiters.

“Recruitment is a shared responsibility,” he said. ‘‘If
recruitment goes down, and I get fired, it strikes me as
peculiar that it would happen that way.”’

 

= Wnite’s five years as director of minority affairs were”

marked by controversial events, the most recent of
which was an article in last week’s W&L Law News, in
which he was quoted as saying black students live in
“great fear’ of not receiving a fair trial from the Ex-
ecutive Committee if they are brought up on honor
charges.

White said he did not know if the Law News article,
which came out four days before White received
Wilson’s memo, prompted Wilson‘to fire him.

‘He said he was making some changes in the minori-
ty affairs department,” White said, ‘‘and he wished me
well in my future career in law.”

White, who is a third-year law student as well as an
administrator, last year was said to have physically at-
tacked Jim Green, an EC member serving as a prose-
cutor at an open trial of a student White was defending.
White says now that he was wrong in attacking Green.

A black student was convicted in that trial, which
White said in the Law News was marked by ‘‘procedu-
ral irregularities.”’

Black students fear that a system dominated by
whites and beset with such procedural irregularities
could result in their being unfairly convicted if a trial
were to occur, White said.

In the article, White declined to specify what pro-
cedural irregularities took place during the trials, but

Leach will start
new association

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

University Librarian Maurice D. Leach will resign
his position July 1, according to a memorandum sent to
the faculty Monday.

Following a year’s leave of absence, Leach will re-
turn as director of a new Friends of the Library pro-
gram.

Leach said University President John D. Wilson sug-
gested the move at the beginning of the school year.
Leach said he’d thought about it ‘‘pretty hard’’ before
accepting the new position Oct. 10.

Under Leach’s administration, the library moved
from its old quarters in McCormick Hall, which now
houses the Commerce School, to the present library
building, and a major expansion of the collections was
completed.

“Mr. Leach is a proven quantity when it comes to
building a library,’’ said Dean of the College John W.
Elrod. ‘‘It seemed a good idea to have him take these
talents and use them in building up this new associa-
tion.”’

He said “friends of the library’’ programs
“‘sometimes raise money but they more often try to at-
tract important papers to the library and try to get im-
portant book collections donated.’’ He said Leach’s
work will encompass both areas.

“He has a sense of having completed his work with
this library,’’ the dean continued. ‘‘He has brought it up
to the point where he wanted it.”’

Elrod, who is chairman of the librarian search com-
mittee, said he hopes a replacement can be found ‘‘by
late spring at the very latest —hopefully earlier.’’

Leach, who assumed his position in 1968 after serving |
as a Ford Foundation program officer in the Middle
East, will retain his full professorship.

It is undecided whether the new organization will be
attached to the library, the development office or
Washington Hall.

“When the library’s need is bad — when a new
building or some basic collection is needed — it’s easier
to be seen by the public,’’ Leach said.

“Once you've started to close those gaps, keeping the
interest up is more of a job. The Friends of the Library
program will try to maintain a valid interest in the
library.”’

Leach said he was leaving his present position be-
cause of ‘‘the challenge offered by the president.”

“I’ve always found that one career position leads to
another,’’ he said. ‘‘When another opportunity comes
your way, frequently you’re about saturated as far as
what you can contribute to your current position.”’

“Your creativity and freshness may become a little
staler, stereotyped or boxed in,’’ he continued. ‘‘You
don’t look at things with as fresh an approach as you
might.”

Leach said that of the innovations in the library dur-
ing his tenure, he is most proud of the Bibliographic
Resources (‘‘190’’) classes that have been started in
conjunction with several departments.

“‘We have a pretty unique situation here of library

Chief claims
several frats
‘out of hand’

 

From Staff Reports Although Washington and Lee students performing this
weekend in ‘‘Juno and the Paycock”’ are not being paid,
one cast member said that to classify them as amateurs
‘‘would be misleading.”’

And Jarlath Conroy should know.

A veteran of numerous acting performances, Conroy, a
professional, is at W&L this month working with students
and appearing in the leading role of the play.

“Professionalism is a state of mind, whether one is get-
ting paid or not,’”’ Conroy said. ‘One meets a lot of
amateurs in the professional theater. I don’t find it at all
difficult to deal with the students here if they bring their
own practical approach to their work.”

Conroy plays the part of Paycock, the Irish way of say-
ing Peacock. Paycock also is known as Captain Boyle.
Directed by Joseph Martinez, the play also stars Al Gor-
don as Juno, Boyle’s wife.

The play is set during the Irish Civil war of 1922 and will
show here from Friday, Oct. 26, to Wednesday, Oct. 31,
and on Nov, 3 at the Troubadour Theatre.

“The central character is a young boy with his hip shot
up and an arm torn off in the civil war,’’ said Martinez.
“It’s a comedy /tragedy about a very poor tenement fami-
ly in Dublin.”’

“Juno and Captain Boyle,”’ continued Martinez ‘“‘repre-
sent aspects of the Irish national character. They are ar-
chetypical characters but O’Casey’s brilliance is that
these characters are incredibly real and naturalistic.
O’Casey writes deep pathos and evokes a strong passion
from his audience.”’

“The essential drama in the Irish national character is
either to run from or face reality,’ he added. ‘‘The play
gets its energy from this tension.”’

“Even people who have never been to a play before
would like this one,’’ said Conroy. ‘I think the main
reason to see the play is for a portrayal of an element of
Dublin life in particular and also life in a universal sense.
It’s a slice of life of people going through difficulties and
pain.

“It’s a different experience,’’ Conroy continued, ‘‘to be
able to stand outside these emotions and look on. I think

University President John D.
Wilson says he will urge. the
Washington and Lee Board of Trust-
ees this weekend to ‘‘concentrate on
the next 15 years and not be in-
fatuated with the details of the
coeducation transition.”

The 25-member board will meet in
Lexington this weekend to consider
matters relating to coeducation and
other University business.

‘“‘We need to make sure we don’t
lose sight of the forest,’ Wilson said
Tuesday. ‘‘This institution will be 250
years old in 1999, on the eve of the
next century.

‘What we do and how we do it in
the next 14 years will determine
whether we will increase our status
as a prominent national institution of
the first rank.”’

As part of the University presi-
dent’s report to the board Saturday,
Dean Pamela H. Simpson, who
chairs the Coeducation Steering
Committee, will discuss the results of
that group’s preliminary work.

In addition, the coed committee
will have a social meeting with the
board tomorrow evening.

“They'll discuss the fruit of their
work so far on the many, many sub-
jects they’re taking up,”’ Wilson said

Wilson said coeducation will be on
the agendas of a number of the
board’s six committees.

At a joint meeting, members of the
Planning and Development and Cam-

Center, by 1 p.m. Tuesday of the | Pus Life committees will discuss the
week they are to be run. renovations planned for University

Police confiscated a stereo from a
Pi Kappa Phi party at 1:44 a.m.
Saturday after the fraternity ignored
a warning that it was violating noise
laws, Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said.

A summons also was issued to Pi
Phi President Edward V. Buttarazzi.
Sutton said five police officers went
to the house after an 11:30 p.m. warn-
ing was disregarded.

“With their attitude and because of
the previous warning, there was no
assurance the stereo would be turned
off or down if it weren’t confiscated,”’
Sutton said. ‘‘It was a last resort to
establish peace and quiet.”’

“They were giving the officers a
hard time and were shouting some
obscenities and some unnecessary
and racial slurs toward one of my of-
ficers,”’ he said.

Buttarazzi said removing the
stereo ‘‘was one way of getting
everybody out of there — I see that
—but the effect might have been ac-
hieved by just turning it off.”’

He said the person who shouted the
remarks Sutton referred to ‘‘was no
one in our house.”’

‘We were the only party on cam-
pus that night, so there were a lot of
people there that we didn’t recog-
nize,’’ Buttarazzi said.

Ina Tuesday meeting Sutton ‘‘was
very open and very receptive to any
suggestions I had,’’ said Buttarazzi,
adding that he recommended a meet-
ing between the police chief and frat

OPINION October 25, 1984
Nice college

Forget Brown University, Lisa Birnbach.

Last Monday, 1,200 of the 8,000 undergraduates there voted
for the campus infirmary to stockpile cyanide pills to be used
in the event of nuclear war. The rationale involved, accord-
ing to Students for Suicide Tablets, sponsors of the initiative,
is that nuclear war will wreak such havoc on the human race
that life simply won’t be worth living. What a cheery thought.

‘‘We think that the potential for destruction in the event of a
nuclear war is so great that it will not only destroy our
civilization but our whole value system,” said Jason Salz-
man, an organizer of the non-binding initiative. ‘‘Suicide
would have a whole different meaning.”’

 

How was that again? Nuclear war will destroy our whole
value system and therefore let’s stockpile pills now so we
won’t have to worry then? Talk about a value system! Taking
human life will remain the same heinous crime then that it is
now.

Fear of nuclear war cannot be allowed to control our every
move. Responding with a fatalistic acceptance of a seeming-
ly inevitable end does nothing to prevent that end. The
students at Brown, while expressing a fear of nuclear holo-
caust, could have chosen a more positive approach. Accep-
ting nuclear war as inevitable and choosing to serve selfish
interests in the event of nuclear war is the real decay in
values.

Schedule a change

Just as we were recovering from the aftereffects of
midterms — and the same week as seniors received their
LSAT scores— yet another rigor of academe was inflicted
upon us this week— registering for winter term courses.

Although we are thankful for the variety of courses
available and realize the necessity of registering now for a
term that won’t begin until students start looking for Fancy
Dress dates (seems a long way off, doesn’t it?), we must
question a registration process that does not allow us to
specify a time of day we would prefer to take our courses.

This produces what, at times, amounts to little more than a
game between students and the registrar’s office, which is
busy enough as it is without having to endure such foolish-
ness.

A constant in the always-complex equation of how many
students will sign up for which courses is that most students
would rather not have an ‘“‘A’’ hour class. Especially on
Thursday mornings.

Rather than leave their semester’s party plans to fate and
the whims of the registrar’s computer, therefore, they will
sign up for a course that meets only at ‘‘A’’ hour, which they
can then drop in January in favor of something more comfor-
table, such as a ‘‘G’’ hour course.

And then there’s the ‘“‘morning” student (or one whose
afternoons are taken up by other activities, such as sports).
He, of course, will be assigned the ‘‘J’’ section of a course
that also meets at ‘‘A’”’ or “‘B’’ hour and will change his
schedule in the opposite direction.

All this does is create additional work for the registrar’s of-
fice, which not only must process the initial schedule but then
must make the requisite drop/add changes.

A more effective means of scheduling, from everyone’s
standpoint, would be to allow students to merely note on their
schedule cards — a place for this, we might add, already ex-
ists — which hour they would prefer to take a course. The
party-goer can specify ‘‘G’’ hour; the ‘‘morning’’ person,
‘*A”’ hour,

Although this may give the computer some more numbers
to crunch (and we realize everyone won’t get what he wants
— that’s a given), it will enable initial course schedules
(those are the ones you usually forget to pick up around exam
time) to more closely reflect the classes you'll actually take
the following semester.

The slightly greater workload for the registrar’s office at
registration time will be more than offset by a lighter work-
load and less course changes at the beginning of the new
semester. And this makes things run more smoothly for
everyone.

 

Correction

In an article in last week’s Ring-tum Phi about the Alumni Board
meeting, it was incorrectly stated that donations to the Annual Fund
are down so far this year. Development Director Farris P. Hotchkiss
reports that donations this year are ‘“‘significantly higher’’ than they
were last year at this time and said it is “‘much too early to tell what
the trends” in alumni giving will be following the coeducation deci-
sion.

Do clothes make the man?

 

MY

By Al

It's now in fashion, so let’s talk ties.
How can clothes make us men?

We subscribe to a very strange
ethos when we disdain the tie for the
weekday trek up the Hill, but gleeful-
ly button down in unison for Saturday
football games. 2

If we are caught wearing ties to
class, the labels that may be affixed
are:

1) Futch student.

2) Groveling goose.

3) Both of the above.

We find the student sporting the
despised cravat as rare as the pro-
fessor in shirtsleeve.

This Janus-faced attitude must
flow from the ‘Cult of Slackness’’
lately embraced among Washington
and Lee’s student bodies.

“Thou shalt not take thy studies too
seriously nor thy partying too
lightly,”’ the Cult’s First Command-
ment reads. We fight vigorously for
the right to party on Wednesday

nights, even as we assert our right
not to study beyond the call of duty.
“But you didn’t tell us that was going
to be on the test,’ we wail on Wednes-
day.

Between exams, it is far more re-
spectable to refrain from comment
than to risk error. Besides, some
“tool’’ is bound to find a practical
application of the class material or to
say: “Did you see the article in Sun-
day’s New York Times?”

“The infidel must be ostracized
from the cult,” we mutter. “‘Now
we'll have to find that damned article
in the library and cite it on the exam.
What a hose!”

Academic marks, it seems, are
meant as a measure of how efficient-
ly we accomplish the bare minimum.
The Grade Point Average need only
be as high as the University stand-
ards, or in some cases, high enough
to win a place in a graduate program.

Atnotime are the tenets of the Cult
more piously observed than when
choosing classes. As I registered for
winter term Monday, an acquain-
tance advised against taking a cer-
tain history course.

“T had to struggle for a hook [C],”’
he warned. “If you have to take a
history course, go for 666 with
Jones.”

Good intentions aside, this guy was

recommending my course of study
with no clues to my career objec-
tives. I still opted for the tougher
course, not because I am a glutton for
all-nighters (which I am) or because
I am an especially efficient student
(which I am not); but because I’m
more intrigued by modern Latin
America than by ancient Greece.

As one who has chanted B.1.0.
(Blow It Off) once too often, I have
found an alternative to the Cult.

It is not the wearing of prescribed
attire or the fashioning of a given
GPA that makes men of boys.

It is by the personal process of a
liberal education and not by the
labels on the final product that we
may rate ourselves and our minds.
We cannot limit our explorations to
the norm; our readings to the sylla-
bus. To do so is to invite the ridicule
of Lisa Birnbach; to flout our touted
traditions.

The foundation of the Honor Sys-
tem is such that each man be judged
on his singular endeavor, as Teddy
Roosevelt hoped: ‘Far better is it to
dare mighty things, to win glorious
triumphs, even though checkered by
failure, than to take rank with those
poor spirits who neither enjoy much
nor suffer much, because they live in
the gray twilight that knows not vic-
tory nor defeat.”’

 

Disclaimer
Criticized
by reader

To the Editors:

I was surprised by the little par-
agraph on the second page of last
week’s Phi from ‘‘the editors’ about
the Canterbury Fellowship ad which
also appeared in that issue. Those
sentences were not the sort of thing I
was used to seeing and they left me
with some questions.

Since the editors ‘formally disas-
sociate’’ themselves with that ad,
does that mean that they ‘‘associate’’
themselves with every other? (So
you guys suggest the ‘Exotic Cock-
tails’’ then? or maybe just ‘“‘infor-
mally’’?)

The editors realize that the ad may
offend some readers for its message.
While I agree that it is necessary to
consider the moral values of readers
at certain times, it seems, nonethe-
less, that potentially offensive sub-
jects have appeared in the Phi be-
fore. There are some, no doubt, who
might find the mention of liquor, sex
and guns disturbing, all subjects
which have appeared either in adver-
tisements or in articles in The Phi.

The editors also feel that some
readers may object to “having any
group’s views held up to ridicule.”
There is a group whose football team
beat us at homecoming whose views
never seem to tire as a subject for
satire. It doesn’t seem that the
editors were so concerned there.

They also say that The Phi is a
newspaper for the ‘entire communi-
ty.’ What one is that? One which
finds Farmville funnier than some-
where else closeby in Virginia? One
that is offended when serious sub-
jects are introduced in ad-man fash-
ion? (It seems to me that much of
politics concerns itself with the latter
question. )

I agree with anyone that perhaps
the ad wasn’t in the best of taste, but
I hope that The Phi readership is
smart enough to recognize when
something is deliberately provoca-
tive without having to be told. I also
hope that it won’t blame the editors
for everything that might shock. Per-
sonally, I think some of the illustra-
tion on the opinion page pretty offen-
sive, but I hope the editors won’t de-
nounce it.

While I am sure I should recognize
here a certain consideration, pru-
dence and fairness on the part of the
“editors, I am only more offended by
what seems cheap, wimpy and itself,
biased.

Apathy can also be applied to faculty

MY VIEW

By Ben Hale

Student apathy! It has come to be
mentioned in the same light as small-
pox or polio: How do we cure this
disease?! One way might be to put
one of the causes under the micro-
scope: faculty apathy. Faculty
apathy isn’t, of course, the sole
reason for student apathy but it has a
lot to do with it and perpetuates it.

One of the sadder aspects of this
place is the void of faculty-student in-
teraction outside the classroom and
the office. Our small size is wasted
when personal relationships don’t
parallel the professional relation-
ships. A tiny bit of this goes on, but
not nearly enough — the campus
starves for it. The faculty is more to
blame than the students because it is
the continuity here — and things
have not always been this way.

I listened recently to some alumni
of the late 60s talk about their days
here; they talked mostly about the
strong social circles with faculty and
students, and how much it had meant
to them. One said he had learned
more flipping burgers with his
English adviser than he had in the
classroom. There is no quick answer
to why this stopped, but that it stop-
ped means that a good deal — or
maybe most — of the real
communication between faculty and
students has stopped. This has a lot to
do with the rift that we now face be-
tween ‘‘the Hill’ and ‘‘Red Square.”
It is also much repsonsible for the
lack of intellectual fire that those
same faculty bemoan: I get far more
interested in Plato in an individual
conversation than while taking notes.

Those faculty members who spent
their Friday nights at student houses
are of course older now, but there are
younger faculty who are as energetic

Midterms

 

as their seniors were 20 years ago.
These younger faculty have not, how-
ever, been oriented to this way of
thinking. They are as distant per-
sonally from students as those who
have stopped being close—I am by no
means saying that only younger fac-
ulty can associate and socialize with
students or that the burden falls on
them. They are, for the most part, re-
ceiving a bad example from older
faculty who know how things ought to
be. Of course, much of the blame
falls on apathetic students who seem
to prefer beer sliding to a beer with a
professor — but this preference
comes in part from a lack of faculty
initiative.

Faculty apathy can be further seen
in their attendance at campus
events. Aside from that group of fac-
ulty who continue to support almost
everything, faculty attendance at
most events is proportionally as low
as student attendance. I have con-
fronted some faculty with this and
have met the mood that having a
bunch of students that don’t care and
won't go is so discouraging that they
would rather not waste their efforts.
This makes sense and is doubtlessly
a valid feeling— but their enthusiasm
for what is going on can only have a
positive effect on student en-
thusiasm. Here is an example of the
self-perpetuating circle of a bad cam-
pus aftitude.

The fraternity system is another
maddening example of this circle.
With the fraternity system in tro-
uble—especially with faculty dissat-
isfaction, one would think the
“grown-ups” would be lined up to be
fraternity advisers, or just to help,
but indeed some houses have had to
search hard for advisers and then
sometimes settle for a token one. The
fraternities aren’t reaching out as
they should but this is in part due to
their not seeing anyone to reach to.
The fraternities are finally making a

concerted effort to straighten them-
selves out but they must have advice
and guidance from someone who
cares ——which is far more helpful
(and meaningful) than disdainful
criticism. Certainly the bad student
attitude discourages a faculty mem-
ber from getting involved. But the
circle must be broken somewhere.
There are many faculty who still
reach out to students personally
—those who don’t eat in the back of

Apathy not

the co-op away from the students,
those who bring students to morning
coffee, those who take time to talk
with students in Kroger. They are
some of the same ones who are dedi-
cated fraternity advisers, open-
minded SAC members, etc. I certain-
ly don’t want to criticize them— but
to encourage the rest of the faculty to
follow their example. I don’t even
need to say that teaching reaches far
outside the classroom — or should.

connected

to fashion, student says

To the Editors:

I have to agree when Scott Tilley
says apathy has run amok at Wash-
ington and Lee. Lectures, readings,
plays, films and games of all sorts
are pitifully attended, and the after-
class exodus from the Hill is mute
witness to many students’ disinterest
in much W&L has to offer. I must ad-
mit I am guilty of this to a certain
degree.

However, I find Mr. Tilley’s school
spirit and opinions about what W&L
is all about (My View, Oct. 18) rather
amusing. W&L, as I see it, is about
knowledge, learning and most impor-
tantly, broadening one’s horizons
through exposure to many and varied
people, arts and ideas. Khakis, Duck
Heads and ties at football games are
not a part of my W&L. Indeed, I find
the ‘“W&L uniform’? and _ the
lethargic conformity it represents to
be one of W&L’s biggest detractors.

I do not consider myself any less a
gentleman because I do not wear the
khaki, oxford and tie uniform, or
because I dare to wear a T-shirt and
jeans to a football game. Clothes do
not make the man, and college stu-
dents needn’t dress like their fathers.

Although I do not doubt Mr. Tilley’s

devotion to his W&L, I must question
what he thinks is the best way to
show one’s commitment to W&L’s
ideals. I would much rather go to col-
lege with unkempt people who spoke
in class and attended ‘“‘all those other
things” than a herd of mute and dis-
interested style men. Apathy, or in-
terest, has nothing to do with clothes
and ties.

Bond proposal abandoned

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

A planned automatic bail program
for women’s college students arrest-
ed in Lexington for drunk driving has
been abandoned by the University

‘administration.
In early September, Lexington Po-
“lice Chief L.O. Sutton sent a letter to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John in an
“gifort to create an “ombudsman”
"program for the visitors at Washing-
yiton and Lee. The purpose of this pro-

~.gram would have been to provide
> overnight housing for the women and
s assurances from the school that

iqthose charged of drunken driving

~ would have a place to stay until the
alcohol wore off as well as ensuring

“ee

.

phat they would appear in court.
_. Sutton said, “The problem is that

girls coming from other schools have
to go back to class the next day;
therefore, they must drive.’’

Between two and six DUI’s occur
each weekend, and the majority of
those are issued to girls from the sur-
rounding schools, Sutton added.

The Lexington jail is not equipped
to handle female ‘‘prisoners’’ and, if
the girls cannot make bail, they must
be sent to Staunton. Therefore, Sut-
ton said he thought establishing a
bond program with the school would
help avoid the hassle of transporta-
tion and booking.

Associate Dean of Students Mich-
ael Cappeto, chairman of the Alcohol
Policy Review Committee, said the
school decided to reject the offer for
the time being. Cappeto said a lack of
housing for the women, and the
unwillingness of administration per-

sonnel to assume responsibility for
them were the two main concerns.

John added that the school was
worried about the legal ramifications
of the whole program. “If a student
whom we had bailed out decided not
to come back to school and thus miss-
ed their court date, the school would
be held responsible,”’ he said.

Sutton said he has spoken with sev-
eral fraternity presidents about the
drunk driving problem. ‘We need
some way of taking the need...or nec-
essity to drive out of the social arena
we are operating out of,”’ he said.

He added that ‘‘we don’t want to
dampen anyone’s fun but we do want
to save lives,” One of the best ways to
assure everyone’s safety, according
to Sutton, is to ride in a carpool and
designate one person to not drink and
thus be the driver.

Study abroad can broaden the mind

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

Students who study abroad can
participate in activities, such as tour-
ing a BMW factory, that broaden the
mind and sharpen the critical per-
8pective, according to one professor,

qneeting Tuesday with students inter-

ested in foreign studies.

“ “Studying abroad makes you more
gritical of your own country and your
own lifestyle...and also makes you
more appreciative,” said Alfred G.
Fralin, a romance languages profes-
sor who traveled to France with stu-
ydents last April and May on one of
, Washington and Lee’s eight spring
term foreign study programs in
rGreece, Japan, Spain, Taiwan, Ecua-
dor, England, France and Germany.

Professor Robert B. Youngblood,

ywho has organized several trips to

Germany, said the program “deals
with everything we can possibly fit
yintoit.”’

Youngblood listed concerts, the
theater, museums, history, architec-
{ural remains and ecclesiastical, ar-
tistic and industrial monuments as
supplements to the study agenda.

In particular, students toured the

to include 34
Wa&L students

A total of 34 Washington and Lee

students will be included in the 1985
edition of ‘‘Who’s Who Among Stu-
dents in American Universities and
Colleges.”’
» The students were selected on the
basis of their academic achievement,
service to the community, leadership
wn extracurricular activities and
potential for continued success.

They join an elite group of students
selected from more than 1,500 institu-
tions of higher learning in all 50
states, the District of Columbia and
‘several foreign nations.

Outstanding students have been
honored in the annual directory since

“it was first published in 1934.

Of the 34 W&L students included in
the 1985 volume, 27 are seniors and
“rseven are third-year law students.

Those selected to Who’s Who are:

Seniors: Ian B. Banwell, B. Darby

BMW factory and also spent a day in
East Berlin, where they listened to
government lectures that Young-
blood termed ‘‘propaganda.”’

Lectures and classes are in the lan-
guage of the hosting country, as in
the case of Germany and France, al-
though instruction in some programs
may be in English, such as the term
in Greece.

Stewart Anderson, who was a par-
ticipant in the 1982 program in Ger-
many, called the ‘‘basic language
barrier’ the “epitome of culture
shock.”

Anderson explained, however, that
the Germans were as curious about
America as he was about Germany.
‘‘Many times,”’ he said, ‘‘that curiosi-
ty was anicebreaker.”’

“Students love talking politics,’’ he
added.

SAC vote slated

From Staff Reports

A motion to reconsider the rule pro-
hibiting guests at Wednesday night
parties has been before the Student
Affairs Committee for three weeks,
but will “definitely” be voted on to-
day, according to Student Body Pres-
ident Cole Dawson.

Dawson proposed the motion Oct.
4, after some students said ‘that the
rule was unfair and counterproduc-
tive, during a forum held in the Exec-
utive Committee room.

The motion was tabled when it was
first made, the SAC did not meet the
next week because of an Alumni
Board meeting and the motion was
not voted on last week because neith-
er Dawson nor Interfraternity Coun-
cil President David Perdue was at
the meeting.

Mesner trial set

A trial date has been set for the
man indicted for arson and murder in
connection with last spring’s Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house fire.

The trial of Scot Tanner Mesner, a
19-year-old Hollins College resident
who was indicted by a grand jury
Sept. 4, is scheduled for Dec. 19-21.

The date was set following an evi-
dence hearing Tuesday between Mes-
ner’s lawyers and Commonwealth’s
Attorney Beverly C. “John” Read.

Mesner has been held in Rock-
bridge County Jail since Sept. 4. Bail
was set at $150,000 at the time of his

 

Youngblood pointed out that the W&L
instructors sometimes act as media-
tors between the American students
and German families.

Youngblood recognized that many
times students are unaware of cultur-
al differences and said that instruc-
tors every once in a while have to
‘“‘make sure the student isn’t putting
his feet up on the coffee table.”’

Besides the most obvious advan-
tages of studying in a foreign coun-
try, Fralin also included the ‘‘less
tangible aspects of the experience,”
suchas living witha native family.

Youngblood called the foreign
study programs a ‘‘combination of
living experience and learning ex-
perience.”

The spring programs, however,
are not the only ones available to
W&L students.

Benefit nets $900

Delta Tau Delta fraternity will
donate $900 to the-United Way cam-
paign from the proceeds of a benefit
concert Saturday.

The concert, held in the Cockpit,
drew an enthusiastic crowd of stu-
dents, faculty and Lexington re-

sidents. The program featured enter-:

tainment by Washington and Lee
graduates Tim Eddy, Dominic Ly-
ons, Pete Davis and Burr Datz along
with the Ruley Brothers, Wildgrass
and the Convertibles.

Datz is the chapter advisor of Delta
Tau Delta and helped the chapter or-
ganize the event.

Tailgate for lunch

The Parents’ Weekend lunch
scheduled for noon on Saturday, Nov.
3, will be served on the upper athletic
field as well as in Evans Dining Hall,
according to Carter V. McNeese, the
administrator in charge of the week-
end program.

He said the change was made to
enable fraternities and their parents
to participate in a tailgate party
prior to the 1:30 p.m. football and
soccer games.

Fraternities and other interested
groups should plan to bring their
meals, trash cans, tables and beer
kegs up to the field for the all-school
tailgate party.

from the brotherhood of their own
houses,”’ Buttarazzi added.

The police chief said the incident
last weekend was symptomatic of
repeated difficulties the police
department is having with approx-
imately five fraternities.

‘Apparently things are getting out
of hand,” Sutton said. ‘‘The spirit of
cooperation as far as they are
concerned is being ignored.”

“It disturbs me that they’re getting
to be defiant,” he continued.

“I don’t think they want to do that.
But if it’s a confrontation they want,
then that’s what they’re going to get.
They’re the ones that are doing it
—not us.”

Sutton said the police department
has issued eight summonses to frat-
ernities so far this year, more than
the total of all last year.

The police chief said Pi Phi had no
amplified sound permit the night the
stereo was confiscated. He added
that the previous Friday the fraterni-
ty had called him at home and he
came out at night to supply it with a
permit.

Washington and Lee’s Placement Factory Discount
Office is sponsoring a Pre-Law
Forum, tomorrow, Oct. 26, in the Furniture

University Center. The forum will
run from 1-5 p.m. A special presenta-
tion on how to evaluate a law school
will begin at4p.m.

According to Associate Dean of
Students Michael Cappeto the Pre-
Law Forum will give students the
chance to discuss plans with law
school representatives.

“There will be admissions repre-
sentatives from about 30 law schools
here,” Cappeto said. W&L, the Univ-
ersity of Virginia, Notre Dame,
Boston College and Georgetown as

_ well as many smaller schools will be

in attendance.

Although the Pre-Law Forum will
be held here at W&L, invitations have
been extended to other area colleges.
Students from Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College, Sweet Briar, Virginia
Military Institute and Hampden-
Sydney College will attend the
Forum. Therefore, Dean Cappeto
suggests that W&L students arrive
early.

“It would be advisable for stu-
dents, especially seniors, to have
specific questions in mind when they
meet with the admission represen-
tatives. Good questions would in-
clude references to difficulty of ad-
mission, housing situations, social
life and post-graduation placement
records. Seniors should definitely be
prepared to talk admissions.’

Yale’s Law School, which will be
unable to attend Friday’s sessions,
will be here next week. Appointments
are available through the Placement
Office.

The Washington and Lee football
team held off a second-half come-
back by the University of the South,
defeating the Tigers, 17-14, Saturday
at Wilson Field.

The Generals led 14-0 at halftime
and appeared to have control of the
game before Sewanee, led by quar-
terback Bobby Morales, came back
to tie the game early in the fourth
quarter. W&L placekicker James
White kicked a 23-yard field goal
later in the quarter, giving the
Generals the victory.

W&L scored on its first possession
of the game, driving 93 yards in 11
plays for a touchdown. Quarterback
Jon Thornton, starting his first game
for the Generals, connected with
wide receiver Randy Brown for a 49-
yard pass completion on the Gene-
rals’ second offensive play, moving
the ball to the Sewanee 37-yard line.
Later in the drive, Thornton hit
Brown for 10 yards on a crucial third
down situation. Three plays later,
fullback Frank Surface scored from
the three, and White added the con-
version to make the score 7-0.

Early in the second quarter, the
Generals had apparently scored their
second touchdown when Thornton
passed 23 yards to tight end Ian Ban-
well. The score was nullified by a
holding penalty. The drive stalled
after the penalty, and a bad snap
from center ona 48-yard field goal at-
tempt ended the Generals’ scoring
hopes.

W&L increased its lead to 14-0 on
its next possession when it drove 80
yards in nine plays. Thornton com-
pleted a pair of 43-yard strikes to
wingback Lee Cummings and tail-
back Gene Girard during the drive,
both coming on third-and-long situa-
tions. Girard scored on a one-yard
run with only :17 remaining in the
first half, making the score 14-0 at
halftime.

The second half was quite a differ-
ent game as Morales passed for 220
yards against the Generals’ defense
during the final two quarters.
Morales passed 63 yards to Lee Pride
for the Tigers’ first score less than
five minutes into the third quarter,
cutting the Generals’ lead to 14-7.

Morales drove his team 49 yards
for a touchdown on its first posses-
sion of the fourth quarter after
Thornton had suffered his only inter-
ception of the game. After complet-
ing passes of 19 and 18 yards, Mor-
ales threw four yards to David Pack
for a touchdown, evening the score at
14-14.

W&L's Gene Girard (34) hauls in a 43-yard bomb
from quarterback Jon Thornton to set up the Generals

W&L freshman Jeff Harwood
broke through the line and blocked a
punt on Sewanee’s next possession.
Chris Bleggi recovered the ball at the
Tigers’ nine-yard line. After three
plays had netted only three yards,
White kicked the game-winning field
goal, giving the Generals a 17-14 lead
with 5:23 remaining in the game.

The Tigers made one last attempt
to win the game, and came a bit too
close for comfort. Sewanee drove
from its own 22-yard line to the Gen-
erals’ 29 before W&L strong safety
Tim Janyska intercepted a Morales’
pass with 3:25 remaining in the
game. W&L was able to run out the
clock after the interception.

Thornton had his second consecu-
tive 200-yard passing game, complet-
ing nine of 18 passes for 210 yards.
Girard rushed for 60 yards on 21 car-
ries and caught two passes for 76

yards.

Morales completed 15 of 33 tosses
for 267 yards and two touchdowns.
W&L improved its record to 3-4 with
the win, while Sewanee dropped to
0-6.

“We were lucky to get out of that
game with a 17-14 win,’’ W&L head
coach Gary Fallon said. ‘‘The block-
ed punt was, obviously, a key to our
victory, and the field goal, from a
tough angle, was a clutchkick.

“Jon Thornton had a great day
throwing the ball,” Fallon said. ‘He
has shown he can complete the bomb,
which has opened some opportunities
for the offense.”

W&L faces Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Bridgewater
(1-5) this week at Bridgewater.

“They will pose the same kind of
problems to us as Sewanee,” Fallon
said, ‘They have a good passing
team anda good running back.”’

W&L defeated Bridgewater 42-7
last year but has lost to the Eagles
the last two times it has traveled to

Bridgewater.

“The biggest thing we’re concern-
ed about is that we don’t get compla-
cent,’”’ Fallon said. ‘‘We’ve learned
about that the hard way in the past at
Bridgewater.”’

“It is their Parents’ Weekend, so I
know they will be zapped up to play
us,” Fallon said. ‘They have nothing
to lose. If we’re not ready, it will be a
long afternoon.”’

Bridgewater head coach John
Spencer said that W&L is a better
team than its record indicates.

“After looking at them on film, I
think that they have a pretty good

second touchdown in Saturday's 17-14 victory over the
University of the South.

team,”’ Spencer said. ‘“‘They have
three good running backs in Girard,
Surface and Weaver, and Thornton is
a threat. The things they do best on
offense are our weaknesses.”’

“I anticipate W&L playing well
against us because they see us, Sam-
ford and Lebanon Valley left on their
schedule. Their coaching staff and
players are looking at a 6-4 record,
which is very creditable.”’

“I don’t think there’s any chance of
us catching them unaware,’’ Spencer
said. ‘‘We’ll have to play as well as
we possibly can and be lucky in order
towin.”

Richmond remains only thorn in
polo side as showdown nears

The Washington and Lee water
bolo team continues to roll along,
‘make the necessary adjustments,
and, above all, win.

- The Generals won four of five con-
tests in the Southern League Tourna-
‘ifient held at Cy Twombly Pool last
weekend, dropping only an 11-2 deci-
sion against the league’s best team,
tichmond. The tournament decided
the seedings for the Southern League
Championships to be held in Rich-
Ynond Nov. 2-4.

W&L (now 14-11-1) beat UNC-
Chapel Hill, 19-3, U.Va., 10-1, UNC-
"Wilmington, 12-5, and South Car-
olina, 144.

“We have been making some ad-
justments to our offense, and we are
making some mistakes. But on the

Kickers upset touted Messiah, .

whole I would say that I am very
pleased with the way we are play-
ing,’ water polo mentor Page
Remillard said.

“Some of our freshmen had a
rough time against Richmond, but
they bounced back the next day and
helped us to two more victories.
Richmond has a lot of experience and
a good bench. We were just beat by a
better team that day.”’

The Generals will have another op-
portunity to meet the Spiders, when
the teams square off against each
other in the Southern League Cham-
pionships. Richmond, which went
through the tournament undefeated,
will be seeded first. With the Rich-
mond loss, W&L will be second seed
in Richmond.

W&L is the defending Southern
League Champion, and winner of the
conference crown the last three
years. In 1983, Richmond had beaten
W&L three times prior to the final of
the championships, when the Gene-
rals were able to turn the tide with a
7-4 upset of the Spiders.

Richmond has won the first two
games this year, taking the first
meeting in the Virginia State Cham-
pionships, 148.

‘‘We must continue to improve dur-
ing the next two weeks, and must
work on our man-advantage situa-
tions. We have next weekend off, and
I am giving the team the time off to
rest up for the championships,”
Remillard said.

“The Washington and Lee soccer
team defeated Messiah College in a
3-4) upset victory Saturday. Messiah
College, described as one of the re-
gion’s best soccer teams, played in
last year’s NCAA soccer tournament.

: Head coach Rolf Piranian attrib-
uted the victory to aggressive de-
fensive play, highlighted by the ef-
forts of goalie Chris Gareis and full-
back Chip Landis. Gareis made 12
saves in the course of play to tally his
third shutout of the season. Gareis
now has a goals against average un-
der one.

The team’s three goals were scored
by John Templeton, Peter Von Son
4nd Bill Holmes. Templeton
gonverted a throw-in for the first tal-
ly, giving the Generals a 1-0 halftime
advantage. Von Son scored in the sec-
and half on a shot directly in front of
the goal, and Bill Holmes added a
third goal off a corner kick.

“I’m proud of the way the team has
bounced back,’’ Coach Piranian said.
The team had lost its last three con-
tests. But Piranian said the team has
no chance of getting into the Division
III National Championships because
of the previous losses.

Piranian said the Generals still
have a shot at taking the Old Domi-

3-1 conference record puts them in
second place now, and if conference
leader Lynchburg loses its upcoming
game and the Generals are able to

Saturday, the Generals will travel
to North Carolina where they will put
their 5-5 record on the line against the
nation’s No. 1-ranked Division III

this is one of the major purposes of
the theater anywhere.”

Conroy said his major goal tor
being an actor-in-residence here is to
provide a role mode! for the students

“It works by example at the theat-
er here,’’ he said. ‘‘More of the learn-
ing comes through osmosis than
anything else. People get a chance to
observe what I do and it may inspire
some or it may not touch others at
all.”

“Ultimately,’’ he added, ‘“‘being
here provides a chance for an en
counter which can be enlightening.”

“Yet every time I come to a new
part, I always learn things, too. It’s
interesting to me to learn how differ-
ent people can achieve the same
thing from different approaches,”
Conroy said.

Conroy said not many things irri-
tate him.

‘What I do find irritating,’ he add-
ed, ‘‘is people wasting an opportunity
to experience something new. One
must assume by their presence that
this is something they want. It’s
strange when they don't pursue it.”’

“T haven't been asked enough ques-
tions in this situation by the stu-
dents,” he said. ‘‘I would love to be
asked questions about how they
might achieve some of their goals.

“IT would like to be asked more
often how they would like to arrive at
where they want to.”’

Conroy said his most dangerous
role was in the film, ‘‘Heaven’s
Gate.”

“It was at times very dangerous,
and there were hundreds of extras.
While trying to survive one of the ma-
jor battle scenes, I fell under a horse.
Luckily, the animal stepped right
over me instead of on me.

“That was the day,’’ continued
Conroy, ‘‘that I just wanted to get out
alive.”

In discussing his ideal part; Con-
roy Said he could ‘‘get excited’’ over
Richard III or ‘‘that Scottish play.”’

Asked to explain “that Scottish
play,’ Conroy simply pointed to a
piece of paper with the name ‘‘Mac-
beth” on it.

“There is a superstition,’’ he add-
ed, and it’s referred to as ‘‘that Scot-
tish play’’ because it’s bad luck to
mention it at the theater unless it is in
production, and then you can’t avoid
it.

“If you mention ‘it’ in a dressing
room, you can be asked to go outside,
turn around three times, and spit.
Some actors I know are absolutely

serious about it.’’

are damaging European, Latin

tions.

“Only if you bring down the budget
deficit is there hope for decreasing
interest rates,’’ he said. He added
that if that were accomplished,
American industry would “once
again become competitive with the
rest of the world.”’

Schmidt urged the United States to
seize the initiative in leading Western
countries to solutions to global pro-
blems.

“It’s absolutely unlikely that
leadership will come from Japan in
this generation, so leadership has to
come from this country,’’ he said.
‘*You have ail the qualities — energy,
vitality, generosity and that quality
so indigestible for us Europeans, that
optimism of yours.”’

At a press conference yesterday
afternoon, Schmidt said an example
of the leadership that is needed in the
world today is former president
Richard M. Nixon.

‘‘However you evaluate his domes-
tic policies, from a European point of
view and a European point of inter-
est, as regards grand strategy, in our
eyes he was a great strategist,”’ he
said. ‘‘That was leadership.”’

He said he is asked at each stop on

his tour which of the two candidates
he favors in the presidential race. ‘‘I

 

always answer in the same fashion,
he said as the reporters listened in
tently.

“Tl always say I won't interfere ir
your American election. But if you
ask me about three times, I'll finally
say that I support Gerald Ford for
president.”’

Following the news conference,
Schmidt reviewed the Corps of Ca
dets at a dress parade such as the one
held at VMI each Friday. The 100
piece regimental band played the
German national anthem.

A VMI custodian who had been
working on the sound system remov
ed his baseball cap and placed it over
his heart as the American flag was
lowered.

A cadet cameraman and a sound
man walked along the side of the
field, recording the event. Apparent
ly out of habit, the two walked ir
perfect step with each other.

Accompanied by a 4-year-old gir!
two people from Rockbridge County
who said they come to the parades
each week to protest stood along th
sidelines holding a sign which reac’
“There is no way to peace. Peace is
the way.”

A VMI security guard told then
they could hold the sign but asked
them not to wave it. ‘‘They said it’s
special parade and they don’t want to
offend anybody,’’ Phil Hyre said
“It’s never been offensive before.”

Mirabai McLeod, the other sandal!
clad person holding the sign, said her
daughter ‘‘gets a kick out of the par
ade but she gets scared when the can
non goes off.”’

charged that the public trial was attended by students’
dates, even though public trials are supposed to be open
only to members of the W&L community

White said that when he was informed of the decision,
he planned to drop out of the Law School, but he now
says he will try to complete his degree.

White acknowledged Tuesday that he has been a
controversial administrator, but he added that the
nature of his job, at a school with few minority students,
compels him to be controversial.

“If I wasn’t controversial, I wouldn't be doing my
job,’’ he said. ‘‘I think the record shows I've done a
competent job.”’

‘I’m deeply committed to what I think the University
should stand for,”’ he said, ‘‘which is probably one of the
reasons I’m in all the trouble I am.”’

“You've got to realize that there is a group of students
who came here for the very reason that there are few
minorities,’ White told the Law News.

‘Many of the white students here have never had to
deal with blacks as equals,” he said. ‘‘Their unen-
lightened attitude is difficult to overcome.”

For those reasons, White said, black students have
difficulty participating in a system dominated by
whites.

At its meeting Monday night, the EC decided not to
make a formal response to White’s statements, al-
though several informal remarks were made while the
committee discussed the article.

The committee decided to talk with black students in-
dividually and informally to gauge their opinions about

 

‘I don’t think it’s the position of an administrator to
say anything about the honor system that’s not in sup-
port of it," Secretary Sam Dalton said. He added that
Wilson advised the committee not to make an issue of
the article.

White said he felt able to comment on the honor
system because he is a law student under the jurisdic-
tion of the system.

He said the article is not about the John White who
lost a trial to the EC and wanted to get back at the com-
mittee. ‘ ‘It’ s about me losing confidence in a system I
believe in,’’ he said

He added that interviews with black students led him
to believe they feared the EC. He also said they felt that
budget allocations for the Student Association for Black
Unity hadn’t been fair in past years. SABU did not re-
quest funds from the EC this year.

White also said the honor system is the only system he
knows of in which the same people who investigate a
case try that case.

White’s dual role as administrator and student was
called into question during last spring’s public honor
trial, a pre-trial hearing which was marked by White’s
alleged attack on Green.

According to honor system rules, White was eligible
to serve as an advocate because he is enrolled as a stu-
dent, but Green, the senior law representative to the
EC, said White's position as an administrator could not
be ignored in such an incident.

The attack, which Green said included a blow to his
stomach and resulted in his landing on the floor, was
reported to the administration by Green and another
EC member, but no public action was taken against
White.

Saying he was a little shocked by Wilson’s decision,
White could not predict where he would find his next
job.

Sophomore John Rowe gets ready to give blood Tuesday.

219 donate at blood drive Tuesday

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

Whether it was the first time, or as
in the case of Anne De Vogt the 32nd
time, 219 members of the Washington
and Lee community participated in
the American Red Cross Blood-
mobile Tuesday at Doremus Gym.

DeVogt, wife of business adminis-
tration Professor John DeVogt, said
she gave blood for the first time when
she was in college to help her sorority

‘to get 100 percent participation.

The bloodmobile, sponsored by Chi
Psi fraternity surpassed the goal of
150 units and exceeded last year’s
total of 207 units. ‘This was the best
year by far,”’ said Tim Considine, a

Chi Psi member and major organizer
of the drive. Henry Dewing, presi-
dent of the fraternity, attributed the
outstanding participation to the in-
creased publicity on campus and

around the Lexington community.

‘“There’s been a big turnaround,”
Dewing commented. He went on to
explain that the Red Cross had near-
ly dropped the W&L Community four
years earlier because of a lack of in-
volvement. The bloodmobile exper-
ience is not new to Dewing. Andy De-
wing, his older brother, revitalized
W&L’s interest in the blood donation
program.

Dewing said the awarding of kegs
to fraternities with the highest par-
ticipation also was a factor in spark-
ing interest. The ROTC captured one
keg with a total number of 37 mem-
bers participating. The fraternity
that had the highest percentage of
participation has not yet been deter-
mined. Chi Psi and Sigma Chi donat-
ed the kegs to the blood drive.

People gave various reasons for
donating blood. A number of people,
such as freshman Wyatt Bassett,

said they gave blood because it was
“easy’’ and that they felt they were
‘doing some good.”’

Junior Rick Zahn, who said he was
somewhat concerned that he was
going to pass out, calmly started that
he was giving blood because ‘‘it’s
something todo.”

“T feel that I’m doing something
worthwhile and besides, I don’t feel
so bad about taking an hour off from
studying,” he said. ‘‘The free lunch is
pretty good, too.”’

Libby Atthowe, executive secre-
tary of the Rockbridge area Red

‘Cross Chapter, said that the units of

blood will be distributed to 38
hospitals in the region. Atthowe also
said that this year’s drive had gone
more smoothly than _ previous
bloodmobiles when men had ‘‘passed
out at the typewriter while giving the
typist their names.”’

than that, it makes the student a free
agent in the world of finding informa-
tion. He’s not beholden to somebody
else.”’

With students, the most popular
aspect of library services is the 24-
hour schedule, which runs ‘‘a real
close race” with locked carrels, be
said.

Leach said ‘‘any administration is
going to have moments of frustration
— and sometimes plenty of them.”

“T’ve always enjoyed my work so
much that the frustrations have not
left a scar or a vivid memory,” he
said. ‘‘A good administrator expects
the frustrations, deals with them and
then moves forward rather than
backward.”

Leach said there has been some
staff turnover under his administra-
tion, but said that “‘like in anything
where there are a lot of people, there
is going to be a variety of movements
of people.”’

“It’s not unreasonable to say that
75 percent of the people who have left

here have moved on to positions of
even greater magnitude than the
ones they held here,”’ he said.

“‘T like to think that we're a feeder
for the profession, and that’s a good
reputation to have,”’ he continued

“‘When we seek a new member of
the staff, we frequently look at people
who are young in their careers and
offer them the challenge of meeting.a
major responsibility,’ he said,
“After that, they may move on to a

He called his staff ‘‘very strong”
and said it felt “attached to the in-
stitution.”

Leach said the part of his job he’ll
miss the most is ‘‘the contact with
students and the chance to chat with
them.”

He said he’ll spend most of next
year studying Friends of the Library
programs at other institutions. He
said he may travel in the spring, but
it’s more likely to be to the British
Isles than to the Middle East.

“T've been a refugee from there
twice in my life and twice is enough,”
he said.

“A program like this is a marve-
lous boon to a library,’’ said Devel-

on gifts of money, but also on price-
less collections of volumes.”’

EC says pledge not always

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

After discussing the strength of the
Honor System at the Law School, the
Executive Committee decided not to
require law students to sign the honor
pledge on assignments other than
finalexams.

Law representatives Gordy Ham-
mock and James Crutchfield said
that law students regularly sign the
pledge only on the final exam of a
class, and not on papers or assign-
ments turned in during the term.

“‘T don’t think there’s any point in
it,’’ Crutchfield said.

EC President Cole Dawson said the
pledge is used to reinforce the Honor
System on a daily basis, but Ham-
mock said that law students would
not take kindly to being told to pledge
all their work.

“It’s my advice to leave that thing
alone,’’ Hammock said.

Dawson agreed, recalling upper-
class law students’ reluctance last
year to sign honor cards, which say a
student understands and agrees to
abide by the Honor System, after it
was discovered that some of them did
not sign the cards when they first ar-
rived at W&L,

“T think everybody does their own
work over there, basically,’’ Ham-
mock said.

Crutchfield said he had trouble de-
fining what constitutes an honor
violation with regard to talking about
assignments.

“It seems extreme to bring some-
one up on an honor charge for saying,
‘This is really hard,’ ‘‘ Crutchfield
said.

“That’s a problem every year,”
Hammock said. ‘‘I don’t think they-
re cheating.”’

necessary for law students

\

The committee also decided to use '

the wording of the pledge found in the
White Book for posters to be placed in
classrooms telling students the form
of the pledge.

In other action, White announced
that the EC is planning to put the
$7,000 in the EC’s reserve fund, which
is used to bail out student organiza-
tions that overrun their budgets, into

~,.

a money market fund at 11 percent -

interest toraise about $385.
“There’s a major roadblock in that

Vie

the Business Office says they don’t -
really want to deal with it because ,

it’s too much trouble,’”’ White said.
He said that he will talk with Presi-
dent Wilson today ‘‘to get him to pull
some strings.”’

White said that the extra money
would be used for some of the organ-
izations that the EC thinks deserves

more money than was allocated to *

them last month.

be completed by the fall of 1987.

The Planning and Development
Committee also will review the res-
ponse of alumni to the coeducation
decision as expressed financially and
in communications with the school.

The board will consider a number
of subjects other than coeducation.

The recently formed Campus Life
Committee will be briefed by Dean of
Students Lewis G. John and Asso-
ciate Dean of Students Dan N. Mur-

governing parties and this fall’s
fraternity Rush.

The committee will also receive a
status report about the Drug Policy
Review Committee, which began
work last month. The trustees direc-

ted in May that the committee be
formed in response to recommenda-
tions from the special grand jury that
investigated local drug trafficking
earlier this year.

The Academic Affairs Committee
will take an in-depth look at the
English department as part of its
regular review of the different dis-
ciplines, and the Budget and Audit
Committee will assess the implica-
tions for the University of recent
changes in federal tax law.

tem that was installed this summer.

The Investment Committee will

died in May, and Wilson said Col.

summer, left the school approxima-
tely $2.5 million.

Tailgate and more§
slated for parents »”

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

As students desperately clean their
rooms and the grass around the cam-
pus is gently manicured, all the
evidence points to one event:
Parents’ Weekend.

The weekend, which kicks off
tomorrow at 10 a.m. and runs
through Sunday afternoon, will be
highlighted by two events in Lee
Chapel: a Friday evening concert
featuring the Glee Club and the Brass
and Percussion Ensemble at 8 p.m.
and the annual Report to Parents by
University President John D. Wilson
at11:30a.m. Saturday.

Anew event this Parents’ Weekend
is a tailgate party sponsored by the
Interfraternity Council and the
Alumni Association. It will be held
from 11:30a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Saturday
on the Upper Athletic Field. A blue-
grass band will play, and fraternities
are being encouraged to take their

lunches and receptions for parents up
there.

“It’s a school-wide event that will
help to bring everyone together right
before the football and soccer
games,’’ said Jim Kerr, one of the
students assisting the Alumni Assoc-
iation in planning the event. ‘‘The en-
thusiasm from that should carry over
to the bailgames.”’

The football game is at 1:30 p.m.
and the soccer game is at 2 p.m.

Parents will be able to participate
in open houses in University depart-
ments Friday and Saturday and in
seminars Saturday morning with stu-
dent leaders and members of the
faculty and administration.

In addition, the University Theatre
will present Sean O’Casey’s ‘‘Juno
and the Paycock”’ Saturday evening.

“The major reason for Parents’
Weekend is to make them feel a part
of the University and to see their sons
in action,’ said Carter McNeese,

The Washington and Lee Board of
Trustees said this weekend that it

must approve any changes in the new

fraternity party regulations that took
effect this fall

Student Body President Cole Daw
son said the trustees would review
any proposed rule alterations be-
cause the board approved plans for
the student activities pavilion with
the understanding that the new rules
would be in place

Dawson participated in a combined

meeting of the Planning and
Development and Campus Life
committees Friday and made a

report to the entire board Saturday

Possible changes in the social
rules, which include provisions re
stricting Wednesday night parties
and limiting each fraternity to four
party weekends per term, have been
debated at Student Affairs Commit
tee meetings for the last several
weeks,

“The trustees care only that they
made these rules, and for the rules to
be changed, it needs to come through
them,’’ Dawson said

He said he explained to board

members student dissatisfaction
with the new rules and ‘‘they under-
stood the student view.”’

“‘] told them the students were very

hey are aware of the problem

now,’ he continued. ““‘They didn't
realize it was such a big deal.’’ He
said some trustees felt that although
the situation was out of hand last
year, ‘‘now we've gone too far and
maybe need to come back a little
bit.”

“Hopefully SAC can come up with
a happy medium to present,’’ Daw-
son said

He said he feels the ideal plan is
one under which fraternities would
be allowed to party at their house two
Wednesday nights per month, and
they would be permitted to party
with one — and only one other
house

Dawson said the four-party-per
term rule ‘‘is no big deal’ to him. “I
don't see any problem with that,” he
said

University President John D. Wil-
son said yesterday that the board dis-
cussed student reaction to the new
rules

“| think they heard that students
were unhappy about the present par-
ty legislation,’ he said. ‘‘The board is
concerned that the students are con-

Washington and Lee’s faculty is unable to
agree whether professors here tend more
toward liberalism or toward conservatism,
according to aninformal survey.

History Professor Jefferson Davis Futch
claims the faculty is ‘‘frantically”’ liberal.

“The faculty has a dream,”’ he said. ‘‘The
faculty is convinced that Mondale is really
McGovern and Ferraro is really Jane Fon-
da.”

Futch said the disparity between presum-
ed student opinion and faculty opinion ‘‘is a
disparity that is reflected all over this coun-
try.”

“Td say that a great many professors are
in love with the New Deal and statism, and
this is reflected in a lot of professorial
views,’’ he said. ‘‘I don’t think many students
think in those terms.”

“My feeling is that graduate schools have
been this way for the last 50 years, and this
has been reflected in faculty feeling around
the country,’ he continued. ‘‘It’s the same at
Harvard as it is at the University of New
Mexico.”

‘I've been puzzled by the attraction of the
teaching profession to liberals since I was an
undergraduate at Johns Hopkins,’ Futch
said. ‘I’ve been puzzled by it for 30 years.”’

Biology Professor Thomas Nye, however,
maintains that ‘‘a strong liberal here at W&L

would be pretty lonesome.”

“We are more conservative at W&L than
many schools, but in recent years, we've
come closer to parity than when I came here
in 1966,’’ he said. ‘‘Then, there were some
very conservative faculty members who are

 

in the next few years with the admission of
women,” he said. ‘‘I don’t think the libe-
ral/conservative mixture will change much.”

Politics Professor John Handelman echoed
some of Nye’s sentiments, but offered some
harsher criticism of students here.

“The faculty is moderately more conser-
vative here than on a national basis,’’ he
said. ‘Something to keep in mind: there are
a number of faculty members who are W&L
grads, and that queers the whole thing up.”

“You have to be somewhat careful here
who you talk to seriously about issues,”’ he
said. ‘Everyone knows everyone else’s bus-
iness, and it tends to breed conservatism.”

“| do think a good conservative is a good
person,’’ Handelman continued. ‘There is a
sound intellectual position that can be main-
tained if it's done ina tidy way.”

Handelman said he wonders, though, if
students are aware of views other than their
dogmatic conservative positions

“| feel like throwing erasers at them to get
them to see both ways,’ he said. ‘I like to
play the devil's advocate.”

Religion and ethics Professor Louis Hod
ges noted the ambiguities of the words ‘‘con
servative’’ and ‘‘liberal,’’ but concluded that
the faculty tends to be liberal

‘The problem is how you define ‘liberal
Hodges said. ‘‘One widely-used definition is
someone who favors more rather than te
public programs for social problems

“Comparing the faculty to the national
population, I guess you would say they al
more liberal — you would hope so, if ‘liberal
arts’ means liberating the mind,” he con

OPINION

Have the media
missed the beat?

As another political campaign draws to a close, the role of
the media in covering that campaign and of candidates in
playing to the media once again has been in the spotlight. Lit-
tle doubt exists that the media do have a right to cover
political campaigns — how else would the majority of voters
get the objective information they need to make informed
decisions in the voting booths? But have we given the media
too much control over political campaigns? Do the media set
the political agenda by determining what issues the candi-
dates address and how they are perceived by the public?

 

The answer, at least partially, must be yes, although the
fault does not lie solely with the media.

An example occurred here on the Washington and Lee
campus just a week ago. U.S. Sen. John Warner, a Republi-
can from Virginia (and a W&L alumnus) running for re-
election against Democratic challenger Edythe Harrison,
spent about 45 minutes at W&L during a brief (and his only)
campaign swing through Lexington.

Accompanying Warner were reporters from three of the
larger state newspapers, United Press International and sev-
eral local television stations. For the most part, these
reporters have followed Warner around the state for several
weeks now. (They ride in one van; Warner and his aides ride
in another. )

Most of what Warner told the about 150 students on the
steps in front of Lee Chapel was old verbiage to these
reporters. They knew he told nearly every audience that this
was the campaign appearance to which he’d most been look-
ing forward. And so they didn’t pay much attention to what
he said. Instead, they eagerly awaited the conclusion of his
speech, when they hoped to be able to ask him about cam-
paign contributions he’d received from Political Action Com-
mittees representing defense contractors cited for overpric-
ing spare parts.

Sure enough, after Warner had finished speaking and had
several seconds to shake a few hands, he was surrounded by
the reporters for what was described later as an impromptu
press conference. Warner’s answers to questions about his
and Harrison’s campaign finances gave the reporters some-
thing they considered newsworthy and thus could write
about.

So when W&L students picked up their morning papers Fri-
day, they found stories about Warner datelined LEXING-
TON. Expecting to read about his remarks to the students at
W&L, they were surprised to find instead a story about PAC
contributions. Only one of the stories even mentioned what he
told the students (and then in two paragraphs three-fourths
of the way through the story).

While it undoubtedly is important for the media to deter-
mine (and for the public to know) who gives financial support
to candidates for public office, that seems less significant
than the public’s getting to know and understand the candi-
date and his positions.

The media’s domination of last Thursday’s campaign ap-
pearance was damaging in two respects. First, it did not en-
able W&L students, many of whom live in Virginia and will
have an opportunity to vote for Warner, to talk to him further
about his ideas and policies and his days as a W&L student.
The media is with Warner every day, whereas this was his
only appearance at W&L.

Secondly, many readers of the ensuing news accounts are
just beginning to decide for whom they’ll vote Tuesday. They
want to know John Warner’s position on the Equal Rights
Amendment and his stand on nuclear disarmament — they
don’t care about his PAC contributions; he’s got more than
enough money, anyway. But the media who’ve been follow-
ing him for a month or longer are more than aware of and, in-
deed, are bored with, his positions on those issues; they’re
looking for something new about which to write. This is not
entirely the media’s fault — if they printed the candidates’
position papers every day, no one would buy the newspaper.

Part of the problem could be alleviated by allowing report-
ers to have contact with Warner (and other political cand-
idates) at times other than during scheduled campaign ap-
pearances. For example, Warner’s handlers could schedule
one leg (presumably short) of each day’s trip during which
the candidate would ride in the press van and talk with the
reporters.

This would give the media greater access to the candidate
and would enable the candidate, during his public appear-
ances, to concentrate on the public and its concerns rather
than the media and what’s going to be on the 6 o’clock news.

Readying for the ‘rents

OUR VIEW

By Mike McAlevey
and Scott Henderson

It’s that time again, parents will be
leaving the peaceful tranquility of
‘their homes to make their perfunc-
tory pilgrimage to our own version of
Gomorra. This event, of course,
necessitates the conscientious
preparation by all parties involved to
make the campus presentable. Build-
ings and grounds will certainly be
mowing and blowing the leaves,
creating an audible chaos that could
rival even the commotion caused by
a group of Baldwin girls that have
collectively lost their curling irons.
Fraternities will make their best ef-
forts to reduce the possibility of
parents contracting infectuous
diseases from the accumulated beer
pool swill, sticky contaminated toilet
seats and non-paying rodent
residents. And certainly the highlight
and cause of all these preliminary
measures, the future grounds
keepers and fraternity national
representitives, the sons, will be for-
mulating their last minute stratagem
to accomplish their goals.

Of course, the most prominent fac-
tion will be those conniving fund-
seekers. The first order of business to
be reckoned with by these impres-
sion-conscious mamma’s boys will be
the establishment of some semblance
of cleanliness and order of the self,
personal domain and possessions.
These activities will include doing
Everest-sized loads of filth-ridden
laundry permitting only two or three
at the same time in any given laun-
dromat and causing a_ general
quarter shortage sure to elicit video
game withdrawal from a majority of
the campus population. Wendell’s,
Marie’s and Shirley’s will be innun-
dated with mopheaded minds paying
top dollar to be transformed back in-
to that clean-cut image possessed the
last time mommy and daddy saw

Bella’s

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

 

 

As I sat listening to Bella Abzug
speak Monday night at Sweet Briar, I
couldn’t help but think that I was
listening to an American hero whose
time had passed. I know some think I
stand to the right of Attila the Hun.
But I still like Bella Abzug, although I
disagree with her political stands.

Towards the end of her speech, she
addressed the question of why many
youth today are increasingly regis-
tering as Republicans. A recent
Gallup poll identified President
Ronald Reagan’s strongest support
as coming from voters in the 18-29
age bracket. These voters prefer
Reagan over Mondale by almost a 2-
to-1 margin. Why has the Democratic
party lost what during the activist
1960s was its strongest voting bloc
—young voters?

Simply, the Democratic party no
longer is the party of leaders. No one
has a vision for the future that has
been translated into action in the pre-
sent. No one has a crusade that they
believe in and for which they are will-
ing to sacrifice much more than their
name. We lack role models in this
generation. That is, we have no Bella
Abzugs, no more Ronald Reagans.

Is it any surprise then, that young
people are turning to the Republican
party for their future? We have seen
and can judge what lower interest
rates mean, what lower inflation
amounts to, and what a sense of
direction can mean. We have an idea
of what we want and we know those
who possess the leadership to bring
us closer to that goal.

And then we see what appears to be
the miracle of Ronald Reagan and
the new prosperity he brought to the
country. Sure, a few people were
unemployed in the recession of 1982,
but we cannot relate to figures that

their gradually degenerating son.
Broken stereos, tv’s and furniture
are definitely removed serving only
as direct evidence of an economical
ineptitude sure to thwart the cause
soon to be at hand. The car is washed
and waxed and detoxified, and all
“cigarette” burns are cleverly con-
cealed in an attempt to lend veracity
to the ensuing pleas for beans, skins,
or dollars, depending on which Fiji
one asks. This facade being com-
plete, the student lays in wait for his
suspecting prey.

Another less prominent group is
that comprised of those success con-
scious sons that desire only to con-
vince their parents of their
academic, and to a lesser extent,
social prowess. Any paper or test
that bears an acceptable grade will
be conspicuously displayed in the
most obvious of places; dorm or
apartment front doors, hotel room
pillows, etc. Most every student
possesses a favorite, or more of
ten, sympathetic professor. And
more often than not a mere handful
of these sympathizers exist in the en-
tire faculty body. These individuals
can be easily determined as those
having a voluminous line before their
door and an occasional threesome
leaving one, exhibiting tell tale
brown smudges on the nose and dirty
knees.

In an attempt to display social suc-
cess the son will resort to any
number of possibilities to obtain a
beautiful date to introduce to the
’rents. Bribery, blackmail and in ex-
treme cases, unadulterated cash in-
centives are not out of the question.

The final band of renegades is com-
posed of two sharply delineated self-
concious subgroups that result when
the parents “‘just can’t make it.’”’ One
approach to this situation will be
manifested in the dejection apparent
in the faces of the neglected in-
dividual. But probably the more com-
mon reaction, that of the other

5 =
speak of new unemployment claims
or people who have given up looking
for employment. All we know is that
recruiters are on campus and seniors
are speaking of job prospects that did
not exist two years ago.

But most of all, this generation of
students is very interested — indeed

— by material gain. We
are looking for what is available to us
— not just what is promised to us by a
patronizing federal government. We
know that success is available for
those who work hard, and a BMW in
the driveway is the sign that we have
achieved such success. We know that
opportunities to “get rich quick’’
seldom exist so instead we will
search for opportunities to get-rich-
quickly-but-not-too-fast. We measure
our success not in terms of whether
fewer people are below the poverty
line but whether we are in a higher
income bracket. The ‘‘Me-genera-
tion” is not dead.

So, when Bella Abzug conluded
that “future generations”’ will judge
us by how fair we are to the poor or
the minorities or how much we
recklessly spend in the pursuit of
something called ‘‘security and na-
tional defense,”’ it fell on deaf ears.
That is a tragedy. For in as much as
we hope to better our own lives, to
have a better future than did our
parents or to provide for our children
a better future than we ourselves
had, we need also think of those less
fortunate who also have that same vi-
sion but who, for any reason, have
not achieved that end.

Perhaps I admire Abzug for the
same reason that I admire Ronald
Reagan. They both believe in a vision
so strong that they are willing to
work themselves to the grave for the
completion of that end — albeit op-
posing ends in these cases. Both are
leaders, And that is what we -- the
emerging electorate — are looking
for.

subgroup, the other half of those
unattended students, wil] be joyfully
thwarted the deceitful efforts of the
previously mentioned groups. To ac-
complish this end they will wreck
drunken, lawless havoc over the
campus as usual and make com-
ments in front of their friends’
parents concerning drug connec-
tions, honor trials, drunk driving
charges, pregnancies, test failures
and chronicly missed classes.

Regardless of the goals in mind,
approach taken or presence or
absence of parents we're sure
everyone will make it. They always
have before. A few sons will be
richer, some poorer, some will have
guilty consciences, and some just
befuddled hungover consciences, but
at least for now, we don’t have to con-
sider daughters on our parents’
weekend.

Changes

S
s
outlined
To the Editors: ea
We wish to inform the student body.

of the changes which will be taking”
place at Centel in November when
the business office moves to Charlot-
tesville and to explain how these
changes will affect both the students
at large and the Student Telephone
Union members. si

In the future, telephone users in.
Lexington can either mail their bills
to Charlottesville in the envelope pro-
vided, or they can pay in person at
either of the Dominion Bank loca-
tions in town. If a person has a ques-
tion about his bill he can still call
463-2121. This will be a toll-free call to
Lexington area service representa-
tives in Charlottesville. Repair and

installation service will still be avail- .

able out of Lexington.

Also in the future STU members «

will be treated as normal telephone
customers regarding billing. If a bill
is final and has not been paid, phone

service will be disconnected and col- :

lection notices sent. Then, and

only then, will Centel contact STU. -
STU will pay the bill and contact the .

student for reimbursement. Trans-

cripts will be withheld until STU is «
repaid, and students who refuse to .

pay will be sent to Student Control.

Finally, students with consistently -
high phone bills will be asked to _

make an additional deposit or to take
out another membership in STU.

If a student is unable to pay his bill,
he should contact STU before phone

service is disconnected in order to -

work out some sort of arrangement.

The STU office is in Room 209 of the —
Student Center and is open from 3to4 «
p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays forthe _

fall term,

‘Feckless’ editorial
raises some eyebrows.

To the Editors:

Your Oct. 18 issue contained one of
the most feckless editorials I have
seen in your paper in the last two
years.

Changes to accommodate the en-
rollment of women and W&L are go-
ing to take a lot more strength of
character than it takes to change a
policy on courtesy titles. If you ge-
nuinely welcome the addition of
women to the student body, you know
full well the policies and attitudes
that have to change are far more
substantive than titles.

It’s nice that you open doors, give
up your seats and stand when women
enter the room. In fact, it’s quite
charming. I could even believe you if
you simply said these actions were
the result of good manners. But don’t
try to tell me that you do it out of
respect. That just isn’t true.

You need look no further than the
pages of your own paper to be certain
that your attitude toward women is
not based in esteem or respect. Hard-

ly an issue appears without some’.

Law Class of ’85

Dismissal of White
called ‘hatchet job’

To the Editors:

I have read your article (‘‘Minority
Dean ‘terminated,’ ” Oct. 25, 1984) of
Dean White’s dismissal at the end of
the academic year and I was quite
distressed by the administration’s
accusation that Dean White was an
ineffective recruiter. Actually, if one
looks at the facts, Dean White has
done an excellent job as compared to
the person who has been recruiting
lately. Dean White recruited 11
blacks for the class of 1987; in the
Class of 1988, with the admissions
department taking over, the recruit-
ed number was five black students.
And this trend will continue because
of minimal effort made by this
administration in recruiting blacks
to W&L this year.

I personally resent this hatchet job
the administration is using to dis-
credit Dean White because this
shows their lack of sensitivity to the
repression most blacks endure on
campus,

Dean White was correct: Segrega-
tion does remain firmly entrenched
at W&L. His statement that ‘‘many of
the white students here have never
had to deal with blacks as equals,” is
quite true. A blatant example of this
demeaning attitude surfaced in the
Sept. 20 issue of The Phi, which
stated, ‘‘Are minorities ‘suppressed,’
or do they purposely avoid the cam-
pus mainstream?’ As a black person
on this campus, I get tired of this in-
sulting attitude. I’ve been here al-
mest three years and this attitude
hasn’t changed.

Many blacks, including myself, are

involved in many activities and these -

kinds of statements are a slap in our |
faces.

I think the administration really —
needs to address some of these pro-
blems. When Dean White said, ‘I’m .
deeply committed to what I think the —
University should stand for,” I be- |
lieve it because he’s made it easier |
for black students to deal with the —

prevalent attitudes on campus.

And, as far as the EC and the Hon-
or System are concerned, it makes
me wonder when the EC secretary is
quoted as saying, ‘‘I don’t think it’s
the position of an administrator to
say anything about the honor system
that’s not in support of it.’’ Well,
maybe if this was the Kremlin that

might be all right, but I’m in

America where freedom of speech is
the cornerstone of our democracy.
The fact is Dean White was address-
ing the problem that minorities (and:

probably women in the future) have: ..:

no protection of our basic human’
rights under this current system.

‘
‘

In closing, I would hope that the ad-':

ministration would reinstate Dean:
White. He is not the problem. The‘
problems are race relations and dis-

i
‘
4

i.

‘

crimination within the system. I’:
would hope that President Wilson. ;

would stop this divisiveness and
come together with the minority stu-.
dents to address the real problems:
that face us. For I believe that with:
the help of the administration, as:
well as the EC, we can overcome:
these problems. ‘

On The Record ,
Buchanan: Reagan's large lead is unusual

   

 

 

Following is a partial transcript of a conversation Mon-
day between Ring-tum Phi chief editors Mike Allen and
: Bruce Potter and W&L political science Professor William
: Buchanan. Buchanan, who graduated from W&L in 1941
and joined the faculty in 1966, was chairman of the political
" science department until last spring. Potter and Allen will
« be the analysts on Cable Nine/WLUR-FM's election cover-
, age Tuesday night.
Phi: One of your classes did a computer project show-
- ing that, in theory, Walter Mondale could defeat Ronald
, Reagan. That was on paper. Is there any way that Mon-
dale could do it in real life?
‘ Buchanan: That was based on 1980 results. That is,
, Mondale is a replica of Carter and the states’ figures
are the figures for 1980 and the fellow who wrote the
‘ program made some assumptions based upon congres-
, Sional votes about the liberalism and conservatism of
these states. The class decided how important money
‘ would be and how important time spent campaigning
, would be; how important issues — and there were a
staggering number of issues, about 30 of them —would
‘have an impact and how important that impact would
, be. And so if you make all of these assumptions then
~ Mondale — the mythical Mondale — could have beaten
’ Carter in two instances with less than 50 percent of the
popular vote. Like every simulation, it’s got a lot of
assumptions in there.

Phi: Let’s put aside the simulation for a few minutes.
You're Bob Beckel or one of the other Mondale strate-
gists. What would you have done to promote your candi-

‘date in the face of this tremendously popular candi-
date?

Buchanan: I think what the Democratic party should
‘have done, given the vast gap between Reagan’s popu-
_larity and Mondale’s, would be to do more or less what

Mondale has done, and that is to stress the issues, stress
‘the weaknesses, particularly the deficit and the tax
_Matters, and perceive the election as an appeal to the

future, that is, an opportunity to say, ‘Here are all the
-things that I said in 1984.’’ Now, in 1988, the Democratic
_candidate is going to call attention to all of these things
which have gotten us into the perilous state we have got-
‘ten into since the 1984 election. That is, if the Republi-
,cans had done all those things which we say they ought
to have done, they would be in better shape, the eco-
*nomy would be in better shape, all sorts of things would
_ be better off now, in 1988. Now, that’s not the way to win
an election, and I’m not sure that there was any way,
‘given the selection of Mondale, given the knock-down,
_drag-out primary fight, given the Republican superiori-
ty in resources, television, given all the factors which
’entered into this from the beginning. This is...essential-
_.ly the party-responsibility model.

Phi: So you’re saying the Democrats should have us-
‘ed this election as a guidepost toward 1988?

. Buchanan: Well, any party should always doit, but it

seems to me that given the indication in the polls that

"you are going, in all probability, to lose this election,
-having made the bravest effort you can. But, remem-

ber, a politician is supposed only to have a myopic view
‘in which he looks only at the upcoming election.

. Phi: Now, you talk about an election of the future.

Would Gary Hart have been an effective candidate in
‘that way? Is he a man to look at in 1988? Should Demo-
:crats have looked harder at him in 1984?

_ Buchanan: I think had not the whole nominating sys-

tem been as it is, had it not been what it is, that is, had

*Mondale not gotten the support he got by starting a cou-
ple of years in advance and pinning down both money

gt
eae

    

and support, there were certainly evidences during the
spring that Hart had more appeal. So a different
nominating process might have turned up Hart as the
nominee and there’s some evidence...that Hart was a
more appealing candidate.

Phi: You talk about the nominating process. Univer-
sity of Virginia political science Professor Larry Sabato
said Walter Mondale’s become more respectable: now
he’s just a chuckle instead of a guffaw. Talk about dam-
ning with faint praise. What is it about the nominating
process that gives a major party a candidate with such
shallow support?

Buchanan: Lots of things. Principally, the impor-
tance of the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire pri-
mary, which means whoever’s in there ahead gets a

whole lot of support in the media as a result of doing
well with a trivial proportion of the Democratic voters.
And then having amassed sufficient money to get
matching federal campagin funds to do better in the
succeeding primaries, and having an organization and
all of these things, which aren’t necessarily what ap-
peal to voters.

Phi: Hart found that you live by the media sword, but
you also die by the media sword. A very similar thing
happened this summer with Geraldine Ferraro. Do you
think that she will be seen as blazing a trail as far as a
female on the ticket, or has she left a bad taste in peo-
ple’s mouths?

Buchanan: I don’t think she has. I think she survived
that very well...certainly those were legitimate news
stories.

Phi: So you think she’s a positive role model for other
female candidates?

Buchanan: Yes.

Phi: Were you surprised that her nomination doesn’t
seem to have helped Mondale more than it did?

Buchanan: Actually, one of the things I think will be
interesting to watch is what the gender gap is going to
amount to. She is a product of — not a cause of — the
gender gap...One of the interesting things to look for
after this election will be the width of the gender gap,
and my hunch is it may be wider than it would have
otherwise because Reagan is so far ahead. That is,
there may be a number of women who are more or less
sympathetic to Reagan for other reasons, who like him,
and if they thought their vote would defeat him, would
go along with him. But given this vast advantage he’s
got, they’ll say, “Well, I’ll go ahead and vote for the
Democrats just to send him a message.”’

Phi: Reagan has maintained his overwhelming lead

since the conventions. Is that surprising?

Buchanan: Surprising how? If you want toask me am
I surprised that so many people like Ronald Reagan, I'll
Say yes.

Phi: Is it unusual?

Buchanan: Yes, I think it’s rare that one candidate
stays this far ahead. Certainly Lyndon Johnson in 1964
had comparable leads. Nixon in 1972 had comparable
leads.

Phi: When the first polls came out in the beginning of
September showing Reagan with such a big lead, did
you still feel that Mondale was not yet finished and
could still come back? What would it have taken?

Buchanan: Normally, in past elections, where the
Republicans had a lead, the Democratic candidate has
clipped up close. For example, if you want to look at
1968, Humphrey was getting closer and closer after a
substantial lead by Nixon. And if you go back to the
1950s, Stevenson did a bit of this. That is, you normally
expect, when you’ve got a Republican with a substan-
tial lead, for the Democratic candidate to gain on him.
Mondale, rather than that, has peaked a little bit after
the first debate, and then has drifted gently downward,
in spite of the fact that he seems to be campaigning a lot
more effecively than he did earlier.

Phi: What sort of effect do you think Reagan’s coat-
tails will have here in the Sixth District of Virginia?
The Democratic incumbent, Jim Olin, won by a very,
very narrow margin in 1982, Will Reagan’s popularity
help the Republican candidate, Ray Garland?

Buchanan: You've got to balance that off against two
years of incumbency and a very effective cultivation of
the electorate in the district and I would say that Gar-
land has not been all that effective of a candidate. I
haven’t been following it that closely, but I would guess
that Olin will win.

Phi: A topic of discussion in the spring when Jesse
Jackson was running so well was the effect increased
black voter registration might have on the election. Al-
though that may not affect the presidental race, will it
affect some congressional races?

Buchanan: The intriguing proposition is what turnout
is going to be. It picked up in 1982 for the first time in
two decades. There’s been a lot of new registration. You
would guess that if it were going to be a close election,
that we would have a somewhat of an increase in turn-
out. On the other hand, if these people don’t vote ration-
ally in terms of Anthony Downs, but if they vote for
symbolic reasons — civic duty, or because they like
Ronald Reagan, think he’s a nice guy, or something like
that, or reaffirm their patriotic impulses or something
of that sort — then you get a fairly high turnout. And I
wouldn’t guess which of these is going to happen, al-
though I think we will know, at least be able to make
some better guesses, after we see what turnout’s like.

Phi: We’re talking about 10 and 20 point margins in
the popular vote. Should Republicans and others see
this as a mandate for Reagan to continue the agenda
that he set and is this a mandate for other candidates in
the country to push those sort of policies?

Buchanan: I would say so...Certainly if it comes out
the way the polls now indicate, you’d be compelled to
see it as a mandate. Then what happens, that’s another
very interesting proposition.

Phi: And that’s what the Democrats will be dealing
with in 1988. Now we’re talking about a Democratic
humiliation on Nov. 6 between 10 and 20 points. Are any
of these primary candidates or Mondale to be consider-
ed for 1988 or will we see new faces?

Buchanan: Oh, I think four years can make a lot of
difference.

Phi: Can it make any difference for Walter Mondale,
or is he finished?

Buchanan: On the past record, an unsuccessful candi-
date rarely gets the nomination twice. On the other
hand, if the Republicans should do badly for the next
four years, and I think, given the deficit and Mondale’s
contention that either party is going to have to raise tax-
es, they’re going to be in quite a dilemma. The Demo-
crats are going to be able to say on one hand, ‘You lied
to us,” or on the other hand, “‘You’ve ruined the
economy.” This is assuming that an increase in the
deficit over the next four years is going to have some
important adverse effect.

Phi: Do you see a bright future for Geraldine Fer-
raro?

Buchanan: Certainly, I see a brighter future for
women candidates for all sorts of offices. It seems to me
she’s done pretty well...1 would say she would be far
more credible than any woman has ever been before,
but that doesn’t mean that she’s any more credible than
some of the senators or governors or Mario Cuomo.

Phi: I’m going to ask you to play Democratic strat-
egist once again. What should the Democrats be doing
for the next few years while they're waiting for the Re-
publicans to make a disaster of the economy? What
should they be doing as far as offensive steps in looking
for 19887

Buchanan: They should have a set of principles and
programs and parlay into gains whatever weaknesses
in the Republican policy arise. For example, somebody
is going to have to decide what to do about the deficit.
What are you going to cut? Welfare and various sorts of
social programs have been cut already pretty substant-
ially. So you cut them more. That expands the group of
people who are unhappy and can accuse the Republi-
cans of lack of consideration for the underprivileged
and that can lose them some votes. Moving up into the
middle class, you revise the tax structure. Are you go-
ing to go along with the conservatives, as seems to be
suggested now, with some sort of a flat tax, or a value-
added tax, or sales tax that will again hit the lower in-
come people? Or are you going to lose the support of the
big conservative givers and the people who want a less
progressive tax? All of these decisions, whichever way
you go, are going to mean some dissent within the
Republican party. Are you going to cut defense? Can
you cut defense? The money’s in the pipeline now. It
seems to me all of the decisions they’re going to face
are potentially destructive and if you want to look at
landslides, what happened to the last two people who
won landslide victories?

Phi: Well, one of them almost went to prison. What
happened to the other?

Buchanan: The other one got us into a war that caus-
ed him to decide not to run again. So landslide victories
may not be as helpful as squeaking through.

Phi: At this point, what are the circumstances in
which the result Nov. 6 could be anything other than a
Reagan landslide?

Buchanan: If a glacier were to descend on the West,
there would be a flood in the South, leaving only an
island consisting of the Midwest and New England
states and the District of Columbia. If Reagan were to
have a stroke and Bush simultaneously were to be
shown to have had an affair with Kruschev’s daughter.
What I’m saying is, you know, it’s absurd....It’ll take a
fairly catastrophic event to overturn it.

Faculty favors Mondale, Democrats in poll

Washington and Lee faculty favor
Democrat Walter F. Mondale by
nearly a 3-1 margin over Republican
incumbent Ronald Reagan in next
week’s presidential election, accord-
ing to a Ring-tum Phi poll taken last
week.

Mondale garnered 70.3 percent of
the vote by receiving votes from 64 of
the 91 faculty members who returned
ballots. Reagan received 24 votes, or
26.4 percent, Libertarian candidate
David Bergland received one vote
and two faculty members indicated
no preference.

Of the 143 ballots mailed to faculty
members, 91 had been returned by
Tuesday, for a 63.6 percent response
rate.

Faculty members also gave strong
support to Democratic candidates for
the Senate and the House of Repre-
sentatives.

Democrat Edythe Harrison,
challenging incumbent Senator John

W. Warner, a Washington and Lee
alumnus, received 49.5 percent of the
votes to Warner’s 40.7 percent. Nine
faculty members indicated that they
either were undecided or had no
preference.

Most polls show Warner with a
wide lead heading into the election.

In Virginia’s Sixth Congressional
District, which includes Rockbridge
County, incumbent Democratic Rep.
Jim Olin easily outdistanced
Republican challenger Ray Garland
among the faculty. Olin received 84.6
percent of the votes, while Garland
managed only 15.4 percent.

Asked to classify their general
political leanings, 44 faculty
members, or 48.4 percent, described
themselves as Democrats. Of these,
nine said they are weak Democrats,
20 described themselves as average
Democrats, 14 said they are strong
Democrats and one termed himself a
Democratic Socialist.

Only 17 faculty members, or 18.7
percent, described themselves as
Republicans, and this included three
weak Republicans, five average Re-
publicans and nine strong
Republicans.

Twenty-five faculty members, 27.5
percent, called themselves _in-
dependents, two said they were
Libertarians and one described
himself as a Whig. Two faculty
members indicated no preference.

For the most part, the faculty tend-
ed to strongly support the presiden-
tial candidate they favored. Of those
who said they would vote for Mon-
dale, 64.1 percent support him
strongly, 20.3 percent gave him
average support and 15.6 percent
gave him weak support. Of those who
favor Reagan, 70.8 percent do so
strongly, 25.0 percent gave him
average support and 4.2 percent sup-
port him weakly

Mondale: ‘courage and high hope’

 

By EVERETT HAMILTON

In San Francisco and throughout the campaign,
former Vice President Walter Mondale has made
his message simple to the American people. If
they are not satisfied with the President’s record,
then he should be given a chance in the White
House. The Reagan record is weak and very un-
impressive while Mondale’s program will make
‘all’ Americans stronger to face the challenges
of the future.

If the American public does not realize this and
still plans to vote for President Reagan it must be
because of his polished rhetoric and in the words
of Mario Cuomo ‘‘the failure to separate the
salesman from the product.”

This country is facing the largest deficit of all
the former deficits combined. Unlike the Presi-
dent who promised to balance the budget by 1983,
Mondale has made a realistic and sensible pro-
mise to try to reduce it by 50 percent. This he will
do by increasing taxes, on a progressive scale,
and a 15 percent minimum tax on corporations.
Although this is unpopular and unwanted by both
Repulicans and Democrats, it is necessary to se-
cure our future. The mere fact that Mondale out-
lined his plan before Nov. 6 is an indication of his

 

honesty with Americans and how that code will be
followed during the four years of his adminis-
tration.

The Vice President is committed to increasing
the opportunities and rights of minorities and
women. His choice of Geraldine Ferraro as his
running mate, and Charles Rangel as assistant
campaign manager is a reflection of his belief.
When elected, Mondale will push for the re-intro-
duction of the Equal Rights Amendment, and
give much needed strength to the Civil Rights
Commission. He will advocate not only demo-
cracy in Central America and the Middle East,
but also in the black-majority, un-democratic na-
tion of South Africa.

A strong, but safe and efficient, national
defense will be among his top priorities. During
the past four years we have not seen a stronger
defense emerge, but instead wealthier contrac-
tors. Oddly enough, the spare parts scandal and
contract overruns have gone unnoticed by the
waste-cutting President. Instead, he focuses his
attention to slashing assistance to poor families
because they are not “‘truly needy.”

Thankfully, when Mondale is elected he will
scrap some of the costly and dangerous weapons
systems and concentrate on building convention-

al forces. He will also move swiftly to negotiate
with the Soviet Union on ways to decrease the
chances of a nuclear holocaust, something the
present administration has yet to accomplish.

Finally, this new Democratic administration
will represent all Americans by not trying to
legislate their morality. Regardless of. his per-
sonal views on abortion, he has decided that fe-
males, according to their beliefs, family values
and spiritual teachings, should make this most
private and emotional choice and not govern-
ment. Mondale supports the wisdom of the found-
ing fathers when they separated church from
state and will not join forces with the likes of the
Rev. Jerry Falwell, in demanding a constitution-
al amendment to re-establish Christian prayer in
the public schools.

Our choice is clear as a bell on Nov. 6. Walter
Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro are the only
chances this country has to redirect itself from
the failing and misguided policies of the last four
years. Without a doubt, this Democratic leader-
ship will propel America into the next decade
with warm courage and high hope.

(Hamilton is vice president of the W&L Young
Democrats).

YDs seek increased recognition

 

By JOHN ROWE
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee students
demonstrate conservative patterns
in many areas, and this conserva-
tism is especially evident in the 1984
presidential election. There are some
students in Lexington, however, who
dare to be different — those students
who are members of Young Demo-
crats.

“It’s a real challenge to work with
Young Democrats,”’ explained senior
Jim Murphy, president of the group.
“There is little Democratic support
among the students at Washington
and Lee but our members are not in-
volved just for the sake of mere par-
ticipation — they’re truly interested
in Democratic ideas.”’

Several years ago, Young Demo-
crats was an almost invisible group
on campus with little membership,
participation or efforts for growth.
Since last year, however, under the
direction of Murphy and vice-pres-
ident Everett Hamilton, a sopho-
more, the group has sought more stu-
dent involvement and increased re-
cognition on campus.

“We don’t try to compete with
more organized and larger College
Republicans,’’ Murphy noted. “I
knew before coming to W&L about
the anonymity and small size of
Young Democrats here, but I'd like
to get the group on its feet to be an
alternative to College Republicans.”’

Sophomore member Rich Erickson
said he sees the Young Democrats’
existence as a component for diversi-
ty of opinion and a stimulus for stu-
dent debate. ‘‘Having opposing polit-
ical viewpoints among the students
allows them to expand their views,
not just reinforce their existing opi-
nions,’’ Erickson said. He also noted
that some Republican-oriented stu-
dents “are a little intolerant of
others’ views, and (they) are not us-
ed to having their views challenged.”

Through the guidance of Hamilton
and Young Democrat Secretary
Dave Hanna, the student group has
seen more involvement with the De-
mocratic organization in Lexington.
Young Democrat members attended
the opening of the Democratic head-
quarters on Oct. 13 as well as an Oct.
28 fundraiser for Rep. Jim Olin.

This fall, the Young Democrats
have donated manpower and time to

the re-election campaign of Olin, the
Democratic congressman for Virgin-
ia’s sixth District, which includes
Rockbridge County. Members have
answered phones and have perform-
ed other odd jobs. On election day
Tuesday the Young Democrats will
work at the Democratic headquart-
ers at the corner of Main and Wash-
ington streets, and will help the staff
there follow the election results.

“Tt will be both fun and work,”’ said
Hamilton, ‘‘with a band, wide-screen
TV and a cash bar to entertain the
workers.”’

The group has encountered some
difficulty this year in attracting sup-
port from the statewide Democratic
organizations. Student participants
and party representatives alike are
concentrating on the campaigns of
candidates such as Olin and Edythe
Harrison, the Democratic contender
for the U.S. Senate seat of incumbent
John Warner.And although Young
Democrats may be in the minority at
W&L, the organization is both state
and nationwide. Murphy attributed
the greater participation at Virgin-
ia’s state schools to the increased
diversity that comes with a larger
student body.

“At other colleges,’’ Murphy said,
“the student body is less Repub-
lican.’’ He added that other parts of
the nation, such as his native Mas-
sachusetts, may have more Demo-
cratic awareness and interest among

the population.

“In the future, we will be working
with the YDs at the neighboring wo-
men’s colleges,’ said Hamilton.
“And YDs will also help sponsor De-
mocratic groups at the local high
schools. We want a feeder program
for younger students who will later
become voters.’’

Young Democrats at W&L is a
growing group seeking those stu-
dents who enjoy giving their time and
who want to learn more about parti-
san politics. “‘In the next two years,
I’d want to be on par with the College
Republicans,” said Hamilton, who
feels the leadership and priorities set
by him and the other officers will
strengthen the organization. ‘We
need Democratic participation to
help break that supposed Republican
monopoly at W&L,” Hamilton said.
“You don’t have to be a Republican
to be a conservative,’’ Murphy said.

Students speak out

ae, ee

on campaign issues

 

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

The 1984 presidential campaign
has been a heated, bitter contest
focusing both on issues and the
merits of two perceived styles of
government. President Reagan has
stressed the economic recovery, the
renewed American spirit of con-
fidence and a stronger defense as his
achievements; Mondale and the
Democratic party have tried to
deflate Reagan’s themes by
emphasizing the size of the national
debt, the ‘‘unfairness’’ of the benefits
of the recovery and the prospects for
a new arms race.

The two most important issues in
this election cited by W&L students
were the economy and foreign policy.
Related to the issue of the economy,
students were asked whether they
thought the economic recovery would
be able to cover the national debt or
whether Reagan would have to raise
taxes.

Senior Jim Berry said, ‘‘I think
that if he doesn’t raise taxes per se,
he will have to restructure the tax
system to bring in more revenue. I
don’t think he will actually raise the
bracket amounts.”’

Alex Reeves, a freshman, said, ‘‘I
think that to an extent the recovery
can take care of the debt. However,
sooner or later he will have to raise
taxes.’”’

Students also were asked whether
they thought the budget should be
cut, Freshman Tom McBride said, ‘‘I
don’t think they should be made on
defense. Cut some on welfare and
social security. Those programs
started by Roosevelt for a temporary
purpose should be cut some.’’ The
consensus among students seemed to
be that the level of defense spending
should be maintained, and that
budget cuts should be made in social

programs.

Students also were asked if they
agreed with Reagan’s proposal to
build a missile-defense system in
space, and what they thought of his
promise to share the technology with
the Russians. ‘‘I feel that an ultimate
defense plan is what we should strive
for,” said freshman Syd Speer. ‘‘As
to sharing the information with the
Russians, it will all depend on the

Ted Willard said he agrees with the
idea of building the system, but.
disagrees with the notion of sharing .
it. “I agree with that, but I don’t.

another much-discussed issue in the
presidential campaign. Mondale has

Reagan blames a lack of agreements -
on the fact that the Soviet leadership .
during his term has been filled by .
three men suffering from failing
health, and that the Soviets have _
been unwilling to move away from
unreasonable positions.

The prevalent opinion among W&L
students surveyed is that Reagan’s
handling of relations with the Soviets
has been good. Many said they feel
Reagan is responsible for a greater
amount of respect for the U.S. on the
part of the Soviets. :

Rep. Jim Olin

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Squaring off in their final debate before Tues-
day’s election, the two congressional candidates
from Virginia’s Sixth District, which includes
Lexington and Rockbridge County, argued
yesterday about domestic constitutional issues.

Appearing before about 130 students, faculty
and townspeople in the Moot Courtroom of Lewis
Hall, Democratic incumbent Jim Olin and Repub-
lican challenger Ray Garland answered ques-
tions about the Equal Rights Amendment, abor-
tion, school prayer and the federal budget deficit.

The candidates previously had agreed on the
topics the questions would cover, and each re-
viewed the questions before the debate.

Saying he favors the Equal Rights Amendment,
Olin added, ‘When our country was founded, we
had women, but the men voted, and the laws were
written around men. And that’s been gradually
changed over the years. It can continue to change
that way.”

Although he supported the ERA as a member of
Virginia’s General Assembly, Garland said, he
added that ‘another seven-year, divisive battle”
would result if the amendment were resubmitted

to the states.

mors ELECTION 2” 8 4rennenecnnennnen ns rn RE
Congressional candidates debate here at campaign end

“I think it would be demeaning to this great
issue to make it the subject of a divisive struggle
where people holding widely differing ideological
points of view use that issue as a kind of ideolo-
gical club to beat each other over the head with.”

In his rebuttal, Olin said, ‘‘To slough it off on
the basis that it would be divisive would be to say,
‘I’m not in favor of it.’ ”’

The candidates clashed over two religious is-
sues — abortion and school prayer. Garland argu-
ed that each issue should be presented to the na-
tion in the form of a constitutional amendment in
order that ‘‘a great national debate”’ could result.

Submitting these amendments to the people
would be “healthy and positive,’ Garland added.

“When an amendment of this kind comes be-
fore the House of Representatives,” Olin retort-
ed, ‘rather than copping out and saying, ‘We'll
transmit this to the public,’ we’re elected up there
to exercise our judgment. People want us to vote
for or against issues of this kind. . . . I think if
we're elected, we’re elected to declare our judg-
ments and vote thereon.”

After each candidate had presented his ideas
for balancing the budget, he attacked his oppo-
nent’s schemes.

Garland’s plan, which calls for a line-item veto,
a balanced budget amendment and a limit in the

growth of spending to an amount less than the
growth in revenue, “just won’t work,”’ Olin said.

“The plan is just not carefully thought out. It’s
mirrors. It’s kind of like voodoo economics. It just
doesn’t hang together.”’

“Jim,’’ Garland responded, ‘‘I just wish you'd
think what you're saying.”’

“Now, talk about voodoo economics, you must
have learned from a real expert when you came
up with your program.”’

Olin calls for a small increase in defense spend-
ing and a tightening of tax loopholes to balance
the budget in four years without actually raising
tax rates.

In his closing statement, Garland noted his be-
lief in a strong judiciary, which he called ‘‘the
single secret element in the considerations of the
Founding Fathers.”

“If you go to Congress,’ Garland added,
“‘you’ve got to have an agenda of what you want
to do when you get there. I’ve formulated that
agenda.”’

Emphasizing the importance of non-partisan
solutions to problems, Olin added, ‘‘One of the im-
portant things is, ‘How do you get things done in
government? What is the process?’ I’ve been
around this district for almost three years talking
to people, and I think I have a pretty good feel for
what they want.”

In an election year when students
and young people are being courted
‘actively by both of the major political
parties and candidates, the question
of ‘political involvement and voting
eamong Washington and Lee students
arises, :

Both of the campus political organ-
izations, the College Republicans and
the Young Democrats, have made ef-
for'ts this fall to encourage W&L stu-
dents to exercise their voting rights.

Gerald Shepherd, vice chairman of

fom that point, he said, the group
contacted those freshmen who pro-
fessed to be Republicans and inform-
ed-them of the procedure for regist-
vritig to vote and obtaining absentee

Ona statewide basis, students tend

according to Susan Fitz-Hugh of the
Virginia Board of Elections.

‘ Figures calculated for last Novem-
ber’s election show that of the
2,329,691 registered voters in Virgin-
ia, only 344,895 were men and women
between the ages of 18 and 25.

Although these numbers are not
compiled until after an election, Fitz-
Hugh said usually there is an increas-
ed interest in a presidential election
year.

The Board of Elections sends re-
presentatives to each high school in
Virginia every year to encourage
students to register and to vote, she
said. A disappointing consequence
for the board is that ‘four years
later, we are taking them off of our
records.” She said that this may be
because the students leave the state,
but she feels it is more likely that
they simply lose interest.

U.S. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., run-
ning for re-election against Demo-
crat Edythe Harrison, made what he
described as his most eagerly an-
ticipated campaign appearance of
the year at Washington and Lee last
Thursday.

“There’s no single appearance in
this campaign that I have looked for-
ward to more than this one,” alum-
nus Warner told a group of 150 stu-
dents in front of Lee Chapel.

“It was in this very spot six years
ago (during a similar campaign ap-
pearance) that I got the chemistry
that, ‘Mr. Warner, you’re going to
win this campaign.’ ”

Warner, who graduated in 1949, ad-
ded, ‘‘My association here, my learn-
ing...especially the honor code, has
been my guiding light every since I
departed this campus and it has
stood me well, particularly in public
life.”

In 25 years of public service, War-
ner said, ‘‘I have applied that honor
code to every single position that I
have been in.’’ Warner added that he

Next Tuesday, the voters in America will re-
elect Ronald Reagan and George Bush; I will join
the majority in returning these gentlemen to the
offices they have held since Jan. 20, 1981. The
Reagan-Bush team should be re-elected for seve-
ral reasons. On the domestic front, the economy
is regaining the strength it lost during previous
administrations, and a pride in America per-
vades the country. In the area of foreign policy,
the country once again enjoys respect from allies
and opponents alike. The President has withstood
the temptation to yield to the Soviets; he has
defended democracy in other parts of the world,
especially in this hemisphere. Finally, the
Reagan administration provides, to borrow a
phrase, “‘leadership you can trust.’’

Since President Reagan assumed office, inter-
est rates and inflation have dropped; employ-
ment has risen. In 1980, interest rates were
around 21 percent; today they range from 11 to 12
percent. Inflation in January of 1981 was 12 to 13
percent, it has been at the 3 to 4 percent level for
two years and will remain low again in 1984. Over
six million more people now hold jobs than ever
before, and the unemployment rate is now lower
than when Reagan entered office. This adminis-
tration has begun to control federal spending. The
rate of increase in federal spending has been re-
duced and the increase of federal regulations,
many of them being of little use, has been slowed.

 

 

Warner praises honor system

has never been challenged on mat-

In other domestic areas, the President contin-
ues to perform admirably. The National Organi-
zation of Women claims Reagan suffers from a
so-called ‘‘gender gap.’’ In fact, Mondale’s gen-
der gap is greater than the President’s. Among
women, the President enjoys support from a
strong majority. Reagan has made many new ad-
vances in appointing women to high govern-
mental positions. Sandra Day O’Connor, the first
woman to serve on the Supreme Court, is a
Reagan appointee. Jeanne Kirkpatrick, an en-
lightened Democrat, serves as ambassador to the
United Nations. Margaret Heckler and Elizabeth
Dole both hold cabinet positions. Incidentally, the
only women in the U.S. Senate are Republicans.
To those who claim the Republican Party is in-
sensitive to women, the excellent record of this
administration speaks for itself, and the ‘‘Women
for Reagan” effort is one of the strongest facets of
the campaign. Ronald Reagan has no problem
appealing to women.

President Reagan has regained the confidence
of our allies. His foreign policy is one of strength
and dedication to peace. He has made genuine at-
tempts to achieve arms control, but the Soviets
walked away from the table. He has proven that
he will not be pushed around by other govern-
ments. During the Reagan administration, no
country has fallen under communist rule, but sev-
eral countries have become democratic. Demo-
cracy has flourished in several other places. No
foreign government has held our citizens hostage

for 444 days, and in one of the most glorious days
for America in recent years, the Marines rescued
the students on the island of Grenada.

Our allies and opponents know where this Pres-
ident stands. The vacillation of the previous ad-
ministration does not plague Reagan and Bush.
The determined policy reassures our allies and
convinces our enemies that we will not negotiate
from a position of weakness. As Ambassador
Kirkpatrick said in Dallas, “The Democrats
blame America first,’’ the President does not. As
George Bush said, ‘‘Reagan doesn’t go around
apologizing for the United States.”’

One of the many themes of this campaign is
leadership. President Reagan has proven himself
over the last four years. He is surrounded by peo-
ple who are leaders in their fields, George Shultz
and Donald Regan to name a couple.

The choice next Tuesday is clear. We can
continue on the route to recovery and strength, or
we can return to the malaise of the Carter-Mon-
dale years. George Will wrote last winter,
“America is standing tall and has a sharp crease
in its pants.”’ This sentence represents the re-
surging pride evident all across the country, and
it is the result of this administration. I suggest
that the majority of Americans and the nearly un-

animous student body of W&L are correct in sup-
porting President Ronald Reagan and Vice Presi-
dent George Bush.

registration drive in several Lex-

ters of honor in business dealings.

“IT urge you, as you leave here, to
take it with you, to follow it, because
it will be a guardian angel,” he add-
ed.

Issuing a challenge to the au-
dience, Warner pointed to Lee Chapel
and Washington Hall and asked,
“Why can’t we have a building nam-
ed after you?” He told the mostly stu-
dent crowd to balance studies with
leisure. “Enjoy life. You'll take on
heavy obligations later,’ he said.
“Don’t overlook having one heck of a
good time.”’

Moving on to campaign issues,
Warner defined arms control as ‘‘the
most important issue facing this
country in the years to come.”’

Warner said he supported Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan’s arms reduc-
tion policies. A nuclear freeze, he ad-
ded, ‘‘is an illusory subject because
of the absence of the framework with
which it can be verified.”

According to Warner, Mondale’s
method of verification could not work
and Reagan’s plan is the only one
whose goals are achievable.

Warner concluded by saying he
wanted to keep this country, espec-

ially its volunteer army, strong.

When University President John D.
Wilson approached Warner to wel-
come him after his remarks, Warner
at first did not appear to remember
Wilson’s name. Then, after Wilson in-
troduced himself, Warner responded,
“Yes, I’ve read all your mail.’’

Placing both of his arms on Wil-
son’s shoulders, Warner continued,
“You've done well. You’ve come
through some tough decisions, but
I’m proud of you.”’

Speaking briefly with reporters
before he left, Warner said he sup-
ports the decision to begin admitting
women to the University’s under-
graduate ranks.

“‘T followed it with great interest;”’
Warner said. ‘‘The decision has been
made and I support that decision.”

“‘My feeling was that it was care-
fully considered by the board (of
trustees), and if you have a difficult
decision like that...it’s important to
have a fair, open and adequate pro-
cess. That process was followed.
There was input from the broadest
spectrum of the Washington and Lee
family before the board made its
decision.”’

W&L College Republicans will be
staffing local polls on election day,
Tuesday, Nov. 6, and the organiza-
tion’s chairman foresees a victory
for both President Ronald Reagan
and Senator John W. Warner.

“We are quite confident the Presi-
dent will be re-elected, as well as
Sen. Warner,” said Patrick Hayden,
chairman of Washington and Lee’s
branch of the College Republicans.

Hayden said Warner, a 1949 grad-
uate of W&L, was ‘‘very pleased with
the turnout and enthusiasm’’ he
found during his campus visit last
Thursday.

At the Homecoming football game
Oct. 13, the Republican organization
distributed Reagan bumper stickers
and literature supporting Warner. In
Tuesday’s election, the group also is
supporting Ray Garland, who is chal-
lenging Democrat Jim Olin for the
sixth District congressional seat.

Students will be helping local of-
ficials Tuesday at the Lexington fire-
house and city hall, where ballots will
be cast.

In September, the organization as-
sisted local Republicans with a voter

ington precincts. Students also man
the Republican headquarters on
Main Street between 2 p.m. and 5
p.m. daily. Duties include handling
phone calls and distributing litera-
ture.

According to Hayden, the Young
Democrats have been ‘‘a lot more ac-
tive this year than in previous
years,” but he does not believe there
is any competition between the two
political organizations, because of
the ‘‘conservative nature”’ of the stu-
dent body.

“We really don’t have to compete
because they have so few members,”’
he said.

The College Republicans have a
membership of about 250.

College Republicans require a
membership fee of four dollars per
year. In addition, the organization
raises funds by asking parents of
members to contribute.

Hayden placed the organization’s
annual budget ‘“‘somewhere between
$1,300 and $1,400.”

In February, the Washington and
Lee and Hollins College Republicans
will be co-sponsoring the College
Republican Federation of Virginia at
the Mariott Hotel in Roanoke.

Frats violating noise laws lose certain rights

From Staff Reports

Lexington Police Chief L. 0. Sutton
Says a search warrant is not required
for police officers to enter fraternity
houses if a noise violation is occur-
ring.

“Tf officers can hear the noise, it’s
an offense occurring in their pre-
sence,”’ he said Tuesday. ‘‘We would
be remiss if we didn’t take action.”

A Lexington city ordinance prohi-
bits the use, without a written per-
mit, of sound-amplifying equipment
or loudspeakers so the sound is audi-
ble to the public

“It’s the same thing as observing a
shoplifting, or observing a fight or
hearing someone scream for help,”
Sutton continued.

He said that on at least one occa-
sion a student has attempted to bar a
police officer’s entry into a fraternity
house, claiming a search warrant
was necessary.

A student taking such an action
‘could be charged with interference
with a police officer in the perfor-
mance of his duties,’’ he said.

The police chief said a stereo could
be confiscated from a fraternity
house at which a noise violation is oc-

Blacks express support
for fired administrator

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

Calling last week’s firing of Minori-
ty Affairs Director John L. White un-
justified, black students interviewed
this week said the University will be
“hard-pressed” to find an effective
replacement.

“T though he was very effective as
an administrator,’ Bryan Johnson,
president of the Student Association
for Black Unity, said Tuesday. ‘‘It
takes somebody that’s going to be a
go-getter.”’

SABU member Wesley Payne
agreed that White’s job required him
to ‘‘stand up for what he believed in.”

‘He is not one to just sit around and
ride the cart just because someone
said so,”’ Payne said.

White said University President
John D. Wilson told him last week
that he was being fired at the end of
the school year for, among other
things, being an ineffective recruiter
of minority students.

“If he wasn’t a good recruiter, I
wouldn’t be here,’’ Payne said. He
said he doesn’t know of any black
students who don’t support White.

White would not confirm that he is
planning a lawsuit to retain his job,
saying his lawyer has hold him ‘‘not
to make comments that have a bear-
ing on a pending case.”’

White said that there has been a
drop in black enrollment from seven
last year to three this year, but that
the numbers don’t tell the whole

story.

“In my estimation last year was a
tough year,”’ he said. ‘‘No school in
the state got anywhere near their
projections’ for minority enroll-
ment.

Washington and Lee’s minority re-
cruitment strategy has been based on
a mailing campaign, which can
cause fluctuations from year to year,
White said.

“If you’re going to run an institu-
tion, you’ve got to know that because
the numbers don’t add up one year,
you don’t go out and fire someone.”

White, who graduated from W&L in
1974 and was hired for his present
position in 1979, acknowledged that
his studies as a law student have cut
into his administrative work, par-
ticularly with regard to recruiting.

“Every activity — save recruiting
— that I did before enrolling in law
school I did after,’’ White said. ‘‘But
in my heart of hearts, I can’t see
attributing last year’s numbers sole-
ly tome.”

As for improving minority recruit-
ment in the future, White said it takes
more than just a black recruiter.

“It’s a lack of overall continuity,”
he said. ‘You have to have a pro-
gram that goes to certain places and
works certain areas on a repetitive
basis.”

That happens for white students,
but not for blacks, White said.

“We've failed to establish any kind
of rapport with the black community
that would provide us with a feeder
institution,’’ he said.

A stereo from Pi Kappa Phi was

Most Washington and Lee students
still prefer to live off campus, but
would prefer to see some kind of
coeducational dormitory arrange-
ment at Washington and Lee in the
future, according to the housing
survey the University conducted dur-
ing matriculation.

Of the 923 undergraduate upper-
classmen surveyed, 631 said they
would prefer to live off campus. Of
students who now live off campus,
107 said they would prefer to live on
campus, and 16 more students said
they might prefer to live on campus,
depending upon the living arrange-
ments.

Regarding the question of whether
the dormitories should be coed or
single sex, 39 percent of the students
said dormitories should be coed with
men and women on the same floors,
37 percent said that the dorms should
be coed with men and women on dif-
ferent floors and 16 percent believed

 

said. ‘‘There seems to be a lack of
consideration by a few of the frater-
nity houses and their guests.’’

Sutton said one indication of that is
an increased amount of litter on city
streets.

He also said that three signs valued
at more than $400, including one val-
ued at $350, were stolen from the Lex-
ington Visitor Center Saturday night.

There is ‘‘no indication one way or
the other” as to whether fraternities
were involved in the action, Sutton
said. “‘I would not imply who took it
or where,”’ he added.

“If anybody’s playing souvenirs or
silly games, that’s getting pretty
serious,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s of no value to
anyone else.”’

At Monday’s Executive Committee
meeting, sophomore representative
Shayam Menon said relations be-
tween police and fraternities are
deteriorating.

“They’re having problems they

didn’t have last year,” he said.
a very volatile situation.”

Sutton said he plans to address
fraternity presidents at Tuesday’s
Interfraternity Council meeting.

In other weekend activity, the
police chief said there was an in-
stance of a fraternity having difficul-
ty getting uninvited guests to leave
the property. Police responded to the
scene after the people claimed to
have a gun in their car.

“Always call us,’’ Sutton said.
“Whenever we arrive there, we will,
with the assistance of the fraternity
president, inform the people they are
trespassing and must leave.”’

“If they come back, refuse to leave
or set foot on the property again, we
will arrest them because that’s an of-
fense occurring in our presence,” he
added.

Sutton said the police department’s
average response time is less than
three minutes.

“It’s

“There may be sporadic instances
where officers are tied up and the re
sponse time may vary,” he said. ‘ ‘al
calls are prioritized if we are busy.”’

Also this weekend, Lexington re}
sident Johnson O’Neal Fitch was|
charged with two counts of assault-|
ing a police officer following an inci-|
dent that began at the Washington}
and Lee parking lot near Red Square. |

According to the police report, of-
ficer Edward A. Funkhouser was on|
foot patrol at 12:30 a.m. Sunday when |
he saw a man crouching beside a car |
in the lot. The report said the subject
ran from the scene and was appre-
hended on Main Street outside the |
Grand Piano and Furniture Co.

The police report said that Funk- |
houser “received an injury in the |
groin as a result of Fitch kicking |
him,” and that officer David C. :
Grimes “received an abrasion on his :
left leg as a result of Fitch — |
him.”

favor coeducational dorms

that all dormitories should be single
sex.

A third question dealing with the
type of on-campus housing preferred
by students provoked no answer from
45 percent of the respondents. Thirty-
four percent of those who expressed a
preference for some type of housing
favored apartments with kitchens,
seven percent favored apartments,
six percent favored suites and five
percent favored traditional single oc-
cupancy rooms.

The survey also showed that 28 per-
cent of the upperclass under-
graduates now live in fraternity
houses and another 28 percent live in
rented houses. An additional 24 per-
cent of the upperclassmen live in
apartments and the remaining 16
percent live in university housing.

Seventy-one percent of the students
pay $100 or less a month in rent, 24
percent pay between $100 and $150 a
month and the remaining five per-
cent pay more than $150 a month.

Frank A. Parsons, assistant to the
University president, said that this

Residential Accomodations
subcommittee of the coeducation
committee would consider the num-
ber of students dissatisfied with their
off-campus housing in drawing up
plans for the new dormitory due in
September 1987.

“It’s very difficult to estimate how
many of that 107 (students living off
campus who would prefer to live on)
would actually live on campus if they
had the opportunity. All you can do is
take this into account. There’s no
magic formula as to how many beds
you'll need,” Parsons said.

“Factoring all those things togeth-
er, you get something in the neigh-
borhood of 240 beds,’’ said Parsons.

He said the figure of a 240-bed dor-
mitory was a preliminary estimate
that could still vary.

Parsons said he was not surprised
by the high percentage of students
who said they would like to remain
living off campus.

“Students do like the flexibility
that they presently have. Freshmen
quickly see a very interesting, ex-

citing four years ahead of them. Part
of that excitement is that they do
have a variety of ways to live,” Par-
sons remarked.

Executive Committee President
Cole Dawson said he favored dormi- -
tories arranged like those at thé~
University of Virginia, where the-
dormitories are coed with men and °
women on alternating floors.

“It’s the best way to integrate the ’
girls with the guys,’’ said Dawson.
“If you set them off in separate
dorms, you’ve segregated them. It*
works real well socially at U.Va.” -
Dawson added.

While believing that the option of
living off campus should remain open
to all upperclassmen, Dawson said -
he could see benefits in developing a ‘
more residential college by providing ‘
those students who want on-campus °
housing with that option.

“The more that a college is resi- ‘
dential, the more people participate. '
When you've got people spread out
over the countryside, it’s hard to par-
ticipate.’”’

“No, Cole. That’s: ‘Is my speech

“You know what I mean. I’m going

“Cole, do you know who I am?”’

“Sure, I know who you are. . . .And
that’s Shayam Menon, Alcohol

Even though as the evening pro-
gressed he took to calling it ‘‘Alcohol

President Cole Dawson had identi-
fied the chairman of an effort to im-
press upon students the dangers of
drinking and driving.

He also had just registered .20 on
the Lexington Police Department’s
Alco-Sensor.

A reading of .10 represents legal in-
toxication in the state of Virginia.

“‘He’s probably legally dead,” ad-
ministration Professor Roger A.

. Leary to talk
here Thursday

- Dr. Timothy Leary, who rose to

prominence in the 1960s because of
’ his controversial drug experiments
» at Harvard, will speak at Washington
and Lee next Thursday, Nov. 8.

His lecture, ‘‘Flashbacks with Tim-
othy Leary,’ will be at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel.

Leary was once branded ‘‘the most
dangerous man alive’ as he rose to
national prominence in the 1960s.
When he ran for governor of Califor-
nia, the Beatles dedicated a song to
him: ‘‘Come Together.”

After receiving his Ph.D. in clinical
psychology from the University of
California at Berkeley, Leary be-
came director of psychology re-
search at the Kaiser Foundation in
Oakland, Calif. During that time, he
became a founder and leader of the
“humanistic”? psychology move-
ment, revolutionizing traditional ap-
proaches to psychotherapy.

“Tt made me more aware of the ef-
fect of social drinking on your be-
havior,’ Dawson said the next day.
“I’ve never known before how many
drinks it took for you to get to .10.””

‘“‘Now I do, and that’s interesting,”
said Dawson, who consented to press
coverage of his participation in the
Alcohol Awareness event.

“It sounds sort of farcical or
hypocritical for W&L students to be a
part of Alcohol Awareness by getting
intoxicated and then blowing into the
breath tester,” said sophomore EC
representative Andrew Caruthers,
who blew a .10 after eight beers.

“This wasn’t so much to promote
awareness of alcohol but to promote
awareness of what your limits are,”

he said.
Menon, the other sophomore EC re-

presentative, said the eight students
and four professors and staff who
participated will help people realize
that strictly social drinking can still
result in a dangerous blood alcohol
level.

“T didn’t want them to get smash-
ed,”’ he said. ‘‘I wanted them to drink
like it was a normal cocktail party.
After they started talking, they for-
got that it was a test.”

“This was just how a regular party
is,” he continued. ‘“‘No guys drink
three or four beers and then stop.
They’re going to go to the max when
they get blitzed on a Saturday night.
The idea was to show the effect that
had on this group of people.”

Tomorrow from 6 to 7 p.m., the
Alco-Sensor will be in the Cockpit for
a special Alcohol Awareness event,
and Tuesday from 8 to 9:30 p.m. in
the Student Center Conference
Room, representatives of the state
police will discuss drunken driving
arrest procedures and perform a
simulated arrest.

SWEET BRIAR—Congresswoman
and self-proclaimed feminist Bella
Abzug told a crowd of 450 at Sweet
Briar College Monday night that
“‘women’s rights is now at an historic
point in its history with Geraldine
Ferraro in the number two position
on the Democratic ticket.”

As the keynote speaker in the first
“Women in Politics’ workshop at
Sweet Briar, Abzug also predicted
that the ‘‘gender gap’’ first identified
in exit polls from the 1980 election
“will be more intense this year” and
that nine million more women than
men will vote in the elections next
Tuesday. She said that the big issues
facing women voters this fall are eco-
nomic justice, war and peace, and
social equality under the law.

While speaking of the advantages
of electing the Mondale-Ferraro tic-
ket, Abzug reserved her harshest
words for the Reagan administra-
tion’s record of insensitivity to
women’s issues.

“The women’s movement has fac-
ed a setback in that Reagan is anti-
woman,”’ Abzug said, ‘‘but I hesitate
to use the term ‘setback’ since there
are really no setbacks, only battles in
the long run of events. The problem is
that power is still in the male power
structure with its vested military and
religious interests.”

“Men think that Reagan is more

With this week designated as
Alcohol Awareness Week, the whole
question of drinking and driving has
once again come up. What started out
as a great party could very easily end
up costing you a great deal of money
as well as your life.

According to Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton, the police go
through a set process in dealing with
drunk drivers. The first step obvious-
ly is the initial observation of the car.
The police look for excessive speeds,
either too slow or too fast, and weav-

ing.

The next step is to stop the car in an
area that is safe. After the car has
been stopped, the police officer will
ask the driver for his title, registra-
tion and driver’s license. During this .
time the officer will be watching the
driver for signs of excessive alcohol
in the system: slurred speech, smell
of beer or bloodshot eyes.

The officer will ask the driver to

macho than Mondale. Phooey. His is
a false machoism,”’ she continued.
“It takes strength to negotiate with
someone with whom you disagree. It
takes strength to walk not always
with your shoulders out but with a
caring heart and a conscience. I
think that ultimately women are a lot
stronger.”’

Abzug hailed Mondale’s choice of
Ferraro as his running mate but de-
cried the ‘‘double standard the press
has held her up to.”

“Everything since Noah’s Ark has
been done in pairs except govern-
ment. Why? Women are no longer
special interests. We’re 54 percent of
the vote.”’ she said

“But Ronaia Reagan still treats
women as special interests. True, he
has appointed a woman to the Su-
preme Court. True, he has several
women Cabinet members. But he is
the first in the most recent seven
presidencies to oppose the ERA. He
is a leading opponent of the Supreme
Court’s affirmation of a woman’s
right to reproductive freedom. His
budget cuts have fallen largely on
women and children.”’

The crowd chuckled several times
as Abzug told her personal history.
Noting that her trademark has been
her bizarre hats, Abzug said she
began wearing a hat after she was
mistaken by clients as a secretary
for a legal firm in which she was a
partner. ‘I was told that professional
women wore hats and gloves and

The Ring-tum Phi, November I, 1984, Page 7

were then recognized as professional
women. So I began to wear hats and
gloves. And I began to like hats.
When I went to Washington, I got the
idea that they wanted me to take it
off, so I decided to keep it on,’’ she
said.

Speaking of her education, Abzug
said that she “had the idea some-
where that if I became a lawyer I
could correct everything. So after I
graduated from Hunter College, I
wrote to Harvard and they wrote
back that they didn’t accept women.
I was outraged and I have a fine
sense of outrage. Since there was no
women’s movement, I turned to my
mother. She said, ‘Go to Columbia.
It’s closer.’ So I went there.

“I got a scholarship and I took the
subway to Queens from the Bronx.
The subway cost five cents. That’s
how I became an advocate of low-
cost public transportation.”’

Abzug sees hope for the future of
the women’s movement. “‘It began
130 years ago with the woman’s suff-
rage movement,” she said. ‘‘It took
us 75 years to get the vote. Since 1920,
women have argued that they could
bring a new social conscience to
America. But we did not understand
the need for an electoral base and so
we never developed one.”’

Abzug said that in the 1960s,
though, the Vietnam war activiated
women anew. ‘‘We believed that
there was something worth living for,

not something worth dying for. What
is the nature of a government that
could get us into such a war? So we
saw the beginning of a new women’s
movement. And this movement led to
the formation of the electoral gender

gap.”

Though the subject of her talk was
the ‘‘gender gap,’ Abzug only touch-
ed on it throughout her 70-minute
speech. Defining the gender gap as a
“difference in political attitudes and
behavior of men and women,”’ Abzug
stressed the importance of the e-
merging economic role women play
in the job market. ‘‘The gender gap is
a battle over the changes in our
lifestyle, over the need for change in
public policy and legislation.”

The former congresswoman from
Manhattan stated that women who
support Reagan are under ‘‘a form of
delusion and escapism that makes
people feel good.”’ She pinned the
recovery in the economy not to Ron-
ald Reagan but to the ‘‘oil glut’ now
on the market. She decried Reagan’s
opposition to the nuclear freeze when
a majority of Americans of both
sexes favor one.

“You know, they christened a new
aircraft carrier this past weekend.
The Teddy Roosevelt. He was known
for carrying a big stick. Well, today,
women no longer are carrying their
lipstick. We are carrying the big
stick of votes,’ the feisty former
legislator noted.

perform some of the various tests
that we all hear so much about:
touching one’s nose, reciting the
alphabet, picking up coins and the
like. After watching the suspect’s ac-
tions, the police then determine
whether the driver is drunk. If the of-
ficer determines from the various
tests that the person is drunk, he will
then ask him to submit to a prelimi-
nary breath test.

Sutton said the individual is not re-
quired to take this preliminary test,
and his refusal cannot be used
against him in court. If the person
refuses to take this preliminary test,
the police officer will then arrest the
individual for drunken driving and
read him the rules regarding drunk
driving in Virginia.

The suspect is then read the
“complied consent law,” which in-
forms the arrested individual that he

refuses to take either test, the police
will then also charge him with refus-
ing to take a test — which may lead to
having his license revoked.

After taking either the blood or
breath test and found to be above the
legal limit (.1), the driver is taken
before a magistrate who will either
set bail or release the individual to
someone who comes to get him.

If the person cannot make bail, he
is kept in jail until the sheriff deter-
mines he is sufficiently sober to
drive. A trial date also is set for the
individual.

According to General District
Court Judge Joseph E. Hess, if you
are found guilty, the fine is $200 plus
$20 court costs (if you took a blood
test, the court costs are $45).

VASAP was, until this year, a two-
hour, once-a-week, program for 12
weeks. The first four weeks were
devoted to defensive driving and the
remaining eight to alcohol and its ef-
fects.

At present, VASAP has been cut to
eight weeks devoted strictly to
alcohol awareness. According to
some Washington and Lee students
currently enrolled in the program,
each session usually begins with a
movie dealing with drinking, alcohol,
drug abuse or a similar subject.

According to Sutton, there have
been approximately 200 DUI arrests
so far this year. Hess added that be-
tween 25 and 30 percent of those ar-
rests involved students. Of those, the
majority involved women from the
various colleges.

TIME — the fact that the same team benefitted
OUT from these mistakes is interesting as well
**** — some discussion is warranted. The

: topic? Well, seeing as the Longhorns were

By Mike on the receiving end of two bad (Read:
Stachura missed) calls in a couple of football games
that mattered and in a couple of situations

that for all intents and purposes decided the games’ respective outcomes,
the question of what to do with blatantly incorrect decisions by the gents who
have the whistles must come up for review.

The problem? More often than not, the television replay is more accurate
than our all-too-fallible friends in black and white. The solution? Wouldn't
touch it with a 10-foot pole.

However, now that I’m a safe distance from the dreaded solution, I'll offer
these words as a compromise. We all realize that the television replay could
be a helpful tool. At the same time, there is the old argument that when you
introduce the replay, you invite a penalty to be called on every play.

My solution calls for the use of our technology without the benefit (or, bet-
ter said, detraction) of the instant replay. What needs to be done is improve
the likelihood that the correct call will be made on every play, while at the
same time maintain the continuity of play.

Now, that I’ve lost everyone's attention span, here’s how it is to be done:
Have a seventh offical watching the action on television monitor and making
calls from what he sees on the screen. There is one important stipulation:
Our TV referee must call them as he sees them without the use of the dread-
ed — and telling — instant replay. The point is the camera’s eye view may be
a little bit better than our fieldbound arbiters. At the same time, however,
the extra whistleblower is forced to make the same split-second decisions as
his six comrades. This way, we'll be able to avoid mistakes on those crucial
calls that, in the past, have given a team a victory or tie it really didn’t
deserve... (The Texas Longhorns are 5-2, not 5-0-1...)...

....Back down on the Colonnade, those harriers just aren’t going to quit,
giving Coach Dick Miller his first undefeated season in over 30 years at
W&L. Best of luck to the Generals as they go for another ODAC title, as well
as a team berth at the Eastern Championshps in Sewanee the following
weekend... The gridders came away with win No. 2 in a row, and the defense
was Clearly the reason for the overwhelming win. This weekend may be
rated ‘R’ due to cruel and inhuman punishment to our friends from down Bir-
mingham way. At least, let us hope so...And one final word of W&L en-
couragement: The water polo Generals go to Richmond this weekend seek-
ing Southern League title No. 4. For a change they’re underdogs, but here’s a
thought that three times will be a charm against the capital city school....

....Now, on to the real world of athletics. And this is serious. The New York
City Marathon was tragic, but, and this is the point, not avoidable. It is an
impossibility to reschedule this race. The weather conditions, be they rain,
snow, wind and/or heat, are as important a part of the race as the 26 miles.
Ask Marty Liquori. He knows. The point is everybody and his brother and
sister thinks they can run a marathon, or at least think they are capable of
running a marathon. Marty said they’ve got to respect their foe (the
marathon) more and that the death last Sunday should serve as a grim
reminder of how different an animal the marathon really is. Let’s get
healthy, fine, but it’s become more like let’s go crazy and that’s not fine...

...Hey, guess what? The NBA is exciting, I hear. Opening week attendance
is up and with good reason. Michael Jordan is the best thing to hit the pro
game since...well since the game began. Jordan can turn this perennial four
months of burden into something worth more than the last 15 seconds of the
fourth overtime...(Here’s a contest: Erving and Jordan one-on-one)...

...Finally, for those of you who wanted Gerry Faust out of Notre Dame,
here’s gentle reminder: If there were more men like Faust in the college
game, no one would ever hear from (NCAA Executive Director) Walter
Byers....

The Washington and Lee cross
country team finished its regular
season last Saturday, and, to
nobody’s surprise, the ‘Victory Tour’
stands at 14-0.

Last Saturday, the Generals
defeated Lynchburg, Hampden-
Sydney, Eastern Mennonite,
Newport News Apprentice and

Randolph-Macon on Hampden-
Sydney’s five-mile course. With the
end-of-the-season victory, coach
Miller was handed his first
undefeated team in his 32 years at
Washington and Lee.

For the second week in a row,

Newport News Apprentice’s Martin
Nixon finished first in 26:08 and 13
seconds later came Washington and
Lee’s front runner, Frank Pittman
(27:21). Fourth place was taken by
Eastern Mennonite’s Steve Kayal
(27:23). Then came the Generals’
Ted Myers (27:38) and Eddie Goun-
dry (28:41). The other Washington
and Lee top finishers were Ron
Moody (28:12) in 13th place and
David Andrews (28:19) in 14th place.

“Qur times were slower than ex-
pected, because the heat was a major
factor,’’ Miller said. ‘‘But the heat af-
fected everyone, so it didn’t hurt us. I
was very pleased with our overall
performance as our spread was the
smallest of the season.”

“Our depth has increased through-
out the season,”’ David Andrews said.
“Freshman Bill Clark is coming up
and running well and Moody had a
great race.”

Next week, the Generals will travel
to Lynchburg College for the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Cham-
pionships. At 14-0, the Generals are in
a good position to win the champion-
ship; the team is confident about how
it will do in the post season.

“Lynchburg’s course is a campus
course,”’ said Pittman. “‘It has hills
that aren’t that bad, stairs, rocks and
woods.”

“We're right where we want to
be,’’ Myers said. ‘‘We should peak in
two weeks at Regionals.”’

First woman coach called ‘perfect’

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

“She is the perfect assistant. I
could not be happier,’ said head
water polo and swimming coach
Page Remillard about his graduate
assistant Laura Cox.

Although she is only an assistant,
Cox is the first female coach in the
history of the Washington and Lee
athletic department, according to
Athletic Director William McHenry.

Cox, a native of Davis, Calif.,
possesses a long and _ successful
swimming history. She began
competitive swimming when she was
eight and began playing water polo at
12. She attended the University of
California at Santa Barbara for her
freshman year and qualified for the
NCAA Division I National Champion-
ships. After her freshman year, she
transferred to Old Dominion Univer-
sity but was unable to compete dur-
ing her sophomore year because of
the NCAA rules and regulations con-
cerning transfer athletes. She did
swim for Old Dominion during her
junior and senior years, qualifying
for the Division I National Champion-

Cox was the only female on her
high school water polo team, where
she got her first serious water polo
experience. Since beginning her
water polo career in high school, Cox
remains a member of the U. S. Na-
tional water polo team, an honor
she’s held since 1977. She has earned
All-American honors eleven times
and has won the MVP award twice at
the national championships.

With her successful background in
acquatics, Cox has many respon-
sibilities within the W&L acquatics
program. She assists Coach Remill-
ard with writing workouts, estab-
lishing team objectives and goals,
coaching on deck, traveling with the
team and recruiting.

Describing Cox’s role in recruiting
prospective swimmers, Coach Rem-
illard said, ‘“‘She coordinates the re-
cruiting program to see that it is
well-ordered and _ well-timed.”’
Remillard added that she is doing a
“super job.”

He said, “Our recruiting is well
past the point that it usually is at this
time in the year and that is probably
completely due to her organization.”’

Cox is also involved in a local ac-
quatics program outside of the W&L
program. Although Remillard is the
director of the Rockbridge Acquatics
Team, Cox is the head coach. She is
solely responsible for writing the
workouts and scheduling the team’s

The graduate assistant position
provides one with the opportunity to

The Washington and Lee football
team evened its record at 4-4 after a
31-0 victory over Bridgewater Satur-
day in Bridgewater.

The Generals capitalized on three
big plays enroute to their secondcon- .
secutive win. W&L struggled offen-
sively throughout the first half until
sophomore John Roe blocked an Eag-
le punt late in the second quarter,
giving the Generals the ball in
Bridgewater territory. Senior tail-

Soccer downed twice,
now out of ODAC race

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Varsity
Soccer team was defeated twice over
the week, losing 7-0 to UNC-Greens-
boro and 1 in overtime to Roanoke.
The Roanoke loss knocks the Gene-
rals out of contention for an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference title
this year.

Coach Piranian said that the Roa-
noke game was an “evenly played
match.”’ Piranian stated that a poor
officiating call was at least partly
responsible for the loss. ‘‘The lines-

men raised his flag for offsides, the
referee didn’t call it, and Roanoke
scored.’’ But Piranian also said that
“‘we were at fault for letting it go into
overtime.”’

Piranian named goalie Jay Werner
as the outstanding player of the
game. Werner made 14 saves in the
second half of play.

Discusssing the reasons for the
UNC-Greensboro defeat, Coach Pira-
nian said, ‘‘We had to have a very
strong performance, and that wasn’t
the case, the team had too much re-
spect for our opponents.”’ Piranian
also said the team’s effort was hurt
by the absence of key players. ‘“‘We
didn’t have a strong game against
them — ever since Mark Sullivan’s
been injured, leadership's been lack-
ing on the field.”

In addition to Sullivan, Piranian
said that the absence of Chip Landis
and Tom Myers also damaged the
team’s effort. Piranian cited sopho-
more Tommy Pee as the outstanding
player of the game.

The defeats drop the team’s record
to 5-7 ahd their ODAC record to 3-2.
Piranian said ‘‘at best we can have a
.500 season.”’

Piranian is proud of the way the
team has come back from previous.
defeats. This Saturday the team .
plays Radford, and the last game of.
the season will be against VMI on ~
Nov. 6, and Coach Piranian said; .
“The. team that’s more fired up will
win the game.” es

He added that in response to the co-
education decision, some alumni
“thave told us that they’re not going
to give this year, but that they cer-
tainly don’t want to be divorced from
the University in future years.”

“There are some people who want
to make a gesture of that sort,’’ Wil-
son said. ‘‘I think most people now
are saying, ‘Let’s put this behind us.’
Anything else would be very fruitless
at this point.”’

Dawson said the trustees indicated
to him that some alumni who initially
opposed the decision become suppor-
tive of it when the reasoning is ex-
plained to them.

“While they may not agree with the
decision, they’re ready to get behind
itand make the most of it,”’ he said.

At Saturday’s meeting, Assistant
Dean of the College Pamela H. Simp-
son, chairman of the Committee on
Coeducation, reported her group’s
progress in its first few weeks of

 

operation.

She outlined the function of the six
subcommittees, including one on
fraternities chaired by junior Lee
Hollis

‘“There’s a need for communica-
tion so the fraternities aren’t seeing
coeducation itself as something
that’s threatening to them,’’ she said
yesterday. ‘‘We want there to be dia-
logue, so we can help them and they
can help us.”’

She said the subcommittees are at-
tempting to involve a large number
of members of the University
community ‘‘so that more people will
havea stake in making this work.”

Author Tom Wolfe of New York

Wilson said that although he has

New albums for ' open- -eared listeners

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

Some recording artists are so ‘“‘un
marketable’ as to never bridge the
gap between cult status and wide-
spread popular acceptance XTC and
Tom Verlain have been putting out
albums for about six years, and so
far, neither has had “hits.’’ New
albums from both maintain high ar-
tistic standards; not too surprisingly,
neither of their efforts is likely to
break American A.O.R. playlists

XTC’s “The Big Express’’ has a
harder edge than their previous ef-
fort, ‘‘Mummer.”’ Their sound incor
porates dissonance, musically and
lyrically. ‘Wake Up,”’ the first song,
jars and soothes at the same time. A
typical XTC song emphasizes the off
beat, with the chorus cramming

words in to t m the
musical feel often reflects and em

phasizes the lyric

 

The sonically suppressed singing
on the anti-tyrannica Reign of
Blows” serves to further emphasize
that song’s impact. Their subject
material is often grim, concerned
with the drudgery and hypocrisy of
everday life. ‘‘The Ever Story of

is exceptionally good, and the mix of
organic and electronic
smoothly superb. This band knows
what it is doing, and why: questions

sounds are

vant as the joy of recording takes
precedence

Tom Verlaine’s ‘‘Cover’’ is a more
personal view of life. Noted as the
guitarist and driving force behind the
short-lived ‘‘Television,’’Verlaine has
put out four albums since that band’s
breakup. He is a phenomenal electric
guitarist, and the tones and textures
he squeezes from his instrument
make his albums primers on modern
guitar

“Cover’’ uses what sound like
guitar synthesizers to create a tex-
tural wash behind the idiosyncratic,
quirky funk base. His guitar sets up
the melody, and then he counters it
like a dangerous undercurrent.
“Swim,” a beautiful song of confess-
ed love, has a constant, ominous bass
line providing a counterpoint to the
surface calm.

Tension is always present in a Ver
laine song, both in the lyrics and in
his voice, “‘A fragile whine’’ might
best describe his singing, yet he can
use its limits well; listen to the funny
draw] he affects in ‘‘Lindi-Lu.” This
man’s nightmares coincide with his
dreams, and often “simple’’ love
songs sound like exercises in per
sonal exorcism. ‘‘Cover’’ is for liste

room, just before bedtime. ‘‘The Big

‘Body Double’: more than just porn

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

Brian dePalma’s latest film ‘‘Body
Double’”’ is a film worth seeing. There
are, as in all of dePalma’s movies,
scenes that might be considered
overly violent or sexually explicit,
but I felt in this movie, dealing with
the world of pornography, passion
and murder, these scenes worked
well. Certainly the violence of ‘‘Body
Double’’ doesn’t even come close to
that of dePalma’s last picture ‘‘Scar-
face.’’ What really makes this movie,
though, is something far removed
from the sex and violence: the con-
stant use of plot twists designed to
keep the audience off-guard.

As in all dePalma films, the direc-
tor attempts to mimic his idol, Alfred
Hitchcock, by moving his cam-
era in unorthodox ways. He has not
quite filled the shoes of the master in
this regard (who could?), but
dePalma still provides a visually
stunning movie, loaded with color,

motion and subliminal messages

The story line appears simple: a
voyueristic, out-of-work actor wit
nesses a murder, and then stumbles
onto the solution to the killing. What
happens along the way is a mix of
turns-of-events and occasional lapses
into the subconscious, which lead us
down dead end after dead end until
the mystery falls together at the con-
clusion of the movie

The few scenes I felt could have
been cut down involved the hero’s
one and only meeting with the victim
of the piece, the murder scene itself
(the woman is skewered with a pow-
er drill) and a scene in which the hero
is taking an acting course. These all
seemed almost agonizingly long and
somewhat out of place in a picture
with such a sense of urgency about it.
Still, their lengths were designed to

create effects, the first, a de:
never end, and the final tw to
create tension.

Taken as a whole ‘‘Body Double’ is
a fine film. There are those, I’m
sure who will argue this point to the
end, but I recommend this movie
strongly, and I encourage ali th
who have seen it and still doubt
see it again. You may just change
your mind.

Music Professor Robert Stewart al-
so agrees the faculty is more liberal
than its national counterparts, albeit
a narrow distinction.

“IT think most of the faculty here
are probably liberal, but not by a
great percentage — say, 55 percent
liberal,’ Stewart elaborated: ‘‘I
think faculty on a national basis are
more conservative than we are
here.”

“I think the conservative/liberal
percentage among the students is too
one-sided—too conservative,’’ he
said.

Grenada: one’vyear later

Professors, medical student analyze military action, political decisions

 

By BRUCE POTTER

 

Chief Editor

Saying he was here “not to
publicize or politicize, but to share a
revelation,’ an American medical

student on Grenada during last fall’s
U.S. invasion of the island told W&L
students last Thursday that ‘‘hopeful-
ly, we all as Americans can learn
something from this.”’

Michael Kimmel, 25, of Wyndmoor,
Pa., was one of 90 Grenadian stu-
dents visiting college campuses
across the country to mark the first
anniversary of the U.S. invasion of
Grenada

During his 20-minute Commerce
School presentation to about 150
students, Kimmel played a tape re-
corded from Radio Free Grenada the
day former Prime Minister Maurice
Bishop was assassinated. The broad-
cast outlined a four-day, 24-hour
curfew, during which no one could
leave his home. ‘‘Anyone violating
this curfew,’’ it said, ‘‘will be shot on
sight.”

Kimmel’s talk was followed by a
lively debate between politics Profes-
sor John Handelman and journalism
Professor Clark R. Mollenhoff. Mol-
lenhoff argued that the invasion was
justifiable, while Handelman argued
that it was not

Calling the invasion “both a legal
and proper action,’’ Mollenhoff said
it was necessary for the United
States to show it would protect its
citizens abroad.

“That’s a right we all have — to
take the flag of the United States with
us wherever we want to go,’’ he add-
ed. ‘“‘It isn’t generally recognized any
more, and I think it should be rees-
tablished.’’

Noting that, since the invasion,
stories have emerged citing heavier
U.S. casualties than earlier reported,
Mollenhoff said, ‘‘It would have been
unusual if they did not have some
foul-ups.

“I’m not soft on the Pentagon...but
I didn’t see any indication they were
lying on any part of this matter.”

After Mollenhoff’s opening re-
marks, most of which were prepared,
Handelman said, ‘‘I don’t know how
to begin, exactly.”’

He cited, though, the U.S. bombing
of a mental hospital on Grenada and
subsequent failure to rebuild that
hospital. Handelman asked the au-
dience to imagine what the patients
must have been doing as they saw
U:S. planes attacking the hospital.

“They look at each other and they
say, ‘You were right. They are after
us. They’re coming to get us,’ ” he
said.

Handelman dismissed the argu-

ment that the Grenadians posed a
threat to the United States by saying
they were not likely to ‘‘storm ashore
at Boca Raton...and move on to
Lexington.”’

One of the major concerns of the
U.S. in invading the island. Hand-
elman noted, was extension of a run-
way there to 10,000 feet.

“Are we the architects of the
world?”’ Handelman asked. ‘‘Are we
to go out there and say ‘9,000 feet,
okay; 10,000 feet, no go?’ ”’

After their opening statements, the
two professors answered questions
submitted by the audience.

Asked one question, Handelman
said, “I don’t know whether that
makes sense, first of all.”’

“That’s a real problem,’’ Mollen-
hoff retorted.

After Mollenhoff said, ‘‘We were
simply giving democracy an oppor-
tunity to work, and I would defend
that opportunity under any circum-
stances,” Handelman responded,
‘We can’t make the world safe for
democracy. I mean, that’s sort of a
Christmas-eve wish, isn’t it?...

“You can’t make the whole world
safe for democracy. Give them a fair
shot at it, sure.”’

Asked what he thought of Kim-
mel’s recounting of the events sur-
rounding the invasion, Handelman

said, ‘All I can say is ‘I didn’t want to
say this, but there you go again.’ "’

Speaking to reporters before his
presentation, Kimmel said that when
the invasion began at 5:24 a.m., ‘“‘We
weren’t sure just who it was that was
coming into Grenada.’’ Several hours
later, though, they recognized an
American aircraft, said Kimmel,
adding, ‘‘We all felt quite proud to be
Americans at that point.”

Asked if he ever felt as though he
were in danger, Kimmel said, ‘““We
were basically stranded there in a
situation that could explode.”

Kimmel also emphasized that he
was not at W&L ‘‘to promote Ronald
Reagan’s re-election,” even though
the event occurred less than two
weeks before the Nov. 6 election.

His visit, and those of the other
Grenadian students, was sponsored
by the USA Foundation, based in
Washington, D.C., and described as a
non-profit, non-partisan organization
interested ‘‘in improving the quality
and quantity of the level of public
policy debate on college campuses,”
according to Paul Erickson, publish-
er of the foundation’s new magazine,
The New American.

The organization was founded in
July 1983 by Jack Abramoff, chair-
man of the national College Republi-
cans, Erickson said.

 

Calendar

or the administrative staff. I imagine
the burden will fall on the admin-
istrative side.”’

Elrod said that for a new vote of the
calendar to be taken at Monday’s fac-
ulty meeting, such a motion by some-
one who had voted for the calendar at
the October meeting would be re-
quired.

“Essentially what the new calen-

some parents will be making reser-
vations for Parents’ Weekend next
year while they are here this week-
end.

On the bright side, McNeese
pointed out, cooperation with the
faculty, the administration and the
Buildings and Grounds staff has
simplified the organization of the
weekend.

“A great many people have com-
mented on how good a job Washing-
ton and Lee does on Parents’
Weekend,”’ he said.

dar does is put us in a situation where
we work hard for six weeks to play a
couple of games, and then we have to
take a break for six weeks,’’ said
head basketball coach Verne Can-
field

Because of University rules, which
state that no away athletic events
may be scheduled the week prior to
exams and no athletic practices or
games of any kind may be held dur-
ing the three days immediately be-
fore exams begin, under the approv-
ed calendar both the basketball and
the wrestling schedules would have
to be changed.

Head wresting coach Gary Franke
also indicated that the tournament,
something he said he worked to es-
tablish as an important part of his
team’s schedule, may be difficult to
reschedule in following years.

The schedules had been made, Mc-
Henry said, based on a proposed cal-
endar which had Sept. 16 as the first
day of fall term classes and had two
weeks between the Thanksigving
break and the start of exams. Univer-
sity Registrar and chairman of the
calendar committee Harold S. Head

said the calendar the athletic depart-
ment worked from is “‘only a guide.”
Assistant Dean of the College Pam-
ela H. Simpson, who spoke in favor of
the approved schedule at the October
facutly meeting, said the schedule
the athletic department was using
“pushed us too close to Christmas.”’

Simpson explained that the Univer-
sity usually remains closed during
the week between Christmas and
New Year’s Day as a holiday for ad-
ministrative personnel. Under the
former calendar, the exam period
would not end until Dec. 20.

Simpson also said the committee
favored the change because by mov-
ing the start of school back a week,
which would then shift the first day
for freshmen orientation to Labor
Day, parents who were bringing their
children to schoo! would not be forced
to take a day off from work.

The calendar committee agreed on
the recommended change and sent it
to the faculty Executive Committee,
which in turn recommended the
change to the faculty at the October
meeting. It received approval in a
“very harmonious” vote, according
to Elrod.

Immediately after the faculty ap-
proval of the altered calendar, Mc-
Henry said, the athletic department
began work to get a reconsideration
of the vote. Less than a week after
the vote, the athletic department
presented its concerns to the Univer-
sity Athletic Committee.

Professor Samuel J. Kozak, who
chairs the committee, said he is op-
posed to the approved calendar on
“two levels.”’

“On one level, I feel (the calendar
as it now stands) is a disservice to the
athletic program, and on another lev-
el, from a pedagogic perspective, I
think having one week between
Thanksgiving break and exams is not
a particularly effective way to
teach,’’ Kozak said.

Canfield agreed with Kozak’s as-
sessment. “I think the young men
must be our first concern. If we are
forced to change our schedules, we
are putting undue pressure on the
young men. It’s hard enough to play
three games a week. We're proud of

our 3.1 team GPA and we don’t want,

to endanger it,” he said. The change
would occasionally force the team to °
play four games a week.

Won’t give up 6th, GOP says

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

Although the Democratic incum-
bent handily retained Virginia’s 6th
Congressional District in Tuesday’s
election, Republican leaders and
others said yesterday the party will
continue its drive to recapture the
longtime GOP stronghold.

Retired business executive James
R. Olin, who in 1982 became the first
Democrat since the days of President
Harry Truman to hold the seat, de-
feated Republican Ray L. Gar-
land 53 percent to 47 percent dis-
trictwide and 63 percent to 37 per-
cent in Lexington.

A number of sources yesterday
said Garland was a weak candidate
who mounted an ineffective cam-
paign against a popular, politically
astute incumbent.

Inan interview, Garland attributed
his defeat to incumbent advantage, a

hostile press and the fact that he has
‘been around too long.”

The sources said Republicans will
likely have a better chance of recap-
turing the seat in the next presiden-
tial election year than they will in
1986.

“That is a Republican seat, and
we're going to keep targeting it until
we get it back,” said Edward Goes,
director of the National Republican
Congressional Committee’s cam-
paign division. ‘We're going after it
in ’86 and ’88 and '90 and we'll keep at
it until we win.”

Olin broke the 28-year GOP lock on
the Shenandoah Valley district dur-
ing the 1982 midterm elections in
which Republicans lost 26 House of
Representatives seats. The national
party had hoped the Virginia slot
could be regained this week.

“Tt was one of our many targets,”
Goes said. “We did full funding

district— look at the margins of Pres-
ident Reagan and Senator Warner.”’

Ronald Reagan garnered 67 per-
cent of the 6th District vote, and John
Warner received 74 percent of the
vote.

“There were likely to be coattails
there,” he said of the Garland race.
“But they had some problems. They
got a late start, they had a change of
managers that threw the campaign
off stride and the campaign got
rather negative.”’

University of Virginia political
science professor Larry Sabato, a

well-known expert on state: politics,

said that despite Garland’s loss, he
was helped by Reagan’s popularity.

“I think he would have lost by a
much larger margin without the
coattails,’ he said. ‘‘Tracking polls
suggest the race was not as close as it
turned out to be.”’

Washington and Lee students who attended their
political parties’ victory celebrations Tuesday night de-
scribed contrasting events that demonstrate very clear-
ly the political leanings of the W&L student body.

The College Republicans, a campus organization with
about 250 members, paid for transportation and rooms
for 10 members to attend the Virginia Republican cele-

bration in Richmond.

“It was just a big party,’’ said senior Scott Tilley, the
executive director of the state College Republicans. He
said about 3,000 people attended the celebration, at the
Richmond Marriott,which included tables of food and

four open bars.

In sharp contrast, some of the members of the Young
Democrats, a campus organization with about 25 mem-
bers walked to the local Democratic Headquarters on

Washington Street Tuesday night.

“By the time people had gotten there,” club Vice
President Everett Hamilton said of the celebration,
“they really didn’t have much hope”’ for the presiden-

tial race.

Both Tilley and Murphy said the congressional races
held most people’s interest, because the presidential
race was called so early by the television networks.

“A lot of people were jubilant at the presidential re-
sults,’’ Tilley said, ‘‘but were also disappointed. that it

“They were more concerned with the senate and con-

gressional races than the presidential one,’’ Young De-

mocrat President Jim Murphy said.

In Richmond, the party hit its highest point when Sen.
John Warner made his acceptance speech after his op-
ponent, Democrat Edythe Harrison, conceded the race.

On the stage with Warner were former Gov. John Dal-

ton and possible candidates for next year’s governor
race in Virginia, Tilley said.
“It was interesting to see all the handshaking and

campaigning that was going on for next year,”’ Tilley

said.

But Tilley did have one complaint about the party.

Calendar

 

NOVEMBER 8, 1984

changed

to please coaches

 

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

The beginning of classes next year
has been moved to Sept. 16, a week
later than approved by the faculty
last month, according to Dean of the
College John W. Elrod.

With “‘only a few dissenting votes,’’
the faculty Monday agreed to change
the 1985-86 academic calendar it
originally approved in order to leave
room for two weeks of classes be-
tween Thanksgiving vacation and
semester exams.

“Tam very pleased with the facul-
ty’s decision,”’ said Athletic Director
William D. McHenry. McHenry led
his department’s effort to get a
reconsideration of the earlier vote,
which produced a calendar that
would have forced the cancellation or
rescheduling of at least four basket-
ball games and a major eight-team
wrestling tournament hosted by
W&L.

Under the former calendar, the
normal two-week gap between the
end of Thanksgiving break and the
start of exams would have been
shortened to one week. The calendar
approved Monday would reinstate
the two-week gap with Dec. 20 as the
last day for final exams.

Freshmen orientation will begin
Sept. 9, and matriculation for up-
perclassmen is set for Sept. 13.

“The case for the athletic depart-
ment,” Elrod said, ‘‘was made
clearer to the faculty, I think, in
terms of the number of athletic
events involved and the planning re-
quired for these events, especially

“the wrestling tournament, and this

helped the faculty to vote for the
change.

“‘T think it became clearer that the
one week between the break and the

start of exams was, pedagogically,
less than acceptable. I think the
faculty made the right decision.”’

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, an advocate of
the former calendar, said she ex-
pects some staff will have to work
through the Christmas-New Year’s
holiday, a week the University is nor-
mally closed.

Harold S. Head, who as University
Registrar is in charge of a number of
people who will have to work through
the holidays, said the new calendar
“hurts a lot of little people.’’ He said
he hopes to give the administrative
personnel a week off at some other
time in the year, and Elrod said some
special compensation would be pro-
vided for the clerks and secretaries
who have to work during the holi-
days.

McHenry acknowledged that the
administrative staff ‘‘will be under
some pressure, and for that, I’m tru-
ly sorry.”

“But,” he said, ‘‘I believe the new
calendar makes sense for the
students.”

Head basketball coach Verne D.
Canfield said he was ‘‘extremely
pleased’’ with the faculty’s decision
and felt the result showed that the
faculty was “‘cognizant of the student
inits decision.”

“It was very surprising and very
pleasing,” he said. ‘‘I think it was a
case of the faculty having all the
facts. I believe it was a very positive
decision.”’

In related action, Elrod said Presi-
dent John D. Wilson proposed that, in
the future, calendars be approved
two years in advance.

“It is easier to undo a mistake two
years in advance that it is only one
year inadvance,”’ Elrod said.

Drug, arson suspects
question Read action

Two former Virginia Military In-
stitute cadets, one who was indicted
this fall for drug distribution and the
other who was arrested this fall for
arson, have charged that Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’
Read is guilty of violating the princi-
ple of lawyer-client confidentiality.
Read denies the allegation.

The two, who left VMI without
graduating, say that when they met
with Read in his role as a private at-
torney, he gained information about
drug-related matters that he then
passed on to the special grand jury
that investigated local drug traffick-
ing earlier this year.

Jeffrey R. Pack, 23, made the
charge in a motion for dismissal of
his case that was filed Thursday in
Rockbridge County Circuit Court. He
was indicted Sept. 4 on six counts of
selling psilocybin, a hallucinogen. He
was arrested Sept. 6 and is free on a
$20,000 property bond.

The 16-page motion refers to ‘‘a
friend of Jeffrey Pack’s’’ and de-
scribes his experiences with Read.
Matthew B. Walrod, 23, yesterday
said he was that person. He was ar-
rested Sept. 27 on charges that he set
fire in May to a building at VMI. He
said he has signed a confession and is
free on a $10,000 property bond.

On Friday, Read filed a six-page
response motion that said the Pack
document was ‘‘a politically motivat-
ed attack against the entire drug in-
vestigation and against me personal-
ly.”

The original motion was filed by
Lexington attorney Thomas C. Spen-
cer. It was signed in standard form:
“Jeffrey R. Pack, By Counsel.”’ The
motion, however, appears to be
speaking in Spencer’s name when it
says:

“The effects and after effects of the

special grand jury’s investigation
ought to be of profound concern for
those of us charged with the admin-
istration of justice in Lexington and
Rockbridge County.”’

J. Todd Jones, president of the
Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar
Association, said that Read and
Spencer ‘have been political enem-
ies for some time.”

Spencer said he filed the motion
because he ‘“‘thought it was in the
best interest of my client and was
consistent with my professional re-
sponsibility.”

“It is a common tactic of lawyers
who represent criminal defendants to
make motions alleging prosecutorial
misconduct or motions to dismiss,”’
Read said in the response. He said
Spencer has used the tactic ‘‘many
times before”’ but that he has lost on
each occasion.

“As Commonwealth’s Attorney,”’
the response continued, ‘‘I make no
apology for the use of the special
grand jury, helicopters, narcotics
dogs, informants, immunity status,
or agreements to turn State’s evi-
dence to stop the sale, distribution,
and use of illegal drugs in Rock-
bridge County and Lexington.”

The Pack motion, which refers to
Read’s ‘‘warlike campaign against
members of society who use drugs,”
said the special grand jury ‘‘function-
ed from the outset as an inquisitorial
arm of the prosecutor’s office”
rather than remaining ‘‘an indepen-
dent investigative body.” _

It is legal in Virginia for the Com-
monwealth’s Attorney to also prac-
tice private law. ‘This private prac-
tice provides the opportunity for

torial misconduct directly affecting

OPINION

Page 2
November 8, 1984

 

Four more years

Tuesday, President Ronald Reagan saw that he did indeed
have the nation wrapped around his little finger. He captured
the votes of the majority of males, females, Catholics, Pro-
testants and minorities. He won, by most accounts, a man-
date to govern and continue with the agenda he began four
years ago.

But more than merely receiving a vote of confidence from
the voters nationwide (are the District of Columbia and
Minnesota part of the United States?), Ronald Reagan saw
that America is in love with Ronald Reagan.

I suppose that shouldn’t surprise anyone, considering the
smooth-talking and feeling-evoking advertisements that the
Reagan-Bush campaign ran this fall. We heard that America
is waking up again, and that she is coming back. People are
feeling good once more about their country. Flags are wav-
ing. People are remembering the words to the national an-
them. Red, white and blue are once more colors people wear
with pride, on Main Street in downtown USA or on the
Champs Elysees in Paris. And all that in four short years.

It was, after all, five years ago last Sunday that 49
Americans were taken hostage in Tehran. The days of shame
began. Inflation was already on the rampage — 20 percent
—and interest rates had soared. Unemployment had begun to
nose slowly upward. A national malaise had set in. People
began to speak of the United States in terms reminiscent of
Rome during her final days of world rule.

The electorate in 1980 faced a clear challenge. It involved
choosing between the policies of the failing Carter ad-
ministration and the optimistic, hard-working ideas of the
Reagan ticket. In 1980, the public favored Reagan.

Some might say we haven’t changed much since then.
Wrong. We must give the voting public more credit. This
time, it voted for something it believed in, not against
something that had failed it. For the first time since Dwight
Eisenhower, it elected a President to two consecutive terms
while simultaneously establishing a historic margin of vic-
tory. Why? It all goes back to the dream of 1980, that ever
elusive — and unrealistic? — hope that we can indeed “‘begin
the world all over again.”

That statement by Thomas Paine captures the very. es-
sence of the electoral process in this nation and it epitomizes
the feelings Ronald Reagan evokes in the hearts of Amer-
icans. Like that offered by a minister preaching repentance
to a sinful audience, the message is one that offers a very real
hope for renewal and growth to the listener. The electoral
process affords the opportunity for America to reconsider the
immediate past and decide upon the immediate future.

In his concession speech Tuesday night, Walter Mondale
admitted he had been beat. The America he saw — one desir-
ing a fair and compassionate government — did not vote for
his vision. Instead, the vision monopolized by the Republi-
cans of an America consuming apple pie and hot dogs while
lifting Mom in the air carried the day. The America Ronald
Reagan sees is the same America a majority of its inhabi-
tants also want to see. Perhaps there is some truth to the old
adage that we are what we think we are.

For Ronald Reagan and 54 million voters who voted for
him, America is coming back. It has four more years to ar-
rive.

By Nelson Patterson

There he goes again

If there’s one refrain we’ve heard on the news this fall
more often than the tiresome, ‘‘Where’s the beef?’’, it has to
be President Reagan grinning, cocking his head and boldly
assuring the American people that he will not under any cir-
cumstances raise taxes during Reagan II.

But hold onto your wallet — we haven’t passed ‘‘Go’”’ yet.
There’s one small problem: Unless he plans to make the U.S.
Government a United Way agency, he needs to go in quest of
funds — and fast. The budget shortfall is escalating beyond
the wildest nightmare of the most cynical Cold Check Com-
mittee member.

A Gipper gape from some time ago is enlightening if a bit
frightening.

When Reagan was governor of California, a major issue
was whether the state should withhold income tax like is done
at the federal level. Reagan’s trademark firmness came to
the. fore as he announced his vociferous opposition to any
such move. ‘‘My feet are set in concrete on that issue,” he
told residents of the Golden State.

Well, you know how these things happen. Reagan decided
the state needed a little revenue enhancement, and it seemed
a good quick fix would be to withhold the state income tax.

He called a press conference to announce his support for
the move. He told the reporters somewhat sheepishly: “What
you hear, ladies and gentlemen, is the sound of concrete
breaking up around my feet.”’

The Great Equivicator strikes again.

Will June bicentennial go unobserved? -

MY VIEW

 

  

By B. Scott

ee Tilley

Next year will mark the end of an
era at Washington and Lee. It is ap-
parent, whether you were a support-
er or opponent of coeducation, that
certain aspects of our dear W&L are
going to be irretrievably lost. One
chapter of Washington and Lee’s his-
tory is about to be closed, and a new
one is about to be opened.

Clearly the Class of 1985 is in a uni-
que (and some may say enviable)
position. Many years down the road,
these distinguished alums will be
able to talk to their grandsons and
granddaughters, the new generations
of Generals and Generalettes, and
reminisce about the last days of the
“old” W&L. The Class of 1985 will be
the last to graduate from an all-male
Washington and Lee.

Looking back in Olligner Cren-
shaw’s ‘‘General Lee’s College,” it
hit me how apropos it is that 1985
should be the year that the transfor-
mation takes place — the year of the
University’s bicentennial. In a univ-
ersity so devoted to history and trad-

 

 

 

 

ition, I fear that a milestone may be
overlooked without the attention it
deserves.

But 1985 will mark the 236th birth-
day of Washington and Lee, many
will remark--not a bicentennial. Ma-
ny loyalists will accuse me of heresy
for overlooking the 1749 date. I, too,
am proud of the 1749 founding date
and the distinction it provides W&L
as being the sixth oldest school in
America. But 1785 also was an impor-
tant date in the development of W&L
—the year of the first commence-
ment exercises.

It was not until 1776 that a college
curriculum was adopted, modeled
after that at Princeton. In 1782,
Liberty Hall Academy was chartered
as a degree-granting institution of
higher learning, the first to be grant-
ed that status by the new state of Vir-
ginia. On the second Wednesday of
September, 1985, Liberty Hall
Academy, the forerunner of Wash-
ington College and Washington and
Lee University, held its first com-
mencement exercises.

Twelve gentlemen represented
that first graduating class. Among
them were six Presbyterian
ministers, three college presidents, a
governor, a judge and a_ noted
Virginia attorney. The University’s
“first great eccentric,’ Adam
Rankin, was in that class, according

to University Historian Taylor San-
ders. Rankin believed that the end of
the world was imminent, and upon
receiving a vision from God, took up
the task of walking from here to Jer-
usalem. He made it to Philadelphia
before he died.

In the 1870s, the still struggling col-
lege formed a ‘“‘Centennial Commis-
sion”’ in hopes of rejuvenating the in-
stitution. Originally planned in 1782
to coincide with the anniversary of
the charter and the unveiling of
Valentine’s recumbent statue of Lee,
circumstances caused its delay. The
event, by a vote of the Board of
Trustees, was reschedueld to com-
memorate the centennial of the first
graduation ceremonies. The Centen-
nial Commission was given $1,000 to
plan the celebration.

Events later forced this centennial
observance to also be all but nixed.
Margaret Junkin Preston, Lex-
ington’s foremost literary figure,
read a poem that became acclaimed
nationwide as the ‘‘Centennial Ode.”’
The seven governors, 11 senators, 20
congressmen,more than 40 judges
(including one on the Supreme
Court) and 12 college presidents who
had graduated in the past century
were recognized in a speech by the
Rev. Moses Drury Hoge of Rich-
mond.

This June, then, will mark the 200th

 

 

 

 

Cooperation will ease coeducation

MY VIEW

 

By Pamela P. Stallsmith

David Bowie's album ‘Changes”’
describes the trials and tribulations
of coping with a rapidly changing
world, one in which everything is
transitory. This state of flux affects
even the most sacred of institutions,
such as education,

Colleges and universities are con-
sidered involatile. They are seen as
intellectual sanctuaries which serve
as a refuge from the cold, unthinking
world. But no ivory tower existence
ever lasts, which W&L discovered
last July when the Board of Trustees
voted in favor of becoming coeduca-
tional.

Next year the University will un-
dergo what will probably be the big-
gest single change ever in the history
of the school. The admission of
women to the undergraduate pro-
gram will cause a major realignment
of the University’s academic and soc-
ial priorities. For instance, will
sororities be added? What about wo-
mens’ sports teams? Will classes be
added on womens’ history? This
momentous decision by the Trustees
will have great implications, and will
either make or break W&L. I say this
because how smoothly the transition
goes next year from an all-male to
coeducational bastion of learning de-
pends largely on the students.

Whether or not the students or
faculty support the issue is not the
point when discussing coeducation.

What is at stake is the continued har-
monious existence of the University.

The readers are probably curious
as to why I can speak so authori-
tatively of change and its implica-
tions. Last year I spent my junior
year abroad at the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland. In contrast to
the small, intimate atmosphere of
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
and suburban Lynchburg, Edin-
burgh, was, in effect, an imper-
sonalized university in a large,
bustling capital city. When I returned
to Central Virginia at the end of
August, I underwent an adjustment
period. After being away for a year
some changes had occurred
—nothing as extraordinary as W&L’s
decision to go coed, but changes
nevertheless —so a smooth adjust-
ment was vital for an untraumatic
return. My experience is on a much
smaller scale than that to which the
students at W&L will return next
September, but I can certainly em-
pathize with the gravity of this
change.

Next year the institution of W&L
will externally be the same, but its in-
ternal order will be new. It will be a
matter of using the same board by
playing a new game with new play-
ers. The University of today will be
no more next year. That is why it is
important to begin a sort of mental
preparation for next year’s arrival of
women. The future must be faced
and the inevitable accepted, despite
whether one personally agrees or dis-
agrees with coeducation,in order to

avoid a bitter, fragmented Universi-
ty.
The key for a smooth, trouble-free
transition is cohesion. The prevailing
“us and them” mentality — in this
case men against women — should be
synthesized to a “we” attitude, one
which will enrich rather than dene-
grate the University.

That is why it is necessary to put
aside any grudges or disgruntled opi-
nions as they serve only to hamper
The Big Change. Social entropy will
erupt only if it is allowed to. There is
no reason to expect this feared up-
heaval if next year’s freshmen and
transfers are treated accordingly. In
1844 Karl Marx remarked, ‘‘Philoso-
phers have only interpreted the
world in various ways; the point is to
change it.’’ W&L did not expand its
admissions policies 140 years after
that statement just for the sake of
change. The decision to do so was
made for a variety of reasons, with
which by now everyone is very fami-
liar. One cannot interpret the Trust-
ee’s decision to admit women as a
personal affront or as a haphazard
disregard for the University’s tradi-
tion.

For the well-being of W&L every-
one must face the inevitable fact that
next year women will enroll at the
University. One word explains what
should be W&L’s policy toward wel-
coming its new classmates: co-

graduating class. It must be fate that
the bicentennial also marks the pass-
ing. It seems to me only natural that
this year’s commencement exercise-
-which by nature requires a look at
the past’--unless one chooses to look
at the future with total disregard for
the past--would also be a celebration
of our 200-year heritage. We could not
embark on this new journey without
our 200-year legacy.

President John Wilson, Dr. San-
ders and Frank Parsons, executive
assistant to the president, are cur-
rently aware of the situation and are
looking into possible ways of
recognizing the event. Though they
are interested, nothing has been de-
cided yet. In fact, the possibility re-
mains that the ceremonies will be
delayed until the fall of 1985, to be
recognized at the same time the first
women arrive.

“We have a record of letting impor-
tant anniversaries go by unnoticed,”
Parsons said. ‘‘Other schools search
to find opportunities like we have all
the time. We let the 1982 anniversary
of the charter go by with really
minimal notice.”

“It is an opportunity we should
sieze, next fall. We will be welcoming
a significant number of women. This
could link up the media attention
from just the new to how far back our
heritage goes. We can make it work
to our advantage.”’

I do not want 1985 to go by without
some observance of our past. If that
can only happen in the fall, so be it.
But with all of the media attention,
that is going to be directed toward
the coming of the ladies, such an
event cannot help but be lost. .
Another anniversary will pass un- —
noticed.

Maybe the Executive Committee,
Cole Dawson and senior class Presi-
dent Darby Brower can look into the
situation further and talk to the
administration more.

If the change were not coming, it
would be natural that the 200th com-
mencement exercises would be re- |
cognized in June. Let’s hope that |
when that time rolls around, we can
close the old chapter with a fitting
denouement.

Magazine is
too biased,
student says

To the Editors:

On page 30 of the Washington and
Lee University catalogue, there ex-
ists a description of the purpose of
the Washington and Lee Political
Review.

“The Political Review is a non-
partisan student publication devoted
to the consideration of current
political issues.”’

Clearly, this issue, fall 1984, has
breached its original intent, in that it
has chosen not only to be partisan,
but to be blatantly partisan. With the
editor, the assistant editor and the
managing editor all self-professed
Republicans, not to mention the ma-
jority of the writers, how can it be
anything but partisan?

It would seem that the intent, ‘‘con-
sideration of current political issues”
can only be reached through con-
scious striving for bi-partisan essays,
a feat which obviously was not ac-
complished in this fall’s issue.

Needless to add, this issue does lit-
tle to propel the idea of intellectual
debate and discussion of the impen-
ding political issues of the day and
goes against the premise on which
this great institution was founded
—liberal thought and _ intellectual
open-mindedness. To this extent, this
issue has done the students of
Washington and Lee a deplorable
disservice.

I would, therefore, ask that the
editors of this review abide by the
description provided by the cata-
logue. Only by keeping this publica-
tion bi-partisan can it spark any in-
tellectual discussion of the contem-
porary political issues of the day,

Election coverage like ‘assembly line’

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

Once again this year, students working for WLUR-FM
and Cable Channel IX presented live coverage of the elec-
tion returns Tuesday night. Ring-tum Phi staff reporter
Bill Bloom spent the evening observing the activity on the
third floor of Reid Hall.

7:06 p.m. I opened the door of Reid Hall and immed-
iately heard the noise of a machine at full tilt two floors
above me. The Cable Channel IX televison station and
WLUR radio station had combined forces to produce a

‘ simultaneous broadcast of election returns and analy-

sis,

I entered the main floor of action and began to ob-
serve the various activities encompassing the whole
third floor of Reid Hall and involving more than 40 peo-
ple.

7:11 p.m. I find rooms of people, some watching
television tuned to the four major commercial net-
wrks, others waiting by telephones for incoming
Stories, quite a few constantly preparing copy from the
Associated Press wire for the anchormen: seniors Bob
Halloran and Bob Bryant. The newscast itself was
spread out over five rooms with several people engine-
ering it. It was almost like watching an assembly line.
As the raw material came in, it was processed, con-
structed into a product, shined up a bit and marketed

7:20 p.m. Forrest Cannon, a freshman who was
encouraged by a friend to help out this evening, describ-
ed it as a “‘rat race.’’ Cannon, who is not a journalism
major, was responsible for receiving calls with Rock-
bridge County and Lexington results, tallying them and

_ giving them to a script writer. He also was responsible

results.

7:26 p.m. The media machine was shifting into high
gear as more and more results began flooding in from
across the country. The numerous tasks seem to be sec-
ond nature for these people — almost an inborn sense of
the newsroom. Flashbacks of the now-defunct televi-
sion series ‘“‘Lou Grant’’ were continuously moving
through my mind.

7:32 p.m. I made my way into the studio and witness-
ed, for the first time, a live broadcast. The tension and
concentration in these few rooms was think enough to
cut with a knife. The engineering of the show was in-
credible to to watch. It was similar to seeing Houston
control during a spaceship launch. Technical people
were constantly communicating, trouble shooting, ad-
justing, always trying to improve the quality of produc-
tion. The directing engineer, Thomas W. ‘linsiley, pro-
vided occasional assistance. Tinsley is the director of
technical services for the University and is a 1975 grad-
uate of W&L.

7:50 p.m. I spoke to journalism professor Robert J. de
Maria about the seemingly professional broadcast that
was taking place. The broadcast was completely per-
formed by students under the coordination of senior Pe-
ter Wright, WLUR news director, with assistance from
senior Allen Reese. The whole operation consisted of
about 50 people (planning, broadcasting, location
assignments, etc.), about half of whom were journalism
majors. According to de Maria, the experience gained
by these students, taking on the whole production them-
selves, is unmatched by a majority of the schools in the
nation.

8:04 p.m. I made my move from the broadcast booth
back to the newsroom. The media machine still in high
gear was preparing to broadcast the Reagan victory,

for informing WVTF radio of Roanoke of the local

ald Huffman agreed. ‘‘It would be in-
correct to say that there’s not a coat-

 

tail effect,’’ he said. ‘‘In these races
. that looked close, our candidates

Started with an 18 percentage point

' difference. There definitely is a coat-
, taileffect.”’

M. Caldwell Butler, who was the
6th District congressman for a de-
cade before retiring from office in

1982, echoed that assessment.

“I think Reagan coattails were

very helpful,”’ said Butler, who is

now a partner in a Roanoke law firm.

’ “Ray Garland would have done a lot
- worse if it were not for the coattails.”’

“Congressman Olin was vulner-

‘able on a lot of issues — his criticism
-of Reagan, his liberal voting record
_— but Mr. Garland did not present a

reasonable alternative,’ he said.
“People voted reluctantly for Olin,
but they would have voted for a
strong Republican ina minute.”
“T think Ray Garland was very un-
-popular,”’ he added. “It was a per-
sonal, negative vote on Garland in
‘the Roanoke Valley. He’s just been a
_bad candidate.”’
Garland carried the northern part
‘of the district, including Harrison-
_burg, but lost in the southern portion,
including the city of Roanoke and the
‘Roanoke Valley.
Butler said Republicans are not
conceding the seat to the rival party.
““T expect the Republicans will con-
,tinue to try for the district,’’ he said.
“A Democrat will never be able to

_ ‘rest. He’s going to have to persuade

.the people that he’s voting the con-
servative line.”’

He said speculation about who

.might be the party nominee in the
1986 race is premature until after
next year’s gubernatorial race, but
said there are people ‘‘all around the
district’ who are possibilities for the
post.

The first prospect Butler mention-
ed was Charles F. Phillips Jr., mayor
of Lexington and a Washington and
Lee economics professor.

“Chuck Phillips is probably a good

“one, but he’s probably not interest-

ed,’ Butler said. ‘‘He’s geograph-

_ically well located, knowledgeable,

experienced and conservative. And
he’s Republican.”’
‘People that are well qualified

often aren’t all that interested,’’ he
added.

“I’ve got tremendous interest in it,
but I doubt if I’d run,” Phillips said.
“There’s no way someone at W&L
can run for an office and ask for a
leave. It just doesn’t make any
sense.”’

“With a faculty like we have, you
almost have to hire someone to re-

place you,” he continued. ‘‘That’s -

especially true in the economics de-
partment, where we all have our
specialties.”

“I’m not interested in the General
Assembly,” he added. ‘‘Washington
might be of interest at some time, but
it would also mean leaving Washing-
ton and Lee, and that would be a
tough thing to do.”’

A number of the people interview-
ed offered harsh criticism of Gar-
land’s strategy and inability as a
campaigner. The same group said
Olin has worked quickly to build a
base of support through frequent per-
sonal appearances and careful atten-
tion to constituent service.

“I never felt Garland was a ter-
ribly good candidate,” Sabato said.
“TI don’t think his style plays that
well.”’

As an example of Garland’s inept-
ness, Butler pointed to the candi-
date’s comparison this summer of
the Democratic Party to ‘‘a busted-
out $2 whore.”’

“That was inexcusable,’ Butler
said.

When Garland addressed his sup-
porters Tuesday night, he urged Olin
to use the resources of the office for
constituent benefit rather than for
personal political gain.

“Olin has spent an awful lot of
money on postcards and the like,”
Butler said. ‘I think it was a legi-
timate criticism, but I don’t think a
concession speech was the appro-
priate place for it.”’

Garland said yesterday from his
Roanoke home that a persistent cam-
paign difficulty in the Roanoke Val-
ley had been that ‘‘the people here
are tired of me.”’

“T’ve been in politics here for 16
years,’’ he said. ‘“‘You reach a point
where you've been around too long.”

Garland said an incumbent con-
gressman has an enormous advan-
tage over his challenger because of
the tremendous volume of the office-
holder can generate. He said an out-
sider must rely on advertising to

accomplish the same results.

As his most effective piece of ‘‘paid
media,’ Garland cited a television
commercial that showed him in the
Oval Room of the White House with
President Reagan. ‘‘It created an as-
sociation with a popular and power-
ful man,” he said. “It had a certain
celebrity appeal toit.’’

Prior to this week’s defeat, Gar-
land lost his bid for the 6th District
nomination in 1982 and was ousted
from his state senate seat in 1983.
“Three strikes and you're out,’’ Sa-
bato said. ‘‘He’s had three strikes.”

“T would say that his availability
as a candidate is over,”’ Butler said.
“T would not encourage him to run
again at present.”

Election Day in Lexington:
It all added up in the end

As was the case in much of the na-
tion, election turnout Tuesday was
heavy in both Lexington precincts,
according to election officials.

At the Fire Department, the polling
place for the West Precinct, 1,388 of
1,600 registered voters cast ballots,
said Becky Merchant, who with five
other election officers supervised the
day’s events. This represented about
an 80 percent turnout, she said.

In the East Precinct, 810 of 990
registered voters voted at City Hall,
according to figures tabulated there,
said election official Herman Taylor.

There were few problems with
unregistered voters or those who
decided to vote late in both precincts.
Although this has been a problem in
the past, Merchant said that this year
“we were really lucky.’’ The only
problem, she said, was that a few
people were uncertain of where to
vote. Taylor said that in his precinct,
there were one or two voters who had
moved prior to the registration
deadline and were ineligible to vote.

Other than this, Taylor said, the
problems were fairly routine.
Several blind voters needed
assistance as did handicapped
voters, who were allowed to vote
from their cars with a special ballot.

Both Merchant and Taylor noticed

Balloting for the referendum will

Because the voting will occur at the

Last spring, turnout was only 70
votes short of 50 percent. I think it

dent body was very much in favor of

it will pass.”’

If the referendum is adopted, the

mittee will increase from 12 to 13.

Taylor said, paced around nervously
and finally decided to go ahead and

Merchant said she was surprised at
the older people who were casting
their first ballot. ‘‘There is no way for

she said, adding that this may not be

Mann, who supported Gary Hart for the Democratic nomination,
said, ‘‘At the time, I didn’t feel Mondale could mount the kind of cam-

Student says he expected Gandhi slaying

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

In the aftermath of last week’s assassination of
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India must “recognize
the pluralistic nature of its society” if its democracy is

survive, according to a Washington and Lee student

ho spent the summer in that country

Senior Clark Morledge, who worked as a missionary

n India, added that the assassination of Gandhi was not
entirely unexpected following a summer of tension be-
tween rival religious groups

Morledge was one of about 200 American college stu-

dents who spent 10 weeks as missionaries in such coun-
tries as Taiwan, Mexico, Belgium and Nigeria through
1 program sponsored by the Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship, part of the International Fellowship of
Evangelical Students, Morledge, a mathematics major
from Williamsburg, is president of W&L’s Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship.

Although his job consisted mostly of carpentry and
construction work at the Christian mission in the nor-
thern state of Kashmir, Morledge also helped lead a lo-
cal youth group and sometimes talked with the local
people who came to the mission.

In the process, he gained an understanding of life and

culture in India, the world’s largest democracy.

India’s government is similar to that of the United
States during the 1780s because the state governments
hold a great deal of power, Morledge explained.

Gandhi’s party is one of at least 12 parties that have a
significant amount of power in the country, he added.
However, it is the only party that represents each of the

states, which have different cultures (and languages,
more than 85 of which are spoken in the country).

“Going from state is not like going from Virginia to

North Carolina,’’ Morledge said. ‘‘It’s even more differ-
ent from going from somewhere such as Mississippi to
New York.”

Morledge said he was not surprised last week when he
heard of Gandhi's assassination by two of her body-
guards, members of the Sikh religious sect

One of the causes of the assassination was an incident
in early June, when the Indian Army stormed the Sikh’s
‘““Mecca,”’ the Golden Temple, supposedly to prevent
Sikh terrorist attacks, Morledge said.

After this, ‘people realized that Mrs. Gandhi's life
was definitely in danger,’’ Morledge added. ‘‘She’d
been threatened ever since the day after the temple was
attacked.”

Storming the temple, which housed up to 1,000 Sikhs
and was a warehouse for arms, ‘‘was a very, very dif-
ficult decision for Mrs. Gandhi,’ Morledge explained.
“She pretty much felt...that because of the safety of
the county, she had to go in there. It could be her life to
do that, but most people in India generally supported
her in doing that.”’

Afterward, though, the Sikhs, particularly the more
radical members, regarded Gandhi as ‘‘a demonic
figure.”

Morledge, who arrived in India less than a week after
the attack on the Golden Temple, said that throughout
the summer he could feel the tension between the Sikhs
and India’s other religious sects, especially the Hindus
and the Moslems, the two dominant groups.

“Every day, the news service and the radio always
were reporting that at least a half dozen terrorists had
been picked up in the Punjab state,’’ directly south of
Kashmir, he said.

About the beginning of July, he added, the chief min-
ister of the Kashmir state was accused of smuggling
arms to the Sikhs from Pakistan through Kashmir.

Gandhi’s people decided to overthrow the chief min-

ister [a Moslem] and put their own person in there,”’
Morledge said.

“That created a whole lot of tension. When that hap-
pened, there was an uproar and a lot of demonstra-
tions.”’

The Sikh religious sect was formed, Morledge ex-
plained, about 500 years ago as ‘‘an attempt to recon-
cile” Islam and Hinduism and to blend and attract fol-
lowers from both religions.

However, each of the other two groups thought the
Sikhs were leaning too far in the opposite direction.
“What started out as a movement trying to reconcile
two others has been reduced to a movement fighting for
its own survival,’’ Morledge said. ‘As a result, it is very
militaristic.”’

Sikhs are required a wear a certain kind of under-
wear, a ring, a bracelet and a turban and to carry a dag-
ger, Morledge added.

Because of Gandhi's popularity as a ‘“‘mother figure,”’
Morledge said the violence that followed her assassina-
tion also did not surprise him.

“I knew it was going to happen,”’ he added. ‘‘When I
heard she had been shot, my first thought was that
there were going to be hundreds ot Sikhs whose lives
were going to be in danger.”’

One reason for this, Morledge explained, is that the
concepts of morality and right and wrong are not strict-
ly understood in India.

“The ethical standard is there,” he said. ‘‘In theory,
they recognize it, but in practice, they ignore it.”’

“‘There’s no sense of an absolute right and wrong,’’ he
added. Violence such as that resulting in the deaths of
1,100 Indians in the past week ‘‘is not necessarily sanc-
tioned, but it is understandable. A lot of people say,
‘Well, that’s just the way itis.’ ”’

As long as the Sikh radicals refrain from further as-
sassinations, ‘‘the immediate reaction will eventually

wear out after a while,’’ Morledge said.

“The real question,”’ he added, ‘‘is ‘Is Pakistan going
to take advantage of this situation?’ That’s a big ques-
tion.”

Since India’s last war with Pakistan, its neighbor to
the north, Morledge said, ‘‘India’s had a habit of when-
ever there’s a lot of internal trouble, to blame it on
Pakistan. . . Since [1971] there has been a lot of talk *
about war. Anything can provoke a war over there.”

Another question, Morledge said, is ‘‘What’s the new
government going to be like? With Gandhi gone, is there
going to be a glue to hold that country together? Look-
ing at India right now, you just don’t see anybody.’

Although Morledge added that India may not recover
for a while, the country’s democracy should remain sta-
ble, as long as some way is found to balance the vastly
differing regional interests.

If one group gains control, “‘it’ll fall apart,’’ Morledge
said. “It’s just a miracle that India is doing like it is
right now.”’

 

Elrod anticipates an increase in number of female faculty

 

By ANDY y ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

As more women. become
undergraduates at Washington and
Lee over the next ten years, ad-
ministrators say, the University will
ilso try to increase the number of
women on the faculty.

“It’s very important that we try in
1 rational and careful way to add
women to our faculty,’ said Dean of
the College John W. Elrod. ‘‘We’ll be
ooking for opportunities to do that
during the 10-year transition period.”

“There is no quota. We hope that
we will be able to bring well-qualified
women onto the faculty,”’ he added.

Elrod explained that he believed
the number of women on the faculty
compared to men was_ probably
lower compared to the ratio at other
universities. However, he added that
this was hardly surprising consider-
ing the University’s all-male history.
Washington and Lee has one female
associate professor, four female
assistant professors and four female
instructors.

Princeton University reported that

 

Coeducation:

8 3

What Will It Mean?

in 1970, when the school first went
coed, it had only one tenured woman
on the faculty, two women who were
assistant professors and 17 women
who were either lecturers or instruc-
tors. Ten years later Princeton had
10 tenured women professors, 40
women assistant professors and 35
women lecturers and instructors.

“T hope every department will look
hard at the women applicants in its
pool,’ said Elrod. “I wouldn’t want
any department to have to take less
than the best qualified candidate. But
I hope we find some of these are
women.”’

Elrod said that with coeducation
making a teaching job at Washington
and Lee more attractive for women,

 

the university would benefit from the
increased size of the applicant pool
for faculty positions. ‘‘The quality of
our new people should go up,” he
said.

He said he agreed with the findings
of a Princeton report that said that it
was important to have women facul-
ty members who could serve as role
models for female undergraduates.

“Just as it’s important for women
to have role models in law and
medicine, it’s important to have
them in education,” Elrod said.

He added that as a spinoff of hav-
ing a strong female presence on the
faculty, more undergraduate women
might be encouraged to become col-
lege professors themselves. One of
the major problems facing univer-
sities today is that not enough
students want careers as college pro-
fessors, Elrod asserted. In 1966, 1.8
percent of college students said they
wanted to become professors, while a
1982 survey showed that only 0.2 per-
cent of college students said they
wanted to become professors, Elrod
reported.

likely will be gradual, Elrod in-
dicated. New faculty members are
added due to retirement, resignation
and expansion, and naturally not all
the new faculty members will be
women, Elrod said.

“There are not going to be many
new positions opening up in the facul-
ty within the next 10 years,” Elrod
said, noting that about 80 percent of
the faculty members at Washington
and Lee are tenured.

Elrod reported that at present the

University is searching specifically
for women to fill two newly created
staff positions. A woman will be hired
as an assistant athletic director in
charge of coordinating women’s
physical education courses, in-
tramurals and intercollegiate sports,
and a woman will be hired as a new
assistant dean of students, Elrod
said.

Elrod said that an expansion in the
size of the faculty might be necessary
in the coming years for several

reasons. For one, the new general
education requirements have _in-
creased enrollment in classes in
some departments. Also, Elrod said
that it was not unthinkable that
female undergraduates at Washing-
ton and Lee might favor different
courses than male students, placing
additional pressure on some depart-
ments. Nevertheless, Elrod said it is
impossible to know what depart-
ments might be expanded or by how
many positions.

Darrell hints at food service
changes for women next fall

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

As Washington and Lee prepares
for the arrival of the first female
undergraduates next fall, W&L Food
Services director Jerry Darrell is
making sure that women will enjoy
the menu and atmosphere at Evans
Dining Hall.

Darrell said he is considering
changes in the menu, such as a third
entree at each meal, and changes in
the atmosphere of the dining hall to
make it more hospitable to women.

One of the complaints that female
law students have voiced to the coed-
ucation committee is that the food in
the dining hall is too starchy. Darrell
said this is due to the eating habits of
W&L’s male students.

“Our guys are meat and potatoes
guys,’’ Darrell explained.

Darrell said that although items
such as the salad bar, quiche and
yogurt had become popular with
some W&L students in recent years,
90 percent of the students who eat in
the dining hall still are ‘‘meat and
potatoes guys.”

“We do serve a lot of that (starchy
food), but we try to serve something
with it that is non-starchy,”’ Darrell
added.

For next year, Darrell is consider-
ing a three-entree-per-meal plan that
he learned about from a friend at Ro-
chester Institute of Technology. At
each meal, both lunch and dinner,

students would have a choice be-
tween red meat or pork, white meat
or fish and a third non-meat entree.
Items in the meatless entree cate-
gory would include such dishes as
vegetarian lasagne, spinach and rice
casserole and fettuccini alfredo.

Darrell said a three-entree plan
such as this would not increase the
cost of a dining hall meal to the stu-
dents because the amount of food
consumed would not increase. People
will be eating a wider variety of food
instead, Darrell explained.

Another option the dining hall
could use to diversify the menu would
be to provide a salad bar at lunch as
well as at dinner. Darrell said that if
there seems to be a demand for the
salad bar at lunch next year, he
might decide to start providing it.

Students can select a pre-made
salad from the serving line during
lunch.

Darrell said a second factor that
makes him reluctant to serve the
salad bar during lunch is that stu-
dents might start to enjoy it less
because they will take it for granted.
Darrell said that when the dining hall
started having ‘“‘steak night’’ twice a
month instead of once a month the
students did not seem to look forward
to it as much. Likewise, students
might start to get tired of the salad
bar, Darrell said.

Darrell said next year he might
also try to make the dining hall more
attractive by trying some new decor-
ative ideas. Men at W&L were never
too worried about the atmosphere of

the dining hall, but Darrell said he
will try to do more decorating next
year.

“I’ve got a couple ideas that are
going to be surprising,’ Darrell said.

The Cockpit also may be in for
some changes next year, Darrell in-
dicated.

“T would like to see the Cockpit as a
place where women will want to visit.
I think next year it’s going to be a
natural place for women to go. And
once they go, men are going to fol-
low,’, Darrell commented.

Darrell said that he is trying to
draw a bigger dinner crowd to the
Cockpit with his new line of sand-
wiches in order to get students to
start thinking of the Cockpit as more
than just a place to drink beer.

Darrell is even considering chang-
ing the name of the Cockpit. He said
that unlike many other universities,
nothing in the name ‘Cockpit’ re
flects the fact that it is the Washing-
ton and Lee tavern.

Before making any changes,
however, Darrell is planning on get-
ting a lot of input from students and
faculty on what changes are necess-
ary. Darrell will meet with the Coed-
ucation Steering Committee Nov. 15,
and he is encouraging female law
student students to discuss both the
positive and negative features of the
dining hall with him. Darrell said he
also has begun inquiring about the
food programs at other universities
that recently have switched to
coeducation such as _ Davidson,
Princeton and Sewanee.

White
No suit filed yet

The attorney for Minority Affairs
Director John L. White said Tuesday
that White has not filed a discrimina-
tion lawsuit for his Oct. 22 firing by
University President John D. Wilson.

White, who has not confirmed that
he is planning a lawsuit but said he
has retained an attorney in the mat-
ter, has 90 days from the date of the
firing to contact the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission in or-
der to file a suit.

Melvin Hill, of the Lynchburg law
firm Charles Mangum & Associates,
said he has not talked to White since
last week.

‘He has just talked to me about his
resignation,’ Hill said, ‘‘but we
haven't discussed the matter any fur-
ther.”’

Hill, who said he did not discuss a
lawsuit with White, added that White
is not actually his client because no
monetary agreement has been made.

‘Marathoner takes challenges in stride

‘

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

 

Sunday, Oct. 28, was not the best day
for running a marathon, especially one
through the boroughs of New York Ci-
ty. It was relatively warm — 79 degrees
—and the humidity was an unseason-
able 96 percent. Most people would not
have begun a marathon.

But not so for George Cunningham.
For the avid marathon runner and
familiar face behind the post office
counter, the course was a challenge,
and nothing, including the weather,
could stop him from undertaking the
run through New York City to Central
Park.

“I had a poor time at the finish,” he
said. “A 4:38.47. But it was the worst
weather I've ever run in.”

People know Cunningham because

_ \f his voice. Having had a laryngec-

tomy in 1978, he speaks with some

’ difficulty. The stoma at the base of
_ his neck through which he breathes is

not easily seen. But his handicap has

* not hindered him in his pursuit of

>

   

running excellence.

“I was running before the opera-
tion in 1978,”’ he noted. ‘‘The only pro-
blem it presents is you can’t take in
as much oxygen through the stoma
as you can through the nose or
mouth.”’

A veteran of ‘‘somewhere between
20 and 25”’ marathons, he finds run-
ning the key to relaxation.

“T just enjoy running,” he said. ‘I
can go out there at lunch time and
run five or six miles and I feel like a
different person. I feel so good when I
return and I recuperate so fast. I
may be as tired and sore as I am lac-
ing my shoes but afterward I feel like
a whole different person.’’

Cunningham began running in 1975
because, as he put it, ‘‘I just decided I
was going to doit.”

He began by walking and running,
gradually working his way up to race
capability. In his first race in 1978, he
finished 19th out of 37 runners, ‘‘pret-
ty close to midway.’’ The next year,
in the same race, he bettered his time
by 10 minutes over the same course.
The rest is history.

Alum donates
swords, pistols
to art center

_ By JOHN RILEY
Special to The Phi

 

_ A collection of 13 antique swords
and three pistols has been donated to

’ Washington and Lee’s Reeves Cen-

_ ter, according to James Whitehead,
curator of the center.

The collection was donated by

, Frank B. Hayne, a 1915 alumnus of
Washington and Lee. Hayne, of Flat

* Rock, N.C., died June 25.

Among the swords, the most not-
able is a 16th-century Italian swept--

* hilt rapier made by the famous Caino

. makers of Milan, according to N.
Marshall Jarrett, a W&L history pro-

’ fessor and a sword collector himself.

“It is the same type of sword that
the Three Musketeers used,”’ Jarrett

* said.

, The 43-inch blade of the weapon
made it so dangerous that it was out-
lawed by Cardinal Richelieu during

. the Reign of Terror in France, Jar-
rett added.

One of the pistols is an ornate Tur-

, kish model of unknown age, and the
other two are reproductions of the

‘ pistols used in the 1804 duel between

, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.

Neither Whitehead nor Jarrett
could place an approximate value on

, the collection, which will be housed in
the Reeves Center or, possibly, the

organizers

Sessoms said he also was pleased
with the event.

‘“‘We’ve proven that the activity is
popular,”’ he added. ‘With a fairly
modest amount of activity and work,
you've got a really good activity.”

This was the first year that a tail-
gate party was held during Parents’
Weekend. Sessoms said one of the
purposes was to get the alumni and
the students involved together. In ad-
dition, the activity helped give the
athletic program a great deal of sup-
port.

“I guess we doubled or tripled the
attendance at the soccer game (Sat-
urday afternoon),’’ Sessoms said.

Finally, Sessoms said that part of
the success lies in the fact that it
gave students a terrific place to bring
their parents.

“The reaction from the parents
was extremely positive, and the
athletes appreciated it because it
helped attendance a lot, especially at
the soccer game,’’ said Jim Kerr, one
of the students who assisted the
Alumni Association in planning the
event. “I think it was a resounding
success.”

“The weather had a lot to do with
it,” he continued. ‘‘It was a beautiful
day and a beautiful location. It had a
little less stiffness than, for example,
the president’s reception.”

“It was another opportunity for
parents to meet the guys in their
son’s fraternity and, more impor-
tantly, to meet your other friends
who are in other fraternities or are
independents,” Kerr added.

because of the relatively few hills
present.

The courses for the Virginia Beach
Marathon and the Marine Marathon
in Washington, D.C. are easier be-
cause of their flat geographies, he ad-
ded.

“I just prefer Boston because there
are so few hills, just one big hill at the
20 mile mark,”’ he said. ‘“‘But I don’t
think that I will ever run in the
Boston (marathon) again because of
the time limits involved.”’

To qualify. for the Boston
Marathon, a runner’s time must be
under 3:30. Though Cuningham’s
personal best time is a 3:28 in the
Waynesboro Marathon in 1978, he has
not been able to regain that time to
qualify for Boston again.

Although he said he enjoys races,
he tries to avoid short races of five or
10 kilometers. ‘I’m just the slowest
runner in those races in a 60-mile
radius,’ he noted.

Currently, Cunningham is prepar-
ing for a 50-mile race called the JFK

Md., Nov. 17.

Horsemanship is not

 

By BILL HANNA
Special to The Phi

 

Southern Seminary Junior College
has quietly developed one of the best
horsemanship programs in the
United States and Canada.

Its riders have won the Inter-
collegiate National Championship
four of the last five years.

What many people don’t see is the
equine program behind the showing
of horses. It includes a Horseman-
ship Certificate, an associate in
science degree in Equine Manage-
ment and an associate degree that
combines both these areas.

The Horsemanship Certificate
gives the student a knowledge of
horses and skills in riding. It includes
courses on the physiology, history
and development of horses. Nutri-
tion, illness and care, breeding and
stable management are also taught.
The student also must learn to ride,
show, train and teach others to ride
to get the certificate.

An associate degree in liberal arts,
physical education or animal science
also is needed.

The remaining two equine degrees
are new to Southern Seminary and
will be offered for the first time in the
fall of 1985.

The Equine Management degree is
designed for students who wish to be-
come stable managers trainers or
breeders of horses on a full-time
basis.

The program emphasizes the bus-
iness knowledge needed to work in
the horse industry. If contains all of
the courses normally required in the
first two years of a management
skills major in a four-year institu-
tion. This allows students to transfer
into a four-year program if they wish
to continue for a degree in business
administration, accounting or man-
agement.

The associate degree in Equine
Management with a Horsemanship
Certificate is the most extensive
equine program Southern Seminary
offers.

This is a three year program re-
quiring an internship at a large
breeding and training farm that is
taken either during the summer be-
tween the second and third year or
during the final year.

The program is designed for stu-
dents who plan to operate a stable
raising and training horses.

According to Southern Seminary’s
academic dean, Joseph Carter, the
new programs were created partly

His conditioning for the race in-
cluded a 31-mile practice last
weekend and another 30 miles this
weekend. So far, he said he isn’t too
satisfied with his practice times
Last weekend, he strained a muscle
and had to walk more than he would
during the actual race

“But I expect that I'll do better this
weekend,”’ he said.

He is hoping for cooler weather
than he had during the New York
marathon. ‘I do best in weather with
temperatures in the low 50s with low
humidity and sort of cloudy,” said
Cunningham, adding that ‘‘a little
rain helps.”’

Outside, the weather had taken a
turn for the worse. Mist had turned to
a gentle rain, and Cunningham was
leaving on his lunch break to go home
and choose one of his six pairs of run-
ning shoes for his daily run. He had to
get in part of the 50 miles he does for
taining for big races.

After all, Nov. 17 isn’t that far off.

 

Editors’ note: Several weeks ago, we
began distributing The Ring-tum Phi at
Southern Seminary Junior College,
which does not have a school news-
paper. In this way, we hope to improve
the bond that ties Washington and Lee
with the surrounding women’s colleges.
For this reason, from time to time, we
will be printing articles such as this that
should be of interest to both Washing-
ton and Lee and Southern Seminary
students.

because of student interest. ‘‘We
have always had an interest in stu-
dents to prepare themselves for a
career in training and raising
horses,”’ he said.

Carter said the present programs
only offer skills in riding. The stu-
dents need business and manage-
ment courses as well as riding
courses to go into the horse field full-
time.

Russ Walther, director of the rid-
ing program, said, ‘‘There is a grow-
ing need in the horse industry for
qualified people. The industry has
grown so rapidly that there are more
jobs offered than can be filled.’’ He
said the new programs will train stu-
dents for those jobs.

Deal Tompkins, director of admis-
sions said this program is one of the
few of its kind to be offered in the
country.

Walther added, “The notoriety
gained through the comprehensive
equine program will bring more and
more students to the school.”

Riding at Southern Seminary is not
restricted to those who major in one
of the three equine programs. Ac-
cording to Tompkins, more than 50
percent of the students are involved
in the riding.

The school offers physical educa-
tion courses in beginning, interme-
diate and advanced riding.

The intercollegiate riding team
also is open to any student in good
academic standing. The riders for
each show are selected by the coach-
es acoording to their current riding
performance.

The indoor arena and stables at
Southern Seminary are almost as im-
pressive as the equine program

The arena is 80 feet wide and 200
feet long with flooring of sand and
sawdust over clay.

The arena also holds the offices of
the director, stable manager and rid-
ing instructors.

As many as 80 spectators can
watch the events from a gallery and
an indoor lounge.

The stables are attached to the
arena and provide 69 stalls, four
wash racks, a veterinary/blacksmith
room, two tack rooms, a feed room
and loft space for more than 2,000
bales of hay.

The stables were built in 1981 to
replace inadequate stalls that had
been there since 1933.

The stalls are open to students who
bring their own horses with them to
school and about half the stables are
occupied by student-owned horses.

According to Tompkins, the stu-
dents’ horses receive stall priority. If
there is not room for both the student
horses and the school-owned horses,
the school keeps its animals outdoors
ina nearby pasture.

School employees take care of
cleaning the stalls everyday and
feeding the horses. Exercising and
grooming are the students’ responsi-
bilities.

According to Lori Goater, a pro-
fessor in the equine program, ‘‘The
purpose of our equine program is to
give the students something market-
able.”’

Last Saturday the Washington and
Lee cross country team topped off its
perfect season by winning the Old
Dominion Athletic conference Cham-
pionships. Washington and Lee won
the meet with 41 points, over Lynch-
burg (52), Hampden-Sydney (74),
Eastern Mennonite (94), last year’s
ODAC Champions Roanoke College
(111) and Bridgewater (152)

The race itself was won by Mark
Granger of Lynchburg in 27:04,
followed by Washington and Lee’s
Eddie Goundry (27:15) and Frank
Pittman just two seconds later
27:17). Hampden-Sydney’s top
finisher was Jay Turner (27:18) with
Roger Ripstein (27:21) of Bridge-
water right behind. In sixth place
was Ted Myers of Washington and
Lee in 27:26. Also placing for the Gen-
erals were Ron Moody (28:00) in 14th
place and David Andrews (28:07) in
16th place

“It was probably Eddie’s best race
ever,” said Coach Miller. ‘‘The meet
itself was about as close as I thought
it would be. It was a good team win.”

While the team became the ODAC
Champion for the second time in
three years, Coach Miller was named
the cross country coach of the year
When asked how it feels to be the
Coach of the Year, Miller replied,

‘When the team wins, I win.”’
then smiled and walked away.

Also honored on Saturday, were
Mark Granger of Lynchburg who
was named Runner of the Year. Ed-

Just when it appeared as though
Samford was about to spoil W&L’s
Parents’ Weekend, as well as claim
its first victory of the season, Chris
Bleggi ignited the Generals by re-
turning the ensuing kickoff 90 yards
for touchdown, cutting the Bulldogs’
lead to 14-7.

W&L pulled to within one point on
its next possession when quarterback

down. Placekicker James White
missed the extra point attempt, leav-

ing Samford with a 14-13 lead.

W&L defensive end Craig West-
brook recovered a fumble at the Bull-
dog’s four yard line on Samford:s
next possession. Two plays later, full-
back Frank Surface scored on a two--

tailback Gene Girard for the two-
point conversion, giving the Generals

John McEnroe
(believe it or not) is

good for the game

....Well, just when you thought he had
decided to clean up his act, Johnny Mac
(rather, Johnny Brat) has done it again.
Frankly, the first thing that strikes me is
that the spectacle witnessed (over and
over again) Sunday in Stockholm was pro-

; Stachura __ ishly and innocently tries to sell us in TV

subscriptions. But at least this is some semblance of proof that the bad boy of*
tennis does have a tolerable side.

Sunday afternoon’s incident, in which said John McEnroe called the chair
umpire a jerk (as in ‘‘Answer my question, jerk!’’), sent a water glass flying
(right past the ear of his opponent Anders Jarryd), smashed a water bottle
(both the aforementioned being done with prodigious swings of his racket),
and rifled a tennis ball (again, with racket) at no one in particular and
everyone in general sitting in the arena, has been called by some the
highwater mark for McEnroe and his outbursts. Indeed, one tennis
magazine, prior to the Stockholm event, had called for McEnroe to be ban-.
ned for a year after his next outburst.

He will not be banned for a year, but that’s not to say he will get off scot
free. A 42-day suspension from participation in Grand Prix events was hand-
ed down Monday by the Men’s International Professional Tennis Council
because Junior exceeded the $7,500 limit in fines for the year. That ‘‘punish-
ment” (read in very loose terms) will be it, for all intents and purposes. Oh,
there is some talk that Mac will be forced out of Davis Cup play in a few
weeks, but it’s safe to assume that’s as likely as me working anywhere other
than Maxway after graduation.

The question of what to do with McEnroe is one that, unfortunately, is all
too specific to the sport of tennis. You cannot compare McEnroe’s situation
with any other in sport. His is not one like a Billy Martin’s. Martin erupts and
is thrown out of the game, and the same should go for McEnroe, some argue.
Well, begging the captain’s pardon, but if McEnroe’s tossed out, the game’s
over. Not so with the removal of Martin, or another player for that matter,
because there is always someone to fill the space vacated and play will go
on. What’s more, Martin and said player will still receive their paychecks.
McEnroe (we'll ignore endorsements and exhibitions for the present time)
won't.

So, we return to what to do with the misbehaving Mac. I say banning him,
from the game for a year is akin to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the
head. They might be able to save you, but here’s a guess that it won’t be
much of a life: Tennis, which for the most part has the general popularity of
Skittle Pool, needs someone with the incredible skill of a McEnroe. In addi-
tion and maybe even more importantly, the game needs McEnroe’s per-
sonality (read: his outbursts and temper tantrums, as well as the nice things
he does are good for the game).

The point is that people, at least in the U.S. (Britons say they can’t tolerate
Superbrat, but something tells me they’re all living vicariously with every
“pits of the world!’’), like to come out and watch McEnroe yell and scream,
and if he happens to play some incredible tennis along the way, all the more
enjoyable.

Diehards, like myself, who still believe in that nonsense about sports-
manship and the gentlemen’s game, may find all this a bit hard to take. Isn’t
there something that can be done, we ask. Unfortunately, I think we are fac-
ed with the lonely prospect of hoping McEnroe behaves. Sure, let’s try to en-
force the Code of Conduct rules on Mac just like we do for everybody else. To
do anything else not only would fly in the face of reason, but also most likely
would do irreparable damage to the appeal of the game by taking away its
lifeblood...

....Whew...On to the Colonnade, where we find a deserving ODAC cham-
pionship team. A major tip of the hat goes to Coach-of-the-Year Dick Miller
and his harriers on their second conference crown in three years. This was
certainly a deserving group, and here’s a wish for more good things this
weekend in Sewanee as they look for another deserved honor, a team bid to
nationals...Glad to see the gridders shake off that 14-point deficit (read:
fluke) and come storming back. Saturday should prove to be the record-
breaker...Polo needed a miracle to upset Richmond at league champion-
ships Sunday. They didn’t get it, but that certainly doesn’t take anything
away from this group in my book. A team without the horses of previous
years, but definitely not short on any other qualities. Special commendation ] -
to Bobby Pearson on his earning 100 victories as a W&L polo player...Early .
winter word to the wise: Captain and 1983-84 Mr. Invincible Jeff Dixon won
his weight class at a preseason gig in Madison. Other General grapplers
represented themselves well, too. Hint: W&L wrestlers look strong again...
...Other news from the front: Our new man in the baseball front office, Peter
“L.A. is my lady’”’ Ueberroth is talking of fiddling with the DH rule. See,
Pete’s planning on surveying Mr. and Mrs. Baseball Fan on the DH and
making or not making some changes based on that survey. Personal to Pete:
You don’t have to do anything grandiose (read: louse something up) to prove
you're doing your job. Don’t make your L.A. (Profit City) Olympics look like
beginners’ luck....

.... Finally, looking to the south of us, I believe there may be the same type
of rumblings I heard last year about a red hot team that nobody thought
would do as well as it’s doing. Let’s just say, South Carolina-Nebraska in the
Orange Bowl for the national championship. Hint: If given the chance,
lightning (bedecked in maroon, black and white) will strike twice....

The Washington and Lee wrestling
Generals will be deep, flexible and,
above all, winners in the 1984-85
season.

‘‘We have a lot of good wrestlers in
our program and quite a few of them
will have good people at every weight
class and should have a chance at
another fine season,’’ head coach
Gary Franke said.

W&L’s 10 lettermen from last
year’s 12-2 team will compete with a
host of newcomers for starting jobs.
At 118 lbs. it appears that two
freshmen, Dave Cox and Steve Cas-
tle, will be the wrestlers to watch.
Junior Brian Lifsted, who posted a
combined 12-5 record at 118 and 126
last year, will likely get the nod at 126

  

lbs. Sophomore Jeff Mazza, who was
13-7 at 126 last year, will likely move
up to wrestle at 134 lbs. for this
season. At 142 lbs., junior Larry
Anker, who posted a 14-5 mark a year
ago, will be back to defend his start-
ing job. Sophomore Tim Walker, a
starter last year with an 8-12 record,

also will return to handle the duties ‘ '

at the 150 lb. weight division.

At 158 Ibs., freshman Kevin
McNamara has a good chance to
start, and at 167 lbs., junior Win
Phillips appears to have the
preseason advantage. The 177 lb.
weight division seems to be a toss-up
between seniors Joe O'Neill, who was
114 last year, and Greg Kendrick.
Senior Jeff Dixon, an undefeated
(19-0) performer last season, will be
the Generals’ man at 190 Ibs. At
heavyweight, senior Mark Weaver,
who has not wrestled at W&L prior to
this year, looks like the preseason
favorite.

‘Our preseason lineup is not cut in
stone,’ Franke said. ‘“‘We haven't
had wrestle-offs, so things could
change. But I do expect that most
wrestlers on the team will be asked to
contribute. We have quite a few
triangular and quadrangular meets
scheduled, so we will have to rely on

touchdowns, including three on kick-
off returns, were recorded during the
first quarter alone.

.The Generals added two touch-
downs in the second quarter to take a
35-21 halftime lead. The first of these
seores came when slotback Tom Wi-
ser ran 35 yards on a misdirection
play for a touchdown. White added
the extra point, giving the Generals a
28-21 lead with 8:41 remaining in the
half. Thornton passed for his second
touchdown of the game about six
minutes later, hitting split end Hugh
Finkeistein for a 17-yard score.

- The second half was somewhat cal-
mer than the first as W&L scored

twice before allowing the Bulldogs to
score late in the game. Thornton
passed 53 yards to Bleggi for a touch-
down in the third quarter, making the
score 42-21.

Girard finished the scoring for the
Generals early in the fourth quarter
with a three-yard touchdown run.
After White kicked his fifth extra
point of the game, the Generals hada
49-21 lead with 14:54 remaining in the
game.

Samford scored a meaningless
touchdown during the final two min-
utes when reserve quarterback Scot-
ty King passed 27 yards to Gerald
Neaves, making the final score 49-28.

Thornton completed seven of 11
passes for 113 yards and three touch-
downs. Girard rushed for 113 yards
on 15 carries and scored once. Danny

Jayne carried 12 times for 68 yards,
and Surface had 54 yards on eight
carries. The Generals ran up 404
yards of total offense and had 23 first
downs against the Bulldogs.

“I was impressed with the way we
did not panic and kept our poise,”
head coach Gary Fallon said. ‘‘After
getting behind in the first quarter, we
could have cashed it in, but we fought
back.”’

The Generals (5-4) go after their
fifth consecutive winning season Sat-
urday when they play Lebanon Val-
ley College (1-8) in Annville, Pa.
W&L has not had five consecutive
winning seasons since it put together

Soccer ends '84
with win at VMI

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee soccer
team lost 3-0 at the hands of Radford
last Saturday but finished off its
season with a 3-1 victory over VMI
Tuesday afternoon at VMI.

The Radford squad was a “‘pretty
good team,”’ said head coach Rolf
Piranian. ‘‘They were a lot quicker
than we were, and we were just aw-
fully flat.”’

Radford scored twice in the first
half and gained a third goal off a mis-
take by a W&L player. ‘Each was a
major mistake by a member of our
team,’’ Piranian said. ‘‘Clearly, the
better team won.”’

Discussing the victory over VMI,

Piranian said, ‘‘We made the most of
our opportunities. The game was a
lot tighter than 3-1 leads you to
believe.”’

The Generals closed out their sea-
son with a record of six wins and
eight losses.

Evaluating the season, Piranian
Said, “We never quite got things
together the way we should have. The
season had some disappointments,
but they hung in there tough.”

Piranian named Gary Clements,
Rob Coleman, Jay Werner, Todd
Herman, Jeff Reichert and Mark Sul-
livan as six seniors who will be sorely
missed next year.

Talking about next year, Piranian
said, ‘Back to the drawing board. We
will have to do some things different-
ly.”

 

Wrestling

W&L will compete in two of its own
invitational meets, which will include
eight teams, three quadrangular
meets, and two triangular competi-
tions.

“The Washington and Lee Invita-
tional (Dec. 1) will tell us a lot about
our abilities and capabilities. The op-
position should be formidable and
will provide a good test for our team.
Our dual meets with Hampden-
Sydney (Nov. 28) and Lynchburg
(Dec. 5) should also be good in-
dicators,”’ Franke said.

The Generals got an early indica-
tion of how good they may be in spots
over the weekend at the James
Madison Takedown Tournament.
The General wrestlers participating
in the event were led by Jeff Dixon,
who won his weight class. A fine per-

formance was also turned in by
Larry Anker, who finished third in
the tournament.

After the Dec. 6 clash against
Lynchburg, the rest of the Generals’
schedule shapes up like this: The
team will take a little over a month
off between competitions, not resum-
ing action again until Jan. 12, when
they will travel to the Hampden-
Sydney Quadrangular. A week later
the Genrals host a quad and four

days after that they are scheduled to
participate in the Virginia State
Triangular. Other meets of note in-
clude a quad at Lynchburg, a
triangular meet at LaSalle in
Philadelphia and the eight-team
W&L College Invitational.

The Generals will be pointing
toward the NCAA Eastern Regionals
to be held at Trenton State in the mid-
dle of February and the NCAA Divi-
sion III National Tournament, slated
for two weeks after the regionals.

win their fourth consecutive
Southern League Championship,
they did earn a berth in the Eastern
Championships at West Point this
weekend.

The Generals (18-12-1) did pick up
four wins before bowing to the
Spiders in the finals. W&L collected
victories against South Carolina,
14-11, George Washington, 12-3, UNC-
Wilmington, 12-8, and U.Va., 15-6.

Concerning the loss to Richmond,
Remillard said that he had made two
major coaching mistakes. “I had a
bad game,”’ he said. Remillard add-
ed that he had called for a wrong
defensive strategy that allowed Rich-
mond to score with less than 10
seconds left in the first half. He also
said that he let Tim Stanford play in
the second quarter, despite his being
ejected from the game twice. Stan-
ford picked up his third ejection in
the second quarter and the All-
American could not play for the rest
of the game.

Remillard said, “‘The loss was
disappointing but I’m not totally
discouraged with what happened.”
He asserted that his team played
their best water polo of the season
last weekend.

This weekend the Generals are

seeded eighth in a field of eight teams
at the Eastern Championships at
West Point. The championships
begin Saturday and continue through
Sunday.

W&L opens the tournament against
Brown, the number one seeded team
in the East. Remillard stated that
Brown is much superior to the 1984
Generals and that he and his team
were working on a game plan that
will be effective against the team
that they will play if they lose to
Brown. Should the Generals lose in
the first round this weekend, they
will play the loser of the Richmond
vs. Iona game. Remillard already
knows about Richmond by virtue of
being in the same conference. He has
spent most of the earlier part of the
week learning about the Iona team.

W&L and Iona have played com-
mon opponents this season. Both
teams have faced Army and Slippery
Rock. The Generals lost both games,
while Iona won both games. Regard-
less, Remillard said that his players
possess a very positive attitude con-
cerning this weekend's competition.
Remillard said, ‘‘This is not a quit-
ting group. They are making every
commitment to get better.”’

EC warned of wary

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A group of Law School students
told EC members Sam Dalton, An-
drew Caruthers and Michael Black
that the EC would have to make a
special effort next year to make
female undergraduates comfortable
with a male-dominated honor sys-
tem.

Four law students and members of
the Student Organization Subcom-
mittee of the Coeducation Steering
Committee agreed Tuesday night
that the EC should ensure that
women undergraduates understand
the honor system, have some input
into the system and do not perceive
the system as being biased against
them.

“Even though we didn’t finally
decide anything, it kind of sowed the
field in people’s minds. These things
need to be discussed,’’ said Black,
the chairman of the Student Organi-
zation Subcommittee and a junior re-
presentative to the Executive
Committee.

The EC will “‘have to go out of its
way” to take women’s opinions into
account until there are women in all

four classes and women on the EC,
Black said.

Both law students and faculty
members told the EC members that,
with the wide discretion the EC
possesses in the prosecution of honor
violations, women might perceive
the conviction of a woman as a result
of bias.

Some students pointed out that pro-
blems could arise due to the fact that
men and women might disagree
about what constitutes a dishon-
orable action in addition to the tradi-
tional definition of lying, cheating
and stealing. Caruthers noted that
the EC traditionally has not con-
sidered stealing a road sign an honor
offense if it was done as a prank
because ‘boys will be boys.” Of-
fenses of that nature are turned over
to the Student Control Committee,
Caruthers said.

Several women at the meeting
questioned whether an all-male EC
would be able to apply the similar
test of “girls will be girls’ to a
female undergraduate charged with
an honor violation outside the defini-
tion of lying, cheating and stealing.

Professors James M. Phemister
and Jean C. Dunbar suggested that
when a female student is charged

Computers come to campus

By PEDRO CARROLL
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee students long have been
known for bringing such possessions as stereos,
refrigerators and BMWs with them to campus.

But this year, students are beginning to bring
something else with them — computers.

Some students who have added computers to
the posters, books and empty bottles in their dor-
mitory rooms say the computers are valuable ina
variety of ways, in addition to the obvious aca-
demic benefits.

“I’m just a good old Southern boy who doesn’t
want to do any work,’’ said Barney Robinson, a
freshman politics major. ‘‘That’s the reason for
technology, to give man time to pursue other acti-
vities.”’

Robinson, who said he uses his computer pri-
marily for word processing, added that he does
not consider himself to be a ‘‘computer whiz kid.”
He has a working knowledge in BASIC, a
programming language, and is taking a compu-
ter science course here.

Describing his Apple Macintosh as ‘‘just a con-
venience, just like a big calculator.’’ Robinson
said that having a computer reduces the amount
of time he spends on some subjects.

Professor Theodore Sjoerdsma, the chairman
of the new computer science department, said,
‘‘A personal computer will obviously help them
overcome the stages of fright. It’ll help students
to understand a computer system and that they
are in control of the machine.”’

Having a computer is viewed as both an aca-
demic and a social tool by freshman Brad Shaw, a
journalism major. “We're finding more people
Standing in line to play the games,” he said, “and
the girls still love the biorhythm program.”’

Shaw, who had some previous experience with
computers in high school, said the capabilities
and potential of computers intrigue him.

“A computer opens the door to the space age,”’
he explained. ‘‘I like it because it’s visual. I look
at the computer as something mysterious.”

The academic benefits were the deciding factor
when sophomore Matt Lewis, an English major,
bought his computer.

“Originally,’’ he said, ‘‘I bought it for word pro-
cessing. I decided upon Apple Macintosh because
it has good word processing and graphics. It, al-
so, doesn’t require computer knowledge.”’

Although he learned some computer program-
ming in junior high and high school, Lewis said he
still considers himself an amateur. He does not
have any game programs and said he uses his
computer primarily for studying.

Acknowledging that computers are conveni-
ences, he added that he believes students still
have to work.

“There’s a big danger with computers. Sure,
it’s convenient to have a computer, but it’s a
mistake to say that the computer will do all the
work. You have to edit and correct grammatical
mistakes,”’ he said. ‘‘It’s just an emotional tool,
later a business tool. Computers have no social
attraction “

Because students who have personal compu-
ters use those instead of the campus computer
system, Sjoerdsma said, the personal computers
help keep the campus system from becoming ov-
erloaded. He encouraged students to obtain a per-
sonal computer to ‘‘become familiar with some
systems.”

Students who have personal computers and
want to connect them with the main campus com-
puter must complete an application in the com-
puter center in order to obtain a user number.
Once a student has a user number, he remains on
the system until he graduates.

A telephone and an RS232 interface are necess-
ary to connect personal computers with the cam-*
pus system. “The type of computer doesn’t mat-
ter as long as they have the right interface,” said
Ruth Floyd, coordinator of academic computer
applications.

coeds

with an offense in one of these grey
areas of the honor system, the EC
should seek the advice of other
women in the student body to deter-
mine if such an action should be con-
sidered dishonorable.

Dunbar said that although the EC
would be under no obligation to ac-
cept the advice of such a group, if
both the women consulted and the EC
agreed that the offense was dishonor-
able, the EC could be certain its ver-
dict was fair.

Black said he thought this idea of
asking women’s advice as to whether
an action was dishonorable during
the investigation of a possible honor
violation was a good one. He added
that the EC always tries to consider
such things as classroom atmosphere
and other relevant factors during the
investigation of a possible honor of-
fense.

Black noted that the EC might be
able to implement the advisory idea
by having a woman on the three-
member EC investigating team that
looks into possible honor violations.
Two of the members of the investiga-
ting team are EC members, but the
third member is a student selected
from the same school as the accused,
Black explained.

Audience rants as debate rages

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

On the eve of the 1984 election,
members of the W&L forensics team
gathered for a confrontation Monday
night in Northen Auditorium to
debate the resolution: America
needs Ronald Reagan.

The relatively sparse crowd was
asked to sit on the right side if they
were pro-Reagan and to sit on the left
if they opposed Reagan.

The ‘“‘Bad Guys” who were oppos-
ing the resolution, Rick Graves and
Rob Gresham, continually argued
that Reagan’s policies ‘‘could not be
pinned down,” and that his “‘vague-
ness and simplicity are reasons that
he is so popular in the polls.’

The “Good Guys,’’ John Starks and
Mike Herring, cited statistics related
to the deficit and military strength as
reasons supporting America’s need

Former student indicted for forgery :

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

William Addison Vaughan Jr., a
Washington and Lee senior last year,
was indicted Monday by the Lex-
ington and Rockbridge Grand Jury
on four charges of check forging.

The grand jury charged that
Vaughan forged two checks dated
May 24 and 30 and totalling $2,300 on
the account of James Edward Abbe
IV, a classmate of Vaughan’s.

Vaughan, who had fulfilled his
degree requirements at the end of
last year and who hasn’t returned to
school this year, is having his diplo-
ma withheld until after his trial in

for Reagan. Herring noted the in-
creased ‘‘confidence that Reagan
brings to the White House,” and fur-
ther commented that America’s self-
respect has increased in the past four
years.

In the British Parliamentary style
of debate, the crowd members were
encouraged to voice their opinions,
and they repeatedly took part in the
discussion.

When Stark was listing the addition
in the U.S. weapons systems, from
the opposition’s side came the chant,
“Kill, Kill, Kill!” A member of the
pro-Reagan camp quickly retorted,
“They save your life, sucker!”’

Herring also drew crowd partici-
pation when he said the debt was
declining under Reagan. Again a
crowd member responded with

“What? Is Nancy buying all her
stuff at Sears?”

A vote was held at the end of the

Rockbridge County Circuit Court on
the four felony charges.

Also Monday, the owner of the
Rockbridge Video Tape center was
indicted on a charge of possession
with intent to distribute pornograph-
ic videotapes.

The grand jury, which indicted
eight other people on various counts
in its last of four meetings this year,
charged Wayne Douglas Butler with
possession of the tapes and his em-
ployee, Pat Mace, with the actual
renting of the tapes. Both of the
charges are misdemeanors.

Butler said this week that by rent-
ing the tapes he was ‘‘defending the
right of free choice.”

debate, another characteristic of
British Parliamentary procedure, to
determine the crowd’s feeling about
the proposition — Britain’s method of
determining the victor. Fifteen voted
affirmatively that America needs
Ronald Reagan. Ten people voted
negatively on this resolution, and
among them were students who had
earlier indicated that they were pro-
Reagan by sitting in the designated
area.

Public Speaking Professor Halford
Ryan chaired the debate and was in
charge of crowd control.

The W&L debate team recently
began experimenting with the new
form of intercollegiate debating, in
which the toughest opposition often
comes from the audience.

Last month W&L debaters toured ‘

four colleges where they engaged in
the audience-style debating on topics
ranging from the re-election of Presi-
dent Reagan to coeducation.

“T feel that I am not breaking any
law,” Butler added.

He said he did not advertise or dis-
play the tapes in question, he made
the customers renting the tapes sign
a form saying they would not show
the tapes to minors and he required
that renters of the tapes be at least
21.

He added that as Mace’s employer,
he would be responsible for the
charges brought against Mace.

The grand jury also indicted two
men on drug charges: Joseph Fran-
cis Link on a charge of oonspiring to
sell cocaine, and Kelly Ross Miller on
a charge of manufacturing mariju-
ana.

an alleged honor offense while he was
at VMI;....nothing of that conversa-
tion involved drugs; nothing of that
brief conference was revealed to the

“The defendant was implicated by
numerous cadets who testified before
the Special Grand Jury that he was a
drug dealer,’’ the response adds.

The Spencer motion describes
what Walrod said is his case: “A
friend of Jeffrey Pack’s had earlier
employed the prosecutor in his ca-
pacity as a private attorney to repre-
sent the friend in a civil matter unre-
lated to the subject matter under in-
vestigation by the Special Grand
Jury. The prosecutor accepted em-
ployment by this client on the condi-
tion that the client agree to submit to
hypnosis.”’

Walrod said he hired Read to de-
fend him in a VMI honor case in
which Walrod was accused of receiv-
ing unacknowledged assistance on an
engineering homework paper. He
said that under hypnosis, he discuss-
ed his drug habits and those of a num-
ber of other VMI cadets. He then
withdrew from VMI on Read’s ad-
vice.

“Mr. Read was in a client-lawyer
relationship and took the information
and followed up on in in the special
grand jury,”’ Walrod said by tele-
phone from his home in Brentwood,
Tenn.

‘“‘My main goal is to help Jeff Pack
and not to necessarily hurt John
Read.’”’ He said that Spencer and
Pack were ‘‘definitely anti-John
Read for sure.”’

While many Washington and Lee
students spent last weekend braving
the wildlife of Fall Weekend at Hol-
lins and Sweet Briar, 72 W&L ROTC
students were braving the wilds of
the George Washington National
Forest.

The reason for this foray into the
wilderness was the military science
department’s fall semester Field
Training Exercise (FTX). The FTX
began Friday afternoon and lasted
overnight until Saturday afternoon.

Of the 72 cadets participating in the
operation, 49 were on the defensive
with the ROTC battalion. The re-
maining 23 were members of the
W&L Ranger Company and acted as
the aggressor forces during the exer-
cise.

The W&L Ranger Company is a
voluntary extra-curricular activity
of the military science department
designed to provide ROTC students
with additional training and chal-
lenges to prepare them for their ex-
periences in the Army.

 

 

ows

The scenario for the FTX was this:

The battalion was to establish a de-
fensive perimeter around its camp-
site and protect it from any enemy
attack. The Ranger Company’s job
was to assault the position and take
the campsite.

The battalion was dug in securely
to its position by 7 p.m. and waited
for the Rangers to move in on the pos-
ition. Things were relatively quiet
until about 9:30, when the Rangers
made their assault.

The entire assault was over in a
matter of minutes, and when the
smoke had cleared the battalion re-
grouped from the attack of the Ran-
gers. It would be fair to say that both
sides could claim a victory for the
evening. The Rangers were success-
ful in overrunning the defensive posi-
tion of the battalion, but the battalion
was able to repel the force back into
the woods

The Ranger’s assault of the battal-
lion’s defensive position was the only
activity Friday night. But Saturday
morning started bright and early
with breakfast and for the breaking
down of camp.

The first part of the morning was
taken up with classes conducted by
the seniors. These classes covered a

Two Washington and Lee alumni
who were classmates have been
elected to six-year terms on the
Board of Trustees, the University an-
nounced this week.

Beverly M. ‘“‘Bo’’ DuBose III of
Atlanta and W. Hayne Hipp of Green-
ville, S.C., were elected at the
board’s October meeting. Their
terms begin Jan. 1.

Both DuBose and Hipp graduated
from Washington and Lee in 1962.

They fill the spots left by the
retirements from the board of T. Hal
Clarke of Atlanta, H. Gordon Leggett
Jr. of Lynchburg and James A. Phil-
pott of Lexington, N.C.

Hipp, who received his bachelor of
arts degree in English from W&L,
said he was surprised by his election.
“T did not know I was being nomi-
nated,”’ he said. ‘‘I had no idea that I
was actively being considered as a

“It’s certainly one of the biggest
honors I’ve ever had. I was a little
overwhelmed by it,’’ added Hipp,
whose wife, Anna Kate, is a trustee of
her alma mater, Mary Baldwin Col-
lege.

From his wife’s experiences there,
Hipp said, he recognizes the two ma-
jor functions of any board of trustees
— fund-raising and choosing a presi-
dent (Mary Baldwin’s president re-
signed last month).

At this point, though, he added,
W&L is facing neither problem.

Among issues facing the trustees
are the transition to coeducation and
the reaction to the change among stu-
dent, faculty and alumni and “how
the (new) student center will assimi-
late into the fraternity system,”’ said
Hipp, who is president of Liberty
Corp., a conglomerate whose hold-
ings include a life insurance firm.

variety of subjects, including in-
dividual tactical training, squad
movement techniques and the rules
governing the treatment of prisoners
of war.

After these classes, the students in
the battalion got an opportunity to
put their newly acquired skills to the
test. Each of the three squads con-
ducted a reconnaissance patrol of the
Ranger camp and reported back to
the cadet chain of command.

After the reconnaissance patrols,
the cadets packed up their gear and
returned to Lexington. After return-
ing their equipment to the supply
room, the cadets’ last task was clean-
ing their weapons.

The FTX was viewed a complete
success. Capt. Robert R. Ripple, bat-
talion operation officer, said it was
an exceptional exercise. ‘‘The first
night went real well,” he added.
“The Rangers did a good job charg-
ing down the hill.”’

Senior Greg Lukanuski, cadet com-
mander of the ROTC battalion, said
he was initially a little worried but
was pleased with the outcome.
“When the time came, everyone

W. HAYNE HIPP
.. new W&L trustee

Hipp, who earned his master’s
degree in business administration
from the Wharton Graduate School of
Business at the University of Penn-
sylvania, said he favors coeduca-
tion. :

A member of Phi Delta Theta at
W&L, Hipp said, ‘‘As a former stu-
dent or alumnus, you always hope
that someday you will have the
chance to give back to W&L what you
took from it.”

Hipp first joined Liberty Life In-
surance in 1969 and, in 1978, became
chief executive officer of the Liberty
Corp., which is the parent organiza-
tion of Liberty Life and Cosmos
Broadcasting and has operating units
in 41 states. He began his profession-
al career with Metropolitan Life In-
surance in San Francisco in 1965.

He also is a member of the South

DuBose, who received his bachelor
of science degree in commerce from
W&L, said he would like to regard
himself as a ‘‘grassroots trustee.”’

“The most gratifying thing of this
to me is I think I have been chosen as
a result of having been active on the

indication that the trustees are

OPINION

 

Where’s the book?

Last week we made a disillusioning discovery. On the eve
of the election, someone had stolen the Election Preview and
other recent issues of Congressional Quarterly from the
University Library. Further research showed that a major
article about political polls had been torn out — ripped off, if
you will — of one of the newsmagazines.

This was more than annoying, but we figured it was an
anomyly that doesn’t happen but once in a student genera-
tion. Think again. The librarians don’t seem the least bit sur-
prised when notified that materials are missing. An inven-
tory was taken this summer, and in the last four years, 1,200
books have ‘‘walked out”’ of the library. That’s more than one
a day while school is in session.

There’s a great invention called a photocopy machine.
There are two of them in the library, and they prevent the
need to purloin periodicals. If the tfuth were known, we’d
rather have people stealing dimes than filching reference
materials. At least you can get more dimes.

There’s one consolation for all of us who’ve gone to the
library absolutely, positively needing something, and finding
it missing — God will get you if the EC doesn’t.

Killing ourselves

Last Tuesday, scattered among the election predictions in
the Metro section of The Washington Post, was the tragic
story of Douglas Ealey II, a high school senior in Prince
George’s County, Md., who committed suicide.

It was not a regular news story. There was something more
unnatural than suicide about this particular case. The victim
was a student leader, elected by his peers to represent them
as the only student on the county board of education. He had
fine grades, a happy home life (by his mother’s account; his
father died in the Vietnam War) and an active social life and
was looking forward to applying to prestigious colleges that
had carefully courted him during the summer. Everything
seemed to be coming up roses.

But something obviously wasn’t. For at 9 a.m. on Monday,
Nov. 5, Ealey pulled the trigger of a 20-gauge shotgun with
the barrel pointed at his chest.

But Ealey’s case was not the first teen-age suicide this
year. Nationally, there have been over 4,800 documented sui-
cides among the 13-18 age group this year; last year’s total
was 5,200 deaths. Government experts believe those numbers
discount the real rise in deaths because many suicides are
recorded as accidents, In the past 25 years alone, suicides in
the 13-25 age group have tripled.

Why are we students seeing our ranks thinned so slowly
and surely?

Some cite the cost factor. A college education today totals a
modest $40,000 at most private institutions, and at least half
that at most public schools. As reflected in the recent elec-
tions, students are optimistic about their futures, yet a dis-
mal grade in the interim seems to cloud that sunny view.
Some psychologists say a perceived increase in parental ex-
pectations by students has made many fearful of failure. And
inevitably, increased academic competition among students
has created an air of anxiety unparalleled on most campuses.
The ‘‘whatcha get?’’ syndrome has become more than a
friendly inquiry into your neighbor’s competence or lack
thereof. Letter grades, we are told, spell success.

Tragic seems to come short of aptly describing the situa-
tion, however. As students, we may be fiercely competitive,
but in being such we lose sight of the real value of our educa-
tion. For us, as it has been for all generations, the value of
education is not merely our standing relative to others, but
our standing relative to ourselves. We are challenging our-
selves, our minds, our endurance to learn more, faster and
better than ever before. We struggle more against ourselves
in the true sense of education than against our peers. But
somewhere along the line, we have lost sight of that valuable
insight into education. We have begun — and continue— to
think that our worth is not so much in and of ourselves as it is
in and of our grades, those letters we so hate that get us into
jobs or graduate programs.

Blame cannot be easily shifted anywhere for this dilemma.
Shortfalls abound. The easy target, the undefinable ‘‘socie-
ty,’ seems somehow inadequate in this case. But we must get
away from the idea of assigning blame and believing the pro-
blem will vanish. The resolution to the rapid increase is not
easily determined, but a start can be made. We, as students,
must begin to realize that our education is the training of our
minds, and not merely a tool which we use to gain short-lived
academic superiority in the classroom. We need to recognize
that life exists beyond college and that academic mistakes to-
day will most likely have a negligible influence on our
lifestyle ten years from now. A ‘‘C” today does not spell an
“‘F”’ for our future. We should begin to see that the most im-
portant lesson we can learn from our college days is not just
how well we did on a paper, but how well we fared against
ourselves. The race, they say, is not always to the swiftest
but to those who keep on running.

Big bucks buy more than votes.

MY VIEW

By John Winters

 

It’s been more than a week since
the election; the glitter, hoopla, sor-
row and grief are beginning to fade.
While janitors clean up the mess
from victory parties, ‘‘wait till next
time”’ parties and the plain old “‘let’s
party because it’s an election’”’ par-
ties, a time of reflection seems in
order.

What occurred in the presidential
election will politely be called a de-
feat. Being more realistic, somehow
the word “‘annihilation’’ seems more
appropriate. Let’s face it, losing 49
out of 50 states doesn’t exactly fall
within the ‘‘well, we gave it our best
shot’’ category.

Dismissal
‘buggeth’

SABU VP

Tothe Editors:

I have been at W&L four years now
and have not written The Phi until
now. But the issue of Dean John L.
White’s dismissal “‘buggeth me.”
Just some questions to whom it may
concern: If he indeed misapproprited
funds (a nice way to say embezzle-
ment) in past years, why hasn’t our
diligent Executive Committee charg-
ed the third-year law student with an
honor code violation; Why will Presi-
dent Wilson, after accusing him of
fiscal irresponsibility, wish him well
in a legal career (one bound to in-
volve. monetary endeavors), hand
him a degree personally next May
and pay him until June? Either the
man is guilty or not. Hypocrisy is not
supposed to be the foundation of a
gentlemanly collegiate atmosphere,
is it? Maybe it was the spring honor
trial. Nah, they let you exhibit emo-

. tion around here when a student’s fu-

ture is being altered. I’m a student
meddling in administrative affairs,
huh? Funny, I thought the faculty
was here for the student body. Re-
sentment is surfacing, better stop
this letter. Now I realize my objec-
tive credibility is destroyed by sign-
ing this letter, but I'll sign. Boy,
something ‘‘smelleth.”

Kim S. Brunson

Vice President,
Student Association for Black Unity

YD’s gain
praise for
work, help

Tothe Editors:

I would appreciate your letting me
use this means of thanking the Young
Democrats of Washington and Lee
for their help to the three local
Democratic committees in the recent
campaign. They gave time, money,
ideas and inspiration. A number of
students participated in various
ways. Two, in particular, (Everett
Hamilton and David Hanna) need to
be singled out as having participated
in every way possible — from helping
to clean and decorate our headquar-
ters, manning the Buena Vista phone
bank, attending and contributing to
our fund raiser events, spending long
hours ‘‘keeping the store open’ at
headquarters, to showing up to swell
the ranks of well-wishers whenever a
candidate came to town.

We greatly appreciated everyone’s
help and look forward, with pleasure,
to student interest and participation
in future political efforts.

We also appreciated the coverage
of our political news and events by
The Ring-tum Phi and T.V. station
WLUR. Both added a dash of excite-
ment and fun, which few other towns
our size canclaim. We thank you.

Polly Turner, chair
Lexington Democratic Committee

Yet what concerns me the most
was the incredible amount spent on
the presidential election. No one
knows exactly how much was spent
by the two parties in an attempt to
get their presidential candidates in
office. Those figures won't be out for
a while but, rest assured, part of your
tax dollars will cover them.

What we do know is that a 30-sec-
ond paid political campaign ad cost
$120,000. For those of you without
calculators handy, that comes out to
roughly $6,000 per second. That
struck meas rather interesting, and I
thought of how else that money could
be spent.

Just think, with one second, instead
of saying ‘‘vote for me,”’ you could
buy a nice domestic car, or one of
those new coffee pots the Air Force is
pushing for Christmas this year. Or

 

take about five seconds and you could
buy the top-of-the-line BMW and
start getting into those other imports
such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche
and, dare we say, Ferrari.

Or let’s say you’re interested in
your children’s future (looking
ahead, that is). Instead of taking two
aspirin when you start thinking about
tuition bills, take two seconds and
send them to Princeton for a year,
and have about $2,000 left over for
spending money.

Or, if you’re more interested in
playing, a mere second will get you a
catamaran, in fact, two cats with a
windsurfer thrown in. Or splurge: in
10 seconds you could buy a ski boat,
his/her fishing boats and a dock to
put them in.

One Mondale ad had Crosby, Stills
and Nash singing ‘‘Teach Your Chil-
dren,”’ for $6,000 a second that’s one

 

heck of an education. And who can

forget the Republican ad that spent

$120,000: trying to figure out if there
was a bear in the woods, and at the
end of the ad you still don’t know.

Sally Struthers asks for $18 a
month in her ‘Save the Children’’
crusade to feed and clothe a child.
Taking that into consideration, about
10 ads would feed and clothe all the
children of India.

Makes you stop and wonder just
what our tax money is being spent on,
and I didn’t even go into the expenses
for the personal staffs, car rentals,
hotel reservations, food, plane fares,
security, mailing costs and all the
other miscellaneous bills that occur
during elections.

I don’t even want to go into what
could have been done with those five-
and 10-minute spots just before the
election, but think about it.

The days of our lives?

 

MY
VIEW

By Al
Roberts

 

 

 

 

 

The mood was festive at an area
women’s college Saturday night dur-
ing the semi-formal dance that
headlines its annual fall weekend.

Some hopeful social activists had
bedecked the tables in the ballroom
with streamers, champagne glasses
and party hats.

A pseudo-swing band bounced from
classic shag rags to modern grooves
such as the Men Without Hats ‘‘Safe-
ty Dance.”’ (I had donned a party hat
and idly snapped the elastic band un-
til that number.) ‘New Year’s Eve in
November” was emblazoned on the
red grain cups, but this astute jour-
nalist was not to be fooled: I knew it
was not Dec. 31

Surrounded by current partners-in-
crime and some W&L alumni I had
endured some years with, however, I
could not ask for a better approxima-
tion of New Year’s Eve. But I
couldn’t escape the gnawing emp-
tiness that pervades many social
events among our little constellation
of single-sex colleges.

It was not New Year’s Eve, no mat-
ter how fervently we danced, as if to
ring out the old days and rage in the
new.

When we broke sweating from the
floor, beer (not champagne) was the
beverage of necessity, thanks to the
ABC. And just as we began to lose
ourselves in the moment, we were
reminded time and again of our

realities
ay

the Hill came stumbling by with ex-
travagant salutations and a simple
remark: ‘‘Where's your date?”’

‘‘Well, a handful of them invited a
handful of us,’’ we demurred.

Too many times we saw boredom
allayed only by liquor in couple’s
eyes. ‘Well, we showed up,’’ they
may have thought.

Too many times we saw careening
drunks spill beer on grandmothers’
gowns, too many songs went unsung.

Perhaps the restraint and excess
spring from a common cause — the
gnawing things — the little voice in-
side our heads that says: ‘‘Go for it
now. Don’t stop to talk. You won’t be
together tomorrow.”

This was the voice that pressed us
to the apartments when the band had
played its last. There, about 25 of us
— women and men, girls and boys —
performed the rites of New Year’s
Eve. Arm on arm, we sang the songs
we knew through high school. ‘‘Bye,
bye, Miss American Pie,”’ we croon-
ed, ‘‘the day the music died.’’ Some
of us hustled for mates, and some
just rapped the fat. Some of us got
drunk and puked, and some stayed
sober to make breakfast in the dawn.

But all of us slept in our separate
beds Sunday night (Well, most of us).
Most of us know that Sunday night
malaise. Most of us have felt like we
have failed from time to time, like we
should have struck up one talk more,
like we missed a chance.

This is the price we pay for our big
Tradition and our sense of place. We
are torn on Sunday nights, right
through the week, and in the shadows
and puddles of our noisy nights.

We are shredded by two desires.
We sometimes want our colleges to
be as one, as high school, where
lunches were shaTed and grades con-
tested. Many of us have never had
such luxury, stored away with our
separate sexes since puberty. At

rer hands we want

only to stifle this need, so we can
fulfill the expectation of past genera-

tions that ‘‘these are the days of our -

lives.”’

But should we let our youth be |

spent in another person’s idea of fun?

We are constantly bouncing, like so

many rising moons and suns, be-

tween blind revelry and courtly con- .

ventions. And tossed this way, isn’t it
always the middle ground that we
find most natural?

Some friends and I agree that _

years from now our fondest mem-

ories of this place will be those |

weekends truest to ourselves: that
day we packed some munchies and
motored to the Parkway, the night
we sat waiting for ghosts in the
Hollins graveyard .. . the concert in
Richmond.

One need only look to her elders
some vacation night to know that
cocktail parties don’t stop with the
earning of degreees. One need only
step into a local bar to know that he
will have many years to fall into
stupor.

There is life after the single-sex
college experience, and there will be
time for these things.

But never again will we have the
chance to see our peers changing
their minds in time with us. Never
again will we share the common bond
of maturation, of figuring this life
out.

We should not waste these four
fleeting years trying to be something
we are not, dressing like our elders or
thinking like our parents. If we start
with ourselves and arrive at our
roots, we can claim them for our
own. But to try to make it tomorrow,
New Year’s Eve, when it is not, is to
pass over youth like a difficult
chapter in a text.

‘‘Where was your date?”

“A handful of them danced with a

handful of us . . . we can dance if we
want ta.”
 

Students, profs discuss rules

The University Council’s Monday
meeting with students about the ap-
parent separation between students
and faculty was marked by typical
arguments, with students saying that
the new fraternity rules are too re-
strictive and faculty members con-
tending that the faculty is looking out
for the best interests of the student

body.

of the founders of the chapter’s an-

«<* nual Lee Day Party.

Held the Friday closest to Jan. 19,
| Robert E. Lee’s birthday, the Lee
‘' Day Party has grown from an atten-

“© , dance of about 30 its first year, 1978,

to nearly 300, making it one of the

‘largest annual off-campus events,
, DuBose said.

The trustees will attend the party,

‘s. at DuBose’s home, as part of their

«, ,next regular meeting, Jan. 18 and 19

in Atlanta. In fact, DuBose said, the

« ‘board rescheduled its meeting from

early February in order to be able to

. attend the party.

DuBose, who said he regarded his
,election ‘‘as a challenge and an op-
portunity,’ added that he ‘‘would like

 *to see the board in some respects be-

.come more communicative with the
alumni, and I would like to see what
*we’ve done here in Atlanta [with

' ,regard to recruiting and other alum-

ni activities] echoed on a nationwide
‘basis.”

The transition to coeducation, Du-
Bose said, ‘‘obviously, right now, is
‘probably foremost in my mind. From
_all indications, that is going to be the
most critical issue that we are going
‘to have to deal with in the next year.”
_ Following a poll of Atlanta-area
alumni by pollster Claibourne Dar-
‘den, a W&L alumnus, DuBose wrote
a letter to the board of trustees noting
‘that about 70 percent of those re-
sponding to the survey either strong-
ly or mildly opposed coeducation.

“We felt the alumni should be
given an opportunity to respond to
the challenge first’ by taking a more
‘active role in recruiting, DuBose
said, but ‘‘if other alternatives didn’t
work, coeducation might be a viable
solution that should be pursued.”

The suggestion of increased alumni
support caine to be known as “‘the At-

student leaders have pursued regula-
tion of the houses, too,’’ Parker said.
“Students must not overlook that
their self-interests as well as faculty
desires have prompted revisions.”

Attending Monday’s 3 p.m. session
at the Alumni House were University
Council members Parker, Instructor
Debora Rindge, senior Bill Joel and
junior Jeff Hubbard, as well as sever-
al other students. Earlier this month,
the UC proposed the idea of hav-
ing a specific committee study the
dwindling connections between stu-
dents and faculty. _

“The faculty is asking for input on
the subject of relations,” said history
Professor David Parker, an organi-
zer of the group. ‘‘There needs to be a
specification of problems between
students and faculty members, and
also there needs to be a clear identi-
fication of the source of the pro-
blems.”

Rindge pointed out the wide effect
of the fraternities on students, facul-
ty and the community. She said that
in any situation of tension, numerous
groups have conflicting responsibili-
ties to uphold, and a compromise

one freshman representative, Caru-
thers told the EC Monday night.

EC President Cole Dawson said
freshmen who want to talk to a repre-
sentative usually seek out an upper-
classman they have met through
fraternity Rush or freshman orienta-
tion, so an extfa member is not need-
ed.

“The question is ‘Do they think
they need another [representa-
tive]?’ ” Caruthers said

Freshman representative Brandt
Wood said he thinks one represen-
tative is adequate for the freshman
class, but agreed to ask his consitu-
tents if they want an additional re-
presentative for freshmen.

Each undergraduate class current-
ly has two representatives, but the
freshman class has only one, elected
in the fall. The first-year law class
has one representative, and one stu-
dent represents both the second- and
third-year classes.

Last week the EC voted to sponsor
a student body referendum about
whether to add another law represen-

some controversy. in the last few
weeks. :

At the Nov. 5 Executive Committee
meeting, Vice President James
White reported a complaint he’d re-
ceived about the Cold Check Commit-
tee’s operating methods.

“‘We were not accusing anyone of
not doing their job,” he said. ‘Our
job is to find out the facts.”

White said the complaint concern-
ed the fact that although University
Center secretary Carole Chappell
had placed notices in the commit-
tee’s mailbox from merchants about
cold checks, the memos were not
picked up.

Chappell said the volume has been
especially heavy in recent weeks
since bounced checks are most com-
mon at Thanksgiving break and at
the end of the school year.

Dina Albertoli of the Business Of-
fice staff said that until Friday, her
office had accumulated about $700 in

lanta Solution,” said DuBose, adding
that after the decision had been
made, he wrote University President
John D. Wilson to tell him that ‘the
would definitely have our support for
the University.”’

The relationship between the Univ-
ersity and fraternities also is impor-
tant, said DuBose, who did not join a
fraternity until midway through his
sophomore year and then was presi-
dent of Pi Kappa Alpha his senior
year.

While at the University, he also
was president of the Commerce Fra-
ternity, vice president of the senior
class and a member of Beta Gamma
Sigma, the honor fraternity for busi-
ness administration.

DuBose then worked as national
field sales manager for the Atlanta
Stove Works until 1977, when he and
W&L classmate Louis L. Jones III
formed the DuBose-Jones Co., an At-
lanta real estate developer.

must be reached so that each group
can pursue its goals.

Both Parker and Rindge maintain-
ed that the faculty is not seeking to
create conflict at all, but that it is
willing to mediate and to discuss any
problems. An impediment, however,
comes in the awareness of those stu-
dents who hastily question changes in
regulation and policy without under-
standing the issues. The Ring-tum
Phi is one accurate information
source, said Rindge, adding that if
people do not consult such sources
then they will rely on hearsay. She
recognized, too, the impossible task
of forcing people to read The Phi.

The other major topic of the ses-
sion concerned the lack of personal
communication between students
and faculty. One student recognized
the need for increased student initi-
ative to ameliorate problems and to
improve the situation. He mentioned
his success in working with faculty,
and said he thought only a small ef-
fort is necessary on the part of stu-
dents to improve communication.
Joel added that ‘‘the people who com-
plain most loudly about problems at

frosh rep

tative so each law class has one
representative. The referendum,
which will be on the ballot for March
EC officer elections, would raise the
number of EC members from 12 to
13.

Although the idea has not been put
on the ballot, the addition of another
freshman representative could raise
the number of members ot 14.

Also Monday night, the EC heard
from Henry Exall, chairman of the
cold check committee, who told the
committee that he is trying to per-
suade McDonald’s, Wendy’s and the
movie theaters to accept W&L stu-
dents’ checks.

The EC also heard budget reports
from the Hockey Club, the Calyx, the
Student Activities Board and The
Ring-tum Phi. The International
Club, the Frisbee Club and the Fenc-
ing Team were scheduled to report,
but did not show. The committee de-
cided to give the International Club a
second chance, but voted to freeze
the Business Office accounts of the
other two absent clubs.

returned checks. She said no action .

from the Cold Check Committee was
forthcoming until she threatened to
see Dean of Students Lewis John
about the matter.

She said the checks were then hast-
ily retrieved by Henry Exall, the
committee chairman. “It was the
first time I’d seen him this year,”
Albertoli said.

Exall said he was unfamiliar with
past committee procedure and was
unaware that the chairman of the
Cold Check Committee is responsible
for Business Office pick-ups.

He added that the merchants who
lodged the complaints are ‘‘notorious
for that sort of thing’’ and that he had
“‘checked into the situation.”’

“It’s a new committee and anytime
you have a new one, it takes time to
get oriented,’’ Chappell said.

Exall said that in the future, he
plans to pick up the Business Office
checks weekly.

 

Also last month, James M. Ballen-
gee was re-elected to his second six-
year term on the board and to his sec-
ond three-year term as rector. Bal-
lengee, a 1948 law school graduate of
W&L, is president and chairman of
Enterra Corp. a Radnor, Pa., holding
company with 10 subsidiaries.

Also re-elected to their second six-
year board terms were Thomas B.
Branch III, an Atlanta attorney who
graduated from Washington and Lee
in 1958, and Jerry G. South, a 1954
W&L graduate and president of BA
Mortgage and International Realty
Corp.

The third position left open by the
retiring board members will be filled
by a candidate nominated by the
alumni next year. Alumni vote on
candidates nominated by the Alumni
Board and the winner usually is
elected by the Board as a trustee, ac-
cording to University Secretary
James Whitehead.

W&L probably don’t know their fac-
ulty well.”’

Parker agreed and indicated that
as a faculty member, he’s discourag-
ed when students don’t use opportuni-
ties to voice problems. He recognized
the need to publicize conflicts in or-
der to achieve real improvements.
On the subject of fraternity regula-
tion, Parker suggested more overt
response to undesirable rules, say-
ing, ‘The fraternities should ask the
administration for clear factual evi-
dence that Wednesday parties hurt
things like GPAs and class atten-
dance.”

Another idea was for more infor-
mal contact between students and
faculty, and Parker suggested a stu-
dent-faculty discount at Cockpit hap-
py hours. He also commented that
publicizing the issue of student-fac-
ulty relations is important.

“This week’s meetings are a good
way to bring problems into the
open,” Parker said. ‘Some of the
deterioration in student relations is
hard to pinpoint, but mentioning
areas of difficulty can have a ther-
apeutic effect.”’

Russian films
help students
learn language

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Russian language film series,
“Kino-USSR,”’ presents its conclud-
ing film of the semester Thursday,
Nov. 29. The selection, titled ‘The
Twelve Chairs,”’ is a political satire
dealing with three con men in the
Soviet Union.

Russian Instructor Greta Mc-
Caughrin, the sponsor of the series,
said this week that Russian-oriented
films will probably continue next
term, but will be fewer in number
and presented in conjunction with the
politics department.

The purpose of this film series, she
said, was primarily to expose stu-
dents of Russian to the characteristic
rhythm and accent of the spoken lan-
guage. She pointed out that the mov-
ies also expose students to a foreign
culture, and give them the opportu-
nity to take advantage of experiences
beyond the normal classroom fare.

McCaughrin said her students, who
make up the bulk of the film audi-
ence, are often bored by the crude
Soviet film techniques and the idea-
listic views of the Soviet system, but
are pleased when they can pick up a
phrase or part of a conversation.

A hook-and-ladder, two pumpers and two rescue units from the Lexington
Fire Department rushed to the Commerce School about 10 p.m. Friday after
smoke was discovered on the basement level. University Proctor Charles F. |
Murray said a student studying in the building smelled smoke and notified |

burned out due to a power surge on the Virginia Electric Power Co. line. A |

Independent Union sets
Dec. 1 Christmas party

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Fraternity members won’t be the
only students full of holiday cheer
(among other things) on Dec. 1 when
the Greeks traditionally throw their
Christmas parties. This year, Wash-
ington and Lee’s Independent Union
plans to have a bash of its own in the
Cockpit that night.

Though still in the development
stages, the IU is presently contacting
three area bands — the Convertibles,
the Nabobs and the Eliminators — in
the hopes of hiring one of them for the
party, vice president Luke Cornelius
said. In addition, he said, they are
trying to contact one of the local wo-
men’s colleges for support and parti-
cipation.

Cornelius said that the event will
provide alternative entertainment
for independents who are blocked
from fraternity parties. '

IU president Chuck Diffenderffer
said the band decision rests primari-
ly on how much money the IU will be
allowed to spend. The night prior to

Christmas Weekend

&

$6 at Door
$5 in Advance at W&L Bookstore

the party, the SAB will host the White
Animals and the Producers in the
new pavilion.

The Christmas party will be open
to all independents, Cornelius said.

“You don’t even have to be a dues
paying member,”’ he stressed: ‘‘Our
programs are not mutually depen-
dent. In other words, you don’t have
to put in a certain amount of work or
money to participate. We're here to
see what the independents want to
do.”

The IU has been participating in
Intramurals all year, and Cornelius
said they would plan to sponsor as
many teams as will participate. Fur
thermore, independents can organize
their own teams and the Union will
sponsor those as well.

In other areas, the IU has begun

putting together its own “‘cold test’’
file with contributions both from stu

Suicide

Continued from Page }
should not be ignored, Worth said.

“If you notice in a persistent way a person
using suicide references, I think if it were my
friend, I'd say, ‘At first I laughed, but now
it’s getting a little scary. Have you been
depressed lately?’ ”’

Worth said one circumstance that encour-
ages people with suicidal tendencies to act on
those impulses is for them to hear about or
read of another suicide. As an example, he
said that for six months after Monroe’s sui-
cide, there was a statistically significant in-
crease in the New York City suicide rate.

Another catalyst for suicidal behavior,
Worth said, becomes apparent when the indi-
vidual is under the influence of alcohol. ‘‘It’s
often hard enough to keep your Wefenses up
against the depression even when you're
sober,’’ he commented.

 

Dr. Lucy Davidson, a spokeswoman for the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said
the suicide rate for college-age people has
tripled in the last 25 years. Suicide is the third
most frequent cause of death for that age
group after accidents and homicide, accord-
ing to government statistics.

Davidson added that suicide is ‘almost
exclusively a phenomenon of white male-
ness.’ She said 88 percent of reported
suicides are in that category.

Davidson said a firearm is used in 63 per-
cent of male suicides. ‘“That may be a side ef-
fect of the male love affair with firearms,”
she said, adding that other common suicide
methods are hanging, asphyxiation, drug
overdose and cutting with a sharp object.

She said four males complete a suicide at-
tempt for every one female who completes it.
On the other hand, four females attempt it for
every oné woman who is successful. ‘‘The
figures just reverse,’’ she said.

A frequent explanation among researchers

 

 

for that disparity, Davidson said, is that
“‘with women it is more of a cry for help, but
with males it is a more intentional self-
destruction.”’

Worth said an important distinction exists
between a suicide gesture, which is a more of
a half-hearted, attention-getting effort, and
“a person who is really going for a kill.”

“Pills are convenient,”’ he said. ‘‘We are a
drug-oriented society. It’s not messy, and
there’s always the possibility that you will be
found or discovered or that there will be an
antidote.

“With a shotgun, school’s out. That’s it.
That’s an assassination of the self, not a cry
for help.”’

“There is a statistical probability that with
Washington and Lee coeducating, we will
have more suicide gestures,’ Worth said.
“That’s not sexist — that’s just statistics.”

Worth, however, sees a positive aspect to
the admission of women. ‘‘One of the reasons
I think coeducating is a good thing is that the

 

all-male atmosphere is stressful,” he said.
“It’s not easy for many students to establish
relationships with women— whether roman-
tic or just friendships.”

“With women coming on campus, my hope
and my conviction is that we’ll have an en-
vironment where W&L men can have more
meaningful relationships with women,” he
added. “The whole roadtrip situation and
a party mixer scene is very stress-

Dean of Students Lewis G. John said there’s
an unstructured system in which professors
and others who notice that a student seems
unusually depressed notify the proper school
officials.

“Definitely there is an informal system that
works,” John said. ‘My experience over the
last couple of weeks confirms that.’’

He said that in recent days at least two pro-
fessors have told him about students who had
— a marked change in mental atti-
tude.

Psychologist’s advice for crisis situations |

“The professors feel free — if not obligated)
to let us know if they sense problems,” he
said

He said Worth handles problems on a confi-’
dential basis, and added that except in ex
treme cases other parties are not brought in
without the student’s permission

“If Dr. Worth feels the individual is a threat ,
to himself or the community, he may feel
some step is necessary to see that the indivi- '
dual is hospitalized or that the parents are
notified,”’ he said. ‘‘Otherwise the confiden
tiality would not be breached.”’

John said other professionals on campus «
may also be able to help students with mental
health problems. ‘We've got a lot of people’
around here who are willing and able to. coun- ‘
sel students,”’ he said.

John said it’s impossible to know how ma
ny W&L students seriously consider suicide. *
“Not a lot,”’ he said. “But some do. It's the
ones that do that you have to worry about.”’

DR. JAMES W. WORTH

University counseling psychologist
Dr. James W. Worth offers advice on
how a person should react when a
friend is contemplating or threaten-
ing suicide:

1) Don’t panic. Be levelheaded.
Make sure you understand what your
friend is saying.

2) Express your concern and sup-
port for the person — they are going
through a tough time. Express your
strong conviction that suicide is not

an answer to the problem

3) Encourage your friend to talk
about what is bothering them. You
don’t have to be a psychologist or a
psychiatrist. You don’t have to know
the answers. You just need to listen.

4) Try to get a sense of how far
along in the contemplation process
your friend is. Have they written a
note in their mind — do they know
what they’d say in the note? Have
they fantasized a lot about how peo-
ple will react when they discover the

suicide — what the reaction of their
girlfriend, mother or dad, or friends
would be? If you find that the con-
templation process has gone a long
way, that’s a negative sign. Another
negative sign is the absence of future
thinking — not making plans or
thinking beyond a certain point.

5) If you feel the person is overtly
suicidal and about to do something,
stay with them. Try to get help, even
if it means calling the rescue squad
or the police. You can call a dean, or

(University Proctor Charles] Mur-
ray.

6) If the person does not appear
ready to do something but might.in
the future, see if they will come in to
see me. If they won’t, you come.in
and see me, and we'll talk about
ways we could encourage the person
to come in. A person who is suicida!
eventually does need to get into cou-
seling. They need to get their life.in
order so they don’t feel suicide is the
only option.

Lexington man charged
for automobile break-ins

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

A Lexington man has been ar-
rested in connection with several re-
cent break-ins of cars in the parking
lot near Red Square known as ‘“‘the
Corral.”

Mark Edward Hostetter has been
charged with 12 counts ranging from
tampering with a vehicle to grand
larceny.

According to Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton, Hostetter was first
arrested Nov. 2 and charged with
three counts of grand larceny, two
counts of petit larceny and four
counts of tampering with a vehicle.
He was later released and rearrested
Nov. 10, and charged with another
count of grand larceny, one count of
breaking and entering and one count
of unlawful entry -

Since the school year started, there
have been between 18 and 20 inci-
dents of cars being broken into, said
Sutton, adding that some of the cars
had their windows broken and, in
other instances, a coat hanger or
other such device was used to unlock
the doors.

Items taken included purses, cloth-
ing and other items of value left
in the vehicles. Sutton added that
almost all of the incidents occurred
on “party nights.”

Hostetter is being held in Rock-
bridge County Jail.

Sutton said the best way to prevent
automobile break-ins is not to leave
valuables in view. He added that
“leaving purses out or even putting
them under your seat invites trou-
ble.’’ He suggested locking valuables
in the trunk to prevent theft.

Many of the cars broken into be-
long to girls who come up for the par-
ties, which often leads to problems,
according to Sutton. Frequently, he
said, the girls either leave and wait
until the next day to telephone or
drive to the police station. Sutton em-
phasized that if a car is broken into,
the owner shouldn’t touch anything,
but should call the police immediate-
ly. This makes it easier for the police
to investigate the crime, he added.

In addition to helping the investiga-
tion, reporting the crime quickly can
make the police aware of the pro-
blem, and they can begin an imme-
diate search.

Leary talks on A

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Staff Reporter

 

We are on the verge of the next
stage in man’s evolutionary process,
and the home computer is the key to
unlocking the door, according to Dr.
Timothy Leary, who brought his
message to campus Thursday night.

“The.future of your life is going to
depend on how well you know your
brain,” Leary told an audience that
packed Lee Chapel. ‘‘The brain in
1984 is still a taboo organ,’’ he said,
but he predicted that within 10 years
man will reprogram his brain to
achieve the next logical evolutionary
step.

Liberally sprinkling ‘‘computer-
ese’ throughout his speech, Leary
gave a capsule history of ‘‘the evolu-
tion of intelligence in species and in-
dividuals.’’ He described how “‘know-
ledge information processors’ had
evolved from the garden of Eden,
through the medieval monastery, to
the Newtonian, industrialized con-
sumer society of today.

Equating the 1976 invention of the
Apple home computer with Guten-
berg’s 1456 personal book, the ‘‘first
mass produced object,’’ Leary said
the home computer will have an
equally profound impact. Our socie-
ty, he added, will move from an in-
dustrialized one to an informational
one.

Leary makes a point during his speech Thursday night.

Wearing a conservative gray suit
and white sneakers, Leary praised
Dr. Benjamin Spock’s post-World
War II creed, “treat your kids as in-
dividuals,” as planting the seeds for
this trend toward self-knowledge. In-
teraction between individuals was an
important byproduct of Spock’s
teaching, according to Leary, and
one that led to the searching, aues-
tioning mind he deemed necessary
for our evolution.

Leary concluded his 50-minute
speech with a comic rendering of a
Darwinian ‘‘macho theory of repro-
duction,”’ and he received a round of
laughter and applause. After a short
break, he answered questions about
subjects ranging from Jesus’ place in
our society to his notorious experi-
ments with drugs.

“Think for yourself, and keep your
eyes open,’’ were the themes to
which he kept returning. A self-pro-
claimed humanist, proud to have de-
scended from Adam and Eve, who
questioned God’s authority and broke
the first ‘‘two food and drug regula-
tions,’’ Leary admitted sympathy for
fundamentalists angered by his
ideas.

Admittedly having tried ‘more

drugs than anyone around,” Leary
said he understood why they weren’t
for everyone. He claimed that in the
1960s, drugs became just another
consumer item and that for every.
person unwilling to try them, there
are other ‘‘intelligent explorers.’’ He’
called drugs just another tool to “‘re.,
lease your brains,’’ which he equated
with “a hundred billion micropro-
cessors.”’ :
Leary also said he hoped that to-

day’s “incredible renaissance of the
body’’ would also lead to a renais-:
sance of the brain. Computers art
simply extensions of the brain and he
hopes future approaches to their use
will be along psychological and philo

sophical lines, rather than the cur

rent technical and industrial lines.

Where can Washington and Lee
students get ‘‘the write stuff’’? The

‘ ment to help students improve their

essay development.

Two senior English majors, Andy
Haring and Landon Jones, are avail-
able to tutor students.

Professor George Ray, the director
of the Writing Center, explained that

* there is a need for the program on
. campus,

“The backgrounds of the students

* in the last decade have declined,” he

said. ‘‘We need every mechanism to
correct the writing deficiencies that
weren’t addressed in prep school.”’
The Writing Center began three
years ago. More freshmen than up-

,

creased, Ray reports.

He said that an average of four stu-
« dents a night have used the center
this semester. He described it as a

" “low-budget, no-frills operation’
. with an excellent staff.
“We have two very good tutors who

* are easy to talk to and to work with,”
, he said. ‘‘We tried to choose two sen-
ior English majors who are good
* writers and who are able to relate
. well with other students without
sounding patronizing or arrogant.”
* Jones explained why he thinks that
, the Writing Center is beneficial to
students.
“It gives students a chance to come
, to us with questions about revision,”
he said. ‘‘We can help them correct
* mechanical elements.”

Ray stressed that the Writing Cen-
ter is a peer tutorial service. He ex-
’ plained his role as being that of an
, administrator and a liaison to faculty

-

members who have referred students
to the program. Ray said the Writing
Center is open to all students who
want to improve their writing, re-
gardless of whether a faculty mem-
ber has recommended the program
to them. ‘‘Upperclassmen can
benefit just as much as freshmen,”
Ray declared.

Any Haring said students are only
allowed to bring ‘‘cold’’ — already
graded — papers to the sessions, ex-
cept when their professor gives them
permission.

The one-to-one atmosphere is one
of the positive components of the
Writing Center, according to Haring.
He sees himself as an equal with the
students who come in for help.

“I don’t think of myself as super-
ior,” he said. ‘‘I think of myself as so-
meone who has been there.”’

Sophomore Robert Berlin describ-
ed the program as beneficial to his
writing.

“Tt gives me the chance to get my
papers squared away,” he said. CK
impresses the teachers when your
papers are grammatically correct.”

Jones explained that conference
notes are kept during the session for
the director to determine the number
of people who use the service and to
chart the progress of the referrals.

Students who plan to go to the Writ-
ing Center should sign up in advance
so that the tutors can know how many
students to expect. Jones said that
this would be helpful to know how
many students are planning to attend
because both tutors are not always
present.

Haring had another suggestion for
students planning to come to the
Writing Center.

“They should read over their pa-
pers, read their professor’s com-
ments, and then come in and tell us
what they think the problem is,” he

Wendy Fairey, who also attended

‘also warned the committee that al-
, though it is planning in good faith, it
will inevitably be criticized for some
“ of its recommendations.

"members were not especially sur-
»prised by what Fairey said. She ar-
ticulated some impressions that com-
“mittee members already had, Simp-
«son said.

with personal problems just like any

Simpson added that many people
_ think that there is no longer any pro-
blem of discrimination toward wo-
» men and that women at W&L will not
, encounter any problems with dis-
crimination.
» “When we talk to any special inter-
, est group, the initial response is that
there is no problem,”’ she said. ‘‘But
* when we invite them to think about it
_ they see there is a problem.”’

What Will It Mean?

Simpson noted that although the
committee has made few recom-
mendations so far, just discussing
some issues might be the most im-
portant aspect of the committee’s
work.

“We're inviting the committee to
consider things,’ she elaborated.
“Sometimes just raising the question
is going to be the important thing,”
said Simpson.

Simpson said that in other action,
Dean of Students Lewis John told the
committee that the University hopes
to fill the new assistant dean of stu-
dents position by July 1. Simpson
said that the function of the new dean
will include counseling and develop-
ing the women’s programs and help-
ing with career counseling.

said. “This saves us both time.”’

According to Ray, only 10 profes-
sors outside the English Department
referred students to the Writing
Center last year. He said informing
students of it is one of the major goals
for the program.

“One of our concerns is getting stu-
dents from other disciplines and for
students to come in without any im-
petus of their professors,’ he said.

Students may return to the pro-
gram as often as they like.

“We're not a cure-all,” Haring
said. “If you keep coming back,
you’ll see an improvement in your
writing.”

The tutors said that by reading
other people’s writing they gained in-
sights into their own, which helps
them to improve their compositions.

Tutoring is available in Payne 2B
from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursdays during the fall term.

Movie Critic

With “Crimes of Passion,”
writer/producer Barry Sandler
and director Ken Russell have
given us one of the strangest and
most controversial movies of the
year. Like Brian dePalma’s ‘‘Bo-
dy Double,”’ “Crimes of Passion’
is full of explicit scenes of sex and
some violence, yet “Crimes”
deals more with people and rela-
tionships than the dePalma my-
stery did. ‘‘Crimes’ attracted
quite a bit of attention this year
because of its many trips to the
editing booth (to reduce its X-
rating to an R). What we are left
with is still a steamy, off-beat
story that may leave a bad taste in
one’s mouth.

Kathleen Turner plays a fashion
designer with a double life: in her
other identity she is the streets’
hottest hooker; Anthony Perkins

 

 

portrays a gutter ‘‘reverend’’ who
sets out to ‘‘save’’ her from her
prostitution; and John Loughlin is
an innocent family man whose
marriage is breaking down, who
falls in love with Turner after
discovering her double identity.
All three turn in strong perfor-
mances. Perkins’ insanity and at-
tempts to suppress his sexual de-
sires serve as foils for Laughlin’s
innocence and longing to fulfill his
desires, and Turner is caught in
the middle.

Many little things impressed me
in this film. The soundtrack
comes complete with leitmotifs,
including a bizarre rock video that
describes the fallout of Laughlin’s
marriage. The director also added
visual symbols, from the paint-
ings in Turner’s apartment to the
“Lifesavers” wrapping paper on
a gift given to Laughlin (from his
wife) ina vain attempt to work out
tne marital problems Unques-

The Ring-tum Phi, November 15, 1984, Page 5
Steamy ‘Crimes’ leaves bad taste

tionably, the relationship develop-
ing between the young man and
the woman-caught-between-two
worlds was, for me, the strength
of this film.

What bothered me most about
“crimes of Passion’’ was the cons-
tant interruption of the Tur-
ner/Laughlin scenes by Perkins.
The director’s point is clearly
stated, but he doesn’t have to
pound that point at us. Also, there
were moments when I felt Perkins
was pushing too hard. He has a
chilling style, and he makes great
use of it in several scenes; how-
ever, sometimes he just carries
things a little far.

I would like to recommend this
film without reservations. Unfor-
tunately the constant interrup-
tions by Perkins and his occasion-
al pushing won't allow me to do
this. ‘‘Crimes of Passion’’ is not a
a film, but it could be a better
ilm.

 

 

Computer package allows precise presidential prediction

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Before last Tuesday’s presidential
election, students in Professor
William Buchanan’s Politics 229
class predicted what the results
among Republican voters across the
nation would be.

These predictions were not random
guesses, however, In the month pre-
ceding the election, the class studied
factors that had affected results in
past elections. From this informa-
tion, each member of the class select-
ed those factors he thought would
have the greatest impact on
Republican voters.

knew what was up and did what they
were supposed to,” he explained.

Lukanuski said he was pleased
with the performance of the under-
classmen and especially with the
way the seniors conducted their
courses Saturday morning and their
overall performance. ‘‘The success
of the exercise can be directly at-
tributed to their performance,”’ he
added.

Another factor that contributed to
the success of the weekend was the
weather. Ripple said it was the best
weather for an FTX in the three
years he has been at W&L, and that
includes exercises held in the spring.

Ripple also pointed out that this
was the first FTX since the arrival of
the new military science chairman,
Col. Luke B. Ferguson. Ripple said
that Ferguson was surprised by the
professionalism displayed by the
juniors and seniors.

Ripple said an FTX is conducted to
serve several purposes: to give sen-
iors an opportunity to plan and carry
out a field exercise, to provide
juniors a chance to serve in a leader-
ship position, to provide cadets with
an opportunity to learn and hone mil-
itary skills. To give everyone a
chance to go out and have fun.

 

tors, Buchanan said, were the econo-
my, unemployment, previous voting
trends in each state and the personal
popularity of the president.

These factors, or variables, were
entered into a computer using a pro-
gram called Minitab, and the stu-
dents made a state-by-state analysis
and prediction of the election results.

It was a complex operation, Buch-
anan said. Students had to think on a
national scale as well as considering
each state’s particular interests
before making their predictions.
Data was collected on each of the 50
states and the District of Columbia.

Buchanan said he felt that the class
as a whole was successful with the
assignment. ‘‘The average error was
not too bad,’’ he said, adding that the

amount of error ranged from four to
eight percentage points per state.

Pat Hayden, a junior politics ma-
jor, had a 4.3 percent error, one of the
lowest in the class, in his prediction.
He said he thought his results were so
close to the standard deviation on the
assignment because he selected
specific variables rather than gene-
ral points in his analysis.

The variables Hayden used were
the economy, past political indentifi-
cation in each state and Reagan’s
personal popularity.

Although many of the students
used these variables. Hayden said a
better prediction can be made by ad-
justing the variables to get a more
accurate interpretation of the voters’
feelings.

In his case, Hayden narrowed his
economic category to the change ex-
perienced in personal income, some-
thing Reagan and the Republicans
stressed heavily in the fall campaign
with the question “Are you better off
now than you were four years ago?”’

Another variable that Hayden ad-
justed for was Reagan’s personal
popularity, a factor that apparently
was very important to voters across
the country.

Personal popularity seemed to
take precedence over the concrete
issues, he said, adding that the pro-
ject was interesting because it
“showed which variables were
important in this particular elec-
tion.”

SBC student pleads guilty in fatal wreck

A Sweet Briar sophomore plead-
ed guilty yesterday to a reckless
driving charge resulting from a
Sept. 22 crash that killed another
student.

Tracey A. McCoy was fined $50
plus $20 in court costs by an Appo-
mattox General District Court
judge.

McCoy is said to have fallen
asleep at the wheel of her BMW
when she was returning from
Hampden-Sydney College with
two other students inthe car.

Anne K. Adams was killed af ter
she was thrown from the car,
which ran off the road and repeat-

Police investigators estimate
the car was going 65 to 70 miles an
hour when it crashed.

McCoy, who was hospitalized in
serious condition after the acci-
dent, did not testify yesterday.

S
Rout g

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee football
team clinched its fifth consecutive
winning season with a convincing
35-10 victory over Lebanon Valley
College Saturday in Annville, Pa.

The Generals dominated every
phase of the game, rolling more than
300 yards of offense and limiting
Lebanon Valley to 140 yards on the
way to their fourth consecutive win.

Senior tailback Gene Girard led the
General offense with 140 yards on 27
carries. Girard also had three pass
receptions for 55 yards. He scored a
touchdown to aid the W&L effort, as
well.

“It was great to see Gene Girard
have his best day of the year in his
last game of his career,’ head coach
Gary Fallon said.

W&L scored its first points in the
first quarter when Chris Bleggi ran
34 yards for a touchdown. James
White kicked the extra point, giving
the Generals a 7-0 lead with 3:43 re-
maining in the first quarter.

On Lebanon Valley’s next posses-
sion, W&L defensive back Tim Jany-
ska intercepted a pass by Kevin
Peters and returned it 36 yards for a
touchdown, making the score 14-0.

Neither team was able to score
again before halftime.

In the third quarter, W&L quarter-
back Jon Thornton put the Generals
ahead 21-0 when he passed 37 yards to
wide receiver Hugh Finkelstein for a
touchdown.

Lebanon Valley finally got on the
scoreboard later in e quarter when
placekicker Bob Muir connected on a
43-yard field goal, making the score
21-3.

The Generals turned the game into
a rout in the fourth quarter by scor-
ing two touchdowns.

Girard scored on a one-yard run to
up the Generals’ lead to 28-3. Senior
fullback Danny Jayne ran seven
yards for W&L’s final score, giving
the Generals a 35-3 lead.

Lebanon Valley scored late in the
game, leaving the final score 35-10.

W&L totaled 352 yards offense,
with 224 yards coming on the ground.
Thornton completed eight of 18 pass-

PORTS

The Ring-tum Phi

ives gridders record

es for 128 yards and one touchdown.

The General defense turned in one
of its better performances of the
season, giving up only 34 yards
rushing.

The five consecutive winning sea-
sons marked the first time the Gene-
rals have been able to accomplish the
feat since they did the same in the
1919-24 seasons.

“IT am proud of everyone on the
team, in particular the seniors, who
went out on a high note, winning four

inarow,”’ Fallonsaid,

“Offensively we were a little up-
tight, but our defense played ver:
well and shut down Lebanon Valley's
rushing game,” Fallon said. ‘‘The
defense scored once for us and con-
stantly give us good field position.”

The Generals won their first game
this season before dropping four of
their next five contests. W&L re-

grouped af ter its loss to Hampden-
Sydney to win its last four games
against the University of the South,

Bridgewater, Samford and Lebanon
Valley.

“T hate to see the season end,”
Fallon said. ‘‘We were on a roll, win-
ning our last four games, and proba-
bly would have continued to win. I
give the credit to the players, espec-
ially the seniors, who kept on
fighting.”’

The Generals lose 13 seniors from
the 1984 team, 12 of whom were start-
ers,

ment. The Generals will face Alfred University in Fri-
day night’s opener.

Cagers should be in thick of it again

 

y
Special to the Phi

The 1984-85 Washington and Lee
basketball Generals, by all indica-
tions, should bring a great deal of
excitement to the Warner Center this
winter. The Generals should once
again be in the thick of the race for
the ODAC title, along with perenially
strong teams from Roanoke and
Lynchburg.

“T am looking forward to this sea-
son with a great deal of anticipation
because we have excellent potential,
and could have a very good year,”
said W&L Coach Verne Canfield.

This statement alone should give
W&L fans cause for optimism, be-
cause Canfield is not known for mak-
ing such effusive statements before
the beginning of a season. Canfield,
who is entering his 20th year as the
Generals’ coach, has had 17 winning
seasons out of his last 18.

Canfield’s first job will be to try to
replace the gap in the frontcourt left
by the graduation of John Lee
Graves. Graves, who finished as the
seventh-leading scorer on the Gene-
rals all-time list, averaged 20 points
and 7.9 rebounds per game, leading
the team in both categories.

To fill the void left by Graves, Can-
field will look mainly to senior co-

captain Scott Shannon. Shannon, who
averaged 8.7 points and 6.6 rebounds
last year, will have to increase both
of those figures (especially the re-
bounding) in order for the Generals
to be successful this year.

Joining the 6-5 Shannon in the
frontcourt will most likely be 6-4
sophomore Rob Spencer. Spencer
looked impressive last year when he
did play, and will be counted upon to
help Shannon on the boards. The Gen-
erals were hurt up front, however,
when forward Keith Brideweser, a
freshman last year who averaged 7.3
points per game, transfered.

Other names to watch for up front
will be sophomore Jefferson Harral-
son, and freshmen Steve Alby, Gary
Schott, Louis Trosch, Swen Vokel and
Harmon Harden.

Moving to the backcourt, the situa-
tion is completely different. Canfield
has five senior guards to choose
from, all of whom have shown that
they can play. An added bonus is the
return of Bill Yates. Yates, who was
not at W&L last year, averaged 14.4
points per game in 1982-83. He was
the Generals’ best outside shooter as
a sophomore and junior, and could be
W&L’s main offensive weapon this
year.

Joining Yates at the other starting
guard position will most likely be co-

captain Kevin McClatchey. McClat-
chey, who came from nowhere to
claim to starting berth last year, pos-
esses great floor sense and savvy,
and also averaged 9.3 points per
game last year.

Canfield will not hesitate in going
to his bench this year, however, es-
pecially in the backcourt. Senior
Dave Wilkinson will be contending
for a starting job, and Mike Hudson
will also see a good deal of time.

One of the key players for the Gen-
erals will be senior swingman Lex
Fitzenhagen. Fitzenhagen, who was
the Generals second-leading scorer
(12.2) last year before undergoing
knee surgery, is probably the most
physically talented player on the
team. With the Generals’ depth at
guard, he figures to see most of his
action up front.

Because of the team’s lack of size,
look for the Generals to use a three-
guard lineup much of the time, with
Fitzenhagen filling the third guard
spot. This will enable W&L to put its
good ball-handlers on the floor, whick
should neutralize some deficiencies
in size and speed.

Defensively, Canfield has shown
that he likes to pressure the ball a lot,
often anywhere on the court. This
year, the Generals have the person-
nel to do this. Yates and McClatchey

are both tough one-on-one defensive
players, and Mike Hudson, a defen-
sive specialist, will also be a key in
this department.

W&L will not be a particularly fast
or big team this year, so the Generals
will have to rely on patience on of-
fense and heavy ball pressure on de-
fense.

Overall, the Generals should have
a very successful year. Fundamen-
tals, teamwork and discipline, espec-
ially on defense, will tell the story. As
Canfield said, “‘We will win with our
defense, and this year I feel we have
the people who can play it.”

junior from Dallas, were two of 24
players named this week to the
All-Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference football team. Players
were selected by vote of ODAC
coaches.
W&L finished fourth in the six-

Harrier Pittman qualifies for Nationals

By STEVE CREENEBAUM

Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee cross
country team’s season came to an
abrupt finish last Saturday in the
NCAA Division III regionals. The
Generals’ fourth-place finish ended
the season team-wise, but captain
Frank Pittman brightened the day
with his ninth-place finish, qualifying
him for the national championships
this Saturday.

The Generals were favored to fin-
ish in the top two team spots, qualify-
ing them as a team for nationals. The
other finishers were Ted Meyer in
18th place, David Andrews in 2ist
and Bill Clark in 28th. The team

didn’t run as tight as it had
throughout the season.
“Some guys ran well,” said Pitt-

man. ‘‘But the team as a whole didn’t
pull together like it had during our
season.”

Pittman’s bid to nationals can be
attributed in large part to the accom-
plishments of last year’s W&L cross
country All-American Angus
McBryde. McBryde's strong perfor-
mance last year earned the South-
Southeast Region an extra at-large
bid for this year. That extra bid was
the one earned by Pittman.

There were many things that made
last Saturday different from the rest
of the season; first of all, rain. A
reported five inches of standing
water was all over the course. There
were about 95-100 runners and a large

crowd in attendance. The course it-
self was flat with rolling hills, noth-
ing special, according to the team.
Even with the let down of not mak-
ing Nationals, the 1984 cross country
team has nothing to be ashamed of.
They had many historic moments:

14-0, the first undefeated team in the
32 years with coach Miller, his 200th
victory, and by the end of the season
he had 208. And finally, they became
the 1984 Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Champions. A season full of
shut-outs and controlled victories.

Pittman is the remaining chance
for the Generals. If Pittman finishes
in the top 25 he will become an All-
American. How does Pittman feel
about this Saturday?

“I’m scared to death, there is a lot
of pressure to do well.”’

Polo closes season at 18-14-1

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team finished the 1984 season
with an eighth place finish at the
Eastern Championships at West
Point last weekend.

The Generals (18-14-1 in 1984) suf-
fered three losses last weekend. W&L
lost to top seeded Brown 18-6, Iona
10-9 and Harvard 8-3.

“IT thought we played well. We did
some things that we have not been
able to do all year,’’ said head coach
Page Remillard. Remillard added,
‘‘We were able to coach situations
and call plays last weekend. Our in-
experience, however, hurt us some.”

Referring to his team’s inexper-
ience, Remillard said that six of his
players had never played water polo
before this year. He explained, ‘‘To
get inexperienced players to play
competitively is the first step. The
second step is to win.”’

Remillard said that his team made
a lot of progress during the season
and he hopes to begin next year

where he finished this year. Coach
Remillard believes that next year’s
team will have no problem doing
that.

Evaluating the Generals’ 1984 cam-
paign, Remillard said, ‘I am not dis-
appointed at all with this season. I
isn’t a season that you want every
year.”’ Not denying the 1984 team’s
success, Remillard explained that
once you finish second, you want to
be number one.

In 1984, W&L was unable to win the
Southern League for its fourth conse-
cutive conference title. Although the
Generals did not capture the title,
this year, they did place seoond.

Concerning All-American honors,
Remillard stated that W&L has two
major candidates. He said that 1983
All-American Tim Stanford has play-
ed great all season and that Senior
Bobby Pearson has played with the
best this year also.

Before the 1984 season started,
some people had labeled this year’s
campaign as a rebuilding year. With
the successful rebuilding year behind

t

him, Remillard looks to the future
saying that it looks very encourag-
ing.

Remember
what really

is important

.... The headlines splattered across
Monday’s editions of those two Vir-
ginia papers prevalent in these parts
(I’m talking sports sections. Some-
how the other stuff doesn’t make it
through breakfast) were less than
flattering upon the state of sport-
swriters when it comes to the human
compassion scale.

To recount the situation, before I go off half-cocked per usual, ina
NASCAR race on Sunday, a driver was killed in what has been deemed

a “freak accident” when his car spun out of control coming out of a
ton and rammed into an enbankment. Repeat: A driver was killed.

What we got from the sportswriters was a little me more than I just
told you: his name (Tim Schoonover) and the fact that he was a
rookie. Repeat: A driver was killed.

Granted, auto racing is not the most media blitzed of sports events,
and granted, as well, that the Schoonover wreck was the first in the
Grand National Race since 1975. But a little more than a paragraph
and a half, and then we go to something like, ‘‘Meanwhile, Earnhardt
had widened his lead to 13 seconds.”’ Repeat: A driver was killed.

I think the treatment of this story by the press in these instances
Was less than acceptable. Have we become (and this most certainly
includes you and me, the readers) so callous in our concern for win-
ning and losing that we no longer have time to care for such trivialities
as someone being killed in a sporting event? I don’t care if he’s playing
football, racing boats or climbing mountains. Death in any form of
athletic competition is something we have to stand up and take notice
of.

And I’m not asking us to take notice of it in the fashion of calling for
an immediate end to this cruel activity. No, not at all (man’s too cor-
rupt a species to allow for the elimination of such activities that bring
its participants so close to the edge of life—or is that death? )

Rather, what I’m asking is that we look at some sports such as auto
racing, boxing, football, etc., for what they really are and what they
really can do (read: kill their participants, a loaded phrase, indeed). A
death in a sporting event is not something we push off in a sentence or
two as if it were bad weather or a sparse crowd. Unfortunately, that’s
more like it was handled.

I’m not asking us to print the sports pages in white on black when
something like this happens. Let’s just realize that the death of an
athlete in a game, match, race or whatever is something that needs to
be dealt with in terms more worthy of the subject matter. Let the
reader know what happened, why it happened, to whom it happened
and what it means about the sport. If it’s not rated properly by sports-
writers in the first place, we’re all in danger of losing touch with
what’s really important: it’s not the game or its outcome, it’s the peo-
ple who play that should be the story.....

... Turning to the Colonnade, it was good to see the footballers finish
strong. Depending on the recruiting year, 1985 looks promising at this
point....Five inches of water to run in are not conditions worthy of this
year’s cross country team. An unfortunate end, but one that does not
diminish their spotless performance this fall. Best of luck to captain
Frank Pittman in Akron at nationals....0ther W&L whisperings:
Cagers get underway Friday and Saturday. This group looks strong
enough (yes, I’ll say it) to keep Ed Green from smiling...And here’s a
note for fans of national championships: W&L will host the Division III
Tennis Championships this May....

...Hey, that flap last Friday night in Boston Garden between the
once-respected above all others (in my book) Julius Erving and Larry
Bird was inexcusable. So Bird runs all over you one night, Doc. No
need to have your big friends hold him down while you drive three
rights to his chin. You’re a much bigger human being than that. A for-
mal and public apology is requested....

...And this thought as you head home for turkey, mom, dad and
whoever else is waiting with open arms: Can you imagine any NFL
team coming back from 31 points down at halftime? It’s ludicrous. I
thought all NFL games went on automatic pilot once a team was down
by 20. It doesn’t happen that way in college, and that’s why it’s a better

TIME

Ruggers’ fall season
ends with MWC win

The Washington and Lee rugby
team defeated Mary Washington Sat-
urday in the final match of its fall
season by a score of 15-10. The win
gave W&L its sixth win against 3
losses this fall.

W&L opened the scoring against
Mary Washington as Ward Davis and
John Miller worked to get the ball to
Pete Papasavas, who ran 40 meters
for the score. David Arthur added the
two-point kick to put W&L in front
early, 6-0

Mary Washington came back with
two tries to take the lead, 10-6 as the
first conversion kick failed.

The W&L ruggers were minus the
services of captain Bill Jones as he
helped the Virginia Rugby Union’s
select side defeat a similar squad
from the Potomac Rugby Union in
Washington, But the absence of
Jones was not a stumbling block to
the W&L comeback efforts.

David Arthur kicked a difficult
field goal in the wind to cut the Mary
Washington lead to three, and the

game winner for W&L came just a
few minutes later when Papasavas
picked up a Miller pop-kick without
breaking stride and scored his sec-

ond try.

W&L collected its other victories
over U.Va., James Madison, Hamp-
den-Sydney, Old Dominion and VMI.
Their losses came at the hands of the
Roanoke Rugby Union and a pair
from VMI.

“It’s the best season since I’ve
been here,’ Jones, a junior, said.
Jones’ play on the Virginia Select
Side continues this weekend and next
with matches scheduled in Philadel-
phia and Delaware.

Scoring leaders during the fall for
the squad included Jones, Arthur,
Davis, Papasavas and P.J. lerardi.

Rugby play is expected to start
again the first week in March. Jones

said there are plans for the team to ,

go on a trip during the spring break,
but nothing definite has been arrang-
ed yet.

One-fifth of frosh midterms below 1.5

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

More than one-fifth of the freshman

, Class received midterm grade point

averages lower than 1.5, the ‘‘auto-

* matic rule’’ cutoff point for fresh-
. men

If a student’s grades fall below 1.5

at the end of his freshman year, the

’ automatic rule dictates that he con-

, Sequently ‘‘severs his connection
with the University.’

A student who fails to meet the

* minimum required G.P.A. at the end
, of any term is placed on academic
probation for the following term,
* meaning that he is eligible to parti-

cipate in only one extracurricular ac-
tivity

According to figures released this
week by Dean of Freshmen H. Ro-
bert Huntley, 79 freshmen, or 21 per-
cent of the class, fell below the 1.5
mark.

Since approximately 70 percent of
the class pledged fraternities, a large
number of those failing freshmen are
certainly in houses. University regu-
lations forbid the initiation of any
freshman with a G.P.A. lower than
1.9.

Although most fraternities provide
a ‘‘cold’’ test file and some informal
tutoring from upperclassmen, only a
few have concentrated programs to
assist pledges with academics.

One that does is Chi Psi, which has

“We also get pledges together with
brothers who are majoring in areas
in which pledges are having difficul-
ty,” said Chi Psi member George Bo-
ras.

Like Chi Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
has mandatory study halls for some
of its pledges. In addition, it has a
W&L law student who serves as a re-
sidential educational adviser

Third-year student Jim Kay’s posi-
tion is unique among W&L fraterni-
ties. He receives a monthly stipend
from the national SAE office

“Pledges under a 2.5 are required
to attend a study hall three nights a
week for several hours,”’ Kay said. ‘‘I
try to have an atmosphere that pro-

motes a couple hours of work a day.”

“T encourage them to study during
our C-School sessions, but I don’t
force them to study — they can sleep
if they want to.”’

Delta Tau Delta also has sought
outside assistance. ‘‘We had a couple

was one,”’ said Mike Marshall of
Delta Tau Delta.

“We also have a big brother pro-
gram to check up on their work as
well as to make tutoring available.”’

Sigma Phi Epsilon has found
another way to motivate pledges’

Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s adviser

study halls

‘Since I have already accepted a

me study as well, so I can hopefully
graduate. These guys get me to work
too.”

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Concert tomorrow
may typify future

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee student
activities pavilion will be back in ac-
tion tomorrow night when the Stu-
dent Activities Board presents a
Christmas concert featuring the Pro-
ducers and the White Animals.

This is the second concert in the
new structure, and, according to SAB
Entertainment Director John Hay-
wood, the pavilion is 90 percent com-
plete.

“The main thing people will notice
is the fact that the parking lot has not
been finished.’’ Haywood said.
“We're still encouraging people to
get there early and to carpool when-
ever possible.”’

One addition to the pavilion since
its inaugural event, the Homecoming
concert, is the nearly “‘indestructi-
ble’’ Mondoflex floor covering. This
addition will most certainly make the
concert a more enjoyable event for
all those in attendance.

One thing that has not changed
since the last concert is the closing of
the U.S. 60 entrance to the pavilion.
Haywood stressed that the only way
to enter and exit the pavilion is
through the road that leads to the
Law School.

The success of this concert will
have a bearing on the future enter-

Dec. Mesner trial

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read has re-
quested subpoenas for 34 indivi-
duals to testify at the trial of Scot
T. Mesner, the 19-year-old indict-
ed for arson and murder in con-
nection with last spring’s Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house
fire.

Mesner’s trial is scheduled for
Dec. 19-21 in Rockbridge County
Circuit Court.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John
is among those scheduled to be
called as witnesses.

Read has also requested sam-
ples of three types of hair from
Mesner, who has been held in
Rockbridge, County Jail since
Sept. 4.

tainment that the SAB will book into
the pavilion, Haywood said.

“Right now, we’re trying to deter-
mine the kind of bands the University
will support,’’ he added. ‘“‘We would
like to bring in more current national
acts, but we have to make sure that
the University will pay the higher
ticket price that is necessary to af-
ford those kinds of acts.”’

The addition of the new pavilion
has given the SAB the opportunity to
provide the kind of concerts that we
will be seeing Friday night.

“We could never have put on this
kind of show in the dining hall,”
Haywood said. ‘Phere isn’t enough
room in there to hold the number of
people we'll be seeing Friday night.”

Haywood added that because the
dining hall was only available to
them once a term, they had to plan
far in advance any concerts they
would provide. The Producers only
became available three and a half
weeks before Friday’s date and
never could have been booked back
in September, Haywood said.

‘“‘The emphasis of the pavilion is on
University wide events, but other
groups canuse the building,’ he said.

For the bargain basement price of
$75, a group can rent the building.
Messy groups beware, though, clean-
up costs are extra.

Haywood said the SAB will even
take care of the entertainment. ‘If a
group tells us what kind of act they
want and how much money they have
to spend, we will go out and book the
entertainment for them.”’

He added that the SAB will encour-
age inter-fraternity events in the
pavilion.

Local favorites The Nabobs will
open the concert promptly at 8:30
and will play a 45-minute set. The
Producers will start up at 9:30 sharp
and will play one long set until the
White Animals begin at 11:30. Hay-
wood said there will be a short break
between each band to prepare the
stage for the next act.

Tickets for the concert are $5 in ad-
vance and $6 at the door. Tickets are
available in the W&L Bookstore until
Friday afternoon at 4. Haywood said
he is encouraging people to buy their
tickets in advance. He added that
people with advance tickets will
move into the pavilion more quickly
than those who purchase tickets at
the door.

A’student glances at Larry Stene’s sculpture in the main lobby of the library.

‘Interesting...unconventional’

mystery, makes them curious and allows their mind to

fantasize.”

Among students in the library earlier this week, re-

 

action to ‘‘‘Fortress Flying” was mixed.

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Students entering the University Library this week
have expressed differing reactions toward the sculp-
ture greeting them in the main level lobby.

“It’s interesting to watch people come into the lobby,
to see their expressions and to hear their comments
about the sculpture,”’ said Bob Strickland, a junior who
works at the circulation desk.

The seulpture, ‘Fortress Flying,”’ by Larry Stene,
assistant professor of art, consists of a plywood frame,
glue and Vermont flooring slate. It weighs about 250
pounds and is four feet tall by three feet wide. The
pieces of slate had to be cut and beveled to create
Stene’s conception, he said, adding, ‘‘A lot of calisthe-
nics have to be done to get to the fun.”

Stene said the sculpture is not necessarily intended
to have any particular meaning.

“The neutrality of the ‘Fortress Flying’ pushes the
responsibility of what the piece means upon its audi-
ence,’’ Stene said. By displaying the sculpture in the
library, Stene explained that he thought more people
would be able tosee his work.

Stene said he believes that art should be created for
the reactions of people instead of for financial gain.

“Art is narcissistic,’’ he added, “with the idea of
coming back to the artist. A painter shouldn’t paint
pretty pictures to make money. His creations are put
out to generate response.”

The response — whether positive or negative — is
important to the artist, Stene said, because it is the on-
ly way he has of determining how the audience feels
about his work.

“The piece is only the catalyst,’ he explained.
‘When people look at that piece, I hope it’s like a good

 

“T could care less if it’s there or not,” freshman Bill
Lilly said. ‘‘It’s nice if it’s a donation.”

Another student, senior Mark Knobloch, said he en-
joyed the piece.

“It’s violent and energetic,’’ Knobloch added. “‘The
gaps in the slate provide intrigue into the three dimen-
sionality.”’

Several students said the sculpture seemed out of
place in the middle of the University Library.

“The way the library is set up, that area is not condu-
cive to having anything in it,’’ said senior Tom Imeson.
‘Where it is now, people won't stop to take the time to
look atit.”’

Strickland also said many students don’t even notice
the sculpture.

“A lot of students don’t want to be seen looking at
something so unconventional,”’ added Strickland, who
said he thinks the sculpture is great because “it looks
different from eachside.”’

University Librarian Maurice D. Leach said, “I’m
pleased to have something out there that people are in-
terested in.”

Stene said he was not especially surprised by W&L
students’ not noticing the sculpture because the Ameri-
can public and W&L students in general sometimes
have a limited, narrow view of art.

Some people ‘‘are conditioned to feel that they don’t
have the artist’s permission to interpret the piece,”’ he
added. The ideal situation, he said, would be when a
person looks at the sculpture and creates a world for it.

“IT want my artwork to be easy,”’ Stene said. ‘‘When
art gets taken out of the gallery and put into everyday
life, that’s when it can delight the most people.”’

 

 

ng investigated by EC

News Editor

 

Complaints about Virginia Military
Institute cadets using Washington
and Lee’s University Library and
abusing the privilege have been
reported to the Executive Commit-
tee, but the EC member investi-
gating the complaints said not much
can be done.

Junior representative Michael
Black brought the issue to the EC’s
attention three weeks ago. Black said
this week that, during midterms, he
asked a VMI cadet to move from a
conference room to a study carrell
Black said the cadet refused, claim-
ing that he was ‘‘there first.”’

“IT don’t mind them using the li
brary, but I just think around exam
time they stampede the library,’’
Black added. ‘‘They’re loud, and
some of them are not very consi-
derate of W&L students. I don’t real-
ly think they realize they’re guests
here.”

“T feel they’re abusing the privi
lege of using the W&L library,
especially around midterms and ex
ams,”’ he continued

Senior law representative Gordy
Hammock, a 1982 graduate of VMI,
said he will write a column for the
VMI newspaper and will ask student
and faculty leaders there to warn the
cadets that some people think a pro-
blem exists

Hammock also said that he will ask
VMI Commandant Col. John W
Cummings to inform the cadets in
writing that some complaints have
been made

“T think it'll have a little bit of
weight with them,’’ Hammock said

University Librarian Maurice
Leach said he hasn't heard of any
problems with cadets this year, but
that there are some problems when
both schools’ exams coincide and
W&L students complain that cadets
are using conference rooms or books
that they don’t think the cadets have
a right to

But Leach said that can't be helped

because of the agreement that allows
cadets touse W&L’s library, and vice
versa

“The policy is to create and breed
good will between the two institu-
tions,’ Leach said

“IT certainly would not advocate
denying the resources here to VMI
cadets any more than I would a law
student who comes over here,’’ he
said

Black also reported that cadets
often talk rather than study in the
library

‘As far as we can see in the li
brary,’’ Leach said, ‘‘there is no pro-
blem in that area.”’

Although there was a problem with
noise in the library last year, that
seems to have been solved this year,
Leach said

“The test will really be when our
exams take place,”’ he said

William Sargeant and Steven Me
deiros, two of about 20 cadets who ap
peared to be studying quietly in the
library Monday night, said they find

OPINION

 

Crying foul

On page 5 of a University of Virginia honor system pam-
phlet is a quotation from the university’s founding father,
Thomas Jefferson:

‘‘Never suppose that in any possible situation or under any
circumstances that it is best for you to do a dishonorable
thing however slightly so it may appear to you.”

Oh?

Witness the case of one Olden Polynice, a sophomore (or,
as they’d say in Charlottesville, second-year student) accus-
ed of an honor violation for turning in another student’s Eng-
lish paper as his own last spring.

During a 21-hour closed honor trial two weekends ago,
Polynice admitted to turning in the other student’s paper,
according to accounts last week in The Washington Post,
which quoted ‘knowledgeable sources.”’ (At U.Va., as at
W&L, an honor trial is closed unless the accused wishes it to
be open. )

The case, however, did not end there. You see, Polynice
also happens to play basketball at U.Va. and is an integral
member of a team that went to the much coveted Final Four
last year.

At his honor trial, Polynice, his counsel and U.Va. head
basketball coach Terry Holland argued that pressure from
the coaching staff for Polynice to complete his work for the
course led him to turn in another student’s paper as his own,
according to the Post. They further said that Polynice was
not attempting to defraud U.Va.’s grading system.

Although we cannot condone Polynice’s apparently dishen-
orable action, we do realize the pressures a 19-year-old univ-
ersity student sometimes faces. And those pressures are
even more intense if that student is a highly recruited
member of a major college basketball team (or team in any
other sport, for that matter).

But that is not the point. The point is that Polynice, if the
Post’s account is accurate, committed an honor violation. At
U.Va., as at Washington and Lee, the only punishment for a
student found guilty of an honor violation is expulsion.

Olden Polynice, however, is still at U.Va. and still playing
basketball(in Hawaii last weekend). He is retaking that elu-
sive English composition course.

We could argue about the evils of big-time athletics and the
problems that occur when student/athletes place too much

emphasis on the latter half of that combination. But we’ll
leave those arguments to the sports page.

More germane to Washington and Lee, where sports, we
hope, will never play such a dominant role, is the honor
aspect of this case. To be convicted of an honor violation at
U.Va., a student must not only have committed the act, but
he must have done so intentionally and willingly, and the act
must have been ‘‘a serious enough breach of trust to warrant
permanent expulsion{from the University.”’ .

The 12-student jury that heard Polynice’s case apparently
decided that because of the pressures placed on him by the

basketball team, he really did not mean to commit an honor
violation and his violation was not serious enough to warrant
his expulsion.

An honor system — a true honor system — can work only as
long as honor is not measured in degrees. We can under-
stand, at least in part, the requirement of intent at U.Va. The
requirement of seriousness, however, essentially makes one
honor violation more or less dishonorable than another

The lesson for the guardians of the honor system at
Washington and Lee is that honor cannot — indeed, must not

- be measured in degrees. Either a student is honorable or

he is not, and the only punishment must be meted out accor-

dingly. Honor measured in degrees cannot be called honor.

The University of Virginia seems to have forgotten the wise
words of its founder. Let us always remember them.

‘A Trivial Pursuit’

We promise to leave her alone eventually, but before we
do:
eLisa Birnbach’s College Book was panned in the recent
edition of Newsweek On Campus as “‘A Trivial Pursuit’’ for
‘‘(e)onnoisseurs of trashy where-to-go-to-school manuals.”
Warning readers that they’d better attack Birnbach’s book
‘“‘armed with several shakers of salt,’’ reviewer Neal Karlen
writes that the book “‘turns out to be a poorly written, over-
generalized mess that should be banned from all high-school
guidance counselor offices.’’ We couldn’t agree more.

eAnd in the good news, bad news dept., we noted last week
that a hometown bookstore not only had shelved the book
with other college guides, such as Peterson’s and The New
York Times, but also with the humor books (that’s ‘“‘Beyond
The Far Side’’). The former obviously was a mistake, and the
latter is, at best, a generous classification.

A challenge to reclaim legacy

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

Just when educators thought that
the government was going to stop
criticizing their performance, Wil-
liam J. Bennett, chairman of that lof-
ty-sounding institution, the National
Endowment for the Humanities, re-
leases a report decrying the sharp
decline in humanities studies in U.S.
colleges and universities in the last
decade. According to Bennett, the sit-
uation has taken such a severe turn
for the worse that students graduate
‘lacking even the most rudimentary
knowledge about the foundations of
their nation and their civilization.”

Now that should come as little sur-
prise to the majority of educators
and thinkers on campuses today.

 

   

Classical studies dealing with An-
cient Greece and Rome just aren’t
what everyone wants to take. Philo-
sophy is the major for left-over ’60s
freaks. And while European history,
English, modern languages and mu-
sic may be “‘fun” courses, they really
have little to do with our everyday
lives, or so thinks today’s practical
student generation as they sign up for
yet another business course.

The trend toward ‘“‘practical’’ edu-
cations and away from the liberal
arts tradition is a serious dilemma
for educators and students alike, for
it signals two very dangerous trends
in our society.

First, it points to the short-sighted
nature of educational curriculums to-
day. Students choose business or
other pre-professional majors be-
cause that is how graduates get jobs.

 

  

To put it in the colloquial, ‘‘That is
where the jobs are.’’ Recruiters,
while singing the praises of being
able to read, write and think clearly
that come as the result of the liberal
arts education, nonetheless hire the
business student because he or she
has the better grasp of what is involv-
ed in the world called ‘‘business.”’
Recruiters, and advisers alike, need
to realize that the best education is
not always that which best prepares
a certain student to think in a certain
way, but that which best prepares
him to think.

But secondly, and most important-
ly, students today no longer are pre-
sented with the challenge early in
education to consider the precedent
for living set forth by the Homers,

of our life. We are encouraged to

For decency’s sake

To the Editors:

It was particularly disturbing to
read in The Phi (‘Will June bicenten-
nial go unobserved?” Nov. 8) that the
administration is planning to cele-
brate the 200th anniversary of the
first commencement exercises in
September. Commencement exerci-
ses honor the graduating class. The
class of 1985 will graduate in June,
not September. I realize that the
commencement ceremonies in 1785
were held in that month, but it is nec-
essary to note that this was due to the
fact that the academic year ended
then.

One is tempted to ask why the ad-
ministration would then choose to
celebrate in September? The gradu-
ates of 1985 will have been three mon-
ths absent, and mortarboards and di-
plomas will have been put away. The
reason seems to lie in the administra-
tion’s desire to have the celebrations
further fuel the media attention ac-
companying the arrival of coeds; in
short, a cheap publicity stunt.

President Wilson promised the
W&L community that the move to co-
education would be handled with pro-
per decorum and grace. Here, how-
ever, is a glaring example of disre-
gard for both. When President Wilson
was asked what quality he associated
with W&L, he responded ‘‘decency.”’
Here the administration seems more

Correction

Due to an editing error, an article
on coeducation in the Nov. 15 Ring-
tum Phi misstated the background of
Hollins College Dean of the Faculty
Wendy Fairey. Fairey was the Dean
of Students at Bowdoin College when
it began admitting women and was
the Associate Dean of the Faculty at
Barnard College at the time it was
considering closer academic ties
with Columbia University

than willing to sacrifice decency in
favor of a publicity gimmick, an ex-
tremely regrettable attitude indeed.
For decency’s sake, I urge the ad-
ministration to reconsider. Would it
not be far better to honor our gradu-
ates and our history? Only then, it
seems, can the idea of continuity bet-
ween the old and the new be express-
ed in a fair, equitable and decent
manner, The cheap and the shoddy
do not belong to W&L, neither to the
old nor the new.

Narrow attitudes
exit with women

1o the Editors:

Until I read the Nov. 1 copy of The
Ring-tum Phi, I had concurred with
my husband and his friends (Class of
’41) that indeed there is a place for
small men’s colleges, and it is a
shame that W&L has had to change
its tradition. Now, however, since I
found numerous examples of a nar-
row attitude toward minority groups,
bigotry toward women in politics,
and a ‘‘me only’’ concern, perhaps
women will give some of the compas-
sion and intellectual competition that
is needed to the males at Mr. Lee’s
University. They may even aid the
more enlightened members of the
faculty in conveying the message
that materialism and chauvinism
will not erase the very dangerous
international and national problems
that they will face. Your editorial
was excellent.

Thank you for allowing me to ex-
press these views.

MY
VIEW

By Ben Hale

 

 

A few weeks ago, Timothy Lea-
ry came and spoke to a large gath-
ering in Lee Chapel. I was on the
front row, considering myself luc-
ky to be hearing this famous con-
troversial character. Since that
night, I have been reflecting on
just why I was so lucky. I did
benefit from the Leary experi-
ence: He said some interesting
and amusing things about my gen-
eration, he emphasized the reality
of the computer age and he spark-
ed that urge in me to live, to ex-
perience, to accomplish. The
catch is that I can hear interesting
observations— can be stirred
—from almost any professor here,
in any decent seminar. The con-
clusion: We paid several thousand
dollars just to have a famous per-
son in Lee Chapel. What, then, is
the philosophy behind our speak-
ers program?

Three years ago, we paid a
great deal of money to hear attor-
ney F. Lee Bailey talk about a
cashless society — a speech any

 

 

think of great works because they are
great, and not for what makes them
great. In short, by the time we reach
college education, we are not really
prepared for the demanding choices
we must make in the curricular
realm. Planning a four-year educa-
tion is not a trivial matter, not should
it be a trivial pursuit. A proper edu-
cation involves much more than
merely taking the required and then

“easy A” classes. It involves far
more of an intellectual ‘‘meeting of
the minds”’ than that.

To a certain degree, we at Wash-
ington and Lee are exempt from
some of the charges made by Bennett
in his report. Freshmen this year will
be required to have some proficiency
in a modern language through at
least the second year, to have taken a
lab science course, to have thought
carefully about world literature, to
have delved into the thoughts of scho-
lars in the areas of history, philoso-
phy and religion and to have consid-
ered the ramifications of the social
sciences. We have a tightly-knit core
curriculum that requires students
both to consider the humanities and
to be proficient in them.

But our curriculum is unlike that of
the vast majority of American col-
leges and universities. As part of the
farcical ‘‘education reforms’’ that
came as a result of our real days of
shame in the 60s, colleges tended to
de-emphasize the required curricu-
lum, encouraging students instead to
think for themselves in deciding on
courses for study. Now, educators
have realized the mistake that was
and continues to be, as more and
more graduates enter the work force
with little knowledge of their heri-
tage. I'm certainly not encouraging
military-like requirements for to-
day’s studies, but a better guide to
college education on the behalf of ad-
ministrators and faculty alike is in
high demand today. Like the title of
Bennett’s report, higher education
has a challenge — ‘‘To Reclaim a Le-

gacy.”

Flashbacks

Leary bigger hit
than other stars

senior politi.., ..unomics or soc-
iology major could have con-
structed. We also paid, in that
same year, a great deal of money
to hear Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy put on his show
(which is basically to shock peo-
ple with his crass views). I think if
Liddy or Bailey came today,
they’d get the same crowds and
support they got then. Even as I
write this, Iam unsure about what
conclusion to draw. I think this
demonstrates something about
our intellectual fervor — or our
level of genuine cyriosity.

This sounds awfully pompous,
since we all certainly like to see
and hear famous people. But it
seems that we ought to face up to
being a university. That we are
here to learn and grow ought to
have some influence on all that we
do — especially the student spon-
sored speakers forums. The show-
biz attitude we have about inviting
people to come to speak to us only
illustrates the overall lack of in-
tellectual purpose among us.

I don’t suggest that we bring in
ap obscure professor from some
Arkansas junior college. We can
and should certainly bring in sig-
nificant people — who have some-
thing to say that we need and want
to hear.

In August, the four bloodhounds,
Straining at their leashes, searched
the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, a
* poolside in Los Angeles and a beach
,in Puerto Rico, all the while asking
“‘Where’s Dee?”

In late October, having tracked
.down Dee Huddleston, the blood-
hounds chased him over fences and
‘through forests, asking why he'd
,earned $50,000 in honorariums and
had missed many votes important to
*his constituents.

, Those two campaign commercials

helped turn around a U.S. Senate

Republican Mitch McConnell a sur-

In addition to working for the Mc-

going to tune in to an NBA basketball
game, tune in to the last 15 minutes
and you'll get the whole thing. That’s
sometimes the way it is in politics.”

Such was the case in Kentucky,
where tracking polls showed Huddle-
ston ahead of McConnell through
Nov. 2, four days before the election.

‘“‘We were never in this race,’’ Tar-
rance said, but once McConnell be-
gan to close the gap, the Huddleston
campaign reacted too slowly. Again
comparing the situation to a basket-
ball game, Tarrance added that it
was the equivalent of when one team
has a big lead but toward the end of
the game commits a lot of turnovers.
Then, at the buzzer, “the other guy
shoots it from halfcourt and sinks it.
That’s about the way McConnell won
in Kentucky.”

On a national level, Tarrance said,
“the election was a big one for the
Republicans this time, but it was a
big one for the Democrats 24 months
ago.”

This does not signal any kind of
major realignment, Tarrance added.
“We tend to overplay realignment
talk. You don’t change your party
very quickly and I think you do it in
less than perfect ways.”

Despite all of the research that
goes into a campaign, though, Tar-
rance said voting ‘ is ‘‘the most com-
plex psychological decision you can
make. Think, for a minute, how
many dynamics go into that decision
... even though we try to quantify it
every day in our business, it’s an
emotional act.”

‘Bar group completes study;
‘release of report uncertain

The committee appointed by the

’ Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar

, Association to investigate ‘the order-

ly administration of justice in Rock-

* bridge County” has completed its

, Study.

Bar Association president J. Todd

..’ Jones said he has received the re-

, port, but declined any comment on

the document's contents or whether

it will be released to the public or the
, barassociation.

The next regular meeting of the
"bar association is scheduled for Jan.
» 14. Jones said a special meeting has
not been called.

Jones appointed the committee last
» March at the direction of the bar as-
sociation. The group ordered forma-
* tion of the five-member committee at
« the same time it adopted a resolution
containing information about the
* rights of witnesses appearing before
» the special grand jury that investi-
gated local drug trafficking earlier
* this year,
« The resolution said the committee
should consult local courts, law en-
" forcement agencies, lawyers and cit-
« izens in preparing a report and re-
commendations for the bar assovia-
* tion president.
Members of the committee have
said they received little response to a
" questionnaire that was mailed to a
» number of community officials and

.

.

 

citizens earlier this year.

Several committee members indi-
cated this week that the report may
not necessarily ever be released.

“‘T’m not aware of any plans to take
up the report in a regular bar meet-
ing,’’ Louise P. Moore said.

“I don’t think there’s been a deter-
mination’’ of whether or not the re-
port will be made public or presented
to the bar association, H. David Nat-
kin added.

Natkin said he learned from the
study ‘‘that people take a great deal
of interest in the way criminal justice
works, and a number of people want-
ed to comment about the way the
criminal justice system functions in
the community.”

“It’s in Mr. Jones’ hands right now
and I don’t know what he plans
to do with it,”’ said Washington and
Lee law professor J. Timothy Phil-
ipps. ‘“‘Our charge was to present a
report to the bar association presi-
dent. We've given it to him and now
he has to decide what todo with it.”

Philipps said the report is eight or
nine pages. He said as far as he
knows there is only the original and
one copy, both of which were deliver-
ed to Jones.

Shuler A. Kizer declined comment

on the report and Eric L. Sisler could
not be reached.

New scale may help some

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The addition of the A-plus to the Washington and Lee
University grading system actually may improve some
students’ chances of getting into the law schools of their

According to Bruce Sherman of the Law School Data
Assembly Service, which sends scaled reports of stu-
dents’ grades to law schools, the LSDAS assigns the
same number values to grades as Washington and Lee.

‘*Most schools that have the A-plus give only a 4.0,”
explained Sherman, but the LSDAS would scale this up
to a 4.33. Before the fall of 1983, W&L did not use any
pluses or minuses in its grading system, so the highest
grade any student could receive from the LSDAS was a
4.0. Students from schools which gave A-pluses could
receive 4.33s, so Sherman said it is possible that this
may have hurt some W&L students.

According to Edward O. Henneman, Associate Dean
of Law at W&L, the LSDAS sends the law schools a pac-
ket containing the student’s scaled grades, yearly and
cumulative GPA’s, a copy of the student’s transcript,
information on how the student ranks in his own school
and results from the Law School Admissions Test.

Chemistry Professor Michael A. Pleva said he believ-
ed the new system at W&L is more of the norm. A
spokesperson for the Centralized Admissions Service
(which performs a service similar to the LSDAS for stu-
dents interested in medical school) refused to comment
about their scaling system.

“‘T have always graded with pluses and minuses and
then had to translate them into whole grades,”’ said
journalism Professor Robert J. deMaria, who added
that he does not believe in the A-plus.

“In very, very, very exceptional cases...you will find
somebody who is an A-plus student,” said deMaria, but
according to results presented in the 1983-84 Registrar’s
Report, other professors think differently.

WA&L gave out 312 A-pluses during the 1983-84 school
year. The military science department gave out the
most A-pluses with 45, followed by history with 35, art
with 34 and music with 33.

Tom Withenbury, assistant director of admissions for
Sweet Briar College, said the Amherst women’s college
recently switched its highest grade from an A-plus
downtoanA.

The Sweet Briar faculty decided that an A should be
the highest grade a student could receive, Withenbury
said.

“The key to the exam period is bud-
geting your time correctly and using
your free time wisely,’’ said senior
Glen Jackson, who is the head of stu-
dent recruitment.

As a means of mental relaxation,
Jackson recommends taking an hour
off from studying to work out in the
weight room or to run.

Last Tuesday, Ted LeClercq, a
dorm counselor in Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory, held a meeting for the fresh-
men on his hall. One of the topics
discussed was the exam period.

LeClercq recommends scheduling
exams with adequate time in be
tween for preparation.

“It’s always a bad plan to take ex-
ams on consecutive days...your mind
needs a break while it’s changing
gears,”’ he said. ‘‘If you have four ex-
ams, don’t rush and leave by Wed-
nesday.”

The counselor believes that, by the
end of the examination period, a stu-
dent’s level of concentration has di-
minished significantly from the be-
ginning of the week.

WLUR-FM to feature
its own radio drama

 

By PEDRO CARROLL
Staff Reporter

 

One of the front-page headlines for
The Ring-tum Phi of March 11, 1938,
was ‘‘Prep Schools Invade Campus.”
The next day, Hitler invaded Austria.
Two Phi editions later, the front page
included ‘“Troubadours Promise Ex-
plosion When ‘Blonde Bombshell’ En-
ters’’ and ‘‘Riegel Says World War Is
Already Being Fought.”’

Two Washington and Lee sopho-
mores, Eric Knight and Mike Wacht,
have traveled back in time to that era
to produce ‘‘The Daredevils,” a 13-
episode radio drama that will be
broadcast on the student radio sta-
tion, WLUR-FM.

“It’s a mixture of Dashiell Ham-
met, Raymond Chandler, Indiana
Jones, Alfred Hitchcock and some of
the movie serials from the 1930s,”’ ex-
plained Knight, who wrote the script.

The script contains 27 characters
— 23 males and four females. Stu-
dents from Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College will perform the fe-
male roles. Auditions were held ear-
lier this month.

“This is an independent project,”’
Wacht said. ‘‘We haven’t received
any funding from any campus organ-
ization. We have had some help from
some faculty members giving us ad-

vice. The final decision, however, is
ours.”’

Richard Asher, an American ar-
cheologist, is the central character,
who is in quest of a missing sap-
phire. He journeys from England to
China during his search, which, coin-
cidentally, begins on March 12, 1938
— the day that Hitler invaded
Austria. Junior Jim Strader will play
the role.

The radio-serial style was followed
during the production of the script.
Knight, the script writer and direc-
tor, said he created dialogue that
does not ‘‘insult a person’s intellect.”

All of the stories will be self-ex-
planatory, according to Knight. He
said that no narrator will be used.
However, each episode will end in a
cliffhanger. One of the major goals of
Wacht and Knight is to have the pro-
gram sound authentic.

Knight researched and worked on
the script during the summer. He in-
terviewed people who had actually
lived during that period to obtain
realistic dialogue. Faculty reactions
to the script have been encouraging,
according to Knight.

“We'll be recording in the Cable
Nine studios,’’ Wacht said. ‘‘We’ll
have more room there for our actors
to move around,”’

Production will begin this week-
end. The first shows will be aired in
mid-January.

School’s candlelight service

Washington and Lee University’s
annual Christmas candlelight ser-
vice will be held next Thursday, Dec.
6, at 7:30 p.m. in R.E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church.

The traditional service will feature
the nine lessons and carols that cover
sacred history from the creation to
the birth of Christ.

Members of the Washington and

est one on either Saturday or Mon-
day,”’ LeClercq said.

Jackson, however, disagrees that
students should take their hardest ex-
am first for the simple reason that
most are usually working up until
Friday.

The hardest exam should be sched-
uled sometime in the middle of the
week, according to Jackson. Fresh-
men need a chance to ‘‘get used to the
experience,” he said.

“T like to take the hardest ones
first, spreading them out from Satur-
day afternoon through Friday if I
have four of them,” said Student
Body President Cole Dawson.

“T think it’s silly for people to rush
through them just so they’ll have

Lee faculty and student body will
read the lessons, and student and
community musicians will provide |
the carols. W&L senior Warren Tay-
lor will be the organist.

An offering will be collected and
donated to the community winter
clothing drive.

The service, sponsored by the
University Federation at W&L, will
be open to the public.

Exam scheduling strategies differ

more vacation, because tnen you re
so burned out that you can’t do well.”

Of course, in most cases, a student
may change a scheduled exam with
permission of his professor.

However, LeClercq believes that
the system practiced by the history
and philosophy departments should
apply to the entire University.

These departments allow students
to take their examinations on any
day at either time (on Saturday at 2
p.m.) without having pre-scheduled
them.

Jackson said he believes that such
a system might ‘‘put too much pres-
sure on the freshmen’’ and that many
would wait until the end of the week
before taking their exams.

Two new WAL scholarships
started in honor of Latture

The Rupert Nelson Latture
Scholarship has been created to re-
cognize the ‘extraordinarily long
years of devotion and service to
Washington and Lee” of Rupert N.
Latture, emeritus professor of polit-
ics.

Latture, who walks to the Alumni
House each morning to greet visitors,
will be 93 in January.

The scholarship is to be awarded
annually to a deserving student who
requires assistance to attend the
University.

Mr. and Mrs. William E. Latture of
Greensboro, N.C., have established
the endowed scholarship in honor of
William Latture’s father.

The scholarship is the second to be
established in Latture’s honor re-
cently. Earlier, the Delta Upsilon
fraternity made a gift to the universi-
ty for a scholarship honoring Lat-
ture.

“Professor Latture has _ contri-
buted in so many important ways to
Washington and Lee that it is only ap-
propriate that he be honored in a
manner that will contribute so mean-
ingfully to future generations of W&L
students,’’ President John D. Wilson
said.

William Latture has served W&L
as a director and treasurer of the

W&L Alumni Board, as a class agent
for the Class of 1949, and as president
of the Greensboro, N.C., area alumni
chapter. He is a retired director of
Blue Bell Inc. in Greensboro.

A 1915 graduate of W&L, Rupert
Latture remains active on the cam-
pus. He was formerly head of the po-
litical science department at W&L.
After his retirement from teaching in
1962, he served as special adviser to
the president.

Movie slated

The Film Society will present
“Blood Wedding,” a film from Span-
ish director Carlos Saura, on Friday
and Saturday.

The film will be shown at 8 p.m.
both evenings in Classroom A of
Lewis Hall, the W&L law school
building. There is no charge for
admission. The film is in Spanish
with English subtitles.

“Blood Wedding” is based on Fed-
erico Garcia Lorca’s play ‘“‘Bodas de
sangre.” Richard Grefe, faculty ad-
viser to the W&L Film Society, notes
that the film is ‘‘a masterful blending
of drama, dance and film, realized by
director Saura and
dancer/choreographer Antonio
Gades.”’

" University photographer W. Patrick Hinely with his award-winning

photograph.

 

By ANTHONY CORNEALIUS
Staff Reporter

 

On July 4, 1971, while at a party at
Bear Farm near Lexington, a young
rookie photographer armed with a
Nikon ventured about the area to see
what he could see. Soon the sun
began to set. Then, suddenly, he
noticed a cat jump on a fence near a
tree. He watched inquisitively as the
cat, in the light of the sun, began to
stretch and cur! its tail. Fascinated,
the young man took a few pictures of
the scene. Little did he realize that
when the photos were developed
several weeks later, his life would be
changed completely.

Thirteen years later, Patrick Hine-
ly, the rookie photographer is now
the University photographer and still
believes ‘That first moment of
awakening...photography doesn’t
merely have to fulfill a function, it is
something vou can do for your own

Law student queries
White on his survey

 

'
By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

A survey distributed in the Law
School three weeks ago by Executive
Committee Vice President James
White was harshly questioned by a

~iaw student during Monday night’s
EC meeting.

Alice Sacks, a second-year law stu-
‘dent, said some law students were
concerned about how the results of
the survey would be used by the EC,
‘because the answers to the questions
might not be an accurate reflection of
Law School sentiment.

* The survey — which contained
questions on how law students felt
about the honor system, the new fis-
‘cal separation between the EC and
the Student Bar Association, and un-
dergraduate-run student activities
‘_was perceived in part as trying to
undermine the Law School’s vote last

ear on a referendum to make the

BA’s budget separate from that of
vindergraduate organizations, Sacks
said.

* Sacks’

.

complaint, which began

with a request that senior represen-
tative David Jonson remove his feet
from the table so she could see his
face, came about 10 minutes after
SBA President John Sicilian said that
the fiscal agreement made between
the governing bodies of the two
schools was working out, and that the
EC has been ‘‘doing a very good job.”

Sacks said that there was a possibi-
lity that the information that might
be gleaned from the survey is not
valid.

“People didn’t know if (the survey)
was serious or not,”’ Sacks said.

The reason for that, according to
Sacks, is that when questions about
the survey were brought to EC law
representatives Gordy Hammock
and James Crutchfield, neither knew
about it.

“‘We elected Gordy and James as
our reps,’’ Sacks said, ‘‘and we want
to know why they didn’t know about
ag

White said he distributed the
survey without notifying the other
EC members, but that he did it in
good faith simply to get an under-

standing of law school opinion. White
said the survey produced a high
response rate.

“After all these law school issues
came out, I just had an idea to make
a poll,’’ White explained. ‘‘I just took
it upon myself to doa questionnaire.”

“T didn’t know James was doing
it,’’ EC President Cole Dawson said,
“‘but I thought it was well done.”’

In other action, the EC voted to
freeze the Business Office funds of
Contact, the W&L Film Society, the
Ski Club and the International Club
for not presenting budget reports.

Crutchfield suggested that the
members of the student organiza-
tions receiving student body funds be
brought in and told when their budget
reports are due, since the question
was raised as to whether the organi-
zations knew when to report.

Also, senior representative Bob
Tomaso suggested that a section of
the White Book be revised to make it
clear that the confidentiality of honor
hearings applies to all students, not
just EC members. The subject was
tabled for a week.

enjoyment.”

He has also abandoned the Nikon
for a Leica, married and improved
his skills. In fact, he recently won the
Grand Prize for Jazz Photo of 1984,
sponsored by the International Jazz
Association and Jazz Forum, among
various other groups. The winning
photo of Sonny Rollins was said to
embody the meaning of jazz.

Hinely, a W&L graduate, has a
keen interest in jazz, and this interest
led him to shooting some photos for
various album covers after deciding
that the old covers he had seen were
terrible.

“TI thought I could do better than
the relatives (of the band members)
that took them...and felt...that I
could help the musician in a way,”’ he
said. Many of the photos have been
used, mostly by jazz and contempor-
ary classical groups. In regards to
his personal style and taste, Hinely
said he tries to model himself after

The Rockbridge Orchestra and
Chorus will give its first concert of
the 1984-85 season Saturday at 8 p.m.
in VMI’s Jackson Memorial Hall.
The chorus and orchestra are cele-
brating their tenth anniversary sea-
son this year.

Also, the Rockbridge Youth Or-
chestra and Dance Ensemble will
perform the next day at Lexington
High School at 3 p.m.

The four groups are sponsored by
the Rockbridge Fine Arts Workshop.

The adult orchestra, directed by
Dr. Ben Wright of Harrisonburg, will
perform Beethoven’s Overture to
The Creatures of Prometheus, the
Overture to Christophe Gluck’s opera
Iphigenia in Aulis, and Sir Edward
Elgar’s “Chanson de Nuit” and
“Chanson de Matin.”

The chorus, directed by Dr. Gordon
Spice, a Washington and Lee music
professor, will then join Wright and
the orchestra and perform Franz
Schubert’s Mass in E-F lat, which the
composer completed four months be-
fore his death. Soloists will be Char-
les Bodie, Ruth Floyd, Tim Gaylard,
Bruce Herrick, Spice, Norma Stotz
and Agnes Swope.

son, Bresson is an international pho-
to-jouralist who snapped pictures of
many of the great moments in his-
tory, according to Hinely.

However, Bresson’s finest photos
came from his shots of everyday peo-
ple. ‘‘He tried to capture people in
what he called ‘The decisive moment
where people are organized in a per-
fect shape of relationships that yield
the strongest image,’ "’ Hinely ex-
plained.

Hinely strives for the technique
through his isolation of realistic, yet
surrealistic, events. He maintains
that once something so simple and
commonplace is seen by itself, it may
say something profound or make a
joke.

Another aspect of his creative sim-
plicity is his use of black and white
film. He explained that this type of
film is easy to work with and that the
use of contrasts and composition are
easier to define in the darkroom. One
problem that he does face as a

tribution of $2 per adult, $1 per stu-
dent or $5 per family to help support
the activities of the chorus and
orchestra, which also are made pos-
sible by grants from the National En-
dowment for the Arts, the Virginia
Commission for the Arts, the County
of Rockbridge and by gifts from the
United Virginia Bank and other busi-
nesses, organizations and _individ-
uals.

The Youth Orchestra, with about 25
members, is under the direction of
first-vear conductor David Driesen,

photographer, however, is catching
someone in his particular role and
the relationships of that role to
others.

“It’s like seeing each individual
element for what it is, but being able
to see them all in relationship to one
another at the right time and picce is
hard,”’ he said.

His tastes are also simple, yet
amazingly creative. His affection for
musicians, unusual art and everyday
life all fit his everyday lifestyle. “I
am satisfied just by working and en-
joying the results,’ he said. He said
he even finds childish pleasure when
just simply seeing the first print of a
good shot, and realizing that he got
what he wanted. Some of his other
goals are becoming a freelance
photographer, publishing a few
books, teaching, and taking the
perfect picture, which he feels that
he maybe on the verge of doing.

“‘T have to keep moving in order to
find it, though,”’ he said.

upset no. 4
Hopkins

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team began its 1984-85 season
last week with two impressive vic-
tories over cross-town rival VMI and
highly touted Johns Hopkins

In the first victory over the Key-
dets the Generals won 62-51 in Cy
Twombly Pool. Outstanding perfor-
mances came from freshman Simon
Perez, who won the 100-yard and 500-
yard freestyle, and junior Tim Stan-
ford, who won the 100-yard butterfly
in 52.63, an NCAA Division III cham-
pionship qualifying time.

The second victory came last Sat-
urday, when Johns Hopkins, ranked
number four in the nation, came to
Twombly Pool for a dual meet. Until
this meet, the Generals had never
beaten Johns Hopkins. Last year’s
team lost by only a point, but this
year the Generals won . 66-47.

“Tam a little shocked by the mar-
gin of victory over Hopkins, but I
knew we had some outstanding ta-
lent,’ said Coach Page Remillard.
‘We were up for this one, and we per-
formed very well. Now I would like to
see us keep it up.”

Cagers fall to 2-2
after H-SC defeat

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team saw its record fall to 2-2
after losing 91-76 at Hampden-Syd-
ney College Tuesday night.

The Generals trailed by only five
points, 37-32, at halftime, but the blis-
tering shooting by the fast-breaking
Tigers proved to be teo much for
W&L to handle in the second half.

Hampden-Sydney connected on
65.5 percent of its field goal attempts,
including a 74.2 percentage from the
floor during the second half.

W&L was led by freshman guard
Steve Hancock’s 26 points. Hancock
continued to go on a shooting tear,
hitting 12 of 15 from the field and two
of three from the line. Hancock’s
field goal percentage for the season
stands ata red-hot 76.9 percent.

Senior co-captain Scott Shannon
added 18 points for the Generals and
guard Bill Yates chipped in 13 points.

As a team, W&L shot 47.9 percent
from the field for the game.

H-SC used a balanced scoring at-
tack against W&L, with nine players
scoring six or more points.

In earlier action, the Generals
opened their 1984-85 campaign by
capturing first place in the W&L Tip-
Off Tournament played Nov, 16-17 in
Lexington.

The Generals defeated Alfred

(N.Y.) University 74-58 in their open-
ing game Friday night. Senior guard
Lex Fitzenhagen scored 16 points
against the Saxons to lead all W&L
scorers. Shannon tallied 14 points and
sophomore Jeff Harralson added 10
toward the Generals’ effort.

In the tournament championship
game on Saturday night, the Gene-
rals turned back York (Pa.) College,
57-52. W&L led the Spartans, who had
defeated the Red Devils of Dickinson
College the night before, at the half
by a count of 27-25. The Generals pull-
ed away from York in the second half
on the strength of senior guard David
Wilkinson’s seven points and
maintained their lead thanks to the
clutch free-throw shooting of Yates
late in the game. The senior canned
eight of 10 attempts from the charity
Stripe on the evening. Yates led
General scorers with 16 points. Shan-
non added 15 points. He was also
named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player and was joined on
the All-Tournament team by Wilkin-
son.

The Generals suffered their first
loss of the season on Nov. 20 against
Salisbury State, falling to the Sea
Gulls by a 90-74 final score.

W&L trailed by 25 points, 45-20, at
halftime before fighting back to a 12-
point deficit late in the game at 84-72.

Student-athlete?

..Well, taking a cue from Phi
bossman Bruce Potter and the edi-
torial page, I, too, will take my shots
at the Olden Polynice affair. It is the
classic case to illustrate that when it
comes to NCAA Division I there is
something rotten in Denmark, bet-
ter make that Charlottesville (and
any other city that is the home of
tig-time college athletics).

Seems last spring old Olden turned in an English paper that (hor-
rors!) he didn’t happen to write (Read, unless you’re on the U.Va.
Honor Committee: Plagiarism). Our friends at The Washington Post
said last week that Terry (call me ‘‘Gutless’’) Holland, the Cavs’
hoops coach, testified in the honor (?) trial that poor Olden was receiv-
ing pressure from the team’s coaches (who are they?) that he com-
plete his work in the class.

The feeling in this corner is that athletes in high-pressure college
programs are allowed to be, more often than not, barely students.
Granted, this may be an isolated slip in the academic career of Mr.
Polynice. His grades may be well above standard, but his academic
standing is not at issue here. What is, is the fact that (and we’ll have to
assume the truth here) coaches were putting pressure on a student-
athlete to meet minimum course requirements.

A recent study by the NCAA of freshmen athletes at Division I
schools shows that they “‘perform as well in the classroom as
freshman nonathletes with comparable academic backgrounds,”’ ac-
cording to The NCAA News. The News also notes however that ‘‘the
study did not compare the types of courses taken by the athletes and
nonathletes.’’ The problem? The pressures of big-time college
athletics has reached a point where coaches are more or less forced to
produce results at whatever the cost. One need only look at Florida’s
problems earlier this year to see that wins and losses have reached
such a high place that an athlete as a student has become a secondary
thought.

These very talented individuals are viewed in terms of their four
years at the school as opposed to their 40 years outside of the school in
too many cases. Olden Polynice is part of this epidemic in an in-
teresting way. Because he and others like him are viewed as usable
objects in so many instances, it is conceivable that their self image is
one that allows them to forget about their responsibilities. As well, too
often they are allowed to get by as athletes oniy. Look at all the “hard-
ship” cases in recent years.

The big-time college athlete has come to see himself as a
marketable athlete too often. And the responsibility for that unfor-
tunate state of affairs, my friends, lies with coaches. And, Terry
Holland, that means more than a mandate to your players to get their
work done. It means a genuine and maintained interest in what your
players are doing outside of the team. Dean Smith’s move in couseling
Michael Jordan to forego his final college season to make his living in
the pros was sensible on one hand but short-sighted on the other.
Michael has 30 or 40 years to amuse himself after basketball that his
dribbling skills may not be able to help him with.

What I keep coming back to is the thought that are these big-time
college athletes taking up spots in their schools that real students are
being denied? If the four years of eligibility that a college athlete has
are for no other purpose than to prime him for a professional career
that in an overwhelming majority of the cases will never occur, then
there is something seriously wrong with NCAA Division I athletics. It
is unfortunate, but if today’s trends continue, ‘‘athletic scholarship”
will be nothing but a contradiction in terms....

_...Back from Turkey Break and on to some Colonnade notes: A look
at the General cagers shows a plus sign after the W&L Tip-Off Tourna-
ment and a question mark after the loss to Salisbury State. Tuesday
night’s loss to the Squids is a cause for concern. These two weeks after
Thanksgiving can be more trouble than they’re worth. Let’s hope the
team can go into exams on the up side...Tip of the cap and a wish for
continued brilliance to the General swimmers after their strong upset
of Johns Hopkins. Page Remillard has some fine freshmen to add to
his regular crew of Tim Stanford, Bobby Pearson and Jay Re-
ville...Some good wrestling is on tap Saturday in the Warner Center as
the Generals will host the eight-team W&L Invitational. Here’s a guess
that a majority of the noteworthy performances at the meet will come
from the home team....

....Can’t avoid it any longer. The first question asked, with few ex-
ceptions, after ‘‘How was your break?” was “Did You See The
Game?” Yes, I did, and it was certainly the most brilliant passing per-
formance by a pair of college quarterbacks that we will ever see. A
couple of things: 1) Doug Flutie showed any NFL scouts who weren’t
sure of his arm strength that, when needed, ‘“‘Mr. Excitement” (not
Paul Foutch, a common misconception) can crank it up. 2) The show
was made even more amazing by the fact, if you’ll remember, that it
rained for much of the second half. 3) There were some complaints
about the lack of defense, but it may be safe to assume that with Kosar
and Flutie at the reins, seven defensive backs are not enough...

.... Finally, here’s one from the unsuccessful rule change dept.: That
NCAA “‘out of the end zone, out to the 30’’ kickoff rule has resulted in
one kickoff being placed on the 30 every two games. Nice rule change,
guys...

Grapplers tame Tigers

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team opened its 1984-85 dual match
schedule Tuesday night with a 38-15
victory over the Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney in Farmville

Although the Generals (1-0) easily
defeated the Tigers, head coach Gary
Franke said, ‘I don’t think that we
wrestled very well.”’

Franke cited freshman Greg Rus-
sell for his victory at 158 lbs. as being
an exception. He said that Russell did
a ‘‘great job’ and was ‘‘most impres-
sive ‘

Russell’s classmate, Steve Castle,
started things off on a positive note
for the Generals with an opening bout
win at 118 lbs. Juniors Brian Lifsted
(126 Ibs.), Larry Anker (142 Ibs.) and
Win Phillips (167 lbs.), and seniors
Joe O’Neill (177 lbs.) and newcomer
heavyweight Mark Weaver also re-
corded wins for W&L Tuesday night.

The Generals dropped three mat-

These times are a reflection of the
“hard work and long practices the
, team members have had as regular
fare already this year.
‘“‘The excitement over this victory
» is because of our respect for their
(Hopkins’) program,’’ Coach Remil-
" lard said.

Last year the Generals finished 6-4
and number 15 out of 75 teams in the
nation. They also had six All Amer-
icans and set six new school records.
After the Hopkins victory it is becom-
ing apparent that this year’s team is
as tough if not tougher than last
year’s team according to Remillard.

“‘We lost two All Americans, Tim
Rock and Gary Myers but Stanford is
beating Myers’ times and freshman
Eric Sullivan is faster than Rock.”’
said Remillard. ‘Sullivan could
rewrite the record book in the middle
distance events. All in all, the team

team co-captain Bobby Pearson.
“The Hopkins victory felt great,
we've been getting closer every year.
In the middle of the meet, the team
had a good feeling about winning, but
I never dreamed of winning by 19
points.”” Pearson continued by say-
ing, “I think we could finish in the top
10 teams in the nation this year.”’

er after the first four games, tossed
in 18 points in the losing cause, while
the frosh phenom Hancock had 16
points.

Head coach Verne Canfield be-
lieves that his team will have to play
its own style of game rather than that
of its opponents if it is to get back on
the winning track.

“The last two games we've run into
very hot teams. We have a few pro-
blems we have to work out, but we
will,” Canfield said. ‘We have play-
ed out of our style in the last two
games.”

Canfield said that the high number
of points scored against his team in
its last two games is a source of con-
cern.

“There is a great deal of concern
because we take a great deal of pride
in our defense,’’ Canfield said.

Canfield said that the scoring of
Hancock has not come as a surpris¢
“We knew that he was a good

scorer,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘He obvious
ly has a nose for scoring. He has a
long way to go to show what he can
do. He has given us a scoring punch:
off the bench sofar.”’

The Generals host the University of
North Carolina-Greensboro tonight
at 7:30 p.m. Canfield expects the
Spartans to be a tough opponent.

“They have several quick leapers
and have good individual talent,’
Canfield said. “They want a high
scoring game, and we need to avoid
this if we are to win.”

W&L defeated UNC-Greensboro
43-42 last season.

The Generals travel to Greensboro,
N.C., Saturday to play Greensboro
College, a team that has already
beaten the Spartans this season. Tip
off in Greensboro is slated for 7:30
p.m.

Hunting fatalities are preventable, experts say

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Samuel P. Callahan, an 18-year-old from
Cocoa, Fla., went hunting in a densely wooded
area of northern Rockbridge County on the
Tuesday of Thanksgiving vacation.

Before the day was over, he had been charg-
ed with reckless use of a firearm.

Pronounced dead of a .30-caliber rifle wound
to the back of the neck was Tracy Curtis Bree-
den, 22, of Staunton.

Callahan reported the accident to authori-
ties. Breeden died at the scene.

Reached at his Florida home last night,
Callahan declined to discuss the incident.

Breeden’s was the second hunting death in
Rockbridge County this month, and seven hun-
ters have died in the state since July 1, already
exceeding the total from the previous hunting
year

Robert W. Day of the Rockbridge County
Sheriff's Department said the two Rockbridge
County deaths occurred because the victims
were mistaken for game. ‘‘Both of those guys
have been shot for turkeys,”’ he said.

Day said that Callahan talked to Breeden an
hour and 20 minutes before the accident. ‘‘He
knew he was in the area and he knew he was
dressed in full camouflage,”’ he said.

He said hunters are generally charged with
recklessness in cases of fatality because for a
manslaughter conviction ‘‘you've got to prove
a motive and you just can’t doit.”’

‘It's kind of a weak spot in the law, really,”’
Day said. ‘We'd like to see a felony statute for
when someone's life is taken just through gross

negligence.”

He said one factor that contributes to acci-
dents is that the Rockbridge area gets a num-
ber of hunters from out of state, which results
in crowded forest conditions. “You have
hunters come from all over,’’ he said

Washington and Lee junior Townes Pressler,
who hunts in Texas, said the large number of
hunters is one of the reasons he seldom hunts in
Rockbridge County. ‘I wouldn't dare go into
the woods here with the stories I've heard,’’ he
said.

Senior Charles Davidson of Houston has been
hunting for 10 years and has shot a deer and
several doves this season in Rockbridge Coun-
ty, which he called ‘‘one of the best deer hun-
ting areas inthestate.”

“The big problem is that there are so many
people out there in such a short time that they
go to all extremes and aren’t as careful as they
should be,’”’ he said.

“A lot of people here are out going crazy.
‘They'll shoot at any sound they hear — they
don’t wait tosee whatitis.”

Hunter G. McCoy, the Virginia Commission
of Game and Inland Fisheries’ hunter educa-
tion coordinator for Rockbridge County and a
member of the W&L printing shop staff, said
both of this year’s hunting fatalities could have
been prevented if proper safety precautions

had been followed.
According to McCoy, the two were the first

local hunting fatalities in several years.

He said that in many cases hunters shoot
when they hear a noise without seeing what
they are shooting.

McCoy also said that neither victim was
wearing ‘‘blaze orange’’ —the fluorescent color

recommended for use by hunters. He said that
in the first death, the victim was wearing cam-
ouflage and that in the second one, the person
was not wearing orange.

He said that blaze orange is the only color not
known to exist in nature and that scientists be-
lieve it to be the most visible color in existence
—even people who are color blind can see it.

‘When you go hunting, the three colors you
never wear are red white and blue,”’ he said.
“It may sound unpatriotic, but deer are red,
the turkey body has a blue tint to it and deer
have a white tail.”’

McCoy said he would favor a law mandating
use of the color by hunters. ‘‘The legislature
hasn’t seen fit to pass such a law, but I think
they should,”’ he said. |

Beverly C. ‘““John’’ Read, Commonwealth’s
Attorney for Lexington and Rockbridge Coun-
ty, agreed that additional hunting legislation
may be necessary. Like Day, Read favors mak-
ing a stiffer penalty available for those who kill
someone while hunting.

“It’s a terrible tragedy when something like
that happens, but I believe that in order to
make hunters more careful, there needs to be a
more stringent punishment associated with a
death in the woods,”’ Read said.

He said that when there is a hunting fatality,
law enforcement officials must choose between
charging the person with reckless handling of a
firearm and the much harsher charge of man-
slaughter.

“Tf you look at those two statutes, there is a
big void between them,’’ Read said. ‘‘In my o-
pinion, the General Assembly needs to change
the law in that regard.”’

“There needs to be a statute that carries with

it a stringent punishment for reckless handling
of a firearm when it results in the death of
someone, rather than the slap on the wrist that
takes place now,” he said.

Manslaughter — murder that is accidental or
not premeditated — is a class five felony pun-
ishable by imprisonment for one to ten years, a
fine of up to $1,000 or both.

Reckless handling of firearms is a class two
misdemeanor and carries a penalty of up to six
months in jail, a fine of as much as $500 or both.

Read said that he used to hunt before his mili-
tary service. “I haven’t picked up a firearm
since Vietnam,” he said solemnly,

S. Vance Wilkins Jr., Lexington’s representa-
tive in the Virginia House of Delegates, said he
also favors tough punishment for people re-
sponsible for hunting fatalities, but that ex-
isting laws may be sufficient.

“Pm not sure a manslaughter charge is total-
ly inappropriate,”’ he said of hunting fatality
cases,

“If you're shooting at something and you
don’t know what it is, that’s just about as dan-
Serous as driving a car drunk,”’ he said. ‘‘I’ve
been hunting for 40 years and I haven't seen a
man that looked like a turkey yet.”

Wilkins said that mandating fluorescent
orange clothing for hunters may not be effec-
tive.

“T’m not sure it’s the panacea people think it
is,” he said. “If the fluorescent is behind some
leaves, and you just shoot at movement, which
is all these people are shooting at anyway, the
orange isn’t going to save the person.”’

Wilkins said he doesn’t wear orange when
he’s in the woods because he has no special
hunting clothes and just wears an old jacket.

 

 

 

The MDA Superdance, Feb. 1-3, promises a lot of excitement.

Superdance sets goal at $30,000

 

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter
The three weeks’ between

Thanksgiving and Christmas vaca-
tion is the most important time for
recruiting Superdancers for ‘‘W&L’s
longest party,”’ according to Super-
dance Chairman Chris Williams, a
senior.

“Things are going great so far this
year. Everybody has done a super
job,”’ Williams said.

The Superdance is a 30-hour dance
marathon to benefit the Muscular
Dystrophy Association and will be
held the weekend of Feb. 1-3, 1985.
Although it had modest beginnings in
1979, W&L since has become the
number one per capita contributor to
MDA in the nation.

Last year, more than $35,000 was
pledged at the winter gala. W&L has
increased its amount pledged and
surpassed its goal every year since
the dance’s inception. ‘‘This year’s
goal is $30,000, and student participa-
tion is essential if we are to secure
this amount,” Williams explained.

In order to dance, a student should
pick up a packet Sunday night at

Room 114 in the Student Center or ob-
tain one from Carole Chappell’s of-
fice. The person who collects the
most pledges will receive the grand
prize: an all-expenses paid trip to
Bermuda. Other prizes include week-
end trips to New York, Hilton Head
and Georgetown. Those not dancing
can win prizes in the pre-dance raf-
fle. The winner of the raffle receives
two nights for two at Snowshoe or
Virginia Beach.

While the prizes and partying are
great, Williams said, it is important
to remember the cause. Muscular
dystrophy cripples people of all ages,
but especially young children.

“Thirty hours seems like a long
time to be on your feet dancing, but
when we see those kids and the pain
that they go through, the Superdance
becomes a truly rewarding. and
satisfying experience,’ Williams
said.

Students who do not dance still are
encouraged to attend the event,
which will last from 8 p.m. Friday,
Feb, 1, to2.a.m. Sunday, Feb. 3. For
the first time, the dance will be held
in the student activities pavilion
rather than in Evans Dining Hall.

It is important for the dancers to be
encouraged by a large crowd, Wil-
liams said, and gate receipts and
beverage sales account for some
large revenues. In addition, specta-
tors can enjoy the music of the Vol-
tage Brothers, the Cruis-o-matics,
the Waller Family and Dirty Secrets,
as well as participate in some of the
special events, including the pie
throws.

Students from all of the area wo-
men’s colleges and from VMI also
will be participating in the dance.
Williams said he hopes the W&L stu-
dents will encourage women from the
surrounding colleges to make a spec-
ial effort to dance this year.

Assisting Williams are vice-chair-
man Darby Brower, David Sizemore
and Charles Stern, as well as a 75-
member steering committee. The
group has gotten off to its earliest
start ever this year,but Williams said
the real key is getting people to
dance.

“This year’s Superdance is going
to be the biggest and best ever. Itis a
great way not only to have a good

time, but to give to others who are
less fortunate than ourselves.”

McCoy’s 10
guidelines for
happy hunting

Hunter G. McCoy, hunter educa-
tion coordinator for Rockbridge
County and a W&L staff member,
said an important rule for hunting is
to wear fluorescent or ‘‘blaze’’
orange at all times. In addition, he of-
fered the ‘Ten Commandments of
Gun Safety” taught in Lexington and
Rockbridge schools:

eTreat every gun as if it were load-
ed, at all times.

eAlways point the muzzle in a safe
direction.

eUniload guns when not in use.

¢Be sure the barrel is clear of ob-
structions.

Be sure of your target.

eNever point a gun at anything you
do not want to shoot.

eNever climb a tree or cross a
fence or jump a ditch with a loaded
gun.

eNever shoot at a flat, hard surface
or the surface of water.

eStore guns and ammunition sepa-
rately.

¢Do not drink and hunt.

_|Student play deals with

blacks and segregation

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

“‘Purlie Victorious,’’ a play dealing
with black segregation, will begin
Saturday at the school’s Troubadour
Theatre and continue through Mon-
day.

W&L faculty, staff and students
will be admitted free of charge to the
production, which begins each night
at 8 p.m. Reservations are necess-
ary, and may be made by calling
463-8637 between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.

“Purlie Victorious”’ was written by
black playwright Ossie Davis in the
early 1960s.

“The play is a comedy and at-
tempts to deal with the segregation
issue ina practical and realistic way,
as opposed to other attempts that
were more radical and rebellious,’’
said student director Terry McWhor-
ter.

“Many of the plays of that era
—the civil rights peaking period
—dealt with segregation in an ag-
gressive manner, trying to force
‘Black Power’ on the audience,’ Mc-
Whorter continued.

“Davis has found great success
with this play because he steers away
from that particular attitude and de-
livers a message through the use of
humor that is more easily received.”

major who is taking an independent
study course in theatre, said the play
is the first black play — ‘‘performed
by, for, about and near blacks’’ — at
W&L.

“The play teaches a serious lesson
about race relations and human na-
ture by exploiting comic elements
that seem on the surface unrelated to
real life,’’ McWhorter said.

“However, it is the underlying con-
notations that deliver Davis’ real
message.”

Posters promoting the play show a
likeness of General Robert E. Lee
holding a whip and standing next toa
much taller black man who is smiling
with his mouth open and both hands
in the air with two fingers raised.

“Rebellious acts, violence or force
are not a part of this play,” McWhor-

ter said. ‘It is simply a play that
delivers a message of how such a
complex issue can be dealt with ina
realistic and practical manner.

“It is humorous and entertaining
for all, and was actually written for
white audiences.”

The cast consists of a group of W&L
students, two Sweet Briar College
students and a Lexington High School
student.

The lead role of Purlie Victorious
Judson is played by sophomore Mike
Webb. Playing opposite him is Kelly
Reed of Sweet Briar.

Other cast members include senior
Todd Jones as Ol’ Cap’n Cotichipee,
senior Bryan Johnson as Gitlow Jud-
son, and Sweet Briar’s Valerie Bran-
don as Missy Judson.

Politics fest to show ‘Reds’

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

The Politics Film Festival will con-
tinue next term to offer a wide range
of high quality films, including the
movie ‘‘Reds,’’ according to series
director and po‘itics Professor Craig
W. McCaughrin.

The tentative lineup for the winter
also includes ‘“‘High Noon,”’ ‘Advise
and Consent,”’ ‘Macbeth,’ George
Lucas’ ‘“THX-1138”’ and an Italian
film, ‘‘The Organizer.”’

The festival, which offers the films
free to students and the community,
was begun in 1982 by McCaughrin
and continued with the assistance of
politics Professor William Buchanan
and the University Library’s audio-
visual department.

McCaughrin said the films in-
crease interest in politics among
students and also demonstrate the
universality of politics.

Science fiction, Shakespeare and
even ‘‘My Fair Lady’’ can illustrate
political systems and theories and
can call attention to the widespread
influence of politics on our culture.

McCaughrin said the series is also
a means of elaborating on Politics
101, ‘Comparative Government,’
and serves as an additional text for
the class.

For example, he said, the idea of
consensus is examined in textbooks
for the courses, and the film version
of Henrik Ibsen’s ‘‘An Enemy of the
People’”’ illustrated the dangers of too
great a consensus.

McCaughrin said the ‘‘Film Fest’’
has been a mixed success. He said
that when popular films such as “A
Clockwork Orange” and ‘‘Apocaly-
pse Now” are shown, the interest in
the film itself tends to blur the politi-
cal message. On the other hand, he
noted that some of the older films fail
to hold students’ attention.

McCaughrin said he would like to
see an expansion of the Film Festi-
val, especially the role played by the
library’s audio-visual center. He said
that rather than it serving simply as
a clearing house for the films, he
would like to see the center play an
active role in classroom instruction
and campus activity.

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

SAB warned by ABC
about beer in pavilion

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

During a 45-minute meeting this
morning with an Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board agent, the Student Ac-
tivities Board learned that it will
have to develop improved security
and supervisory procedures in order
to continue selling beer at the student
activities pavilion.

“They want us to come up with
some procedures to better handle

security at the pavilion,’ SAB
Entertainment Director John
Haywood said after the meeting.

Despite earlier fears to the con-
trary, he said, ‘‘There’s not going to
be any problem coming up with ban-
quet licenses (to sell beer) as long as
we come up with acceptable proce-
dures.”’

New procedures may include hir-
ing professional security personnel
and bartenders and better training
SAB members who work at pavilion
parties, Haywood added.

ABC agents at Friday night’s
pavilion party were ‘‘unhappy with
the situation in the pavilion,”
said Associate Dean of Students
Michael Cappeto.

Although the party was open only
to Washington and Lee students and
invited guests, ABC agents who did
not identify themselves as college
students were sold tickets, according
to Haywood. The agents also were
concerned with the number of intoxi-
cated people at the party and the

number of bottles students had
brought into the pavilion, Haywood
and Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said.

They were definitely upset with
what they saw out there Friday
night,”’ John said. ‘‘The ABC people
have a real concern about violations
of ABC regulations there.”’

Either two or three agents were at
the party, Cappeto said.

About 12:15 a.m., two agents spoke
with Haywood, SAB Chairman Bur-
ford Smith and Bobby Pifer, who had
obtained the banquet license for the
party.

“They were concerned...that there
were a lot of intoxicated individuals,
some of whom were continuing to be
served beer,’’ Haywood
said. ‘‘The agents obviously were not
happy at all. They were very con-
cerned about the situation.”

On Monday, one of the agents tele-
phoned Dean John to explain the pro-
blems.

“He said that as a result of what he
saw Friday night, he was not of a
mind to recommend or approve any
further licenses for out there,” John
said.

During that telephone conversa-
tion, which John said was brief, this
morning’s meeting was arranged
among the ABC officials and John,
Cappeto, Student Body President
Cole Dawson, Smith and Haywood.

Haywood emphasized that this
morning’s meeting was not intended
to be an appeal of a decision that had
already been made. ‘‘We’re not clear

Change of venue

asked by

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

A request to change the location of
the trial of Scot Tanner Mesner, the
19-year-old accused of setting last
spring’s fatal Washington and Lee
fraternity house fire, was filed by his
attorney yesterday in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court.

The change of venue request was
one of three motions relating to the
Mesner case submitted to Circuit
Court Judge George E. Honts III yes-
terday. The documents were made
available late this morning.

The trial is scheduled to be held at
the Rockbridge County Courthouse
on Dec. 19 through 21.

Mesner was indicted Sept. 4 for ar-
son and murder in connection with
the Phi Gamma Delta fire. Each of
the two charges carries a potential
penalty of between 20 years and life
in prison.

In the change of venue motion,
Mesner’s lawyers said that media co-
verage of the case ‘‘has been of such
a highly inflammatory and prejudici-
al nature’ that the trial should be
moved to another region ‘‘in order to
preserve the defendant’s constitu-
tional right to a fair trial by an im-
partial jury.”’

Rockbridge Circuit Court Clerk D.
Bruce Patterson said about 35 jurors
will be summoned for the trial.

Patterson said that in past cases
when a change of venue motion has
been filed, a hearing has not been
held prior to the scheduled opening of
the trial.

If you’re way behind in prepar-
ing for exams and you've got a 10-
page paper due tomorrow morn-
ing, what do you do?

Common solutions might be
either to pull an all-nighter or just
to give up, get a good night’s sleep
and take your chances with the
Automatic Rule committee.

Professors and students inter-
viewed this week had some even
more original ideas.

Psychology Professor David G.
Elmes recommends three possi-
ble solutions. Prayer is first, and
asking the dean for forgiveness is
next.

“Or,’’ he added, ‘‘you could pos-
sibly give mea BMW.”

 

Just play ‘Alpine Ski’

Mesner

“They wait until the day of the
trial, and if they’re successful in im-
paneling a jury, then of course they’ll
deny the motion,” he said. ‘If they
can’t impanel a jury, then they hold a
hearing. But that’s all entirely up to
the judge.”’

The Code of Virginia says a circuit
court judge may grant a prosecution
or defense motion for change of ve-
nue “‘for good cause.”

A second motion also cited ‘‘exten-
sive regional media coverage’’ in its
request that prospective jurors be
questioned out of the presence of
other potential jurors. The motion for
individual voir dire states that due to
the publicity in the case, effective
questioning ‘‘simply cannot be
conducted in a group interrogation
without irreparable prejudice.”

A third motion dated yesterday ob-
jects to two of the three types of hair
that Commonwealth’s Attorney Bev-
erly C. ‘‘John’’ Read had requested
that law enforcement officials be
allowed to obtain from Mesner. The
motion did not object to the request
for samples of head hair.

Mesner’s motion states that ‘‘the
Commonwealth should be required to
show that the purpose of this request
is relevant to the issues presented by
the present case...and that the possi-
ble results of such requests will not
be prejudicially speculative in re-
gard to this defendant.”’

Read declined to comment on the
motion.

A report by the state Bureau of
Forensic Science dated Nov. 7 in

O See Mesner, Page 3

Senior Bob Spatig, a dorm coun-
selor, has another idea.

‘When in doubt, play Alpine Ski
at Lloyd’s,”’ he suggested.

On a serious side, though, those
interviewed agreed that the best
solution is to avoid procrastina-
tion in the first place.

In fact, all dorm counselors this
week received a set of guidelines
concerning the upcoming exami-
nation period, and one of the ma-
jor notes warns about procrasti-
nation.

“If you haven’t studied by now,
it’s probably too late,’ said
Elmes, who last year conducted a
study of students on the correla-
tion between mood and studying
efficiency.

whether they’ve taken beer out of the
pavilion or not,”’ he said earlier this
week,

The type of license the SAB obtains
for pavilion parties is known as a
banquet license. This license allows
for the one-day purchase, sale and
consumption of beer by a private or-
ganization, and must be obtained on
a per-event basis. ‘“‘The law assumes
that you are holding essentially a
closed party,’’ Haywood said.

Although only students and their
properly invited guests are supposed
to be admitted to events held with a
banquet license, University adminis-
trators noted that the ABC usually
regards women from the surround-
ing colleges as invited guests.

“T think it would be unfair to say
that the ABC has not been coopera-
tive. They have been,”’ Haywood add-
ed.

A problem arises, though, he said,
in that juniors and seniors at W&L
are not required to have college iden-
tification cards, and thus the SAB
cannot limit admission only to those
students with ID cards.

“It is almost impossible to require
college IDs because our people don’t
carry college IDs,’’ Haywood said.
“In the future, IDs are going to have
to be mandatory.”’

Even the freshmen and sopho-
mores, who are supposed to have

Brower in the buff?

 

 

No, sorry to disappoint you all. Darby’s wearing a
polo shirt and jeans.

Nevertheless, watch out, Tom Selleck: Here come
two different groups of calendar ‘‘pin-up’’ men from
Washington and Lee. Although neither calendar allows
its men to bare it all, both do show W&L student-mo-
dels in and about Lexington.

Darby Brower and Marquis Smith — Mr. February
and Mr. October, respectively — were production coor-
dinators for a calendar sponsored by Coors’ beer that
has a black-and-white picture of a different W&L fra-
ternity man for each month of 1985.

Tina Harrison, who produced the other calendar,
“Some Men of Lexington, Virginia,’ went for a much
wider cross-section of W&L that includes independents
and law students.

“Normally the guys who are in it have to pay to get
this kind of exposure,’ Brower said of the Coors calen-
dar. ‘‘As far as why we did it, it’s just an experiment in
private enterprise.”’

While Brower and Smith received a $2,300 loan from
Coors, Tina Harrison, a self-employed graphic-design
artist, put up $2,000 of her own for her calendar.

“T just graduated from Mary Washington College,
and this calendar is an addition to my portfolio,”
Harrison explained. ‘I’ve grown up in Lexington, and
some professors’ wives and some admissions people
gave me the students’ names.”’

Harrison emphasized that she was not after the typi-
cal “face man”’ calendar. ‘‘It seems to be a real good
cross-section, and that’s what I wanted.”’

Brower said there is not enough room in this town for
two calendars, and that their approach is better,

“T don’t feel like there is enough market for each,”’
he said. ‘‘Theirs is more expensive than ours, and may-
be in the long run ours is a little better.”’

Two Mink calendars published

He went on to say that the comments about Lex-
ington in Harrison’ calendar are overdoing it a bit.

The Coors calendar is priced at five dollars, and Har-
ae ’s costs $7.50. Both are available at the W&L Book-
store.

Student-models from both calendars said they have
been getting teased around campus,

“They start to talk about it, I start to frown and then
they stop,” said David Woodham, Coors’ Mr. April. -

Henry Dewing, the August model in Harrison’s cal-
endar, said he did not do it just for the two free calen-
dars he received.

“I did it for the hell of it,’’ Dewing said. ‘‘The reac-
tion has been a combination of, ‘It’s a nice picture,’ to,
‘Hey, what are you doing ina calendar?’ “

Bob Tomaso said he was a little skeptical before he
agreed to pose for September in Harrison’s calendar.

“I thought it would be a little exciting, I guess,” To-
maso said. ‘‘They (the Coors calendar) certainly have
more face men. Ours is obviously a calendar of people
who haveaccomplished something at school.”

Tomaso declined to say which calendar was better,
though.

Mike McAlevey said he has gotten lots of ‘infamous
notoriety” for his January pose in the Coors calendar.

‘I did it because I thought it would be interesting and
because it was flattering.’’ McAlevey said. ‘‘Outside of
the grief I've gotten from my friends, I haven't gotten
much out of it materially except my one free copy.”’

He added that he thought Brower and Smith have
priced the calendar too high, and that it should have in-
cluded a wider cross-section of students.

Mark Pembroke, Mr. February in Harrison’s calen-
dar, also has experienced a mixed reaction on campus.

‘ did it as a favor and was a bit flattered, too. The
reactions have mostly been kind of funny: ‘There he is:
Mr. Calendar Boy, Mr. February,’ It has all been in
jest.”

With coeducation coming up, maybe someone will do
a spread of ‘‘Women at W&L.”’

Discouraging

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting, Vice
President James White released the findings of his informal
poll of the Law School. While the poll contains no real sur-
prises, the statistical breakdown of the results is at once alar-
ming and discouraging.

Discounting temporarily the dismal 30 percent response
rate, the responses on the three sections of the poll reveal a
great deal about the opinions of the Honor System in Lewis
Hall. Over half of the students responding thought the Honor

_ System worked only ‘‘ok”’ (versus ‘‘great’’), but by about the

same margin, the same students believed the system was not
“*too legalistic.’

That is distressing, for it signals that something is foul in
the state of affairs. Do law students believe that the Honor

- System should be more legalistic, or does the code fail long

before it even approaches legalism? Similarly, do law stu-
dents really believe the Honor System should continue to be
the rule in their classrooms?

Equally interesting were the results to the questions as to
Law School representation on the EC. Of those polled, 62 per-
cent believed they did not receive adequate representation
with only two at-large law members on the EC, while 83 per-
cent thought an additional law representative would be in
order. Emphasizing the need for additional communication
between the EC and the Law School was the response indicat-
ing that 54 percent of those polled were not aware of the most
recent White Book revisions.

Law School involvement with undergraduates, according
to the poll, is minimal, except for large University-wide func-
tions such as Fancy Dress and pavilion parties. That is
understandable, for law students generally are not interested
in participating in activities led by undergraduates or cater-
ing solely to undergraduates.

All this points to several important initiatives that must be
made. First, the poll to be taken with the ‘‘Big Three” elec-
tions in March asking whether or not students on the whole
believe an additional law representative should be elected
must be emphasized as a means for bringing the Law School
closer to both the Honor System and the undergraduate popu-
lation. At stake with a third law representative is not merely
a question of equal representation but one of making the
Honor System a reality and a force in the Law School. Addi-
tionally, the EC in general and the law representatives on the
EC in particular should undertake a greater effort to commu-
nicate the issues before the EC with law students, especially
those issues dealing with the White Book. While additional
communication will not necessarily ‘‘unite’’ the two schools,
it certainly will quell the common perception that ignorance
of the Honor System is acceptable or allowed.

White’s poll, though wrapped in controversy, is certainly
an important step toward building (and not ‘‘mending”’) rela-
tions between the Law School and the undergraduates. The
challenge before both groups is to take action according to its
results. Only in recognizing the problem, confronting the is-
sues and working together toward solutions will the state of
affairs return to any semblance of normality.

Finest hour

For seven days beginning Saturday at 2 p.m., Washington
and Lee will enjoy its finest hours. Students will be studying,
faculty will be correcting, and coffee sales will soar. The
campus will be quiet, except for the groans heard when the
bell tolls noon or 5 p.m.

But besides the subtle changes in appearance, the Univer-
sity’s finest hours come with the onslaught of final examina-
tions, for in those quickly passing hours is the character of
the school put to the test. Washington and Lee has an Honor
System, but not just any honor system.(For example, hand-
ing in someone else’s work here has always been considered
dishonorable.) Our understanding of honor allows us to sche-
dule our final exams, take those exams without a proctor
frantically pacing the room observing the slightest blinking
or nodding, and trusts that those students who have complet-
ed exams will maintain a code of silence until the exam-
ination period has finished. That is a luxury few college
students are afforded in this nation.

So, in these few frantic hours remaining of the fall term, as
you sit studying those notes you took last September in fine
handwriting and a green felt-tip pen, remember that you are
part of an exceptional process, a system that at once refines
character while defining it. At test this week is not merely a
myriad of courses, but a way of life.

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any
unacknowledged aid on this editoral.

Remembrance of Christmases past

OUR VIEW

By Mike McAlevey
and Scott Henderson

 

It’s that time again. Christmas
spirit pervades the chilled December
air and the not-much-warmer hearts
of the people celebrating this joyous
occasion. That’s right, boys, we’re
back on that coaster into the fathom-
less recesses of our own misanthro-
pic, self-centered souls. Oh, so that’s
a little strong — but isn’t it about
time we removed our tinsel-tainted,
rose-colored glasses and took a
closer look at what this once most
sanctified day of the year has been
reduced to?

It’s not hard to see what I mean,
just take a look at prime time televi-
sion (you can be sure your little
brothers and sisters are). Let’s take
a little trip down memory lane to
where this materialistic indoctrina-
tion all began, that time when we,
too, were little kids.

Ah, yes, remember the nature of
toys back then, the simplicity that re-
quired a little imagination. How
about those GI Joes? I remember
when GI Joe was just a little figurine.

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott
Tilley

 

Professor Nancy Margand, proba-
bly without realizing it, has profound-
ly changed my view on school...and
life.

It began four Thursdays ago when I
got a call from Washington. It was a
friend asking me to go to Bermuda
with him and his wife and some other
guys on a retreat the following week.

“Right,” I said. ““You want me to
take a week off from school — the
week before Thanksgiving break —to
take off on some exotic excursion.
Like I’m sosure.”’

“‘Well, you need to be up here the
day after tomorrow if you decide to
go,”’ he said. ‘But we need to know
tomorrow morning.”

This was all too weird for me. It
was like something that your friends
always do, but you never imagine
yourself doing. It was like a movie.
But for a couple of reasons, not really
important here, this time was impor-
tant to me.

I decided to ask for my professors’
advice, knowing that they would
frown non the idea At least that

Law students
reassured

To the Editors:

Mr. Leach’s statement that he
would not deny library services to a
VMI cadet any more than he would a
law student is a great relief to all
those who attend classes in Lewis
Hall. For some time we have been
apprehensive as to our status, not-
withstanding the fact that we each
pay the paltry sum of $6,515 in tuition
to the University.

On behalf of all the law students, I
would like to thank Mr. Leach for as-
suring us that he would not deny us
the services of the UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY.

When you wanted him to walk, you
waddled him; to talk, you were the
ventriloquist; to punch, you had to
wrench his whole body into the ac-
tion. And then the metamorphosis be-
gan. Joe got movable limbs, so he
could take one step at a time and use
only one arm to throw a mean jab at
the Viet Cong. But darn if he didn’t
have to move his whole body to spy
on his pinko Commie adversaries.
The obvious renovation was effected.
Joe was given movable eagle
eyes.(Never mind the lever protrud-
ing from the back of his head.) How
was our national hero to fight the
martial arts tactics he faced? Easy.
Give him a kung fu grip. Although his
repertoire of statements was
drastically reduced, it sure lessened
the mental strain on the kids when
Mattel put in a little voicebox so we
could hear him say, 100 times a day,
“T’ll not stand for this aggression, die
you foreigner.’’ Then in an exponen-
tial onslaught, out came the lunar
capsule and moon rover to keep up
with the times. Don’t fret too much,
kids, it probably won’t be long before
you can just buy mechanical kids to
play with the toy for you.

Most toys followed the same meta-
morphic race for technical superiori-
ty and contemporary realism. Take,
for example, the primitive Tonka

way, I could justify to myself a ‘‘no”’
answer without placing myself
among those timid souls of Teddy
Roosevelt renown who live in that
gray twilight that knows neither vic-
tory or defeat.

Boy, did they fool me!

I could not reach one professor.
Another was reluctantly tolerant.
Another got excited and wanted to
accompany us. But Professor Mar-
gand amazed me.

“Will missing a week of school af-
fect where you are 10 years from
now?”’ she asked.

After a moment of thought, I re-
sponded, ‘‘no.”’

“Well go for it then. This is what
college is for,” she said.

I was inshock. But what impressed
me the most was that it was nota flip-
pant remark. She sensed how impor-
tant it was to me, and the opportunity
that was there for growth in a non-
academic realm.

And that I think is the key.

Through the University’s Big
Brother-Little Brother program, I
have a little brother out in East Lex-
ington. I was kind of shocked the first
time I talked to this 8-year-old and he
was unfamiliar with W&L and what
went on here. And he really didn’t
care.

I began to see a pew perspective.
The world does not revolve around
me or the Colonnade. But it is easy to

Toy. Remember when it was a scaled.

down, reasonable facsimile of a real
piece of construction equipment?
Sure, you had to push it around your-
self and after innumerable nights in
the rain, maybe a little rust would
begin to accumulate. Well, out of in-
novation, safety features, or more
probably an attempt to appeal to
kids’ desire for what daddy really
has, the basic Tonka Toy idea got ex-
ploited from every angle. I can take
cars that have a set track, on which,
from an elevated origin, they could
move of their own accord, but some
of the later updates got a little out of
hand. Soon cars could be joined by a
battery charger, and zip around the
banked curve track at a velocity that
would make Spot take cover behind
the Lazy-Boy recliner with the built-
in TV control device.

Cox planes buzzed around a vertex
attached to a string, and Vertibirds
with variable height and speed con-
trols could rescue distraught citizens
from a towering inferno of burning
stacked Hot Rod magazines (or used
to decapitate the make-believe vil-
lain who perpetrated the arson).
Thank God remote control was in-
vented so kids didn’t have to be re-
stricted by those unrealistic restrain-
ing cables. Was a little rust and im-
agination all that bad?

Well, back to Christmas. How
about the rendition we get on televi-
sion of the Christmas story itself?
“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”’
is certainly an effective vector for
the transmission of the Christmas
story. It has all the elements of a
good show, touching our sentimen-
tality with Rudolph’s nasal anomoly,
evoking fear with the ominous pre-
sence of the Abominable Snowman,
and illustrative individualism and
good American  entrepreneurism
when the little toymaker announced,
“‘T don’t want to be an elf, I want to be
a dentist.’’ And yes, the happy en-
ding.

But what makes it happy? Is it San-
ta’s compassionate utilization of Ru-
dolph’s former nemesis, or the relief
that our presents won’t be delayed by
that “foggy Christmas Eve’’?

“The Grinch That Stole Christ-
mas”’ is almost as effective. I must
have missed the part when that phy-
sically repulsive devil ruthlessly
mushing his poor puppy over the
Himalayas stole Christ’s birth from
right under their noses. Stupid me,
and I thought all the people were de-
vastated simply because they
weren’t going to receive their gifts.
Wait a minute, which gift do we cele-
brate on the 25th? I seem to have
forgotten. Haven’t we all?

away from here?

going on here and only here.

As William Blake said, in trying to
make ourselves more than men, we
become less. In becoming muddled in
the finite, we lose all sense of the in-
finite.

Markham Pyle used this space a
year ago to extol the virtues of re-
treating with your six-pack of Coors
to Goshen. I’m not a Coors’ fan, but
he hada point.

There is an abundance of academic
riches out there for us. Professors
are an unending source of know-
ledge. In a meager four years here,
we will be able to grasp but the small-
est piddling of it. The short-run goal
is that we absorb that which will
prepare us for whatever step we take
after leaving the friendly confines of
our red-bricked and white-columned
sanctuary.

But let’s not lose sight of the long-
term goal. Let the piddling of infor-
mation you gather serve as a drop of
water does to a desert wanderer. De-
sire more.

And let that desire enable you to
transcend the formal academic
realm and reach that other bastion of
knowledge that awaits. Seek both.
One does not necessarily come at the
expense of the other.

If that means attending the next
cultural event in Lee Chapel, or tak-
ing an afternoon by yourself at Gos-
hen to get things back into perspec-
tive, do it. It might even mean to quit

worrying about whether you get an ~

A-minus or a B-plus in that class you
are sweating bullets over.

What will you take away from here
that will really affect where you are
10 years from now?

White releases poll results

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

Sixty-two percent of law students said they are
not fairly represented by the Executive Commit-
tee, according to an informal poll by EC Vice
President James White.

In addition, 83 percent said they favor the con-
stitutional amendment proposal that would add a
second-year law representative to the EC to go
along with the first-year and upperclass
representatives. That proposal will be voted on in
March.

Of the 364 law students, 108, or 29.7 percent,
returned questionnaires

The poll, which White distributed in the Law
School four weeks ago, was initiated and paid for
by White, without the consultation of the rest of
the EC.

“It is in no way an official EC poll,” President
Cole Dawson said Tuesday.

Second-year law student Alice Sacks criticized
White last week for distributing the questionnaire
without the approval of the two Law School repre-
sentatives on the FC Some law students said

some questions were worded poorly and might
result in the survey being biased, Sacks said.

White defended himself by saying that he dis-
tributed the questionnaire to gauge law student
opinion on the numerous issues that have arisen
between the undergraduate and law campuses.

Last year, law students passed a referendum
calling for fiscal autonomy from the EC for the
Law School government, but turned down a simi-
lar referendum about the honor system.

At meetings the EC frequently talks of
strengthening the honor system in the Law School
and lessening the differences between the two
campuses.

According to White's poll, 88 percent of law stu-
dents favor fiscal autonomy for the Student Bar
Association, Eighty-five percent said the honor
system works ‘‘great”’ or ‘‘ok’’ in the Law School,
and nine percent said it doesn’t work at all.

Also, 57 percent said they did not feel they were
an integral part of the whole W&L community,
and 62 percent said there is a problem of campus
unity.

Sacks said last week the questions about fiscal
autonomy for the SBA were seen by some stu-
dents as an attempt to refute last year’s referen-

duns vue.

When he handed out the results at Monday
night’s EC meeting, White warned of the possible
inaccuracies of the informal poll.

In other action Monday night, the EC heard
budget reports from eight student organizations,
including the Mock Convention, which has receiv-
ed a $50,000 grant for the 1988 convention from the
Hatton Sumners Foundation, which donated
$25,000 for last spring's convention

“They liked it so much that they gave us double
what they gave us last year,” said Michael Shel-
ton, temporary tri-chairman.

Most of the organizations that reported were a
week late. The committee voted unanimously to
release the groups’ Business Office funds that
had been frozen when they failed to report.

The Frisbee Club, one of the organizations
whose funds were frozen last week, told senior re-
presentative David Jonson that they won’t need
any more EC funds because they are being
sponsored by a beer company.

Jonson suggested that the EC ask all student
organization leaders to attend the Jan. 14 EC
meeting to find out why so many organizations
weren't aware of the budget report schedule. His
motion passed 8-2.

Mesner

 

Continued from Page 1

Mesner’s case file gives the result of
an analysis of a blanket and two
sheets taken from the room of fire
victim Thomas J. Fellin.

“Several Caucasian hairs were
found on the blanket and sheets,”’ it
says. ‘“‘If...hairs...from Thomas
Fellin and the suspect are submitted,
comparisons can be made.”’

Read has requested subpoenas for
37 individuals from’ three states. He
also requested the long distance
telephone records from Oct. 1983 to
Oct. 1984 for Mesner’s home tel-
ephone number, listed in his father’s
name, and for a telephone number
listed in the name of Anita Hodges.

Frank W. Rogers, an associate of
Mesner defense attorney G. Marshall
Mundy, said Mesner plans to plead
not guilty. Mesner has also said in the
past that he will plead not guilty.

Rogers said it is uncertain whether
Mesner will testify. ‘‘We don’t know
at this point and we won’t know until
that day,’’ Rogers said. ‘‘He certain-
ly has the right not to.”’

In a letter to the three attorneys
dated Nov. 8, Honts stated that ‘‘the
Commonwealth has to prove beyond

a reasonable doubt that (1) the fire
was incendiary in origin (arson) and
(2) the defendant was the agent
thereof.”’

The April 11 fire, which gutted the
Fiji house, occurred during spring
break last school year.

Fellin, a 19-year-old sophomore
honor student who was co-president
of the fraternity, died in the blaze,
which was discovered at 4:45 a.m.

The medical examiner’s report sta-
ted that Fellin died of ‘‘smoke inhala-
tion, carbon monoxide poisoning due
to fire’ and that his body had been
“found on [the] next to bottom step of
({the] stairs, apparently trying to
leave [the] house.”

Mesner has been held in the Rock-
bridge County jail on $150,000 bail
since the day he was indicted. Honts
refused to reduce the bail at a Sept.
19 hearing. ‘‘The bond that has been
set in this matter is a proper bond,”
he said.

Mesner was visited in jail yester-
day by his father, his stepmother and
Lexington lawyer Eric L. Sisler, who
is working with Mundy on Mesner’s
defense. Mesner declined to talk with
a reporter.

Five other inmates were in his
upstairs cell yesterday afternoon.
Mesner said there were seven people
in the cell Tuesday night.

Arby’s drive-by window
favored by commission

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington Planning Commis-
sion overturned a Lexington Public
Works Department recommendation
and voted 2-1 last Thursday to en-
dorse a request by Arby’s for a per-
mit for a drive-by window.

Several conditions were attached
to the recommendation that the Lex-
ington City Council approve the con-
ditional use permit for Arby’s, the
fast food restaurant located at 30 S.
MainSt.

City Manager John Doane sided
with the public works department
and voted against the recommenda-
tion. Commission members John De-
lany and Reid Agnor voted in favor of
the request. The other two members
were absent.

A public works department report
that had been requested by the com-
mission during its Nov. 8 meeting
listed four main reasons for opposing
the request.

Lexington attorney Bernard J.
Natkin, who along with local devel-
oper Clyde Mull represented Arby’s
at the meeting, said that ‘‘some of

these reports before the commission
just don’t make sense.”

“Shouldn’t this business, which
came here first, be given the chance
to compete with the others?’’ Natkin
asked. -

Natkin also said that he would have
no objection to a revocation clause
being included in the conditional use
permit. Mull said Arby’s would abide
by such a clause if one were included
in the permit.

“The drive-by window could be un-
done as fast as it was done,” Mull
said. ‘‘It won’t be that much of an ex-
pense.”

Mull told the commission that it
would take an average of three min-
utes to serve a customer using the
drive-by window. He added that the
McDonald’s in Lexington does not
have much more space for vehicles
in its drive-by window lane than Ar-
by’s would.

Doane questioned who would deter-
mine whether Arby’s was in violation
of the requirements of the permit if it
were granted. Doane also said there
would have to be ‘“‘substantial rea-
son’’ to revoke the permit once it has
been granted.

EC having trouble
with clubs’ reports

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A combination of lack of notifica-
tion and lack of response led to the
problems the Executive Committee
has had recently with student organi-
zations reporting on their budgets,
EC President Cole Dawson said.

Of the 17 student groups who re-
ceive funding from the student body
through the EC, only seven had
reported to the EC prior to Monday’s
meeting.

Dawson said it is important for the
groups to notify the EC of their finan-
cial situations so that the committee
can oversee the way in which the mo-
ney is spent and so that the various
organizations can rely on the EC in
the event that the groups have money
problems.

An example Dawson noted is the
Cold Check Committee. If for in-
stance, the committee is dealing with
a chronic offender, he said, the EC
should know about this if it threatens
the Cold Check Committee’s funds or
its effectiveness.

Some of the groups have not been
contacted early enough to allow them

 

to prepare a report for the EC, Daw-
son said. Dawson put this blame on
the EC. This may lead the groups to
be ignorant of the importance of re-
porting to the committee, he said.

Junior representative Pat Hayden
also noted that the EC had been slow

in contacting some groups, but added
that several organizations had been
contacted and had not shown up for a
meeting for two or three weeks. Hay-
den called this ‘‘blatant irresponsi-
bility on their part.”

At Monday night’s EC meeting,
nine groups presented their budget
reports to the committee, and the EC
voted to release their funds.

Dawson said he doesn’t expect pro-
blems in the future with the various
organizations. He thinks that mail-
boxes that wer? installed recently for
each of the groups will help with
notification of the groups.

The Executive Committee passed a
motion Monday night requiring all
chairmen of groups sponsored by the
EC to attend the next meeting of the
committee. The EC will explain to
them then that they must report reg-
ularly so that the EC can effectively
oversee their expenses and assist any
organization that may need help.

state Republicans
to meet in Staunton

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

A pep rally for officials of the
Virginia Republican party will be
held in Staunton this weekend in
preparation for the 1985 races for
governor, lieutenant governor, at-
torney general and the state legis-
lature.

Donald W. Huffman, chairman of

the state GOP, said the purpose of the
meeting is to foster party unity and
inform local organizers of their role
in the upcoming contests.

The retreat, which Huffman called
“a first-time thing for us,’’ will in-
clude the 75 members of the state
central committee and the state’s 125
unit chairmen, each of whom repre-
sents a particular city or county.

“The unit chairmen, I think, feel
they’re called up every time there’s
an election and they’re ignored at
other times,’’ said Huffman, a 1966
Washington and Lee Law School
graduate. ‘‘The idea is to give these
people an opportunity to have impact
in 1985.” :

He said local leaders will be en-
couraged to promote additional grass
roots party activity in their areas.
‘‘My job as I see it between now and
June is to preach party unity,” he ad-
ded.

Party candidates will be selected
at the state Republican convention in
Norfolk on May 31 and June 1. Del-
egates to the convention will be cho-
sen at mass meetings through the
state this winter.

W. Arthur Beeton, chairman of the
44-member Rockbridge Combined
Republican Committee, said the
local mass meeting is scheduled for
Wed., Jan. 23, at 8 p.m. in the county
courthouse.

Former Fairfax delegate Wyatt B.
Durrette Jr. and 8th District Con-
gressman Stan E. Parris have an-
nounced that they will seek the Re-
publican gubernatorial nomination.

“Philosophically, I don’t think
there are that many differences be-
tween them,” said Huffman, a for-
mer chairman of the Rockbridge
committee. ‘‘They’re both good men.
Either one would be good for the par-
by...
‘“‘Durrette is definitely the front-
runner at this point,’’ he continued.
He said Parris ‘‘has just got to go out
and get people to run for delegate
who will support him. That’s his job
at this point.”’

eral J. Marshall Coleman's an-
nouncement Monday that he would
run for lieutenant governor rather
than governor came as no surprise to
GOP leaders.

“‘T think he saw that he was not the
front-runner and thought he would be
a good candidate for lieutenant gov-
ernor,”’ he said, adding that he
agreed with that assessment.

The closeness of the contests will
not necessarily result in a divided
party after the June convention, Huf-
fman maintained.

“We've had hotly contested races
before that have been divisive, and
we've had hotly contested races that
weren’t,’’ he said. “‘It just depends on
the attitude of everybody. It needs to
be ‘let the best man win and then sup-
port the nominee of our party.’ ”’

The retreat speaker Friday night
will be New York businessman Lewis
E. Lehrman, a frequently mentioned
GOP presidential possibility. Lehr-
man is speaking this week in his role
as national chairman of Citizens for
America, a grassroots civic league
with a chairman in each of Virginia’s
10 Congressional districts.

At Saturday lunch, the
Republicans will hear from J. Wil-
liam Middendorf II, U.S. ambassa-
dor to the Organization for American
States, who will speak on Central
American issues.

J. Douglas Holladay, an associate
director of the White House public
liaison office, will speak Sunday on
religion in politics. Holladay’s office
said he specializes in education, fam-
ily and environmental issues and in
the concerns of Protestant churches.

Beeton, a 1939 W&L graduate, ex-
plained that mass meetings are open
and that anyone can attend. He said
the Rockbridge Combined Commit-
tee, which includes the county and
the cities of Lexington and Buena
Vista, will have 17 votes at the state
convention.

He said the meeting will elect dele-
gates who are then free to vote as
they wish at the convention.

He said he is unaware of any plan-
ned challenges to the Rockbridge
area representatives in the Virginia
General Assembly — Democrat
Frank W. Nolen, 24th District Sena-
tor; Republican S. Vance Wilkins Jr..,
delegate for the 24th District, includ-
ing northern Rockbridge County and
Lexington; and independent Lacey
E. Putney, delegate for the 19th
District, including southern
Rockbridge County and Buena Vista.

2 4, The Ri

Rezoning

 

From Staff Reports

 

The University’s targeted loca-
tion for the new dormitory is an
irea behind Davis and Gilliam
‘ormitories, where an uninhabi-
ed house, a bottling plant and
parking lots are now, according to
Frank A. Parsons, assistant to the
president.

Washington and Lee requested
ast week that the Lexington Plan-
ning Commission rezone the en-
tire area bounded by Nelson,
Washington and Lee streets so
that the dormitory can be con-
structed.

That area, with the exception of
the plot of land on which the Chi
Psi fraternity house sits, is in a
seneral residential zone, in which
construction of any building other
than a duplex (two-family unit) is
prohibited.

W&L hopes to have the property
rezOned into the central business
district, allowing the construction
f.the dormitory.

The planning commission has
tentatively scheduled a_ public
hearing on the request for Dec. 20
15 p.m. but that may be postpon-
ed for a week or two, Chairman
Henry L. Ravenhorst said.

W&L does not own all of the pro-
perty in the area it wants rezoned
and hopes to acquire some of that
property, Parsons said yesterday.

The Clifton Forge Ice & Bottling
Co, owns two plots of land near the
intersection of Nelson and Wash-
ington streets and Lucy P. Acker-
ly and William and Lucy P. Acker-
'y own the two plots of land next to
St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic
Church on Nelson Street, accord-
ing to records in the Lexington
commissioner of revenue’s office.

W&L is attempting to acquire
the land owned by both the bottl-
ing company and the Ackerly’s,
Parsons said. The house on the

\ckerly’s property has been unin-
habited for about two years, he
added.

“We know that the Coca-Cola
plant is interested and we know
that the Ackerly family is inter-
ested in selling,” Parsons said.

That location was chosen for the
new dormitory because of its
proximity to the Warner Center,
other housing and the academic
campus, said Parsons, who is

chairman of the Residential Ac-

commodations subcommittee of
the Coeducation Steering Commit-
tee.

The dormitory is expected to ac-

commodate about 240 students,
most of whom probably will be up-
perclassmen or law students, Par-
sons said. It is hoped that the dor-
mitory would be completed in
time to open in September 1987.

The dormitory also would fea-
ture some “‘common space,’’ such
as kitchens or lounges, on each
hall, Parsons added.

A “concept” for the new dor-
mitory will be presented to the
board of trustees at its meeting
next month, Parsons said.

At its last meeting, the board
authorized the University ‘‘to pur-
sue the purchase of the property,”’
Parsons said.

The Richmond architectural
firm of Marcellus, Wright, Cox &
Smith will design the building
with the help of GWSM Inc., land-
scape architects from Pittsburgh,
Parsons said.

By May, the committee hopes to
have a “more refined’’ plan to
present to the board, and Parsons
said construction, which is ex-
pected to last 18 to 20 months,
should begin by Ootober.

If the land is acquired, Parsons
said, the University also hopes to
turn the intersection of Nelson and
Washington streets into another
entrance onto campus in “‘an in-

Land the University is seeking to purchase Fd

192.0

 

viting and attractive way.”’

The University has informed
area residents about the planning
commission’s upcoming public
hearing, said Parsons, who added
that he is planning to attend the
hearing.

The current zones were estab-
lished after the Davis, Baker and
Gilliam dormitories had been
built, which is why those dormi-
tories can exist on property in a
general residential zone, accord-
ing to Ravenhorst.

If the University is unable to ac-
quire the bottling company pro-
perty and the Ackerly property, it
may try to build the dormitory on
what property it does own in the
area or will consider other loca-
tions, Parsons said.

Additional University housing is
needed because of the increase in
the student body expected as a re-
sult of coeducation next fall and
the fact that women often are
more likely to want to live on cam-
pus, Parsons said.

The University also investi-
gated the possibility of buying the
land along Washington Street bet-
ween the bottling plant and Gil-
liam Dormitory but was informed
it is not for sale, Parsons said.

Christmas shopping

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee students
either are not aware that Christmas
is in three weeks or they are planning
to do their shopping at home, accord-
ing to many of the merchants in Lex-
ington.

Local business people say few stu-
dents have been making the rounds
of city stores in recent weeks. Bill
Mason of the Lexington Dry Goods
Co. said that up to this point, it ap-
pears that W&L students aren’t plan-
ning to do their shopping in town. His
store has had a drastic price reduc-
tion on its entire stock since the day
after Thanksgiving, he said, but busi-
ness has not picked up.

Caroline Brown, also of Lexington
Dry Goods, said that ‘‘it may not
have hit them yet’’ that the holidays
are so close. On the other hand, she
added, students might just be plan-
ning to wait until they get home to
shop.

That practice is what Alvin-Dennis
owner Alvin Carter is trying to fight.
Carter stressed that students should
“stay away from the big city
crowds”’ and do Christmas shopping
here in Lexington. He said that a
good number of W&L students shop
in his store... ““We try to encourage
it.’ The most popular items for
Christmas this year, he said, are
accessory items such as belts, ties
and cuff links. These are more
salable than suits, he added.

Also big sellers, Carter said, are
flannel shirts and sweaters. One stu-
dent shopping at Alvin-Dennis said
he was doing his own Christmas
shopping. ‘‘My mother doesn’t know
what I want and I know where to find
what I want in Lexington,” he said.
He said that he planned to do all of his

other Christmas shopping at home.

The Lexington Shop for Pappagallo
seems to appeal more to law students
than to undergraduates, according to
Maryjohn Payne and Susan Craw-
ford, the owners. They said that those
students who do shop at Pappagallo
tend to buy presents along the lines of
jewelry, purses, gloves, belts or
sweaters. Most of the shopping
seems to be done for mothers and
girlfriends, they said.

Crawford stressed the advantages
of shopping in Lexington. ‘Who

 

issiow...

wants to hassle with shopping when
you get home? Get it out of the way
now.”

Most stores are planning some type
of Christmas special for shoppers.
There are extended shopping hours
planned in many of the downtown
stores this Saturday night in conjunc-
tion with the Chamber of Com-
merce’s ‘Holiday in Lexington”
weekend. The stores participating
will be open until 8 p.m. Saturday,
and many are planning to serve re-
freshments for shoppers.

To help kick off the Christmas
season, the Lexington-Rockbridge
County Chamber of Commerce is
sponsoring two events this weekend.

Tomorrow evening’s Lexington
Christmas Parade will feature the re-
turn of the award-winning military
color guard from Washington and
Lee’s military science department.

W&L’s color guard last year won
first prize for best marching unit.
The color guard is under the com-
mand of junior Tony Pfaff, the W&L
Ranger Company executive officer.

The Christmas Parade begins at
6:30 p.m. at Lexington High School,
travels down Main Street and turns
onto Nelson Street, where it disbands
in the Maxway parking lot.

said this week he is working on the
plans with architect Jim Wheeler of
Dallas. The planning commission
recommended to the city council Oct.
11 that the conditional use permit be
granted tothe fraternity.

A public hearing on the conditional
use permit application has been
scheduled for tonight’s meeting of
the city council. Council is expected

to decide at that time whether to

grant the permit.

Ravenhorst said that ‘general
clean-up work”’ is underway on the

On Saturday night, the Chamber of

was destroyed by fire in April.
Thomas J. Felli, who was president
of the fraternity, was killed in the
fire.

Investigators later said the fire had
been deliberately set, and a suspect
was arrested and charged with mur-
der and arson in connection with the
blaze.

Ravenhorst said a key remaining
question about the construction of a
new fraternity house, which would be
located at 112 Preston St., the site of
the old house, is how the parking
space for the cars of occupants would
be handled. Ravenhorst said that he
and Wheeler have devised a plan for
the parking area and that he would

any questions that the city council
might have aboutit.

If council approves the conditional
use permit, the contractor would
then submit the plans of the house to
Lexington Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Don J. Mette. If Mette
approves the plans, he would then is-
sue a building permit allowing the
construction of the house to begin.

Ravenhorst said he and Wheeler
plan to complete the drawings as
soon as possible so that the applica-
tion for the building permit can be
submitted as soon as possible if the
conditional use permit is granted.

Ravenhorst said he believes the ci-
ty council will approve the permit ap-
plication.

Assembling next year’s University
Catalogue has proven to be a much
more difficult task than normal, As-
sociate Dean of the College Pamela
Simpson said last week.

Simpson said she wasn’t certain
exactly when the catalog will be
finished. There are two major rea-
sons why the book has run into trou-
ble.

First, Director of Publications
Romulus T. Weatherman is ill. The
task of preparing the catalog has
been turned over to News Office Di-
rector Jeff Hanna and Weatherman’s
secretary, Joyce Harris, who have
been working on the catalog since the
beginning of October.

Secondly, the decision to admit
women has added a new twist to the
book. Hanna and Harris are present-
ly making sure that there will be a
consistency in gender references.

‘‘The adopted policy is that we will
avoid gender-specific pronouns,”
Simpson said.

Similarly, the National Council of
Churches recently produced an ex-
perimental selection of Bible pas-
sages in which female references
were added and neutral language
was substituted for male terms. In
this new version of the scriptures,

‘“‘Lord’’ becomes ‘‘Sovereign.”’

 

 

and

Weatherman’s absence probably
will result in a marked decrease in
the number of new pictures in next
year’s catalog.

At a faculty meeting this month,
each department will announce any
changes to be made in the book. Each
section is sent to the corresponding
department to check accuracy.

Simpson stressed that accuracy in
the catalog is extremely important.
There is a contractual agreement be-
tween the faculty and the students
that guarantees that a student may
graduate under any catalog issued
during his tenure at the University,
Simpson said.

Next year’s catalog will include the
General Education Requirements for
graduation as well as the new compu-
ter science major courses and re-
quirements.

Harold Jackson.

  

Why did the chicken cross the road’?

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

A remodeled Kentucky Fried
‘Chicken will open on Nelson Street in
“April, and it will feature more of a
dining room atmosphere that will be
“very nice for the community,” ac-
cording to Harold Jackson, director
of real estate and construction for
‘Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Jackson said in a telephone inter-
‘view from his office in Columbia,
-Tenn., that ‘‘the former lot we oc-
cupied was substandard— it was not
*big enough to handle the sales that
,we feel arehere.”’

“The leased building was old and
yneeded remodeling, so instead of
pouring $100,000 to $125,000 into a
building that is not even ours, we de-
cided to purchase our own property,”
he explained.

He called the renovation an exam-
‘ple of ‘“‘image enhancement.”’ Every
seven to 10 vears Kentucky Fried

Chicken tries to update its facilities
so it will remain attractive to custo-
mers, he said.

Jackson said the new restaurant,
which will be located across the
street from the old location, will
feature a drive-through window as
well, but the real emphasis will be
placed on creating a ‘‘family-type
dining area.”

The dining room will have a blue
and gray color scheme. ‘‘We unders-
tand that there are some colleges in
that town of Lexington,’ Jackson
chuckled.

Jackson said his business doesn’t
fee] the need to compete with Lexing-
ton’s hamburger restaurants be-
cause he feels the businesses draw
different clientele.

‘We figure that they’re comple-
mentary,” he said. ‘‘McDonald’s will
attract more of the student trade, but
by drawing these crowds, we will
also benefit because people will eat
with us to avoid that rushed feeling.”

Christmas party
a success for IU

 

‘By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

’ “Anunmitigated success.’

_ That is how Independent Union
Vice President Luke Cornelius de-
‘scribed Saturday night’s IU Christ-
mas party, held in the Cockpit and
featuring music by the Nabobs.

* “It was really a do-or-die situa-
tion,’ Cornelius said. ‘‘Nobody an-
ticipated the success we had, but it
‘was really a good crowd, good band
and good time.”’

The party, similar to a Wednesday
‘night in the Pit, featured free pop-
.corn, discount beer prices and egg-
nog supplied by the senior class at
‘Southern Seminary Junior College.

The party ‘“‘worked well in terms of
planning further events,” which ten-
"tatively include a party with South-
yern Seminary in late January and a
Fancy Dress alternative to the closed
"fraternity parties.

“A lot of guys aren’t comfortable
with the fraternities,” Cornelius
said. “If you’re an independent, or
-you’re from another house, you feel
,you’re on somebody else’s ground.

WLUR to carry
Met opera Sat.

Rossini’s ‘‘The Barber of Seville”
»will be broadcast live from the stage
,of the Metropolitan Opera House Sat-

urday, Dec. 8, at 2 p.m. on WLUR-
*FM (91.5 FM).
. Silvio Varviso will conduct the pro-
duction, which will feature Kathleen
‘Battle, Dalmacio Gonzalez, Leo Nuc-
ci and Enzo Dara.

WLUR-FM will carry all 20 Metro-
‘politan Opera broadcasts of the Met’s

1984-85 season.

With the IU, you have input, and
you're not gate-crashing.”’

Any independent can make sugges-
tions and vote at IU meetings, which
are informal and open.

“We just want to hear people’s
ideas,”’ Cornelius said. ‘‘We’re al-
ways looking for more independents
to take an interest, and hopefully
we’ll have a very good turnout”’ after
Saturday night’s bash.

But, as Cornelius said, the IU “‘is
not just a party organization.’’ It also
takes an active part in the intramu-
ral sports program. The Independent
Union sponsored a champion rac-
quetball team in this term’s in-
tramurals and interest in next term’s
teams is already ‘really great,’’ he
added.

“There are a lot more sports in the
winter term, so it will be a big thing
then,” Cornelius said. Any indepen-
dent can sign up for IM’s with the
Union.

Five guys who are good friends and
will show up for the games can come
to us and we'll sponsor them,’’ he ad-
ded.

Also, someone who just wants to
play a sport can sign up for one of the
TU’s teams.

“Theoretically, we can put a team
together out of 500 guys, as opposed
to 60 for the fraternities,’’ Cornelius
said. “It doesn’t work that way, but
we can sponsor as many people as we
want.”

Academically, the Independent
Union is trying to put together a
“cold test” file:

“By next term, we hope to have a
well organized and all-inclusive ‘cold
test’ file. Anybody who brings in an
old test will have access to the file,
and we’ll make copies of their old
tests for them,’’ Cornelius explained.

A system for peer counseling and
advice also is being arranged.

the door was fine,” Datz said,
“and when he walked out it was
broken.”’

Datz has no leads in the case
and asks that anyone with infor-
mation about the incident contact
him or University proctor Charles
“Murph” Murray.

The door, still in one piece with
tape over the cracks in the glass,
will cost about $150 to replace,
Datz estimated.

 

 

Still kicking

Youth soccer league thrives in Big Lex

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

Early autumn mornings for Lex-
ington youngsters are no longer re-
served for cartoons, sleeping late or
even Little Leauge football games.
Some 250 children, ages six to 14, are
now aspiring soccer stars in the Lex-
ington Youth Soccer League, founded
seven years ago by Frederic L. Kir-
gis Jr., dean of the Washington and
Lee law school. The league is divided
into three age groups and both boys
and girls can compete in its 10 Satur-
day fall season.

There are many members of the
W&L community who help make this
program extremely different from
other youth athletic programs that
suffer from the “Little League Syn-

drome.” There are no screaming
parents who expect their kids to be
Peles, nor are there scuffles or ill
feelings between members of oppos-
ing teams. Rather than the ‘‘win at
all costs,’’ Lombardi-style philoso-
phy that often finds its way into these
programs, the coaches say this lea-
gue stresses the participation and the
excitement of having fun while play-
ing the game.

“The pressure is virtually non-
existent here,’ said Jeff Hanna, the
W&L News Office director and coach
of the Lexington Panthers. ‘‘The par-
ents are so supportive, and that’s
really good for the kids.”

Journalism professor Hampden
Smith, another of the Panther coach-
es, said that ‘“‘some coaches have
been let go because they were too in-
tent on winning.”’

Both Smith and Hanna have sons
playing in the league. Smith, whose
daughter formerly played in the pro-
gram, calls his first year of coaching
a ‘‘den mother sort of thing.’’

History Professor J. Holt Mer-
chant, who began as a coach in the
league seven years ago, said that ini-
tially the league was total chaos.”
But thanks to W&L soccer coach Rolf
Piranian, Dean Kirgis, and the ef-
forts of many other members of the
W&L faculty, including Alfred Fra-
lin, Barry Machado, Taylor Sanders,
John Knox, Michael Pleva and
Thomas Williams, the program, Mer-
chant said, has vastly improved.
Merchant calls it ‘‘phenomenal,”’ but
he is now a referee in the league be-
cause as a coach he was ‘‘so nasty on
the sidelines’ and he found himself
‘‘abusing six-year olds.”’

Early Decision number higher

 

From Staff Reports

 

The admissions office received
more than twice as many Early Deci-
sion applications as it did last year,
and total applications have increased
by 61 percent.

The deadline for Early Decision
applications was Dec. 1, and the
University received the prayerfully
prepared applications of 191 high
school seniors — 54 of them women
—whose first choice of college is
Washington and Lee.

Last year’s Early Decision pool
consisted of 90 students—none of
them women.

Acceptance notifications will be
mailed Dec. 15, and admissions coun-
selor Bennett L. Ross said that usual-
ly about half of Early Decision appli-
cants are accepted.

“It’s not inconceivable that we’ll
have a fourth of our class filled from
Early Decision,”’ Ross said. The tar-
get class size is 400 students, includ-
ing 80 to 100 women.

A number of students submit appli-
cations in the fall but are not Early
Decision candidates. The total num-

ber of applicants to date is 351 men
and 127 women — a total of 478, com-
pared to 297 at this time last year.

“If we continue this trend, we’ll
have 1,800 applications for next
year’s freshman class, with 300 to 400
of them from women,” Ross said.
The admissions office received appli-
cations from 1,502 students last year
and offered admission to 60 percent
of them.

“So far the quality looks good —not
just quantity,’’ Ross said of the Early
Decision pool. ‘‘I think we’ll have a
class with good balance — a well-
rounded class.”

‘‘As far as the quality of the female
applicants we’ve had so far, some
look good on paper; others don’t,”
Ross said. “That perhaps reflects
what we’ve seen from male applica-
tions in the past.”’

He said many of the applicants
have been involved in student gov-
ernment and other activities. ‘‘Their
strength is not just based on their
SAT, class rank or GPA,”’ he said.
“It’s also involvement and leader-
ship — these are people who will take
an active interest in W&L.”’

Police make RAID on DUls

 

From Staff Reports

 

The new Report All Intoxicated
Drivers (RAID) program began this
week in Lexington. The purpose, as
might be guessed from the title, is to
stem drunk driving.

Under the program, anyone who
suspects a motorist of driving under
the influence is encouraged to notify
police.

Police Chief L.O. Sutton said the
program is ‘‘to help police find drunk
drivers.’’ He made the point that this

was not an opportunity for one angry
neighbor to get back at another.

‘“‘We don’t want someone calling us
up and telling us someone’s driving
drunk...just to get them in trouble,”’
he added.

To report a drunk driver, call the
Lexington Police Department at
463-2112. You will need to give a de-
scription of the car, its location and
your name. Sutton said that the
investigating officer will only stop
the car if he observes the usual char-
acteristics of a drunk driver.

Ross said the avalanche of re-
quests for campus tours and inter-
views continues. ‘‘October and Nov-
ember are traditionally the heaviest
months, but January is no cakewalk,
either,’’ he added.

‘We have a commitment to single
interviews and the personal contact
we want to maintain at a school like
this, but we also have a commitment
to spending time with these applica-
tions and doing enough analysis,” he
said. ‘‘It’s balancing those two.”’

Ross said the female proportion of
each class will be ‘‘scaled upward”
until 1992, when the plan is to have a
student body of 1,500, including 1,000
or more men and 400 to 500 women—
‘‘a 60-40 split.” The present student
body size is 1,350.

“There will be a_ significant
concentration of women, but not at
the expense of men,”’ he said.

 

 

“You see, I’m somewhat hyperac-
tive,”’ he explained.

Merchant said he wanted to stay in-
volved and contribute to the pro-
gram, so he began officiating. Three
years ago he became a qualified high
school official when he became in-
volved with the Lexington High
School soccer program, which was
also founded by many of the same
W&L soccer enthusiasts. He is now
qualified for the college ranks.

Merchant said he and the other
faculty members involved in the lea-
gue are “going out of their way to
educate parents and the kids’’ with
their philosophy of athletics.

“We're having fun, and that’s
what’s important,”’ he said. ‘““W&L
makes it possible for us to exist. We
owe so much to Dick Miller and Bill
McHenry.”

Cagers win fourth at home

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team got 16 points each from
senior co-captains Kevin McClatchy
and Scott Shannon in raising its
season record to 4-3 with a 67-51 win
over Averett College last night.

McClatchy hit five of his eight
shots from the floor and was a per-
fect six of six from the free throw line
in his best performance of the year.

Shannon was good on eight of his 12
field goal attempts and led all re-
bounders with nine.

The Generals were sluggish during
the first 10 minutes of the game, lead-
ing by only six points at 16-10. W&L
then slowed the tempo, holding the
ball for 3:30 before David Wilkinson
broke free for a short jumper to up
the lead to eight points. The Generals
then pulled away from the Cougars to
hold a 25-14 halftime lead.

Averett kept the game close during
the first 10 minutes of the second
half, trailing at one point by only five
points at 37-32.

The Generals thwarted the Cou-
gars’ comeback attempt, extending
their lead to 14 points at 50-36 after
senior Bill Yates’ three-point play
with 7:19 remaining in the game.

W&L continued to add to its lead as
the fouling Averett team sent the
Generals to the charity line 19 times
during the second half, with 16 of
those 19 being converted.

W&L had its biggest lead of the
night, 61-41, with 3:12 remaining be-
fore holding on to win by the final
margin of 16 points.

“There were some good signs to-
night,’ head coach Verne Canfield
said. “‘Kevin came out of his slump,
and Scott hada good game.

“T’m not satisfied. We’re still fight-
ing it a little bit,’’ Canfield added.
“We’re not playing consistently.
We're not satisfied with 4-3. I’m go-
ing topush them.”

In earlier action, W&L split its pair
of games with North Carolina teams,
UNC-Greensboro and Greensboro
College.

Last Thursday, the Generals de-
feated UNC-Greensboro at home,
76-64,

W&L trailed by as many as 15

the Spartans before reeling off 11
straight points to pull within six
points, 37-31, at halftime.

The second half was dominated by
WA&L as the Generals shot 76 percent

from the floor. W&L hit 28 of its 45
free throw attempts, also, compared
to just eight of 16 for the Spartans.

Yates pumped in 25 points to lead
the Generals, including 11 of 13 free
throws. David Wilkinson scored 10
points in the win.

Thursday in the Warner Center. The Generals also won
last night to move their record to4-3.

“We were down a little bit in the
first half,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘We were
patient, and they eventually played
into our hands.”’

The Generals’ road game woes
continued Saturday as Greensboro
College soundly defeated W&L 83-59
in Greensboro.

Greensboro jumped out to a 44-30
halftime lead in coasting to the easy
win.

W&L had a dismal shooting night
against the Hornets, connecting on
only 39 percent of its shots. The Gene-
rals also committed 21 turnovers.

Sophomore Jeff Harralson led the
Generals with his 15 points and six re-
bounds. Shannon tallied 14 points
against the Hornets.

Greensboro shot 59.6 percent
against W&L as every Hornet player
scored in the win.

W&L is now a perfect 4-0 at home
during the season, but has lost all
three of its road contests.

“T totally believe in these guys,”’
Canfield said. “If we can get a high
level of consistency, we can achieve
the goals we’ve set. We've got a
tough road ahead of us.”’

The Generals return to action over
the Christmas break when they tra-
vel to Pennsylvania for the Franklin
and Marshall Tournament on Jan. 4
and 5. The team’s next home contest
will be Wed., Jan. 9, against ODAC
foe Bridgewater, an 86-46 loser to

LL Officiating, it seems, has come

under greater attack in the past few months than at any time in recent ’
memory. We have seen examples of. the problem in football games, -
(see Texas, Richmond) tennis matches (McEnroe’s cannot in full be .
disputed), basketball games (Monday night in Cameron Hall) and
almost every athletic contest where the decisions of an arbiter of the
court or field play an important role, :

What one has to ask is 1) Are these questionings legitimate? and 2)
What, if anything, can be done about this state of affairs? It cannot be
denied that a referee’s decision can be instrumental, indeed more im-
portant than a player’s ability, in the outcome of an athletic contest. ’
Yes, that’s right, despite all of you out there who were brought up
under that admirable but not always correct philosophy that ‘‘you
never lose a game because of the officials.’’ True winners rise above ,
such trivial things as an official’s mistake, we are told.

Well, children, as we go about how things really happen, the above
just doesn’t cut it. An official can hold that old intangible, Momentum,
in the palm of his hand, and each little whistle blow is a plus or a minus
for your team’s chances. Given that one mistaken whistle at a key
point in a game most certainly has the potential to send the game one y
way or the other.

And therein lies the problem. If you can have games being decided
by inept whistle blowers rather than the abilities of the participants
then I think you have to say that’s something wrong.

Therefore, it is obvious poor officiating can detract from the playing
of the game. John McEnroe — and by no means am I advocating that
everyone adopt a code of conduct similar to his — questions not only y
calls but those making the calls, and he may be right on target this
time.

If we supposedly have athletes who in some sense are the best in
their area, should we not also have officials to match that level of pro-
ficiency? Even the lowliest, 19th-string offensive tackle has to practice
everyday. Should not officials, who are on the field more than any
player, have this same level of practice so they are prepared to meet
any situation? Granted, again, that officials go through training pro-
grams and are evaluated periodically. But surely something’s not up
to snuff when you have situations like those for the Longhorns{his fall,
or like that experienced by Marty Fletcher’s Keydets Monday night.
We're talking Division I here, the highest level of NCAA basketball,
and we’ve got calls being made that you'd expect from a 15-year-old
refereeing CYO games. It might not be fair to attack someone’s judg-
ment, but then games’ being decided by those not playing isn’t fair
either.

The conclusion to all this is not cheery, however. Officials can be on-
ly human, and therefore mistake-prone. Stronger requirements,
tougher tests and more explicit scrutiny must be part of the solution. ‘
Another part is probably pay. (I mean, not many of us wanted to be
referees when we grew up, but if it became financially worth the ef-
fort, who’s to say quality wouldn’t improve.) It may be trite, but if no
bad calls are made, no one’s going to complain, and I do think that’s a
possibility...

....Checking our pre-Christmas Colonnade, swimming and wrestling ‘
Generals got, for the most part, what they wanted out of the weekend ’
(third-place finishes among some tough competition). Tip of the cap to
wrestlers Joe O'Neill and Jeff Dixon and swimmer Eric Sullivan on
their virtuoso performances. Let’s hope improvement continues on ’
course...Hoopsters may have finally put the ship into smooth waters.
Christmas break contest against Franklin and Marshall should be in- :
teresting and a good primer for upcoming ODAC schedule...And some '
fall extras: Congratulations to General grid seniors Harry Golliday
and Gene Girard on earning All-State recognition...

Last weekend, the Division III
Washington and Lee Generals finish-
ed third in the Virginia Intercol-
legiate Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionships. Although the rest of the
field was composed of Division I
teams, the Generals, with 298 points,
finished behind James Madison (703
points) and William and Mary (397)
and ahead of VMI (296). Since the
team record depends only on dual
meets, the Generals still are 2-0.

The Generals didn’t finish in third
place because of poor times; actual-
ly, they swam faster this week than
they did last week when they defeat-
ed Johns Hopkins. Rather, the finish
was because of the small bench the
team had. Many swimmers sat out
the meet because it interfered with
Friday’s classes.

‘We gave up points to help grade
point averages,’’ Coach Page Remil-
lard said, ‘“‘which is part of the team

Grapplers 3rd in Invitational

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty wrestling team finished third last
weekend in the Washington and Lee
Invitational at the Warner Center.
The Generals, with 54 1-2 points,
finished behind the champion York
(Pa.) College (74) and runner-up
Hiram (72).

“It was a good team performance.
Third place is a respectable finish,”
head wrestling coach Gary Franke
said.

Franke said that he thought that
his team could have finished’ higher
last weekend if the team had not lost

so many semifinal matches. Eight
Generals qualified for the semis, but

the point differences between first
and third place is significant enough
to hurt a team. The champion earns
10 points for his team while the third-
place finisher receives only four.

Coach Franke did add that his
team did very well in the consolation
finals.

Winning first place honors for the
Generals last weekend were Jeff Dix-
on and Joe O'Neill. Dixon defeated
Jim Ludden of Scranton to success-
fully defend the title that he won in
this tournament last year at 190 lbs.,
while O’Neill defeated Hans Kirr of
Hiram in the finals of the 177 lb. com-
petition.

Junior Larry Anker also placed
high for the Generals last weekend,
earning runner-up laurels at the 142
Ib. weight class.

(fourth place, 167 Ibs.), Jeff Mazza
(fourth place, 134 Ibs.), Brian Lifsted
(fourth-place, 126 lbs.), and Steve
Castle and Dave Cox with a third-and
a fourth-place finish at the 118 Ib.
class.

The reason for two Generals plac-
ing in the same weight class was that
W&L was able to field a B-team to fill
in some of the open spots left by
teams not having wrestlers in certain
weight classes.

The Generals had scheduled to
meet Lynchburg in their second dual
meet of the season and their last
match before Christmas break last
night at Warner Center, but the bad
weather prevented Lynchburg from
traveling to Lexington. The Generals
are scheduled to return to action
Saturday, Jan. 5, ina four-team tour-

philosophy and our program.”

While the whole team swam well,

freshman Eric Sullivan was the most
notable. He won the 500-yard free-
style in 4:45.6 and the 1,650-yard
freestyle in 16:47.87. Both times
qualified him for the NCAA Division
III Championships. Also qualifying
for the NCAAs was sophomore Jay
ReVille, who finished in second place
on the 400-yard individual medley
with a time of 4:17.58.

“T can’t think of a guy who had a
poor performance,’’ Remillard said.
“T can think of a lot of good swim-
ming.”

Under the category of ‘‘good swim-
ming” came three freshmen: Simon
Perez, who finished third in the 100-
yard breaststroke (1:03.05), Andy
Forbes, who won the consolation fin-
al in the 100-yard backstroke (59.51)
and Craig Garneau, the consolation
final winner of the 200-yard breast-
stroke (2:02.04). According to Remil-
lard, all of the freshmen have beaten
their personal lifetime best times,
which usually doesn’t happen until
February.

“IT surpassed my lifetime in the
first meet versus VMI,” Garneau
said. “It’s because of water polo, we

It wasn’t exactly your Super

as their professional counter-

Of course, we're talking about
Monday’s championship game of

freshmen coached by dorm coun-
selor Dan DuPre was just too
much to handle for the squad
coached by counselor Tom Mack
as DuPre’s crew ran away from
Mack’s squad, 21-7.

The two teams, both from the
second floor of Graham-Lees

the final following a long regular
season and grueling playoffs that
saw both start out as wild cards,
earning their place in the finals
with wins in last week’s semifi-

“That's the purpose of water polo,”’
junior David Lewis said. ‘‘It builds
speed, and guys usually beat lifetime
now or at the very end of the season.”’

Like many athletes at Washington
and Lee, the swimmers will report
back to school on Dec. 26 to resume
practices. The team members say
they are not thrilled with the shorten-
ed vacation but that they support its
purpose.

“I know hard work will pay off in
the end,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘I’m not going
back on Dec. 26 to swim slow.”’

While Lewis laughed, teammate
Garneau added, ‘‘And I don’t wake
up at 6 a.m. to weightlift to do poorly,
either.”

The swim team members say they
recognize the value of hard work.

“T think we can do as well as we
want this season,’’ Garneau said.
“We've got the coaching and we
practice hard.”

The last competition before the
Christmas vacation is the Senior In-
vitationals in Charlottesville Dec. 15
and 16.

Debaters, Falwell’s students argue religion

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

LYNCHBURG — The same day
the Rev. Jerry Falwell’s lawyers
gave their opening arguments in the
libel trial pitting them against the
self-proclaimed ‘‘Mr. Sleaze,’’ better
known as Hustler publisher Larry
Flynt, two Washington and Lee de-
bate team members roadtripped to
Falwell’s Liberty Baptist College for
a debate on school prayer.

The topic of Monday evening's de-
bate was ‘‘Resolved: America should
have voluntary prayer in public
schools.” Liberty Baptist freshmen
Jamie Lund and Jeff Baity took the
affirmative viewpoint while W&L
juniors Ted LeClercq and Bob Kelly
found themselves on the ‘‘liberal’’
side of the question. At the conclusion
of the debate, the 58 students in the
audience were asked to choose not a
winner, but to choose whether they
were in favor of the resolution.

Although the affirmative support-
ers outnumbered the negative back-
ers 43-15, LeClercq and Kelly ap-
peared to have drawn some of ‘‘Jer-
ry’s kids”’ to their side.

Following an opening prayer that
was inoffensive to most, Lund pre-
sented the affirmative position. Lund
argued that the strict interpretation
of the First Amendment creates fear
and uncertainty, leads to the loss of
various religious freedoms and fur-
ther reinterpretations of the Consti-
tution, causes a reduction in patri-

“Hansel and Gretel,” the
familiar fairy tale written by
the brothers Grimm and set to
music in the late 19th century
by Engelbert Humperdinck,
will be performed in Lexington
Sunday by the Ensemble Com-
pany of the Cincinnati Opera.

The 3 p.m. performance at
Lexington High School, spon-
sored by Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series, is one of the
activities of the ‘Holiday in
Lexington’’ weekend.

In the production, the witch is
played by a male and Hansel is
portrayed by a female.

 

otism and hurts America’s reputa-
tion as a free country.

Lund never proposed a plan or
defined the terms of the resolution
being debated, although he was ques-
tioned by both the opponents and
members of the audience. According
to proper debate procedures, the bur-
den of proof was placed on Liberty
Baptist to show a need for change
and to present a workable plan. Be-
cause they did not define the terms of
the resolution or present a definite
plan, the Liberty Baptist students
lost on strictly technical terms.

In contrast to Lund’s overly brisk
speaking style, Kelly presented
W&L’s opening arguments in a very
relaxed manner. The negative case
was that there is no need to change
the status quo because it does not
prevent any students from silent
prayer. Also, argued Kelly, an
amendment in favor of school prayer
is ‘‘against God’s Word and Scrip-
ture.”’

Kelly attempted to prove his case
by showing that there is no attitudi-
nal or structural barrier preventing
silent prayer. ‘‘On this point we are
reminded of the cartoon we saw a few
days ago,” said Kelly. ‘‘As long as
there are history tests, there will
always be prayers in the schools.”’

Kelly cited Matthew 6, verses five
through seven, to illustrate his point
about the Word of God.

After a brief recess, Baity present-
ed a very ministerial type of argu-
ment in both tone and content, con-
tending that the Supreme Court has

Cincinnati Opera’s version of
the 90-minute opera is sung in
English by its resident compa-
ny of professional artists ‘‘EC-
CO!”’. The traveling production
is staged by Gordon Ostrowski,
““ECCO!”’ stage director, under
the direction of Cincinnati Ope-
ra General Director James de
Blasis.

“ECCO!”’ was created in Oct-
ober 1980 as the culmination of
the Cincinnati Opera’s first Ed-
ucation/Outreach plan. The
program brought opera and the
singing voice to over 90,000 peo-
ple last season.

“Hansel and Gretel” is the

misinterpreted the First Amendment
to the Constitution to such an extent
that the Constitution has decreased
to no value. “Any violation of one
freedom is the violation of all
freedoms...,"’ said Baity, who asked
how a child praying in school is vio-
lating the Constitution while the Su-
preme Court opens each session ask-
ing for God’s guidance and the incar-
cerated are given the right to see a
priest.

LeClercq followed with the second
negative speech. ‘“‘We only advocate
freedom of choice for all,” said the
W&L junior. LeClercq cited the Sov-
iet Union and Iran as examples of
countries that forced beliefs on peo-
ple, and said he did not feel people
should look to the state, the teachers,
and the school boards to orchestrate
and initiate prayer.

Debate moderator Cecil Kramer
then opened the floor to ‘audience
heckling,’ but there was very little
heckling from the students, who ask-
ed questions of both teams and made
speeches supporting both sides.

The heckling session provided
some of the liveliest discourse, al-
though much of it focused on Bible
study and holiday celebrations,
neither of which were covered by the
resolution at hand. Some of the stu-
dents cited Scripture and explained
that Kelly’s reference to the book of
Matthew was taken out of context.
Neither of the W&L debaters attemp-
ted to argue scripture or religious
history with the throng of Liberty
Baptist students.

“Kids have no sense of God any-
more. They think He’s a science fic-
tion character,”’ said one student,
who noted that Congress begins each
session with a prayer. Kelly respond-
ed that a sense of God must come
from the home and that one must dif-
ferentiate between maturity levels of
Congressmen and grade-school stu-
dents. ‘‘I think the safest thing to do
is take a neutral stance on an issue,”
he said.

One young woman asked what
harm would be done by a voluntary,
teacher-led silent ‘prayer. Kelly said
this would cause peer pressure on im-
pressionable children. ‘‘Peer pres-
sure’s put on everywhere. Give me a
real answer,’’ she retorted.

An argument mentioned by W&L
debate coach Halford Ryan on the
way to Lynchburg appeared to be one
of the negative side’s most effective.
“What if you don’t want to have your
relationship with God at 8:30 in the
morning?’’ queried Ryan.

‘“‘Why must religion be pushed on
them? Why must there be a set
time?” asked one member of the au-
dience. ‘‘I felt that prayer was need-
ed in schools...(but) there’s not a set
time to pray.”

‘You can pray before you go to
school, or you can find time. I found
time,”’ said a former public school
student who was greeted with a
round of applause.

The audience participation was
still dominated by pro-affirmative
speakers.

The Johnson Commerce Scholar-
ship was created in 1974 by many
friends of Lewis Kerr Johnson, the
late professor of administration and
head of the administration depart-
ment at Washington and Lee.

The scholarship is awarded toa ris-
ing junior majoring in business ad-
ministration and seriously planning a

is given to academic record and non-
academic achievement, including

freshmen and sophomores) has been
stressed.”’

Haywood acknowledged that sell-
ing a ticket to an ABC agent without
checking to see if he had a college ID
“twas a mistake on our part’’ and that
“there were a lot of intoxicated peo-
ple there.”

However, he added, training the
nearly 60 students who worked at the
party would be difficult, and barten-
ders often have difficulty determin-
ing when people are intoxicated and
thus should not be served beer.

During Monday evening’s Execu-
tive Committee meeting, several
members expressed concern about
the pavilion party.

“I guess it was probably because I
was sober, but people were pretty out
of hand,” Secretary Sam Dalton said.

Vice President James White said,
‘People were pushing up (toward the
stage), and I could see how we could
have another Who concert.”

First-year law representative
James Crutchfield said, ‘I’m not ad-
vocating banning drinking there, but
I think it’s something we should look
at seriously.”

“T think it’s worthwhile consider-

ing that they not serve alcohol in the
pavilion,”’ he continued. ‘“‘Everybody
drives there, there’s no parking to
speak of and getting out is a hassle.”’

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said some concern about the pavilion
also had been expressed to him.

“T understand from the ABC that it
was a mess, totally out of control,”
he said.

Sutton also noted that his depart-
ment does have jurisdiction over the
pavilion and the road leading to it
because Washington and Lee does
not have a separate police force.

Haywood said that Friday’s party,
which attracted 1,500 to 1,800 people,
was no different from the Homecom-
ing pavilion party. ‘‘I don’t see that
much difference between the Home-
coming crowd and this crowd,” he
added.

Both Haywood and John said the
ABC reported no problems with the
Homecoming party.

John added, though, that “my un-
derstanding is that the situation was
worse this time for a number of rea-
sons,”’ among them an increased
number of parties before the pavilion
party and a concert that lasted long-
er than the Homecoming concert.

“For us to obtain future banquet
licenses,’ Haywood said, ‘‘we’re go-
ing to have to improve on our opera-
ting methods out there.”’

Possible changes may include hir-
ing security personnel and barten-
ders rather than using student SAB
members, and changing the format
of pavilion events, he added.

‘What you may be seeing is a re-
turn toa more concert atmosphere,”’
in which seating would be provided,
rather than “ ’till 1 a.m. bashes.”

reporters Cotton Puryear and John
Winters contributed to this story.

taxpayers want prayer,’’ stated one
woman. Kelly did not argue the fig-
ures with her, but said that it is the
responsibility of the country to pro-
tect minorities. ‘“‘In most schools,
Christians would be in the minority,”
contended another student.

One of the most well-received ar-
guments came from a Canadian stu-
dent near the close of the 45-minute
“‘heckling”’ session. ‘‘In Canada we
have the opportunity to have religi-
ous services, to have religious acts in
school. We all work within the system
and it is working well.”

LeClercq closed by reiterating ar-
guments made by the negative team
during the opening statements. Lund
concluded the debate by repeating
that he was not calling for a constitu-
tional amendment, but for a less
strict interpretation of the Constitu-
tion to stop the violation of human
rights.

Although W&L’s duo lost in the
final vote, many of the Liberty Bap-
tist students approached them after-
ward with words of praise. “You
guys were brave. I was in favor of
what you said,’ exclaimed one stu-
dent. ‘‘I have to admit, I respect you
for coming here,”’ said Baity.

Ryan, LeClerecq and Kelly all
seemed fairly happy with the course
of the debate and the case presented
by the negative team.

“T thought it went well, but we
didn’t expect to change everyone’s
mind. We just wanted to present
some possible problems with prayer
in schools,” LeClercq said.

“‘T had a feeling they were going to
be courteous and polite,’ LeClercq
added. No member of the audience
booed, even after a reference to “a
President who very seldom attends
church, a clutch of loud-mouthed
television evangelists, and cynical
radical right-wing political organiza-
tions.”’

Ryan told his pair afterwards that
they should have driven home the
point that there is no structural bar-
rier blocking school prayer and
should not have debated about reli-
gious clubs and study groups when
they were not covered in the resolu-
tion. The W&L debate coach did feel
that the two handled themselves well
in what they were afraid might be a
hostile environment.

The Liberty Baptist debaters
travel to Lexington in the spring for a
similar confrontation, LeClercq and
Kelly asked the Liberty Baptist de-
baters if they might consider switch-
ing sides if the same question is de-
bated.

Also two W&L debate teams won
trophies in a regional tournament
sponsored at Ferrum College last
weekend by the national forensics
honorary society, Delta Sigma
Rho/Tau Kappa Alpha.

The junior varsity team, compris-
ed of freshman John Starks and soph-
omore Rick Graves, was awarded a
semifinalist trophy. Kelly and
LeClercq received a quarterfinalist
team trophy in the novice division.

who won the Phi Beta Kappa sopho-
more award for the highest grade
point average in his class, agrees. ‘‘If
you haven’t done anything since the
beginning of the term, you won’t do it
ina week,” he said.

At this point in the term, however,
many students find themselves face-
to-face with hundreds of pages of
reading.

“In a case like that, divide your
time well between all of your classes
or decide the best way to use your
time,” Bouffard advised.

In particular, Bouffard
recommended skimming and outlin-
ing those books that have not been
opened frequently during the term.

developing a frame of mind when
reading. ‘“‘The more you realize you
will be taking a test on the material,
the better off you will be,”’ he said.

Spatig noted a common problem,
especially among freshmen, regard-
ing time budgeting. ‘“‘Don’t sacrifice
a class you are doing well in for one
there is little hope for,”’ he said.

Quality study time, according to
Spatig, is more important than
quantity. “Everybody reaches a
point of diminishing returns,”’ he ad-
ded, and, therefore, no one should
pull all-nighters. ‘‘You need four
hours of sleep at the minimum,”

Bouffard said he also believes that
‘‘you reach a point where you are bet-
ter off sleeping than studying.”

Dividing up study time should be a
part of the ‘‘game plan,’’ Elmes
pointed out.

Regardless of a student’s game
plan, though, Bouffard said he reali-
zes that ‘‘you don’t have the time to
do everything you want . . . that is
just the way itis.”

Bouffard and Spatig both recom-
mended taking short breaks during
study time, but especially ‘‘after
each exam and before beginning the
next,’’ Spatig added.

For freshmen, Spatig said, ‘If you
really don’t know what to do, talk to
an upperclassman and ask.”’

As a student counselor, Spatig said
he believes it is most important to
‘learn from the mistakes of this term

. and don’t repeat them in the
next.”

Independents top frats’ GPAs

Frosh independents: 2.54; pledges: 2.17

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

Independents received markedly
higher average grades last term than
did fraternity members, and ad-
ministrators said the gap between
the grade point averages for the two
groups was the greatest in memory.

The average GPA for non-fra-
ternity members was 2.736; the
average for fraternity members was
2.527. The GPA for non-fraternity
members was also higher than that
of any single fraternity. A year ago,
four fraternities had averages higher
than the GPA for non-fraternity
students.

The GPA disparity is even more
clear among members of the fresh-
man class. Freshmen independents
had a GPA of 2.543, while freshmen
pledges had a 2.174 average.

Also, 73 freshmen — one-fifth of the
class — had grade point averages
below 1.5 and therefore are on
academic probation and can par-
ticipate in only one extracurricular
activity. Any freshman with ‘an
average below 1.9 is ineligible for in-
itiation into a fraternity.

“This was really the first year in
my memory in which there was a
significant difference between
fraternities and non-fraternities,”
said Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

University Registrar Harold S.

Head echoed that assessment. ‘‘This
is the first time that I remember non-
fraternity men being at the top”’ of
the academic rankings, he said.

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of
students for fraternity affairs, said
he was uncertain why fraternity
grades had fallen off so sharply in
relation to independents’ grades.

“I don’t know whether fraternities
are taking more time away from
their freshmen than usual,’’ Murphy
said, “‘but with the difference be-
tween non-fraternity and fraternity
grades, I would hope they would take
a greater interest in the academic
success of their freshmen.”

Murphy joined the other admin-
istrators in the observation that this
was the first year there has been
such a notable difference in the GPAs
of the two groups.

Interfraternity Council President
David L. Perdue, a senior and a
member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
said he was ‘‘shocked and disap-
pointed”’ by the decline in fraternity
performance.

“This is the first time I’ve seen this
change — usually non-fraternity men
are somewhere in the middle or
slightly above the average,” he said.

“T don’t think fraternities have
changed their pledging program ina
significant way that would have af-
fected freshman performance,’’ he
added.

“T don’t know if this is a one-time
occurrence — at this point, I think
there are too many other factors in-
volved than just the fraternities to
explain the change.”’

One factor noted by both Perdue
and administrators that may be hav-
ing an impact on freshman grades is
the new set of general education re-
quirements that went into effect this
fall.

The guidelines require students to
take mathematics, laboratory
science and foreign language
classes. Before this year, students
had a choice between math and
science, and English fulfilled the
language requirement.

Dean John said those requirements
may have led to the overall decline in
freshman academic performance,

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson agreed. ‘‘The

‘Scot free’: Mesner case dismissed

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

After 34% months in jail and 2%
days of trial, Scot Tanner Mesner
was free.

Surrounded by reporters in the en-
trance hall of the Rockbridge County
Courthouse, Mesner — who had been
charged with arson and murder in
connection with last spring’s frater-
nity house fire — lighted a cigarette
while he listened to the questions
fired at him.

What was your reaction to the out-
come?

“‘We pretty well proved that no one
could identify me.”

What about the testimony of Frank
Lane, a cellmate who said Mesner
confessed to the crime while being
held in the Rockbridge County Jail?

“T’m quite annoyed at him, but I’m
free so I’m not going to say anything
else about him.”’

What would have happened if the
case had gone to the jury?

“T would have had a chance. Not a
good one after him (Frank).”’ Then,
ignoring the blinding klieg light and
looking directly into a_ television
camera, Mesner added, ‘‘Have fun,
Frank.”

Less than five minutes earlier, Cir-
cuit Judge George E. Honts III had
announced his decision to dismiss the
charges against Mesner because his
due process of law may have been
violated.

Honts’ dismissal followed a two-
hour hearing on a request from
Mesner’s lawyers that the case be
dismissed because of what they call-
ed ‘‘prosecutorial misconduct.”

 

Honts said that in attempting to
place Mesner at the scene of the fire,
investigators used ‘a suggestive
technique” that resulted in ‘tainted
identifications.’’

In addition, Honts said, the defense
was not given the names of several
people who failed to identify Mesner
from a photographic lineup as having
been at the scene of the fire.

Mesner faced the arson and
murder charges in connection with
the April 11 fire that gutted the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house and
killed Washington and Lee soph-
omore Thomas J. Fellin, who was
asleep in the house.

Calling 14 witnesses to support his
case, Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read attempted
to prove that the fire was caused by
arson and that Mesner may have
held a grudge against Fellin and the
Phi Gamma Delta house.

In his opening statement, however,
Mesner’s attorney, Eric L. Sisler,
said he would call an arson in-
vestigator who would show that the
fire was not arson. He said the
defense also would attempt to show
that Mesner was asleep in his
parents’ home on the Hollins College
campus shortly after the fire.

After Read rested his case early
Dec. 21, the third day of the trial,
Mesner’s other attorney, G. Marshall
Mundy of Roanoke, requested the
dismissal. After hearing Mundy’s
evidence and deliberating in his
chambers for 45 minutes, Honts
agreed.

Mesner, 19, cannot be tried again
on the same charges because of 5th
Amendment protection from what is
known as double jeopardy.

During the hearing on Mundy’s re-
quest, two witnesses said that
although they originally had iden-
tified Mesner as being at the scene of
the fire, they no longer could do so.

Mundy charged that Read failed to
inform defense lawyers of these
witnesses’ changes, contrary to an
order issued by Honts Nov. 8. A third
witness during the hearing said he
was shown a photographic lineup but
could not identify Mesner. His name
was never given to the defense, Mun-
dy added.

In his Nov. 8 order, which followed
an evidence hearing, Honts ruled
that the prosecution must disclose
any information that could tend to ex-
onerate the defendant.

“Since identification is a key ele-
ment in this particular case,”
Honts’ order continued, ‘‘I direct that
the identity of any material
witness who failed to identify the
defendant in a photograph line-up be
made known to the defendant.”’

Warren Nowlin, a Richmond at-
torney who graduated from the W&L
Law School in May, said that during
the summer two investigators show-
ed him a series of photographs and
asked if he could identify any of them
as people he had seen at the fire.

graphs of the fire that had been in-
troduced into evidence by the pro-

The abrupt end to the Scot Mesner trial elicited reac-
tions ranging from disappointment that the cause of the
fraternity fire may never be known, torelief on the part
of at least one juror who was glad he didn’t have to
decide the case.

“The tragedy of what has occurred is that we may
never know what caused that fire,’’ Alumni Director
Richard B. Sessoms said of the blaze that killed Fellin
and gutted the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house, for
which Sessoms was faculty adviser.

A juror in the trial, Charles St. Clair of Glasgow, also
was disappointed that the trial ended early, but not
because he wanted to convict Mesner.

“From the evidence that I saw, there wouldn’t have
been enough to convict him,”’ St. Clair said.

He said he would have liked the trial to continue so the
defense could present its case and the jury could make
its decision, which he said probably would have been an
acquittal.

“At the point in time that [Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘“John’’ Read] said the prosecution rested, I
really didn’t need to see any defense,”’ St. Clair said.

“‘T had seen enough evidence to convince me that ar-
son had been committed, but not near enough evidence
to find Scot Mesner guilty.’’

However, he said, some other jurors were leaning
toward a guilty verdict. One of those was Crawford E.
Goodbar of Lexington.

“From what we heard of the prosecuting attorney's
case, I felt yes,”’ there was enough evidence to convict,
Goodbar said.

Fellin’s family and friends who attended the trial

‘20 to 30 pitchers of water’

The following chronology of events before, during and after the April 11,
1984, Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house fire is based on testimony at a Sept.
19 bond hearing for Scot Tanner Mesner and at Mesner’s trial, Dec. 19-21:

June 1983 — Mesner meets Lisa Ayers, a Botetourt County resident who
enrolled at Hollins College in the fall of 1983. The two begin dating and

Late August — Mesner leaves to attend school at Fairleigh-Dickinson
University in Teaneck, N.J.

Late October — Mesner sets several small dormitory fires at Fairleigh-
Dickinson. He later is convicted of criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, and
fined $1,000. Mesner returns to Hollins College to live with his parents on

November — One weekend, Mesner and Ayers are locked out of Ayers’
dormitory room by Ayers’ roommate, Mary Katherine Smith, and her
boyfriend, Thomas J. Fellin, a W&L sophomore. That same weekend, Ayers
said, Mesner and Fellin tease each other and have a small food fight with
cherry tomatoes. Mesner and Fellin ‘didn’t like each other very much,”

Dec. 31 — Mesner fails to show for a New Year’s Eve date with Ayers, who
described this as ‘‘the straw that broke the camel’s back” in their relation-
ship. She said Mesner had repeatedly broken dates and often was intox-

January 1984 — Ayers begins dating Michael Berg, a W&L student and

Smith talks with Mesner in the computer room at Hollins. ‘What Lisa had
done (by dating Mike Berg) had a very depressing effect’ on Mesner, said
Smith, who added that she tried to explain Lisa’s position and told Mesner
that things such as this happen frequently.

Late March or early April — During a telephone conversation, Mesner
tells Ayers, ‘If the Fiji house burns, you'll know who did it.’’ Ayers said the
two, who still were friends, had been talking about her relationship with
Berg and her trips to visit him at W&L.

April 10, 10 p.m.-midnight — Timothy S. White, a W&L student who

were reluctant to talk about the outcome this week.
Alex Castelli, Fellin’s roommate and co-president of the
fraternity, would not comment on the trial.

Thomas Fellin, the father of the victim, said from his
home in Pennsylvania, ‘‘The reaction I would have
right now would probably be vindictive and vengeful.”’

“Tl would like to take the opportunity to thank again
the people for their consideration, especially Dick
Sessoms, and most especially the men of Fiji,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘Their love and concern and consideration and
support will always be remembered.”

Fellin’s family stayed at a local hotel during the trial
as guests of the University.

Sessoms and St. Clair had some criticisms of the pro-
secution’s handling of the case, which ended when Cir-
cuit Judge George E. Honts III dismissed the charges
against Mesner because his right to due process of law
may have been violated.

“He [Read] pursued the thing with a great deal of
zeal, perhaps too much zeal, and perhaps that led to
some prosecutorial misconduct,’’ Sessoms said.

St. Clair’s criticism didn’t deal with the fact that the
case was thrown out, but that it was ever brought in.

“I don’t believe I would have taken him to trial with
the evidence [ Read] had,”’ St. Clair said.

Mesner, who could not be reached for comment this
week, has moved from his family’s home on the Hollins
College campus to an apartment in Roanoke, according
to a family member. His phone has not been connected
yet, the family member said

The only other person interviewed who was glad to
see the case end before it reached the jury was a juror
from Glasgow, Floyd W. Camden Jr., who didn’t relish
the thought of deciding Mesner’s fate.

“A man’s life is at stake and it’s a serious crime,”’
Camden said. ‘‘I was kind of relieved.”’
OPINION

Frats:
Is the party over?

This week’s lead story reports some rather alarming
figures about fraternity academics. The response to the story
by many fraternities likely will be one of extreme defen-
siveness.

We are not picking on fraternities. In recent months we
have frequently come to their defense when they’ve been
under fire from other quarters. Fraternities make a valuable
contribution to campus life, and W&L wouldn’t be W&L with-
out them.

It is because of that desire to preserve and protect the |

fraternity system that we find the statistics from fall term so
disturbing.

The restrictive social policies imposed on fraternities this
year are instructive. The administration had said for years
that if the fraternities didn’t clean up their acts, tougher
regulations would result. “Johnny, if you tear up the house
while momimy’s gone, I’m going to have to get you a babysit-
ter.” The Hill followed through on its repeated warnings by
clamping down on fraternity party schedules.

A similar crackdown will most certainly result if fraternity
academic performances continue to slide. A large number of
faculty members are lying in wait for an excuse to perma-
nently banish the fraternities. The fraternities’ argument
that they are constructive members of the community is
hardly strengthened when the faculty sees that some fresh-
men are performing so poorly that a significant block of
pledges isn’t even eligible to initiate.

Whether the correlation between fraternity membership
and academic performance is as strong as it appears is ir-
relevant. As in so many cases, the perception is what counts,
and the fraternities are going to suffer severely at the hands
of the Hill if there continues to be such an embarrassing dis-
crepancy between the grades of those who do and those who
do not belong to fraternities.

Houses have a number of options available to them. The
fraternities at many universities have mandatory study halls
for their freshmen, and those who can’t perform in the class-
room may not participate in house social functions. The
house GPA is a matter of pride; abysmal grades are not
tolerated.

Few W&L fraternities have any kind of study program-for ‘

their freshmen. We applaud the effort of several houses to
help their freshmen develop sensible study habits, and hope
that other fraternities will follow their lead in providing re-
quired study halls for those with academic difficulties.

Something we encourage all houses to develop is an acade-
mic big brother program. This requires only a minimal
amount of ofganization, and allows freshmen to benefit from
the expertise of their house’s upperclassmen. It makes a
fraternity more than just a place to guzzle grain.

Several houses encourage academic excellence by pro-
viding rewards for the pledges with the best and most im-
proved academic performances. It’s a simple gesture that
shows freshmen that academics are as important to the their
brothers as the quality of their beer slides.

The survival of the fraternity system depends on the
houses’ willingness to take responsible steps toward improv-
ing their image. At this point, the fraternities’ public rela-
tions problem is mammoth but not irredeemable. Swift ac-
tion is necessary to prevent their otherwise inevitable
demise.

During famine, death is not choosey

By DAVID LAMB
Los Angeles Times

 

(EDITORS' NOTE: The following is ex-
cerpted from a lengthy dispatch
published in the Los Angeles Times of
Dec. 30. Reprinted with permission of
the Los Angeles Times.)

ALAMATA, Ethiopia — ...A few
minutes before 7 a.m., Peter Jor-
dons, a Dutch doctor who has worked
with famine victims in Cambodia and
refugees in Tanzania, walked out of
the compound with an interpreter.
This was the triage, the grim daily
selection process of deciding who
could be saved and who could not.

“The bad thing,”’ he told an ac-
quaintance, “‘is that walking down
this line I have the feeling I am play-
ing God, and I don’t like that. I have a
ticket for food, for medicine, in my
hands. What if I make a mistake?
I’ve made them before. But we have
to make choices. Every morning is
the same.”

Jordons stopped before each of the
‘gaunt,-withered Ethiopians, check-
ing the fat on the childrens’ arms and
buttocks to determine their degree of
malnourishment. There was not a
sound and everyone remained
frozen, as motionless as statues.

“‘OK, boy,” he said to (25-year-old
Berhan) Nuguissie’s youngest son,
“‘you get a feeding ticket.’’ He moved
on down the line. ‘‘Sorry, boy, not for
you.”’ The youngster’s mother, sit-
ting on the ground, turned her face
upward toward the doctor’s and
reached out to tug at his trousers as
though to say, ‘Wait! You’ve made a
mistake.”’

Jordons bent down to an old, old
man and stroked his head affec-
tionately. ‘‘Ah, buba,”’ he said, ‘‘you
know I can’t. We’ve got too many
children to help first. Sorry, I am so
sorry.”’ The old man understood. He
struggled to his feet and moved away
ae accepting his fate without a
wi :

Across the dirt courtyard, near the
caldron, was a cluster of bamboo and
tin sheds. They were stuffy and full of
soft whimpers, and walking into

them from the bright sunshine out-
side, one’s eyes needed time to adjust
to the dim light and the sight of
several dozen skeleton-like children,
guarded by their mothers.

“I don’t even count calories when
we're doing super-intensive feed-
ing,”’ Jordons said. ‘I just want to
get food into them any way we can,
by spoon, nasal tube, mother’s milk.

“The children in here don’t have
any resistance left to fight off
sickness, and we’ve got pneumonia,
cholera, dysentary. We've just
discovered two cases of meningitis.
I've got two kids dying right over
there and there is not a thing I can
do.”’

For these children, hunger and the
desire for food have passed. Their
bodies have converted first the fat
and then the muscles into energy.
The enzymes — the chemicals that
make the digestive system work —
have disappeared. And when there is
nothing left to transform into energy,
the child becomes listless, dull-eyed
and, reduced in appearance to
something that does not look human,
finally starving to déatti quietly and
painlessly. :

Aread Kadre, a nomad from
Mehoni village, 35 miles away, un-
derstood what was happening to her
children without understanding the
process itself. She lay in a corner of
the shed, two emaciated 4-month-old
twins at her side, and put her head in
the cradle of her arm. Her body
shook with tears...

The first of Aread Kadre’s twin
boys, Mustafa, died at 3 o’clock ona
Thursday and was buried in the long
shadows of the afternoon. A final
dose of penicillin had failed to save
him and doctors listed the cause of
death as meningitis complicated by
malnourishment. At 4 months old, he
weighed two pounds.

The nomad woman hovered over
the torn sheet that covered the child
and cried loudly outside the shed. A
group of older boys playing nearby
seemed not to notice. ‘‘It happens all
the time,”’ explained 14-year-old Zen-
abu Godfaye as the burial detail --two

old men paid extra food rations, not
money -- arrived and lifted the wast-
ed body ona stretcher.

They carried it through the com-
pound, down a path that bends
around a clump of acacia trees and
into a rocky field just below the hill-
top church. There are in that field
hundreds of earthen mounds, each
covered with a few stones, that bear
witness to the human devestation of
the famine.

The earth is very hard and full of
roots, and it took the men about 30

minutes of strenuous effort to chisel
out another grave with a crowbar. ,
Mustafa Kadre, a Muslim, was plac-
edinit.... ’
Mustafa Kadre’s mother did not .
come to the burial. She returned to
the shed to hold her surviving twin '
for a while. :
Then, when darkness settled in, she
left the compound alone and walked «
blindly off toward the mountains, .
where one of the wailing voices that
would come up with the next day’s °
dawn would almost certainly be hers. ,

To gaze into a flame is to know

creative beauty and destructive
genius.  _

From such gazings have sprung
the flawless notes of the laser disc,
the threat of armageddon and ways
to break the ABM treaty. Even the
Bill of Rights, wrought in a time of
flame, took some flickers from the
rhythm of pefiodic gazings as its
authors suspended their quills, un-
sure how to explain the rights of man
away to future generations.

We now live under Reagan in 1985,
and we are uncertain how our rights
are protected, indeed unsure which
are rights anid which privileges. The
old-fashioned ideas of right-and-
wrong, guilt-and-innocence, have
been diffused through the rules of
evidence and the several states. In
New York City, a man is rich with
legal aid he will not accept and moral
support he has not earned because he
learned to use‘a firearm ona subway.
He was mugged four years earlier
and chos@"to beteme an animal in a
jungle. He will be tried by his peers,
weare told.

Bernhard Hugo Goetz took up a gun
while s0 many equally vulnerable
passengers on the urine-and graffiti-

ed, two car speakers stolen, a crusty
Band-Aid and a hispanic newspaper.
We had been away from the car for
less than two hours.

These three incidents were minor
and go unsolved and unreported. Of
the three men who attacked Goetz
several years ago, one did four
months jail time under a plea
bargain. Goetz was not granted a gun
permit, and will face an_ illegal
possession charge in addition to at-
tempted murder in the shooting of
four youths last month. Three of the
four would-be muggers on the same
line where Goetz was mugged before
carried sharpened screwdrivers,
Two were shot as they turned their
backs to flee the gunman. One lies
paralyzed from the waist down. That
Goetz fled to New Hampshire before
turning himself in speaks of remorse
more than heroism.

As New York City Police Commis-
sioner Benjamin Ward noted Friday,
“I cannot imagine any circum-
stances under which a person would
pull out a gun on a typical New York
City subway and fire five rounds. I
could not glorify that person and

make him into a vigilante.

“T have a little different definition
of a vigilante,’’ the commissioner ex-
plained. ‘‘I think those fellows wear-
ing those pointy white hats and white
sheets call themselves vigilantes,
too.”

..and the Iranian students, John
Hinckley, the terrorists bombing
NATO homes, schools and installa-
tions in West Germany...those bomb-
ing abortion clinics in this country.

All these might be seen in mirrors
as rebels against failings of our
criminal justice system. The fed-up
citizen taking the law and molten
lead into his trembling hand is idoliz-
ed across our society in books, plays,
movies, news accounts, radio broad-

casts.

We recall the ‘‘Death Wish” scene
of Charles Bronson assuming the role
Goetz chose. We think of ‘Taxi
Driver’’ and Clint Eastwood’s box of-
fice winners in the “Dirty Harry”’
series. The latest installment of
revenge glorified, ‘‘Sudden Impact,”
is doing nicely. Chuck Norris bulges
from the poster on Main Street for
“Missing in Action,” boldly toting a
piece of small artillery under the
phrase, ‘‘The war’s not over until the
last man comes home...Vietnam

1984."
But when we laud vengeance, are

we not itching wounds we might seek
to heal and salve?

There is hope for still more of the
victim agencies such as Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, Parents of
Murdered Children, Victims for Vic-
tims and the National Association for
Crime Victims’ Rights. These groups
muuvale funds and famiues to

te oa

legislate stiffer penalties under the
legal system and to help victims
spiritually and materially. Hope
darkens under the lengthening
shadow of the National Rifle Associa-
tion.

The Supreme Court, presumed
destined to fill up to three seats with
conservative minds in the balance of
the Reagan term, ruled three times
for broader police arrest, search and
seizure powers in their last session.
Some law-gazers see a swing in ad-
judicatior back from the rights of the
accusea {9 the rights of the officer
and the victim.

It aches and tears at our flesh,
meanwhile, to be optimistic when an
untarnished ideal, a human flame, is
suffocated as quickly as a spark in
the night. We first seek to rekindle
the fire and then to break the hand
that doused its progress. The first is
easy, but the second has proved ex-
cruciating.

But it is a far better pain than G.
Gordon Liddy’s if we can stay our
hands above vengeance. Fury trans-
formed to healing is invincible; fury
unleashed reprehensible.

We can establish scholarships,
name’ athletic awards, and care for
the Fellin and Fiji families. We can
vote for these values, for mental
health and criminal institutions that
don’t infect wounds of the past but
cleanse and bandage.

This path is rough and less travel-
led and extends beyond our lifetimes,
as we burn for the balance vengeance
seems to bring. But retribution
spawns only vengeance upon venge-
ance upon death upon decay. We can

see this in Lebanon, or Central
America, or Ireland.

Society decays fastest when the
law is meted out by the individual
— remember the ‘“‘Road Warrior”’
— and we return to the dirt and blood
of the wasteland.

Remember that Goetz and others
accused were victims first.

Most painful and most noble is to
visualize even the most vicious felon
we would destroy staring blankly
back at our rage, grinning insanely
nerhaps and saving. ‘Go ahead,

punk, make my day.” Most of us, +
when cornered, can fight like dogs to
defend our lives. Until then, we’
should grasp the torch we take as a «

secttion, said he could not identify
anyone as being at the fire. Mesner’s
picture was among those he was
shown.

“What I wonder, and will always
wonder,” Mundy said, ‘‘is just how
many witnesses there are out there
who were shown these photographs
and couldn’t identify the defendant.”

Honts said he was concerned not
only with the failure of Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.

 

“John” Read to turn over Nowlin’s
and others’ names to the defendant
but also with the ‘‘tainted’”’ procedure
through which Mesner was identified
by several witnesses from photo-
graphic lineups.

Two witnesses had testified earlier
in the trial that they saw Mesner at
the fire.

Gerald Simpson, a special agent of
the Virginia State Police, had
testified under cross-examination
that he showed several witnesses on-
ly pictures of Mesner, rather than a
picture of Mesner among pictures of
other people, in an effort to deter-

mine if they could identify Mesner as
being at the fire scene.

“I am concerned about the tainting
of identification,’’ Honts said in
dismissing the case.

The presence of witnesses whose
names were not revealed to the
defendant, Honts told reporters,
“coupled with direct evidence that,
in fact, two (witnesses’ identifica-
tions) were tainted and others may
have been,”’ resulted in his decision
that Mesner’s due process may have
been violated.

Mesner, who had been in the
Rockbridge County Jail since his

Sept. 4 indictment on the charges,
said he plans to enroll at Virginia
Western Community College.

Jean Dunbar, an assistant pro-
fessor of English at W&L, and her
husband, Peter Sils, originally iden-
tified Mesner in a_ photographic
lineup that consisted of two photos of
Mesner and a composite drawing of
another person, they said.

Dunbar, however, could not iden-
tify Mesner in a police lineup two
days before the trial. Although Sils
could, he told Read that after seeing
Mesner moving around in the court-

room during the trial he could not

Midnight — The six return to the Fiji house with a case of beer, which they
leave outside to keep cool. Using pieces of old furniture from the basement,
they build a fire in the fireplace of the poolroom and are playing pool

April 11, 12:30 a.m. — Fellin, a baseball player, returns to the Fiji house
from an away baseball game. The others ask if he would like to join them,
but he goes to bed instead.

1:30 a.m, — Smoke from the fire in the poolroom causes the fire alarm in
the hallway outside the poolroom to go off. Jim Forte, a law student living in
the adjacent cottage, comes over to see what is happening. White described
Forte, who had been trying to study, as angry. White tells the other five to
leave, and after a brief discussion with Forte, says he ‘‘would take care of
the fire.”’

2 a.m. — Forte goes back to his cottage.

2:25 or 2:30 a.m. — After using 20 to 30 pitchers of water and a fire ex-

_ tinguisher to put out the fire and stirring the ashes with a pool cue, White
leaves the Fiji house.

2:39 a.m. — In separate cars, Lexington Police officers Richard Rice and

_ E. Funkhouser drive by the Fiji house, but neither reported seeing anything
unusual.

2:56 a.m. — The two again drive by the house, and again, they reported
seeing nothing.

’ in flames. The flames were far beyond the roof.”

4:48 a.m, — Funkhouser arrives at the house. He attempts to enter the

house through the pantry door, the front door and the side door but is re-
* pulsed by smoke and flames each time.

About 5 a.m. — The first firefighters arrive on the scene.

Shortly after 5 a.m. — Two firefighters, David Stevens Jr. and Trent
Roberts, enter the house from the side door to conduct a search and rescue.
Stevens finds Fellin on a staircase about six feet from the door. Fellin’s head
is on the second step with his feet pointing up the stairs. Stevens drags Fellin

into the yard.
5:30 - 6 a.m. — Marian Blain, awakened by the fire trucks, walks toward
the Fiji house. On her way, she stops to ask a young man with a bicycle if
* anyone was in the house. Returning home a few minutes later, she passes the
_ young man again and this time gets a full view of his face, which she said had

“an agonized and haggard look.’’ In court, she identified this person as
’ Mesner.

7 or 7:15 a.m, — Mesner’s stepmother checks on him in bed at his home on
the Hollins College campus, according to his lawyer’s opening statement.

About 8 a.m. — While taking a break on the back of a rescue squad truck,
Stevens sees an individual at the corner of Preston and Lee streets whom he
identified as Mesner.

About 3 p.m. — The last fire units leave the Fiji house. Bill Weems, direc-
tor of utilities processing for the city, estimated that 190,000 gallons of water
were used to fight the fire, the most he’d seen in 714 years in Lexington.

Later in the day — Lexington Fire Chief Keith Irvine’s report on the fire is
filed. It reads, ‘‘The fire was coming through the roof upon arrival. The
southeast half of the house was fully engulfed.”

8:30 or 9 p.m. — Mesner goes to Ayers and Smith’s room in Tinker Dor-
mitory at Hollins, Ayers is out of the room, but Mesner has the following con-
versation with Smith, who is packing to go to Fellin’s funeral in Penn-
sylvania:

Mesner: ‘‘Was there a fire last night at Washington and Lee?”’

Smith: “Yes.”’

Mesner: ‘‘Was it at Phi Gamma Delta?”’

Smith: “Yes. Tom was in the house.”’

Mesner: “I have alibis. What I said a few weeks ago, I was only joking.”

April 12 — In a statement to Lexington police, Ayers details Mesner’s com-
ment that “‘if the Fiji house burns, you'll know who did it.”

April 13 — Special Agent Gerald Simpson of the. Virginia State Police
begins his investigation of the fire. Simpson testified that the fire was arson.

April 16 — Jerry Byers, a private investigator hired by an insurance firm,
begins his investigation of the fire. Byers also testified that the fire was caus-
ed by arson.

May 14 — Following a meeting among Simpson, Sutton, Irvine, Straub and
Byers, a press conference is held to announce that investigators believe the
fire was caused by arson.

July — In a meeting at the fire station of about 25 firefighters, only one,
Stevens, can identify Mesner from a photographic lineup as a person he saw
at the fire.

Sept. 4 — Scot Mesner is indicted on charges of arson and murder in con-
nection with the fire. He is arrested and held in Rockbridge County Jail
under $150,000 bond.

Sept. 19 — Rockbridge County Circuit Judge George E. Honts III denies a
request to reduce Mesner’s bail.

Dec. 3 — During a chess game, Frank Lane, a cellmate of Mesner in jail
awaiting trial on charges of burglary and grand larceny, and Mesner talk
about why they are in jail. Mesner tells Lane he intended to burn down the
Fiji house and had no remorse for having done it, according to Lane. During
cross-examination, Lane, 21, acknowledged that he had two previous convic-
tions.

Dec. 19 — Mesner pleads not guilty to the charges of arson and murder and
his trial begins with selection of a jury.

Dec. 21 — Following three days of testimony in Mesner’s trial, Honts
dismisses the case because Mesner’s due process may have been violated.

identify Mesner as having been at the
fire.

Dunbar telephoned Mundy the
night before the final day of the trial
to tell him that she could not identify
Mesner.

Dunbar, who gave a precise
description of the person she saw at
the fire and originally thought was
Mesner, said Read had referred to
her and Sils as ‘‘star witnesses.”
After reviewing a Calyx and seeing
Mesner in the courtroom, however,
she and her husband independently
had concluded that the person they’d
seen at the fire could be any one of a
number of W&L students.

“T really felt that I had no idea
whether Mr. Mesner did or did not set
the fire,’’ she testified. ‘‘But my feel-
ing was that unless I did something to
indicate that I could not identify him,
no matter which way the trial went, it
would not be an accurate trial.’’

Read used much of his 2% days of
testimony attempting to show that
the fire was arson. Both Simpson and
Jerry Byers, a private arson in-
vestigator hired by an insurance
company, testified that their in-
vestigations showed the fire was
caused by arson.

The two said they based their con-
clusions on the fact that the fire ap-

The Scot Mesner trial once
again focused attention on Bever-
ly C. “John” Read, the Com-
monwealth’s Attorney for Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County
who seems to attract controversy
like a magnet.

Defense attorneys in the case
charged him with ‘‘prosecutorial
misconduct,’’ noting that he had
flouted an order by the judge to
release the names of any people
who failed to identify Mesner in
photographic lineups.

In dismissing the case, Circuit
Judge George E. Honts III said he
was concerned that Mesner’s
right to due process may have
been violated, but emphasized
that Read was not solely responsi-
ble for the improprieties.

“T don’t lie this at anyhbody’s

peared to have started in several dif-
ferent places and that some burn
marks were consistent with those
where a flammable liquid may have
been poured.

However, of the more than 20
samples of debris submitted to state
laboratories, only one was shown to
contain gasoline.

Mesner’s attorneys maintained
that the fire was caused by a fire
started by several W&L students in
the fireplace of the fraternity house’s
poolroom.

“It was an accident, pure and sim-
ple, a negligent accident caused by
that bonfire they built in that
poolroom in a 91-year-old tinderbox
house,” Sisler said in his opening
statement.

After investigators heard of
Mesner’s statement to his ex-girl-
friend that ‘‘if the Fiji house ever
burns, you’ll know who did it,”’ they
began ‘‘a wild scramble to try to put
a square peg in a round hole,” Sisler
added.

The seven-man, five-woman jury,
which never deliberated the case,
was selected after four hours of ques-
tioning by Honts and attorneys about
what they had read or heard about
the case in the media or from ac-
quaintances.

feet because I think it’s a culmina-
tion of a whole lot of things,”
Honts told reporters. ‘I think it
would be erroneous to lay it at the
prosecutor’s feet.’’

Read said after the trial that
‘no one intended to do anything
wrong.”

Honts said this was the only
criminal case he has dismissed
during his 18 months as a trial
judge, and defense attorney G.
Marshall Mundy said this was the
first time he has raised the issue
of prosecutorial misconduct in 22
years as a criminal lawyer.

“I’m sitting up here as a
referee, in a sense, and everybody
plays by the rules,’’ Honts said.
“If someone doesn’t, then a foul’s

 

occurred.”’

Wreck kills

man today

near Keydet General

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

A young Rockbridge County man
was killed early this morning when
his car ran off U.S. 60 west of town,
crashed into the side of a house and
burst into flames.

State police had not released the
victim’s name by late this morning.

Charles L. Cox, 24, a teacher at
Natural Bridge High School, was
asleep in the house, across the high-
way from the Keydet General Motel.

He escaped unharmed from his base-

ment bedroom.

The accident occurred at about
1:30 a.m. and firefighters were on the
scene until after 4:00 a.m. More than
a dozen emergency vehicles lined
U.S. 60. The “‘jaws of life’ became
the ‘‘jaws of death”’ as rescuers used
that gasoline-powered tool to remove
the body from the mangled, smolder-
ing car.

The green Pontiac appeared to
have skidded more than 150 feet after
running off the road just past the
Shell gasoline station. The steep em-
bankment is covered with grass and
leaves.

First-year Washington and Lee law
student R. Mark Thornhill, who was
returning to his Rockbridge County
home after spending the evening at
the Cockpit, said the car passed him
just prior to the accident.

‘T was doing 60 and he passed me
like I wasn’t even moving,”’ Thornhill
said as he watched firefighters douse
the blaze. “I saw his lights disap-
pear. When he passed me, I knew he
was going to wreck. I knew he’d go
off the road, he was going so fast.”

Thornhill said the car did not ex-
plode immediately. He walked up to
the car just before the underside of
the car ignited. He said the victim ap-
peared to be dead before the fire
started.

Lexington Assistant Fire Chief
Bryan Causey said a broken natural
gas line fueled the fire. ‘‘The top of
the gas meter was ruptured by the
impact of the car,’’ he said. “A spark
from the car or anything could have
ignited it.”’

Causey said 25 Lexington and 15-20
Kerrs Creek firefighters battled the
blaze. In addition, numerous rescue
squad workers were on the scene. All
are volunteers.

Cox said that because he sleeps on
a waterbed, he was not awakened by
the impact of the car striking the
house. He said he heard some noise
and was just starting to doze off
again when Thornhill began pound-
ing on the front door.

When the car began burning, the
front corner of the house where the
vehicle had lodged became engulfed
in flame, destroying the walls and
heavily damaging the kitchen.

Cox said the owner of the house,
Marshall Irvine, is in Colorado on a
Christmas visit to one of his children.

As he watched the rescue opera-
tion, Cox noted that he is a driver
education teacher. ‘Kind of ironic,
huh?”’ he said. ‘‘I always have been
able to”’ tell students what not to do,
“‘but now I guess I have a little more
basis, don’tI?”’

He said he planned to teach this
morning. ‘‘I'd rather be busy. I don’t
think I'll sleep tonight.”’

“It didn’t have to happen,”’ Thorn-
hill said.

Col. Head plans retirement
after 19 years as registrar

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

After 19° years as University
registrar, Col. Harold S. Head has
announced that he will step down
from the position, effective Aug. 31.

Head said he was retiring because
he had ‘“‘always planned to retire
when I turned 65.”

A small search committee, under
the direction of Dean of the College
John W. Elrod, will be set up to take
applications for the position.

“Col. Head has ably and devotedly
served Washington and Lee for 19
years,’ Elrod said. ‘‘His gentleman-
ly manner in the daily performance
of his duties will be greatly missed.’’

Head is a graduate of the United
States Military Academy and served
in both World War II and Korea. In
addition, he graduated from the In-

fantry School at Ft. Benning, Ga.,
and the Command and General Staff
College at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan.

Head holds a master’s degree in
history from Harvard University and
is a graduate of the Army Language
School, where his studies in Japanese
prepared him for duty as staff officer
to the Military Assistance Advisory
Group in Japan from 1959 to 1967.

Before taking his post at W&L, he
joined the military staff at VMI in
1962. He also is a past president of the
Virginia Association of Collegiate
Registrars and Admissions.

Head said he has seen a great
many changes during his 19-year
tenure at the University. For in-
stance, when he first began working
for W&L, the University was on a
three-point grading scale in which an
F resulted in ‘‘minus points.” In ad-
dition, the registrar’s office was in
charge of class attendance. Dean’s
List students were awarded cutting
privileges at holidays, while the rest
of the student body had to contend
with subtracted points for numerous
absences.

Head said the responsibilities of
the registrar’s office are so
numerous that it is easiest just to
say: “Once a student is accepted to
the University and has paid his
enrollment, he is passed over to us
and he is our responsibility. If you
have a question and don’t know who
to ask, then come here.”’

Scheduled to retire just days before
the coeds arrive to bring a new era to
W&L, Head has mixed feelings about
the coeducation decision, which he
said was inevitable.

“I’ve always felt that there was a
need for a top-rate all men’s school
for those who want to go that route,
and I’m sorry to see that end. How-
ever, I think the GPA will go up with
the women here.”’

Early Decision
acceptances
hit new high

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee has accepted
110 students — including 39 women
— for admission next fall, the largest
number of early decision accep-
tances in the school’s history, accord-
ing to Admissions Counselor Bennett
Ross.

The early decision applications in-
cluded 56 from women and 154 from
men, compared with 90 applications
(all men) last year, Ross said. Of
those 90 applications, 54 students
were accepted.

“This is an excellent first group
and is only a sign of better things to
come,’’ Ross said. He pointed out
some “impressive’’ increases in
statistics from this year’s early deci-
sion group, as compared with last
year’s:

eLast year, 47 percent of the early
decision clase graduated in the top
fifth of their high school class ; 59 per-

cent of this year’s class graduated in
the top fifth.

eLast year’s median SAT scores
were 548 verbal and 583 math. This
year’s class has median SAT scores
of 564 verbal and 593 math, a total in-
crease of 26 points.

eLast year’s median English
Achievement score was 510 and this
year’s median score was 550.

eThis year’s class includes nine
student body presidents, five student
body vice presidents, eight class of-
ficers, 18 athletic team captains, nine
editors of school publications and 41
National Honor Society members.

Ross pointed out that these median
statistics for the early decision class
are usually lower than the median
statistics for the class as a whole.

Ross added that the University has
received 1,109 applications, com-
pared with 705 received by this time
last year. He also said that competi-
tion will be tough to fill the remaining
280 to 300 spots with almost 28 per-
cent of the class already chosen.

Hearing delayed on rezoning for dorm

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

The public hearing on a request by
Washington and Lee for zoning
changes that would allow construc-
tion of a new dormitory has been
postponed until Jan. 24.

The hearing was moved from Dec.
20 to comply with a state law requir-
ing the city to advertise the public
meeting in local newspapers for
three consecutive weeks, according
to Lexington Planning Commission

Chairman Henry L. Ravenhorst.

The school has asked that the area
bounded by Nelson, Lee and
Washington streets be rezoned from
its general residential classification.
The proposed dormitory would house
240 students and would be completed
by September 1987.

Ravenhorst said the commission
also wanted time to discuss the
various ways the area could be rezon-
ed to allow W&L to build the dor-
mitory.

The commission determined that

Ex-President Huntley
convocation speaker

Robert E.R. Huntley, president of
the Richmond-based Best Products
Co. Inc. and former president of
Washington and Lee, will be the
featured speaker of W&L’s 114th an-
nual Founders’ Day Convocation on
Monday, Jan. 21.

The convocation will begin at 12:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel. Huntley’s ad-
dress is titled ‘‘The Way We Were.”

Founders’ Day at W&L was first
observed in 1871 and is held annually
on or near the Jan. 19 birthdate of
Gen. Robert E. Lee, who was presi-
dent of the University from 1865 until
his death in 1870.

In addition to Huntley’s address,
student leaders from all areas of the
University’s campus life will be
recognized during the convocation,
and induction ceremonies will be

held for Omicron Delta Kappa, the
national honor society recognizing
outstanding leadership.

A number of W&L students as well
as prominent alumni and friends of
the University will be inducted into
ODK, which was founded at Wash-
ington and Lee in 1914 and now has
chapters on campuses throughout the
country.

Huntley served as president of
Washington and Lee from 1968 until
1983, when he stepped down to return
to teaching in the W&L School of
Law.

In December of 1983 he was named
executive vice president of Best Pro-
ducts, the nation’s biggest catalog-
showroom retailer. In June 1984 he
was named president of the com-

pany.

one proposed option that would hav.
made the area a central business
district was inappropriate because it
would not allow the University suf-
ficient ‘freedom of design,’’ Raven-
horst explained.

Lexington Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Donald J. Mette said the
commission could allow W&L to con-
struct the dormitory by either rezon-
ing the area to allow multi-family
housing or by inventing a new type of
zoning district.

Mette explained that this new zone
would be an “‘institutional’’ zone that
would give the University a ‘“‘bit
more liberal’ guidelines for the type
of construction it could engage in on
its own land.

At the public hearing, the commis-
sion will give adjacent property
owners and other interested narties
the opportunity to speak for or
against the proposal. After the public
hearing, the commission will decide
whether to rezone the area and make
a recommendation to City Council,
which must make the final decision,
Ravenhorst noted.

“The planning commission is pure-
ly advisory. We try to make decisions
based on the welfare of the communi-
ty and the future development of the
community,’’ Ravenhorst added.

He said he is uncertain whether
W&L’s request will routinely be ap-
proved or will meet opposition from
the community.

Washington and Lee students in-

Revisions Committee should contact
the Executive Committee within two
weeks, President Cole Dawson an-
nounced at the EC’s first formal
meeting of 1985.

Names must be submitted to the
EC by Monday, Jan. 21. The commit-
tee will be selected that week and ap-
pointed Jan. 28, Dawson explained
after the meeting. The committee
will ‘“‘go through every page of the

White Book” and make recommen-
dations to the EC.

Dawson said the EC would take
these recommendations into account
when voting on White Book changes
later this year. Revisions approved
by the EC will be posted around cam-
pus for one week and must be approv-
ed by the EC a second time before be-

Neither Mears nor Walker could be
reached for comment, but the police
report placed the value of Walker’s

suspects have been found in connec-
tion with the two robberies.

In another theft involving W&L
students, a farmhouse rented by five
students was robbed.

Edward L. Mohler Jr. of Lex-
ington, the son of the students’
landlady, has been arrested in con-
nection with the break-in. Among the
items taken were two stereo re-
ceivers, two tape decks, one turn-

house will be rebuilt to keep much of
its original character,

going to fool anybody with my expertise on the subject — my bowl
predictions have been declared a national disaster area by those who
do such things — but I do think I have something worthy (Read: it fills
the space) to say about that confounded notion of a subjective best
team in the nation.

Simply put, without a playoff there can be no such thing as a No. 1
team. Unfortunately, since the powers that be (AP, UPI, CNN, USA
Today, Joe’s Bar and Grill, etc., ad infinitum) get a quasi-orgasmic
thrill from telling us how much they know about what’s what, we’re
faced with the pointless arguments after the bowl games.

And this year, it’s the BYWho? controversy. It’s been so important
(overblown) this season that ABC even had a nationwide phone-in poll
to see what America thought about a team being No. 1 that bested
(outscored) such perennial powerhouses as Utah State, Utah, Wyom-
ing and non-conference toughie (sorry, Lou Holtz) Minnesota.
Granted, the Cougars can’t be faulted for a schedule made years ago,
but then again schedule must be a point of consideration when you go
telling the world what’s what in college football.

Cagers fly by Eagles,

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team produced its highest point
total of the season in defeating the

Bridgewater Eagles 83-59 last night

Jeff Harralson contributed 14 points
each.

Guards Wilkinson, McClatchy,
Mike Hudson and Lex Fitzenhagen
helped replace the loss of one of the
team’s leading scorers, Bill Yates,
who has left the University for
academic reasons.

But head coach Verne Canfield
said that his guards’ performances
last night were nosurprise tohim.

“I expected them to fill in (for
Yates) and then some. I am totally
confident in all six of our guards,”
said Canfield. He added, ‘‘It’s not a
surprise. It’s expected.”

Although they won by a large
margin, the Generals trailed
Bridgewater early in the game. The
Eagles jumped to an early 4-0 lead,
but Wilkinson kept the Generals close
by hitting five of his first six shots
from the field. At the 10 minute mark
in the first half, W&L trailed, 19-18.

ing but it also led to some scores for
the Generals.

With 7:04 remaining in the first
half, the Generals began to pull away
from the Eagles, when McClatchy
stole the ball and fed Hudson, who
scored on the fast break despite be-
ing fouled on the shot. Hudson com-
pleted the three-point-play and gave
the Generals a 25-19 lead. W&L con-
tinued the half-ending barrage with a
14-4 run to take a 39-23 lead into the
locker room at the intermission.

Hoping to apply more defensive
pressure on the Generals, Bridge-
water opened the second half with a

full-court press. Although the
Generals did not score their first
basket of the second half for two-and-
a-half minutes, the Eagles’ press was
ineffective at stopping the Generals
or cutting into their lead as the

Generals were able to up their
halftime margin to 21 points at the
11:29 mark, 55-34

The Generals’ large lead allowed
Canfield to play many players off the
bench during the second half.

cee Just some quick thoughts on the Generals hoopsters as they head
into the new year and the meat of their ODAC schedule: This team is
for the most part as fundamentally sound as any team it plays, but
losses for the most part seem to be the result of being one step short of
the finished product. As an example, in Friday’s contest in Penn-
sylvania, the Generals were able to run the offense fairly well, but
couldn’t put the ball in the hole. The loss of Bill Yates (left the Univer-
sity for academic’ reasons) may hurt the team, but certainly it is
something thatcan be overcome. It appears then that this season is
again a case of the team’s ability to reach its potential...

...[t’s January, and therefore we are allowed to talk about basket-
ball. First, in college Georgetown is good, but Al McGuire is right: the
Hoyas will lose two or three before tournament time. The same is true
of Duke. The reason: conference play is more brutal than I can ever
remember it being. Best conference in the nation: toss-up be-
tween Big East and Big 10...In the pro game, it’s going to be a shame
that the Sixers and Celts won’t be able to meet in the finals...

....Finally, here’s an update on the ongoing poor officiating disease
currently afflicting the world of sports: Three Big Eight officials have
been suspended (hear,hear) for overwhistling, calling 49 (!) fouls in
one game last month....

 

 

since the Virginia Intercollegiate
Championships, on Dec. 1-2.

Although the team has not com-
peted in more than a month, the
members have been training hard.
They returned to Washington and
Lee on Dec. 26 and began work. While
most people were sleeping late, the
swim team was weightlifting at 8
a.m., then swimming until noon,
resting and then going back to the
pool from 4 until after 6 p.m.

“It was a good training camp,”
Coach Page Remillard said. ‘Be-
cause of finals and a week at home

the team lost some of their condition-

ing from before finals, but they
Worked hard every day and regained
what was lost.”

When Coach Remillard said they
worked every day he wasn’t kidding
— the team was even in the pool on
New Year’s Day.

One addition to the team is all-
American Tabor Smith who hadn’t
swum this year because of mono-
nucleosis. Smith said he is looking
forward to swimming in two or three
events this week.

“T feel good, I missed swimming
against Hopkins,” Smith said. “My
speed is not as good as it could be but
I’m at the same point as I was last
year this time.”’

team a new way to judge itself. The
times from before Christmas vaca-
tion can’t be used for comparison
because the team has not been in a
competitive situation in more than a
month. As Coach Remillard likes to
say, “It becomes a science, this week
will give us new data to work with.”’

“The team will have to dig deep
and can’t afford to have a subpar day
in order to win,” he added.

The coach was happy to say that
the program has been a success in
more than one way this season; the
team is undefeated with a 2-0 dual-
meet record and most of all the team
is doing well in classes, too with three
swimmers on the Dean’s List and
five on the Honor Roll.

‘‘We’re not happy if our academics
are not as good as our athletics in this
program.” Remillard said.

Cooler weather: It’s all downhil

 

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

Because of an unusally warm
December throughout much of the
state, the ‘‘Big Three’”’ ski resorts in
Virginia are looking to January and
February in hopes that a profitable
ski season can be salvaged.

Richard Cote, director of promo-
tions at Massanutten Ski Resort, said
business has been “really slow’’ but
that their slopes should be open to the
mid-station by today. He added that
he hopes the entire slopes will be
open by this weekend.

Massanutten features night skiing
every day from 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
and is open for day skiing from 9 a.m.
to4:30p.m.

The slopes at Wintergreen are open
for the third time this year after a
series of shutdowns brought on by
higher temperatures.

Ski Secretary Elizabeth Patterson
said the resort is offering free lessons
to those novice skiers who rent equip-
ment from the resort, and a new
physical fitness facility — the Winter
Garden — has also been added to
make Wintergreen even more allur-
ing. The Wintergreen village has ad-
ded a new expert slope, Logger’s
Alley, and a network of triple ski lift
lines to reduce the wait for skiers.

Night skiing is offered by the resort
on five of its 11 slopes. Patterson said
three slopes — a beginner, a novice
and an expert — are expected to be
available this weekend in addition to

The Student Activities Board has
booked George Thorogood and the
Delaware Destroyers for Saturday,
Jan. 19, beginning ‘‘a more or less
weekly”’ series of social events in the
student activities pavilion, according
to SAB Entertainment Director John
Haywood.

“One of the benefits we saw in
building the pavilion was that we
could have bigger bands than before
and offer more social events for the
student body as a whole,” Haywood
said. ‘I think we’re off to a good
start.”’

Haywood said that both the Thoro-
good show, which will be opened by
W&L party veterans, The Skip Castro
Band, and a concert the following

the restaurants and shops within the
Wintergreen ski community.

Sepp Kober, ski area manager for
the Homestead in Hot Springs said
that ‘‘so far this year, no ski resorts
on the East Coast have done much.”’
He added that the Homestead pilan-
ned to open its slopes by last night
with the help of the recent cold fronts
that have made snow production
possible.

Kober, who has worked with the
W&L physical education department
ski classes, said the Homestead has
nonight skiing.

Located on the second highest
mountain in West Virginia, the
Snowshoe ski village has faced few
problems, especially since the latest
cold wave has resulted in the ‘‘dump-
ing of snow’’ upon the resort. Public
relations spokesman Raymond
Houck said January and February
skiing is limited to those people who
are staying at Snowshoe, but lodging
charges cover the cost of skiing.

“There is a ‘Fun Pass’ that is given
to lodgers which enables them to use
any and all of our facilities.’’ Houck
added that Snowshoe, which has 34
slopes, is a community that features
gas stations, grocery stores, a
bakery and “‘even a pizza place that
delivers.”

Houck explained that no night ski-
ing is offered at the resort because
“slope grooming”’ is performed dur-
ing that time and because tempera-
tures on the 4,848-foot mountain can
drop to dangerously low levels at
night.

rock Pavilion

Friday night with the Ramones,
should be exciting. “Both Thorogood
and The Ramones are nationally
known and both have tremendous
stage shows.”’

Tickets for the Thorogood concert
will go on sale Tuesday at the W&L
Bookstore, Haywood said. They will
cost $6.50.

Most students will find the ticket
price high, Haywood said. ‘‘$6.50 is
more than the students are used to
paying for a show on campus, but
these bands get $13 a head at the
Roanoke Civic Center,” he said.

Haywood added that at approx-
imately $10,000 for each concert, the
two bands will be playing cheap. ‘‘We
caught both bands between dates at
arenas, so we got good deals on both
of them,” he said.

‘Boy Toy’

ALBUMREVIEW

By MARSHALL BOSWELL

 

 

For a long time, I was convinced
that Madonna’s most redeeming
feature was her terrific belly-button.
Goodness knows that she wouldn't
have raised an eyebrow if she hadn’t
tumbled onto the pop world with that
bare torso and ‘Boy Toy’ belt
buckle. However, through the magic
of sex-oriented promotion, Madonna
managed to raise some eyebrows.

So, as a result, I really had to
swallow my pride the first time I
heard her luscious new single, ‘Like
A Virgin.” Although it is, musically,
just a cheerful rip-off of ‘Billy Jean”

finally managed to transform that
steamy video image onto record. I
was hooked.

Her new album of the same name
is every bit as good, song for song, as
the single. Produced by Nile Rogers,
who produced David Bowie’s Let’s
Dance, Hall and Oates’ Adult Educa-
tion, and Duran Duran’s Wild Boys,
Like A Virgin has replaced the cold,
synthed-up froth of her debut album
with a crisp, crack-shot record of
delicious morsels that leave a plea-

sant taste in the mouth after
repeated listenings.
The album’s lead-off track,

“Material Girl,’’ teases ‘‘Some boys
kiss me, some boys hug me/I think
they’re o.k./If they don’t give me
proper credit/I just walk away...”’

Although I would like to think that
this is supposed to be taken tongue-
in-cheek, I tend to believe that
Madonna knows better.

If this record has a clear-cut inten-
tion, it is to raise body temperatures.
In “Dress You Up,’’ a sure shot for
her next single, she squeaks ‘‘gonna

dress you up in my love/all over your
body.’’ Anytime, sweetheart.

The album’s two ballads are nicely
done, and it is satisfying to note that
the better of the two, ‘“‘Shoo-Bee-
Doo,” was written by the lady
herself. Although ‘‘Love Don’t Live

From Staff Reports

 

eA fraternity has its pledges play ‘‘kill the
keg.”

¢Another house ‘‘invites”’ its freshmen to act
as waiters at lunch and dinner.

*Still other pledges are sent on a scavenger
hunt to collect ‘‘harmless’’ items such as
license plates, McDonald’s flags and Wendy’s
suggestion boxes.

To many fraternity members, this is part of
what pledge education is all about: achieving
that elusive ‘‘pledge unity’ that every house
seeks.

Some administrators, though, take a dim
view of such activity. The feeling seems to be
that pledge education should consist largely of

studying the history of the fraternity and car-
rying out community service projects.

Head dormitory counselor Bob Tomaso said
the fine line between hazing and education is
sometimes crossed, but that ‘‘it’s getting bet-
ter every year.”

“Every fraternity hazes, to a certain ex-
tent,’’ he said. “I’m sure there are a lot of
things that the Hill doesn’t find out about. But
some things that happen are just individuals
getting out of hand, rather than houses getting
out of hand.”

Tomaso said dormitory counselors attempt
to keep on top of any rule violations by frater-
nities, although not with total success. ‘‘To ig-
nore the problem is just ridiculous,’’ he said.
‘*We do the best we can.”

University records show that 16 of the 27 dor-

mitory counselors are or have been members
of fraternities.

Interfraternity Council President David
Perdue said that although hazing has been
“‘drastically reduced’’ since his freshman
year, it will take a few more years ‘‘to get it to
where it is entirely non-existent.”’

He added that he’s certain ‘‘nothing goes on
at Washington and Lee that really qualifies as
dangerous hazing.”’

Each person has his own definition of haz-
ing, he said, but one way to look at it would be
a “physically or mentally or psychologically
traumatic experience that a pledge would not
want to dobut could be forced to do.”’

As examples, he cited forced drinking and
making a pledge sit on a block of ice until he
tells a joke that’s suitably funny.

Perdue said that ‘‘dumping” a pledge in
some remote location is ‘‘a kind of joke and
everybody goes along with it.’’ He said it’s not
so bad ‘‘as long as somebody keeps an eye on
what’s going on.”

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of students
for fraternity affairs, said he relies primarily
on the dorm counselors for notification of any
abuse of freshmen by the fraternities.

“This year I can’t recall any hazing action
being reported by any of the dorm counse-
lors,”’ he said. ‘‘I’d like to think that we know
of all the incidents, but I’m not sure that we do.
I think perhaps a lot of it has been driven
underground.

School will
honor Lee

on Monday

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

 

The induction of 28 Washington and
Lee students into the Omicron Delta
Kappa leadership fraternity and a
speech by former W&L President
Robert E.R. Huntley will highlight
the activities at the 114th annual
Founders’ Day Convocation on Mon-
day.

The convocation will begin at 12:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel. Following Hunt-
ley’s speech, titled “The Way We
Were,”’ 16 seniors, six juniors and six
law students will be inducted into
ODK, a _ national honor society
recognizing outstanding leadership
that was founded at Washington and
Lee.

Founders’ Day at W&L is held an-
nually on or around the Jan. 19 birth-
day of Gen. Robert E. Lee, who was
president of the University from 1865
until his death in 1870.

Poor attendance at last year’s
Founders’ Day sparked criticism by
faculty and administrators of student
apathy and lack of regard for Univer-
sity traditions.

Bite your tongue

In response, Read’s lawyer
cites ‘substantial falsehoods’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

A report by a committee of the
Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar
Association contains a series of
allegations about Commonwealth’s
Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’? Read
that the committee says “if true,
reflect seriously on the professional
fitness of Mr. Read.”’

Read, the prosecutor for Lexington
and Rockbridge County, declined
comment on the report. His lawyer
said that ‘‘as constituted, it contains
substantial falsehoods.”

The information is contained in an
eight-page report of a committee
formed earlier this year to invest-
igate ‘‘the administration of justice
in Rockbridge County.”

‘‘Although the committee received
comments concerning the adminis-
tration of justice, by far the most
numerous and serious concerns re-
lated to the conduct” of Read, the
report states.

“If the information received by the
committee is false, Mr. Read de-
serves to be exonerated,”’ it contin-
ues. “If the information is true, his
professional fitness as an attorney
must be seriously questioned.”’

The committee said its findings fell
into three main categories: ‘‘unwant-
ed and uninvited sexual advances
and assaults directed at female
clients; betrayal of client con-
fidences; and prosecutorial miscon-
duct connected with the recently ad-
journed Special Grand Jury of the
Rockbridge County Circuit Court”
that investigated local drug traffick-
ing.

a the committee’s recommenda-
tion, then-president of the bar assoc-
iation J. Todd Jones forwarded the
report to the Virginia State Bar late
last year.

‘T unuerstanu an investigation is

underway,” Jones said.

Bar investigators Harry M. Hirsch
and Robert W. Kin of Richmond both
declined comment on reports that
they were in Lexington on Dec. 27 to
investigate the report's allegations.

Read is being represented in the
case by Joseph M. Spivey III of the
Richmond law firm of Hunton & Wil-
liams, where Read was an associate
from 1971-74.

In a statement, Spivey commented
on the report. ‘‘As constituted, it con-
tains substantial falsehoods,’’ he
said.

He declined to clarify the meaning
of the qualification ‘‘as constituted.”

“The report of the so-called Admin-
istration of Justice committee,
which, significantly, is not under
oath, is fraught with speculation and
innuendo and supported by state-
ments of anonymous persons, con-
victed felons and political opponents
of John Read,’’ the statement con-
tinued.

‘Read will be vindicated once his
accusers are required to testify and
be cross-examined under oath.”’

Spivey said he has asked the state
bar to investigate how reporters ob-
tained copies of the document

The report is accompanied by an

appendix of more than 37 pages that
purports to document the claims in
the report,

Jones said he discussed the com-
mittee’s findings with every member
of the local bar and informed them of
the report's contents before forward-
ing it to the state bar. He said he gave
Read a copy of the document Nov. 26

“In lieu of holding a general meet
ing, which I thought would have fo-
cused undue publicity on something
that should have been handled dis
creetly, I consulted each member in
dividually,’’ Jones said

After eight months of work, the
committee submitted the report to
Jones in mid-November

Drinking age of 21
could shut Cockpit

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A drinking age of 21 in Virginia
could bring about the failure of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Cockpit and prevent
the sale of beer at social events in the
pavilion, according to University of-
ficials.

And Dean of Students Lewis G.
John believes passage of such a law
is “‘almost certain” because of Con-
gress’ passage of law denying federal
highway funds to states that do not
have a drinking age of 21 by Oct. 1,
1986.

The Virginia General Assembly
will definitely consider raising the
drinking age, now 19 for beer, during
week, John
said.

“It is no longer a question of wheth-
er it will be implemented,” he added,
“but primarily a question of how it
will be implemented. ..and when.”’

“T don’t think there is any doubt’’
that a law raising the drinking age to
21 will be passed, said an aide to Del.
Vance Wilkins, a Republican who re-
presents Lexington and Rockbridge
County.

“The general feeling is that it will

Spectators at Saturday’s pavilion
concert must be on their best behav-
ior or they may no longer be able to
drink or purchase beer in the
pavilion, according to Associate
Dean of Students Mike Cappeto.

Alcoholic Beverage Control Board
agents will be ‘‘keeping their eye’’ on
the happenings in the pavilion, said
Cappeto, adding that ABC agents
were concerned about the number of
violations at the last pavilion con-
cert, in December.

Cappeto said that the ABC will be
looking for a ‘‘good, honest” effort by
the Student Activities Board to en-
force the rules.

“If there are several instances of
violations,’ Cappeto said, ‘‘they will
close the pavilion to beer like they did
Zoliman’s Pavilion.”’

If the ABC revokes the pavilion’s li-
quor license, Cappeto said, it proba-
bly would not be returned for the re-
mainder of the year.

The bar’s report: what it says

The ‘‘findings of the committee” section of the report
is divided into three parts:

v Sexual advances and assaults. “For a number of
years, rumors have circulated in the area alleging sex-
ual misconduct by Mr. Read directed toward his
clients,’ the report states. “The committee received
documents substantiating and lending credence to
these rumors.”

Among those documents, which are included in the
report’s appendix, are affidavits from two former
female clients and three letters from the local legal aid
society that allege such behavior by Read.

» Betrayal of client confidences and failure to protect
and promote the best interests of his clients. ‘‘Allegations
have been made in a pending criminal prosecution that
Mr. Read has used information obtained from private
clients in violation of his duty to maintain confidentiali-
ty,’ the report says

That is a reference toa motion filed Nov. 1 by Jeffrey
R. Pack, a former Virginia Military Institute cadet who
was indicted Sept. 4 on six counts of selling the hallucin-
ogen psilocybin. In the 16-page motion for dismissal, he
and a former VMI student who was arrested for arson
this fall charge Read with violating the principle of
lawyer-client confidentiality

The two, who left VMI without graduating, say that
when they met with Read in his role as a private at-
torney, he gained drug-related information that he then
passed on to the special grand jury that investigated
local drug distribution

Read denied the allegation ina six-page response mo-
tion filed the next day. Both documents are included in
the appendix to the bar report.

Rockbridge Circuit Judge George E. Honts III said
this week that he has transferred the Pack case to
another judge because it was he who empanelled the
special grand jury and because of his heavy caseload.
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III of Staunton, chief judge
of the 25th Judicial Circuit, has tentatively scheduled a
hearing on the motion for March 5 at 1:30 p.m. in the
Rockbridge County Courthouse.

~ Conduct of the special grand jury. In the fall of 1983,
Read, in conjunction with local law enforcement
agents, requested formation of a special grand jury to
investigate Rockbridge area drug trafficking.

The request came three weeks before the election in
which Read was running for a third four-year term. The
special grand jury was disbanded after a seven-month
investigation involving more than 200 witnesses.

‘Numerous incidents brought to the attention of the
committee evidence a pattern of conduct by Mr. Read
abusive of the Specia! Grand Jury process,’’ the bar
report says.

“Mr. Read’s attitude is exemplified by his statement
to attorney Wayne Heslep that although he might not be
able to get convictions on all the charges he would cer-
tainly embarrass a number of prominent citizens in the
community.”’

OPINION

Jan. 21

Can honor be found?

‘ At almost the same time every year, the Executive Com-
mittee asks for students who are willing to work on revisions
‘to the White Book, the bible of the Honor System here at
‘ Washington and Lee. And every year, in the tradition of Ro-
- bert E. Lee, students define through that committee what the
;current student generation considers honorable and
: dishonorable.
It is ironic that we celebrate Founders’ Day at about the
: Same time the posters advertising the formation of the White
' Book review committee begin to appear on the Colonnade.
Last year the students had enough respect for the ODK initia-
tion and President Wilson’s speech that almost 75 attended.
One only hopes that students respect the standards and vir-
tues that Lee embodied despite their absence from the
ceremony celebrating such ideals.

But the coincidence between few students’ attending Foun-
ders’ Day last year and the White Book Revisions Commit-
tee’s beginning to revise the Honor System is more than
ironic. It signals a subtle, but fundamental, change in the
way students view the Honor System and its creator, Lee.

Physical changes in the Honor System have come slowly in
the past. Only recently has the open trial been allowed for the
student’s appeal of his conviction at the closed hearing. But
changes in the perception of the Honor System have been
dramatic, both here and across the nation on various
campuses that have had healthy codes. Last fall, the Air
Force Academy revised its single-sanction system into a
system of graduated penalties. Temporary suspension and
expulsion are common punishments, and 19 students
previously expelled under the old Honor System have been
reinstated and will graduate from the Academy in the spring.
At Stanford University, a recent poll of the student body
shows that 94 percent believe in the Honor System strongly or
think it is a good idea. Amazingly, however, almost 33 per-
cent of those polled would not report a fellow student they
knew had cheated. Honor is a nice word, but it isn’t always
the best standard.

The time before us, then, is a time of great challenge. The
Honor System, governing all student affairs, is an integral
part of the University. In light of trends nationwide toward
skepticism about its workability, perhaps a serious study of
the state of the Honor System here at Washington and Lee is
in order. We may pride ourselves on our honesty in all our
transactions, but does honesty really govern our work? Can
we next Monday pay homage to the figure behind the Honor
System and sincerely believe in the same standards for
which he stood?

Some might call the association between honoring Lee and
Washington and the current state of the Honor System
exaggerated. Some say the relationship cannot be
overstated. It probably is better to err on the side of a close
relationship than none at all.

To the Editors:

Some changes are necessary in
parking procedures for campus par-
ties to be held in the new student acti-
vities pavilion.

Cars will be permitted to enter the
Liberty Hall fields directly from U.S.
60; attendants will be on duty to dir-
ect traific. That entrance will be
blocked, however, at 11 p.m, because
of extremely limited visibility — all
cars must exit by the Woods Creek
Apartment road.

All Law School and Woods Creek
parking lots will be available for

parking. All cars parked along the
access road in front of the apart-
ments will be towed, so please, car-
pool whenever possible. Two-way
traffic on all access roads must be
maintained in case of an emergency
With the cooperation of the student
body, we hope these changes will
help to avoid the traffic jams and
fender-benders of the previous par-
ties so that all attending can have a
good time with a minimum of hassle.
Have fun and don’t drive drunk!

many often praise Dr. King as one

It’s that time again. Animals hiber-
nate in the furthest recesses of any
grotto available, birds withdraw to
well-constructed and insulated nests,
flowers retreat to subteranean dep-
ths awaiting spring, trees stand nak-
ed having discarded their burden-
some leaves, and the ill-equipped,
red-nosed, sniveling human runs
from building to building avoiding
discomfort. That’s right, boys, you
constitute that small, questionably
foolish minority who choose to with-

ithe most dismal time that pass-
es inthe Shenandoah Valley. A time
that transforms Lexington, the ma-
trix of the intellectual universe, into
a veritable ice-box. It’s winter, baby,
and though one must endure the poor
weather regardless of anything, ven-
ting a little hostility can warm the
chilly soul like numerous nips off a

MY VIEW

 

By John
Pensec

 

It was cool and clear that evening
last August when I was driving along
the New York Thruway a few miles
north of New Jersey and home. The
wooded stretches near Clarksville,
N.Y. are beautiful in the quiet, sum-
mer evenings. Beside me in the pass-
enger seat was a friend from high
school, a sophomore at Dartmouth.
We were talking about a mutual
friend at The Citadel when it happen-
ed. Glass shattered. Metal crunched.
Heads waved back and forth. The
noise was deafening.

For the next few moments, my life
felt as if it had been put into slow mo-
tion. I remembers my head being
thrown forward into the windshield
and then back into the headrest, giv-
ing mea severe case of whiplash.

My eyes were shut tight and when I
finally forced them open I found my-
self viewing the world upside down.
It felt as though I were on a roller
coaster but at the same time it was
unlike any ride I have ever ridden
before.

Quickly I shut my eyes, but sum-
moned the courage to open them
again a few seconds later. What met
my sight filled me with horror.

The car came to rest in a ditch by
the side of the road. The front end
was neatly molded into the shape of
the guardrail it had struck.

I came to rest about 10 feet from
the car after having been thrown
sideways out of the driver’s window.
My mouth was full of dirt and a few
pebbles. For a moment I could not
remember where I was.

At first glance, the damage to my
mom’s car did not appear to be so
bad; I even tried to punch some of the
dents out myself. But then I realized

seems unworthy of the South

Wardrobe reaches the apex of
creativity during these wintery mon-
ths, particularly among those of the
female gender. The word ‘‘creativi-
ty’’ is possibly less accurate than a
simple opportunity for more effec-
tive disguise. Robert Newhouse
thighs, Vasily Alexiev stomachs and
more chins than a Chinese phone
book are just some of the more
unsavory physical deformities that
may be camouflaged by a long, wool
plaid skirt, victorian turtle-neck and
a baggy solid green, pull-over sweat-
er. Wait, let us consider this not
altogether infrequent occurrence. An
empassioned man, motivated by the
primitive want of ‘‘warmth’’ on a
chilly Virginia evening’ occupies
inordinate amounts of time, money
and brain cells coercing his sweet lit-
tle love bird into his proverbial love
nest. But, loand behold, this frustrat-
ed playboy encounters not a balmy
romantic reprieve from the winter
coldness in the form of a tender, well-
formed fledgling, but rather a well
fed penguin. Walrus might also be fit-
ting.

Away from controversial issues,
the male dress code inspires laughter
as it occupies such a broad spectrum.

Winter fashions on the W&L campus
range from the pseudo-Wall Street,
Alvin Dennis man, complete with
trench coat, leather-palmed gloves,
and in the more hopeless cases, a
tweed brimmed hat, to the popular
union carpenter leather ----kickers,
complemented by faded blue jeans
and simply anything warm covering
the torso. The hat in the latter case
makes the outfit, and is normally the
classic baseball cap which, when re-
moved to alleviate the hassle of an it-
chy scalp, reveals a hair style echo-
ing a WWII German assault helmet.

Further, could an article concern-
ing winter be complete without ad-
dressing the grievous circumstances
those of us encounter when residing
in buildings unfit for sub 70-degree
weather? The architects, if they de-
serve such a title, obviously labored
under the grave misconception, ‘like
many others, that Virginia-‘is the
South. Anywhere the mean tempera-
ture for the month of January dips
below 65 degrees is unworthy of the
adjective Southern and is, in my esti-
mation, unworthy of being inhabited.
This brief digression aside, let us talk
about frozen pipes, which rule out
one of the most splendid of all lux-
uries, a warm shower.

Or what about the mysterious cold
spots and drafts that your landlord
attributes to the tenant’s mind-im-
posed para-psychological disturban-
ces, but your pocket infared heat
scanner traces to the large crevice
between your window sill and the
wall? If one should get that steamy
shower and locomote his scantily
clad body through the barrier of po-
lar air and push beyond the threshold
of pain, the wintry wonderland
awaits. Go ahead, step outside, don’t
forget to bring an ice pick to comb
your frozen hair and put on Chapstick
before both lips split in four places,
creating unsightly wounds bearing
remarkable resemblance to ‘‘cold
sores’’ and, hey, expect the body's
lesser appendages to run for cover
like a scared turtle. Nor should one
be surprised if an opera scout expres-

‘ses interest in a new-found soprano.

Seriously, one could ramble inde-
finitely about inanities like those
heretofore expressed. All I ask is that
W&L embark on a fund drive to con-
struct a winter term retreat in Ja-
maica. I think we all would be much
happier and willing to intellectually
enlighten ourselves with the thought
of four-foot glassy peelers awaiting
us in the afternoon. Doobie wah!

for other’s decision

think about my friend still in the car
or even of myself. My only thought
was that my mother was going to kill
me.

I noticed that the hazard lights
were blinking. I must have turned
them on soon after the collision. I
don’t remember.

A gash in my leg was spurting
blood which ran down my leg and into
my deck shoes. Blood between the
toes squishes when you walk.

My friend was fine except for his
lower lip. He had bitten it in fear.
That natural response cost him five
stitches.

Two cars and a Greyhound bus had
pulled over to see if they could help
(no one will ever convince me that
the people of New York are cold-
hearted.)

The people who stopped applied
basic first aid, and in general took
over the whole situation. I was only
too glad to let them. They wanted me
to sit but a tremendous pain in my
lower back made it virtually impossi-
ble. A chill in the summer night made
it seem more like November instead
of August.

Two guys who had stopped took off
in pursuit of the hit-and-run driver.
He hadn’t traveled far, and soon
abandoned his car and proceeded to
walk along the side of the highway.
He said he was trying to walk home
to Brooklyn, about an eight-hour
walk. He resisted their attempts to
take him to the police but soon lost
the battle. He refused to take a
breathalyzer test the police attemp-
ted to administer. He said he did not
remember hitting us.

Very quickly an ambulance came
and took us to Nyack Hospital. I was
treated well, with one exception: the
nurse would not let me go to the bath-
room until the doctor had seen me.
That hurt more than the injuries to
my leg and back.

We arrived at the hospital shortly
after midnight, but it was almost two
hours before the doctor came and
took care of me. In the meantime, the
hospital called my home, and my

brother and sister came to take me
thonaht

hame nrenthev

The doctor thought that I may have

, damaged my kidney so they wanted

to keep me overnight and run tests in
the morning. My brother and sister
went home, taking my friend with
them. They would wake my parents
and tell them what had happened. I
meanwhile asked the doctor if I was
going to be moved to a private room.
He laughed and proceeded to extract
a sizable piece of glass from my
back.

I'll always remember the other oc-
cupants of the emergency room that
night. One man was wandering
around, having no idea who he was or
where he was, and a woman had call-
ed the paramedics because she had
an earache.

It turned out that my kidney, like
the rest of my body, was bruised. The
hospital released me in the morning.

The one thing I remember people
saying over and over was how lucky
my friend and I were. Undoubtedly
this is true. The glass in my back
could have done a great deal of da-
mage to a lung had it lodged in my
chest instead. Of course, someone
might have died in the accident. A
friend of mine had decided not to join
us that evening. She would have been
sitting in the back seat.

The driver of the car that hit us was
drunk. He couldn’t walk a straight

 

line, much less drive a car. Today, he
is free awaiting trial, his license sus-
pended. It is little consolation that he
may lose his license for up to three
years-one year for each offense.

He is 20 years old, and ironically, is
a student at the John Jay School of
Criminal Justice in New York City.
He will soon gain first-hand know-
ledge of the criminal justice system.
He decided to drink and drive. Now
he must pay for that decision. I am
sure that he will be inconvenienced
by not being able to drive, but if it
saves one person’s life, it will be
worth it. I’d rather not see him drive
ever again.

Think about his parents. They de-
serve more sympathy than he. Ob-
viously, I do not know what they are
thinking and feeling, and hopefully I
never will.

What I am thinking is that some-
day my life may once again be put in-
to the hands of their son or others like
him. I don’t like that.

So think about this the next time
you drink and drive. The cute sayings
about ‘‘friends don’t let friends drive
drunk”’ carries a lot of weight. When
you’re lying on the side of the road,
having been thrown from your car,
drinking and driving take on a new
significance.

committee, says in the report that when she was repre-
senting a special grand jury witness, Read forbade the
witness, a minor, from discussing the testimony with
anyone upon penalty of a misdemeanor prosection.
“When challenged on this point by Ms. Moore, Mr.
Read eventually told Ms. Moore that he had obtained
authority from a member of the State Attorney Gene-
ral’s office,” the report relates. ‘Ms. Moore later

parent violation of the law; ‘showed a disregard and

contempt for Grand Jury witnesses and their legal
counsels’; and questioned some witnesses, including

teenage females, about their sexual activity.

In addition, the document charges that Read ‘‘at-
tempted to have one attorney forcibly removed from
the Grand Jury room by the Sheriff of Rockbridge
County when the attorney attempted to consult with his
client.” It also says that certain information given to
the special grand jury appears to have been divulged to
law enforcement officers.

The bar procedure: What’s next?

The Rockbridge County-Buena Vis-
ta Bar Association has submitted its
report to the Virginia State Bar,
which is now conducting its own in-
vestigation of the charges contained
in the report.

“This committee, having no legal
investigative authority, is in no posi-
tion to pursue the truth or falsity of
these matters any further,” the re-
port states. ‘Accordingly, this com-
mittee recommends that its report
and accompanying documentation be
transmitted to the Virginia State Bar
for investigation and appropriate ac-
tion.”

According to the Code of Virginia,
each congressional district in the
state has a District Committee of the
State Bar that investigates charges
of misconduct that arise in that dis-
trict.

After a complaint such as the
Rockbridge bar’s report is received,
a preliminary investigation is laun-
ched. The committee then deter-
mines whether a hearing is warrant-
ed. A misconduct hearing is ‘‘con-
ducted as an adversary proceeding,”’
complete with witnesses and ‘ex-
hibits.

If the committee finds that the al-
leged misconduct has, in fact, occur-
red, a private reprimand is deli-
livered to the attorney and the mat-
ter is certified to the Virginia State
Bar Disciplinary Board for further
action.

The 12-member Board has several
options after hearing the case. It may
deliver a private reprimand to the at-
torney, deliver a public reprimand,
suspend the license of the attorney

 

“Prosecutorial misconduct.’’
The term has arisen several times
recently in connection with Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
‘‘John’’ Read, but he says he does-
n’t take the charge too seriously
when it comes from a man who’s
been convicted of more than a doz-
en felonies and is serving prison
sentences totaling more than 100
years.

In a motion filed Jan. 9 in U.S.
District Court in Lynchburg, Wil-
liam Edward Blair charges Read
with “prosecutorial misconduct”
and “misconduct and abuses of
the prosecutor.”’

Read says he worked with offi-
cials from 16 other jurisdictions to
coordinate evidence against
Blair, who was convicted in a 1981
Rockbridge County case for his in-
volvement in what Read called “‘a
rather large and substantial theft
ring.”

‘“‘We’re charging Mr. Read with

 

failure to supply exculpatory evi-

Mr. Blair that was withheld dur-
ing the trial,’’ said Blair’s at-
torney, Deborah C. Wyatt of Char-

“It goes to the very core of the
heart of our system,’’ she contin-
ued. ‘‘If you don’t disclose excul-
patory information, you're not
seeking truth. This duty is so fun-
damental that Mr. Read, if he’s
passed the bar, is aware of it. It’s
not something that he could not
know about.”’

“It’s what I call a fill-in-the-
blank lawsuit,’’ Read said yester-
day. ‘‘He can file this stuff indefin-
itely. I have a whole box full of it
upstairs. He’s appealed several of
them as far as the Virginia Su-
preme Court and he’s lost each
and every time.”

“He charges me with con-
spiracy,’’ Read said. “‘It’s true
that we coordinated that effort,
but it’s not against the law to coor-

 

 

dinate criminal prosecution.”’

“I'd say it’s a likely possibility, but
I don’t know enough to confirm it as
true,” he said.

Mike Lehman, president of Pi Kap-
pa Alpha, also feels some hazing goes
on. “I would agree with what Hay-
wood says about the ‘unacceptable’
activities occurring at other fraterni-
ties,” he said.

Phi Kappa Sigma president Jim
Cobb, on the other hand, was unwill-
ing to agree that fraternities are en-
gaging in verboten pledge activities.

“At Phi Kap, we are not taking
time from our pledges that would be
unacceptable to the University or the
national chapter,’’ he said.

At Delta Tau Delta, president Rick

Gatti supported Haywood’s position.
“I do believe that there probably are
some houses doing things with

their national chapters would not ap-

“‘T don’t believe it’s because we en-

“When you join a frat, I don’t believe
it means you don’t want to be a stu-
dent at W&L. We spend no more time
on pledge education than in the

Trustees to talk tuition, coed

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Board of Trustees this weekend will set tui
tion for next year and continue grappling with the
nuts and bolts of implementing coeducation this
fall. but in the best Washington and Lee tradition
will take time out for a Friday night party.

Meeting in Atlanta, the 25-member board will
celebrate Robert E. Lee’s 178th birthday at the
8th annual “Lee Day’’ fete sponsored by the
alumni chapter there

‘Lee Day,” which since 1978 has been held on
the Friday ‘night closest to Lee’s birthday, will be
hosted by Beverly M. ‘‘Bo” DuBose III, a new
trustee and president of the Atlanta alumni chap-
ter He was elected in October and his term began
this month

‘“‘We want to celebrate the fact that we went to
W&L and we had a good time while we were there
and we enjoy getting together again to meet the
people we went to school with and others,”’ Du-
Bose said

“There are no talks, no speeches, no pressing
for anything. It just allows people who went to
W&L to gather and meet new friends and renew
old acquaintances. "’

DuBose expects 400 W&L celebrants at his At-
lanta home. They'll be greeted by an open bar as
well as fresh shrimp, crab claws, tenderloin,
chicken bits, and “‘you name it — it’s a full-blown
meal,’’ he said

Because the event is so helpful for encouraging
alumni involvement and impressing prospective
students, DuBose said he and the alumni office
are hoping other chapters will begin a similar
practice. ‘‘That’s the goal that we've set,” he
said

Back in the world of running the University, the
trustees will decide in their meetings Friday and
Saturday what the 1985-86 tuition will be, how
much the school will have available for financial
aid, and what changes will be made next year in
compensation for professors

University President John D. Wilson said the
question is not whether tuition will go up next fall,
but by how much. “We think we're facing an
economy of between 5 and 6 percent inflation, but
the expenses of the University seem to be increas-
ing by more than that,’’ he said.

Among the large budget items W&L is facing
are the additional faculty members who are be-
ing hired to implement the core curriculum. Ad-
ditional positions have been authorized in the

Romance languages to handle increased enroll-
ment in French and Spanish

Additional costs stem from the upcoming
change to coeducation, although Wilson says
those are ‘‘relatively modest expenses.”’

$150,000 has been budgeted for conversion of
washrooms, modifications of the dormitories and
changes in both indoor and outdoor athletic facili-
ties

A female athletic director and an associate
dean of students for women will be hired, and a
woman trainer may be added. ‘‘I’m not now plan-
ning any new personnel for security, but that may
change,” Wilson said

Dean of the College Pamela H. Simpson, who
heads the committee on coeducation, will present
her subcommittee’s recommended plan for con-
verting the dormitories to coeducational living.

Wilson said he will ask the Board for ‘‘a signal
if it would be wrong”’ to begin plans for renovat-
ing the currently unused building known as 32
University Place for use by the admissions and fi-
nancial aid offices rather than for faculty hous-
ing. The development office would then move into
the vacated rooms in Washington Hall.

The Board will also discuss a ‘‘fundraising ini-
tiative’’ for a new theater.

Food, not vigilantes, found in this Subway

 

By TED BYRD
Staff Reporter

 

Although many people associate
subways with vigilantes, the owners
of a new local restaurant hope you'll
think of sandwiches

The Subway sandwich shop, the
most recent restaurant to open in
Lexington, began business on Dec. 21
while Washington and Lee was on
Christmas vacation. The restaurant,
owned by Bob Luciano and David
Komonce, specializes in ‘‘New York
Style’ subs and features daily spec-
ials on Buschdraft.

The shop, located at 10'2 Lee Ave.,
has been doing excellent business
since W&L students returned, Lucia-
no said. Other local merchants ‘‘told
me to watch the students,"’ he con-
tinued, ‘‘but they've been very court-
eous and helpful”’ so far.

Luciano and Komonce intend to ca-
ter to the student community in Lex-
ington by ‘‘bringing a lower price to
food, keeping the beer prices really
down’’ and by staying open later than
most local restaurants. The Subway
is open from 11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and

 

 

Traffic was heavy at the new Subway sandwich shop this week.

from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday. In addition,
deliveries will be made from 8 p.m.
to 12:30 a.m. Monday through Satur-
day. All items on the menu, including
beer, are available for delivery. Fee
for delivery is $1.

The owners agreed that business

Friday and Saturday, the first week-
end that Washington and Lee stu-
dents had been back from break, was
great. ‘‘We sold over 600 sandwiches,
and about 80 percent of the crowd
was students,’’ Luciano reported. He
also mentioned that the shop seems
to be popular with women visiting

Luciano and Komonce are both na-
tives of New Jersey, but the former
has been in Lexington for about two
years and is the owner of the Country

Lexington. The latter moved to Rock-

 

bridge County in October.

 

 

 

 

Local hospital opens renovated facility

 

By PETE BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s Stonewall Jackson
Hospital will celebrate the opening of
its recently renovated facility Satur-
day with tours, demonstrations by
medical teams and special services
for visitors.

The escorted tours begin at 10 a.m.
and end at 2 p.m. A medical helicop-
ter and several pieces of sophisticat-
ed medical equipment will be on dis-
play. Area rescue teams will demon-
strate cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion, blood pressure will be checked

for free and blood types will be tested
for $5. Refreshments will be served
after each guided tour.

Josephine McCown of the Washing-
ton and Lee infirmary said Stonewall
Jackson is responsible for many of
the medical services provided to
W&L students. Because of the infir-
mary’s limited facilities, several
hundred students are referred each
year to the hospital for laboratory
services, x-rays, emergency room
services and surgery.

Any services rendered by Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital must be paid
by the student.

vices at Stonewall Jackson do not

Students’ car overturns
on U.S. 60; none injured

 

From Staff Reports

 

Three Washington and Lee
students escaped injury Saturday
when the car in which they were rid-
ing overturned on U.S. 60 in Amherst
County.

The car, driven by sophomore Ke-
vin Cope, was traveling about 40 to 45
miles an hour when it ran off the
right shoulder of the road, according
to state police Trooper L.D. Bishop.
Cope overcorrected, Bishop said,
causing the car to cut back across
both lanes of the road and hit an
embankment on the left side. The

         
           

car, a 1979 Honda, turned over and
came toa rest on its top.

Cope and two passengers —sopho-
mores Tom Thagard and Lloyd Will-
cox — were going to Sweet Briar Col-
lege for a mixer.

The accident, which occurred
about 7 p.m., was eight miles east of
Buena Vista and nine-tenths of a mile
east of the Blue Ridge Parkway,
which divides Rockbridge and Am-
herst counties. The posted maximum
safe speed on that section of road is
30 miles an hour, Bishop said.

Cope, of San Marino, Calif., was
cited for reckless driving, according
to Bishop.

United Press International
reporter and former Washington and
Lee student Steve Hagey lived to tell
about it. Although five journalists re-
main the captives of various terrorist
groups in war-torn Lebanon, Hagey
was lucky.

A W&L English major who gradu-
ated in 1974, Hagey was named UPI’s
bureau chief in Lebanon in Decem-
ber 1983 and spent most of the past
year covering the terrorism, conflict
and death there.

Speaking to a W&L journalism
class yesterday, Hagey said, “From
the first day I got there, I heard gun-
fire, bombs and the works for a solid
year.”

Hagey said that life in Lebanon had
rapidly deteriorated during his year
there, and by December, he was rea-
dy to get out. ‘‘I noticed each time I
went out and then came back, it got
harder to come back,”’ he said.

But on Saturday, Dec. 29, Hagey
said, ‘The thing I feared most hap-
pened.”’ He and two other journalists
were kidnapped from a restaurant by
people he believed were ‘‘Lebanese
thugs” dissociated with any political
organization, he said.

Although Hagey said he told the
kidnappers he was a journalist, they
insisted that he was a CIA spy. The
three journalists were taken to Hag-
ey’s apartment, where they were
threatened and harrassed.

“IT was scared to death into believ-
ing that what they were going to do
was take me out and kill me,’’ he
said. ‘Grab another American, grab
another headline.”’

“I kept telling them I was a jour-
nalist,’’ he continued. ‘‘They were de-
nouncing Reagan, Israel, America,
all the while they were chain smok-
ing Winstons and Marlboros.”’

After a long ordeal, the other two
journalists escaped, and Hagey was
freed.

Drop/add update

The registrar’s office processed
498 drop/add forms last week, as stu-
dents finalized their winter term
schedules, University registrar Har-
oldS. Head said.

“We always have more drop/adds
at the beginning of the winter term
because of students’ failing courses
or doing poorly in classes in the fall
term,’’ Head said.

Head said he noticed no appreci-
able changé in the number of
drop/add slips from winter term last
year, when 527 forms were turned in.

King Day celebration

 

From Staff Reports

 

Although blacks have come a long
way over the years, they still have a
long way to go, according to the Rev.
Rudolph Featherstone, speaking at a
program celebrating the birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr.

Featherstone spoke to a crowd of
nearly 200 people Tuesday night at
the First Baptist Church of Lexing-
tén. The program was sponsored by
the Black Law Student Association
and the Student Association for Black
Unity of Washington and Lee and the
Promaji Club of Virginia Military In-
stitute.

Featherstone told the audience
that he questioned an economic re-
covery that has seen 1.3 million
blacks enter the unemployment line
and also questioned a system that
allowed for 8 million to be unemploy-
ed so that others can work.

Featherstone, a professor of theo-
logy at Trinity Lutheran Seminary in
Columbus, Ohio, also warned against
people of color that deny their heri-
tage to ‘‘just get by.”’ He said that
people should be proud of what they
are and of their heritage.

Featherstone’s primary teaching
area is the theology of Martin Luther
King Jr., and he also teaches courses
in black religion and social issues.

Two hunters found guilty
in connection with deaths

Two hunters were found guilty in
Rockbridge General District Court
yesterday of reckless use of a

HBO premiere

Sem professor’s book turned into cable TV movie

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Sometime in March or April, a new
movie will premiere on Home Box
Office. Premiere movies are nothing
new for HBO, but what's different
about this one is that it is based on a
book by a Lexington resident and
Southern Seminary Junior College
professor.

“Dark But Full of Diamonds”’ is
the name of the book that has been
turned into the as yet untitled movie.
It is the fifth novel by Katie Lyle, who
teaches American literature and
English composition at Southern
Seminary. She also participated in
Washington Lee’s Summer Scholars
program for high school seniors last
year.

Like Lyle’s previous novels, the
subject of the book is teen-agers,
something she said developed from

her years of teaching. After 23 years
at Southern Seminary. she said che

feels sometimes that she is ‘‘not
much more than a teen-ager my-
self."

The movie tells the story of a 12-
year-old boy whose mother dies. His
affections for his mother then are
redirected to his swimming coach, a
girl several years older than he. The
story continues as the two are separ-
ated and meet again five years later.
By this time the boy has grown up
and the feelings of both characters
have changed.

Lyle said that although her novels
deal with children and teen-agers,
they are not strictly children’s books.
All five of her novels have been pub-
lished in both hardback and paper-
back by major publishers, and, Lyle
noted, several books have been pro-
tested as unfit for children because of
their sexual explicitness. Despite the
protests, Lyle’s first two books were
nominated for the Newberry Award
for excellence in children’s books and
were finalists in that national com-
petition.

Lyle’s latest works represent a
departure from fiction and a removal
from the topic of teen-agers. A year
ago, she published ‘‘Scalded to Death
by the Steam,” a book of stories and
songs about railroad wrecks. Just fi-
nished and being considered by pub-
lishers is a book about a 19th-century
West Virginia ghost story that also
involves a court case. These books
may not have wide readership, Lyle
admits, but they are about things
that interest her.

Personal interest plays a large
part in Lyle’s choosing her topics.
Lyle said her next project will be a
cookbook that she plans to write with
her sister. This will be a bit unusual,
though — it will be a collection of the
worst recipes ever. Lyle also has
written newspaper columns on mush-
room growing and bluegrass music,
and was one of five writers chosen to
work on a series for public television
on family problems and parenting.

The HBO movie is nearly finished,
Lyle said. All that remains is some

editing and soundtrack work. The
tentative title for the movie, the
producer told her, is ‘“‘Almost Like
Being in Love.’ The date the movie
will air has not been set.

The movie was shot in Toronto and
stars Lance Guest, whose last role
was the lead in ‘“‘The Last Starfight-
er.”’ Lyle’s 13-year-old son also audit-
ioned for a role in the film, but was
not chosen. He did win over the boy
who auditioned on the same day he
did, Lyle said. The other boy is the
son of actor Donald Sutherland.

Lyle’s feelings about the movie are
mixed. She said she is happy to have
one of her books made into a film, but
is not completely satisfied with the
screen treatment of her novel. ‘‘It’s
uncomfortable to have your work
changed and reshaped by somebody
else, she said. Although she partici-
pated in writing the script, she feels
that some important things were left
out. But, she sighed, ‘‘That's the way
it’s gotta be.”

Mesner case
called atypical

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Last month’s dismissal of arson
and murder charges against Scot
Tanner Mesner was atypical, two
Washington and Lee law professors
said this week.

The professors, William S. Geimer
and Roger D. Groot, added, though,
that they could not second-guess
Rockbridge Circuit Judge George E.
Honts III’s dismissal of the case.

‘‘He had all the evidence, he heard
all the arguments and he gets paid to
make that decision,”’ Groot said.

The Dec. 21 dismissal of the charg-
es in connection with last spring’s
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house
fire came after Commonwealth’s At-
torney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read had
rested the prosecution’s case. Honts
held a two-hour hearing on Mesner’s
motion and deliberated in his cham-
bers for 45 minutes before dismissing
the case.

Announcing the dismissal, Honts
said Mesner’s due process of law
may have been violated by investiga-
tors who used a ‘‘suggestive’’ photo-
graphic lineup and failed to give Mes-
ner’s attorneys the names of witnes-
ses who could not identify him as
having been at the fire.

In cases such as this, in which the
prosecutor fails to turn over evidence
favorable to the defense, Geimer and
Groot said the defendant does not us-
ually, if ever, learn of such evidence
until after the trial.

“It’s unusual to have a dismissal
based on non-disclosed evidence
when that evidence is brought for-
ward or comes out before the end of
the trial,’ said Groot, who teaches
criminal law and criminal proced-
ure. “It’s the first flat-out dismissal
I’ve ever seen.”

Geimer, who teaches courses in
criminal law and judicial law and
was a defense attorney in North Car-
olina for eight years, said the dismis-
sal ‘certainly was fortuitous’ for
Mesner. Had the evidence come to
light after a conviction, Mesner
would have had to petition for a
retrial.

Geimer and Groot said Honts had

options other than dismissing the
case. For example, Groot said, Honts
could have denied the dismissal mo-
tion and later cited Read for con-
tempt of court for disobeying his
Nov. 8 order, which required Read to
give Mesner the names of witnesses
who could not identify him as having
been at the fire.

Acknowledging that the dismissal
was unusual, Honts declined to dis-
cuss other options that were avail-
able to him, “I spent an hour thinking
this thing through, and I don’t want to
be second-guessed,"’ he said.

Honts noted that Special Agent
Gerald Simpson, who investigated
the fire, testified that he showed a
single photograph of Mesner, rather
than a photograph of Mesner among
a group of photographs of other peo-
ple, toseven witnesses.

‘‘We started off with seven; we’ve
got three (former W&L law student
Warren Nowlin, W&L English
Professor Jean Dunbar, and her hus-
band, Peter Sils); where are the
other four?’’ Honts asked. ‘‘If you
don’t know who they are, how are you
going tofind out?”’

Groot and Geimer also agreed that
Read was responsible for informing
Mesner of any exculpatory evidence
— evidence that could tend to exone-
rate him — including names of wit-
nesses who could not identify him as
having been at the fire scene.

‘‘My opinion is that the stuff had to
be turned over, even without the or-
der, but with the order, it becomes
absolutely clear,” said Groot.

Lowering

By PETE BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

 

A recurring shock during the rush
that accompanies the beginning of
each term is the amount of money
spent on textbooks. Typical student
reactions range from ‘too much;
just outrageous”’ to ‘I don’t care—
I’m just charging it home anyway.”’

Are textbook prices really increas-

book prices may be difficult

ing? Yes, they are. Can anything be
done to lower them? Not really, ac-
cording to Bookstore Manager Hele-
na W. Roller.

Roller, who has been at W&L for a
year, after nine years at Mary Bald-
win College, says that everything
possible is being done to hold prices
down. In most cases, prices are dic-
tated by the publishing companies,
which require that prices be held

Medicare ‘revolution’
foreseen in law article

Changes enacted in the Medicare
system may revolutionize the system
by which Americans pay for their
health care, according to an article
by a Washington and Lee law profes-
sor and a W&L law student.

J. Timothy Philipps, professor of
law, and Don E. Wineberg, a third-
year law student from Chicago, are
the authors of an article titled
‘Medicare Prospective Payment: A
Quiet Revolution’ in the Fall 1984
issue of the West Virginia Law Re-
view,

In their article, Philipps and Wine-
berg review the changes in the Medi-
care system that resulted from the
Social Security Amendments of 1983
and make a series of predictions
about the eventual impact those
changes will have not only on Medi-
care but also the entire health care
industry.

According to Philipps, the new
system is based on a method of plac-
ing illnesses in 468 categories. A
specific price is placed on each of
those categories, and Medicare will
then reimburse a hospital that
amount.

“The hospital receives that stand-
ard payment regardless of the pa-
tient’s length of stay,”’ Philipps said.
“Tf the hospital is efficient and treats
the patient for less than the standard
Medicare payment for the particular
illness, then the hospital makes a
profit. If the stay is longer, then the
hospital loses money.

“So far the changes have resulted
ina decrease in the average length of
a hospital stay for Medicare patients.
The system is accomplishing one of
its goals — that is to hold down costs.
Hospitals have an incentive for effi-
cient health care delivery.”

The changes currently apply only
to in-patient hospital expenses. In
their article, Philipps and Wineberg
predict that the system will eventual-
ly be expanded to cover more servic-
es such as physicians’ fees and out-
patient services.

Possible effects of the change in
Medicare cited by Phillips and Wine-
berg include hospital specialization,
selectivity in technology use, chang-
es in service utilization, fewer hospi-
tal admissions and increased pread-
mission testing and outpatient treat-
ment.

above a certain level.

From the profit that the Bookstore
does make, postage for the books’ de-
livery must be paid, and then re-paid
to have any unused books returned to
the distributors, Roller noted. With
the February postage rate increase,
this amount will become even great-
er.

Also, the salaries of the store’s
workers have to be paid from the
store’s profit margin and the book-
store’s special services also cut into
the store’s profits. Check cashing,
special book orders and orders for
out-of-print books are all handled at
nocharge.

The best suggestion Roler had for
saving money is to buy used books,
though even those seem pretty ex-
pensive. Used books are handled by
an outside company, which buys
books at the general rate of 50 per-
cent of their current new value, and
re-sells them at 75 percent of that
value. Currently, only a small num-
ber of used books are available, but
Roller hopes this service may be ex-
panded in the near future by greater
effiency on the contractor’s part.

Roller said the most expensive
books are technical books, especially
computer books.

a hectic time for the Bookstore, with
the first day being the busiest. Two or
three extra workers are hired, and an
extra cash register and adding ma-
chines are installed to help shorten
lines. Roller added that limited
numbers of some books, delayed
shipments and the failure of some
professors to order their books have
added to the confusion.

Because professors have complete
autonomy in ordering books, simpli-
fying the Bookstore’s task is not
easy. Different reading lists for each
professor mean more paperwork,
more time spent sorting and pricing
and more money spent on postage.
Still, Roller said that morale among
the Bookstore workers is high, and
that ‘‘the work is never boring.”

According to Roller, the best way
to increase customer satisfaction is
communication. If students have
complaints or suggestions, they
should bring them to her. She said
she is open to ideas and willing to
help solve problems.

Immediate goals for the Bookstore
include organizing a spring sale to
match last fall’s Moonlight Madness
sale, Long term goals include compu-
terizing the store’s charge and inven-
tory systems and ultimately revamp-
ing the interior of the store.

Automatic Rule threatens 94 students

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Students who fail to meet minimum academic
standards fall under the automatic rule — ‘‘sever
their connection with the University,’’ in the
words of the Catalogue.

That sounds drastic, but administrators say
there are good reasons for the rule.

“The logic behind the Automatic Rule is not to
punish students, but to protect them,’’ said Pame-
la H. Simpson, associate dean of the college at
W&L and chairman of the Automatic Rule Com-
mittee. ‘‘Letting students do inadequate work
gets them in a deeper and deeper hole with their
GPA.”

She said the Automatic Rule is designed to en-
sure that students progress toward attaining
their degree within the prescribed time. A stu-
dent’s progress is measured by his cumulative
grade point average.

The required GPAs by the end of the academic
year are 1.5 for freshmen, 1.6 for sophomores, 1.8
for juniors and 1.9 for seniors.

Simpson said those are the minimums that will

Washington and Lee student, you should be able
to do Washington and Lee work,”’ she said.

Removing students who fail to do adequate
work from the University prevents them from
falling too far behind in their work toward their
degree, Simpson explained. It also allows them
time to correct any problems they may have had
that affected their work.

Students who fail to meet the Automatic Rule
requirements are dropped from the University
for a minimum of a year, unless they are immed-
iately reinstated. Immediate reinstatement is
granted only under extenuating circumstances,
such as illness or personal problems.

Those students who are dropped may petition
for reinstatement. The petition must show that
the problem that caused the inadequate work has
been corrected.

A student who has been reinstated is automat-
ically on academic probation and must achieve a
1.9 for his fall term. At the end of the academic
year of his reinstatement, his GPA must equal or
exceed the requirements for his class. If he fails
to meet any one of these conditions, he is per-
manently dropped from the University.

Before being subject to the Automatic Rule, a

Simpson said that is to warn students of the dan-
ger they are in.

A student is placed on academic probation
when he fails to attain the cumulative averages
required by the Automatic Rule at the end of
either his fall or winter term. Students on proba-
tion may participate in no more than one extra-
curricular activity.

There are currently 94 students on academic
probation, including 73 freshmen. Last year at
this time, only 76 students were on probation with
50 of them being freshmen. Two years ago, the
number of students was 70. Only 33 freshmen
were on probation at that time.

Simpson attributed the rise in the number of
students on probation to the new curricular
requirements. ‘‘Students are forced to take things
they may not want to take,”’ she said

Simpson said the University makes a big effort
to counsel students who are having difficulty.
Freshmen who are not at or above a 1.5 at mid-
term or at the end of the term are asked to meet
with a dean. Students who have GPAs between 1,5
and 1.9 receive a letter on the Automatic Rule in-
forming them of its consequences. Students are

also urged to talk with their advisers when they
have difficulty.

EC reviews yearbook budget report

 

BY STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The budget report for Washington
and Lee’s yearbook, Calyx, came un-
der some scrutiny at Monday night’s
Executive Committee meeting.

According to the report submitted
by Calyx Business Manager Burf
Smith, yearbook revenues were
$31,714 as of Jan. 14 while expenses
were $10,314.

“What is remaining will go toward
publishing costs,’’ Smith explained at
the meeting. He also noted that he
would like advertisement sales,
which have not yet been figured in, to
produce $6,000.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers mentioned that only $2,000
was made from advertising last
year, but Smith said that higher
amounts were earned in previous
years and that he has two motivated
ad salesmen.

Junior representative Pat Hayden
questioned Smith about a flip-flop on

outstanding accounts owed by frater-
nities.

‘‘What’s holding it up now is deter-
mining who has possibly paid and
who hasn’t,”’ Smith said.

Following the meeting, Smith said
one house owes $100 for one-half year
and one house owes $600 for three
years. He also believes that six
houses each owe $200 for one year.
Although this would add up to $1,900,
Smith said he can only be sure about
$1,300 because three of the six houses
may have paid.

Calyx Editor David Sprunt said
after the meeting that Phi Gamma
Delta is the fraternity that owes the
$600. Smith did not comment on the
names of other houses owing money
at this time.

Smith did say that no pictures will
be taken this year until houses pay
this year’s $200 and any back money
owed. Nobody at the meeting ques-
tioned the inconsistency of including
$1,900 in revenues for outstanding
fees and zero revenues for this year’s
fees when neither has been paid.

In other business, EC Vice Presi-
dent James White, sitting in for Pres-
ident Cole Dawson, reminded mem-
bers that students wishing to serve on
the White Book Revisions Committee
must submit their names to the EC
by Monday.

Junior representative Michael
Black reported that the band Speidel,
Goodrich and Goggin is scheduled to
perform in the Cockpit on Friday,
Feb. 8, to benefit the United Way. It
was noted that students attending
this weekend’s George Thorogood
concert at the Pavilion may bring as
many guests as they like, but W&L
students must have a student ID (or
library card and photo ID) to be

admitted.

Caruthers reported that the Voting
Regulations Board will meet this
week to try and ‘‘revamp the anti-
quated regulations.”’ Caruthers also
said efforts are underway to upgrade
the school’s outside lighting system.

Black mentioned that the EC minu-
tes are not being posted on campus
on time. Freshman representative
Brandt Wood said that he has receiv-
ed four or five reports about items
having been stolen from his hall in
the dorms.

‘‘Let’s talk about that in Executive
Session,’’ White said.
The meeting was adjourned at 7:50

p.m., at which time the EC went into
Executive Session.

Martinez choreographs
duels in Chicago ‘Hamlet’ .

Joseph Martinez, assistant pro-
fessor of drama, recently completed
choreographing the duels in ‘‘Ham-
let’ for the Wisdom Bridge Theatre
Company of Chicago.

The Wisdom Bridge Theatre is a
celebrated professional theatre com-
pany that has produced many criti-
cally acclaimed world premieres in
Chicago during the last 10 years.
“The current production of ““Ham-
let,” featuring Aidden Quinn, star of
the film ‘‘Reckless,”’ in the leading
role, will open in Chicago Jan. 31.

In pre-performance publicity, Chi-
cago Magazine said of Martinez, ‘‘Jo-

seph Martinez is the only outstanding
stage fight choreographer Chicago
has ever produced.”

Martinez received his bachelor’s
degree from Illinois Wesleyan Univ-
ersity and a diploma from the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts in Lon-
don. He has served as instructor at
the University of Denver and the
Goodman School of Drama and was
an assistant professor of drama at
Virginia Commonwealth University,
the Valley Studio, Western Illinois
University and the University of IIli-
nois. He is the author of a book on
stage combat titled, ‘Combat Mi-
me.”

Admissions
maintains size

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

No additional admissions staffers
are needed despite the upturn in in-

 

. terest in Washington and Lee by high

school seniors this year that has dra-
matically increased the work load of
admissions officers and the student
recruitment committee, according to
admissions officers.

‘*We’ve had a tremendous increase
in the work load, but we’ve been able
to handle it,” said Van Pate, assoc-
iate director of admissions. ‘‘We've
been busy, but it’s been a good kind of
busy.’’

One measure of the work load is
that the admissions office already
has received 1,344 applications, 979
from men and 365 from women. Last
year by Jan. 14 the admissions office
had received 779 applications from
male students.

Pate said that admissions office
personnel had to work during the
first week in January, the last week
of students’ vacations, in order to
handle the large backlog of mail that
had built up during Christmas week.

Pate said it was the number of in-
terviews the staff had to conduct that
also placed a heavy strain on admis-
sions officers.

At the end of the year the admis-
sions office will consider if additional
staff members are needed, but sev-
eral factors weigh against an in-
crease in staff size, Pate said. Even
with the present staff level, one ad-
missions counselor has his office on
the third floor of Washington Hall,
away from the main admissions of-
fice. If any additional staff members
were added it would be almost impos-
sible to find office space for them
near the main office, Pate explained.

The student recruitment commit-
tee, which gives prospective students
tours of the campus, also has been
busier than in previous years. Glen
Jackson, head of the committee,
noted that this year, during peak
hours on Mondays and Fridays two
student guides have had to be on duty
instead of the usual one.

He added that guides frequently
have led larger groups around cam-
pus than in previous years.

Jackson and Pate agreed, how-
ever, that the student recruitment
committee should retain its present
size of 49 guides next year, and Pate
added that he was not aware of any
plan to increase student recruit-
ment’s size.

“Of course, if you take around four
people instead of two people you
don’t get the same individualized

attention,” Jackson said. ‘‘But I
think our guys have done a great job
this year.”’

Pate asserted there is not a pro-
blem regarding prospective students
not getting enough attention from the
guides if there are just two or three
students in a group. But he added
that tour groups do get a little un-
wieldy when there are a couple of big
families in a group.

Sometimes a larger tour group
could even be an advantage, Pate
commented. With more people in the
group someone might ask a question
that another person was interested in
but forgot to ask, he explained.

Another phenomenon related to the
increased interest in Washington and
Lee this year is that some students
who might have had an outside
chance to get into Washington and
Lee in the past are ‘“‘self-selecting’’
themselves out of the admissions pic-
ture this year because of the increas-
ed size of the applicant pool.

“Applicants know by osmosis how
good a candidate for admission that
they are,” Pate said. ‘‘Some people
realized that this year W&L is not go-
ing to be realistic’ for them.

Pate said the admissions office has
not yet compiled any statistics that
would validate any claims about the
quality of the applicant pool, but the
students seem to be both qualified
academically and very active in their
schools and communities.

Likewise, the admissions office has
no statistical information regarding
how W&L is faring against tradition-
al recruiting rivals such as the Univ-
ersity of Virginia, the College of
William & Mary and Duke. Pate indi-
cated that the admissions office will
eventually survey all applicants who
were offered admission to find out
what other schools they considered
and why they selected or did not
select W&L.

“Students and especially parents
now see W&L as what U.Va. was
when there were only 3,000 under-
graduates there,” Pate said.

Pate noted that the deadline for ap-
plications is Feb. 1. Last year, 1,502
applications for admission were re-
ceived.

The aide said that Wilkins always
has been in favor of raising the drink-
ing age.

Food Services Director Jerry Dar-
rell said he believes that a higher
drinking age ‘‘would make all the dif-
ference in the world (to the future of
the Cockpit) since seniors only would
be able to drink beer.”’

“We're in trouble financially,”
Darrell said. ‘‘Wednesday nights are
the only thing keeping us open.”’

“Without coeducation,”’ he said,
‘the Cockpit may very well fail.’’

This term Darrell has decided the
Cockpit will close at 2:30 p.m. every
Monday to try to hold down losses.

Despite putting in a new menu in
response to customer’s suggestions,
the Cockpit had lost more than $2,300
by Dec. 1 of last term.

‘‘We’ve done everything we could
think of, but the students just aren’t
coming down,” Darrell said. ‘‘We’re
not going to try to improve our bus-
iness by having more happy hours.’’

A drinking age of 21 may be the
fina] nail in the coffin for the Cockpit,
Darrell said, because the University
probably won’t want to subsidize a.
beer pub that can cater to only a
quarter of the students.

law would necessarily alter the
“frenzied drinking that we have’’ at
W&L.

“T think it would be naive to think
that a new law would significantly
change students’ drinking behavior,”
he said. “The obvious impact is on
public drinking.’’

For example, acquiring an Alcoho-
lic Beverage Control Board license
for the sale of beer at the pavilion
during concerts or dances will be-
come impossible, according to John.

“Those who sponsor social events
will have to be a little more creative”’
in providing entertainment, he said.

John said he opposes a_ higher
drinking age.

‘There are other ways to achieve
the objective of decreasing drunk
driving...and raising the drinking
age is not necessarily the best,’’ he
said.

In the upcoming school year Dar-
rell foresees the Cockpit as a gather-
ing place for W&L women, and he is,
therefore, planning to do a ‘“‘little re-
modeling.”’

A ‘higher drinking age would
necessitate the introduction of
“mocktails,”’ exotic drinks without
alcohol. Darrell mentioned that
‘Pink Ladies’’ would be one addition
to the menu for next year.

“I’ve received a lot of helpful input
from students and the Coeducation
Committee,”’ Darrell said in regard
to changes for the Cockpit and other
food services.

In the event of a higher drinking
age Darrell said that more emphasis
will have to be placed on non-alcoho-
lic aspects of the Cockpit, such as
entertainment.

He suggested that a video recorder
may be purchased or that afternoon
soaps may be shown next year.

Darrell sees no problem enforcing
a new drinking law.

“Carding is not really a problem
now...The guys do a pretty good job
down there,’’ he said,

Cruisin’

Big Lex

For once, a view from the other side of the radar gun

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

In covering the police station for The Ring-tum Phi
this year, I’ve probably come into contact with the
police as much as anyone else (with the possible excep-
tion of some rather hardcore partiers). Yet most of this
time has been rather haphazard at best.

The police have instigated a ride-along program in
which citizens and students actually ride with an officer
on his patrol.

In the interest of learning more about the police
department (and getting my editors off my back) I
sacrificed the usual fraternity party on Friday night
and spent from 9:15 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. riding in a patrol
car with Officer F.W. Smith.

Smith is a two-year member of the force and lives in
Buena Vista with his wife and three children. Due to the
massive firings which occurred several years ago after
the police theft ring was uncovered, Smith is the third
highest ranking officer in terms of seniority.

The evening started off with a quick tour of the station
house and an explanation of the various little gadgets
found within the patrol cars, especially the ‘Alco Sen-
sor II,’’ and the infamous radar we all love so much.
(Attempts to sabotage the device were foiled by Smith,
who expected such a move on my part. )

We began our night by checking the various schools
and offices in the surrounding area, especially the car
dealerships to ensure everything was locked up secure-
ly.

Around 10 p.m. we pulled into one of his favorite

speed trap locations (I have been sworn to secrecy) and
watched the magical radar. We also began to compare
notes on the various girls’ schools. Smith turned out to
know more about the schools than I did, and as the night
wore on it became increasingly embarrassing to have
all these girls know him by name. Smith felt that the
prettiest girls came from Hollins.

Around 11 p.m., we headed back to the station to
check in with the other shift, which had just started.
Busy nights usually meant there were four cars patrol-
ing.

The usual shop talk commenced and each officer
made note of which houses were having parties, who
had noise permits, how crowded the local bars were,
and the general feeling on how the night was going to
be.

We left the station house around 11:15 and went back
to a Law School party we had visited earlier. Several
cars were illegally parked and Smith had gone in to
warn the owners to move them.

Obviously, by the time we had come back little had
been done and one of the other officers called in a tow
truck. Amazingly, all the cars were moved within five
minutes after the tow truck appeared. (We also got a
call from the dispatcher that a neighbor had called
complaining about all the red lights and asking us to
turn them off.)

Smith and I continued on our patrol. He showed me a
few more hiding spots he frequented and we pulled into
one to try and catch some speeders. It was during these
frequent stops that I learned more about the various
officers in the force and some of the basic policies they
try to follow.

One such policy, which Smith stuck to throughout the
night, was to constantly check on the other officers. As
anyone who watches cop shows knows, the dispatcher
gives and receives messages to and from the officers.
Any time an officer leaves his car, he radios this to the
dispatcher. Since all the cars carry the same frequency
radios, each officer can keep in constant touch with the
others. Therefore, when one officer left his car the
others would constantly drive by and make sure he did-
n’t have any problems.

At 12:20 p.m., a call came to investigate a domestic
problem. Smith said these were some of the worst be-
cause one never knew what to expect. ‘‘Just imagine
getting a call saying, ‘See the woman.’ It could be
anything from getting attacked by an irate gun-toting
husband to getting a cat out of a tree,”’ he said.

The seriousness of the call became even more evident
when all four cars pulled up to the house. In this case
there was no real problem and the cars soon left and
continued their respective rounds.

At 1:30 a.m., things began to pick up for us. I got my
first chance at real excitement as we raced down the
streets of Lexington, lights flashing, after a possible
DUI suspect. Once again, we were foiled in our at-
tempts at our first catch of the night.

Later in the night, while driving down Washington
Street near the Centel office, we spotted two youths try-
ing to make off with a ladder. By the time we had turned
to give chase the suspects had fled but we credited our-
selves with once again foiling the criminal elements of
Lexingtén.

After checking out the ladder, we spotted a car full of
girls go by. A quick silent agreement and we were after

them. After all, there were more than two people in the
front seat and the driver was a cute blond

This was my first chance to watch tongues of Hollins’
finest convince Lexington’s finest that her BMW ‘‘just
had a mind of its own.” No sooner had we stopped than
she was jumping out of the car, blabbering some incom-
prehensible story that I did not even try to decipher.

I say she was from Hollins merely because my now
professionally trained detective eye had noticed the 2-
foot “Hollins” sticker on her back window and the
“‘WhereinthehellisHollinsCollege”’ bumper sticker.

Smith let her rave on for about five minutes and then
asked her if she was from Hollins. (He too had noticed
the stickers.) Well this just threw the girl for a loop, and
she proceeded to go on and on and on about how smart
and brave he must be. Seeing me rolling on the hood of
the police car in laughter gave Smith the excuse to hand
the girl back her license, after rearranging the seating,
and sent them on their way.

The rest of the evening proceeded at a slower pace.
What could possibly top that last episode? We did stop a
few more cars that seemed to be swerving but never
caught a DUI. It seemed almost as bad as snipe hunt-
ing.

Around 3 a.m. we called it a night. Smith filled up the
old cruiser and we went in and filled out the mileage
charts, duty rosters and all that other police stuff.

Though we didn’t catch any DUIs or have any mur-
ders or break-ins, the night was pretty fun. I guess hav-
ing a slow night is really the best thing that could hap-
pen, for the police and especially for us. Until next
week, when I get to cover the 10 p.m. to1 a.m. action at
Wendy’s drive-thru window.

Before today, only white salt fell

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

Last Thursday, rumors and threats
of snow were flying like leaves on a
fall afternoon. Students began to re-
think their plans for the weekend,
and the radio kept promising a blank-
et of snow before Friday morning
crept around.

‘But the snow never came.

_ So why were the streets covered in
salt for the snowstorm that never
came?

David Woody, a member of the
Lexington Department of Public
Works, said, ‘‘We know it looked bad,
but we had to doit.”’

Woody said that Thursday night’s
preparation cost between $2,400 and

_ $2,500. That may seem like a great

deal of money to spend on a simple

snow storm, but Woody said that an
operation of this kind can run as high
as $4,000.

 

The department must rely on the
same information that the public
receives, he explained. They must
judge a storm’s arrival by radio
broadcasts as well as information
from the National Weather Service.

In most cases, the department will
get the preparations underway as
early as a day prior to the storm, if
the information is available. Two
driving crews of about five are set to
the task. These drivers are present
employees of the department who al-
so work as street patching crews,
water sewer crews, and the like.

The two crews constitute a day
shift and a night shift. The prepara-
tion begins by checking the depart-
ment’s stockpiles in order to ensure
that an ample supply of sand, abra-
sives, and salt is available. In addi-
tion, the trucks are checked for pro-
blems and snow plows are added to
some.

ODK

 

O Continued from Page 1

Frank A. Parsons, executive assis-
tant to University President John D.
Wilson, said at the time that he was
“embarrassed for the University”
because of last year’s poor atten-
dance.

At one time, attendance at
Founders’ Day events was not op-
tional.

Until the 1969-70 academic year,
the University Catalogue stated that
a student ‘‘is required to attend”’ cer-
tain ‘‘compulsory assemblies.”’

But since 1970, the catalog simply
has said that students are ‘‘expected
toattend.”

The outlook for this year’s con-
vocation is much brighter, according
to religion Professor David W.
Sprunt, ODK faculty advisor, who
said he is expecting a good turnout.
He added that 115 people have made
reservations for the ODK luncheon
following the convocation.

Better publicity about Founders’
Day as well as a ‘‘growing interest’’
in the concepts of ODK should spark

a high turnout for the ceremonies,
Sprunt said.

Sprunt added that he thinks the
ceremonies would be well attended
even if someone as well known as
Huntley weren’t speaking. ‘‘I don’t
think the interest hinges totally on
who the speaker is, but rather the
ceremonies themselves,”’ he said.

Sprunt couldn’t speculate as to
what the title of Huntley’s speech,
“The Way We Were,” refers to. He
did say, however, ‘‘It should be in-
teresting.”’

Chapter V, Section 3, of the Bylaws
of the University requires that
classes be cancelled on Founders’
Day. Despite that requirement,
classes will only be shortened to
leave students free to attend the
ceremonies. Monday’s class sched-
ule is as follows:

A Hour: 8:00-8:40

B: 8:45-9:25

C: 9:30-10:10

D: 10:15-10:55

E: 11:00-11:40

night costs nearly $40 a ton. The de-
partment used 25 tons that evening,
so that explains a large part of the
cost. The salt is only effective in
temperatures above 23 degrees Fa-
hrenheit, so lower temperatures re-
quire a mixture of salt and various
abrasives for sleet and ice, small
stones and sand are applied to the
streets.

The day in which the snow falls al-
so plays a major role on the price of
the operation, Woody said. If the
streets can be taken care of before
closing time, then labor costs are
held to a minimum, However, in the
case of Thursday night, the workers
were all working on overtime. Simi-
larly, a snow scheduled to arrive on a
weekend or a holiday can escalate
costs significantly.

Although Thursday’s storm warn-
ing was a false alarm, the next one
may not be. The Public Works De-
partment will be ready.

Fawcett to appeal verdict
of U.Va. honor hearing

 

From Staff Reports

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE — The
University of Virginia sophomore
found guilty in a public hearing
last fall of an honor violation will
appeal the verdict in another
public hearing Feb. 2.

The student, Monique Fawcett,
was accused of turning in for
regrading a mathematics test on
which the grade had been altered
and several grader’s marks had
been changed.

Fawcett, however, will not
return to U.Va. even if she wins
her appeal, according to yester-

Colleges’ tax-exempt land
part of ‘good relationship’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

When five Lexington Fire Depart-
ment trucks answered an alarm at
the Commerce School in November,
one of those watching the action was
Charles F’. Phillips Jr., mayor of Lex-
ington and a Washington and Lee
economics professor.

“‘Tax-free property, and you bring
out all this equipment?’’ he needled
Edward C. Atwood, dean of the W&L
Commerce School, after the two had
been told the alarm was simply
because of some smoke from a blown
electrical transformer. ‘‘I’ll send you
a bill!” ras

Phillips was only joking, but not
everyone is amused by the tax-free
status enjoyed by all W&L and Vir-
ginia Military Institute real estate.
All non-profit organizations are ex-
empt from the tax, the largest source
of revenue for the city.

Courtney P. Baker, Lexington’s
commissioner of revenue, said there
is ‘‘very much, too much’’ tax free
real estate in the city.

“The tax-exempt property here
has a greater value than the taxable
property, which is very difficult,”
she said. “‘I don’t think you’d find
many localities where that situation
exists.”

Only 44 percent of the assessed
value of Lexington land is taxable.
W&L, for example, sits on $71,818,500
worth of land — 28 percent of the
value of the real estate in the whole
city.

If property taxes could have been
collected on the 56 percent of Lex-
ington land that is tax-exempt, the
city would have an_ additional
$1,411,827.42 entering its coffers this

 

day’s Cavalier Daily, a U.Va. stu-
dent newspaper. Fawcett is
quoted in the newspaper as saying
she is appealing merely ‘“‘to set
the record straight.”’

At U.Va., a student convicted of
an honor violation can appeal only
if new evidence comes to light or if
a procedural error was made in
the original trial.

As at Faweett’s original trial,
the appeal jury will consist of 12
students — four members of the
Honor Committee and _ eight
students selected at large.

Faweett’s original conviction
Sept. 30 came after a 12-hour trial.
At least 10 of the 12 jurors had to
vote guilty for her to be convicted.

fiscal year.

“Obviously, if we had a larger tax
base, each person would have to pay
less tax,” Baker said. “The city
government just has to run the city
on what it is able to collect.’’

That being the case, do city leaders
and citizens harbor resentment
toward the universities and other
tax-free properties within the Lex-
ington limits?

Absolutely not, says Baker.

“The colleges are very important
to Lexington — they’re very wound
together,’’ she said. ‘‘People are hap-
py the schools are here. I think they
feel Lexington is a nice community,
and it is enhanced by the schools.”’

Baker said W&L and VMI also con-
tribute significantly to the economic
health of the area. For example, she
said a number of clothing stores and
restaurants could not survive without
the business generated by the
schools. :

“‘One services the other,”’ she said.
‘‘There are a number of businesses
here that are here because of the

students and faculty. At the same
time, it is convenient for the students
and faculty that those businesses are
here.”

“I believe they’re very interrelated
and I believe it’s a good relation-
ship,”’ she added.

By law, property values are
reassessed by independent ap-
praisers every four years. The pro-
cess was completed in Lexington just
prior to this fiscal year, which began
July 1.

Since the institutions hold their
land in perpetuity, some property
values are difficult to determine
since no market can exist for them.
How, for example, did officials deter-
mine that the land the VMI Parade

Ground sits on is worth $72,000?

“T would think that evaluating
things like a football stadium or the
VMI Parade Ground would be some-
what subjective,’’ Baker said. ‘‘But
we do have land sales in town, so you
do have something to relate it to”’

Other local sources of city i.
are a personal property tax on
automobiles and business furniture
and fixtures, a 2 percent tax on
restaurant food and transient lodging
and a business license tax.

At W&L, only facilities that are us-
ed for educational purposes are tax-
exempt. For example, tax is paid on
the school’s Alumni House and on
undeveloped land holdings.

Because VMI’s land is owned by
the state, the school has no parcels on
which it pays tax.

Both institutions pay a_ service
charge for faculty and staff housing
at a rate that may not exceed 50 per-
cent of the real estate tax rate.

Lexington is not the only Virginia
locality with a high percentage of
tax-exempt land. In Portsmouth, for
example, nearly 60 percent of the
property is tax exempt. Federal
government holdings account for 90
percent of that.

In Charlottesville, both the Univer-
sity of Virginia and the University of
Virginia Hospital, the main economic
bases of the city, are exempt from
property taxes.

A joint House-Senate subcom-
mittee of the state legislature has
been formed to study ways to ease
the financial burden on localities
with such high concentrations of tax-
exempt land.

Increasing service charges for non-
profit organizations is one of the key
proposals the group is examining.

from the field.

Although Maryville’s free throw
percentage (66.7 percent) was only
slightly less than W&L’s (70.5 per-
cent), the Generals attempted 22
more free throws than the Scots and
gained an overwhelming margin at

The Generals established the first
major lead in the game when they led
the Scots 15-10 early in the first half.
Maryville, however, rallied and out-
scored the Generals 7-0 and took their
first lead in the ballgame at 17-15
with six minutes left in the half. The
Scots could not continue their mo-
mentum and only scored two points
in the remainder of the half. Shannon
put the Generals ahead 18-17 with
5:34 on the clock when he completed
a three point play. W&L took a 24-19
lead into the locker room at halftime.

Maryville scored first in the second
half to cut the Generals’ lead to three
points. Working patiently against
Maryville’s man to man defense, the
Generals built an eight-point cushion
and led the Scots 36-28 when Shannon
hit two free throws with 12:33
remaining in the game.

Maryville then applied a full court
press fo the Generals offense that
produced several quick scores and
cut W&L’s lead to four points, 38-34,
with 8:30 to play. The Generals then
outscored Maryville 16-6 and led the
Scots by 14 points 54-40 with two min-
utes left in the game. The Generals
turned the ball over a few times in
the last minutes and allowed Mary-
ville to cut into their large lead, but

A delay of more than a month bet-
ween dual meets did not affect the
Washington and Lee swimming team
as it continued its winning ways with
a 61-44 win at Towson State.

Before the meet, Coach Page Rem-
illard was concerned with how the
team would do after a month of in-
tense workouts, but afterward he was
able toenjoy the victory.

“I was very happy with the way we
swam against a very good Towson
team,” said Remillard. ‘‘We have
been working hard in practice and I
wanted to use this meet as a gauge to
see how far we had come. The team,
as a whole, performed very well,
with most of our swimmers near
their best times.”’

There were many outstanding per-
formances this past week and one
was turned in by All-American Taber
Smith. Smith, who had mononucleo-
sisis through Thanksgiving, won the
50-yard freestyle in 22.95.

“Tam very happy for Taber Smith,
who seems on the road to recovery.
He showed everyone a lot with his
performance in the 50-yard free,’’
commented coach Remillard.

Remillard was also pleased with
the swimming of freshman Simon
Perez, who won the 200-free in a time
of 1:49.23. Perez’s winning time was
also his lifetime best in that event.

“It is exciting to project what he
will eventually be able to do, con-
sidering he swam that fast after our
heavy workouts,”’ said Remillard.

‘“‘T shouldn’t be at my best yet,
since we have been working so hard

recently,’’ Perez said. ‘‘When we
taper our training in a few weeks, I
should do even better.”

Perez said it was tough coming
back during Christmas but he was
also pleased with its outcome.

Roanoke currently has a 7-4 overall
record and a 2-2 ODAC record. Last
night Roanoke was defeated by
ODAC leader Maryville in Roanoke.

The W&L vs. Roanoke game has a
rich history and it appears that this
year’s game will write another excit-
ing chapter. ‘“‘The Roanoke game will
take care of itself,’’ said Coach Can-
field. Canfield said that he knows a
large number of W&L fans will at-
tend tonight’s game and help the
Generals utilize their very important
home court advantage. Coach Can-
field sincerely appreciates those who
attend the Generals’ home games
regularly and reminds those who
don’t that they are missing an ex-
citing W&L team.

Last weekend the Generals picked
up two victories as they won the W&L
Invitational tournament. The Gene-
rals crushed St. Mary’s 96-57 in the
first round on Friday night. The Gen-
erals followed Friday night’s win
with another impressive victory over
SUNY-Utica by a score of 79-57 in the
championship game.

Winning awards for their outstand-
ing play during the tournament were
Generals Lex Fitzenhagen (all-tour-
nament team) and Scott Shannon
(Tournament’s Most Valuable Play-
er).

NOTE: A W&L student I.D. may be

required for tonight’s game to avoid

‘Sure it was a lot of hard work, but
I would like to look back at the end of
the season and attribute my success
to those 10 days.”

The team’s victory over Towson
was “‘iced,’’ as Remillard likes to
say, when the divers, Mark Chiap-
para and Tom Amico, won their
events. Amico won the one-meter
dive with 156.85 points.

“I also have to congratulate the
divers; and in particular Tom Ami-
co, who has come along very well and
has made a significant contribution,”’
Remillard said. ‘‘They are not a high
priority, but they work hard and we
can’t live without them.”’

“Mark and I work hard, we video
tape our dives and watch,” said Ami-
co. ‘‘We’re looking to improve our-
selves, do better than the week be-
fore, and with that will come more
competitiveness.”’

This year’s swimming team is
made up of many freshmen, who are
experiencing heavier workouts than
they’ve been used to. But the team’s
3-0 start is due to the leadership of the
seniors, according to Perez.

“It’s been tough making it through
one year,” said Perez. ‘‘That’s why
we all look up to the seniors who have
been doing it for four.”’

This weekend the Generals will
swim in a double dual meet against
Georgetown University and Frost-
burg State at Frostburg.

Wrestlers open new year with wins

 

From Staff Reports

 

Despite being without the services
of senior captain Jeff Dixon, the
Washington and Lee wrestlers came
away with three impressive wins at
Saturday’s Hampden-Sydney Quad-
rangular, upping their undefeated
string to five. The trip to Farmville
yielded victories over Johns Hopkins
(33-9), Hampden-Sydney (34-11) and
Loyola (47-3).

“I thought the team really made up
for the loss of Dixon,’’ Coach Gary
Franke said. ‘‘We got some early
wins at the lower weight levels that
made things easier for us.”’

In the Generals’ opening match of
the quad, W&L faced Johns Hopkins,
a team that the Generals beat by only
six points last year. Franke expected
a closer match, but saw the dif-
ference as being in the Generals’
ability to perform up to their poten-
tial at the lower weights.

Franke said pins from Jeff Mazza
(134 Ibs.) and Larry Anker (142)
were keys to the team’s win. ‘“‘Those
two falls put the match almost out of
reach for them. I think it took a little
bit of the punch out of them.”

W&L closed out the match with
wins at the last four weight classes.
Generals Win Phillips (167), Greg
Kendrick (177) and Mark Weaver
(HWT) all recorded decisions, and
Joe O’Neill pinned his opponent at 190
Ibs.

In their second match of the after-
noon, a pair of early forfeits, coupled
with Anker’s one-point decision at 142
gave the Generals another early
lead WRT. again ran out the match
with the heavier weight classes, win-
ning four of the last six bouts.

“T think we did a little bit better
this time than when we faced them
before (a 38-15 win Nov. 28),”’ Franke

Sydney Quad by winning his three individual bouts.

said. “They (Hampden-Sydney) just
don’t have the manpower we do.”

Franke said the Generals used
some of their depth in the final match
against Loyola. ‘“‘We used some extra
people who performed well,”’ he said.
The Generals won nine of the 10
bouts.

For the day, triple winners for
W&L were Mazza, Phillips, Kendrick
and Weaver, while O’Neill, Anker
and 118-pounder Steve Castle record-
ed two wins during the afternoon.

Saturday, the Generals play host
for a four-team event, featuring
squads from Division I schools: Duke
(a 35-7 winner over the Generals last
year) and VMI, and Pittsburgh-area
Division III school Washington and
Jefferson, whom W&L turned back
22-21a year ago.

“It will be a real challenge this
weekend,” Franke said. ‘‘We should
have a real close one with W&J,” he
added, indicating that the Generals

   
   

will again be without 190-pounder
Dixon. Franke expects the senior,
who is recovering from arthroscopic
knee surgery, to be ready for the
W&L College Invitational on Jan. 26.

Franke said the scheduling of Divi-
sion I opponents can be beneficial to
the team, especially for the wrestlers
as individuals.

“Some of the good competition can
lead us to improvement in our
preparation for the Eastern
Regionals (Feb. 14-16). It’s an area
that, I think, we need to concentrate
a little more on. I think we have some
people capable of wrestling at that
level,” he said.

Moses: still
a class act

..What a week to talk about

TIME sports! Everything and everybody

from Dan Marino and Edwin Moses

OUT. ee. (© prostitution and the Roanoke

a SS game look to be fair game from this

4 ; corner, so let us begin with the taint-

' ing of the Olympians in the past few

days. The blood doping, drug-test

failures, etc., etc., have

(fortunately) reached a point of oversaturation. Recognizing the pro-

blem is old hat. Combating it is the next step, but it is a step that is

simply not feasible. As an East German sports official has pointed out

in the past, it just doesn’t really matter what drug tests they develop,

there will always be a way to get around them if that’s what you want
to do. Sad, perhaps, but true.

This revelation (is it a revelation?) coupled with the Moses arrest
over the weekend has a good many people wondering where our heroes
have gone. A USA TODAY (M-O-U-S-E) story Tuesday examines
(cough, cough) some of the situation in which Moses’ agent said the
hurdler was merely joking when approached by the female under
cover agent. In the article, Penn State sports historian (does he teach
a class?) Ron Smith said Moses would probably come out “fairly
pure’ if compared with Babe Ruth. Smith also concluded, “I guess we
expect our heroes to be something better than the rest of us.”’

Gee, Ron, who clued you in? I don’t know about you but my idea of a
hero used to include that forgotten (?) notion of the role model. Moses
has said that an athlete is put in a position of ‘‘heavy responsibility
whether he wants it or not.’’ Does this make him susceptible to having
his character trashed by public airing, regardless of the validity of the
charges? (Does this sound like the pot calling the kettle black’ It
should.) In other words, are we, the public, to see athletes only for
their wonderful performances on the playing field and remain ig
norant of their life without the uniform? Is it fair to put them on a
pedestal?

I have said in the past that athletes are people, too (of all things!) ;
they do make mistakes. But this fallibility is not an excuse. The
responsibility Moses talks of is something an athlete cannot ignore.
I’m not asking them to be saints (some of them, it would seem, have
difficulty in reaching the level of us sinners) ; rather, I would wish that
they act with the knowledge of their place as public figures. At the
same time, I’d wish the public would remember that athletes are not
immune to mistakes.

In the end with the Moses situation, let us remember that one inci-
dent does not a man’s character make. Edwin Moses is and always
will be a class individual and a credit to the athletic world. You can in-
fer whatever you want about my opinion of the charges leveled against
him....

...Coming home to coherence and the Colonnade, you're fooling
nobody when you say the General cagers are hot. We'll find out how
hot tonight, but let’s put it this way: If you’re wearing maroon, don’t
expect it to be a good night. Seriously, though, the Generals have won
four in a row because they have controlled tempo and shall we say,
have a firm grasp on their potential... Speaking of firm grasps on
potential, Coach Gary Franke’s wrestlers are at least as hot as the
cagers and get a well-deserved round of applause from this cor-
ner...And one more tip of the cap, this time to the swimmers, as they
are undefeated after three...January has thus been super, Generally

....Other news of note: Oh yeah, that affair in California this Sunday.
Can't waitfor OJ.and Tom Landry on the pre-game show, but then I’m
impressed by the darnedest things. The prediction? I think the 49ers
have a better defense, better enough to make a difference in this Star
Wars clash of the QBs, and since Joe Montana's name is a letter longer
than Dan Marino’s, we’re going to have to go with Frisco. The line
says three, we’ll say 10...

....Finally, a note from the For What It’s Worth Dept.: Marty Flet-
cher’s Keydets lost an early-season game to Old Dominion by four
points. The Monarchs lost Sunday to No. 13 DePaul by six. Point: Get
to Cameron Hall if the occasion permits itself. Ron Carter’s ghost may
be stirring....

Pavilion opens 1985
with some changes

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
‘The Back Page”’ Editor

 

There will be a few changes at
Saturday's Student Activities Board
concert in the pavilion, but SAB
Entertainment Director John Hay-
wood said most students won't notice
the changes or have any less fun
because of them

The most notable change will be a
limit on the amount of beer that can
be purchased by concert spectators.
Haywood said that when someone is
admitted to the pavilion, he will be
able to purchase three beer tickets
for the whole evening.

Although the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board will be keeping a
watchful eye on this concert,
Haywood said, they had nothing to do
with the limit on beer purchases.
Rather, the featured attraction
(George Thorogood and the Dele-
ware Destroyers) is the cause of the

limit.

‘Thorogood normally does not play
where beer is sold,’’ Haywood said.
“This is a compromise on both parts
to have beer at the concert.”’

Haywood said this rule applies only
to this concert, and the beer distribu-
tion will be normal for next week’s
Ramones concert.

Another change for this concert is
the addition of paid bartenders and
security. In the past, Haywood said,
these chores have been handled by
SAB members.

“It’s not that the SAB members
weren't doing a good job, it’s because
they only work shifts up to an hour or
so, and we need people to work the
whole night,’’ Haywood said.

This concert is the beginning of the
SAB’s attempt to bring big name acts
into the pavilion on a regular basis,
Haywood said. ‘Whether the student
body supports the concert or not will
determine whether or not we can con-
tinue to bring in these national re-

 

cording acts,’ he added.

The concert Saturday evening will
be opened by the Skip Castro Band
from Charlottesville. Castro is a fam-
iliar attraction in Lexington and has
played this area for a number of
years. Two years ago, they were one
of the featured acts at the W&L Mus-
cular Dystrophy Superdance.

The main attraction for the even-
ing will be Thorogood’s group. The
Destroyers released their first album
in 1977 and packed up their instru-
ments in a Chevy Suburban to tour
both coasts that same year.

Since that time, the Destroyers
have been successful with four gold
albums and drew rave reviews on
tour as the opening act for the Rolling
Stones in 1981 and 1982.

Advance ticket sales are far ahead
of those for any previous pavilion
concert, said Haywood, adding that
he is looking for a capacity crowd.
“This will probably be the best show
we've had in the pavilion.”

PAVILIONPOINTERS

* Tickets are on sale for $6.50 now through 4 p.m. Friday at the W&L
Bookstore.

¢ Advance ticket purchases are encouraged so that spectators can
move into the pavilion quickly.

¢ Proper proof of age, as well as proof that you are a W&L student,
will be required at the door.

¢ Guests from outside the W&L community are welcome, but must
be accompanied by a W&L student. (Note: Students from area
women’s colleges are considered members of the W&L community.)

¢ Spectators will be allowed to purchase only three beer tickets with
each admission.

¢ No outside cans or bottles will be permitted to go into the pavilion.
Students who fail to comply with security requests to surrender
alcohol will be removed from the pavilion.

¢ Any spectator deemed ‘‘out of control’’ or obnoxious to other spec-
tators by security will be removed from the pavilion.

Robert Vincent O’Niel’s ‘‘Avenging

“‘Angel’’ left off. Now Angel is a re-
formed hooker and off the streets, go-

off her studies for a while when her
legal guardian, the policeman who
reformed her in the first film, is kill-

The assembly of characters with
which she becomes involved is unus-

Ju’s art, personality similar

 

By BOB STRICKLAND
Staff Reporter

 

While I asked I-Hsiung Ju about his
art, he began a watercolor. His
abrupt, spontaneous technique is
duplicated in his personality: he
throws out a doctrine of Chinese
philosophy as he dashes the color on-
to the paper. Ju’s serious artistic side
is counterbalanced by his quick wit.
By the time he had answered my
question, I was taken by the nature of
his Eastern sensibility and by the
fact that he had already finished the
watercolor that he had only begun as
I asked my question.

Ju’s works are on display until Jan.
25 at the duPont Gallery. A native of
China, Ju left the country for the
Phillipines during the Communist
takeover to continue his studies and
teach art. He comes from a family of
artists and always has been attracted
to the creative culture. Ju has held
numerous one-man shows in Austral-
ia, Canada, England, Japan and the
United States. He currently is the
artist-in-residence and an assistant
professor of art at Washington and
Lee.

In order to appreciate his work,
one must understand Ju’s aesthetic
stance. His approach to art is loaded
with Chinese philosophy that is quite
unlike Western thought. It takes ma-
ny years for a Chinese artist to mas-
ter the art of calligraphy and water-
color painting. But once the artist has
perfected his craft, he is able to
create spontaneous images without
much forethought.

Ju compares his art to that of a
dancer. When one is first learning
how to perform a maneuver, much
thought and attention must must be
spent in perfecting it. Once the mane-
uver is perfected, and the dancer
becomes very good, he does not have
to think about his actions.

Ju says that spontaneity is the key
to his work. After witnessing his
quick style, I certainly was convinc-
ed this is the case. His show is made
up mostly of abstract pieces.

The ideas that give stimulus to his
abstract work come from an inner
feeling, Ju says ‘It just happened.
No plan. Just spontaneous,”’ he add-
ed. Unlike other artists who complete
their art in their minds, Ju does not
finish a piece until the last brush-
stroke is executed. What may start
out as a chrysanthemum painting
may eventually turn into an abstract
piece as testified by the calligraphy
in “Phoenix (1)’’ Ju reforms old
paintings into new ones.

The creative process is always at
work as the product of spontaneity
and the artist’s mood. Ju compares
his technique to the performing arts.
As dancers follow movement, his art
follows a music of the mind. His

brush pauses, jumps, leaps, twists,

laughable, as if director O’Niel simp-
ly said, ‘‘Here are your lines. En-
joy.” In fact, the most confusing
aspect of this picture, playing at the
Lyric, is whether it was meant to be a
comedy with serious overtones, or

 

  

W&L artist-in-residence I-Hsiung Ju has new exhibit in duPont Gallery,

but is never drawn.

In his ‘Noh Dance,”’ Ju’s calligrap-
hy explains his fascination with rhy-
thm and movement “‘I have seen the
Japanese Noh dance in which the
dancer moves his body just like the
writer of Chinese calligraphy moves
his brush in accordance with the ris-
ing and falling of cadence...I there-
fore am interested in making this
kind of painting for it is based on
calligraphy.”

Chinese painting requires perfect
control of the brush; there is no room
for error. Ju’s brushwork has a fasci-
nating disciplined freedom. One can
sense the quick, rhythmic strokes
both in his traditional Chinese pieces
and in his abstract work. The rhythm
is dependent on his mood as the rhy-
thm of music depends on the style,
whether it be jazz or classical. Dark,
disturbing backgrounds testify to
Ju’s mood at the time of creation.
Likewise, a singing bird on paper is a
product of a happy mood.

Most of the works in the current
show are abstract. Ju takes natural
objects and transforms them by his
artistic gift into abstract forms. In
“‘Roots,”’ Ju is not interested in repli-
cating roots in the ground; rather, he
manipulates the sensual forms inher-
ent in nature to make an abstract
piece.

Ju also has a couple of traditional
Chinese landscape works that, as us-
ual, are perfectly executed. He is
quick to point out that a bird or but-
terfly on the canvas may have been
an accident—such as a dropped blob
of paint—that has been transformed
and recreated by the artist. Not only
is Ju’s technique that of a master
craftsman; his artistic sensibility is
equally outstanding. He asserts that
an expert painter with no ideas is like
a beautiful body without a spirit; the
person is virtually reduced to the sta-
tus of a lifeless mannequin. This per-
son can always be an expert painter,
but never an artist. The duPont ex-
hibit, however, gives evidence to an
artist who can combine both body
and spirit in his art to create a beauty
with substance.

simply one of those movies that takes
itself too seriously and becomes fun-
ny asa result.

There were a couple of redeeming
moments in this sequel. Certainly,
the irony of Angel returning to Holly-
wood to avenge her guardian’s death
is an amusing thought to play with,
but the memorable sequence had
Angel working to save a 13-year-old
prostitute from what she herself had
experienced as a teen prostitute.

 

Overall, ‘‘Avenging Angel”’ is not
that good a movie. It seems to reach
for a goal and winds up falling short
of that goal, leaving the audience
laughing at the wrong time. In this
respect, however, ‘“‘Avenging Angel”’
just might attract a following at the
box office.

History Professor Lamar J.R. Cecil Jr., chairman of
the faculty library committee, said the shortened hours
issue is ‘‘just a rumor in the air,” but acknowledged
that there are ‘‘several members of the Library Com-
mittee who want to look at the hours.”’

The cost of maintaining the University Library’s 24-
hour schedule and the possibility of shortening its hours
are being studied by school officials.

University Librarian Maurice D. Leach said this
week that administrators have embarked on a program
to study ‘‘the economics of the University, in order to
see where costs might be cut,”’ and that the library is
one area being studied.

day that “‘there is no decision that’s been made yet”’ on
whether to shorten library hours.

night and 7 a.m. He said there would be no savings on
heating or air conditioning.

Epley declined to specify the personnel savings that
would result from closing overnight. The library is staf-
fed by one person at the circulation desk during those
hours.

Dean of the College John W. Elrod said yesterday that
although the option of closing the library overnight has
been discussed, ‘‘it’s not being taken seriously at all.”’

“Phere’s some thought about that, but it’s a very pre-
liminary thing,’’ he said. ‘“‘We certainly wouldn’t do

Elrod said a change in the library schedule would be
made, “‘if at all,’’ after a new university librarian has
been appointed. Leach announced in October that he
was resigning the librarianship July 1 in order to accept
another University position.

“We're still receiving applications and deciding who

“If one considers the cost of utilities alone, apart
from salaries, then it would make sense to examine the
use made of the library in the after-hours.”’ he said.

Cecil said that if it is found that the University cannot
keep the library operating on its present schedule, the
hours would likely be changed so that the library would
be open from 8 a.m. to midnight.

“It seems to me to be very reasonable, as other libra-
ries operate on the same principle,’’ he said.

Leach said that the new library, which opened in 1979,
was designed on the principle that it would be open
around the clock. He said that schedule was modeled on
the policies of the Law School and Commerce School li-
braries, both of which are open 24 hours a day.

According to hourly records kept by the library, 8,400
people entered the library between midnight and 8 a.m.

Some winter math: Zero minus 12 is

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

How cold was it?

eThe mercury in the geology department’s
thermometer dropped off the temperature
scale.

eIn addition to the usual problems such as
cracked radiators and weak batteries faced
by car owners, the brakes froze on one stu-
dent’s car.

eA West Virginia ski resort closed its slopes
because it was tee cold.

eThe outdoor swearing-in. cereimony for
President Ronald Reagan and the parade
down Pennsylvania Avenue weren't the only
events canceled because of Monday's weath-
er — Lexington’s Stonewall Jackson birthday
celebration also succumbed to the cold.

The Arctic air mass that sent temperatures
plummeting throughout the Eastern half of
the nation earlier this week and the problems
that accompanied it did not spare Lexington

The temperature Saturday at midnight was
30 degrees, according to the geology depart-
ment’s thermometer. From there, the tem-
perature kept dropping as a cold air mass
moved through town

Within 24 hours, the temperature had dip-
ped to a frosty 8 degrees below zero. The low
temperature of the week was recorded at 5
a.m. Monday — 12 degrees below zero.

“Actually, it was approximately minus-12,
because it ran off the scale,’’ said Bob Thren,
technical assistant in the geology depart-
ment,

The scale only goes to 10 degrees above
zero, and below that, Thren said, ‘‘I did a lot
of interpolation.”

With winds approaching 20 miles an hour,
the wind chill temperature was about 50 de-
grees below zero for Sunday night and much
of Monday.

“It's the coldest we've had since we've been
running this machine (about four years),”’
said Thren, who added that the temperature
at his home in Collierstown registered 18 de-
grees below zero.

‘It doesn’t do this too often,’’ he said.

James L. Arthur, superintendent of build-
ings and grounds, said, ‘‘It’s the coldest that I
can ever remember, and I’ve lived here all
my life.”

University proctor Charles F. ‘‘Murph’’
Murray agreed with Arthur’s assessment of
the cold. ‘I'd say it’s one of the coldest spells
we've had for a long, long time,”’ he said.

Although Lexington was spared the Super
Bowl Sunday winter storm that blanketed
other parts of the state with up to 6 inches of
snow, the cold temperatures alone were
enough to cause the usual problems.

Arthur said buildings and grounds fixed
several burst pipes this week but that, in gen-
eral, ‘‘we got by pretty well.’’

On campus, a radiator in Howe Hall and a
cold water line leading to the ROTC building
that froze and burst were among the pro-
blems. Two fraternities, Lambda Chi Alpha
and Kappa Sigma, and the Lampost also had
frozen pipes.

Buildings and grounds staff members had
to work some overtime hours Monday night,
Arthur said.

To prevent frozen pipes, Arthur
recommended that students ensure that
broken window panes and holes in walls have
been repaired and that no vents are open un-
derneath their house. Leaving water running
also will help, Arthur said.

For one of the first times, the heating plant
had to use the second of its two 500-horsepow-
er boilers Monday, Arthur said. That means
about 25,000 pounds of steam were being pro-
duced each hour. By Tuesday, though, the

- insane cl aca ummamana nRR eo rma Ua Ai a needa ren eRe ee aera aaa

FREEZING!!!

heating plant was back to using only the one
boiler.

Jim Southers, of Auto Towing and Repair
on U.S. 60 west of Lexington, said his compa-
ny helped about 50 motorists Sunday, Monday
and Tuesday. More than 25 of those were
Washington and Lee students, Southers esti-
mated.

The most common problem, Southers said,
was cars that simply wouldn’t start because
of a weak battery, thick oil or ice in the gas
line.

In order to prevent car troubles during cold
weather, Southers suggested that motorists
place a blanket or a piece of plastic over their
engines (only when the engines are cool).
When trying to start a cold car, pump the ac-
celerator once and then hold it all the way to
the floor, he said.

To prevent frostbite and other cold-weather
health problems, students should wear a lot of
warm clothing, especially a scarf or some-
thing around portions of their faces, and mini-
mize their time outside, according to Brenda
Jackson, medical secretary in the infirmary.

No W&L students went to the infirmary
with weather-related problems this week,
said Jackson, adding, ‘‘Just be practical and
take good care of yourself.”’

Nice idea

“During the summer of 1984 an inventory of all books housed
in the open stacks was taken. Twelve hundred volumes were miss-
ing for the four years following the 1980 inventory. Until the
move into the new library, an average of 1,000 volumes was lost
annually. We believe this dramatic decline in lossage occurred
because of the 24-hour access to the collections. There is no
doubt that student tensions in using the library have been lessen-
ed by the 24-hour open-door policy. It is the single most popular
library service with the student body.”

Annual Report: 1983-84
The University Library

The revelation this week that the University, in studying
ways to decrease operating costs, is considering the possible
cessation of 24-hour library service is as unreasonable as it is
surprising. Not only is the consideration of such an idea
dangerous, but it could be suicidal.

To understand best the ludicrousness of such an idea, one
must go back six years to the planning of the new University
Library. At that time, the Board of Trustees called upon
University Librarian Maurice D. Leach Jr., to present them
with a tentative design for a library he felt would adequately
meet the standards and growth needs of the University.
Operating expenses — the costs of lighting, heating and staff-
ing the library — he was told, were not to be his concern.
They wanted the best building for the time, and that they got.
Although no extravagances or opulent ‘‘extras’’ were added,
the library was — as it continues to be — perhaps the pre-
miere facility for a school this size.

The University Library remains distinct for several rea-
sons. According to Leach, Washington and Lee has the only
library open 24 hours a day for student use during the aca-
demic session in the eastern United States.

A selected statistical study in the Annual Report of the
University Library showed that Washington and Lee has the
lowest expenditure per student per open hour among such
schools as Amherst, Davidson and Smith. Prospective stu-
dents and parents, according to Leach, repeatedly remark
how impressed they are with the library’s 24-hour policy. As
Leach noted, ‘‘The University Library is a mirror of the cam-
pus. Its dynamics are an active and accurate reflection of the
academic programs on campus.”’

For Washington and Lee, however, the library remains
unique and important for other reasons as well. Other than
the Cockpit and the Co-op, it remains the only meeting place
for all students on campus. Not only is it the lifeblood of
recorded information to the campus and community, but it
serves as the heart of the University.

But as much as it may be appealing to save nearly $30,000 a
year by closing the library between midnight and 8 a.m., the
costs accrued in the long run will be far more expensive.

Consider, perhaps, the strain such action places on the .

Honor System. Closing the-library-at night will:mean that
students, believing their work unfinished, may be tempted to
pack up the books (without checking them out) and, illegally
(or would it be ‘‘dishonorably’’?), take them home. That
places an undue tension upon the Honor System. Even the li-
brary’s annual report noted that the extraordinarily low theft
rate is directly attributable to the open nature of the library.
The Honor System, therefore, is reinforced by an open
library, and not unduly tested. At this school, which prides
itself on a heritage of honor and mutual trust, placing such a
temptation before students creates an unnecessary test for
the System.

Also to be considered is the splintering effect such a move
might have on the esprit de corps of the student body. The
library remains a center of student life, more so than any
other institution associated with the University. It is the only
place where the overwhelming majority of students may
gather for a common intellectual pursuit. It contributes to
the University an academic unity not found elsewhere. And
don’t forget the long-term dream of one University official to
gather students together nearer the campus. Would ceasing
to offer 24-hour library service further such an end?

If the concern by University officials is cost, then why,
when designing the building, were the planners told to forget
about operating costs? If the concern is for lighting and
heating expensee, then be sure to turn off lights and heat
everywhere on campus. The Colonnade would look very pret-
ty illuminated only by the stars at night.

Weighing the costs and benefits, we’re hard-pressed to fig-
ure why, then, the University is even considering such a
move. It certainly seems as though the costs of operating the
library are nominal for the benefits it offers. Closing the
library at night would place a greater stress on the student
body to circumvent the Honor System when necessary. Addi-
tionally, posting hours on the front doors would take away yet
another tradition from the Univeristy, a tradition that, unlike
some that have recently passed by the boards (the Board?),

- impresses and attracts far more students than it repels.

Closing the library at night would be foolish, dangerous and

self-destructive. It should not be done. It should not even be

‘ considered. — By Nelson Patterson

Everybody has known the warm
fuzziness of being inside looking out
on these piercing winter days... or
have they?

President Reagan’s encore in-
augural address Monday rang hollow
through the Capitol before an elite
audience of 1,200 citizens, as
teenagers and some adults — 10,578
of them — could not parade and
138,800 invited guests could not at-
tend. About 500 protesters against
apartheid and other inequities untar-
nished by Reagan initiatives strode
the blast nonetheless, undaunted by a
wind chill index of minus 25.

No message greeted these citizens,
but the Oval Office hotline reached
out to 71,500 anti-abortion demon-
strators the next day.

Tuesday also revealed the perplex-
ing- ‘borrowed minks” caper, as we
discovered that the fur-laden
revéfers at the Convention Center
were finally at a loss to distinguish
mink from mink before stumbling in-
to the cold late air. Apparently some
coats were ‘“‘borrowed” by non-
owners unable or unwilling to find
tarry or brave the cold city. ‘“‘Who
a left holding no mink?” we might
ask.

The yuppies and young civil ser-

 

vants ages 18 to 30 were only too hap-
py to hold the presidential hand at the
Young Americans Ball, which was
the first of nine inaugural fetes, bear-
ing price tags from $50 to $125. Per-
haps such expensive partying is due,
as the Commerce Department re-
ported yesterday that Reagan’s
fourth year brought the highest gross
national product since 1951 and the
lowest inflation since 1967.

If our elected officials and their ap-
pointees are indeed watching out for
our future (read nukes and deficits),
we should all be as grateful as the
young Reaganites of November.

But do we all deserve this care?
Are we worth the ‘‘hard decisions”
our chief warns will surely come?

Who is it that writes ‘I hate nig-
gers’’ and ‘‘nuke commies’’ on the
bathroom walls of this campus? Who
leaves the trash other men must
gather every morning in the library,
or after parties on frat-lined streets?

We have the chilliest palms of all if
we are they: if we think ‘‘Washington
and Lee made Lexington what it is
and to hell with townies.”’

And ‘‘to hell with Hollie Collies and
Sweetbush babes,”’ I’ve heard. I’ve
heard tales of marginal sexual
assault and actionable rape, of foul
abuse of women and the colleges they
attend, of things that would turn even
the steadiest hand to violence.

Do not think for a moment that this
activity leaves any Calyx photo un-
stained. If not my face with my
name, then those of my friends, or
their friends’ friends. And all the
honors in the world, all the disserta-
tions and good works on earth... can-
not wash away such stains.

Disgrace knows no politics; it
needs no labels save America and
Washington and Lee University. The
malfeasance of one distorts the im-
age of all.

Even as the faculty and admissions
office. strain to court female
members, their steps are scuffed
over by the minority of men who are"
not gentlemen. Certainly these are a
fraction of the shoes upon the Colon-
nade, but even one is one too many
for a school so dependent on the
tradition of gentle words and strong
values. And if not for our self-esteem,
then for our future sensibilities we
must guard the unwritten corollaries
of the Honor Code outside our chry-
salis campus.

“My friends,” said the President,
“we live in a world that’s lit by
lightning. So much is changing and
will change, but so much endures and
transcends time...we see and hear
the echoes of our past.

“It is the American sound: it is
hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic —
daring, decent and fair.”’

Such are our leader’s expectations
from us — that we should be gentle-
men and nothing less. Those who are
know it not by the absence of an Ex-
ecutive Committee summons, but by
an inner fire. It warms them as they
gaze through frost, considering the
cold, cruel future. Others have not
yet learned that the most comforting
warmth cannot be bought, and have
not yet learned to be outside looking
in.

Both have known the same frustra-
tion in the streets, or shops, or party
spots... and wondered why cold
shoulders turn.

Hazing more than ‘harmless’

MY
VIEW

 

By Scott

Stockburger

Congratulations to the editors and
staff of The Ring-tum Phi for their
front-page article on hazing! (Jan.
17, 1985) This sensitive issue has long
been taboo to students and adminis-
trators. It is high time that the pro-
blem of hazing be brought out for dis-
cussion and debate. I would now like
to address some of the statements
made to The Phi in its article.

First, to the administrators and
students who aren’t ‘‘sure”’ or ‘don’t
know enough’’ about this hazing: I do
know. I am sure. Hazing is a serious
problem at W&L, and the pledge edu-
cation programs at many fraternities
leave much to be desired. Many stu-
dents persist in denying any know-
ledge of hazing. Since no W&L gentle-
men would consciously lie, it is ob-
vious to me that we have a lot of very
naive students on our campus. Per-
haps it is time for those students to be

“enlightened.”’

Bob Tomaso, the head dormitory
counselor, said, ‘Every fraternity
hazes to a certain extent.’’ At least
one fraternity with a chapter at W&L
was founded at VMI in 1869 in opposi-
tion to hazing. And though the pledge
eduation program at that chapter, as
in all chapters, may be far from per-
fect, the brothers make a valiant and
worthy effort to make sure the
pledges are not subjected to anything
that might even be misconstrued as
hazing. I believe there are other fra-
ternities here that make similar ef-
forts.

There are many fraternities at
W&L that conduct a scavenger hunt
for its pledges. Many national head-
quarters have not been very jubilant
about this. But all fraternities need
not require their pledges to bring
back ‘‘souvenirs’’ such as McDon-
ald’s flags or American flags from
the Washington Monument or high-
way signs listing the mileage to
womens’ colleges. Many students
may not consider this to be hazing,

  

but the Commonwealth of Virginia

.considers it to be a crime. Many

would not consider these incidents to
be honor violations, but if there is no
honor off campus, then there is no
honor on campus.

Tomaso and IFC President David
Perdue said hazing has been reduced
in recent years, but that does not
mean it is at an acceptable level.

There may not be an acceptable level
of hazing, but I do not agree with Per-
due’s assertion that hazing can be
made “entirely non-existent” in a
few years. Hazing is something that
doesn’t go away. It lurks in every fra-
ternity house basement waiting for
opportunity (strengthened and glori-
fied by the alumni and their tales of
cruel and unusual acts).

Many will agree with Perdue that
there is no really dangerous hazing at
W&L. There were two cadets at Tex-
as A&M who didn’t think it was dan-
gerous to make a freshman do push-
ups. They thought differently after
they were arrested and charged with
his death. I vividly remember hear-
ing the pain in the voice of one frater-
nity member from a western univer-
sity as he told me of the death of one
of their pledges in a hazing incident.
Anyone who thinks. ‘It won’t happen
to me,” is just fooling himself.

harmless fun. That’s how they re-
member it, anyway. Students defend
member it, anyway. Students defend
hazing as necessary for building
pledge unity. Some pledges unite
around community service and house
improvement projects. It takes much
more organization and cooperation
among pledges to build a wet bar
than it does to kill a case of Jack
Daniel’s, and the results benefit the
entire house. In a conversation with
Eileen Stevens, the founder of the
anti-hazing organization C.H.U.C.K.
(inspired by the death of her son dur-
ing hazing), she said it best: ‘‘Hazing
is a copout.” It simply takes a lot
more effort to come up with a pledge
program that doesn’t degrade the
pledge and still unifies the pledge
class. The idea of enduring a com-
mon hell is to become really tight as
a group. I have heard pledges from
several fraternities use this excuse.

In the case of a pledge, I believe it is

more of an excuse not to tell a dormi-
tory counselor or dean. I believe that
most freshmen would rather not take
it, but they are afraid of their pledge
brothers and upperclassmen. Upper-
classmen are also fond of using the
excuse that they deserve to have
some ‘“‘fun” since they had to go
through it.

A lot of students, alumni and pos-
sibly even some members of the fac-
ulty and administration will be upset
by such accusations but that’s my
whole idea. Many students may not
believe it, but it is in their best inter-
ests to abolish any and all hazing that
exists at W&L. The Commonwealth
of Virginia has one of the oldest stat-
utes against hazing. Many types of
hazing are felonies in Virginia. If
prison and fines don’t scare you,
think about a multimillion dollar law-
suit against your university and/or
fraternity by the family of a pledge
who dies or is seriously injured. Pre-
serving ‘‘tradition’” could become
very expensive, in more ‘ways than
one.

Amherst College and Colby College
just lost their Greek system, thanks
in large part to hazing. The Ameri-
can International College in Spring-
field, Mass., just abolished fraterniti-
ties after a pledge died last year
while being hazed. Stanford Univer-
sity is considering abolishing frater-
nities. “‘Hazing...and alcohol abuse
are the two greatest threats to
Greeks,’’ Stevens said.

I do not intend to get anyone in
trouble. I do hope that The Phi will
become a forum for some serious dis-
cussion and debate on a very serious
issue. Eileen Stevens told me, ‘‘It of-
ten takes a tragedy or a very serious
incident to bring about change, but
by then it’s too late.’’ It’s not too late
for W&L’s fraternities. But if we
don’t change the system ourselves,
the Board of Trustees may decide on
more drastic changes than we would
ever impose ourselves.

MY VIEW .

This week marks the 13th anniver- ~
sary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark ,
Supreme Court decision that, in ef-
fect, legalized abortion. And how +
could we forget? From “‘liberal”’ out-
cries praising the decision to “‘con-
servative’’ Right-to-Life demonstra- ~
tions and bombings of abortion clin-
ics by extremists, that decision still
looms above our heads as a volatile *
and highly emotional issue. =

The act of abortion, though a sick-
ness in itself, is not the major malady *’
confronting American society today. .
Rather, it is a symptom — a symp-
tom of a disease that has already ~
made us lose our vision of the long-
clung-to American dream, and is
even threatening our nation’s future
by corroding its very foundation and ?
backbone. eG

America has bred an immature so- .
ciety, one in which the key is evasion
of responsibility. As a result, we have
lost our vision of the American »
Dream. ;

We no longer endure; we seek the
most convenient and least painful es-
cape from any situation, regardless _
of principles or consequences. :

The days of the Great American
Frontier once instilled pride in the
hearts of true-blue Americans. Men,
heeding advice to ‘‘Go West,” left for ¥
the wild, unconquered west, inspired
by visions of prosperity and wealth,
while realizing that hard work, sore «
muscles and calloused hands awaited
them. But the hardships were well ”
worth it when the fruits of labor were .
reaped. It is enough to send red,
white and blue shivers up your spine. *

But Americans no longer seek this .
Dream. The individual ideal has been _
replaced by that of the collective. It *
is no longer ‘‘What can I do for socie-
ty and myself?’’ but rather, ‘“‘What
can society do for me?”

The American welfare system re-
flects our society’s degeneration
since the Néw Deal. While it can be
argued that social welfare was neces-
sary at the time, the continuance of
the system has polarized the Ameri-
can mindset into the current belief .
that the government somehow owes
one something, "

The widespread fraud within the
system simply shows the increased _
disregard for the American work eth- ~
ic. Too high of a number of Ameri- ,
cans (and a still increasing number)
are seeking the easy way out — why
work when we can defraud the gov- |
ernment into providing our every
need?

But abortion remains the most bla-
tant manifestation of this depravity. |
Abortion denies the sanctity of the —
very institution we cling to desper-
ately as our own dearest right and
liberty.

We have come to accept that we -
are no longer responsible for our act-
ions; that moral standards have been
lost behind the guises of choices,
freedom and liberty.

Since we do not have to come face —
to face with an aborted child or ac-
cept responsibility for the conse-
quences of our actions, it is easy to
dismiss its rights to those same liber-
ties we claim as our own.

Rhetoric is available abundantly to
defend the pro-abortion stance. One
argument that I absolutely reject is
that the “‘object’’ killed and dismem-
bered is just a fetus, not a living
child.

I’m sorry, but when my wife some-
day becomes pregnant, I am going to
be very excited about my child that
she is carrying, not my fetus.

I consider myself pro-choice. I feel
that the choice should be made,
though, at the time the decision is
made to engage in the activity that
leads to the eventual problem. If the
decision is made to proceed, and
without precautionary measures,
then one should be prepared to ac-
cept the consequences of the actions,
as well.

The convenient way is not neces-
sarily the best way; too often, in fact,
it is blatantly the wrong way. But as
a society, Americans are too imma-
ture to accept that.

Americans must again learn that
responsibilities must be borne, that
evasion is an invitation to failure and
that the American Dream is not
dead. Unless we grow up, we are on
the road to destruction.

According to a survey of 400 big
businesses that the council published
in October, hiring of college
graduates should be up 8 percent this
spring — an 11 percent rise for
engineering graduates and a 4 per-
cent rise for business-related
graduates.

The survey’s “other” category
—non-technical liberal arts
graduates — showed an expected
drop of 1 percent. But that result
might be skewed, Kayser said,
because the council did not survey
small businesses, which normally
hire large numbers of liberal arts
graduates.

Today’s competitive job market re-
quires that students employ creative,
innovative techniques in their job
searches, in addition to the more con-
ventional, tried-and-true techniques.

That’s the view of administration
Professor Roger A. Dean, an expert
on organizational behavior whose
views on career development were
featured last summer in a Forbes
magazine article.

One of the first steps in looking for
a job, Dean said during an interview
this week, is to evaluate yourself.
The student should think about his
own individual personality and ambi-
tions. Among things to consider are
whether he is comfortable in a ‘‘stab-
in-the-back’’ environment or in one
that relies heavily on interpersonal
relationships. In addition, during his
interview, the applicant should ask
questions about the firm’s day-to-day
environment.

The big firms are looking for a

but Kayser said the economy is back
in full swing.

“The leveling off we experienced in
the fall has turned out to be just a
leveling off,’’ she said, so businesses
shouldn't be affected by it.

Nick Markham, employment man-
ager for Leggett’s Department
Stores Inc., said he does not expect a
decline in management hiring this
year for his company.

“It really depends on what we do in
terms of new store openings,’ Mark-
ham said. He added that he expects
one or two new stores to open this
year.

“The best we can tell is yes, it
seems like it will be a good employ-
ment year,’’ he said.

Joyce C. Perl, the director of ex-
ecutive placement for Hecht’s De-
partment Stores Inc., said she ex-
pects another strong hiring year be-
cause she expects another strong
business year.

‘We have been pretty. consistent

  

PROFESSOR ROGER DEAN
Warns against ‘‘reality shock”’

varied range of qualities in potential
employees, Dean said. Many firms
rely somewhat on the technical
abilities of an applicant, such as his
grade point average and the type of
accounting program he graduated
from.

On the other hand, Dean mentioned
a national managing partner who
pointed out, ‘‘What we look for are

because we are growing and expand-
ing,”’ Perl said. ‘‘We’ve got a five-
year plan, with five stores opening
—an average of one a year.”’

Hecht’s hires about 60 people from
college each year and recruits those
Students from 10 colleges, one of
which is W&L, Perl said. Last year,
Hecht’s hired 11 W&L graduates for
management positions.

Perl was in Lexington this week in-
terviewing prospective employees
through the placement program run
by Associate Dean of Students Mich-
ael A. Cappeto.

The program draws potential em-
ployers to Lexington to hold job-hunt-
ing workshops and to interview stu-
dents. Cappeto helps students define
their career goals and sets them on
the job-hunting path.

Some of the advice Cappeto gives is
to go further than just sending out
resumes and hoping to get inter-
views. Instead, he tells students to go
on “informational interviews.’’ In

rich, preppy kids who've got a good
education,”’ noting their social skills
as well as family contacts that could
be beneficial to the firm.

Knowing what a big firm is looking
for, the question ‘‘What turns the big
firm on?”’ arises. In many cases it is
appearance.

Dean said that studies have shown
that during campus interviews, in the
first 30 seconds, the interviewer
decides whether or not he likes the
applicant, and the first four minutes
determine whether the applicant is to
be granted a second interview.

“About the only thing (the inter-
viewer) learned in that short period
of time,’’ Dean said, ‘tis how you
dressed, how you shook hands — did
you look nice?”’

What, then, turns an interviewer
off? Things such as dressing im-
properly, portraying overconfidence
and having few or no questions for
the interviewer can count against an
applicant. ‘“‘One negative will
outweigh a_ thousand positives,”’
Dean said.

Something that all accounting firm

these, students can meet not neces-
sarily prospective employers, but
people in their chosen field and learn
what the field is like and what job
openings are available

This approach is more successful
than one might expect, Cappeto said,
because 80 percent of all available
positions are not advertised, but are
filled by word of mouth.

Cappeto said he isn’t sure what this
year’s job market is going to be like.

“It’s too early in the season to say
if it’s a good or a bad year out there,”
he said.

Last year the job market was good
to W&L students, Cappeto said. Out
of last year’s graduating class, only
two students who were actively look-
ing for jobs had not been hired by
September, according to a survey he
conducted.

“I don’t have any reason to think
this year will be any different, but I
can’t be sure.”’

‘Reality shock’: Dean gives inside tips

applicants must remember, Dean
said, is that while the applicant is try-
ing to look good, the firm also is try-
ing to present a good image. These
firms are businesses competing with
each other to hire the best personnel.
This sometimes leads to a firm’s giv-
ing special treatment to an applicant
to woo him into accepting an offer on-
ly later to treat him in the same man-
ner as the other hirees on the same
level.

This sudden change from expecta-
tion to reality is termed by Dean as
“reality shock.”’

A common “reality shock”’ scenar-
io is one in which the applicant is
flown in by special jet and put up in
the best hotel during his interview so
that he believes the typical accoun-
tant, once hired, lives this way.

How can a person avoid ‘“‘reality
shock’’? Ask questions, Dean said.
Ask the employees hired two or three
years ago how they feel about their
progress and future. Ask the in-
terviewer, ‘“‘Where will I be in two
years?” And then ask yourself, ‘‘Is
this situation right with me?”’

last school year.

The library's 1983-84 annual report
Stated that an inventory last summer
found that 1,200 books had been lost
since the last inventory in 1980,
whereas an average of 1,000 volumes
a year were missing before the move
to the new library in 1979.

“We believe this dramatic decline
in lossage occurred because of the
twenty-four hour access to the collec-
tions,’’ the report stated. ‘‘There is
no doubt that student tensions in us-
ing the library have been lessened by
the 24-hour open-door policy.’’

“It is the single most popular libra-
ry service with the student body,”
the report says. That sentence is un-
derlined.

At Tuesday’s EC meeting, junior
representative Patrick Hayden said
Cecil had asked one of his classes for

student opinion on closing the library
at night ‘‘before he expressed an opi-
nion of his own.”

Hayden said he was ‘“‘under the im-
pression” that University President
John D. Wilson had recommended
looking into closing the library from 1
a.m. to 8 a.m. because it would save
$24,000.

Hayden said Wilson had told him
“not to get up in arms about this’’
—that the committee was just going
to look into it.

EC Secretary Sam Dalton recom-
mended that the EC not put the dis-
cussion in the minutes as it might im-
ply the committee was accusing Wil-
son of something that ‘‘could be pure-
ly speculation or rumor.”

After some discussion, it was de-
cided that because the issue had been
discussed and is of student concern,
it should be included in the minutes.

Cecil said he ‘‘would like to have
students participate”’ in the study of
library hours.

Coming up: 30 super hours

The 1985 Muscular Dystrophy Su-
perdance, scheduled to begin Friday,
Feb. 1, ‘‘is shaping up to be the most
exciting and most successful ever,”’
according to chairman Chris Wil-
liams.

The event begins in the student act-
ivities pavilion Friday at 8 p.m. with
the band Dirty Secrets, followed by
the Voltage Brothers. On Saturday
night, the Waller Family will open
and the Cruis-o-matics will close the
dance at 2 a.m. Sunday.

Tickets for the weekend cost $6 and
may be purchased in advance.

The steering committee has set a
goal of raising $30,000 and hopes to
attract more than 200 dancers.

“The fraternities have been a great
help this year, especially in urging

their pledge classes to dance,’’ said
Williams, noting that five or six fra-
ternities are requiring their pledges
todance.

The steering committee has also
been recruiting dancers from area
women’s colleges and at James Mad-
ison University and Radford Univ-
ersity. Virginia Military Institute
also will have participants.

In the last two weeks, the commit-
tee has conducted ‘‘slave auctions”’
at Mary Baldwin College and Hollins
College by raffling off Washington
and Lee flesh. $1,500 was raised.

During the 30-hour Superdance,
Ring-tum Phi sports editor Mike Sta-
chura and photography editor Cotton
Puryear will stage a radio marathon
on WLUR-FM (91.5 FM).

Trustees approve freshman housing plan

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees last
weekend adopted the recommenda-
tion of the Coeducation Steering
Committee regarding the ‘most
practical and most reasonable’
freshman housing plan for 1985-86,
according to the committee’s chair-
woman.

Next year, women in the freshman
class will be housed on the second
and third floors of Davis Dormitory,
on the second floor of Gilliam Dor-
mitory and on the south wing of Gil-

liam’s third floor.
Women also will be housed in the

archway section of Graham-Lees
Dormitory, which will be sealed off
from the east and west wings so that
they are guaranteed ‘“‘security, pri-
vacy and controlled access,” accord-
ing to the report.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson said that the
third draft of the report was com-
pleted by the subcommittee known as
Immediate Renovations, chaired by
H. Robert Huntley, dean of freshmen.

“In arriving at its recommenda-
tion,’ the report states, ‘“‘the Com-
mittee was guided by three major
concerns: security, successful as-
similation of women, and privacy.”

Simpson, who heads the coeduca-
tion committee, said the recommen-

Huntley gets warm reception on a cold day

When he stepped down as
Washington and Lee president two
years ago, Robert E.R. Huntley re-
called Monday, he said he would re-
turn to W&L to speak again only on a
“cold day in paradise.”

That’s exactly the kind of weather
that greeted Huntley, now an execu-
tive with Best Products Co. Inc., in
Richmond, when he addressed the
114th annual Founders’ Day Convo-
cation in Lee Chapel, as tempera-
tures dipped way below the freezing
mark.

Huntley said that Founders’ Day
was the perfect time to reminisce
about the rich history of the Universi-
ty, and his speech was filled with vig-
nettes from the pages of W&L his-
tory.

The cold weather that greeted
Huntley probably also took away
from the size of the crowd that heard
his speech, according to Frank A.
Parsons, executive assistant to the
president.

Even so, Parsons said he was
pleased with the size of the crowd this
year. Huntley received a standing

ovation.
The ceremonies this year were

moved from Evans Dining Hall to
Lee Chapel, giving the appearance of
a “packed house,” Parsons said.

This year’s crowd was larger than
last year’s, though, said Parsons,
who attributed the increase to better
publicity and more interest on the
part of students in the traditions
behind Washington and Lee.

After Huntley’s speech,

the
Washington and Lee chapter of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, a national leader-
ship fraternity, initiated 28 W&L stu-
dents as well as two alumni and two

dation also was based on “the over-
riding considerations that were most
practical and most reasonable.”

University officials are planning
for a freshman class of about 400, be-
tween 80 and 100 of which will be wo-
men.

One of the first suggestions for
housing women, according to Simp-
son, was to turn Gilliam into a female
dormitory. However, several pro-
blems accompanied this suggestion.

With an increase of 30 in the fresh-
man class, ‘‘doubling up” of some
single rooms will be necessary to
accommodate the students.

“Turning Gilliam into a women’s
dorm exclusively would mean that
men in the other two dorms will have
to bear the entire burden of the con-
version of extant singles into double
rooms to come up with the requisite
thirty beds for the larger freshman
class [since] Gilliam singles are, by
far, the smallest singles,” the report
states.

In addition, the Admissions Office
reports that parents of visiting appli-
cants have expressed their approval
of male ‘buffer zones” in dormitor-
ies where their daughters will be
housed.

Housing men on the ground and
first floors of the dormitories will
limit ‘‘peeping tom and other type
activity,”’ University President John
D. Wilson said.

friends of the University.

The two alumni initiates were An-
drew S. Baur, a 1937 graduate and an
industrial real estate developer in St.
Louis; and Evan J. Kemp Jr., a 1959
graduate and executive director of
the Disability Rights Center.

The friends of the University ini-
tiated were David T. Johnson, an in-
surance executive in Pensacola,
Fla., and G. Otis Mead, a Lexington
real estate developer.

Of the 28 W&L students initiated,
six were from the W&L Law School,

‘Anything that has Lee’s name is sacred’

of Lexington or county of Rockbridge without having a
relationship with the two colleges.”

Mead said he handles the rentals for a substantial
number of W&L students, and that he misses the daily
contact he had with students before his firm, Mead
Associates, became so large.

“Lexington, Virginia, has been a college town since
before the town was even chartered,”’ he said. ‘‘The two
schools and the town have grown together.

“If you're going to live in Lexington, it’s a foregone
conclusion that you’re going to live in a college town.
Colleges have students. Students are 18-to 22-year-old
people (Notice I said ‘people.’) They are in general go-
ing to act like 18-to 22-year-old-people do,’’ Mead con-

One of the four honorary members initiated into
Omicron Delta Kappa on Monday was unable to attend
the ceremony. His wife graciously stood in for him
when he was recognized during Founders’ Day in Lee

Chapel.

Lexington real estate developer G. Otis Mead Ill was
not in town Monday morning because of.<a project
that he says has consumed 98 percent of his time for the
last year— the effort to locate the proposed Virginia
Horse Center (known in stuffier terms as the ‘Virginia
Equine Center’’) in Rockbridge County.

Mead testified Monday before the state senate’s
agriculture committee shortly before it cast a crucial
vote in the lengthy process of finalizing the center’s

location.

Mead, who chairs the local committee working to
bring the horse center here, says he has to monitor
every move of the state legislature as his project nears
victory (‘‘I’m like an expectant father’), and Monday
was one of the days his presence was required at the
General Assembly, ‘‘as much as I wanted to be here and
as honored and as humbled as I was’’ by the ODK recog-

nition.

“T’ve always been very sensitive to the obvious im-
portance of the universities to the community and vice
versa,”’ he said. ‘‘W&L and VMI are our industries, if
you will. It’s awfully hard to be a part of the whole city

Each of the women’s halls will be
restricted by a locked door, accord-
ing to the report.

“You've got to do it,’’ Simpson
said. ‘‘It’s for security.”

‘Women are more sensitive to a
sense of security,’’ she added.
“That’s the way society perceives
people.”’

One other concern of the commit-
tee was for the ‘‘successful assimila-
tion of women into the undergraduate
college.”

Besides relying on the judgments
of other universities that housing
men and women separately creates a
sense of estrangement, the commit-
tee also used the results of psycholo-
gical studies, such as one conducted
by Stoney Brook.

The Stoney Brook study suggests
that friendships among freshmen are
more likely to develop between resi-
dents either on the same hall or on
those immediately above or below.
Dating, however, occurs less fre-
quently between residents of the
same dormitory than between those
of different dormitories.

A questionnaire sent to Early Deci-
sion candidates showed that 11 per-
cent of the females and 57 percent of
the males preferred single-sex
dorms.

Also 83 percent of the females and
43 percent of the males indicated that
they preferred coed housing.

16 were from the senior class and six
were from the junior class.

The third-year law students were
Richard B. Earles, Charles F. Mar-

A group of four student leaders
Tuesday proposed that the Interfra-
ternity Council compromise on the
sweeping recommendations of last
year’s Ad Hoc Committee on Frater-
nity Affairs.

The committee, chaired by English
professor John M. Evans, presented
its 1ll-page report to University
President John D. Wilson in March
after five months of work.

The compromise presented Tues-
day lists specific concessions to be
made by the fraternities and by the
Student Affairs Committee, a stu-
dent-faculty committee that ‘“‘has
complete authority for all non-curri-
cular matters affecting student life
at the University.”

The compromise was worked out
by four Executive Committee mem-
bers—vice president James White,
secretary Sam Dalton, and sopho-
more representatives Andrew Caru-
thers and Shayam Menon. But all
emphasized that they were appear-
ing as fraternity members and not in
their official capacity.

“Realistically, there have been
some problems with the fraterni-
ties,” White said. ‘‘These rules are a
middle ground.”’

“Hopefully if the fraternity system
stays together as an entity rather
than working as individual houses,
wecan be heard,” Caruthers said.

At least one resident of the
neighborhood near the proposed site
for the new dormitory has expressed
concern about the impact of the
structure.

David B. Dickens, an associate
professor of German at Washington
and Lee who lives across Nelson
Street from the proposed dormitory,
said either he or his wife was plan-
ning to attend today’s Lexington
Planning Commission hearing on the
proposal.

W&L has asked the city to rezone
the area between Lee, Nelson and
Washington streets to allow construc-
tion of the dormitory.

Dickens said that at this point he
and his wife ‘‘are concerned’’ about
some of the effects a new dormitory
would have on the area.

“A new dormitory is certainly go-
ing to add noise. Particularly on the
weekends it can be objectionable,”
Dickens said.

Dickens also cited the possibility of
additional] litter from students in the
new dormitory, an increase in the
already heavy traffic on Nelson
Street and the loss of privacy as

new dormitory.

None of his neighbors has discuss-
ed any concerns regarding a new dor-
mitory with him, and there seems to
be ‘‘no concerted effort’”’ by anyone
in. the neighborhood to oppose the
dormitory, Dickens said.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
University President John D. Wilson,
said he has received some calls from
people asking about the kind of
buildings the University would erect
in the rezoned area. Parsons said he
assured the callers that any buildings
put up would be of a nature similar to
existing dormitories.

Many other college towns have in-
stitutional zones that give univer-
sities flexibility to expand, but in
Lexington people have not believed
that an institutional zone was
necessary, Parsons said, As a result,
Parsons said, when the University

built the Woods Creek Apartments, it
was probably in violation of the zon-
ing ordinances, although the Univer-
sity was granted a building permit.

This time, when the University re-
quested a building permit for a dor-
mitory, it was told that it would be il-
legal to build a dormitory unless the
zoning law were changed, Parsons
explained.

ternities and the Hill,’ he continued.
“It’s a two-way street, however.”

Under ‘‘major concessions” for the
fraternities, the presentation stated
that four house officers should be re-
quired to live in the house and said
the IFC should fine houses $50 if their
yards are not clean by 9 a.m. on
weekend mornings,

A number of additional specific
concessions were listed. In a sep-
arate set of ‘additional recommen-
dations,” the four proposed that each
fraternity be limited to five Wednes-
day night parties at their house each
term.

Under suggested concessions for
the SAC, the students asked that the

juniors or seniors be required to live
in each house not be implemented.

Senior’s fall term oriented toward Japanese studies

 

‘y CHRIS MUNSEY
itaff Reporter

 

Senior Tim Mulreany and some Japanese
riends had just caught the last train home
ite one night this fall when a Japanese

businessman staggered drunkenly over to
heir seat.

“He was yelling that he had studied Eng-
lish for many years, and insisted that he
could speak English better than I could,”
Mulreany recalled. ‘‘His friends came up,
apologized and carted him away.”

' This is just one of the many cross-cultur-
al experiences Mulreany enjoyed during
his four-month stay in Japan this fall.

* Mulreany, a senior from Potomac, Md.,
Spent the semester at Kansai University as
a part of the Homestay Program.

« “My family was a traditional Japanese
family, the children were very respectful of
tne parents, and always listened to them,
there was never much argument about any-
thing.” he said.

Mulreany described his first few weeks in
Japan as ‘‘weird,” because, he noted,
everything seemed a lot different from
American life. He said that when he was

’ Paeeting people he tried not to do anything

wrong. For example, he said he had to be
careful of how he addressed people, and
tried to appear not to be too familiar.

in the exchange program with Kansai Univ-
ersity after studying East Asian history at
&L.
Re thought I could get a lot more out of it

 

 

TIM MULREANY

by learning about it firsthand. I got a better
feeling for the country than by just studying
it here,’ Mulreany said, and his parents
were supportive, although his father had
wanted him to go to Europe. Mulreany stay-
ed in Japan from August through Decem-
ber.

Mulreany studied Japanese literature
and art in Japan and said he enjoyed the op-
portunity to see Japanese art at the Imper-
ial Museum and various temples. He also
studied the Japanese language, which he
described as intense.

Mulreany’s weekends were spent visiting
various Japanese cities, such as Kyoto and
Osaka, and going to movies and discos,
which are very popular in Japan. The social
life of many of the Japanese students Mul-
reany met revolved around various clubs,
some of which met for three hours a day six

 

days a week.

A common stereotype Mulreany said he
encounters in America about Japan is the
widespread idea that Japanese cities are
overcrowded and dirty. ‘‘It is crowded,”’ he
said, ‘‘but the cities are a lot cleaner than
ours, there are always people cleaning up.’’

Crime, regarded as a serious problem in
America, is virtually nonexistent in Japan,
Mulreany said.

“I'd say it’s the safest country in the
world,” he added. ‘‘It has to do with the way
the society is set up, there is a lot more re-
spect, kids are under better control. Police-
men in Japan patrol a certain area, and
deal with people on a much more personal
level. I never felt unsafe.”

Mulreany described Japanese society as
being different from America's. “Their
society is much more ordered,” he said.
“There are different forms of polite speech
to use depending on who you are talking to.
When a Japanese employee talks to his
boss, he uses an honorific form of address.
You often try to determine another person’s
position by the way people talk to him. They
are very conscious of place.”’

Mulreany explained that traditional
Japanese society was rigidly stratified,
with a class of Samurai at the top and pea-
sants at the bottom. ‘‘I got the feeling that
it’s still like that, although it’s changed a
great deal,’’ he added.

Japanese religious life revolves around
Shintoism and Buddhism, and Mulreany
said most people in Japan don’t get to ser-
vices regularly. The religion of Shinto in-
volves worship of native deities, with many

regions having a local patron god. The
practice of ancestor worship came about
with the rise of nationalism in the 1930s,
prior to World War II.

“After the war, the personal shrines were
downplayed, in an attempt to prevent that
type of nationalism,’’ said Mulreany, who
noted that the political system of today’s
Japan was formed after World War II.

“After 1945, Japan received a new con-
Stitution,” he added. ‘‘Women were given
the right to vote. Before, a group of ad-
visors had counseled the emperor, and he
issued edicts based on their advice. Even
today; the emperor is still very much re-
spected. ‘Hirohito’ is the wrong name. My
homestay father explained that ‘Tenno’ is

e correct name, meaning ‘heavenly
king.’ ’’

Japan now has a democratic Parliamen-
tary system, and Mulreany said Japanese
politics witness more give-and-take than
American politics, partly because active
political parties on both poles of the ideo-
logical spectrum possess seats in the Jap-
anese parliament.

“The right wing and the left wing are
very sharply split, but each still is part of
the government,”’ he said. The Liberal De-
mocratic Party (conservative) has the
most seats in the parliament.

Mulreany said he thought many of the
Japanese people he met admire the United
States, but that some resent the presence of
nuclear weapons aboard American naval
ships, which dock at naval bases located in
Japan.

Mulreany lived in a region called the

Kansai Plain, the cultural center of Japan.
The plain is on the island of Honshu, where
many of the 'erce Japanese cities are situ-
ated.

The ee language has different re-

a! dialects, and Mulreany said he had a
tough time communicating with his Home-
stay father and needed his Homestay moth-
er to interpret the father’s words into stan-
dard Japanese. Mulreany said that many of
the people he met who spoke the predomi-
nant dialect joked about the way other Jap-
anese spoke.

After he came back from Japan, Mulrea-
ny said, he appreciated certain things
about American life much more. ‘‘I appre-
ciate things like open spaces, the way
things are a lot cheaper in America and the
abundance of everything,”’ he said.

Mulreany plans to earn a degree in East
Asian Studies and western history from
Washington and Lee. Afterward, he may go
to law school, work in the Foreign Service
and possibly do something with his first-
hand experience with the Japanese lan-
guage and culture.

The exchange program Mulreany partic-
ipated in with Kansai University has been
in existence since last January. Two stu-
dents went this fall, and two more are going
at the end of January.

Professor Roger B. Jeans, chairman of
the East Asian Studies Committee, said
that interested students should see him in
Newcomb 34A. A grade point average of 2.5
is needed for participation in the program,
and Jeans recommends background study
in Japanese language and history.

functions. He added that because stu-
dents aren’t part receptive to faculty
supervision and because students of-
ten have difficulty policing other stu-
dents, a new system was needed.

Stevens also said that Dean of Stu-

» dents Lewis G. John felt W&L need-

ed to take some responsibility for the
new pavilion because it is on school
property.

Some of the guidelines for the pavi-
ion submitted to the ABC are as fol-
lows:

: An identification card from W&L

eLegal identification is required
for anyone wishing to purchase alco-
hol. According to state law, anyone
under 19 years of age will not be serv-
ed.

¢People who are perceived to be in-
toxicated will not be served.

¢People arriving already intoxicat-
ed might not be admitted.

The major thrust of these quide-
lines, Stevens said, is that students
should use common sense and exer-
cise sober judgment.

The ABC was lenient in its treat-
ment of Washington and Lee in the
December episode, Stevens indicat-
ed.

“We could have put our foot
down,”’ he said. ‘‘There were enough
violations (at the December concert)
tocall a hearing.”

Such a hearing would involve an in-
vestigation of violations observed by
ABC agents at the concert. This could
result in the denial of future alcohol
licenses for the SAB at the pavilion.

In addition, Stevens said, the ABC
could require that the SAB apply for
alcohol licenses a full month in ad-
vance of a planned event. The appro-
val process for these permits is
“tricky,’’ he said, and applications
can be rejected by several officials
for any number of reasons.

The ABC informed the SAB of these
problems and warned officials of pro-

hol license also receives a sheet out-
lining ABC rules. Stevens emphasiz-
ed that along with the state laws, the
most important thing for groups to
remember is to exercise common
sense and sober judgment.

Fraternities, although bound by
the same state regulations are handl-
ed in a different way by the ABC.
Parties at fraternity houses are re-
garded as private functions, and the
ABC usually assumes that a fraterni-
ty is abiding by the law unless it
receives a complaint. Reports from
local police, parents of Lexington
High School students and others have
resulted in ABC investigations, Ste-
vens said.

Stevens clarified the ABC’s posi-
tion by saying that agents may check
parties on a random basis; just be-
cause there has been no complaint
does not exclude a fraternity from an
“unannounced visit.”

Generally, if a fraternity keeps
people from getting ‘drunk as hoot
owls” and involving police, and pre-
vents those who do drink from driv-
ing, it will be in good shape, Stevens
said.

Fraternities can bring trouble on
themselves by charging admission to
a party and serving alcohol, Stevens
said. This constitutes a misdemeanor
— selling alcohol without a license.

Serving minors can also cause pro-
blems for fraternities, Stevens add-
ed. Although it is the individual min-
or whois guilty of underage drinking,
such action might cause the ABC to

" ‘The Executive Committee Monday
night introduced a revised set of
voting regulations and voted funds to
establish a campus scientific review.
Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers, who presented the regula-
‘tions, said they would transfer much
sof the direct authority over ad-
_ ministering elections from the EC to
"the Voting Regulations Board, an
EC-appointed body.
‘The proposed regulations would

‘provide for a VRB ‘“‘rule-setting”’

meeting at least one week before
petitions are due. Attendance is a

* prerequisite to running for office.

A minimum of two polling places
has been retained in the proposed
‘rules, but a maximum of five has

 

been deleted. Nu new maximum has
been set.

The VRB will meet the night after
an election in order to address any
student complaints, Caruthers said.
Any VRB decision may be appealed
tothe EC.

In September 1984, freshman class
presidential candidate Steve Roth
charged that only one poll, located in
the Graham-Lees quad, was open
during the class elections. The EC
voted to uphold the election results.
There was a second polling place in
the Law School, although no fresh-
man ballots were placed there.

In October 1983, the EC had to void
the results of an election when one
poll was left unmanned. According to
the rules, polls must be manned at all
times. The EC considered but re-
jected the idea of paying poll watch-

ers.

Restoration of The Willson-
Walker House, formerly the loca-
tion of the White Columns Restau-
rant, was begun in October, anda
restaurant there is expected to be
completed by spring, according to
the owner, Mrs. Jo Griswold.

The new restaurant will contain
two dining sections on the down-
stairs level and an upstairs room
that can be reserved for banquets
and meetings. One kitchen will
serve all diners.

Mrs. Griswold is hoping to find a
chef and manager to operate the
restaurant, but has not decided
who will be hired for these pos-
tions.

The Willson-Walker House will
feature New American cuisine,
which Mrs. Griswold described as
traditional American dishes pre-
pared by an experienced chef
knowledgeable in classical Italian
and French cuisine.

Recently ‘there has been an in-
terest in America of going back to
regional cooking,’ she said, and
cited as examples Cajun, Tex-
Mex, New England Style and
Southern cooking. New American
cuisine involves more complicat-
ed techniques and principles in
preparing dishes than are usually
used in traditional American
cooking. It particularly is char-
acterized by the use of ‘‘the fresh-
est native, local ingredients possi-
ble,” and by paying strict atten-
tion to using only those foods that
are in season. Mrs. Griswold said

The former White Columns Inn on Main Street is scheduled to
reopen in the spring as a restaurant featuring New American cuisine.

she also plans to offer wines from
Virginia vineyards and wineries.

Mrs. Griswold plans to decorate
the restaurant in a characteristic
1820-1830s American look. ‘“‘It’s
not going to be a re-creation’”’ of
that era, she said, but she believes
that ‘‘the look will be unique for
this area’’ and that “people will
find this attractive.”

‘‘We have a number of ‘empire’
antiques’’ that will be used in the
restaurant, she continued, but
stressed that it will not be a mus-
eum.

The name of the restaurant was
chosen because of two former
owners of the house, but is also the
name that the house has in the
Historical District of Lexington.
William Willson is a former trea-
surer of Washington College and
postmaster of Lexington. Harry ,
Walker, who was one of the last
owners of the house, operated a
market out of the downstairs.
Mrs. Griswold purchased the
house in December 1983 from
Walker's daughter, who inherited
the property from her father.

Caruthers also said it is important
to have a more independent body
listen to student complaints about
elections. Assisting him in compiling
the new regulations were current
VRB co-chairmen Bill Metzger and
David Hanna, junior EC represen-
tative Pat Hayden, last year’s VRB
chairman Chris Carter and soph-
omore Brandt Surgner.

“It’s a thankless job, granted, but
it’s an excellent resume filler,’’ joked
Caruthers, who added that he has
already been approached by two

Biology Forum members Jeff
Blount, Guy Caldwell and John Long
asked the EC for funding to publish a
trial issue of a scientific review,
similar to the W&L Political Review,
but from a scientific perspective.

W&L biology Professor Thomas G.
Nye said his department would pro-
vide $150, according to Caldwell. The
EC approved an additional $550 from
its reserve fund.

Biz Roanoke loss cools cagers

Sophomore Jeff Harralson goes up strong for two points in second half act-

ion from Thursday's Roanoke game.

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball Generals suffered a pair of con-
ference losses, including a second-
half disaster at home against arch-
rival Roanoke, and picked up one
ODAC win in a week that left Coach
Verne Canfield’s squad at 9-7 overall
and 3-3 in the conference.

Trailing by only one point at
halftime but losing by a final score of
74-52, the Generals did not keep up
with the scoring pace set by the Roa-
noke College Maroons in the second
half of Thursday night’s game.

‘We played poorly,’’ said Canfield,
referring to the second half of the
game in which the Maroons outscor-
ed the Generals by 21 points. Canfield
stated, ‘‘We lost our concentration
(in the second half) and did not work
our offense well enough to keep their
transition game away from them.”

Describing the difficult task that
his team had accomplished, Roanoke
head coach Ed Green said, ‘‘It is very
hard to beat W&L on its home court.”’
He continued, ‘‘I think that one might
add that this is one of the best games
that Roanoke has played all year.”’

Roanoke gained its 22 point margin
of victory at the free throw line. The
Maroons scored 28 points in 37 at-
tempts, while the Generals scored
only six points in seven attempts.

Scott Shannon led the Generals in
their cause with 18 points and 13 re-
bounds. Roanoke’s Reggie Thomas
led all scorers with 22 points.

For W&L basketball fans,
these guys are ‘in the bag’

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

When talking about W&L’s
Unknown Fans, a good thing to
remember is that it’s all in the bag.

The Fans have become W&L’s un-
official cheerleaders, each year don-

ning their grocery bags and making
an appearance in the Warner Center
when the Generals host the Roanoke
College Maroons.

Thursday night, the Fans were up
to their old tricks — _ heckling
referees, Roanoke players and
coaches and leading the crowd in
cheers for the Generals.

According to junior Chris Komosa,
who said it was his third year ‘‘in the
sack’’ and his second as one of the
group’s organizers, the Fans do it for
the fun. In looking for recruits, he
said he was looking for ‘‘wild guys
who are willing to make fools of
themselves’’ and are spontaneous.

Doctor Unknown, aka Bill Bloom,
who made his first appearance this
year, said that the fun of being a Fan
was in ‘‘being able to express the true
feelings of the game with my identity
unknown.” He said he was recruited
because he had very few inhibitions,
éither with or without a bag.

In recent years, the Fans have
created some controversy, however.
This year’s version of the Fans were
required to remain on the W&L
sideline and could not stand under
the baskets or on the Roanoke
sideline.

The Fans’ leader said that the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference had
adopted these rules after an incident
that occurred after last year’s game.
Any violation of these rules would
have resulted in a technical foul
against the Generals, he said, and so
the Fans were forced to be a little
more restrained than in previous
years.

Despite these rules, an incident did
occur. Several girls from Roanoke
attacked the Fans and de-bagged a
few of them, including Komosa.

When asked what precautions the
Fans will take to prevent their iden-
tities from being revealed, Komoso
said, ‘‘I guess we'll have to wear two
bags next year.”’

CALL DAYS, EVENINGS
& WEEKENDS:

    

Roanoke opened the scoring in the
ballgame when guard Rob Lowry
scored on a jumper from the top of
the key. Jeff Harralson scored for the
Generals to tie the game at 2-2.

The Generals, however, opened up
a four-point lead when Scott Shannon
scored his third basket in as many
tries with 13:51 remaining in the first
half. Roanoke rallied and tied the
game 10-10 when Reggie Thomas
scored at the 1li-minute mark.

Kevin McClatchy scored a basket
at 9:12 to give the Generals their se-
cond four-point lead of the game at
14-10. McClatchy also scored the next
basket for the Generals with 2:57 re-
maining in the first half. During that
6:15 scoring drought, Roanoke out-
scored W&L 8-0 and built an 18-14
lead.

Roanoke led 21-18 with one minute
left in the half, but the Generals cut
the Maroon lead to a single point
when senior swing man Lex Fitzen-
hagen scored on a drive to the bucket
as the final seconds ticked off the
clock.

The Generals managed to stay
close behind Roanoke early in the
second half. Roanoke’s leading
scorer for the season, Shane Aber-
nathy (16.5 points per game), scored
first to boost the Maroons’ lead to
three. Harmon Harden answered to
pull the Generals within one point.
Roanoke, however, began controlling
the game and building a lead.

With 10:35 remaining in the game,
the Maroons’ Charles Small, who was
a question mark before the game
started after having injured his ankle
in Roanoke’s 83-61 loss to ODAC lead-
er Maryville, hit two free throws that
gave Roanoke a 35-26 lead- At this
point in the second half, Roanoke had
outscored W&L 14-6. Dnring the re-
mainder of the game, the Maroons
controlled the tempo using their
transition offense and high shooting
percentage from the line.

Unable to get the ball inside again-
st the Maroons’ tough zone defense
and unable to shoot effectively from
the outside, the Generals could not
make arun at Roanoke’s lead.

The Generals rebounded from the
Roanoke loss with an overwhelming
69-44 victory against Lynchburg on
Saturday night in Lynchburg. Scott

 

Shannon led the Generals with 19
points and seven rebounds.

On Tuesday night, the Generals
suffered a 54-53 heartbreaker loss at
the hands of Eastern Mennonite. The
Generals, who were within a few
points of the Royals for much of the
game, tied things up late in the game
and went ahead on a basket from
Fitzenhagen.

With fewer than 30 seconds to play
in the game, the Generals. forced a
missed shot from Eastern Mennonite
with senior playmaker David Wilkin-
son pulling down the rebound. The
Royals fouled Shannon, giving the
senior forward a chance to ice the
victory with just :04 to play and W&L
up 53-52.

Shannon, however, could not con-
nect on the one-and-one. The Royals

= 3 yates. =e

 

Roanoke’s Reggie Thomas continued to plague the Warner

called a time out and after the break
came back to work a full-court pass
to their leading scorer Leonard Dow
(20 points on the night). Dow caught
the pass at the foul line drove to the
basket, laying in the winning basket
as the buzzer sounded.

Commeni..., on the last second
loss, Canfield said, ‘‘Of course it is’
frustrating and disappointing, buty

ahead to the next game.”

Last weekend, the Washington and
Lee swimming team raised their per-
fect record to 50, after defeating
Frostburg State 68-45 and George-
town University 77-33.

Even though the team won by large
margins, it was one of their poorest
performances of the 1984-85 season,
according to Coach Page Remillard.
After six events, the teams were tied
with only seven events remaining.

“‘We didn’t swim well at the start
because we walked in with the im-
pression that a subpar mental pre-
paration would be enough to win,”
said Remillard. ‘During the middle
we talked and realized the team was
flat and needed to unite. From there-
on we took charge of both meets —
good teams need to be able to do
that.”

All-American Bobby Pearson also
felt that the team’s mental prepara-
tion was a problem, “It wasn’t that
we weren’t taking this meet serious-
ly, but we were confident.’’ Pearson

Activities pavilion:
so funny it’s sad (?)

....Let’s just come straight out
with it: I can’t use the pavilion and
I’m madder than hell about it.
Frankly, I see that tin roof ex-
travaganza out in the middle of
nowhere as nothing more than an
overgrown storage shed. No, wait a
sec. Let’s step back and look at what
the navilion was supposed to be,
what it is, where it’s failing and how it can be made better.

Way back when (last year), when they were deciding on what the
pavilion was supposed to be, the SAB started the ball rolling with the
idea for a party pavilion, and it was essentially their structure until
the athletic department added its two cents worth — and well they
should have. The Board of Trustees decided on a compromise and
what resulted was the compromise structure that we have before us.

As a party hall, the pavilion is fine, certainly not the best, but
something sufficient to handle the rumpus room minds of most W&L
men. As an indoor athletic facility, it has provided a place for sports
teams to play during inclement weather. Period. No ups, no extras. In-
deed, it is minimal in effectiveness in a couple of key areas that I
would like to address here.

Listen, we’ve built the thing, it’s got a tennis court, why not use it to
the fullest extent possible? Despite all the pre-decision discussion, it
seems the facility was constructed with its athletic uses as an after-
thought. Granted, its primary purpose may have been social in nature,
but if the possibility exists that the barn can be used in a multi-purpose
sense, please don’t go halfway with it.

The tennis court is ludicrous, and what makes it even more
ludicrous is that its inadequacies would have required no major think-
ing to have been changed. First, the court is lightning fast— from talk-
ing to some of the tennis team players; you see I couldn’t know how it
feels to play on it (but more on this later). And I think this negates any
measurable transfer to a real tennis court (Tennis on Mondoflex is
probably worse than driving on ice). The court setup must have been
conceived by someone who was cruel, misguided or didn’t want the
court there in the first place (ah, perhaps there’s the rub). A white cur-
tain as a backdrop creates enough visual problems in itself, but when
you couple that with lines so indistinguishable that you can’t see from
baseline to baseline to baseline...well, let’s just say that white on tan
makes so much sense that I believe it’s a prime indication of declining
SAT’s at Mr. Lee’s university). I think this all could have been cor-
rected by the purchase of a tennis court mat that could be rolled out
when needed, hence eliminating the need for Mondoflex, but then that
required some thinking, didn’t it?

All this aside, I still can’t go play tennis in the pavilion tonight. The
guidelines for the facility mention that only athletic teams can make
use of the facility in a non-concert or non-party sense. It is a misuse of
the facility to restrict it to the use of athletic teams. The concerts in the
pavilion have been very nice and (deep breath) will continue to be so.
My gripe is that on nights when it’s empty there’s no reason — at least
that I can figure — why the court shouldn’t be available for student use

just like so many other racquetball and the squash courts. It’s there,
let’s use it...

.... Moving quickly to the Colonnade, just one thought for the hoops
team after an up and down week: I still think this group can play with
any team in the league. Stay tuned until late February. . . Good to see
swimmers and grapplers going strong as expected. . . . And one final
free throw: The Unknown Fans were perhaps a good idea at one time.
Let us hope that some day they again can become one....

TIME
OUT....

Stachura

 

 

 

....With no offer or, rather, decision coming out of Buffalo, Doug
Flutie seems to be hinting at going with the New Jersey Generals. If
Trump can swing the deal, and pick up Flutie’s roomie Gerard Phelan,
the Generals could be worthy of any NFL club, but then again who
would know or care...

....I think basketball is becoming, more and more, America’s game.
The reason? Well, with cable you can end up with as many as five or
six games a night, and if one gets boring, you can always switch chan-
nels to find one that isn’t. Can’t do that with football or baseball, but
re I guess you couldn’t do that even if there were five or six games a
night....

....Finally, never thought I’d see the day that the World Chess Cham-
pionships became exciting, but after five months the affair in Moscow

is perhaps building to a head. So where’s ESPN when you really need

» Still Keeps them perfect, 5-0

continued to say, ‘‘During our team
meeting the coach didn’t kick us
around, he just made us think about
what we were doing.”

“I explained to the guys that they
don’t need to work as hard as they do
to turn in the times they had swum,”’
said Remillard. ‘‘They work hard
and make a lot of sacrifices and it
doesn’t make sense to do poorly. It’s
like going to class and not listening or
participating, you don’t get anything
out of it.”

Coach Remillard also felt that he
may have affected his team’s think-
ing when he changed the normal line-
up and switched swimmers to differ-
ent events.

“I changed the lineups and was
looking ahead to James Madison, so
they may have felt they didn’t need to
worry since I wasn’t worried,’ Rem-
illard said.

This weekend the Generals will
meet the James Madison Dukes, a
Division I team that won the Virginia
Intercollegiate State Championships
held at Washington and Lee on Dec.
15-16. The team is not shy about say-
ing there is very little chance of beat-
ing James Madison.

“We are a 30 point underdog,”’ said
Tim Stanford. ‘They (JMU) should
earn 14 points in the relays and 14
points in the diving events too, and
they only need 57 points to win. Not
that our divers are not good, but
their’s are more experienced.”’

Stanford is part of the free-style
relay team. They know they’re an
underdog and aren’t scared.

“We pulled it off against John Hop-
kins and even though we are a few
point underdog we’re not going to roll
over and die,”’ said Stanford.

Although the team is in a tight sit-
uation, their attitude is good and they
are hoping for a large turnout since
the meet will be in conjunction with
the Washington and Lee intramural
swimming meet. Both take place on
Friday night.

Stickley named
Lex High coach

Washington and Lee assistant foot-
ball coach Jeff Stickley was named
head coach of the Lexington High
School football team Tuesday.

Stickey was selected by the school
board at the recommendation of the
superintendent of schools and the
principal, vice principal George War-
ren said. Warren said Stickley was
the assistant football coach at LHS
during the 1979-80 season.

A graduate of Bridgewater Col-
lege, Stickley joined W&L in the fall
of 1982 after coaching at James
Madison University.

Grapplers go 7-2-1; Dixon back

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

Less than one month after undergo-
ing arthroscopic knee surgery, senior
captain Jeff Dixon returned to action
last night with a pair of victories that
helped the Washington and Lee
wrestling team to a victory over
Virginia State and a tie against
Howard.

Against Virginia State, W&L over-
came an early deficit to run out the
victory in the heavier weight classes.
Earning points for the Generals were
Steve Castle (118 Ibs.), Jeff Mazza
(134 Ibs.), Larry Anker (142 lbs.),
Kevin McNamara (150 Ibs.), Greg
Russell (158 lbs), Dixon (190 Ibs.) and
heavyweight Mark Weaver to win
29-12.

The Generals earned the tie
against Howard when they won three
of the last four bouts starting with
Win Phillips’ forfeit victory at 167.
The final score was 25-25.

The win and the tie, coupled witha
victory over Washington and Jeffer-
son and losses to Division I teams
Duke and VMI at Saturday’s W&L
Quadrangular, raised the Generals’
record to 7-2-1.

The Generals topped traditionally
strong W&J, home of the Presidents
(and, yes, believe it or not, the First
Ladies), by a 33-9 score. The Gener-
als got the early jump on their Pen-
nsylvania foes with Castle and Brian
Lifsted (126 lbs.) recording wins by
decisions and Mazza pickingp up six
team points via a forfeit. A pin from
Anker at 142 gave the Generals an
18-0 lead after the first four bouts.

Following losses by McNamara
and Russell, Phillips got the grap-

plers back on track with a hard
fought 9-6 decision. Kendrick also
added a decision at 177 lbs., O’Neill
won by fall at 3:41, and Weaver clos-
ed a solid team effort with a 5-2 deci-
sion victory at the heavyweight divi-
sion.

Saturday’s second team match
brought the Generals their first de-
feat of the season. Some solace per-
haps was to be taken as the 34-11 de-
feat was handed down by the Division
I Duke Blue Devils. W&L remains un-
defeated in competition against Divi-
sion III opponents.

Castle opened the match against
the Blue Devils with a forfeit victory.
Anker was the next to record team
points for the Generals, battling his
foe at 142 to a 4-4 draw. Five bouts
later, 190-pounder O’Neill got the
Generals’ only head-to-head victory,
gaining a 9-8 decision by virtue of his
riding time advantage.

The final match of the afternoon
brought loss No. 2 of the 1984-85 sea-
son as crosstown rival VMI, which
won all three of its matches at the
quadrangular, beat the Generals
32-14,

The Generals did fare better than
they did against Duke, getting three
wins and a draw. After a loss by Cas-
tle at 118, Lifsted rebounded with an
11-4 victory. Mazza was defeated at
134 Ibs., but Anker earned a 5-4 deci-
sion to get the Generals as close as
they would get in the team scoring,
down 10-6 after the first four bouts.

Following losses by McNamara,

sophomore Tim Walker and Phillips,
Kendrick at 177 controlled his oppo-
nent, pinning him at 4:48 of the
match. O’Neill was pinned at 190, but
Weaver closed out the match on an
upbeat note with three third period
points to earn the draw at the heavy-
weight division.

member, Browne's role varied from
that of singer, dancer and soloist to
that of promotion, technical and
labor assistant

“The experiences I had were
marvelous and rare for someone my
age,”’ he said. “They were ex-
periences | will cherish for the rest of
my life.”

Those experiences included travel-
ing throughout the United States,
Mexico and Europe with the cast of
about 100 members from more than
20 countries. He met famous actors
and actresses, mayors, governors
and more than 90 host families. Host
families in each city house the cast.

More than 10,000 young people app-
ly for the cast positions each year,
and between 500 and 600 are ac-
cepted. The year of traveling and
performing costs the cast member

about $5,800, which is only about one-
third of the actual cost. Various sup-
port groups, as well as charges for
admission to the performances, help
to cover the other costs, Browne said.

Cast members range in age from 18
to 26, and their average age is 20. The
only requirement for membership is
a high school diploma, and accep-
tance is based almost completely on
an interview, with little regard for
talent, according to Browne.

Admission for tomorrow's perfor-
mance, which will last two hours, will
be $5. Browne said the performance
will include singing and dancing to
“all original, enjoyable music.”’

And when he sees the performance,
Browne said, “‘I will be watching and
dying to get up on stage. . . . They’ll
have to strap me to my seat.”’

Breakin’ ‘Conan’ mold

MOVIEREVIEW

 

By STEVEN SANDLER
Movie Critic

 

“The Terminator,’’ starring Ar-
nold Schwarzenegger, qualifies pro-
bably as the best ‘‘B’’ movie of the
year. Unlike the banal ‘‘Conan”’ films
that relied simply on the former Mr.
Universe's large biceps, “‘The Ter-
minator’’ is a genuinely suspenseful
and entertaining film.

The setting is present-day Los
Angeles, and the Terminator
(Schwarzenegger) has been sent
through time from the year 2027. The
unit is a cyborg that has been built
and programmed by a sophisticated
network of computers that rules the
world in the aftermath of a nuclear
war. His target for termination is
Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton), but
the reason for this, I will not disclose
here.

Her only hope, however, is Sgt.
Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who

‘Breakin’ 2’
MOVIEREVIEW

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

 

‘Breakin’ 2 Electric Boogaloo,”’
the sequel to last summer’s highly
lucrative ‘‘Breakin’,’’ features the
same threesome (Ozone, Kelly and
Turbo) who danced their way to suc-
cess in that picture. This story begins
with Kelly dancing in Broadway
chorus lines and Ozone and Turbo
helping teach dance at a local youth
center. The conflict arises when a
real estate developer decides to buy
the land around the youth center,
tear it down and build a shopping
mall. Will the kids lose their
neighborhood to the developer? What
do you think? “Breakin’ 2” is, to be
blunt, a very predictable movie.

As in all Hollywood musicals, danc-
ing and singing are key components
here. Unfortunately, neither the
dancing nor the singing leaves
lasting impressions. The one song
that does stay with you is “I Believe
in the Beat,’’ which also states the
theme of the movie — “the Beat’

has been assigned to protect her.
Reese has been sent back through
time by the humans fighting against
their ultimate extermination at the
‘“thands”’ of the computer system.

What makes this movie work are
the performances of Biehn, Hamilton
and Schwarzenegger and the well-
paced dialogue. As the cyborg
assassin, Schwarzenegger is not
blessed with an abundance of conver-
sation in his role, but he makes the
most of the lines he has. More impor-
tantly, though, is his physical perfor-
mance as he is very convincing play-
ing his part, simply through the ap-
parent ease by which he seems to
destroy everything in his path at
some points in the movie.

Biehn and Hamilton are not out-
done by their counterpart, to the ex-
tent that the dramatic flow and even
the plot itself are not relying totally
on Schwarzenegger’s presence.
Their relationship is indeed crucial to
the story, and it is because of this
balance among the three main
characters, and not in spite of it, that
the movie is successful for the
viewer.

lacks flash

conquers all. The dancing, however,
leaves much to be desired; after
“Breakin’,” “Beat Street,’ and
countless TV and commercial uses of
break dancing, its use as the central
action in ‘‘Boogaloo’’ is tiresome.

Three minor points do seem worth
mentioning. The relationship among
the three main characters comes
across as very strong, especially
when Ozone and Kelly look at each
other, Seeing Turbo dance around his
room is also kind of fun because when
I say ‘“‘around his room,”’ I mean ceil-
ing, walls, floors, everywhere. Final-
ly, there is a hilarious scene when
Ozone is teaching Turbo to pick up
girls; each ‘‘sees’’ the other dancing
with his own girlfriend. These are,
however, minor moments and hardly
enough to make an hour-and-a-half
movie.

The quick release of this sequel has
raised a few eyebrows and a few
questions, and justifiably so. The suc-
cess of its predecessor and the lure of
the Christmas audience won’t be
enough to save this picture. Ozone
himself says, ‘“‘We gotta come up
with some new moves.”’ ‘‘Breakin’
2,” disappointingly, does not.

‘Reds,’ ‘October’ provide
views of Russian Revolution

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Looking for more than three hours
of entertainment and enlightenment
at absolutely no charge?

Then clear your calendar for the
evening of Jan. 30 or 31, when the
politics department presents
“Reds,” the Oscar-winning portrayal
of the American Left and the Russian
Revolution directed, produced, co-
written and starring Warren Beatty,
with appearances by Diane Keaton,
Jack Nicholson and Gene Hackman.
The film portrays the life of
American Socialist John Reed and

the role fie atu vulers piayeu in the
Russian Revolution.

For another viewpoint on the same
theme, Russian director Sergei
Eisenstein’s film “October: Ten
Days That Shook the World ”’ is being
presented tomorrow night. The film,
based loosely on Reed’s book, has the
distinction of being censored both in
Russia, for its political content, and
in America, for its religious satire.
The segments dealing with religion

have been re-inserted for tomorrow _

night’s show. This film is noted for its
innovative use of cinematic tech-
niques.

Both films will be shown in Room
327 of the Commerce School at 7 p.m.

Williams said.

 

The months of planning and
weekend’s
seventh annual Washington and Lee
Muscular Dystrophy Superdance will
pay off — to the tune of $30,000 if
Superdance officials get their wish.

Chris Williams, chairman of the
Superdance steering committee, ex-
pressed great hopes for the event,
which begins at 8 p.m. Friday in the
student activities pavilion and con-
tinues until 2 a.m. Sunday. With four
bands scheduled and approximately
200 dancers expected, Williams said
this year’s dance could be ‘‘the most
exciting and successful ever.’’

In addition to the dancing and
bands, the Superdance will feature
the annual pie throw in the faces of
selected professors. Groups or in-
dividuals can bid for the right to toss
a pie at faculty members. Those par-
ticipating this year include Edward
C. Atwood Jr., dean of the commerce
school; Wayne M. Dymacek, math
professor; George C. O’Connell Jr.
and Boyd H. Williams, both of the
athletic department; and Hampden
H. Smith, journalism professor.

Along with the pie throws, the
Superdance Committee has planned
other events to raise additional
funds. Cooperation with an organiza-
tion known as Circle K, a liaison to
area women’s colleges and VMI, has
raised about $1,500 from ‘‘slave auc-
tions’ at Hollins and Mary Baldwin
colleges and approximately $500
from raffle ticket sales. These funds
are to be used to help defray the
operating costs of the Superdance,

v While nearly 200 dancers are
partying in the pavilion, two students

Hall.

The Circle K groups are helpful,
Williams said, in making the Super-
dance a true ‘community effort.”
Williams also expressed thanks to
Superdance committee co-chairmen
Darby Brower, David Sizemore and
Charles Stern as well as to the entire
W&L community. He noted that fra-
ternities, freshmen, the food service,
buildings and grounds department,
print shop and others were helpful in
the preparations for the weekend.
“It’s amazing how everybody pulls
together to come through.”

The Washington and Lee Super-
dance is different from many of the
superdances held at other schools
across the country, Williams said,
and W&L puts on a bigger show than
most schools. While dances at places
such as Virginia Tech may feature
‘800 dancers, they usually don’t have
the number of bands or raise the
amount of money that W&L does, he
said.

Washington and Lee raises more
money per student than any other
school, Williams said, and last year
was 12th in the nation in total dollars
raised.

Last year’s total was $35,000, and a
representative from W&L traveled to
Las Vegas for the Jerry Lewis Labor
Day Telethon.

 

$1 million upgrade in store for W&L’s computers

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

More than $1 million may be spent over the
next five years to replace the University’s Har-
ris computer system, according to members of
a computer planning committee.

At its meeting two weeks ago, the Board of
Trustees allocated $310,000 for the purchase of
a central machine by June 31.

The Board will consider funding for the re-
mainder of the committee’s five-year plan in
May, and chemistry Professor Thomas C. Im-
eson II, director of the computer center, said
the five-year plan will cost ‘in excess of $1
million.”’

The University’s current central machine
can ‘‘conceivably”’ service only 20 of the 35 ter-
minals on campus, Imeson said.

“We obviously need to expand the processing
capability of the system,’’ he added.

The new computer system would be funded
by gifts and money the University has put aside

Grad schools

 

from previous years, according to University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley. In addition, about
$1 million in a capital projects fund earns 8 or 9
percent interest in a short-term investment,
Epley said, and this income probably also will
be applied to the project.

The University hopes to order the central
machine by the end of February, receive it in
June and install it during the summer.

Although the new system has not been
chosen, Imeson said the ‘‘prime contenders’’
are one of Digital Equipment Corp.’s VAX
machines or possibly a bigger Harris machine.

“‘Not many other machines would qualify,”’
said Imeson, referring to the systems’
capabilities and costs.

Under the five-year plan, microcomputers
would be installed throughout both the
undergraduate and the Law School campuses,
according to Imeson.

Associate Professor Robert E. Danford, head
cataloger at the University Library and a
member of the policy subcommittee of the
computer committee, said that ‘‘an unspecified

politics, history, business majors

number of microcomputers for word process-
ing and educational software”’ would be install-
ed at the library during the next five years.

“Specific machines haven’t been discussed,”’
he said. ‘‘The computer center will have the
final say.”’

The educational software the University
hopes to acquire for the microcomputers would
relate to specific types of courses, Danford
said. For example, he said, biology programs
now are available for teaching genetics.

“We can expect that more and more of these
programs will be available,’’ Danford said.

The faculty at some colleges and universities
are given the use of computers at low costs, but
in return must create programs that can be
marketed by owners of the computers.

Although such a deal probably will never ex-
ist at W&L, Danford said, such deals will
‘determine the amount of courseware that we
would have’’ available from which to choose.

The library’s central location, popularity as
a study area, 24-hour schedule and routine for
checking in and out resources would be influen-

Job market

tial in the decision to place microcomputers on
the library’s main floor, he added.

Students will be able to use the microcom-
puters for word processing and for term
papers, according to Imeson.

The Harris computer system now used by thé
University was put into operation in October
1977 and has been expanded and enhanced
since then. ;

The system’s ability to service existing stu-
dent demand has been reached, Imeson said,
and no room for expansion exists.

“We have maxed out — if you will — its
capacity and are in need of a more powerful
system,” he said.

The new system will have a substantially
faster processing speed and ‘‘by virtue of that
it can handle more simultaneous terminal con-
nections,” Imeson added.

In the next five years, terminals will be add-
ed to the existing clusters in the Commerce
School, Parmly Hall, Robinson Hall and the
library. A new cluster of microcomputers will
be added in Newcomb Hall.

 

 

Senior resume book:

Students who major in
mathematics, philosophy and

science do better on law and
business school aptitude tests
than do students who follow the
traditional pre-law and _ pre-
business curriculums, according
to a recent survey by the National
Institute of Education.

Arts and science majors are
better prepared to take standar-
dized tests because they are
taught to approach problems with
more structured, logical thought,
said Clifford Adelman, a senior
associate at NIE who put together
the survey.

Math majors outperformed all
other majors on the Law School
Admissions Test and the Grad-
uate Management Admissions
Test in 1981-82, the report stated.
Their scores were 12.8 percent
higher than the average on the
LSAT and 13.3 percent higher on
the GMAT.

Students majoring in the com
mon pre-law curriculums pol-
itics, history and English —did

worse on the LSAT than did math
majors. Politics majors scored 1.6
percent lower than the average,
history majors scored 2.9 percent
higher than the average, and
English majors scored 5.6 percent
higher.

On the GMAT, all business-
related majors did about 5 percent
worse than the average, while
scores for persons majoring in the
humanities, social sciences and
physical sciences all were better.

The 10 highest-scoring majors
on the LSAT and GMAT were, in
order: math, philosophy, engi-
neering, economics, chemistry,
English, foreign languages,
government, history and biology.

The fact that the same majors
consistently led the way in all the
graduate aptitude tests surveyed
supports the theory that those ma-
jors simply better prepare a stu-
dent to take standardized tests,
Adelman said in an interview this
week.

“That has to do with the
knowledge paradigms in their ma-
jors,’’ Adelman said. He loosely
defined a knowledge paradigm as

Money counts

If there is anything that bothers me, it is a person who
seems to have little concept of the value of money. I think
that maybe I, too, fall into that category occasionally,
especially when I receive the phone bill at the end of the
month. But college students often are accused of spending
their parents’ money with little concern for the hard work
behind the faces of Washington, Hamilton and Franklin.

College students, then, seem to have little right to criticize
others’ seeming disregard for hard-earned dollars. But that
seems to be the case, considering the way the costs of going
to school have skyrocketed faster than NASA’s secret mis-
sion. Last week, one rumor going around campus before the
Board of Trustee’s meeting had the Executive Committee
recommending that the student tax (the fee we students pay
for general student activities, i.e. entertainment by the SAB,
the Calyx and The Ring-tum Phi) be raised by $5 for inflation
and another $5 for coeducation. $10 is not much really, con-
sidering the cost of beer in the Cockpit or the ticket price to
see George Thorogood.

But last week, the Commerce Department reported that in-
flation had been at its lowest level since 1967, a measly 3.8
percent rise in the general price level of goods and services.
This past year, the student activities fee was $75, not in-
cluding the $25 paid exclusively for the pavilion. Accounting
for inflation, the increase should be $2.85. Big deal — Let’s
just kick in an additional $2.15 for another two or three bands
during the year. What the heck.

But don’t forget the additional $5 you might have had to pay
to help with the costs of coeducation. That would be $5 for
funding whatever women’s groups decide to ask the EC for
money. Forget the fact that freshmen traditionally have been
sheepish when it comes to entering the EC room, much less
the probability that they can organize themselves and pre-
sent a logical budget request just three weeks into the term.

The student tax has risen at an alarming rate in the past
few years. Two years ago, the EC instituted a one-year tax to
finance the 1984 Mock Convention. This year, despite the
Mock Convention’s running in the black, we each continue to
pay $5 for the 1984 Mock Convention.

So it comes as a great surprise to me, and to many others,
that anyone could recommend an increase in the student ac-
tivities fee for next year. This year’s EC has reported an ex-
cess of funds this year; next year, with a larger freshman
class, more funds will be available for distribution.

Perhaps it is somewhat reassuring that the Board of
Trustees decided at its January meeting not to raise the stu-
dent activities fee. Perhaps it shows that someone
somewhere realizes that an extra dollar on that tax is not
necessarily a dollar well-spent. And perhaps, despite the
trustees’ decision to raise the tuition for next year to $7,100,
there might be some hope for’a future decrease in the ac-
tivities fee.

But at this point, that is all conjecture. It is little consola-
tion that the activity fee has remained the same while tuition
has risen as greatly as it has. Many students contribute
heavily to their college education. Many students work long
hours or two jobs for the money to attend college. Many
students, despite assurances they will receive financial aid,
fail to matriculate because they cannot manage the ex-
penses. And while the Board of Trustees is to be commended
for increasing the pool of available funds for financial aid for
students in need, a greater effort to contain costs is needed.
We cannot continue to increase the financial aid reserve
forever, but we can certainly try to cut the fat until we must
compromise quality.

We recognize the necessity of maintaining Washington and
Lee’s quality, but quality is of no use if no one can afford it.
Any advantage we gain by coeducation is steadily and surely
eroded if we allow costs to rise unchecked. If tuition fees and
student taxes continue to rise, maybe we’ll have to amend
that familiar quote to include three certainties in life: death,
taxes and higher education fees.

Fraternities benefit W&L, community

 

By Brandt
Surgner

Over the past year and a half, the
fraternities at W&L have come under
serious fire from all areas of the
Washington and Lee community.
They have been under attack due to
their physical condition, their inter-
nal organization and their social
functions. It seems to me as if many
of these accusations have been exag-
gerated as well as unfounded. It also
is apparent that no one has taken the
time to recognize the positive aspects
of fraternities and the good they do
for the University.

I would first like to point out that
the fraternity system, as everyone
knows, is an integral part of Wash-
ington, and Lee. Well over half of the
student body are members of frater-
nities and feel as if their fraternity is
an important part of their collegiate

 

life. A vast majority of our student
leaders and varsity athletes are
members of fraternities.

Fraternities are mainly under at-
tack for their ‘‘wild and out-of-con-
trol partying.’’ Many of these com-
plaints, in my opinion, are unfounded
and vastly exaggerated. It is true
that there is a reasonable amount of
“‘partying”’ that goes on at W&L, but
this is one of the aspects of college
life that prepares us for the ‘‘real
world.” If a student can’t make the
logical choice between studying for
his history test or going to a Wednes-
day night party, that’s his fault, not
his fraternity’s. As for the aceusa-
tions of ‘‘peer pressure,”’ etc., to at-
tend these parties, if the student
can’t say NO, that is again his fault,
and there is no fraternity that I know
of that requires its pledges to attend
parties.

It also has been agreed that these
parties cause excessive damage to
the fraternity houses. I can’t imagine
several parties a month being that
detrimental to the physical condition

Letters

of the houses. Each month the frater-
nities must submit a checklist to the
dean of fraternity affairs. Included in
this checklist are provisions to repair
any damages to the fraternity (win-
dows, shutters, doors, etc). Before
the checklist is submitted, all repairs
must be completed, or a penalty is
imposed upon the fraternity. With
such a system, the problems that
may be caused by parties can be
quickly taken care of.

Fraternities also have house man-
agers who are responsible for keep-
ing the fraternity clean and in good
shape. This is yet another step frater-
nities take to make sure their house
looks respectable. As for trash litter-
ing the lawn and streets outside fra-
ternities, the IFC has discussed im-
posing a fine of some sort against
fraternities that don’t take care of
this problem. It seems evident to me
that the University has taken mea-
sures to keep the fraternities in good
physical condition without the need
to limit the number of parties we can
have.

I think it is important now to men-
tion some of the good things fraterni-
ties do for the community. I know of
one fraternity that holds an annual
Christmas party for the neighbor-
hood children. Other fraternities
sponsor fund-raising events for or-
ganizations such as the MDA. Anoth-
er fraternity held a drunken driving
seminar, while others make dona-
tions to charitable organizations.

The fraternities, most importantly,
promote a strong sense of brother-
hood both among members and
among houses. Friendships are made
that will endure way beyond the time
we all have graduated and left W&L.
Itis very important, at this time, that
the fraternities of Washington and
Lee band together and show the com-
munity that we are not just a bunch
of ‘‘wild partiers’’ but that we can be
beneficial to both the University and
the community as a whole.

B. Scott keeps this reader inquiring

ToB. Scott Tilley:

I love to laugh, soI read your week-
ly column in The Phi. ‘‘My View’’ has
remained a welcome study break
throughout the past year. Last week,
however, you really outdid yourself.

While I respect your stance on
abortion, I cannot quite get a grip on
your argument. I guess the key
sentence of the entire discussion was
‘Abortion denies the sanctity of the
very institution we cling to des-
perately as our own dearest right and
liberty.” I wish I could understand.
Could my deficiency in journalism
credits have something to do with my
ignorance? B. Scott, please make an
attempt to write more lucidly so we
who are less knowledgeable than you
can understand your wise and cosmo-
politan teachings.

Wnen wurying to decipher your
message, I often times encounter
another problem. Your examples do
not support or prove your argument
Even a lowly anthropology major as

myself can see that. Last week you
really screwed up. You told us that
abortion is murder and that we
should regain “‘our vision of the long
clung-to American dream.”’ You
claimed that we can see an example
of the ‘American dream” by study-
ing the ‘“Great American Frontier,”
“‘a wild, unconquered west’’ where
men loved sore muscles and callous-
ed hands. B. Scott, I hate to tell you
this, but the saga of the frontiersman
and his flintlock does not send red,
white and blue shivers up my spine.
Does this by chance mean I am a
Communist?

Most frontiersmen, however, did
send red shivers down (not up) the
spines of many American Indians.
See, B. Scott, when blood leaves the
body it is colored only red, not red,
white and blue. President Ulysses S.
Grant, one of the greatest American
heroes, saw his armies fight more
than 200 battles with the Indians dur-
ing his eight-year administration

Adequate ID needed for Pit

To the Editors:

I would like to inform the student
body of the new Cockpit policy
toward those under the legal age of 19
who are caught drinking within the
Cockpit.

Those people who have been mark-
ed with the red stamp meaning he or
she is either under 19 years of age or
did not present adequate identifica-
tion but drink beer, will be asked to
leave the Cockpit immediately.
Unless this person, at a later date,
can show us identification proving
that he or she is 19 years of age, that
person will be banned from the Cock-

ment about us in his last Time Out
column. The Unknown Fans and
Mike Stachura seem. to have one
thing in common: We both like to
make fools of ourselves. The big dif-
ference is that we do it on purpose
while Mr. Stachura seems to do it
naturally. The Unknown Fans are
proud that they try to help out our
basketball team and encourage high
attendance rather than just whining

pit for the remainder of the school
year.

This policy, however severe it may
appear, is necessary to protect our
license to serve beer. I think
everyone is aware of the close
scrutiny which we are under by ABC
officials.

In addition, we need valid iden-
tification as proof of age. Since we
are open to the public as well as
Washington and Lee students, we
cannot accept someone’s legality to
drink on their honor.

And the Unknown Fans

(William S. McFeely, ‘‘Grant’’ 1982,
p. 316). It remains impossible even to
estimate the number of Indians killed
during these abominations. Of course
you realize this had to occur for the
fulfillment of your ‘American
dream.”’ I hope you understand what
you said in your article. It can be
summed up in the following manner:

Abortion is murder. Murder is
wrong; therefore, abortion is wrong.
The American dream is murder. Mur-
der is wrong; yet the American dream is
right.

B. Scott, you seem confused.
Perhaps we can categorize you in
that group of people who are ready to
sacrifice the world for America.
Your American dream is insane.
Like so many other Americans, you

have picked the convenient way to
solve a problem. Why do you want to
stop the killing of children (or
fetuses) and not stop the killing of
grown people? Since you call your-
self pro-choice, does that mean you
can choose whom to save and whom
to kill?

McAlevey ought to re-dress walrus

To the Editors:

In response to Mike McAlevey’s

biguously concealing nature of
women’s winter clothing, I would like
to pose a few questions.

First, if an ‘“‘empassioned’”’ man
manages to ‘‘coerce’’ a woman to
remove all her clothing and finds her
body is no longer sexually arousing,
can he ask her to redress? Or is this
impolite for a gentleman to do?

and brain cells” on getting this far, is
it possible for him to suffer through
such a degrading experience?

-Chernenko: days numbered, professor says

After Chernenko: What’s next?

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Press accounts of the illness of
Soviet leader Konstantin U. Chernen-
ko are probably correct, meaning
that the U.S.S.R. will face major
leadership changes in the near fu-
ture, according to associate politics
Professor Craig W. McCaughrin.
McCaughrin, who joined the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty in 1981 and
holds a Ph.D. from the University of
Minnesota, has traveled in Moscow
and holds an undergraduate degree
in Russian language. He teaches a
course on the Soviet political system
and is assisting in the development of
the politics department’s planned
Moscow spring term program.

“T think he’s ill,” McCaughrin said
of Chernenko this week. “‘I think his
days are numbered. After all, he’s al-
ready living on borrowed time. The
average life expectancy for a white
male in the Soviet Union is 69. [Yuri]
Andropov died at 69. Chernenko is
73.”

“Ironically, that’s [President]
Reagan’s age,” he added. Chernenko
was born Sept. 24, 1911; the presi-
dent’s birthday was Feb. 6 of the
same year,

McCaugbhrin said that although the
Kremlin is very tight-lipped about
Chernenko’s health, the rumor mill
in Moscow provides quite a lot of use-
ful information. “Word from unof-
ficial sources travels very quickly,”
he said. “The problem is that it’s like
the old telephone game — some dis-
tortion sets in.”’

“There’s a vested interest in
convincing the West and even other
socialist states that there’s a regu-
gularized process going on,” he
pointed out.

“The party wants to retain its im-
age that it is the real locus of authori-
ty. It can’t convey any sign of weak-
ness or incompetence. If there were
no outside world, I dare say the So-
viets would still be doing this,’’ he

“the different ways that you and I go
about knowing.”’

‘‘Most of those majors are majors
with strong knowledge paradigms,”
he said. ‘‘That is far less true in the
professional fields.”’

The report, released last week, in-
cluded less data on the Medical Col-
lege Admissions Test than it did on
the LSAT because the MCAT was
revised recently and there is not
enough data for useful analysis.

Adelman said many of the report’s
findings did not surprise him.

“T read (the LSAT’s questions on
logical reasoning) and said, ‘I can

said.

“The party has to sustain as much
support as possible from the popula-
tion te get its program implemented.
If the image of the Soviet leader as
someone who is decrepit and senile
and doesn’t know what's going on
ever gets out, the party’s days would
be numbered,’’ McCaughrin added.
“If you do convey a sense of weak-
ness to the extent that there are
factions in the party you need to hold
at bay, you’re going to be removed
and be replaced by someone who can
do that.”

“‘When the image falters, you’re in
trouble,” he said. “‘Any time that
the certainty of impending doom
emerges, you're finished. That’s the
real danger of appearing sick or
weak.”

“One signal that is used now by
Westerners to gauge the fitness of So-
viet leaders is the tendency to play up
the leader in the press in order to off-
set fears of ill health or incapacita-
tion,” hesaid.

‘“‘There has been a sudden prolifer-
ation of articles by and about Cher-
nenko in the press. Westerners have
tended to interpret this as an attempt
to convey that everything is all right
and that he’s still in the driver’s
seat.”

“This happened with Andropov, so
I think that’s a reason that it’s now
used by Kremlinologists,”’ he said.

McCaughrin said a second signal is
a building down the street from the
Kremlin, the Hall of Columns, where
leaders lie in state.

“Tf there’s a lot of activity there or
they’re putting up black bunting, you
can infer that something just happen-
ed,’’ he said.

Currently a chess tournament is
being held in the building. ‘‘That's
another way that I think they’re try-
ing to throw us off the track,’’ he
said.

‘Do you take the signals as count-
er-signals?”’ he asked. ‘‘The problem
is there’s no way to confirm these
signals.”

yn right away who will do well on
this,’ "’

According to the survey, arts and
science majors will.

“Whether that tells how good a
lawyer someone will be is irrelevant
tous,’’ Adelman said.

Delos D. Hughes, chairman of
Washington and Lee’s politics
department, said the results of the
survey were surprising. But, he said,
he did not anticipate that the politics
department would institute any logic
or reasoning courses to improve
students’ LSAT scores.

“This is not considered to be a
preparatory course for law school,”
Hughes said.

‘‘Regularly I tell students that this
is not a pre-law major,’’ Hughes add-
ed. ‘‘Typically law school admissions
people say that it doesn’t matter to
them what your major is.’’

 

 

Professor Craig McCaughrin

McCaughrin was critical of recent
press reports that Chernenko may
’ have voluntarily agreed to relinquish
his position to another. ‘‘No one
bothers to check the story,”’ he said.
“They figure one source is sufficient.
“It may be that the information is
not available anywhere else, but I
don’t think any effort has been made
to disprove the story.”’

In addition, he said he had “‘pro-
found problems’’ with press reports
that this would be the first time in
Soviet history that there has been a
voluntary transfer of power.

“First of all, we have no way to
know if it’s voluntary,” he said. “It
may be that this is a very subtle coup
d’etat. By one rumor, Chernenko is in
the intensive care unit in a local Mos-
cow hospital. It may be that Chernen-
kois not ina position tosay ‘no.’ ”’

“Second, even if that is true, it is
not really the first time such a trans-
fer of power has taken place,’’ he
said, adding that he has identified
two ‘‘quasi-voluntary” transfers in
Soviet history.

“What is more significant is that
this would be the first time that a
well-established leader was replaced
without a death in office,’ he said.

Patricia Walther, the W&L law
school’s assistant dean in charge of
admissions, said the LSAT is used to
determine a student’s qualifications
in conjunction with undergraduate
grade point average, extracurricular
activities and recommendations.

‘We don’t have any major re-
quirements,’’ Walther said. “I think
a lot of different majors are going to
be good background.”

The LSAT can show how good a stu-
dent is at approaching problems fac-
ed by lawyers, said Paul Richard of
the Law School Admissions Service.
Law schools then can use curricular
achievements to determine how good
a student he is.

“Our experience has shown that
philosophy and art and engineering
majors do just as well in law school
as politics or history majors,”
Richard said.

interested in students with business
majors, who initially compete better
than students who have earned
degrees in the liberal arts. Bredin at-
tributed this to the fact that senior
managers, who value people with a
liberal arts education, are not involv-
ed in the recruitment of new employ-
ees.
Even so, students should not reject

the liberal arts in the favor of more
pre-professional courses, Bredin
said.

“Students should take advantage
of their four years here to learn as
much about our world as possible —
learn about history, philosophies and
religions,’’ Bredin said.

Students with a broad liberal arts
foundation, combined with some
knowledge of accounting, marketing
and economics, will in the long run be
more successful than those who have
acquired a strictly technical educa-
tion, Bredin said.

“Liberal arts students have a bet-

 

Com:

ter sense of what is happening in the
world, they understand political and
economic trends, they have a sense
of the wholeness of the world,” he ad-
ded. “‘It’s a very subtle thing.’’

The most important part of a
resume is its visual impact, Bredin
said, because ‘‘you have to remem-
ber that employers are looking at
thousands of resumes.”

Students also are urged to send
their resumes out early, preferably
in the late fall of their senior year. As
Bredin said, ‘‘The early bird gets the
worm.”’

Dirty Secrets

 

 

Politics Professor Craig W. Mc-
Caughrin advises against lending too
much credence to the initial events
and analysis that would follow the
death or replacement of Soviet
leader Konstantin U. Chernenko.

‘‘My advice is not to pay attention
to anything when it comes out at
first,’’ he said this week. ‘‘It’s going
to be very difficult to tell what’s hap-
pening. There’s a lot of infighting and
struggling going on that we can’t see.
The first couple of weeks and months
are essentially protocol and are not
to be taken seriously.”

Chernenko currently holds three
positions: general secretary of the
Communist Party, chairman of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
(president) and what McCaughrin
calls “generalismo of the defense
apparatus.”’

The professor said that means he
could be replaced by one, two or
three people. ‘‘The options are much
more open than most Westerners
think,” he said. ‘Initially what you
may find is three people.”

McCaughrin said the most interest-
ing question following Chernenko’s
«departure from office will be whether
he is succeeded by the much-touted
Mikhail Gorbachev, the 53-year-old
general secretary of the Communist
Party Central Committee.

“That would be unprecedented be-
cause of the age difference we’re
talking about here,” he said. ‘This
would be a really pronounced, cross-
generational change. Gorbachev is
from a whole different political
generation. He was not even a teen-
ager when World War II was taking
place.

“This would be the first time in
Soviet history that the top leadership
position would be held by someone
who has had no direct experience
with war as an adult. That's really
profound.”’

Another likely possibility to suc-
ceed Chernenko is 62-year-old Polit-
buro member Grigori Romanov, Mc-
Caughrin said, adding that Roma-
nov’s age gives him a possible edge
over Gorbachev. McCaughrin said
“longer shots’ include 71-year-old
Viktor Grishin and 80-year-old Niko-
lai Tikhonov.

“If it’s anyone outside of those, it
would be a surprise,’ he said. ‘I kind
of pooh-pooh playing the game of try-
ing to determine which of these indi-
viduals it’s going to be. They’re or-
ganization men, they all think alike
and they’re all from the same gener-
ation.”

He said two safe predictions are
that the leader will be a man, be-
cause women are allowed few leader-
ship roles in Soviet society, and that
the person will be a Russian, rather
than a Ukrainian or a Georgian, such
as Joseph Stalin.

McCaughrin said foreign minister
Andrei Gromyko is not in the running
to succeed Chernenko. ‘‘He had the
chance to assume power long ago and
did not,” he said. “‘It’s clear that he
sees himself as wanting to remain in
a state position rather than in a pri-
mary party position.”

McCaughrin said that no matter
who assumes Chernenko’s seat, ‘‘no
bold policy initiative will be under-
taken by a new leader.”

“The chance that the replacement
of one individual will affect policy
dramatically is very remote,’’ he
said, explaining that it takes some
time for the designee to consolidate a
regional power base.

By controlling the secretaries of
the regional parties, a position Mc-
Caughrin compared to that of a U.S.
governor, a Soviet leader can indi-
rectly control membership in the Po-
litburo, since the secretaries have in-
putin the selection of new members.

“Pay very careful attention not to
the top person but to the people who
are appointed to the lower-level lead-
ership positions in the first six mon-
ths,” he advised.

McCaughrin added that when he
suggests watching leadership moves,
he’s ‘‘not only talking about who’s go-
ing in, but also who’s going out.

“This is what Kremlinwatchers
and the CIA people do all the time,”
he said. “From watching these re-
cruitment changes, we can make
some inferences about who’s consoli-
dating power at the time.”

Scotching the Susann propaganda

Professor McCaughrin refers to
life within the Communist Party as
“a hermetically sealed existence’’
that individuals seldom break out of.

“The closest approximation to a
monastic order that exists in the
world today is membership in the
Communist Party,’’ he said. ‘It’s
like joining a religious cult like the
Moonies. That’s why no ruling leader
of the Communist Party has ever de-
fected.”’

“It is for that reason that I doubt
they are as cosmopolitan as they
have been alleged to be,” the profes-
sor commented. ‘‘I don’t think Cher-

nenko reads Jacqueline Susann no-
vels and drinks Scotch.”

He attributes many of the reports
of the supposedly Western attitudes
of Soviet leaders to disinformation.

“There is a division of labor within
the KGB concerned with disinforma-
tion,’’ he said. ‘‘It exists — there’s no °
doubt about it. The mission is to de-
liberately fabricate misinformation
to mislead the West.

“You feed Western reporters the
information you want them to have.
‘Disinformation’ is a neologism for
‘propoganda.’ It distributes a false
message to confuse and befuddle.”’

Biology Forum to publish journal

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

Three senior biology majors are
planning a new campus magazine
that they say will feature informed
comment in the fields of medicine,
bioethics, psychology and sociology.

The Journal of Science, which will
debut this spring, is the brainchild of
seniors Guy Caldwell, Jeff Blount
and John Long, all members of the
W&L Biology Forum,

“We think the time has come for
W&L to have an opinionated journal
dealing with current science issues,
whereas 30 years ago this might not
have been the case,’’ Caldwell said.

The three decided, Caldwell said,
that there were student resources in
the sciences that were not being tap-
ped. They then took their idea to the
Executive Committee this month and

were awarded $550 to produce the
magazine, with Caldwell, Blount and
Long serving as editors.

The Journal will have a format
similar to W&L’s Political Review. It
will be published twice a year and
consist of five or six articles, and 16
to 20 pages.

Some specific examples of topics
that might be included, Caldwell
said, are genetic engineering, Dar-
winism vs. Creationism, and the
Baby Fae case.

The magazine is soliciting manu-
scripts from students and faculty.
Papers should be about five pages
long, should be typed and should in-
clude footnotes if currently published
materials are included.

The Journal will not be overly
technical, Caldwell said. ‘‘We’re not
looking for the term projects of
science majors,”’ he said. ‘“The opin-

ions of an English major are just as
important to the magazine as those of
science majors.”’

Caldwell acknowledged that
sciences are overshadowed by other
subjects at W&L, but he did not see
this as a problem for the magazine.
‘More and more, the sciences are
overlapping with other fields,’ he
said. ‘‘Medicine, for example, is no
longer just a science but is a major
industry, and each new medical
breakthrough produces new legal
questions. I think we can expect con-
tributions from the entire campus.”’

Caldwell said he hopes to attract
attention to the sciences at W&L,
which he believes are greatly under-
rated. ‘‘Ninety percent of W&L
science majors who apply to medical
schools are accepted,’ he said.
‘‘We’re hoping that with a literary
arena to work from, we can get some
good publicity.’’

 

Phones

Many of these protests are coming in the form of
reduced gifts, such as a reduction from a $1,000 gift to a
$100 gift, McNeese said. Although there are some in-

reported that almost 95 percent of the people called

have made pledges.

There is, however, an issue on the minds of many
alumni that has had an effect on the giving. The deci-
sion for the University to go coeducational in the fall
has stirred some alumni into making what McNeese

called ‘‘little acts of protest.”’

stances of alumni eliminating their gifts because of

coeducation, ‘‘it is the exception,’’ McNeese said.

Last week, in four nights, the volunteer students ob-
tained 418 pledges for $52,080.

The money raised by the students will go into W&L’s
general budget to further the education process and
help lessen tuition increases.

Thus, according to McNeese, by participating in the

phone-a-thon, ‘“The students are helping themselves.’’

M.D. victim says
superdances are

misdirected aid

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Many people find it surprising that
not all handicapped people are pleas-
ed with projects of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association such as the
Jerry Lewis Telethon and_ this
weekend's Superdance.

One of the dissenters is Evan J.
Kemp Jr., a 1959 graduate who is ex-
ecutive director of the Disability
Rights Center in Washington. Kemp
was on campus last week when he
was initiated as an alumni member
of the national leadership fraternity
Omicron Delta Kappa.

At the ODK luncheon following the
tap ceremony, he said events such as
the Superdance are demeaning to
handicapped people because they
show them at their worst, as people
on their deathbeds.

“Most disabled people think the
Telethon should be done away with,”’
he said in an interview this week.
‘These Telethons depict the disabled
without asking the disabled.”

“Social do-gooders get their kicks
out of doing things for people, con-
trolling people,’’ he continued. ‘‘I
think the social do-gooders over 40
actually hate me.”’

The son of two founders of the
M.D.A., Kemp has been a victim of
Kugelberg-Welander syndrome, a
form of muscular dystrophy, for
most of his life and has spent most of
that time in a wheelchair.

The Disability Rights Center was
founded in 1976 by Ralph Nader.
Kemp, who lobbies for rules and
regulations favorable to the han-
dicapped, said he has spent 400 to 500
hours with President Ronald
Reagan's aides.

Kemp said he does not disapprove
of raising money to cure muscular
dystrophy. ‘I just think it can be
done ina positive way,”’ he said.

Lewis, Kemp said, is to disabled
people very much like Bull Connor is
to blacks.”’ He claimed that Lewis’

misinterpretation of the needs of the
disabled costs society $300 billion a
year in unutilized labor.

Since the inception of the M.D.A.
Telethon, the program has had about
35 poster children, Kemp said.

‘Now what has happened to
them?’’ Kemp asked. ‘‘Those people
use the children for three or four
years and then discard them. If
someone is honestly concerned with
taking care of people, then it’s hard
to take any of it seriously.”’

Kemp, who is writing a book he
plans to title ‘‘The Excluded Majori-
ty,” said that most American policy
is controlled by a group of 5-foot-10,
28-year-old white Anglo-Saxon males
in perfect mental and physical
health. He said, though, that much of
the American population-does not fit
that category.

Chris Williams, president of ODK
and chairman of the Superdance,
declined to have his committee meet
with Kemp while he was in Lexington
last week.

Williams said the committee had a
conflict with a previously planned
M.D.A. event.

“Chris’s not sitting down to talk to
me shows’’ people’s insensitivity to
the problem, Kemp said. “‘If Chris
was on a panel for nuclear disarma-
ment and I was for nuclear buildup, it
would seem he would want to share
ideas.”’

Kemp said he is trying to educate
people to another view and does not
intend to be ‘‘overly critical.”’

Williams said Kemp’s views will
not deter Superdance, “It gives us
more determination to make it a suc-
cess,’’ he said.

Kemp was ‘‘off on some state-
ments,” Williams said. He explained
that while Kemp’s efforts as a lob-
byist in Washington are admirable,
there are those who do not benefit
from such work. Williams said he
sees the Superdance as Washington
and Lee’s way of helping out.

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Every year hundreds of students
from Washington and Lee and the
surrounding women’s colleges get
together to raise money to fight
muscular dystrophy. But how many
students really know what muscular
dystrophy is or how the Muscular
Dystrophy Association is fighting
these diseases?

A research update report by Dr.
Donald Wood sheds some light on
M.D.A.’s efforts to combat these
diseases.

M.D.A., founded in 1951, is con-
cerned with 40 neuromuscular
diseases, only some of which are
muscular dystrophies. Almost half of
these diseases were identified after
M.D.A. was formed.

The most severe form of muscular
dystrophy is Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, an inherited disease that
slowly destroys the body’s muscles.
Between the ages of three and five, a
child with Duchenne muscular dys-
trophy will begin to trip and fall and
have difficulty standing up. Victims
are usually confined to a wheelchair

Domino’s car

From Staff Reports

A late night delivery Saturday has
left Domino’s Pizza without one of its
“hot boxes,’ according to Police
Chief L.O. Sutton.

The police report said a delivery
was made to 4 Lee Ave. at about 2:15
a.m. After returning to the car, the
delivery person discovered that the
box had been stolen.

 

 

by age 12.

Because the disease continues to
weaken the back muscles, it becomes
more and more difficult for the pa-
tient to even sit up ina wheelchair.

‘The spine starts to twist and
collapse — the young patient takes on
a hunched-over position. Further
weakening can cause the spine to
twist, leading to a twisted, hunched-
over position known as the pretzel-
shape. As muscles in the hand
disintegrate, the fingers take on a
claw-like appearance and painful
contractures develop in hands and
feet alike,’’ Wood writes in the
report.

Although the life span of victims of
Duchenne dystrophy is increasing,
that life span still is only 21-23 years.
M.D.A. doctors are employing new
surgical techniques, physical
therapy, new prosthetic devices and
better bracing procedures to
alleviate these secondary problems
of Duchenne victims.

M.D.A.-funded doctors also are
working on treatments for other
diseases such as myasthenia gravis
and ALA, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. Dr. Peter Dau used M.D.A.
funds to develop plasmapheresis, a

Sutton asked that the box be
returned if this was an attempt at a

Also last weekend, a female visitor
to Zeta Beta Tau fraternity had two
of her tires punctured between 1 a.m.
and 1:30 a.m. Sunday after parking
her car behind the house.

Sutton said there have been no ar-
rests in either incident.

treatment that can save the lives of
myasthenia gravis patients. And
M.D.A. funds helped W. King Engel
discover that the hormone TRH could
provide ALS sufferers with tem-
porary relief from that disease that
destroys the spinal nerves.

M.D.A. is also financing genetic
research into diseases such as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy in
order to identify the genetic protein
deficiency that causes the disease
and perhaps achieve a major
breakthrough toward a cure. This
genetic research is expensive. Wood
estimates that the cost of the genetic
research will require M.D.A. to raise
“virtually double what we've been
raising.”’

M.D.A. is almost the only organiza-
tion fighting neuromuscular diseases
in America today. No university or
medical school in the country has a
department dedicated to muscle

‘Winging it’
with WLUR’s
Rock-a-thon

By ANTHONY CORNEALIUS
Staff Reporter

 

In conjunction with this weekend’s
Muscular Dystrophy Association Su-
perdance, Washington and Lee jun-
iors Cotton Puryear and Mike Stach-
ura will present a 30-hour request
Rock-a-thon on WLUR-FM. The
Rock-a-thon will begin tomorrow at 8
p.m. and run through Sunday at 2

a.m.

The two, described by Stachura as
“kinda ‘off’ guys,”’ will initiate their
attack by asking listeners to donate
one dollar each time they make a re-
quest.

Puryear, a three-year veteran ‘of
WLUR and photography editor of
The Ring-tum Phi, said this is the
second annual Rock-a-thon, which is
designed to ‘‘have a lot of fun raising
a lot of money.”

He said preparation for the gig will
be minimal. “It’s a wing-it week-
end,”’ he said.

Activities scheduled include live
remote broadcasts from the student
activities pavilion, guest appear-
ances by Puryear and Stachura at
the Superdance and various off-the-
wall antics over the air.

Both say they think they are offer-
ing ‘publicity and an an alternative
during non-Superdance time,’’ Pur-
year said.

“People are going to look for some-
thing else to do that weekend and we
figure they can party and listen to the
radio,” added Stachura, sports editor
of The Ring-tum Phi, who also has
been on WLUR since his freshman
year.

The two are hoping to get donations
from people who might not have been
approached from the Superdance
groups.

“Superdance is geared toward
W&L, VMI and the women’s colleges
and not toward the people of Lexing-
ton,’ Puryear said. ‘‘We’re hoping
they will be listening and donate.”

The origin of their musical on-
slaught was the Mockin-Rockin
weekend during the 1984 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention.

formation that he then passed on
to the special grand jury.

In a six-page response, Read
said the Pack motion, filed by
Lexington attorney Thomas C.
Spencer, was ‘‘a_ politically
motivated attack against the en-
tire drug investigation and
against me personally.”’

Both motions were included
with a report on Read’s conduct
that the local bar association sent
to the Virginia State Bar late last
year.

Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III
of Staunton appointed Nance on
Jan. 23. Read signed a statement
at the bottom of the motion that
said, “I ask for this.”’

Henrico County is part of the
Richmond suburbs.

Laughlin, who taught at the Wash-

1940 until his retirement in 1977, died
Tuesday in Lexington at the age of 77.

Laughlin specialized in teaching
evidence, labor law, administrative
law and jurisprudence. He was
known as an authority in labor ar-
bitration.

He graduated first in his law class
at George Washington University
and went on to obtain a master’s
degree in law from Harvard and the
J.S.D., the legal equivalent of a
Ph.D., from the University of
Chicago. He then practiced law and
taught political science before join-
ing the W&L faculty.

A 1982 publication of the University
Press of Virginia titled ‘Legal
Education in Virginia, 1779-1979”
contains a major contribution by
Laughlin.

Zone change A

for new dorm
recommended

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee passed the
first checkpoint on the road to the
construction of a new dormitory
Thursday, when the Lexington Plan-
ning Commission unanimously
recommended that City Council
establish a new institutional zone to
encompass the land owned by the two
universities.

Present city zoning regulations will
not permit the construction of a dor-
mitory on land owned by W&L. The
University’s other dormitories were
“‘grandfathered in’’ when the present
zoning regulations were established.

Acting on the recommendation of
City Manager John V. Doane, the
commission approved only the con-
cept of a new institutional zone. A
consultant will be hired to draw up
the specifications for the new zone.

The commission also approved
Doane’s proposal that the specifica-
tions for the new zone include provi-
sions allowing for ‘reasonable site
plan review”’ of changes made in the
property within 100 feet of streets and
other zones.

Before the new zone becomes legal,
City Council must hold public hear-
ings on the proposed change and ap-
prove the measure.

Fred Cox, an architect for the
University, told the planning com-
mission that it should be careful that
the site plan review provision does
not become a form of harassment.
Cox said minor changes should be
reviewed at the staff level, while ma-
jor changes could be reviewed care-
fully by the commission.

Although all of Virginia Military
Institute’s land would be included in
the new institutional zone, it would be
under no obligation to abide by the ci-
ty ordinances because it is a state in-
stitution, Cox added.

In the public hearing held before
the commission’s recommendation,
three Lexington residents expressed
concerns about the effect a new dor-
mitory near the corner of Washing-
ton and Nelson streets would have on
adjacent homes. The residents em-
phasized that their concerns should
not be interpreted as ‘‘opposition.”’

“I would like to express a degree of
moderate concern based on a lack of
information,’’ said David B. Dickens,
a W&L professor and a resident of the
neighborhood near the proposed dor-
mitory site.

“IT generally agree with the pro-
posal. But I’m very much concerned
with the specifics,”’ said Brig. Gen.
Tobias R. Philbin Jr.

W&L President John D. Wilson

 

From Staff Reports

 

A bill to raise the legal drinking
age in Virginia to 21 seems on its
way to approval by the Virginia
General Assembly, although the
House of Delegates added a minor
snag yesterday.

During debate on the bill, the
House, by a 51-43 vote, tacked on
an amendment stating that Vir-
ginia will raise the drinking age to
21 only if the federal goverment
raises the drinking age on milita-
ry bases to 21.

A similar amendment, recom-
mended by a Senate committee,
failed in the full Senate, which ap-
proved the drinking age increase
Tuesday by a 29-11 vote. Tues-
day’s action marked the first time*
the Senate had approved such a
bill.

The House gave preliminary
approval to the bill with the

 

replied that the University has not
yet asked the architects to draw up
precise plans because the University
could not be sure about obtaining the
land for the proposed dormitory site
and the legal right to construct a
dorm. Wilson added that the corner
of Nelson and Washington ‘‘is not one
of the most attractive”’ areas in town.

“We hope to build an attractive
facility,”’ Wilson said.

One of the specifics that concerned
Philbin is possible parking problems
in the area. Philbin asked that the
University provide one parking
space per student and that provisions
be made so that students would not
cause a traffic jam when loading or
unloading possessions.

Cox said the architects would try to
be sensitive to some of the com-
plaints raised by the residents. He
said that the dormitory could be con-
structed so that loading and
unloading would take place on the in-
side of the block and not on Nelson
Street.

Doane said that the city would
place limits on parking and traffic
when it drew up the specifications for
the new dormitory.

Dickens said he was concerned
about the precise location of the dor-
mitory. He said he hoped that the
Ackerly house, directly across
Nelson Street from his house, would
be preserved.

Frank Parsons, executive assis-
tant to Wilson, replied that the
University probably would build the
new dormitory ‘“‘down toward the ug-
ly corner.” But the Ackerly property
might be needed if a second phase of
development were required some-
time in the future, Parsons added.

‘We wouldn’t want to promise
preservation of the Ackerly house,”’
Parsons said.

However, Wilson added that if ad-
ditional expansion were needed in the
next century, the natural location for
more housing would be up Washing-
ton Street toward Gilliam Dormitory.
At present, there are two private pro-
perty owners on that land who are not
interested in selling their land to the
University, Wilson noted. But the
property owners’ reluctance to sell
might change in the distant future, he
added.

Anne Philbin, wife of Tobias
Philbin, said she was concerned
about how much blasting would be
required during the construction of a
new dormitory. She said blasting can
damage property in nearby homes.

Cox said he did not think a building
the size of the dormitory would need
such a deep foundation that it would
require a lot of blasting.

Legal drinking age of 21

voice vote yesterday, and a final
vote was scheduled today.

The bills in the two houses also

then to210n Oct. 1, 1986.

Similar bills have failed in past
years, but the General Assembly
this year is faced with a federal
government threat to reduce high-
way funding to states that have
not adopted a drinking age of 21 by
October 1986.

Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb
has said he would sign a bill rais-
ing the drinking age to 21.

Jerry Darrell, food services

age of 21 could seriously damage
business in the Cockpit and

“Whistleblower” A. Ernest Fitzgerald, University Librarian Maurice D.

of Fitzgerald’s papers donated to the library. One of Fitzgerald’s reasons for
donating the papers to W&L was the presence of Mollenhoff, who served as

‘Whistleblower’ gives
documents to library

A. Ernest Fitzgerald, who made
headlines during the 1970s as the
most famous contemporary ‘‘whis-
tleblower,’’ has donated his papers to
the University Library.

Fitzgerald was fired by the Air
Force in 1969 after citing cost over-
runs of about $2 billion on the C5A jet
transport plane being constructed by
Lockheed. At the time, it was written
that Fitzgerald’s sin was ‘‘commit-
ting truth before Congress.’’ He was
reinstated after a 15-year battle in
the courts and currently works as
management systems deputy in the
office of the secretary of the Air
Force.

The papers donated by Fitzgerald
to the library chronicle his long court
fight and include depositions of
former President Richard M. Nixon
and high officials of the last five ad-
ministrations. Other documents are
trial transcripts, related Congres-
sional hearings and other govern-

papers to Washington and Lee, in
part, because of his association with
W&L journalism Professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff. As ombudsman in the
Nixon White House, Mollenhoff was a
leading critic of the decision to fire
Fitzgerald and later covered the
Fitzgerald case for the Des Moines
Tribune.

“I became convinced that placing
these papers in the Washington and
Lee library would ensure their best
use,” Fitzgerald said. ‘I know that
Professor Mollenhoff continues to
take a great interest in this area and
am certain that he and his students
will make good use of them.

“In addition, I found that the
University Library is a very good
library for historical documents, but
these materials will not get lost in the
crush of thousands of miscellaneous
documents as might be the case in
some other libraries.”’

Will W&L women face chilly climate?

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

When the first female undergraduates enter
Washington and Lee next fall, the University will
face what two recent studies indicate will be a
major challenge of providing a campus and
classroom environment that is equally beneficial
to men and women.

The two studies, ‘‘The Classroom Climate: A
Chilly One for Women?” and ‘‘Out of the
Classroom: A Chilly Campus Climate for
Women?’’, describe various forms of discrimina-
tion women still encounter on college campuses
today. Both were prepared by the Project on the
Status and Education of Women.

Associate Dean of the College Pamela Simpson,
who chairs the Coeducation Steering Committee,
said that committee members have read the
reports and received information from the Pro-
ject on Women regarding other subjects.

“Basically, what’s in those documents is true,”’
Simpson said.

Some of the problems women encountered at
other schools will arise at W&L, and others will
not, Simpson added. She said the small size of
W&L should enable it to avoid some of the pro-
blems encountered by other universities.

W&L might also have an advantage over other
universities in addressing problems facing
women because W&L will be more willing to
change policies that are harmful to women, while

other schools may be set in theif ways; Simpson”

explained.
“We'll be more willing to question our assump-

» tions about women. We'll be teaching them for

the first time,’’ she added.

Bernice R. Sandler, executive director of the
Project on Women, said that W&L would face
some special problems in providing a beneficial
environment for women because it is just in-
tegrating.

The students at W&L now came to the school
expecting it to be all-male, Sandler said, and
might look at the women students as outsiders.

Sandler said that at a few all-male schools that

went coed, this resentment against the first
women spawned acts of overt hostility. A suppor-
tive and responsive attitude by the top ad-
ministrators toward the women students seems
to be crucial in limiting such hostility, she added.

Simpson said the Coeducation Steering Com-
mittee is addressing many of the problems that
could arise at W&L. But when a problem arises
that was not anticipated, the administration has
to be ready to respond and act on that problem,
she added.

Another problem Sandler anticipates arising in
the first few years of coeducation at W&L is that
some of the men may not be used to treating
women as equals and fellow students. They might
be thinking of the women solely as potential
dates, she explained.

“The world is changing, and men and women
are going to have to work together,’’ she said.
“It’s a disservice to both men and women if they
don’t learn to treat each other as equals.”’

Another problem could arise, Simpson said,
because in W&L’s first few coed classes, the
women as a group probably will be brighter than
the men because a smaller percentage of women
will be admitted. Some men may believe the no-
tion that bright women cannot be good-looking,
Simpson warned. Not only is this a myth, but at
most colleges with unbalanced ratios between
men and women, bright women do not have trou-
ble getting dates despite the existence of that
myth, she added.

In the ‘classroom, however, the Project on
Women studies indicate that a concerted effort is
needed to erase some of the disadvantages
women face. Faculty members may either in-
advertently or overtly treat men and women dif-
ferently in class, say Roberta M. Hall and
Sandler in their paper on the classroom environ-
ment.

‘*’..[T]hese patterns, by which women students
are either singled out or ignored because of their
sex, may leave women students feeling less confi-
dent than their male classmates about their
abilities. . .,’’ the report states.

‘“‘Both men and women faculty — even those

who are most concerned about sex discrimination
— may inadvertently communicate to their
students limiting preconceptions about ap-
propriate and expected behaviors, abilities,
career directions and personal goals which are
based on sex rather than on individual interest
and ability,” the paper’s authors argue.

Some of the ways professors inadvertently
discriminate against women in the classroom are
by doing such things as consistently asking
women simple, factual questions while reserving
the tougher theoretical questions for men and by
interrupting women more frequently than men,
the report states.

According to the authors, professors also tend
to make more eye contact with male students
than with female students and assume an atten-
tive posture when listening to a male student
while doing something such as staring at a clock
when a woman talks.

“A lot of this behavior is not deliberate and
mean,’ Sandler said. “‘It can be changedif~
become aware of it.’’

The report cites other, more obvious examples
of behavior that can have a negative effect on
women students such as the use of sexist humor
or demeaning sexual comments,

Male students also are harmed by discrim-
inatory treatment of female students, the authors
argue. Men’s stereotypical beliefs about women
are reinforced when a person of authority such as
a professor makes a comment demeaning
women, the authors say.

“This may make it more difficult for men to
perceive women students as full peers, to work
with them in collaborative learning situations,
and to offer informal support as colleagues...,”’
the authors comment in the report.

In the Project’s paper on the climate for women
outside the classroom, the authors report that
professors often direct women into fields of study
or majors that ‘‘are seen as ‘appropriate’ for
women.”

Professors should be careful that they give the
same kind of career advice to male and female
students of similar abilities, Simpson said.

EC studies library, exams, calendar

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The 24-hour open library policy
was endorsed by the Executive Com-
mittee at its meeting Monday night.
The EC also approved a $100 donation
to the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion Superdance and discussed resub-
mitting the open exam proposal.

In an 11-0 vote, the committee ap-
proved the following motion: ‘‘The
EC supports the 24-hour open exam
policy.”

EC Vice President James White
said he thought the EC should let the
faculty library committee know it
was against closing the library from
la.m. to8a.m.

Senior representative Dave Jonson
suggested giving this weekend’s
Superdance $100.

“Should we hand out the student
tax like that?”’ asked White.

Following some discussion about
students’ giving money out of their
own pockets and fraternities’ making

donations, the EC voted 10-1 in favor

of the motion. Junior representative
Pat Hayden was opposed.

In other business, Jonson mention-
ed that he planned to reintroduce the
open exam policy to the faculty in
March. The proposal, which would
allow students to take exams without
scheduling them in advance, was
defeated by one vote in a faculty
meeting last year.

“It’s become a huge monster of a
thing, as it’s always been,”’ said Jon-
son, who explained that the proposal
will go to the faculty EC and the
Faculty Discussion Committee be-
fore a faculty vote is taken. Jonson
said he has talked to department
heads and other professors, many of
whom want to see a uniform exam
policy with some educational benefit.

“The logistics is not really a pro-
blem, according to the faculty,’’ Jon-
son said.

Jonson also mentioned that copies
of an alternative calendar were pass-
ed out at last week’s faculty EC

meeting and should be discussed
Monday. The calendar, composed of
five six-week units, was presented to
the ad hoc committee by psychology
Professor David G. Elmes and was
included in the committee’s report to
the faculty.

Junior representative Michael
Black reported that the Speidel,
Goodrich and Goggin fundraiser for
the United Way, proposed for Feb. 8
in the Cockpit, has been rescheduled
for March 14. The conflict came up

after the band announced it will be
recording an album in February.

The Hockey Club reported that it
expects a net loss for tne year of
$220.50. The EC agreed to cover the
entire amount with money from its
reserve fund.

The EC did not vote on the pronos-
ed voting regulations, but sophomore
representative Andrew Caruthers
noted that seven people already have
applied to serve on the Voting
Regulations Board.

W&L grapplers dominate College Invite

Three wins improve record to 9-2-1

 

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team easily retained its W&L College
Invitational title last Saturday, plac-
ing eight of 10 wrestlers in the finals
and emerging with five individual
champions.

The grapplers also raised their
recorc to 9-2-1 Wednesday evening
with victories over Newport News,
Virginia State and host Lynchburg.

The grapplers overwhelmed the
host Hornets, 51-6. They also topped
Newport News Apprentice by a 38-9
count and Virginia St., 30-18.

In the evening’s opening match,
Steve Castle at 118 lbs. squeezed out
an 11-10 victory over Lynchburg’s
Stuart Shelton. The Generals then
racked up four forfeit wins to take a
commanding 27 -0 early lead. Fresh-
man Mark Moore was stopped at 158

Jeff Dixon showed he was fully recovered from knee
surgery earlier this month in earning a 2-1 victory over

Ibs., but Win Phillips came back for
the Generals to post a fall at 167 to
maintain W&L’s 27-point margin at
33-6. Three more forfeit victories
ended the scoring at 51-6, just five
points short of the Generals highest
match point total ever.

Against Apprentice, the Generals
split the first two bouts with Castle
getting a forfeit win and Brian Lif-
sted losing by fall at 126 lbs. At 134
Ibs., Jeff Mazza won a 10-3 decision
and Larry Anker (142|bs.) took a ma-
jor decision with an 18-6 tally to put
the Generals up 14-6.

At 150 lbs., Kevin McNamara lost
by decision, but W&L fought back
with three wins in a row from Greg
Russell (158 Ibs.), Phillips and Joe
O'Neill (177 Ibs.), who recorded the
the Generals’ only fall of the match.
A pair of forfeit victories from cap-
tain Jeff Dixon (190 lbs.) and senior
heavyweight Mark Weaver closed
the scoring for the match.

The Ring-tum Phi

The Generals’ final match proved
to be the toughest, but W&L got a
strong performance from the middle
of its lineup to secure the team vic-
tory.

Castle started things off in fine
fashion for the Generals with a pin at
118, and Lifsted followed with a 9-7
win at 126 to give W&L the early
jump at9-0.

A loss by Mazza closed the Gener-
als’ margin to five, but wins from
Anker (142) and McNamara (150)
and a pin from Russell at 158 gave the
Generals a 22-4 advantage.

VSU made it close at the end, re-
cording a fall at 167 and a default win
at heavyweight, but a win from
O’Neill (177) and a tie from Dixon at
190 sewed things up for W&L. Dixon’s
tie at 190 was his first regular season
non-win since the 1982-83 season.

The Generals’ default at heavy-
weight was due to an ankle injury to

scheduling events, managing the
budget and recommending policy
and procedures relative to the opera-
tion of all women’s athletic activities.

Prior to her current position in
California, Rankin became familiar
with the W&L athletic department as
an assistant professor of physical
education at Dabney S. Lancaster
Community College in Clifton Forge
from June 1978 to September 1982.
During that time part of her respon-
sibilities included teaching
whitewater canoeing classes for
W&L students.

Ranking also chaired the depart-
ment of physical education and was
head women’s basketball coach at
Clifton Forge High School from
August 1974 to June 1978. In 1975 and
1976 her teams were runners-up in
the state tournament and _ she
directed the team to three District
championships. In 1976 and 1978 she
was selected ‘‘Coach of the Year’’ in
women’s basketball by the Virginia
High School League. Her three-year
coaching record at Clifton Forge was
41-4.

Before moving to Virginia, Rankin,
an Arcata native, directed the
physical education at El Cerrito High
School from August 1971 to June 1974.
At that time, she also served as
basketball, volleyball, tennis and
track coach.

Rankin, 36, is a 1970 graduate of
Humboldt State with a B.A. degree in
physical education and Spanish. She
also holds an M.A. degree in physical
education from Humboldt State.

The athletic department has de-
veloped a set of projections for the
formation of the women’s program,
but those projections remain uncer-
tain since much will depend upon the
patterns of interest shown by the
women who enter W&L in the fall.

Weaver. ‘‘We hope it’s nothing
severe,”’ assistant coach Rolf Pira-
nian said.

At Saturday’s College Invitational,
W&L easily outdistanced runners-up
Elon and Hampden-Sydney. The
Generals came away with top team
honors at 109 1/2 points to Elon’s 78
and the Tigers’ 48 1/2.

“I felt. the majority performed to
their potential (in the tournament),”’
said Coach Gary Franke, the win-
ningest wrestling coach in W&L his-
tory. While Franke termed the tour-
nament victory ‘‘a fine team effort,’’
it was the heavier weights that pro-
duced the biggest wins.

The Generals earned first-place
honors at heavyweight, 190, 177 and
167. Weaver used two pins to claim
the heavyweight title, while Dixon
earned a 2-1 victory over Hampden-
Sydney’s Allen Blow for the 190 title.
Blow defeated Dixon last year at the
Eastern Regional championships.

O’Neill got a stern test from his
own teammate, Greg Kendrick, at
177 before winning the championship.
Kendrick was competing on the Gen-
erals ‘‘A’’ Team, a group composed
of extra W&L wrestlers that event-
ually came away with sixth-place
honors in the seven-team meet.

Phillips got a couple of falls on his
way to the 167 title bout where he up-
set top-seeded Rhinehardt Grey of
Pfeiffer, 12-6.

The Generals also got a champion-
ship performance from Mazza, who
recorded a pin in the title match at
134 Ibs.

Finalists for W&L were Lifsted
(126), McNamara (150) and Russell
(158), who fell to the top seed. Castle
(118) and Anker (142) earned third-
place honors.

On Saturday, the Generals will
travel to the City of Brotherly Love
for the LaSalle Triangular. On tap for
W&L are bouts with the host Explor-
ers and the University of Scranton, a
team the Generals finished ahead of
in December’s W&L Invitational,
where the Generals finished third.

After the triangular on Saturday,
the Generals have a dual meet on
Feb. 9 against Longwood, and then
begin preparing for NCAA Eastern
Regionals at Trenton State (N.J.)
University Feb. 14-16.

 

 

...And what does this man know

January 31, 1985

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

Last week one of the major
stories in Washington and Lee
sports was the return of senior
captain Jeff Dixon to the wrestl-
ing team. The headline read,
“Dixon Back,’’ but what was the
big deal?

The big deal was that on Jan. 3,
Dixon underwent arthroscopic
surgery on his right knee at home
in Oklahoma. On Jan. 21 he work-
ed out with the team and on Jan.
23 he was back in action wrestling
ina meet and winning.

Arthroscopic surgery is not a
new technique. It has been around
for more than 50 years and was
first used in Japan in 1934. But ar-
throscopic surgery is not like nor-
mal surgery, there is no ‘‘cutting
open” and it takes less time to
heal. Instead of using a scalpel the
doctor will use an arthroscope,
a pen-shaped instrument that
weighs about six ounces.

The arthroscope is hooked up to
a monitor.

The doctor then places the ar-
throscope into the patient’s knee
and views the internal part of the
knee on the screen. The surgery is
done by making five or six inci-
sions around the problem area
and watching the monitor. The ar-
throscope has ‘‘snippers’’ on the
end of it so that the doctor can cut
or remove any scar tissue or bone

fragments.
After the surgery, there is no
long scar — just small stab

wounds — and the patient needs to
stay in the hospital only one night.

In professional sports, arthro-
scopic surgery has become a nor-
mal practice. For example, Wal-
ter Payton of the Chicago Bears
had arthroscopic surgery during
the past season and played two
weeks later. Many doctors believe
that two weeks is pushing the
recovery time.

“T wait 10 days before going in
because a lot of surgery isn’t

...back on top again.

needed,’’ said Dr. Frank Mc-
Mains. ‘‘But most surgeons deal-
ing with college and professional
athletes will have the athlete un-
der the arthroscope in two days.”’

For Dixon it was different.

“He (the Doctor) wasn’t knife
happy at all. I had to talk him into
it; he wanted to wait,’’ Dixon said.

McMains explained that the gla-
mour of arthroscopic surgery lies
in its safety, its less expensive
cost and — as has been seen — its
faster recovery time. Most pa-
tients are young and in excellent
physical condition and dedicated
to training.

“T really didn’t lose strength,”
Dixon said. ‘‘But I did lose flexa-
bility because of swelling. I was
only on crutches for three days, I
was really amazed.”’

The question still remains, ‘‘Is
arthroscopic surgery done too
much and does it allow enough re-
covery time?”’

In an informal survey of 10 sur-
geons, six said ‘‘yes,’’ and four
said ‘‘no.”’ It’s a hard question to
answer, but certainly Jeff Dixon,
6-0-1 since he’s been back, and
Walter Payton, the NFL’s all-time
leading rusher, aren’t complain-
ing.

Examining the root
of academic problem

...Well, on to more inane com-

TIME _ mentary and restating the obvious,

but hey, I only hope I can become a

Gas... good idea again. This week some-

thing worthy of consideration comes

from our stately neighbors in

Maryland. Seems Prince George’s

County has set down a rule where

high school student-athletes
must maintain a C average or lose athletic eligibility.

Applause, applause. Yet some coaches and players are griping.
“‘T’m nervous. I’m real nervous about seeing those report cards,” said
one boys’ hoops coach. “I’m going to have some who are real close,”
he continues. ‘‘Running for a championship like I am, we could end up
going down the tubes.”’ Like I am, coach? But then, I guess only a
misguided high school coach could have ‘‘I’’ and “We’”’ refer to the
same thing in the same sentence.

Point is, for too long high schools have become athlete manufac-
turers for the colleges rather than people producers. A silly distinc-
tion, yet one that has to be viewed realistically. The typical scenario
goes like this: Joe All-World Prep slides through high school with
bloated ideas of superstardom and no concept of algebra and history,
not to mention your occasional functional illiterate. If Joe’s college of
choice has some entrance requirements, like whether you can tell the
difference between your headline in the sports pages and somebody
else’s headline, then Joe goes to junior college where eventually, if
he’s good enough (that’s court-wise and perhaps a little bit academic-
wise), he’ll go on to the big-time and play for somebody equally
academically sound, say Georgetown. As the story goes, well, you
know what they say, the mind is a terrible thing to waste, that is,
unless he can fill it up from outside.

The root of the problem lies in high school. PG’s idea is long over-
due, If young people are force-fed the idea that basketball and football
are only and ultimately going to take you as far as hopscotch, perhaps
there is hope that we can do away with such inane — this is almost as
inane as I am, but not quite — ideas as the 700rule. The problem
is not that college athletes aren’t capable of also being students. It’s
just that they were never asked to be anything more than cagers or
gridders in high school, and hence they don’t want to do any more in
college, and usually they don’t have to.

It is asad commentary on the people entrusted with young people —
like coaches are — when they become upset about academic
guidelines. But the result is even more lamentable. Let us hope that
while we’re forcing the kids to get an education, some of the misguided
and glory-seeking high school coaches learn a thing or two....

...On the Colonnade for some more inane commentary, barring any
more inexplicable ODAC episodes, the General cagers should battle
for second place in the conference next Saturday in Roanoke. (Em-
phasis on first part of sentence.) Not a must win, but would be nice,
heading into the rapidly approaching conference tournament... Tip of
the cap to the General grapplers on their championship performance
Saturday. They also got a fine showing of their depth with the
mysterious ‘‘A Team.” And while we're on the topic, let’s give
Heavyweight Mark Weaver the Herculean Task of the Month Award
for winning not only his weight class but defeating a couple of
behemoths whose combined weight was comparable to a herd of
bison....Early warning note: Lacrosse will start off season with Duke,
UNC, Maryland and U.Va....

.,. remember making some inane comment a couple of weeks back
about Georgetown possibly losing a few conference games, but then I
was just naturally making a fool of myself.....More on (or is it moron)
college hoops: don’t know what the problem is with Bob Knight at In-
diana, benching Steve Alford and leaving a couple of seniors home in
Indiana for Sunday’s loss at Illinois. I’ve heard of shaking up the
lineup, but I think Bob’s overstepped the bounds of logic this time.
Some say he’s starting to crack (as in “‘up’’)....1 wonder...Maryland
will play 41 games by tournament time....and look it..

ee Finally, Marvin Hagler says ‘‘It’s still the love of the game”’ that
keeps him boxing. Yeah, right. At $5.1 million a pop, I might learn to
love self-mutilation, too.....

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team snatched victory from the
jaws of defeat against Emory and
Henry and crushed traditional rival
Hampden-Sydney in winning two Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
games last week, both at the Warner
Center.

The victories improved the Gener-
als’ record to 11-7 (5-3 in the ODAC)
and moved W&L into a second-place
tie with Roanoke in the conference
standings.

Senior Scott Shannon connected on
a 15-foot turnaround jump shot on the
baseline with only :06 left on the
clock to give the Generals a come-
from-behind 58-56 victory against the
E&H Wasps Thursday night.

Lex Fitzenhagen was the high scor-
er for the Generals with 16 points;
Shannon led the squad i in rebounding
with seven.

The Generals held E&H, the sixth
highest NCAA Division III scoring
team in the nation and the ODAC’s
highest scoring seam at nearly 84
tallies an outing, to only 56 points.
The Generals did not stop the Wasps’
team leader Kevin Brown, who scor-
ed 19 points (7-8 from the floor and 5-5
at the line). Brown is the nation’s
fourth leading scorer and on top of
the ODAC individual scoring with a
points per game average of 26.1.

Neither team was able to build a
substantial lead in the first half.
Although E&H led 26-21 with six-and-
a-half minutes to go before intermis-
sion, the Generals managed to cut
the lead to one point at halftime,
30-29.

W&L opened the second half by out-
scoring the Wasps 6-0 and taking a
35-30 lead. The Generals maintained
a 43-39 lead with 13:30 left in the
game when Shannon hit two free
throws after a technical foul was
whistled on the E&H bench.

Perhaps inspired by the technical,
E&H, led by Brown, made a run at
the Generals midway through the
period and held a 51-48 lead when
Brown scored a basket with 7:35 re-
maining. E&H led 56-52 with less than
3 1/2 minutes to play, but would not
score againinthe game.

The Generals’ pressing defense led toa couple of easy
baskets in the second half of W&L’s 71-52 victory over
Hampden-Sydney. Here Mike Hudson (10), Kevin Me-

The Generals quickly cut into the
lead. Mike Hudson, senior guard, hit
one free throw to cut the lead to 56-53.
Fred Bissinger’s 10-foot jumper in
the lane after a steal brought W&L
within a point. Another steal by Gen-
eral sophomore forward Jeff Harral-
son led to a breakaway foul that sent
Fitzenhagen to the charity stripe for
two shots. He hit one of two to knot
the game at 56.

The Wasps had the ball. and a
chance to take the lead with less than
two minutes to play when Brown
missed his first shot of the game at
the 1:57 mark. The Generals controll-
ed the rebound and the ball for the
next 1:51 leading up to Shannon’s
winning basket.

Head coach Verne Canfield said
that he had not called a play that
required the 6-5 senior captain to
take the last shot.

“T do not like to set the final shot

for any player. It’s too much pres-
sure,’’ he said.

The Generals’ mentor cited the
play of Fitzenhagen, Hudson, Bis-
singer and Harralson as contributing
to the victory.

Canfield’s team gave their coach a
team performance in reversing a late
November 91-76 loss to Hampden-
Sydney on Monday night when the
Generals defeated the Tigers, 71-52.

“After the first game, we wanted to
show them that we are a team with
identity and chemistry,’’ Canfield
said

The Generals displayed their
chemistry when they jumped to a
quick 8-0 lead in the opening stages of
the game. With 14:51 remaining in
the first half, Harralson made an ex-
cellent feed under the basket to Har-
men Harden, who scored to push the
Generals’ margin to 10 points at 12-2.
The Tigers played the Generals even

for the remainder of the half, event-
ually cutting the deficit to seven at:
30-23 when the first half buzzer
sounded.

The Generals opened the anna
half in much the same fashion as they
did at the beginning of the game by
racing to an 18-7 second-half spurt
that put them in front, 48-30. Thé
Tigers never made a serious run at
the Generals’ large lead.

The Generals built their lead and
held it throughout the second stanza
by capitalizing on numerous H-SC
turnovers and defensive steals. W&L
scored 13 times on 18 possessions
following defensive steals for a 72
percent steal conversion rate.

Leading scorers for the Generals
were Fitzenhagen, for the second
time in as many outings, who had 17
points, and Shannon, who contributed
16 points toward the winning effort.

Looking back on the meet, the
Generals (5-1) are not upset with
their performance, but rather are
pleased.

“I was happy with the way we
swam. We worked toward some goals
all week in practice and we came up
with our share of first-place finishes
(five) against a very good Division I
team,” said W&L aquatics coach
Page Remillard.

Remillard was especially pleased
with the performances of senior Bob-
by Pearson and freshmen Simon
Perez and Eric Sullivan.

Pearson finished third in the 200-
yard freestyle (1:44.01), second in
the 100-yard-freestyle (48.74) and
was a member of the winning 400-
yard freestyle relay (3:17.71). Pear-
son’s time might have been even bet-
ter if it hadn’t been for the flu that he
caught during the week.

“T was suprised with how well I
swam. By Friday I was really drag-
ging,’’ said Pearson.

Coach Remillard referred to Pear-
son’s performance as ‘“‘real gutsy.”
But it wasn’t just Pearson who was
“‘gutsy,’’ the whole team was. The
divers for example, had to drive to
James Madison early in the day to
compete and finish in second in the
one-meter and had a second and
third-place finish in the three meter.

Then there was the 400-yard free
relay team. They had upset John
Hopkins earlier in the season and
were once again underdogs against
James Madison. But last week Tim
Stanford said they ‘‘were not going to
roll over and die.”’

Indeed, they didn’t. They won in-
stead.

For a spectator, which there were
quite a few because of the I.M. swim-
ming meet, one of the most exciting
moments was the 1,000-yard free-
style. It was shocking to see James
Madison's three men line up opposed
by Washington and Lee’s one man
—Eric Sullivan.

“I knew Eric would do well, so I
decided to send him alone so that his
performance would be noticed and to
get the crowd into the meet. He didn’t
only win — he beat them,” said
Remillard.

Sullivan won the 1,000-yard free-
style in 10:14.31 and the 500-yard
freestyle in 4:56.18.

“The team looks great, everyone
did what they were supposed to do,”
Stanford said. ‘“‘The loss doesn’t af-
fect the team. We’re psyched about
how well we did. James Madison is
behind us and now we have Gettys-
burg.”’

Gettysburg is a Division III team
that Pearson feels they should beat.
But they are viewing the meet in the
same way they did in preparing for
Frostburg and Georgetown dual
meets two weeks ago.

“It’s a lot like the Frostburg meet,
we should win but we can’t afford to
make the same mistake, we need a
full effort,’’ Pearson said.

MUSICNOTES

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

 

Hats off to the Student Activities
Board for two successful major rock
and roll presentations within a week
— here’s hoping the trend continues.
Ramones’ fans no doubt enjoyed the
show, but the majority of the au-
dience must have been scratching
their heads and wondering what
makes them so good. The sound was
terrible, and can only partly be blam-
ed on the poor acoustics of the W&L
aircraft hangar; the Strangers’
sound man gave them a loud and
clean sound. Judging by the high
standards set by Too Tough To Die,
the Ramones’ latest studio effort, I
expected more concern for the live
sound.

I also thoroughly enjoyed a Cockpit
happy hour band earlier Friday, the
Thrashers, who played a diverse, in-
teresting and enthusiastic set of
covers for an indifferent crowd. By
the way, they didn’t wear leather
bikinis or brandish whips — just
good, solid rock and roll chops.

 

The Ramones played last weekend at the Student Activities Pavilion.

Ramones highlight music scene

Shortcuts: Here’s what's happen-
ing at WLUR-FM:

Along with the major-label and
major-play releases such as John
Fogerty’s Centerfield, Don Henley’s
Building the Perfect Beast, and the
Frankie Goes to Hollywood ...Pleas-
uredome opus, many lesser-known
talents have recent and noteworthy
releases. The Bluebells’ Sisters is a
refreshing breeze of new British
rock, with strong melodies, har-
monies and a strong early-60s Brit-
invasion feel. One cut was produced
by Elvis Costello. Everything but the
Girl is both a band and an LP, witha
sound ranging from cocktail jazz to
acoustic folk. The emphasis is on the
vocals, with suitably spare in-
strumentation. Danny Elfman,
former lead singer of L.A.’s Oingo
Boingo, has an album of dance-
mixed, metallic rock balanced by his
strong voice, called So Lo.

The newest entry into the “big”
sound sweepstakes is an internation-
ally-composed group, A Drop in The
Gray. Certain Sculptures is interesting
when its Roxy-sounding cuts build up
a head of steam, although the album
tends to run together and stretch a
few ideas too far. Closer to home, Joe

have released another bit of Tex-Mex

lunacy called, appropriately, Border-
town, destined for hip dance parties
everywhere. Also from Texas is
Creatures From the Black Saloon, from
the Austin Lounge Lizards, a thor-
oughly hilarious and demented poke
at country music cliches. More
serious is Naked Prey, a gritty, hard-
edged American rock and roll LP
from the group of the same name.

Finally, my favorite movie sound-
track is Mark Knopfler’s beautiful
Music from the Film Cal, a successful
blending of new and old Celtic music
and instrumentation, demonstrating
Knopfler’s virtuousity. Billy Bragg
has had an EP out for a while called
Life’s a Riot with Spy vs. Spy, which
has him singing with only electric
guitar accompaniment. This import
shows Bragg’s streetcorner insight
and grit, and the songs stick after a
couple of listenings. For all you hard-
core fans, or anyone even vaguely in-
terested, check out any of these three
(the scum off the top): White Flag’s
Third Strike (west), The F.U.’s Do We
Really Want to Hurt You (east) and
the new Husker Du, New Day Rising
(midwest).

Oh yeah — one listen to Too Tough
To Die will prove that the Ramones
have still got what it takes to give
grease and leather a good name.

‘Cotton Club’: Talent survives story

MOVIEREVIEW

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

 

Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘“‘The Cot-
ton Club” is movie-making at its
best. Yes, the film cost megabucks to
make, and yes, the story appears
fragmented in parts, but the talent
used, the atmosphere created, and
the story, flawed though it may be,
prove that these dollars were well
spent.

Everyone in ‘‘The Cotton Club” is
out to become a success in the mob-
controlled Harlem of the 1920s and
1930s. A showcase for black talent
during those years (though its
clientele was strictly whites), the
Cotton Club serves as the backdrop
for much of the story, which revolves
around two sets of brothers and
centers on characters portrayed by

Richard Gere, Gregory Hines and
Diane Lane. Hines and Gere both
seem to be innocents caught in water
over their heads, each losing touch
with his brother unwittingly in rising
to the top. Lane, meanwhile, seems
to lose (and later find) herself as she
hopes to gain status in entertainment
circles. The performances of these
three actors are extraordinary. Gere
seems to improve with every role he
gets; Lane is feisty, sexy and far
from the stereotyped gun mall of
earlier ‘gangland’ pictures; and
Hines is simply incredible, dancing
and chasing his girlfriend, a light-
skinned mulatto woman who is torn
between her love for Hines and her
ability to use her skin color to ad-
vance ina segregated society.

Director Coppola also excels in
“The Cotton Club.’’ Though he has a
mob background to this picture, and
indeed the mob presence is impor-
tant throughout the movie, Coppola
(who directed both Godfather pic-

tures) doesn’t let that presence over-
whelm the other elements of this

complex story. Instead, he keeps 7.

those ‘“‘silent partners’ in proper
perspective, influencing and prying,
but definitely in the background. His
Harlem is realistic, alive and in-
spired, and his handling of the pro-
duction segments is as polished as
the productions themselves. Most
memorable is the sequence with
Hines dancing a capella tap while we
watch a mob hit-squad at work. The
contrast and comparison of the two
simultaneous acts captured on film
are bracing.

“The Cotton Club” certainly is one
of the best pictures of the last year.
Don’t let stories about the com-
plicated plot scare you away. Fans of
this particular era in entertainment
should see this picture for the music
and dancing alone. There is enough
in this film to satisfy almost any ap-
petite. In short, ‘The Cotton Club”’ is
not to be missed.

‘Dune’: visually stunning, flawed

MOVIEREVIEW

The realm of science-fiction is one
entered into by many novelists; few,
however, create a story as engulfing
as Frank Herbert’s ‘‘Dune.’’ Direc-
tor David Lynch’s screen adaptation
of this landmark book is currently
playing at the State Theater in Lex-
ington, and though it is unable to
grasp and present all of Herbert’s
masterpieces, it is still one of the
most visually and conceptually stun-
ning films to come out in quite a
while.

The story is difficult to encap-
sulate, and this is perhaps the major
flaw in Lynch’s adaptation. The basic
story, though, revolves around Spice,
a substatice that expands conscious-
ness, considered vital to the Galactic
Empire. It is found on only one

Winter play

“Of Mice and Men,’’ John
Steinbeck’s story of two drifters in
the early 1930s, will be performed in
the University Theatre from Feb.
8-12. Curtain time each day will be 8
p.m.

The play is being directed by Brian
O’Riordan, a drama major who is do-
ing the project for his senior thesis.

The story centers on two Califor-
nians, George and Lenny. Lenny is
innocent, childlike and possibly
retarded, while George is his well-
traveled and wise guardian. To-
gether they hope to save enough
money to buy a ranch or piece of land
on which to settle.

The script was adapted by the
author in 1937 for the Broadway pro-
duction of the play. O’Riordan said
he believes the story is one of
Steinbeck’s best, along with ‘‘The
Grapes of Wrath” and “East of
Eden,” and describes it as ‘‘Stein-
beck’s non-political indictment of
humanity.”

In the University Theatre’s produc-
tion, George will be played by Phil
Brown, a third-year law student, and
Lenny will be played by Chuck

’ Richards, a second-year law student.

Both have participated in previous
University productions — Richards
in last year’s ‘Cat On A Hot Tin
Roof” and Brown in “Love Poems.”

Props, sets and lighting are being
done by the Drama 132 class, ‘‘Fun-
damentals of Theater Art.’’ Tech-
nical rehearsals, in which the actual
sets and lighting will be integrated
with the actors begin Monday.

planet, Arrakis, nicknamed Dune.
This is the setting for a feud between
two rival clans, the Harkonnen and
the Atreides, a feud set up by the
emperor himself. What the emporer
had not planned on was the existence
of young Paul Atreides (Kyle
MacLachlan), who, it turns out, is a
messiah for the desert people of
Dune, who join in the fight against
the Harkonnen. There just seems to
be too much to keep track of here if
one is unfamiliar with the book.

The strength of ‘‘Dune,’’ though,
lies its presentation. Director Lynch
creates a galaxy unique unto itself.
The weaponry, the defenses, the bat-
tle sequences and the Spice se-
quences are all stunning to the eye.
There are no holds barred. Lynch
does carry the visuals too far at least
once too often: Repulsive is the only
word that can describe the Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth Mc-

Millan), his facial lesions and his sex-
ual habits; one loses his brilliant tac-
tical side so prevalent in the book.
Some may even find his sequences
hard to stomach.

Bringing ‘‘Dune’’ to the screen was
an immense task. So much is covered
so quickly, and so much is not
covered at all (enough to upset some
‘“Dune’”’ purists) that this may be one
instance when a TV miniseries adap-
tation would have been able to cover
the material more fully and satisfac-
torily than a movie adaptation. Look-
ing at this film’s strongest points, the
visuals sweeping across the screen,
however, helps one realize that
“Dune” was meant for the large
screen. Unfortunately, its vast story
line complicates its presentation
enough that “Dune’’ may prove a
wasteland for those not initiated with
the original work.

Dain Dulaney, chairman of the
SAB Fancy Dress committee, said
this year’s schedule will be similar to
those of the past. A big-name rock
band will appear at the Student Acti-
vities Pavilion on Thursday, March
7. Although the SAB has not released
the identity of this band, Dulaney
said the band is comparable in stat-
ure and recognition to George Thoro-
good and the Deleware Destroyers,
7 played in the pavilion last week-
end.

Friday evening, March 8, is the
78th Fancy Dress Ball in the Warner
Center. The theme of the ball also is
being kept under wraps until the
week preceding the event. As usual, a
big band orchestra will provide
dance music in the Warner Center
and two rock bands will play in the
old gymnasium.

One change in this year’s ball, Du-
laney noted, is that the upper-level
classrooms in the Warner Center will
not be used. These are being prepar-
ed for women’s coaches’ offices for
next year.

Dulaney estimated that his budget
will be slightly more than last year’s
total, probably about $65,000.

leges, which raised $1,800.

The grand total came to $33,213. The committee had
set its goal for the weekend at $30,000.

 

Last weekend’s 30-hour Superdance, described as the
“best ever,’ raised more than $33,000 in cash and
pledges for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

Chris Williams, co-chairman of the Superdance steer-
ing committee, said this year’s event was ‘‘the biggest

and best ever.”’

The reason was that for the first time, the Superdance
was held at the student activities pavilion, he said. The
pavilion attracted the largest number of spectators
ever to the event, he said, because of the building’s
large capacity, which allows the committee to bring in

bigger name bands.

This year set a new record for the number of dancers
participating. About 185 people from area colleges
danced, raising $18,001 in pledges. The old record was

165 dancers.

Williams said the participation of several cadets from
Virginia Military Institute was one of the reasons for

the new record.

Cadet Glen Frank, who recruited the dancers from

VMI, said about 16 cadets danced.

The dancers’ pledges accounted for the majority of
the money raised. Beer sales brought in $3,000. Frater-
nities contributed $2,406. Pie throws earned $885. Raffle
ticket sales totaled $700. Gate receipts were not avail-

able.

In addition to the dancers’ pledges, the Superdance
raised money through other events. The committee
held “‘slave auctions” at Hollins and Mary Baldwin col-

A Rockbridge County Jail in-
mate ‘‘walked off while he was

night and has not been captured,
according to Sheriff S.M. Rey-

The escapee — Frank E: Lane,
21 -was the man who testified in
December that Scot T. Mesner
had admitted setting the fire that
killed a student and gutted the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house
last spring.

Lane said Mesner confessed to
the crimes during a chess game
while the two were cellmates.
Murder and arson charges
against Mesner were later dis-
missed. Following the trial, tele-
vision cameras recorded him say-
ing to Lane, ‘‘Have fun, Frank.”

Lane was indicted Monday on
charges of breaking and entering

Williams said that after expenses, about $20,000 will
go to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Most of the
money will be returned to the area, he said. It will be us-
ed to care for patients, research muscular dystrophy
and send children suffering from muscular dystrophy
tosummer camp.

Williams called this weekend one of the most satisfy-

ing things he’s ever done. ‘‘The Superdance is ore way
of being thankful for what I have and to help other peo-
ple out,” he said. “It’s a way of educating people to
what muscular dystrophy is all about. Seeing their emo-
tions surface lets me know that it’s all worthit.”

most fulfilling experience I have had. I’ve been for-

“He had delivered some ice

Reynolds said Lane, who had

he was reliable. ‘‘Of course, you

“It’s a privilege for them to get

School settles case
with ex-employee;
terms undisclosed

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

An undisclosed settlement was
reached last month between the
University and former Evans Dining
Hall manager Wanda Coffey-Bailey,
almost a year after she filed sex
discrimination complaints with the
Equal Opportunity Employment
Commission.

Coffey-Bailey’s dissatisfaction
began when she became pregnant in
1982 and her ability to do her job
began to be questioned, she said this
week.

She resigned at the end of last term
and will not return to work, she said.
She has dropped her EEOC com-
plaints, according to her lawyer, Ar-
thur Strickland of the Roanoke law
firm Strickland and Rogers.

‘What happened was she had com-
plaints against the University, and
they entered into a compromise set-
tlement,’’ Strickland said.

Part of that agreement, he added,
is that neither party will disclose its
terms, including whether the settle-
ment was a financial one.

Coffey-Bailey said she filed three
complaints with the EEOC. The first
charged that she was forced to work
in stressful conditions because of her
sex, and a second claimed that she
was denied a raise partly as a result
of her first complaint, which was fil-
ed Feb. 5, 1984.

Coffey-Bailey said she believes
other female W&L employees have
suffered discrimination, also. She ad-
ded that several female employees,
including some she doesn’t know,
have been calling her and telling her
to ‘‘hang in there,”’ she said.

In several interviews this week,
Coffey-Bailey outlined her com-
plaints, which center on her super-
visor, Food Services Director Gerald
J. Darrell, and include his superiors,
University Treasurer E. Stewart Ep-
ley and President John D. Wilson.

Coffey-Bailey said her relationship
with Darrell had been strained since
she began work in the dining hall in
September 1979, because of a dis-
agreement about how much responsi-
bility she should have.

“Then when the day came that I
told him I was pregnant, things went
downhill,” she said. Darrell tried to
take away some of her duties the first
time she became pregnant, in July
1982, Coffey-Bailey said. ‘He could
never let me be the manager while I
had children,” she added.

‘“‘At many of our discussions I ask-
ed him if he could name times when I
had taken time off. He said, ‘You
haven’t taken time off,’ she said
“Twas very adamant about the fact
that I had always done my job.”

Darrell said he initially was satis-
fied with Coffey-Bailey’s work. ‘‘I
thought she did a nice job for the first
couple of years, and I told her that
when I evaluated her performance,”
he said.

He added that he could not com-
ment ¢n the matter any further.
“I’ve been informed that it’s been
University policy not to discuss per-
sonnel matters,’’ Darrell said.

After her problem progressed to
the point that she did not feel able
to continue working in the dining
hall, she approached Epley, she said.

“The only response I got was,
‘Well, we see the problem, and the
only thing we can suggest is you look
for work elsewhere.’ ”’

“Not once did people in the admin-
istration say, ‘Hey, I see your
charges here,’ ’’ she added. ‘* ‘Let’s
talk about them and see what can be
done.’ ”’

Epley said he could not comment
on the situation.

Coffey-Bailey said she was told
that the administration would back
Darrell in the matter. When she

approached Wilson with her pro- |
blem, his response ‘‘was along those

‘Dry’ parties may be in future

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
and BRUCE POTTER
Staff Reporters

 

Washington and Lee fraternities
will have to exercise ‘‘a whole lot
more discretion’’ about who they
serve alcohol to if the General
Assembly raises the state’s drinking
age to 21, according to Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board agent Roger
Stevens.

An increase in the drinking age
also could force all campus wide par-
ties to be ‘‘dry,’’ Associate Dean of
Students Michael A. Cappeto said.

“With the age raised to 21, only a
small portion of the student body will
be able to drink and the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board wouldn’t
give us a license to serve beer to so
few people,’’ Cappeto said.

Cappeto said that these changes
will take place as soon as legislation
goes into effect. ‘‘We don’t have any
choice about what to do, we have to
obey the law,”’ he said.

Fraternities at W&L might also be
in for some changes. Dan Murphy,
associate dean of students for frater-
nity affairs, said that fraternities at

W&L may very well have to limit the
amount of alcohol they serve. ‘‘The
ABC will probably be a lot stricter on
the fraternities when they know that
two-thirds of them shouldn't be
drinking,” he said.

Fraternities won't have to give up
serving alcohol completely Stevens
said, but they will have to make sure
that the people they serve are of legal
age to be drinking.

Contrary to some beliefs, fraterni-
ty parties are not above the law sim-
ply because they are considered by
the ABC to be private functions,
Stevens said. The ABC assumes that
fraternities abide by the law and
usually will only investigate a house
if it receives a complaint about the
fraternity or if an agent has probable
cause to believe that minors are con-
suming alcohol in a fraternity.

Stevens said that fraternities must
be careful not to advertise a party,
because then it is no longer a private
party. He added that charging for
beer is a misdemeanor — selling al-
cohol without a license.

Raising the drinking age would not
necessarily keep alcohol off college
campuses, according to Del. Frank

Four senior business majors are
learning the ins and outs of the com-
petitive, challenging and frequently
frustrating world of business. But
this is no textbook this is a game!

The Intercollegiate Business
Games and Conference is a 24-school
competition that simulates a_busi-
ness atmosphere by providing real-
istic options and obstacles for the stu-
dent strategists. Washington and
Lee’s team of four business majors —
Mike Bearup, Harry Golliday, Wil-

is operating a simulated telephone
manufacturing company in competi-
tion with five other “‘companies”’ run

The object of the game is to create
and operate the most profitable and
stable corporation along with giving
the best oral presentation of strat-
egies and forecasts before a panel of
business experts at Emory Universi-
ty in Atlanta at the game’s March 1-2

The games began Jan. 21, when
each school was given the scenario

Each school is required to send by
computer ten commercially strateg-

must defend the decision at the

sponsor of the drinking age bill in the
House of Delegates.

“T think that college students over
the recent years have become accus-
tomed to having the ability to con-
sume alcohol at a younger age,’’ Har-
grove said. ‘“‘The adjustment (in the
drinking age) certainly is a change in
the conditions under which you can
legally consume alcohol.

“But I think it would be naive to
assume that all college campuses
would be free of beer.’’

In addition to reducing drinking in
high schools, Hargrove said, he
hopes the bill will cut down on the
amount of excessive drinking in col-
leges.

Both houses of the General Assem-
bly have passed versions of a bill
raising the legal drinking age to 21.
The House of Delegates’ bill would do
so only if the federal government
agreed to raise the age to 21 on mili-
tary bases, but the Senate defeated a
similar amendment.

Also, the House bill would allow
those who turned 20 by Oct. 1 to con-
tinue drinking while the Senate bill
would allow those who are 19 by July

Knockout or not?

Washington and Lee went 30 rounds against Muscular
Dystrophy last weekend, and we went for a knockout. More
than $30,000 was raised through the efforts of the student
dancers and organizers. For all the hours of preparation, in-
cluding the many miles logged going down the road drum-
ming up support at surrounding colleges, it was a feat worth

cherishing with just pride.

In the wake of the accomplishment, though, we must not
relax, but rather should contemplate how the Superdance
can be improved in future years. This year, many people
questioned whether the Muscular Dystrophy Association was
the right charity to benefit from our efforts. M.D.A. has one
of the highest administrative operating budgets of any non-
profit organization of its kind, with more than 50 percent of
its take financing additional fundraising efforts, celebrity
endorsements and operating expenses. Is there another or-
ganization with the same kind of national appeal that has

lower operating costs?

On the final night of Superdance this year, the crowd at the
pavilion seemed thin, if not sparse. Although this could be at-
tributed to the pavilion’s vastness, steps may have to be
taken to increase student interest in the Superdance and pro-
long that interest throughout the whole weekend. Was the $6
ticket cost for the weekend’s events too steep a price for
many? Might a per-night charge be better in the future?

Additionally, participation among students from the neigh-
boring colleges has been increasing in the last few years, due

in great part to increased

efforts among Superdance

organizers to reach out to that previously untapped support.
Witness the ‘‘auctions’’ held at Mary Baldwin and Hollins
this year for the benefit of M.D.A. In future years, could
Superdance organizers create greater excitement at neigh-
boring schools through other such innovative schemes?

Finally, participation by W&L students ought to be
addressed. Seniors might remember their first Superdance
and the crowds in Evans Dining Hall, the dancers from all
classes and the sense of campus unity that came from Super-
dance. Somewhere, that excitement has been lost. The
average dancer this year was probably a pledge required by
his fraternity to participate. Required participation may fill
up the dance floor and fatten the coffers, but it detracts from
the spirit of the event. In light of the slightly thinner crowds
at Superdance this year, do W&L students really take the
dance as seriously as once they did? For many, Superdance
weekend means a chance to escape from Lexington without
having to worry about missing any campus event.

This is not a death wish for Superdance. Rather, it repre-
sents concern over the direction Superdance is heading. We
have succeeded in the past — and I believe we will succeed in
the future — because of the dedication of a few to a great
cause. However, that dedication seems to be eclipsed these
days by several factors that we can control only if we choose
to do so. The polish is slowly giving way to a tarnish.
Together, we can restore the achievement. Together, we

must try.

‘Joe Party’ meets firewater

MY VIEW |

By Mike
McAlevey

It’s that time again when one might
experience the call of the wild. No,
not another article defining the bio-
logical needs of the post-adolescent
male or shamefully defaming the
character of women, but rather one
expounding the ‘‘virtues’” of a sub-
stance that can pacify the unruly soul
or provoke hostile behavior more ef-
fectively than the love of a bad
female. We’re talking about some-
thing that has produced indeter-
minate quantities of “forgotten” or
ill-fated romantic encouters and also
affords the Lexington Police Depart-
ment the opportunity to increase its
yearly receipts through fines. That’s
right, boys, “firewater,”’ rocket fuel”
— the names are as creative and
numerous as the reactions to them.
Let us examine how particular sects
of our student body handle this stuff.

The natural place to start is a Fri-
day afternoon. Hordes of self-pro-
claimed overworked students, ‘‘hos-
ed” by at least one vicious professor,
abandon the Hill planning to redefine
the parameters of party mania. Re-

 

‘

presenting the counter-contingent to
these weekend warriors are those
soaring in the jubilant ether after a
week of hard work and plenty of suc-
cess in the classroom wanting to re-
ward themselves with light spirits
and stimulating conversation. The
latter immaculately-clad super-stu-
dents need not even shower before
going out; they only put on a freshly
starched shirt as stiff as their per-
sonalities. Boy wonder chooses white
wine (what else?), brie cheese and a
fine assortment of mixed nuts placed
in a bowl on a table littered with
Harper’s Weekly and The New York
Times Book Review. A sophisticated
evening at home describes his goal.
Alcohol is a mere formality, for he
has ‘‘those of similar interest” about
him, or better - a cute blonde so
Aryan that she calls to mind Nazi
propaganda rallies set to Wagner.
Who are we kidding? She wants a
successful husband.

Now to address the former of those
two student types. Joe Party, that is.
Depending on whether he cares to be
spoken to or not, this crazy college
kid catches a quick shower to remove
surface grime and hair Crisco. Toss-
ing back anywhere from four to eight
beers: from his $3.49°12-pack of Goe-
bel’s constitutes an important part of
the cleaning process and is seldom
neglected by anyone worthy of the ti-
tle “hard core.’’ Throughout the de-
toxification procedure, he doesn’t
hear Bacchas summoning him to

For R.E. Lee, masculinity meant caring

University Historian I. Taylor
Sanders II says that with the advent
of coeducation, he frequently hears
the question, ‘‘What can Robert E.
Lee do for young women?” Dr.
Sanders says we'll have to stop think-
ing of Lee simply as a role model for
young men, but will have to expand
our view to include other facets of his
“complete, well-integrated per-
sonality — the nurturing side of
humanity that he picked up from his
mother.”” Following are excerpts
from remarks by Dr. Sanders to the
Alumni Association’s Lee Day
celebration Jan. 18.

Part 1 of a two-part series.

Had Matthew Brady published a
“beefcake” calendar of the Civil
War, Lee would have had a promi-
nent place — perhaps along with the
dashing Stuart, the gallant Pelham,
the flashy Custer and courtly Jeff
Davis. In modern parlance, Lee was
a “hunk.” Go to Lee Chapel and
watch high school girls on tour, Note
the reaction to West's portrait of the
young Lee — that look of grandeur
and kindness, haughtiness and
twinkle; that massive Kirk Douglas
chin and beautifully curved mouth.
Lee was about 5 feet, 11 inches tall.
His shoulders were broad and his
arms and hands large; his torso was
long, so he appeared to be well over
six feet tall; when ramrod straight,
he sat astride a fine horse. His hair
was usually described as ‘‘ebony,”
and possessed a wave that ladies en-
vied. His eyes were nearly black,
deep and intelligent. In battle they
flashed. In times of sorrow, they
readily filled with tears. In society
they twinkled with soft, kind humor.
It’s no wonder he was a social lion.

Despite what some described as
the ‘“‘air of distant mystery’ he
displayed, one person who knew Bob
Lee well was his wife, Mary. They
had known each other since
childhood. She seems to have been a
lot like Lee’s mother, whom the
general worshiped. She appears to
have understood that power her hus-
band had over women (the same ap-
plied to men who often fell under his
spell). She seems to have accepted
all this as a given, often presenting
his swooning admirers with a photo-
graph of her husband. There is no
record that she ever complained
about Lee’s numerous. female
‘friends. He flirted and corresponded
with some of them for years. She
knew her man and she was perfectly

secure. Generations of historians,
trying to find a chink in the great
man’s armor, have tried to ferret out
some sexual indiscretion, some in-
stant of faithlessness. None exist.

Lee loved the company of pretty
young women, preferring them to
male companions. He was the master
of Victorian small talk and the art of
flirtation. For women, this meant
that they became ‘‘daft’’ about hand-
some cavaliers (remember we are
talking about a generation raised on
the chivalry of Walter Scott). They
flattered, they gushed and blushed
and made small jokes.

For Lee, flirtation meant enjoyable
conversations with young women,
especially his daughter’s friends;

bing, some of the catty local ladies
—and they were no worse than their
husbands — made comments about
Mrs. Lee, who was crippled with
rheumatism and confined to a
wheelchair. One belle said that “‘if it
would please God to take poor cousin
Mary Lee — she suffers so —wouldn’t
these Richmond women campaign
for cousin Robert.” As for the
general, one reported, he ‘‘holds all
admiring females at arm’s length.”
The Lees spent much of their mar-
ried life apart. He was often station-
ed far from home and desperately
missed his family. Mary, who will-
ingly put up with the problems of be-
ing an army wife, presented Lee with
seven children in 17 years and grew

 

“Lee was such a great man because he
was a complete human being. He was so
masculine that he could afford to display
what we might stereotype as feminine, nur-

turing virtues.”

 

many ceremonial gallantries; lots of
teasing and doses of mild irony in-
terspersed with puns. Lee’s sense of
humor was gentle; his courtesy sim-
ple and without pretense. He seemed
more interested in hearing about
their children than in talking politics
with the husbands. He also had an
abiding interest in flowers and
gardens, and demonstrated his
descriptive powers when he wrote of
the beauties of nature and her
creatures. Such topics made for
ready sources of conversation in
feminine society.

Rachel Lyons, the Jewish belle of
wartime Richmond, defined as ‘‘a
mere pretense of lovemaking, a
semblance of love, not the reality. As
soon as love itself was waked, it was
no longer a flirtation.’’ She said that
she did not include kissing as legiti-
mate in flirtation. Some women
believed, though, that in a flirtation
kissing was necessary ‘“‘to keep a
man on‘a string.’’ Miss Lyons said
that ‘‘Those sorts of freedom” are
“horrid — I never let a man kiss
me.’’ Lee understood the rules and
mastered all the conventions of 19th
cehtury courtly love.

In the hothouse atmosphere of
Richmond besieged, with its intrigue,
petty gossip and: political backstab-

to become courageously self-suffici-
ent. Before the war, when the family
was together, Mrs. Lee provided an
atmosphere of gentleness and ten-
derness that encouraged Lee’s ex-
pansive, cheerful spirit. Only when
Lee encountered surly jealousies and
other pressures of wartime, did
observers start referring to the cold
reserve of Robert E. Lee, detested
quarrelsome pettiness and back-
biting. He tried to stay above the con-
tentiousness that surrounded him.
This amiable man did have a temper,
which he usually controlled. He suf-
fered fools with great courtesy and
patience. He went to any lengths to
avoid a direct clash with an an-
tagonist. It is probable that he cod-
dled some subordinates that he
should have dressed down or sacked.
Biographer Douglas Southall Free-
man thinks that may have been one
of his few weaknesses as a soldier.
Early in the war, during his failures
in western Virginia, Lee’s soft-
heartednéss won for him the title
“Granny” Lee. A later nickname,
“Ole Spade Lee,’’ celebrated his
habit of making his troops dig in for
self-protection.

The point I wish to make is a sim-
ple one. Lee was such a great man
because he was a complete human

being. He was so masculine that he
could afford to display what we
might stereotype as feminine, nur-
turing virtues. This was seen best
when, as a teen-ager, he nursed his
invalid mother. In one of the most
telling comments made about Lee,
she said, ‘“‘What will I do without
him? He had been both a son and a
daughter to me.”

Lee was a gentle nurse to Mary
during the last years of his life, en-
joying a household filled with women
on a campus surrounded by young
men who worshipped him. He
mothered his 400 lads and wrote long
letters to their parents. In one of my
favorite reports, after congratulating
the folks at home on their son’s fine
grades, he noted that their boy had
spent $100 more than necessary. “‘A
student only requires (what is suffi-
cient) for his comfortable sub-
sistence,”’ he wrote. ‘‘More than that
distracts him in his studies. More-
over, every young man must learn
how to practice economy. It is as
necessary to his success in life as ap-
plication; tor ne should learn self-
control.”’ Lee, that most masculine of
warriors, cared for all those under
his protection or direction like a pro-
verbial mother hen. Lee expected his
faculty to ‘‘observe the stage drivers’
rule’ when dealing with weak
students. ‘‘Always take care of the
poor horses,”’ he told them.

He goes on to obliquely criticize the
parents for indulging the boy.
“Parents who are solicitous for the
welfare of their sons cannot too
earnestly impress upon them these
principles.” Imagine a modern col-
lege president, even with armies of
bureaucrats and word processing
machines, keeping such close tabs on
his undergraduates. Today, Lee’s let-
ter is a rebuke to the new trinity of
consumerism that is held so dear by
many self-indulgent college
students: M.B.A., BMW and LLL.
Bean.

that is, rather he grabs sounds of a
distant rebel yell calling him to bat-

on the side, or simply shots of import-

draft beer. Ardently contending that
he truly appreciates the taste of those

Joe knows how to start: beer, then
shots, then shots and beer, then any-
thing with a proofed label is fair
game. Cardinal rule 1: The buzz
must not descend gently upon a real
partier. His spontaneous nature pre-
fers to feel as if he has been struck
with a large blunt instrument in the
hinder portions of his skull. One mo-

Suddenly, all women transform into

Terrible profound and eloquent is the

to write down his pithy pearls and
also providing himself the opportuni-

visits to the bathroom which he so
cleverly terms “‘shaking hands with

known outburst, “‘I’m soooo wasted.”
In the restroom, Joe often discovers

Blazing drunk, our stand-up philo-
sopher may drift from a local bar toa
fraternity party and try on a lamp-
shade or two, yell loudly and be
everybody’s close friend. He may
also stop on his long walk home to
participate in some _ projectile
vomiting. It’s not uncommon for Joe
to make a game of it by pursing the
lips and trying to propel it over the
hood of a car. Subcompacts yield
minimum point value, while huge
luxury vehicles really charge the
point total. Sloppiness detracts from
one’s score, particularly the deposi-
tion of ‘‘party funk’’ on one’s jean
jacket. Tired yet experiencing a deep
feeling of accomplishment, the par-
tying pioneer pours himself into bed,
which predictably moves at warp
speeds. Periodic relief sessions and
rehydration drills are dispersed
throughout the night, serving to fluc-
tuate the linear nature of Joe’s EEG
and ensuring wake-up.

The next day, our Skid Row bum
impersonator finds himself classified
as a couch potato, moving seldomly,
if ever, to acquire food, liquid or to
change the channel. By about 6
o’clock, things begin looking up for
Joe. He can move in a relatively sta-
ble manner and the thin veneer of
semi-alcoholic sweat has dissipated
from his skin. Preparation begins
again. Ask you why he readies him-
self for another night of drinking?
Simple — it’s Saturday and he is Joe

Is abortion
an illness?

OUR VIEW

 

By Sheila Dennen and
Pamela Stallsmith

One obstacle that members of the
Washington and Lee community
must overcome next year when the
University becomes coeducational is
the tendency to overlook women's
concerns. Many men cannot or will
not empathize with the problems that
women, both past and present, face.
These include discrimination, sexual
abuse and, most importantly, the
right to control their own bodies. B.
Scott Tilley’s Jan. 24 My View col-
umn purports an opinion on the con-
troversial subject of abortion that we
believe is an unsympathetic misin-
terpretation of how abortion affects
society.

Mr. Tilley argues that abortion, ‘‘a
sickness in itself,’ is threatening the
well-being of the “‘Great American
Dream.” His dream has become a
nightmare, a nightmare in which the
villain of abortion is a contributing
symptom to the growing immaturity
of American society.

Several important points are neg-
lected in his article. The most ob-
vious is his lack of compassion and
empathy. Abortion for any woman is
a painful experience, both physically
and emotionally. The decision is not
made glibly or casually. The trauma
a woman endures is carried not for a
nine-month term but for years after-
wards. When a woman finds she is
unexpectedly pregnant, she must
make quick, rational decisions that
will affect the rest of her life. This
does not mean that she enjoys the de-
cision she is making; she is doing it
out of necessity.

Mr. Tilley refers to ‘‘an immature
society”’ that seeks to evade’respon-
sibility. We believe that it is the mark
of a mature society that these women
realize that they may not be mature
enough or simply not ready to care
for a child. Society has to open its
eyes to the needs and desires of to-
day’s women. Women will not be
thrust into unwanted situations with-
out any viable choices.

When a husband and wife are ea-
gerly planning a family and are an-
ticipating the arrival of a child, preg-
nancy can be one of the most joyful
experiences. However, when a wo-
man is raped and finds herself preg-
nant, itis another story. It appears as
if we may soon find ourselves in a
society where the most fundamental
civil liberty is suppressed: the free-
dom to control our bodies.

Abortion is a moral ambiguity. As
we said, it is not a decision lightly
made. Judgment cannot be passed on

, Someone who has undergone the

traumatic experience of abortion be-
cause different circumstances result
in different decisions and solutions.
Who are we to judge the moral cali-
ber of a woman who has had an abor-
tion? The issue is not whether abor-
tion is in some perverse way aiding
the downfall of American society.
The issue is not whether abortion is
right or wrong. The issue is that a
woman should have the right to con-
trol her own body.

We are not condemning Mr. Tilley.
Everyone has a right to his own view.
Freedom of speech was one of the
leading principles on which our coun-
try was founded. We are merely sug-
gesting that there are several sides to
the abortion issue, and that in order
to understand its totality all aspects
must be considered. Before advocat-
ing the elimination of abortion, the
consequences of such an action would
have to be thoroughly investigated.
Abortion is not the easiest way out;
there is no simple solution for such a
complex issue, That is why everyone
should attempt to understand all
angles of of the problem. We live ina
multi-faceted democracy, not a one-
sided autocracy.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 7, 1985, Page 3

Students: Emotion is key to ‘State of Union’

The Ring-tum Phi sponsored a forum last night in which
five student leaders watched President Reagan's State of
the Union address together and then had a discussion of the
speech.

The participants were: Sam Dalton, secretary of the stu-
dent body; Cole Dawson, president of the student body; Pat
Hayden, president of the College Republicans; Jim Kerr,
president of Kathekon, the student alumni association; and
Ken Nankin, president of Pi Sigma Alpha, the politics
honor association.

Edited excerpts of the discussion follow. The moderator
was Mike Allen.

Moderator: In President Reagan’s previous State of
the Union addresses, the budget deficit was a big issue
and he talked a lot about it. Tonight, he barely mention-
edit. A lot of what he said was what we can call the four
f’s: faith, freedom, family and the future. Cole, do you
think this was a lot of apple pie and motherhood stuff, or
did you sense some substance tonight?

Dawson: I think he tried to appeal to people’s emo-
tions, but I think for the last four years that’s what he’s
stood for. He has tried to build stronger values in Amer-
ica, and so while that is just an emotional appeal, I do
think it has substance with what he’s trying to do. I
think that when people believe in America, they feel
better about themselves, and that makes them more
productive and happy.

Dalton: I think using the four f’s was a great way to
structure the speech — he went off on each one of those
and he was very effective at developing what he had to
say. I think of course in the last four or four-and-a-half
years there’ve been gains from what he’s done. He’s not
afraid to pat himself on the back for it, and he shouldn’t
be.

Moderator: You talk about some of these gains. One
of the things he said tonight was that a great industrial
giant has been reborn. Ken, do you think the people in
Detroit and Pittsburgh would agree with that?

Nankin: I’d have to say that from the standpoint of
the captains of industry, it’s been reborn, especially
with deregulation and laxer enforcement of rules than
in the past. But people who are unemployed will dis-
agree. Unfortunately, with this movement toward free
enterprise, certain sectors are going to have to suffer
for a while. With the movement away from steel and in-
to plastics and technological innovation, I think people
are going to have to suffer in the short term and
hopefully enjoy prosperity in the long run.

Moderator: When Reagan mentioned the word ‘‘com-
passion”’ tonight, either by accident or by design CBS’s
cameras zoomed in on Stockman. Pat, you’re Mr. Re-
publican: Do you think this fairness issue is something
that’s going to continue to dog the Reagan Administra-
tion, or is this something that they've overcome?

Hayden: It’ll probably continue to dog him, but it’s
more a philosophical expression of how government
should be run than how government is run. Most con-
servative Americans believe that welfare and food
stamps and housing subsidies and things like that just
aren’t the way to go anymore. It’s not that they’re not
compassionate — it’s just that they don’t think that’s
the way to do it. It’s been tried for 40 years now, and it
hasn’t done much good, so now we're going to try some-
thing else. The liberals paint it as a fairness issue, but I
don’t think it is. They’re trying to spread independence
by spreading opportunity.

Kerr: I have trouble dealing with to what extent

Sam Dalton makes a point during last night’s discus-
sion about the President’s State of the Union address as

fairness is a relative term. That’s where I disagree with
you. There has to be some amount of federal involve-
ment. His idea tonight of letting people own their own
federal housing is the line that I think his issues need to
take — to give them more responsibility and involve
them on a more gradual scale than I think Reagan has
done. I think you can’t just cut people off cold turkey.
Maybe people have been too dependent in the past, but I
think Reagan has been a little bit overzealous in cor-
recting that.

Moderator: Ken a few minutes ago mentioned the
captains of industry and the fact that they seem to be
benefiting from the Reagan program. Pat, there is — I
think you will agree — a perception that Reagan’s pro-
grams have hurt poor people more than they have hurt
people at higher income levels. Is that perception unfair
or inaccurate?

Hayden: Which programs? Overall, I would say it’s
inaccurate. In specific instances, I’m sure it’s true for
some people. But the way a lot of people look at it is that
the rising tide lifts all boats, so if you improve the eco-
nomy overall, you’re helping everybody in the long run.
I’m sure that if you look at the short run for a lot of fam-
ilies, they have been hurt in the last few years.

Dawson: You've got inflation at a three-year average
of 3.9 percent. Although these programs have benefited
the rich more than the poor, a lowered inflation rate like
that means that the poor people can buy more for their
dollar. I think that’s what’s extremely important. If this
huge deficit catches up with us and we have to really
start paying this off, inflation will jump and interest
rates will fly and it may hurt us down the road, but so
far, I think it’s helping the whole economy. It’s amazing
— inflation is the lowest in 17 years.

Kerr: You mention the deficit, and I don’t think
Reagan really addressed the current deficit as much as
he addressed the future. I found it interesting — this

might just be my own Democratic background — that
he didn’t stay on that subject or give much time to it. I
think it was a glaring lack of time devoted to that area
of the speech as compared to others. It’s understand-
able, but I think it was obvious that he skirted around
the issue and moved on to sunnier subjects.

Moderator: One of the areas he moved on to was the
social issue realm. He said that abortion is either the
taking of human life or it isn’t. Jim, which is it?

Kerr: I don’t know. I think in the abortion issue, it’s
interesting that he had a woman there who tends the
children of heroin addicts. I think if an anti-abortion law
is passed, the business will go up substantially. Nobody
wants the kids when they get here. Nobody wants abor-
tion, but nobody wants to deal with them once they get
here.

Dawson: But do you think that the people that lady
deals with are the type that can afford abortions any-
way, or do they do them illegally, with coat hangers or
whatever?

Kerr: People know it’s a possibility, so it’s either go-
ing to be done in a back alley on top of a dumpster witha
coat hanger or it’s going to be done in a sterile.en-
vironment of a clinic by trained personnel who know
what they’re doing. It’s a reality, and either the hus-
band’s going to punch his wife in the stomach and kill
the kid, or she’s going to a clinic to have it done. The
moral issue is different. It’s a known fact, and once peo-
ple know that something’s a possibility, you can’t just
legislate it out of their minds.

Dawson: Once they realize that it is illegal and that
the only way they’re going to be able to have an abor-
tion is through some unsterile or dangerous method...

Kerr: I think it’ll be done.

Dawson: But maybe not as much. People go around
now, I think, and a lot of people in college just say, ‘‘If
she gets pregnant, we’ll have an abortion — it only costs

Nankin: That’s a mistake that he’s making — if this
law every gets through Congress, he doesn’t have any
kind of Planned Parenthood program. I agree that it’ll
never be passed.

Hayden: It doesn’t need to be passed — I don’t really
know why he said it like that. The way that any anti-
abortion move will come is from the Supreme Court. Al-
so, just because abortion is a reality, that’s no reason
for the government to condone it — noreason at all.

Moderator: Is there not a third option besides condon-
ing it and outlawing it? Is there some middle ground?

Dalton: I agree with that — I don’t think you have to
take a stand either way. I think it’s an issue you're go-
ing to hear an awful lot about in the next year. Reagan’s
going to take his big stand. I don’t really understand it
being a major issue — maybe it’s because of Reagan’s
image of American apple pie and everything.

Nankin: I thought he’d be a lot more specific in his ad-
dress, especially in terms of a lot of his budget cuts for
the middle class. For these four years, he doesn’t have
the specter of re-election, so I thought he would without
fear say certain things and touch on some of his cuts. It
seemed to me that he was very general, just like he was
in his first address four years ago.

Moderator: One thing he said is that his tax reform
will not be a tax increase in disguise. That’s pretty
specific. Do you doubt he was sincere about that?

Nankin: He hasn’t kept some of his promises. In The
Post today there was a large article in which they went
back to the campaign trail and brought out quotes.
There’s no way you can reconcile some of the things he
said with some of the things he’s done.

Moderator: You all are student leaders. The percep-
tion is that Washington and Lee students are a) more
politically aware than the average student and b) quite
conservative. Are these perceptions accurate?

Nankin: I think they have a more limited scope of in-
terests — they’re very aware of things that affect them
personally. Few people here know anything about or
care about assistance to Third World nations. But a lot
of people here are interested in and know facts about
the tax plan.

Kerr: This is such a sheltered environment. If you go
down to Chapel Hill, they’re more interested in the cut-
backs on student loans. Pegple here come from such
similar backgrounds. You’re not going to have a protest
on the Hill about cutbacks in student loans. People are
aware of what’s going to affect them later in life.

Dawson: I can’t speak for people out of the C-School,
really, but I think the Commerce School people do read
The Wall Street Journal and business magazines and
newsmagazines. People do read the newspaper in the
morning before they go to class, so I think students are
pretty aware. I’m not sure how that compares with
other schools, but I do know that students here are in-
terested in what’s going on.

Dalton: I think first of all that students aren’t as
aware as they think they are. I think that a lot of
students think that because we know a little bit about
CIA covert activities or whatever that we know
everything that’s going on around us. I think we have an
elitist attitude when we think we know a lot more than
everbody else does. Conservative? Yes. I think that’s a
product of our backgrounds — that’s just the way it is.
We are all from the same type of families more or less,
there are minimal minorities here and we just have
homogeneous views.

Professor interns with former student in Washington

 

By JAY WERNER
Staff Reporter

 

Some interns spend their time
opening mail and answering the
phone, but one intern from Washing-
ton and Lee had a somewhat more in-
teresting experience — he spent part
of the time within a few feet of Presi-
dent Reagan.

That may be unusual, but what’s
even more surprising is that the in-
tern wasn’t a student — it was a pro-
fessor.

Assistant Journalism Professor
Robert J. de Maria is taking the win-
ter term off to work with Cinema
Sound, a video production company
in Washington, D.C.

An unusual aspect of this intern-
ship is that de Maria is working for
one of his former students, William
R. Parks Jr., of the W&L Class of
1982.

Parks, 25, is the senior editor for

Cinema Sound and helped arrange
the internship for his old professor.
He is also de Maria's host in Wash-
ington — de Maria sleeps on Parks’
couch when he is in Washington to
work.

de Maria says he is doing the in-
ternship so he can observe the tech-
niques in lighting and sound record-
ing that Cinema Sound utilizes in its
productions. He says that after this
training he will be able to apply the
techniques in his work here and teach
them to his classes.

Cinema Sound is the company that
produces, among other projects, the
United Way public service announce-
ments that are seen during National
Football League telecasts. de Maria
worked on the United Way spots seen
during this year’s Super Bowl.

He also recently worked with the
crew that shot a public service an-
nouncement for the Special Olympics
done by Reagan in the White House.

U.Va. honor appeal
put off until Feb. 17

CHARLOTTESVILLE — An open
honor appeal hearing for a former
University of Virginia student has
been postponed until Feb. 17.

The hearing for Monique R. Faw-
cett, convicted in a September public
trial of resubmitting a test that had
been altered, originally was schedul-
ed for last Saturday.

Late Friday evening, though, Faw-
cett introduced a new witness, whom
her accusors did not have an oppor-
tunity to interview before the hear-
ing. This led to postponement of the
hearing.

The appeal hearing, before five
members of the university’s Honor
Committee, will determine if any
procedural error or denial of any
rights occurred during the investiga-
tion or the original trial, according to
Rob Buell, Honor Committee vice
chairman in charge of trials.

If a majority of the appeal panel
decides in Fawcett’s favor, a new
trial will be held later in the year.

“My official title is production in-
tern,” de Maria said. ‘I do what any
student would do in an internship.
For the Special Olympics spot at the
White House, I helped with the sound
and the lighting.”’

de Maria said that the security at
the White House is even tighter than
one might expect. He said a compu-
ter check is run on members of the
production crew before they are al-
lowed to enter the White House. Once
inside, everyone must pass through a
metal detector, and the equipment
cases had to be searched and also
checked by a dog trained to detect ex-
plosives.

de Maria was especially impressed
by the missiles on the White House
roof.

Of the President, de Maria said,
“He is very good. They don’t call him
‘one-take Ron’ for nothing.” de Mar-
ia also said that at one point Reagan
waved to him hut another member

of the crew said he waves to every-
body.

Other than the learning he has done
on the job, de Maria said he also has
had time to cultivate contacts for
future internships for W&L students
and even secured a few donations for
W&L’s Department of Journalism
and Communications.

When it was announced at the Cin-
ema Sound company that Bill Parks’
former professor was coming to
Washington to do an internship under
him., the joke around the office was
“it makes you wonder what de Maria
taught Parks.”’

While de Maria says that the
excitement of working in Washington
and everything he has learned is
great, the internship has its draw-
backs.

“T really missed my family,’ he
said. ‘I spent a fortune on long dis-
tance phone calls. It’s good to be
home.”’

Ex-cadet files motion

From Staff Reports

 

Jeffrey R. Pack, the former
Virginia Military Institute cadet who
has accused Commonwealth’s Attor-
ney Beverly C. ‘“‘John”’ Read of viola-
ting the principle of lawyer-client
confidentiality, filed a motion last
week claiming the drug charges
against him are repetitive and un-
clear.

Pack, who left VMI without grad-
uating and now lives in Springfield,
was indicted Sept. 4 on six counts of
distributing the hallucinogen
psilocybin during July 1983. He is
free on a $10,000 property bond.

In his Jan. 31 motion, he states that
because each of the six counts on the
indictment is identical, he is unable
to distinguish among them and there-

fore is hampered in preparing his de-
fense.

The motion refers to the ‘“‘time-
vagueness”’ and ‘“‘multiplicity’’ of the
six identical counts.

It states that the indictment
“would permit proof of six sales of
psilocybin to the same person on the
same day, or of one Sale to six per-
sons on the same day, or of one sale
to six persons on different days, or of
six sales to the same person, each
sale ona different day.”

Circuit Judge Rudolph Bumgard-
ner III has tentatively scheduled a
hearing on the Pack case for March
5. Because Read may have to testify,
the Henrico County Commonwealth’s
Attorney has been designated prose-
cutor for the case.

Coed, UC discuss
rep, ‘Little Sisters

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Preliminary proposals for the addi-
tion of a female ad hoc member to the
Student Control Committee and a
“Little Sisters’ program were dis-
cussed by members of the University
Council and the Coeducation Steering
Committee on Thursday.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
president of the University Council,
emphasized that the matters discuss-
ed were not formal proposals. John
said the purpose of the meeting was
to give the coed committee a chance
to air its ideas before a ‘‘sounding
board.”

“T think it’s a helpful discussion. It
provides a forum where there are
students, faculty and administrators
soa variety of views can be express-
ed,” John said.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson said that the coed
committee will have its formal
recommendations regarding Student
Control and “‘Little Sisters’ ready on
Tuesday. Simpson said she was re-
luctant to release the full text of the
tentative proposals because changes
might be made by the subcommittee.

John said the idea behind the pro-
posal to ensure female representa-
tion on the Student Control Commit-
tee next year was to ask the Execu-
tive Committee to appoint a female
student as a non-voting, ad hoc mem-
ber of the Student Control. If a
woman is elected one of the freshmen

Grand jury

A local grand jury Monday indicted
a man on charges stemming from the
Dec. 21 burglary of the Rockbridge
County house of five Washington and
Lee students.

Edward L. Mohler Jr. was charged
with five counts of breaking and
entering and five counts of grand
larceny. Listed as victims were W&L
juniors Paul Davey, David DeHoll,
Rusty Johnson, Townes Pressler and
Jim Strader.

The grand jury also certified an ar-
son charge against Bryan M. Walrod
of Tennessee, who has been charged
with setting fire to an occupied Vir-
ginia Military Institute building on
May 5.

What Will It Mean?

 

class officers next year, then no ad
hoc female member would be
appointed, John explained.

John said most of the University
Council members seemed to react
favorably to the proposal.

“Tt seemed to me to be a very
sound way of achieving an objective
that is a desirable one,’ John added.

The University Council may re-
commend that the EC appoint the ad
hoc member, but the council has no
power to force the EC to do so if it is
unwilling, John said.

Simpson explained that the ‘‘Little
Sisters’ proposal dealt with whether
such a program should be permitted
at Washington and Lee and what
guidelines should be followed in es-
tablishing a ‘“‘Little Sisters” pro-
gram.

In a “Little Sisters’’ program,
women are invited by a fraternity to
enjoy a special status and relation-
ship with the fraternity, Simpson
said. The women do not become
members in any way, but are merely
invited to participate in the fraterni-
ty’s social activities, she added.

indicts 19

Walrod, 23, was arrested Sept. 27,
and is free on a $10,000 property
bond.

James A. Horne Jr. of Rockbridge
County is charged with four counts of
distributing marijuana during the
summer of 1978 and eight counts of ,
selling it during 1981.

Robert F. Huffman of Buena Vista °
is charged with three counts of dis-
tributing marijuana to a juvenile
during the summer of 1983 and one
count of selling cocaine during Octo-
ber 1983.

The four-man, three-woman grand
jury issued 19 indictments after 2 12
hours of deliberation. The foreman
was Karen Pleva, wife of W&L chem-
istry Professor Michael A. Pleva.

Dean Simpson urges
new coed perspective

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee may
have to make some changes in its
orientation procedure next fall be-
cause of coeducation, Associate Dean
of the College Pamela Simpson told
the EC Monday night.

Simpson stressed the need for stu-
dent interest and input as the Coedu-
cation Steering Committee, which
she heads, prepares for the advent of
coeducation.

Orientation ‘‘is something you all
might want to consider,’’ Simpson
told the EC members. ‘We antici-
pate there will be more recommen-
dations [in all areas] coming out
rather quickly.”’

Emphasizing the potential effect of
coeducation on the honor system,
Simpson told the EC it ‘‘must have a
common-sensical . attitude’ about
how to approach orientation. The
freshmen are now told, for example,
that one aspect of the honor system is
that they can leave doors unlocked
without fear. On a coed campus,
“that may not be the best attitude,”

Simpson said.

Just as a non-voung aa noc femaie;
member will be added to the Student
Control Committee in the fall if no
women are elected as class officers, ,
Simpson said the EC might want to.
consider obtaining a female perspec-
tive when investigating a possible
honor violation.

Simpson indicated a need for the’
KC to be prepared for ‘‘girls-will-be-

girls” incidents that could be con-

strued as honor violations.

Simpson also indicated that cases -

of harassment, either sexual or
otherwise, should be taken to the Stu-
dent Control Committee.

Junior EC representative Michael
Black, a member of the coeducation
committee, said he will be giving the
EC weekly reports on the commit-
tee’s progress for the rest of the year.

The discussion with Simpson was
the only major item on the EC’s
agenda Monday. The EC did not dis-
cuss the proposed alternative calen-
dar, although Vice President James
White, sitting in for President Cole
Dawson, joked that the EC members
should read through the proposal and
“formulate your opinions against it.”

It’s ‘Dynasty’ without the
women, it’s “The Dukes of Hazzard”’
gone Detroit; it’s Dirty Harry say-
ing, “Make my day”’; it’s the saga of
boy wonder Lee Iacocca. Batman
would have been proud.

In his autobiography, ‘‘Iacocca,”’
the automobile magnate reveals him-
self as the folksy, capitalist, caped
crusader first at Ford and then at
Chrysler. And although the book is
presented in the same personal, man-
of-the-middle-class style as his com-
mercials, the down-home approach
Iacocca takes only heightens the fas-
cinating contrast with the convol-
uted, egocentric world of Detroit
power politics. His simplistic anec-
dotal style is merely the veneer of a
shrewd corporate manager.

Iacocca is a second generation Ita-
lian immigrant who quickly rises
through the Ford ranks, and he
stages his initial major success with

 

The lacocca d

the development of the Mustang. It
went over in a Big Way.

“In Garland, Texas, a Ford dealer
had fifteen potential customers bid-
ding on a single Mustang in his dis-
play window. He sold it to the highest
bidder — a man who insisted on
spending the night in the car so that
nobody else could buy it while his
check was clearing.”’

“Mustang mania,” as Iacocca
termed it, landed him a promotion to
vice president of the corporate car
and truck group. With his power to
plan all production and marketing of
cars and trucks for both Ford and
Lincoln-Mercury, Iacocca sought to
inject a little joie de vivre into the divi-
sions. And he did. He did it with cars
such as the Mercury Marquis and the
Cougar.

These successes led to Dec. 10,
1970, when Iacocca was appointed to
the presidency of Ford at age 46.
Henry Ford, chairman of the board,
encapsulated the attitude of Ford
corporate management during Iac-

occa’s eight-year tenure as presi-
dent.

“Early in my presidency, Henry
told me his management philosophy.
‘If a guy works for you,’ he said,
‘don’t let him get too comfortable.
Don’t let him get cozy or set in his
ways. Always do the opposite of what
he expects. Keep your people anxious
and off-balance.’” Great working
environment, huh?

Yet Henry Ford still had to deal
with the board of directors, and his
philosophy was once again beautiful-
ly simple. ‘‘When it came time to
meet the board, he, more than most
CEO’s, believed in the mushroom
treatment — throw manure on them
and keep them in the dark.”

Tacocca stayed at Ford until he was
fired on July 13, 1978, despite his
disgust for Henry Ford. The compa-
ny had made roughly $3.5 billion dur-
ing 1977 and 1978. ‘‘Deep down in my
character there must have been a
weakness.” Ah hah, ‘‘a’”’ weakness—
good ‘ole capitalistic greed. “I

wanted that $1 million a year so
much that I wouldn’t face reality.”
Reality came back with a jolt when
Henry Ford fired him because it was
“best for the company.”’

Iacocea’s 32-year stay at Ford may

have been interesting, but his strug-
gle at Chrysler is gripping. After all,
here’s the real preoccupation with
both revenge and the ‘‘American
Dream.” Although it may sound
trite, it’s hard not to love the rags-to-
riches soap opera that is the Chrysler
story.

The day lacocca took over, Chry-
sler announced its largest loss ever
— a third-quarter deficit of $160
million. It wasn’t just a business with
a few temporary problems or even
several major problems — it was a
corporate miasma. In his first day at
the office, Iacocca noticed a par-
adigm example of the Chrysler atti-
tude — his predecessor’s secretary
was using her office telephone for
private calls. ‘‘When the secretaries
are goofing off, you know the place
has dry rot.’’ Iacocca sweats the
details.

How did Iacocca feel during this
early chaos at Chrysler? ‘When I
thought about it, I was bereft. (That's
a euphemism for feeling lower than

whale shit!) _

lacocca’s biggest battle was for the
loan guarantees. With his humorous
anecdotes aside, he had some serious
comments on the rebuilding indus-
try. “These days, free enterprise has
to make further adjustments. This
time, it has to adapt to a new world
—a world which now includes a form-
idable rival, Japan, and a world
where nobody else is playing by the
rules of laissez-faire.”

For most of his opposition to the
loan guarantees, however, ‘‘federal
help for Chrysler constituted a sac-
rilege, a heresy, a repudiation of the
religion of corporate America.”

Five years to the day after Iacocca
had been fired from Ford, he an-
nounced that Chrysler would pay
back the entire loan seven years
before it was due. At a ceremony in
New York, Chrysler bankers got a
check for $813,487,500.

You know Henry Ford must have
been in the background gnashing his
teeth.

 

 

IFC offers compromise on reform proposal

¥

The Interfraternity Council Tues-
day issued a series of compromise
proposals in response to the report by
last year’s Ad Hoc Committee on
Fraternity Affairs.

“The Interfraternity Council re-
cognizes the report of the President’s
Ad Hoc Committee on fraternities
and after having discussed it, wishes
to respond and compromise through
the following list of proposals,” the
document said.

The student-faculty Student Affairs
Committee will decide which of the
regulations should be adopted.
Highlights of the IFC proposal fol-
low:
~The IFC concedes that the situa-
tion surrounding ‘‘mid-week”’ parties
was unacceptable this year. The
changes that have been implemented
this year, however, are also
unacceptable, and we would like to.
readdress the issue after the Board of

same lines.”

Wilson also said this week that he
would not comment on the matter.

“T’m surprised she was talking a
lot about it,’’ he said.

Coffey-Bailey said that when Dar-
rell learned that she had filed her
complaint with the EEOC, he gave
administrators a list of her supposed
shortcomings.

She also said she was threatened
with being fired, which is illegal dur-
ing an EEOC investigation, accord-
ing to that agency.

Darrell denied her a raise after she
filed her first complaint, she said,
because he was dissatisfied with her
performance. He had never called
her performance into question before
she filed the complaint, she said.

Then, just before this school year
began, Darrell told her he would give
her a raise in January if she would
drop her charges, she said.

“T refused to drop my charges and
return for a raise I should have got-
ten in the first place,’’ she said.

“At this point I have no respect for
what goes on’’ at W&L, she said. “My

 

 

Trustees has stated its policy. We
feel that the present rules have not
reduced the ‘‘wear and tear” on the
houses, and furthermore has increas-
ed the pressure felt by members who
attend the parties.

~The IFC recommends that each
fraternity provide some kind of re-
ception for parents and alumni on
their respective weekends. No frater-
nity social events may rival any ma-
jor University cultural or sporting
event. As for the problems that arise
from serving beer or other alcoholic
beverages at parties, we feel that this
will take care of itself when the legal
drinking age in Virginia goes to 21
years.

manager and food manager to live in

respect for W&L and its administra-
tive role is pretty poor.”’

Because she felt that she could not
work with Darrell, and that the Univ-
ersity would not do anything about it
— including transferring her to
another department — she resigned
at the end of last term, claiming that
she was forced out of her job.

“T said [to Wilson], ‘Why don’t you
let me mark the lines on the football
field? I’d be much happier.’ ”’

At the root of the problem, Coffey-
Bailey said, is the fact that becatise’
W&L is Lexington’s leading employ-
er, workers who feel they may be suf-
fering discrimination and who want
to continue working in Lexington are
encouraged not to press the issue.

Coffey-Bailey said she plans to
move away from Lexington, her
birthplace. “I don’t want to be
around anymore,” she said.

Part of the reason for that is a con-
cern for her welfare and that of her
family, she said.

“My purpose is not to sling mud,
but just to let people know there is a
problem,” she said.

Now that she has reached the
settlement, she said she hopes she
can forget about W&L. “‘Let’s just
say that I got very tired of the whole
thing,”’ she said.

stage’ between abstract ideas and
the dangerous ‘real world.”’

Golliday also found the games a
helpful learning experience. ‘We
learned more in the first four weeks
than we would have all year,” he
Said.

The students have found, though,
that the game is as entertaining as it
is enlightening. ‘‘We could easily
spend eight hours a day on it,’’ Sch-
oeffler said.

“It’s hard to concentrate on other
subjects,’’ Bearup agreed.

The W&L team won the overall
competition in 1982. Bearup said this
year’s team’s chances are very good
and that they are ‘‘very confident.”

Shreiner said that win or lose, the
group has enjoyed the experience.
“We get along really well and are an
aggressive, confident, cohesive
team,” he said.

Administration Professor Joesph
Goldsten acts as adviser to the four
students, and although they hold him
as their chief mentor, he downplays
his role, describing it as that of a
“facilitator.”

He said the games are valuable be-
cause they can learn the tricks of the
trade very quickly with little or no
risk. ‘“The experience a student gets
is the same he would get in the busi-
ness world,” he explained.

Although there are two dozen
teams in the games, each industry is
comprised of six teams; that is, W&L
is competing with only five other col-
lege-run phone corporations.

Each team is required to react to
the corporate moves and risks taken
by the other five companies in its in-
dustry.

Goldsten said the five companies
W&L is competing with will be kept

Lexington ranked second
in Va. in tax-free property

 

From Staff Reports

Lexington in 1983 had the second-
largest amount of tax-exempt pro-
perty compared to other Virginia
cities, according to a new University
of Virginia study.

The study showed that the 50.3 per-
cent of tax-free real estate that
makes up Lexington was exceeded
only by Portsmouth, which is com-
prised of 58.4 percent tax-exempt
property. The statewide median
among cities is 18.9 percent.

The survey by U.Va.’s Institute of

 

Government found that three out of
four localities with more than 30 per-
cent of their property in the tax-
exempt category were rated as
“poor” or “below average’ on a
fiscal stress index.
' Localities rated ‘‘good”’ on the in-
dex, on the other hand, all had 15 per-
cent or less tax-free land.
Washington and Lee University
and Virginia Military Institute pro-
perty is tax-free, which sharply re-
duces real estate revenues available
to the city. The schools pay a use tax
for city services to partially offset
the shortfall.

 

Drinking

 

O Continued from Page 1

1 to continue drinking.

Each bill now has gone to the other
house. Hargrove said each house pro-
bably will amend the other’s bill to
match its original version.

If both bills are passed by both
houses, the differences between the
bills will be worked out by a confer-
ence committee. If only one bill pass-
es both houses, it would become law
after being signed by Gov. Charles S.
Robb.

Hargrove, who opposed the mili-
tary base amendment, said that Sec-
retary of Defense Caspar Weinber-
ger recently issued a policy state-
ment requiring military personnel to
comply with the drinking laws of the
State in which they are based.

The federal government has
threatened to begin cutting off high-
way funds to states that have not
raised the drinking age to 21 by next
year. Because of this, although some
of his fellow legislators may now op-
pose his drinking age bill, Hargrove
said, ‘‘Ican assure you that by Oct. 1,
1986, they will have changed their
minds.”

Food Services Director Jerry Dar-
rell said a higher drinking age also

would cause some change in the
Cockpit.

“Next year we plan on shifting the
emphasis to our food,’’ Darrell said,
“if we try to rely on beer sales alone,
then we would probably have to
close.”

Darrell pointed out that while these
changes are being made to keep the
Cockpit open after the drinking age is
raised, they are also trying to make
the Cockpit more appealing to the
women who will be attending W&L
next year.

From Staff Reports

A bill requiring motorists to
wear seatbelts or face a $25 fine
has passed the House of Delegates
and now is before a Senate com-
mittee.

The House passed the bill, 52-48,
Saturday. The Senate Transporta-
tion committee is expected to be-
gin considering the bill next
Thursday.

The bill’s sponsor, Del. Sam
Glasscock, D-Suffolk, said in an
interview he is not sure how the
bill will fare in the Senate, which
has never considered it before.
“T’ve got to appear optimistic, but
I really don’t know,”’ he added.

Glasscock said more than 200
lives could be saved on Virginia
highways each year if motorists
wore seat belts. About 1,000 people
now die in automobile wrecks in
Virginia each year.

“There’s no question that it

 

 

. .
Motorists may have to buckle up

could be very effective,’’ said
Glasscock, adding that the bill
would require little cost on the
part of either the public or the
state.

The only problem, he said, is the
question of personal freedom.

“Should Big Brother be telling
folks to buckle up when they get in
their car?’’ Glasscock asked. “‘I
think it’s a reasonable infringe-
ment on one’s freedom.”’

The bill, which would become
effective Jan. 1, would require
motorists in the front seats of all
cars to wear seat belts. It includes
exemptions for those with medical
problems, rural mail and news-
paper carriers and policemen
transporting prisoners.

The Virginia State Police has
said it ‘‘will not go on a witch-
hunt”’ if the bill is passed, Glass-
cock said, but rather will enforce
the law in conjunction with other
traffic offenses.

Cagers drop four in a row

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Suffering injuries to its two top
scorers and rebounders, the Wash-
ington and Lee basketball team lost
four straight basketball games in the
last week. The Generals are now
11-11 overall with a 5-5 record in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference.

Senior captain Scott Shannon and
sophomore Jeff Harralson both suf-
fered ankle sprains last week. Shan-
non twisted his ankle with 10 minutes
left in Thursday’s loss to Emory and
Henry and missed games against
Lynchburg and Bridgewater on Sat-
urday and Monday. Harralson turned
his ankle in the Lynchburg loss and
missed last night’s defeat against
Elon.

Down by 20 points in the first half,
the Generals were able to cut the
Fightin’ Christians’ lead to three
points in the final seconds before los-
ing by a final score of 73-68 in the
Elon game last night in the Warner
Center.

Lex Fitzenhagen led the Generals
with 20 points and nine rebounds
while Shannon contributed 13 points
and 11 rebounds despite the nagging
ankle injury. Point guard David
Wilkinson also hit double figures for
W&L, tallying 14 on the evening.
Elon’s Robert Leak led all scorers
with 22.

Elon jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead
but the Generals rallied and tied the
game at six. The tie would not last,

though, as the Fightin’ Christians
proceeded to outscore the Generals
20-10 in the next 11 minutes to lead
36-16 with under four minutes to play
in the half. By the break the Elon
lead had been cut to 14 points at 42-28.

“We were too tentative on de-
fense,’’ said W&L head coach Verne
Canfield about his team’s first stanza
effort.

In the second half, the Generals cut
Elon’s lead down to 11 points several
times, but could not get it below 11 for
much of the final half.

But with 6:20 remaining in the
game, Fitzenhagen banked one high
off the glass while lying on his back to
bring W&L within nine. Shannon fol-
lowed with a basket that brought
W&L within seven at 61-54 with five
minutes remaining.

The Generals weren't done yet,
though. With :56 on the clock, Fitzen-
hagen hit Wilkinson with a fast-break
pass and the senior playmaker hit a
12-foot jumper to cut the lead to
seven. Seconds later and with his
team trailing by five, Shannon can-
ned a pair of free throws to bring the
Generals as close as they would get
at 69-66. Elon, however, was able to
hit its free throws down the stretch
and held on for its 16th win against
six defeats.

“‘We needed to show more patience
on offense in the second half,’’ Can-
field said. He credited the defense
with bringing the Generals back into
the game after trailing by 20 points
earlier in the contest.

The Ring-tum Phi

In other games last week, the Gen-
erals suffered three ODAC setbacks.
W&L dropped an 88-85 overtime
game at Emory and Henry Thurs-
day, lost 87-73 to Lynchburg Saturday
minus the services of Shannon, and,
without both Shannon and Harralson,
fell at Bridgewater, 83-59.

Although he played last night in
what Canfield described as a cour-
ageous performance, Shannon’s in-
jury has not yet healed. Things are

 

It’s a tangle of arms as Generals Lex Fitzenhagen and Harmen Harden

just dim for the sophomore Harral-
son’s injured ankle. Canfield said
that he really doesn’t know when the
forward will be able to return to the
court.

Saturday, the Generals take their
injury-plagued team to Roanoke to
face the arch-rival Maroons, current-
ly in second place in the ODAC. The
teams are scheduled to tip it off at
7:30 p.m. The game will be broacast
live by WLUR-FM.

Grapplers down two more foes, 11-2-1

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team raised its record to 11-2-1 with
victories over the University of
Scranton, 29-23, and host LaSalle,
36-18, at a triangular meet in Phila-
delphia last weekend.

Through a solid team effort, the
Generals were able to manage the
wins despite being without the ser-
vices of senior heavyweight Mark
Weaver and 190 |b. captain Jeff Dix-

on due to injuries.

Opening the attack on Scranton
was 118 lb. grappler Steve Castle,
who pinned his opponent at 3:35.
Scanton tied the contest at 6-6, but a
pin by Steve Pecora at 134 lbs., an 8-6
victory by Larry Anker at 142 lbs.
and a 10-2 win by Tim Walker at 150
Ibs. moved the Generals into a 19-6
lead. After the Generals lost at 158
Ibs., Win Phillips rolled up a second
period technical fall at 167 lbs., while
177 lb. grappler Joe O’Neil notched
an 11-1 victory.

Ruggers expect good team

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee Rugby
Club is expected to pick up where it
left off from its fall season, according
to captain Bill Jones, and that could
mean the squad’s best season ever.

“IT think this is going to be our best
season ever. We have a full squad of
guys who really want to play,”’ said
Jones, a junior, after the group’s first
practice Tuesday.

In the fall, the ruggers went 6-3,
and earned a ranking among the top
five teams in the state, according to
Jones. Scoring leaders were Jones,

David Arthur, P.J. lerardi and Pete
Papasavas.

That same group with some addi-
tions should steer the ruggers again
in their spring season. Along with
those four, Jones said leadership
should come from Greg Hair, in his
last season with the club, George
Boras, who plays the hooker position
(the player who controls the ball in
the middle of a scrum), and Nick
Berrents, who was out during the fall
season but should be a ‘“‘real asset”’
at scrum half, according to Jones.

The club, which practices on Mon-
days, Wednesdays and Thursdays,
has its first match March 2 at home
against New River.

The Generals applied persistent
forechecking early in the game as
they stifled Liberty Baptist’s offense.
W&L’s aggressive skating in the first
period paid off for the Generals as
they scored five times and limited
Liberty Baptist to one goal.

Ned Richardson and Jim Kelly
scored two goals each for the Gener-
als while Kevin Donovan, George
Corrigan, Burt Palmer, Jim Noble,
Ziggy Podleski and Vinny LaMotta
each contributed one.

Tom Haven and Bill Zola split the
goaltending duties for the Generals.
Zola had seven saves and Haven had
eight for the evening. W&L had 40
shots on goal compared to Liberty
Baptist’s 17.

The W&L hockey club expressed its
gratitude to its fans who showed up to
lend their moral support. The club’s
next game is Sunday at 8 p.m.
against the Roanoke Men’s League

What commissioners are saying is that the freedom given owners is

Swimmers

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team is back on the winning
track after beating Gettysburg Col-
lege 48-41 Monday at Twombly Pool
to raise its record to 6-1 with two dual
meets left in the season.

Before the Gettysburg meet the
Generals refused to predict an easy
meet. No one could mention Gettys-
burg without referring to the Frost-
burg-Georgetown meet (Jan. 19) in
which the Generals thought would be
an easy victory, but became.a very
tough meet. The team’s attitude was
that they couldn’t afford any poor
performances in order to win.

So the Generals swam well and
won. Maybe the score 48-41 doesn’t
look very impressive, but at one point
the Generals were leading 35-8 and
the meet was over.

“Gettysburg was a surprisingly
easy meet,’’ said Coach Page Remil-
lard. ‘‘They thought we were going to
kill them and they beat themselves
before the meet even started. They
could have beaten us if they had
come after us.”

Simon Perez swam in the breast
stroke for the first time this season
and won. Finally, Eric Sullivan, who
has been having a great season, won

both the 1000-yard freestyle (10:11)
and the 200-yard butterfly (2:05).
Both times were his best for dual
meets.

“Eric swam an intelligent race in-
stead of an emotional one,’’ com-
mented Remillard. ‘‘He’s an exciting
swimmer and this was his first smart
race.”

“I’m feeling good,” Sullivan said,
“Hopefully this weekend I’ll be able
to swim (the 1,000 free) in under
10:00.”

“I’m happy right now, but I like
things when they’re done and then I
can look at that board I know what
I've done. I’ve been swimming 10
years, and I know that with six weeks
left in the season, anything could
happen,” Sullivan said.

This weekend the Generals have a
tiring schedule. Friday night they
will swim against Mary Washington
and on Saturday they will travel to
Division I William and Mary.

“The team is swimming well and
staying quick so.I really don’t see
Mary Washington beating us,’’ said
Remillard. “I think the swimmers
who have not been standing out in
past meets will do very well.”

The Mary Washington meet will be
run on a coed format in conjunction
with the Mary Washington female
team swimming against Mary Bald-
win College.

On Saturday, Division I William
and Mary is expected to give the Gen-
erals tight competition and is being
looked at very closely by Remillard
and the swimmers.

“We're concerned about William and
Mary,” Remillard said. ‘Their

program could be in its last year and
we don’t plan to be their final victory.
If we beat them we will be 8-1 which
would be the best record at Washing-
ton and Lee in eight or nine years.
But we're not going to go to William
and Mary to be beaten up, we’re go-
ing in to win.”

“Coach is putting us all in our best
events” said senior Bobby Pearson.
“First couple of swims will decide
how the meet will go; I’d say we’re
favored.”

The William and Mary meet will be
the last dual-meet for seniors Bobby

ington and Lee.

“T look forward to Pearson and.
Smith doing well. They are both
great for the team, they keep the,
team going when things are going
bad,” said Sullivan. ‘I look up to’
them since they have stability and.
consistency. They work hard and
have good attitudes. I think they are’
going to swim great.”’

Coach Remillard closed by saying,
“I think Eric’s comment echoes the’
sentiments of the whole team, but I.
don’t think they’re going to swim
well, I know they will.”

Professor Hampden Smith, clad in pajamas, watching the bidding for the right to

“Back Page

The Ring-tum Phi

 

By BOB STRICKLAND
Staff Reporter

 

“I feel like I’m at a freak show at
the circus.”

‘“What’s wrong with diversity in
art?’’

“Sure, but where are the ink
blots?”

“It’s fun, it’s unique, one shouldn’t
be intimidated, but should partici-
pate.”

These and other comments can be
found in the guest book at du Pont
Gallery where “Revolutions Per
Minute”’ is on display until Feb. 23.
RPM, like Larry Stene’s sculpture in
the library, has become subject to
comment by both the ignorant and
those educated in art.

Whether one feels an artistic urge
to see the show or not, a stop by the
gallery will reveal 22 original works
by such renowned artists as William
Burroughs, Buckminster Fuller and
Chris Burden. The show has traveled
from London to West Germany and
throughout the United States.

The show is composed of 22 record-
ings one can listen to with head-
phones. Each piece, about the length
of a 45 RPM record, is accompanied
-with a proposed album cover design-
ed by each artist. The album was the
idea of Jeff Gordon, a music
writer/producer who has written
songs for artists as diverse as The
Spinners and Phillip Glass.

Most of the artists contributing to
the show are performance artists.
Performance art made its debut in
the 1960s when artists sought to rede-
fine art, especially in the areas of
dance and drama.

Artists such as Robert Rauschen-
berg left the canvas temporarily to
explore the aesthetics of happenings
and performance art. Happenings
and performance art often borrowed
from drama, literature and dance;
the aim is to create an art that cannot
be exploited by the mass media and
the commercial art market.

Performance art is meant to be
viewed by those truly interested in

 

art, not those who merely collect art
as an investment or a tax break. Po-
litical and social messages were
woven into the loosely designed
scripts of happenings in the 1960s.
Human action was turned into meta-
phor and the social issues and politics
of this turbulent decade were pre-
sented in a form that departed from
traditional artistic conventions.

Indeed, RPM challenges the con-
ventional definition of art. Here,
there are no paintings and no sculp-
tures. The traditional visual image is
translated into the audio language of
art. The viewer must adapt in order
to experience art through the ear,
rather than the eye. The works can
be divided into five different categor-
ies: sound work compositions, allego-
rical narratives, situations, songs
and heuristic texts.

The sound work compositions em-
phasize the properties of abstract
sound. These works resemble avant-
garde music of the post-World War II
period. David Smyth’s ‘‘Typewriter
in D’’ relies on the sound of three
typewriters arranged to construct a
soundscape of percussion. In Terry
Fox’s “Internal Sound,” music is
created by stretching two 300-foot
piano wires the length of a church;
the resulting effect is an electronic,
synthesized sound from a rather un-
orthodox acoustical instrument.

The works categorized as allegori-
cal narratives are closer to poetry
rather than music or abstract sound.
Chris Burden’s ‘‘Atomic Alphabet”’ is
a blunt, straightforward message
characteristic of his performance
art. In this piece, he rattles off the
alphabet in less than a minute
screaming, ‘‘A is for atomic, B is for
bomb....”

The situations emphasize a certain
event, whether real or fabricated.
“Site” is a recorded documentary of
comments of passers-by on an unus-
ual building (in this case, a Best Pro-
ducts Co. Inc. store) designed for the
sake of art.

The comments in the du Pont Gal-
lery guest book have yet to rival

RPM: A fusion of art,music

 

 

some of these armchair art historian
commentaries. Another outstanding
situation work is ‘‘Really, Is That A
Fact?” by Ida Applebroog. This re-
cording depicts the typical cliched
fragments of conversation at a cock-
tail party including, ‘‘really, is that a
fact?” The work then fades into a
surrealistic dream drama that would
be especially appreciated by a dream
analyst.

Most of the songs are professionaly
done. Of special notice is the work by
Les Levine. Hannah Wilke’s ‘‘Stand
Up” is a rather sophomoric attempt
to urge the listener to stand up for
what he believes (or in my case, to
leave this overly sentimental droodle
of a song.)

The last category involves the use
of heuristic texts. These texts are
cuts of lectures and monologues

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi
A student listens to one of the selections at the du Pont exhibit.

given by the artists. The rather vio-

lent performance artist Joseph
Beuys speaks at a lecture at Cooper
Union on topics ranging from Jack-
son Pollock to Elvis Presley. World-
renowned architect Buckminster
Fuller speaks of things I have neither
the patience or desire to understand.
These texts mainly treat aesthetic
theories and treatises on art.

Whether one is interested in exper-
iencing RPM as a serious and unique
collection of art or as a freak show, a
visit to du Pont is in order. The hours
of the Gallery are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3
p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Sunday. And, who knows, those who
come to listen expecting a laugh may
leave convinced of RPM’s true
worth.

 

 

Devils, whores offer melodrama and comedy

 

By TED BYRD
Staff Reporter

 

Two one-act plays will be perform-
ed in the Boiler Room Theater next
Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8
p.m.

The theater is in the basement of
Old Main Street Mall and is entered
from Henry Street.

The first play, ‘“The Devil and Dan-
iel Webster,’ is being directed by
Greg Stites, and the second, ‘The
Day the Whores Came Out to Play
Tennis,’ by Ned Richardson. Both
Stites and Richardson are junior dra-
ma majors doing the plays for the de-
partment’s directing class.

 

“The Devil and Daniel Webster,”
written by Stephen Vincent Benet in
1939, is about a New England farmer,
Jabez Stone, who sells his soul to the
devil. The play opens 10 years later,
in 1841, as the devil comes to collect
his debt at Stone’s wedding. Daniel
Webster, also attending the wedding,
turns the matrimonial proceedings
into a courtroom battle to help Stone
escape his obligation to the devil.

Stites calls the play a patriotic me-
lodrama, complete with villain, hero
and citizens in need of help. ‘I
thought it would be fun to do a melo-
drama and interesting to do a patri-
otic melodrama,” Stites said. ‘‘Peo-
ple will enjoy watching it — it’s a
melodrama in an extreme sense.”

The cast has 10 characters, includ-

ing one woman. Two men will play fe-
male roles that, although a result of
not being able to find women for the
roles, Stites believes will add to the
humor in the play.

‘‘The Day the Whores Came Out to
Play Tennis,” written by Arthur Ko-
pit, takes place at an exclusive coun-
try club that is ‘“‘invaded’’ by 18
whores one morning. They arrive in
two Rolls-Royces, repainted in a
style appropriate to their profession,
and proceed to start tennis games on
the club’s courts.

The cast includes the president of
the club and his son, one of the foun-
ders of the club, and his son, a mem-
ber and an English servant. Through-
out the play they try unsuccessfully
— to have the whores removed before
a neighboring club arrives for
“Visitor’s Day.”

Richardson believes that the play
addresses the incompetence of the
characters, their inability to work
together and, on a higher level, at-
tacks exclusive institutions in gener-
al. Decay is the overall concept, and
in the end the club is destroyed by the
whores.

Richardson first saw the play per-
formed in 1981, and then played one

SU CeeBsnD Ice

   

of the sons in a production his senior
year of high school. He decided last
year to use the play as his directing
project. ‘‘It’s a very funny play and
it’s an all-male cast, and since this is
still an all-male school we didn’t have
to go out and get people,’’ he said.
“They say it’s tough to do a play
you’ve been in but I don’t think it’s
been a problem for me because I saw
a good production before being in it.”

Admission to the plays is free, but
tickets should be reserved in advance
at the University Theatre box office.
“Basically we want to generate en-
thusiasm for the plays, and that’s

why there is no admission fee,’’ Stites

said. ‘‘This is experimental theater,
and we’d like to see a large crowd.”’

“It’s going to be a very interesting
night,” Richardson said, ‘‘because
the plays are very different, the first
one is a melodrama and mine’s a
comedy, and some of the actors are
in both plays.”

In addition to directing, Stites and
Richardson each have a role in the
other’s play, Richardson as the devil
in ‘‘The Devil and Daniel Webster,”’
and Stites as one of the sons in ‘‘The
Day the Whores Came Out to Play
Tennis.”’

‘Protocol’:

A tribute

to American ideals

MOVIEREVIEW

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

 

Goldie Hawn’s latest movie,
‘‘Protocol,”’ is a tribute to the Amer-
ican ideals of life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness and a satire of gov-
ernment misrepresentation of these
ideals. Though not consistently fun-
ny, itis an entertaining picture.

Goldie plays Sunny Davis, a cock-
tail waitress who unwittingly pre-
vents the assassination of a Middle
Eastern leader and becomes a na-
tional heroine. She is made a pawn in
a political chess game as the U.S.
government tries to exchange her for
a military base in that leader’s
strategically located country.

Sunny Davis is a part written for
Goldie Hawn. She is the perennial dit-
sy blonde, yet she seems, through

luck or hard work, to be ‘‘in the
right” constantly. Hawn seems very
familiar in this role, In fact, she
seems almost too familiar at times.

Buck Henry’s screenplay is a sa-
tire of the American system as it
works. There are bureaucrats who
take charge of situations, making
deals on their own initiatives without
consulting their ‘‘superiors.’’ There
are the media, who jump on the band-

wagon to make Sunny a hero, and -

then turn around to cover “Sunny-

gate.” Finally we see a young womar-

proud of her country, and ultimately
used by it.

Much is said, and though most of it
is funny at first, the story drags after
a while, only to pick up slightly
toward the end.

“Protocol’’ turns out to be a state-
ment about the way America views
itself. It is lighthearted satire and a
must for Goldie Hawn fans, but even
fans might lose interest when the sa-
tire seems forced and loses its bite. .

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

Big Apple
is job core

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Seniors at Washington and Lee
often are labeled as ‘‘slack,”’
apathetic and a host of other rather
unseemly terms. This time of year,
however, seniors throughout the
campus begin to panic. In fact, many
even begin to get ‘‘on the ball.”

The reason for this usually stems
from parental guidance in the form
of, ‘‘What the hell are you going to do
with your life after you graduate?
Your mother and I aren’t going to
support you for the rest of your life,
you know.”

So the average senior here at W&L,
with his Commerce School degree
nearly in hand, heads off for one of
the big cities to get into a “‘training
program’”’ with one of the larger
banks. Hopefully, that is.

Yet the thought of actually going to
the Big Apple or even Washington,
D.C., can cause many of the ‘‘South-
ern gentlemen’”’ of W&L to break out
into hives. One cannot forget that
these cities are, dare we say, Nor-
thern.

It often helps to know what to ex-
pect in applying for a job with a bank,
investment firm or some other type
of company that deals with money.

Job applications for positions with
monetary institutions usually follow
a set pattern, according to seniors
Bill Brown and Darby Brower.

Brown has decided to stay in the
South and has applied to various
banks in Atlanta, including Bank of
the South, Trust Company Bank and
First Atlanta. Brower, on the other
hand, feels New York is the place to
be and has applied to Bankers Trust,
Morgan Guaranty and Citibank.

The first step, obviously, is to ar-
range an interview. Both Brown and
Brower said the easiest way to do this
is through someone you know at the
bank. Fathers are great at helping
out at this, especially when one of
their fraternity brothers just hap-
pens to be the president of the bank
for which you want to work.

If you know absolutely no one in the
bank, your best bet is to write a letter
to either the personnel or human re-
sources department requesting an in-
terview.

In your letter you should include
both a cover sheet and a complete
resume. After sending in the packet,
you should hear from the bank in

Assistant Director of Admissions Julia Kozak reviews some of the applications for admission next fall.

Application record smashed

by 2,495 seek

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

More high school seniors applied for admission to
Washington and Lee this year than in any other year in
the school’s history, according to admissions counselor
Bennett L.:Ross.

As of Tuesday morning, the admissions office had re-
ceived 2,605 applications for admission in the fall. Ross
said the University will be accepting applications
through tomorrow, after which any applications receiv-
ed will be returned.

W&L has réceived: f:912"applications from’ men and ~

693 applications from women. In the University’s pre-
vious best recruiting year, 1982, 1,600 applications were
received.

‘“‘We’ve never had 2,605 people apply to W&L. It re-
presents a substantial increase over anything we've
ever had before,’’ Ross said.

With the large increase in the number of applicants
this year, the admissions office now faces the task of de-
termining what the yield — the number of students of-
fered admission who decide to accept — will be this
year. Ross said that in the past the University’s yield
has been in the range of 40 to 50 percent, but last year
the yield was low and W&L took students off the waiting
list to fill openings in the freshman class

“We are definitely concerned about yield,’’ Ross said.

Although the number of offers of admission that will
be extended has not been determined yet, W&L proba-
bly will be more conservative in the number of students
it offers admission, Ross said. This conservative ap-
proach is prompted by factors such as the tightness of
the housing situation, which makes it necessary to
avoid getting too large a freshman class, Ross explain-
ed.

‘Apathybusters’

Kathekon promotes W&L unity, spirit

 

ng 290 berths

He said the admissions office thinks there will pro-
bably be a higher yield among women than men. With
110 spots taken by early admissions applicants, a max-
imum of about 230 spots are left for men and about 60
spots for women in next year’s freshman class, Ross
said.

The number of students who will be extended offers of
admission will be determined after the admissions of-
fice has made its first review of all the applications,
Ross said. So far, fewer than 1,800 of the applications
have been reviewed, he added.

Admissions officers not only are trying to determine
which students are the most qualified for admission,
but also’which students have the strongest interest in
attending W&L, Ross said. Students with W&L far down
their list of preferred schools will have less chance of
receiving an offer than in past years, he said.

The admissions office is placing greater emphasis on
the interview, both to get a better idea of what kind of
person the applicant is and to see how interested the
person is in W&L, Ross said.

Having the prospective students come on campus for
an interview also helps to sell them on W&L, Ross
noted. Recruits sense the enthusiasm students have for
the college by talking to student guides or discussing
the school with an alumnus, he said.

Although no statistics are available yet, by every esti-
mate the applicants are of higher quality this year,
Ross said. Comparisons of this year’s early admissions
students and those accepted through early admission
last year show that this year’s students have higher ver-
bal and math SATs, and a greater percentage of stu-
dents ranked in the top fifth of their high school class,
Ross said.

The admissions office will send out decision letters to
applicants by March 28. Applicants must reply by May

Sophomore
Suspended
for assault

From Staff Reports

 

 

A sophomore from South Africa
has been suspended for the remaind-
er of the academic year for assault-
ing another foreign student and
breaking his nose.

The penalty was recommended by
the Student Control Committee and
approved by the Student Affairs
Committee, a faculty-student com-
mittee that reviews SCC decisions of
suspension or expulsion.

The Student Control Committee
does not release names of students it
disciplines.

The attack took place Dec. 26 ina
Woods Creek apartment, where the
two students were staying for Christ-
mas vacation, according to Dean of
Students Lewis G. John,

The South African student thought
his apartment-mate had used his pan
to cook meat, which is against his
religion, according to Darby Brower,
chairman of the Student Control
Committee.

The suspended student’s religion
‘‘was the most important thing in his
life,”’ said John Sicilian, Student Bar
Association president and a member
of both the SCC and the SAC.

Members of the two committees
took these religious beliefs into con-
sideration when making their deci-
sion, Sicilian said. He added, though,
that there was an ‘element of pre-
meditation.”’

The disciplinary committees also
considered whether a suspension was
too harsh a penalty for a foreign stu-
dent, the members said.

Because of the costs of returning to
this country and the difficulties of ob-
taining a visa, Sicilian said, a suspen-
sion might actually be a ‘de facto ex-
pulsion.”’

‘He did something that was irra-
tional at the time,”’ Sicilian said. Sus-
pension, though, ‘‘puts him ina situa-
tion where he could never attempt to
reach the height that he was at that
point.”’

A round-trip plane ticket from
South Africa to the United States
costs about $3,000, and the average
family income there is $600 a year,
Sicilian said.

The student will be eligible to re-
turn to the University in the fall, John
said,

The Student Control Committee
voted 8-0 in favor of the suspension,
and the Student Affairs Committee

approved it by a 5-4 vote.

Student found dead

 

From Staff Reports

 

Sophomore football player Paul R.
Strange died early Saturday of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound, authorities
said,

Strange, a 20-year-old from Falls
Church, was a Dean’s List student
who planned to major in physics and
engineering. He was buried yester-
day at Arlington National Cemetery.

Medical Examiner Dr. E.V. Brush
ruled the death a suicide. He said
medical tests have not been complet
ed.

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said the body was discovered by one
of Strange’s roommates at 4 a.m. He
said the death occurred at about 3
a.m. The weapon was a .22-caliber ri-
fle.

Strange lived in a Lexington house
with four members of Phi Kappa Psi.
Friends said he attended a Phi Psi
party Friday night.

Police records show that the last

 

previous suicide by a Washington
and Lee student occurred in the same
house as last weekend's death, but in

“Paul was just a real dedicated
guy who worked hard when he was
out there,”’ he said. “It was a real
tragedy.”

Newbolt said Strange ‘‘wasn’t a
noisy person.”’

‘He was not real talkative, but he
was a good conversationalist in a
one-to-one situation,’ he said. ‘‘He
had interesting ideas about things.”’

At the memorial service, Universi-
ty Chaplain David W. Sprunt spoke of
‘a sense of guilt, a sense of fail-
ure...reminding us of all that we
could have done — but left undone —

so much to others but was unable to

OPINION
June:

Page 2
February 14, 1985

The anniversary

When he returned to Washington and Lee to deliver a nos-
talgic Founders’ Day address last month, former University
President Robert E.R. Huntley touched, too briefly, on the
tradition and history that is Washington and Lee. In passing,
he mentioned the granting of the University’s first charter, in
1782, and the awarding of its first degrees, in 1785 to 12 young

gentlemen.

Accordingly, this year will mark the 200th anniversary of
those first graduation ceremonies. With the hustle and bustle
of a transition between presidents, the anniversary of the
charter in 1982 somehow was overlooked. The anniversary of
the first commencement exercises should not receive the

same treatment.

University administrators apparently are planning to
mark the graduation anniversary in some way. Although this
certainly is a justifiable end, we question their means.

Rather than commemorate the first graduation during the
200th graduation in June, the University apparently plans to
postpone the bicentennial until September. Among other rea-
sons, this would be done in an effort to attract some of the in-
evitable media coverage from the first class of women.

To even consider marking the anniversary of a graduation
at any time other than at another graduation is all but ridicu-
lous. The circumstances surrounding this occasion make it

even moreso:

eThe graduation of the Class of 1985, in June, not Septem-
ber, will be the 200th graduation of a class from Washington
and Lee University. By September, members of that 200th

class will be gone and forgotten.

eThe first graduation did indeed take place in September,
on the second Wednesday of September 1785. This provides
the only justification for holding the bicentennial celebration
in September, but only if it were held 200 years to the day
from the first graduation. This probably would not happen,
though, because most students will not even be on campus by

the actual day.

The controversy, if indeed there is any, about when to cele-
brate the bicentennial of the first Washington and Lee com-
mencement exercises is silly at best. There should be no con-
troversy. To commemorate the bicentennial at any time
other than in June would be a classic case of a good idea gone

awry.

Giving life meaning

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott
Tilley

 

I was stunned when I heard the
news of Paul Strange’s death. I did
not know Paul, but within our com-
munity here at Washington and Lee,
news with such tragic implications
affects each of us deeply. I, too, feela
loss.

We may never know the reasons
behind his action. That is often the
case with suicides. Many times,
though, suicides occur for one reason
— a failure to find a purpose in life.
William Blake put it a different way:
By becoming lost in the finite, we lose
our sense of the infinite.

Our world today is the most relig-
ious in history. Whether the object of
the quest — the thing being worship-
ped — is money, a god, Buddha,
drugs or even academic achieve-
ments, people want something to
give meaning to their lives.

We seek the four ‘‘P’s’” — power,
prestige, possessions and pleasure
—to give our lives a sense of signifi-
cance. Our time on this earth is rela-
tively short — we want it, we need it
to have purpose.

Through the annals of time, this
has been the case — even from man-
kind’s second generation: Cain and
Abel. When Cain slew his brother, the
punishment bestowed by God was not
death, but a fate far worse than death
—a loss of purpose in life. Cain was a
farmer, with fruit from the ground
providing meaning to his life. Upon
his action, though, the ground he till-
ed became barren He was doomed to
wander the land, his purpose taken
away.

but ‘‘religious,’’ I at the same time
am confident that I have found my
purpose and meaning in life. They
have been given to me by Jesus
Christ.

Evidence proves the existence of a
Jesus as a historical figure. And
many of us go a step further and ac-
cept him as a good moral teacher.
But how can we accept him as a good
moral teacher when he claimed to
have dominion over our lives and
destinies, unless we acknowledge
these claims on our lives as well?

He claimed to be ‘‘the way, the
truth and the life.’’ Either we can
acknowledge our faith in these
claims or reject it. As Josh McDowell
put it, we have to accept Christ as
Lord, liar or lunatic.

If we decide to acknowledge this,
and make Christ’s life our life, then
we no longer need to worry about our
life here and the problems that we en-
counter. On the eternal scale, they
somehow seem to lose their signifi-
cance. We can regain our sense of the
infinite. It gives our lives the mean-
ing we so desperately seek.

Christ’s commandment to us is not
to be religious, to follow a list of do’s
and don’ts and to try to get more pos-
itive marks than negative so that we
can make it to heaven. That is the
“religious” view of life.

Rather, he said to love God with all
of our heart, soul, mind and strength,
and to love our neighbor as ourself.
Upon these rest all of the law and
commandments, and in these will
you find life.

So life is not found in drugs, suc-
cess, wealth or Buddha. It’s not even
found in ‘religious’ practices such
as teetotaling and going to church
once a week.

Rather, it is found in loving Christ.
That is how we transcend the finite
mirages of this world to achieve the
infinite security awaiting us. That is
the purpose of life — and what gives
itits meaning.

Lee:

University Historian I. Taylor
Sanders II says that with the advent
of coeducation, he frequently hears
the question, ‘‘What can Robert E.
Lee do for young women?” Dr.
Sanders says we’ll have to stop think-
ing of Lee simply as a role model for
young men, but will have to expand
our view to include other facets of his
‘complete, well-integrated per-
sonality — the nurturing side of
humanity that he picked up from his
mother.”’ Following are excerpts
from remarks by Dr. Sanders to the
Alumni Association’s Lee Day
celebration Jan. 18.

Part 2 of a two-part series.

One hundred years ago, an entire
generation knew Lee as the man who
combined the idealism and roman-
ticism of the Old South with a vision
for a New South based on practical,
industrial development. In time, he
became known as a saintly man,
nearly Christ-like, aloof and duty-
bound — a ‘‘marble man” on his own
distant Olympus. Freeman knew him
as a good man, a simple man; a man

’

 

To the Editors:

Many times over the years I
thought of writing a letter to The Phi
expressing my disgruntled opinion on
the EC or coeducation or any number
of matters, yet I always decided to
reserve my opinions for my friends
and myself.

However, I write now to the W&L
community, not merely on my opi-
nion, but rather on matters I see as
facts (in my opinion, of course),
something that I can speak on with
some authority. For years I have
worked in Evans Dining Hall, the
past two years as student manager. I
have worked in nearly all areas at
the Dining Hall and naturally have
worked a great deal with Wanda Cof-
fey-Bailey. This is what I wish to ad-
dress — not her complaints with the
Dining Hall, but her difficulties with
the administration. Coffey-Bailey
had some legitimate complaints of

sex discrimination, yet when she ap-
proached the administration she was
met with criticism and more discrim-

shrouded in no secrets. Each genera-
tion has found its own Lee. What
about our own fragmented, post-
industrial world, with its emphasis
on over-specialization and its turning
away from self-denial and _ self-
control toward selfish consumerism,
narcissism, self-promotion — in fact,
all those elements of self-fulfillment,
hedonism and craving for leisure and
personal possessions that have
become synonymous with ‘“Yup-
pies?” Is there a Lee worth-the-
knowing for us?

We can know Lee as a complete
human being, exemplifying what the
Greeks called sophrosyne — whole-
mindedness, or moderation. Lee was
not without personal means — his
estate was not a small one — and he
loved elegant things, yet he practiced
what he preached and he lived
modestly in ‘‘comfortable sub-
sistence.”” The engineer, the prac-
tical Lee, who was also the Romantic
idealist, may have been his happiest
when studying Spanish literature. He
was a professional who regretted
that he had not received more of a

ination. The administration, includ-
ing President Wilson, never gave her
complaints serious examination. In-
stead, the administration circled
their wagons of defensive intoler-
ance. Why was she not treated fair-
ly? Why was she harassed and prac-
tically hounded out of her job? Some
charge that she was incompetent.

But from my own experiences and,

from the views of a great many other
Dining Hall employees (students and
full-time staff), I assert that this is
completely false.

Even after speaking with Presi-
dent Wilson, I can not understand
why an objective member of the ad-
ministration could not have earnestly
listened to her complaints, examined
both sides sorting through the half-
stories and charges of both sides
— and reached something approach-
ing a fair solution, Instead, the
administration ignored valid com-
plaints and pushed Coffey-Bailey out
of sight.

Coach seeks lost jacket

To the Editors:

As the week draws to a close and
Washington Holiday approaches, the
W&L baseball team would like to
thank all the faculty, staff and stu-
dents who supported us in our fund-
raising efforts. Your support in our
fruit sale and whiffle ball marathon
is much appreciated. Through your
efforts and those of the team, we
have reached our goal and will be
spending next week in Florida pre-
paring for our upcoming baseball
season. We hope that you continue to
support us by venturing up to Smith
Field to watch us in action.

The team and I, however, would
like the help of the W&L community
in one additional situation. Some
time ago a new baseball jacket was
removed from the stadium equip-
ment room. If anyone has any infor-
mation regarding the jacket, please
contact Murph, the athletic depart-
ment or myself. The Jacket is royal
blue with ‘‘Generals” in white script
sewn on front. Our primary concern
is the return of the jacket. Thank you
for your cooperation, support and
concern.

Method cruel, unusual

To the Editors:

The Supreme Court of the United
States must decide whether the fed-
eral Food and Drug Administration
should regulate certain drugs used to
execute condemned prisoners. The
method involves the use of FDA-ap-
proved drugs, by non-doctors, in a
new, non-therapeutic and non-medi-
cal fashion for which their safety and
effectiveness have never been tested.
A catheter is injected into the crim-
inal’s arm. Then a drug is dripped in-
to the plastic tubing which flows into
the blood stream. One drug is an ul-
trashort-acting barbituate, sodium
thiopental, which works on the cen-
tral nervous system. Its function is to
put out the “‘light of consciousness.”

A second drug as specified in prison
memoranda written to carry out new
laws would be a muscle relaxant,
either tubocurarine, a purified form
of the curare used on arrow tips by
South American Indians, or succiny-
choline chloride. Unfortunately, if
the tactile sensory is active from in-
adequate dosage or improper admin-
istration of the thiopental, the con-
scious prisoner would receive a sen-
sation of ‘‘multiple shocks over the
entire body with erratic muscle
twitching followed by acute paralysis
and suffocation,” says one anesthesi-
ologist of the succinycholine chlo-
ride. It all sounds pretty unusual to
me, if not cruel, don’t you think?”’

‘Marble man’ on own Olympus

liberal education, He was a man who
was brave, without bravado. He was
athletic, virile and courageous, yet
he was also compassionate, nurtur-
ing, modest and patient. Graceful
and neat, without being vain, prissy
or conceited, he also was perceptive,
sentimental and emotional. Idealistic
and humanistic, he was practical, in-
dependent and competitive. A high
achiever, he bore failure with grace.
His sense of honor was chivalric
without swagger; his definition of a
gentleman stressed kindness toward
subordinates, rather than the
shallow, material symbols of status.
He was proud, without being
prideful; gentle, without being
passive; devout, without being prig-
gish; and strong, without being
ashamed of publicly shedding heart-
felt tears. He led without being
dogmatic and dominated without be-
ing domineering. A leader who was
no martinet, he guided men in ways
of self-discipline, self-denial and duty
by his own un-selfconscious example.
Deeply aware of, and even concerned
about, his own strong attraction to

philosophy says that W&L “stresses
the importance of the individual, his

Girls will be girls?

Tothe Editors:

In the Feb. 7 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi, Steven Pockrass wrote about
Dean Simpson’s suggestions to the
Executive Committee concerning co-
education. In the article, Mr. Pock-
rass quoted Dean Simpson as saying
that the EC ‘‘must have a common-
sensical attitude’”’ in adjusting to the
differences that coeducation will
bring. Mr. Pockrass went on to state
that ‘Simpson also indicated a need
for the EC to be prepared for ‘girls-
will-be-girls’ incidents that could be
construed as honor violations.” I

 

the glories of the battlefield, he was

most comfortable with small
children, whom he petted and
adored.

The memory of Lee on Traveller
was a common one around post-war
Lexington. So was the scene of the
elderly gentleman with his market
basket, moving through the streets of
town doing his family’s shopping. A
man of war, he ended his life among
scenes of rural domesticity, amid the
ultimate expression of his hope in the
future: a new generation. His hope
for them was simple: to succeed
where his generation had failed.

To know Lee is to know a person
who embodied all those elements of
wholeness that human beings, male
or female, should cherish and
engender in their own lives. Next fall
a new (and for us unusual) genera-
tion of Washington and Lee students
will find much to ponder as it works
out its own living relationship with
Lee. So a toast, one raised in officers’
messes and around campfires during
the late unpleasantness: ‘To the
Ladies. ..and General Lee.”’

tude of the administration react to
complaints that are bound to arise in
future years with coeducation? The
hostile, defensive reaction of the ad-
ministration in answer to Coffey-Bai-

serious problem.

Leash all dogs, or else

To the Editors:

Dogs on campus are becoming a
problem. One jumped a campus
mailman. They are entering build-
ings and making messes. They are
fighting and disrupting classes, dig-
ging holes in lawns and damaging
campus plantings.

Dog owners are reminded that Lex-
ington has a strict leash law. It pro-
vides that dogs are not to be allowed
to run at large; they must be under
the control of their owners or custo-
dians by means of a leash, chain or
rope when off the owner’s property.

Fines ranging from $5 to $25 are pre-
scribed for violations of the ordi-
nance.

Please take notice that the Univ-
ersity intends to invite the dog war-
den onto the campus to impound dogs
running at large. Dogs impounded
will be taken to the local SPCA shel-
ter, where they will be held for a li-
mited period until claimed. Dogs not
claimed after five days may be dis-
posed of.

24-hour library unique

To the Editors:

An Open Statement to University
President John Wilson, Dean of the
College John Elrod, and Professor
Lamar Cecil Jr. (Chairman of the Li-
brary Advisory Committee):

We, the members of Pi Sigma Al-
pha, are firmly resolved that the
abandonment of the University Li-
brary’s 24-hour policy is not in the
best interest of Washington and Lee
University. We believe that:

eThe 24-hour policy contributes
greatly to the academic quality of the
University by guaranteeing access to
academic resources and to quiet
places to study ;

eThe 24-hour policy is a unique
aspect of the University that is a
strong selling point for prospective
students;

*The potential monetary savings of
a limited-use policy are far exceeded
by the potential intangible costs of
limiting University Library hours.

We hope that the administration
realizes that the overwhelming stu-
dent sentiment is for maintaining the
aes policy and will act according-

The first interview is a type of
screening in which the interviewer
checks to see if you can back up your
resume, according to Brown. It is a
chance for the bank to see how com-

. mitted you are to working for it.

Tom Pearce, a _ senior from
Alabama who also is applying for
jobs at several New York banks, said

- Southerners are already at a disad-

vantage just by being from the South.
He said that many Northern bank-

tye ing firms are leery of Southerners for

dents from here cannot handle the

Parker said he thinks that word
processors help people organize their
thoughts.

“Here in this department what
we're interested in is people’s prose
.. getting to say what you mean,” he
said.

With a word processor, a student
can enter his text and read what he
has written. He then can employ the
many editing capabilities to com-
plete his ‘‘orderly thinking,” accord-
ing to Parker,

“It’s as exciting as all get out,’’ he
said.

“T came here knowing how to use a
word processor,’’ added Parker, who
spent two days on one such machine
at the University of Washington,
writing a 350-page dissertation.

“T’ll show anybody how to use the
machines,’’ he said. ‘‘I’ll get them
started.

“Aside from the initial shock, you
get hooked,’’ Parker added.

The room of microcomputers in
Newcomb Hall was a test of the need
for such machines on campus, ac-
cording to Parker.

“‘A political campaign is not an in-
tellectual excercise,” he said, de-
lighting in the understatement.

Instead it’s an excercise in phone
banks, direct mail and shoe leather.
Colvin’s practitioners of all of the
above will have a slightly more re-
ceptive audience in the city than in
the county, he expects.

He explained that because Lexing-
ton has a large academic population,
it tends to have a larger Democratic
vote than Rockbridge County, which
is more conservative. Also, he said
there is a larger black vote in the city
than inthe county.

When Davis officially launched his
campaign in December, an issue that
was raised was whether he could
overcome the liberal label Baliles
and others frequently pin on him.

“‘T would argue they are both mod-
erate,’ Colvin said. ‘‘Davis is more
liberal than Baliles. It’s more a
moderate against a conservative.”’

“T think Virginia is becoming a
moderate state,’’ Colvin said. ‘‘The
old Byrd machine has been largely
dismantled and some elements of it
have come back into the camp of the
moderates.”’

He said the increasingly moderate

~-cast-efthe Commonwealth electorate

is due partially to the increasing im-
portance of the black vote and the in-
flux of new families into Northern
Virginia.

“That’s what elected Robb gover-
nor, and that’s what elected Davis
lieutenant governor,’’ he said.

Virginia’s equivalent of a primary

to campus was across the bridge
along the road to the military science
building. Then some students started
jumping across the creek or crossing
it on stepping stones, Arthur said.
Rather than risk having someone fall
in — and to make getting to campus
easier — a wooden bridge was added
near the Central apartment building.

The original wooden bridge was re-
placed two summers ago witha pour-
ed concrete bridge built by buildings
and grounds workers.

During normal weather the bridge
usually is clear, but when it rains de-
bris often gets clogged underneath it,
making water run over the bridge
and up the embankments on the side
and forcing students to use the larger
bridge.

“The plan was to put ina bridge for
non-flood times,’’ Arthur said, noting
that students can use the other bridge

In any event, the first interview
usually lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
In about two weeks you will receive a
letter from the bank that will either
give you the old form rejection slip or
ask you back for another interview.

If you can get asked back to this
second interview, you are halfway in
the door. The bank will pay for all
your expenses, from airfare (or gas
money) to hotel reservations, food al-
lowances and cab fare.

The second interview gives the
bank the chance to look you over one
more time and also gives them a
chance tosell themselves to you.

In this interview, you usually will
spend the day with the company. In-
terviews will be scheduled with be-
tween five and eight people in var-
ious positions within the bank, from
vice presidents on down. Often a ma-
jor part of the day will be with so-
meone who has just finished a train-
ing program or is currently in one.

Remember, you must sell yourself
and not wait for them to take the ini-
tiative. All three seniors said you
should prepare for the interview by
learning as much about the company
as possible. Finally, be prepared to
answer the following three questions.
First, why us? Second, why banking?
and third, why are your qualifica-
tions better than some other stu-
dent’s?

“The experiment, in a sense, has
been successful,”’ he said.

Parker remembers when three of
the five machines were in use 24
hours a day during the last weeks of
the fall term.

Currently, the microcomputer
room is locked during the night, but
certain students do have keys and
will open the room at any time.

“Our ideal is for the place to be
open 24 hours a day,”’ Parker said.

The machines are available on a
first-come, first-served basis and can
be reserved for up to three hours.

The University’s five-year plan to
upgrade the student computer sys-
tem includes the addition of micro-
computers to the library, the Com-
merce School, Robinson Hall and
Parmly Hall at a cost of about $900
for each Kaypro II model.

Also, the microcomputers on the
third floor of Newcomb Hall will be
moved toa larger room on the second
floor, allowing space for additional
microcomputers and new computer
terminals.

is the series of mass meetings that is
held across the state to elect dele-
gates to the state Democratic con-
vention in June. Mass meetings will
be held March 31 or April 1.

“It’s really critical to turn out the
vote in the mass meetings,”’ Colvin
said. ‘‘Whichever candidate comes
out of the mass meetings with the
strongest delegation is likely to be
the candidate.”

“Davis is going to win’’ in Novem-
ber, Colvin said confidently. ‘‘But
first he has to beat Baliles.”’

Davis’ assets include the fact that
he is well-known across Virginia
after having run two previous state-
wide campaigns, the professor said.
“Davis has just been in politics
longer,” he said.

He added that Davis, who was a
Marine officer in World War II and
the Korean War, has the strong back-
ing of veterans, an important seg-
ment of the Virginia electorate.

Colvin said the crucial areas for
Davis will be the 10th District in the
Washington, D.C., suburbs (‘‘the
swing or critical district’) and the
Tidewater area, which includes Nor-
folk (‘‘aboom city”’).

“If he can hold on in Tidewater,

win decisively in the 10th District and_

do well in the 3rd and 4th Districts
[Richmond and Tidewater], then he
is a likely winner,” Colvinsaid.

He said Richmond is important be-
cause that’s the home of Baliles.
“That'll be a tough struggle,’ he
said. Davis is the former mayor of
the 4th District’s Portsmouth.

‘Woods Creek: Water over the bridge

in all weather.

Although there are not any plans to
modify the bridge or build a new one,
Arthur said the University will con-
tinue to reinforce the shore near the
bridge, where erosion caused by
flood waters has been a problem.

Although Arthur said the foot-
bridge probably will not be improv-
ed, he noted that paths around the
apartments have been graded and
covered with gravel, replacing the
old and expensive wood bark surface.

Ultimately, Arthur said, he hopes
the gravel will be packed down,
forming a firm surface and requiring
less maintenance.

Arthur said the University also
plans to put gravel on the Chessie
Trail throughout the University’s
property. Much of the trail has al-
ready been covered, and the job will
be finished in the spring.

Red Cross gets
292 units in drive

From Staff Reports

 

 

The American Red Cross Blood-
mobile collected 292 pints of blood
from stops at Washington and Lee
University and Virginia Military In-
stitute last week.

At the stop at W&L on Tuesday,
sponsored by Chi Psi fraternity, don-
ors contributed 134 pints. The goal for
the visit was 150.

According to senior Tim Considine,
who headed the drive for the fraterni-
ty, bad weather and illness were to
blame for the lower than expected
turn out. Kappa Sigma fraternity do-
nated the most pints, 14, of any W&L
organization.

During the stop at VMI on Satur-
day, 158 pints were donated by the ca-
dets. Their contribution easily
exceeded the goal of 100.

at mock U.N.

From Staff Reports

 

 

Seven Washington and Lee
students, representing the Soviet
Union, won second place at the
Princeton University Model United
Nations Conference last weekend at
Princeton.

The students, all members of the
International Club, repeated the per-
formance by last year’s W&L delega-
tion, which also won second place.

Three W&L students received per-
sonal honors at the conference. Jun-
ior Bart Smith, representing the
USSR on the Social and Human-
itarian Committee, won best dele-
gate in that committee, and senior
Jon Zagrodzky won best delegate for
the second year in a row in the Gener-
al Assembly. Sophomore Rick
Graves received an honorable men-
tion for his representation on the In-
ternational Court of Justice.

Top delegation awards went to the
West Point delegation, representing
Egypt. Other schools in the confer-
ence included Georgetown, Cornell,
the University of Pennsylvania and
the University of Virginia.

One of the advantages of the micro-

CRs hold convention,
draw state candidates

 

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee’s College
Republicans won one and lost one at
the annual state convention this
weekend: they were named best club
of their size in the state for the second
consecutive year, but one of their
members lost his bid for statewide of-
fice.

W&L and Hollins co-sponsored the
gathering, the first convention to
be held at the just-completed Roa-
noke Marriott Hotel. The two-day
event drew 300 students from 28 clubs
from around Virginia.

A bit of real politicking accompan-
ied the festivities: the five Repub-
lican candidates for lieutenant gover-
nor, the attorney general candidate
and representatives of the two guber-
natorial candidates made appear-
ances, hoping to gain support for
their candidacies in the upcoming
state elections.

Entertainment included a perfor-
mance by W&L’s Jazz Band, directed
by Robert Stewart, at the ball that
followed the convention. :

W&L was named Virginia’s best
medium-sized club, a category that
includes three-fourths of the CR
clubs. The W&L group also walked
away with the award for the best
scrapbook.

Junior Gerald D. Shepherd, whose
bid for statewide office consumed the
attention of the W&L delegation, said
Virginia has the ‘‘most active, best
organized, most effective’ College
Republican organization in the coun-
try.

He said its 6,000 members also
make it the nation’s largest. ‘From
what I gather, it’s amazing the dif-
ference between Virginia and other

states,” he said.

Despite his enthusiasm for the or-
ganization and after campaigning all
year, Shepherd was unsuccessful in
his effort to become second vice
chairman of the College Republican
Federation of Virginia.

He said he’d been interested in
seeking office for several years, and
finally decided that because he “‘had
something to offer the CRs,” he
should run.

Senior Scott Tilley, executive di-
rector of the Federation, was the del-
egate who nominated Shepherd.
‘“‘When it came down to the roll call,
the votes just weren’t there,” he said.

“Our campaign lost a lot of mo-
mentum when the candidate at the
top of ticket pulled out of the chair-
man’s race and accepted the first
vice-chairman’s spot.”

Tilley said that Friday night while
other delegates were ‘‘getting
wasted”’ at the candidates’ hospitali-
ty suites, a few were involved in
“hard-core politicking.”

“We were plugging information
about Gerald’s campaign into a com-
puter,”’ Tilley said. ‘‘We tried all dif-
ferent scenarios. Through these, we
thought the votes were there until the
other candidate pulled out.”’

“After that, we saw there was no
way we could win,’ he added.

Shepherd said that at that point he
decided not to continue his race. ‘‘We
had given it an awful lot of thought,
and decided that we didn’t want a
showdown,” he said.

Tilley nominated Shepherd any-
way, reading the delegates Robert E.
Lee’s definition of a gentleman.
Shepherd received a standing ova-
tion and then withdrew his nomina-
tion.

‘‘We went out inclass,”’ Tilley said.

Arby’s drive-by OK’d

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Arby’s Restaurant plans to open a
drive-by window following approval
by the Lexington City Council last
Thursday.

City Council granted the restau-
rant a conditional use permit for the
window, on the side of Lee Manor.

The permit states that Arby’s may
operate a drive-by window as long as
it does not create inconveniences to
the people of Lexington. Such pro-
blems would include blocking the
sidewalk or backing up traffic on
Main Street, according to Lexington
City Manager John V. Doane.

Doane said if there were document-
ed evidence of any kind of violation of
the permit, the zoning administrator
would revoke the conditional use per-
mit and Arby’s could no longer con-
duct business through the drive-by
window.

Approval came despite questions

raised by City Council members and
a negative recommendation by the
city manager.

Doane had recommended to the
council not to approve the permit due
to the problems that might be caused
by the addition of a drive-by window.

Doane said there was concern
about traffic problems as well as
about the effect of the increased traf-
fie on the elderly residents of Lee
Manor.

Council member Sue LaRue ex-
pressed concern about the extension
of ‘‘police powers”’ to Arby’s employ-
ees in order to maintain the flow of
traffic around the drive-by area. She
also said council should consider that
Arby’s will be spending the money to
construct the drive-by window and
the permit could very well be taken
away.

Clyde Mull, spokesman for Arby’s
at the meeting, said the Arby’s man-
agement is aware of the possibility of
having the permit revoked but said
he felt Arby’s could properly manage
the area.

EC budget healthy,
administrators say

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee’s
budget, which funds 15 student or-
ganizations, is in good shape this
year and is unlikely to result in a
deficit similar to last ye2r’s, accor-
ding to the student and Untv ersity of-
ficials responsible for it.

EC Vice President James White,
who is in charge of the budget, and
University Treasurer E. Stewart Ep-
ley, who oversees the organizations’
funds as they leave the Business Of-
fice, said this week that the EC is
keeping student organizations fiscal-
ly responsible.

“They are all going well and
[White] is doing an outstanding job of
tracking each organization and its
budget,” Epley said.

“The organizations have been in-
credibly responsible with their funds,
compared to last year,”’ White said.
“It’s really a good sign when the Stu-
dent Activities Board is in the
black.”’

The SAB received more money
than any other organization
—$42,450. The nature of the SAB,
which risks large sums of money to
book bands and then receives
revenue on the whim of partiers,
makes it difficult to predict its in-
come, White said.

Only one organization is projecting
a deficit: the Hockey Club, which has
told the EC it expects to finish the
year more than $220 in the red.

Last year both the SAB and the
Mock Convention were $2,400 in the
red, as deficits of all organizations
depleted the $7,000 in the student
body reserve fund and resulted in an
overall deficit of $1,411.

In addition, the speaker sympo-
sium Contact still is paying off a
$15,000 debt it accumulated between
1982 and 1984.

Those deficits prompted White to
call this a ‘‘trial year’’ for the budget.
‘We started out the year wanting to

run a tight ship,”’ he said.

Because of that tight ship, the EC
has been able to spend some of the
$7,200 in its reserve fund, which is
earmarked for deficits or new organ-
izations.

The Film Society was awarded an
additional $200 at the beginning of the
year, and a new publication, The
Journal of Science, was given $550
last month.

The $100,000 distributed by the EC
in the fall came from the student tax,
which is paid along with tuition by
undergraduate and law students.
This year the tax was $100 — $75 for
the student budget and $25 for the stu-
dent activities pavilion.

The EC decided not to recommend
an increase in the student tax for
next school year for several reasons,
White said.

The student tax was raised $5 last
year for the Mock Convention, infla-
tion has been low, and ‘‘we don’t real-
ly anticipate too many clubs going in-
to the red,’’ White explained.

The Board of Trustees approved
next year’s tuition with a student tax
of $100 at its meeting three weeks
ago.

The EC monitors the organiza-
tions’ budgets by having the groups
make budget reports several times
throughout the year. That system en-
countered difficulties early in the
year, when organizations repeatedly
failed to show up at the Monday night
EC meetings to make their reports.

“We did have a communication
problem at the beginning of the
year,” White said. ‘‘([EC Secretary]
Sam [Dalton] had a hard time some-
times contacting some of the peo-
ple.”

That problem was rectified when
the EC put mailboxes in the Student
Center for all organizations, White
said.

“When they do show up, they cer-
tainly have good budget reports and
have stayed on top of their funds,’’ he
added.

Stricter rules proposed
for honor confidentiality

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

Stiffer penalties for discussing
possible Honor System violations or
Executive Committee hearings could
be in store for Washington and Lee
students if a proposed White Book
revision is approved.

According to discussion at Mon-
day’s EC meeting, President Cole
Dawson has asked senior representa-
tive Bob Tomaso to draft a revision of
Section III, Part O of the White Book
concerning the procedure for an Exe-
cutive Committee hearing.

The section currently reads: ‘‘All
information about a possible Honor
System violation or an E.C. Hearing
is considered highly confidential. The
E.C. will take necessary disciplinary
steps against a student who breaks
confidentiality. Possible disciplinary
steps include: a reprimand, removal
of office or position, suspension and
probation.”’

The proposed change reads: ‘All
information about a possible Honor
System violation or an E.C. Hearing
is considered highly confidential.
The E.C. will take necessary
disciplinary steps against any stu-
dent who breaks confidentiality. An
E.C. member may be reprimanded,
placed on probation for one or more
hearings, or suspended from office.

of an E.C. hearing may be repri-
manded, placed on social or conduct
probation, or suspended from the
University.

“The E.C. recognizes that exten-
uating circumstances may exist. The
President of the E.C. shall decide
whether a situation merits extenua-
tion.”’

EC Vice President James White,
filling in for an absent Dawson, re-
commended that the EC vote on the
proposed revision immediately.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers and first-year law repre-
sentative James Crutchfield, how-
ever, argued in favor of passing the
revision to the White Book Revisions
Committee, whose first meeting is
scheduled for March 4.

Caruthers said this was not a pres-
sing issue and asked why the revi-
sions committee was appointed if it
would not have the power to make re-
commendations on all issues.

Crutchfield’s motion to send the
proposal to the revisions committee
was approved 8-3.

The EC does not have to follow the
revisions committee’s recommenda-
tions, but any White Book revisions
the EC approves must be posted on
campus for a week and then approv-
ed again to become part of the White
Book.

given Pinney Prize

Seniors Glen O. Jackson and
Christopher Williams have been
named co-recipients of the annual
Edward L. Pinney Prize.

The prize is awarded by a vote of
the University Council, composed of
students, faculty and administrators.

Awarded for the first time in 1982,
the Pinney Prize was established by
the faculty in memory of the late Ed-
ward Lee Pinney, who was professor
of politics at W&L from 1963 until his
death in 1980. The Pinney Prize re-
cognizes extraordinary commitment
both to personal scholarship and to

Senior Chris Williams uses the
word ‘‘motivation”’ a lot.

He has good reason to. When you
talk Chris Williams, you're talking
motivation.

“It’s easy to put forth 100 percent
of your effort if you’re sincere,” he
said.

He added that his feeling of caring
for others is attributable to his family
and to his desire to relate to people.
He also said the success of a project
provides reinforcement and keeps
him going.

“‘W&L has allowed me to grow per-
sonally,’’ he said. ‘‘Friends have
helped me develop an understanding
of people and situations.”’

“Since I’ve been here, I’ve chang-
ed,’’ he recalled. ‘‘A lot of my friends
have influenced me and made me
whatIam.”

 

  

He said he hopes this attitude is
helpful to others. ‘‘People see that I
really care and that motivates
them,” he said.

Rockbridgeite can be found in the county in many shapes and sizes.

“‘W&L is small,” he said. ‘“‘As a
result, it enables a student to make
an indentation in the school within a

| four-year period.”’

He made a modest reference to

| characteristics such as persistence

and honesty that he has found helpful
in his work here. He added that his
desire for giving allows these quali-
ties to operate fully.

While good moral character is cer-
tainly a key to success in a group

todevote a lot of time.”

He said he gives his time out of love
for the school and a desire ‘‘td give

“These organizations may give
students a chance to work with peo-
ple, but you must have the initia-
tive,” he said. ‘Some students don’t,
and fail to realize the freedom ahd in-
dependence they have."’ =

Jackson said a freshman can ob-
tain “immediate employment’’ upon
arriving at W&L, and has the chance
to excel academically and personal-
ly. -

He added that because they’re at a
small college, freshmen can really
make a difference if they try, be-
cause the faculty and student: body

| Rockbridgeite: The

area’s own mineral

 

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

In addition to being the home of
Washington and Lee, Rockbridge
County has another claim to fame.

A unique mineral called Rock-
bridgeite, a phosphate of iron and
manganese, is found along the
flanks of the Blue Ridge Moun-
tains that run through the county.

Rockbridgeite is often found
with purer deposits of iron ore,
and according to geology Profes-
sor Edgar W. Spencer, Rock-
bridge was once the site of a min-
ing industry.

“There was quite an active min-
ing industry over in Buena Vista,
but they ran out of ore, and other
sources of ore opened up,’’ Spen-
cer said.

In the mid-1£00s seven furnaces
operated along the North River,

smelting iron mined from nearby
pits and mines. Rockbridge sup-
plied much of the iron for the Con-
federacy during the Civil War. By
the 1880s competition from more
accessible and purer deposits of
iron ore made the operation of the
mines unprofitable, and the in-
dustry collapsed. Buena Vista and
Goshen retained operating fur-
naces until the 1920s.

D. Allen Penick, a geologist who
works with the Virginia Division
of Natural Resources, says that
Rockbridgeite is a _ polished,
black-green mineral.

“Rockbridgeite can be cut into
beautiful stones and resembles
black jade,”’ Penick said. The
mineral can be used for jewelry,
but has not been marketed com-
mercially. Penick also noted that
the mineral is found in the states
of Arkansas, Alabama, Maryland
and New Hampshire.

fraternities’ ‘Little Sisters’ program

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A two-year moratorium on the
establishment of ‘‘Little Sisters”’ pro-
grams by Washington and Lee frater-
nities was recommended by the Co-
education Steering Committee on
Tuesday.

The committee’s recommendation
would prohibit the establishment of
“Little Sister’’ programs until
1987-1988. A set of guidelines for set-
ting up ‘‘Little Sisters’’ programs
was approved by the committee.

“Little Sisters’’ programs ‘‘consist
of groups of women formally assoc-
iated with a fraternity for social and
other activities without paying dues
or becoming official members,” the
committee’s recommendation states.

Lee Hollis, chairman of the frater-
nities subcommittee that prepared
the recommendation, said the two-
year moratorium was recommended
because the committee feared that
the women in the first two coed class-
es at W&L would establish a social
pattern based entirely on ‘‘Little Sis-
ters” programs that might restrict
the options of future women.

‘“‘We thought it would help the soc-
ial system evolve a little more natu-
rally,’’ Hollis said.

The committee’ recommendation

 

Coeducation:

83

What Will It Mean?

 

 

stated that the extensive develop-
ment of “‘Little Sisters’”’ programs in
the first two years of coeducation
would limit the development of other
organizations created by women and,
“‘at a time when class unity is impor-
tant, these programs might prove di-
visive.”’

Hollis emphasized that the com-
mittee’s proposal was neither a con-
demnation nor a recommendation of
the establishment of ‘‘Little Sisters”
programs after the end of the two-
year moratorium.

‘‘When properly organized, these
programs can provide a structure for
enhancing friendships between male
and female students and offer women
an opportunity to participate in the
fraternity system. They also could
generate good public relations for
fraternities as well as lead to good
fraternity/sorority relations,’ the

committee’s proposal states.

However, the committee ‘warns
that if the program is not properly
run it could place women in a “‘sec-
ond class status.”’ The term “Little
Sister’ itself implies second’ “¢lass
status, the committee notes. ~

Fraternities also might find that
the cost of a ‘Little Sisters’’ program
is high because dues cannot be col-
lected from the women in the pro-
gram to offset expenses. Z

Hollis said he hopes the Interfra-
ternity Council will adopt the’ com-
mittee’s guidelines for the ‘Little
Sisters’ program when setting tip the
program. :

The guidelines recommend. that
“Little Sisters” not be selected
through Rush procedures but
through a sponsor system or by ecom-
mittee or secret ballot.

According to the committee's re-
commendation, ‘‘Little Sisters’
would have none of the privileges or
responsibilities of membership in the
fraternity. They would have no vot-
ing rights, could not take part in the
selection of other ‘‘Little Sisters” and
would not pay any membership fees.

“Furthermore, ‘Little Sisters’ are
not to be used for mandatory house
work. They are not house members,
but invited guests,” the guidelines
state.

z Winning Tuesday night against
Eastern Mennonite by a score of
94-65, the Washington and Lee bas-
ketball team ended its five game los-
ing streak. The Generals are now
12-12 overall and 6-7 in the Old Domi-
. hion Athletic Conference.
“It’s nice to break the pressure,
* but we can play better,” said head
coach Verne Canfield, commenting
on the victory that snapped the Gen-
erals’ dry spell that lasted two and a
half weeks.
Canfield started the team’s five
seniors in their last regular season
, home court appearance. Seniors
Scott Shannon, Lex Fitzenhagen, Da-
* vid Wilkinson, Mike Hudson and Ke-
. vin McClatchy started the game for
the Generals and opened up an early
* lead.
._ With 9:00 remaining in the first
half, W&L led the Royals 24-11. Can-
field took advantage of the large lead
. togive several of his younger players
experience playing together. Sopho-
mores Jeff Harralson, Fred Bissin-
, Ber and Rob Spencer gained much
playing time with freshmen Harmon
’ Harden and Lou Trosch. Although
, Harralson and Harden are starters,
it was important for Canfield to play
* them with the younger players on the
second platoon. ‘“‘They are what we
are looking at for next year,’’ com-
« mented Canfield.
; Leading 37-24 at halftime, the Gen-
érals opened the second half with the
» momentum that they carried into the
, locker room. In a half in which al-
most everything went right for the
- Generals, nothing could go right for
_ the Royals. The referees slapped two
technical fouls on the Eastern Men-
- nonite bench, while the Royals lead-
ing scorer, Leonard Dow, fouled out
" of the game with 6:13 left. Coach Can-
. field cited Fitzenhagen and McCiat-
chy for their outstanding play that
" allowed the Generals to overwhelm
y their opponents in the second half.
Fitzenhagen led W&L with 24
* points.
Fitzenhagen also led the Generals
on Saturday night with 22 points in a

Last weekend the Washington and
“Lee swimming team raced in their
.last two dual-meets of the season. On
Friday they swam against Mary
‘Washington at Washington and Lee
- _ and won 36-25. The following morning
'* (Saturday) they traveled to Division
‘I William and Mary and finished in a
_tie with the Indians at 52 points. The
outcomes produced a 7-1-1 dual-meet
record for the season.
_ At the beginning of this season
Coach Page Remillard had two goals
=~ for his team. First, to have a winning
dual-meet record and, second, to
‘have a successful championship sea-
.son. The team has accomplished the
winning record and at the same time
“the best record since the 1977-78 10-1
' season when the Generals finished
10th in the nation under Coach Bill
-Stearns.

“I am pleased with our dual-meet
''“geason. Our 7-1-1 record came
‘ iagainst some good teams and I am

happy with the way our swimmers
responded throughout the year,”
Remillard said.
The team had been shooting for an
“g-1 record and thought they could ac-
complish it with a win at William and
“Mary but looking back they were
happy to finish in a tie. The Generals
fell behind William and Mary early
‘and were able tocatch up totie.

were doing poorly,” said Remillard.

Concerning the Roanoke game,
Canfield said, ‘‘We got within four
points four times, but we didn’t play
well enough towin.”

Roanoke’s victory over W&L help-
ed them secure their second-place

lege currently holds third place,
while W&L is in a close battle for
fourth place with Eastern Mennonite.

If the Generals want to host a quar-
terfinal game in the ODAC tourna-
ment on Feb. 19, they need to finish
fourth or higher in the conference
standings. Despite the complications
surrounding a possible tie for fourth
place between W&L and Eastern
Mennonite, Coach Canfield believes
that the Generals will host a quarter-
final game against Eastern Menno-

finals and final games will be held at
the Salem-Roanoke Civic Center in
Salem, Va. on Feb. 22and 23.

Concerning the Generals’ outlook
for the tournament, Canfield simply
states, “If we play our style, we
win.”

W&L completes its regular season
schedule tomorrow night when they
play conference leader Maryville in
Maryville, Tenn, The game’s tip-off
is slated for7:30p.m. :

Matmen close with Longwood win

nearfalls with 16; and Dixon, the
Generals’ only undefeated wrestler
at 9-0-1, 28-0-1 over the last two
seasons.

Franke said he only invites wrest-
lers who have winning records to go
to the Regionals. Three General
wrestlers have plus-.500 marks but
will not be making the trip. The
heavyweight Weaver, who is 13-5, is
injured, and Phillips and Mazza de-
cided not to compete, Franke said.

There will be 20 to 30 schools repre-
sented at the Regionals, which is in
an cxpanded format this year.
Franke said the tough squads should
be the host team Trenton State and
the team from Ithaca College in New
York.

Sophomore Frank Rembert takes off at the start of
the 100-yard backstroke in Friday’s swimming meet

There were many factors that play-
ed key roles in the William and Mary
tie. Most of all, the Generals only had
three days of practice last week.
They swam against Gettysburg on
Monday (Feb. 4), then Mary Wash-
ington on Friday and on Saturday
William and Mary. This was also the
first time this season the team had a
home meet ona Friday night and had
to travel the next morning for
another meet that day. And finally,
the Indians were fired up. William
and Mary even shaved their bodies
for the meet.

‘*We knew for four days they would
probably shave,’ Remillard said,
“but when we got there the guys just
said, ‘Gee, they really did it!’ ” It
added pressure and I think teams in
the past might not have been able to
takeit.”

“The effect of shaving was more on
themselves, not on us,’’ David Lewis
said. “It was the only thing they
could do to beat us, and it made us
want tobeat them even more.”

While the rest of the Washington
and Lee students are on vacation, the
swimming team will be participating
in the Tri-State Championships and
the Virginia Senior Invitationals. The
Tri-State Championships, are held in
Bryn Mawr, Pa., is a Division III
meet.

“‘Now we must concentrate on our
second goal. Next week will be at-
tempting to finish better than third in
the Tri-State Championships, some-
thing that no other Washington and
Lee team has been able to achieve in
any championship since I have been
here (1979),’’ Remillard said. ‘‘Our
other goal this week is to better our
qualifying times for the NCAA Cham-

against Mary Washington. W&L won the meet, 36-25, to
finish the season at 7-1-1.

pionships and qualify more swim-
mers.”

Only two members of the team
have qualififed for nationals. They
are Tim Stanford in the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle and Eric Sullivan in
the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle.
Everyone except Sullivan and Stan-
ford will shave their bodies for the
championships. Remillard explained
that shaving helps the swimmer slide
through the water. But most of all it
is a total commitment, a mental pro-
cess that makes a swimmer want to
do even better than before.

Coach Remillard predicted the
Generals will finish in the top three at
the Tri-State Championships, but
Lewis felt differently.

“T think we could win. No, as a
matter of fact, I think we will win; we
just need to beat Fairmont St. from
West Virginia.”

athletic teams here. Indeed, it is a
question I’ve pondered, lo, these
many months now.

Essentially, the beast we’re dealing with here is the General. With
all my inborn and societally-infused male chauvinism, I wondered if
there had been or could be such a species as the female General,
militarily speaking. Surely, this consternation is necessary, lest we of
the Colonnade fall prey, as other institutions have, to such sexually
confused nicknames as Lady Lions or She-Tigers.

But fear not — at least momentarily — Lt. Col. Mark R. Foutch,
deputy director for news media relations in the Pentagon (yeah, real-
ly, y know the big building that sort of looks like home plate), assured
me that there have been females in the U.S. Army who have reached
the rank of general. Foutch explained that in the past, most of those
earning the high ranking were of the nursing ilk(‘‘starting forward for
the Washington and Lee Nurses...’"?). But with increased oppor-
tunities open to women with the Vietnam War, there have been more
women generals. The most recent (Sept. ’84) figures look like this:

AIR FORCE — three current (one nursing related), six retired;

ARMY — three current (one nursing related), seven retired;

NAVY — three current (one nursing related), five retired;

MARINES-— one current, one retired.

So, problem solved, right? A General’s neuter. No sexually confused
nicknames here, right? Well, not quite so fast. The nickname game
still appears wide open from where I sit. I still hear the rumblings for
Lady Generals from the masses, but surely this tag is redundant as
Lady Commodores (Vanderbilt). I mean, we don’t refer to our men’s
teams as the Gentlemen Generals. Other nicknames I could shell out
to you include something leaning toward the military, like WACs. I'll
just toss out something like Generalettes, indeed, a bit too condescend-
ing to say nothing of the fact that it would be better suited to a dance
hall revue than a women’s lacrosse team. One other conceivable title
could be Marthas, but that’s just silly.

There will have to be some artistic renovations as well. A bearded
madman waving a sword might be nice for football and wrestling, but
women’s tennis? Also, Foutch informs me that women generals have
only earned the rank of two-star general because they cannot
(Congress has yet to see fit to give them that opportunity) see combat
duty. Thus, the five-star ring that is currently a part of the W&L logo
would be— at least temporarily — inaccurate.

Just some thoughts for those who decide such things. SID Mark
Mandel says a decision has yet to be reached, so I thought I’d do my
part to inform everyone of the pertinent problems this all-too-touchy

  

...Now for some serious Colonnade notes: Swimmers and wrestlers
deserve all the praise in the world — just super seasons, as the
Twombly team finishes with a dual meet record at 7-1-1 and grapplers
go 12-2-1. More success is deservedly on the way...Special good luck
wish for wrestlers Steve Castle, Brian Lifsted, Larry Anker, Joe
O'Neill and Jeff Dixon as they head to Eastern Regionals this
weekend...Let’s hope hoopsters are rejuvenated after a fine perfor-
mance Tuesday night. I still say the tournament is up for grabs. They
need to learn to win on the road and fast...

...Headline on McPaper Tuesday says, ‘“‘Valvano undecided on
Washburn,”’ and I’m going to be unforgiving on this one. Any clown
who reportedly —we’ll say ‘‘reportedly’’to be nice —Scores 470 on his
SAT’s doesn’t deserve a desk in a high school classroom, let alone a
college classroom...Georgetown, now that they have lost their two in
the conference, is looking very formidable and getting better every
day. You’re not out of line if you call this bunch a Final Four team....

....Finally, talk about the decline of man, first W&L goes coed, now
the Harlem Globetrotters. Or is it Globetrotteresses?

Four Tops to open
‘datey’ FD event;
Count Basie at ball

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
‘The Back Page” Editor

The Four Tops and The Count
Basie Orchestra will be the featured
acts at this year’s Fancy Dress Ball,
according to Student Activities
Board Entertainment Director John
Haywood.

The Four Tops will be the main
attraction at the Thursday night con-
cert in the student activities pavilion.
Wild Kingdom will be the opening
act.

Haywood said the SAB is very hap-
py with having the Four Tops as the
main act on Thursday. ‘‘It will be
very similar to Homecoming,” he
said. Fellow Motown greats — The
Spinners appeared at the first pavi-
lion concert held earlier this year.

Haywood said this is the type of act
that will go over well at a ‘‘datey”’
event like Fancy Dress. He added
that the Four Tops are a world-re-
nowned act and have played in such
places as the Kennedy Center and
Carnegie Hall.

This year’s Thursday night concert
marks a shift in emphasis from hav-
ing a big-name act at the Fancy
Dress Ball and having regional acts
perform on Thursday. Haywood said
this is more like the traditional
character of Fancy Dress, where it is
not so much a concert event and
more of an atmosphere in which peo-
ple can wander about Warner Center
to see different types of entertain-
ment.

Playing in the Warner Center Fri-
day night will be The Count Basie Or-

chestra. Even without the late Count
Basie, Haywood said the orchestra
still is drawing rave reviews from
The New York Times.

The other two bands, each alternat-
ing steps in Doremus Gym, will be A-
Train and Otis Day and the Knights.
A-Train is what Haywood describes
as an “up-and-coming rhythm and
blues band’’ from Shreveport, La.
They will play a variety of music,
ranging from R&B to contemporary
soul androck.

Otis Day and the Knights are pro-
bably best-remembered for their role
in National Lampoon’s ‘Animal
House,’’ Haywood said. They will
play a range of Motown and soul
music from the 50s and 60s.

Haywood said that from an enter-
tainment standpoint, this year’s Fan-
cy Dress will be unmatched. He said
the SAB has tried to get a variety of
music for the weekend and feels that
there will be something for everyone
toenjoy.

Haywood added that the SAB has
also learned a great deal about de-
corating Warner Center in the four
years it has been holding the ball in
the area. He said this year’s decora-
tions and visual effects will really
show that. ‘‘This year we will be rais-
ing Fancy Dress to a new level,”
Haywood said.

Tickets for this year’s ball will be
$30 a couple and will go on sale along
with other Fancy Dress memorabilia
on March 4 in Room 109 of the Univ-
ersity Center.

The Ring-tum Phi will publish its
annual Fancy Dress supplement
Thursday, Feb. 28.

‘Poets in South’ features
English professor’s poetry

Dabney Stuart, professor of Eng-
lish, is the featured writer in the cur-
rent issue of ‘“‘Poets in the South,”
published by the University of South
Florida.

The issue begins with an autobio-
graphical sketch in which Stuart re-
calls some early memories of Rich-
mond, where he was born, and in-
cludes selections from each of his
major volumes of poetry.

The portion of the issue devoted to
Stuart concludes with a critical essay
of his work by Barbara Fialkowski, a

poet and director of the creative writ-
ing program at Bowling Green State
University.

Fialkowski compares Stuart to
Wallace Stevens in requiring of the
reader a ‘‘disciplined listening’ and
in seeing ‘‘the creative work as rea-
son for celebration.’’ But she finds in
Stuart’s poetry a warmer tone, a
more conversational voice and a
greater willingness to embrace all of
human experience.

Stuart holds degrees from David-
son and Harvard.

Wednesday night in the Cockpit
is alive and well and attracting
students to capacity levels despite
scheduling changes and competi-
tion from fraternity parties, ac-
cording to officials of the Student
Activities Board.

“Things are just as good, if not
better than it’s ever been in the
Pit,” said SAB Executive Direc-
tor Mike Guerriero. The Cockpit
was suffering at the beginning of
the year due in some part to a
University order to change the
band night from Tuesday night to
Wednesday night.

Guerriero said that the first
three or so weeks this year went
very slowly while people got used
to the change in nights. SAB
Treasurer George Kinkead calls it
a ‘night and day” difference now.

‘“‘Last year we lost $9,000 on
Tuesdays in the Pit,’’ Kinkead
said. ‘“‘Last term we lost $900, and
so far this term we are $100 up.”

According to SAB Entertain-
ment Director John Haywood, the
SAB tries to book a variety of
bands in the Cockpit. ‘‘We try to
provide a combination of musical
tastes and we try to bring in new
groups to the area as well as old
favorites,”’ he said.

The key element to the Pit’s suc-
cess, Haywood added, is the fact
that women from the surrounding
women’s colleges can drive to
W&L every Wednesday night and
know that there will be some type
of social function going on.

“It’s not so important who the
band is as it’s important that
there is a band here,”’ he said.

 

 

Pit Wednesdays alive, well

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Dads lead guitarist David Ayers and keyboardist Kevin Pittman entertain
a packed Cockpit last night. Spectators said the Dads are one of the most

popular bands to appear in the Pit.

Although it may not be the par-
ticular band that brings women
down the road, it does make a dif-
ference as to whether people stay
in the Cockpit or leave for frater-
nity parties.

Hollins College freshman Kris
Wilbur said she comes up almost
every Wednesday even if she
doesn’t know which band is play-
ing in the Cockpit. If the band isn’t

very good, she said, then she
leaves to check out the fraternity
parties. But when a band is a good
one, she said she usually sticks
around.

Kim Soos, also a Hollins College
freshman, said she thinks the
Cockpit is a nice place to start out
the evening. ‘‘Nothing else really
goes on here before 11 o’clock or
so, so this is a nice place to go,”’
she said.

While some people view the Pit
as a prelude to fraternity parties,
others see it as an alternative to
them.

W&L sophomore Rob Merritt
said that the Cockpit provides a
better mixture of people from all
over the University and added
that he thinks the Cockpit is an ex-
cellent place for people to get
together and relax from midweek
pressures

Sweet Briar College senior
Maura Horodyski said she prefers
the Cockpit to fraternity parties.
“There is a greater variety of peo-
ple here,”’ she said. ‘‘It’s harder to
get to know people at a fraternity
party where everybody already
knows everybody.”’

Anne Munroe, a freshman from
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege, disagreed with that position.
“T would rather go to a fraternity
party where I know the kind of
people that are going to be there,”
she said.

Hollins College sophomore Sta-
cey Powell tends to see the middle
ground of this area. ‘‘The Cockpit
is great for getting all the frater-
nities as well as the independents
together in one place. It elimi-
nates having to go fraternity hop-
ping,” she said.

Most people said they are happy
with the job the SAB is doing with
the Wednesday night program.
Several complaints were made
about the overcrowding problem,
and a few disgruntled under-age
students said they wished they
could drink beer in the Pit, but for
the most part Wednesday Night in
the Cockpit continues to be one of
W&L’s strongest social traditions.

 

 

‘Real world’ negates Nabobs’ nattering

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Just after the Christmas holidays,
a Washington and Lee Law School in-
stittition was shattered. Following
some heady deliberations and attor-
ney-client discussions, the Nattering
Nabobs of Negativism decided to
break up. The band, formed in Octo-
ber 1983, was made up of five law stu-
dents and one undergraduate,

The rhythm guitarist and lead vo-
calist for the band, Jake Washburne,
said that the decision was based
mainly on the realization that, come
springtime and graduation, it would
be time for graduating law students
to seek some sort of gainful employ-
ment in the “real world.’’ Most law
students, Washburne said, take care
of their job-hunting in the fall. This
fall, however, he was busy with the
band.

“It was so much fun,’’ Washburne
continued, ‘‘that it made it easier to
not think about the future.”’

Toward the end of the fall term he
did begin to think about the future
and raised the point with his fellow
band members and briefed them on
his position. He said that the band
decided to wait until after the holi-
days to make any firm plans.

he is a Marylander like Agnew and
has been an admirer of the ex-VP
since he had a sticker on his bicycle
as a young lad, he picked the name
and it stuck.

The Nabobs played gigs mostly in
Lexington during their 14-month
show business career. The W&L
Cockpit and fraternity parties were

the best places to catch their act:

Mardi Gras: ‘Like a W

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

NEW ORLEANS — Debauchery knows
no limits during the blowout that is Mardi
Gras, and more than 100 Washington and
Lee students drove, flew and rode here to
partake of the depravity during last week’s
Washington Holiday.

Mardi Gras is technically the highlight of
a six-week season known as Carnival.

Freshman Brandt Wood, a New Orleans
native and Executive Committee represen-
tative, provides a somewhat more relevant
description. ‘‘It’s a raucous, bawdy display
of bacchanalian revelry that is sometimes
crude, sometimes extravagant, but always
exciting,” hesaid.

Carnival allows the entire city to break
the restraints of everyday life and do
something outrageous. For example, a
uniformed policeman came up during a
parade and asked a student for a beer.

The women in the French Quarter yank up

The migrating minks made their way to

the Wednesday before break.

Most W&L students made it to the city
after the animal skin floggings but in time
for the biggest and most extravagant of the
parades — Endymion, Bacchus, Rex and
Commus.

Senior Scott Tilley remembers arriving
at the Audoban Tavern II in uptown New
Orleans, a popular hangout most people
know simply as ‘‘AT2’s.”’

“It was like going into a W&L fraternity
party,”’ Tilley said. ‘‘It was small and jam-
packed — it was shoulder-to-shoulder and
you couldn’t move,’’ he said, adding that
there were ‘‘a ton” of people he recognized
from W&L inthe bar.

1985
&L fraternity party’

W&L students have long showed an in-
terest in Mardi Gras. In fact, it was the
Fancy Dress theme in 1954, 1964 and 1974.

Carnival is officially kicked off Jan. 6
with the ball of the Twelfth Night, which
also marks King’s Day in New Orleans
— the Feast of Epiphany commemorating
Christ’s manifestation to the Gentiles.

The party W&L students headed for in
droves last week has a very old history. The
first New Orleans Carnival began about
1857, but its foundations go back more than
5,000 years to celebrations of the Greeks.
According to New Orleans historian Gasper
“Buddy”’ Stall, the Greeks celebrated the
end of the fierce winter by sacrificing
animals and partying naked in the fields
and being flogged with a whip, made from
the skins of animals, to cleanse them of sin.

Carnival has moved far beyond the hand-
ful of gentlemen that gathered in a room on
Royal Street in 1857 to form the Comus
Organization. Today, there are several
parades with more than 1,000 members and
parade budget of close to $2 million.

Education in the news: the Hill reacts

Elrod: W&L program
meets tough standards

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The ‘‘crisis in American educa-
tion’’ outlined in a recent nationally
publicized report has not been ex-
perienced as severely at Washington
and Lee as it has at other colleges,
according to Dean of the College
John W. Elrod.

The report by the Association of
American Colleges stated that the
liberalization of undergraduate
education in the 1960s has resulted in
a serious devaluation of the bach-
elor’s degree.

Competition for students has led to
a marketplace philosophy in the
undergraduate curriculum, said the
report, presented at the association’s
Feb, 9-13 meeting in Washington,
D.C., which Elrod attended.

“It is a supermarket where
students are shoppers and professors
are merchants of learning. Fads and
fashions, the demands of popularity

and success, enter where wisdom
and experience should prevail,’’ the
report stated.

As enrollment increased in the
1960s, a structured curriculum gave
way to a curriculum chosen by the
students, resulting ina disjointed,
meaningless, undergraduate educa:
tion, according to the report.

“T don’t think we need to panic,”
said Elrod, who came to W&L in
August from Iowa State University.

This was the third recent report by
a major educational organization to
criticize American undergraduate
education.

‘They all have incommon the view
that the liberalization of require-
ments for graduation in the ’60s and
early ‘70s have had unfortunate con-
sequences,’ Elrod said. Students
across the country are graduating
without basic knowledge in several
areas, he added.

were ever as severe as they were at
most places, and I think we have a

Three things Elrod said would im-

an examination of the strength and
coherence of all academic majors
and a yearly assessment of the
General Education Requirements in-
stituted this year.

Elrod said he would not favor a
radical change in the curriculum in

Aid cuts

could damage W&L

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

President Reagan’s proposed cuts
in federal aid to college students are
misdirected and might cause a
‘mass exodus’? of students from
private to state-supported colleges,
according to Financial Aid Director
John H. DeCourcy.

The cuts would involve placing a
limit of $4,000 on the amount of
federal aid — grants, loans and work
study payments — a student could
receive each year, and would make
families with an adjusted gross in-
come of more than $25,000 ineligible
for all aid except subsidized loans,
which would be harder to obtain.

About 40 percent of W&L’s 350
undergraduates receiving aid
already are over the proposed $4,000
limit, DeCourcy said. In addi-
tion, a number of students receiving
aid would be limited to the subsidized
loans.

Guaranteed position for female on

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A resolution calling on the Ex-
ecutive Committee to appoint a
freshman woman as an ad hoc, non-
voting member of the Student Con-
trol Committee next year if no
women are elected to the position has
been approved by the Coeducation
Steering Committee.

At present, a member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee serves as an ad
hoc member of Student Control
because of the possibility that a mat-
ter before Student Control might in-
volve an honor violation.

“Such a representative should be
appointed in each year in which no
woman is elected to class office. In
other words, we recommend that the
Student Control Committee always
have at least one female represen-
tative,’’ the resolution states.

The committee cited both the need
for women to perceive the system as

being fair and the need to ensure that
the system actually is fair as reasons
for appointing an ad hoc woman
member to Student Control if none is
elected.

“Most simply, we fear that women
confronting as all-male board will not
feel themselves to be confronting
peers....Certainly, visible signs of
fairness are important,” the resolu-
tion states.

The resolution adds that in the ac-
tual administration of the
disciplinary system, Student Control
decides each case on its own merits.
Student Contre] must consider the in-
tention of the person being tried and
whether the person’s actions were
serious offenses or merely examples
of “‘boys-will-be-boys”’ or ‘‘girls-will-
be-girls’’ behavior, the resolution
adds.

“But we cannot dispute the fact
that boys know when ‘boys will be
boys’ more thoroughly than girls do
— and that we cannot assume that
male Student Control members will

know instinctively when ‘girls will be
girls’ applies....Therefore, we feel
that not simply the perception of
fairness, but fairness itself, depends
upon female representation,” the
resolution states.

The resolution also notes that men
and women might have different per-
ceptions of the seriousness of sexual
harassment and verbal assaults
against women.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson, who chairs the
Coeducation Steering Committee,
said that an all-male Student Control
Committee might have a hard time
understanding how angry women
feel when they are subject to sexual
harassment or verbal abuse. A wo-
man might be better able to under-
stand the seriousness of sexual ha-
rassment, Simpson said.

Student Control members have
said they will handle cases of sexual
harassment, Simpson said. In the
past, there have been some cases in
which Law School women have been

Congress probably will not approve
the cuts as they have been proposed,
he added.

“They'll never get this thing
through, but it’s going to be a tough
fight,’ DeCourcy said. ‘‘It’s not go-
ing to be easy. People ought to write
their congressman.”

Compared with Washington and
Lee's tuition and expenses of about
$11,000 for next year, the lower tui-
tion of state-supported schools such
as the University of Virginia and
community colleges will attract the
students who can’t afford private
schools, DeCourcy said.

A reduced number of students who
can pay for W&L could make the
school ‘‘a very mediocre institution,”
he added.

At the same time, he says, com-
munity colleges would thrive. That,
though, is where the greatest amount
of waste takes place, according to
DeCourcy, who was financial aid

SCC urged

harassed but were unaware that Stu-
dent Control would handle such
cases, she said. If some students are
tried for sexual harassment it could
reduce the incidence of harassment
in the future, Simpson said.

Simpson emphasized that if the EC
accepts the committee’s recommen-
dation, a woman would be appointed
as a non-voting member of Student
Control only in the event that no
woman was elected freshmen class
president or vice president. Although
other colleges in similar situations
found that it was several years
before a woman was elected to a
class office. Simpson said it is not in-
conceivable that a freshman woman
would be elected to class office.

“Unfortunately, the minority posi-
tion of women, their newness in the
community, and whatever sexism is
present on campus, all make it
unlikely that women will immediate-
ly or certainly be elected to class of-
fice,’ the committee’s resolution
states.

1984 graduate Carlton Peebles killed in airplane crash

 

From Staff Reports

 

A former Washington and Lee stu-
dent and his brother were killed last
week when the airplane they were
flying crashed in Southwest Virginia

J. Carlton Peebles, who graduated
from W&L last spring, and his
brother, Christopher Peebles, 18, of
Buena Vista, were the only occupants
of the single-engine Cessna 182

Carlton Peebles, 23, was flying
Christopher to the Webb School in
Tennessee when the crash occurred
He’d had his pilot’s license for about
five years, his father said.

The plane took off from Manassas,
in Northern Virginia, at 6:45 a.m
Feb. 19 for Shelbyville, Tenn., accor
ding to Lt. Col. Ethel Hazelrigg of
the West Virginia Civil Air Patrol,
which coordinated the search for the
plane

That after ar

search began

emergency locator transmitter
signal was picked up about 9:20 a.m.
Tuesday. The battery-powered sig-
nal, which serves as a direction
finder, is automatically transmitted
when a plane is involved in a crash.

Because of bad weather, the Civil
Air Patrol was only able to search on
the ground the first day

The plane’s wreckage first was
spotted from the air about 1 p.m. the
next day, and ground crews reached
the site several hours later. About
40 Civil Air Patrol members and
three aircraft participated in the
search, according to Hazelrigg.

The plane was found about 3,900
feet up the side of Beartown Moun-
tain, a 4,700-foot peak near Burkes

Garden on the Tazewell County-
Bland County border, according to
Walter Stiner, an air safety in-
vestigator for the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board

Stine who has visited the crash

site, said the terrain is mountainous,
but he added, ‘I don’t think it’s any
more difficult than any other place
given the proper ways of traversing
the thing.”

Stiner, based in Atlanta, said he
will be making a report to the Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board
in Washington, D.C., within three
months, and the board will determine
the possible cause of the crash.

Carlton Peebles, a business ad-
ministration major who received a
bachelor of science degree in com-
merce last year, waS a manager
trainee at a W.S. Peebles Co. Inc.
department store in Manassas, ac-
cording to his father, C. Palmer
Peebles of Lexington. The younger
Peebles had been working in
Manassas since graduation.

W.S. Peebles is a family-owned
regional chain of about 40 depart-
ment stores, including one in Buena
Vista. Palmer Peebles is a member

of the board of directors.

While at W&L, Carlton Peebles was
a wrestling letterman for four years
and a tri-captain his senior year. He
wrestled in the heavyweight division.

He also was a Dean’s List student,
a football player and a member of
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

Peebles’ strength was his leader-
ship, said wrestling coach Gary
Franke, adding, ‘‘He was just a fine
person that had a great love for life
and enjoyed being around people and
people enjoyed being around him.”

During Monday’s Executive Com-
mittee. meeting, President Cole
Dawson asked for a moment of
silence in memory of Carlton. “I
think we should express our sym-
pathy to his family and friends.”
Dawson said.

A funeral for the brothers was held
Sunday at R.E. Lee Episcopal
Church. They were buried in
Stonewall Jackson cemetery.

OPINION

 

EC:
No comment

About this time of year, The Ring-tum Phi usually runs a
midterm analysis of the members of the Executive Commit-
tee, reviewing the feats and antics of the first term and
generally commenting upon its performance. Many students
in the past have enjoyed this adjudication of their peers and
leaders. For some EC members, the midterm review has
—justifiably or not — hurt their re-election chances. For the

~ deserving leaders, the review and public praise were long

overdue.
When the winter term started and students began to look
for the midterm reports, we gathered our thoughts about the

- EC and midterm reports.

The conclusion? For the first time in years, a review of the

- EC is not worth the time and effort. Why? Simply, this year’s

~ committee lacks direction and initiative.

A central feature of past Executive Committees seems to

be lacking in this year’s body: initiative. Few substantive

issues have been undertaken by our leaders this year without
outside prodding. Perhaps this is due to the shadow of change
looming over the University this year as we await coeduca-
tion. Perhaps the zeal we saw in last year’s committee came
from the anxiety surrounding the coeducation debate. Re-

- gardless of the source, initiative simply is not present in this

’ year’s group, and its absence is both noticeable and unfor-

tunate.

Consider, for example, the typical Monday night meeting.
There is joking and laughter and more joking and occasional-
ly some serious discussion. Monday’s meeting, for example,
included a 15-minute discussion of what constitutes two-

' thirds of 13. This is not to suggest that governing must be a

somber chore carried out with great diligence and a furrow-
ed brow. On the contrary, there is indeed room for humor and
laughter; however, they should not eclipse the real charge
the EC holds, namely that of sound, serious and substantive
governing.

Issues the EC has touched on, but failed to tackle with the

_ proper follow-ups include:

eThe transition to coeducation. President Cole Dawson said

at the beginning of the year that he wanted the EC’s main

goal to be to ease that transition. Little, if any, substantive
action has been taken in that direction.

*A New York Times article that mentioned honor systems
but failed to include W&L’s. At the Nov. 12 meeting, Dawson
handed out copies of the article and asked members to read it
in preparation for a discussion at the next meeting. The issue
was never raised again.

eThe increase in the drinking age to 21. This will have a
profound effect on W&L social life, particularly with our new,
$600,000 pavilion. The EC, though, did nothing in the way of
expressing its opinion on the issue, even though other student
governments in the state were actively lobbying against it.

These issues range from the trivial to the truly substantive.
Yet they are indicative of an EC that consistantly has failed
to follow through on its discussions and actions.

Not every EC member has failed to measure up. Some
have taken their duty seriously and have represented their
classes well. Unfortunately, they have not had much com-

' pany.

Looking back over the first half of the year, it is difficult to
remember any outstanding feat accomplished by the EC.
Granted, after a slow start, strict control has been maintain-
ed over the funds allotted to student organizations, and the

. EC budget, with any luck, should run in the black.

Because we are not in a position to judge the EC’s enforce-
ment of the Honor System, we can only hope that EC
members have been more punctual and have a better atten-
dance record at closed hearings than at the regular Monday
meetings. One would also hope the level of questioning,

. discussion and decorum is somewhat higher.

We do know that the sacred principle of confidentiality in

’ honor cases has gone out the window. Want to know what

cases have come up lately? Just stick around the C-School
library — you’re bound to pick up some juicy tidbits.

These comments are not personal — they merely reflect
the disillusioning reality of EC performance. It’s painful to
come to grips with the fact that great guys and good friends
have fallen short as leaders, but that’s exactly what has hap-
pened. There’s even the gnawing feeling of betrayal — we us-
ed to be very high on these people, and now find their actions
impossible to defend.

Time still remains for the EC to reconsider its charge and
responsibility. In doing so, perhaps it might realize that it is
not too late to redeem itself. We are not asking for another
“tie issue’’ or a bumbled open hearing, nor are we asking for
action merely for its own sake. Rather, we search for a group
that will discharge its duties in a more serious and substan-
tive manner.

Lighten up: dogs just wanna have fun

MY VIEW

By Bob Kelly

 

“Dogs on campus are becomg a
problem,” stated E. Stewart Epley,
University treasurer, in a memoran-
dum that sent shock waves through
the tightly knit community of dog
owners at Washington and Lee.
Though not a dog owner myself, I
have long noted and valued the
charming presence of W&L’s dog
population on our campus.

It was with considerable indigna-
tion, then, that I read of the Universi-
ty’s plans to “invite the dog warden
onto the campus to impound dogs.”’
Still reeling from its inhumane
undertones, and perhaps more than a
little unsteadied emotionally, I
associated Mr. Epley’s ultimatum
with a larger and more sinister plot
on the part of the University ad-
ministration: First bring in women,
then effectively eradicate the
presence of man’s best friend; begin
systematically introducing things
such as lo-cal cottage cheese and
celery sticks in the dining hall,

dancercise and synchronized swim-
ming in the athletic curriculum...

The implications were indeed stag-
gering and appalling. But after fur-
ther consideration, I came to the
realization that only through a clear
and rational approach to this
“problem” can we begin to deal
responsibly with the questions Mr.
Epley has raised. Here then is my
own analysis of the situation and a
few suggestions. First, let us con-
sider The Problem as presented by
Mr. Epley:

1. A campus mailman was
‘‘jumped.” As hard as I find this to
believe, given the gentlemanly
nature of W&L’s dog population, I
nevertheless think it of little
relevance to our discussion anyway.
Mail carriers thrive on this kind of
abuse. Only when it is raining, snow-
ing, sleeting, or when outside
elements are in some other way con-
spiring against them does their job
take on any kind of adventure or
significance. Besides, with the price
of mailing a letter these days, they’re
lucky they don’t get ‘‘jumped”’ by
more citizens.

2. Damage to campus grounds. So
there are a few holes in the lawn. Soa
few plants have been inadvertantly
pruned. Need I remind anyone of the
considerable quantities of cost-free
fertilizer provided every day by

these dogs in question? Need I re-
mind anyone of the precious link this
service provides in the larger
ecosystem of our University?
Remove this vital link, and we could
be pushing the delicate environmen-
tal stability of W&L over an eco-
logical precipice. House pets of one
sort or another have been littering
W&L’s lawns for generations. Need I
remind anyone of the hallowed
regard every W&L man holds for
Traveller? How do you think it would
have reflected on the University had
Traveller been ‘‘disposed of” after
five days in an SPCA holding shelter?

3. Disruption of classes. Mr. Epley
seems to have a point here. Just the
other day, I was on the third floor of
Payne Hall when a Labrador re-
triever pole-vaulted through an open
window and began shouting obsceni-
ties. But this incident, and others like
it, clearly demonstrate that these
dogs are crying out for our help. They
want to learn. And it is our obliga-
tion, nay, our duty, to teach them.

What Is To Be Done:

Open all classes to dogs. Known
around the country as the last great
institution of higher learning to open
its doors to women, W&L could sig-
nificantly repair its reputation by
becoming the first to educate dogs.
Dogs have a distinct and valuable
position in our society, and their con-

Apathy, stupidity spell death

To the Editors:

The W&L student body has been
plagued by apathy for some time.
Apathy is so commonplace that men-
tioning it again will probably have lit-
tle effect. Now though, our apathy
has caused us to take on a new
characteristic — STUPIDITY. I say
stupidity because we apparently
don’t have the time to care about or
worry over our future.

We are specifically speaking to
fraternity members. We are both ap-
palled and astounded by the number
of fraternity members who are un-
aware and haven't read the ad hoc
committee report on fraternity af-
fairs, a paper detailing ‘‘sugges-
tions’’ concerning the internal affairs
and social life of fraternities.

If these suggestions are enacted,
this report will control the future
vitality and life of W&L fraternities.
The key word here is “‘life.’”” We may
return to W&L in 10 years for a reun-
ion and the most striking change will
be the names of buildings. One may
find Red Quad, Beta Dorm, etc. We
do not mean to single out Red Square,
as all fraternities are going to be af-
fected. Face it, the number of males
at W&L is going to decrease so are
the numbers of fraternities. This
report only accelerates the in-
evitability of the latter.

We will not discuss the merits of
each item of the report here. Let it
simply be known that we are appal-
led. We would encourage all fraterni-
ty members who are interested in
their houses or their social lives to
read the report. We are sure you will
find it as amusing, yet at the same

 

Every time I attempt to ar-
ticulate ‘‘what’’ is special about
Washington and Lee, I fall short,
always deciding that it has a lot to
do with the bond between W&L
people and that it can only be
known — ultimately — through
experience. I had such an ex-
perience recently while with four
other students at a Student Alum-
ni Conference in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Aside from being involved in
‘“Kathekon,”’ and from a couple of
friendships, there was nothing
specifically in common within the
group, each person was from a

 

time alarming, as we did. Once you
have formulated your opinion, come
to the IFC meetings and voice them.
Apathy on this issue is worse than
stupidity.

There are a few ramifications of
the report that we would like to
discuss. The first that arises in the in-
troduction to the report. It basically
states that the purpose of W&L is
scholastic performance and all exter-
nal detriments to this should be held
to a minimum. Granted, academics
are important, but they are not the
sole purpose of W&L. The objective
of this school is to graduate well-
rounded individuals who will be suc-
cessful. This success comes not only
from the classroom, but also through
such things as social interaction and
time management. One must learn to
balance the academic vigor of W&L
with its social demands. This can’t be
regulated. It must be learned.

We came to W&L and were con-
sidered adults and were treated ac-
cordingly. A couple of years later, we
have been reduced to ‘‘quasi-adults”
by this report. It seeks to tell us
when, where, how and with whom we
can socialize. Further, it seeks to
regulate the internal organization
and workings of our fraternities. Ar-
riving at W&L, we were told that the
dictates upon our lives were simply
that we not lie, cheat or steal and that
we conduct ourselves in a manner
befitting a gentleman. We are now
being regulated as if we were
children. The White Book states that
when Lee became President he
“stopped faculty visitation of dorms
and all other clandestine supervision

different part of the country, from
a different fraternity and in a dif-
ferent extra-curricular circle.
But, it was evident in the midst of
so many other students front other
schools, this was more than the
natural one of just having come
from the same.school, and more
than any evident tie within the
other groups. This feeling would
be especially strong when we
would find ourselves trying to ex-
plain, with our various perspec-
tives, what W&L was about —
what ‘“‘we’’ were about, to some-
one from Mississippi State or the
University of Georgia. This tie
among us must have been evident
because we were asked about
W&L all weekend, and it was a
good feeling to answer with some-
one from a completely different
circle.

of student conduct.’’ In its place, Lee
established the positive-though un-
printed rule that every student was to
accept responsibility for his conduct.
Should fraternities be any different?
Again we encourage all fraternity
members to read this report. You
should be able to get a copy from
your IFC represe:itative or fraternity
president. (Hopefully, they have
read the report). Don’t assume that
you have been represented on this
committee. As Jim Cobb said during
a recent IFC meeting, the ad hoc
committee discussed the issues for a
semester and then one person wrote
the report. After reading the report,

tribution in the classroom would be
considerable. Many alumni have ex-
pressed regret that they missed out
on fostering close relationships with
dogs while at W&L. Some of us might
even be working for dogs when we
graduate. Dogs on campus and in the
classroom will provide a broad-based
educational experience in keeping
with the liberal-arts ideals our
University holds dear.

Yet before we can begin reaping
the benefits of this plan, we must all
work together to overcome obstacles
impeding its implementation.

What You Can Do:

1. Overpay your tuition by $1 a
term. The treasurer and his staff will
be so busy trying to credit 1,300
undergraduate accounts that he
won’t have time to press his suit on
the dog issue. By the time he catches
up, it will be too late. Our newly
educated canine friends will be able
to defend themselves.

2. Bark at the mailman. He'll think
he’s hearing things. The next time a
dog jumps him, he’ll be too flustered
to notice.

We are not totally against this

within it. (The bad ones will make it

that fraternities have problems.
These problems should be dealt with

Where’s the meaning?

To the Editors:

We would like to comment on Mr.
Tilley’s editorial (sermon?) in the
last issue of The Phi. For a man who
is ‘‘anything but religious’ he seems
to have rather definite religious
beliefs.

Mr. Tilley stated that if we ‘‘make
Christ’s life our life, then we no
longer need to worry about our life
here and the problems we encoun-
ter.”’ We feel that this attitude mere-
ly rationalizes a person’s inadequate
style of living and does not follow the
teachings of Christ. In addition, this
viewpoint provides a vehicle for
hiding from the real problems of liv-
ing by focusing on the “‘infinite’’ in-
stead of the problems that confront
us today.

Mr. Tilley has either misinter-
preted or misstated the teachings of

Knowing the tie that binds

i crnaps the best articulation of
this “feeling” came toward the
end of the weekend during a
discussion about the recent
suicide. One of the group said that
he had noticed everyone voicing
regret but always followed by
‘‘but I didn’t know him...’’ He said
that we did know him, that we
knew him in the same way we
know each other and everyone
else back in Lexington. We all
chose the same little University
— out of all the other universities
in the world, and once here, we
came, in our own corners, to ex-
perience that special bond. This is
why a student from North Caro-
lina and a student from California
can find themselves, outside of

Lexington, explaining ‘‘their’’
place. This is also why we all

Christ. If anything, Christ wanted us
to pay more attention to the problems
that face man rather than looking
past them toward the “‘infinite.”’

If life, as Mr. Tilley claims, does
not come from ‘‘success, wealth or
Buddha” but from following Christ
then many Buddhists, not to mention

Jews, Moslems and others whodonot ,

believe in Christ, are in for a great
shock. They are condemned to a life
without true meaning, according to
Mr. Tilley.

We suggest that Mr. Tilley should
seriously reflect on his views and
become more in touch with reality.

4 women

named

dorm counselors

From Staff Reports

 

Four women have been named as
freshman dormitory counselors for
next year.

The four were among 23 students
chosen as counselors for 1985-86, the
first year Washington and Lee will
have women in its undergraduate
programs.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert Hunt-
ley said two additional female dorm
counselors likely will be needed.

“We're hoping more will apply,”
he said. “Having men as women’s
counselors or women as men’s
counselors is something we want to
avoid.”

He said that one possibility if there
were a shortage of women counselors
would be for each of the four to serve
as counselor to a larger than usual
number of students.

The women counselors are Kath-
leen Plante, a junior who attended
classes here as an exchange student
from Hollins College last winter and
this fall; second-year law student
Janna Johnson; and first-year law
students Terri Amernick and Dan-
drea Miller.

Junior Ted LeClercq was named to

the new position of director of dor-
mitory activities.

“Our activities will go beyond just
social things,’’ said LeClercq, who
this year founded Delta Graham
Lees.

He said that among his plans are
decorating the dormitories, adding
ice machines to the dorms, broaden-
ing the freshman intramural pro-
gram and having the freshmen spon-
sor events.

The dorm activities director will
have the same privileges as an assis-
tant head dorm counselor.

Junior Tom Mack was appointed
head dorm counselor. Assistant
heads are juniors Christopher
Bleggi, Dan DuPre, David Lewis and
John Lewis.

Returning as counselors are
juniors Pat Ferguson, Pete Ierardi,
Tim Janyska, Chris Komosa, Ken
Lindeman and Corky Mauzy.

Joining them are sophomores
Gregory Barrow, Mathew Laws, Jef-
frey Mandak, Shayam Menon, Edwin
Parkinson, Christopher Talley and
Paul Youngman.

Alternates are sophomores Brian
Fagan, Joseph Krastel, John Lowe,
Jon Miles, Steven Pockrass, John
Riordan and Kevin Weaver.

counselors. The other two are Dandrea Miller and Kathleen Plante.

Law, exchange students to counsel coeds

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

How do you find women up-
perclassmen to be dormitory coun-
selors when you have always been an
all-male school and there are no
women who are upperclassmen?

Washington and Lee has solved this
predicament by recruiting three
women law students and an ex-
change student to be dorm coun-
selors. Second-year law student Jan-
na Johnson, first-year law students
Terri Amernick and Dandrea Miller
and Kathleen Plante, a Hollins Col-
lege junior who had been an ex-
change student at W&L for a year,
were selected as dorm counselors for
1985-1986.

But why would three hard-working,
sane law students want to be dorm
counselors?

Miller said she was a dorm coun-
selor for two years at Grove City Col-
lege when she was an undergraduate.
She enjoyed the first semester at
W&L and wanted to do something to
help the freshmen women assimilate
into the W&L environment, she said.

Amernick said that she was a
sorority adviser as an undergraduate
at the University of Virginia and felt
that she has a background similar to
the women who will be coming to
W&L. She said she also enjoyed her
first semester here.

“T felt like I had taken something
out of the W&L community this year,
and I wanted to put something back
into it next year,” Amernick said.
“That might sound a little corny,”
she added as an afterthought.

Johnson cited both the financial aid

What Will It Mean?

 

 

that being a dorm counselor would
provide and a desire to help the
freshmen women adapt to W&L as
the reasons she decided to become a
dorm counselor.

“I knew that it was going to be
rough for some of the women next
year,” Johnson said.

She said that having been one of a
handful of women living in Baker
Dormitory a year ago, she could
sympathize with the freshman
women who will be a minority next

year. Although no one did anything »

specific to make her feel uncomfor-
table, Johnson said that it still was
difficult to feel at ease in that situa-
tion.

Johnson said her experience as an
undergraduate at the University of
Richmond, where men and women
lived in separate dormitories, also
familiarized her with some of the
problems that can crop up on a
segregated campus.

Miller said she is looking forward
to being a dorm counselor.

“I’m excited about it. I’m not
dreading it by any means. I think the
girls are going to have a good time at
W&L,” Miller said.

“There’ll be a few rough spots,”

Sophomore with highest GPA
given Phi Beta Kappa award

Jeffrey Scott Mandak, a
sophomore from Clifton, N.J., has
been named the winner of the Phi
Beta Kappa Sophomore Award for
1984-85. > s

Presented annually by W&L’s
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the
award recognizes superlative
scholastic achievement among
undergraduates in their first two
years at the University. The award

goes to the sophomore who has at-
tained the highest cumulative
scholastic average through the end of
the fall term of his second year at
W&L.

Mandak is a Robert E.. Lee Re-
search Scholar in chemistry. He was
the winner of two awards a year ago,

Chemistry and the Jim Stump Prize
in German.

she conceded. ‘‘But they’ll be ironed
out.”’

Miller added that she anticipates a
lot of complex problems regarding
the rules and regulations for the dor-
mitories, with such questions as
inter-visitation between dorms being
hot issues.

As for whether being a dorm coun-
selor will cut into her academic time,
Miller said that she usually studies at
home and not in the library so she
will be there if anyone on her hall
needs to talk to her.

“Being a second-year law student
is time consuming. But it doesn’t
mean that you can’t have any other
activites,” Miller added.

“I think it’s going to be great,”
Amernick said of being a dorm
counselor. ‘‘I have the Law School
guys telling me, ‘Sure, I’ll help you
out with it anytime,’ ’’ she said,
laughing.

Amernick said that being a dorm
counselor next year probably will be
a little tougher than it would have
been if the school were not going to be
coed for the first time. She added,
though, that many of the problems
people are anticipating next year
may not materialize.

She said the freshman men who
will be coming to W&L know the
school is going to be coed and will not
have a negative attitude toward the
women.

“As a Law School woman, I don’t
think the guys look down on us or
anything like that,’’ Amernick said.

“They'll [the women] feel the fact
that they’re a minority. But that
doesn’t have to be totally against
you,”’ she said.

Amernick said that most of the

women who have come to visit the
school this year seem very outgoing
and if they have an attitude of not
worrying about being in the minority
it will not be as big a problem.

The age gap between herself and
the freshman on her hall should not
be a problem, Amernick said.
Although she will not be able to give
them much advice on things such as
what classes to take, Amernick said
she will be able to help them with the
normal problems that women at all
colleges have.

“T want them to look at me as a
friend,”’ Amernick said.

Being a dorm counselor will cut in-
to her studying time somewhat,
Amernick conceded. But she noted
that she usually studies in the
undergraduate library where the
women on her hall could find her if
they wanted to talk to her.

Johnson said she hoped that being
older than the freshman women
wouldnot beaproblem. .,_,,

‘I’m hoping that will prove to be an
asset. I hope they’ll look at me as
someone they can come to for advice.
I might be able to offer an objective
opinion. I’m approachable enough,”
Johnson said.

She added that she did not know if
being a dorm counselor next year
will be tougher than it would be under
other circumstances.

“It’s hard to say whether it will be
tougher. I think it will be different
from other circumstances.”’

She said that she hoped that being a
dorm counselor would not cut into
her studying time.

Plante is studying overseas this
term and was unavailable for com-
ment.

U.Va. honor appeal
denied in open hearing

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE — An
unusual honor case at the University
of Virginia apparently has ended
with the denial of a retrial to a
former student convicted of lying on
a calculus test.

The case of Monique R. Fawcett,
20, of Farmville, differed from most
U.Va. honor cases in that every stage
was open to the public.

Fawcett was convicted in an open
trial — the first in 142 years at the
university — Sept. 30 of lying by
resubmitting the test for regrading,
knowing that the grade on the test
had been increased from 62 to 85.

On Feb. 17, almost a year after she
took the calculus test, Fawcett’s bid
for a new trial was heard by a panel
of five Honor Committee members.
After three hours of arguments and
more than an hour of deliberation,
the panel denied Fawcett’s request.
At least three members of the panel
would have had to approve the re-
quest for a new trial to occur. Neither
the panel’s reasoning nor its vote was
released.

At U.Va., a student can appeal an
honor conviction only if his rights
were denied in the investigation or
original trial or if new evidence is
discovered that would tend to ex-
onerate him.

Fawecett’s appeal was based on five
grounds:

eHer accusers, engineering
students Douglas K. Murray and
Nelson A. Nieves, did not conduct a
thorough investigation and failed to
interview all pertinent witnesses
before confronting Fawcett with the
accusation.

Bradley Saxton, a third-year law
student and a counsel for the ac-
cusers, responded that ‘‘the in-
vestigation was not inadequate. It
was a model investigation.”

¢Fawcett was not told the specific
nature of her accusation until four
days before her original trial in
September. When confronted by
Murray and Nieves on March 29, she
was accused only of “lying on’’ the
test rather than “‘lying by’’ resubmit-
ting the altered test, according to her
counsel, Rolin Bissell, a third-year
law student.

“The accusation is a very impor-
tant statement,” Bissell said. ‘‘On
the basis of the accusation, and not
the jury charge, individuals decide
whether to leave the university and
how to prepare their case.’’

Chris Hockett, the accusers’ other
counsel, said that the written accusa-
tion fulfilled the Honor Committee
constitution and that the accusers ex-
plained the details to Fawcett.

MONIQUE R. FAWCETT
Appeal denied by panel

¢Fawcett was not given a trial date
within three weeks of her accusation,
as is provided by the constitution.

Rob Buell, Honor Committee vice
chairman in charge of trials and one
of two witnesses called during the ap-
peal hearing, said that because the
accusation occurred in late March,
just before exams began, obtaining
counsel was difficult and it would
have been infeasible to hold a trial
last spring.

¢Fawcett’s right to cross-examine
her accusers was abridged because
she was not allowed to do so in the
original trial until almost six hours
after they had testified.

Because of the delay, Susan
Bradley, another of her counsel, said
the cross-examination that did occur
“was, in effect, little more than a
trial formality.”

Hockett responded that the con-
stitution does not stipulate when the
cross-examination must occur and
that Fawcett was magnifying the im-
portance of the delay.

eFawcett was tried under a defini-
tion of reprehensibility — along with
act and intent the requirements for
an honor violation to have occurred
— that did not allow for extenuating
circumstances. The definition in ef-
fect when she was accused, though,
did allow for extenuating cir-
cumstances, argued David Berten, a
third-year architecture student and
another of Fawcett’s counsel.

Because she was not aware of the
possibility, Berten said, Fawcett did
not consider preparing a defense bas-
ed on extenuating circumstances.

The hearing’s other witness, Bobby *
Blue, Honor Committee vice chair-
man in charge of advisers and chair-
man of the original trial, said both
sides were aware of the definition of
reprehensibility that would be used
in the trial and that Fawcett had a
fair trial.

4 students’ property stolen

From Staff Reports

 

Break meant break-ins for four
Washington and Lee students who in
two separate incidents lost posses-
sions to an intruder entering through
a window.

Senior Paul Casey, a resident of
Lee House II, was in town for break
but left for a day and came back on
Feb. 17 to find he’d lost a number of
items, including a K-mart calculator
worth $3, a blow dryer, a razor, two

pairs of mirrored sunshades (one
with wire ear lobes), a shot glass, two
beer glasses, two bottles of beer and
20 tapes worth $100.

Juniors Thornton Brooksbank, Lee
Hollis and Clint Shelton had $1,580 in
possessions, including a color televi-
sion and three stereos, stolen from
their Lexington house during vaca-
tion. They discovered the loss when
they returned early Monday.

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said there are no leads in either case.

Chapel Hel

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Selected
scribblings from a notebook taken to
the University of North Carolina dur-
ing break:

Dean Simpson thinks we're bad
(Part 1): The credentials of an after-
dinner speaker were being read off.
She had all sorts of degrees and sat
on dozens of boards and foundations
and so forth. A staff member from
the University of Georgia sitting
across from us muttered: ‘‘Bet she
can’t bakea cake’...

Dean Simpson would die (Part 2):
On UNC exam bluebooks, it says that
if you’re in doubt about the questions,
you should consult the instructor:
‘*He can be found in his office’’....

Fast frat facts: Administrators
think the fraternity houses here are a
mess. The upstairs of most of the
UNC houses look like a combination
of Beirut and Hiroshima...The wall-
to-wall tartan carpet at SAE is a nice
touch. For the letters on the front of

the house, though, they have an ‘‘S’”’
instead of a sigma. Tacky....At Pika,
the brothers all wore navy blazers,
white shirts and red ties for the color
composite. Looks like VMI....Sigma
Chi keeps its cold test file in the
upstairs bathroom....Kappa Sig has a
soda machine in its bathroom
(‘Mountain Dew, please’’)...Klass
Act: KA has a VCR on its downstairs
TV...At UNC, it’s Betas that are
known as “‘the fish’’...Sigma Nu locks
its doors as if it were a women’s
dorm. After looking around, though,
it’s probably not a bad idea...Sig Ep
has a brand new house that looks fan-
tastic. The brothers were terrific, but
a ‘‘Battlezone’’ video game in the
basement? Come on....Why don’t
W&L fraternities have washers and
dryers in the houses’...

‘Who, me? Generalize?’’: A
female assessment: ‘‘All the frater-
nities are Southern, except Chi Psi.
They’re progressive’...

Is this Chapel Hill or High Point?
One fraternity is known as Phi
Gram....At one party, a drug deal
was going on between two people,

neither of whom knew what they
were doing. It was so bad it was ac-
tually boring for one eavesdropper.
The girl probably still thinks she was
buying Tupperware....Drug use is a
lot more visible there than it is at
W&L. One woman visiting from the
University of Georgia observed: “All
my friends who come here drug out, I
mean, like, I’ve tried it too, but that
doesn’t mean I’m hots--t or any-
thing”’..

I wanna party with you: One of our
group said one of his friends had a
pretty intense night the night before.
He and four friends polished off 30
beers, five joints and 10 lines. And
some people worry about mixing
brew and G&Ts....

I thought this sort of thing only hap-
pened at W&L: A guy at one of the
fraternities said this girl had said
she'd stay the night if he’d drive her
back to Durham (15 minutes) in the
morning. He said he didn’t feel like
doing that. I asked why he didn’t put
her on the bus. The immediate
response: “It wasn’t worth $5.50”’....

Let's make a list of things not to do

J-computers ‘wearing out’

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

The computer system donated to
the journalism department in 1980
needs to be replaced, according to at
least one professor.

“The thing’s just wearing out. It’s
more than 10 years old,”’ said Hamp-
den H. Smith III, associate professor
of journalism, in reference to the
computer system once used by the
Newport News Daily Press and
Times-Herald.

The department hopes the Board of
Trustees will approve in May a pro-
posal for an eight-terminal system
independent of the University’s cen-

tral student computer.
Three or four vendors of
newspaper ‘‘front-end’’ systems

have been considered in the search
for a new system, according to
Smith.

The department is looking for a
computer system that allows the ter-
minals to operate either with the
system or independent of it, he add-
ed.

Operating in conjunction with the
system, a terminal would have the
ability to provide statistical codes for
students enrolled in Journalism 203.
Operating independently, as a word
processor does, a terminal would
feature editing capabilities limited
only by the type of disk used.

The old system is currently housed
in the newsroom on the third floor of
Reid Hall.

Students in Journalism 312 use the
computer during the initial stages of
publishing the ‘Lexington Daily
Bugle.”

From Staff Reports

 

A Monday ritual for many
Washington and Lee students is trek-
king down to the post office, opening
their mailboxes and hastily chucking
the Rockbridge Weekly lurking in-
side.

The Rockbridge Weekly is what’s
known as a ‘‘total market coverage”’
publication — rather than selling
subscriptions like a traditional news-
paper, it is sent without charge to
all area residents.

Advertisers like that, but anyone
who stands in the post office for a day
will quickly realize that because
everyone receives the newspaper
doesn’t necessarily mean everyone
reads it. On Monday, many students
were seen following the three-step
routine outlined above.

The newspaper has _ recognized
there may be some waste involved
and has taken steps to curtail it.

This week’s issue of the paper con-
tained a postage-paid reply card in-
viting boxholders to ‘help us to trim
our printing costs by letting us know

 

but they sure weren’t made for hur-
rying’’....

Bar B.S. (Part 1): This girl was
asking me about W&L. I said some-
thing about ‘“‘coeducation”; ap
parently she thought I said ‘Kasey
Kasem.”” “‘Oh, yeah — I listen to
American Top 40, too,’’ quoth Ms.
Einstein...

Bar B.S. (Part 2): Ata reception, I
went up to the person in charge and
said, ‘You did a terrific job of put-
ting this together, Sandra. Good
work.”’ “‘That’s very suave, but quit
staring at my nametag,”’ she teased.
“‘Jugular,”’ I said, making a stab-in-
the-back motion. ‘Girls in North
Carolina are smarter than girls in
Virginia,’ she said. It’s a tough call,
but I guess somebody has to make

Why do all drunks sound the
same? I was waiting for a cab out-
side the Top of the Hill market near
the fraternities. A car pulled up

bridge Weekly in your post office
box : ”

The card invites you to check “‘yes
— please make sure I get The Rock-
bridge Weekly” or ‘‘no — thanks
anyway, but you may stop delivery.”

Assistant publisher Patricia Burch
said the paper is hoping to eliminate
duplication for people who receive
the paper both at home and in their
box and also to avoid inflicting the
paper on people who have no interest
init.

‘““We’ve had a couple of people say
they get aggravated by the paper,”
she said. ‘If you don’t wantit, there’s
no reason we should send it out if peo-
ple are just going to throw it away.”

Burch said one problem with the
survey was that it was inserted in the
paper, so people who don’t want the
paper and instantly toss it had no
chance to see the card.

‘“‘We wanted to send it separately,
but because of postal regulations we
had to put it in inside the paper,”’ she
said.

Moore said he has noticed that lobby

trashcans sometimes overflow with
the papers. “We have observed
that,” he said. ‘‘I feel like probably
most of the ones that are discarded
are from the students, because they
don’t have the interest in them that
local people do.”’

He added, though, that the paper
doesn’t create any special cleanup
difficulties for the post office. “‘We
may have to police the lobby a little
better, but it doesn’t create any real
problems,”’ he said.

Moore said that of Lexington’s
1,350 post office boxes, about one-
third are held by students.

The Rockbridge Weekly says it has
a circulation of 13,000, and Moore
said many of those look forward to
the paper. “‘We get some complaints
if they happen not to get one,” he
said. ‘Once they become accustom-
ed to receiving it, they kind of expect

Burch said the paper has received
similar comments, and she doesn’t
expect many cancellations. ‘‘You
don’t find many people who’ll turn

Law School applications up 11% |

Applications to the School of Law

up almost 11 percent over a year ago.

That increase is in contrast to

tionwide.

As of February 19, W&L had re-
ceived 973 applications for the 120
positions in next year’s entering Law

“We are cautiously optimistic at

In addition, some wealthy people
able to pay for their children’s educa-
tion still qualify for aid. The problem,
DeCourcy said, is the use of the ad-

a family’s ability to pay.

“Some very wealthy people have

A family with an adjusted gross in-
come of $50,000 and four children in

“These are the things that should —

Under Reagan’s proposals, an ad-
justed gross income of more than
$25,000 makes a family ineligible for
any federal aid other than subsidiz-
ed, indirect loans — usually the
Guaranteed Student Loan. An ad-
justed gross income above $32,500
makes a family ineligible for the
Guaranteed Student Loan, and the
only federal aid that family can

percent loan.

18-year-old _

Nine present and former Virginia
Military Institute cadets have been
subpoenaed to testify in next week’s
drug-dealing trial of former cadet
Jeffrey R. Pack, who is charged with
six counts of distributing the hallu-
cinogen psilocybin.

Since Pack was indicted Sept. 4 by
a Rockbridge County grand jury, his
three attorneys have filed a flurry of
motions, including two separate re-
quests that the indictment be dis-
missed.

Pack, a former VMI cadet who now
lives in Springfield, is free on a
$20,000 property bond. He left VMI
without graduating.

A jury trial is scheduled for March
8.

A pretrial hearing to consider the
defense motions has been set for
Tuesday by Judge Rudolph Bum-
gardner III, chief of the 25th Judicial
Circuit. Pack’s attorneys have asked
that:

eThe judge unseal the minutes of
the special grand jury that invest-
igated local narcotics trafficking last
year.

eThe indictment be dismissed be-
cause of improprieties in the conduct
of the special grand jury.

eThe indictment be dismissed
because of violations of Pack’s due
process rights.

eThe testimony of any of Pack’s
VMI classmates be excluded from
evidence.

A new trial date be set in April or
May since March 8 conflicts with
their schedule and would not allow
enough time for all the motions to be
settled and have the necessary pre-
paration completed if a trial is re-
quired.

Pack’s attorneys are Thomas C.
Spencer of Lexington, Albert J.
Ahern Jr. of Bailey’s Crossroads and

More than miles separate Sem, India

“I was planned to marry my cousin
whom I happen to hate,’’ Nagendren
said. “If I was ever seen talking to
another boy at school I would be out
of school and married in a week.”’

As far as the social life at Southern
Seminary is concerned, Nagendren
said she plans to concentrate on her
studies before taking on a full social
calendar. She is taking a 19-hour
course load that includes calculus,
biology, English composition, Eng-

lish literature, animal science and”

equestrian management. j

‘People here take an education for
granted,’ Nagendren said. ‘‘The
girls here can’t believe I don’t want a
car and a boyfriend. I have gone
through too much to sacrifice my stu-
dies.”

When asked what her major goal
is, Nagendren quickly responded, ‘‘I
need the satisfaction that I did my
best, but eventually I just want to be
like the rest of the girls and go out on
Saturday night.”’

Auditions to be held tonight

Washington and Lee’s advanced
directing class will hold open tryouts
tonight for three one-act plays to be
presented in April.

The tryouts will be at 7:30 p.m. in
the Boiler Room Theatre under the
Old Main Street Mall on Henry
Street.

The plays to be presented are Ed-
ward <Albee’s “The Zoo Story,”

directed by W&L junior Christopher
Carmouche; ‘Bea, Frank, Ritchie
and Joan” by Renee Taylor and Joe
Bolognia, directed by junior David
Marsh; and Peter Shaffer’s ‘‘Black
Comedy,” directed by senior Todd
Jones.

Performances will be April 3 and 4
in the Boiler Room Theatre.

Louis Koutoulakos of Arlington.

Rockbridge Circuit Judge George
E. Honts III, who would usually han-
die the case, transferred the case to
Bumgardner because it was Honts
who impaneled the special grand
jury.

The prosecutor has also been
changed. Henrico County Common-
wealth’s Attorney H. Albert Nance
Jr. has been named special prosecu-
tor since Rockbridge Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’
Read may be called to testify in the
pretrial hearing.

Pack has charged Read with “‘mis-
use of the prosecutorial function’’ in
connection with the special grand
jury.

Pack’s indictment consisted of six
counts, each with identical wording,
charging Pack with selling psilocy-
bin (“‘shrooms”’ in street language)
in the city of Lexington in July of
1983.

Pack’s attorneys said in a motion
that the indictment lacked specificity
and that it was impossible for him to
prepare a defense for the individual
counts.

Nance responded on Feb. 12 that
Pack was being charged with six sep-
arate acts of sales to six different in-
dividuals on or about July 19.

Two days later, Pack’s lawyers re-
quested the names of the individual
purchasers. The judge will rule on
that request Tuesday.

The defense attorneys say that part
of the reason they have requested a
delay in the trial is that ‘‘if the defen-
dant is successful in either of the mo-
tions, there would be notrial.”’

Therefore, if the trial were to go
forward, he would need additional
time after the pretrial hearing to pre-
pare a defense.

In the latest Pack document, his
attorneys charge that his indictment
was improperly presented to the reg-
ular grand jury and that the special
grand jury itself was illegally impan-
eled.

“The invocation of this special
grand jury shortly before the election
involving the Commonwealth’s At-

torney’s office is a factor which may
or may not throw some light on the
rather extraordinary procedures
which were invoked in this case,”’ the
motion for dismissal says.

The minutes of the special grand
jury are necessary to determine
whether Pack’s constitutional pro-
tection against self-incrimination
was violated, the motion says.

It added that ‘fundamental
fairness and regard for due process
require that these minutes be unseal-
ed so that the truth may be ascertain-
ed.”

In his November motion, Pack said
Read violated the principle of law-
yer-client confidentiality by disclos-
ing information to the special grand
jury that he had obtained while
meeting with Pack as a private attor-
ney.

The motion referred to Read’s
“warlike campaign against mem-
bers of society who used drugs.”’

Read said in a response that the
Pack document was ‘‘a_ politically
motivated attack against the entire
drug investigation and against me
personally.”

He said Pack was never a client
and that he had been indicted on the
basis of ‘‘testimony of numerous wit-
nesses who stated that he was a drug
dealer at VMI.”

Both motions were sent to the Vir-
ginia State Bar as part of the report
resulting from a Rockbridge County-
Buena Vista Bar Association invest-
igation of Read’s conduct as a prose-
cutor andas a private attorney.

Nance seems to be taking good-na-
turedly his role as a special pro-
secutor in a county across the state
from his home base. In a Feb. 11 let-
ter to Patterson, he wrote: ‘‘As my
tour in Lexington progresses, if you

find I fail to comply with your pro-

cedures please let me know and I will
get in line. Only my girth is substan-
tial, not my ego!”’

The Feb. 20 document requesting ~
14 prosecution witnesses for the jury
trial is signed by Nance but written
on Read’s stationery.

Wilkins: Republicans gaining

 

From Staff Reports

Lexington’s delegate to the
General Assembly spent the 46-day
session trying his wings as the new
whip for the Republican Caucus, and
looking back says he was pleased
with what he was able to accomplish.

S. Vance Wilkins Jr., delegate for
the 24th District, including Lexington
and northern Rockbridge County, is
serving his seventh year in the
House. Wilkins, who heads an
Amherst construction firm, was
elected-to the whip post by his GOP
colleagues.

“T guess the title comes from whip-
ping people into line,” he said, ex-
plaining that he did a lot of person-to-
person work in his attempt to in-
fluence votes and maintain party dis-
cipline. “I twisted a lot of arms,” he
said good naturedly.

Wilkins said that compared with
the work of the Republican whip in
the past, he’d made great strides.
“The year before it was just a title,”
he said, adding that he still had not
measured up to his own goals for all
he'd like to accomplish in the office.

Wilkins said Republicans have sig-
nificantly increased their visibility in
the statehouse in recent years. ‘‘On
votes that are anywhere controver-
sial, we now have some balance,” he
said proudly.

He said he plans to serve as minori-
ty whip again next session, but of-

fered no guarantees. ‘‘I would expect
$0, but politics is no sure science,”’ he
said.

The Norfolk newspapers last
month conducted a poll in which
legislators, lobbyists, state officials
and reporters were invited to rank
the effectiveness of each member of
the General Assembly.

Wilkins was rated 88th in influence
out of the 100 in the House, down from
69th ina similar survey in 1981.

The newspapers reported at the
time that the Joint House-Senate
Republican Caucus had voted unan-
imously not to participate in the
survey.

Wilkins said Republicans objected
to the poll because the GOP is out-
numbered three-to-one in the party
lineup. ‘‘With 34 Republicans and 66
Democrats, you’re never going to get
a fair shake,” he said.

In his role as whip, Wilkins urged
Republicans not to answer the
survey. ‘‘I got them to agree to leave
it alone,’’ he said. ‘‘It was unfair and
biased. There’s no sense _partici-
pating in your ownrape.”

Wilkins said the activity in Rich-
mond continues to make it an ex-
citing if challenging place to work
part of the year. ‘‘It’s really hectic at
times — I had as many as two or
three meetings at once,” he recalled.

He said he would put his aide in one
meeting, his wife in another and he
would attend the one where a vote
was most likely to come up first. The

clout in Virginia’s legislature

three would then play musical meet-
ings, all passing in the hall as they
shifted among the sessions, with
Wilkins “‘literally running across the
hall.”

Wilkins said it’s more important
that he talk to people about key bills
and be in the most important votes
than to diligently vote on every single
issue and not work on the major ones.

“I miss a few votes that way, but I
think it’s for a good purpose,’’ he
said. ‘‘I’ve never missed a session.”’

General Assembly:
85 session recap

In addition to raising the drinking
age from 19 to 21, the 1985 General
Assembly, which adjourned Satur-
day, took the following action on
several other bills of interest:

¢Passed a bill making Rockbridge
County the site of the new Virginia
Horse Center.

Killed in a Senate committee a bill
that would have required drivers and
front-séat passengers to wear seat-
belts when traveling in automobiles.
This bill, which passed the House of
Delegates, would have set a $25 fine
for violation of the law.

¢Passed a bill requiring motorists
to stay in the right-hand lane of
highways except in certain situa-
tions, such as when passing.

Killed a bill requiring the convic-

 

VANCE WILKINS

tion for drunken driving of anyone
with a blood-alcohol content of .1 or
more. The Senate passed this bill, but
the House killed it.

¢Killed two bills requiring hunters
to wear blaze orange clothing while
hunting west of the Blue Ridge.

ePassed a state constitutional
amendment allowing the governor to
run for a second consecutive term,
beginning with the governor elected
in 1989. The amendment must be ap-
proved by the legislature again next
year and by the voters in November
1986. Virginia governors are allowed
to serve more than one four-year
term, but may not serve consecutive
terms.

*Killed a bill that would have re-
quired girls under 18 to receive per-
mission from their parents or either
a judge or a doctor before getting an
abortion.

*Killed a bill for a referendum on
whether Virginia should establish a
state lottery.

Wa&L ‘crowds’ cause some concern

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

If Washington and Lee sports
crowds are notorious for one thing, it
is probably that they simply do not
show up, a fact that bothers athletic
department officials.

“‘Most of the coaches are very con-
cerned,” Athletic Director William
D. McHenry said, ‘‘and the president
is worried as well.”

McHenry also expressed his feel-
ings about the student body’s respon-
sibility to attend sporting events.

“T think it is up to the student
leaders to stimulate interest,” he
said. ‘lam really disappointed about
the disinterest in the basketball pro-

gram. It was the same for both swim-
ming and wrestling.”

Many students can remember high

school basketball games with a
larger crowd than W&L games.

According to Richard Miller, asso-
ciate director of athletics, low atten-
dance is not due to the teams’ perfor-
mances.

“That doesn’t have a thing to do
with it, personally,”’ Miller said, ‘‘In
basketball, when we were [playing
well] it was no different from last
year.”

If that’s not the reason, then what
is?

“We don’t know,’’ Miller said. ‘“‘We
met on this last spring. Nationwide,
Division III athletics is no different.
All Division III schools have this pro-
blem. Basically, why should a fella
come watch a game at Division III
when he can sit at home with a beer
and watch Notre Dame or Michigan?

Why, you even have a better seat,

than the people there.”’

All the same, McHenry said he is
still upset about W&L’s attendance.
He said that he ‘‘absolutely”’ thinks
that the low attendance affects the
teams.

“It’s very disappointing. You
figure these basketball players work
hard all week and then play to 25 or 30
people,” McHenry said.

Miller added that a supportive stu-
dent body ‘‘gives a team a big boost.”

So, what can be done?

Miller said, ‘‘We’ve had promo-
tional stunts, but they’ve gone over
like lead balloons.”’

For instance, the Athletic Depart-
ment scheduled doubleheaders at a
few basketball games in which
women’s colleges were invited to
play preliminary games. In addition,
students at the women’s colleges
have been invited to some athletic

events as guests. These efforts have
been of no help, according to Mc-
Henry.

Some things have worked, though;
the tailgate parties before football
games last fall went over nicely, as
did scheduling the intramural and in-
tercollegiate swim meets together,
McHenry said.

“However, there is such a heavy
emphasis on drinking parties,” Mc-
Henry continued. ‘‘It’s a shame. If
we sold beer, then the crowds would
show, but we won’t do that.”’

McHenry said he hopes that
coeducation will help attendance
because a night at a basketball game
would make a pleasant, inexpensive
date. However, he says it is up to the
student body to show some interest.

“‘T think it is your ultimate respon-
sibility.”

Beaches to Beatles: Glee Club goes West

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

While some Washington and Lee
students were spending the Wash-
ington Holiday in-New Orleans or on
the beach, one group of students went
even farther away — to California.

The Glee Club made its annual tour
over the holiday, spending 10 days on
the West Coast.

From Feb. 15 through Sunday, the
group gave eight concerts in four
cities. The group sang at Disneyland
in Anaheim and also appeared in Los
Angeles, San Diego and Monterey.

 

According to Dr. Gordon Spice,
who directs the Glee Club, all of the
performances went well, especially
the concerts at the Intercollegiate
Musical Council Festival at Loyola
Marymount University in Los
Angeles and-at the Santa Catalina
School in Monterey.

Spice said the group “‘held its own
against the California schools’ at the
festival.

The concert at the Santa Catalina
School was the best performance
during the tour, Spice said. He
credited the ‘‘enthusiastic’’ audience
at the women’s high school with mak-
ing the concert such a success. Their

respouse brought out the best in the
club, he said.

Several members of the group said
that concert was the highlight of the
trip because it was given in front of
about 300 screaming, applauding
young women.

Junior John-Paul Bouffard said the
audience’s reaction reminded him of
a Beatles’ concert because of the
screaming.

Robert Vienneau, the group’s ac-
companist, said the concert was the
highlight of his career as a pianist.
He said he received a standing ova-
tion after performing a solo and then
was presented with flowers and ask-

ed for his autograph at the end of the
concert.

In addition to performing, the Glee
Club toured several popular attrac-
tions, including Disneyland, the San
Diego Zoo and San Francisco, as well
as taking a drive along the Pacific
Coast Highway.

Sophomore Andrew Bouie said,
“What made the trip were the people.
All the audiences, not just the one at
Santa Catalina, were good to sing
to,’”’

Bouffard said the officers made
sure everyone had fun on the tour.

VRB, not EC,
to run meetin
for candidates

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

Petitions from students wishing to
run for Executive Committee presi-
dent, vice president or secretary
should be submitted to the Voting
Regulations Board at a mandatory
candidates’ meeting Monday at 6:30
p.m. in the EC room.

The decision allowing the VRB,
rather than the EC, to conduct the
rules meeting for the candidates was
the subject of some controversy at
the EC meeting Monday night.

“The EC shouldn’t conduct an elec-
tion,’’ said sophomore representative
Andrew Caruthers, who had drafted
a set of rules and regulations that had
been tabled for five weeks before be-
ing approved Monday. The new rules
put the power of running an election
into the hands of the VRB, but the EC
still maintains the right to hear ap-
peals to the VRB, which is itself an
arm of the EC.

Some EC members, including
President Cole Dawson, were vocal
in their opposition to allowing the
VRB to run the rules meeting without
EC supervision. After the decision,
however, Dawson said he was satis-
fied with the outcome.

“I was not disappointed,’ Dawson
added. ‘‘This will be a test to see if it
works out well.”

Dawson said he was worried that
some people might show up at the EC
meeting at 7 rather than the VRB
meeting at 6:30, because the EC has
conducted the rules setting meeting
in the past. Also, a student might ap-

“ways of growing and understand-

ing’ basic to an undergraduate
education.

‘While learning cannot of course

take place devoid of subject matter,

how that subject matter is experienc-
ed is what concerns us here,”’ the

report said.

Elrod said W&L’s General Educa-
tion Requirements to a great degree
already meet the standards of the
report. ‘“‘What we have done in our
General Education Requirements is
return to what we had before we
liberalized the requirements,” he
said.

The report’s minimum required
curriculum would include studies of:

eInquiry, abstract logical thinking
and critical analysis — ‘‘the heart of
the intellectual process.’’ Elrod said
this subject is covered by the General
Education mathematics require-
ment. ‘‘That emphasis we’ve got
taken care of. Mathematics, logic,
statistics, computer science — all of
those courses contribute to that kind
of thinking,’’ he added. '

eLiteracy: writing, reading, speak-
ing, listening. Students entering W&L
this year have to take one English
course and two literature courses.

“That’s a wonderful requirement,”’
Elrod said.

eUnderstanding numerical data.
The calculus or computer science re-
quirement covers that subject, Elrod
said.

eHistorical consciousness, The
General Education Requirements re-
quire a student to take four courses
from at least two of the following sub-
jects: history, fine arts, philosophy
and religion, ‘‘A student could get out
of here without having had a course
in philosophy. We’re not as ironclad
about that as the report recommends
we should be,”’ Elrod said.

Fine arts. See above.

*Science. A laboratory science
course now is required at W&L.

eValues, i.e., a moral philosophy
course. W&L does not require such a
course, but they are offered in the
philosophy and religion departments.
At any rate, Elrod said, ‘Teachers
who are serious about their disci-
plines will find it difficult to ignore
the question of values in their
disciplines.”

eInternational and multicultural
experiences. ‘‘I think it’s extremely
important for students to come into
contact with a non-Western culture

while they’re here, and we just don’t
require that,” Elrod said. ‘‘There is a
limit to what you can require, but I
wouldn’t be at all disappointed to see
that added, somehow.”

Study in depth. Elrod said this re-
quirement is covered already by
W&L’s academic majors, but he add-
ed that he would still like to see each
major reviewed to make sure each
student has ‘‘a unified understanding
of what that discipline is all about.”

“We spent the last couple of years
here struggling with these General
Education Requirements,” Elrod
said. ‘I think it’s time now for the
departments to take a serious look at
the requirements for the major.”

“The major should be not just a
potpourri of courses taken in a par-
ticular area, but should be a careful-
ly thought-through, integrated selec-
tion of courses that the entire faculty
ina given department agrees on.”

The report went on to charge pro-
fessors with concentrating on
research at the expense of teaching.

While stressing that university
research is integral to keeping a
sense of discovery on campuses, the
report said the reward system that
professors work under tends to make
them concentrate on research to
achieve recognition within their
fields.

“Central to the troubles and to the
solution are the professors, for the
development that overwhelmed the
old curriculum and changed the en-
tire nature of higher education was

scholars with Ph.D. degrees with an
allegiance to academic disciplines
stronger than their commitment to
teaching.’’

That misplaced allegiance hds led
to less effectiveness in the classroom
as well as a curriculum determined

by a professor’s desire to protett his |

own courses rather than protegt the
needs of an undergraduate educa-
tion, the report said. ”

Elrod said he has not seen, that
trend among W&L professors.

“‘T don’t think we have ever had the
problem here of people ignoring
teaching because of their interests in
research,’ he said, ’

‘“What we want to do is to continue
the tradition that we already have of
the teacher-scholar emphasis at
Washington and Lee. That te we
have teachers teaching our studen
who are professionally active in. their
fields of specialization.”

“That’s what makes Washington
and Lee such a potentially continuing
dynamic institution.”’

Elrod said W&L’s faculty has’ been
responsible in caring for the, cur-
riculum. Evidence of that are the re-
quirements instituted this year. +

“The faculty has, to its credit, held
out the high standards of quality
education all along,” he said. .“‘The
students should appreciate that com-
mitment, the long-standing cofnmit-
ment of the faculty to quality educa-
tion.”’ :

It is only fitting that the weather in
Lexington this week should be sunny
‘and warm, perhaps a good omen as
the 1985 W&L lacrosse season is set to
begin Saturday. The cool breeze on
Wilson Field is much like the smell of

. teams, however, the break is a
time of intense practice sessions.
The W&L baseball team got to
spend the practice time in
Florida, while the lacrosse team,
ina break with tradition, stayed in

: | Lexington for the week.

“This year’s trip was probably

“"P the most successful one we've had

, yet,” said baseball coach James
Murdock, commenting on the
’ team’s stay in Deerfield Beach.
‘‘We were able to do a lot of quali-
ty scrimmaging and not just busy
r ~=work.”’

The Generals’ scrimmage part-
ner was Florida Atlantic Universi-
ty, last year’s No. 2-ranked NCAA
Division II team, according to
Murdock. The scrimmages work-
ed well, he said, because the
Florida team was willing to work
in controlled situations, whereas
in the past, teams would simply
use the Generals as a tuneup.

Murdock said, ‘‘we

 

but there are too many unknowns to
make any predictions.”

While this year’s team has many
returning players from last year, the
attitude is new. The team slogan is,
“Be the best we can be.’’ No one is
making predictions of going 11-0. As
a matter of fact, no one will make a
prediction. The members of the team
are not putting themselves in a must-
win situation. The attitude is simply
one of giving 100 percent.

Another change is the fact that the
team decided not to travel to Florida
during the Washington Holiday break
this year. Instead they stayed in Lex-
ington for workouts. said Rich Sch-
oenberg, co-captain and the Gen-
erals’ dominant force in the faceoff
circle. “It was different than when
we went to Florida because here we
were with each other 24 hours a day.
We were almost forced to stay to-
gether.”’ (See related story below)

The biggest difference in Generals’
lacrosse ‘85 may be the disappear-
ance of the midfielder from the game
plan. The new look Generals will
sport only offensive lines and defen-
sive lines. This setup allows for a
stronger attack both ways, Daly said.
On Saturday, the Generals have their

pre-set situations, and we could
stop the action when we wanted to
give instruction.”

One drawback to this year’s
trip, Murdock said, was the
absence of former assistant
coaches Jeff Stickley and Maj.
Doug Smith of VMI, both of whom
resigned earlier this year due to
time commitments elsewhere.
The result was a cut in individual
coaching in hitting, but otherwise
the practices went well, Murdock
said, with much of the credit going
to senior co-captains Mike
Jacoby, Bill White and Chip
Hutchins.

Murdock said he has a few pro-
spects for replacements for
Stickley and Smith but that
nothing is definite yet.

Meanwhile, the Generals’
lacrosse team enjoyed unseason-
ably warm weather as_ they
prepared for the upcoming season
by staying at home in Lexington.
Ironically, head coach Dennis Da-
ly said that the warm Florida sun-
shine was one of the reasons why
he felt it would be better to stay in
town. ‘‘I felt it would be better to
get acclimatized with the weather
around here at the start of the
season,” hesaid.

first real chance to use the new game
plan.

“It is important for us to win this
week,’’ Schoenberg said. ‘The fol-
lowing three weeks are very tough
(at U.N.C. and Maryland and Virgin-
ia at home) and this would be a nice
game towin.”

The schedule is a tough one and Da-
ly sees no easy contests. ‘‘The beauty
of our schedule is that we will be
challenged in every game. There are
no automatic wins or losses. If we
play to the best of our ability, we will
beinevery contest.”

The men who could make the dif-
ferences during the season are the at-
tackmen: senior Rod Santomassimo
(22 goals and 14 assists a year ago),
senior Jeff Mason (25 goals, five
assists) and Sandy Brown (11 goals,
four assists). Along with Schoenberg,
these three should provide the prime
scoring punch for W&L. Schoenberg
will look to get things started off right
in the faceoff circle. He won 67 per-
cent of his 296 chances last year

Defensively, the Generals return
with strength in goal with senior John
DiDuro and sophomore John Church
expected to see action. In front, the
W&L defensive line will feature let-
termen senior Marshall Bowden, jun-

ior Chris John and sophomore Bob
Berlin.

Right now, the team is observing
cautious optimism as Daly likes to
term it. And the players and staff
show no signs of losing that caution.
They insist they will take the season
one game at a time and hope for good
support from their fans.

‘‘We just hope the students get out
and come to our games. The schedule
allows for some very exciting com-
petition. Along with supporting us,
students should support all of the spr-
ing sports because of the work that
goes into preparing the teams,”’ Daly
said.

Daly mentioned that the team is
further along this year than last
year’s at this time. He also said this
team is ready to play and looks to a
very exciting season.

Very noticeable in Daly’s office is a
large poster that reads, ‘“‘One man
can make a difference and every
man should try.”’ And that seems to
be exactly where the 1985 lacrosse
team stands.

“The bottom line,’’ Daly said, ‘‘is
that we will have to play together. No
one individual is going to be the dif-

. ference between winning and losing.

We must havea total team effort.”

Swimmers end season,
prepare for nationals

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team brought its regular
season to an end this past week with
two impressive tournament perfor-
mances. They finished second in both
the Tri-State Championships (Feb.
15-17) and the Virginia State Swimm-
ing Championships (Feb, 22-24). This
was the first time the W&L swim-
mers had ever finshed better than
third place in a championship meet
under Coach Page Remillard.

As expected, the members of the
team were very pleased with their
performances and the final outcome
of the 1985 season.

“We didn’t hit a grand slam but we
did very well and everyone is very
happy with the season,”’ Remillard
said.

One of the main goals of last week’s
two championships was to try to
qualify as many swimmers for na-
tionals as possible. Before last week,
only two members of the Generals

had qualified: freshman Eric
Sullivan in the 500-yard and 1,650-
yard freestyle and Tim Stanford in
the 50-and 100-yard freestyle. Follow-
ing the Tri-States and the Virginia
State Championships, the Generals
had raised the number of qualifying
events to 10. Stanford qualified in the
100- and 200-yard butterfly, Bobby
Pearson in the 50-yard freestyle and
the 400- and the 800-yard freestyle
and 400-yard medley relays.

One disappointment was the
elimination of Pearson’s qualifying
time in the 100-yard freestyle due toa
false start.

The team now is down to those
swimmers who reached nationals.
They will compete March 14-16 in
Atlanta. Remillard said in prepara-
tion for nationals, the next three
weeks will be somewhat of a taper,
but hard work will continue. For the
rest of the team, it is a well-deserved
break after working out for — in
many cases — mucn Ot the last six
months.

A bedraggled
non sequitur

...S0 Bob(by) Knight is throwing
chairs, now. And then apologizing
for the act. Hey, really, it’s okay,
Bob, if you overreact occasionally.

Frankly, my first reaction to the
whole bit was laughter. It was a good
show, and perhaps the quickest
three technicals called on record.
But seriously, I don’t think it’s such
a bad thing to get frustrated every now and then. John McEnroe does

it, doesn’t he?

But then Bob apologized for the whole thing. (That’s probably the
difference between Bob and McBrat.) Still in all, Knight’s action was
understandable. The Big Ten is presently mulling the event over, and
will shortly give Knight some sort of punishment, or not.

And let us go back to “understandable.’’ With Knight’s outburst, one
is quickly reminded of another Big Ten boss who was noted for similar
escapades and lost his job because of one particular incident. Is
Knight’s action along those same lines?

I think you have to say ‘‘no,”’ just as I hope Indiana and the Big Ten
will. But then you have to say ‘‘yes,”’ also. No, Bob Knight need not be
asked to leave coaching, and yes, chair throwing should be recognized

as inappropriate court etiquette.

Jud Heathcote, yes, a Knight advocate, probably put it best when he
said, ‘‘This game makes fools of us all.’’ And Knight admitted there
has been a great deal of mental strain for himself, seeing as his
Hoosiers were picked to finish fourth by the preseason polls.

The ultimate conclusion to this bedraggled non sequitur we like to
call a column is that Knight is a winner. Winners deserve to stay
around, Dean Smith once said of Knight that he gets good players, he
wins and he doesn’t cheat. So true. As far as I’m concerned, Knight
can get as mad as he likes. He’s still a winner and a great coach.
Something tells me, though, it’s a lot easier to be effective watching
from the bench than from the locker room...

.... Turning to the Colonnade in this winter sport-spring sport transi-
tion week, the big news — other than proposed FD dates — is the start
of lacrosse this Saturday at home against Duke. With a schedule that
is challenging — in as strong a sense of that word as you can muster —
Coach Dennis Daly’s troops have their collective backs against the
wall to prove that they are worthy of Division I competition. No predic-
tions here, but I’m willing to be made the fool for last May’s column...

....Well, the USFL thrice over is underway and boy, isn’t it ex-
citing?! And gee, how many of us actually watched through the
Generals-Stallions clash until Doug Flutie completed his first pass...to
somebody on his own team? Frankly, the little man may be burned out
with football. One other USFL note: The move to the fall may be the
best thing for the league and fans. Take that for what it’s worth....

....What’s the story with all these salary abitration sagas in
baseball? I can understand Tim Raines perhaps asking for a bit more,
but his getting $1.2 million is silly. The story from Boston — reserve
first baseman Dave Stapleton playing contract games with a $325,000-
a-year salary — well, that’s just out of line. I think it’s time for a
salary ceiling in professional sports just to bring things under control.
Go ahead and keep the incentives, but these six-figure deals for
nobodies indicates to me that the idea of paying people what they’re .
worth has gone all the way out the window...

...Finally, and then there’s the story of Jersey cage prep star who’s
averaging 49.3 points a game. That’s not bad, when you’re coming
from a school that has only 13 boys in grades 10-12, but then that may
be the reason you’re scoring so much...

“Of course, we were lucky,’’ he
said. ‘“‘The weather might not
have been accommodating to us
atall.”

The main reason for not going to
Florida, Daly said, was the falling
of the season opener on March 2,
only a week after vacation. ‘‘I felt
it was essential for us to play
against Division I competition
before we went into the season,
and there just aren’t any teams in
the far South that are at our
level.”’

By staying home, the Generals
were able to scrimmage against

Navy and the Mount Washington
club team in Baltimore.

“We were able to find out not on-
ly our strengths, but our weak-
nesses, something that we can’t
always doin Florida,” Daly said.

In addition to making great im-
provements, Daly said, the team
also managed to gain the unity
that a group trip can create. This
goal was accomplished by having
the team live in the 200-level
“tombs’’ in the Warner Center
throughout the week.

Daly said the Florida trip might
be revived in the future, but that
he had some reservations. ‘‘Too
often, a trip becomes the focus of
a season and not the means to an
end,” he said.

“We had a final team meeting and
when it was done, the guys who didn’t
make nationals left. They should
have been psyched to be finished, but
they seemed somewhat upset,’’ Rem-
illard said.

‘Mentally, they should be lying on
the Riviera, but hopefully their using
this time as an academic recovery
period.”’

“It didn’t feel too good to walk out
of the locker room,’’ said freshman
Craig Garneau. ‘‘I wish things could
be different and I was joining them at
nationals but I am certainly pleased
with the season and the experi-
ences.”

For those swimmers who had to
leave the locker room and clean out
their lockers, they have little reason
to hang their heads, though. They
helped W&L to its best swimming
season since 1977-78. More impor-
tantly to Remillard, they reached all
of his preseason goals. They con-
tributed to the 7-1-1 record that has
the team ranked seventh in the na-
tion. Each member of the team
helped upset Johns Hopkins, No. 4 in
the nation at the time.

But the vacation hasn’t started yet
for those swimmers qualifying for
nationals. Remillard has high hopes
with the championships just three
weeks away.

“We'll be happy if we make the top
15, but we should be in the top 12,” he
said. ‘It has been an enjoyable
season, but it’s not over yet.”

Coach Gary Franke and his
Washington and Lee tennis team be-
gin their quest tomorrow for a spot in
the NCAA Division III national
championships. It is the beginning of
a long journey that includes a trip to
Florida, a journey that Franke hopes
will lead the team back to Lexington,
where the championships are to be
held in May.

But before they reach the cham-
pionships, the Generals have a tough
schedule to go through, beginning
tomorrow against Division I foe Penn
State. As is the case against any Divi-
sion I squad. Franke said, the team
will need to play extremely well to
win. Franke believes that by playing
such teams, the Generals will show
overall improvement and as a result
have greater success in Division III.

And that success is something that
this year’s group could certainly be
headed for. In addition to returning

Not only are the first years there in

are a group with some talent as in-
dicated by the preseason Inter-
collegiate Tennis Coaches’ Associa-
tion poll. The ITCA rankings have
freshmen Jack Messerly and David
McLeod — the top two seeds on the
team — ranked 12th and 23rd respec-
tively. As a doubles team, Messerly-
McLeod was ranked sixth, and the
team, with the top 30 ranking of Mize,
is rated 13th by the preseason poll.

During the spring break, the team
will take its annual trip to Florida,
where opponents will include the
always strong Rollins and Stetson
teams. After the trip, the team will
be faced with what will likely be a
crucial match — in terms of a na-

Mr. FD takes a stroll through the SAB Mink Dynasty

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Supplement Editor

 

Once again, it is time for Mr.
FD and his date to take a stroll
through the Warner Center and
Doremus Gymnasium to gaze in
awe at the Spectacle provided
them by the Student Activities
Board with a re-creation of
China right here in Lexington for
the 78th Fancy Dress Ball, ‘The
Mink Dynasty.”

As has become customary,
Mr. FD will be guided to Warner
Center on March 8 by giant sear-
chlights that can be seen
throughout the southern Shenan-
doah Valley. As he approaches
the entrance, he will move along
a garden walkway lighted by
candle-bags.

The stairs leading up to the en-
trance of the Warner Center will
be covered by a red carpet and
the whole area will give Mr. FD
the feeling of being in the midst
of an orchard of cherry blossom
trees.

As Mr. FD escorts his date up
the stairs, he will no doubt notice
the large Chinese gong on his
right. From there, he moves
through the large gateway en-
trance and into the garden area.

Once inside, Mr. FD will feel
as if he has stepped right into a
lush Chinese garden. On his
right, he will see a goldfish pond
with floating lily pads. A small
bridge will go over the pond,
which will be surrounded by a
bamboo fence.

To his left, he will notice that

the athletic trophy showcase has
been replaced with several co-
lorful exotic birds.

As Mr. FD moves further on,
he will no doubt first choose to
enter Warner Center. The War-
ner Center will be decorated in a
mood that brings thoughts of old,
dynastic China.

Blue, white, gold and red ban-
ners with calligraphy drawn on
them will drape the ceiling. On
both sides of the room, a large
dragon mural will adorn the
walls.

Scattered about the room will
be a number of tables where Mr.
FD can rest as the night wears
on. These tables will be decor-
ated with bright Chinese floral
arrangements.

Performing in the Warner
Center Friday night will be the
Count Basie Orchestra. Over the
bandstand will be a large pagoda
that reaches toward the ceiling.

When the orchestra is taking
breaks, Mr. FD will be enter-
tained by a Chinese dance troupe
performing traditional Chinese
dances such as the ribbon dance.

When Mr. FD turns away from
the bandstand and looks to the
balcony area, he will see that
this area has been made to re-

.semble the Great Wall of China.

From the 400 level of the War-
ner Center, Mr. FD can climb up
the stairs of the Great Wall to
reach the 500 level balcony area.
Here, he will see more tables
and on the walls there will be
patterns of Chinese fans that
range in size from small, hand-

Moving around the balcony
area will be small acts entertain-
ing all the happy (we hope) FD-
goers. These acts could range
from fortune tellers to jugglers
to a lady on roller skates with a
boa constrictor.

Leaving the balcony area and
returning downstairs, Mr. FD’s
next stop will be the 400 level of
Doremus Gym. Doremus will be
decorated to give the feel of a
Chinese New Year.

The upper balcony will be co-
vered with cherry blossom
branches, and Chinese lanterns
will be strung across the ceiling.
Along the walls of the gym will
be decorated scrolls, and plans
are to have symbols for the var-
ious Chinese New Years adorn-
ing the area in between.

The entertainment in Dore-
mus Gym will be provided by
“A” Train and Otis Day and the
Knights. Mr. FD was a little dis-
couraged when he discovered
there would be no mantle to dive
from, but he realized that some
order must be kept to ensure
that all the FD-goers get the
most out of their Mink Dynasty
experience.

Tickets for the 78th Fancy
Dress Ball go on sale Monday at
a cost of $30 a couple. Fancy
Dress memorabilia also can be
purchased at the same time.

And don’t forget — if Mr. FD
wants to get an early start on his
Fancy Dress weekend, he can go
to the student activities pavilion
the Thursday before Fancy
Dress for a concert with Wild
Kingdom and the Four Tops.
Tickets for this show also go on
sale Monday and are $6.

The Bid

For some, season began in December

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

It was no coincidence that
Mary Baldwin College threw an
expensive party with Liquid
Pleasure Tuesday night. The
party’s purpose? The Bid.

It’s every Washington and Lee
man’s most powerful bargaining
tool. But only those fortunates
who have yet to succumb to
hometown pressure can legiti-
mately play the exciting ‘“‘I-
don’t-have-a-Fancy-Dress-date”’
game. Time is running out, how-
ever

‘“The closer you get to FD, the
better looking the girls get until
this weekend. If they haven’t
gotten The Bid by this weekend,
they have probably given up,”
senior Gray Sanders said.

Women who have never been
on campus before and may
never be here again until next
February are showing up.
Everywhere. The parties are
packed; there are special road
trips to Graham-Lees; even the
library is full of scheming
women. No place is sacred.

Yet these women don’t realize
that the only W&L students who
can study this close to The Ball
have already extended The Bid.
Even the students without dates
are starting to sweat. Margie
Copson, a sophomore from
Hollins College, agrees.

“It seems late in The Sea-
son...girls I know were looking
as early as January. If I didn’t
have a date by now, I would have
probably given up,”’ she said.

Yet Copson also said she
thinks that women are not exact-
ly “hunting” for a date at W&L
parties, but rather primarily
just having fun. A Sweet Briar
College senior who asked not to
be identified echoed a similar
idea.

‘The way to get a date is to go
over and have fun as often as you
can but not try too hard. Guys
usually see that pretty well,’’ she
said.

“You have to start being ‘seen’
early — as early as December,”
she continued. ‘But guys get
really cocky and they at least as-
sume that girls are all out for the

same thing — an FD bid.”

She added that the pre-F'D par-
ties have ‘‘every girl within a 50-
mile radius. The only difference
in the parties is the competitive-
ness and the tension between the
girls. They guys just sit back and
become spectators for the girls
who are trying to get a date.”

WA&L junior Bill Hanna agrees.
“T would say the guys would be a
little more cocky because they
think the girls are there just to
get an FD date.”

Blair Eddy, a freshman at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege agreed that W&L students
have the upper hand for now, but
not for much longer.

“Yes, girls here are still look-
ing for dates this week. I think it
would be a little rude to ask one
next week, though,”’ Eddy said.
“But I think first of all the girls
are there to have a good time
and second of all to get a date.
It’s no big deal for the girls who
don’t get dates.’’

Kerri Castigan, a junior at
Mary Baldwin, went one step
further.

“I know a couple of girls who
have turned down FD dates be-
cause they wanted to go to Flor-
ida for spring break. I think
freshmen are more apt to look
for dates but I don’t think it’s a
big deal. Once you go, I don’t

think you feel that it is as big to
miss another one.’’ Castigan
said she also is impressed by the
increased courtesy shown by
W&L men at this time of year.

“IT think the guys are much
more polite and outgoing,’’ she
said, ‘‘because they are looking
for a date and they don’t want to
miss out.”

Freshman Brandt Wood
agrees that a lot of maneuvering
is going on.

‘A lot of guys are withholding
the coveted bid until late. But I
would imagine that everybody
would like to have given The Bid
out by now to avoid the pre-FD
panic that is setting in,’ Wood
said.

The mind games are every-
where. Signs for parties that are
taken to the women’s colleges
still display, ‘FD dates
available.”’ Guys at the parties
will even walk around with these
signs on their backs. But this
late in the game, it’s like reach-
ing into the Kentucky Fried
Chicken basket for some white
meat after your seven older
brothers have grabbed their
pieces.

‘A’ Train: Louisiana’s hottest

The music of ‘‘A’’ Train, Loui-
siana’s premier band, has been
aired on nearly 100 radio stations
in 25 states as the six-member
group prepares for its appear-
ance in Doremus Gymnasium
during next Friday’s Fancy
Dress Ball.

“A” Train recently released
their second single, ‘‘Pass it on

“If you are looking for music

90 students, faculty
taking dance class

 

By TIM RICHARDSON

 

Staff Reporter
British essayist Alexander
Pope once said, ‘They move

easiest who learn to dance.”’

For about 90 Washington and
Lee undergraduates, law
students and faculty members,
Pope’s statement is being pro-
ven true, thanks to ballroom
dance lessons taught by Frank
Roupas, a Roanoke dance in-
structor.

During the past six weeks, on
Wednesday nights, Roupas has
instructed his pupils in the basic
steps of the jitterbug, waltz,
tango, rhumba, cha-cha and fox-
trot. He hopes to have them
ready in time for the Fancy
Dress Ball on March 8.

“If you can walk, you can
dance. In 29 years of teaching,
I’ve never had a failure. I work
with each student,’’ Roupas
said.

Roupas, 45, said most of his
students at W&L take the class
to prepare for Fancy Dress, but
quickly added that his classes
are useful later in life.

“You aren’t going to disco ata
governor’s ball,”’ he said.

Lesley Conradi, a third-year
law student taking Roupas’ class
for the second time, agreed.
“It’s a social skill that helps
later in life,’’ she said.

W&L art history Professor
Gerard M. Doyon said it is never
too late to learn how to dance.
Doyon, who is several years old-

er than the other students in the
class, said, ‘‘I went to an all-
boys’ high school, an all-boys’
college and then joined the Ar-
my. I never had a chance to
learn to dance until now.”’

This is Roupas’ second year of
teaching classes at W&L. Be-
sides W&L, he teaches at the
University of Virginia, where he
has 400 students, the Greenbrier
Hotel, several community cen-
ters and churches and private
homes.

“I’m the only dance instructor
who makes house calls,’’ he said

Roupas’ students appear to en-
joy his classes. Part of the rea-
son is the enthusiasm and en-
couragement that he brings to
the classes. Throughout the
class, he is clapping, singing and
dancing.

‘“‘Wasn’t that wonderful,’’ he
says in a Lawrence Welkian ac-
cent after watching his students
demonstrate their skills

At first glance, Roupas does
not fit the image of a good dan-
cer. He is tall, about 6 feet, 3 in-
ches, and appears almost awk-
ward. But when the music
starts, he gracefully glides
across the floor in perfect time.

His expertise has led to two
television appearances, one on
the ‘‘Lawrence Welk Show,”’ the
other at a New Year’s Eve party
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in
New York City.

When asked why he teaches,
he replied, ‘‘Ballroom dancing
makes people happy, and I like
to see people happy.”’

The Count’s music lives

When Count Basie was honor-
ed at the 4th Annual Kennedy
Center Special Awards Ceremo-
ny in Washington, D.C., in 1981,
he was introduced by another
jazz great, Henry Mancini.

‘“‘No one and no one band has
contributed more to American
music than Count Basie,” Man-
cini said.

And, indeed, his assessment of
the man who dominated the jazz
band scene for almost 50 years
may be correct.

Although the Count Basie Or-
chestra that plays in the Warner
Center next Friday night as the
main band of the Fancy Dress
Bal! will be without its name-
sake leader, who died last April,
the band and Count Basie’s
music live on.

William Basie, an only child,
was born Aug. 21, 1904, in Red
Bank, N.J. His first musical
training came from his mother
and a ‘‘wonderful German lady
named Holloway” who gave him
piano lessons and charged 25
cents a session.

Basie’s first instrument choice
was drums. But Sonny Greer, a
boyhood friend, made Bill move
elsewhere after some early com-
petition.

Basie played the Harlem clubs
in the early 1920s. ‘‘Piano’’ was
the instrument of the day, and
the most important influence of
Bill’s playing style was Thomas
“‘Fats’’ Waller — infallible touch
and strong harmonic sense.

The Count then toured the fa-
mous T.O.B.A. ‘‘wheel,’’ the ma-
jor vaudeville circuit for black
entertainers. Stranded once in
Kansas City, he signed up with
the Walter Page Blue Devils.
Shortly thereafter, ‘several
members of the band joined the
Bennie Moten Orchestra.

When Bennie died in 1935, Ba-
sie took over as the leader.

The Count Basie Orchestra
was born when John Hammond

heard them on the radio, got Wil-
lard Alexander interested, influ-
enced Basie to add to his nine-
piece band and, in 1936, brought
them to New York. Then it was
one peak piled on another. From
high-spot to higher-spot to great-
er achievement.

Basie was one of five honored
at the Kennedy Awards, along
with Cary Grant, Helen Hayes,
Jerome Robbins and Rudolf
Serkin.

Count Basie played on — in
concerts, at dances and special
events on TV specials and an-
nual tours to Europe and Japan
and frequent jaunts to other far-
away places. Bill and his band
grew more popular than ever
before, year after year.

“Retire?’’ Basie would repeat
with disdain when the question
was raised, as if the word and its
meaning were strangers to his
life.

William James ‘‘Count”’ Ba-
sie died April 26, 1984. The last
sentence of the obituary read:
“Your melodies will linger in our
hearts forever.”

Freddie Green, who was so
much a part of the Basie magic
almost since its beginnings,
spoke glowingly and prophetic-
ally, a few years ago, about the
Count and the way, musically,
he prepared an entrance at the
end of his solos for the next man:
“He leaves the way open.”
Count Basie left the way open for
the Count Basie Orchestra.

From rude to extravagant:
planning a $65,000 ball

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

“It’s amazing to me that we do
all this for a four-hour ball,”’ said
Dain Dulaney, chairman of the
Student Activities Board’s Fan-
cy Dress Ball committee. He
was sitting among the rude be-
ginnings of the soon-to-be extra-
vagant decorations for the 78th
Fancy Dress Ball, the theme of
which is ‘‘The Mink Dynasty.”

Dulaney wasn’t speaking only
of the Oriental screens hand-
painted and decorated with dra-
gons, or of the other decorations
the SAB is assembling in the stu-
dent activities pavilion. He was
talking about a six-month opera-
tion that will have cost about
$65,000 and involved 60 SAB
members as well as many mem-
bers of the Lexington communi-
ty by the time the festivities
come to a close one week from
tomorrow night.

The Theme
The planning for Fancy Dress
begins in the fall when the SAB
directors start kicking around

ideas for the theme of the ball.
One of the first steps is to check
a list of themes from the past
balls, and try to come up with a
related concept or an offshoot of
an old theme.

‘‘Most of the themes have been
done in some form or variation
in the past. This year’s theme,
I’m not real sure it’s ever been
done before. It’ll be a new and
hopefully real colorful theme,
something that will be kind of
exciting,’’ Dulaney said.

From these lists, the directors
come up with a broad-based idea
which, Dulaney said, have been
“clever, or ‘a visit to: ,’ or some-
thing like that.”’

This year’s theme started as a
Oriental idea and evolved into
“The Mink Dynasty.’’ Last
year’s theme began as thoughts
about South America and be-
came the “‘Lost Cities of Gold.”’

Although ‘‘everybody has in-
put’’ into the decision on the
theme, Dulaney said it is the
Fancy Dress chairman, the SAB
chairman, the board’s executive
director and a couple of other
people who finally decide what

the theme will be. With 60 mem-
bers-at-large on the board, Dula-
ney said that this procedure has
proven to be the easiest and he
added that nearly everybody is
happy with the end result.

The directors brainstorm and
discuss and narrow their ideas
down until they arrive at a
theme. This is usually done by
the beginning of January, and
this is when the rumors and
speculation begin. When the
theme is chosen, only the direc-
tors know what it is. The rest of
the SAB is kept as much in the
dark as the rest of the Washing-
ton and Lee community until
just before the ball.

Dulaney worked this year with
the Fancy Dress committee,
something new this year, which
was part of the general reorgan-
ization of the SAB. The commit-
tee was told a week or so ago
about the theme, and the rest of
the SAB was let in on the secret
at Tuesday night’s board meet-
ing.

There is good reason for keep-
ing the theme secret, Dulaney
said. It revolves around the
SAB’s sale of Fancy Dress me-
morabilia. The T-shirts, posters
and cups that the board sells
make a good deal of money, Du-
laney said, and that helps keep
the cost of Fancy Dress within
reason. If the SAB can keep the
theme under wraps, it can main-
tain exclusive sale of the
memorabilia and use that
money to defray the operating
expenses of the ball. Keeping the
ticket price down for the stu-
dents is one of the main concerns
the SAB has in its Fancy Dress
planning.

There have been instances in
which other people have produc-
ed Fancy Dress items. ‘“‘We’ve
had problems in the past with
people turning stuff out. We run
into problems with that because
we copyright what we do — the
theme basically. We don’t want
to prosecute anybody.”’

SAB executive director Mike Guerriero gives instructions to SAB
members on how the decorations should be put together.

The Bands

The other major decision the
SAB must make for Fancy Dress
is the choice of entertainment.
The first and most important
part of the entertainment that
must be taken care of is the big
band. Dulaney said there is an
incredible demand right now for
orchestras because there aren’t
new big bands starting up any-
more. Since the orchestra is a
crucial part of the ball, the SAB
lines one up early in the year.
The Count Basie Orchestra was
booked in October for this year’s
ball.

The rock and roll bands are
booked later because there are
more variables regarding their
performance. Concert tours,
band break-ups and competitive
bidding with other organizations
all are among the factors that
must be considered.

Charged with this responsibili-
ty are SAB entertainment co-
chairmen John Haywood and
John Crawford. The rock bands
are contacted sometime in Feb-

ruary and the SAB tries to match
schedules with some of them.
The SAB then bids for a large
number of bands and chooses
one that will fit its budget.

“The way things worked out
this year, we got some real good
deals,” Dulaney said.

The Decorations

Also to be considered in pre-
parations for the ball are the de-
corations that will transform
Warner Center into the Far
East. ‘‘We try to construct and
design most of our stuff from
materials we can make, because
it usually costs less,’’ Dulaney
said. The procedure for decorat-
ing for the ball operates in much
the same way as does the theme
decision. A broad conception of
how the decorations will look is
the first step, From here, SAB
members begin to look for decor-
ations for the ball. This year,
Dulaney said, SAB executive
director Michael Guerriero went
to New York City to look for
decorations and things have
been ordered from Houston and
from all over Virginia.

At that point, when the decora-
tions and theme are determined,
the real work begins for the rest
of SAB. Most of the board, the
members-at-large, do not partic-
ipate in the decision-making but
play a big role in the implemen-
tation of the decision. What this
means is that they spend three
hours a day at the pavilion con-
structing decorations and doing
everything necessary to put on
the ball.

There are certain rewards for
this work. Each SAB member
receives free tickets to the ball,
a free T-shirt and a free poster.

Especially helpful in all the
preparations, Dulaney noted,
are the people of Lexington.
They show great interest, he
added, and their help in getting
the materials together is essen-
tial and something the SAB is
grateful for.

The announcement of this
year’s Fancy Dress theme ends
the months of secrecy that have
surrounded the event for almost
as long as there has been a Fan-
cy Dress.

Student Activities Board En-
tertainment Chairman John
Haywood said the theme used to
be revealed muci: earlier since
Fancy Dress was originally a
costume ball and people needed
time to get their costumes
ready.

Haywood said that in the 1960s
the event became a more for-
mal, black-tie event.

He said that the curtain of
secrecy is kept over the Fancy
Dress theme for two reasons.

One is that the SAB tries to
build as much “hype’’ around
the event as possible. ‘The ele-
ment of secrecy adds glamour to
the event,”’ Haywood said.

Haywood added that it is very
important that people continue
to want to go to Fancy Dress and
the element of secrecy helps add
to the promotion of the event.

The second reason for theme
secrecy at Fancy Dress is more
of a practical one, but is none the
less very important, he explain-
ed

The theme of Fancy Dress is
kept secret until the very last
moment in an effort to make it
more difficult for those people
who wish to market “‘unauthor-
ized’’ Fancy Dress memorabi-
lia.

While at first that may seem to
bea stab at the system of capita-
lism many Americans hold very
dear to their heart, Haywood

said that bootleg FD memorabil-
ia has a direct effect on ticket
prices.

‘When we make $5 on the sale
of a T-shirt, it goes to keeping
the price of FD tickets down,”’
Haywood said. ‘‘When some
other guy makes $5, it just goes
into his pocket.”’

The budget for Fancy Dress is
nearly $65,000, Haywood said,
and that money comes from stu-
dent funds and from ticket and
memorabilia sales.

“We have to get the money
from somewhere,’’ Haywood
said. “If we don’t make it on
sales of memorabilia then we
have to increase the ticket
prices.”

Haywood said that bootleg FD
memorabilia, if left unchecked,
could increase the ticket prices
anywhere from $5 to $7.

While most people are content
to wait patiently in suspense for
the announcement of the Fancy
Dress theme, there are occas-
sions where individuals try to
find out before the SAB decides
to make the theme public.

Such was the case last year.
Rick Swagler, co-editor of The
Ring-tum Phi, had a friendly bet
with Haywood that he could find
out what the theme was going to
be. Swagler said he would not
print the theme before the SAB
decided to release it if Haywood
would tell Swagler if he guessed
the theme correctly.

' Swagler toyed with different
ideas about how to find out the
exact wording of the theme and
finally hit upon an idea that
worked. Upon learning the name
and location of the plastics com-
pany that was printing the FD
grain cups, Swagler went to
work,

Swagler called the company
and identified himself as a stu-
dent from Washington and Lee
University. He said he needed to
check the wording on the cup.
They read it off and Swagler re-
plied, ‘“Yep, sounds good to me.”’

Soon after that, Haywood re-
ceived a “‘panicked”’ call from
the plastics company, which was
not about to print thousands of
cups with a questionable theme
on them. They then proceeded to
Federal Express a cup down to
Haywood so he could double-
check the wording on the cup to
make sure it was all right.

Haywood said that everything

Girard is arrested
on cocaine charge

From Staff Reports

 

Senior Gene Girard was arrested
Friday afternoon on charges of pos-
session of cocaine with intent to
distribute it, authorities said.

Sergeant R.W. Hall of the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff's Department
said Girard was arrested at the East
Lexington grocery store with one
ounce of cocaine that had been sent
from Miami via Federal Express, the
overnight package delivery service.

Girard was co-captain of the Wash-
ington and Lee football team last fall,
and was the squad’s leading rusher
for the last two seasons. As a junior,
he was an all-conference running
back.

Girard said he plans to plead not
guilty. “I don’t even know what
they’re charging me with, really,” he
said. ‘‘What they have is not right.”’

He said his attorney, Lexington
lawyer Larry Mann, had advised him
not tocomment further. Mann declin-
ed comment on the case.

A preliminary hearing has been set
for April 19. The charge carries a
possible sentence of five to 40 years

 

 

Cadet testimony banned from drug trial

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

The classmates of a former
Virginia Military Institute cadet will
not be allowed to testify at his drug-
dealing trial, a Circuit Court judge
ruled Tuesday.

An attorney-client relationship
that existed between Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John”’
Read and the cadet, Jeffrey R. Pack,
tainted evidence in the case, Judge
Rudolph Bumgardner III said.

Pack, 25, was indicted Sept. 4 on six
counts of selling psilocybin, the
hallucinogen known as ‘mush-
rooms.’’ He was realeased on a
$20,000 property bond. He left VMI
without graduating and now lives in
Springfield.

From Staff Reports

 

 

While Washington and Lee
students make final preparations this
week for Fancy Dress, their tuxedo
rentals, corsage purchases and din-
ner reservations are a great source
of income to Lexington and the sur-
rounding areas.

Many Lexington merchants inter-
viewed this week agree that Fancy
Dress is one of the biggest — if not
the biggest — weekends for business.

“Fancy Dress is our busiest time of
the year,” said Mary Brads, mana-
ger of the Stop In Food Store Inc. in
Lexington,

Traditionally, stores that rent or
sell tuxedos are especially busy in
the weeks preceding Fancy Dress.

“It is our busiest week of the
year,’’ said Townsend Fox, owner of
University Cleaners.

“This is big. It’s one of the biggest
weeks of the year,” said Alvin
Carter, owner of Alvin-Dennis.
“‘We’re real busy right now, so it’s
still growing.”

The College Town Shop will rent
about as many tuxedos this year as it

Special prosecutor H. Albert Nance
Jr. informed the court last week that
he intends to prosecute only two of
the counts at this time, and said he
would request that those charges be
reduced from sale to possession of
psilocybin. He said after the hearing
that the ruling does not apply to-the
other counts, which can be tried
later.

Nance last month requested su-
poenas for 10 present and former
VMI cadets. The jury trial was set for
Friday but now has been postponed
so both sides can review the judge’s
ruling.

Nance, Henrico County Common-
wealth’s Attorney, was named
special prosecutor in the case
because it was expected that Read
would be a witness at the pretrial
hearing.

Read was not called to testify,
although Pack’s attorneys had re-
quested a summons for him and
Nance was expected to call him.

“I’m extremely upset and disap-
pointed,’’ said Read, who was in the
courtroom before and after the hear-
ing. “I was prepared to take the
stand.”

At one point, Nance called ‘John
Beverly Read,’ but immediately
changed and instead called former
special grand jury foreman Samuel
H. Blackburn.

“T thought I could shorten it to
some degree by calling Mr. Black-
burn,’ Nance said later. ‘‘His
testimony was right to the heart of
the motion: ‘Everything we knew
about Pack we got from somewhere
else.’ ”’

“Mr. Read is not going to take the

stand and I think you can draw an un-
favorable inference from that,”
defense attorney Albert J. Ahern Jr.
told the judge.

Pack testified that he met with
Read in October 1983 after being ac-
cused of an honor violation at VMI.
Pack said Read offered to defend him
for a retainer fee of $2,500.

“IT could probably get you off on
this,’’ Pack quoted Read as saying.
By mutual agreement, Pack later
sought other counsel.

He testified that in the meeting
with Read he had confessed that he
“had used marijuana and mush-
rooms,”’ but that he was no longer us-
ing the drugs. He said Read then ask-
ed him a wide range of questions
about the use of narcotics at VMI.

“J told him I wasn’t there to

in jail and a fine of as much as
$25,000.

Girard was held in Rockbridge
County Jail for five hours until a
$30,000 property bond could be ar-
ranged with a Lexington bondsman,

Under the terms of the bail,
Girard, who is from Coral Gables,
Fla. may not leave Virginia without
court permission,

The sheriff’s department made the
arrest acting on a tip received by the
Lexington Police Department, Hall
said. Lexington Police Sergeant E.
Wayne Straub accompanied Hall on
the arrest.

“We received information from an
informant that this package was
coming through,” Hall said. ‘“‘Two
drug dogs alerted on the package. To
us there was no doubt in our mind co-
caine was in that package.”

He said the cocaine appeared to be
uncut, and would therefore be worth
about $6,000. ‘‘It stuck tightly like it
was pretty pure,” he said. He said
that if it had been cut — mixed with
other substances — it would be worth
about $3,000.

The seized substance has been sent
toa laboratory for testing.

Hall said the package was address-
ed to a fictitious name — ‘‘William
Babe Ruth” — at Girard’s Lexington
address. He said Girard had arrang-
ed to pick up the package at East
Lexington market.

Hall said the package bore a ficti-
tious Miami return address. He said
the name on the return address was
“officer something.”

He declined to say whether ‘he ‘n
formant was in Lexington or Miami,

Girard said he was dropped off at
the store by another student but was
by himself at the time of the arrest.

Additional charges may be filed in
the case either in Lexington or
Miami, but likely not against Girard,
according to Hall. He said the Feder-
al Bureau of Investigation is ex-
pected to investigate the Miami
aspect of the case.

Hall said that in the past other
Washington and Lee students have
used Federal Express to receive con-

did last year, according to Martha
Derrick, owner. The store had rented
20 on Monday alone by 1 p.m. and
probably will have about 200 rentals
for Fancy Dress. Carter and Fox de-
clined to say how many tuxedos they
would rent for the weekend.

Although the date of Fancy Dress
has been known since the fall, a few
students will always wait until the
last minute to make plans, mer-
chants said, but they usually can be
accommodated.

‘‘We do have people who straggle
in and are desperate for tuxedos,”’
said University Cleaner’s Fox. ‘I’ve
rented mine out.”’

Derrick said she sometimes runs
into a different problem at College
Town Shop.

“Lots of times,” she said, ‘‘the in-
experienced people have some wild
notion that [the tuxedo’s] going to be
sewn up for them,” because they
are measured so precisely and their

OPINION

Page 2
March 7, 1985

 

Vote:

Every one counts

This Monday, every student has a very important privilege
and right to exercise. It is called voting.

Perhaps we are tired of hearing how important it is to vote.
After all, does ‘‘my’’ vote really count? Of course it does, and
this year, it is especially important to remember that voting

is of the essence.

Last year, a referendum calling for the addition of a third
Law School representative failed because less than 50 per-
cent of the student body voted. According to the Student Body
Constitution, a three-day period is required for students to
vote on proposed changes. Next Monday, Tuesday and Wed-
nesday, we ought to vote for the additional representative.

An additional law student would add expertise in open
trials, improve representation of the Law School and begin to
break down that invisible yet very present ‘Woods Creek’’
barrier between the two campuses. More importantly, an
additional representative would help to revive the impor-
tance of the Honor System at the Law School. In the past, the
issue of an additional law rep has been misrepresented as a
question of equal representation. Instead, we must see the
question as not one of the representation but as one of making
the Honor System a viable force on both campuses. Everyone
—undergraduate and law student alike — would benefit from
an expansion of the committee to 13 members.

Next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday gives the student
body a unique opportunity — an opportunity to change its
constitution for the better. Past attempts at constitutional
change have failed because of the 50 percent requirement.
But because the Big Three elections will attract voters,
meeting that minimum should be significantly less difficult

next week.

It is unfortunate, therefore, that no one took the initiative to
propose additional constitutional changes for next week’s
ballot. The student body constitution desperately needs
cleaning up, and next week would have been an opportune

time to doso.

The second, though equally important, issue both campus-
es face is the election of Big Three officers for next year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee. As evidenced by the proliferation of
posters about campus and the sudden interest many upper-
classmen take in the well-being of their peers (ever hear of a
beer party for the opening of tennis season before?), we are
indeed in the midst of a ‘‘Big Three’’ election for the top posi-
tions on the Executive Committee.

Last week, we noted a lack of initiative on this year’s com-
mittee and expressed the hope that for the remainder of this
school year, as well as in future years, greater attention
would be given to the serious issues and responsibilities the

EC does face.

The student body now has the opportunity to show

that it

does not suifer from similar lack of initiative. By voting and
voting intelligently next week, we can alter the numerical
makeup of the EC for the better. Be judging each candidate’s
experience and potential for continued leadership, we can en-
sure a responsible, effective Executive Committee.

Third law rep urged

To the Editors:

I would urge you all to support the
upcoming referendum concerning a
constitutional amendment that pro-
vides for the addition of another law
representative to the Executive Com-
mittee. This representative would
serve dual objectives. Obviously, the
person would represent second-year
law student interests in administra-
tive matters. More importantly,
though the additional representative
would provide an added source of
knowledge in honor related func-
tions,

The added representative would
benefit all students. The EC would
gain additional expertise in the clos-
ed hearings, thereby helping to pre-
vent any student from being denied a
fair hearing. The amendment would

also afford the EC an additional ad-
vocate to choose from in event of an
open hearing.

Finally, the additional representa-
tive would help implement the honor
system in the Law School. Law stu-
dents are more likely to know stu-
dents in their own class and would be
less hesitant in reporting potential
violations to someone they knew.
This would facilitate operation of the
honor system University-wide.

I would be happy to answer any
question concerning this amend-
ment. Please give it thoughtful con-
sideration and hopefully all will
realize this amendment is for the
good of the University. Thank you.

Timing, tidbits improper

To the Editors:

I was very disturbed when I read
the editorial in last week’s Ring-tum
Phi (‘EC: No Comment’). The
cause of my concern was not so much
that I disagreed with the content of
the editorial — I did think that it
made some legitimate points — but
that it was said in the wrong way at
the wrong time. Had the article been
printed in a constructive manner ata
time not so near to the elections it
could have been very effective; in-
stead, it was needlessly and blatantly
destructive.

There was some small uproar last
year when the Phi’s mid-term EC re-
port came out. As last week’s editor-
ial said, ‘‘For some EC members, the
midterm review has — justifiably or
not hurt their re-election
chances.”’ Given this statement and
the headline of the editorial, | made
the (obviously foolish) assumption
that The Phi had decided to act re-
sponsibly and hold their report until
after EC elections when the effect of
potentially biased or sloppy jour-
nalism would be purely academic.
Instead The Phi chose to print an edi-
torial which not only contradicted the
headline of what could have been a
statement of journalistic respon-
sibility, but may, in fact, have been
more harmful than any mid-year re-
port could have been.

The mid-year report would have
listed-the voting and attendance re-

cords of the various members, gener-
ally sticking to facts and (one hopes)
avoiding generalizations. Instead we
were treated to one long general-
ization full of catty comments like
(re: the confidentiality of the Honor
System) ‘‘Just stick around the C-
School library — you're bound to pick
up some juicy tidbits.’’ That’s not
journalism or editorial responsibility
— it sounds instead like the words of
someone with a personal ax to grind
against specific EC members. Thus,
the entire committee is indicted
rather than those individuals who
may, in fact, be irresponsible or be
poor leaders. Does it really serve
anyone to make a statement like
‘Some have taken their duty serious-
ly and have represented their classes
well’’? It informs me of nothing and
only irritates the various members,
each of whom thinks he is one of the
unnamed select.

The Phi’s editorial was counter-
productive, angering many members
of the student body and of the EC
without being in the least bit informa-
tive. A mid-year report in the style of
previous years would have been pre-
ferable to this year's comment-filled
“No Comment.” Best of all would be
if The Phi had just written their
headline and allowed the student
body to make its own evaluation.

Does The Phi lack direction, initiative?

EDITORS’ NOTE: We were faced
this week with the decision of wheth-
er to print the letter of a former
reporter who had recently been dis-
missed from the staff for cause. The
letter contained a number of charges
based on incomplete, distorted infor-
mation, The temptation was either to
not print the letter or to rebut it.
After all, the argument goes, why
Should you allow yourself to be slam-
med in your own newspaper? The
answer is simple: It is not our
newspaper. We are very serious in
our conviction that The Ring-tum Phi
is a forum for all students and not
anyone’s personal fiefdom. The
editors should not always have the
last word. Harsh criticism, even if it
seems unwarranted, may help us do
our job better. Airing dirty laundry in
public is never pleasant, but we
decided that if we can dish it out, we
ought to be able totake it.

To the Editors:

The Feb 28 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi demonstrates once again our
newspaper’s seeming desire to avoid
controversy.

The Phi’s decision not to run a
midterm analysis of individual EC
members because the EC ‘“‘lacks
direction and initiative’ is sheer
hyprocrisy. It reminds me of a recent
Washington Post editorial which call-
ed Ed Meese unethical, but argued
that the members of the Senate
should confirm Meese’s nomination
anyway because of the lack of ethical
standards on Capitol Hill.

Rather than solving the problems
they attempt to address, these
editorials instead heighten them. At
first glance, last week’s editorial
may have appeared strongly, or even
harshly, worded. But how strong is

Alumnus hurt;

refuses to aid
a coed W&L

To the Editors:

I think your readers should know
what one alumnus thinks about
coeducation at W&L:

Alvin T. Fleishman
Class Agent '41-A
Anderson, S.C.

Dear Al,

As expected, your ‘‘Class Agent”’
letter seeking a contribution to the
W&L Alumni Fund was recently re-
ceived.

I have always been a modest but
faithful contributor because my
Washington and Lee experience was
profoundly important to me.

The importance of the Alumni
Fund cannot be denied; and you have
been one of our most successful and
agreeable Class Agents.

It is with genuine regret, Al, that I
decline to respond to your request
this time. I will not contribute now
nor will I ever again contribute in
any way to Washington & Lee Uni-
versity.

I cannot forgive the unnecessary,
unpardonable, unwarranted, unjusti-
fied and unconscionable, perfidious
action by the Board of Trustees with
respect to coeducation at W&L. I
wish that I like General Washington,
General Lee, President Gaines, Dean
Gilliam, et al, had not lived to ex-
perience the shame that suffocates so
many alumni.

My alma mater has most cruelly
scorned, rejected and abandoned me.
The personal hurt is everlasting.

Washington & Lee was a university
that I attended and from which I
graduated a long time ago. It has
ceased to exist.

Sorrowfully,
Allen R. DeLong, '41

slapping the entire EC on the wrist as
compared to singling out individual
members?

“Not every EC member has failed
to measure up,” according to the
editoria]. ‘Some have taken their du-
ty seriously and represented their
classes well.’’

If this is true, why keep us guess-
ing? Why not tell us which represen-
tatives are strong or weak?

The editorial also mentions three
areas that ‘‘the EC has touched on,

* but failed to tackle with the proper

follow-ups.’’ Why didn’t The Phi run
editorials on these issues while they
were issues? Why hasn’t The Phi
taken the. editorial initiative to pro-
vide some added direction for the
EC?

Another issue which The Phi has
failed to follow-up on adequately is
that of blacks at W&L, especially im-
portant because of the announced
dismissal of Dean of Minority Affairs
John White.

On Feb. 17, the first Sunday of the

Washington Holiday, I had a 65-inch
article printed in the Roanoke Times
& World News about the factors at
W&L which make life overly frustra-
ting for blacks. According to one of
The Phi editors, our school news-
paper does not reprint stories from
other papers or let the Roanoke
Times determine what is The Phi’s
news.

This is ridiculous. Even The
Washington Post has _ reprinted
stories from the Roanoke Times. And
if we do not let others determine our
news, why does The Phi print an AP
story about the space shuttle on Nov.
8, 1984, and why has it devoted so
much space to a U.Va. honor trial?
Perhaps these are of interest to W&L
students, but why not print a W&L
story which a number of professors
have termed ‘‘well-done” and ‘‘even
handed’? (I have since had copies

Defense:

MY VIEW
By Jon Zagrodzky

Part 1 of a two-part series

Anyone who is even remotely in-
terested in national policy surely has
given thought to the astronomical in-
creases in defense spending (in both
real and nominal terms) over the last
four years. I think that most would
agree that some sort of improvement
in the armed forces was needed in
1981, and that Reagan has gone a long
way toward achieving this end. Nev-
ertheless, even the staunchest de-
fense spending advocate has to ask
himself, ‘How much is enough?”
and, “‘Will we ever be adequately
defended?”

To answer this question, we must
shift the debate from types of wea-
pons systems and overall defense
spending to what exactly defines our
general defense needs. I perceive
four distinct challenges in this area.
In this column, I shall address the
threat posed by the Soviet Union, and
in the next one I shall discuss threats
posed by other nations, including
conventional and economic warfare
as well as terrorism.

The first, the most obvious and the
most dangerous threat is that posed
by the USSR. Our current policy is to
spend in excess of $100 billion a year
defending Europe, Japan and the
Pacific from Soviet conventional or
nuclear attack, the latter of which is
being adequately met. But are we de-
fending the U.S. by spending this
money? The answer is no. In fact, the
majority of our defense budget is
spent defending other people, and it
is time that we started alleviating
this burden on the U.S. taxpayer.

For those who claim that U.S.
defense starts in Europe, I submit
that the only direct threat to the U.S.
from the USSR is nuclear, not con-

placed on reserve at the University
Library).

Instead, The Phi chose to print
some of the chief editor’s ‘selected
scribblings from a notebook” kept
while partying at the University of
North Carolina during break.

I am not asking why he had to take
notes during these parties. But why
should we care if he and a group of
UNC students walked into a sorority,
uninvited, at three o’clock in the
morning? When asked what they
were doing, our chief editor said (and
I quote), ‘“‘We’re thinking of buying
this place and we're just giving
ourselves a tour. May I help you?”’

Perhaps there are instances where
we all exhibit less-than-gentlemanly
behavior, but why brag about it in the
school newspaper?

And why, in past issues have we
had an abundance of one-time-only
“My View’’ columnists? If these peo-
ple wish to speak on a particular sub-
ject, then they should write letters to

the editor. One of these columnists
was the incoming president of this
same chief editor’s fraternity. Such
columns show potential conflicts of
interest and destroy the credibility
and purpose of the ‘“‘My View’’ col-
umn.

The Phi could regain some
credibility by reviving the ‘‘Readers’
Advocate’ column, Mike Hudson, a
varsity basketball player and senior
journalism major with whom I am
associated through my work at the
Roanoke Times, said he was asked to
serve as the readers’ advocate before
the school year s arted.

According to Hudson, The Phi
editors wished to edit his column for
content. Hudson said he produced a
column concerning a story written
last year by Mike Allen. According to
Hudson, Allen obtained an exclusive
interview with Scot Mesner by call-
ing Mesner immediately following

How safe

ventional, and that our defense struc-
ture against Soviet attack should in-
clude ICBMs, Trident submarines,
the Strategic Defense Initiative, etc.
I would also suggest that if we intend
to defend Europe, then an enormous
increase in spending commitments to
shore up NATO conventional forces
is in order. To meet the Warsaw Pact
challenge, a much larger quantity of
U.S. men, money and material will
have to be sacrificed by the
American taxpayer. The political
will to make this sacrifice does not
exist. To the economist who says that
we need viable European markets, I
say that any benefit we gain from
trade with Europe is absorbed ten-
fold by the money we spend defen-
ding Europe. Europe should have
assumed its own defense in 1949, and

Mesner’s indictment in last April’s
Fiji fire.

Hudson wrote that Allen had
scooped all of the local papers, in-
cluding the Roanoke Times. Accord-
ing to Hudson, chief editors Allen and
Bruce Potter wanted this informa-
tion deleted because they did not
want people to think that The Phi was
competing with the Times.

Hudson also wrote that he had writ-
ten the column at Allen’s request.
Hudson told me that Allen had
wanted this deleted because students
might infer that there were very
close ties between the editors and the
readers’ advocate. But in asking
Hudson to delete the statement, the
editors were performing the exact
actions that they wanted to hide from
the public.

“I wonder what would happen if I
wrote an article which criticized The
Phi editors,’’ Hudson told me.

These are jusi a portion of the
many incidents where The Phi has
apnarently avoided controversy and
shown a lack of direction and in-
itiative. There is no reason why such
incidents must occur. As an objective
newspaper, The Phi must realize that
all men (and women) are created
equal, and thus show integrity and
honesty.

As an editorial forum, The Phi
must allow for a divergence of opin-
ions, It cannot solve problems by put-
ting on blinders, and cannot gain
respect without being fair and honest
with the W&L community. Certainly,
The Phi, like the EC, must itself show
some direction and initiative.

I realize the editors maintain the
right to edit this letter. If any editing
is done, I would appreciate your
showing the courtesy of noting this in

it’s not unreasonable to make this
very plana reality withina decade. |

Europe nas the capacity to defend
itself, as a bloc — it out-produces the
U.S. economically. Once we realize
that the threat of a Soviet attack on
the U.S. is a nuclear and not conven-
tional, and that Europe has the re-
sources to provide for its own de-
fense, it becomes clear that defend-
ing the U.S. with nuclear weapons
and allowing Europe to defend itself
is an infinitely better policy.

Wa&L studies Davidson’s transition to coed

 

, By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington Holiday visit to Davidson reassured
members of the Coeducation Steering Committee that
. Washington and Lee was preparing properly for the ar-

rival of its first coed class.
* Associate Dean of the College Pamela H. Simpson,
. who heads the coed committee, Executive Assistant to

the President Frank A. Parsons and Director of
* Athletics William D. McHenry met with more than a
, dozen Davidson administrators, faculty members and

students during their day-and-a-half visit to discuss how
* Davidson had handled the transition to coeducation a
decade ago.

“We were so reassured. They didn’t tell us anything
that we hadn’t thought of already. We had at least

<

 

-Coeducation:

What Will It Mean?

thought of everything they had mentioned,”’ said Simp-
* son, referring to problems Davidson encountered while
, becoming a coed college.

“The overall attitude was that we had a very reassur-
* ing visit,’ said Parsons, echoing Simpson’s opinion.

, ‘We'd already been thinking about most of the things

that had been identified at Davidson as potential pro-

lems.”
, Davidson provides a particularly good example of the
problems W&L might encounter in the first few years of
* coeducation because before Davidson went coed the two

, Schools had been thought of more or less as peers, Simp-

* son said. After Davidson went coed, though, it began

» attracting students with higher SAT’s and began receiv-

ing more grant money than W&L.

” Simpson said she came away from the visit believing
+that Davidson is a very good school that has its
academic priorities in order.
“There are certainly things we can learn from
. them,” she added.

One of the differences that Simpson did note between
the two schools was that Davidson had almost no ex-
. perience with women on campus as students before it
decided to go coed, Simpson said. Davidson had not
‘even had any women exchange students until a few
«years before the school decided to become coeduca-
tional, she explained.

" W&L does not have that problem because the school
vhas had women as exchange students, special students
and law students, Simpson noted.

 

 

‘EC questions suggested position
for woman on Student Control

Partially as a result of this lack of experience with
women on campus, Davidson adopted a policy of reac-
ting to problems when they arise rather than trying to
anticipate every problem, Simpson said.

“They are very supportive and very responsive to
student concerns,” she added.

One problem Davidson officials warned the commit-
tee members about that they had not discussed much
before was that of eating disorders among bright, upper
middle-class women, Simpson and Parsons said. David-
son officials said that about 30 of 525 women students on
campus had some kind of eating disorder, including
bulimia and anorexia nervosa.

Both Parsons and Simpson said that they were im-
pressed with the attitude Davidson took toward making

sure that campus lighting was adequate to ensure the
safety of women students.

If a woman at Davidson complains that a spot on
campus is too dark, additional lighting is put in im-
mediately, Simpson said.

Parsons said that before Davdison had female
students the campus had been ‘‘dark as pitch.’’ Now the
Davidson campus is well lighted, he added.

“In general, I hope we can acquire a lighting system
as effective. If any of our women students feel insecure
anywhere, they’ll have to tell us about it, and we'll have
to remedy it,” Parsons said.

Sixteen additional lights will be erected on campus
where the deep rectangular holes along the sidewalks
are now, Parsons said.

Coed committee concerned
about sexual harassment

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Does speculation about someone’s
virginity constitute sexual harass-
ment?

Would a University code discour-
aging sexual jokes make students
more sensitive, or would it lead to

_ “academic fascism’’?

What should happen to a professor
who carries the ‘‘casting couch” con-
cept onto the campus?

Those were among the topics on the
table as the University Council and
Coeducation Steering Committee
met jointly Thursday to discuss sex-
ual harassment and how it should be
handled at a coeducational Washing-
ton and Lee.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, head of the Co-
education Steering Committee, said
the committee will revise the first
draft of its policy statement on sex-
ual harassment, which the Univer-
sity Council had seen.

In her opening comments to the
UC, Simpson said the main type of
sexual harassment being discussed
in the statement involves the abuse of
power by an administrator or pro-
fessor through sexual coercion.
Although cases of students sexually
harassing other students will be

punished as conduct unbecoming a
W&L student by the Student Control
Committee, such harassment might
fall within the bounds of Title IX,
Simpson said.

Several members of the University
Council said the students and faculty
must be informed of the contents of
the final University statement on
sexual harassment.

A second concern of University
Council members was that an estab-
lished procedure be set up for hand-
ling complaints of harassment.

Simpson said it did not matter what
the procedure was as long as one
were established. The goal of the
procedure should be to ensure that
the harassment is stopped, she said
— not to force an administrator to
punish a faculty member for every
incident. Reform and education is
what is needed, Simpson argued.

“I’m not particularly concerned
with the procedure that is set up,”
said Commerce School Dean Edward
C. Atwood Jr. ‘“‘But I think there
should be a procedure.”

Simpson suggested that an appro-
priate procedure might be for the stu-
dent who is harassed by a professor
to go to the head of the department or
to the appropriate dean.

Dean of the College John W. Elrod
said that a dean who is informed of
sexual harassment could often talk to

the faculty member involved rather
than take formal action. Many times
a professor might not have intended
to sexually harass a student, Elrod
added.

“What’s important is to become
sensitive to this as an issue,’ he said.
“Hopefully, it won’t get to the point
where a dean will have to get invovl-
ed in formal actions.”’

History Professor Henry P. Porter
Jr. said he was worried that one of
the clauses in the first draft of the
statement could lead to ‘‘academic
fascism.”’ Porter said enforcement of
the clause could lend itself to abuse.

The clause in question says, ‘‘Other
types of sexual harassment include:
sexual jokes, slurs, speculations
about virginity, sexually explicit
derogatory statements, sexually

ting remarks to cause dis-
comfort and/or humiliation to reci-
pient.”’

Assistant history Professor John
D. Parker said that the goal of the
clause seemed to be to inform people
of the type of behavior thst might be
considered sexual harassment. It
might be better to rewrite the clause
to say that ‘‘at some times sexual
harassment may include...” instead
of “other types of sexual harassment
include....”" Parker said. Not all sex-
ual jokes may be harassment, for ex-
ample, Parker explained.

+ The Coeducation Steering Commit-
tee’s recommendations that a fresh-
“man woman be appointed as a non-
*voting member to the Student Con-
_trol Committee was discussed by the
“Executive Committee Monday night.

- Junior representative Michael
_Black presented the resolution to the
“EC last week, and the topic was dis-
vcussed at length this week. The EC
did not make any decision on the
“"policy, but instead tabled it until next

week.

EC members questioned whether a
‘female ad hoc member would be
meeded once a female was actually
elected to the Student Control Com-
“mittee. In other words, would this
»measure hold as a permanent policy
,or would it only be a temporary
‘policy until women are well-estab-
‘lished in campus affairs?

This new measure also brought up
“the question of whether the female ad
rhoc member would represent a ‘‘min-
ority group,”’ in which case the ques-
‘tion of a black ad hoc member or a
foreign exchange ad hoc member
would have to be considered.
* Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers said he thinks that once a
woman wins an election, there would
‘be no need for an ad hoc member.
» “It would increase fairness and the
perception of fairness,’’ Caruthers
‘said.
, Other EC members, including
Black, said that a female ad hoc
‘member should be appointed when-

     
   
       
   
       
   

ever a woman fails to winan election.

The resolution states: ‘‘Most sim-
ply, we fear that women confronting
an all-male board will not feel them-
selves to be confronting peers.”’

Caruthers also said that perhaps
this year’s EC could endorse the
resolution and that next year’s EC
could ratify it if they feel it’s
necessary.

The resolution was partly as a re-
sult of a 14-hour discussion by the
University Council concerning the U-
niversity policy on sexual discrimi-
nation, (See related story this page).

In other business, the Calyx an-
nounced that all fraternities that fail

to pay for their picture this year will
have a blank page in the yearbook
saying the fraternity ‘‘did not pay.”
Old debts also must be paid to avoid
that notation. In addition, fraterni-
ties that fail to pay might be excluded
from the Rush Book.

In addition, the Film Society pre-
sented its budget report to the EC
and announced that it earned $83
from last weekend’s showing of ‘‘Lo-
cal Hero.”

Finally, the Student Telephone
Union brought up a request to have
its chairmen paid. The idea was in:

had to work a lot harder during that last week but doing
all those things really brought us together.”’

“It’s a good feeling now to be a brother,’”’ Harrington
continued. ‘“‘Now I feel equal and a part of the fraterni-

In The Cockpit

Regarding campus security, until recently, Davidson
students had been against having dormitory floors
secured by locks, Parsons said. Students had
demonstrated their dislike for the secure floors by
removing the locks or the even ripping doors off their
hinges and wanted the freedom of visitation between
dorm floors, Parsons said.

But after a rape in a dorm room about a month ago,
there has been a push by Davidson students for tighter
security, Parsons said. Parsons said a Davidson official
told him that in the past students have grown tired of
the additional security arrangements and have remov-
ed the locks a few months after an assault in the dorms.

Parsons said he thought that W&L would probably
have locked secure floors for its women next year, but
after learning about the Davidson experience he
wondered how successful a security measure the locked
halls would be. He added that it was up to the students
living on the hall to make sure the floors stayed secure.

Parsons said that the housing situation at Davidson
reinforced his opinion that W&L’s housing situation is
unusual. Davidson seeks to house 90 percent of its
students on campus, while only 40 percent of W&L
students live on campus.

Thus, while Davidson has traditional, long-corridor
dorms with double occupancy rooms, W&L must pro-
vide more attractive, modern housing in order to be
competitive with local private housing, Parsons said.

Some of the changes in the dining hall planned at
W&L next year are similar to the arrangements the
committee members saw at the Davidson dining hall,
Parsons said.

At the suggestion of female law students, the dining
hall will have a variety of table sizes next year so that
regardless of the size of a group they can find a table
where they can eat in relative privacy.

Davidson had a similar arrangement in its dining hall
with different sizes and shapes of tables rather than the
traditional rectangular tables, Parsons said. The table
arrangements contribute to a relaxed and informal at-
mosphere in the dining hall, Parsons said.

Despite all the changes Davidson has made since go-
ing coed, there is still some sexism on the Davidson
campus, Simpson said.

Members of the Women’s Concerns Committee at
Davidson told the W&L administrators that an attitude
still prevails at Davidson that the school’s traditions
belong only to the male students, Simpson said. Only
men in the school’s chorus are allowed to sing the
school’s fight song, she said. And a common saying
around campus is that ‘‘a Davidson man needs no in-
troduction,’ Simpson added.

Parsons said that women at Davidson also had com-
plained that more female professors were needed
because there was a preponderance of men on the facul-
ty.

Davidson administrators are trying to address
women’s concerns, Simpson said. She noted that David-
son was trying to bring more prominent women on cam-
pus as guest speakers because there are not enough
female role models on campus.

 

You knew who you could talk to about it.”’

“The worst thing about pledgeship is getting back
from break and still being a pledge after having all that
freedom,” Campbell continued. ‘I’m glad I’ve been
through it — but once is enough.”

Jeff Lovell, who until last weekend was a ‘“‘maggot’’
at Kappa Sigma, said all the extra activities at the
house allowed him to get to know some people he had
not known as well. Cleanup was the worst part of
pledgeship, he said.

“T’d rather write an English paper for Ms. Dunbar
than clean up the house after a party,”’ he said.

Blair Severe of Sigma Phi Epsilon said that pledge-
ship overall was “‘a great time — you're only a pledge
once. ”

“You look back on it and there were a lot of good
times and laughs,”’ he said.

The next pattern Shields traced
was the history of election landslides.
In the two previous presidental land-

In last fall’s race, Shields said, it was
a pro-Reagan election, rather than
an anti-Mondale one.

Reagan’s policies and said that if
they are looked at independently,
they represent political suicide. An

Group favors open library ©

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

The Library Advisory Committee
recommended Monday that the Uni-
versity Library maintain its 24-hour
schedule.

The decision was the result of con-
cern expressed by some faculty
members that in the future the li-
brary might operate on a restricted
daily schedule. The library is open 24
hours a day during the academic
year.

There were reports earlier this
year that closing the library from
midnight until 8 a.m. would save
money. Committee chairman and
history Professor Lamar J.R. Cecil
Jr. asked if any of the committee
knew where these reports originated.
The best guess the group had was an

Dog patrols
stepped up

Campus patrols by the city animal
control agent have been stepped up in
response to a request by University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley, Police
Chief L.O. Sutton said this week.

“We have been asked for assis-
tance and will render such,” said Sut-
ton, who met with Epley last Thurs-
day.

“The animal control agent will
patrol campus and will attempt to
remove all problem dogs — dogs run-
ning at large, that sort of thing,’’ he
said.

“Apparently a great number of
people have gotten lax, and controll-
ing the dogs is a problem,”’ he added.

He said the problems are caused by
the number of dogs as well as the
lack of control of them by their own-
ers. “They’re having problems with
them entering buildings, being
neglected’ and so forth, he said.

Sutton said loose dogs wil] be taken
to the local SPCA, and the owner will
be issued a summons for allowing a
dog to run at large.

III, at Read’s request, impaneled a
special grand jury to investigate
Rockbridge area drug trafficking.
The special grand jury, an in-
vestigative body that may not indict,
called more than 200 witnesses over a
seven-month period.

Pack’s attorneys had asked in a
written motion that the VMI
testimony be excluded because
“through deceit and in breach of the
attorney-client relationship, infor-
mation which the defendant confided
to Mr. Read....came back to haunt
him through the vehicle of the special
grand jury.”

Shannon Spencer, a defense
witness who identified herself as
Pack’s girlfriend, testified that when
she was called before the special
grand jury, she was asked if Pack us-
ed drugs. She said she had seen him
do so twice. -

The alleged transfer of information
about Pack from Read to the special
grand jury ‘“‘is a breach that you
can’t overlook,’ Ahern said. ‘It
doesn’t matter if they got informa-
tion from other sources.”

Jury foreman Blackburn, the
mayor of Glasgow and the only pro-
secution witness, testified that the

article in the Jan. 24 Ring-tum Phi,
which reported that the administra-
tion was studying the possibility of
shortened library hours.

Included in the committee’s re-
commendation was the condition that
the overnight operation of the library
stay within “existing or reasonable
costs.’’ The committee also will re-
commend that the library be opened
on a restricted schedule on several
weekends during the year when it is
currently closed.

Specifically, the committee recom-
mended that the library be opened on
the weekend before the start of fresh-
man orientation week so that incom-
ing freshmen and their parents can
visit the building. Although the
freshmen become acquainted with
the library during orientation week,
the committee feels it is important
that parents have the opportunity to

special grand jury’s initial informa-
tion about Pack came from a witness
who gave the panel a list of 25-30 peo-

Following the trial, Blackburn said
the grand jury subpoenaed ‘‘about
two-thirds”’ of the people on the list.

Court records show that Pack was
the 28th person subpoenaed by the
special grand jury. “He wasn’t

testified.

judge. “The evidence before the

Lacrosse controls Duke, 8-6
————— a

 

‘By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

» Saturday was a picture perfect day

for the opening of the 1985 lacrosse
‘season: 3,002 fans in attendance and
ithe sun shining on Wilson field. But
the Duke Blue Devils never had a
‘chance to enjoy the beautiful weather
-as the Generals defeated them 8-6.

The first period was a tight battle,
‘but the Generals gained a 2-1 advan-
jtage after 15 minutes of play. It was
in the second quarter that the
‘Generals took control and managed a
.5-2 lead before half. Even with this
three-goal lead, the Generals were
“determined not to lose their intensity
.in the second half.

“Coach (Dennis) Daly pointed out
our problems with shots on offense
and with our man-to-man coverage
on defense,"' said senior goaltender
‘John DiDuro. “The attitude in the
locker room was everyone wanted to
finish the job and we were only half
‘done.’ DiDuro had a sensational
+game with 18 saves and one assisted
goal to junior attackman Bill
“Holmes.

», But in the second half the tide turn-
ed and the Blue Devils began to move
“the ball with little trouble. When the
,Generals' lead was cut to two goals,
the thoughts of deja vu could be
‘heard in the stands from the field.
Last year the Generals led 7-2 at the
half and barely escaped with a 10-9

’ ‘victory. But this year the Generals

-held on and continued to play their

own game and rose to an 8-6 victory.

“We did a lot of things well, but

a lot of poise. We also shot very well,

, The Washington and Lee Tennis
team opened its season by splitting
"its first two matches, losing a close
confrontation to Division I Penn
State, 5-3-1, and dominating Division

‘IT was pleased, but Duke’s man
wasn't as skilled as what I expect to
see in the upcoming weeks,"’ Schoen-
berg said.

‘My wings did a great job — we
are all happy with our perfor-
mance.”

On the offense, senior attackmen
Jeff Mason and Sandy Brown played
agressive game; each had two goals.
Brown's efficiency on the field earn-
ed him the title of player of the game.

‘Brown did a super job on the en-
tire field. Offensively he scored twice
and defensively he responded well
when Duke had the ball,”’ Daly said.

In a final look at the Duke game,
the Generals played a spotless first
half but the second half was one of
poor shot selection. Daly felt the of-
fense should have played better ball
control and run out the clock instead
of forcing shots. But the team never
lost its poise and the new offense-
defense line-up without midfielder

matches, securing the victory for
Penn State. The inconsequential No.
2 doubles match of Mize and fresh-
man Mory Watkins was halted after
two split sets due todarkness.

Although it lost, the team had a
positive view of Friday's match. ‘‘We
had strong performances from Mize,
Wiman and Adams,” Coach Gary
Franke said. ‘‘We just didn’t have
that extra punch in doubles.”’

Messerly had similar feelings
about the doubles competition. ‘‘We
just haven’t had many opportunities
like that to play really good doubles,”
he said.

Haring also had good feelings
about the opener and pointed out the
improvement over last year’s meet-
ing. ‘They beat us 9-0 last year so the
closeness of the match gave us the
confidence that we can doit.”

In Monday’s match against Aver-
ett College, the team took command,
losing only at No. 1 singles, to
Averett’s Tapio Martti, who used an
arsenal of control and power to beat
Messerly 6-2, 6-3 in a match that

proved successful.

This Saturday, the Generals will
meet what should be the toughest
team on their schedule, the Universi-
ty of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The Generals lead the series, 17-12,
but have not beaten the Tar Heels
since 1978.

UNC is being billed as a tough and
physical team and it’s one Wash-
ington and Lee wants to beat
desperately.

“Our emphasis now is to improve
the problems we had with Duke,”
Brown said. “But to win everyone
has to put it on the lines and play the
game of our lives. We have to main-
tain mental intensity — Carolina is
Carolina and it’s going to be a heated
game. If we can win this one there is
no telling what we can do.”’

Assistant Coach Bob Shaps ex-
plained that the Generals need to
control the the tempo and wait for
high percentage shots. UNC is very

explosive and will take any advan-
tage they can find. The Generals’
defense will need to shut down the
Tar Heels early and continue through
the entire game. Everyone agrees
that the Generals need to play tough
for the whole 60 minutes and every
second will count.

“If we play the second half like we
played Duke, we will get killed,”
Schoenberg said.

The team is reported as being
healthy with everyone ready to play
this week. The attitude of the
Generals is good and they are once
again enjoying the sport now that the
season has arrived, and being
undefeated is a good feeling too.

Duke win, and I hope we can continue
in that direction this week,’’ Daly
said. ‘‘The game will give us a good

Another title won
by track dynasty

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee indoor
track team won its second consecu-
tive Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence championship Saturday at
Lynchburg College. Generals’ head
coach Norris Aldridge was named
the ODAC’s indoor track Coach-of-
the-Year.

The Generals captured first place
with 157 points. Lynchburg and Roa-
noke followed with 146 and 57 points
respectively.

W&L captured first place in five of
the ten individual events. Generals
Andy White (60 yard hurdles), Chris
McGowan (440), Bill Rhinehardt (60
yard dash), Mark Pembroke (880)
and Matt Steilberg (pole vault) took
first place in their events.

The Generals won all three relays.

Murdock’s troops are not underdogs anymore

 

.

, By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
"team lost three starting infielders to
«graduation last year, two of whom

, were all-ODAC players and four-year
starters.

This development would tend to

., lead one to believe that 1985 will be a

rebuilding season for the Generals.
»Don’t tell that to W&L head coach
Jim Murdock.
Murdock is looking for his team to
-improve upon last season’s 11-12
record, the most victories recorded
~ by a General team since 1972.
W&L was one of the hottest teams
in the ODAC during the second half of
“ the 1984 season, winning seven of its
11 games and finishing second in the
conference tournament.
“T really believe we'll have a good
season,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘We don’t
see ourselves as the real underdog

>

’ ‘anymore.”’

Murdock, in his fourth season at

W&L, believes that more than ade-
* quate replacements have already

been found for graduated infielders
Dave Warrenfeltz, Mike Walsh and

» Kevin Golden. The revamped infield,

combined with the return of the en-
tire pitching staff, starting catcher

. and two starting outfielders, could

enable W&L to challenge for the
ODAC title.
The pitching staff undoubtedly will

' be the Generals’ strong suit. Senior

co-captain Billy White, 6-2 in 1984,
finished second in the nation among

' Division ITI pitchers last season with

his 1.09 earned run average. White,
who was named to the second all-
ODAC team in 1984, had a string of
37'4 innings without giving up an
earned run last season,

Joining White in the starting rota-
tion is junior Kirk Breen, a right-
hander Murdock has said looked
“tremendous” in preseason prac-

tices. Sophomore lefthander Bill Sch-
oettelkotte, who performed well: at
times last season, will be the third
starter.

Junior Peter Detlefs will be W&L’s
stopper in the bullpen. Freshman
Carter Steuart, who possesses ‘‘great
potential,’ according to Murdock,
will be used as a long reliever. Sopho-
more Dave Howard and freshmen
Eric Acra and Sully Renuart round
out the General pitching staff.

Handling the pitching staff will be
senior catcher Mike Jacoby. Jacoby,
a co-captain with White, has improv-
ed offensively, according to Mur-
dock. Jacoby will be backed up by
sophomore Bill Curtiss.

The infield will be led by sopho-
more third baseman Milam Turner,
who topped the Generals in batting
last season with a .361 average. Tur-
ner, who was named second team
All-ODAC in 1984, split time between
third base and left field last season.

White will play shortstop when not
pitching. Murdock said that junior
Chris Jakubek will spell both Turner
and White.

Junior Chris Militello and Curtiss

will battle for the starting position at
first base. Militello is the better de-
fensive player while Curtiss posses-
ses a more potent bat, Murdock said.

‘‘We will be stronger defensively in
the infield,’ Murdock said. ‘‘We have
better speed and will be able to get a
few more balls hit up the middle. Of-
fensively, it remains to be seen. On
the whole, we’ll be better if anything
is hit in the infield.”’

The outlook for the Generals’ out-
field is somewhat clouded as a result
of injuries suffered by several key
players. Junior centerfielder Hugh
Finkelstein is still nursing a knee in-
jury from football but should be
ready for the season opener. Finkels-
tein led the Generals in stolen bases
in 1984.

Senior rightfielder Chip Hutchins,
a steady performer in 1984, has been
hampered by a shoulder injury dur-
ing the preseason and will probably
miss the first game. Behind Hutchins
is Adam Yanez, a sophomore who
showed flashes of brilliance last sea-
son,

competing for the starting nod in left
field. Murdock said both have pulled
leg muscles but should be available
for the season opener,

“We have very capable people in
the outfield,’’ Murdock said. “We
just need to get them healthy.”

Murdock described his team’s pre-

season practice as ‘‘very produc-
tive.”’

Murdock said W&L’s strong show-
ing in the ODAC tournament has af-
fected his team’s attitude going into
the 1985 season.

“The tournament has carried over
a great deal,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘We
developed a lot of confidence and now
understand that we have the person-
nel to win.”’

Murdock sees perennial powers
Randolph-Macon College and Lynch-
burg College as the preseason favor-
ites in the ODAC. He believes W&L
should finish in the top four in the
conference.

W&L opens its season Saturday at
home against Christopher Newport
in a doubleheader at 1 p.m. The
Generals play at Virginia Wesleyan
on Monday at 3 p.m.

collegiate sports world. Or at least

“jet us hope ney are apt. And one has every reason to believe they are.

And just what is the babbling Ring-tum Phi sports idiot venturing
toward (that is, talking about) now? Well, Lexington is the home of
two sports teams looking to serve notice that they are ready and able
to compete with the big boys. Got it, yet?

How about this? One’s season is getting under way and the other’s
— barring something unforeseen, but in a way not all that undeserved
— has come to an uproarious conclusion. The former has started with
a win, the latter has ended with a loss.

I'll prolong the non-existent suspense no longer. If we’re talking
about this fine city’s two teams looking to turn over new leaves, we've
got to talk W&L Lacrosse and VMI Basketball.

It warms this heart — and, indeed, most would say that’s a feat that
requires some doing — to see people excited about athletic competi-
tion again, and with the early appearance of Southern Conference
tournament final.

Perhaps I’m being a bit premature (most would say immature)
about the prowess of the local boys, but I prefer to go on with the
dream,

VMI and head coach Marty Fletcher deserve the admiration of
every one of us. The Keydets went into the Southern Conference tour-
nament in Asheville, N.C., last weekend — the first time in four years
they’ve been invited to the league’s post-season festivities — and let’s
just say they turned more than a few heads (as in try and catch us if
you can) on their way to the runner-up slot.

Needless to say, VMI was in the role of underdog in Asheville, and
they played it to the hilt, including a couple of overtime wins and an
upset of the tourney’s top seed.

The result was missing an NCAA bid — you know, the big one that’s
going to be on TV all the time in the next few weeks— by only five
points. More importantly, however, the Keydets finished at 16-14,
that’s more wins than the seniors have seen the previous three cam-
paigns and only the fourth .500-plus mark in 43 years. They have serv-
ed notice — and this isn’t wishful thinking — that they can and will be a
force, and that we just might be seeing CBS or NBC — that’s as in
Brent & Billy & Dick & Al — trucks pulling up outside of Cameron Hall
in the not-all-too-unfathomable future.

The W&L signs of rebirth are in their initial stages at present, but
one was certainly given a good, positive feeling after Saturday after-
noon’s performance on Wilson Field.

As a freshman, an astute observer of the W&L lacrosse phenomenon
noted that the key to good lacrosse lay with the man between the posts,
and if that’s the case — it’s certainly a big contributor — the Generals
can be happy with Saturday’s key performance by netminder John
DiDuro (18 saves).

In a year that head coach Dennis Daly and his troops have
unabashedly devoted to simply being ‘‘the best we can be,”’ one can be
pleased with the start of W&L Lacrosse '85. It’s an attitude one can
sense about this year’s team, a willingness to do what's necessary for
the best possible results and a willingness to take those results as they
come, Staring at UNC, Maryland and the WahooChildren in a row,
there’s no question the test will be quite stern. Here’s a guess the
Generals aren’t going to back down for anybody.

In the end, it’s good to see fan enthusiasm and better to see it
rewarded. Let us hope the Keydets and Generals have started a couple
of trends...

Four Tops

could be

top act in pavilion

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
‘The Back Page” Editor

 

The three-day Mink Dynasty
will begin its reign tonight as the
Four Tops headline the Student
Activities Board’s Thursday night
Fancy Dress concert at the stu-
dent activities pavilion.

Despite some confusion, ticket
sales for this concert are far
ahead of the sales for any pre-
vious pavilion concert, according
to SAB Entertainment Director
John Haywood. By yesterday
morning, about 800 advance tic-
kets had been sold. Haywood said
that compares with 200 advance
tickets sold for the Homecoming
concert featuring the Spinners.

Haywood said tickets will be
available at the door and that a
sell-out is expected. ‘‘We should
be able to get everyone in who
wants to get in,”’ he added.

The confusion arose due to a

 

communication problem with the
sophomore class, which is co-
sponsoring the event with the
SAB. George Kinkead, SAB treas-
urer, said the SAB did not know
earlier in the week this was a co-
sponsored event and that class
passes would be honored for ad-
mission to the concert.

As a result, some people who
had purchased class passes also
purchased a ticket for the concert.
Kinkead said refunds will be given
to those students who prove they
have bought a ticket and presenta
class pass. The class pass is only
good for one ticket, so yes, you
still have to shell out $6 for your
date.

The doors for tonight’s show
open at 9 p.m., and the show
begins at 9:30 with the Four Tops’
special guests, Wild Kingdom.
The Four Tops should take the
stage around 11 p.m.

For late FD shoppers, the SAB
will be selling tickets and memor-
abilia until 2 p.m. tomorrow.

Contemporary prints at du Pont

 

By BOB STRICKLAND
Art Critic

 

A traveling exhibit sponsored by
the Virginia Museum is on display in
du Pont Gallery until March 20. The
show consists of contemporary prints
by such artists as Richard Estes, Jo-
seph Cornell, Roy Lichtenstein,
Adolph Gottlieb and Helen Franken-
thaller.

Half of the show consists of Ric-
hard Estes’ ‘Urban Landscapes.”
Estes aims to mimic the camera in
his extremely objective renditions of
cityscapes. Before attempting a
piece, Estes takes a number of photo-
graphs of a proposed landscape and
then combines certain aspects of
each photo to recreate the scene. Al-
though his work imitates the photo-
graph, he achieves an effect that
many photographs are unable to
achieve: All elements of the composi-
‘tion are in sharp focus. Some ‘“‘pu-
rist’’ photorealists go as far as pro-
jecting a positive image onto the can-
vas and then trace in the image.

Most of Estes’ landscapes are
street scenes of New York’s Upper
West Side, where he lives. He is in-
terested in painting the world around
him. Estes’ artistic sight is purely ob-
jective; he paints what he sees, with-
out comment. Like Edward Hopper,
Estes sees a concrete world without
people or life. He examines the loneli-
ness of an urban landscape consist-
ing mostly of concrete, steel and
glass. Although Estes has the objec-
tivity of a Pop artist, he is concen-
trating only on a particular problem
of modern culture. Indeed, he could
have chosen a busy afternoon in Cen-
tral Park as the subject of his land-
scape, transforming the city into the
hub of civilization.

In ‘560’’ Estes emphasizes the
sterility of the urban world in the
gray reflections of a large plate-
glass. The setting is devoid of human
life. But from a stylistic point of
view, the work bears a rich photo-
realist style. Estes examines illu-
sions and reflections in the highly
reflective subjects of his works. One
can discover a myriad of reflections
of objects and buildings superimpos-

ed upon the large plate-glass. Estes
delights in visual deceptions and the
ambiguity of space in a modern, ur-
ban environment.

Although “‘Grants”’ is still free of
people, the work becomes more live-
ly with the busy glows of neon signs
and lights. The work reflects the fast-
paced lifestyle and the quick, dispos-
able nature of urban culture.

Another artist in the show who de-
lights in the trappings of the modern
world is Robert Rauschenberg. In
“Horsefeathers Thirteen No. 111”
(1972), Rauschenberg takes bits and
pieces from our mass-media culture,
and out of these fragments, he
creates a patchworked cross-section
of America. The title itself suggests
the colloquial and everyday. The ele-
ments of the collage are also every-

day and quite random: a tomato is.

juxtaposed against ice cubes; a sec-
tion of a map is placed against a
Japanese newspaper advertisement.
Against the mundane, Rauschenberg
places two collage pieces of higher
art, including part of a medieval bat-
tle scene. He delights in creating sub-
tle associations between images in
his collages as well as contrasts and
comparisons.

Another artist who enjoys working
with the medium of collage is Joseph
Cornell. Although Cornell is not as-
sociated with any formal art move-
ments, the European surrealists dis-
covered and supported him earlier in
this century. Cornell’s first show in
1932 included collages of unrelated
images he began to collect, including
old books, engravings and objects
that evoked other eras, other times
and other spaces. By arranging a col-
lection of bits and pieces of the world
in his collage, Cornell sought to evoke
the mysterious and the subconscious
links of logic and associations buried
deep within the mind.

Cornell explores the nature of geo-
metry and astronomy in one of his
untitled screen prints from 1972. A
series of cubes is placed against a cy-

Join Us For

linder and cone, all of which lie
beneath a burning sun. Superimpos-
ed over the sun is an astronomical il-
lustration. Like the surrealists, Cor-
nell attempted to tap into the collec-
tive of mankind in order to acquire
and develop images and symbols for
his art.

Adolph Gottlieb’s untitled work
from 1972 is another that plays upon
images of the collective subconscious
of mankind. The work is typical of
Gottlieb: A glowing orb appears ho-
vering above the lower area of ex-
pressionistic brushwork. The work
takes the viewer back to the times of
cave art, when ideas were expressed
through symbols and simple shapes.
Like the work of Cornell, Gottlieb
evokes the early civilizations of man-
kind.

Helen Frankenthaller’s ‘‘Spoleto’’
(1972) departs sharply from her us-
ual canvases by its blunt, non-poetic
colors. Gone is the lyrical, smokey
quality of her previous works. Yet
the work still illustrates her gestural,
emotional style. Replacing the trans-
parent, watery washes of her oil
painting is the pure color technique
that Matisse uses in his cut-outs.

Using the techniques of commer-
cial art, Roy Lichtenstein takes the
everyday and places it into a differ-
ent context in ‘‘Bull I’’ (973). He uses
a method of commercial printmak-
ing and achieves a bold graphic de-
sign. The bull as a symbol of strength
and power is echoed in the bold ver-
tical composition and the powerful
contrast between black and white.

The show’s diversity of prints takes
the viewer from quasi-surrealism to
Abstract Expression to Pop art and
beyond, while exploring the same
medium, the print. The stature of the
exhibiting artists is great and so is
the intricate techniques of their
prints, ranging from linecut to litho-
graph. Du Pont gallery is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and 2
p.m. to4p.m. Sunday.

Past comes alive
in ‘stunning: film

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

People often have an almost in-
herent interest in history, and the op-
portunity to see the past alive in the
present is a phenomenon seen every
day in Lancaster County, Pa., the
home of a large settlement of Amish.
The movie “Witness” gives a stun-
ning, if somewhat inaccurate, por-
trayal of these “‘plain people.”’ It has
suspense, humor, a love story, and in
each of these respects, it satisfies the
audience.

Who are these people who refuse to
take on the trappings of ‘‘modern-
day”’ life, who refuse to fight in their
own defense or in a war, and who
scorn the many tourists who come to
see their way of life? Through
“Witness,’’ we find out they are a
proud, strong, deeply religious peo-
ple.

It is the very simplicity of their
lives that not only sets them apart
from ‘“‘the real world,” but that also
makes them so very appealing. As
the hero learns, the Amish are not
simply ‘‘quaint.”’

Director Peter Weir’s film begins
with the recently widowed Amish
woman Rachel and her small son,
Samuel, setting out into the world of
the ‘“‘English.”” While waiting for a
delayed train in Philadelphia,
Samuel witnesses a murder. The
police detective assigned to the case
is Captain John Book (Harrison
Ford), and it is his experiences with
the Amish community that make up
the bulk of ‘‘Witness.”’

Weir’s camera works magic as it
plays over the acres of grain in the

Amish fields. There is colors and mo- *
tion. There are moments of light and _,
darkness. There is a great sense of
pacing in this film. When the action «
slows down, it slows for a purpose:
As Book adjusts to a radical change
in the pace of life, we adjust to a «
change of pace in the film as well. |
And there are silent moments, during
which not a word is said, but during +
which we learn as much as in any of |
the moments with dialog.

Still, these silent moments would '
mean nothing without exceptional -
performances, and the entire cast,
especially Ford and Kelly McGillis *
(Rachel), give just such perfor- ,
mances,

McGillis is stunning. As Rachel,
she is in love with a man she can‘
never have, caught between this man |
she loves and her native culture.
Ford, too, is outstanding. He is in his«
meatiest role yet, and he digs right,
in. He is tough yet gentle; he seems
in control yet caught up in something
beyond his control; he has strong,
convictions, tempered with a light:
sense of humor.

“Witness” is one of many late-,
winter releases now flooding theaters
across the country, and it is one well*
worth seeing. Some Amish have ask-,
ed that the movie be boycotted
because of technical inaccuracies’
and the exploitation of their culture,
in this picture. (In both of its first two
weeks, however, ‘‘Witness’’ was the‘
second-highest grossing film in the,
country.) ‘‘Witness”’ is, nonetheless,
a fine film that serves to add ap-
preciation of the Amish rather than,
to exploit them, and I recommend it
strongly.

Don’t be hauled in.

by ‘Night

“Night Patrol’’ is a poor excuse for
making a movie. It is a comedy with
weak, dumb, nonsensical humor. I
had the feeling this was supposed to
be a movie in the same genre as
“‘Airplane!’’, but compared with that
classic, this dud is a real bomb.

The plot is quite simple. Melvin
(Murray Langston) is a policeman
with a double identity. In his alter
ego he is The Unknown Comic; you
remember him: the bag-headed com-
ic who made a quick rise to stardom
a few years ago (then disappeared
almost without a trace). Well, the
trouble comes when another bag-
headed jokester goes around robbing
nightclubs, thus implicating Melvin.

Along the way, the audience watch-
es stints of voyeurism, gross-out
gags, a midget police captain who
can’t control his gastric expulsions
and countless other worn-out and/or
tasteless jokes. In fact, there were
only three really good laughs in the
entire movie, and one of these came
while the outtakes were being shown

-

Patrol’

behind the credits at the end.. ‘

The acting was as poor as the
jokes. Although there were somé
familiar faces on screen, none seemr
ed to get into the spirit of the movie.
One bright spot was the co-starring
role of Pat Paulsen, who hasn’t made
any appearances for quite some
time. Unfortunately, his laid-back,
quiet style didn’t fit with his
character’s playboy wenching.

From a visual standpoint, “Night
Patrol’ looked old, almost as if the
picture had been made at the height
of The Unknown Comic’s popularity
and let sit for release until now. The
sound was also bad and, at times,
thankfully so.

After only 20 minutes or so, ‘I
wanted to get up and leave, but J
stayed, hoping something funny
would happen. I was, however, disap-
pointed, and the only honest recom,
mendation I could give, therefore, is
not to be hauled in by the “Nig
Patrol.”

MY
VIEW

By Cole
Dawson

As other honor systems
crumble under legalistic pres-
sure or simply fade away due
to a lack of interest, we have
the unique opportunity to
strengthen our 120-year-old
tradition.

Monday through Wednes-
day, we will be able to vote on
a constitutional amendment
that will add an additional law
representative to the Execu-
tive Committee. This position
is long overdue and will serve
the entire undergraduate and
law campus in two very im-
portant ways.

First and most importantly,
it will give the EC added ex-
perience in honor-related mat-

ters and another possible ad-
vocate for open hearings. This
will facilitate the operation of
the Honor System University-
wide. Secondly, it will give
needed representation to the
second-year law class — a
class that has had no repre-
sentation in the past.

To pass, however, two-
thirds of one-half of the stu-
dent body must favor such a
change. Last year, this same
motion failed because one-half
of the student body did not
vote. It was, however, heavily
supported on the undergrad-
uate campus, as I hope it will
be again this year.

I urge everyone to exercise
their right to vote in both the
Big Three elections and on this
amendment. It will add
strength to our very tradition-
al University.

Cole Dawson is president of
the student body.

The election next week for the
Big Three offices of the Ex-
ecutive Committee may be at
the back recesses of most
students’ minds. The obvious
reason is its proximity to Fancy
Dress — a mind-blinding occa-
sion which takes place over the
next three days and tends to
linger on into next week. The
main reason for the lack of in-
terest, however, originates from
last week’s Phi editorial ‘‘E.C.:
No Comment’”’ on page two.
Many people either choose to be
or simply are more distant from
the business of the Executive
Committee. There is nothing
wrong with this, until it begins to
greatly affect the outcome of the
elections, just because students
with a valid opinion don’t bother
to vote.

By Darby

In my opinion, the purpose of
the editorial was not to totally
abuse the present Executive
Committee or to discourage
students from caring or believ-
ing in the future role of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. I think the
stern overview of this year’s
committee was meant to startle
students who are not as well in-
formed about our student gov-
ernment’s affairs. (The author
also wished to motivate a com-
mittee which he felt has been
somewhat dormant, but the ex-
planation of this is not my pur-
pose.) It is no secret that with
the first year of coeducation,
there will be added controversy
and a more diversified com-
munity over which the executive
Committee must govern. Thus it
is more important in this elec-
tion than any other in our recent
past, that we consider the can-
didates not just for their popular
names and characters, but also
for their realistic leadership
abilities. Ask yourself if these
potential leaders have the
motivation to tackle successfully
those problems which our com-

munity will face. If you don’t
know the candidate, inquire
about him. I do not question the
integrity of any student when it
comes to this decision-making
process, but it is too easy for a
student to vote for the name he
recognizes on the ballot.

The members of the Executive
Committee sacrifice a great deal
of time during the year, attemp-
ting as best as they can to uphold
the Honor Code and govern
effectively for the student body.
It takes very little sacrifice on
our part to make a knowledgable
choice in these elections. Don’t
allow students who cannot fully
handle the responsibility of these
offices to be elected. It can be a
waste of the Executive Commit-
tee’s time, as well as your own
since your legitimate expecta-

‘tions may not be reached.

Please note: Seniors and third-
year law students also vote on
Monday.

EC balloting to begin Monday

Honor stressed at Big Three forum

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

The Honor System and its
ramifications were discussed by
candidates for Monday's Big
Three elections at a forum Tues-
day.

The forum drew about 20 stu-
dents to a Commerce School lec-
ture room as this year’s Execu-
tive Committee campaigns offi-
cially began. Candidates had
turned in their petitions Monday
night to the Voting Regulations
Board.

The first round of voting for
EC president, vice president and
secretary will be Monday, with
runoff elections scheduled for
next Thrusday.

Three of the five questions
asked the four presidential can-
didates by the audience dealt
specifically with the Honor Sys-
tem. The candidates, Patrick
Hayden, Lee Hollis, John Lewis
and James White, expressed the
following opinions on the Honor
System:

eHayden: ‘‘The Honor System
works well only out of the will-
ingness of the students to make
it work.... The faith that the
students have in the EC makes
the Honor System work well."’

“Of course, confidentiality is
the basis for the Honor System.
The only way to strengthen it is
tohave the EC enforce it.”

“The Fancy Dress theme is us-
ually a better-kept secret than
most honor violations.”’

*Hollis: He said he would like
to see ‘intensive orientation to
the Honor System when they
first get here. Unless it’s embed-
ded into their head like a rock,
there’s no way the system can
survive.”

Hollis recommended that, if
possible, orientation at Natural
Bridge be reinstated to give the
freshmen “one-on-one contact
rather thana lecture.”

“The confidentiality of the
Honor System is the key to it,”’
he said. ‘‘It should never be leak-
ed out that someone was brought
up for an investigation and it
was dropped.”’

eLewis: A student accused of
an honor violation should be
given 48 hours, not 24, to prepare
his case before the EC hearing,
and there should be a much
greater degree of confidentiali-
ty, Lewis argued.

‘I, John Lewis, member of the
student body, can find out about
too many cases,’’ he added. “I
think it’s vitally important that
the air of confidentiality remain
that way. If you have people
talking about it, you are not go-
ing togeta fair trial.”

On the topic of orientation,
Lewis suggested a less formal
approach to encourage respect
for, instead of fear of, the system
and ‘‘a more folksy ap-
proach...rather than a reign of
terror approach.”

eWhite: ‘‘There’s no real
gauge to measure the Honor Sys-
tem,”’ said White, adding that if
it is working, students can give

tions as ‘‘Is there trust among

“IT think the orientation pro-
cess has been excellent,”’ White
said. “I really don’t see any
room for improvernent,’’ He said
he would try to utilize Law
School student leaders for first-
year orientation.

The problem with confidential-
ity is not entirely the EC's fault,
White said, but it is ‘‘a pressing
problem.”

“It plays a great part [in the
Honor System] and we have had

proved, the upperclass represen-
tative — who now represents
both second- and third-year law
students — would be divided into
two positions, one for each class.
This would increase the EC
membership to 13.

In order for the amendment to
pass, two-thirds of the students
voting must vote in favor of it
and at least half of the student
body must vote.

A similar amendment propos-
ed last spring failed because not
enough students voted. Although
more than two-thirds supported
the amendment, 70 students
fewer than 50 percent cast

The EC voted unanimously in
November to put the amend-
ment before the student body
again this year and has express-
ed support for the amendment.

support for another law rep, and
there seems to be a feeling that

Black: Coed committee experience helpful

Michael Black says one of his
main objectives in running for
election is to ensure a smooth
transition to coeducation next
year.

“Being on the Coeducation
Steering Committee has really
helped me a lot in opening my
eyes to what problems might
arise next year, and there will be
problems,”’ said Black, also a
junior representative to the EC.

The coeducation committee
recently passed a resolution ask-
ing the EC to appoint a woman
ad hoc member to the Student
Control Committee if one is not
elected. Black said that resolu-
tion, which he helped pass, is the
kind of action needed to make
sure women are treated as fairly
as men next year.

Black compared the problems
that women might have next
year with the problems he sees
minorities as having now.

“People would assume that if
{the Student Association for
Black Unity] had a problem with
the EC they would speak up

Caruthers:

Sophomore Andrew Caru-
thers, an Executive Committee
member for the past two years,
says he has ‘‘matured greatly”
during his time in office and has
“a better sense and understand-
ing” of the needs of the student
body and the University.

“If I see a problem or some-
thing that should be working dif-
ferently, I’ll try to come up with
ideas for how it might work a lit-
tle better,”’ he said. He discussed
three projects to which he has
devoted special attention:

*Voting Regulations Board:
“For the past two years,

‘there’ve been complaints about

elections,” he said ‘‘There’s
always been a chairman of the
Voting Regulations Board, but
no board. I decided we should
have a board.”’

He worked this term to recruit
VRB members and last month
successfully argued that the
VRB, not the EC, should run
next week’s elections.

eIndependent Union: ‘I tried
to take a sineere, genuine inter-
est in getting the IU organized,
even though the EC, I think,
treated it poorly,” he said.

He said he attended several
meetings during the group’s
formative stages last year and
gave it suggestions for obtaining
EC funding, which it has done.
He said he’s pleased to see the
social and intramural events the
IU is now sponsoring.

*Student Bar Association:
“It’s important for us to walk
across the footbridge and actual-
ly show our faces over there,”’
said Caruthers, who is the EC’s
ad hoc representative to the
SBA,

Last year he was a vocal pro-
ponent of ‘‘fiscal autonomy’”’ for
the Law School’ and feels they
should have ‘‘their own reins.”’

about it, but that’s not the case,”
he said.

Minority students might be
hesitant to bring their problems
to an all-white committee they
feel cannot possibly understand
them, Black said, and the same
thing might happen with next
year’s women.

‘“‘Next year is really going to
make it or break it for women in
the University,” he added. “‘If it
is a bad transition, the sour af-
tertaste will persist for a few
years, and I don’t want that to
happen. I love this school.”’

Black said that keeping lines
of communication open between
the students and their govern-
ment — and opening them for
minority students and women
— is one of the reasons he is run-
ning.

As for the EC’s job of adminis-
tering the Honor System, Black
said he sees himself more as
leaning toward the accused “‘un-
til the evidence goes against
him.”

“I’m not out to get anybody,”’

 

 

ANDREW CARUTHERS

He added that by attending SBA
meetings he’s improved commu-
nication between law and under-
graduate students, and that
“each truly appreciates the im-
portance of the other.’’

Turning to other topics,
Caruthers said the student body
looks to the EC for stability. ‘‘I
think people are tired of reading
in the paper every week about
some proposed change or new
committee,” he said.

“People just want everything
left the way it is. The students
expect us to take up for them and
express their views when these
proposals come up.”’

“When a big thing comes up,
we can’t be arbitrary or act on
our own personal whims,’’ he
added.

Caruthers said he'd like to see
less polarization among frater-
nities and between fraternity
members and independents. ‘‘I
really hate to see disunity in the
student body,”’ he said.

“It’s very important to have
friends in other fraternities and
friends who aren’t in fraterni-

he said. ‘If there is any doubt
about the guilt or innocence of
the accused, I lean toward the
accused.”’

The fact that both honor con-
victions this year were unani-
mous verdicts is evidence of the
EC’s care in ensuring that inno-

‘Spunky’ has

ties,’ he said. He added that
regulations mandating one-
house parties ‘‘only promote dis-
unity.”

As a member of last year’s
EC, Caruthers voted twice to op-
posé coeducation, but he said
he’s now eager for its arrival.
“I’m excited about coeducation,
and I’m not saying that to kiss up
to anybody,” he said.

“Everyone who’s honest will
admit that now that it’s passed,
our diploma is going to be more
valuable since the standards are
higher,”’ he continued. ‘I’m glad
that all of us are going to be here
to ensure that it goes the right
way. We need tradition through
the transition — and I'd like to be
one of those people.”’

Caruthers said the EC’s ap-
proach to the Honor System is
frequently |§ misunderstood.
“Sometimes I get the impression
students feel like the EC is a
Gestapo committee,”’ he said.

“We realize what a serious
matter the Honor System is and
yet we are not overly zealous, as
we should not be,’’ he said. ‘‘A
lot of times people don’t unders-
tand the emotional stress we go

cent students aren’t convicted,
Black said.

The vice president’s major re-
sponsibility, though, is to over-
see the student body budget, and
Black said he is qualified to han-
dle that job.

“Last year, I owned and ran
my own business — the Campus
Linen Service,” he said. ‘‘Just
having to run a business’s books
I think makes me extremely
qualified for the budget part.’’

In addition, Black said, his en-
thusiasm and outgoing nature
will enable him to stay in contact
with the student organizations
that receive funds.

“If they had some problems,
they would know I was there and
I would help.”

Black said his involvement in
student activities — the Student
Activities Board, student re-
cruitment and the track team, in
addition to his EC work — will
help him understand the varied
interests of the organizations.

He said he would like to see an
EC next year that will involve it-

‘matured

through in these things. We don’t
enjoy our job when it concerns
honor.”

He said a ‘‘commonsensical
attitude” is important in honor
matters. ‘‘This student genera-
tion doesn’t want people who
take a roadsign to be dismissed
from the student body,”’ he said.

He said it is the “‘fine line’’ in-
volved in such cases that makes

 

self in any issue that affects the
student body, even if the issue
does not specifically involve the
EC.

He gave as a suggestion the
possibility of the EC’s buying
banners or arranging for some-
one to lead cheers at football
games to increase school spirit.

“I feel like, ‘Get in there and
— not get your finger in every
pie and get pie all over the walls
— but get involved and show
your interest.’ I think that is
something we have not done this
year.”

“This year the EC has been
‘silent supporters,’ and I want to
change that.”

A friendly, outgoing EC can
reduce the fear some students
might have for the EC, Black
said. ‘‘I want the student body to
not feel threatened.”’

He also hopes that breaking
down the barriers between the
students and the EC will keep
next year’s women from becom-
ing alienated.

him believe the EC “should
concentrate on academic mat-
ters’’ such as cheating.
Caruthers last year was nick-
named ‘‘Spunky”’ for the energy
and zeal he brings his projects
and for his willingness to offer
some comic relief at meetings.
He is an English major from
Shreveport, La., and was pledge
president of Phi Delta Theta.

White: Stability,
aggressiveness
crucial qualities

Stability, experience and ag-
gressiveness. Those are the big
three qualities Executive Com-
mittee Vice President James
White says he would provide as
student body president.

White, a two-year EC veteran,
said next year doesn't need to be
one of upheaval, in spite of the
move to coeducation. “I think
the student body doesn't want

any controversy,’ he said.
“They're tired of it.
He said having an experienced

EC president will be more im-
portant next year than most.
“With the first year of coeduca-
tion, it's crucial to have a good
start,” he said.

‘In the past, for the first half
of the year or so, the EC kind of
sputtered and had to get hands-
on experience as they served,"’
he continued. ‘‘Next year,
there's no time for that. Every-
thing's going to start right off the
bat.’

White said he tries to strike a
balance in his approach to lead-
ership. ‘I see myself as pretty
aggressive but level-headed at
the same time,” he said. “I can
see how some people might think
I've been too forceful about cer-
tain things, but I guess that’s
better than being too wimpy
about something.’

‘‘T like to run a tight ship,”’ he
said. “I think next year’s EC
would be run very authoritative-
ly, but I would never let that get
in the way of seeking outside stu-
dents’ opinions. I think you can
find a pretty good median.”

White said the decision for him
to try to move from the number-
two to the number-one EC posi-
tion was not automatic. ‘“‘I
thought about it for a long time,”’
he said.

“I hate it when someone de-
cides to do something and then
half-asses it,” he continued.
“You've got to follow through. If

you can't do that, you shouldn't
attempt to do it in the first
place."

White said one of the biggest
campus problems is administra-
tion regulation of fraternities.
“There is no single problem that
has plagued the students more
this year as far as campus life
goes,'' he asserted.

I think the EC is in a power
position and they need to utilize
that power to represent stu-
dents,"’ he said. ‘I think student
opinion now is that fraternities
are grossly over-regulated."’

‘‘We do need some regulations
— everybody does,” he added.
“I think students would like to
see these regulations come
through their own authority, like
the IFC."’

White, who was an outspoken
opponent of coeducation, said he
trusts the judgment of the trus-
tees and thinks ‘ ‘‘coeducation is
going to be a positive thing at
W&L.”

“This is such a sticky ques-
tion,”’ he admitted. ‘‘I guess the
trustees saw that they needed to
keep up with the times and
evolve like everybody else has.”’

“‘T think it’s going to add a new
dimension to W&L it hasn’t seen
before,” he said. ‘‘They're going
to be very sensitive to their
rights and how they're perceived
on campus. I think the EC needs
to take the initiative in seeing
that these girls are assimilated
into our community efficiently.”

The primary responsibility of
the EC vice president is monitor-
ing student body funds.

“I’m really proud of the fact
that this year has gone so well
financially,’’ White said. ‘The
fact that we've run a tight ship
directly influenced the fact that
we didn’t have to raise the stu-
dent tax for next year and had
more money to allocate this
term.”’

JAMES WHITE

White said the EC this year
has been “incredibly efficient’’
in handling honor matters. ‘‘It's
hard to gauge the Honor System,
but if there is an indicator it's
our convictions,’ he said.
“We've had two convictions and
nobody's gone to an open hear-
ing."

EC members should take ‘‘a
realistic view" of the Honor Sys-
tem, White said. For example,
he said some offenses are more
in the ‘‘prankster-like category”
than they are genuine honor of-
fenses.

White reflected on the scrutiny
given student leaders. ‘‘You’re
up to everyone's judgment,” he
said. “Everyone is judging you, —
which can be stressful, I guess.

“You just have to focus on the
big picture, and hope that when
the dust settles people will think
you've done a good job. If you
were doing it just for the pres-
tige, it wouldn’t be worth it.
There are too many hours in-
volved.”’

‘‘When you’re EC president, it
kind of becomes your life at the
time,” he said. ‘“You've got to be
incredibly committed to the job.
It’s easy when you're in there to
start taking things personally
and lose sight of what students
want.”

White has been a kicker on the
football team all three of his
years here. ‘Football is great,
especially at W&L,”’ he said. “It
gives people who aren’t Division
I athletes the chance to play.”

‘It helps you off the field,’
too,” he added.’ ‘‘My grades are
consistently highter during foot-
ball season. It gives you more re-

sponsibility.’

White is an administration
major from Dallas who is a
member of Phi Delta Theta.

 

 

Hayden: Familiarity
with honor important

Junior Patrick Hayden says
his experience distinguishes him
from his opposition for Execu-
tive Committee president.

As a representative to the EC
this year, Hayden has served on
the budget subcommittee, the
White Book Revisions Commit-
tee and the Voting Regulations
Board revisions committee.

“These go to the heart of the
EC’s jobs, and I think I’m pretty
much experienced in these
areas,” Hayden said.

“When the main job of the EC
is administering the Honor Sys-
tem, it’s very helpful to have so-
meone who's familiar with it.””

Another thing that distinguish-
es him from other candidates,
Hayden said, is that he does not
belong toa fraternity.

“T think I can be a little more
objective in that particular
aspect of the job because I don’t
have a vested interest in any one
fraternity,”’ he added. ‘‘I can do
what's best for fraternities over-
an

Administering the Honor Sys-
tem is the EC’s most important
responsibility, Hayden said, and
the system does work, although
students often don’t see it in ac-
tion.

“There have been almost as
many investigations already this
year as there were all of last
year. Maybe that’s because the
student body feels more confi-
dent letting the EC look into
something they consider dishon-
orable,”’ he added.

The Honor System, Hayden
said, ‘keeps it a more friendly
University. I doubt it could work
like this on a much larger
scale.”

This year’s freshman orienta-
tion to the Honor System was
held at Liberty Hall. Although
Hayden said this was a good
idea, “‘you still have problems
with freshmen not really under-
standing when they sign those
cards in the first week.”’

Hayden said he would estab-
lish a formal program with
dormitory counselors so that

they can better help their fresh-
men understand the Honor Sys-
tem.

Describing himself as a “‘fis-
cal conservative,’’ Hayden said
he has several criteria he would
require student body organiza-
tions to meet before getting
money from the EC.

“Any organization that gets
money should be potentially
open to any student,”’ he said.
“The person asking for the
money should be able to give
some documentation of interest
and if there’s going to be enough
students to make it worthwhile.
If there are only 10 guys involv-
ed, I can’t justify giving an or-
ganization $1,000.”

Several weeks ago, Hayden
voted against giving the Hockey
Club an extra $220 (‘‘It seems
like they were getting more than
their fair share back of the stu-
dent taxes.’’)} and donating $100
to the Muscular Dystrophy Su-
perdance. (‘Student taxes are
meant for student organizations.
I don’t think I should tell some-
body to give their money to char-
ity. They can do that if they want
0,"’)

With the arrival of the first
female students in the fall, Hay-
den said, an important job of the
EC will be to ensure fairness to
all students.

Although a female ad hoc
member on the Student Control
Committee would help toward
that end, he said, one on the Exe-
cutive Committee probably
wouldn’t be necessary.

“Apparently there hasn’t been
any problem in the past with the
EC being all-male and being ob-
jective about it,” he said.

Hayden is a politics and his-
tory major from Rochester,
N.Y. In addition to his EC work,
he is chairman of the College Re-
publicans and was assistant sec-

retary for the 1984 Mock Conven-
tion.

Lewis: Student body needs a spokesman

Junior John Lewis says the
student body has lacked an
effective spokesman in recent
years and hopes to have the
chance to rectify that shortfall.

“I’m going to speak the mind
of the students, whether it’s pop-
ular with the administration or
not,” he said. ‘‘What I feel is the
pulse of the student body is what
I’m going to give to people who
request that view.”’

Lewis said an example of the
message he'd like to convey is
that ‘fraternities are liked here
and are a good thing.”’

“Tell people who complain
about the fraternities to look
elsewhere before tiey criticize
us,”’ he said. ‘‘I think before they
smash the fraternities they
should think about what type of
students would be attracted to a
school with absolutely no social
life at all.”

““W&L has always prided itself
on the full man,”’ he added.
“Wisdom without character is

nothing ‘‘

Lewis said that with the ad-
vent of coeducation, women
should be welcomed but not cod-
dled.

“Since it was handed tous asa
fait accompli, I think for the
good of the University and the
progressive spirit, the student
body should stand behind it and
make the very best of it,” he
said.

“I’m having a terrible pro-
blem with this ‘boys will be boys
and girls will be girls’ attitude,”’
he added. “I think honor is some-
thing that, male or female, is
characterized by the same ac-
tions.”’

“‘W&L has a real honor code
and women can fit into that
beautifully,’ he continued. “It
should treat women exactly the
same as it treats men. That’s
what women want these days,
and I think W&L with its new
progressive attitude should do
that.”

 

 

JOHN LEWIS

Lewis said equality should al-
so characterize committee ap-
pointments. ‘“To give token posi-
tions, to have affirmative action
programs, is not what W&L
should do,” he said.

Hollis: has ‘ground floor’

Junior Lee Hollis says that
since he’s ‘been on the ground
floor’”’ of coeducation plans, he’s
a logical person to lead the stu-
dent body that change next year.

“I’m surprised the EC hasn’t
been involved in it this year,”’
said Hollis, who is chairman of
the fraternity affairs subcom-
mittee of the coeducation com-
mittee. ‘‘I figured they’d want to
takea little more active role.”

‘“‘When the EC. gets
recommendations plopped in its
lap, it’s going to need to know
whether they came from and un-
derstand them,” he said.

“The biggest thing the EC can
do with regard to easing the
transition to coeducation is to
wing it,” he said. ““You can’t an-
ticipate all the problems that
may come up. You have to try to
alleviate the problems when
they come up or before they
come up.”

Hollis said he supports the
recommendation that a woman
ad hoc member be appointed to
the Student Control Committee,
and added that he would favor
similar representation for black
students.

“T think it sets a precedent for
that type of action,” he said. ‘‘I
don’t know if it’s likely or not. I
don’t know how they feel they’re
being represented. My guess
would be that they don’t’ feel
they’re being adequately
represented. “If I were in their
shoes, I probably would’’ re-
quest such representation, he
added.

Hollis said he was originally
against coeducation, but that he
has no bad feelings about it now.
“There’s no need to hold a
grudge. From the beginning, I
didn’t have any qualms about
the idea of coeducation in gener-
al.”

His objection, he said, was
centered around tradition. ‘Now
that it’s here, there are certain
traditions that might be lost next

year,”’ he said. As an example,
he cited Robert E. Lee’s idea of
honorable behavior being simply
behavior becoming of a gentle-
man.

Hollis said his subcommittee
has found that ‘‘we don’t have to
accept the fact that we're going
to lose some fraternities under
coeducation.”’

“We're trying to get financial
data that shows a fraternity of 30
can survive and thrive,”’ he said.
“Although it looks probable that
you’re going to lose a few, it
doesn’t have to happen.”

Hollis said this year’s EC ‘“‘has
done a lot for the Honor Sys-
tem,’’ and he said he’d like to
continue that trend. ‘‘The impor-
tant thing to me is raising
awareness of the Honor Sys-
tem,” hesaid.

Hollis said some students have
misunderstood the administra-
tion position on fraternities.
“From what I’ve seen of the ad-
ministration, and I’ve been ex-

“If women get elected, that’s
what we want, but women should
not just be put there. That will
cause resentment among men.”

Lewis was unhesitating in his
assessment of the current state
of the Honor System. ‘‘The honor
code at Washington and Lee
works,”’ he said. “If I didn’t
think it worked well, I wouldn't
run for head of it.”’

Lewis is impatient with con-
stant discussion about loopholes
in the Honor System. ‘‘For me,
it’s so simple,” he said. ‘‘To act
honorably encompasses all the
technicalities. If you have honor-
able men, you don’t need the
technicalities. You have the reg-
ulations to nail those that are
dishonorable.”

The fraternities should be
among next year’s EC agenda
items, Lewis said.

“Fraternities are an example.
I hate to keep bringing that up,
but it’s true. Nobody is looking
out for them.”

Lewis said that as a dorm
counselor this year, he has
learned that W&L “‘selects real-
ly good men.”’

“‘] think that’s something that
in many cases the faculty and
administration fail to put their
finger on,”’ he said. ‘‘They see it
as a bunch of little boys running
out and joining fraternities.
Many of them are very responsi-
ble and much more mature than
they come across on Friday
night ata party.”’

Lewis said the fact that his
brother was a ‘‘seven-year
man” is helpful to him in under-
standing law students’ perspec-
tives on campus issues. ‘‘I also
have friends at the Law School
who give me good advice and
keep me in touch with their con-
cerns,”’ he said.

posed to a lot of it this year,
there’s no vendetta against the
fraternities,’ he asserted.

“What the administration
wants is for the fraternities to
alter their ways a little bit.... and
to run themselves a little more
efficiently.”

“I hope we'll come up with
some ways to fix the problems
ourselves before the administra-
tion lays down the law,” he add-
ed. ‘‘Coeducation is a golden op-
portunity for the IFC to take the
bull by the horns and go ahead
and doa few things.”’

Best: EC
must aid
transition

Junior Steve Best foresees an
uneasy passage into coeduca-
tion, but says the Executive
Committee can help ‘“‘facilitate
the transition.”

“In three or four years, the
problem won't exist,’’ he said.
“For the first couple of years,
there’s going to be less than an
amiable atmosphere with the
girls. This can be predicted
— almost assured — just be-
cause the students were against
it and the teachers were for it.”’

“At W&L, it’s hard enough as
it is to succeed academically and
socially without being put down
by some spiteful males,’ he
said. ‘‘Our concern is that we try
to keep this to as much a mini-
mum as possible.”’

Best said that while ‘‘you have
to be fair to them — they’re
Washington and Lee students
now,” there will be a ‘general
bad feeling’’ if there are rules
“that we have to have a woman’’
in any particular organization.

“IT don’t believe in maintaining
quotas at all,”’ he said. ‘I don’t
believe a lesser person should be
put into a position that could be
held by a more qualified student
just because of race, creed or
sex.”’

Best said because the EC has
the ‘‘final say”’ in all matters, it
will have an influence on the
transition even though there is a
coeducation committee. ‘‘The
EC can take it upon themselves
to do something if someone
comes up to them with an idea,”
he said. ‘‘They don’t have to wait
until somebody on a subcommit-
tee thinks of it.”’

Best said the EC also can be
helpful to fraternities next year.
“The fraternity system at W&L
is integral to the community,”
he said. ‘‘The EC should treat it
as such. The EC should be

  

 

STEVE BEST

involved with everything that’s
important at W&L.”

Best said that in spite of the
campus changes in the last year,
the Honor System remains in-
tact. “I’ve been to different
schools, like J.M.U. and U.Va.,
and I’ve been amazed at the
amount of cheating,” he said. He
views the degree of student hon-
esty here, on the other hand, as
“absolutely fantastic.”

“Granted, you’re going to get
a couple of cases where students
want to take the short way out
and cheat instead of studying,”’
he added.

“I’m a stickler about being a
gentleman and being honorable,
but I also don’t see things in
black and white,’’ he said.

Best, a politics major from
Arlington, is the secretary of the
coeducation subcommittee on
student organizations and is the
incoming rush chairman of Pi
Kappa Alpha. He was vice presi-
dent of his freshman class and
was a member of the Student
Control Committee and_ this
year’s Who’s Who selection com-
mittee.

Best has worked on Capitol
Hill for the last six summers. He
plans to attend law school and
then become a trial lawyer. ‘I’m
not the kind of guy who’s going to
be a tax lawyer and sit behind a
desk,’’ he said.

He said if he loses his bid for
secretary, he plans to run for
senior EC representative or vice
president of the Commerce
School.

Webb: Communication key

Although sophomore Mike
Webb is a minority student, he
hopes other students will per-
ceive him just as one of them.

“Pm not just running as a
black student,”’ Webb said. ‘‘I’m
running as a Washington and
Lee student, and I want the stu-
dents to perceive me that way.
I’m pretty much doing this be-
cause I’m interested in what’s
going on in this University.”’

Even so, Webb said, there is a
role for a black student on the
Executive Committee, particu-
larly in the administration of the
Honor System.

‘*A lot of minority students feel
that because there isn’t a quote-
unquote ‘brother’ up there, going
up against an all-white executive
board nullifies their chances of
getting acquitted or whatever,”
Webb said.

The EC must make an effort to
let students, especially minor-
ities, ‘know that they’re not out
to get them,” Webb said.

‘“} don’t think the EC’s out to
get people. If you are an honor-
able student, then you really
shouldn’t have any fears of the
EC.”

Any racism that does exist at
Washington and Lee is at least
partly overexaggerated, Webb
said.

“I don’t see the racial problem
too much at Washington and
Lee,” he added. ‘‘I think that it’s
partly paranoid...If something

LeClerca:

Junior dorm counselor Ted Le-
Clercq said this week that ad-
ministration of the Honor Sys-
tem is the most important job of
the Executive Committee and
that he would be able to give any
student a fair hearing.

“] think the best thing about
the Honor System is that the stu-
dents interpret where they go in
terms of specific violations,’’ Le-
Clereq said. ‘‘I think that pre-
vents something that the student
body as a whole might not agree
with.”

“T care very much about how
the Honor Code here at W&L is
enforced, and I’m interested in
participating in the EC,” he con-
tinued. “‘I think it’s important to
use just good common sense.”

Next year’s EC will have to

ease the transition to coeduca-

happens there are cries of ra-
cism.”’

Webb defined his campaign
theme as better communication
between the Executive Commit-
tee and the student body.

“A lot of students know who
the EC members are, but some-
times the EC members don’t
know who the students are,”
Webb said. ‘‘The key to any good
government is communication.
As long as people know what’s
going on, you can’t go wrong.”’

Communication is going to be
particularly important next year
with the arrival of the first
female undergraduates, Webb
added.

“‘T think that if we make initial
contact with the women stu-
dents, then they’ll feel that they
are a part of the community and
that if they have any problems
they can come to you,’’ Webb
said. “If the EC and other large
campus organizations don’t ex-
tend their hands first, I think
there’s going to be unnecessary
tension.”’

Appointing women ad _ hoc
members to the Student Control
Committee and the Executive
Committee if none is elected in
the fall also would help ease the
transition to coeducation, Webb
said.

“Tt will be a — and I hate to
use the word — token effort to let
the women know that we’re con-
cerned about their problems and

things like that,’ Webb said.

Webb acknowledges that ad-
ministering the student body
budget is another important
aspect of the Executive Commit-
tee. When a new organization
comes to the EC for money,
Webb said, “If it’s something
that represents a valid student
concern, then I think you should
give maybe like seed money. I’m
willing to take a chance with
something that sounds good.’’

However, Webb said, he would
require the club to have a spec-
ific use in mind for the money
and to show that it has a certain
number of members.

Webb, a public policy major
from Jersey City, N.J., hopes to
attend law school after gradua-
tion. He was freshman represen-
tative to the College Republicans
last year and is finance chair-
man this year.

pointment of a woman ad hoc
member to the Student Control
Committee next year if one is not
elected.

“T think it’s important to avoid
both the appearance of unfair-
ness as well as unfairness it-
self,” he said. ‘‘I think that is one
of the questions the EC will have
to resolve, as far as a woman

feeling she’s potentially not go-

ing to get a fair hearing.”’

A required spot for a female on
the EC, though, will require
more discussion, LeClercq said.

Returning to the issue of hon-
or, LeClercgq said he is disturbed
with what he has heard about
how much information escapes
from closed honor trials.

“‘If a student is accused of an
honor violation and is acquitted,
I feel it’s crucial that the individ-
ual’s right to a closed hearing be
preserved.

“Tt just strikes me as inappro-
priate that details of a closed
honor trial would have been dis-
cussed in some way that would
have breached confidentiality.”

LeClercq said his experience
in student activities — dorm
counselor, a reporter for The
Ring-tum Phi, and a member of
student recruitment and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon social fraternity
— qualifies him for the job.

“I’m very interested in the
position and think I have the ex-
perience to do a good job,” he
said.
 

 

 

Cooper:

Coeducation will be a major is-
sue next year, and EC secretary
candidate Bill Cooper says he
has an idea of what next year’s
freshman class will be facing.

Cooper, a second-year law stu-
dent from Chatham, N.J., at-
tended Hamilton College in New
York during the first four years
that school was coeducational.

“Especially next year, with
the change to coeducation,
there’s going to be a felt need for
accessibility. People are going
to have to be more conspicuous
than ever,’’ Cooper said. ‘‘May-
be I might be able to drag some
direct experience out of
(Hamilton College)...It gave me
a good basis for being able to
offer a lot to the EC next year.”’

Although he is a law student,
Cooper emphasizes that he
spends plenty of time on the un-
dergraduate campus. He is a
member of the brass and percus-
sion ensemble and works as a
bartender in the Cockpit.

These experiences, Cooper
said, ‘have given me a feeling of
what being a W&L undergrad-
uate is all about....0ver in the
Law School, we don’t get the full
exposure to that whole ethos of
the University that the under-
graduates do.”

On the division between the
Law School and the undergrad-
uate campuses, Cooper said, ‘I
think both sides need to try to
understand the other side a little

Svalina:

Junior Sam Svalina says he
decided to run for Executive
Committee secretary after per-
ceiving that recent student
leaders have ‘‘buckled under”’ to
the University administration
while changes were being made
against the wishes of the student
body.

Specifically, Svalina said,
changes in the fraternity system
that stemmed from a faculty re-
port by the Ad Hoc Committee
on Fraternity Affairs have been
helped along by student leaders
who are “looking for resume fod-
der and not trying to make
waves and not standing up for
what the student body wants.”

“People are fed up with the EC
because they’re being wishy-
washy,”’ he said.

Svalina said he wants a stu-
dent government that represents
the students on the issues that
concern them, but not one that
involves itself in matters that
don’t concern it.

“What they’re there to do is
protect the student body, to re-

present the student body,” he |

said. ‘They're there to guide
and referee.”

‘ff there are rocks rolling
down the hill, they should stop
them, but they shouldn’t go turn-
ing over rocks looking for things
todo,”

Svalina said he supports the
creation of a required spot for a
woman on the Student Control
Committee and the EC.

more. There’s got to be some de-
gree of voluntariness.”’

“We're all students at Wash-
ington and Lee University first
and then undergraduates and
law students.”

At Hamilton, Cooper's activi-
ties included managing the hock-
ey team and performing in the
brass choir.

“T think I have reasonably
good skills at dealing with so
many different types of people,”
Cooper said. ‘I want to make
them feel satisfied that I’m com-
municating with them. I'll try to
do something if I can do it. I’ll
try to be honest with them.”’

The EC secretary, Cooper
said, is ‘‘one of the three people
who represent the student body.
that everybody has access to or

should have access to. I think my
people skills will help me be ac-
cessible."’

During a year off between
Hamilton and W&L, Cooper
worked on the successful state
senate campaign of his state as-
semblywoman. “‘I have a good
grasp of what an elected official
should do,” he said.

Next year’s EC, Cooper said,
“is going to have to exercise a
good deal of leadership just to
preserve what we want to pre-
serve about Washington and
Lee.”’

Among things the EC must
help to preserve are the Honor
System, which promotes trust
and respect for other students,
Cooper said.

“Preserving an atmosphere of
trust and honor is the single
most thing’’ the EC is responsi-
ble for, he added.

Cooper, who was not in a fra-
ternity at Hamilton, said that
regulations on fraternities
should not be imposed but should
be worked out through discus-
sions and compromises.

“I think [the fraternity sys-
tem] plays a vital part in the soc-
ial life. I think it can play a
greater role in the academic life,
in the learning environment, and
I think it should,’’ Cooper said.

Cooper, a history major and
music minor at Hamilton, is
specializing in international law
at W&L.

Elections to be run
by independent board

 

From Staff Reports

 

A rejuvenated Voting Regula-
tions Board will administer Mon-
day's Big Three and referendum
votes.

“There was a potential con-
flict of interest when the Ex-
ecutive Committee conducted
the election and so many of its
members were running again,”
said senior David Hanna, the
newly appointed VRB co-chair-
man.

His co-chair is Bill Metzger
and they have a committee of 10.
“It’s not a closed thing — we
figure, the more the better,”
Hanna said.

Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. in the Davis Dormitory
Quad, outside the Commerce
School and the University Li-
brary and at the Law School.

He said results should be
available at the Executive
Committee room shortly after 7
p.m,

The vote on the constitutional
referendum will be conducted
Monday through Wednesday,
but polls will not be manned the
second two days. Big Three run-
offs are scheduled for next
Thursday.

this year were increased to $25

“Guys don’t know what girls
want, and you need to have them
represented,” he said.

However, he said, they should
only be in an advisory position,
and not given a vote, unless they
were elected.

One problem that must be
guarded against is women’s and
men’s issues becoming polarized
and creating a rift in the student
body, he said.

In investigating possible honor
violations, Svalina said, he
would treat a violation the same,
regardless of its degree.

“It’s the intent, not the act,”
he said. “‘If he stole a thousand
dollars or a nickel, he stole it and
he should be kicked out.”’

“The EC’s got to be strong,
and I think I’m strong enough to
be on it and do what needs to be
done,”’ he said.

“T feel like I can do what the
student body wants without
worrying about what the admin-
istration or special interest
groups want me to say or do,’’ he
continued.

 

 

 

SAM SVALINA

“It seems to me that the peo-

ple in the Ad Hoc Committee are
trying to change the campus and
put regulations on the student
body.
“The truth of the matter is, I
believe that regulation leads to
regulation and then confusion,
and they’re just doing it to put
their foot down.”’

Svalina said that regulation of
fraternities goes against the
theory of a liberal arts school, in

which students are given a
choice in their education: ‘‘That
choice is being taken away from
the W&L student.”

“The only thing I think the
school should be involved with is
making sure the fraternity isn’t
in the red or falling apart,”’ he
said.

Although the EC doesn’t have
a direct say in fraternity affairs,
Svalina said, he hopes next
year’s EC will support the issues
as the student body sees them.

He said his experience as Chi
Psi’s secretary will help him if
elected. He has also been a
member of the golf team and
worked on the Muscular Dystro-
phy Superdance the last two
years, the last one as special
events chairman.

, for the initial election and $20 for

the runoff.

Each candidate is allowed a
banner as large as a king-size
sheet, and 15 standard-sized pos-
ters. Hanna said ‘‘there seems to
be a fairly high turnover among
the posters,’’ so a large portion
of the spending allowance goes
to printing costs.

The VRB set the rules this
year, another example of its in-
creased authority, and it will do
all ballot-counting. ‘‘The EC is
delegating power,’’ Hanna said.

Sophomore EC representative
Andrew Caruthers worked to es-
tablish the revitalized commit-
tee. ‘‘We don’t bring the SAB in
here to watch them book Fancy

delegate that.”

The Interfraternity Council
also is holding its elections
Monday.

Nominated for president
are juniors David Butler of
Beta Theta Pi and Jamie
Hayne of Kappa Alpha, the
current IFC treasurer.

Candidates for vice presi-
dent are juniors Jamie Ber-
ger of Phi Kappa Psi; Eddie

The combination of a squeeze on revenues and an in-
crease in demands for funding is forcing a reassessment
of the University’s priorities, administrators say.

A number of popular but costly programs and pro-
cedures that have become accepted as permanent parts
of the institution are being examined and may be reduc-
ed, according to administrators.

The purpose, they say, is twofold: Such management
will help to slow- the increase in the cost 6f a Washington
and Lee education, and will also allow resources to be
shifted to areas of greater priority.

Students have initially resisted even discussion of
these possible cutbacks. Administrators respond that
they want to do nothing to diminish the quality of student
life, and hope students will recognize the value of the
self-scrutiny by the school.

Possible Cutbacks: University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley said the school is searching for ‘‘niceties, luxur-
ies, amenities that aren’t essential to the faculty teach-
ing the students.”’

Two areas that are being studied for possible reduc-
tion have been announced publicly:

¢The University Library could save as much as $24,000
in electricity alone by closing overnight rather than
maintaining its 24-hour schedule, officials have deter-
mined.

eThe Executive Committee was told Monday night
that $5,000 a year could be saved by shifting the annual
Catalogue to a biennial publication schedule.

Three additional areas of attention were identified this
week:

eEpley said energy savings could result from closing
the Colonnade classroom buildings at night.

eHe added that similar economies could be achieved
by reducing the heurs or services available in the War-
ner Center gymnasium.

Sophomore Andrew Caruthers edg-
ed junior Michael Black by 23 votes
to win the Executive Committee vice
presidential election Monday.

Juniors Lee Hollis and John Lewis
qualified for today’s runoff for presi-
dent, and second-year law student
Bill Cooper and sophomore Michael
Webb made the runoff for secretary.
Runoff results’ were expected to be
posted outside the EC room early this
evening.

Monday's balloting attracted 1,034
voters, or just more than 60 percent
of the student body.

Caruthers captured 482 votes, or
51.2 percent of those cast for either
candidate, to Black’s 459 votes, or
48.8 percent.

Caruthers’ margin of victory came
from the Law School, which he won

Black

 

¢Dean of the College John W. Elrod said his depart-
ment heads are cooperating with a request to economize
on increases in their supplies and equipment budgets.

Development Director Farris P. Hotchkiss said that
was a logical area of consideration. ‘‘Where [a spending
reduction] has an impact is that if the school is placing
priorities in the human area — as it should — the only
place it can take its toll is in just not allowing the pro-
gress we might want in the supplies and equipment
category,’’ he said.

Epley declined to specify other programs being stu-
died. ‘‘I have some ideas, but I'd prefer not to go on,”’ he
said. “Invariably, sooner or later you get into eliminat-
ing positions.”’

“TI can’t see this university calling someone in and
saying, ‘You're fired,’ ’’ he continued. ‘““But what we
might do is eliminate positions by attrition. As people
quit or retire, they would not be replaced.”

Administration Explanation: Administrators maintain
that no decisions have yet been made — that the
University is simply investigating potential economy
measures, and will later determine which of the options
it should pursue.

Elrod said an investigation may show, for example,
that the present library and Catalogue operating pro-
cedures are cost-effective and should be continued.

“I’m just raising the question,’’ he said. ‘‘We need to
do an investigation before we can make a decision. We
need some hard, cold facts to talk about.”

He added that he is simply looking to the budget ‘with
a view to reallocating money if it should be reallocated.”

University President John D. Wilson said it is critical
that the University ‘‘put the greatest emphasis on those
things that most need to be done.”’

“I frankly don’t feel I could begin to pretend to be do-
ing my job if I didn’t identify the things that count
most,” he said. ‘‘That’s all part of running an effective
institution — to ask the questions.”’

Quad by a 112-91 margin.

Black, meanwhile, won the Com-
merce School votes, 190-171, and the
Library votes, 121-92.

Caruthers said that although he

didn’t specifically target the Law
School, ‘‘in my two years on the
committee, I’ve looked out for the
Law School.’’ Caruthers is sopho-

Lexington leaders,
SABU form group

 

By PAULFOUTCH
News Editor

 

A group of black community
leaders met this month with mem-
bers of Washington and Lee’s Student
Association for Black Unity in an at-
tempt to improve the relationship be-
tween the two groups.

Dr. A.W. Pleasants Jr, a Lexington
physician, organized the meeting
after reading a newspaper article
about blacks at W&L that said black
students feel isolated from the rest of
the school and from the community.

‘T felt maybe the community pro-
bably had some responsibility to
those fellows,’’ Pleasants said.

The meeting was held March 4 at
Pleasants’ house.

City Council member A.C. Jordan,
Lexington School Board Chairman
Hughey Johnson and the assistant
principal of Lexington High School
George Warren, were among the
community representatives

‘The purpose of the organization is
to bring together W&L’s community
with the community at large, espec-

ially the biack community,’ said
William Rhinehart, secretary of-
SABU and one of the five W&L stu-
dents at the meeting.

“I saw Dr. Pleasants on the street
one day, and we decided to call a
meeting,’ he added

The problem of isolation was ad-
dressed at the meeting, Pleasants
said, but no decision was made on
what action to take.

‘“‘We may have another meeting
with them, or we may have some
type of social gathering,’’ he added.
“Tt may include the black cadets” at
Virginia Military Institute

What ‘‘disturbed’’ him about the
newspaper article, he said, was that
students said they had no contact
with black leaders in Lexington. That
could lead to their not having enough
role models, he said

He said the organization would do
‘whatever those fellows think the
black community could do to make
them feel better about this town.”’

Rhinehart said the students might
work with the Big Brothers program
in town. Another meeting might be
held this week, hesaid

“I figured it would be a close one,”
Caruthers said of the race between
him and Black, a junior representa-
tive to the EC. Both are from Shreve-
port, La.

Focus on belt-tightening
includes the Catalogue

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

A special ad hoc committee headed
by Professor H. Marshall Jarrett has
been created to study the possibility
of printing the University Catalogue
every other year rather than every
year, a move that could save an esti-
mated $5,000 a year.

Junior Bart Smith, the student re-
presentative to this committee, pre-
sented the proposal to the Executive
Committee Monday night.

“Some hate it, some don’t care, but
there has been no overwhelming re-
sponse in favor of the proposal,”
Smith said.

The proposal was originally
brought up by Dean of the College
John W. Elrod, who suggested a com-
mittee be set up to look into the possi-
bility of a biennial catalog. In addi-
tion, the committee is weighing
methods of simplifying the catalog.

Part of this scaling-down would in-
clude eliminating out-of-date faculty
listings, the student register, and
class period listing. At least 10 per-
cent of the period listings are chang-
ed before the term starts, Smith said.

However, most of the students feel

gets third rep

by 3-1 margin

From Staff Reports

 

 

A third Law School representative
will be added to the Executive Com-
mittee in the fall, bringing the total
EC membership to 13.

The additional representative
came about as a result of a positive
vote by students this week on a
referendum to amend the student bo-
dy constitution. Of the 942 students
voting on the referendum, 704, or 74.7
percent, supported it.

This was 76 votes more than the re-
quired two-thirds minimum for the
referendum to pass.

Also, at least half of the student
body had to vote on the referendum
for it to pass. The 942 votes represent-
ed 56.4 percent of the student body.

As expected, the Law School gave
overwhelming support to the amend-
ment. Of the 244 law students voting,
only four, or 1.6 percent, opposed it.

The amendment received about a
2-1 nod of approval on _ the
undergraduate campus.

The new EC member will repre-
sent the second-year law class, which
previously shared a representative
with the third-year law class.

Count that one down

the catalog is an integral part of pro-
spective students’ primary impres-
sion of the students and the campus,
Smith said.

Registrar Harold S. Head said, ‘‘I
see advantages and disadvantages.”

The obvious advantage, according
to Head, would be the savings. How-
ever, Head stressed that a scaled-
down, biennial catalog would not be
an effective recruiting tool.

‘As far as cutting down on faculty
workload, it seems that the faculty
would have to do a schedule any-
way,” Head said. “Besides, every
student gets a catalog when it comes
out, but most of them will lose it
within a year. I think students and
faculty use the catalog a great deal.”’

Jarrett said it would be premature
to indicate whether the plan will be
approved. ‘We are still getting input
from the alumni, the faculty, and the
students,” he added. ‘‘We haven't
gone over the information yet. We
may decide to do nothing.”

Senior EC representative David
Jonson said Monday that the student
register should not be removed.

“I remember when | was planning
to go to Washington and Lee, I was in-
terested in who was going to the
school from my area,” he said.

OPINION March 14, 1985

 

 

No bargain

‘““‘Money’s tight!’’ the English muffin commercial says.
How true that is, and perhaps nowhere is it more applicable
than here at Washington and Lee.

In recent months, we have seen many money-saving ideas
come from the Treasurer’s office or the President’s office.
Almost without exception, the ideas have been sharply criti-
cized. Tempers have flared, and students have accused the
administration of being unscrupulous in trying to find the
golden fleece.

Attempts to save money by turning off lights along the Col-
onnade or in the Warner Center at night or by curbing the
library’s 24-hour schedule have met with stiff resistance
from all sides. Now comes another silly idea to save dollars.

Consider the University Catalogue issue. Dean John W. EI-
rod, surveying his budget, noticed that almost $5,000 could be
saved each year if the University published the catalog every
other year rather than every year. Part of this plan would re-
quire the dropping of the class schedules from the catalog.
Faculty, currently listed twice in the catalog, would be
restricted to seeing their name in print only once. The listing
of present students and recent graduates would be elimi-
nated as well in an attempt to cut back on the size of the cata-
log. All this, we are told would be of tremendous aid to the
University’s bank account.

Somehow, the logic behind such a proposal eludes us. The
administration says such a move would conserve valuable
faculty time since they would not have to worry about filling
in registrar forms for the new catalog every fall. Yet, when
students come knocking on faculty doors during registration
week without knowing when or if the class they desire meets
the following term, time would be ill-spent searching for such
information. Students who might wish to plan ahead would be
discouraged from doing so since no definite class hours would
be listed. Currently, because less than 10 percent of the class
hours change between the time of the catalog publication and
the registration week, such a move seems dubiously helpful.
Even the need for early publication of the master schedules
(those infamous green and yellow and pink sheets stuffed in
faculty mailboxes the week preceding registration) would
amount toa substantial cost for the University.

While the program seems well intended and indeed might
save some money, is it worth the resulting confusion and ad-
ditional work on everyone’s behalf?

Along with the foolhardy proposal to close the library at
night to save the costs of lighting the five levels (while we
decide to plant lampposts around the campus to better il-
luminate the walkways) and other inevitable future attempts
at fiscal conservatism, the catalog proposal deserves rapid
appraisal and even more rapid rejection.

The solution to our financial woes does not necesarily lie in
trimming alone. Under the guidance of a president gifted
with the ability to raise funds, the University saw rapid
growth between 1968 and 1982. Buildings were constructed
and renovated with President Huntley at the helm. The infu-
sion of nearly $70 million helped the University tremendous-
ly. Today, a similar campaign for the preservation of educa-
tional standards and programs unique to a school our size
would aid our fiscal woes. With the need for additional facul-
ty members for the romance languages and for renovations
to buildings in preparation for the women next fall, money
will be hard to come by. A new drive for capital might hold
the answer for our looming financial hard times.

In our zeal to trim and cut, we must also be sensible and
use that most obvious (and yet seemingly ever absent) of in-
tuitions — common sense. As students, we need to listen care-
fully to the proposals set before us. As students, we need to
suggest alternatives where we disagree. There is indeed
room to save, but finding the room might mean we have to
squeeze a bit tighter together.

Correction

 

An Editors’ Note that preceded a
Letter to the Editor by Steven Pock-
rass in last week’s Ring-tum Phi con-
tained a reference to Pockrass’ em-
ployment history with the news-
paper. Journalism Professor Clark
Mollenhoff says the sentence was ‘“‘a
cheap shot.” We agree, and would
like to set the record straight.

We decided that stating Pockrass
had been ‘dismissed from the staff
for cause’’ would be less damaging to
Pockrass than going into a litany of
reasons that had been made clear to
him and that were none of anyone
else’s business.

Mollenhoff feels it was a poor deci-
sion. ‘Either be specific or keep your
mouth shut,”’ he said. The latter op-
tion would have been the preferrable
one.

We felt that simply stating a fact
was more fair than going into an area
that was a matter of opinion. That

was a bad call — the fact was better
left unstated.

We also wish to clarify the se-
quence of events involving the letter.
The letter was submitted before the
relationship was terminated. The let-
ter did not cause his dismissal, but
did precede it chronoligically.

The decision to fire Pockrass was
based on a disagreement over his
performance and not on his charac-
ter. Mollenhoff said the note last
week might have given the impress-
ion that Pockrass was engaged in ac-
tivity that was ‘“‘unethical or repre-
hensible.’’ He was not. Any implica-
tion to that effect was in error. The
editors apologize.

Political machine gears up

 

MY VIEW

By Mike

 

 

 

McAlevey

 

It’s that time again, the innocent
sobriety of Fancy Dress is interrupt-
ed by the tumultuous uproar of the
American political machine kicking
into gear. Garish banners flutter in
the breeze, the sheer multiplicity of
which transforms W&L into a low
rent slum where a quarter is far too
much to waste on drying linens.
Small 8-by-11 parchments cluster
near main thoroughfares so dense
that all are rendered indistinguish-
able and consequently ineffectual.
For a select handful of aspiring yup-
pies, time pauses and dreams are
fulfilled and shattered, yet for most
of us it’s just pomp, it’s cir-
cumstance, it’s Americana at its
finest, it’s EC elections.

Why, it was just today that I asked
a young, indigent, dirty-faced kid
with a baseball cap on what he want-
ed to be. You know what that young-
ster said? ‘I want to be the supreme
master of time, space and dimension
and then run for W&L student body
president.’’ Damned if I wasn’t
shocked. Tears pumped rythmically
down my cheeks as a distant ‘‘Hail to
the Chief’’ sounded, so blurry was my
vision that I could hardly see the
boy’s smiling face as I issued him
$100 and pushed him into Alvin-
Dennis, where all future EC mem-
bers start their wardrobe. Can't look
shabby, you know; after all it’s the
way you dress, not the way you think,
that gets you elected.

The boy grew inquisitive as to the
nature of elections, so I ushered him
up to the Hill and we jointly inquired.
‘“‘Why do so many people seemingly
plot out a course across this campus
avoiding the polls?’”’ he asked. I

guess his infantile mind just couldn't
comprehend all the good reasons
mine could. Like No. 1, that no stu-
dent of prudence and high stature
would put his name on a list support-
ing something as radical as a second-
year law rep. ‘What's a rep?”’ asked
my partner. ‘‘Oh, it’s like what your
sister has around town,” I said. I fur-
ther showed him how illegible most
of the 10 signatures were on the
sheet. Some people just won't put
their old John Hancock clearly on
paper. ‘I know who that is,’’ he said,
“and he sure does have a flamboyant
signature for an insurance sales-
man.”

Overwhelmed by the prodigy’s wit
I moved him across campus so that
he might hear some political banter.
“Who gives a----who wins’”’ was one
rather candid exclamation we heard
from a group of students. I refrained
from approaching them for I knew
they were too immersed in contem-
plating how much fungus and marine

life really exist in one of those leather
high tops used to stabilize any partic-
ular banner. My political dynamo,
however, didn’t hesitate to approach
the hostile crowd and ask, ‘‘Hey, why
do you demonstrate such flagrant
disrespect for so important an event
as an election?’ ‘‘Yo, kid, what are
you, a walking test? Now beat it be-
fore I wipe that dirt off your face with
a hatchet.”’ I quickly intervened and
drew him to the front of the Com-
merce School, where I hoped we
might find some real political think-
ers. Imagine the pleasure I exper-
ienced when I heard ‘Well, Skippy,
my political allegiance, if you will,
per se, remains with so and so,”’ “‘He
stands where I stand, come on, let’s
vote.’’ Before they were more than
two steps away, the young leader
stopped the primary interlocutor and
inquired, ‘“‘Where do both you and
your candidate stand?’’ The best
answer this pseudo-Wall Streeter
could generate was that they bought
their clothes in the same place

(Alvin-Dennis) and so and so could
throw down brew like no one else.
Completely disappointed,the poor
boy tu. aed and walked off campus.

Upon making him return the
clothes (you know they cost a lot), I
had to ask that pervading question,
‘What is your estimation of our poli-
tical climate during student body
elections?” ‘‘Well’’ he replied, ‘‘it
seems as though a large number of
your students don’t vote and do not
possess a reason for not doing so.
Further, those of your students who
do seemingly do so for all the wrong
reasons. I'm poor, my Dad shoots
pool for a living, but that humble way
of life stands safely apart from the
stench of lethargy and hypocrisy I
have smelled today.” As the boy
turned, a yelling fool ran by exclaim-
ing that our infamous so and so had
prevailed. I paused, yelled and threw
the $100 worth of political protocol,
hoping the child might find some use
for it.

Newspaper

READERS’
ADVOCATE
By Peter Wright

Last week, The Ring-tum Phi, its
editors and the general role of our
school paper were put into question.
A former Phi reporter, Steve Pock-
rass, had submitted a ‘‘Letter to the
Editor’ expressing his personal com-
plaints and criticisms involving some
of the actions and policies by the Phi
editors, Bruce Potter and Mike Allen.
Pockrass was still working for the
paper at the time he submitted the
letter, which was headlined ‘‘Does
the Phi lack initiative, direction?”
The editors fired Pockrass that very
same day for ‘‘cause.”’

Pockrass was not the first reporter
to have a run-in or major disagree-
ment with the Phi editors this year.
There was also Mike Hudson, who
had agreed to write the Readers’ Ad-
vocate column for The Phi. He decid-
ed later not to write the article fol-
lowing some disagreements with The
Phi and its policies, which were out-
lined in Pockrass’ letter.

Since that letter was published last
week, a lot of criticism has surfaced
concerning The Phi. I’ve heard harsh
comments from those who work for
The Phi as well as from the general
student body. Both editors admit
they are aware of the complaints and
want to address them. That has a lot
to do with why there is now a Read-
ers’ Advocate column.

In short, two very capable journa-
lists are no longer working for The
Phi because they can’t come to grips
with the editors and their policies.
The frustrations of these two report-
ers came to light with last week’s let-
ter. However, there was something
else accompanying that letter — an
‘Editors’ Note,’’ of all things. This
note, which immediately preceded
the letter itself, appeared to be a

 

templating suicide. It may be true
that those who talk about it are not
serious, but when someone tells me
that they want out, I choose to take it
seriously.

My friend had not been happy at
school last year but convinced him-
self to return in the fall. According to
him it was a miserable semester. I
wouldn’t know because he stopped
answering my letters. Perhaps that
was a clue I should have picked up
on, but I didn’t. He told me over the
phone that it was his mother and

father who talked him into returning
to school in January, not he. He want-
ed nothing more than to go down to
Australia and work on a horse farm.

Without hesitation I told him to go
to Australia. I would rather have him
down under than six feet under-
ground.

It hurt me to hear my friend talk
this way, but I was relieved that he
felt he could talk to someone. It is so
important to be able to reach out and
let someone know how you feel.

What could be so bad that someone

would want to call it quits? The po-
tential for accomplishing great
things would be gone. What would
this world be like if people such as
Mother Theresa and Pope John Paul
II decided they wanted to end their
lives? I’m not saying that every per-
son who contemplates suicide will
acheive greatness, but if they suc-
ceed in killing themselves we will
never know what may have been.
God gave us ears with which to hear
others, but do we really listen to what
they are saying?

Do jokes constitute harassment?

To the Editors:

It was with great amusement that I
read the article on sexual harass-
ment in the March 7 issue. While I
fully expected the Coeducation Steer-
ing Committee to spew forth such vit-
riolic swill as the sexual harassment
policy statement, I was totally unpre-
pared for Mrs. Simpson’s comment
that certain remarks would be
considered forms of sexual harass-
ment and would fall under Title IX of
the Education Act of 1972. I can see
the headlines now: ‘‘Student Jokes

scrutinized

disclaimer of the harsh criticism of
The Phi in the letter. The ‘Note’
stated “the letter contained a num-
ber of charges based on incomplete,
distorted information.” One problem
with this sweeping statement is not
only does it fail to specify what was
“incomplete” and ‘‘distorted,”’ but it
also fails to recognize some of the
valid points which were contained in
the letter. ‘“‘The temptation was
either to not print the letter or to
rebut it,”” the “Note” said. “The
editors should not have the last
word.” As it turns out, the editors
still attacked the article and in this
instance had the first word.

Potter said the ‘‘Editors’ note’ was
meant to inform the readers that
Pockrass was no longer working with
the Phi, which permitted him to write
a letter to the editor. My argument to
the editors is: ‘Why didn’t you just
run a sentence or two at the end of the
letter explaining the situation?’
After all, it’s not the editors’ column;
it’s the public’s. In short, the editors
chose to tell the public that this par-
ticular letter was ‘‘distorted’’ and
‘incomplete’ before they could get
to the first sentence. Do the editors
check every letter to see if any of the
information could possibly be dis-
torted or imcomplete?

Now, to check on the accuracy of
the letter. First, there’s Pockrass
and his complaints that it was ‘‘sheer
hyprocrisy”’ for the Phi not to con-
duct its analysis of Executive Com-
mittee members because the govern-
mental body didn’t do anything. I join
with Mr. Pockrass.

Another complaint by Pockrass
centered on The Phi’s decision not to
use one of his stories which had been
published in the Roanoke Times &
World-News. The article focused on
blacks at Washington and Lee and
their frustrations with the atmos-
phere at W&L. It’s no secret that the
Dean of Minority Affairs at W&L,
John White, is to be terminated at the

About Women Drivers; Justice De-
partment to Prosecute.”’

If Mrs. Simpson had any fleeting
association with the real world (ad-
mittedly a rare occurrence in acade-
mia), she would know that Title IX,
which is meant to prevent sexual dis-
crimination in education, applies on-
ly to institutions receiving federal
assistance, and not to individuals.

As former Darmouth student Jef-
frey Hart recently wrote, ‘One thing
is certain. ‘Women’ will disappoint
the feminists just as the ‘workers’

disappointed the old Marxists...the
‘liberation’ will be indefinitely post-
poned. They are likely to ruin a few
universities, however.”’ How true.

We are certainly lucky that this
sloppily worded policy has not been
implemented. I, for one, would pro-
bably have been expelled for refer-
ring to the Dean as ‘‘Mrs. Simpson,”’
which implies marriage and, there-
fore ‘speculates about her virgin-
ie

over editorial decision

end of the year. Some students are
upset over this. Consequently, the
article concerning the blacks and
their frustrations had some timely
news value to the community.

But, as indicated in the letter, The
Phi didn’t run the article because it
was printed in the Roanoke Times. So
what? The important thing is to in-
form your community about the con-
ditions surrounding blacks at W&L.
In concentrating all its attention on
the competition, The Phi simply ig-
nored its public. The editors have
since assigned a follow-up story
about blacks at W&L.

The latter portion of Pockrass’ let-
ter concentrated on the relationship
between The Phi editors and Mike
Hudson, the original Readers’ Ad-
vocate columnist. Hudson wrote his
first article, referring to the accom-
plishments of The Phi and Allen par-
ticularly for getting an exclusive in-
terview with Scot Mesner last fall.
Hudson said he did not submit the
article because Potter and Allen
wanted to take some information out
of it. But, according to the editors,
they merely wanted to discuss and
question some of the information and
had no intention of deleting it without
Hudson’s approval. It appears this
incident could have been resolved
with a little understanding.
Nevertheless, The Phi should not
have any interest in even questioning
the content of a Readers’ Advocate
column, It’s not their column. The
column is designed to provide a
forum for the students to discuss,
analyze and critique the actions of
The Phi.

One subject that has not been ex-
plained is why The Phi fired Steve
Pockrass in the first place. After all,
he was one of The Phi’s more exper-
ienced reporters. Although Pockrass
was fired hours after he submitted
the letter, the editors say the letter
had nothing to do with it. According
to Allen, The Phi fired Pockrass for

four reasons. First, Pockrass’s re-
porting was ‘“‘getting worse, instead
of better,’ Allen said. Pockrass often
turned in stories without leads and
his work was ‘constantly inade-
quate,’’ Allen said. Still, Allen prais-
ed some of the work Pockrass did for
the Roanoke Times. Secondly, Allen
said the editors and Pockrass had a
disagreement concerning some of the
basics of journalism. Allen said
Pockrass wrote stories based on
subjective and opinionated ideas.
“We couldn’t trust him,”’ Allen said.
Thirdly, Allen said Pockrass violated
some of the standards of the paper,
such as consistently missing dead-
lines. In addition, Allen said there
was no reason to continue the rela-
tionship between Pockrass and The
Phi because he was unhappy and was
only hurting the paper by staying on.
Lastly, Allen said there were some
personal differences between them.
To get around this, Allen offered the
competitive EC beat to Pockrass.
‘*We knew he was good, and we want-
ed to keep him,” Allen said. But
things just didn’t work out.

As for Mr. Pockrass, he seems con-
tent with this whole ordeal. Pockrass
said he just wanted to help the paper
improve itself. He said he has al-
ready noticed progress.

The Phi has indeed made some

accomplishments as well. The edi-
tors must face their downfalls and
confront them, not hide them. As was
pointed out in the so called ‘‘Editors’
Note,” Potter and Allen are serious
in their conviction to providing a for-

there is, but The Phi now appears to
be taking some of its initiative and

On-campus housing the only alternative

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
' Staff Reporter

 

Students who did not confirm their

‘on-campus University housing by
' Tuesday may find that their rooms

have been reassigned.
However, some options, including

. off-campus housing, do remain for

students who have not lined up any

’ on-campus housing.

Getting on the waiting list for on-
campus housing as soon as possible is

’ the advice of the Office of University
, Services.

* dous,”

“The waiting list can be tremen-
said Director William N.

. Mohler, ‘but not necessarily reflec-

tive.”
In past years, students who seemed

, to have no chance of getting a room

on campus have found themselves

' signing a contract for a Woods Creek
. apartment or a Lee House room.

This is because students with room

‘ assignments often change their
. minds about housing plans during the

spring, Mohler explained
Some students may not have even

. considered their living arrangements

for next year despite the Feb. 1 ap-

* plication deadline for on-campus
. housing.

But Mohler said he would never
turn down a student’s application. ‘I

_ try to work with them as much as I

.

can,” he said.

Bonnie Walker, who works in the
Office of University Services, could
not say for sure the chances of a stu-
dent applying for housing at this
point and getting a room for next
year.

“It’s going to be hard,”’ she said.
“But then again, you never can tell.
It’s one of those things.”

On-campus housing for W&L

includes Woods Creek apartments,
Lee House II, the Minority Center
and the International House.

University-owned housing, ex-
cluding dormitories, can accom-
modate 210 students, and about 16
percent of upperclass under-
graduates liveon campus.

Woods Creek Apartments accom-
modate three, four or five students,
and the cost each academic year
ranges from $960 for a double to
$1,575 for the most expensive single,
including utilities.

‘I’m inclined to prefer our people
live on campus,”’ said Mohler, point-
ing out that some of the advantages
of the apartments are their kitchen
facilities, freedom and ‘‘together-
ness.”

In October, 126 upperclassmen liv-
ed in the 178-bed complex, which was
built in 1975 at a cost of $1.76 million.
Law students rented the other rooms.

Lee House II, owned by the Univer-
sity, has been used for a number of
years mainly as upperclass housing
but sometimes for freshman over-
flow.

The facility includes three single
rooms ($1,270 a year) and nine
doubles ($845 a year).

The Minority Center, next to Lee II
on Lee Avenue, houses three students
in single rooms at $1,380 a year. Two
students share a double at $960 a year
each.

The specialized use of the original
Lee I for minorities began in recent
years.

The final on-campus option for up-
perclassmen is the International
House on Washington Street, two
doors from Gilliam Dormitory.

This facility is headquarters to
W&L’s International Club and is
often the scene of meetings and par-

‘“‘We help integrate international
students into the University commu-
nity,’’ said Michael Wacht, a sopho-
more who currently resides in the
Louse. ‘We give them a place to
come and hang out,”’ he said.

Lu Chang from China lives in the
house this year, and three interna-
tional students from Brazil, Belgium
and Hong Kong will reside there next
year.

A single room costs $1,380 a year
and a double costs $960.

‘“‘We have six beds, two baths, one
kitchen, two doors — I haven’t count-

in protest of that company’s involve-
ment in South Africa has been post-
poned in light of information recently
received by protest organizers.

W&L law Professor William S. Gei-
mer said he received a call from IBM
in response to a letter he wrote the
company inquiring about its sale of
computers and other machines to
South African police and military or-

“ ganizations. Geimer had asked IBM

to confirm reports that it controls 70
percent of the computer market in
South Africa, and to withdraw the

- part of its computer business that is

used by that country’s security

" forces.

During the phone call, Geimer
said, an IBM representative told him

"that the company had ceased sales in
. South Africa. On the basis of that in-

formation, the group planning the
protest has decided to postpone its

’ plans.

-

«

Geimer, associate religion Profes-

sor Harlan R. Beckley and law Pro-
fessor Athornia Steele had organized
a protest, originally scheduled for
tomorrow, to ask that the University
Board of Trustees withdraw its in-
vestments in IBM to protest that
company’s business involvement in
South Africa, whose government fol-
lows the white-supremacist policy of
apartheid.

To ensure a sense of fairness, Gei-
mer said, he drafted a letter to IBM
to verify reports that the company
was involved in assisting the South
African police and security organiza-
tions, particularly in their ad-
ministration of the ‘‘pass system”
that regulates the movements of the
black majority population. Reported-
ly, IBM’s computers are used to run
this system.

Further information regarding
IBM’s involvement, or disinvolve-
ment, in South Africa is being sent to
Geimer, he said.

The response from IBM is a good
sign, Geimer said, because it shows
that efforts such as the one planned
here at Washington and Lee have
been successful on other campuses

Dawson gets job offer

 

From Staff Reports

 

While many Washington and Lee
seniors are scrambling for some-
thing to do after they graduate, stu-

* dent body President Cole Dawson is

among those who can rest a little
easier.

“It’s very nice to have several op-
tions,” he said.

Two weeks ago, Dawson was of-

" fered a position with the investment

firm of Smith Barney, and he has
been accepted by the Southern
Methodist University law school.

He said he will likely accept a
banking job and then return to school

" ina few years.

* said.

“Tf I really like investment bank-
ing, I’ll go on to business school,”’ he
“Otherwise, I'll go to law

. school.”’

If Dawson accepts the Smith
Barney position, he would be in their

_ corporate financial analyst program,

which lasts for two years. There is no
commitment after that time, and he

_ would be free to go to graduate '

si

school.

In the analyst program, ‘‘you doa
lot of research and study for the
associates, partners and vice
presidents,’’ he said.

He added that the analysts put ina
70-90 hour week. “It’s a lot of
weekends and staying a lot of nights
until one, three or five in the morn-
ing,’’ he explained.

‘Personality plays into it a lot,” he
continued. ‘‘They want very aggres-
sive, very dependable people. Being
articulate is definitely a criteria.”

Dawson has been accepted for a
program this summer in which he
will lead a group of 15 high school
students on van and bike tours of
Europe. He will work there for six to
seven weeks, and then spend some
time in Europe on his own.

across the country. There is a net-
work of organizations that monitors
American business activities in
South Africa, Geimer said, and he is
depending on these groups as well as
the information from IBM to confirm
IBM’s claim.

Many protests across the country
develop in this sort of grass-roots
manner, according toa recent article
in Newsweek magazine. Demonstra-
tions in some 20 cities have taken
place, the most notable in front of the
South African embassy in Washing-
ton, D.C. The Washington Post this
week put: the number of anti-apart-
heid demonstrators arrested at the
embassy at 1,442, many of them con-
gressmen, celebrities and national
figures, including Sen. Lowell
Weicker, the wife of Washington
Mayor Marion Barry, Stevie Wonder,
the children of the late Sen. Robert F’.
Kennedy and, on Monday, the Rev.
Jesse L. Jackson and two of his sons.

Geimer said the campaign at
Washington and Lee will be delayed,
out of fairness to IBM, until April or
May while organizers examine the
new information about IBM’s in-
volvement in South Africa.

Girard allowed
to leave state

Senior Gene Girard, charged
March 1 with possession of co-
caine with intent to distribute it,
has been allowed to return to his
home near Miami.

The terms of his bail required
that he obtain court permission to
leave Virginia.

Lexington General District
Judge Joseph E. Hess granted the
request last Wednesday. Girard is
required to return for his prelimi-
nary hearing April 19.

Rockbridge County Sheriff's
Sergeant R.W. Hall said Girard
was arrested at the East Lexing-
ton grocery store with one ounce
of cocaine.

individual needs.

A housing survey conducted in the
fall shows that more than 50 percent
of upperclassmen rent houses and
apartments in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

According to the survey results,
nearly 70 percent of students pay
monthly rents of $100 and under.

Lisa Householder, a Lexington re-
sident who works at the Hodge Podge
on Main Street, recently found
herself an apartment in town.

Householder found that most peo-
ple don’t advertise when they want to
rent out a room or apartment be-
cause they try to be selective about
their tenants.

“They don’t want people who are

too wild,”’ she said.

Householder said she began her
hunt with a list of 15 names gathered
“by word-of-mouth.’ She found the
telephone to be a great resource
since she did not ‘‘actively’’ go out
and look at many apartments.

“Most of them struck me down
pretty quickly,’’ she said, but added
that spring’s high turnover would
probably be a better time to look.

University Services offers students
a small file of apartments for rent in
Lexington.

“The list changes constantly and is
hard to keep current,”’ Mohler said,
“but it is in some semblance of
order.”’

The cards on file include names of

for rent and the rental prices.

Several Lexington-area real estate
agents also help students find apart-
ments androoms.

Alice Strecker, rental manager for
Mead Associates, said she handles
mainly two-bedroom but also one-
bedroom apartments with rental
costs in the $150 to $300 range.

Strecker, who does not charge a
fee, said she does not have many
available since most have been rent-
ed.

Another off-campus option is the
Lampost, a Christian housing center
located at 202 S. Randolph St.

‘‘We make a commitment to grow
together in Christ,” said Robert
Dorais, a senior at the house.

Students are assigned house jobs,
such as taking out the garbage, shop-
ping for groceries, planning menus
and cleaning bathrooms. The stu-
dents eat together three nights a
week and must make their beds
every day.

The Lexington Organization for
Religious Development (LORD)
operates the Lampost and charges
$90 a month plus a $5 monthly living
cost and a $5 monthly insurance fee.
These expenses do not include elec-
tricity, gas or phone bills.

The Lampost is open to anyone who
wants to make the commitment, ac-
cording to Dorais. Seven of the 10
rooms are still available for next
school year.

“We don’t want to go around re-
cruiting people,’’ Dorais said. ‘It’s
all voluntary.”

The Dutch Inn on Washington
Street is very popular among stu-
dents because it is located less than
one block from the main campus. In-
terested students should contact Nit-
za Macheras at 463-3835.

Kappa Sigma’s kitchen ‘trashed’

 

From Staff Reports

 

The kitchen of Kappa Sigma frater-
nity house was ‘‘trashed’’ Saturday
night, likely by another fraternity,
Kappa Sig President John Haywood
said.

He estimated the damage from the
action, in which food was strewn
around the ktichen while the house
was unoccupied, at $500.

“The indication is that it was
another fraternity,’’ he said. ‘‘It was
obviously a malicious act of van-
dalism aimed at the house. In all
likelihood, it was a past or présent

member of another fraternity.”

He said the Interfraternity Council
and Student Affairs Committee are
investigating the incident.

“I can’t speculate on who might
have done it,’’ Haywood said. ‘‘We do
not know at this time for sure who did
it. | would hate to wrongly implicate
someone.”

“We're still investigating it,’’ IFC
President David Perdue said after
Tuesday’s Judicial Board meeting.
‘We haven’t gotten to the bottom of
it.”

Haywood said some individuals

Athletics adapting to women

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Adaptation of the athletic depart-
ment’s facilities, staff and programs
in order to provide women with an
athletic and physical education pro-
gram next year is proceeding rapid-
ly.

Women will compete in five indi-
vidual intercollegiate sports next
year, and women will take the same
physical education courses as men,
Athletic Director William D. McHen-
ry said.

Provisions for two additional team
locker rooms, a division of the main
physical education locker room into
men’s and women’s locker rooms,
additional tennis courts and addi-
tional playing fields have also been
either implemented or planned.

An assistant athletic director, Cin-
da Rankin, has been hired to coordi-
nate women’s athletic activities and
will start work in two weeks, and a
female intern in athletic training will
be hired by the fall, McHenry said.

‘We're right on target,”” McHenry
said, He said he had anticipated the
Board of Trustees’ approval of coed-

ucation and had begun making preli-
minary plans for a women’s athletic
program more than a year ago. In
September he appointed a committee
on coeducation in the athletic depart-
ment that met regularly this fall,
McHenry said.

During the first.two years of coed-
ucation, the athletic department will
field women in individual sports
teams such as cross country, track
and field, swimming and diving, ten-
nis and golf, McHenry said. He added
that women’s teams could be fielded
in those sports with minimal changes
in facilities and with the coaches of
the men’s teams doubling as coaches
for the corresponding women’s team.

McHenry reported that the results

women accepted for Early Admis-
sion shows that the major interest of
those women seems to be in cross
country, swimming and tennis. On
the other hand, even if only one or
two freshmen women want to play
golf next year, for instance, they still
will have the chance to compete, Mc-
Henry said.

The athletic department will grad-
ually add team sports for women
over a period of five to 10 years. The
choice of first sports to be added will
depend largely on the level of interest
of the women, McHenry said. The
department will try to gear its inter-
collegiate program to the needs of
the women at W&L, McHenry added.

Women's teams will compete in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
as W&L’s men’s team do, he said.

McHenry said he hoped that within
two or three years the school will be
able to field women’s basketball and
volleyball teams. He noted that the
new assistant athletic director, Ran-
kin, is a basketball coach.

No expansion in the size of the phy-
sical education department coaching
staff is planned, and any women
coaches who are hired will be
brought in through normal attrition
of the existing staff, McHenry said.
He said that several of the men on the
staff could help coach women’s
teams.

McHenry said that it is hoped the
school will not have to drop any exist-
ing sports due to a decrease in inter-
est, and added that he could not think
of any sport that would be in danger
in the future.

In intramural athletics, the depart-
ment will have some all-male intra-

mural sports, some all-female intra- _

murals and some coed intromural
sports, McHenry said.

All physical education courses will
be open to both men and women, and
there will be no changes in the Uni-
versity’s physical education require-
ments, McHenry said.

4 students’ money stolen from dorms, frats

 

From Staff Reports

 

Half a dozen offenses against
students, including thefts from dor-
mitory and fraternity rooms, were
reported in Lexington last week,
Police Chief L.0. Sutton said.

eMatthew Upton reported that his
wallet was stolen from Graham-Lees
room 154 last Wednesday. While he
was in-the shower between. 9:50 and
10 pam., someone entered the room
and took the wallet from a desk
drawer, he said.

It contained $70 in currency, two
credit cards, five blank checks and a
student ID card. Police advised him
to search trash cans in the building,
and he found the wallet had been
discarded in a restroom, Sutton said.
The only item missing from the
wallet was one $20 bill.

¢David Barnette reported the theft
of $80 from a wallet in Graham-Lees
room 206 between Tuesday afternoon
and Thursday evening. The door had
been left open, Sutton said.

In addition to the division of the
main locker room into men’s and wo-
men’s locker rooms, two additional
team locker rooms will be provided
by moving the men’s faculty locker
room and the coach’s locker room,
McHenry said.

Work on the division of the main
locker room will begin June 1, as
soon as the students leave, McHenry
said. Additional lockers will be added
to accomodate the increased size of
the freshman class, McHenry said.

Additional tennis courts already
have been provided through the re-
novation of the lower tennis courts
below the footbridge this fall.

Two or three additional outside
athletic fields will be needed in the
coming years to accomodate wo-
men’s field hockey, lacrosse and soft-
ball teams, McHenry reported. Plans
for these fields have not been approv-
ed yet, but McHenry is recommend-
ing that these fields be added in the
area between U.S. 60 and Liberty
Hall.

At Wilson Field, the school is con-
sidering adding more rest rooms and
locker space, McHenry said.

He added that the school is also
considering plans to turn the track at
Wilson Field into an all-weather
track by converting it into an artifi-
cial surface with a rubberized tex-
ture. At present, the track is unus-
able during the winter, McHenry

Scholars

program

beginning to draw
disciplines closer

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Until now, an English major could
get a 4.0 and never know a chemistry
major with similar academic creden-
tials.

But the formation of a new pro-
gram at Washington and Lee is help-
ing to bring “aggressively intellec-
tual’’ students from different fields of
study together in a formal atmos-
phere.

Known as the University Scholars
Program, it combines studies in the
liberal arts with courses in the stu-
dent’s major in a ‘four-year honors
program,” according to H. Thomas
Williams Jr., chairman of the Uni-
versity Scholars Committee and an
associate professor of physics.

Williams said the University creat-
ed the program because many of the
school’s brighter students felt ‘‘iso-
lated.”’

“Prior to the creation of the pro-
gram, you would have a very bright
student who would end up as a chem-
istry major who didn’t know a bright
English major,’’ he said. ‘‘Our goal
with this program was forming a
mass of students who were eager to
learn and letting them know who
each other are.”

To meet this goal, the program has
a curriculum that promotes open dis-
cussion between students and with
faculty members and distinguished
visitors brought to campus.

That curriculum consists of a read-
ing course and a coordinating hu-
manities seminar in the freshman
year, seminars in the natural social

and right front door were damaged
by a sharp object scraping into the
paint. “It wasn’t an accident,” he
said. ‘‘To get all that, it would have to
be deliberate.”’

Sutton said that overall Fancy
Dress weekend seemed to go very
well.

“T have heard some remarks that
this Fancy Dress was one of the most
orderly and well-handled that have
been around for awhile,”’ he said.

The weekend, however, was not
without its problems, Sutton added.
“T think the conditions of trash and
broken bottles on sidewalks and in
the street or strewn in front of the

Three Ring-tum Phi staff members
won first-place awards and the news-
paper finished second overall in its
circulation greup in the 1984 Virginia
Intercollegiate Mass Communica-
tions Association journalism compet-
ition

The competition covered news-
papers published during the 1983-84
year. The Phi competed with other
Virginia college newspapers with
less than 3,000 circulation.

Chief Editor Mike Allen, then a
staff reporter, won first place in the
investigative reporting category for
his series of stories about the special
grand jury investigating drug traf-
ficking. Allen also received an honor-

sciences in the sophomore and junior
years, and honors courses and theses
in the senior year.

“I think the idea of the program is
great,” said Chris Carter, a sopho-
more from Chickasha, Okla. “To
have a course geared toward any in-
terdisciplinary study is a good idea.”’

Qualifications for participating in
the program are vague, Williams
said, but include scores on the Scho-
lastic Aptitude Test and involvement
in extracurricular and leadership ac-
tivities. There is no minimum re-
quirement for any of these categor-
ies, he added.

Most of all, the committee looks for
a desire to learn, he said.

“Students in University Scholars

are aggressive intellectually. They
have taken part in advance place-
ment program’s in high school and in
other learning experiences,” he said.
“They're the kind of people who get
excited over ideas.”

Matthew Harrington, a freshman,

said he is the kind of person that Wil- ,

liams described. ‘‘I’m interested in
learning a lot of things and Univer-
sity Scholars provides a lot of oppor-
tunities.”’

Created in 1983, the program began
this year. Sixteen students — 13
freshmen and three sophmores — are
currently in the program. Since Jan-
uary, they have been reading Virgil’s
“Aeneid” and other works to prepare
for a seminar titled ‘‘The Idea of the
Pilgrimage in English Literature.”

Fifteen students are expected to be
added to the program next year.
They will be selected from entering
freshmen and current freshmen and
sophomores.

“T think the fraternities should be a

some of this is a little out of hand and
unnecessary.”

Sutton said no legal action was °
taken against any fraternities as a
result of Fancy Dress parties.

“I think they were unnecessarily +

he said. “It was handled without
summons.” ’

“I want to see a lot of traditions

In the presidential race, Hollis and
Lewis defeated Patrick Hayden and
James White, also juniors, to qualify
for the runoff.

Lewis received 454 votes, or 46.6
percent; Hollis, 205 votes, 21 percent;
Hayden, 182 votes, 18.7 percent; and
White, 133 votes, 13.7 percent. The
top two vote-getters qualify for the
runoff unless one receives more than
50 percent of the votes.

 

In the secreterial race, Webb and |
Cooper defeated juniors Steve Best, °
Ted LeClercg and Sam Svalina. ‘

The votes were as follows: Webb,
285, 29.2 percent; Cooper, 226, 23.1
percent; LeClercq, 206, 21.1 percent; +
Best, 145, 14.8 percent; and Svalina, |
115, 11.8 percent.

Cooper actually finished behind Le- +
Clereq and Best in votes cast on the
undergraduate campus, but he won’
99 votes in the Law School to move in- «
to second place.

Senior David Hanna, co-chairman '

Durrette:
‘recapture

greatness’

 

By MIKE ALLEN

_ Chief Editor

 

Leading Republican gubernatorial
candidate Wyatt B. Durrette Jr. told
a Lexington audience Tuesday night
that his candidacy represents a
chance to ‘“‘recapture the greatness
of Virginia.”’

Durrette leads Republican oppo-
nent Congressman Stan E. Parris in
delegates, endorsements and contri-
butions. “‘What got us here was an
awful lot of hard work,” he told the
Rockbridge County Courthouse au-
dience of 50. ‘‘Any letup in that, and
things could change.”

After attending Virginia Military
Institute, Durrette graduated from
the Washington and Lee law school in
1964.

“| guess I get a little more serious
and reflective when I am brought to
Lexington, where so much of my past
has been,’’ he said at the forum spon-
sored by the Lexington-Rockbridge
Republican Committee.

He said that while he was proud of
the VMI experience, ‘“‘it wasn’t a
heck of a lot of fun during those four
years.”’

While he was at W&L, Durrette
founded the now-defunct W&L Con-
servative Society. Among his co-
founders was Donald W. Huffman,
now the chairman of the state Repub-
lican party.

“These next four years for Virginia
are going to be unique,” said Dur-
rette, a former member of the House
of Delegates who now practices law
in Richmond. ‘‘In these four years,
we will celebrate the bicentennial of
the ratification of the U. S. Constitu-
tion.”

 

By Bruce Potter/The Ringtum Phi

Republican gubernatorial candidate Wyatt Durrette addresses a Rockbridge County Courthouse gathering.

“In those days, Virginia was not a
leading state; it was the leading
state,”’ he continued. ‘‘The towering
geniuses of the Commonwealth were
unparalleled in any of the other
states collectively.”

He said in recent years Virginia
has slipped on some rankings of
states by economic growth and quali-
ty of educational program. ‘We're
better than that and we deserve to be
near the top,”’ he said. “I want with
you to together recapture the great-
ness of Virginia.”

Durrette said the Commonwealth
should be attractive to business be-
cause ‘believe it or not, we are a low-
tax state.”

He spoke of the state’s ‘‘excellent
educational system” and ‘‘the multi-
Plicity of talent at Virginia's univer-
sities.”’

One man in the audience prefaced
a question about the federal budget

deficit by admitting the subject was
something ‘‘I’m sure you’re sick of.”’

The deficit ‘‘is a time bomb waiting
to go off,”’ said Durrette, who added
that he supports a Constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced
budget.

He said that the GOP has “‘a very
good chance”’ of achieving a majori-
ty in the Democratically controlled
legislature in the near future.

Durrette was introduced by Lex-
ington mayor and W&L economics
Professor Charles F. Phillips Jr.
“There is tremendous enthusiasm
within the Republican party,” Phil-
lips said. ‘‘We have a number of first-
rate candidates.”

“T have already pledged my sup-
port...to the next governor of the
state of Virginia, Wyatt Durrette,”
he concluded.

“Thank you very much,”’ the can-
didate began. “‘That’s the nicest in-

troduction I could have had.”

“From Chuck Phillips,” said a
voice from the back of the room.

“From anybody,’’ Durrette re-
sponded immediately.

Commonwealth's Attorney Bever-
ly C. “John” Read shook hands cord-
ially and joked easily with members
of the audience, many of whom he
called by name.

When signups were being taken for
delegates to the upcoming state Re-
publican convention, one man gave
his name as Jim Jones. ‘Better
make that ‘James Jones,” said
Read, making reference to the cult
leader who led his followers to
suicide in South America.

One of Durrette’s proud supporters
introduced his companions to
a reporter as “prominent local Re-
publicans.”’

‘All Republicans are prominent,”’
his wife kidded.

“As usual in an institution that is
aggressive and committed to quality,

. there are more demands than you
-ean satisfy,’’ he continued. ‘‘We’re

trying to find what it is that we’re do-
ing that we needn’t do or that might
not be as important to our growth and

* . development.”’

For example, he said the ‘‘easy ac-

_ cess” students and faculty have to

University facilities overnight is a
nice luxury, ‘‘But is it necessary to
have five floors of the library burning
all night? I think it’s worth asking,”’

» hesaid.

Student Reaction: The catalog cut-
back suggestion received no positive
response at Monday’s EC meeting,
and the Library Advisory Commit-
tee, which includes student mem-
bers, voted unanimously last week to
recommend that the library main-
tain its 24-hour schedule.

Student Body President Cole Daw-
son said he and most students he’s
talked with disagree with both of
those savings possibilities.

“I think the students are opposed to
these changes,’’ he said. “If the ad-
ministration pursues these, it will
hear the students’ voice, because
they really affect student life on cam-
pus.”’

“It strikes me as strange that
they’re all coming now,” he said of
the possible economy measures. “I
think they’re just ideas. I don’t think
the administration is backing these
ideas.”’

Administrators Respond:

” University officials said that student

opinion is important to them, but
some express mild frustration with
the ‘rhetoric’? they say has
accompanied discussion of the cut-
back potentials.

Wilson said the administration is
“very responsive” to student senti-
ment and that it is “going to go slow-
ly” on any major change such as a
reduction in library hours.

“I think it is extraordinary that a
thing like that has received as much
attention as it has,” he said. ‘I was
simply asking the librarian for a
judgment on that.”

“T think it’s extraordinary for an
institution devoted to the develop-
ment of critica] intelligence to react
passionately to every proposal that
comes out,’’ he added.

“People say to me, ‘What is
$24,000?’ My answer is that that is a
faculty position at Washington and
Lee. That also buys several financial
aid packages. That’s what $24,000
ne

Elrod said student body opinion
“will not be ignored’ and that when
it comes to making a decision, stu-
dent views will be a ‘‘not inconse-
quential’’ consideration.

“We are not a bunch of money-
pinching Scotsmen who are trying to
save money for its own sake,” Elrod
said. ‘‘We’re trying to make sure that
the money we do spend is well-
spent.”

“We're interested in enhancing the
educational program and the quality
of the student body,” he continued.
“That costs money.”

Epley said of the negative reaction
to the proposals that ‘‘about all I can
do is extend my sympathy to the stu-
dents that are discomfited.”’

“From my vantage point, if it
comes to a decision between adjust-
ing the salary of a valued faculty,
member to what it should be and
closing the library overnight, that’s
an easy choice for me,” he said.

He said students don’t seem to be
concerned about the effect these
issues have on their pocketbooks.
“We found that if we closed the
library overnight, we could save
$25,000 to $30,000 a year,’’ he said.
“But there’s a terrible outcry and we
cannot do that.”

“Everyone says, ‘You'll ruin the
educational experience here,’ ’’ he
continued. ‘‘If you’re not willing to
make that kind of sacrifice, then the
only give is to jack up the tuition.”’

Revenue Squeeze: Epley said
budgets are tighter than usual this
year because of a lull in non-tuition
University income.

“So much has happened here over
the last 10-15 years that allowed us to
add these programs and positions
without having to pay for them
without too much difficulty,” he said.

“I think people have grown accus-
tomed to or taken it for granted that
because of the breaks we’ve had, that
we can continue as we have in the
past to always add and never sacri-
fice.”

Epley said the ‘‘enormous infusion
of cash”’ in 1976 from the $13-million
Pratt Fund was a part of that cush-
ion. He added that the Board of
Trustees has elected to spend income
from endowment at a slightly lower
level next year than this year.

Tuition next year will cover 65 per-

cent of the cost of a student’s educa-
tion — up from the old target of 60
percent. ‘‘We're having to look to tui-
tion for a greater percentage of oper-
ating expenses than in the past,”
Epley said.

Hotchkiss explained that the Uni-
versity is in between the $67-million
development program that ended in
1982 and the drive he expects will
begin in the next few years ‘‘to carry
us through the balance of the cen-
tury.”

“People have a lot of ambition for
Washington and Lee and everyone
wants to keep moving as vigorously
as we did for the last 10 to 12 years,”’
he said. ‘‘It makes you feel restricted
now that the rate of progress is not'as
large.”

Spending Demands: Wilson said a
number of areas are requiring in-
creased funds at the same time that
revenue increases are shrinking.

“‘We believe that faculty and staff
salaries and faculty professional de-
velopment funds for travel and re-
search support are major priorities
that have to beserved,”’ he said.

‘‘Beyond that, we have some extra-
ordinary needs this year,”’ he con-
tinued, noting that those include the
additional staff positions and fac-
ilities modifications required for
coeducation, a new mainframe aca-
demic computer, a new journalism
department computer, more finan-
cial aid and additional professors to
handle the new General Education

Requirements.

Elrod noted that ‘‘we don’t want to
lose the current student-faculty
ratio” and that the expected growth
of the student body by 100 over the
next decade “may require the addi-
tion of one position.”’

The Outlook: Administrators said
there are several factors that compel
them to continue their quest for cut-
backs.

Admissions Director William M.
Hartog III said that ‘‘cost comes up
all the time”’ in interviews with pro-
spective students. ‘‘It would behoove
us to try to keep our costs down as
muchas wecan,” hesaid.

Epley agreed. “‘It seems tome that
in the past we have been more apt to
raise tuition than to focus on saVings
opportunities,’’ he said. “If we’re go-
ing to stay in sound financial shape,
there is going to have to be a change
in that.”

Wilson said bottom-line considera-
tions dictate his approach. ‘‘I have to
present the trustees with a balanced
budget,’’ he explained. ‘‘Nobody else
has that responsibility — no dean, no
member of the faculty. I have to re-
concile all the demands of all the
departments.”

Epley said juggling those 150
department budgets does not engen-
der much gratitude. “Some of the
things I’ve done here haven’t been
popular,” he said. ‘‘Somebody has to
be unpopular, I suppose. It goes with
the job.”’

 

Ban asked on midweek bands

The Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board has recommended
that bands at midweek parties be
prohibited after the board deadlock-
ed Tuesday over whether Sigma
Alpha Epsilon should be penalized
for that action.

SAE had the band ‘‘Embarrassing
Stains’ at its house the Wednesday
before Fancy Dress, but there cur-
rently is no rule against that. ‘‘It’s
never been done before,”’ IFC Presi-
dent David Perdue said.

Perdue is a member of SAE and so
did not vote on the question. The
board was left with a 3-3 tie, meaning
that no penalty was given.

The party was not illegal, Perdue
explained, because ‘“‘it was of a spon-
taneous nature and was a pitch-in.”’

“The band was not booked,” he
said.

Defense watchdog

not to exceed $1,000 on each charge.

By law, defense contractors are
permitted to add a percentage of
overhead costs to the price of wea-
pons systems only after negotiating
with the Pentagon.

Spanton uncovered information
proving that Pratt and Whitney had
increased prices on spare parts by as
much as 300 percent. An internal Air
Force report later confirmed this.

The company also made a $67,500
contribution to the Oklahoma Art
Center. The wife of Air Force Maj.
Gen. J.T. Edwards was on the board
of the art center. Pratt and Whitney
later asked for reimbursement, call-
ing the donation a “‘business over-
head expense.”

Spanton’s return to auditing came
from an invitation by the House
Energy and Commerce Committee’s
investigation into General Dyna-
mics’ expenses.

Investigators have accused the
company of wining and dining mili-
tary brass and congressmen and sub-
mitting bills for personal trips to Las
Vegas and West Palm Beach, coun-
try club dues, golf trips, chili cook-
offs and the boarding of an execu-
tive’s dog.

Spanton will be visiting journa-
lism, politics, accounting and econo-
mics classes Tuesday and Wednes-
day. His speech, according to Mollen-
hoff, will be about the obstacles
whistleblowers face in trying to in-
itiate sound accounting practices in-
volving major defense contractors.

He will speak at 7:30 p.m.

Monday night that ‘‘each member of

Mollenhoff told the players they

George Spanton, a former govern-
ment auditor and ‘‘whistleblower,”
will speak in Lee Chapel Tuesday
night.

Spanton has recently come out of
retirement to help investigate alleg-
ed improprieties by General Dyna-
mics, the nation’s largest defense
contractor.

General Dynamics is being inves-
tigated by three congressional com-
mittees, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Internal Revenue
Service, the Justice Department and
the Navy for allegedly submitting
false reimbursement claims.

Spanton is best known for his work
as branch audit chief for the Defense
Contract Audit Agency in West Palm
Beach, Fla. The DCAA is the audit
agency for the Defense Department.
His work there was helped to promi-
nence by Washington and Lee Jour-
nalism Professor Clark R. Mollen-
hoff, a reporter for The Washington
Times.

Spanton filed a grievance with the
Merit System Protection Board
charging his immediate supervisor,
DCAA Director Charles Starrett and
regional DCAA director Paul Evans
with attempting to force him to re-
sign.

The reason for this, according to
Spanton, was his demands for access
to financial records of defense con-
tractors and for trying to start an
agency-wide study of ‘excessive
wage costs’’ paid to executives of
these companies.

The Pratt and Whitney Aircraft
Co., the largest producer of military
aircraft engines and a subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp., was the
major target of his investigation.

Starrett approved actions taken by
Evans in 1982 to force Spanton to take
an unwanted and premature ‘‘rota-
tional transfer’ from West Palm
Beach, where he had been stationed
for almost five years, to Newport
Beach, Calif.

Starrett defended his action by
calling the move “‘routine”’ and bas-
ed on agency policy, which he said
ordered the transfer of auditors to
different locations after five years.

Heels throttle
lax team, 19-5

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

When the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team returned from Chapel
Hill, N.C., Saturday evening, their
eyes and voices said all that needed
to be said about their game against
the University of North Carolina

they had lost. The final score of 19-5
seemed somewhat surprising, but it
was true. The Generals’ record now
stands at 1-1.

The Generals’ game plan was to
control the tempo and hold onto the
ball. All seemed to be going well as
junior attackman Caulley Deringer
broke through the Tar Heel defense
and scored the Generals’ first goal,
giving them a 14 lead. But soon
thereafter, the score was tied at one.
The rest of the first half would
foreshadow what was to come as the
‘Tar Heels’ offensive machine took a
sizeable 8-2 halftime lead.

“We were disappointed at half.
Guys felt we could still win, but we
had bitter feelings,’’ said senior co-
captain David Johnston. ‘Offense
had controlled the ball really well,
and the key to the first period was
that the offense held onto the ball for
four or five minutes at a time.”’

“North Carolina is an excellent of-
fensive team, so we wanted to control
the tempo and limit their opportuni-
ties. Our strategy worked at first, but
then they exploded,’’ head coach
Dennis Daly said.

The explosion was one of nuclear
power in the second half. The

Generals would move the ball down
the field, take a shot and miss. The
Generals seldom recovered their own
shots and UNC would make the tran-

Tough matches drop netmen to .500

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee tennis
Generals record remains at .500 after
they soundly defeated Slippery Rock,
8-1, last Thursday,
Bloomsburg Tuesday, 6-2-1.

The team was able to show its
strength against Slippery Rock, win-
ning every match with the exception
of the match at No. 1 singles.

Against Bloomsburg, W&L had a
much closer match, which Coach
Gary Franke called ‘‘a disappointing
defeat for the Generals.”

No. i singles man Jack Messerly,
who earlier in the day had been in the
infirmary with the flu, continued to
come up against tough opponents. He
suffered his fourth straight loss, 74,
6-1

Andy Haring also had a difficult
time, losing in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.

W&L’s two victories came from the
No. 3 and the No. 6 singles spots. No.
3 Roby Mize was able to play his type
of game and forced his opponents in-
to error-prone tennis to get the match
win. Scott Adams, at No. 6, continued
his winning streak with a 6-1, 6-3
straight-set victory.

Arguably, the most crucial match-
es for W&L were at No. 2 and No. 5
singles where David McLeod and
Chris Wiman both battled strong
Bloomsburg opponents, coming up

and lost. to.

sition. In a flash of light and swing of
the stick, the UNC offense was set-
ting up. The key fact of the game was
that when UNC missed shots, they
retrieved the ball. Then they would
set up and try to score again, which
they were very successful at. The
Tar Heels outscored the Generals
11-3 in the second half.

For many Washington and Lee
students who seem to classify
themselves as lacrosse experts, the
19-5 loss was a perfect chance to
ridicule the team. ‘‘They should just
play Division III lacrosse and take
the championship’’ was heard from
more than just one student. But
that’s not the attitude of the Division
I Generals. They lost, and maybe
they haven’t quite recovered from
the shellshock, but they have
recovered from UNC.

“It’s over and done with,’’ senior
Sandy Brown said. ‘‘We learned from
it. Now we have to get it back and re-
bound. And the season is not blown
out by any stretch of the imagina-
tion.”

Johnston agreed with Brown, say-
ing, ‘““We’re not going to give up the
rest of the season because of one loss.
We'll put it behind us and move on.”’

The 1985 lacrosse team is one with
character and good vision. They
realize that each week they probably
are an underdog but they fight on.
UNC didn’t take any prisoners and
the Generals are still a tightly knit
group of athletes. According to Daly,
at Monday's practice, the ‘“‘phrase”’
going around was, “UNC didn't
break us — it was a loss and that’s
is.”

Despite the one-sided loss, Daly
saw some bright spots. ‘‘We won
most of the draws, and if we could

 

   
   

Junior Scott Adams practices his forehand volley in

up on the short side in the end. With
his agressive style of play, Wiman
played a close first set, bowing in the
tiebreaker, 8-6. Wiman had a bit
more trouble in the second set, losing
6-2. The match was his first loss of
the season.

toward the UNC goal in action from Saturday’s lacrosse game with

Daly said he was pleased with the
performance of goalie John DiDuro,
who was under constant pressure. He
was scored on 16 times, while UNC
had 64 shots on goal. In comparison,
Duke took only 41 shots last week.

Senior Rich Schoenberg was nam-
ed player of the game.

In the fourth quarter, Daly pulled
many of his starters off the field and

match off slowly, losing the first set,

came back to win the second set, 6-3.
The third set went back and forth
before reaching a tiebreaker. Mc-
Leod’s opponent, Tim Mitchell, was
down 2-6 in the breaker before storm-
ing back to take the tiebreker and the
match.

McLeod emphasized the pressure
that was placed on the W&L doubles
teams as a result of the 4-2 deficit
heading into the doubles. “If I had
won my match, there wouldn’t have

to the doubles, but I’ve been down
match points before and won. I just
hope it doesn’t happen again,” he

said.

Despite the pressure, though, the
Generals appeared unaffected in the
early going of the doubles matches.
Each of the three teams took their
Bloomsburg opponents to tiebreak-
ers. The Generals won those break-

up by 10 goals. This allowed fresh-
man John Knight to score his first
collegiate goal. Other goals were
tallied by Rod Santomassimo, Brown

No. 3 (Mize-Adams. Messerly and
McLeod at No. 1 lost in their tie-
breaker.

Both the No. 1 and the No. 3 teams
again went to tiebreakers. But both
lost those tiebreakers, the loss at No.
1 securing the team victory for
Bloomsburg. The match at No. 3 was
left as a draw due to darkness, while
Haring and Wiman lost the final two
sets of their match to close out the
team scoring.

Coach Franke praised the play of
Bloomsburg and was honest about
the play of his own team. ‘“‘They were
just a little better today than we
were. You can’t make excuses.
You've got to win those close
games,’ he said. For spectators,
Tuesday’s match was like a good
book that you can’t put down. Unfor-
tunately for the Generals, the ending
was a frustrating one.

The Generals finish the week with
three matches in four days. A key
match toward a top Division III rank-
ing will be Friday’s home match
against Rochester. Match time is 3

W&L ‘9’ off to ‘bes

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team got off to one of its best starts in
recent years, winning two of its first
three games this week.

The Generals swept a doublehead-
er from Christopher Newport Satur-
day before losing a close one to

Virginia Wesleyan on Monday after-
noon.

Against Newport, W&L needea
three extra innings to win the first
game by thescore of 6-5.

The Generals notched one run in
the first inning when Hugh Finkel-
Stein, who went six-for-eight with a
double, a triple and three runs batted
in on the afternoon, led off with a
Single and scored on a Carter Steuart
Sacrifice fly.

Newport came back to take the
lead in the third when it scored two
runs of W&L starter Kirk Breen on
two hits and one General error, mak-
ing the score 2-1. In the fourth, New-
port stretched its lead to 3-1 thanks to
a walk by Breen and a run-scoring
double.

Things looked gloomy for the Gen-
erals after Newport scored again in
the fifth to go up 4-1. W&L came stor-
ming back, however.

In its half of the inning second
baseman Chuck Nelson reached on
anerror, and Adam Yanez then walk-

' ed. Finkelstein singled to load the
_ bases, and third baseman Milam

Turner doubled, scoring two runs and
drawing the Generals within one run

Word on golf:

From Staff Reports

 

After losing his only returning let-
terman, Washington and Lee golf
coach Buck Leslie can find only one
word to describe this year’s young
squad. That word is inexperienced.”

“We are very inexperienced,”’ Les-
lie, now in his 11th season at the W&L

helm, said.

On March 4 and 5, the Generals
drove to Sanford, N.C., for the NCAA
District III, Division III qualifying
tournament. After the first day, they
had driven their way to ninth place in

’ the 19-team field, and ended up fi-
. nishing 12th after the final day.

The Generals’ low scorer at the

’ tourney was freshman Gist, who shot

an 82 and a 78 for a two-day total

_ of 160. The course was a par 71.

Others who competed included junior
John Wheeler, sophomore Mark Za-
vatsky and freshmen Gary Camp-
bell, Andy Parkey and James

* Sowersby.

Coach Leslie received a bit of a
shock in January when captain and

’ two-year letterman Turner Fried-

man did not return to W&L.

It was a surprise to me, and I think
it was a surprise to his family,” Les-
lie said. He believes Friedman trans-
ferred to West Virginia University
for personal reasons.

Leslie had expected Friedman to
anchor the otherwise young squad.
Wheeler has been elected the new

captain.
The Generals are competing in the
James Madison University

_ Invitational today and tomorrow.

They open their dual meet season on
March 21 at home against Liberty

_ Baptist and Longwood.

I am writing this column to inform
hunters and fishermen at W&L of the
opportunites available in the Rock-
bridge. County area. If anyone has
suggestions or criticisms, please feel

’ free to come by Gilliam 214 and let

=

me know. Turkey hunting will be ad-
dressed this week.

Spring Turkey Season will open in
April, and there are plenty of areas in
which to hunt. National Forest Areas
and State-owned hunting lands are
available to everyone. Private land
also is available. ,

Maps of the George Washington
and Jefferson National Forests are
available for 50 cents at the Forest
Service Office in Buena Vista. The
National Forests should be safer and
less crowded during this season,
since there are fewer turkey hunters
than deer hunters.

Before you hunt, you must obtain a
Virginia hunting license ($7.50), a
Virginia Big Game Stamp ($7.50) and
a National Forest Permit ($2). Hun-
ting is allowed from a half hour be-
fore sunrise until noon, and only
bearded birds may be taken. Shot-
guns, without buckshot, and rifles
may be used to hunt. Resident hun-
ting licenses can be purchased by col-
lege students from out of state.

You and other hunters will be cam-
oflaged, so know what you are shoot-
ing. Do not shoot at the sound of a
bird calling because it could be
another hunter’s call. I wish every-
one a safe hunt and good luck.

at 4-3. Billy White brought home the
tying run when he grounded out,
making the score 4-4.

Neither team was able to score un-
til the 10th inning, when Newport
broke the ice to take the lead 5-4.
W&L was once again able to come
from behifd, scoring twice to win the
game. White led off the inning with a
single, stole second and scored when
pinch hitter Bill Curtiss singled. Chip
Hutchins then advanced Curtiss
when he reached on an error. A sin-
gle by Chris Militello brought Curtiss
home for the winning run.

Bullpen ace Peter Detlefs got the
win in relief of Breen, who gave up
only two earned runs and six hits
while striking out eight in seven in-
nings.

In the second game, W&L starter
White got off to a shaky start before
his teammates rallied in the later in-
nings to pull away from Newport for
the victory, 9-3.

White walked one batter in the first
and gave up a two-run homer with
two outs. W&L cut the Newport lead
in half in the third inning when short-
stop Alex Sutton singled with two
outs and Finkelstein followed with a
double, scoring Sutton.

W&L entered the fifth inning trail-
ing 3-1 before posting four runs to
take the lead.

Militello walked to start the inning,
Nelson singled and Sutton walked to
load the bases. Finkelstein came
through in the clutch again, tripling
to score three runs and put the Gen-
erals in front to stay at 4-3.

In the sixth, W&L put the game on
ice by scoring four runs on five hits.
Militello doubled and Finkelstein,
Steuart, Curtiss and Clement all sin-
gled in the inning.

White went the distance for the
Generals, giving up only three earn-

By Mike ball and basketball and an illegal

CAOCRETS idem in the lant doende, Soom the
institution’s most recent president,
Bill Atchley, had vowed to change things there. When he got primarily
grief from the school’s board of trustees, he gave the board an either-

some-semblence-of-an-academic-institution-or-I’m-outta-
here ultimatum. And last week, they accepted his resignation in a
seven-hour meeting.

Obviously, the question here is that old bugaboo of athletics vs.
academics, and once again we find that compromise has won out. The
battle in Clemson had centered on Atchley and his athletic director,
Bill McLellan. Atchley saw a situation in his athletic department that

Against Virginia Wesleyan on Mon-
day, the Generals never got untrack-

W&L entered the fifth inning tied at

decide the game.

Wesleyan opened the inning with
three singles off W&L starter Bill
Schoettelkotte, scoring one run to
lead 2-1. Schoettelkotte walked the
next batter to load the bases with two
outs. The next batter flied to shallow

but Nelson mishandled the ball, al-

scored once more in the inning to
make the score 6-1.

Wesleyan tallied twice more in the
sixth, and W&L closed the scoring in
the seventh when Finkelstein scored,
leaving the final score, 8-2.

“We faced a fairly decent pitcher,”’
Murdock said. ‘‘We didn’t make con-
tact. I think we were a little intimi-
dated.”’

Schoettelkotte went seven innings,
allowing only three earned runs,
before being relieved by Steuart.

Track ‘team’ opens season

Staff Reporter

 

Beginning its defense of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference title,
the Washington and Lee track team
opens its 1985 outdoor season this
weekend in a three-way meet with
Davidson and Emory and Henry at
Wilson Field.

Leading the Generals this season
are tri-captains Chris Ives, Mark
Pembroke and Chris McGowan. In
addition to the captains, the Generals
possess great depth on their team.
Head coach Norris Aldridge said,

Staff Reporter

 

The 1984-85 swimming team at
Washington and Lee was the best
W&L’s had since 1978. It was a
season of dedication beyond belief
at times, but for the 13 gentlemen
that made up this year’s squad the
long, hard days were more like
business as usual.

To say that the life of a swim-
mer at W&L is hard would be an
understatement. While 95 percent
of the W&L population is fast
asleep, alarm clocks pierce the
dark silence of 13 bedrooms to
begin a swimmer’s typical day.
The time on the digital clock is
5:53 a.m. By 6:15 each of the
members of the team has report-
ed to the weight room, and it’s
time to stretch. The next hour is
spent lifting individually or as a
group, depending on the day of the
week. There is no alternating
Monday, Wednesday, Friday rou-
tine here; itis every day.

“It’s hard to get up, but it got
easier as the season went along,”’
freshman Darrin Denny said.
‘Sometimes you just say, ‘No,’
but you get upanyway.’”

Most students at W&L find it
difficult to get out of bed for an 8
a.m. class. Try weightlifting at
6:15. I know I would want to say,
‘‘No’’more than ‘‘sometimes.”’

After breakfast come the regu-
lar class schedule - the normal

 

“The secret to our success is team-
work.”’ He also said that W&L has a
lot of athletes who will place in their
events and often places two people in
the same event.

Assessing the Generals’ chance to
repeat as conference champion, Ives
said, ‘‘(Our chances are) very good.
We have a lot of very good indivdual
athletes.”’

The Generals are anxious to start
their outdoor schedule. Junior
Townes Pressler (high jump) said
that he jumps better outside. Press-
ler said, ‘‘The outdoors are more cen-
ducive to a better performance.”

Concerning the meet this weekend,

stuff that you and I do. Then at
3:15 it’s back in to Cy Twombly
Pool to swim. Practice lasts until
6 p.m. (‘some a few minutes ear-
lier, most of the time a few min-
utes later,’’ according to fresh-
man Craig Garneau).

Dinner is next, followed by
homework and finally sleep
around 11 p.m. And it all begins
again at 5:53 the next morning. It
doesn’t seem like a very exciting
day, or year, for that matter. But
to these guys, it’s a way of life.
The sacrifices were obviously
there, but not one is complaining.

“Don’t look at it as a sacrifice
—although we do sacrifice some
things, we gain a lot more,” Gar-
neau said. ‘‘You don’t end up on
the negative side, that’s for sure.”’

When the team stayed in Lex-
ington during Christmas vacation,
the general feeling was that it was
in the team’s best interest. There
were no negative comments. Most
said it would have been nice to see
family and friends for the three
weeks, but they felt they couldn’t
afford to be out of the pool that
long.

The swimmers have been suc-
cessful in the classroom, too.
Coach Page Remillard stressed
the education as much as the free-
style. Both have been successful.

“T learned a lot this year,” said
Garneau. “What you get out of
swimming is an intangible, Get-
ting medals and trophies isn’t

Coach Aldridge said, ‘‘I hope that we
are not overconfident from our
ODAC indoor title.”’

“We beat Davidson indoors, but
they have improved since then,’’ he
added. Aldridge also added that the
Generals are currently nursing a few
injuries that could have an effect on
the meet this weekend. Bill Rhine-
hardt has a pulled hamstring from
the ODAC Indoor Championships two
weeks ago. Two of W&L pole vaulters
are out temporarily: one with the flu
and the other with a hurt ankle.

The field events for this weekend’s
meet will start at 10:45 while the
track events will start at 11:15.

what you get. You get personal
satisfaction and discipline. I’m
not going to nationals, nor am I an
all-American, and I’m not going to
make the cover of Sports Ilustrat-
ed, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t
get anything.”

“The end of the season is disap-
pointing and a relief,’’ Denny
said. ‘I’m looking forward to next
season. But right now, I need the
rest.”

For the guys not going the na-
tional championships next week,
they probably have more time on
their hands than they know what
to do with. But Remillard and his
nationals-bound swimmers con-
tinue to work.

At poolside, Remillard agreed
with Denny, that the end of the
season had come at a good time.
They seemed to have had their
fill, but not more than they want-
ed.

“These guys have given every-
thing they’ve been asked,’’ Remil-
lard said. ‘‘Hopefully, 10 years
from now they’ll be as happy as
they are today. They've created a
great environment and I have
been fortunate to be an observer.”

Next week, those swimmers
who will be making the trek to At-
lanta for nationals will see if the
long hours and early mornings
will be rewarded with a strong
team showing. One is safe in
guessing they won’t be under-
prepared.

of a heart attack but was found to have traces of an anti-inflammatory

Vision Quest: Entertaining film,
but conclusion could be stronger

MOVIEREVIEW

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

Lauden Swain has turned 18; he is
a senior in high school; and he’s
decided it was time he did something
real. His challenge is known as a ‘‘Vi-
sion Quest’’ and his story is funny
and entertaining.

Lauden decides that to succeed he
must drop two weight classes and

      

wrestle the state champion at 168
pounds. The trouble with his plan is
that the champion, known as Shoot, is
a gorilla who has not lost a match in
three years. Also, Lauden falls for a
gorgeous hitchhiker who moves in
with his family, and he begins to lose
sight of his dream.

Like all ‘challenge mevies,”’ there
seems to be little doubt whether Lau-
den will succeed or not. And, like all
“high school movies,” there is an
assortment of friends, who fit stereo-
types we can all recognize. Unlike

simple genre movies, though, ‘‘Vi-
sion Quest’? touches, briefly, on
unemployment, broken homes and
alcoholism. At its core, it is a film
about a boy who wants to be a man.

Malcolm Modine is the perfect
Lauden. He is bright, unassuming,
shy and kind of ‘‘dorky-looking.’’ His
best friend, Kuch, is played by Brian
Schoeffling, and he is outstanding.

Moviegoers also will recognize sev-
eral songs from the ‘Vision Quest”’
soundtrack. Madonna and Journey
both have new releases off the sound-
track, and Madonna even performs
in the movie

There are some very moving mo-
ments in this picture. Lauden’s visit
to his grandfather is short, but in
those few minutes, Modine says to his
grandfather what a lot/of us wish we
could. The most stirring moment,
however, comes before the show-
down with Shoot when Lauden’s co-
worker, Elmo, explains why he is
coming to see the match. It is ele-
gantly acted, surprising in this type
of movie.

Unfortunately, at that scene sets us
up for is a big, emotional climax, and
we don’t get it. There is the match,
but the aftermath is hardly as large
as one expects, and this one flaw
alone is enough to dampen the effect
of the rest of this otherwise fine
movie

‘Vision Quest”’ is, nonetheless, en-
tertaining, and you will laugh. If only
the ending would have been a little
stronger

‘En garde’

Drama prof stages realistic combat .

As one of the country’s premier
choreographers of stage violence,
Joseph Martinez’s goal is to make
fight scenes as realistic as possible.

In so doing, the Washington and
Lee drama professor says he hopes to
make his audiences and his students
recognize that violence is the very
worst way to settle a conflict.

The author of a book on staging
violence, titled ‘Combat Mime,”
Martinez specializes in the chore-
ography of sword fights. This semes-
ter he is teaching eight drama ma-
jors the fine art of making the sword
fights in Shakespeare’s plays look
authentic. And while he is showing
those students how to parry and
thrust without hurting one another,
Martinez thinks the young actors are
learning another lesson.

“T think the students come to re-
cognize the value of non-violence
through learning how to use the
swords,’ he said.

“If there is a central conflict in a
piece of drama, my aim is to make
that violence so realistic, so vivid,
that the audience is horrified by it,’’
Martinez added. ‘‘I go for the adrenal
reaction but not simply for the sake
of that reaction itself. The more hor-
rible it is to an audience, the more ob-
vious it becomes that such violence is
not a viable option.

“And as far as the students are
concerned, I have found that by
learning how to stage these fights
properly they become more keenly
aware of how easy it is to inflict pain
or to suffer pain. Once they are
aware of that, I believe they come to
view violence and violent actions as
something to be avoided at all costs.’’

Martinez acknowledges that the
trend in stage and screen violence
has been toward more and more
graphic depictions.

“There has been an increase in the
knowledge of how to create violent

scenes without actually doing harm
to the actors,”’ he said. ‘I see stage
and screen violence continuing more
and more toward realism.

“Unfortunately, gratuitous graph-
ic violence is coming to a point where
there will be a backlash from people
who are horrified and disgusted. You
can hardly see a film today without
seeing somebody's head chopped off.
There is no question that much of it
has gone too far.”

Martinez, who has studied sword
choroeeography with Errol Flynn’s
fight choreographer and stunt man,
has choreographed a number of
Shakespeare plays, most recently
working with a Chicago stage com-
pany on the sword fights for ‘‘Ham-
let.”

He suggests that some of the best
new choreography in stage violence
has been in recent ‘‘Star Wars’’
films.

“The laser sword fights are similar
in many ways to the sword fights in

the old swashbuckler movies,’ Mar-
tinez said. ‘In that respect, it’s en-
couraging to see something of a re-
turn to the more elegant, yet still ex-
citing, fight scenes.”

On the other hand, Martinez con- ,
siders the manner in which television
presents violence a growing pro-
blem.

“The difficulty that I see with a.
great deal of TV violence is that the
viewer rarely sees the effects of that ;
violence on the victim. A thug is hit,
but you almost never see the pain
that is caused,” he said. ‘‘TV has a
tendency to paint its heroes and vil-
lians in absolute blacks and whites
without any gray areas. That makes
it easy to be unsympathetic toward
the victim.

“When you desympathize the vic-
tim, when you don’t show the effects
of that violence on the victim, then’
that violence tends to become:
palatable.”’

Pop, rock, R&B, reggae, folk

Music Critic
Hey gang — here’s another

dispatch from the rarified atmos-
phere of WLUR, high atop the third
floor of Reid Hall. Our dj’s have been
strong on Madonna, A Drop in the
Gray, Don Henley and John Fogerty.
Others of note: on the home front,
The Blasters have a new Ip, Hard
Line, full of red, white and blue roots
rock. The Alvin Brothers, Phil and
Dave, are exploring the territory
they charted with their earlier re-
leases. Rhythm and blues are alive
and well, at least on independent
labels, as Nappy Brown’s Tore Up
and Rounder records’ Out of the Blue
anthology prove.

Brown, an early ’50s Savoy records
shouter, is back after a 14-year re-
cording absence with an album show-
casing his still resplendent vocaliza-
tions. The Rounder anthology, which
includes Buckwheat Zydeco, Room-
ful of Blues, Solomon Burke and local
faves The Nighthawks, among
others, is both a fun party album and
a steal at $3.98 list. Fleetwood Mac
has a new album of R&B called
Jumping at the Shadows, recorded
live in Boston in 1969 before they
came to epitomize southern Califor-
nia mellow.

Van Morrison has switched labels,
or more accurately, was dumped
from Warner Brothers’ roster along
with many other fine artists in a
purge last year, and resurfaced with
another fine lp, A Sense of Wonder, a
perfect album for the lazy spring
Sundays ahead. Reggae fans will
want to hear a new Pablo Moses Ip,
Tension, as well as a live ‘‘Sun-
splash” recording from Kansas Ci-
ty’s own reggae stars, The Blue Rid-
dim Band. Moses’ use of the studio
and incorporation of electronics
parallels that of Black Uhuru, and
the Riddim’s Alive in Jamaica
testifies to the universality of reggae,
the Chutzpah of these Americans,
and includes an hilarious tribute call-
ed ‘‘Nancy Reagan.”

From overseas, one of the most in-
fluential bands in England today,
The Smiths, have released Meat is
Murder. Musically more upbeat in
spots than earlier efforts, it is lyrical-
ly as intense as the title would indi-
cate. Lead singer Morrissey is para-
doxically whining and hypnotic, but
his essential honesty is what sticks in

“It’s still for bragging rights of the

U.Va. head coach Jim Adams said.

“It’s the two best lacrosse pro-

School heightens effort
to add minority students

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

Recruitment of black students this
year is more intense than usual par-
tially because of the ‘automatic
segregation” of blacks on campus,
admissions officials say.

Efforts to increase minority enroll-
ment include the use of alumni re-
sources and programs that identify
qualified black students.

“We have never had sufficient
numbers of black kids here for them
to really feel a part of the institu-
tion,’’ said Van H. Pate, associate
director of admissions.

Pate said the tendency to ‘‘seek out
your own”’ has led black students at
Washington and Lee to be ‘‘auto-
matically segregated.”

From Staff Reports

 

 

Junior J. Christopher Hunter died

of a broken neck early Sunday about”

half a mile north of Lexington after
the car in which he was riding ran off
the road, recrossed it and then hit a
tree, authorities said.

The driver of the car, sophomore
P. Edward Henson, was charged
Monday with reckless driving and
driving under the influence of
alcohol.

Hunter, 21, of Cave Spring, Ga.,
was a politics major and former
rugby player who was assistant
social chairman of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon.

Medical Examiner F.A. Feddeman
said Hunter died of ‘‘a fractured neck
from hitting the windshield.”

SAE President L. Gray Sanders
said Hunter and Henson were return-
ing from a fraternity gathering at
Windfall, a country house where
several Washington and Lee students
live.

State police trooper E.R. Ham-
ilton, the investigating officer, said
the white 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass
was traveling south on state Route
681 about 1:30 a.m. when it ran off the
left side of the road.

Hamilton said the driver then cut
back across the road, forcing the car
off the right shoulder into a tree. He
said Hunter died ‘‘almost immediate-
ly upon impact.”

‘‘We need to create a critical mass
of black students on campus,’’ he
said.

The Admissions Office asked Fi-
nancial Aid Director John H. De-
Courcy to act as organizer of the min-
ority recruiting éffort. ~~ "8

“In some ways I guess I was the
natural choice,” said DeCourcy, who
was financial aid director at Florida
Memorial, a primarily black school
in Miami. He was also director of a
program designed to place highly
qualified and motivated minority stu-
dents in 30 public schools, such as
those in Swarthmore, Pa., and New
Canaan, Conn.

DeCourcy said that Admissions Di-
rector William M. Hartog III’s initial
request was for the establishment of

The trooper said the car was
traveling ‘‘probably around 50 mph.”’
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M. Rey-
nolds said the two-lane, paved road
has a posted speed limit of 25 mph.

If Hunter had been wearing a
seatbelt at the time of the crash,
Hamilton said, ‘‘it could have made
all the difference in the world.”’

Hamilton said Henson underwent a
blood test about 2% hours after the
wreck. He said the results will not be
received from the laboratory for.
about two weeks. The findings will
not be made public prior to the court
hearing.

Henson was charged based on a
warrant obtained from a magistrate,
according to Hamilton. The trooper
said Henson had begun to recover
from his injuries when he was charg-
ed at the Lexington police station
Monday afternoon. He was released
on his agreement to appear in court
— no bail was required.

Hamilton said the additional
charge of involuntary manslaughter
can be filed against Henson at the
discretion of the Commonwealth’s
Attorney. He said two factors in such
a charge would be if ‘‘an extremely
high rate of speed” was involved and
if the driver was “extremely intox-
icated.”’

‘There were no witnesses that I’m
aware of,’’ Hamilton said.

A preliminary hearing for the case
has been set for May 1 in Rockbridge
County General District Court.

The two charges that have been fil-
ed against Henson each carry a
potential penalty of up to a year in
jail, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. A
manslaughter charge would carry a
possible penalty of between one and

10 years in jail, a fine of up to $1,000,
or both.

Henson, a 20-year-old pre-med stu-
dent, attended the services for
Hunter that were held Tuesday in
Georgia. Sanders said Henson will be
at home in Dalton, Ga., for at least
the rest of the term.

Sanders said Henson suffered a
variety of head injuries. He said that
Henson had stitches taken on the in
side and outside of his mouth and that

Lewis, Caruthers and Webb:
New ‘Big Three’ looks ahead

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Professionalism and a_ serious attitude will
characterize next year’s Executive Committee, accord-
ing to the committee’s president- and vice president-
elect.

The EC also will do all it can to help the coeducation
transitiongo smoothly but will not overcompensate for
the change, President-elect John Lewis and Vice Presi-
dent-elect Andrew Caruthers said this week.

Although Lewis, Caruthers and Secretary-elect Mich-
ael Webb have not met to discuss next year’s plans, all
three offered their individual thoughts on the direction
they'would like to see the committee take.

“Our utmost concern is to be professional, and to have
a sense of professionalism when we deal with anything
in honor,”’ Caruthers said. This is something he said was
prevalent in the two Executive Committees he has serv-
ed on and will be an integral part of next year’s commit-
tee.

Caruthers is the only one of next year’s Big Three with
EC experience, but he said that the new members
will have no trouble learning the ropes. EC experience is
not necessarily a prerequisite for serving on the Big
Three, said Caruthers, adding that members will gain a
lot of experience on the job very quickly and this will
help them to do a good job.

rest of this year’s EC meetings and executive sessions,

The death of Chris Hunter last weekend thrust sudden,
excruciating stress onto many members of the Universi-
ty community — administrators, his fraternity brothers,
his friends.

One of the largest single burdens was borne by senior
Gray Sanders, a close friend of Hunter’s and president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

An SAE junior praised Sanders’ conduct through the
crisis. ‘‘Although obviously distressed, he has led effec-
tively and with great compassion,’ the member said.

“It’s been the worst three days I’ve ever had,”
Sanders said Tuesday night as he relaxed in his room at
the SAE house. ‘‘We’ll get over it someday, but it’s a hor-
rible experience. It really does change the way you look
at the world.”’

He called a meeting for 4:30 a.m. Sunday to tell the
fraternity about the death. ‘‘We didn’t want people to
hear about it on the radio or from rumors,” he said. ‘‘It
was the worst meeting in my life — it was horrible.’’

“Some of the guys started crying right away,’’ he
recalled. ‘Others were just stunned.”’

Sanders said that at the Monday night house meeting,
each member said a few words during the usual ‘‘com-
ments” time. ‘‘There were 64 pretty big guys in there
just bawling, crying,”’ he said

“Chris was real loud and crazy,’ he said. ‘‘It was hard
to go to W&L and not know him, so if you were in his
fraternity, you really knew him well,”’ he said

Chris Hunter was killed Sunday morning when this car ran off the road.

‘It could have been

said he feels he will be able to learn much of what his job
entails by doing just that. Asked about his lack of ex-
perience, Lewis said that he thinks ‘‘a little new blood
once in a while is a good thing.”’

Lewis said that recent perceptions of problems on this
year’s EC stemmed from comparisons made between
this year’s EC and last year’s.

Last year’s EC was ‘‘very much in focus and very ob-
vious — couldn’t get away from it,’’ Lewis said. This
year’s committee, on the other hand, is a ‘‘reaction” to
last year’s and, as such, has taken a low profile. In that
sense, the EC was successful, Lewis said.

Of this year’s EC’s accomplishments, Lewis was un-
sure, ‘‘It seemed from the outside that little has been
done,” he said, because the inner workings of the EC
generally are not seen and the current president chose to
keep a low profile.

Caruthers, sophomore representative on this year’s
EC, said some of the problems this year stemmed from
the way the EC was run. “This year’s president has
missed more meetings this year as president than I per-
sonally ever have,”’ he added.

Lewis said he plans to run next year’s EC “‘halfway be-
tween those two [Executive Committees].’’ He will not
bring up ‘‘outrageous”’ issues before the EC, he said, but
rather will find out what is important to students.

“I’m going to find out what’s important to W&L before
I speak, before the committee speaks,’’ he explained.

To aid in the transition between ECs, a visit to Sky-
lark, the University’s mountain retreat, has been plan-

anyone’

According to Sanders, the fraternity’s grief is focused
both on the heart-rending death of a friend and on the ap-
parent randomness of the tragedy.

“There’s the personal loss part of it — that really does
hurt,’’ he said. ‘‘The other aspect of it is that it was a fill-
in-the-blank situation —‘it could have been anyone in the
school.’’

‘All it would have taken was having a stinkin’ seatbelt
on,”’ he said. ‘Now you can’t get ina car with a member
of this fraternity without them buckling up.”’

Sanders said the anguish felt by the house intensified
as the week began. “It’s gotten worse,” he said. ‘‘When
it first hit, everyone in the house was, like, numb. It took
a while to grasp it.”

‘Meals are real quiet,’’ he continued. ‘‘People are
spending a lot of time by themselves, trying to under-
stand it. I can’t understand it myself.”’

Sanders wondered aloud if ‘‘there is anything positive
that can come out of this.”’

“T think there is,” he said. ‘‘It’s a horrible way to learn
what a car cando.”’

“You read about these things — it wasn’t supposed to
happen here or happen to anyone here,”’ he said. “‘It’s
not like a slap in the face — it’s like a kick in the
stomach. It makes you hurt inside.”’

“No one’s every going to forget it — it’s too horrible,”’
he said. ‘‘This is the closest most people in the house
have ever come to death. We’re young guys and most of
us haven't had much contact with death.”’

“Lifestyles — I don’t know if they’ll change or not,’’ he
said. ‘‘That’s what so sad about it — I don’t know if it'll
change anything.”

Sobering thoughts

Chris Hunter died this past weekend in a gruesome car ac-
cident. Some people are human and mourn; others will make
passing promises never to drink and drive; some will vow

never again to drink period.

But I am a skeptic about matters promissory. Hunter’s
death was simply unnecessary, and many people indirectly
stand to blame for it. I am not trying to diminish his death or
begin the fingerpointing by going on a witch-hunt; rather, his
death serves as a tragic reminder of how a good thing has
been corrupted along the way. Many parties — no pun intend-
ed — have aided in this perversion and each stands equally

“guilty.”

The Fraternity Rules Committee last May issued a report
to the Board of Trustees recommending the curbing of the
fraternity party schedules. Mid-week parties were regulated,
and weekend parties were limited to four per house per term.
Although their primary motive was “‘limiting wear and tear
on the house,”’ the group also believed limiting the party
schedules would help to re-orient students to matters acade-
mic. However, those recommendations have proven to have
several flaws, and this weekend’s death was proof of one of

those failures.

In their near religious zeal to curb the party schedules, the
group failed to realize that fraternity members, like the aver-
age American taxpayer, will try to find a loophole in regula-
tions. The faculty and student group deriving the rules play-
ed exactly into the hands of the fraternities by providing sev-
eral loopholes. The party Hunter was attending was held far
from campus because the fraternity involved did not want
the party to count as one of its official four parties. Unfor-
tunately, while that is totally ‘‘legal,’’ it also proves to be

very lethal.

Students who venture to distant country ranches over wind-
ing country roads, drink their fill and then try to make the
return drive tempt fate. They ought to realize that drinking
and driving don’t mix. But the Rules Committee, by disallow-
ing parties in the fraternity houses where the vast majority
of the ‘‘partiers’”’ might live, has indirectly ‘‘pushed’’ the par-
ties out of town and away from the majority of students’
dwellings. Their rules serve as a silent partner in this most

heinous of crimes.

But the hand has many fingers pointing blame, and stu-
dents certainly deserve some. Just a month ago, students
across the campus and the state decried the state govern-
ment’s move to raise the drinking age to 21 for all alcoholic
beverages. ‘‘We are old enough to fight’”’ and ‘“‘we are old
enough to vote’’ are but a few of the paper defense slogans
students shouted. The sayings are all trite, and the reasoning
quite shallow. We may think we are mature enough to handle
drinking and driving just as we are mature enough vote and
be drafted but Hunter’s death says everyone at that party
certainly wasn’t mature enough to handle drinking and driv-
ing. But, you may say, that was only a few students, and cer-
tainly not ‘‘me.” We must all accept equal blame if we are all
collectively going tc enjoy the benefits of an 18-year-old

drinking age.

We students need to sober up. We need to realize that all
those cute advertising jingles about drinking and driving
have a very profound bottom line — death. We students need
to realize that having fun and taking risks are not always the
same. We students need to start acting more our ages and
begin to display the maturity we claim we have and with
which we desire to be entrusted. Life is far more than a quick
buzz on the weekend or pretty women on Wednesday nights.

Working together, as concerned faculty, students and
friends, changes can — indeed, must — be made so that
future tragedies are prevented.

There’s nothing quite like death to
remind us that life goes on beyond
the Colonnade.

When students and a recent grad-
uate die on mountaintop, on roadside
and apartment floor, we hear morta-
lity whistle through our conscious-
ness like the clammy gusts of recent
sunny days.

Ask that kind of wind, and it will
say the warmth it closes ‘round is but
one spark between eternal nights.
But striding past our pillars of wis-
dom, it is only each of us who knows
if the soul has chilled before the toes.

Who can say how many living dead
are entombed in the heads we pass
each day? Who can say how many
have surrendered to something less
than inner fire?

We wonder when we nod greeting
only to blank stares plodding our
periphery. We wonder when the ideal
shatters in the scrutiny of the Law.
We wonder when we hear of men who
cannot face the day without a drink.
We wonder when we lose what once
was wonderment, and awe and inter-
est.

Where is that tiny mind that wants
to capture every thing and moment
of each day...touch it, hold it, let it
go? You can see it at the church steps
almost any day, turning and turning
in widening walks — children reach-
ing out with tiny arms and eyes so
wide they swallow you whole.

We all began that way.

We all began with a reverence for
living — a belief that we could fly.
Then we found that leaves fall for
those who cannot fly. And then we

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott
Tilley

With all due respect and admira-
tion for Mr. McAlevy... “It’s that
time again.’’ Time when high school
seniors wrack their brains trying to
decide before that looming April 1
deadline which institution of higher
learning they are going to lend their
incredible knowledge, personalities
and leadership to for the next four
years.

All of the ratios will be checked
out: student-teacher ratios, library
volumes per student, male-female
ratios and the number of parties per
week,

Parents and friends, teachers and
alumni will all chip in their two cents’
worth. And of course, the ever-pre-
sent “College Guides’ will be
consulted.

From Yale’s outstanding ‘‘Insid-
er’s Guide to the Colleges’ to The
New York Times’ fine ‘Selective
Guide to the Colleges”’ to Lisa Birn-
bach’s attempt (poor imitation?) ata
college guide, outsiders try to show
what it is like to be an insider at the
colleges.

And it is amazing the different
number of images a prospective
mink can draw of W&L by consulting
a variety of given guides, from
Yale’s ‘‘...image of a traditional
southern gentleman” to Lisa’s ‘‘rich,
preppy asshole’’ view.

It doesn’t stop there. Though some-
times in synch in some aspects of
W&L, these guides seem to have been
visiting different schools in reaching
their conclusions.

A small sampling of what these
prospective students are being led to
expect at W&L:

Academics:

Yale: “W&L’s academics are
solid. Traditional strengths have
been the humanities, particularly
history,”’

NY Times: Four stars (out of five).
“Excellent preprofessional pro-
grams...outstanding departments in
English and history... The excellent

learned that leaves are green before
they dry to brown and crinkle like
moth’s wings.

We learned that light makes green
leaves live and calls all the moths
together out back by the garbage
cans. We learned how moths and but-
terflies begin in little sleeping bags
from which they flourish.

We learned that we too began in lit-
tle sleeping bags, but burst out to
others teaching us how to fly. We
learned to love our parents.

Finally we came to this place
where we are our parents. Here we
learn how to learn or to pretend to
learn. We learn that learning is not
like turning leaves or butterflies. We
learn that learning is the creation of
letters and numbers that signify how
well we learned.

And we are taught to wrap our fluid
lives in paper packets to be placed in
certain hands at the fitting time. We
are taught to take the Fifth, to toe the
line to keep a train of thought on its
tersest track.

We read about life in Bolivia, about
economies of scale and the music of
the spheres. We meet FIFO, LIFO
and SWAPO. We discuss the meaning
of something someone wrote about
caves and shadows ‘round a fire cen-
turies ago.

We talk into natural light and con-
sider the consequences. Someone is
dead. Someone is in jail.

These things, we realize, have a
way of erasing a GPA. Death of body
or soul, we find, has a way of finding
the least common denominator
— how we have treated each other
and what we've left behind in words.

When a man becomes entombed
— by soil, steel bars or stagnation of
his soul — this thing called learning
disappears. All that’s left is the me-
mory of a good word spoken between
sweaty August sprints.

Illusions of grandeur explode.
When we do not know the face that is
the name on the obituary, we wonder

ing through the

placement record for its graduates
testifies to the quality instruction...”’

Lisa: ‘‘A guy can get a good educa-
tion at W&L.”’

Academic Pressure:

NY Times: ‘‘Anyone aiming for
more than a gentleman’s C, though,
will find the workload stiff. ‘Guts are
simply not to be found,’ one former
student said.”’

Lisa: ‘‘HA, HA, HA.”’

Tradition:

Yale: ‘Although many campuses
boast a reverence for tradition and
an equal number possess a flavor of
social and political awareness there
are few that combine the two as ef-
fectively as W&L.”’

NY Times: ‘Although certain tra-
ditional aspects of the school, like the
stately brick and white-columned
buildings, still preserve the atmos-
phere of the Old South, the only real
throwback to the days of Lee is the
all-male student body.”’ (Time for a
new edition).

Lisa: ‘‘Favorite school tradition:
Going down the road — a bunch of
guys get drunk, pile into a car, and
set out to abuse girls at a chosen
girls’ school.”

General Lee:

Yale: ‘General Robert E. Lee,
president of the college for five years
after the Civil War, is spoken of as a
‘living presence’ on campus.”’

Lisa: “‘ ‘General Lee has a real in-
fluence on why people come here.
He’s a god. ‘We call him St. Bob.
Thirty-five percent of the students’
rooms have a picture of General Lee
on proud display.”

Honor System:

Yale: ‘‘An effective honor system,
run entirely by the student govern-
ment...encourages the easygoing re-
ciprocal respect common among the
students.”

NY Times: “This level of respect
and friendliness is a result not only of
the school’s small size but also of the
student-administered honor system
— ‘a smash hit’ at W&L. Tests and
finals are taken without any faculty
supervision; doors remain unlocked,
calculators untended, and library
stacks open twenty-four hours a day.
The only punishment for violation,
one meted out several times a year,
is immediate expulsion.”’

Lisa: conspicuously not mention-
ed.

Fraternities:
Yale: “W&L’'s fraternity system

why we never met this man. We won-
der how this piece of life eluded us,
how this one fell to earth with naught
to break his fall. We wonder where
we were when mortality stung his
skin and despair eclipsed the sun.

And soon the numbness of our daily
pursuit seems the best drug for the
pain of having not been there. We
return to learning. We return to our
struggle for a certain future, grasp-
ing for the security of a good grade or
a job offer. We guzzle what we be-
lieve is the water of our lives
— Aristotle’s pursuit along those
lines of excellence.

But the ancient said those lines run
with these things called talents. He
said we should find these before we
seek to excel: and what better
method to this identification than the
survey of others’ talents for how
could we define personal excellence
without the benchmarks of our
peers? To do so would be to catch the
blueness of the mountains in a brush
and spread it on our face like blush.

So when we talk of excellence; let
us not speak in absolutes. Let us
remember how little we have learned
and how few we have known.

Let us remember that learning is
not only learning terms, but coming
to terms with leaves and moths and
children turning into men. Let us
walk in circles, frightened by the im-
mensity around us. Let us open our
eyes wide and gaze into the present,
concerned not so much with how
quickly we approach the future, but
with how fully we sense the present.

It lives in faces on the walks, in
gusts between red blocks and in the
pages of our books.

It lives in the faith of those to whom
mortality implies eternity. It lives in
those who build their own religion.

It lives in the leaf that falls too fast
for clutching palms, but plucked
from silence speaks on the pressed
pages of remembrance.

creates a high-pressure social scene.
It isn’t a good idea to appear too
studious, and for these unsure of
themselves socially, W&L is proba-
bly a bad choice.”

NY Times: ‘‘The school’s 17 frater-
nities are still the movers and
shakers of the W&L social scene,
each hosting parties almost every
weekend. About two-thirds of the
students go Greek and those who
don’t are urged to share the social
life by ‘at least hanging out at one,’ ”

Lisa: ‘‘Almost 65 percent of W&L’s
1,363 undergraduates is Greek, divid-
ed into seventeen fraternities. Con-
duct has been a problem. And ‘mini-
mum standards’ may be adopted.”’
Women/Coeducation:

Yale: ‘Women on campus will un-
doubtedly have a major impact on
life at Washington and Lee, but no
one is sure yet exactly what it will be.
W&L is used to being a very male uni-
versity, and that aspect of the school
is unlikely to change right
away...Despite the admission of wo-
men, W&L will probably always be
defined by conservative male tradi-
tions.”’

NY Times: “‘Despite the number of
eager and eligible young women de-
scending on Lexington each week-
end, students continually cite the all-
mate environment as the school’s
biggest drawback. Maybe the time
has come for Washington and Lee to
surrender again.”

Lisa: ‘Washington and Lee has
just made the epic decision to admit
women for the first time, which real-
ly burns a lot of students who like it
just the way it is...Most of the guys at
W&L see girls solely as diversions,
They have no concept of women as
thinking beings.”’

Conservatism:

Yale: “W&L students, despite an
outwardly conservative manner, are
hard-working — and hard-playing
— males who combine a liberal edu-
cation with a very active social life.
This liberal-conservative balance is
the real strong point of the school.”

NY Times: ‘Conservatism is as
much a part of the 20th century as of
the nineteenth and the student body
at Washington and Lee is no excep-
tion. One student writes bluntly that

‘ ‘people who do not like Southern

preppies and fairly rich, elitist peo-
ple’ should not come to W&L,”’

Lisa: ‘‘Students are conservative
bordering on royalists. There are two

cutbacks |
of ‘niceties’

To the Editors:

Iam writing this letter on behalf of
the Executive Committee to express
its views on the recent considerations
to cut back the “‘niceties’’ (as Mr.
Epley termed them) — the 24-hoyy
library, the 24-hour accessibility ,
Colonnade classrooms, the gymna.
sium hours as they stand and the an.
nual Catalogue. The Committee y.
nanimously opposes any tampering
with these traditions; the mere fact
that these are even ‘‘considerations” —
is appalling. The 24-hour library
schedule is one of the most impres.
sive aspects of W&L and should
never be abolished; the Colonnade
classrooms’ availability adds to this
dimension as well; the gymnasium
hours are too short as it is; and print. |
ing the Catalogue annually is not a
“nicety” but rather just good sense.

If $30,000 is so badly needed that we
would even make these radical pro.
posals our ‘‘considerations,”’ the Uni-
versity is indeed in poor financia|
shape. Why not consider letting in
four more freshmen in order for their
tuition ($28,400) to defray or subsi- |
dize these ‘‘niceties” as they were —
wrongly termed?

Accordingly, it is time to set the |
record straight: the 24-hour library,
the 24-hour accessibility to Colon-
nade classrooms, the gymnasium
hours as they stand, and the annual
Catalogue are not “‘niceties’’ at all.
They are NECESSITIES to W&L’s
atmosphere. They are the things that
set up apart from every other small
university. Take away these and you
have taken away W&L’s advantage
to stand head-and-shoulders above
the rest.

The Executive Committee strongly
opposes the mere consideration of
these necessities as ‘‘budget-cuts.”
These traditions make up the founda-
tions of the Washington and Lee ex- |
perience: foundations are not for
“consideration.”’

Tidbits:

Yale: “‘W&L’s campus is beautful.
Its centerpiece is ‘the Colonnade,’ a
long row of adjacent halls with — you
guessed it — majestic white columns.
Facing the Colonnade is the Lee
Chapel.”

“But conservatism doesn’t mean —
apathy. The traditional mock politi- ©
cal convention held every four years
for the party out of power is the best
example of the school’s savoit-
faire.”

“Washington and Lee has, in many —
ways, integrated the best of two —
worlds. Like the state of Virginia
itself, the school has one foot in the
North, one in the South, one in the
past, and one in the future.”

NY Times: ‘Despite stiff grading
the rapport between students and —
teachers is excellent.”

“Never prone to false modesty, the
W&L man considers himself ‘better-
looking, more intelligent, more out-
going, and more self-confident than
the average male.’ ”’

“Students spend their first year liv-
ing comfortably in dormitory singles
and eating well in Evans Dining Hall.
The good food is ‘another plus for
neurotic Mommies.’ ”

“Football sparks some interest i?
the fall, but W&L students ‘live for
the spring and lacrosse.’ Continual
contenders for national champion
ships, the team holds the campus i?
thrall from March to June.”

Lisa: ‘Certainly Washington and
Lee deserves its reputation as a rich
boy’s school, and homogeneous
doesn’t even express how similar
everyone is to everyone else.”

“Students at W&L think they would
have to alter their natural behavior if
girls were admitted...Few think it’s
worth the trouble,”

“Students just want to be like
General Robert E. Lee, and if they
can’t, emulating their fathers would
be satisfactory,”

Motives questioned

To the Editors:

This week we held a final election
to decide who will represent us as of-
ficers of the Executive Committee.
Now that we have elected the Big
Three, I would like all of us to con-
sider who we have voted for and what
their actual motives for running for
office might have been.

Among any list of candidates run-
ning for an office, there are those
who run for persona! or utilitarian
reasons and those who run for the
benefit of the institution whose office
they would like to hold. In light of
this, I would like to bring up the fol-
lowing statement made by Andrew
Caruthers: ‘‘It’s a thankless job, but
it’s a good resume filler.’’ Now this
statement was made by Mr. Caru-
thers not in reference to his own posi-
tion as sophomore EC representa-
tive, but I feel justified in making the
inference from this statement about
a particular office, to any office in
general.

Now what strikes me funny about
this statement is that Mr. Caruthers

acts as if an office owes the office-
holder something — if not thanks,
then at least a greater security of ob-
taining economic employment. But,
Mr. Caruthers, the job is not there for
the benefit of you, it’s there for the
benefit of the institution. I am not
singling out Mr. Caruthers, but would
like all of us to consider the underly-
ing motives of those running for pub-
lic offices and remind those who hold
them who serves what and what
serves whom.

If the sum total of the individual
ballots decides the election and if the
majority of the individual ballots
have not been based upon rational
grounds, then the elected candidates
have been chosen either non-rational-
ly or irrationally. Our own ballot is
relatively insignificant when com-
pared to the rest, but it is very cru-
cial that we make it, and make it ra-
tionally.

If more of us actually considered
who we were voting for, and for what
reasons, I think a lot of us would end
up voting for persons other than

those we originally intended to. Even
if we end up voting for the same can-
didate, at least we have made a wiser
choice.

There lies a parallel here to our-
selves as students. If we strictly con-
sider our education here as a means
to an end and our GPA proportional
to how much money we'll make later
in life, then I believe we’re here for
the wrong purpose. Everywhere you
hear of student apathy and profes-
sors’ contempt for students and
wonder why.

It seems too many of us value our
grades over what we as students
have learned. Just because we have
received a poor grade in class doesn’t
mean that we haven't learned any-
thing. I have often learned more
from classes I received a poor grade
in than one I have received a good
grade in. If coeducation brings in an
avant-garde of new students with dif-
ferent values toward education, then
I’m all for it.

S. African foes hypocritical

To the Editors:

I was highly amused by reading
last week’s Phi article about law Pro-
fessor William Geimer’s proposed
protest against South Africa, whose
government is characterized by an
apartheid policy of white supremacy.
Mr. Geimer and those helping him
are typical of liberals everywhere
— misguided and hypocritical. Like
the Kennedy kids and others who
have made it a fad to be arrested-in-
protest, Geimer is directing his at-
tention to the least of the evils.
Wouldn’t it be great if we saw Gei-
mer protesting the oppressive Sandi-
nista regime, or genocidal war in
Afghanistan or the persecution of the
Church in Poland? Or better yet, why
don’t we see Geimer protesting US.
commercial relations with the Soviet
Union, whose tyranny over its people
is as well knownas it is deplorable?

Instead, these ‘‘protesters’’ at
W&L and those on a greater scale
decry a government which has re-
cently drawn up a new constitution
and repealed a number of repressive
regulations aimed at blacks. It’s a
government which spends millions of
dollars annually to make blacks
more self-sufficient and better edu-
cated. Even ‘‘60 Minutes’’ told of
over a million black illegal immi-
grants who were drawn from their
own black-led oppressive dictator-
ships to South Africa’s better wages,

Ex-colum

To the Editors:

I would like to correct a misstate-
ment of fact by the Ring-tum Phi’s
chief editors in last week’s “‘Readers’
Advocate’ column.

Last summer I agreed to write the
“Readers’ Advocate’ column this
school year. The column never got off
the ground because of a disagree-
ment between the Phi’s chief editors
and myself over how much control
they would have over its content.
Chief Editors Mike Allen and Bruce
Potter wanted to delete some rather
innocuous — but relevant — informa-
tion from my first column last fall.

Last week Peter Wright, the new
‘Readers’ Advocate,”’ reported that
the editors claim ‘‘they merely
wanted to discuss and question some
of the information and had no inten-
tion of deleting it’’ without my appro-
val.

This was not the case. I have the
original copy of my column in which
the information is clearly marked out
by an editor’s red pen. Errors of style
and spelling had been corrected and
column and type sizes were indicated
at the top. It appears everything was
ready for it to be set in type.

If the editors just wanted to discuss
possible changes, why had they al-
ready edited the column and taken
out the information? In fact, what
transpired after they told me of the
changes was not a discussion: It was
a heated argument. I held to my con-
tention that if I was to objectively
and honestly evaluate the Phi’s co-
verage — the purpose of the ‘‘Advo-
cate’ column in the first place — I
could not allow them to delete infor-
mation I thought important. Both
Potter and Allen seemed surprised at
my objection. Allen told me that if
the editors could edit the column for
style, grammar and spelling, then
they could certainly take out infor-
mation they thought gave the wrong
impression.

Neither of the facts they wanted to
delete gave the wrong impression. In
my column, which dealt with Allen’s
coverage of the murder-and-arson in-
dictment of Scot Mesner, I noted that
Allen had ‘‘scooped’’ his competition,
including the Roanoke Times &
World-News, in getting an exclusive
interview with Mesner before he was
picked up by police. (The charges
have since been thrown out.) I
thought this information helped ex-
plain why Allen rushed to call Mes-
ner in Roanoke after the indictment
was announced in Lexington. But the
editors told me they didn’t want to
give readers the impression that they
were in competition with the

living and working conditions and ed-
ucational opportunities.

These positives are the very condi-
tions Geimer and friends want to
abolish by their demands. Many pro-
testers on the national level agree,
calling for total workplace desegre-
gation, training and promotions for
blacks and improved outside-the-
workplace conditions for blacks em-
ployed by U.S. corporations. The
more radical minds call for a total
disinvestment by U.S. firms. Bishop
Desmond Tutu, currently the liberal
patron saint, loves these ideas; how-
ever, one must beware of Tutu, who
backs the African National Congress,
which supports violence for ending
apartheid. For such views, Tutu
recently won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Geimer, et al, should listen to
others, such as Chief Gatsha Buthlezi
of the 6 million member Zulu tribe in
South Africa and head of the largest
political party there. ‘“‘Black people
of South Africa have not said they
want disinvestment,” Buthelezi said,
adding that ‘75 percent reject it.”
These comments are from a black
leader in South Africa, not a profes-
sor in Virginia.

What is. strikingly dangerous
(read: liberal) about Geimer’s views
is that;he wants not only the United
States government to sanction South
Africa, but he wants private corpor-
ations to do the same. Our govern-

nist gives

Roanoke paper. Just two days be-
fore, however, Allen had told me that
I would ‘‘never set foot’’ in the Phi’s
office if I ever took information from
‘Readers’ Advocate”’ interviews and
gave it to the Roanoke Times, which I
work for as a correspondent during
the school year. This does not sound
like the words of an editor who does
not consider himself in competition
with another paper.

In my column I also noted that
Allen had requested the column after
hearing criticism from a local police
official. Allen said he didn’t want to
give the impression that the ‘‘Read-
ers’ Advocate” columist was too
close to the Phi’s editors. This is
ridiculous. I was only noting to read-
ers where the idea for my column
had come from. I was not reporting
that I had been ordered to write it.

By trying to delete this informa-
tion, the editors were attempting to
do exactly what they wanted to not
give the impression they were doing
— tampering with the content of my
column. Their hostility to my objec-
tions only strengthened my fears
that, if there came a time when I
really criticized the Phi’s coverage,
my opinions might be watered down
by editing or never get into the paper.
After all, my first column had gener-
ally praised the Phi’s coverage and
the editors still wanted to make
changes.

There was one sidelight to our dis-
agreement. The editors also express-
ed concern that my work for the Roa-
noke Times might hinder my loyalty
to The Phi. I replied that I did not feel
my loyalty to The Phi was important,
since I understood my duties to be
those of an outside critic and not
those of an apologist for the Phi’s ac-
tions. I suggested that, to avoid my
discovering unpublished information
from The Phi, I would conduct all
interviews outside of the Phi’s office
and that the editors should not feel
obligated to answer if I inadvertently
asked questions that might uncover
sensitive facts. I also noted to the
editors that Allen was a correspon-
dent for the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch. In fact, the information from
the Mesner interview, billed as ‘‘an
exclusive’ in The Phi, had actually
appeared the day before in a story by.
Allen for the Times-Dispatch.
(Wright, as news director for the
campus radio and television stations,
also occasionally competes with The
Phi on news stories. )

The discussion ended after both
sides agreed that my column would
not run and that I would not continue

ment has no right to dictate to a com-
pany where or on what conditions it
can or cannot do business, except in
cases of extreme national security
reasons. Mr. Geimer would find it
impossible to prove such a case exist-
ed in South Africa. If the U.S. govern-
ment doesn’t want to have relations
with that country, fine. If Mr. Geimer
doesn’t want to buy the products of
companies with investments in South
Africa, that is fine too. But Geimer’s
views become alarming when he
calls for sanctions and disinvestment
by private corporations.

Those corporations Geimer is so
upset with have given more than $78
million for medical, housing and edu-
cational expenses to South African
black employees and their families
between 1978 and 1983. This was $78
million more than they had to pro-
vide, since a company is required to
do nothing for its employees not
related to work. Yet these corpora-
tions used their own money to help
black employees. Geimer, on the
other hand, is of the opinion that
sanctions and disinvestment would
help the South African black. A man
of Geimer’s education and research
experience should put two and two
together and get four. In his effort to
help the South African, he is foolishly
doing the opposite.

as the ‘Readers’ Advocate.” Only
after I was handed back my column
did Allen weakly offer that the edi-
tors had only wanted to discuss the
changes.

Perhaps our disagreement stem-
med from the past history of the col-
umn, Scott Mason, last year’s ‘‘Read-
ers’ Advocate,”’ told me of one occa-
sion on which a past editor ordered
him not to do a column airing criti-
cism of The Phi. I can see how the
present chief editors, who were on
the paper’s staff at the time, might
have gotten the wrong impression
about the role of the ‘Readers’ Ad-
vocate.”

I hope that the ‘“‘Readers’ Advo-
cate’’ is back on track now and that
Peter Wright will have the ‘‘complete
editorial control’ that the editors
promised on last week’s front page. I
was not given such control. Perhaps
the editors have realized that, as the
source and messenger of criticism
about the University, they have the
responsibility to open themselves up
to the same scrutiny. Such freedom
of expression can only make Wash-
ington and Lee a better place.

It is a shame, however, that this
realization came only after the con-
troversy that surrounded their hand-
ling of Steve Pockrass’ letter March
7. The aftermath included stern criti-
cism from journalism Professor
Clark Mollenhoff, whose recommen-
dations wield much influence when
W&L students seek reporting jobs
after graduation. If the Phi’s editors
respond to my letter, I hope that they
will give me the courtesy — one
denied Pockrass — of allowing me
my say first, I also hope
they will avoid questioning my
character and commpetence and in-
stead deal with the substantive issues
I’ve raised — once again, a courtesy
denied Pockrass.

‘Rag-tag’

Tight budget doesn’t check Hockey Club

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Ice
Hockey Club faces some inherent
problems in its quest to have fun and
stay competitive, according to the
club’s president, senior Burt Palmer

The basic assumption of ice hockey
is, of course, that one plays the game
on ice. Finding this ice, however, re
mains the biggest hindrance to the
club, because the only available rink
equipped to handle hockey is the Lan
cerlot Arena in Vinton

Because Vinton is the only ice
around, every hockey team in the
area needs to use it, and ice time is
scarce. The W&L club currently
practices only twice a month, accord
ing to Palmer, and usually must
share ice with another team

This lack of practice time, Palmer
said, makes it difficult for the play-
ers to stay in condition, and that lack
of conditioning affects the way the
team plays,

“We run four offensive units and

three defensive units so that each line
plays for only a couple of minutes,’
“It's really hard to keep
since we're not in

he said
fresh otherwise
top shape.”

Then there’s the problem of trans
portation. The University does not
allow club teams to use its fleet of
vans for games, so the club must ar
range other means. “‘It gets pretty
confusing,’ Palmer said

The team also faces a money short
age. The student Executive Commit
tee awarded the club $620 this year,
and each of the club’s 22 members
pay $25 in dues, for a total of about
$1,100. All of this money, Palmer
said, is spent on ice time and other
operating expenses. Each member
must supply his own equipment

The club borrows old football jer
seys from the athletic department for
its games, “It’s a rag-tag outfit,”’
senior Steve Carey said.

Palmer did not complain about the
situation, though. ‘The EC has a
tight budget, and they have been in-
creasing our funding each year for
the nact four vears IT just hope they

keep it up.”’

\ lot of that personally furnished
equipment serves double duty on
W&L lacrosse fields, as the club in
cludes several current or former
W&L lacrosse players. Most of the
players are from the North, Palmer
said, where hockey is more common
in the high schools and prep schools

   

 

Despite these problems, the club
manages to stay competitive
“We've got a lot of talent,” Carey
said. ‘And we can mix it up with
anybody.”

“Steve Carey can mix it up with
anybody,’’ Palmer added

The club’s next encounter will be
March 22-23 ina tournament in North
Carolina that will include club teams
from Duke University and Fort
Bragg

Next year, the elub will be led by
current treasurer Vin LaManna, and
Palmer sees continued success. ‘‘As
long as we can get our 20 to 25 players
each year as we've been doing in the
past four years, things will continue
to get better,”’ he said.

a direct mailing campaign
—‘something we haven't been doing
in the past.”

Since the campaign began, be-
tween 6,000 and 8,000 minority stu
dents have been sent information
about W&L.

The effort has yielded 34 applica
tions from black high school seniors,
including 13 women, for admission
next fall. Seven of the 13 have been
accepted, one on the Early Decision
program. Of the 21 black men who
applied, 17 have been offered admis
sion.

Pate said the remaining applicants
could be accepted ata later date.

Names of minority students are ob-
tained from such programs as A Bet-
ter Chance Inc. (ABC), the National
Achievement Scholarship Program
and Leadership Education and De-
velopment

DeCourcy’s goal as the organizer
of W&L’s effort to recruit minorities
is to establish a mailing list of be-
tween 500 and 1,000 minority coun-
selors and placement officials. He
said the mailings help generate a
great deal of interest in W&L.

Also,. DeCourcy attended several
ABC functions in Connecticut during
the fall to generate interest. He said

that limited time, however, restricts
his role as an ‘‘ambassador.”’

Mike Webb, a black sophomore
who was elected secretary of the Ex-
ecutive Committee last week and
who is a member of the Student Re-
cruitment Committee, said he ap-
plauds the Admissions Office efforts.

Webb said it is especially difficult
to attract black students from the
North because many of them and
their parents view the South as a
place of racial discrimination.

“By and large, once they are down
here things are OK,” hesaid.

Webb said that everyone must
enter new situations with an open
mind — including black students. ‘‘If
they’re separated, it's mainly
something by choice,” he said.

Seven black men and three black
women are among students the Uni-
versity has invited to spend three
days attending classes, meeting pro
fessors and getting a taste of the
social life. Students arrive late on a
Thursday and leave on a Saturday
after an interview with admissions
officers. The University pays the
complete cost of their travel, from as
far away as California

Three other black students will be
on campus this week.

Webb said his job with Student Re-
cruitment is to be ‘‘Mr. Cruise Direc-
tor to, make sure these kids have a
goodtime.” ~ oS

“People have been very impressed

with the academic atmosphere,” De-
Courcy said.

“People who have put us down as
just another school have put us at the
top of the list of the schools they want
tocome to,” he added.

DeCourcy said another resource
for attracting minority students is
minority alumni. He said that if each
black alumni would direct two black
students to W&L, “‘it would be a big
help.”

Eugene C. Perry Jr., who grad-
uated from W&L in 1975 and from the
law school in 1978 and who is current-
ly a special agent for the FBI, is
organizing a group of black alumni
for recruiting purposes.

According to James D. Farrar, ad-
missions director from 1962 to 1978
and now coordinator of alumni ad-
missions programs, ‘‘we're in an ab-
solutely new ball game in terms of at-
tracting students.”

‘You have to look back and realize
that in the sixties there just wasn’t
the effort to attract minorities,” he
said.

In 1966, the first black student “in
modern times” enrolled at W&L,
Farrar said. ‘‘And 1970 was the year
we really broke the line,’’ he added,
referring to the 15 blacks who enroll-
ed that year.

Between 1966 and 1976, 55 black stu-
dents enrolled at W&L. Between 1978
anid 1982, 37 blatk students enrolled,
14in 1980 and seven in 1982.

Outbreaks prompt infirmary

to inoculate against measles L

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The University infirmary is plan-
ning to give measles vaccinations to
about 400 students next week in
response to recent outbreaks at six
colleges, according to University
physician Dr. Frederick A. Fed-
deman.

The American College Health
Association sent a letter to health
services at colleges across the coun-
try urging that students be in-
oculated before their spring breaks,
Feddeman said.

Three people have died at Prin-
cipia College in Elsah, Ill., from com-
plications arising from red measles,
or rubeola. The college, operated by
the Christian Science Church, whose
members favor religious healing
over medical treatment, quarantined
itself after 112 people came down
with the disease.

In addition, Boston University
reported 65 cases of measles, Ohio
State University reported 13, and the

Art, writing

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

 

Although some details still need to
be ironed out, a handful of enterpris-
ing students are attempting to start a
literary magazine made up of work
by students from Washington and
Lee, Hampden-Sydney and the wo-
men’s colleges.

Freshman Anthony Cornealius has
been vocal in organizing the project
and on Monday presented his ideas to
the Executive Committee.

“The goal is to unify the schools on
a literary and artistic level and de-
velop and appreciation for each
school on this level,” Cornealius said.

As of this week, Mary Baldwin Col-

Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, Boston College and North-
eastern University reported at least
one case each.

Most of the affected schools have
begun inoculation programs.

Feddeman said it is important to
have students inoculated before
spring break, because the chance of
the disease spreading will increase
when students converge on Florida
for their vacations.

“That’s the big thing that worries
me: You don’t know who you're go-
ing to be mingling with,’’ he said.

The nurses in the infirmary have
been going through students’ records
to determine which students don’t
need shots, either because they have
already had them or because they
have had the disease.

Seniors make up 250 of the students
on the infirmary’s list, Feddeman
said, because the infirmary has no
record of whether they have had
shots. The University didn’t require
measles records of its students until
after the Class of 1985 entered.

lege, Hollins College and Southern
Seminary Junior College have com-
mitted to participating in the pro-
ject.Cornealius said he still is work-
ing to ensure participation by Hamp-
den-Sydney College, Randolph-Ma-
con Woman’s College and Sweet
Briar College. A meeting for in-
terested students will be held today
or Monday, Cornealius said.

Cornealius has proposed a 40-page
magazine, but that length is tentative
for a number of reasons. First, it only
is feasible if enough schools partici-
pate, he said, and second, the cost
may limit the number of pages that
can be published.

The projected cost for the as-yet-
unnamed magazine is $3,500. This
money will be raised through a $400-

Feddeman said students will be
asked if they have had either the
disease or the shots before. If any
doubts remain, the shots probably
will be administered because there is
no danger in having them twice in a
lifetime.

“The vaccine’s not that dangerous
at all,’’ Feddeman said.

The infirmary expects to send let-
ters or call students who need the
shots, Feddeman said, although
students can’t be required to get the
shots.

Red measles is a viral disease that
causes a fever and a facial rash for
as long as 10 days. The disease itself
is not fatal, but secondary infections
such as bronchitis and tuberculosis
can be fatal.

“I’ve been here 30 years, and I
don’t recall ever seeing red measles
here,”’ Feddeman said.

One of the reasons the disease is
cropping up among college-age
students, he said, is that when the
vaccination was first developed in
1963, it was administered to children
less than 1 vear old, and the immuni-

ty disappeared. The vaccinations
were then given to children over 1
and the problem was solved, but
children remained who weren’t im-
mune.

Feddeman said he might be able to
get the Lexington Health Depart-
ment to help pay for the costs of the
inoculations.

“In a situation like this, I think we
can probably get them to supply the
vaccine,”’ he said.

$500 contribution from each school. If
enough money isn’t raised in this
manner, patrons may be contacted
for contributions and advertisements
might be sold, Cornealius said. He
told the EC Monday that he will be re-
questing a specific amount of money
next week.

Although time permits only one
issue this year, Cornealius said he
hopes to produce the magazine twice
a year in the future.

The publication will consist of
poetry, essays and short stories.
However, Cornealius said he is cer-
tain this magazine will be different
from the Ariel, a literary magazine
already funded by the EC, in a num-
ber of ways.

“Unlike the Ariel and other maga-

zines,’’ Cornealius said, ‘‘we plan to
use new techniques. For instance,
very few blend the artwork with the
poem and make them each a part.”’

In other words, Cornealius hopes to
design the magazine so that the writ-
ten word will be printed in direct con-
junction with the artwork, in some
cases with the poem or essay directly
on top of the artwork.

In addition, the writers will work
directly with the magazine’s artist in
creating an illustrated interpretation
of the poems.

“There are some arguments on the
look,’’ Cornealius said. ‘‘Some don’t
like the idea of the art, but I feel it
sets us apart. We are striving to
create the art and the poem
together.”’

$677,000 pavilion called ‘tremendous asset’

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

Now in its third month of full-time
use, the student activities pavilion,
even with its $677,000 price tag, is a
benefit to the University, according
to Associate Dean of Students Mich-
ael A. Cappeto.

Cappeto, the faculty adviser for
pavilion activities, called the enter-
tainment/athletic facility ‘‘a tremen-
dous asset.”

“‘T would like to see it used more,”
he said. ‘‘But it is already serving the
purpose for which we had intended
ig!

The costs of the pavilion, which
was built during the summer and
completed during the fall term,
break down as follows: $277,000 came
from the University, and the student
body paid $400,000 financed by a loan
from the University at 91% percent for
25 years.

The student body is paying back

  

Editors

the loan through a $25 addition to the
student tax, which is paid as part of
tuition. At the end of 25 years, stu-
dents will have paid more than $1
million for the pavilion.

According to University Treasurer
E. Stewart Epley, ‘If the $400,000
had been left with the professional
endowment investors, it would have
created, within 20 to 25 years, ap-
proximately $1.3 million in reve-
nues.”’

A final cost incurred by the pavi-
lion is the annual $15,000 operating
expense, which goes to gas, electrici-
ty, water and sewage, and is not sup-
plemented by any revenues from
pavilion activities.

On the benefits side, the additional
activities students can be involved in
with the pavilion are almost endless.

“In comparison to other schools in
our league, few if any colleges have
comparable facilities,’ Associate
Athletic Director Richard Miller
Said.

The pavilion is used for University-

wide social activities, intercollegiate
athletic practices and _ physical
education classes during inclement
weather, student organizations’ — in-
cluding fraternities — social events
and, according to Cappeto, ‘‘any rea-
sonable request by the students.”’

The athletic department uses the
pavilion Monday through Thursday,
according to the guidelines set for its
use. Miller said athletes are much
safer in the pavilion, with its softer
athletics-oriented Mondoflex floor,
than they are outside in the rain or in-
side Warner Center, with its hard-
wood floor.

“The facility meets the basic
need,’’ Miller said, ‘‘but it’s not ade-
quate in size.”

The athletics department had
wanted a facility that was big enough
to hold an indoor track. It is only big
enough to house a tennis court.

Any organization that wants to use
the pavilion must make reservations
with Cappeto and pay a $50 down pay-
ment toward the $75 total fee. Also,

and Managers

the group must either provide its own
cleanup or pay the University to doit.

The $75 cost goes to pay a student
manager who must be present.

Another benefit of the pavilion is a
less obvious one.

‘We want to make it as easy as
possible for students to stay on cam-
pus,’’ Cappeto said.

A party facility close to campus re-
duces wear on fraternity houses and
keep students from drinking and
driving, Cappeto said.

The University has $67,000 remain-
ing from the original cost of the pavi-
lion. Epley said that would be used to
complete the access road and park-
ing facilities.

Cappeto also said additions to the
pavilion are in the offing.

‘‘By next fall picnic tables and bar-
becue equipment will be installed
along the hillside next to the pavi-
lion,” he said. ‘‘These facilities will
be available to all students at all
times.”’

Coed switch

proved

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

 

Changing from an all-male college
to a coed college was ‘‘easier than
expected,’ according to the presi-
dent of Davidson College when it
made that transition in 1972.

Samuel R. Spencer Jr., president
of Davidson from 1968 to 1983, said
that the switch was easy in an institu-
tional sense. Davidson did not have to
change its academic program when
it went coed, although the universi-
ty’s facilities had to be changed to ac-
commodate women, he added.

Spencer, who is now president of
the Virginia Foundation for Indepen-
dent Colleges, spoke at last Thurs-
day’s Phi Beta Kappa/Society of the
Cincinnati Convocation and met with
the Coeducation Steering Committee.

The transition years at Davidson
were toughest on the first few classes
of women, Spencer said in an inter-
view, because the large imbalance in
the number of men and women on
campus made the social life at Da-
vidson difficult at first.

“The women were pioneers. The
first women were a bit conspicuous.
They naturally felt a bit self-con-
scious,’’ Spencer said. Everyone at
Davidson tried very hard to make the
women feel comfortable, however,

Coeducation:

 

What Will It Mean?

 

  
   
       
     
  
 
     
   
    

Spencer said. But there were no wo-
men’s groups on campus at the time
to provide additional support for the
first women,

Nevertheless, Spencer said that the
university avoided any really serious
problems during the transition.

One area where there were pro-
blems during the transition years
was in the athletic department, he
added.

“T don’t think we planned well
enough in sports,”’ Spencer remark-
ed. “In the sports area they [the
women] did feel that we were slow in
responding to their needs.”’

Spencer said Davidson tried to
meet women’s demands for sports as
they arose, and now has a sound
women’s athletics program in place.

A second area in which Davidson
encountered some unexpected pro-
blems was in that of health care,

SAMUEL R. SPENCER JR.
Transition ‘‘easier than expected”’

Spencer reported. Although no major ”
additions were needed in Davidson’s .
health care services, some changes
were necessary to provide for wo- *
men’s health care needs when the
school went coed.

A lot of planning and several years
of preparing the students, faculty
and alumni for the possible switch to
coeducation were the keys to the ease
of the transition, Spencer said. The
Davidson administration tried to_
avoid making decisions by fiat or °
order, he added. /

One of the university’s first moves _
in testing the waters to see how coed-
ucation would go over at Davidson «
was to begin bringing in a small
number of women exchange students
during the late 60s. Spencer said. He
added that it was important to see
how women would be accepted at Da-
vidson before making the decision to |"”
go coed in 1972. ‘

Spencer cited an improved social
life and a more qualified student
body as two of the most important »
benefits of the switch to coeducation.

Davidson was a “‘suitcase college’
before it went coed, Spencer said.
Many of the students were off cam-,
pus on weekends at women’s colleges
when the school was all-male.

“This [coeducation] has made for
a campus that has a much more
healthier social life,’ Spencer said.

Academically, Spencer said that ,,
after going coed Davidson experienc-
ed improvements in the quality of its ©
admission candidates similar to.
those W&L has experienced this
year. Spencer said this was the natu-*’
ral result of both the availability of,
women students and the ability of the
school to attract men who did not
want to go toan all-male college.

and the Campus Shop (formerly
Campus Corner), say they’ve had re-
quests for the singles and plan to
have them in stock by tomorrow.

The song, released nationally last
Thursday, was written by Michael
Jackson and Lionel Richie and is
available on both a 7-inch and a 12-
inch single. Half a million copies of
the 7-inch single and 150,000 copies of
the 12-inch single were released.

An album, featuring the single and
unreleased songs by Prince, Linda
Ronstadt and Bruce Springsteen, is
planned for release April 1.

Approximately 70 percent of the
proceeds from the effort will go to
charity, according to CBS, which is
releasing the records. Ninety percent
of that will go to African relief and
the rest will be used to aid the hungry
and homeless in America.

The single was recorded in Los
Angeles in January at a recording
session that included Springs’zen,

Richie, Jackson. Tina Turner, Bob
Dylan, Cyndi Lauper, Stevie Wonde'
and Willie Nelson. ‘

“We Are The World” is on the play:
list of WLUR-FM, according to sta-
tion manager Bob Bryant, but it i*
not being given specific priority over
other songs. ‘‘We more or less leave
it up to the disc jockeys,” Bryant
said.

He added that it is being played
quite a bit on the station’s Morning
Magazine show.

In a related effort, Maj. Stephen
RiCharde, assistant professor of psy-
chology at Virginia Military Insts
tute, organized a Christmas party to
raise money for African relief.

Guests at the party made donations
at the door, and the event raised
about $1,300. RiCharde said mone,
was donated to OXFAM America, a°
organization that works on a loca!
level in Africa to combat hunger.
About 75 percent of the money dé’
nated will be used for actual food that
will be sent to Africa, and the other 25
percent will be used for working wit
local farmers to help educate them in
more modern agricultural methods,
he said.

RiCharde said the party was 4
community effort involving local
merchants who donated snacks art!
mixers and the faculties of both VMI
and Washington and Lee. -

he had a possible cracked jaw and
several loose teeth but no broken
bones.

“He looked like he’d gotten beaten
up really badly,’’ Sanders said.

The crash occurred about one-
fourth of a mile from the Windfall
driveway, Sanders said, adding that
the tree the car hit is very close to the
roadway.

Some of the fraternity members
still at Windfall heard the crash, ac-
cording to Sanders. Three of them
discovered the wreck shortly there-
after on their way back to the frater-
nity house.

Five SAEs and one other student
live at Windfall, which Sanders said
has been “‘in the fraternity’’ for about
15 years.

He said the gathering had been
over for more than an hour when
Hunter and Henson left.

“Everybody who saw Ed did not
think he was drunk,’’ Sanders said.

 

: “We wouldn’t have let him drive if he
- was. No one thought he was drunk —I

don’t see how he could have been.”’
Sanders said there were 64 people

. and only one keg of beer at the
_ gathering. ‘‘There was no organized
. drinking,” he said.

The driving under the influence

é charge was filed, Hamilton said,

because ‘‘through my investigation, I
could determine that alcohol was in-

- volved.”

Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
who talked with Hunter’s parents and
who said he has been in ‘‘constant
contact’’ with the members of SAE,
said news of the death ‘‘hit everyone
very hard — especially his friends in
his fraternity.”

“The initial impact is always dif-
ficult,”’ he said. ‘‘The initial concern
is that a friend is dead.

“Then you get into questions of
why and how it happened and these
other concerns are raised.”’

A memorial service for Hunter in

Lee Chapel yesterday afternoon was
attended by about 300 administra-
tors, professors, W&L students and
students from area women’s col-
leges. Psalms were read by
Sanders and by SAE sophomore W.
Barritt Gilbert of Rome, Ga.

University Chaplain David W.
Sprunt prayed for the families of
both Hunter and Henson. He spoke of
“the dark confusion in our minds as
we ask the unanswered question of,
‘Why?’ ”’

At Monday’s Executive Committee
meeting, presiding officer Sam
Dalton asked for a moment of silence
for Hunter. ‘‘He was a good friend of
mine and I think we all knew him,”
Dalton said.

Phi Delta Theta on Monday sent a
letter of sympathy signed by all its
members. ‘‘That was an incredibly
nice gesture,’ Sanders said. ‘“‘We
really did appreciate it.”

Hunter’s family has said that dona-
tions may be made in his name to the
football program at Darlington Pre-
paratory School in Rome, Ga:

Contributions may be sent to the
Darlington fund in care of Gray San-
ders, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 205 E.
Washington St.

Sanders said the fraternity’s
Bahamas Party — ‘‘one of our big-
gest parties’”’ — had been scheduled
for tomorrow but has been cancelled.
At the party, there traditionally is a
drawing for a four-day trip for two to
the Bahamas.

He said the money that would have
been spent on the party is being
donated to the Darlington fund, and
each member of SAE is contributing
an additional $20.

SAE has a number of house renova-
tions planned for this summer. A
drawing by Hunter of the house and
its members will be placed per-
manently in one of the rooms, which
will be named for him.

The fraternity also is planning to
purchase a memorial page for
Hunter in The Calyx.

SAE’s pledge initiation, which had
been set for Saturday in Lee Chapel,
has been postponed until Wednesday.

Road deaths

Drinking, driving called additional hazard on rural roads

 

From Staff Reports

 

The incidents blot the memory of nearly every
student generation:

Feb. 22, 1970: Returning from a debate tourna-
ment, a Washington and Lee professor and a jun-
ior are killed at 5 a.m. when their car hits a guard
rail and spins out of control after the driver falls
asleep at the wheel.

*May 14, 1975: Three W&L students returning
from an away lacrosse game die in a single-car ac-
cident on Interstate 81.

*Sept. 25, 1982: Three Virginia Military Institute
cadets and one Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
student are killed after the driver loses con-
trol of the car on U.S. 11 about three miles out of
Lexington.

eMarch 17, 1985: Returning from a fraternity
gathering in the country, a W&L junior dies in-
stantly as the car in which he is riding twice runs
off the road, finally hurtling into a roadside tree.

These are just four of the incidents on a numbing
list of fatal automobile accidents involving
area students in recent years.

The haunting, inevitable questions: Who's
next? It could be you. When? It could be this
weekend.

Young people and automobiles often have been
said to be a lethal combination. When alcohol and
this area’s treacherous roads are added to the
mix, the potential for disaster is terrifying.

Junior John Lewis, for example, frequently
travels to local women’s colleges. ‘‘These are
crazy roads,” he said. “I find it amazing that
more people aren’t killed.”’

‘The road to Sweet Briar is probably the worst
road in the state,’ he continued. ‘‘Randolph-
Macon is the same way — I don’t see how anybody
can drive 501 with more than one beer.

“Hollins isn’t too bad — straight down 81; Mary
Baldwin is straight up 81. But these others are pro-
bably some of the most dangerous roads in the
country.”

Dean of Students Lewis G. John agreed, noting
that many area roads are ‘‘quite dangerous.”

“Particularly going over to Randolph-Macon,

ned to exchange ideas and allow new EC members to ask

questions of the current committee.

Communication with the student body will be an
important part of next year’s EC, all three officers
agreed. As secretary, Webb will be responsible for hand-
ling the minutes at EC meetings. These, along with an
agenda for meetings, are two ways in which he hopes to
inform the student body of the EC’s activities. He feels
the job is a two-way street, however, and hopes to bring
ideas into the EC as well as report them through the

minutes. .

A lot of the inside jokes and lack of seriousness that
have been common in the EC minutes are unnecessary,
Webb said. Caruthers agrees. ‘‘I think the minutes
should definitely be serious because that’s our only way
of communication with the student body,”’ he said. ‘‘And
although we may try to break the monotony of meetings
in here, I don’t think that should carry over into the
minutes because people don’t know how to take that.”’

An issue that has been discussed recently is the pro-
posal to add an ad hoc woman member to the EC next
year, providing that a woman is not elected. Among the
Big Three, there is a rift regarding this question.

Webb favors the appointment of a non-voting woman
to the EC if one is not elected. It is important, he said, to
maintain the ‘appearance of fairness’ in honor mat-
ters. If a woman is accused of an honor violation, Webb
thinks she should have someone on the EC she can talk
to, rather than having to face a committee of all men.

Caruthers and Lewis disagree with Webb.

“I’m not for overcompensating or tokenism,”’ Caru-
thers said, adding that he is “‘strongly against”’ the pro-
posal. There is nothing that precludes a woman from be-

Spanton explains wasted taxes

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

“Of the $150 billion spent each year
on defense procurement, almost one-
third of that is wasted on excessive
costs and billings and goes straight
down the drain.”

That’s what former defense audi-
tor and ‘‘whistleblower’George R.
Spanton told those in Lee Chapel on
Tuesday was happening to their tax
dollars.

In a speech sponsored by the jour-
nalism department and the Washing-
ton and Lee chapter of the Society of
Professional Journalists, Sigma
Delta Chi, Spanton said the Depart-
ment of Defense and the major de-
fense contractors are depriving the
country of the maximum defense
possible because of excessive costs.

“These greedy individuals [de-
fense contractors] are destroying our
country through economic blackmail
and they know it and continue to do
it,” he said.

Spanton told the audience of nearly
200 that defense contractors dictate
terms to the Defense Department,
which will accept whatever they ask.
“T’ve yet to see a general say, ‘It’s
too expefsive, don’t buy it,’”’ he
said.

Because government military con-
tracts usually are for several years,
the threat of contractors’ overspend-
ing f very real. Yet even when they
do go over their planned budgets,
contractors still expect to get paid for
these additional expenses, Spanton
said.

Spanton used General Dynamics,
the makers of the Navy’s new attack
submarines, as an example. He said
that when the cost of each submarine
went over budget by $50 million, Gen-
eral Dynamics just passed that cost
on to the Defense Department.

Because the military ‘‘desperate-
ly’’ needed the submarines, it was

Sweet Briar or Goshen, for example, the roads are
very hazardous,” he said. “I try to caution fresh-
men every year during orientation about the
hazards of the roads around here.”’

John said that until this weekend, it had ‘‘been
some time”’ since the last fatal wreck involving a
W&L student. ‘I’m frankly surprised we don’t
have more of them,’’ he said.

“On occasion, we’ve had one every year for
several years in a row,”’ he continued. ‘‘We’ve
been very fortunate in recent years, but when we
do have one, that doesn’t erase the tragedy of that
one.”’

“T think students often have a feeling it can’t
happen to them,” he said. “I think it takes
something like this to make us realize it can hap-
pen to us and to me individually.”

John said that one key to keeping students alive
is keeping them off the rural roads and in Lex-
ington.

“That is one of the major reasons behind
building the pavilion — to have events here on
campus rather than driving to Zollman’s on nar-
row, winding roads,”’ he said.

He added that coeducation might have a similar
effect. ‘If in fact Washington and Lee males date
Washington and Lee females, I think there’d be
more of a tendency to date on campus or in the
vicinity rather than having to travel an hour or so
for a date,” he explained.

John was asked if the dangers of drinking and
driving are very high in the consciousness of W&L
students. ‘‘I really don’t think so,’’ he said. ‘‘I wish
they thought about it more.”’

“Perhaps there has been some consciousness
raising through various educational efforts, but I
guess my basic answer would be ‘no — not nearly
enough.’ ”

Some students have expressed concern that the
new rules restricting fraternities to four party
weekends a term are causing many houses to
“party in the country or down the road”
— increasing the risk of automobile accidents.

“Tt may have that effect,’’ John said. ‘I honest-
ly don’t know. We really have to re-evaluate that
whole set of rules.”’

“Tf, in fact, that’s what’s happening, we need to

willing to pay any additional costs to
get them. Spanton said the govern-
ment always would give in because
the contractors would otherwise re-
fuse to give up the completed wea-
pons,

In effect, ‘‘General Dynamics is
holding the government and the peo-
ple hostage with regard to our na-
tional security,” he said.

These excessive costs came from
‘‘overhead business expenses” added
on to production bills, according to
Spanton. Everything from golf trips
to vacations, chili cookoffs to
political donations and excessive
salaries would be added to govern-
ment contracts, he said.

While the rest of the country was in
an economic slump, contractors such
as Pratt and Whitney would be pay-
ing employees 15 to 25 percent more
than other comparative companies,
Spanton said. Pratt and Whitney had
more than 100 employees with sal-
aries above $100,000 at one plant
alone.

Executives were allowed to rent
cars to go to and from work. These
rental cars turned out to be BMWs,
Porsches and Mercedes. Officers
then would use their personal cars
for going to work and these rentals
for private use. Later, they would
buy the rental cars after their value
had depreciated.

Spanton, as an auditor, was to un-
cover this and other unnecessary ex-
penses. Yet, he said auditors and the
Department of Defense often were in
cahoots.

When he first began to audit the
Harris Corp., for example, he found
that auditors could have possession
of only half the accounts. When he
questioned this, Spanton was told,
“It’s all right, we've done it this way
for 25-30 years.”’

The life of a ‘‘whistleblower,”’ as
told by Spanton, is not an easy one.
He gave examples of attempts by his
employers, the Defense Contract

The Ring-tum Phi, March 21, 1985, Page 5

give some serious thought to finding other”’ social
rules, he added.

Associate Dean of Students Dan N. Murphy,
though, is uncertain that the party restrictions are
pushing many gatherings into the country.

_ “I don’t know if that’s the case or not,”’ he said.
“‘T have not gotten the feeling that there are very
many more parties outside the city limits.”

Rockbridge Sheriff S.M. Reynolds said sober
students should be able to negotiate county roads
with little difficulty. “If they go out tanked up,
that’s when you get into trouble,’’ he said. ‘‘But for
normal driving, there should be no problem.”

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton also defends
local roads. ‘‘The majority of the people who drive
these roads do not have accidents,” he said.
“Occasionally a deer will run out in front of a vehi-
cle and an accident can’t be avoided, but other-
wise accidents are not necessary.”

Like John, Sutton is doubtful that the hazard of
drinking and driving is a hot topic among stu-
dents. “It’s rarely discussed,’’ he said.

He said the police department offers a drinking
and driving presentation that explores ‘‘the legal
and physical aspects”’ of driving under the influ-
ence of alcohol and provides a general orientation
to the drunk driving problem.

Sigma Nu is scheduled to view the program
tomorrow. Sutton said the presentation is
available to any fraternity or other group.

Sutton said wearing seatbelts is critical because
“the body can become a missile inside the car
under certain conditions.”’

“The seatbelt provides safety from the stand-
point of keeping you from going through the wind-
shield,’’ he explained.

A mandatory seatbelt law for Virginia would be
a good idea, in Sutton’s view. ‘‘Anything for safe-
ty,” he said.

Sutton offered some possible solutions for a stu-
dent who needs to get from point ‘‘a’”’ to point ‘‘b”
but is intoxicated.

“Get somebody else to drive, call a cab or walk
— but don’t drive,’’ he said.

Sutton had a final word of advice: ‘The roads
here are not superhighways, and they should not
be driven as such.”

He even pointed out that Special
Counsel William O’Connor, responsi-
ble for protecting ‘‘whistleblowers,”’
said, “If you stick your head out, they
{the Defense Department] will just
blow it off.”’

Yet Spanton said his actions and
those of other ‘‘whistleblowers,”’
such as A. Ernest Fitzgerald, are
beginning to rock the boat. The con-
tractors have begun to classify all
their contracts as secret and to deny
auditors access to them. Among
these military secrets were toilet
seats being sold to the government
for $600.

He said that the DCAA should
become an entity separate from the
Defense Department and that offi-
cials who make illegal claims should
be put in jail and forced to pay for
any undue expenses.

 

former cadet

Virginia Military Institute on
Monday filed a $16,000 suit against
a former cadet for damage to a
statue of Gen. George C. Marshall
ina 1981 fire.

The civil action says Keith W.
Kuelz, of Blacksburg, on Feb. 28,
1981, intentionally threw gasoline
around the base of the statue, ig-
nited it and started a fire that did
“substantial and extensive da-
mage’’ to the statue.

Kuelz was enrolled at VMI from
the fall of 1979 through the sum-
mer of 1981. He did not graduate.

Bernard J. Natkin, VMI’s attor-
ney, explained the four-year delay
in the action. ‘‘They’ve been try-
ing to get the individual to pay the
damages voluntarily, and he
hasn’t done so,”’ he said.

Mental errors cost
lax; Terps win,11-5

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

Words such as courage, physical,
intense and competitive describe the
way the Washington and Lee lacrosse
team played against the University
of Maryland last Saturday on Wilson
Field. Although the Generals lost 11-5
to the Terrapins, the game was by far
the best outing of the Generals’
young season.

The Generals’ record now stands at
1-2. But if they had capitalized on a
few more situations, their record
easily could have been 2-1.

“Despite the final score, we played
our best game of the year,” said head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘‘The final score
was not an indication of how close the
game really was.”

The first half was anything but
close. The Terrapins scored three
unanswered goals in the first 15
minutes. The first two tallies came
from sophomore attackman Brian
Willard, who was like a thorn in the
side of the Generals’ defense all day.

With 9:23 left in the second quarter,
the Terps raised their lead to 40
when freshman attackman Tom Bed-
ard made it to the net. But less than
three minutes later, the Generals’
senior Sandy Brown finally gave the
3,232 fans in attendance a goal to
cheer about, making the score 4-1.

With two minutes left in the half,
the Generals had the ball again. The
offense slowed the tempo down, look-
ing for what would be the last shot of
the half. But the Generals lost the
ball, and the Terps moved down the
field quickly and scored to lead at the
half, 5-1.

Most people in the stands felt that
when Maryland scored its fifth goal,
it was the end of the game, but Daly

Undefeated
team stays
‘on track’

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee track
_ team is undefeated after completing
the first week of its outdoor schedule.

The Generals are 3-0 overall and 2-0

in the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-

ence.

Commenting on the team’s perfor-
mance last week, head track coach
Norris Aldridge said, “‘The team is
doing about as well as I had expected
for this time in the season.’’ He added
that although the March winds make
it more difficult for his athletes to run
their best times, they have turned in

' good performances at both meets.

On Saturday, the Generals opened
their schedule with a home victory
against Davidson. W&L defeated its
NCAA Division I opponent by a score
of 106-37.

Tuesday, the Generals traveled to
Bridgewater for a three-way meet
that also included Eastern Menno-
nite. The meet marked the Generals’
first outdoor competition against
ODAC opponents. W&L won the meet
with 96 points. Bridgewater placed
second with 61 points and Eastern
Mennonite finished last with 19.

Despite the winds on Tuesday,
freshman Andy White set a new
school record for the 110 high
hurdles. His record time of 15.20
broke the previous record held by
captain Chris Ives (15.50). Aldridge
also cited Chris Bleggi, Mark Pem-
hroke and Chris McGowan for out-

“{Goal] number five didn’t give
them any more or any less momen-
tum,” he said. ‘‘At half, we didn’t feel
that goal was any more a nail in the
coffin than any of their other goals.
Weslid at aninopportune time.”

Indeed, the second half brought a
new lacrosse game as the Generals
seemed to be sharper than during the
first half. The third quarter provided
perhaps the Generals’ finest mo-
ments of the 1985 season to this point.
Senior Mark Knobloch scored after
three minutes with the help of senior
Rod Santomassimo to close the gap
to5-2.

With 7:08 left in the third period,
the theme to’’Rocky”’ could be heard
faintly. Junior Caulley Deringer as-
sisted Brown (five goals this season)
through the tight Maryland defense
to make the score 5-3. Eight seconds
later, Richard ‘Taz’’ Schoenberg
won the face-off, passed the ball to
Bill Holmes, who passed to senior
Jeff Mason for the score. With the
scoreboard showing Maryland's lead
at only 5-4, the theme song became
louder.

The people in the stands became
very excited, stamping their feet and
exchanging high fives. Maryland was
in a bad situation — momentum was
with the Generals.

But then Washington and Lee be-
gan taking bad shots, and the fourth
quarter was the property of the Uni-
versity of Maryland. The Terps took
a 7-4 lead with 10:41 left in the game,
and the fat lady started warming up.

{Goals} six and seven hurt us,”
Daly said. ‘‘They took us out of what
we were doing and let [ Maryland ]get
their confidence back.”

The Generals did close the gap to

Breithaupt scored. But the worst mo-
ment of the game was only one min-
ute later when the Terps’ Kevin Hart

 

 

scored to make the game 8-5. It
wasn’t so much the goal, it was the
fact that Hart is a defenseman/mid-
fielder with a long stick that hurt.
Long sticks are not supposed to
score.

“Biggest goal of the game was
their eighth,” Daly said. “Whenever
a long stick scores, it has the effect of
two goals.”’

From there, the Terps went on to
score three more goals to win 11-5.

players and Coach Daly agreed that
Maryland won the game with its
transition attack. When the Terps
beat the Duke Blue Devils 8-6 the
week before, they showed no signs of
a strong transition game. Saturday’s
result may have been due to the fact
that the Terps were just the faster
team, outrunning the Generals over
and over again.

Deringer, who had two assists, was
player of the game.

‘‘T could not take Chip Gist because
of his academic load,’’ said Leslie,
who rotated his golfers for the tour-
ney.

Leslie said he uses the opening
tournaments to help develop a start-
ing lineup and give his men competi-
tive experience on the greens, With

Daly hopes that support will contin-

host the University of Virginia on
Saturday. It will be W&L’s last home

to Leslie, are Wheeler, Gist, fresh-

The Washington and Lee baseball
team opened its 1985 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season in not so
desirable fashion this week, losing to
Eastern Mennonite College and
Bridgewater College to extend its los-
ing streak tofive games.

The Generals, who won their first
two games, are now 2-5 on the season.

W&L traveled to Bridgewater
Tuesday only to find that its pro-
blems at the plate would continue to

_ Plague the team. The Generals were

unable to hit with any consistency in
the 5-0 loss.

Bridgewater scored all the runs it
needed to win in the third inning, us-
ing two hits off W&L starter Kirk
Breen to push one run across the
plate. Bridgewater added three
insurance runs in the sixth and
scored once more in the seventh to
make the final score 5-0.

Breen continued to be the
Generals’ hard luck story for 1985 as
he allowed only six hits and two earn-
ed runs in seven innings before being
relieved by freshman Carter Steuart.

The Bridgewater loss proved to be
especially costly to the Generals as
red-hot centerfielder Hugh Finkels-
tein injured his knee during the first
inning and will be out for at least two
weeks. W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock said Finkelstein may have suf-
fered cartilage damage to his knee.

W&L’s game at Eastern Mennonite
on Monday featured two of the
ODAC’s premier pitchers in the
Generals’ Billy White and the Roy-
als’ Doug Byler. Byler controlled the
Generals throughout, allowing only
four hits while striking ont 14 White,

‘EMC, Bridgewater
‘Steal two from ‘9’

however, gave up a big first inning,
surrendering a three-run homer en
route to spotting EMC an early 40
lead.

EMC continued to pour it on the
Generals in the second, scoring three
more runs to blow the game open.
EMC tallied once more in the sixth,
making the score 8-0, before adding
insult to injury by scoring eight runs
in the seventh and eighth to make the
final score 16-0.

White suffered his first loss of the
season, allowing six earned runs in
54% innings. Dave Howard relieved
White.

W&L dropped a doubleheader at
home to Alderson-Broaddus on Satur-
day by scores of 8-2and5-0.

In the opener, W&L got on board in
the first when Milam Turner walked,
stole second and scored on Bill Cur-
tiss’ two-out double, giving the
Generals anearly 1-0 lead.

A-B tied the game in the third and

went ahead 2-1 in the fourth. The
Generals fell behind 3-1 in the fifth
when Steuart gave up a two-out home
run.
W&L closed the gap to 3-2 in the
sixth when Finkelstein singled, stole
second, went to third on a passed ball
and scored when Curtiss grounded
out.

A-B put the game on ice in the
seventh, however, by scoring five
runs on four hits and a General error.
Only one of the four runs was earned.
W&L was unable to score in the bot-
tom of the seventh, making the final
score 8-2.

In the second game, W&L once
again was unable to get untracked at
the plate, producing only two hits in
losing 5-0.

off W&L starter Bill Schoettelkotte
on two hits and two Generals’ errors.
They added insurance runs in the
fifth and sixthinnings.

Schoettelkotte worked five innings,
allowing only two earned runs on
three hits while striking out six.
Breen pitched two innings in relief,
giving up one unearned run.

Despite his team’s apparent col-
lapse in the last week, Murdock re-
mains optimistic that W&L can com-
pete for the ODAC title in 1985.

“After seeing Bridgewater and
Eastern Mennonite, I’m still convinc-
ed that we can compete with any
team in the conference;’ Murdock
said.

‘We get behind, and people feel
they have to make the big plays to get

us back in the game,” he added.
‘“‘That’s when we screw up.”

“You've got to relax to play the
game of baseball,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘I
think we’ve forgotten it’s a game.”’

Chances are that the Generals will
treat their next opponent, Hampden-
Sydney, as more than just a normal
game. Murdock said the Tigers are
similar to the Generals.

“They've got a lot of kids back
from last year, and they’ve started
the season like we have,” he said.
“There is no team in the conference
that we can just show up and walk
over.”

This afternoon’s game at Hamp-
den-Sydney was scheduled to start at
3p.m.

Netmen go 3-1, 5-2 overall

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

Under clear skies and a blustering
wind, the Washington and Lee tennis
team last week continued to demon-
strate its talent and determination
with sound victories, although it also
encountered some frustrating de-
feats.

Having defeated Indiana Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania 8-1 on Thursday,
Greensboro College 7-2 on Sunday
and Emory and Henry College 8-1 on
Wednesday, the netters lost to Ro-
chester 6-3 on Friday, bringing their
record to5-3.

The team gave an indication of the
extent of its depth against I.U.P. with
victories from non-starters Jim Mor-
gan, Layton Register and David
Nave, who occupied the number 4, 5
and6 positions for the match.

Freshman Chris Wiman was also

successful in his transition from
number 5 singles to number 3 singles,
where he downed his opponent, 6-2,
6-2.

Friday’s loss to Rochester, ranked
five below W&L in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches’ Association poll,
was a big disappointment, team
members said.

Senior captain Andy Haring felt
that although it was an important
match, hope is. not lost. ‘‘We still
havea shot,” he said.

Wiman had similar sentiments. He
pointed out the importance of the
team’s match in Florida against
Rollins College.

Although a loss, Friday’s match
was close, as were the team’s other
three season defeats. In singles, both
Andy Haring and Scott Adams con-
tinued to play well, showing the
team’s overall strength with vic-
tories at the number 4 and 6 posi-
tions.

 

Rivalry

 

C Continued from Page 1

The Cavaliers’ head coach is as
free with praise as Gillin. “‘W&L cer-
tainly has the capability of playing

' good lacrosse and is playing good

lacrosse,’’ Adams said.
The Generals come into Saturday’s

; contest with a two-game losing

ral

silty ili on Si

streak, having been outscored 30-10
in their last two outings. But the team
is not discouraged. Daly and his
troops are working every week ‘‘to
become one week better.’’ And
despite last week’s 11-5 loss to
Maryland, the Generals are pleased
with their overall performance.

“With 60 minutes of good lacrosse,
I think we can beat U.Va.,” San-
tomassimo said.

While Santomassimo and his team-
mates are emphasizing four strong
quarters, 60 minutes of good lacrosse
seems to have been the Achilles’ heel
for the Cavaliers. In their opener
against Brown, U.Va built a 6-0
halftime lead only to escape with an
8-6 victory.

It was the same story the following
week against the University of
Maryland-Baltimore County. The
Cavs went up 9-0 on the Retrievers
but had that lead diminished to 17-12
by the end of the game. Yesterday,
the Cavs collected their third win
without a loss, a 120 victory over
Roanoke.

The Generals are focusing on the
Cavs’ transition game as a key in
Saturday’s contest. U.Va. has one of
the better transition games of the
teams W&L will face this season.

But there is talk that this year’s
Cavaliers are not as strong as

previous editions. Despite their 12
returning lettermen, the team is
quite young. Witness these words,
which open the 1985 U.Va. lacrosse
press guide: ‘‘This season’s lacrosse
team is so young that Jim Adams
...almost has to have introduction
sessions at each practice.’’ Fourteen
U.Va. players are new to Charlot-
tesville.

But this game obviously goes
beyond the numbers. ‘‘We’ve had a
long and good relationship with
Washington and Lee, and we want to
keep playing,’ Adams said.

Gillin concurs with his mentor.
“It’s definitely a rivalry. I’m looking
forward to the game. I know it will be
a good game, and I’m just hoping
we'll come out on the upper end.”

For W&L, the rivalry goes beyond
any pep talk. ‘It would be an upset,
but I don’t need to say a lot to the
kids,’’ Daly said.

That unspoken intensity is re-
flected in the words of his seniors,
who have yet to beat a U.Va. team
during their W&L careers.

“It’s not just an ordinary game.
It’s an emotional game with a cross-
state tradition and rivalry. It’s the
big boys of U.Va. versus the little
boys of Washington and Lee,” senior
attackman Mark Knobloch said.

Apart from the rivalry, the seniors
have the better interests of the W&L
iacrosse program as a whole on their
minds. ‘‘It is a very important game
as far as rebuilding our respectabili-
ty as a Division I lacrosse team,”’
Knobloch said.

In recent years, W&L has come up
short in the big games. Santomas-
simo perhaps best puts Saturday’s
meeting in perspective for the W&L
seniors, and maybe the whole team.

“It’s our last chance. Period.”

The matches that could have made
the difference were those of number 3
man Roby Mize and number 5 man
Wiman. Mize controlled his opponent
in the first set, winning 6-2. After los-
ing the second set 6-4, Mize tried to
re-assert his dominance, but his op-
ponent, Eric Lipton, was also playing
well, keeping his lead in the third set
towin the match.

Wiman also had a close match, los-
ing the tie-breaker on the second set
to drop the match 7-5, 7-6.

W&L’s victory over Greensboro al-
so had its share of close confronta-
tions. Perhaps the most exciting
match was David McLeod’s victory
over Bryan Humphreys. After split-
ting their first two sets, McLeod was
able to show determination in classic
form, winning the tie-breaker of the
third set, 7-5.

Mize and Haring also showed de-
termination, both winning their mat-
ches in three sets. Jack Messerly at

the number one position continued to
go winless, while Scott Adams’ unde-
feated streak was kept alive.

Going into the Emory and Henry
match, the team was somewhat al-
tered, having Messerly at number 3
with McLeod at number 1 and Mize at
number 2. The change came after a
request by the frustrated Messerly.

It was a move that got immediate
results — Messerly got his first win of
the season against Emory and Hen-

ry. Asked how he felt, Messerly sum"

med it up with one word: ‘‘relieved.”’

The match went well for everyone
except in number 3 doubles, in which
Mize, who sprained his ankle toward
the end of the match, and Adams lost,
7-5, 6-0, 7-5.

The team will play George Mason
tomorrow. Approaching are such
teams as Lynchburg College and
Hampden-Sydney, which coach Gary
Franke said will be important for the
team’s ODAC ranking.

Croquet: ‘party sport’

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

When the word ‘‘croquet” is men-
tioned, one probably thinks of the
game that is played in the backyard
ona hot summer’s afternoon.

But according to senior John Za-
briskie, who, with Brook Loening, re-
cently won the National Collegiate
Croquet Championships, the game
they play is ‘nothing like your
backyard croquet.”

Zabriskie and Loening, an ex-
change student from Connecticut
College, competed in West Palm
Beach, Fla., March 1, 2 and 3, taking
trophies for the best collegiate team,
best doubles team and the two best
singles players. They competed with
teams from schools such as Navy,
Brown, Princeton and St. John’s.

Zabriskie explains that competi-
tive croquet, ‘‘the fastest growing
sport in the country,”’ has many dif-
ferent characteristics from the com-
monly played backyard sport.

Competitive croquet was brought
from England to the United States in
1977. Played on a large open court of
grass very similar to a putting green’
competitive croquet has a long list of
complicated rules, and the mental
condition during the tournaments, as
Zabriskie said, ‘‘gets really tense.”
He describes the game as a combina-
tion of ‘‘billiards, putting and chess.”’

This month’s tournament was a
‘‘good time,”’ according to Zabriskie.
He described the game as ‘‘a great
party sport,”’ saying that two main
activities are playing and drinking
gin.

“The girls from Trinity, who tra-
veled with the Trinity team, were
great,’’ he said, and ‘‘the Navy guys
were cool.”’

On the serious side, Zabriskie re-
called that although the competition
was intense, he and Loening ‘‘went
down there to kill.”’

They seem to have accomplished
this, taking first place titles in nearly
all the events. Asked what made the
W&L team dominate, Zabriskie ex-
plained that they won because of
their superior strategy, tournament
experience and knowledge of the
complicated rules.

Competitive croquet has a rather
elite reputation as being a sport for
only the rich. Zabriskie said this
reputation has persisted because
most of the croquet courts can only
be built and maintained at the most
expensive polo and coutnry clubs. ‘‘I
want people to keep an open mind,”
he said.

As for the future, the two-man
team will ‘‘lie low’’ and practice until
they are ready to compete nationally.

The number of people playing cro-
quet is growing every day and Za-
briskie encourages everyone to try
the game.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 21, 1985, Page 7

George & Bob U.

athletes are
students first

....[t was with a little bit of trepida-
tion that I perused last week’s Phi
sports section (all right, more than
the usual amount of trepidation),
especially the ‘A day in the life
of...’ swimming story. The idea of
such an inordinate amount of time
spent by the swimmers in Page
. Remillard’s quality program was, at
first glanee, well, uh, inordinate. We’re dealing with your basic 17-
hour-a-day commitment, here.

I’m sure the gripe from some unmentionables is, ‘‘Hey, that’s too
much time spent for a program that isn’t big-time. Division III means
no scholarships, so why so much time and effort for something that
leads to no professional career? Here, it’s supposed to be ‘Academics
first, athletics second,’ but the swimming program makes it look like
it’s the other way around.”

Frankly, that’s a half-cocked response. The athletic program and
athletic philosophy here at W&L is something of which everyone
should be most proud. There are quality athletic programs at W&L,
and ‘quality’ goes beyond won-lost records and champions produced.

What makes the W&L program — and I’m sure many others like it in
Division III — so worthy of admiration is its foundation in the idea that
nobody is going to make a career out of throwing a ball through a hoop,
into a net or to another magna cum prima donna. Prima donnas need
not apply. Good students are going to get in to Washington and Lee and
will succeed at whatever they wish to do. In the best of all possible
Washington and Lees, applicants would not get in solely because they
were good athletes, and I’d venture to say that’s predominantly the
case.

The point is that athletes at George & Bob’s Colonnade of Fun are
students first. And because they are students first, it is their decision
how much time they devote to extracurricular activities. That goes for
the swimmer and, believe it or not, the Ring-tum Phi reporter. The 17-
hour days are not limited to the W&L athletes, yet the types that would
be quick to point the accusing finger at athletics’ occupying too much
of a student’s day would remain oblivious to the other extracurricular
ventures that might occupy a student’s time.

The dedication of the W&L athlete is something that pays off after
any cheers they might have received have died down. W&L is not in
the business of producing successful athletes. It is in the business of
producing successful people, and the athletic program is one of the
building blocks toward becoming a successful person.

The athletic commitment is a matter of choice. Those early morning
swim sessions were optional. It is something chosen because that is
what the student-athlete wants to do. It is that endless pursuit of
perfection, that striving to be the best you can be, reflected in the at-
titude of this year’s lacrosse team. It’s a quality to be commended,
because, frankly, it breeds quality...

....Again, we make the trip down the Colonnade, and here's a quick
guess that four good quarters would have left Maryland wondering
what hit them....They should make the track and field slogan this
year, “Take no prisoners.” (See Davidson, 106-37, 15 of 17 first
places)...

....On to Real World 101: First pupil this week has to be Doug Flutie,
formerly of the incredible pass fame, now of the incredible sack and
interception(s) fame. But then what are USFL saviors for? The league
is impressive in one statistic. In failed saviors, they are three for three
(see Walker, Rozier, Flutie)...It would be a shame if Larry Holmes
left boxing after such an unexciting finish. (Who or what is David
Bey?) Something tells me, though, he’s not finished...Take a gander, if
ESPN gives you a chance, at those NCAA hockey championships. A
mite more exciting than your usual ESPN fare....

....5some quick NCAA tourney notes: La. Tech and Loyola are still
there. G-town’s had it too easy, and Loyola doesn’t practice layups in
pre-game warm-up. Says Ramblers’ (I believe this is their nickname)
coach Gene Sullivan, ‘With the Patrick Ewings and the Jon Koncaks
in there, you don’t get a lot of layups these days.”’ Practical. You have
to like that...Here’s a nasty guess that tapes of Dick Vitale and Bob
Ley for umpteen hours on ESPN over the weekend will be shown to
prisoners of war in the future.....

....Finally, from the Excellence in Sports Journalism (A contradic-
tion in terms?) Dept.: Headline in The Washington Post on Sunday,
“Maryland defeats William and Mary, 11-5." But gee boss, the
headline fits.....

Jason and the Scorchers will play in the student activities pavilion tomorrow night.

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

Don’t miss Jason and the Scorch-
ers tomorrow night at the student ac-
tivities pavilion — they are simply
one of the hottest bands in rock and
roll today. They are touring in sup-
port of their first full LP, ‘‘Lost and
Found”’ the followup to their 1984 EP,
“Fervor.”

Led by Jason Ringenberg, this
Nashville band has a sound that the
College Media Journal’s New Music
report has called ‘rock-country,”’
largely because of the out-front gui-
tar work of Warner Hodges, Perry
Baggs on drums and Jeff Johnson on
bass complete the quartet. Their new
album has zoomed to the top of the
progressive radio charts, and the
press has had nothing but raves.

They have a video of the album’s |
single, ‘‘White Lies,’’ that CMJ faults
for not effectively transmitting the
band’s “‘full throttle live aura.” It
recommends seeing the live show,
which will turn an ordinary rock and
roller into a Scorcher convert.

Songs to listen for both at the show
and on WLUR-FM: ‘White Lies’’; »
‘Last Time Around,” their version of _
Dylan’s ‘‘Absolutely Sweet Marie’;
and my favorite, ‘‘Harvest Moon.”’ »
Tickets are $3 each at the bookstore ,
or at the door. Show time is 9 p.m.
with Shor Patrol kicking off the even- *
ing. Once again, kudos to the SAB for
giving us some of the most vital rock
and roll acts today. Keep it up! :

Number of flicks to pick increasing

 

By PETER BOATNER

The past few months at
Washington and Lee have seen a ra-
pid growth in the number of film
series being held around campus. In
addition to the more established film
festivals sponsored by the politics
and journalism departments and the
W&L Film Society, film series aimed
at specific groups such as foreign
language, history and even science
students have begun to emerge.

Several factors account for that
growth. The main one, according to

reference librarian Richard F.
Grefe, has been the growing impor-
tance of the University Library’s
audio-video department. ‘‘We have
an active A-V department’ with

‘more centralized information than is

available to the individual depart-
ments of the University, he said.

The library has increased its video-
tape collection over the last year to
such an extent that officials say there
aren’t enough video machines to
meet the demand.

The library, however, only pur-
chases tapes that will be used many
times over, such as the plays of
Shakespeare or science series like
‘Nova’ and ‘“‘The Ascent of Man.”
Specialized films are much cheaper
to rent, the library staff says, and the
A-V department performs that ser-
vice for most of the film festivals on
campus.

“We are trying to encourage use of
the A-V center,”’ said Grefe.

Money, he explained, can be saved
by such centralization through vol-
ume discounts and by searching for
the cheapest rental outlet. Most of

PUT US TO THE TEST:

the film rentals are paid for through
the A-V department.

Craig W. McCaughrin, a politics
professor who has been sponsoring
films here since 1982, said one of the
big factors in the growth of film on
campus has been cooperation among
the groups showing movies.

For instance, by showing a Russian
language film with political over-
tones such as ‘‘October,’’ attendance
increases and money is saved.

Similarly, the film series highlight-
ing the of the Japanese director can
show a movie he made in Russia,
once again increasing audiences and
cutting costs.

Communication also has kept the
schedules of each festival from con-
flicting, MeCaughrin reports. The
Washington and Lee Film Society,
which tries to concentrate on highly
acclaimed contemporary films that
aren’t likely to come to Lexington’s
theaters, has been operating on cam-
pus for about eight years.

It receives about a third of its
financial assistance from the Execu-

IFC approves Rush calendar;

plan now faces UC, SAC votes

 

From Staff Reports

 

The proposed fraternity Rush

_ calendar for next fall delays Rush un-

til after freshman orientation and
prohibits Wednesday night parties
during the 18-day formal Rush
period.

The proposal, approved unani-
mously by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil on Tuesday, was scheduled to be
reviewed this afternoon by the Uni-
versity Council and the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

“We've worked out what we
thought were the main problems with
last year’s calendar,” incoming IFC
President Jaimie Hayne said. ‘‘It’s a
little less restrictive and everything
is more spread out.”’

Additional highlights of the IFC's
plan:

eWashington and Lee women
would be permitted at all Rush func-
tions except Open Houses, but wo-
men from other schools would not be
allowed to attend formal Rush fune-
tions.

eTwo bands costing a total of $2,700
would be permitted.

eFreshmen would have two nights

Police officer
files appeal
of conviction

SRD ercnetareemeeacetotindiat-amrsetonbiiaancetsces
By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

A Lexington police officer who was
convicted Friday in a closed hearing
of the assault and battery of a 17-
year-old has appealed his conviction.

Sgt. Richard S. Rice, 44, a member
of the Lexington police force for 212
years, was sentenced to two months
in jail by Judge Robert T. Culpepper
of the Lexington Juvenile and Do-
mestic Relations Court. Ten months
of the one-year sentence were sus-
pended.

Rice was released on his own
recognizance, according to General
District Clerk Juanita Rice.

Rice, reached Monday at his Rock-
bridge County home, said he had ap-
pealed the ruling but declined further
comment.

A Lexington General District Court
official confirmed the appeal was fil-
ed Friday. The new trial will be
heard in Rockbridge County Circuit
Court.

Police Chief L.O. Sutton said he
suspended Rice without pay immed-
iately after hearing of the incident in
early January. He added he would
make a decision this week concern-
ing Rice’s future with the police de-
partment.

Rice was charged Jan. 8 in the Jan
1 incident.

According to Commonwealth's At-

torney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read, the
juvenile was convicted of assault ona
policeman stemming from the New
Year’s Eve incident.

Read said he disqualified himself
from prosecuting Rice because he
had prosecuted the juvenile and Rice
had been a witness in that case. Au-
gusta County Commonwealth’s At
torney Lee Ervin was special pro-
secutor

Open Houses.

The SAC, a student-faculty com-
mittee that has ‘‘complete authority”
over University social life, must ap-
prove the entire calendar, and the
UC, an advisory student-faculty com-
mittee, must approve the pledging
date, according to Hayne.

He said that although ‘‘it’s usually
just a formality,” this year there
may be a few aiterations. “There'll
probably be a few things that are
changed, but it'll probably be basic-
ally the same,"’ Hayne said

He said the ban on Wednesday
night parties should go ‘‘really far”
in helping the entire proposal receive
SAC approval

“That's something we felt we
would make as a concession,’’ Hayne
said, ‘‘We’re using that as a bargain-
ing point, and all the fraternities
were willing togiveitup.”’

He added that the advantages of
the restriction are that it ‘‘will cut
down on noise in the community,”
and will satisfy those who feel Wed-
nesday night parties have negative
effects on students.

The proposed formal Rush period
is four days longer than last year’s

This fall, contact began on Sept. 3
and preference cards were due Sept.
17, next fall, contact begins Sept. 13
and preference cards are due Sept.

The IFC’s plan also calls for two
weeks of Rush during classes rather
than this year’s one, since contact
begins after orientation rather than
classes on the second day, as it did
this fall

Hayne said the slightly delayed
start should be helpful to new stu-
dents. ‘‘One of the biggest problems
people talked about last year was
that freshmen went blind into the
open houses,” he said. ‘This gives
them some kind of idea what houses
they want tosee first.”’

He noted an additional benefit to
delaying Rusn a few days. ‘‘When
Rush starts right off the bat, the
freshmen get involved with that and
think they should be partying instead
of studying,”’ he said.

The eight Open Houses last one
hour each and the 10 Rush Dates are
scheduled for 1!» hours each.

Cold Check writes
bad check for $73

 

By PAULFOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Student Financial Relations
Committee, which reimburses local
merchants when Washington and Lee
students bounce checks, two weeks
ago made the same mistake for
which it fines students — it bounced a
check.

The check was for $73.58 to The
Palms restaurant and was dated
March 7. Junior Henry Exall, chair-
man of the cold check committee, as
itis better known, said the check was
one of six written to reimburse mer-
chants in a week in which the com-
mittee thought it had $800, when in
fact ithad only $300.

Exall claimed full responsibility
for the error. He said that if the
bounced check were brought before
the committee, he would probably
not be fined because he wrote the
check ‘‘in good faith,’’ thinking there
was enough money tocover it.

The Executive Committee ques-
tioned Exall Monday night. Junior
representative Pat Hayden said the
bounced check was ‘‘quite an embar-
rassment.”’

“It just destroys their credibility,
in my mind,” Hayden said after the
meeting. Hayden asked rhetorically
how the committee can berate and

fine students who chee!
when it does the same thing itselt

‘** ‘How can he who has no sin cast
the first stone?’ if you want to quot
the Bible,’ Hayden continued

He added that the bounced check
reflects poorly on the committee and
indirectly, the EC, because the E‘
appoints the cold check committee
chairman

After the EC meeting Exail ex
plained that on March 7, treasure!
Jim Murphy failed to bring
year’s checkbook to the committee's
weekly meeting. When
checks for the six other committee
members to take to the merchant:
who were asking for reimbursement
that week, Exall wrote them on last
year’s checkbook, thinking it was
this year’s. That checkbook showed a
balance of $800, when the commit
tee’s real balance was $295.80

“If we had ever assumed the
balance was as low as it was, we
never would have written the
checks,”’ Exall told the EC

He said he should have been able to
tell it was the wrong checkbook. so it
was his fault.

Horse Center ‘race’ ends

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Throughout the yearlong fight
to bring the Virginia Horse Center
to Rockbridge County, the puns
were endless as observers tracked
the progress:

Rockbridge County broke out of
the gate in its bid to attract the
Virginia Horse Center....

Rockbridge County's bid to at-
tract the
cleared another hurdle....

Rockbridge County galloped
toward the finish line in its bid....

If the battle over the location of
the horse center could be com-
pared to a race, Friday repre
sented the awarding of the first-
place check and the placing of the
wreath of roses around the winn-
ing horse’s neck

While nearly 4,000 people looked
on at Virginia Military Institute’s
Cameron Hall, Gov. Charles S.
Robb on Friday signed the bill
creating the horse center on 361
acres of land near the intersection
of Interstates 64 and 81

‘In a few years, when people
talk about horses and they talk
about Lexington, they’re going to
be talking about Lexington, Vir
ginia, and not that other Lex
ington’ in Kentucky, Robb said at
what was billed as the state’s
largest bill-signing ceremony

Robb praised the cooperation
among the governing bodies of the
county and its cities as a crucial
factor in bringing the horse center
to Rockbridge. Rockbridge was
selected over areas such as Roa
noke and Staunton

A court date for the misdemeanor

Because it is ‘of an evidentiary

charges. ‘‘Bascially all of it was ver

Sutton said Joines came to the Delt
house about 2 a.m. because the stu

“In my entire service as gover

“Otis and his

OPINION

 

Consider this

The bulk of next year’s Executive Committee has been
elected. The Big Three elections are in the past, and banners
from this week’s six undergraduate positions up for election
are beginning to disappear. But while the adrenaline is still
flowing and thoughts are still on the duties of the student
governing body, there are a few things we believe ought to be
emphasized.

Next year’s EC obviously will play a crucial role in the
history of the University. Besides helping to ease the transi-
tion to coeducation, next year’s EC will face other
challenges.

First and most importantly, we hope the Executive
Committee next year will undertake an extensive study of the
Honor System. A re-evaluation of the single-sanction rule is
mandated in light of rumblings from faculty members that it
is impractical. Perhaps an extensive study of student opinion
about the Honor System is also in order. Does the seeming
lull in criticism of the Honor System mean students approve?
Does silence equal consent? Since change is in the air for
next year, might this be another area in which change is
needed?

Secondly, we hope they again address the problem of alco-
hol abuse, especially in light of the recent tragedy involving
SAE. Will the student body be able to create an environment
under the new 21-year-old drinking age that promotes the
concept of honor and gentlemanly conduct while allowing
students to continue to enjoy an active social life?

Third, as was evident at Monday night’s EC meeting, re-
form of the current methods of allocating money to student
organizations should be considered. We seriously question
whether every student group coming before the EC is deserv-
ing of money. Qualms, come March, over whether there is
enough money in the EC reserve fund should not matter if
sound budgeting has been pursued.

Next year’s EC will offer a lot to the University in firsts.
We hope they take up the challenge of past committees and
pursue excellence in representation. Stripping away the pop-
ular misconception that EC members merely seek resume
fodder will be a challenge we hope they’!l confront with vigor.

A big waste

It was one of those envelopes that has a computer label on
it, and the mimeographed letter inside began with the com-
mon form letter salutation, “To All Students.’’ The careful
reader finds out that the Student Control Committee chair-
man, B. Darby Brower, is writing underclassmen to inform
them of the role class officers play in the SCC. The letter
seems timely, considering the elections this week for the
various Class officer positions.

Brower continues in the most eloquent of prose to delineate
the ‘‘exact responsibilities” of the group, which “has been
delegated by the faculty the power to try students who may
have committed a non-honor related offense.”’ His well-writ-
ten letter continues for the full page and ends with the friend-
ly admonition that B. Darby Brower would ‘appreciate your
consideration of this information when voting on your
classmates for class officers.”

The only problem is that Brower, whether out of ignorance
or intent, had written the letter on Student Control Commit-
tee letterhead, which lists two of the current members who
also were up for election as underclassmen. Such advertise-
ment gives the two candidates an unfair advantage in their
campaigns and lends an air of authority and authenticity to
their candidacies that is not available to other candidates.
Mistake number one.

_ Mistake number two involves the misuse of University dol-
lars to mail the letter. With 1,014 undergraduates on the mail-
ing list (seniors obviously were not voting), at 22 cents a let-
ter, the total comes to more than $225 including printing
costs! Surely, ina time of cutting budgets with the vengeance
of recent days, better use for the money could have been
found, Other means, including this paper’s letters column
and posters around campus, could have achieved the same
end. Judging from the stack of unopened letters in the post of-
fice trash can, mailing the notices did not seem to be the best
solution. In using a different medium, B. Darby Brower also
could have avoided the conflict of interest that resulted.

Woman pities The Phi

 

To the Editors:

When I first read the article ‘“‘The
Bid’’ in the Feb. 28 issue of The Ring-
tum Phi I was furious, then after
thinking about it I felt pity. My first
pity was for the Washington and Lee
students who ultimately did get used
— and abused — for just a date to
Fancy Dress. My second pity was for
The Phi.

This college newspaper, which has
come so far in its layout and size, just
took two giant steps backwards in its
quality. Any first-year journalism
student knows that a reporter must
report the facts and report them in an
unopinionated manner. There are no
facts in this lead: ‘‘It was no coinci-
dence that Mary Baldwin College
threw an expensive party with Liquid
Pleasure Tuesday night. The party’s
purpose? The Bid.”’

Did anyone from The Phi research

The Phi last week contained a
passage stating that student body
Vice President-elect Andrew Car-
uthers said ‘‘some of the problems
this year stemmed from the way
the EC was run.’’ The sentence
should have made clear that
‘‘problems’’ was a reference to
problems perceived by others and

 

this opinion? Did anyone contact the
planners of the party, MBC’s Social
Committee, to check the validity of
this statement?

Obviously not, and after talking to
the chairwoman of the Social Com-
mittee at Mary Baldwin, I found that
The Phi lied. THAT isa fact.

I ceriainly hope that the writers for
The Ring-tum Phi do not go on to
write for reputable newspapers in the
future. It could be very damaging to
the paper, to themselves and to the
parties they defame.

Maybe some of the writers of The
Ring-tum Phi would learn a little
about journalism if they took a News-
writing I class at Mary Baldwin Col-
lege.

U.S. security challenged from abroad

MY
VIEW

By Jon
Zagrodzky

 

You will recall that in my last arti-
cle, I defined what I perceived to be
the four basic foreign threats faced
by the United States. These are the
Soviet threat and the threats posed
by other nations, including conven-
tional and economic warfare as well
as terrorism. Before expounding on
the last three categories, however, I
should like to address the concerns
some readers expressed about my
last column.

The comment that I heard most
was that I was representing an isola-
tionist point of view. Some claimed
the same foolish thinking that tried to
keep us ‘out of European conflicts in
the periods before the two World
Wars. This would be true if it were
1940 and not 1985. We must remem-
ber the key factors that have chang-
ed in the last 45 years to answer this
question.

First, the amount of time we have
to mobilize troops to meet a Soviet
conventional strike has gone from
about a year to about a day. The
speed at which a war would progress
these days is so fast that we must
maintain in Europe at all times all
the forces we would need in a conven-
tional war. To provide this, a sub-
stantial sacrifice by the American
people, one much larger than the one
we are now making, is necessary.
The gist of my first article is that the
total sacrifice needed to defend
Europe falls unfairly on U.S. should-
ers. We can and should maintain a
nuclear deterrent, but the burden of
conventional defense should shift to
the Europeans.

A second factor that influences our
position is the outcome of the Viet-

 

nam War. This conflict brought to
light two dilemmas, the first being
that logistics in a modern overseas
war are insurmountable and second,
that U.S. public willingness to
sacrifice American lives in protract-
ed conventional conflicts is limited.

The last key factor is the big
changes in relative U.S. military and
economic strength since World War
II. We no longer possess the tremen-
dous economic strength needed to
provide for Europe’s complete de-
fense; indeed, the economic strength
needed for our own defense is
diminishing. Second, the relatively
weak posture of the Soviet Bloc in the
late ’40s made European defense an
easy burden to bear. Today, though,
we face an enormously more power-
ful adversary and must deal with it
from a relatively weaker economic
position. Clearly, a transfer of the
conventional defense burden to
Europe will improve European
defense in the long run (both strateg-
ically and logistically) and relieve
the U.S. of a conventional commit-
ment it cannot possibly meet. Isola-
tionism is avoided, since we will con-
tinue to provide a nuclear defense as
well as some degree of material
assistance.

Now it seems as if I have shown
that the U.S. should not maintain con-
ventional forces. On the contrary, the
other threats to our nation have not
yet been addressed. First, apart
from the Soviet Union, we must al-
ways remember that other countries
can adversely affect our security.
These nations do not pose a direct
threat to our borders but, rather,
seek to subvert our neighbors and use
them as bases to launch revolutions
hostile to the U.S. Obviously, a strong
conventional force composed of Ma-
rines, a flexible Navy with the capac-
ity to project power into troubled
areas and a superior Air Force are
all needed to halt these kinds of
developments as well as to threaten
those who wish to perpetrate such
subversion. These same conventional

Note wastes student dollars

Tothe Editors:

I returned from a weekend away
from Lexington, to find letters ad-
dressed to me and five other people I
live with in the mailbox. The letter I
am speaking of is the sincere letter
from B. Darby Brower, Senior Class
President, Chairman S.C.C. I won-
dered if my student tax dollars paid
for this mailing. Even if they did not,
somebody wasted his money. The
contents of the letter seemed superfi-
cial. Does Mr. Brower feel that the
student body is ignorant of the SCC’s
responsibilities? Did he feel that it
was worth the expense to write us all
a letter asking us to vote carefully? I
believe that if Mr. Brower posted 25
copies of his letter at various places
around campus, he would have had
the same influence. (My five other
roommates did not even bother to
open their letters.) I feel Mr. B. Dar-
by and the other SCC members who
approved the letter went too far out
of their way with our money to in-

form us of a matter which could have

been handled more easily and effi-

ciently. Let’s hope we did vote

carefully. Let’s hope we kept people
of this nature out of office.

No one at this University believes in

But you cannot go off and leave your

caught students forging checks and

there is a big weekend or break.

be treated like grown-ups, but you go
off to a party and leave your room
open as if to say, ‘‘The hell wi

forces would be useless in an esca-
lating conflict with the USSR and
should be designed for and used in
conflicts with lesser nations.

The third area of conflict is in
economics. The U.S. is threatened
economically by OPEC, potential
Third World debt default and in-
creasing foreign trade competition.
While not all of these threats are in-
tentional, they must be met nonethe-
less. The best policy is to maintain a
flexible economy, prevent trade wars
and avoid policies that might desta-
bbilize our economic position. These
bad policies include haphazard len-
ding by the banking community,
domestic energy pricing schemes
that maintain consumption and shore
up OPEC revenues and labor agree-

cost increases without commen-
surate increases in productivity.

To the Editors:

The current discussion regarding
the proposed abolishment of ‘“‘nice-
ties’? — the 24-hour-open library,
closing the classrooms at night and
the annual Catalogue — is an inter-
esting one. I have two points to make
— one to the administration and one
to the student body.

First, Washington and Lee is pri-
marily a great academic institution
and the pursuit of knowledge on a
liberal arts level should not be limit-
ed by constraints of time. Closing the
library at a certain time would lead
to increased pressure on the
students, and would also create the
problem of undergrads flocking to
the Law School, which will probably
remain open 24 hours a day. Rather
than increasing the sense of com-
munity between the two schools, such
a policy may lead toan ‘‘us vs. them”
attitude that existed 10 years ago
when the library was locked and we

  

and deadly. We have been fortunate
in that terrorist attacks are rare in
the U.S., even though our society is so
open that any terrorist could easily
get away with destroying vast
amounts of property. As evidence of
this, take a look at the lax security
provisions typical of any of the south-
east Texas oil refineries. Evidently,
our preventive measures in this area
are adequate, and we can only hope
that our luck holds out and that har-
sher measures by the FBI and other
internal security forces will not be
necessary.

The United States, in my opinion,
faces great challenges to its security
from abroad. I am convinced that it
has the resources and flexibility to
meet them more effectively than it
does currently. If U.S. policy makers
could separate the foreign threats in-
to the four categories I have outlined
and attack them individually, their
foreign policy would be less compli-
cated, less costly and substantially
more effective.

flocked into Tucker Hall to finish the
“all-night’’ term paper.

Second, although open libraries
and classrooms are “necessities to
W&L’s atmosphere’ and ‘‘founda-
tions to the W&L experience,” they
are not rights, but rather privileges
that have to be earned by each suc-
ceeding student generation. Appar-
ently, the school must tighten its belt
a little to continue to provide services
to the students, and the students can
help in this effort by conserving
energy, turning off lights when
rooms aren’t used and using the
stairs instead of the elevator. If
students show a willingness and the
ability to cut back on wasteful prac-
tices, the administration’s argument
will prove quite weak over a short
period of time.

-IFC president wants
frats to be more active

=

*-

«,

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

The new president of the Inter-
fraternity Council says he plans to
heighten the IFC’s profile, attempt to
involve fraternities in more commu-
nity activities and increase fraterni-
ty awareness of University issues
and IFC regulations,

Junior Jaimie Hayne, who was
elected president two weeks ago, also
recently was chosen president of the
Washington and Lee chapter of Kap-
pa Alpha. Hayne, a history major
from San Antonio, Texas, is the out-
going secretary of the IFC and has
served on the Student Recruitment
Committee.

Not only does increased fraternity
involvement in community activities
benefit the community, Hayne said,
but it is helpful to the IFC and the
fraternities as well.

It can “get us a better name
around town and also around cam-
pus,”’ he said, adding that the pri-
mary exposure the fraternities have
in town comes on Wednesday nights
and weekends when many houses
throw parties. Performing more ser-
vices for the community and con-
tributing to charities can help to
dispel this image, Hayne said.

Another project Hayne wants the
IFC to more involve itself in next
year is the scholarship help it offers
foreign exchange students. The IFC
pays the room and board for four
years for certain exchange students.
“This year we only gave out one,”’ he
said. ‘Hopefully, next year we'll
have two.”’

Helping with the transition to coed-
ucation is another area in which
Hayne believes the IFC can be help-
ful. Although the fraternities are
strictly for male students, Hayne
said the IFC wants to do ‘‘everything
we can to assimilate girls into the
social life’ next fall. As part of this
assimilation, Hayne said he hopes to
hold a meeting during orientation
week for the incoming female fresh-
men to explain to them the status of
sorority interest in W&L and to let
them know what it takes to start a
sorority chapter.

The IFC is cooperating with the Co-
education Steering Committee on
this issue, but Hayne sees a problem
in another area the two groups have
discussed — Rush. The steering com-
mittee is worried, Hayne said, that
the present Rush schedule might
split the freshman class. With frater-
nity Rush coming at the start of fall

term, Hayne said the committee -.

feels Rush will cause the freshman
class to polarize — the men will be
too concerned with Rush to associate
and become acquainted with the wo-

men in the class. Hayne calls this
idea ‘‘ridiculous.”’

A deferred Rush is one of the issues
that may come before the IFC in the
near future. ‘‘There are some vocal
factions on campus that want to
change Rush to second semester,”’
Hayne said. These groups are outside
of the fraternity system, he contin-
ued, and he thinks fraternities would
prefer to have Rush remain sched-
uled as itis.

Hayne concedes there are pro-
blems with the way Rush is set up
now. Many of the freshmen, he said,
went into the process ‘“‘totally blind’
last fall. Some were not able, in the
short time that Rush was conducted,
to make an intelligent decision
among fraternities.

The IFC has several proposals to
combat this ignorance among incom-
ing freshman, Hayne said, including
imposing the ‘‘no contact”’ rule dur-
ing orientation week and beginning
Rush on the first day of classes. (See
related story, Page 1.)

Next fall’s Rush will be a very im-
portant one, Hayne said, because
with the shrinking number of males
in the freshman class, maintaining
the current size of some of the frater-
nities may be difficult.

Hayne said that next year he will
try to encourage more fraternity
presidents to attend IFC meetings.
With the importance of issues such as
Rush, he would like to see more peo-
ple involved and offering their ideas.

Hayne alsosaid that he plans torun
the IFC more ‘‘by the book”’ than it
was run this year. There were in-
stances this year, he said, in which
certain rules were overlooked by the
IFC. Fraternities need tc realize that
there are rules, Hayne added, ‘‘and
that there’s a purpose for those
rules.”’

One rule that he said he saw broken
last year was the ‘“‘no contact’’ rule
during Rush. That rule is important,
he said, as are others, and he plans to
enforce them next year.

Among its duties next year, the
IFC will be reviewing the recommen-
dations of the ad hoc committee on
fraternities. The committee’s recom-
mendations were studied this year by
the IFC, Hayne said, and afterward,
the IFC submitted a proposal for im-
provement of the fraternity system.
Included in this proposal were re-
commendations that fraternities be-
come better acquainted with their
faculty advisers, that all rooms in the
fraternity houses be occupied and
that more upperclassmen live in the
houses with the sophomores.

Another issué-raised in the ad hoc
committee’s report was the Wednes-
day night party regulations and the
question of time, manner and place
of weekend parties. This year’s re-

row for the committee, resulting in
an unusually low balance, he added.

Connie Hostetter, the Palms man-
ager who received the committee’s
bounced check, said this week that
because this was the first time it has
happened, she is not worried.

‘‘We thought maybe it’s just some
simple mistake,”’ she said. ‘‘We real-
ly understand, and it’s no problem at
gu

She said that at Exall’s request she
has sent the check back tothe bank,

“If it happens again or it comes
back to me a second time, then we
might get a little worried,’’ she said.

Another problem the EC says Cold
Check has faced this year has been
one of communication between it and
they merchants. Currently, mer-
chants who receive bounced checks
call University Center secretary
Carole Chappell, who leaves the com-
mittee’s messages in its University
Center mailbox.

Exall said that because the com-
mittee meets only once a week and
the committee members wait a few
days before going out to pay mer-
chants, there can be a delay of up to
two weeks from a merchant's first

 

complaint to the time he is paid.

This can result in merchants’ call-
ing Chappell two and three times
with the same complaint, Exall said,
making those involved believe there
is a breakdownin communications.

“T think Carole’s doing a terrific
job,” Exall said. “Probably the
reason she thinks the messages are
piling up is the merchants keep call-
ing.”’

He said the treasurer will start go-
ing around to the committee’s fre-
quent customers — Lloyd’s, The
Palms and Spanky’s — between
meetings to find out if they have
bounced checks before they call
Chappell.

Sophomore EC representative An-
drew Caruthers suggested that the
committee pick up its messages from
Chappell every other day, rather
than just the day of the meeting.

Hayden suggested that only one
person be allowed to write checks,
because currently both Exall and
Murphy handle the checkbook and
that could result in another bounced
check.

Exall said he will begin to ask mer-
chants to include a ‘‘ballpark figure”’
of the amount of their bounced
checks in messages to Chappell. Cur-
rently Exall writes each week’s
checks without filling in the amount,
increasing the possibility of bounced
checks.

 

 

 

JAIMIE HAYNE
Plans to run IFC “by the book”’

strictions, which prohibited fraterni-
ties from having parties together on
campus on Wednesday nights, drove
many houses to seek party spots out-
side of town. In addition to the var-
ious country houses fraternity mem-
bers live in, Hayne said, a popular
spot for parties was Zollman’s pavi-
lion.

The one-house party rule, Hayne
said, means that more fraternities
are partying alone in their own
houses more frequently. This only
serves to work against the idea that
reducing the number of fraternities
partying together will reduce the
wear and tear on the houses, he said.
This system also tends to split frater-
nities, he added. Wednesday nights
are a time when many friends from
different houses can get together, he
said, and not allowing them to have
parties together does more to sep-
arate houses than tounify them.

With the recent death in an auto-
mobile wreck of a student returning
from a party outside town, Hayne
said he agreed with Dean of Students
Lewis G. John’s statement that it
might be a good idea to re-evaluate
these regulations.

Decisions such as these that affect
student life should not be taken light-
ly, Hayne said. With 65 to 70 percent
of W&L students in fraternities,
Hayne said they are ‘‘a force to be
reckoned with’’ and should not be
excluded from participating in these
decisions.

Total students

Applicants for Honor Scholarships up 300%

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

The students arrived late on a Tuesday afternoon and

then gathered that evening for a welcoming address
from Director of Admissions William M. Hartog III.

 

The number of applicants for Honor Scholarships next
year increased more than threefold to 365, resulting in
some high school class valedictorians not even being
selected as finalists, admissions officials said this week.

The Admissions Office narrowed the applicants for the
12 scholarships — including one specifically for a woman
— to 40 finalists, who visited the campus for interviews

during the past two weeks.

“We're looking for the total student,’’ Admissions
Counselor Bennett L. Ross said. ‘‘The scholarships are

not just academic scholarships.”’

Ross said recipients of the awards must be well-round-
ed, outstanding students and leaders. Extracurricular
activities and personal characteristics, he said, are im-

portant factors.

The University paid all travel expenses to bring the 40
finalists to campus for a series of interviews. Some were

from as far away as California.

“We're attracting a nationwide pool,”’ Ross said. ‘‘Itis
expensive, but it’s money well spent.”’

“These kids will get ineverywhere,’’ he added.

Ross said that based on past experience, admissions
officials expect about half of the finalists to enroll at

WA&L inthe fall.

The University brought the finalists to campus in two
groups of about 20, one last week and the other two

weeks ago.

“Toavoidany problems,”’ 12 female finalists stayed at
the McCampbell Inn on Main Street, according to Ross,
while the 28 men finalists stayed in the freshman dormi-

tories.

After the welcome, finalists were interviewed by one of
three panels of three faculty members.

Wednesday activities included attending three classes
and talking with professors and coaches

Members of the Student Recruitment Committee in-
terviewed finalists that night.

Before leaving the next day, the scholarship finalists
were interviewed by admissions officials.

Honor scholarships the University provides range
from stipends of $1,000 to full-tuition packages.

Some are based on need and region, such as the Keelty
scholarships, which are awarded to students from Balti-
more who demonstrate superior achievement in aca-
demics, extracurricular activities and service to others
but who would be financially unable to attend Washing-
ton and Lee without assistance,

An anonymous donation recently endowed a new full
tuition honor scholarship specifically for a woman.

The recipients of the awards will be determined on the

basis of the interviews by the faculty, students and ad-

missions officials, according to Ross.
“The purpose of the competition is not just a competi-
tion,”’ he said. ‘‘Most [finalists] have a very favorable

experience here on campus.”’

Comparing last year’s 120 applications for the Honor
Scholarships with this year’s 365, Ross said the ‘honing

down”’ process was much more difficult this year.

of last year’s.

He explained that — ‘‘top to bottom’’ — the applica-
tions were stronger this year. But he added that the best
of this group of finalists ‘‘easily’’ compares with the best

Man charged in hit and run

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

A 32-year-old Lexington man was
charged this weekend with hit and
run, driving under the influence of
alcohol and reckless driving in con-
nection with damages to three park-
ed cars, one owned by a Washington
and Lee law student.

Franklin D. Peters was charged
with hitting cars belonging to Rich
Whalen, a first-year law student, and
Wayne H. Nicely, a Lexington resi-
dent. A 1974 Dodge belonging to

Whalen and a 1973 Hornet and a 1973
Chevrolet, both belonging to Nicely,
were hit at about 11:40 p.m. Sunday,
Sutton said.

In other police action last week:

eA first-year law student was
charged Saturday night with destruc-
tion of private property for breaking
a beer stein at The Palms restaurant.
Glen Koontz, 23, ‘‘created a distur-
bance and was thrown out,’’ Sutton
said.

Sutton said that after officers ob-
tained a warrant and arrested
Koontz, the student was taken to the

police station, where he requested a
warrant charging the Palms man-
ager with assault. The magistrate
refused the request, Sutton said.

eBeverly Choonover of Roanoke
reported her purse stolen from her
car while it was parked in front of
Sigma Chi, where she was attending
a party, Sutton said. The purse was
left in the front seat of the car and
contained various credit cards and $8
incurrency.

eA steel barricade with blinking
lights worth $100 was stolen Friday
from the area of 203 Nelson St. Sutton
said there are nosuspects in the case.

Mollenhoff ‘on the record’ on the Gridiron

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Journalism Professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff went to Washington last
weekend to eat, laugh and crack
jokes with other journalists, Su-
preme Court Justices, cabinet mem-
bers, congressmen and the president
of the United States.

And Mollenhoff, who writes for the
Washington Times, probably won't
even get a story out of it.

The occasion was the 100th an-
niversary of the Gridiron Club, a
group of 60 newspaper men and
women based in Washington. By tra-
dition, the members gather every
year for a white-tie dinner to lam-
poon world events and politicians.

In addition to dinner, the evening
includes skits, songs and speeches

designed to poke fun at those speak-
ing as well as at the opposition.

Mollenhoff has attended the func-
tion as a guest since 1952 and has
been a member since 1965. He is now
an associate member because he no

. longer lives inthe Washington area.

Entrance into the club is by nomi-
nation, and even then the nominee
might have to wait two or three years
to get in. Because there can be only
60 active members at a time, to geta
spot in the club, one must wait for a
member either to die or to become an
associate member.

The club has had only 400 members
since its inception in 1885, when it
was created for the enjoyment of all
the Washington bureau chiefs, Mol-
lenhoff said.

Only two rules are followed, ac-
cording to Mollenhoff. The first is
that no tasteless or sexy jokes are

allowed, and members are always

_ warned that ‘“‘women are present.”’

The second rule is that everything is
off the record. Some politicians, how-
ever, leak some of their better one-
liners tothe press.

Among the speakers this year, be-
sides President Reagan, were Geral-
dine Ferraro, representing the De-
mocrats, and Secretary of the Trea-
sury James Baker, representing the
Republicans.

Mollenhoff considers the Gridiron
dinner one of the highlights of the
year (ranking right up there with
Fancy Dress). ‘‘It’s the social occa-
sion of the year in Washington aside
from a White House invitation...and
it may even rank higher than that
with some people,’’ he said.

Members are invited to bring along
guests. One year, Mollenhoff took
columnist Jack Anderson, who had

never gone. Anderson somehow ‘for-
got the occasion was white tie and ap-
peared ina red plaid dinner jacket.

Mollenhoff also related a speech
once given by President Lyndon B.
Johnson at the dinner. As anyone who
has taken a course from Mollenhoff
knows, the Johnson administration,
and especially Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, did not care for
Mollenhoff.

A few days before the Gridiron din-
ner, a rather sharp exchange of
words occurred between Mollenhoff
and McNamara at a press confer-
ence. At the annual dinner, it was
noted that McNamara was not pre-
sent.

Johnson commented on this by say-
ing, ‘‘You’ve noticed Bob [McNa-
mara] isn’t here, he was a victim of a
‘Mollenhoff’ cocktail. So we sent him
to Geneva torecuperate.”’

Council delays action on new zone for dorm

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A zoning change that would allow
construction of a new Washington
and Lee dormitory was tabled Thurs-
day by the Lexington City Council.

The council said it wanted time for
further study of the proposal, which
has been called ‘‘quite suitable’’ by
University officials.

“‘T think we need time to study it,”
Councilman James E. Mays said.
‘‘T’ma little thick-headed. I’m a little
dense,”’ he added, telling the council
he was not clear on all points the ordi-
nance provided.

“I don’t quite understand the im-
pact of it,’’ said councilwoman and
W&L trade book manager Susan La-
Rue, who made the move to table the

ordinance.

W&L’s Frank A. Parsons, execu-
tive assistant to the president and the
school’s representative at the hear-
ing, said he is ‘surprised at how
much the council is in the dark at this
stage.”’

Mayor and W&L economics Profes-
sor Charles F. Phillips Jr. told Mays
that council members received an
original copy of the proposed zone at
least two weeks prior to the hearing.

The new “‘institutional zone’’ would
facilitate development of the W&L
campus, University officials say. The
new dormitory on West Nelson Street
is planned for use in the 1987-88
academic year.

Mays said his role as representa-
tive of Lexington businessmen caus-
ed him to question the adequacy of
the parking space available under

the new plan. He said local mer-
chants are afraid the lack of student
parking resulting from a new dorm
would make it difficult for potential
customers to find adequate parking
in town.

“T don’t work for Washington and
Lee so I can say pretty much what i
feel like,” he said.

Councilman Thomas C. Imeson
said Mays’ comment suggested that
Imeson’s positions as a W&L chemis-
try professor and director of the com-
puter center placed him.ina ‘‘conflict
of interest.’’ He said he would there-
fore abstain from voting on the move
to table the ordinance.

LaRue asked if her job as trade
book manager in the University
Bookstore also placed her in a con-
flict of interest. Phillips said it did
not.

Phillips does not vote with council
unless necessary to break a tie.

The proposed site for the dorm is
now a W&L student parking lot. In

addition, the new dorm will bring 240
students to campus, according to
Parsons.

Parsons told the council that a re-
quirement of the district is to provide
parking spaces for half the number of
students the facility will house plus
an additional number for a percen-
tage of the square footage of the facil-
ity. “‘We thought that was a little
high,”’ he said.

He said the “‘reasonable interests”’
of the city regarding the parking is-
sue should not have caused Council to
table the ordinance. ‘‘These concerns
are to be addressed at a point down
the line,’ he said, referring to the
master plan that would have to be
passed by the Planning Commission
and City Council.

‘‘T think the plan that has been pro-
posed is quite suitable,’’ Parsons
said. He told the council the planned
site for the dormitory would place 240
students within walking distance of
downtown merchants.

Freshman
injured
in wreck

From Staff Reports

 

 

A Washington and Lee freshman
was listed in stable condition in
Roanoke Memorial Hospital this
week after he was injured Sunday in
a two-car wreck on U.S. 11.

The student, Arthur A. Hoffmann,
was driving a friend’s car north
toward Lexington about noon when
the car skidded across the road, hit
an embankment and overturned, ac-
cording to state police trooper Lane
McComas, who investigated the
wreck

The car, a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle,
then slid down the left side of the road
on its top before being hit by a 1981
Toyota driven by Sandrea Strick-
land, 21, of Hopewell, McComas said.

Hoffmann, 18, of Kinnelon, N.J.,
was found partially in and partially
out of the car’s rear window, which
had broken when the car turned over,
according to McComas. Hoffmann
was treated at Roanoke Memorial for

broken bones and lacerations on his

who was thrown out of the car into
the middle of the road, sustained
some lacerations and was admitted

 

Arrests

said,

Cox was arrested, Sutton said, be-
cause ‘‘he was the one that was most
out-front withhis mouth.”’

“He had the guts to shoot off his
mouth, but then he ran inside the
house in an apparent attempt to
escape,’’ he said. ‘‘The officers talk-
ed to the president and found [Cox]
hiding behind the door.”’

Sutton said that following the Cox
arrest, a group of about 30 students
gathered on the corner in front of Chi
Psi. ‘‘They continued to yell loud
obscenities and that type of conduct
and the officer called for assis-
tance,” he said.

Because of the group’s actions,
Joines ‘‘could have arrested
every one of them,’’ Sutton said.

A second city police car and two
Rockbridge County Sheriff’s units ar-
rived, and the four vehicles blocked
the intersection of Lee and Nelson
streets. The knot of students dispers-
ed shortly before 3 a.m.

Delt President Rich Gatti said that
‘from what I saw, the officer’s con-
duct was reasonable.”’

Gatti said Joines had given the
house a warning about noise at 11
p.m., when he said there were about
10 people at the party. He estimated

Rice
~ Continued from Page 1

The juvenile said in an interview
after the hearing that Rice attacked
him in the parking lot of the Centel of-
fice on Washington Street. The youth
said Rice also knocked out one of his
teeth, but he declined to explain why
he and Rice were ina fight.

He said, however, that his older
brother, Richard A. ‘‘Marc’’ Smith,
and Rice had gotten into a fight ear-
lier in the evening and that his broth-
er had hit Rice.

Smith was arrested Jan. 1 and
found guilty Feb. 19 of resisting ar-
rest, assault and battery, disorderly
conduct, drunk in public and destruc-

50-60 people were at the party when
Joines returned. ‘‘He said he wanted
everyone out of the house in five
minutes, ’’ Gatti recalled.

While he was ‘‘in the process of
emptying the house,’’ Gatti said
Joines located Cox. ‘‘The officer
grabbed the guy and took him out of
the house and arrested him,” he said.

Three students who said they wit-
nessed the Cox and Walker arrests
—freshman Marshall Boswell, junior
Bob Kelly and freshman Sully Re-
nuart — gave nearly identical ac-
counts of the sequence of events.

All three quoted Joines as saying to
Walker, ‘‘You’re under arrest for
assault.”’

“When he told the officer he was
from New York, the officer said, ‘It
figures,’ ’’ Boswell said.

The three said that Walker spoke to
the officer in response to a question
directed at the crowd, and that the of-
ficer had initiated the physical con-
tact. Kelley said the officer ‘‘jerked’’
Walker, and Boswell and Renuart
said he ‘‘grabbed”’ him.

Sutton said that ‘‘from the facts I
know now,”’ Joines, who has been a
policeman for about six years and
has been on the Lexington force for
just over a year, acted properly.

Sutton said that in order for an of-
ficer to enter a fraternity house, he
must have ‘‘probable cause to make
an arrest — reason to believe by any
of the five senses that a crime is be-
ing committed in his presence.”’

tion of public property.

The last charge was filed because
Smith broke out a police car window
ina struggle with police. He was sen-
tenced to 15 days in jail and fined
$380, including $200 for the car win-
dow.

The juvenile was later taken to
Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospi-
tal by another officer to be treated
for injuries, according to an employ-
ee of the hospital who asked not to be
identified.

The source said Rice walked into
the emergency room of the hospital
and struck the handcuffed juvenile in
the face.

Richard L. Wiseman, a supervisor
for the Rockbridge Area Department
of Social Services, said his depart-
ment filed charges against Rice be-
cause it is the legal guardian of the
juvenile.

The case was tried in juvenile
court, according to Read, because
Virginia statutes require such treat-
ment whenever a juvenile is involved
as either a defendant ora victim.

135 condos to be built
on U.S. 60 near W&L

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s first condominium
community is ngw under construc-
tion, and the units being built are
targeted for members of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, accord-
ing to Richard Emrey of Baker Real
Estate and Insurance.

The project, Borden Commons,
consists of 135 units to be constructed
over the next five to 10 years. The
condominiums will be on a triangular
lot framed by Borden Road and US.
60 West, in the vicinity of Liberty
Hall and about a quarter-mile from
Washington and Lee, Emrey said.

The project is being developed by
the Duke Hathaway Corp. of Lexing-
ton, of which Emrey is a member.
The condos will be marketed by
Baker Real Estate of Lexington.

Emrey said he expects most of the
buyers to be from the college com-
munities — teachers, students and
other young professionals. ‘‘We think
that the project is one which the com-
munity needs and one which will ap-
peal to a large number of residents,”’
he said.

The first phase of construction will

include only 18 units; the rest will be
built later as the market is establish-
ed. The first units are scheduled to be
completed Aug. 15.

Emrey said Borden Commons bro-
chures are being mailed to parents of
W&L students. “We feel there is a
good market out there amongst the
students, whether it be students who
want to settle in Lexington or do
graduate work, and parents may be
interested in the units as an invest-
ment even if their children don’t stay
in them long,”’ he said.

The condominiums will be divided
into studio, one-bedroom and two
bedroom units. Studio units are pric-
ed at $29,500, one-bedroom units at
$39,500 and the two-bedroom units
from $57,500 to $62,500. All units in-
clude wooden balconies, fully-equip-
ped kitchens and wall-to-wall carpet-
ing. Fireplaces are available upon
request and are standard in the two-
bedroom units.

The buildings will be three stories
high and will be earth-tone stucco on
the outside.

The project has met some resis-
tance from the city, Emrey said, be-
cause of the complexities of pro-
viding the project with water and
sewer hookups.

Student scraps magazine plan
after EC denies funds request

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

After the Executive Committe de-
nied him funds Monday night, sopho-
more Anthony Cornealius said he has
decided not to publish a literary
Magazine containing works by stu-
dents at W&L and at area colleges.

Hesitation on the part of other
schools to participate and the fact
that ‘‘I couldn’t buy any more time’”’
led to his decision, Cornealius said.

Cornealius’ request was denied by
a 5-4-1 vote. His request had gone up
from $400 two weeks ago to $800 on
Monday.

“IT am really disappointed in the
EC,” hesaid, ‘‘but not bitter.’’

Cornealius plans to appeal to the
EC again next fall. ‘‘The money will
be harder to procure in the fall be-
cause so many other parties will be
doing the same thing,” he said.

a Chief puts Phi Kap.
on ‘social probation’:

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
met with Phi Kappa Sigma last night
and imposed what he called ‘‘a form
of social probation’’ because he said
relations between the fraternity and
police had reached ‘‘an intolerable
point.”’

After the 15-minute, all-house
meeting, Sutton declared a two-week
moratorium on that house’s acquisi-
tion of amplified sound or so-called
“noise’’ permits. The March 29
through April 8 probation period in-
cludes winter examination week,
during which University regulations
prohibit parties.

“This is the first time that this has
been done with a specific fraternity,’
said Sutton, who added that he warn-
ed Phi Kap that continued trouble
could result in future denials of per-
mits.

Problems with the fraternity have
included ‘unnecessary rowdiness
and danger of personal injury for
their guests and my officers when-
ever they have to go there,’’ Sutton
said.

Phi Kap President Jim Cobb called
the restrictions ‘‘fair,”’ but disputed a
number of Sutton’s charges, saying
the police chief’s version of the in-
cidents ‘‘is not always exactly what
happened.”

Sutton explained that Phi Kap’s

difficulties with the police “have

eae?

~
+

been more consistent” than those of *
any other fraternity. ‘‘It has gotten” |

out of the nuisance stage into the ser- ~

ious stage,” he said. *

“The members of that house have
been creating problems such as
throwing glass bottles in the street
and sidewalk, throwing beer kegs, .
glass bottles and fireworks in the
vicinity of policemen,’’ Sutton con-
tinued.

He pointed out that although there
have been problems for some time, a
party held Saturday was particularly
troublesome. ‘‘My officers had to be -
there six or seven times on different
occasions between midnight Satur-
day and3 a.m. Sunday,” hesaid.

Cobb explained that many of the in-
cidents such as bottle and firework
throwing did not happen as Sutton .
explained them and that the throwing
of the beer keg was ‘‘by no means at
a police officer.”’

‘We realize that there was a pro-
blem Saturday night,” Cobb said.
“The problem stemmed from there
being too many unaccounted for peo-
ple inthe house.”

He said one way the fraternity
hopes to prevent future problems is
by closing its parties to non-mem-
bers.

can to prevent the problems in the

in Virginia challenge

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

A squad of W&L Army ROTC
cadets from the ROTC Ranger Com-
pany captured first place in the
Ranger Challenge ’85 held last week-
end in Williamsburg.

The squad of seven cadets came in
first out of 12 squads from seven dif-
ferent schools. The other schools
were James Madison University,
Hampton Institute, William and
Mary, Virginia State, Norfolk State
and Christopher Newport.

“‘T expected them to perform well,”’
said Ranger adviser Capt. Robert R.
Ripple, “but I was surprised to see
them do this well.’’

The Ranger Challenge, the first of
its kind, was made up of nine differ-
ent events. The Ranger squad placed
first in the log race, the M16 assem-
bly/disassembly relay, the leader-
ship reaction station and the land
navigation course. The other events
were a tug of war, a rope bridge race,
a military tactics competition, a

drill-and-ceremonies competition
and a 10-kilometer road
march.

Cadet ist Lt. Arthur Kandarian,
the platoon leader of the Ranger
company, said the cadets spent a
couple of hours every day for two
weeks training and preparing for the
event.

Kandarian attributed the success
of the Ranger company to the train-
ing provided by Capt. Ripple and ©
Ranger NCO adviser Sgt. ist Class .
Raymon L. Kuper as well as ‘‘except-
ional leadership”’ on the part of Cadet
Capt. Mark Bertolini, the Ranger .
Company Commander.

A second squad of cadets alsocom- . |

peted in the challenge and placed .
fifth overall. The first squad was led .
by Bertolini, and the other members ~
were Kandarian, Tony Pfaff, An- ”

thony McCann, Steve Vogt, John * *-

Loughery and Jim Worthington.

The second squad was led by Sam '
Dawson, and the other members '
were Chris Honeycutt, Mark Solo- ’
mon, Noor Ampssler, Chris Beckert,
Rich Bennett and Bill Samii.

Record, clothes stores sold «.

 

By TED BYRD
Staff Reporter

 

Two local stores, Campus Corner
and Lexington Dry Goods, were re-
cently sold and are temporarily clos-
ed for remodeling.

The stores were purchased by Russ
Walther Jr.

Campus Corner, which will be re-
named The Campus Shop, should
open Monday for regular business,
and Lexington Dry Goods, which will
be renamed Russel’s, should open by
mid-April.

The Campus Shop, on Nelson Street
between Jefferson Street and Lee
Avenue, will be open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. and will stock an expanded se-
lection of records and tapes, ranging

from $5.99 to $6.99.
The shop also will carry stereo .
equipment, including compact disc -

-
tx

;

players and discs, and at least a li-~ *

mited line of computer software.

The shop will have about 10 out-of-
town newspapers, including The New
York Times and The Wall Street.
Journal, an expanded selection of -
magazines and fresh coffee and pas-
tries each morning, according to Rita
Mason, the store’s manager. ‘‘Right
now we're just trying to experi-
ment,’’ she said, but other possible
projects for the future may include
renting stereo and television equip-
ment so that students won’t have to
bring their entire stereo systems
from home.

When Russel’s opens it will carry
clothes for both men and women, and
will emphasize moderately priced
clothes lines.

The rivalry between Washington
and Lee and the University of Virgin-
+ ia in lacrosse made this year’s con-
frontation seem somewhat like a
state championship. When the Cav-
+ aliers walked off the field with the up-
per hand of the 17-7 score, they left
Lexington with bragging rights to the
* Commonwealth.

The Generals’ record, meanwhile,
now stands at 1-3, having lost their
® last three games to Atlantic Coast
Conference powerhouses University
of North Carolina, University of
© Maryland and U.Va. During the first
period, though, it looked as though
the Generals were going to place the
Cavaliers inthe wincolumn.

‘‘We played extremely well in the
first half and I must say that we real-
ly didn’t play badly all day, despite
the score. We played with a lot of in-
tensity,’ said Coach Dennis Daly.

With 8:51 left in the first period,
senior attackman Rod Santomassi-
mo made his mark on the minds of
the U.Va. players — he scored, and
the Generals led 1-0. But the celebra-
, tion did not last long, because 40 sec-

onds later, U.Va.’s Mike Myers re-
turned the favor and tied the game up
at 1-1. At that point, the 3,000 people
in the stands each looked at their
friends and must have realized that it
was going tobea long day.

But 20 seconds passed and senior
Sandy Brown, the Generals’ leading
scorer with seven goals, regained the
lead for W&L. The scoreboard had
only indicated the score of 2-1 for a
minute and 35 seconds before junior
Todd Breithaupt introduced himself
to the Cavaliers’ defense with a very
* personal touch — a shot and goal.
The crowd exploded. The first period
ended with the Generals leading 3-1.
* ‘“W&L came out aggressively, and
it woke us up,”’ Virginia head coach
Jim Adams said. ‘‘It took a quarter
" for us torealize we were ina battle.”’
, That battle continued throughout

the second period. After 3:08 of the
* period, the Generals’ lead was cut to
» One goal, and a short 23 seconds later,
the game was tied at three.

The 3-3 tie was then broken by jun-
ior attackman Caulley Deringer, and
the Generals led again, 4-3. The
‘ Generals then held the Cavaliers, not
allowing them to clear the ball for
nearly seven minutes. But with 3:37
left in the half, Virginia put its
scholarships to work — they tied the
gameat four.

The Ring-tum Phi

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

W&L’s Rod Santomassimo and U.Va.’s Bob Schupler battle for a ground ball in Saturday's lacrosse game.

Rich ‘‘Taz’’ Schoenberg won the
ensuing face-off, though, and worked
the ball to Bill Holmes, whose shot
from 15 feet hit Breithaupt’s foot and-
fell short of the goal. Breithaupt tried
to put in the rebound but missed, and
the Cavaliers regained possession of
the ball. They quickly moved down
the field and scored for their first
lead of the day, 5-4. Before halftime,
the Cavaliers would add another goal
tomake the score 6-4.

“The lead change didn’t really af-
fect us that much during half,”
Breithaupt said. ‘‘Everyone was
pumped up and ready toplay.”’

But within 3:08 of the third period,
U.Va.’s all-American Roddy Marino
dimmed the lights on Wilson Field as
he scored two goals to make Virgin-
ia’s lead 8-4.

The Generals refused to give in,
though, and came back with goals
from Holmes and Deringer to make
the score 8-6. But it was the Cava-

‘Netters adjusting,
‘smash Lynchburg

big match was at No. 1 singles with
David McLeod’s impressive win over
Newport’s previously undefeated Bill
O'Donnel. McLeod, playing tough
tennis, won in three sets, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.

Although the Generals again won
by an 8-1 margin, Tuesday’s match
against Lynchburg College was a
great deal oloser, with four matches
going to three sets.

In the match, Adams ran his un-
beaten string to 10 for the season.
“Scott Adams continues on his roll of
dominance at No. 6,” Franke said.

The Generals again missed a shut-
out by one match, a result, against
Lynchburg, of a strong No. 1 singles
player catching McLeod on a ‘bad
day,”’ rendering him ineffective in a
6-1, 6-2 match.

The Generals’ lineup underwent
another change this week when Mize
and Adams moved up from No. 3 to
No, 2 doubles and Haring and Wiman
down to No. 3. Of last week’s altera-
tion in singles, Franke said he was
pleased and indicated that, for the
foreseeable future, the players would
remain in their current positions.

Today the Generals have a home
match against Hampden-Sydney.

liers’ ninth goal that made heads sink
to the ground — senior goalie John
DiDuro blocked a shot, the ball fell to
the ground and was kicked in. Daly
referred to that goal as ‘‘a tough
goal, the type of goal we need to get,
not teams like U.Va.”’

The rest of the game was sheer
dominance by U.Va., which out-
scored the Generals 8-1.

The man who deserves praise is Di-
Duro’ He was like a piece of plexi-
glass in front of the goal during the
first half. He stopped shots that made
U.Va. players look twice and say, ‘‘I
thought I scored.’’ DiDuro (18 saves )
was the first goalie to stand up to
U.Va. and create a problem. For
that, DiDuro was named player of
the game, along with Holmes.

“We've been up and down offen-

Or perhaps he means they couldn’t
get by DiDuro and the spectacular
defense that just wouldn’t let up.

“Against Towson, we need to be
physical. I’’m worried the team will
be uptight. But if we play like we can
play we will win and be the best we
canbe,” Daly said.

This week, the Generals will play
at Towson State, which lost to UNC
26-5 last week. The Generals are
most likely favored in this contest
and should be able to dominate the
game.

W&L assistant coach Sam Carpen-
ter summed up the Generals’ pro-
gress as this: “If I was the assistant
at Towson and scouted W&L Satur-
day against U.Va., I would be very
concerned. W&L is not to be taken
lightly.”’

“T think and billie that if we con-
iinue to improve game by game we
could go 8-3,’’ Carpenter said.

Stanford, a junior co-captain of
the team, finished seventh in the
200-yard butterfly and eighth in
the 100-yard butterfly to claim A-
A honors, while Sullivan, a fresh-
man, ended up in 16th place in the
500-yard freestyle event.

As a team; W&L sent seven
swimmers to the Championships
and finished the weekend in 25th
place in a field of over 90 teams.

ATLANTA — ....(Even a dateline

can’t stop the dots. ) They had the
NCAA Division II] Swimming and
Diving Championships here, but I
will take more from here than times
and swimmers and lots of water. Be-
cause of the extraordinary talents of
one young man and his means of
dealing with that talent, I was able
to witness a certain strength of character, unassuming yet confi-

dent, that we look for in the true champion.

I’m talking about a junior swimmer from Ohio's Kenyon College.
His name is Jim Born. So far, this probably means all of nothing to
you. The point is that last weekend, Born — Division III swimming’s
equivalent to the NHL’s Wayne Gretzky — won or was part of winning
seven events. But the real reason for commendation is that Born was
expected to do that well. It is the ability to respond to such pressure, to
see what people expect, and then to go four or five steps beyond those
expectations that demands attention.

What is interesting about Division III is that you are clouded by the
thinking that these athletes were not good enough to get Division I
scholarships, hence their ability level dims by comparison. That’s
simply not the case with Born, who qualified for the Olympic trials last

year,

To look at him, you wouldn’t know this was a swimmer, let alone a
championship swimmer. He’s probably all of 5-fuot-9 and probably in
the neighborhood of 165 pounds soaking wet. Indeed, not your Steve
Lundquist type. But then you look again and you see something — yes,

it might sound trite, that is, if it weren’t true —

word ‘go,’ this guy’s a winner.

in his eyes. From the

Watching Born swim was a unique experience. Even if you weren’t
interested in the sport, he’s the kind of performer that you just sit and
watch in awe. No yawns, no paging through the program to see what
the next event is or what kind of films the NCAA is offering. It’s the
kind of performance for which instant replay is made.

Picture this, Born set records (that’s as in more than one) in the 50-
freestyle (swimming’s 100-yard dash) both in the morning’s
preliminary and the evening’s final heat. The record going into the
championships was 20.76. A couple of hours later Born had cut the
mark to 19.97. The feat warranted a standing ovation, and got one.

It was in the end a pleasure to be able to watch a top athlete like Jim
Born perform. I wonder how often this superiority in action is present
in our world of repeating the big story and ignoring the little story.
Well, this piece has been an example of just how big those little stories

can be....

....Back home again at the Colonnade, and I heur the lacrossers gave
U.Va. fits for almost a half. I’m going to say that’s a good sign’ but I’m
sure there’s a contingent who are wondering when W&L is going to
stop banging its head against a wall...While we’re on swimming, a tip
of the cap to those W&L swimmers who earned All-America status:
Tim Stanford and Eric Sullivan (Just in case the stuffed shirt intellec-
tuals were wondering, the hard work and long hours did pay off.)....

... Something tells me the Big East breeds the best basketball this
year. Good to see all the ‘‘Black Sunday”’ ACC stories after the in-
famous weekend devastation. And some say the Big East has nothing
near the parity level that the ACC has. Ask Georgetown about the fits
it got from UConn early this year or the time Seton Hall led St. John’s
by 12in a January game....Word to wise, while we’re on the subject:
UNC will blow a lot of people’s doors off next year. Watch out for a
freshman named Jeff Lebo, kind of a Kyle Macy with quickness, mus-

cle and scoring punch...

...1’m going to put my neck on the line — as if it is any great
sacrifice — and say that Georgetown will not win the national
championship and that they will be beaten by a Big East team. It does
have some options open, none of which are fathomable....

...Finally, the Mickey Mouse Times and Donald Duck Review says
that Chris Mullin and Pat Ewing won’t be able to wear their T-shirts in
the NBA next year. Some sort of rule about uniform uniforms.
Granted, that is a piece of startiing information (something the
MacNeil-Lehrer Report just won’t touch), but for as much as these
guys are going to be making, I don’t think they’ll mind making such a

concession...

 

 

Silent bats have ‘nine’ mired in slump

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington Lee baseball
team, plagued by hitting and injury
problems, dropped its sixth and
seventh consecutive games this
week, losing to Hampden-Sydney,
13-4, and Lynchburg, 8-4.

The losses lowered the Generals’
record to 2-7 overall and 0-4 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The Generals’ woes go beyond the
losses, though.

The team’s hottest hitter at the
start of the season, Hugh Finkelstein,
underwent arthroscopic knee sur-
gery yesterday. He is expected to be
out for at least two weeks. In addi-
tion, starting catcher Mike Jacoby
has been forced out of his catching
duties with an injury to his throwing
hand.

Leslie gets win 100;
linksters go to 4-0

Washington and Lee golf coach
Buck Leslie won his 100th match
Monday when the Generals defeated

Bridgewater and Shepherd to bring, - -

their record to 4-0.

“I was more interested in winning
the match Monday, but it is very nice
to reach that 100-win -milestone,’’
said Leslie, who has led W&L to three
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
championships.

Freshman Gary Campbell led the
Generals with a low round of 77 on the
par-71 Lexington Country Club
course.

Last Thursday, W&L beat Liberty
Baptist and Longwood to post their
first two victories of the season. The
team scores were W&L 322, Liberty
Baptist 332 and Longwood 338

W&L’s next outing is Friday in
Lynchburg against Liberty Baptist

Despite his team’s difficulties,
head coach Jim Murdock maintains
that the Generals have the ability to
beamong the ODAC’s best.

“It’s really frustrating,’’ Murdock
said. ‘‘We’re capable of being a good
team but we're starting to doubt our-
selves. We’re just getting to the part
of the season where our people are
getting their baseball sense back,
even though it has taken too long.”’

Against Lynchburg yesterday, the
Generals were hurt by one big inning.
WA&L trailed only 2-1 entering the
eighth inning before giving up four
unearned runs to the Hornets.

Lynchburg scored four runs on an
error, two walks and three hits, mak-
ing the score 6-1. Lynchburg added
two more runs in the ninth off W&L
reliever Peter Detlefs to up its lead to
8-1.

CHRIS McGOWAN

The Generals could muster only
three hits against Lynchburg starter
Judd Petrone. Breen pitched 7%, giv-
ing up four earned runs on six hits
before being relieved by Detlefs.

‘We hit the ball pretty well, but
just right at somebody,” Murdock
said after the Lynchburg loss. ‘‘We
played pretty well defensively. We’re
still putting too much pressure on
ourselves, We were hurt by our old
nemesis, the one bad inning.”’

“In the eighth, Kirk was getting a
little tired, and we couldn’t get him
out in time,’’ Murdock said.

Last Thursday, W&L fell to Hamp-
den-Sydney, 13-4, in a game that had
the makings of a low scoring contest
through the first three innings when
neither team could score. The
Generals had the bases loaded in
both the second and third innings

with no outs and one out, respective-
ly, but were unable to get the crucial
hit toscorea run.

In the fifth, W&L took a 2-0 lead on-
ly to see the Tigers post four runs in
their half of the inning. H-SC added
five more runs in the sixth, making
the score 9-2, holding on the rest of
the way for the win.

Bill Schoettelkotte got the loss for
W&L after starting strongly before
fading in the fifth and sixth innings.
Freshman Carter Steuart pitched 2',
innings in relief for Schoettelkotte.

W&L gets its next chance to get
back in the victory column tomorrow
against crosstown rival VMI. The
Generals face Emory and Henry Sat-
urday in an away doubleheader and
host Eastern Mennonite and H-SC in
astretch of ODAC games next week.

T&F runs streak to 13

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Winning seven of the 16 events, the
Washington and Lee track team won
a four-way meet that also included
Newport News Apprentice, Roanoke
and Eastern-Mennonite at Wilson
Field on Tuesday.

The Generals scored 871% points en
route to their victory. Newport News
took second with 63 points. Roanoke
and Eastern Mennonite finished third
and fourth, scoring 22 and 101% points
respectively.

The Generals are now 6-0 overall
and 4-0 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

The injury-plagued Generals suf-
fered another casualty on Tuesday
when sophomore John Burlingame
pulled his hamstring while running
the third leg of the 400 meter relay.
The Generals currently have three

people on the injury list, all with pull-
ed hamstring, including Burlingame.
Kevin Weaver and Bill Rhinehart
both have severe pulls also. John
Carder is nursing a sore hamstring.

Head track coach Norris Aldridge
said it is very unusual to have that
many pulled hamstrings on the team
at the same time. ‘‘It’s hurting our
depth a little bit,”’ said Aldridge. He
added, however, ‘‘We can’t really do
anything about it.’ Aldridge hopes
that the injured team members are
100 percent when the Generals par-
ticipate in the OAC outdoor cham-
pionships.

The Generals have now completed
their outdoor dual meet schedule for
this season. The 1985 record of six
wins and no losses combined with
last year’s record of 7-0 gives the
Generals a 13-meet victory streak.
The win streak is Coach Aldridge’s
longest during his career as W&L's
head track coach.

thesis

By BOB BRYANT
Special to The Phi

 

 

Chris Liflja is busy working on his
senior thesis. But instead of studying
by himself insome remote corner, he
is standing in the middle of a room
full of people.

Dressed in elaborate 17th-century
costumes, they listen to him as in-
tently as a team listens to their coach
before a game. Lillja is dressed in
jeans and sweater and holds a yellow
tablet covered with notes. ‘‘How are
you going to show an infuriated
monk?” he asks one of the actors.
“I’ve never seen a monk raise his
voice.”

Lillja is a drama major. His senior
thesis is a production of Bertold
Brecht's ‘‘Galileo,’’ which will open.
at 8 p.m. tomorrow at the Troubador
Theatre. He has been working on the
play for almost a year because, like
any other senior thesis, ‘‘the entire
department analyzes and evaluates
the project.’ He will enter the
graduate school at Virginia Com-
monwealth University this fall.

Last year Lillja directed ‘‘The In-
former,’ a one-act play by Brecht
that deals with the impact of the
Gestapo on German family life.

ly designed to be not naturalistic

The University Theatre will present Berthold Brecht's “Galileo” beginning tomorrow night.

for the audience. That's my favorite
thing about Brecht,”’ Lilljasaid.

“Theater is the most effective
teaching tool we have," he added. He
calls ‘‘Galileo’’ a ‘‘learning play,”’
because its message ‘‘needs to be
said.”’ He said he is ‘‘updating’’ this
production by ‘relating it to the
modern military-industrial complex
and atomic weapons. ”’

Lillja said Brecht ‘‘is telling us that
science needs to be directed by the
forces of humanity, not by the forces
of profits and greed. This must of
course begin with the scientists
themselves. ”’

Galileo himself is played by Mark
Daughtrey, who graduated from
W&L in 1974 and has studied at the
American Academy of Fine Art.

“Mark is wonderful to work with,”’
Lillja said. “He has amazing
amounts of talent.’’ Daughtrey star-
red as Thomas More in the Universi-
ty Theatre’s production of ‘‘A Man
for All Seasons”’ in the fall of 1982.

In the dressing room, Lillja asks
another actor, ‘‘How are you going to
show the little kids in the audience
the difference between Sacredo and
the philosopher?’’ The actor, like
many others in the company, is hav-
ing to play two separate roles and
make quick costume changes several
times in the course of the evening.

“It’s common procedure in Brecht
to double up roles,"’ Lillja said. “‘It’s
difficult, but I'm very pleased with
the cast I have.” The play contains 41
different speaking roles, ‘and when

there are only about 10 drama ma-
jors, we have toadapt.”’

The first step a director must take
is to place himself ‘‘in the position of
the actor in each different role,’’ Lill-
ja said. ‘‘You’ve got to understand
both acting and directing, even
though you don’t have to be talented
at one todo the other.”

Minutes after Lillja leaves the
dressing room, he is down in the

theater, pacing side-to-side in an ai-

sle as the technical crew runs
through the special effects supplied
by NASA and the U.S. Army. His face
breaks intoa wide grin.

‘I won’t get a chance to do this big
a production for a long time,’’ Lillja
said. ‘‘Even in graduate programs at
big state schools, they’re doing most-
ly one-acts.”’

Student directors present
three ‘bad’ one-act plays

“An Evening of Bad One-Acts,”’
three one-act plays, will be perform-
ed next Wednesday and Thursday in
the Boiler Room _ Theatre,
underneath the Old Main Street Mall.

Are the plays as bad as advertised?

No, says the director of one of the
plays, senior Todd Jones,

“However, it makes a great adver-
tising gimmick,’’ he said. ‘‘We’re
hoping to bring people in by daring
them to see just how bad these plays
are, and the general idea is that
they’ll be pleasantly surprised.”

Curtain time is 7:30 p.m. for both
showings. Admission is free, and
reservations are not required.

The first one-act, ‘‘The Zoo Story”’
by Edward Albee, is directed by jun-
ior Christopher Carmouche. The cast
consists of only two characters:
middle-aged men named Jerry and
Peter, portrayed by seniors Taylor

Hathaway and Bob Halloran, respec-
tively.

‘Bea, Frank, Ritchie and Jones,”’
a 1960s comedy written by Renee
Taylor and Joe Bolognia, will be the
second production. It is directed by
junior David Marsh.

“Black Comedy,” by Peter Shaf-
fer, is the final production and will be
directed by Jones with junior Bruin
Richardson serving as stage man-

ager.

German film set

The Film Society will present Wer-
ner Herzog’s 1982 epic of obsession,
‘“‘Fitzearroldo,’’ tomorrow and Satur-
day.

Screenings will be at 8 p.m. both
evenings in Classroom A of Lewis
Hall. Admission is free.

‘Splatter film’ saga
lives — unfortunately

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

Surprise of surprises! ‘‘Friday the
13th, The Final Chapter’ wasn’t the
final chapter after all. Now playing
at the Lyric is the latest horror/hack
‘em up, “Friday the 13th, Part 5, A
New Beginning.” Jason Voorhees
(or is it Jason Voorhees?) is back to
terrorize, cut and kill. Surprisingly,
“Friday 5’’ attempts to be a psycho-
logical film with substance to it, but
it reverts to the use of typical horror-
movie cliches and leaves its cutting
edge as a breakthrough ‘‘slasher”’
picture.

Young Tommy, who killed Jason in
“Final Chapter,’ is now a young
adult in a mental institution, a result
of the trauma caused by his exper-
ience with Jason. He is brought to a
special rehabilitation facility to
prepare him for reentering society,
but bursts of violent temper and fre-
quent ‘‘sightings’” of Jason key the
audience to realize he isn’t quite
ready for society. Then, a violent
murder at the institution sets off a
string of more murders, and we are
propelled into Jason’s realm again.

Like every ‘‘slasher,”’ “Friday 5”
is loaded with gruesome killings,
some seen, others known only by see-
ing the dead victims. Taken lightly, —
these bizarre murders form the unbe-
lievable backdrop to a joke of a
movie. Taken seriously, one wonders °
why such pictures are made, and
worse, why they are big box office
dreaws. :

Credit can be given to the idea of
making ‘Friday 5’’ a bit of a my-
stery: I felt for Tommy as he strug-
gled to forget the spectre of Jason, .
and for a few minutes, I actually _
wondered if he was the new Jason.
Then, after a moment of semi-ap-
plied thinking, I realized who the
killer was, and the rest of the movie
went quickly downhill. The ending, of »
course, is a head spinner that sets up
still more sequels.

Andisn’t that the name of the game
anyway? We seem doomed to a fate _
of sequels year in and year out. ‘“‘Fri-
day the 13th, Part 5, A New Begin »
ning” is not so new at all; it is a for-
mula ‘‘slasher’’ movie, and we can
expect more sequels to result. Some-
day the chant ‘‘Jason, Jason, Jason, ,
Jason...kill, kill, kill, kill....”’ may
end, but sadly, I doubtit. :

Faculty studies proposed drug rules

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Possession or use of drugs would not be an
offense punishable by the University under a
proposed disciplinary policy being reviewed
by the faculty. The report says such regula-
tions are ‘‘impractical.”’

Distribution of drugs or possession of drugs
with intent to distribute them, however, would
be offenses under new Student Control Com-
mittee guidelines contained in the proposal.

The recommendations are included in the
report of the Drug Policy Review Committee,
formed in September by University President
John D. Wilson at the request of the Board of
Trustees.

The 30-page report will be voted on by the
faculty before it is submitted, possibly with
revisions, to the trustees next month.

“However much we want the student to
eschew drug use,’’ the report says, ‘‘we could
find no basis...for punishing a student for an
act committed in private, behind closed doors,
and which does not result in any of the behav-
ior already subject to disciplinary sanctions.”

Head Dormitory Counselor Bob Tomaso,
one of three student members of the commit-
tee and the only member to oppose the com-
mittee’s drug recommendation, wrote in a

. f ¥
bs J A 4te

ee |

strongly worded dissent that not penalizing
drug use would put dormitory counselors ‘‘in
an impossible situation.”

Other highlights of the proposal include a
distinction between ‘‘major’’ and ‘“‘minor’’ of-
fenses under the jurisdiction of Student Con-
trol and a number of changes in the proce-
dures of Student Control.

A minority report by Dean of Students Lewis
G. John and two other professors urges addi-
tional faculty involvement in the student disci-
plinary system.

The 10-member committee was composed of
six professors, John and three students — Pete
Baumgaertner, Darby Brower and Tomaso.

What Happens Next?: Psychology Pro-
fessor Leonard E. Jarrard, who chaired the
committee, said he expects a final reeommen-
dation to be adopted at the May 6 faculty meet-
ing so it can be presented to the trustees at
their May 24-25 meeting. He said a special
meeting of the faculty may have to be called to
discuss the proposal.

Wilson sent the report to the faculty and the
student body Executive Committee last week,
and Jarrard said he made a 20-minute presen-
tation of the recommendations at Monday’s
faculty meeting.

A meeting of the Faculty Discussion Club,
which meets occasionally for informal discus—
sion of issues of concern to professors, is

eeiiahiememiinimerteen: execneceesiess ceeatiee eee

scheduled for the first week of spring term.

“Some of the recommendations will meet
witha lot of controversy with the faculty,”’ Jar-
rard said. ‘‘To get agreement is going to re-
quire much discussion and consideration.”’

Jarrard declined to discuss specifics of the
report. ‘I can’t talk about particulars now
with the faculty just getting involved,’”’ he
said.

The report suggests implementation of the
recommendations for a trial period of three
years, after which the system would be re-
evaluated.

Drugs—The Committee’s View: The report
specifically points out that possession or use of
drugs is not included on the suggested list of
offenses.

The committee said that present University
regulations against drug use ‘‘operate in ways
that are capricious, discriminatory and con-
trary to our stated policy.”

“To those who might argue that our discipli-
nary system should discourage unwanted be-
havior, and drug use is certainly unwanted be-
havior,’’ the report says, ‘‘we answer that we
would also want just as much to discourage
such behavior as drunkenness and smoking to-
bacco, but using the disciplinary system to ac-
complish any of these ends seems impracti-
chi.”

Because the University does not specifically

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

penalize an act does not mean it condones it,
the report claims.

Drugs—Tomaso’s View: Tomaso vehement-
ly dissented from the committee consen-
sus, writing in a minority report that the pro-
posed drug regulations ‘‘may backfire’ and
would lead to ‘‘increased rowdiness in the dor-
mitories.”’

He said a defect of the plan is that students
would be ‘‘allowed to use drugs in the dormi-
tories when very few members of the commu-
nity are actually willing to allow such behav-
i0f.”

“It leaves a dorm counselor in a position
where he allows ‘non-disruptive personal drug
use,’ yet is forced to draw the line on when to
interfere,’’ he continued. ‘This is a most dif-
ficult task for even a professional drug counse-
lor.”’

“While I stress the fact that I am not person-
ally opposed to individuals who choose to ex-
periment with drugs, I ask the potential endor-
sers of this statement to consider the conse-
quences of allowing personal drug use in the
dormitories,’ Tomaso wrote.

“It is not in the best interests of Washington
and Lee.”’

Offenses: The committee recommended
that matters under the jurisdiction of the Stu-
dent Control Committee be classified as ‘‘mi-

Psychology Professor David G. Elmes remembers a

 

It’s last-ditch-effort time. Both teachers and students
try to telescope 12 weeks of classes into,one week of
finals. For some students, just taking the exam is not
enough, These are the ones who insist on writing little

notes to the professor at the end of the exam.

For instance, English department Chairman Sidney
M.B. Coulling received quotations from a particular
Robert Browning piece. ‘‘Ah, but a man’s reach should

exceed his grasp,/Or what’s a heaven for?”’

“It is a way of suggesting, ‘I tried, so grade me on my
efforts,’ ’’ Coulling said. ‘‘Of course, there is some merit

inthatidea.”’

Philosophy department Chairman Harrison J. Pem-
berton found a special note on part of a Meaning and Ex-

istence (Philosophy 251) exam.

“‘T had the class write a one-page term paper for their
exam and they had to pledge that it was the best work
they could possibly do,’’ Pemberton recalled. ‘‘One stu-
dent wrote and signed the pledge and put that if it was

not true, may lightning strike him down.

“What made the pledge particularly interesting was

 

somewhat different kind of student response toanexam.

“I had a student flip out once and answer the Psycho-
logy 102 exam with Religion 102 answers,” he said.

“But according to the religion department the an-
swers would not have been right there either.”

Elmes jokingly added that it would take an awful lot to
influence his grading. ‘‘I have not been offered a Rolls
Royce yet,’’ he said. “‘I think would need the keys and
the title, first.”

Mathematics Professor Robert S. Johnson also re-
members a student taking a completely different ap-
proach toanexam.

“This is from years ago, and he didn’t do any of the
problems on the exam.” he said,

‘“‘The student wrote about a four- or five-page note and
started asking for a ‘D.’ He was just certain that God
would bless me if I could find it in the goodness of my
heart to give hima ‘D.’

‘After three pages, he had so convinced himself of his
case that he changed his story. Instead of asking for a
‘D,’ he asked for a ‘C.” ”’

“‘Of course,’ Johnson said, ‘“‘the guy got an ‘F.’ ”’

Brown worked for W&L from 1971
to 1976. While at the University, she
developed a_ bibliographical _ re-
sources course, served as chairman
of the board of publishers of W&L’s
literary journal, Shenandoah, and in
1976, received a Ring-tum Phi award,
which recognizes faculty, staff and
students who have made significant
contributions to the University com-
munity.

“She is a very well-trained libra-
rian,”’ said Dean of the College John
W. Elrod, chairman of the eight-per-
son search committee. ‘‘She has ex-
cellent training in library science.
She has the experience of being a li-
brarian in outstanding libraries.”’

Brown, who said she’s been back to
Lexington an average of once a year,
added that she was excited when
Elrod informed her last Wednesday
of her selection.

“I’m still getting adjusted to it,”
Brown said in a telephone interview.
“T was very interested in coming
back to Washington and Lee.”’

Brown, who will begin work in Ju-
ly, was on campus in February for in-
terviews and meetings with the
search committee, the library staff,
the faculty library committee, Elrod
and President John D. Wilson.

useful for us to learn from the faculty
who were here that she served this li-
brary well.... She had been a very

onthe faculty.”’

Among plans she has for the li-
brary, Brown said, are working with
surrounding libraries to exchange in-
formation, increasing the amount of
commercial information available
for retrieval and bringing the card
catalog up todate.

Cinda Rankin sees herself in a
history-making role.

Rankin, if you'll remember, |

was named assistant athletic
director at Washington and Lee in
January. Her primary responsi-
bility will lie in coordinating
women’s athletics. It is a task
whose significance and challenge
she eagerly awaits.

“| definitely see this as a his-
tory-making position, and with
that there’s going to be pressure,
although I see the pressure in a
very positive sense in that it’s
something very exciting to me,”’
she said in her office this week.

Rankin arrived at W&L last
week and is currently adjusting to

her new surroundings. ‘‘I’ve real-
ly enjoyed it so far. Of course,
we’re still on the honeymoon.”’

Well, it’s been a _ working
‘“‘honeymoon,”’ Rankin has met
with the coaches of the proposed
women’s sports teams for next
year (cross country, golf, tennis
and swimming and diving) and
has begun her duties as one of the
administrators for the NCAA Di-
vision III Tennis Championships.
W&L will serve as host for the
May 13-19 championships.

Her immediate duties also in-
clude a survey of the women ac-
cepted to W&L to find out where
their athletic interests lie. She
said that one team sport for wo-
men could be added for the 1986-87
school year.

Rankin said she likes the chal-
lenge of starting a program. ‘I

think it will be much more rewar-
ding to know that I’ll be building
and working from the ground le-
vel. Then you can look back and
say, ‘Whatever happens, be it
negative or positive, it was my
creation,’ ’’she said.

As the central figure in the
development of a women’s athle-
tic program at W&L, Rankin said
she does feel some pressure to
succeed.

“T think it’s really critical for
any program to get as healthy a
start as it can. I tend to think the
stronger you start the more likely
you are to attract other quality
athletics,’’ she said.

Nice policy

The report of the Drug Policy Review Committee issued
last week, although beginning to head in the right direction,
represents a setback in the University’s campaign against
the use of illegal substances. The report attempts to create a
policy through which the Washington and Lee disciplinary
system can deal with students found using drugs. It fails
miserably in any such feeble try.

Most disturbing of the committee’s recommendations is its
delineation of major and minor conduct offenses. Foremost,
the report struggles to distinguish between the possession of
marijuana and its sale while never quite explaining how such
a difference should be formally expressed. Are we to assume
that the University would follow legal definitions of intent ac-
cording to the amount possessed?

Further, while the committee says it wants to ‘eschew
drug use,’’ it simulataneously gives tacit approval to the
abuse of narcotic substances by saying that what goes on
behind closed doors — even on University property — is not
to be closely monitored. The logic behind such a statement is
incredible. We can only suppose that the committee also
finds no basis for punishing a student for murder — another
act deemed illegal according to society’s laws — as long as
the student commits the act behind closed doors. We are not
suggesting that a witchhunt begin to determine who is using
what, but a University policy ought to be strong enough to
take a firm stand wherever one is needed. Is the faculty un-
sure whether they disapprove of student use of illegal sub-
stances?

Although the proposed policy makes fine reference to ex-
tenuation (a student’s behavior is not excused because
he/she is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol), it falls
drastically short of any direct dealing with any preventative
action. Using any disciplinary structure at the University
level in an attempt to ‘‘discourage unwanted behavior, and
drug use is certainly unwanted behavior, we answer that we
would also want just as much to discourage such behavior as
drunkenness and smoking tobacco, but using the disciplinary
system to accomplish any of these ends seems impractical.”
Are we to follow such logic and suppose that because no
practical disciplinary structures exist we should not do
anything about our opposition to drug use? Impracticality
should not be a basis for a ‘‘yes or no”’ decision. There is a
foolish consistency to such a notion. The committee seems to
have conveniently forgotten that the current Student Control
Committee does serve as an effective medium to discourage
unwanted alcoholic misbehavior.

Later in the report, the committee decides something
scientists continue to debate. In a curious twist to its already
erratic logic, the committee decides that marijuana use is to
be deemed ‘‘less dangerous”’ than other drugs students might
use. Such a conclusion seems, again, logically untenable. To
attempt to legitimize any narcotic by labelling it as less
dangerous is at best questionable, at worse, dumb. Grades of
harm do not exist in the context of drug use just as degrees of
guilt do not exist in honor cases. Society’s laws do not
recognize a grade of illegality and neither should we.

The committee follows up its statement of the degree of
harm of drug use by piously assuring itself of the effective-
ness of its drug ‘‘educational programs.” Any attempt to ad-
dress the problem of drug use through an educational pro-
gram seems weakened if the sponsor of the program is not
willing to go on the record as actively opposed to drug use.
Will such educational programs be strengthened from their
present insipid, milquetoast state? If anything, the Universi-
ty certainly does reserve the right to tell students how they
will act while at the University. Students attend Washington
and Lee knowing that certain rules will govern their behavior
while they are here. Yet, the policy seems to say otherwise.

In a dissenting report to one section of the proposal, senior
Bob Tomaso makes a cogent argument about the commit-
tee’s report on the whole — the distinction between ‘‘non-dis-
ruptive personal drug use’’ and potentially dangerous disrup-
tive drug use is at best nebulous. The committee’s recom-
mendation that dormitory counselors be monitors for distin-
guishing between potentially dangerous drug use and safe
drug use (oxymoron?) is, again, foolish.

The report is not all worthy of criticism. Indeed, the
dissenting report urging greater faculty input into discipli-
nary proceedings seems enlightened in view of seeming cur-
rent student reluctance to punish their peers. We would urge
that the SCC stay as a wholly student group were its past
record more respectable in regard to dealing with student in-
fractions. The committee’s recognition that alcohol is the
most common drug abused on campus is another step in the
right direction. However, while they condemn the current
University alcohol policy because alcohol abuse is out of
hand, they are promoting the same potential problem with
regard to drug use. Will the University 10 years from now
condemn this drug policy because it promotes drug abuse?
We believe that is self-evident after reviewing the commit-
tee’s findings.

What must be done to prevent this policy from being enact-
ed in its original form is evident. Students ought to speak with
faculty members and let their opinions be known. Additional-
ly, faculty members ought to consider carefully the report’s
recommendations. The report seems to be facing in the right
direction. It is only a pity that it takes one step forward for
every two it takes backward.

Study may reveal bias

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

In Saturday’s edition of the
Roanoke Times & World-News, Neil
T. Pentifallo, a 1980 Washington and
Lee graduate and a former member
of the Executive Committee, wrote a
letter regarding the situation of
‘‘blacks’’ a Washington and Lee.

‘I was particularly troubled to
read that black students live in ‘great
fear’ of the honor code,’’ he writes.
“Concerns over living in ‘great fear’
are exaggerated and suggest that
students are being watched and de-
serve special treatment because of
possible discrimination. Nothing
could harm these students more,
since any preferential treatment
causes resentment by other students
and is unnecessary in the first
place.”’

I could not agree more with his
premise. History has shown that
preferential treatment given any
group, industry or race backfires in
the long run, because such special
treatment leads to atrophy and,
eventually, decay. What matters to-
day, however, is that people even
perceive that the Honor System
“does not work”’ for them. Black or
white, male or female, law student or
undergraduate — when even one per-
son believes the system has failed,
the system begins to tarnish.

Last week, we urged that next
year’s Executive Committee under-

take an extensive study of the Honor
System and survey the student body
for their opinions regarding its effec-
tiveness. We also suggested that re-
consideration of the single-sanction
rule be studied, because some faculty
members have privately voiced
reservations about its effectiveness.
Perhaps we should have added that
next year’s group ought to study any
“‘biases’’ the system may now have.
This study could begin with the White
Book Revisions Committee currently
considering modifications to the
Honor System.

With women as fellow students,
and in light of an increased effort on
the part of some University officials
to enroll more minority students,
such a study seems in order. While I
believe that the system works well
now, I also realize that there may be
certain ingrained aspects of the
White Book that could be perceived
to favor the traditional ‘‘WASPy”’
student. I am not asking for a special
“representative” to be added to the
EC just to iron out any biases that
may appear nor do I believe such
special treatment is needed. What we
must do is admit that not everyone
perceives the system as being per-
fect.

Studying the system would require
all students to contribute. Discussing
race and gender and racism.and dis-
crimination can become a_ very
sticky matter, especially with the di-
verse views present on this campus.
But that should not inhibit our at-
tempt torefine the system.

Dean paid for SCC letter

Tothe Editors: :

Two letters appeared in The Phi
last week concerning wasted student
funds. One letter came from Nelson
Patterson, the other from Joseph C.
Jefferis. I have several comments to
make in regard to these letters that
may benefit them. First, the fact that
the Student Control Committee
letterhead names two committee
officers who were running for re-
election does not bother me. These
two gentlemen earned their posi-
tions. They have served as elected
class officers for a year and there-
fore deserve any advantage which
this service may give them. The EC
members get year-round publicity of
this type, and yet I have never heard
a complaint.

Secondly, both students question
the use or abuse of money for this
mailing. If either student had taken
the time to inquire about the source
of the money used, instead of assum-
ing that it had come from student
taxes, they would have found that the
Dean’s office paid for everything. If
this were known, both students would
realize that I could not have sent out
such letters without Dean John’s con-
sent. The letter was, in fact, proofed

by Dean John and we were in agree-
ment that the individual letters
would have a greater impact on stu-
dents.

Mr. Jefferis, it is a fact that many
students are not aware of the fact
that their elected class officers are
members of the SCC. Furthermore,
too many students do not know the
detail of our responsibility. This is
also a fact, as many students who
have cases to turn in do not know
which committee handles them, and
those students brought before SCC
had no idea about our jurisdiction.
This is a concern of mine as well as
the faculty, who can revoke the re-
sponsibility of this committee at any
time. I think that the efficiency of
this year’s committee — ‘‘people of
this nature,’’ as you described us,
Mr. Jefferis — is largely responsible
for the continued respect and support
which this portion of student govern-
ment shall receive. If you can sug-
gest that myself and other members
be kept out of office, Mr. Jefferis,
then I suggest that you attempt to run
for office.

Pointers for Lewis

 

John Lewis is in place, with Webb
and Caruthers at his side. We all
know Lewis’ dedication and good in-
tentions, and so in light of this year,
we have high hopes. But here are a
few thoughts that might fit well with
those other qualities.

John’s zeal and frankness in the
Big Three forum impressed me, but
also frightened me when employed
with some of his views. He adamant-
ly believes law students should not do
the ‘‘defending’’ and ‘‘prosecuting”’
with the Honor System — which
shows that he views the Honor Sys-
tem as legalistic and adversarial. Al-
though public trials are set up this
way, it is very important not to view
them this way — and especially im-
portant not to view private trials this
way. If the Honor System is seen as
rules in the White Book, then execut-
ing the Honor System comes to be us-
ing those rules — not appealing to
one’s sense of honor. Our Honor Sys-
tem’s strength lies in its non-codifi-
able nature; it is, therefore, not le-
galistic. You don’t need legal train-
ing to defend the Honor System.

John talk: »out repre-
senting the views of the students.
Unrepresented students aren’t a pro-
blem — lack of a deep understanding
of the Honor System is.

Another point about the Honor Sys-

tem, for which he can look to Cole
Dawson as a lesson, is the role of the
president in protecting absolute con-
fidentiality. ‘‘Confidentiality’’ is an
all-important catch-phrase in run-
ning the Honor System It should be
always in the EC’s mind. That our
system is totally confidential demon-
strates and expresses where our va-
lues lie — not in punishment or moral
haughtiness, but in living honorably
with honorable people. Observing
confidentiality protects the sacred
privacy of the individuals involved —
as wellasthe EC.

Please, John, learn this right
away. Earlier in the year, after a
preliminary honor investigation and
the EC’s deciding not to hear a case,
Cole saunters up to the person accus-
ed and informs him of what has hap-
pened. For the chief protector of con-
fidentiality to do this should be
unthinkable, and _ inexcusable.
What's worse is that it shows the
chief trustee of the Honor System to
be totally ignorant of that sacred
thing we have trusted him with.

John Lewis is of the highest integri-
ty and certainly embodies the ideals
of the Honor System — let him rely
on those ideals and he’II do fine.

Controlling costs?

Tothe Editors:

The current controversy over the
library raises two questions that go
beyond simply whether or not to re-
tain its current hours of operation.
The first of these is how serious the
administration is in trimming the
budget, and, secondly, where the U-
niversity’s priorities lie.

If, indeed, the University is serious
about budget-cutting, several areas
come to mind where effective action
could seemingly be taken to reduce
expenses. For example, why does the
University need several photograph-
ers with complete and separate dark
room facilities? It would seem that
one such facility serving the Univer-
sity photographer would suffice.

The fleet of University cars is
another example. Obviously there is
a need for such vehicles. However,
whether or not the current number is
needed is another question, as is their
assignment to individuals for person-
al as well as school use. In addition to
their physical upkeep, these vehicles
cost a great deal toinsure,

The constant modification and re-
decoration of offices is also extreme-
ly costly, and needs to be borne in
mind, particularly since Admissions
and Development are planning up-
coming moves. Much of what is done
is nice to have, but perhaps goes
beyond what is absolutely necessary.
Travel expenses can be exorbitant,
and seem to need extra scrutiny in an
economic crunch, yet the administra-
tion has said that such considerations
are strictly off-limits. In fact, more
traveling has been recommended, re-
gardless of cost.

The new University phone system
was installed last summer ata cost of
approximately one-half million dol-
lars. One has to wonder why, when
the administration considers the
$25,000 necessary to keep the library
open at night an extravagance. If any
expense seems superfluous, the
phone system would have to be deem-
ed as such, when the old system was
perfectly capable of meeting our
needs. Unquestionably, such equip-
ment is state-of-the-art technology,
but is it justifiable in a period of
strapped finances?

This leads to consideration of the
second question, namely the priori-
ties of the University. Hopefully, aca-
demic pursuits are the primary goal

of an institution of higher learning.
The proper role of a college adminis-
tration should be to further those pur-
suits, by making sure bright and ea-
ger students are attracted to the uni-
versity, that an intellectually vibrant
faculty is retained for their instruc-
tion and that the facilities for the use
of both faculty and students are the
best they possibly canbe.

Our 24-hour library not only pro-
vides a means for furthering know-
ledge among students and faculty,
but is also an incredible attraction
which draws the attention of prospec-
tive students to Washington and Lee,
so that it clearly falls within the
bounds of academic pursuit.

If one were asked if tastefully done
offices, a fleet of cars not specifically
set aside for University use, a state-
of-the-art phone system and any
number of photo studios fell within
those same boundaries, one would be
hard pressed to answer in the affir-
mative.

And yet, when push comes to
shove, where does our administra-
tion look to make cuts? Something
seems to be wrong with our priorities
when administrators turn their eyes
immediately upon academic needs,
in this case our library, while at the
same time exempting themselves
from similar belt-tightening mea-
sures.

According to the Department of
Education, the costs of college
administrations nationwide increas-
ed a hundredfold between 1929 and
1973, and yet faculty pay increased
by only half that amount in the same
period. Apparently a_ disturbing
trend exists all over the country, one
that sees university administrators
placing their needs above those of
academics.

One hopes that such a trend is not
to be found at W&L, either now or in
the future, but the facts uf the matter
are very disturbing. If we, faculty,
student and administratron, will
keep in mind that academic excel-
lence is — and always should be —
our primary goal, then cost-cutting
becomes, if not easier, at least more
rational and sensible in approach,
leaving a university free to get on
with the business at hand, namely ed-
ucation.

No trespassing, please

Tothe Editors:

Fourteen months ago, I purchased
property in Rockbridge County
known variously as ‘‘Twin Falls,”’
“Cypress Falls,’’ ‘“‘The Blue Hole,”’
ete. This was the former property of
Mrs. Virginia P. Mackey.

It seems that Mrs. Mackey had al-
lowed students in the surrounding
area to swim and picnic on her pro-
perty at one time. The word then
spread and more and more people
began to appear without permission.
Due to her age, she was unable to
cope with the problem. The property
was and is well posted with ‘‘No Tres-
passing”’ signs. They have been total-
ly ignored, and at one count last sum-
mer there were 75 or more persons il-
legally onthe property at one time
during one day.

We spent last summer warning all
trespassers of the change in owner-
ship and the fact that they were tres-
passing. This year, we shall vigor-
ously enforce the ‘‘No Trespassing”’
restrictions on the property. This let-
ter is an effort to bring this notifica-
tion to the students and faculty of
Washington and Lee University. It is
not my intention to embarrass people
with an arrest, but I must do what
must be done to preserve my control

over my investment and what will
soon be my home.

So that there will be no mistake re-
garding the location of the property
described above, it is located along
South River and state Route 609. The
property encompasses over one mile
of river and road. Both sides of the
river belong to the property for al-
most the entire distance and along a
goodly part, both sides of the road
belong to the property. Access to the
river will be strictly forbidden unless
written permission is received first.
Access across the river or up to the
falls and into the interior of the pro-
perty will not be allowed under any
circumstances. The only other ac-
cess to the property is via Route 705
to the old Mackey house. Parking
along this road, around the farm
buildings and to either side of the
South River on property owned by
myself will result in the vehicles be-
ing towed away. It is my intention to
contact a towing service to handle
this job.

I hope that you will make an effort
to convey the above information to
all parties in order to avoid possible
conflict during this and subsequent
years.

STU warns students of bills

780 are
accepted

for fall

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A total of 780 men and women have
been accepted to Washington and Lee
for the Class of 1989.

The Admissions Office mailed 670
letters of acceptance on Friday. Cou-
pled with the 110 students accepted
earlier under the Early Decision pro-
gram, this brought the breakdown of
students accepted to 623 men and 157
women.

According to admissions counselor
Bennett L. Ross, the University ex-
pects about 50 percent of those ac-
cepted to enroll in the fall for a fresh-
man class of about 400. Ross said 42
percent of those who were offered ad-
mission last year enrolled in the fall.

The record 2,639 applications for
admission to W&L this year was com-
posed of 1,941 men and 698 women,
compared with last year’s 1,502 ap-
plications.

Thirty-two percent of the male ap-
plicants were offered admission.

‘‘More women really wanted Wash-
ington and Lee as a first choice,”’
Ross said. Because a higher percen-
tage of women than men are likely to
accept their admission offer, he
explained, a lower percentage were
offered admission.

Women comprised 35.5 percent of
the Early Decision acceptances but
only 17.6 percent of Friday’s accep-
tances.

Although the total number of appli-
cations increased by 75.7 percent
over last year, the number of stu-
dents accepted declined by 14 per-
cent.

According to Ross, the students
who were offered admission have
average SAT scores of 1,228 and are
in the 86th percentile of their respec-
tive high school classes. The average
SAT score of last year’s incoming
freshmen was 1,132.

The Lexington police officer who
has appealed a conviction for the as-
sault and battery of a 17-year-old has
been dismissed from the police force,

' Police Chief L.O. Sutton said.

Sgt. Richard S. Rice, 44, was dis-
missed in a letter sent by registered
mail last Wednesday. ‘‘I think the ac-
tions are legal and proper because of
the totality of the case.’’ Sutton said.

He added that Rice’s actions were
“a violation of departmental rules
and regulations.”’

“Taking any kind of disciplinary
action is never easy, but my job is to
protect the public,’’ Sutton said. ‘‘We
all have to obey laws and rules and
the police are noexception.”’

Rice no longer has any connection
with the department, according to
Sutton. ‘‘As far as I'm concerned, it’s
a moot issue,”’ he said.

In other police action last week, of-
ficers on Thursday night were called

to the Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
where an ‘‘unsanctioned party’’ was
in progress, according to Sutton.

There was ‘“‘yelling, shouting and
cursing and abuse of officers,’’ Sut-
ton said.

The president and vice-president of
Beta, George Seavy and Andrew
Cole, respectively, were issued sum-

About $1,200 worth of valuables
was taken from the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team’s locker room dur-
ing its game Sunday against Towson
State University in Towson, Md., au-

Nine players reported losing valu-
ables, including jewelry, watches
and cash, according to Sgt. Joseph

sity Police Department’s Criminal
Investigation Division.

Percentage of Applicants
Offered Admission

1975

Eighteen percent of the accepted
students are Virginia residents, and
59 percent come from public schools,
while the remaining 41 percent are
from private schools.

Ross said his ‘‘favorite”’ statistic is
that of those applicants who were in
the top 10 percent of their classes, 42
percent were denied admission.

In addition, of those applicants who
scored 600 and above on the verbal
section of the SAT, 49 percent were
rejected, while 56 percent of those
who received scores of 600 and above
on the mathsection were rejected.

Ross said the University looks for

with Seavy and was told that ‘they
will not allow their house to get out of
line like that again.”

Sutton also met this week with Del-
ta Tau Delta President Rich Gatti to

students who can ‘‘get it all togeth-

Ross, who has held his position for
two years, said the Admissions Office
faced a ‘‘mechanical’’ problem re-
sulting from the increase of more
than 1,000 applications over last
year. He said the initial shock of the
additional paperwork was handled
quite well by the Admissions Office
secretaries.

‘We have accomplished what we
set out to do,”’ said Ross, adding that
the University probably will consider
increasing its admissions staff for
next year.

The items apparently were taken

W&L lacrosse coach Dennis Daly

locker room during halftime.

“It had to be an inside job,’’ Daly
added, ‘‘because we know it was

nor’’ or ‘‘major’’ offenses:

e“Accommodation’’ or at-cost
sales of marijuana would be a minor
offense, while ‘‘sale of marijuana for
personal profit’’ would be a major of-
fense.

eA major offense would be ‘‘posses-
sion with intent to distribute, or dis-
tribution, of an illegal form of an
opiate, amphetamine, hallucinogen
or cocaine.”’

eOther minor offenses would in-
clude ‘‘conduct disruptive to the life
of the University,’’ other schools or
the community.

eOther major offenses would in-
clude threatening or inflicting death
or bodily injury, ‘‘including death or
injury resulting from driving while
intoxicated"’; vandalism of $200 or
more; ‘‘sexual assault, included un-
wanted sexual touching’; ‘‘use of
racial, ethnic or sexual slurs’’;
“preventing the beginning or com-
pletion of a public meeting’; and
theft and fraud offenses referred to
Student Control by the EC.

ePossible penalties for minor of-
fenses would include fines, social
probation, dormitory probation and
reprimands,

eAvailable sanctions for major of-
fenses would include suspension for a
defined period and expulsion.

Student Control Procedure: ‘‘This
started out as a review of the drug
policy and ended up being a review of
Student Control,’’ said Townes Pres-
sler, incoming Student Control chair-
man.

The proposal would give additional
power to the Student Control Com-
mittee and its chairman, according
to Brower, who currently holds that
office and was a member of the drug
policy committee.

Suggestions in the report include
the institution of a student adviser
system for students brought before
Student Control.

The committee recommended that
a student have ‘‘the right to refuse to
answer any questions which may
tend to be self-incriminating.”’

The report suggests that the facul-
ty resume the disciplinary authority
it had delegated to the University
Council.

Various changes in the procedure
Student Control uses in handling
cases also are recommended, includ-
ing creation of a Certification Com-
mittee to determine whether an of-
fense is major or minor.

Alcohol: Alcohol abuse is ‘‘the
most prevalent and recurrent drug

problem on this campus [and] the
most destructive of our academic
enterprise,’’ according to the report.

The committee questions why unli-
mited pitchers of beer are sold to one
or two people at a table in the Cock-
pit, why the Dining Hall is permitted
to advertise a ‘‘Hangover Special’
breakfast for the morning after Fan-
cy Dress and why cocktail parties
are ‘‘the principal means by which
the fraternities offer hospitality to
faculty.”

Although not suggesting ‘‘a policy
of prohibition,” the committee said it
recommends a position stressing
moderation and presenting ‘“‘absti-
nence as a legitimate alternative.”

Graduation Requirements: In
response to the question, ‘‘Does the
Washington and Lee degree carry a
testimony that reaches beyond aca-
demic competence? ,’’ the committee
stated that it felt it was ‘‘inappro-
priate’ to have any graduation re-
quirements beyond these two: com-
pletion of the academic requirements
and assurance that no W&L disci-
plinary proceedings are pending
against the student.

Faculty Involvement: Although
the majority of the committee re-
commended ‘‘retention of SCC as a
wholly student group with primary,
first-instance reponsibility for decid-
ing misconduct cases and imposing
penalties,’’ John, religion Professor
Louis W. Hodges and chemistry Pro-
fessor Michael A. Pleva dissented.

The three wrote in a minority re-
port that ‘‘any judicial body with full
and final authority over discipline in
major offenses should have faculty
representatives in its membership.”

They recommended creation of a
Joint Committee on Student Disci-
pline composed of six students from
Student Control and six faculty mem-
bers elected by their colleagues.

The Background: The trustees in
May directed Wilson to form an ad
hoc committee to examine W&L’s
policy on illegal drug use.

A local special grand jury had re-
commended earlier in the month that

“develop affirmative and effective’’
anti-drug guidelines for their stu-
dents.

The confusion surrounding a case
the board dealt with in May was like-
ly another impetus for its request for
the committee.

The trustees at that meeting over-
turned a faculty recommendation
and voted to deny temporarily a
degree to William L. Dederick Jr.,
who was arrested in 1983 after com-
pleting his graduation requirements.

He was convicted of three drug-re-
lated felonies and given a 12-year
suspended sentence and 10 years of
probation,

The faculty had voted to recom-
mend that Dederick receive a diplo-
ma, but the trustees postponed con-
sideration of his degree until his
court-ordered probation ends in Dec-
ember 1993.

Following the original faculty vote,
a professor had formally requested
that the matter be reconsidered after
he learned of testimony that Deder-
ick had threatened to kill a police in-
formant. The faculty voted not to
reconsider its recommendation.

In forming the committee in
September, Wilson charged it to
‘undertake a total review of our cur-
rent policies and practices bearing
upon the institution’s response to
drug offenses.”’

Other members of the committee
were accounting Professor Jay D.
Cook Jr., associate journalism Pro-
fessor Robert J. deMaria and history
Professor Robert W. McAhren.

UC examines
85 orientation

Freshman activities proposed
to occupy time before Rush

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

The University Council on Thurs-
day discussed ways of occupying
freshman free time during orienta-
tion, since the Interfraternity Council
has proposed that be a ‘‘no contact”’
period.

The proposal to delay Rush until
the end of orientation week, which
was unanimously approved by the
IFC, must still be approved by the
Student Affairs Committee.

Neither UC nor SAC voted on the
proposal at their Thursday meetings.

Geology Professor Samuel J. Ko-
zak observed that by moving the
start of Rush back to the weekend
following orientation week, the
school would be leaving freshmen
with about 15 additional hours of free
time during orientation week. Kozak
said that the school would need to
provide meaningful activities for
freshmen during this time.

Kozak said that in the past, some
people said that freshmen had too
much spare time during orientation
week. Last year when Rush had be-
gun during orientation week some of
those extra hours had been absorbed,
he explained.

English Professor Jean C. Dunbar
and Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, who heads the
Coeducation Steering Committee,
said that the committee would try to
provide SAC with examples of poten-
tial orientation week activities in
time for SAC’s meeting Thursday.

Noting that students have express-
ed a desire to have more contact with
faculty members early in their fresh-
man year, Dunbar said that one idea
the committee was considering was
to reimburse faculty members for
part of the cost of having students
visit their homes for dinner during
orientation week.

She said that such dinners had been
too much of a financial burden for
many younger faculty members. The
partial reimbursement might encou-
rage more faculty members to have
freshmen visit their homes, Dunbar
said.

‘“‘We're not going to impose this on
anyone, or make it required,’’ Dun-
bar added.

Dunbar also suggested that a bar-
becue could be held, there could be a
reception for freshmen, and movies

goals of orientation week activities
should be developing class unity and
making the week seem like a regular
week of school.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John re-
ported that the Alumni Association
also had expressed interest in spon-
soring a barbecue during orientation
week.

Simpson said that a series of events
concerning the history of women at
W&L and in the South were also being
planned for the weekend of Sept.
13-15.

Some of the events included in the
program will be a display on the his-
tory of Washington and Lee and an
all-day symposium Sept. 14 on the
history of women in the South, which
will feature two nationally known
women scholars.

Both UC members and members of
the coed committee seemed to be
generally pleased with the IFC’s
overall Rush proposal.

John said that it was important to
note that the IFC had voted to allow
Washington and Lee women to attend
most Rush functions.

Simpson concurred that it would
have been bad to exclude women
from all Rush functions.

Simpson said Tuesday that al-
though not all the members of the
coed committee were completely sat-
isfied with the shape of Rush, the IFC
had done a good job in taking into ac-
count that W&L will be coed next
year.

“They were very sympathetic and
sensitive to the fact that there will be
women on campus next year,”’ Simp-
son said. “I think the IFC did a very
good job of listening.

Regarding the exhibits on women
at W&L to be presented next Sep-
tember, Simpson said there are
many women who made significant
contributions toW&L.

Annie Jo White, who created Fancy
Dress, and a local chapter of the
United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy, which successfully fought a pro-
posal in the 1920s to completely en-
case Lee Chapel in a larger building,
were just two of the examples Simp-
son listed of women who have made
significant contributions toW&L.

Simpson added that the exhibit on
women at W&L had been planned for
a long time and was not solely intend-
ed to complement the arrival of wo-
men next year.

EC to question cold check chairman;
Political Review appointment appealed

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL

 

Staff Reporter

Personnel matters dominated
Monday night’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

EC Secretary Sam Dalton voiced a
complaint concerning Student Finan-
cial Relations Committee Chairman
Henry Exall. Dalton charged Exall
with increased negligence in regard
to his duties as head of the SFRC, or
cold check committee, as it is com-
monly called.

B. Scott Tilley, editor of the Wash-
ington and Lee Political Review, pre-
sented a letter asking the EC to over-
turn the Publications Board’s choice
of Christopher Lion as next year’s
editor of the Political Review.

all stemmed from a phone call from
Lloyd's of Lexington to Carole Chap-
pell concerning bounced checks that
had not been picked up.

“Carole was being insulted by
Lloyd Smith,’’ Dalton said. ‘‘Henry
has been rude to her too, and I think
we should reconsider his appoint-
ment.”’

Dalton said that Chappell has been
receiving phone calls all year from
local businesses complaining that
bounced checks were not being pick-
ed up. Dalton said most of the bounc-
ed checks come from Lloyd's.

“There have just been too many
problems,”’ Dalton said. ‘‘Carole and
Henry haven’t worked well together
all year. Either he’s going to have to
change or we're going to have to ap-
point someone else.”’

Exall will defend himself at the
next EC meeting, April 22.

Last week, Exall appeared before
the EC in regard to a $73 bounced
check that the cold check committee
had written to the Palms to cover a
previous check bounced by a W&L

student.

In response to Dalton’s accusa-
tions, Exall said, ‘‘I don’t think that
replacement is warranted. There are
some communication problems be-
tween Carole and I, though, and I feel
that they can, and will, be worked out
before the meeting.”

Tilley’s letter to the EC claimed
that the Publications Board had ‘‘be-
trayed’’ his trust in choosing an edi-
tor ‘“‘whom it feels will do the best job
and uphold the standard of excel-
lence.”’

The Pub Board chose Lion over
Nelson Patterson by a 5-1 vote last
Thursday. Tilley’s was the only vote
in favor of Patterson.

Although Tilley claimed in the let-
ter that he felt Lion ‘‘is capable of do-
ing the job,” he still felt that the Pub
Board’s decision was ‘“‘highly irre-
sponsible.’’

‘*My feelings are more that the de-
cision be made on different consider-
ations, I think experience should be
considered over personality,’’ Tilley
said.

Tilley noted that Lion’s experience
with the Pub Board consisted of his
submitting one article, which is inthe
issue currently at press. Patterson,
on the other hand, served as assistant
editor this year.

David Sprunt, editor of the Calyx

and co-chairman of the Pub Board,
Said the decision was made on the
basis of an interview and an applica-
tion. Sprunt said that Patterson had

not given any indication that he want- °

ed the job in the interview and that
Lion presented himself much better.

Patterson’s initial application
consisted of his name, his address
and the job for which he was apply-
ing. Lion’s application, Sprunt said,
was much more extensive.

“It wasn’t an easy decision to
make, but we are happy with it,”
Sprunt said.

Mike Allen, a chief editor of The
Ring-tum Phi and also a member of
the Pub Board, said. ‘‘that the Pub
Board has made a mistake.”

The Pub Board had scheduled a
meeting this afternoon to attempt to
settle the matter outside the EC.

Bruce Potter, also co-chairman of
the Puh Roard said he hanes to pre
sent the possibility of a dual editor-
ship between Lion and Patterson.

“T think that will be a good way to
solve a tough, badly handled pro-
blem,”’ Allen said.

Sprunt said Tilley was not justified
in bringing his complaint to the EC.

‘I think the decisions made by the
Pub Board should be upheld,’’ Sprunt
said. ‘‘There was a vote taken and
it’s unfair to Chris Lion for us to go
back on our decision.”’

‘‘We really dropped the ball,’’ Al-
len said. ‘‘This is a painful, stupid sit-
uation to be in because Nelson and
Chris could both be great editors. I
hope the co-editor plan will pass and
both of them will be willing to accept
the job in spite of our screw-up.”’

Appointments made
to W&L publications

The University Publications Board
last week appointed juniors Mike
Allen, Paul Foutch and Cotton Pur-
year as the three top editors of next
year’s Ring-tum Phi, and junior Jeff
Kimbell was named business man-
ager.

Other positions filled by the Publi-
cations Board last week were Ariel
editor, junior Bob Strickland; Calyx
business manager, junior Watson
Barnes; and Political Review editor,
junior Chris Lion. The Political
Review decision has been appealed
to the Executive Committee.

No applications for Calyx editor
were received. The Board said it
hopes to fill that position during
spring term.

The Publications Board is compos-
ed of the editors and business man-
agers of the four publications.

The Phi appointees announced that
next year they plan to expand the
newspaper to two sections — a broad-
sheet section and a tabloid sports and
entertainment supplement.

‘I look forward as always to hear-
ing from readers about how we can
make their paper more interesting
and helpful,’’ said Allen, who will
hold the position of Executive Editor
and, will have overall responsibility
for the newspaper.

Foutch and Puryear will each have

Paper cites
press's effect
on politics

Despite the increasing omni-
presence of television as a source for
political news, newspapers continue
to play a more important role in the
United States’ political system, ac-
cording to associate professor of
journalism Hampden H. Smith III.

In a paper presented last weekend
at the Southeastern Regional Spring
Convention of the American Associa-
tion for Education in Journalism and
Mass Communications, Smith cited
data that indicate that ‘‘newspaper
readership is a major determinant of
political knowledge and activity...”

Further, he said the data show that
the strong relationship between
newspaper readership and political
knowledge has remained constant
over time, indicating the relationship
is not simply the result of other, tem-
porary forces.

In his paper, Smith used figures
from the 1972, 1976 and 1980 elections
to show positive, and usually sub-
stantial, correlations between news-
paper readership and three gauges of
political knowledge and activity he

developed. Those three gauges mea-

sure supportive attitudes concerning
voting, campaign activity level and a
sense of personal political efficacy.

For several decades, researchers
have found that the people who are
most active in politics tend to be well-
educated, be at least middle class
and have higher incomes. Smith’s
study indicates that mewspaper
readership should be added to educa-
tion, class and income as a major
determinant of political activity.

In addition, he compared people
with the same educational and in-
come levels and found that news-
paper readership continued to be
closely related to political activity.

 

12-12-6

Wa&L calendar is not alone

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

What does Washington and Lee
have in common with Cazenovia
College, Rhodes College and El-
mira College?

Those four schools, along with
about 13 others, have a short
spring semester built into their
academic calendars.

Washington and Lee has what is
commonly called a ‘‘12-12-6’’ aca-
demic calendar — two 12-week se-
mesters followed by a six-week se-
mester during the spring.

According to a publication by
the National Association of Col-
lege Stores, ‘‘List of School Open-
ing and Other Dates,” 17 schools
in addition to Washington and Lee
have a short term during the
spring.

Using the same publication, Or-
ville Walz, president of Concordia
College in Edmonton, Alberta, de-
veloped a study that showed that
about two-thirds of U.S. colleges,
or 1,800, operate under the ‘early
semester’ academic calendar.
Schools using this calendar begin
classes in August, and the first
semester ends before Christmas.
The second semester ends some-

time in May.

Walz also found that:

eThe number of schools with
“traditional semesters’? — in

which the first semester doesn’t

- end until after Christmas — has
declined from 895 in 1970-71 to 114
this year.

eIn 1970-71, 539 schools used the
quarter system — three 10- to 12-
week semesters. That number in-
creased to 751 this year.

eA total of 75 schools, the same
number as in 1970-71, use the tri-
mester system — a year-round
calendar of three semesters.

eThe 4-1-4 calendar — two nor-
mal semesters with a short, usual-
ly month-long semester in Jan-
uary or February — is used by 255
schools, compared with 186
schools in 1970-71.

Washington and Lee’s calendar
was lumped into a sixth category
called ‘‘other’’ with 107 schools, or
about 4 percent. These included
the schools with calendars similar
to W&L’s, a number of schools for
which information was not avail-
able and schools with other types
of calendars.

For example, one school in this
category, Cornell College in Mt.
Vernon, Iowa, has nine 312-week
terms, with a four-day weekend
between each term. Each student
takes one course a term. A spokes-
person for the school said that
Cornell College and Colorado Col-
lege in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
are the only schools with such
calendars.

Many of the 17 schools that have
spring semesiers have a four-
week semester in the spring,
rather than W&L’s six weeks.

At least one school that has a

 

six-week spring semester is think-
ing about changing its calendar.
Rhodes College in Memphis,
Tenn. (formerly Southwestern of
Memphis), has a six-week semes-
ter from April 15 to May 24, ac-
cording to Helen Norman, assis-
tant to the president for public in-
formation.

“It’s supposed to be for more
creative sorts of endeavors,”’ said
Norman, who added that travel
abroad programs and internships
are offered during the short se-
mester.

Despite the advantages, “there
are and have been problems with
it,” Norman said. Among these,
she added, are that classes that
are supposed to be small actually
have large numbers of students.
In addition, ‘‘it’s a difficult term |,
system to organize in terms of fac-
ulty and scheduling and that sort
of thing,”’ she said.

“It’s just kind of an administra-
tive nightmare, I think.”

Although the students are op- |*
posed to any change in the calen-
dar and_ successfully lobbied
against a change a few years ago,
the faculty does seem to favora |,
change, Norman said.

A committee studying ways to
enhance the academic program |, y
recommended changing the cal-
endar because it ‘“‘thinks the quali-
ty of the educational program |+« ,
could be improved by getting
away from that,’’ Norman added.

An ad hoc faculty committee at
W&L studied the possibility last |- 4
year of changing the calendar, but
the faculty voted in the fall to re-
tain the 12-12-6 calendar. Still be- |j* *
ing studied is a calendar that
would divide the year into five six-
week semesters. mi

Other colleges may be turning |< | +
away from the short semester at
the end of the school year, Walz
said, because ‘‘once the two se- |« | +

“In calendars, what are the ad-

ued. ‘‘The curriculum should de-

A group of Washington and Lee
students and faculty members par-
ticipated in a conference Saturday on
black-white relations at predomi-
nantly white school.

The 13 students — three of whom
are white — and four faculty mem-
bers attended movies and discuss-
ions about problems minorities have
on campus, interracial teaching
effectiveness, and strategies for
increasing interracial participation
in University activities,

Students and faculty members
from other area schools attended the
annual conference at the University

Billy Rhinehart, treasurer for the
Student Association for Black Unity,
said he got a lot out of the conference.

“I got a lot of frustrations out,”
Rhinehart said. ‘‘It helped me just to
deal with [the problems]. I know
there are a lot of problems... You just
have to try to get what you can out of
the whole W&L experience and just
try tohelp make the minority agenda
a student body issue.”

SCC: ‘more respect’

From Staff Reports

 

Junior Townes Pressler, who last
month was elected president of the
Class of 1986 for the fourth straight
time, says that when he was deciding
whether to run for student body pres-
ident or senior class president, it
really came down to a choice be-
tween ‘‘my resume and where I knew
I should be.”’

There aren’t many people who
would choose the second option.

Pressler did.

He said the agonizing decision of
whether to run for student body pres-
ident, which heads the Executive
Committee, or senior class president,
which chairs the Student Control
Committee, was really a matter of
choosing ‘‘between myself and the
school.”’

“It was really kind of distressing to
me — I didn’t know what to do,”’ he
recalls.

Pressler said one consideration
was the recognition and trappings

A year

that accompany the student body
presidency that just don’t go with
senior class president.

“That's one thing that weighed on
my mind — the prestige,’’ he said. “‘I
knew it would help me later on. But
school is the best years of your life.
You can’t let something like that in-
fluence what you do.”’

Pressler said that although the
more prestigious office looked tempt-
ing at first, “‘I was not interested in
[EC] and I never have been.”’

The other people running this year
“were perfectly capable of being EC
president, and by running, I would
just have been splitting up the vote
even more,’’ Pressler explained.
“We're alla lot alike and have a lot of
the same ideas.”’

He said his final decision was bas-
ed on the fact that ‘‘Student Control
will have a lot more responsibility
next year’’ because of a number of
recommendations by the Drug Policy
Review Committee. (See story, page
‘

Darby Brower, the current senior

late

class president and a member of the
drug policy committee, said that
group’s proposal makes it critical to
have someone of Pressler’s ability
and reputation at the Student Control
helm.

“Townes and I talked about it a
lot,’’ Brower said of the choice be-
tween the two offices. ‘I think a lot of
that decision came from the fact that
the committee will have more re-
sponsibility next year.’

‘Townes has always been a source
of good judgment with respect to past
cases,”’ he continued. ‘‘Among other
people, he is well-spoken, and people
very much respect his word.’’

“He has a good deal of control and
is rational in his thinking,’’ he added.

“The only way the changes are go-
ing to stick is if the committee con-
tinues to bring out responsible con-
clusions to the cases they hear,”
Brower said.

Pressler, who has served on Stu-
dent Control for three years and act-
ed as its chairman for three months
last year, said his goal is to continue

   

 

TOWNES PRESSLER

the trend toward more respect for the
committee that has begun under
Brower’s leadership.

“‘We’ve handed out some pretty
stiff penalties, and now I think people
will think twice about doing some of
these things,” Pressler said.

“It’s going to be a whole new crew
next year,’’ he added, noting that he
is the only returning member of next
year’s Student Control. ‘‘With my ex-
perience, people will see that Student
Control is not just made up of popular
class officers — it’s made up of ser-
ious people.”’

Senior turns tables as write-in vote leads to UC post

 

By PAULFOUTCH
News Editor

 

Talk about irony — this beats all.

Last year David Sprunt was a can-
didate for senior representative to
the University Council. He was one of
only two candidates running for three
spots, but he still managed to lose the
election.

This year he wasn’t even on the
ballot, and he ended up winning.

The explanation of this curious
turn of events involves a student gov-
ernment election system that Sprunt
says needs revision.

“It’s really kind of a screwy sys-
tem that they have,” he said.

The story begins in the spring of
last year:

eAs a junior, Sprunt decides he will
be able to fit work on the UC, a stu-
dent-faculty-administration advisory
committee, into an extracurricular
schedule that will include the editor-
ship of the Calyx. He turns in a peti-
tion with 50 signatures to the Voting
Regulations Board and is placed on
the ballot with Harry Golliday.

eIn the election Golliday gets 52
votes and Sprunt gets 34, beating out
two write-in candidates, Bill Joel and
Andy Haring. Interpreting the Stu-
dent Body constitution, the Execu-
tive Committee decides that since no
candidate received a majority, a run-
off will be held among the top four

vote-getters — meaning the election
will be held again, but with the write-
in candidates on the ballot.

“The whole section on ballots in the
Student Body constitution is very am-
biguous,”’ Sprunt said.

“It doesn’t address the problem of
a three-position race. The EC didn’t
know how tointerpret it.”’

The constitution says that if no can-
didate receives a majority in a two-
position race, a runoff will be held
among the top four vote-getters.
There is no mention of a three-posi-
tion race.

“It doesn’t say anything about the
senior University Council elections,”
Sprunt said.

eIn the runoff, Golliday and Haring
win. Sprunt beats Joel, 34-33, but then
finds out that a senior friend of his
voted for him. He informs the EC
that the election must be a tie, since
seniors aren’t allowed to vote.

“What price honor?’’ Sprunt ask-
ed.

eIn the final election to resolve the
tie, Joel beats Sprunt.

So from running practically unop-
posed, he ended up losing.

This year a similar situation arose,
with Sprunt on the other side. Again
there were only two candidates —
McGowan Patrick and Andrew Wein-
berg — in the March 25 election for
the three senior UC spots.

Sprunt explained that Andrew Ca-
ruthers, next year’s EC vice presi-

 

DAVID SPRUNT

dent, was manning the poll near the
Commerce School when Sprunt walk-
edby.

‘He said, ‘Why don’t you vote for
yourself. Write yourself in.’ I voted
for myself and that was it.”’

He put a note on his ballot saying
he was a returning senior and would
like to be considered for a position.

That one vote enabled..Sprunt to
make the runoff, along with two other
write-in candidates — Lou Mondello
and Tom Spilsbury.

Sprunt won a UC position in the
runoff, coming in third place with 80
votes, six ahead of Spilsbury.

“T didn’t ask anybody to vote for
me at all,” Sprunt said. “I didn’t

think I could win.”

“‘T got more votes this year than I
got last year.”

He puts most of the blame for that
situation on apathetic voters.

“I don’t know if it would be right to
say it’s a popularity contest, but it’s
name recognition more than any-
thing,” he said.

As for how to correct the situation
that led to his defeat last year: ‘‘I
think the person who got his petition
in should win if he gets the most votes
the first time,” he said.

That would mean amending the
constitution.

“‘The student body constitution has
some unnecessary stuff. There’s a
whole section in there about a student
body teasurer, and there hasn’t been
a student body treasurer since 1972,”
he said.

VRB chairman David Hanna
agreed with Sprunt that candidates
who turn in their petitions should not
be penalized by having to run against
write-in candidates on a second bal-
lot.

“On the other hand, the voter
should have the option of voting for
whomever he wants,”’ Hanna said.
“They shouldn’t be limited.”’

Sprunt said he hopes his write-in
victory didn’t defeat a candidate who
turned his petition in on time.

He didn’t. The two original candi-
dates won. So did Sprunt — a year
late.

Chinese scholar calls for educational diversity

 

By PAULSMITH
Staff Reporter

 

The present reforms in Chinese
education are ‘responses to the
changes in China’s economic policy,”’
the president of one of China’s lar-
gest universities said Friday.

Dr. Xie Xide, professor of physics
and president of Fudan University in
Shanghai and a member of the Cen-.
tral Committee of the Chinese Com-
munist party, spoke at W&L under
the sponsorship of W&L’s East Asian
Studies Program.

Changes in the Chinese economy,
according to Dr. Xie, include the re-
instatement of a market economy in
the rural districts, relaxation of the
state’s control of businesses and en-
terprises and changes in the wage al-
location system.

“We are trying to encourage the
diligent and hard working people,”’

she said, noting that many of the
reforms are aimed at eliminating
complacency among the workers and
reinstating competition.

“There is a tendency after the
period of turmoil, that people don’t
work anymore,”’ she contended. ‘‘We
are moving away from the idea of
‘eating from the samerice pot.’ ”’

‘“‘We must relax the state control of
enterprises,’’ she urged, comparing
political managers to ‘‘mothers-in-
law,”’ an analogy that brought laugh-
ter from the audience.

Education’s response, according to
Dr. Xie, is to provide a better balance
in academic subjects, a variety of ed-
ucational subjects to a greater part
of tbe population and more freedom
from governmental interference of
both educators and students.

Dr. Xie stressed the theme of di-
versity in education. ‘‘We do not have
enough students in social sciences,”
she said. ‘‘These are the fields that
we muststress in the future.”’

IFC poll says upperclassmen
narrowly support early Rush

 

From Staff Reports

 

Interfraternity Council members
last week were given the results of a
poll that shows fraternity members
are ‘barely in favor of keeping Rush
as it is now’’ when offered the choice
of the current calendar or a deferred
Rush.

That’s the analysis of Lee Hollis,
chairman of the Fraternity Affairs
Subcommittee of the Coeducation
Steering Committee. The unscientific
survey of 280 fraternity members
and 75 independents was conducted
during spring term registration by
the coed committee and the IFC.

Hollis told the IFC members that
the poll was “really not that big of a
sample,” so the results should be
interpreted cautiously.

Incoming IFC President Jaimie
Hayne joined Hollis in his skep-
ticism.

“That poll, to me, is not really va-
lid because of the amount of people
responding,”’ Hayne said. ‘‘I think
everyone was in a hurry when they
filled it out and didn’t really think
about the consequences of their
answers.” :

“I think a lot of people are for a
deferred Rush in theory but in practi-
eality here at W&L it wouldn’t

work,”’ he added.

Hollis said administrators had
noted that the poll showed 12 percent
of the 120 freshmen responding said
they would have made a different de-
cision if they had more time, and 31
percent said they might have. Of the
30 independent freshmen responding,
30 percent said they would have
decided differently and 33 percent
said they might have.

Next year’s Interfraternity

She cited many statistics that
showed engineering and the physical
sciences as the major fields taught in
the Chinese curriculum since the
Communist revolution of 1949. More-
over, since the ‘cultural revolution,’
physical sciences have continued to
be emphasized, although alongside a
renewed interest in the natural
sciences.

She also expressed a great desire
to see law and politics return as a
major field of study. ‘‘We do not have
enough scholars in politics and law,”
she noted. ‘‘I have deep respect for
lawyers in this country.”’

She attributed much of China’s po-
litical turmoil to the lack of scholars
in law and politics. She also would
like to see more scholars in the fields
of economics, agriculture and jour-
nalism,

In terms of journalism, ‘‘We would
like more cooperation with you in de-
veloping these courses,’ she said,
referring to the possibility of an ex-

change between Fudan and W&L.

‘‘We would like to revise our curri-
culum...so that it is a more basic cur-
riculum,”’ she added. ‘‘For example,
less compulsory courses, more elec-
tive courses and more flexibility.”

In response to a question dealing
with her views on the present objec-
tives of the Chinese Communist Par-
ty as opposed to the party objectives
of the revolutionary era (1949), Dr.
Xie agreed that the party is trying to
stress incentive, competition and
material advancement, as opposed to
the revolutionary objectives of egali-
tarianism and class elimination.

Concerning Sino-Soviet relations,
she affirmed her wish for “improv-
ed’’ relations with Moscow. How-
ever, the continued Soviet military
presence in Cambodia and Afganis-
tan, as well as the stationing of Soviet
troops along China’s borders, contin-
ues to complicate relations between
the two countries.

Skipping Goshen
for the Galapagos

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

While the majority of Washington
and Lee students are slaving away in
the coming six weeks, deeply involv-
ed in spring term courses and taking
time out for an occasional trip to
Goshen Pass, a group of eight W&L
biology students and two professors
will be on a different kind of trip, a
field trip to the Galapagos Islands.

For four weeks in April and May,
biology Professor Cleveland P. Hick-
man Jr. and assistant Professor
Peter W. Bergstrom will lead the stu-
dent expedition to the Galapagos, a
Pacific island group about 600 miles
west of Ecuador.

The trip, the biology department’s
sixth to the Galapagos, is organized
as Biology 216, Supervised Field
Study, a six-credit course during
which the students study the plant
and animal life of the islands and the
biology of a tropical forest on the
Ecuadorian mainland. After their
field work, the group will return to
W&L, where the students must write
two essays in order to complete the
course.

Hickman, leader of the previous
five trips, outlined the itinerary of
this spring’s excursion. After a week
of orientation on South America — in-
cluding lectures about its economy,
culture and other topics — the group
will leave for Miami on April 29.

From Miami, the group will fly to
Guayaquil, Ecuador, and then on to
the Galapagos Islands. There they
will board a 60-foot ship that will
serve as their home base while they
tour the islands. From the ship, the
group will make daily excursions on-
to land to do their research, including
a hike to the top of Volcan Alcedo, a
volcano, Hickman said that as many
as 4,000 giant Galapagos tortoises
live inside the caldera of the volcano.

While these tortoises may be the
best-known of the Galapagos’ animal
inhabitants, they certainly are not
the most exotic. Hickman said there
are many species of plants, animals
and birds on the islands that are
found nowhere else. He added that
there are also many types of life that
are absent from the Galapagos.

The Galapagos are a unique biolog-
ical showcase, Hickman said, and
they are only two million years old,
relatively young in geological terms.

In addition to the islands’ relative
youth, their inaccessible location led
to “erratic colonization,’’ Hickman
said. Animals had difficulty getting
to the islands, which are volcanic in
origin, and many types of animals
never have been observed in the Gal
apagos. There are no amphibians or
freshwater fish, Hickman said, and
few mammals. Also, many plant
groups are not represented on the
islands.

Reconstructing the evolution of the
islands is fairly easy, Hickman said
There has not been much time for the
animals to change or to develop fear,
and because the Galapagos devel-
oped without predators, the animals
are tame. This allows the students to
study the animals freely, Hickman
said, and also provides good photo-
graphic opportunities.

The Galapagos recently have had
some problems, Hickman said, not
ing that about 50,000 acres of Isabela
Island have been destroyed by fires
in the past few weeks.

“‘We’re worried about Isabela,’
said Hickman, adding that there is
some concern about the group being
permitted on the island while the
fires are burning. Isabela is the loca-
tion of the volcano the group plans to
climb.

This time of year is usually the
rainy season, Hickman said, recall-
ing that the last trip W&L students
made to the islands was almost rain-
ed out by bad storms. When there are
extreme weather conditions, Hick-
man said, the biology of the islands
can become endangered. The rains
two years ago diluted the sea water
and threatened the sea life, he said,
and the drought the area currently is
experiencing is detrimental to the
life on this island.

Only 10 percent of the Galapagos
Islands are inhabited, Hickman said.
The remainder of the land is protect-
ed by the Ecuadorian national park
system. There is ‘‘nothing you'd call
a city,’’ he said. Instead, the island
has two small towns, and the
tion of the islands is about 6,000

While most of the time will be
taken up with researching and study-
ing the life on the Galapagos, Hick-
man said there is time for the stu-
dents to enjoy some of the more tra-
ditional aspects of spring term, such
as swimming and snorkling. One stu-
dent even plans to scuba dive, he add-
ed.

Campaign against apartheid
to include movies, speaker

 

From Staff Reports

 

A group of Washington and Lee
students and faculty began its cam-
paign last night to ask the Board of
Trustees to consider action to protest
apartheid in South Africa.

Members of the audience at two
movies shown by the Washington and
Lee Campaign Against Apartheid
were asked to sign a resolution call-
ing on the trustees to consider appro-
priate action the University could
take.

Such action could include having
the University’s financial portfolios
examined to determine if the Univer-
sity invests in any companies doing
business in South Africa, according
to one of the organizers, law Profes-
sor William S. Geimer. If so, the Uni-
versity could stop its investments in
that company, he added.

“If you’re in South Africa doing
business, you’re supporting apart-
heid,”’ Geimer said. ‘‘The issue is not
whether a black in South Africa is
making the same amount of money
per hour as a black in Zimbabwe. The
issue is, ‘When are they going to have
control over their own lives?’ ’’

The group originally had planned

it possible for more work to be done
with the same number of people.”
How soon such automation will be us-
ed at W&L, though, ‘‘is hard to tell,”
she added.

Brown said she was interested in
coming back to Washington and Lee
because she likes the school. “I like
its size; I like where it’s located; I
like the interdepartmental relation-
ships that there are among the facul-
ty,’’ she added.

The decision by the University to
become coeducational at the under-
graduate level also pleased her. ‘‘I

was delighted,’ she added. “I think
that it was a great decision to make.”’
Brown said the question of whether
the library should remain open 24
hours a day was discussed during her
February visit to campus, but she
refrained from expressing an opinion
on the issue. ‘“‘I’d have to know more
information,” she said. ‘‘I’d like to
know what resources they’re using
{at night] and whether they’re using
library materials or just studying.”’

Brown was born in Charles City,
Iowa, and graduated from Iowa State

University in 1963. In 1964, she
received her master’s degree from
Columbia University.

She worked as a librarian at Cor-
nell University for seven years
before coming to W&L in 1971.

In 1976, Brown left W&L to become
assistant university librarian for

  
  

General Reader Services at Prince-
ton University. In 1980, she took her
current position with Research
Libraries Group, a consortium of 30
large research libraries working
together to solve problems faced by
larger libraries.

Brown has written several papers
for library publications and is a
member of the American Library As-
sociation and the Association of Col-
lege and Research Libraries.

to ask the school to halt purchases of
IBM products, but later learned that
IBM has ceased sales to the South
African police and military.

Last night’s movies, Geimer saiq,
were designed to ‘‘give a flavor of
apartheid in action. They show
everyday life in South Africa."’

The group plans to show four more
movies during April — ‘Six Days in
Soweto’’ and “Discarded People’’
next Thursday at 7:30 in the Law
School and ‘Generations of Resis-
tance’’ and ‘‘South Africa Belongs to
Us” April 25 at 7:30 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium.

In addition, Law School Dean Fred-
eric L. Kirgis Jr. will speak on
“South Africa: Human Rights, Inter-
national Law,” April 23 at 7.30 p.m.
in the Law School.

Other plans include showin’ video
tapes of ABC News’ Nightline, ....icu

ca, according to Susan Stull, docu
ments technician in the Law
library.

In addition to attempting to plave
the issue on the Board of Trustee
agenda, another goal of the cam
paign is to bring the matter to the
attention of students, Geimer said.

magic words for you: point shaving, and I’m not talking Norelco.

Just look at the benefits (Yes, these prices are INNN-SANE!):
Games will not only feature competition between different teams but
conceivably also between different players on the same team. Can you
see a team trying to run a four corners when two guys have money
wagered on their opponents? Also, just think of the increases in TV
revenues as more and more housewives become college basketball
fans. (“This is more fun than the state lottery,’’ says Miss Sophie

They’ll get to experience life in much the same manner as it will be
after they graduate magna cum prima donna from Bookie U. Hey, if
they fix games in the ‘‘amateur’’ (cough) game, is it much of a jump to
say they might do it in the big leagues, too? (A season of 82 games is
going to need some type of excitement every now and then.) It’s kind
of an internship program. And they’ve got a shot clock. Can 20-second
timeouts, no zone defenses and Dancing Harry be far behind?

Point shaving adds a whole new dimension to the college game. Box
scores won’t give individual point totals any more, but how many
points under his average Joe Cash ‘N Carry is and whether the Green

for the score and foul situations, now will include flashing pari-mutuel

Slump, controversy surround baseball

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team dropped its record to 3-11 yes-
terday after losing 14-9 to Hampden-
Sydney in Lexington.

W&L head coach Jim Murdock
started freshmen Michael Suttle,
Alex Sutton and Carnpent Clement in
place of regulars Billy White, Milam
Turner and Chuck Nelson against the
Tigers. Freshman Kevin Topping
started at catcher for Mike Jacoby.
Murdock’s ploy failed as H-S jumped
out to an 11-2 lead before holding off a
late General rally.

The problems in the game went be-
yond the score. Generals starting pit-
cher Kirk Breen and Murdock ex-
changed words after the second in-
ning, eventually leading to Breen’s
being benched. The junior left the
field during the fifthinning.

“T thought Kirk was cooling off
{after being removed from the
game], and then I looked up and saw
him driving off,’’ Murdock said. He
said that Breen’s status with the
team is uncertain.

Breen could not be reached for
comment last night.

The game got off to a pleasant
start, however. W&L took an early
1-0 lead, only to see H-SC score three

runs in the top of the second off
Breen.

“T started the freshmen to add
some variety, some change,’ Mur-
dock said. ‘‘We’ve been losing any-
how, and I decided to give them a
chance. We've got to be thinking
about next year, even though we
haven't given upon this year yet.”

Freshman Eric Acra_ relieved
Breen in the third inning, and W&L
cut the score to 3-2 after Sutton and
Don Thayer led off with walks and
advanced a base after Clement
reached on an error. Suttle grounded
out, scoring Sutton to make the score
3-2.

The Tigers exploded for six runs in
the fifth, chasing Acra and forcing
Murdock to send freshman Carter
Steuart to the mound. H-SC stretched
its lead to 11-2 in the sixth when a
Tiger runner scored from second ona
passed ball and another scored from
third on another passed ball.

W&L first baseman Bill Schoettel-
kotte singled with one out in the sixth
and scored on Ricky Zahn’s triple.
Turner singled to score Zahn to bring
the score to 11-4.

H-SC struck back in the seventh,
scoring twice, only to see the Gen-
erals answer with four runs of their
own in the bottom of the inning. Nel-
son led off with a walk and scored on
White's triple. Tom Mack followed

Dr. James W. Worth, coach of the
W&L Fencing Club, placed third in
men’s foil in the U.S. Fencing Assoc-
iation 1985 State Championship Na-
tional Qualifiers last weekend.

The field of 22 fencers at Randolph-
Macon Woman's College competing
in various age levels included the
William and Mary fencing coach and
some of the top club fencers in the
state. The finish qualifies Worth for
competition both at the sectional
meet in May in Pittsburgh and at the

national meetin Cleveland.

It was the third official foil and on-
ly the second ‘‘electrical foil’’ com-
petition for Worth, who until last year
primarily used the saber. (It is called
electric because of the scoring device
used to judge the bout.) Although the
saber and foil fighters score points or
“touches”’ for different targets — for
foil the torso and for saber strikes
above the waist — according to
Worth, ‘‘The footwork, timing, speed
and strategy are complementary.”

‘You don’t need brute strength to
fence,’ he added, ‘‘but conditioning
can make the difference.’’ Worth has

The Washington and Lee track
team captured four second places at
Mary Washington College’s Battle-
field Relays last weekend.

At Friday’s field events, Mike
McAlevey and John Carder were run-
ners-up in their events. McAlevey
threw the javelin 178’ 6’, while
Carder pole vaulted 12’.

Saturday’s track events saw fresh-
man Andy White take second place in
the 110-meter hurdles with a time of
15.3. The W&L sprint relay team of

‘Chris Ives, John White, Chris Bleggi
and Mark Pembroke finished second
behind Frostburg State. The team’s
finishing time was 3:31.2.

The sprint relay consists of four
legs at three different distances. The

head and controlling the game. All
was quiet until junior attackman
Todd Breithaupt decided to stir
things up. Breithaupt made things
closer with his first goal of the
season.

The first period was important in
the Generals’ development this sea-
son, They proved they could come
back. W&L did come back against
Maryland on March 16, but this was
the first time in '85 that the Generals
were able to come back to prevent an
early blowout.

Daly said the Generals were’ “‘out-
played” in the second period, but
they weren’t outscored. With 6:48 left
in the half the Tigers’ Mullins scored
for the second time in the game, this
time ona clear, making the score 5-3,

The Generals needed goals, and
they soon got what they needed. With
1:06 left in the half, Deringer took ad-
vantage of a man-up situation to
score his second of the day and cut
the margin to one goal. Then Rod
Santomassimo opened the field up on
a breakaway and found Deringer for
the hat trick to tie the game up at the
half as the teams went to the locker
rooms at the intermission.

runs 400 meters and the anchor
(Pembroke) runs 800 meters.

Although team scores are not kept
at invitational meets, head track
coach Norris Aldridge maintains that
there is still team identity. ‘But you
concentrate on your own event,’’ he
added. Coach Aldridge continued:
‘‘We compete as a team but are pri-
marily concerned with bringing our
individual times down.”

He added that his teams usually
face very tough competition at invi-
tational meets. Aldridge concluded
that the work on individual times and
competition against tougher oppo-
nents prepares the Generals to de-
fend their crown at the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference outdoor
championships.

On April 20, the Generals will tra-
vel to Greenville, S.C., to compete in
the Furman Invitational. On April 27,
the Generals will host the ODAC out-
door championships at Wilson Field

When the teams headed back to the
field for the second half, nothing had
changed: There was still mist, mud
and cold. But with 12.47 left in the
third period, the score did change.

Junior attackman Bill Holmes
teamed up with Deringer to get his
first score of the game and give W&L
the lead. Towson, after a 3-0. dry
spell, figured a reply was in order.
Three minutes later, Winkoff came
from behind the goal to get his second
score and tie the gameatsix.

Things began looking much like the
first period again when Conley took
advantage of a man-up and scored
unassisted with 9:14 left in the
quarter. But that lead didn’t last, as
Deringer got his fourth on a return-
the-favor assist from Holmes.

The seesaw battle continued when
the Tigers capitalized on another
man-up situation. Mike Policastre
gave Towson the lead at 8-7,

The fourth period saw the tension
mount when Conley added his second
goal of the game to give the Tigers a
two-goal lead with 11:44 lefttoplay.

Sandy Brown then cut the lead to
one with an unassisted goal. With
1:03 left, W&L got the break it was

looking for — another man-up situa-
tion. But the Generals did not score
with the man advantage, and the
game ended at9-8.

Assistant coach Sam Carpenter de-
scribed his feelings with a movie
reference. ‘‘You know how [Chief]
Inspector {Dreyfuss} gets that ner-
vous twitch around Clousseau in Pink
Panther movies? That’s how I get
when people mention Towson State.”’

The Generals did have some fine
individual performances, however.
Goalie John DiDuro had 16 saves de-
spite the funny bounces in the mud.
Rich Schoenberg continued his domi-
nation of the face-off, winning 17 of 21
attempts. W&L also recovered 61 of
56 percent of the ground balls.

Daly is proud of his team despite
the current slump.

‘‘T think the team has represented
W&L well. They've played and train-
ed hard and continue to work as hard
as 33 players can,” he said. ‘I wish
we could have picked up a win here
or there, though, as positive rein-
forcement.”

E&H made it 6-4 in the sixth, but
the Generals put the game on ice in
the top of the seventh by adding two
moreruns.

Tuesday, Eastern Mennonite once
again proved to be too tough for the
Generals as W&L fell 8-i at home.

Just as in EMC’s 16-0 win over
W&L earlier this season, Doug Byler
baffled the Generals hitters as he pit-
ched a six-hit complete game. EMC
scored twice in both the second and
third against starting pitcher Schoet-
telkotte. Any hope of a Generals
comeback was killed in the top of the
ninth when EMC scored four times to
make the score 8-1.

Despite his team’s 1-7 ODAC re-
cord, Murdock remains steadfast in
his optimistic outlook for the season.

“T still believe that we have a
shot,’’ Murdock said. ‘We still have
an outside chance of finishing in the
top four inthe conference.”

‘“‘These are the times that will help

16 at Lynchburg.

N

o Norelco

Is this college hoops’
most exciting idea?

...Gee, isn’t it neat with all the
changes coming to light in college
basketball that we finally got one
that will really let the game turn the
corner toward more excitement.
Granted, the 45-second clock has
done some good things for the game.
Expanding the tournament to in-

{ clude 64 teams was a choice move,
too. (We'd really rather have the tournament open to everyone, Divi-
sion III champions, fraternity IM champs, YMCA champs and cham-
pions from the Big Sky Conference, in that order. )

No, these ideas were fine, but not good enough. You need something
that’s going to attract everybody, all the time. Well, there are only two
things that can fit that bill, and since Christie Brinkley just got mar-
ried, that attraction has got to be money, as in gambling. And college
hoops has finally conceived of an idea that puts the Big East con-
ference in the old hat category. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve got two
magic words for you: point shaving, and I’m not talking Norelco.

Just look at the benefits (Yes, these prices are INNN-SANE!):
Games will not only feature competition between different teams but
conceivably also between different players on the same team. Can you
see a team trying to run a four corners when two guys have money
wagered on their opponents? Also, just think of the increases in TV
revenues as more and more housewives become college basketball
fans. (‘‘This is more fun than the state lottery,’’ says Miss Sophie
Glutz from Ft. Lee, N.J.)

And let’s not forget how big a bonus it’l] be for our student-athletes.
They’ll get to experience life in much the same manner as it will be
after they graduate magna cum prima donna from Bookie U. Hey, if
they fix games in the ‘‘amateur’’ (cough) game, is it much of a jump to
say they might do it in the big leagues, too? (A season of 82 games is
going to need some type of excitement every now and then.) It’s kind
of an internship program. And they’ve got a shot clock. Can 20-second
timeouts, no zone defenses and Dancing Harry be far behind?

Point shaving adds a whole new dimension to the college game. Box
scores won’t give individual point totals any more, but how many
points under his average Joe Cash ‘N Carry is and whether the Green
Wave (isn’t that funny?) beat the spread. Scoreboards, once reserved
for the score and foul situations, now will include flashing pari-mutuel
odds. And when you walk into your favorite fieldhouse and ask the lady
at the $2 window if there are any seats in Section H, you might be rude-
ly enlightened. (‘‘No sir, bets are closed on whether Looie’s going to
wear that ugly sweater again.’’)

Yes, point shaving is an idea indeed whose benefits are limitless.
College basketball will be so changed we won’t ever again recognize it

as that silly game where giving your all never had an ulterior motive
and making a mistake was never something you tried todo....

Final Tournament thoughts: Villanova was a 70-1 longshot when

losing effort, but other than that CBS got a dream game. (Champions

A W&L batsman takes a crack in the third inning during yesterday's game with Hampden-Sydney. The Generals lost 13-9.

Slump, controversy surround baseball

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team dropped its record to 3-11 yes-
terday after losing 14-9 to Hampden-
Sydney in Lexington.

W&L head coach Jim Murdock
started freshmen Michael Suttle,
Alex Sutton and Carnpent Clement in
place of regulars Billy White, Milam
Turner and Chuck Nelson against the
Tigers. Freshman Kevin Topping
started at catcher for Mike Jacoby.
Murdock’s ploy failed as H-S jumped
out to an 11-2 lead before holding off a
late General rally.

The problems in the game went be-
yond the score. Generals starting pit-
cher Kirk Breen and Murdock ex-
changed words after the second in-
ning, eventually leading to Breen’s
being benched. The junior left the
field during the fifthinning.

“IT thought Kirk was cooling off
{after being removed from the
game], and then I looked up and saw
him driving off,’’ Murdock said. He
said that Breen’s status with the
team is uncertain.

Breen could not be reached for
comment last night.

The game got off to a pleasant
start, however. W&L took an early
1-0 lead, only to see H-SC score three

runs in the top of the second off
Breen.

“T started the freshmen to add
some variety, some change,’’ Mur-
dock said. ‘“‘We’ve been losing any-
how, and I decided to give them a
chance. We've got to be thinking
about next year, even though we
haven't given up on this year yet.”

Freshman Eric Acra_ relieved
Breen in the third inning, and W&L
cut the score to 3-2 after Sutton and
Don Thayer led off with walks and
advanced a base after Clement
reached on an error. Suttle grounded
out, scoring Sutton to make the score
3-2.

The Tigers exploded for six runs in
the fifth, chasing Acra and forcing
Murdock to send freshman Carter
Steuart to the mound. H-SC stretched
its lead to 11-2 in the sixth when a
Tiger runner scored from second ona
passed ball and another scored from
third on another passed ball.

W&L first baseman Bill Schoettel-
kotte singled with one out in the sixth
and scored on Ricky Zahn’s triple.
Turner singled to score Zahn to bring
the score to 11-4.

H-SC struck back in the seventh,
scoring twice, only to see the Gen-
erals answer with four runs of their
own in the bottom of the inning. Nel-
son led off with a walk and scored on
White's triple. Tom Mack followed

Dr. James W. Worth, coach of the
W&L Fencing Club, placed third in
men’s foil in the U.S. Fencing Assoc-
iation 1985 State Championship Na-
tional Qualifiers last weekend.

The field of 22 fencers at Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College competing
in various age levels included the
William and Mary fencing coach and
some of the top club fencers in the
state. The finish qualifies Worth for
competition both at the sectional
meet in May in Pittsburgh and at the

national meet in Cleveland.

It was the third official foil and on-
ly the second ‘‘electrical foil’ com-
petition for Worth, who until last year
primarily used the saber. (It is called
electric because of the scoring device
used to judge the bout.) Although the
saber and foil fighters score points or
“touches”’ for different targets — for
foil the torso and for saber strikes
above the waist — according to
Worth, ‘‘The footwork, timing, speed
and strategy are complementary.”

“You don’t need brute strength to
fence,’’ he added, ‘but conditioning
can make the difference.’’ Worth has

Towson’s Jeff Peek moved the mar-

later, John Luppe was feeling a little
left out of the fun so he took a pass
from Conley and fired home Towson’
fourth unanswered tally.

Daly immediately called time out
before any additional damage was
done.

“Time out was to calm people
down,’’ said senior co-captain Dave
Johnston. ‘‘After that, we started to
play without mistakes and were able
to pick the tempo up. Nobody thought
we were going to lose. We still
thought we would win.”’

The time out proved effective. The
Generals’ offense began moving the
ball. With a man-up situation, the
Generals capitalized. Junior attack-
man G.T. Corrigan cut the lead down
to 4-2 with his second goal of the
season, assisted by Mark Knobloch,

The Washington and Lee track
team captured four second places at
Mary Washington College’s Battle-
field Relays last weekend.

At Friday’s field events, Mike
McAlevey and John Carder were run-
ners-up in their events. McAlevey
threw the javelin 178’ 6’’, while
Carder pole vaulted 12’.

Saturday’s track events saw fresh-
man Andy White take second place in
the 110-meter hurdles with a time of
15.3. The W&L sprint relay team of
Chris Ives, John White, Chris Bleggi
and Mark Pembroke finished second
behind Frostburg State. The team’s
finishing time was 3:31.2.

legs at three different distances. The

head and controlling the game. All
was quiet until junior attackman
Todd Breithaupt decided to stir
things up. Breithaupt made things
closer with his first goal of the
season.

The first period was important in
the Generals’ development this sea-
son, They proved they could come
back. W&L did come back against
Maryland on March 16, but this was
the first time in '85 that the Generals
were able to come back to prevent an
early blowout.

Daly said the Generals were’ “out-
played” in the second period, but
they weren’t outscored. With 6:48 left
in the half the Tigers’ Mullins scored
for the second time in the game, this
time ona clear, making the score 5-3,

The Generals needed goals, and
they soon got what they needed. With
1:06 left in the half, Deringer took ad-
vantage of a man-up situation to
score his second of the day and cut
the margin to one goal. Then Rod
Santomassimo opened the field up on
a breakaway and found Deringer for
the hat trick to tie the game up at the
half as the teams went to the locker
rooms at the intermission.

runs 400 meters and the anchor
(Pembroke) runs 800 meters.

Although team scores are not kept
at invitational meets, head track
coach Norris Aldridge maintains that
there is still team identity. ‘But you
concentrate on your own event,’’ he
added. Coach Aldridge continued:
‘“‘We compete as a team but are pri-
marily concerned with bringing our
individual times down.”’

He added that his teams usually
face very tough competition at invi-
tational meets. Aldridge concluded
that the work on individual times and
competition against tougher oppo-
nents prepares the Generals to de-
fend their crown at the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference outdoor
championships.

On April 20, the Generals will tra-
vel to Greenville, S.C., to compete in
the Furman Invitational. On April 27,
the Generals will host the ODAC out-
door championships at Wilson Field.

  
 

  
 

When the teams headed back to the
field for the second half, nothing had
changed: There was still mist, mud
and cold. But with 12.47 left in the
third period, the score did change.

Junior attackman Bill Holmes
teamed up with Deringer to get his
first score of the game and give W&L
the lead. Towson, after a 3-0. dry
spell, figured a reply was in order.
Three minutes later, Winkoff came
from behind the goal to get his second
score and tie the gameatsix.

Things began looking much like the
first period again when Conley took
advantage of a man-up and scored
unassisted with 9:14 left in the
quarter. But that lead didn’t last, as
Deringer got his fourth on a return-
the-favor assist from Holmes.

The seesaw battle continued when
the Tigers capitalized on another
man-up situation. Mike Policastre
gave Towson the lead at 8-7.

The fourth period saw the tension
mount when Conley added his second
goal of the game to give the Tigers a
two-goal lead with 11:44 left toplay.

Sandy Brown then cut the lead to
one with an unassisted goal. With
1:03 left, W&L got the break it was

looking for — another man-up situa-
tion. But the Generals did not score
with the man advantage, and the
game ended at 9-8.

Assistant coach Sam Carpenter de-
scribed his feelings with a movie
reference. ‘‘You know how [Chief]
Inspector [Dreyfuss| gets that ner-
vous twitch around Clousseau in Pink
Panther movies? That’s how I get
when people mention Towson State.”’

The Generals did have some fine
individual performances, however.
Goalie John DiDuro had 16 saves de-
spite the funny bounces in the mud.
Rich Schoenberg continued his domi-
nation of the face-off, winning 17 of 21
attempts. W&L also recovered 61 of
56 percent of the ground balls.

Daly is proud of his team despite

the current slump

“I think the team has represented
W&L well. They've played and train-
ed hard and continue to work as hard
as 33 players can,"’ he said. ‘I wish
we could have picked up a win here
or there, though, as positive rein-
forcement,”

The latest art work on display at
the du Pont Gallery is receiving
some rave reviews.

‘Best show yet,’ ‘‘excellent,”
“intriguing’’ and ‘‘very impres-
sive in quality and quantity” are
just some of the comments made
by visitors to the gallery.

Obviously, this is no ordinary
show. Little, if any, of the art on
display will ever appear in public
again, not because it is of extraor-
dinary value or quality, but be-
cause of the artists behind it.

The sculptures, paintings and
sketches in the show were done by
students in the art classes at
W&L. For most of them, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to have
the public see their work. After
the show is over, they will gather
up their creations and cart them
off to their rooms or give them to
parents of friends or even throw
them away.

The variety of work is astound-
ing. Entering the gallery, one en-
counters elementary sketches of
fledgling artists side by side with
oil and watercolor paintings. Mo-
dern sculptures of twisted and
warped metal and polished wood
lay scattered along shelves and
tables.

For many students, especially
those who have just taken their
first art course, seeing their art on
display is the end of a process that
began with an interest in learning
to create and ended with the de-
velopment of that ability

tist to get something in the show.
You're overwhelmed when you
see your work in there, consider-
ing some of the other work they
have inthere.”’

Mark Herman, who exhibited
his work in the student show last
year, said many people are sur-
prised at the quality of the work.

 

 

 

“It’s incredible how much you
can progress and have people ac
tually interested in buying some
of your work,’ he said

Joe Videler said having his art
in the show meant a chance to get
some reaction to his work.

“It's nice to be in the show be-
cause art is to be looked at,” he
said. “You get feedback from
other people.”

For Paige Wingert, having his
work inthe show has been a profit-
able experience, literally

Wingert sold his sculpture
‘*Walk with Walnut” for $325.

He said he had not intended to
sell the sculpture, a series of
wooden spirals that reach out in
every direction

The idea to put such a high price
on the piece came from a visit toa
Roanoke gallery. He explained
that everything there had such a
high price that he thought that it
might improve the image of his
work by doing the samme thing

“If people looked at the price,
they might think the piece was
really good just because of the
price,’ hesaid.

Wingert said that unlike most
artists, he did not have any sym-
bolic meaning in his work.

“It's an aesthetic thing. The
wood and design are beautiful,”
he said. ‘‘People say that modern
art is meaningless, but does art
have to be a perfect image of
something?”’

Lime Kiln slates three

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

The Lime Kiln Theater will present
three plays, including a world pre-
miere, in its first full season this
summer.

The repertory theater company,
which began last summer with a li-
mited run of ‘‘Rock Kiln Ruin’s Tale
of Cymbeline,”’ will premiere ‘‘Stone-
wall Country,’ a play based on the
life of Stonewall Jackson and written
by Don Baker, the company’s pro-
ducing director.

In addition, they will also repeat
“Cymbeline,”’ an adaptation of the
Shakespeare play of the same name,
and will perform ‘“‘Red Fox/Second
Hangin,”’ a play acclaimed by critics
during its off-Broadway run.

Like ‘‘Stonewall Country,’ each
was written or adapted by Baker and

is set in Southwest Virginia.

Again this summer, the company
will consist of professional actors and
will perform at the Festival Theater
at Rock Kiln Ruin, west of Lexington.

In preparation for the upcoming
season, which will run from July 19
through Aug. 25, Lime Kiln Arts Inc.,
the theater group’s parent company,
has conducted a $50,000 fund drive, to
raise money to pay promotional and

_ production expenses.

According to Liz Butler, the com-
pany’s office manager, the organi-
zation reached its goal of $50,000 last
week. She added that the drive,begun
four weeks ago, will continue until
the end of the month.

Besides money collected by the
fund drive, the organization also re-
ceives revenue from grants made by
foundations and corporations and
from ticket sales.

No excuse

Nabobs nattering again
with new members, name

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

and JILL FAUSTINI
Special to The Phi

 

There was no excuse when the
Nabobs broke up last December.
Area groupies thought they'd be at a
loss for ‘local talent.’’ Since Febru-
ary, however, things are better than
anyone could bepe for — there's a
new band.

Two former Nabobs recently have
teamed up with two of W&L’s very
own calendar men. Made up of third-
year law student John Miller and
seniors Landon Banfield, Marshall
Young (Mr. May) and David Wood-
ham (Mr. April), the band plays late
sixties and early seventies rock-and-
roll.

Despite Banfield’s claim that their
new name came about because they
thought of themselves as originally
as an excuse for a band, it was clear
from the start that ‘‘The Excuse’’
was nothing of the sort.

The band currently plays two of its
own compositions. One, “Girl of My
Dreams,” was written by Young,
lead guitarist and vocalist. The sec-
ond is a Chuck Berry instrumental
with lyrics by Miller, called
‘Suzanne.’

After having only four practices,
the band made its debut at Zollman’s
Pavilion on Feb. 9. Since then, it has
played at two fraternities, Hollins
College and the Cockpit.

Each of the members has played in
other bands in the past, but this band
is different. Woodham, who shares
lead guitar with Young, points out
that ‘this will be the last hurrah
before we hit the job market.”

Despite slight stylistic and sound
problems, normal in any new group,
individual talent is clearly evident.
With only a small number of formal
practices, the band consistently im-
proves and puts out quality perfor-
mances.

More than 300 people heard them at
the Cockpit last Friday.

Miller, who continues in the role as
drummer from his old Nabob days,
credits the group’s early success to
“having three great lead guitarists in
one band,’ and as he modestly adds,
“one adequate drummer."

Young echoed Miller, saying, “The

Phone: 463-3614

EAST LEX

wav we sound is a tribute to every-
one’s expertise.’’ He also praised
their soundman, junior Nick Berents,
saying, ‘‘He gets a lot of the credit for
how we sound.”

Berents admits that he did not
know how to work a sound board
when Miller and bassist Banfield,
who used to play lead guitar for the
Nabobs, asked him to handle the mix-
ing.

“I didn’t have a clue on how to
work a sound board, so I went down
to Roanoke and learned how to oper-
ate one,’ Berents said. He says he
can now handle the minor trouble-
shooting problems, but judging by
their performances last weekend at
the Cockpit and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, he does a much better job
than that.

The band has progressed from four
excellent individual musicians to a
solid unit. One of the more notable
points of this group is that unlike
most new bands, you can actually
understand what these guys are
singing.

Vocals are split between Miller and
Young, with backgrounds coming
from Banfield and Woodham, who
adds, ‘‘when I have to.”’

Obviously, the band enjoys what
they're doing almost as much as
their audience. Young said, “‘It’s fun
making money doing something you
like," while Woodham, who the
others call ‘the experience,’’ adds,
‘‘We'll play anywhere for money.’

Banfield believes ‘‘our new group
blows the Nabobs out of the water.”’
Miller agrees, admitting the stage
has had a positive effect on their
“social life’’ as well.

That the band is gaining in popular-
ity and appeal is without question.
They plan to play again at Hollins on
April 26 and will back up Skip Castro
at the Rocklands on May 1. They are
also hoping to play at the University
of Virginia in addition to continuing
at W&L.

For the diehard fan who hasn't
been able to grab a souvenir (Wood-
ham’s Michael Jackson hair curl,
Banfield’s patent leather vest, Mil-
ler’s earring or Young's innocence)
there’s still hope. The band is plann-
ing on selling buttons . saying,
‘What's Your Excuse."’

Without a doubt, there's no excuse
not tosee this band.

Although that solution may not be practical, judging

 

Goshen apparently was named aptly.

In ancient Egypt, a fertile valley of the same name
was valued because of its agriculture and grazing.

The pharaohs, however, did not like the valley be-
cause of its distance from the lifeblood of the times, the

Nile River.

Asimilar complaint was voiced this week by a Wash-
ington and Lee student, one of many who have enjoyed
the sun, rocks and water at Goshen Pass, Virginia, dur-

ing the recent 90-degree heat.

The only problem with Rockbridge County's Goshen,
though, is the 20-minute drive from the Washington and
Lee campus, according to senior Mark Pembroke.

Nevertheless, Pembroke sees a possible way to re-

solve the problem.

sentenced
for forgery

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A former Washington and Lee stu-
dent was convicted yesterday of forg-
ing an $1,800 check and of cashing a
$500 check that did not bear his
name.

The former student, William Addi-
son Vaughan Jr., pleaded guilty to
the charges and was given a two-year
suspended prison sentence for each
charge by Rockbridge Circuit Judge
George E. Honts III.

Honts also placed Vaughan on pro-
bation for four years and ordered
him to make restitution of the $2,300
to the Lexington branch of United
Virginia Bank.

Vaughan was a senior at Washing-
ton and Lee in 1983-84 but has not
received a diploma from the school.

The $1,800 check was drawn May
24, 1984, on the account of James Ed-
ward Abbe IV, who graduated last
spring. Abbe was described by Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
“John” Read as having been a ‘‘very
close’ friend of Vaughan. The $500
check also was drawn on Abbe’s ac-
count.

The Nov. 5 grand jury indictment
against Vaughan listed four counts:
one of forging and one of uttering on
each of the two checks. The charges
of the uttering of the $1,800 check and
the forging of the $500 check were
dropped.

says party rules

can now be loosened

 

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council was
told Tuesday night that in the future
the Board of Trustees plans to be less
specific in the social regulations it
imposes on fraternities.

‘‘We now have a chance to change
the rules,” IFC President Jaimie
Hayne said, although he qualified his
statement by adding that ‘‘we won’t
be able to return to the system of no
control.”

The Student Affairs Committee,
which is composed of students and
faculty, would have to approve any
IFC recommendation.

The trustees had said at their Oct-,

ober meeting that endorse any
changes in the fraternity party regu-
lations that took effect this fall
because the board had approved
plans for the student activities pavi-
lion with the understanding that the
new rules would be in place.

“Those were basically their rules
and nobody could change them but
the board,’’ Hayne said after the

SAC OKs Rush

The Student Affairs Committee

ations the Rush calendar for next

endar includes a ban on Wednes-
day night parties.

 

 

meeting. ‘‘They’ve decided to move
away from making rules like that for
us and they want to adopt a general,
overall policy and SAC will be oper-
ated within that policy.”

Hayne urged fraternities to discuss
what changes they might like to see
in Wednesday night party regula-
tions, since that will be the main
agenda item at Tuesday’s meeting.

“One of the main changes may he
that hopefully we’ll get away from
the one-house rule so that two houses
can party together,”’ he said after the
meeting.

He told the IFC that another possi-
bility is for fraternities to be allowed
to have two Wednesday night parties
a month.

Hayne said he hopes to have a re-
commendation on new rules ready
before next month’s board meeting.

In other action:

eHayne warned fraternities about
putting up posters for Wednesday
night parties. He said there is a $50
fine for the first offense, since the
parties are supposed to be spontan-
eous.

eHayne said he plans to make at-
tendance at IFC meetings manda-
tory for fraternity presidents be-
cause different representatives have
been coming to every meeting.

When Hayne suggested levying a
fine against those failing to appear,
Assistant Dean of Students Dan. N.
Murphy intervened and said that al-
though the plan is ‘‘a good idea,”
“there should be an amendment to
the constitutional bylaws”’ before it is
put into effect.

The price of selectivity: Rejections are ‘increasingly difficult to explain’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Washington and Lee’s choosiness
in admissions this year was second in
the state only to that of the Universi-
ty of Virginia, according to an infor-
mal survey of key Commonwealth
colleges and universities.

The academic powerhouse in Char-
lottesville accepted 25 percent of the
students who applied for undergrad-
uate admission for next fall, W&L
gave the green light to 30 percent of
its applicants and the College of Wil-
liam and Mary took 34 percent.

W&L’s applicant pool was up 75
percent compared to the previous
year, allowing the school to be con-
siderably more selective than last
year, when it admitted more than 60
percent of applicants.

As an example of the more strin-
gent standards, students offered ad-

mission for next fall have an average
combined Scholastic Aptitude Test
score 92 points higher on a 600-point
seale than the average for this year’s
freshman class.

“The turnaround this year has
been remarkable,’’ Admissions Di-
rector William M. Hartog III said.
“It's put us in a very strong posi-
tion.”’

With heightened _ selectivity,
though, comes an increased number
of disappointed high school seniors
and parents, and Hartog said people
frequently try to second-guess the ad-
missions office and ask for an expla-
nation or reconsideration

“Acceptances went out on Friday,
the 29th of March,’’ Hartog recalled
“On Monday the first, the phone

started to ring. It rang and rang and
rang all the way through the first
week of April.”’

Hartog said such a reaction is to be
expected ‘“‘when you consider the

kind of student denied admission
here,” and he added that usually
“people are quite understanding.”’

“Ninety percent of the people just
want to inquire and are genuinely in-
terested,”’ he continued. ‘‘There is a
very small percentage who are down-
right angry.”

Hartog said it’s frequently difficult
to articulate the reasons a particular
applicant was offered or denied ad
mission. ‘In a highly selective pro
cess like ours, in many cases the dif-
ferences between these students are
not that obvious,’ he explained

“It becomes increasingly difficult
to pick up a folder and explain to a
parent why his son or daughter was
not admitted,’ he continued. ‘‘In
many cases these judgments are
very subjective....Many times, it’s
how well the student presents his or
her case.”

University President John D. Wil

son said he occasionally receives

calls, usually from alumni, asking
him to review admissions decisions.
He said there have been ‘‘more this
year than before”’ and that ‘‘certain-
ly as a matter of courtesy’’ he re-
sponds to such requests.

‘These were very, very thoughtful
calls — no sense of pressure or

something unfair going on,’’ Wilson
said.

“One thing is very clear, and that
is that our capacity to choose talent
has been markedly increased,” he
said. ‘‘Our university has attracted
this year a very academically strong
group — that’s all there is to it.”’

41 applicants taken from waiting list

The admissions office on Friday
and Monday moved 41 applicants for
admissions from the waiting list to
the acceptance pool, but now plans to
accept no more until after the Wed-
nesday deadline for enrolling.

‘That was expected,’’ Admissions
Director William M. Hartog HI said
of the offers to students who had been
“‘wait-listed.’’ He explained that the
admissions office ‘‘purposely came
in from the low side’’ with initial
acceptances in order not to exceed
the 400 it can enroll in next fall’s

freshman class

“There is no resemblance between
those taken from the wait list this
year and last year,’’ he said, adding
that the students were of such high
quality that the admissions staff ‘‘ac
tually hoped we'd be able to go to the
wait list.”

With just under a week remaining
for students to enroll, the Admissions
Office this morning had received ac-
ceptance checks from 270 students
198 men and 72 women. The goal is a
class of 300 men and 100 women
 

 

 

 

OPINION

Page 2
April 25, 1985

 

Spring:

Worth a term?

The typical student’s reaction to the thought of beginning a
new regimen of studying, attending classes and preparing
papers during the spring term would follow something like
this:

‘Hit the books? You must be crazy! No gentleman would
ever dare crack a text when the sun is in prime tanning posi-
tion, the store has a special on 12-packs and the road to
Goshen lies waiting. This is spring term — not study time.
Get out the shorts, unpack the polo shirts, crank back the
sunroof and let’s have a good time for six weeks! ”’

Unfortunately, that seems to be the attitude many students
have for the final term. Warm weather means party time, not
academic time. The realization that professors actually re-
quire work from students in the spring comes too late to
remedy any deficiencies up to that time. What is to be done?

First, there is something illogical about the concept of a
spring term. Sure, professors can organize those neat semi-
nars on topics that otherwise would not warrant a full term’s
study. Yes, some students are able to use the time to study
abroad instead of taking off a full or half of an academic
year. Granted, classes tend to be smaller, the students get to
know the professors better because of the smaller class size.
Indeed, the intense study for six weeks lends itself to greater
retention in the long run. On the other hand, do these reasons,
among others, warrant the six-week academic burp at the
end of 24 weeks of lectures, papers, tests and finals?

The question, it seems, is whether the so-called 12-12-6 cal-
endar really serves everyone well. While we are told that pro-
fessors enjoy the spring term, all we hear the first few days
: of classes is how short the term is and how it will not allow as
' detailed a study of the topic as is necessary. We hear how
rushed things will be, and how critical it is that students at-
tend every class. We hear from the professors how they
realize that half of the class will only attend a quarter of the
lectures and how those students will fail. In short, we are
continually subjected to recitations of how much professors
detest spring term.

Students also find themselves in disagreement over the six-
week study period. While it does allow for six weeks of rela-
tive ease and party time, it also places many students at a
distinct disadvantage when it comes time to search for the
summer job or internship. Employers are looking for stu-
dents to begin work at the end of May — not the middle of
June. Also, some students lose money on summer apartment
leases because of the odd timing of the end of classes.

It seems, then, that an alternative to the present calendar
should be found. Such a move is long overdue. A ‘‘15-15’’ cal-
endar or even a trimester calendar are two possibilities that
might result in more productive use of future academic time.

But searching for a new calendar to cure the woes of spring
is not all that should be done. Students need an attitude
change as well. We need to realize that spring term, while br-
inging lighter academic loads, also carries with it a certain
burden of responsibility for students. The spring calendar
says that we can overcome the temptations to blow off
reading that 699-page novel on the ancient voodoo practices
of Inner Mongolia or writing that 35-page paper on the effect
of ether on the develpment of motor skills in mice and
achieve new heights of academic grandeur if we are as
mature as we say we are. It places a certain amount of con-
fidence in our ability to make the right decisions. It entrusts
us with the responsibility we desire.

This spring term, students, faculty and administration
need to reconsider the idea behind the final weeks of study.
Whether it serves any of us as well as we think it does re-

With spring term comes the
opportunity to experience another of
Washington and Lee’s most popular
traditions — the popes course with
Dr. Futch.

About 10 percent of the school —130
students — is enrolled in the course,
which has outgrown the historical
confines of Newcomb Hall and relo-
cated in Parmly.

And, amazingly enough, all 130
students continue despite the re-
quirement that they wear the much
maligned....dare I say it....necktie.

the professor, is the last remaining

But it does a good conservative’s

Disinvestment alone spells disaster

MY
VIEW

 

By Jon
Zagrodzky

On April 3, I was fortunate enough
to attend a film and discussion ses-
sion held by the Washington and Lee
Campaign Against Apartheid. The
film gave a startling account of the
abominable cruelty characteristic of
the apartheid system in South Africa,
and the subsequent discussion re-
vealed well-informed concerns of
those in attendance. While the films
proved to be invaluable sources of in-
formation concerning apartheid, I
found the ideas and proposals enu-

merated thereafter to be somewhat
less useful. Before I discuss why, I
will first recount some of my obser-
vations on the issue.

At present, there seem to be two
factions dealing with the apartheid
question: those who demand the eli-
mination of the system, and those
who fear instability and damage to
U.S./South African relations should
the system (and the government) be
overthrown. The first group, which
includes the W&L Campaign Against
Apartheid, seeks to force the govern-
ment and businesses, through pro-
tests and disinvestment plans, to cut
off dealings with the South African
government and thereby speed the
demise of apartheid. The second
group, while it may condemn apar-
theid as unjust, prefers to pursue
constructive engagement and do
nothing to curtail the almost Nazi-

like treatment of South African
blacks. Personally, I find myself
committed to the destruction of not
only apartheid, but all other sources
of oppression and injustice as well.
The question is, why am I unable to
support wholeheartedly the conven-
tional anti-apartheid forces in this
country?

I think the answer lies in my dis-
taste for their methods rather than
their goals. The U.S. anti-apartheid
groups have proposed various disin-
vestment schemes, whereby they
would force organizations with which
they are affiliated to sell their in-
vestments in companies that do busi-
ness in South Africa. It is believed
that this would force U.S. companies
to shut down their South African
operations, thus bringing economic
pressure to bear on the South African
government. South Africa, however,
could easily encourage more invest-
ment from Europe and Japan to re-
place lost U.S. investment should this
plan succeed. U.S./South African
relations would evaporate, U.S. cor-
porations and citizens would lose

money and this ‘‘economic embar-

go" would ve about as ciucctive
against apartheid as the U.S. grain
embargo was at getting the Soviet ar-
my out of Afghanistan. It seems that
these disinvestment schemes would
be useless gestures even if they did
succeed in forcing U.S. companies
out of South Africa.

My greatest concern, however, is
with the. South African groups that
American anti-apartheid forces sup-
port. Bishop Desmond Tutu and the
Africa National Congress both be-
lieve that violence will eventually be
needed to destroy apartheid. Unfor-
tunately, they don’t tell us what is to
come after apartheid. Every indica-
tion is that a dictatorship of some
sort will be formed, as has been the
case in every sub-Saharan African
nation that has achieved “freedom.”
It is instructive to observe how well
average folks are doing in these other

nations before we encourage the
same destiny in South Africa.

Most of the nations are dominated
by ruthless Marxist dictatorships.
Nations once able to feed themselves
are no longer able to do so, and mem-
bers of legitimate opposition parties,
like Joshua Nkomo in Zimbabwe, are
terrorized and forced to flee their
country. The tyranny of minority co-
lonial dictatorships has been re-
placed with equally oppressive black
dictatorships, with no improvement
in the lot of of ordinary people, black
or white.

Herein lies my difficulty with anti-
apartheid forces. Their goal is the eli-
mination of apartheid (a noble task),
but their motives are purely racial. It
does not matter to them that a new
South African government would
murder people and confiscate pro-
perty, just so long as the killing didn’t
discriminate between races.

I think that in order to properly
voice my abhorrence of apartheid, I
should form a third faction to deal
with the problem. This group would
seek the overthrow of apartheid by
evolutionary rather than-revolution-
ary means, and would also ensure
that the end result was freedom and
justice for all the people in South
Africa. It would decry organizations
that seek to rationalize apartheid as
well as others who are interested on-
ly in the destruction of apartheid and
not the eventual well-being of all
South African citizens. Clearly, the
goals of this new group would not on-
ly be justifiable from a U.S. foreign
policy standpoint, but would also be
desirable by anyone who supports
true freedom.

The problems in South Africa are
enormously complicated, and I don’t
pretend to have all the definitive an-
swers to these or other political ques-
tions. If I did, I would be king tomor-
row. In any case, I would urge any-
one who has an interest in this issue
to attend tonight’s meeting of the
W&L Campaign Against Apartheid.

the dining hall. In an age in which our
generation is accused by elders, pro-
fessors and others ad infinitum of be-
ing apathetic, one could not help but
feel that these guys were taking their
studies seriously.

It was gratifying to visit a place
where traditions die hard.

After last year’s occurrences,
chances are slim that such days will
ever occur again here at our red-
bricked and white-columned sanc-
tum. But let’s not give up hope. The
Executive Committee made a val-
iant, albeit doomed, effort last year.
Maybe the future carries some hope.

George Will used ‘‘The Great Tie
Fiasco” last year to extoll its virtues,
speak positively of today’s younger
generation and long for the soon-to-
be days when spring breaks will be
spent in Madras attire in liberated
Havana.

Despite other’s arguments, I be-
lieve the tie is a mark of a gentleman,
not the mark of a fascist.

And what’s wrong with an assimi-
lation code, anyway?

With all due respect to Prof. Stene,
when is that funky-looking slate thing
going to be removed from the lobby
of the library?

I mean, seriously, it looks like part
of the ceiling caved in and because of
an effort to cut library maintenance
costs, it hasn’t been cleaned up or re-
paired. Natural lighting or some-

ing?

I claim to be no connoisseur of mo-
dern art, but really, guys. Slate is
slate is slate. Are those holes signifi-
cant, or did the slate just not fit snug-
ly together?

Actually, the library lobby is an

amazing contrast in art forms. On
the traditional side, above the stair-
way hangs the Father of Our Country
(and University), and along the walls
are stately portraits of great states-
men like Washington, Madison, Mar-
shall and Zac Taylor.

And then there are those four cloth
things of the trees with something
— roots, snakes or something — pro-
truding upward. And what is that
thing in the corner — the modern
sculpture cleverly (and ambiguous-
ly) titled “Working No. 1’’?

Or what about when you walk into
the C-School? Greeting you is some
mixture of black, blue and red colors
that form nothing.

I’m not one of those guys who
searches for the meaning of life in
everything. I can listen to the radio
without exploring the deep implica-
tions of each song. But I like things to
make a little sense....just an inkling
of sense.

Like those pictures hanging in
front of Carole Chappell’s office. She
has stared at those things for years
and still can’t figure them out.

My bet is that any. monstrosity you
see on campus can be traced to a do-
nation by some alum with a chip on
his shoulder toward us. What a way
to get even.

Finally, on a more serious note, we

dents from W&L, VMI and local wo-

To the Editors:

I simply want to voice my final
impressions of the Washington and
Lee atmosphere as a departing sen-
ior. It has been a rewarding exper-
ience, though turbulent. I have a few
regrets in my four-year stay here. I
gladly welcome the change to coedu-
cation as a signal that the school will
be joining the world in the 20th cen-
tury. As a black student, I think I had
a pretty good idea of what I was sub-
jecting myself to socially, but I did
allow cynicism to creep into my
attitude nevertheless. I believe I
have reached a point, however,
where I have risen above the circum-
stances not only in academic adequa-
cy, but in exuding a more positive at-
titude. I only hope more of my
‘‘peers’’ can or will reach this level.

Spring brake: Varied vacations come to a halt

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Although temperatures in Lex-
ington last week reached the low 90s,
many Washington and Lee students
left town in search of sun, sand, sea
and other spring break pleasures
Florida and other southern points
remained favorite destinations for
most vacationers.

Among those who made the trip to
Florida last week were two groups of
Students who rented motor homes
and drove them to Ft. Lauderdale

“We did it [rented the motor home]
because we thought it would be
cheaper,’’ said junior Rusty Johnson,
who went with six fraternity brothers
in one of the recreational vehicles,
“but it turned out to be a losing stunt.

We figured that it cost us more than it
would have cost to spend a week in
the Bahamas.”

Johnson said the group thought it
could save money on hotels and that
it would be convenient to have the
mobility a motor home would give
them.

There were certain advantages to
the mode of transportation the group
chose. ‘‘It was nice to be able to drink
the whole way down to Florida,” he
added, ‘‘and not to worry about driv-
ing.”

Another group of students went to
Florida, but only briefly. Nine sen-
iors from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fra-
ternity stopped in Cocoa Beach for a
party on their way to Cancun, Mexi-
co. The party was not a run-of-the-
mill affair. On the day the group was
passing through Cocoa Beach, a

Space shuttle launch was scheduled
at nearby Cape Canaveral

The group arrived in Cocoa Beach
early on the morning of the launch to
find breakfast waiting at the house of
senior Andy Best, one of the Cancun
bound travelers. He had alerted
his mother and arranged for her to
prepare omelettes, doughnuts and
coffee. Just before the launch, Best
said the group mixed screwdrivers
and Bloody Marys and walked to the
boardwalk to watch the shuttle blast
off.

After the lift-off, Best said. it was
back to the cars and on to Miami to
meet their flight to Mexico and pro
ceed with what he called a ‘“‘low-bud
get, high-fun program.”’ Once in Can-
cun, Best said the group spent its
time on the beach, touring Mayan
ruins, snorkeling and deep-sea fish

At least four Washington and Lee
seniors will continue their studies
next year free of charge after receiv-
ing graduate fellowships or scholar-
Ships, administration officials
report.

G. Bryan Balazs, David F. Connor,
David L. Harrar II and Marc F. Mon-
yek will be studying as close as
Charlottesville and as far away as
Germany.

Harrar received a _ National
Science Fellowship, which will pay
for his three-year study of applied
mathematics at the University of
Virginia beginning in the fall.

The fellowship will pay $6,000 each
year for his tuition and other ex-
penses, Harrar said, and he will re-
ceive an $11,000 stipend each year.

The fellowship does not guarantee
a job, Harrar said, and he will not be
responsible for any post-graduate
work.

“They’re trying to increase highly
skilled people in the country,’ he
said.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, a member of
W&L’s Committee on Graduate Fel-
lowships, called the award ‘‘pretty
prestigious.”

Connor is one of 500 college stu-
dents who received a Fulbright
Scholarship for graduate study in
nearly 58 foreign countries,

SE aan,

At the University of Bonn in West
Germany, Connor will conduct an in-
dependent study of the political im-
plications of rapidly declining birth
rates. His program will be supervis-
ed by a professor of the political
science department and possibly by a
faculty member in the sociology de-
partment.

The program, partially sponsored
by the German Academic Exchange
Service, will begin in September
when Connor will stay with a host
family until classes begin — in Ger-
man — on Oct. 1.

The nine-month academic year,
which is fully paid for by the Ful-
-bright award, will end in the last
week of July.

In 1983, Connor studied in West
Germany with German instructor
Marshall K. Follo for the spring
term.

Simpson said the West German
government is very supportive of for-
eign exchange programs.

Monyek learned last May that he
had received a Rotary Graduate Fel-
lowship from Rotary International, a
network of local civic clubs. Monyek
was one of five recipients selected by
the Lake Forest, III., district from
among 30 semifinalists and 15 fina-
lists.

“The stars must have been lined up
right,” he said.

Monyek will study graduate econo-
mics at St. Andrew’s in Scotland. As
a recipient of a Rotary Fellowship,

Washington: First in war, peace, pocketbook

biggest news story to come out of Washington and Lee this
decade would be last summer's coeducation decision. That
announcement was covered in such places as The New York
Times and The Washington Post and on Cable News Net-
work.

This weekend, however, a story from here landed on the
NBC Nightly News, the CBS Morning News and on the front
pages of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and USA Today.

It seems appropriate that the former Washington College
would be the source of some startling new information about
“father of our country.” Did George
Washington marry for love? Possibly. New evidence shows,
however, that the bottom line is that the Widow Custis was
loaded.

Confused? University News Office Director Jeffery G.
Hanna explains what all the fuss is about:

the so-called

What one noted scholar calls ‘‘the most important ad-
dition to George Washington’s material in more than a
generation’ has been discovered at Washington and
Lee. .

The find consists of 36 leaves of an account book that
documents Washington’s administration of Martha
Washington's first husband’s estate and the guardian-
ship of the heirs of that estate.

The ledger provides scholars with important informa-
tion about Washington’s finances, his accounting prac-
tices and the contents of the Custis properties.

According to Richard W. Oram, W&L’s reference and
public services librarian, the discovery of the ledger was
made in late 1983 after officials decided to move some of
the University’s historical records from their storage
place in Washington Hall to the climate-controlled stor-
age facilities of the University Library.

Included among those records was a manuscript
known to be associated with Washington, whose connec-
tion with W&L dates back to 1796, when his gift of canal
stock to the struggling institution, then known as Liberty
Hall Academy, saved the school from financial ruin.

“The document was yellowed by age, stained with
water spots and covered with mold colonies that looked
like Rorschach blots,” said Oram.

The signature of one of W&L’s first benefactors,
George Washington, can be seen on this page of a ledger
belonging to the University Library.

Even in that condition though, the document’s leaves
bear the unmistakable signature of ‘‘Geo Washington,”’
Oram said.

Once the book had been uncovered, Oram began his
search to find out precisely what significance it might
have. With the assistance of independent Lexington
scholar Joseph Horrell, Oram began his investigation by
first matching mold stains on the leaves in an eflort to
put the pages back into their proper order.

‘‘Joe Horrell spent several hours a day for almost a
year analyzing the manuscript,’ said Oram. ‘‘We now
know that Washington set up this ledger to preserve

copies of all the reports he submitted to the General
Court at Williamsburg during the 12 years he adminis-
tered Daniel Parke Custis’ estate.”

What makes the discovery even more valuable is that
records of the General Court were all lost in a fire in
1865.

According to Oram, Washington biographer Douglas
Southall Freeman, used records that duplicated some of
the material in the newly discovered ledger in order to
describe the settlement of the estate.

Freeman, however, knew less about Washington’s
guardianship of John Parke (Jacky) and Martha Parke
(Patsy) Custis. Apparently Freeman did consult the
W&L ledger, but it was so scrambled at that time that he
could not identify the guardianship accounts it contain-
ed.

“These provide much new information about the rear-
ing of Washington’s stepchildren and the preservation of
their inheritance,”’ said Oram.

Washington married the widow Martha Custis in Janu-
ary 1759 and succeeded her as the administrator of her
late husband's estate. Using the ledger entries, Horrell
has estimated that the estate was worth 29,650 pounds in
the currency of Colonial Virginia. Though confessing
that some scholars may dispute his estimate, Horrell
contends that would translate into about $6 million in to-
day’s money.

Once uncovered, the ledger proved immediately use-
ful to University of Virginia scholars who are compiling
all of Washington’s papers in a multi-volume edition.

U.Va.’s W.W. Abbot, editor of The Papers of George
Washington said that after the manuscript’s restoration
“‘we will have the most important addition to George
Washington’s material in more than a generation.”

“The Custis property was the basis for Washington's
own future, and his management of that property was
his main concern from the time of his marriage until the
Revolution,’’ he continued. “Certainly the account book
will add greatly to our volumes dealing with this per-
iod.”’

As Oram has reconstructed the events, here is how the
ledger found its way to W&L:

After Washington died in 1799, his papers were dis-

persed. Many were passed down to George Washington
Parke Custis and, in turn, to his daughter Mary, who
was later to become Mrs. Robert E. Lee.

When Union troops advanced on Arlington in 1861,
Mrs. Lee shipped trunks of family silver and papers to
Richmond and on to Lexington, where they were buried.
The material included the ledger.

Mrs. Lee once described Lexington as ‘‘the most inac-
cessible place I know of.”

In 1865, Gen. Robert E. Lee became president of what
was then Washington College. When General and Mrs.
Lee moved to Lexington, the buried silver and papers
were dug up and were found to be covered with mold be-
cause the box had leaked.

In the 1890s George Washington Custis Lee, who
succeeded his father as president of W&L, gave the
Washington and Custis papers to the Virginia Historical
Society. In 1907, though, his sister, Mary Custis Lee,
withdrew some of the papers and gave the account book
to Washington and Lee. It remained in Washington Hall
from then until it was moved to the University Library in
1983.

Oram said the ledger will be taken to Philadelphia this
summer to be restored. The restoration project is being
supported by a gift from Mr. and Mrs. John G. Hamilton
of Florida and from library funds contributed in memo-
ry of late W&L professor Ollinger Crenshaw, author of
‘General Lee’s College.”

The Washington ledger will join several other impor-
tant Washington relics in the University’s collection. A
celebrated portrait of Washington by artist Charles Will-
son Peale and portraits of the Custis family hang in Lee
Chapel. The Reeves Center owns a dinner plate from
Washington’s set of china.

“The library’s collection of Washington material was,
until now, relatively insignificant compared to our
collection of Robert E. Lee material,’’ said Oram. ‘‘This
ledger will help rectify that and will also give us a better
understanding of Washington as an exceptionally syste-
matic man who was particularly meticulous in his re-
cord-keeping.”’

And rather prudent in his choice of a spouse.

 

 

 

Exall resigns Cold Check post

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Junior Henry Exall resigned as
chairman of the Student Financial
Relations Committee Monday night,
stating in a letter to the Executive
Committee that he was forced to re-
sign due to “circumstances beyond
{his ] control.”’

The EC unanimously selected
sophomore Peter Bennorth as the
new chairman of the SFRC, or ‘‘Cold
Check” committee.

‘‘We grieve the loss of Henry,”’ EC
President Cole Dawson said.

Exall had been scheduled to ap-
pear at the meeting to defend himself
against charges that his _perfor-
mance as the committee head had
been inadequate.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers nominated Bennorth as

 
 
    
 
 
  

the new chairman saying that ‘‘he’s
the man for the job.”

Bennorth has been a member of the
cold check committee this year and
said he has worked closely with trea-
urer Jim Murphy.

Bennorth said he believes Exall re-
signed because ‘the has been per-
ceived as being the focal point of the
problem.”’

“TI guess the bounced check was the
final straw.”’ he said, referring to an
incident last month.

According to Bennorth, this year's
committee started out with a great
deal of bounced checks from last
year’s seniors that needed to be co-
vered. Consequently, the committee
was left ‘‘in the hole.”’ He said it has
been trying to catch up ever since.

On the other hand, Bennorth ac-
knowledged that Exall should have
been more aware and could have im-

proved his communication with the
town merchants.

“T want to stress that I feel Henry
did a credible job and was the victim
of circumstance,’’ Bennorth said.

He said he hopes to bolster the cold
check committee’s standing with
town merchants through various im-
provements in the committee’s man-
agement.

For instance, he intends on posting
hours when he and Murphy will be in
the office. He explained that then
members can know when they can
get a check issued. In addition, he
said he plans to check the mailbox
every day.

“We have meetings every Thurs-
day night and Carole [Chappell]
would put notes in the mailbox on
Friday,’ Bennorth said. ‘‘Then it
would take a week before we even got
the note. I hope this way we can
speed up the process.”’

“there’s no point in stacking [the
case],’’ Read said. ‘‘There’s no joy in
a case like this. It’s a tragic situa-
tion.”

Summarizing the Commonwealth’s
evidence for Honts, Read said that a
teller at United Virginia Bank would
testify that she could positively
identify Vaughan as the man who
passed the $1,800 check. The teller,
Read said, had identified Vaughan
from photographs taken in the bank,
a police photo line-up and his picture
in the 1984 Calyx.

A handwriting analysis comparing
the $1,800 check and a letter written
by Vaughan showed “‘strong similari-
ties,’ according to a handwriting ex-
pert, Read said. This evidence was
not present in court, Read said, but

From Staff Reports

 

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
was rehired for an indefinite period
by a 5-1 vote of city council Thursday
night. Sutton, who has been in police
work for 35 years, begins his third
year here May 9.

Councilman Albert C. Jordan was
the dissenting vote. He said that in an
informal poll of 56 citizens, 32 said
Sutton should not be rehired, 16 said
he should be and eight were uncer-
tain.

Jordan said that although he is
“‘not a professional pollster,” he felt
that ‘‘for something as important as
hiring a chief of police, people should
have a Say in the hiring.”

Councilwoman Susan A. LaRue,
trade book manager of the Washing-
ton and Lee Bookstore, said she felt
Sutton should continue on his job
because ‘‘we are on a good course
now.”

“Tl respect very much the opinions
that were expressed on both sides,”’
she said. ‘‘I think that we now have a
more professional police department
that has offered, according to speci-
fic examples, excellent help to citi-
zens in their problems for the last two
years.”

An April 11 press report quoted two

samples would be included in the
case file. The photographs were ar-
ranged in an extensive exhibit Read
had prepared for the jury.

A positive identification of
Vaughan could not be made by the
teller who cashed the $500 check,
Read said, although he added that
she would testify that Vaughan and
the man who cashed tire check looked
“‘very similar.”’

Read said that this $500 check had
been examined by a fingerprint ex-
pert, who had found Vaughan’s fin-
gerprints on the check.

Among the 19 people who had been
subpoenaed to testify yesterday were
Abbe, physics Professor James J.
Donaghy, Physical Education Pro-
fessor Norman F. Lord, Proctor
Charles F. ‘‘Murph” Murray, assis-
tant history Professor John D. Par-
ker and Anne S. Ziegler, secretary to
the dean of the Commerce School.

In his pre-sentencing report, Read
recommended that because this was

unnamed police officers as saying
they were dissatisfied with Sutton’s
personnel policies.

Sutton, 55, said later that day that
he doesn’t ‘expect everyone to al-
ways agree with me or the things that
Ido.”

“I deal with events, not personali-
ties,’’ he said. ‘“‘Some events are eas-
ier to handle than others....There are
always differences of opinion at one
time or another on one subject or
another.”

Since Sutton became chief on May
9, 1983, eight or nine officers have left
the 14-member force, he said. Two
were fired and the others left volun-
tarily, according to Sutton.

Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds said that “if the [city]
council and the city manager are
happy with him, I have no gripe with
itatall.”

Sutton arrived in Lexington in the
wake of the trial of several members
of the department for their alleged
involvement in a theft ring. “At the
time I came here, [the department]
was emerging from a bad period, and
I believe it has progressed quite well
since that time,”’ he said.

Sutton said he has ‘“‘absolutely not”’
been involved in local political ac-
tivities. “I’m not a politician, and

rather that he be put on probation
and ordered to make restitution to

Vaughan’s attorney, Eric L. Sisler,
also asked for probation for his
client.

“This kind of thing is not going to

said Sisler, adding that he has known

In a low voice and with his head

Apartheid violates international law,

.

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

South Africa’s apartheid policies
are “a matter of legitimate interna-
tional concern” and ‘‘a violation of
international law,’’ Law School Dean
Frederic L. Kirgis Jr. said Tuesday.

Despite these apparent violations
of international law, though, Kirgis
Said, the international community
has difficulties enforcing that law.

“T think it’s clear that South Africa
is violating customary and treaty in-
ternational law,” he added, ‘‘but the
international response is just plain li-
mited.”’

Kirgis’ lecture, sponsored by the
International Law Association and
the Washington and Lee Campaign
Against Apartheid, attracted about
70 people to a Law School classroom.

The Campagin Against Apartheid
wraps up six weeks of formal activi-
ties tonight with a showing of ABC
News’ ‘Nightline’ videotapes in
Northen Auditorium and the Student
Center.

The campaign was intended to in-
form the W&L community about
South Africa and to encourage the
trustees to examine the investments
in the University’s portfolio to see if
the school invests in companies that
do busines in South Africa, said Law
Professor William S. Geimer, a foun-
der of the campaign.

Copies of a resolution calling on the
trustees to study the portfolio
have been circulated at the Law
School and on the undergraduate
campus. Geimer said he would not
know until after tonight how many
people had signed the resolution;

‘Famine’

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

 

A “planned famine’”’ in which par-
ticipating students will fast from 8
p.m. tomorrow until noon Sunday
will be the highlight of Lexington’s
World Hunger Awareness Week.

Next week has received that offi-
cial designation from Mayor Charles
F. Phillips. The purpose of the 40-
hour fast is to raise funds for World
Vision, a non-denominational anti-
hunger group with a Christian focus.

The event is being co-sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s Intervarsity
Christian Fellowship and Virginia
Military Institute’s Religious Life
Council. Money will be collected
from sponsors, who aid the national
drive by pledging an amount for each

however, about 30 members of the
Law School faculty have signed his,
and 40 to 50 law students signed
another copy last week.

Geimer added that at the request of
a letter written by three alumni, the
trustees discussed the issue once be-
fore within the past two years.

Introducing Kirgis, Geimer said
Kirgis would be speaking to provide
information about South Africa ‘‘and
not as a supporter of the resolution,
necessarily.”’

International law is derived from
two main sources — treaties and cus-
toms — Kirgis said. A country that
decides to adopt a treaty or to opt out
of a custom legally isn’t bound by it,
he added.

South Africa is bound, though, by
the United Nations Charter, Kirgis
said. Although South Africa’s repre-
sentative to the U.N. has not been
accredited for nearly 10 years, the
country still is a member.

At least one provision of the U.N.
Charter calls for the elimination of
racial discrimination, Kirgis said,
but South Africa has defended apar-
theid by relying on another provision,
which prevents UN intervention in
matters that are essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of any coun-
try

“‘T think that South Africa’s claim
is fallacious,” Kirgis added.

Although South Africa is not party
to a number of other treaties that call
for the elimination of racial discrimi-
nation, ‘“‘They nevertheless are signi-
ficant to South Africa for a number of
reasons,’ Kirgis said.

“They quite clearly establish that a
governmental policy of enforced rac-
ial discrimination against one’s own

citizens is not a matter within the
state’s own jurisdiction. It is a mat-
ter of legitimate international con-
cern.”

These treaties fill in some of the
generalities of the U.N. Charter, Kir-
gis said. In addition, in an advisory
opinion, the International Court of
Justice called apartheid ‘‘a flagrant
violation of the purposes and princi-
ples of the U.N. Charter,” he added.

“There is a strong trend and a con-
sistent trend of opinion from a wide
range of countries that the systema-
tic conduct of racial discrimination is
a violation of international law,” Kir-
gis said.

In addition, Kirgis said, racial dis-
crimination can be classified as a
pre-emptory norm, which ‘“‘have to
do with things that virtually every-
body could agree on, principally on
moral grounds.”

“Once a norm is established at that
level,” he added, ‘‘you’re bound by it
whether you like it or not and no mat-
ter how much you squawk about it.”’

Beginning to discuss the enforce-
ment capabilities of the international
system, Kirgis said, ‘‘here’s where
things get discouraging.”

In the late 1970s, a U.N. Security
Council resolution placed a manda-
tory embargo on the shipment of
arms to South Africa. This action has
had a mixed effect, Kirgis said, be-
cause South Africa has been able to
manufacture weapons for itself and
purchase others on the so-called
black market.

The Security Council’s broadening
these sanctions is ‘‘within the realm
of possibility and could happen very
soon,”’ said Kirgis, who added that he

does not expect military action to be
taken against South Africa.

Possible actions by the United
States include placing certain trade
embargoes on South Africa and
breaking off diplomatic relations
with the South African government,
Kirgis said.

Under international law, though,
the U.S. could not provide military
support to revolutionary groups, he
added, as a titter went through the
audience, thinking of the current de-

bate about U.S. aid to the rebels in
Nicaragua. (The House of Represen-
tatives was rejecting President Rea-
gan’s proposal even as Kirgis spoke).

‘‘Now you could argue that we vio-
late that prohibition in other places,”
Kirgis said.

Even the force of public opinion
does not seem to have worked
against South Africa, he said, and
‘the result is a little frustrating. I’m
not sure what can be done effective-

to kick off Hunger Awareness Week

hour fasted.

Clarke Morledge, president of the
IVCF, said the effort is meant to
bring the issue of hunger closer to the
community. ‘Unfortunately, most
people don’t respond to hunger until
they see it on their TV sets,”’ he said.

The fast will begin, Morledge said,
with a candlelight service at the Ro-
bert E. Lee Episcopal Church at 8
p.m. tomorrow. Several local clergy-
men will speak, including Chaplain
Charles C. Caudill of VMI, who origi-
nally organized the event. A ‘‘break
fast’”’ celebration at the VMI dining
hall will close the activities at mid-
day Sunday.

World Vision claims that 79 cents of
each dollar donated to the group goes
directly to aid the poor, according to
Morledge.

Morledge said that the groups

made the famine effort last year as
well, with W&L raising more money
than any other Virginia campus.

Morledge said that besides raising
money for World Vision, the fast has
three purposes: to raise community
awareness about the problem of
world hunger and what can be done
about it; to bring together several
hundred members of the community,
breaking down barriers between
groups; and to obey the New Testa-
ment commandment to have com-
passion for the poor.

This last reason is the most impor-
tant one to the members of the two
college religious organizations,
Morledge said. ‘‘If you don’t have a
good focus as to why you are doing
something, the effort becomes guilt-
ridden,” he explained. ‘‘People give

IU FD party called ‘total disaster’

 

By ROB DORAIS
Staff Reporter

 

Suffering from a_ self-described
“credibility problem,’’ the Indepen-
dent Union has run into some difficul-
ties this year in planning parties and
organizing intramural teams for in-
dependents.

The latest problem occurred the
Saturday of Fancy Dress weekend,
when an [U-sponsored party in the
‘Cockpit reportedly attracted fewer
than 50 people and was described as
“a total disaster’’ by Jerry Darrell,
food services director.

In an April 1 letter to the Executive
Committee, Darrell said that at 10
p.m. attendance at the Cockpit was
about 30 people, about 10 of whom
were friends of the band.

Total Cockpit food and beverage
sales for the evening were $87.56.

“Unless drastic changes are made
for 1986 I submit that opening the
Cockpit on Saturday night is a waste
of time and student body funds,’’ he
added in the letter.

IU acting President Luke Cornelius
said the group has had to contend
with the shaky start it received last
year, when it was under the direction

' of Jim Sarle and Joe Cadle, neither of
whom is involved in this year’s or-

ganization. The EC also denied the
IU’s request for funds last winter.
This year, under the leadership of

’ President Chuck Diffenderffer, the
, TU was given $257 in the fall from stu-

dent body funds, and about a dozen
members each paid $15 social dues.
An IU-sponsored Christmas party in
the Cockpit attracted about 300 peo-
ple and was called ‘‘an unmitigated

» success’’ by Cornelius.

Cornelius said that a ‘‘liberal esti-
mate” of the number of the people at
the Cockpit for the Fancy Dress par-
ty would be 100.

The Student Activities Board co-
sponsored the event and paid $800 for
the band, Ten-Ten.

Darrell, who said the Cockpit lost
several hundred dollars by holding
the IU Fancy Dress party last year,
added that he thinks the problem re-
sults from lack of continuity. The of-
ficers change each year, and there is
disunity within the organization, he
said.

Cornelius agreed, but said the pro-
blem will not exist next year, when
all of the officers, except himself,
will be returning.

Another reason cited by Cornelius
for the poor attendance at some IU
activities was a lack of advertising
and poor organization.

Although the IU is perceived as

having about 600 students to field
teams and plan parties, Cornelius
said, the actual IU consists of about
60 people who have attended parties,
participated in intramurals or used
the cold test file in the IU’s office.

That cold test file has grown this
year, according to Cornelius, al-
though the officers found it difficult
to keep the office open so that stu-
dents could use it. Every independent
can’t have a key to the office, he said,
and there are not enough things to do
in the office to warrant keeping it
open. ;
The IU will hold one more meeting
this term, Cornelius said. In addition,
anyone wishing to sign up for intra-
mural track events must do so by 4
p.m. tomorrow.

terested in joining the fast are avail-
able at the University Center office

In addition to the Planned Famine,
the IVCF organized a fund raiser for
an unspecified local charitable
group, possibly the Rockbridge Area
Relief Fund, through Evans Dining
Hall. On Tuesday, students volun-
teered to give up their dinner, with
the cost of the food to be donated to
the cause of local hunger. Identical
efforts in the past three years have
usually raised between $300 and $400,
Morledge said.

Morledge said he hopes Hunger
Awareness Week will dispel some
myths about hunger, for example,
that hunger is due to overpopulation.

“Hunger is due to poverty,’’ he
said, ‘‘which may or may not be link-
ed to overpopulation. Sometimes
overpopulation is an attempt to deal
with local poverty. For some families
in the world, more children mean
more field workers and hence more
food produced.”

The week’s events may also gener-
ate some greater achievements. ‘‘In-
dividually, we all say, ‘What can I
do?’ ” Morledge said. ‘‘But working
in groups, a lot can be accomplished.
You can influence the Congress and
national policy even. We hope to
create an arena for various hunger
groups this week, and hopefully some
further actions can be made.”’

$50,000 gift
for Mock Con

Washington and Lee has received a
$50,000 grant from the Hatton W.
Sumners Foundation to enlarge an
endowment fund created to support
W&L’s mock political conventions.

The Hatton W. Sumners Mock Poli-
tical Convention Endowment was
created in September 1981 with a
grant to W&L of $100,000.

The Dallas-based foundation be-

Phi staffers
win awards

The Ring-tum Phi this year was
ranked first place with special merit
in the annual newspaper evaluation
contest of the American Scholastic
Press Association.

Judges for the New York-based
ASPA, which has more than 1,300
member newspapers, said The Phi
“demonstrates a high degree of
professionalism in its writing, design
and photography.”

In this region’s Mark of Excellence
contest sponsored by the Society of
Professional Journalists, Sigma Del-
ta Chi, Chief Editor Bruce Potter
received second place awards for
spot news reporting and editorial
writing and sophomore Chris Bow-
ring placed third in editorial cartoon-
ing.

The news award was for Potter’s
coverage this summer of the ea,ic
sion of an overturned gasoline truck.
He wrote the story for The Richmond
News Leader, where he will work be-
ginning in June. The editorial award
was for a selection of his editorials
from The Phi.

The cartooning award was for a
portfolio of Bowring’s work. Bow-
ring, 34, is an accomplished painter
who has had numerous art shows in
this area. Several of his works were
featured in the recent student show
at the du Pont Gallery.

Aldridge described this year’s
competition as the ‘‘most balanced”’
field in several years. In addition to
the Generals, Aldridge cited Lynch-
burg, Bridgewater and Emory and
Henry as the top contenders for the
title

Bridgewater is led by Isaac Rod-
gers, a sprinter and jumper who par-
ticipated in this year’s NCAA Divi-
sion III indoor nationals, and Mark
Luiggi, a strong middle distance run-
ner. Emory & Henry’s Keith Arring-
ton, who is one of the top decathletes
in the nation, has already qualified
for the outdoor nationals in the pole
vault. Lynchburg’s Joe Killeen is a
top contender in the 400 meter hur-
dles and also the pole vault. Roanoke
College also has one of the ODAC in-
dividual leaders in Rob Greathead,
who won the one-and two-mile races
at the indoor championships and has
run the best outdoor times in the 1,500

ber of the 400-meter relay team. Mc

can place several people in each

titive for the title.

Several Generals will double or
even triple up by competing in two or
three events to add to the team depth

White, in fact, will compete in six
events on Saturday: two relays (in-
cluding the 400-meter relay team
with Ives, McGowan and Chris Bleg-
gi which set a school record last
weekend at Furman), the 200 meters,
the 400 meters, the triple jump and

The senior members of the W&L

meet with impressive statistics. Dur-
ing their four years, they have com-
piled a 25-3 dual meet record, won
three ODAC championships (two in-
door and one outdoor), and have
contributed to the current streak of
13 consecutive dul meet victories.

Coach Aldridge attributes much of
this success to his two assistant
coaches, Joe Freeland and Steve
Jefferson.

But all the statistics aside, one can-
not doubt that the Generals are ready
for Saturday. One need only the
verve of senior Ken Moles: ‘‘Every-
body is psyched for this!”’

The meet will begin at 10 a.m.
Saturday and continue throughout
the day.

team edges lacrosse in 2 OT’s

The Generals lost two contests dur
ing the spring vacation. Last Wed
nesday, Cornell's Big Red beat W&L,
14-6. Saturday, the Generals took the
nation’s No. 1-ranked Division III la-
crosse team, Washington College, to
a pair of overtime periods before los-
ing 14-13.

It is the latter affair that pleased
Daly the most.

“That was a unique sports exper-
ience,” he recalled. ‘“‘That’s how
lacrosse should be played. Two
teams went at each other for 60 min-
utes, found they were tied, and went
at each other again for almost eight
minutes more.”

Went at each other, indeed. The
lead see-sawed throughout regula-
tion with neither team ever gaining a

lead of more than a goal.

The Sho’men appeared to have the
game secured with four minutes to
play after taking a 13-12 lead and con-
trolling the ball.

But Daly said his team had a sense
of confidence that it was always in
the game. So when the Generals stole

sion-making process. What Tulane’s
decision means (that is, if others
are willing to pay attention to it) is simply that big-time college
athletics has lost touch with any possible connection it ever had with
those old-fashioned ideals of complementing a student's academic life
and strengthening a young man or woman’s character.

Yes, lost touch, and it is very disconcerting. U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, a
former standout hoopster himself, said on ABC’s ‘‘Sportsbeat”’ that he
was ‘“‘sad”’ about the Tulane decision, that athletics enhanced his
undergraduate development as well as lending unity and providing en-
joyment for the rest of the student body.

Well, yes, it makes me said, too, senator, but the fact of the matter
is, the folks at Tulane only were revealing what I think is inherent in
the makeup of the present-day world of college athletics.

Intercollegeiate athletics on this level no longer can be called ex-
tracurricular activities. For an overwhelming number of the trained
automatons running and jumping around in college sports, basketball
and football are the curricula. What the decision at Tulane reflects is
the idea that one university is not going to fall prey to this sickening
trend of win, win, win, along with its partner in crime, money, money,
money.

The decision at Tulane was the only one to be made if you see a
university as a place of learning. More importantly, though, the deci-
sion touched on something that it seems far too few other schools are
willing 1) to admit and 2) act on.

It’s a simple adage, but quite pertinent in this case: The bigger and
more complex something gets, the more problems it is going to have.
Division I (and conceivably all of college athletics) has reached a
point at which it is no longer safe from corroding away at its insides
Winning and success now have become the only acceptable results,
andwith this pressure the likelihood for repeats of the Tulane scandal,
where cheating is viewed solely as a means to an end, rather than as
something that on its face might be construed as wrong, becomes quite
great.

Tulane made no plans to reinstate the program after some time, and
that too should be applauded. What they realized is that to start the
program again is to invite the same problems all over again.

In the end, then, what can we take from the Tulane decision? A hope
that all intercollegiate athletics are abolished? Well, maybe so. We
are at a stage where even the Little League probably is filled with
glory-hungry parents cheating so their little boys always win, In any
case, cheating and just plain old dirt in sports is becoming more and
more the rule rather than the exception, and like the skater on thin ice,
a change in skates isn’t going to do much good. What is going to help is
a resolve that a college is a place of learning and study and that it can-
not be such if we continue to allow 1) educationally deficient athletes
to take up the desks of real students, and 2) an attitude that mandates
immediate success at the price not only of individuals but ultimately
of universities as well...

...Returning to the tropical Colonnade, tennis season, as far as a bid
to nationals is concerned, was probably decided with Wednesday’s win
at Emory. The big win should lead to an invitation to the big tennis
party in Lexington next month...Heard in passing: NCAA representa-
tive Tucker DiEdwardo, who has been associated with college la-
crosse, mentioned that the Division III lacrosse championships would
bea heckuva tournament if Washington and Lee were involved...

...Got a chance to view that Hagler-Hearns tete-a-tete. First round
was pure war, a war Hearns had no business being in. Third round
could easily have ended with the death of Hearns, had Hagler really
hit him....While we’re on it, just a guess that if Larry Holmes steps in
the ring with Michael Spinks, he will regret it.....

..USFL will apparently go witha fall season in 1986. I do like a good
joke now and then....Crosby’s widow saying no more Crosby tourna-
ment is scary. I always thought golf was one of those games beyond
reproach. Now, I wonder....And while we're on it, Bernie Langer (das
ist LONG-er) is a pleasant sight. Kind of a new wave Lee Trevino. He’s
fun and good for the game...

I'll leave you again with some predictions, baseball style: NL
East will be won by Chicago, NL West by Cincinnati, AL East by
Toronto and AL West (who cares? ) by Seattle...

Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee baseball
team fell to 4-15 yesterday after los-
ae at home to Virginia Wesleyan,

4.

The game was not as close as the
score indicates as W&L, scored all
four of its runs in the bottom of the
ninth inning after the outcome had
been determined.

Wesleyan, nationally ranked in
Division III, scored once in the first
inning and again in the third thanks
to a W&L error and a walk given up
by pitcher Carter Steuart. The Gen-

. erals fell behind 3-0 in the fifth and

surrendered two more runs in the six
tth to trail 5-0. Wesleyan put the
game out of reach in the eighth by
scoring three more runs to open a
commanding 8-0 lead before the W&L
rally in the last frame.

Bill Schoettelkotte got the Generals
in the scoring column with his one-
out home run to left field. Pinch hit-
ter Don Thayer reached on an error
and was followed by a walk to pinch
hitter Tom Mack and singles by
pinch hitter Carmen Clement and
regulars Chip Hutchins and Hugh

“We gave up quite a few runs that
we shouldn’t have,” Murdock said.
“We continue to make mistakes at
the plate that we shobut not swinging
at any pitch.”’

In conference action last week,
W&L dropped three of its four ODAC
contests, losing to Lynchburg and
Bridgewater before splitting a dou-
bleheader with Maryville.

Against Lynchburg, the seventh-
ranked team in the country in Divi-
sion III, the Generals gave up a cost-
ly unearned run in the fourth inning
to allow the Hornets to win 4-3 in a
game that was halted after five inn-
ings because of rain.

Schoettelkotte got the loss for the
Generals despite turning in a solid
performance. The sophomore allow-
ed only five hits and three earned
against Lynchburg while fanning
eight.

W&L fell behind early in the game
against Bridgewater and never re-
covered, losing 7-1 at Smith Field to
the Eagles.

The Generals snapped their four-
game losing in the first game of the
doubleheader at Maryville, winning
3-2. White bounced back from the
Bridgewater loss to get the win,
yielding only four hits and two runs
(one earned) in going the distance.

In the second game, it was the Gen-
erals who were shut down as W&L
could produce no runs and only five
hits in losing 3-0. Bridgewater scored
single runs in the first, second and
fourth innings for the win.

Schoettelkotte once again pitched
well but received little help from his
teammates. Schoettelkotte hurled a
five-hitter and allowed only one earn-
ed run in his complete game perfor-

~ game, Daly said “‘the feeling of

everybody on the field was that we
would score.”
Score they did. After a missed shot,

the Generals’ Jeff Mason forced the

extra periods with his second goal of
the day.
“That play was indicative of the

2 way we have been playing,’ Daly

said. ‘‘These guys never give up. We
were down by a goal, forced a turn-
over and made the most of our oppor-
tunity. That shows a lot of fortitude
and guts.”

Washington got the winning tally at
the close of the second overtime per-
iod. Rick Sowell scored his fifth goal
of the game on a pass from Bruce
Yancey with 10 seconds remaining in
the period.

Starring for the Generals in the de-
feat, which ensured a third straight
losing season for W&L, were attack-
men Rod Santomassimo (4 goals, 2
assists), Mark Knobloch (3 goals, 1
assist) and Caulley Deringer, who re-
turned to his hometown of Chester-
town, Md., to record a goal and three
assists. Keeping up his torrid pace in

against the Sho’men, the same num-
ber of saves he had against Cornell.

Daly said the Washington game
left his team and him with a special
feeling. ‘‘Right afterwards, the feel-

“Our kids felt it was the best game
they’ve played all year. I think that
performance has buoyed the team,”’
Daly said.

Next up for the Generals is an
away contest — their fourth in a row
— with Bucknell (7-3). The Bison lost
22-7 Tuesday to the sixth-ranked
team in Division I, the Jack Emmer-
coached U.S. Military Academy. The
only common opponent between
W&L and Bucknell is Towson State, a
team that beat the Generals but lost
to the Bison.

Daly said the Generals are in as
good a mental state as they have
been in all season. ‘“‘Right now, the
feeling is that we did play well
{against Washington], and, yeah, |
guess we are further along than we
have been.”

“Our mental state is better than it

Tennis beats Emory;
nationals a possibility

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

In their biggest match of the
season, the Washington and Lee ten-
nis Generals defeated Emory Uni-
versity, 7-2, a victory that may prove
instrumental in the Generals’ efforts
to earn a bid to the national cham-
pionships.

Head coach Gary Franke and the
team have understood all year long
the supreme importance of yester-
day’s match. Franke emphasized
before the match that the Generals
not only needed to win, but to win big.

‘We really need to blitz Emory,”
he said.

The team met the pressure head
on, losing only at No. 1 singles, where
David McLeod dropped a 6-4, 6-4 de-
cision to the highly ranked Keith Git-
telson, and at No. 5 singles, where
freshman Chris Wiman lost in a third
set tie breaker.

Because many of the contending
teams for bids to nationals have not
competed against one another during
the year, the selection process is a
complex and confusing affair that in-
volves such methods as comparing
how two teams fared against similar
opponents or how close a particular
match was.

Of importance to W&L’s chances
for a bid is an earlier season match
between Emory and now top-ten
ranked Millsaps College that Mill-
saps won by a 6-3 score. W&L’s better
victory over Emory, although not
guaranteeing a bid, should be a key
factor in the selection committee’s
deliberations. In other action, the
Generals completed their four-match

their entry fee will receive a T-
shirt, which have been provided
by an anonymous donor who want-
ed to recognize George Cunning-
ham’s achievements in a special
way.

In the 5K and 10K races, awards
will be given to first-, second-, and
third-place finishers in each of 12
age divisions for men and women.
A gift certificate for an ice cream
cone from Sweet Things will be
the prize for the Fun Run.

A donation from Huger Distri-
buting Co. of Lexington will de-
fray most of the expenses of the
Cancer Runs.

Arby’s will provide liquid re-
freshments for the runners. Fol-
lowing the race there will be sev-
eral drawings for prizes donated
by Jefferson Florist, the Body

trip through Florida last week, and
though they lost three of the four con-
tests, the trip was a very positive
experience for the team, Franke
said.

Though the trip down to the Sun-
shine State was a mite crowded with
10 people in the the team van, the
Generals got the Southern swing off
to a good start with a 7-2 victory over
Division I Stetson University.

“We felt before that we could play
with Stetson,” Franke said. ‘‘I
thought we played fairly well.”

W&L’s lone victory came from Jim
Morgan, who was again in for the
injured Adams. Morgan won in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.

The Generals’ final match of the
trip was a frustrating 5-4 loss to the
No. 2-ranked team in the National As-
sociation of Intercollegiate Athletics,
Flagler College. The Generals drop-
ped four of the six singles contests
but were able to tie the match at 4-4
with wins at No. 1 and No. 3 doubles.
Flagler claimed the victory, how-
ever, with a three-set win at NO. 2
doubles, defeating the team of Roby
Mize and Adams, 7-5, 5-7, 6-2.

On Monday, the Generals suffered
a shutout defeat at the hands of Divi-
sion I James Madison. It was the first
time this season that the Generals
had been shut out.

W&L takes its 13-8 mark to Lynch-
burg this weekend for the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference champion-
ships. The Generals have not lost to
an ODAC opponent this season and
enter the event as the heavy favo-
rites, with an outside chance of
sweeping all six singles flights and
the three doubles flights.

According to Patti Ryan-Man-

The new section, which comprises

‘Around the World’ with Prince

ALBUMREVIEW

By MARSHALL BOSWELL

 

 

You might have already heard that
the new Prince album is out and that
it is supposed to be a psychedelic de-
parture from last year’s Purple Rain.
Everyone from Newsweek to The
Washington Post has featured the
new record and it has caused quite a
Stir.

Granted, the new album, called
Around the World in a Day, certainly
looks psychedelic and much of it even
sounds like it might have been releas-
ed in 1967; however, if the truth were
known, it isn’t quite the musical
curve ball that the media has been
promising.

Actually, Around the World is
basically the logical extension of Pur-
ple Rain. For instance, all of that talk
of a ‘“‘purple rain’’ sounded suspici-
ously similar to a ‘‘purple haze,’
while the Purple Rain sleeve was
adorned with flowers. Prince’s quitar
work even recalled a certain Jimi
Hendryx. So did his haircut.

So, the new LP just picks up these
influences and runs with them. The
difference here is that Prince is
shooting for the Beatles this time out.

Now, too much can be read into this
Beatles comparison, but I don’t think
the similarities are an accident. The
disc opens up with the Eastern influ-
enced title track, and it is an obvious
throwback to George Harrison’s sitar

experiments/mistakes. Cello, oud,
finger cymbals and a darbuka clang
and whine while the lyrics promise to
“escort U 2 places in your mind.”
Sounds like some kind of magical
mystery tour to me.

The following number, ‘‘Paisley
Park,’’ bears more than a passing re-
semblance to “Strawberry Fields
Forever.’’ His pace is slow and
moody anda violin runs throughout.

After that, though, the rest of the
record continues in pretty standard
Prince fashion. ‘‘Rasberry Beret”’ is
driven by a tasteful string section
and it recalls last year’s ‘‘Take Me
With U.”

“Condition of the Heart”’ is simply
another Prince ballad, although it
outruns anything else he’s done by a
mile.

Primarily, the biggest departure is
in the record’s subject matter. The
lewd, lascivious sexual come-ons are
not nearly as pronounced, and when
they are brought out, His Royal Bad-
ness rebukes his own immorality.

The most prominent example of
this element is the record’s center-
piece, the 8'2 minute ‘‘Temptation.”
The track closes the album and it is
more or less this year’s answer to
“Purple Rain.’’ The pace is bluesy
and Prince pretty much jacks his
Fender Telecaster to 10 and lets rip.

It begins predictably enough:
Prince squeals and screams about
his uncontrollable sexual passion,
wailing, ‘‘Temptation/working my

The album cover of Prince's ‘A4round the World ina Day.’

body with a hot flash of animal
lust...’ There is talk of something
called ‘‘Purplelectricity’’ and the
tune builds to a standard Prince gui-
tar rave-up

All at once, though, the bottom
drops out and nothing but a piano and
a wandering saxophone remain.
Then comes Prince's rap with God.

That’s right. His rap with God.

The Almighty informs His Purple
Holiness that ‘‘you’ve got 2 want it 4
the right reasons. U don’t. Now die.”
So Prince wises up, apologizes and
promises to be good from now on.
Then he signs off. End of record.

Pretty cryptic, indeed, but it does
raise a problem. All of this psychede-
lic imagery and the talk of mind jour-
neys comes off as entirely too mani-
pulative. When the Beatles and Bob
Dylan flew into the mystic, it reflect-

ed the spirit of the times. I am hard-
pressed to believe that there is any
chance of a new Summer of Love in
these MTV, pro wrestling, Apple-
computerized eighties.

That aside, Around The World In A
Day is quite entertaining, challenging
and romantic. I could do without the
overly jingoistic ‘‘America,”’ but the
gospel-tinged ‘‘The Ladder”’ is a bril-
liant spritual anthem. And if there is
a message for these Yuppie-infested
eighties, then the funky ‘‘Pop Life”’ is
it. “Is the mailman jerking U
around?” Prince taunts. ‘‘Did he put
your million dollar check in someone
else’s box?”’ Indeed.

In closing, you can dance to it, it’s
got a good beat and I give it a 90. End
of review.

This ‘Vacation’ not worth the taking

MOVIEREVIEW

By COTTON PURYEAR

 

 

“Fraternity Vacation.”

The words bring to mind hordes of
young college males piling into cars,
driving to one of America’s many
wonderful beaches, drinking lots of
beers and generally abusing the fe-
male populance of said wonderful
beach. What ‘Fraternity Vacation’”
gives us is five frat boys in Palm
Springs drinking only a few beers
and abusing only one girl.

The movie revolves around super-
nerd Wendell Tvedt (Stephen Geof-
freys) and his two fraternity brothers
as they embark on a Palm Springs
vacation from the winter wastelands
of Iowa. It becomes very obvious
very quickly that Wendell is only
there because his parents furnished
the beach condo. (When his friends
meet two attractive young beach
bunnies and make plans to return to
the condo, Wendell offers to go back
with them and make lemonade).

The plot thickens as two members
of a rival fraternity show up and
decide to make trouble for Wendell

and his buddies. After a good-natured
frat prank, a $1,000 wager is made on
which fraternity man will be the first
to get to know the local beach god-
dess (Sheree Wilson) in the ‘‘physical
sense.”

While the foot race for getting the
goddess in the sack takes place, Wen-
dell makes the best of his vacation by
falling off a roof, getting thrown in
jail and getting thrown out of a re-
staurant by the local chief of police.
Wendell makes it all up in the end as
he walks off into the Iowa sunset arm
in arm with the goddess, leaving bud-
dies behind pondering the values of

nerddom.

“Fraternity Vacation’ has an oc-
casional good moment, but never
does anything to raise itself above
the countless other college break
beach flicks. It does deserve a little
credit for showing a glimpse of how
cruel it can be on the other end of a
college prank.

The biggest fault of the movie goes

to the title. Five guys at the beach .

hardly deserves the billing of ‘‘Fra-
ternity Vacation.” A more descrip-
tive title might have been ‘‘The Nerd
Gets the Goddess” or perhaps even
better, ‘‘Just Another College Beach
Movie.”

EC backs Tomaso on drugs;
SCC gets non-voting woman

Female to be added

Asks that slurs be

The Executive Committee on Monday narrowly voted
to add a woman ad hoc member to the Student Control
Committee if no female is elected, and easily defeated a
similar proposal for a minority ad hoc member.

The proposal for the female member passed 5-3-2; the
proposal for a minority lost 4-6.

The Coeducation Steering Committee had recommen-
ded that the EC appoint a freshman woman as a non-
voting member of Student Control next year if a woman

During the extended debate, Jonson and Dalton were
outspoken in their opposition to the idea of a woman ad

“With all guys on the committee, at least you get a
general consensus,”’ Jonson said. ‘With one woman, you
run the risk of her one view being taken as the general
feeling of most women. Who's to say her one view is the
right one?”’

Dalton expressed similar views. ‘‘You’re limiting it to
the view of one woman,”’ he said.

A Rockbridge County grand jury
will decide Monday whether to indict
senior Gene Girard on a charge of
possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute it.

The charges were certified to the
grand jury after a 70-minute prelimi-
nary hearing Friday.

Girard was arrested March 1 at the
East Lexington grocery store by Ser-
geant R. W. Hall of the Rockbridge
County Sheriff's Department and
held for several hours before arrang-
ing a $30,000 property bond.

Girard, a 23-year-old from Coral
Gables, Fla., was co-captain of the
W&L football team last fall. He was
not called to testify during the preli-
minary hearing.

Dressed in a blue blazer, white
shirt, striped tie and khakis, Girard
from time to time shook his head and
leaned over to confer with his attor-
ney, Laurence A. Mann of Lexington.

Lexington and Rockbridge County
law enforcement officers testified
that Girard was arrested in connec-
tion with a package containing about
one ounce of cocaine that was sent

English ‘comps’:

of Forensics showed the package
contained 29 grams — slightly more
than an ounce — of cocaine.

General District Judge E.C. Wes-

terman ordered the case sent to the
grand jury after denying a motion by
Mann that the Commonwealth’s evi-
dence be struck because Girard
never took physical possession of the
package.

Assistant Commonwealth’s Attor-

ney Richard J. Cabaniss said there
was “‘more than enough evidence to
go on with the case,”’ while Mann
argued that the relationship estab-
lished by the testimony was “tenuous
at best.”

Cabaniss said Girard exercised

legal control over the shipment by
asking that East Lexington receive it
for him.

Mann contended, however, that the

package cannot be connected with
Girard, because law enforcement
officers testified that he did not touch
it and his name was not in the ad-
dress. ‘‘He never even saw it,”” Mann
said.

Senior representative Bob Tomaso, the EC’s ad hoc
member to the SCC, said, ‘‘This committee is not as ser-
ious as the EC. But I think a woman will help it a great
deal. Think how they will feel next year. I think this will
be something that they can notice as our effort to make
their transition easier.”’

EC President-elect John Lewis was adamant in his op-
position to the proposal.

“This tokenism will ruin W&L,”’ he said. ‘‘If we start
putting people on committees just so they can represent
a minority, then we’re hos:

Jonson also expressed a fear that a woman ad hoc
member might represent a separation in the perception
of honor.

“There are some situations where there is a clear dis-
tinction between honor and dishonor. I’m worried about
this separation,” Jonson said.

EC President Cole Dawson supported the resolution.
“There are tons of things girls talk about that they would
never talk about around guys,” he said. ‘“‘There might
arise a problem in which the girls won’t want to talk to
an all male SCC. I’m afraid a lot of things might not go in
front of the SCC.”

Dawson also said it “is known’”’ that student control is
‘not as serious’’ as the EC is.

Dawson asked that the resolution state that the need
for a woman ad hoc member be reviewed next year. Car-
uthers said that if next year’s EC wanted to review the

The report of the Drug Policy Review Committee and
a minority report written by head dormitory counselor
and committee member Bob Tomaso were endorsed
unanimously by the Executive Committee on Monday,
with only a few minor changes.

The faculty-student University Council was scheduled
to discuss the report at its meeting this afternoon. The
faculty will discuss it and may vote on it on Monday.

The drug committee, formed by President John D.
Wilson last fall at the request of the Board of Trustees,
called for a distinction between ‘‘major” and ‘‘minor”
offenses under the jurisdiction of the Student Control
Committee and for a number of changes in the SCC’s
procedures.

The committee also recommended that possession or
use of drugs not be punishable by the University. Toma-
so’s minority report, endorsed by the EC, stated that not
penalizing use of drugs would place dormitory counse-
lors ‘‘in an impossible situation.”

Tomaso also wrote that “hypocrisy would exist when
students are allowed to use drugs in the dormitories
when very few members of the community are actually
willing to allow such behavior.”

Sophomore representative Andrew Caruthers said he
agreed with Tomaso’s view.

“What might happen is that one hall might become a
party hall,”’ Caruthers said. ‘‘Everyone goes over to this
hall to do drugs because the dorm counselor allows it,
and then there’s this one kid alone who could really feel
offended.”

Speaking about the committee’s 30-page report as a
whole, Tomaso, one of three students who served on the
committee, told the EC, ‘‘We want to elevate Student
Control to the level of the EC.”’

As examples, Tomaso pointed out the reports’ report's
proposal for recorded testimony at SCC hearings in addi-
tion to the designation of ‘“‘minor’’ and ‘‘major’’ offenses
(all of which fall beneath honor violations in severity).

A second minority opinion, written by Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John and Professors Louis W. Hodges
and Michael A. Pleva, was specifically opposed by the
EC.

The opinion, which asked for greater faculty represen-
tation in Student Control decisions, stated that the facul-
ty “‘have been little involved in discipline, save to how!
ineffectively when we thought students were too lightly
punished for what we perceived to be gross misconduct
(to wit: the boxwood incident).”’

The list of ‘‘minor’’ and ‘“‘major”’ offenses evoked a lot
of interest of the parts of various EC members.

The drug committee’s report proposed that penalties
for students convicted of ‘‘major’’ offenses include pos-
sible pulsion or suspension from the University. Penal-
ties for ‘‘minor’’ offenses would include such things as
dormitory or social probation.

First-year law representative James Crutchfield ex-
pressed some concern about the distinction.

“I’m afraid that many of these “major’’ offenses
would be, in my opinion, honor violations,” Crutchfield
said.

Tomaso explained that the offenses were designated
as ‘‘minor”’ or ‘‘major”’ in an effort to clear up problems
with the University’s current policies toward conduct.

13 seniors pass, breathe sigh of relief

thorough hell before and during, relief after finishing
and when the grades are up, a fantastic sense of accom-

 

 

Those words initially chill every senior English major,
who must pass such an exam to graduate.

For that reason, 13 Washington and Lee seniors
breathed a sigh of relief yesterday when they saw their
names on a list posted on a bulletin board in the English
department.

No one who took the exam failed it this year, although
if anyone had, he would have been able to take it again
and eventually could have had to take an oral exam. In
order for a student to fail the written exam, two-thirds of
the English faculty members must vote against his pass-
ing.

“The students take discrete and comprehensive
courses in several areas, but the comprehensives allow
them to synthesize their knowledge and self-confi-
dence,” acting department Chairman George W. Ray III
said.

“It’s a test of endurance, perseverance and patience,”
said Glen Jackson, who took the exam last week. ‘‘It
makes graduation more climactic, and it gives youa tre-
mendous sense of accomplishment once you have finish-
ed.”’

Jackson’s description of the actual taking of the test
was somewhat different, however.

“You sit in a room on the Colonnade for four hours
Thursday afternoon and four hours Friday afternoon,
while people outside are playing Frisbee and listening to
Chaka Khan — after a while, you wonder what the hell
you are doing there,” Jackson said.

Warren Taylor echoed that opinion.

“It’s not pleasant, but good things are not always plea-
sant,” Taylor said. ‘‘I think it is one of the few oppor-
tunities for an English major to pull together everything
he has learned for four years.”’

Gray Sanders agreed that the comprehensive exami-
nation served as an appropriate culmination for English
majors.

“It brings things together,’’ Sanders said. ‘‘It gives
you a big-picture view. But there is utter, complete and

remembers the anxiety of having to wait for the tests to
be graded. Haring found cause for optimism, though.

“You have got history on your side because very few
have failed it in the last few years,” Haring said. ‘‘With-
out the comps, however, you could ignore certain areas
— the classics, for instance. It’s a way of catching you,
but it’s also a prestigious sort of thing, too.’’

Ray emphasized that the test is not being used as an
exclusionary device. Rather, he said, because of the lib-
eral requirements for an English major, the comprehen-
sive’s value is to ensure breadth of reading and compe-
tent analytical skill.

Ray said he is not certain when the English compre-
hensives started, but he came to W&L in 1964 and
remembers them being ‘‘entrenched” when he arrived.

“Historically, there were at one time many more de-
partments requiring comprehensive examinations,”’
Ray said. “But at Washington and Lee, I think the only
other department still giving comprehensives is geo-
logy.”’

“T think there is evidence nationwide that depart-
ments are moving back toward comprehensives,”’ he
added. “‘If we hang with it long enough, we may even be
avant-garde.”’

“The point,’’ Ray said, ‘‘is that we are a major that
does not require a huge number of credits, so we make
the assumption that there are areas that [the students]
have not studied in depth. Therefore, the comp is to en-
sure the department that they have read widely, if not
deeply.”

Taylor agreed that the English department lends itself
well to a comprehensive exam. ‘‘Any area where you
study the development of something over the course of
centuries lends itself well toa comprehensive,” he said.

‘‘We want them to take pride in the fact that they have
completed an English major,”’ Ray said. ‘We want them
to think and articulate their responses in a clear and
luminous way.”’

Jackson added: ‘‘I think all majors should have a com-
prehensive; they are missing out.”

OPINION wy eee
‘A’ for effort

The Executive Committee has been criticized in this col-
umn for occasionally being unwilling to deal with tough, sub-
stantive issues. The EC has the clout and resources to accom-
plish a great deal, but it sometimes has failed to seize that op-
portunity.

 

At a three-hour meeting Monday night, the committee
tackled a series of controversial topics. We applaud their ef-
fort to avoid a continually neutral, passive position on stu-
dent body issues. What we saw the other night was certainly
more than action for action’s sake.

‘heir good intentions, however, went a bit overboard. Just
as a car that is skidding out of control will surely wreck if it is
jerkily overcorrected, so the EC left itself vulnerable to
criticism because of the overzealousness with which it at-
tacked its agenda Monday night.

The committee allowed itself to be railroaded into acting
immediately on a petition brought before it by two under-
graduate representatives of the Washington and Lee Cam-
paign Against Apartheid. Protesting about firms that do busi-
ness in South Africa is a bandwagon issue that recently has
become quite fashionable, as has hunger in Ethiopia and the
problem of missing children. (Before that, it was the nuclear
freeze; before that, it was saving whales....) At the request of
the two members of the campaign, the EC hopped right on
the boycott bandwagon. Rather than taking a week to allow
members to read the resolution, the committee voted swiftly
to sign the petition, and actually chided sophomore represen-
tative Andrew Caruthers for wanting to read something
before he voted on it.

Caruthers is very conscientious about seeking student body
opinion on how funds should be used and what stands student
representatives should take on issues. No member of the
committee Monday night even suggested that they should
seek someone’s opinion besides their own before thrusting
themselves into the political arena. (What’s the EC going to
comment on next — the deficit? Beirut? Nuclear arms?)

This particular proposal was one they would have done
well to think twice about before endorsing. For one thing, a
representative of the Campaign at first said that University
President John D. Wilson ‘‘supports”’ their effort, but then
allowed as how Wilson was only aware of it and had not in
fact expressed an opinion about it. Additionally, the repre-
sentative of the Campaign said that members of the Board of
Trustees were ignorant about this issue and that the Cam-
paign wanted to educate them. The members of the board did
not get where they are by being stupid or uninformed, and if
the school were doing somthing morally reprehensible, we
suspect they’d be able to act on it without being treated in a
condescending manner by a pressure group made up of a few
students and faculty members.

From apartheid, the EC went on to the matter of having an
ad hoc woman member added to the Student Control Com-
mittee. Three points made during the debate disturbed us.
First, several EC members said a woman is unlikely to get
elected to the SCC. We think that’s a severe miscalculation,
not so much chauvinistic as it is simply unperceptive. All that
any female candidate for freshman class president would
need is a substantial portion of the other 100 women’s votes,
and she’d be in. When was the last time any guy won a class
office by a margin like that? Second, it was stated more than
once that the SCC is ‘‘less serious’ about its work than the
EC, and so having a woman there would help keep it on track.
We think the notion that under the leadership of Townes Pres-
sler and Darby Brower the SCC has conducted itself impro-
perly is at best open to question. Third, Caruthers urged the
EC to make the appointment for only one year. Other mem-
bers of the committee insisted that it not be for a specific
length of time, but that it be reviewed at the end of next year.
They neglected the fundamental point that it’s not their re-
sponsibility to do something that’s binding on another com-
mittee — this year’s committee ought act only for itself. If
next year’s EC wants to continue the ad hoc position, it will
--it doesn’t need the permission of its predecessors. Because
Caruthers saw the flaw in the wording, he and another mem-
ber abstained from the vote, making the EC’s statement
much less clear than it otherwise would have been.

Next, the EC went on to the subject of a minority ad hoc
member. Despite student body Secretary-elect Mike Webb’s
eloquent statement of his reasons for opposing such a posi-
tion, the committee barged along with the motion. The ques-
tion arose of how the EC would determine what a ‘‘minority”’
is. ‘‘Non-white” was the definition first-year law represen-
tative James Crutchfield lamely offered. It quickly became
clear from the discussion that the position was intended for a
black student. The word “‘tokenism’’ came up, and it struck
us as rather ironic that the EC finds it offensive that the
South African government treats blacks differently than it
does other citizens, but feels that to do so at Washington and
Lee would be somehow acceptable. This is 1985 — we thought
treating blacks differently from everyone else was
something we’d gotten over years ago. Webb’s election to one
of the top three posts in the student body is clear testimony to
that. The ad hoc minority motion failed, but the damage had
been done merely by raising the question.

We began by taking note of positive actions by the commit-
tee, and it is on that note that we will conclude, since their ef-
fort to provide leadership is a refreshing, welcome change.
Their endorsement of Bob Tomaso’s courageous, articulate
minority report to the Drug Policy Review Committee’s
proposal was a highly constructive move that will give
Tomaso’s arguments added credibility as the faculty debates
the report. We agree that for the University to throw up its
hands and say that it cannot punish drug use or possession
would have a host of consequences the drug committee never
intended. We hope the faculty will consider carefully
Tomaso’s insightful response, and think twice before it votes
to tacitly condone illegal activity by its students.

(An aside: Several members of the EC have gone out of
their way to emphasize that they’re not opposed to personal
drug use. What’s wrong with being opposed to personal drug
use? Why isn’t anyone willing to take that position? Perhaps
to do so would be to invite hyprocrisy. )

After a lengthy detour, the EC is back on the right road. We
hope it will proceed carefully and thoughtfully, and leave the
hot-rodding to others.

Ties, art & Tilley - no match

To the Editors:

At the risk of taking Mr. Tilley’s
most recent “My View’’ column too
seriously, I find I cannot let it slip by
without comment. I do not suggest
that every student at W&L be school-
ed in every subject offered here, but I
find it a sad comment on the narrow-
ed scope of W&L’s educational goals
that any student can graduate from
this institution still boasting of his
—dare I say it? — ignorance in any
area. Perhaps Mr. Tilley should have
had his questions answered by some-
one more knowledgeable than
himself before he facetiously criticiz-
ed those admittedly funky artworks.

At least then his opinion would be an
informed one. I sincerely hope he will
some day broaden his education so he
may come to appreciate (if still
dislike) what he’s been missing.

Also I must remark on Mr. Tilley’s
truly humorous treatment of the
well-worn tie issue. I agree with him
that ties may “inspire a sense of
seriousness, of academia, of honor,
of gentlemanliness and of
magnanimity.”” I do not believe,
however, that they inspire any more
than a sense of these. The actual em-
bodiment of these virtues has nothing
whatsoever to do with what you
wear.

What, after all, is the real reason
130 students are enrolled in the popes
course? Is it because they get to wear
ties? As any good W&L spring term
student knows, the common name for
that course is not ‘Popes for the
Academically Serious, Honorable,
Magnanimous Gentleman.”

I fear that were it up to Mr. Tilley,
W&L would become the first Conser-
vative Artless College in the country.
I wonder if he is aware that the of-
ficial W&L tie sold by the University
Bookstore is polyester.

Famine raised awareness, money

To the Editors:

We would like to publicly thank
those members of the Washington
and Lee community who either par-
ticipated in or sponsored others in
last weekend’s Planned Famine and
those who gave up their dinner meal
last Tuesday night at the dining hall
in order to raise money to fight world
hunger.

Though money is still being col-
lected, we estimate that around $500
was raised for World Vision, an
international, Christian humanitar-

ian agency, through the Planned
Famine by the dozen students who
fasted. At the dining hall, the raw
food costs that were saved when 238
students gave up their dinner
amounted to $300 that is to be donated
to the Rockbridge Area Relief
Association. In addition, the Student
Association for Black Unity has
donated $240 to World Vision in order
to fight hunger throughout the world.

Special thanks must be given to
President John D. Wilson, Jerry Dar-
rell, Patrick Hinely, Mayor Phillips

Pot shot off target

To the Editors:

, Last week an article was published
concerning a recent, rather impor-
tant addition to the George Wash-
ington material. It was called the
greatest contribution to Wash-
ington’s papers in this generation,
and it was found here at Washington
and Lee. By the way, this is the same
Washington that the University is
named for, and who also happened to
be our first president. I have no com-
plaint with the article itself. The find
is obviously a significant historical
achievement. :

My complaint lies with the snide
remarks made by the editors at the
beginning and end of the article.
After careful reading of the article, I
cannot perceive any evidence which
indicates that George Washington

(the Father of our country, re-
member) married because ‘‘the
Widow Custis was loaded.”’

I am sure that whoever was
responsible for those remarks
thought that they would be quite
humorous. What strikes me as a little
out of place is that I am quite sure
that if such evidence had been found
concerning Robert E. Lee (who
everyone knows should have been the
father of our country) no such snide
remarks would have been made. It
seems to me slightly incongruous
that Washington and Lee, a Universi-
ty based on tradition, should give so
much respect to one founder, and so
little to another.

IU pres questions story

To the Editors:

During this year The Phi has writ-
ten a number of fair and accurate ar-
ticles on the Independent Union.
Thus it was quite a surprise when I
read your article last week. Put sim-
ply, I consider this article to be a
poor example of journalism as well
as misleading.

At least part of the problem is the
way many of my quotes were taken
out of context. The article, at one
point, quotes me as agreeing with a
statement made by Mr. Darrell. This
is impossible as, during the entire
course of the interview, I was never
once informed about any complaints
regarding the Fancy Dress party.
Thus I could not have agreed to any
statement. Furthermore, our ‘“‘self
described credibility problem’? was
taken out of context. I was referring
to our difficulty organizing events
down the road, not our own on-
campus activities.

It would be dishonest of me to say
the IU has not had problems this
year. We have. But what school or-
ganization hasn’t. Considering the
newness of the IU and the problems
we experienced last year, I would say
that we have done better than expect-
ed. Our IM teams have drawn enthu-
siastic support. Our cold test file has
grown. We are even conducting fund
raising this term and hope to in-
crease our social activities next year.
Sadly, The Phi chose to neglect these
facts, focusing almost entirely on the
negative. While the editors saw fit to
mention that we no longer keep regu-
lar office hours, they failed to men-
tion that we will be happy to arrange
a time to use the cold test file. All in-
dependents need to do is leave a note
in our box. And most of our activities

have been well organized and attend-
ed.

With regard to the FD party, I
would say again that you did a poor
job. Not only was this never mention-
ed to me during the interview, but no
one saw fit to investigate the SAB’s
role despite the fact that they lost the
most. A number of factors contribut-
ed to the ‘‘disaster.”” Among these
were poor coordination with the SAB
and the fact that a number of frater-
nities opened their parties that night.
As I mentioned, we are still new at
this and all things considered we
have done quite well this year. I
would like to take this opportunity to
thank both Mr. Darrell and the SAB
for their support and apologize for
their losses. I would also like to thank
all those people who have supported
us this year and made it, on balance,
asuccess. I am sure next year will be
even better. To say otherwise deni-
grates these efforts and gives a false
impression of the IU.

In conclusion I would just like to
say that, as the IU improves, one can
only hope The Phi will as well. Re-
member, you guys have had a lot
longer to get your act together. I
guess to expect an apology or clarifi-
cation would be expecting the impos-
sible?

Editors’ note: Hardly. In checking
our reporter's notes, we discovered that
the quotation was taken out of context.
The reporter did not ask Cornelius
about the Fancy Dress party because he
did not realize that information would
be given as much attention by the edi-
tors as it was. The Ring-tum Phi apolo-
gizes for these oversights.

Our hope is that more students and
faculty will get involved in dealing
with the issues of hunger, poverty
and injustice throughout the world in
the near future. We prayerfully await
a renewal and growth of interest in
Christ’s command to have compas-
sion for the poor.

Legalities
misplaced

 

Last Thursday we saw the
Honor System work — with disap-
pointing as well as heartening
observations. When the defense
advocate told the jury that they
had to reach a verdict “beyond a
reasonable doubt,” I thought he
was making one of his underhand-
ed psychological plays and was
sure the EC would object, since
the White Book says “resolve any
reasonable doubt in favor of the
accused.”’ Instead, the E.C. ad-
vocate repeated ‘‘beyond a
reasonable doubt.’’ I could not
believe this; there is obviously an
enormous difference between the
two phrases. The phrase in the
White Book was carefully chosen
to suit the spirit of the Honor
System; it places the confidence
of justice on the member of the
“student generation” who is
voting, not on the language of the
code. For the defense advocates
and especially the EC not to know
the White Book — or understand it
better — is an abomination. It is a
further abomination that the SBA
president, who was presiding,
didn’t notice, or at least didn’t cor-
rect, the error(s). This fatal slip
into legal language also illustrates
the danger of placing too much
value on legal training in the ex-
ecution of the Honor System.

The legal mentality of
mistakenly using technicalities
and strategies in dealing with
honor also surfaced in the admit-
tance of the lie detector. The very
notion of using a paid “expert”
and a machine as evidence in an
honor hearing is horrifying and
mocks the spirit of the system.

But it was heartening to see the
system work despite hindrances;
it was also heartening to see the
jury have the good sense and con-
viction to ignore the defense ad-
vocate’s shrewd and eloquent
remarks, which were superfluous
and nearly underhanded in their
aim. The jury reaffirmed where
the ‘‘buck stops’ in the Honor
System; within the individuals
who live it.

 

 

 

Living with the past

MY VIEW

Pensec

 

During the fall term I had the op-
portunity to take Religion 204: The
Jewish Tradition. This course was
helpful in that it touched upon most
areas in the history of Judaism. Un-
fortunately, as a class, we did not

discuss Judaism in relationship to.

nationalism or World War II. We
were required to do a term paper,
and looking back, I have mixed feel-
ings about my choice of topics:
“‘Night”’ by Elie Wiesel.

I had read the slim volume before,
but that did not diminish the force of
the punch I received after reading it
for the second and third time. I am
glad that I read it and believe that it
should be mandatory for all students.
The subject matter, however,and the
way Wiesel describes it are anything
but pleasant.

“Night” tells the story of the
growth and development of a young
Jewish boy during the final days of
World War II. He and his family are
placed in a concentration camp
where, among the atrocities, the boy
stands by helpless as his father dies.

There is an earlier scene where,
after his father has been selected by
Dr. Mengele to die, the father gives
his son all his earthly goods, which

item. The boy looks upon these gifts
as his inheritance. His father, by a
chance of fate, did not die that day,
and yet I am hard put to call that for-
tunate.

Today, 40 years later, we, the
children of the post-war world, have
inherited quite a legacy from our
ancestors, and the time has arrived
for us to come to terms with our in-
heritance.

What happened during World War
II can never be forgotten nor should
it, lest history repeat itself. But can’t
we find it in ourselves to forgive?

I sympathize with the millions of
Jews and Christians who were placed
in concentration camps but people
have a tendency of living with the
past.

President Reagan has said that the
SS were victims of the Third Reich
just as much as those who were tor-
tured and killed during the war. Mr.
President, with all due respect, I do
not agree. If there are any Germans
who are the victims of the SS, they
are the children of the SS. Those who
took part in the brutalities of the con-
centration camps will have to be held |
accountable, but their children |
should not be. With each succeeding .
generation we are growing further
away from World War II. Let us hope
that we can grow closer together to |
maintain whatever shreds of place |
we have left.

Health, music ready for fall

Infirmary
changes said
not drastic

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

 

With coeducation just four months
away, the Washington and Lee Infir-
mary and Student Health Committee
have decided on a few changes for
the fall. The changes will be notice-
able, even though they will not be
drastic because female law students
and exchange students have been at
W&L for several years.

The most significant change will be
a physical reconstruction of the
wards in the infirmary, providing ad-
ditional privacy, according to Uni-
versity Physician F.A. Feddeman.
Although that move will reduce the
bed capacity of the infirmary from 15
to 10 beds, Feddeman says that won't
be a problem in that the infir-
mary hasn’t even been to capacity in
the time he has been here.

Other changes the infirmary plans
are in the services it provides. A
female has been hired for women
who might feel uncomfortable talk-
ing with a male psychologist. A gyne-

IFC proposes midweek party

 

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

Several Wednesday night party
rule changes aimed at improving re-
lations among fraternities and with
the faculty were proposed at Tues-
day’s Interfraternity Council meet-
ing.

IFC President Jaimie Hayne sug-
gested that an individual fraternity
be allowed to sponsor a maximum of
two midweek parties a month and
that parties be limited to two partici-
pating fraternities.

 

Coeducation:

83

What Will it Mean?

cologist, John D. Harralson of Lex-
ington, has been informed of the pos-
sibility of an increase in referrals.
Feddeman said he and his colleague,
Robert M. Pickral, probably will
handle most of the women’s needs.

Though the infirmary will not be
providing birth control pills or de-
vices in the fall, it will continue its
current programs in that area. Such
services include counseling female
students and providing prescriptions
for birth control. Those programs
will continue on an informal basis,
according to Feddeman.

Birth control for men has never
been requested and will not be offer-
ed in the future, Feddeman said.

Changes already implemented in
the infirmary include an increase in
literature available for a variety of il-
Inesses and conditions and the ‘“‘rea-
son for visit’’ category on the infir-
mary’s sign-in sheet. That category
was eliminated after a woman law
student brought to the infirmary
staff’s attention that it is a violation
of privacy for the student to have to
provide such information publicly.

 

A particular fraternity, then,
would be allowed two parties a month
at its own house and two more at
other fraternities, for a maximum of
four parties a month.

No other Washington and Lee stu-
dents would be allowed to attend a
given party, including independents
and members of other fraternities.

Hayne said this proposal would
“create more unity between the
houses.”’

“By restricting the size and the
amount of parties, the faculty will
be more cooperative,”’ he continued.

A second proposal would require

Vandalism reported;
acts may be related

 

From Staff Reports

 

Several
students and Lexington residents
were hit last week with a series of
acts of vandalism that Police Chief
L.O. Sutton says were probably
related.

eSenior Mike Shelton’s Volkswagen
Rabbit suffered $150 in damage
Saturday night when its right front
and right rear tires were slashed on
West Preston Street.

eFreshman Richard Bernstein’s
Mazda RX-7 sustained $100 in
damage when the front and rear
windshield wipers and radio antenna
were broken off Thursday night.

eAssistant Fire Chief Brian Causey
had the sidewall of his left front truck

“‘T think all of these are related,”’
Sutton said, noting that the methods,
locations and times of the incidents
were quite similar. He said it’s been
“quite a while” since there’s been a
similar string of acts of vandalism.

Sutton said police have few clues in
the cases. ‘‘There were no witnesses,
they didn’t take anything with
them...{and] they didn’t leave finger-
prints,’’ he said. “With this type of

he said.

Part-time
voice teacher
to be hired

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

 

A part-time voice teacher will be
added to the University’s music
department next year to accom
modate women students interested in
taking voice lessons, according to
music Professor Robert Stewart

All other department programs
will remain as they are, he said, ad
ding that any need for further change
will be evaluated on a year-to-year
basis.

Although many of the women ac
cepted for admission next fall have
indicated having a musical ability of
one kind or another, Stewart said,
“We don’t want to jump to conclu-
sions because of lists.’’

“Music is an interest,’ Stewart
said. ‘‘It’s not what they’re here for.’
He added that the women will be at
Washington and Lee to receive an
education and to prepare for careers
If many of them do not continue with
their musical interests, he said he
would not be surprised

that fraternity members be required
to provide their own alcohol for Wed
nesday night parties. Kegs would be
forbidden, even if a few members
wanted to bring one.

Hayne and other members of the
IFC said they supported the sugges-
tion. ‘‘I think this would be a really
good idea,’’ Hayne said. ‘‘By imple
menting this policy, the IFC would be
making an active proposal instead of

Stewart referred to a list of this
year’s freshmen who indicated some
musical ability or interest in high
school and noted that only a small
number continued with music at
Wé&L

Of the women interested in music
and considering applying to W&L in-
terviewd by Stewart, most of them
played the piano or string or wood-
wind instruments or sang

Among the plans Stewart has for
the music department, provided
there is sufficient interest, are a
string ensemble and the addition of
woodwind instruments to the W&L
jazz and brass ensembles.

As far as vocal groups go, Stewart
said there are no plans for changes at
this time. ‘‘The W&L Glee Club will
continue as all-male,” he said, add
ing that women who wish to sing will
be able to join a different group

“We are going to start to develop a
fine university chorus for mixed
voices,’’ he said.

More women than men seem to be
involved in singing, Stewart said. ‘‘In
high school, the boys are usually in
volved in athletics and macho ac-
tivities,’ he added, and the singing
groups that seem to attract males in
high school are those that perform
popular selections

“We will take it year to year,’
Stewart said. ‘‘We will do what the
students indicate to fill the need.”’

changes

always making reactive ones.”’

Hayne noted that under the upcom-
ing increase in the Virginia drinking
age, this could prevent fraternities
from being responsible for providing
liquor to minors

“It would take a lot of weight and
pressure off the fraternities,” he
said

A third proposal would end all mid-
week parties at 2a.m.

Bargain

Library sells unneeded books

 

By STEVE CONNER
Staff Reporter

The University Library has raised
more than $1,000 by selling 2,600
books since March 19.

This year’s book sale is the first at
the University Library and the first
book sale at Washington and Lee
since 1978.

‘The purpose of the book sale is to
allow readers to buy books at a
moderate price to add to their
reading collection and to stimulate-
further reading habits,’ said Univer-
sity Librarian Maurice Leach.

Book prices range from 5 cents to
one dollar. Books for sale have been
placed on carts in the library lobby.

Leach said that the books for sale
are duplicates of books the library
already has in its collection and
books received as donations from

Students who find insurance, bank-
ing or clothing brochures in their
mailboxes may not be aware that the
University has an ongoing policy
with local businesses regarding the
distribution of students’ addresses.

According to Thomas C. Imeson II,
director of the W&L computer cen-
ter, where mailing labels are printed,
all information in the Register of
Faculty, Staff and Students is
‘presumed to be public’’ and ‘‘can be
distributed upon request.”’

But Imeson said permission to dis-
tribute such lists to interest groups
outside the University is controlled
by the office that deals with a partic-
ular group.

For example, he said, the compu-
ter center recently released the
names and home addresses of all stu-
dents to development officials for the
Borden Commons condominium pro-
ject. Imeson said he first contacted

Library’s colleetion and what books
are to be disposed of.

The type of books for sale range
from history to literature to hunting
and fishing.

Washington and Lee senior Mike
Shelton and sophomore Erik Curren
seem to be two of the top book
buyers, Leach said.

“T thought the book sale was a
great idea,’’ Shelton said. Shelton, a
history major, has bought more than
100 books and says he pians to read
them all.

Sophomore Richard Graves has
bought more than 15 books and said
he hopes to buy more before the sale
ends.

‘The sale was a great idea, and the
prices are wonderful,” Graves said.

Leach said the majority of the
books had been purchased by Wash-
ington and Lee students, but the
books for sale can be bought by
anyone.

The book sale wi!l probably end by
the end of this week, Leach said.

“‘Any books left over will be sold at
a larger reduction and any books not
sold will probably be trashed,’
Leach said.

the Office of Dean of Students to ob-
tain permission to give out the ad-
dresses.

Brochures advertising the sale of
the condos were subsequently mailed
to the parents of students.

We try to be very particular in
providing that information off cam-
pus,” Imeson said.

“It’s not this office’s judgment
what purposes are worthwhile,’’ he
added.

Besides the Borden Commons in-
terest group, Imeson said he remem-
bers one other time when students’
names were printed out for an off-
campus group. Imeson said he re-
ceived permission through the Office
of Dean of Students two years ago to
distribute students’ names to a group
conducting a housing survey.

Penelope C. Henneman, secretary
to the Dean of Students, said the lists
were released to the two groups this
year and two years ago in the interest
of the students.

Both groups, she said, were inter-
ested in providing information re-

Local merchants use student directory

garding student housing — a major
concern of the Dean of Students.

A spokeswoman for the Registrar’s
Office also called the Register of
Faculty, Staff and Students “public
information,’ and said the policy
there is to give out the directory to
local businessmen who go to the of-
fice to pick it up. The office does not
mail the directory out.

According to Imeson, four local
business establishments have ongo-
ing agreements with the University
regarding their receiving computer-
printed labels of students’ addresses.

Bean Insurance, College Town
Shop, Alvin-Dennis and the linen ser-
vice in competition with University
Cleaners, which Imeson said changes
every year, are the four establish-
ments that receive students’ address-
es.

Henneman said the Office of Dean
of Students every year gives a com-
puter printout of the names and home
addresses of incoming freshmen to
local banks. She said there is no fee
and called the action a ‘“‘goodwill ges-

ture between the college and the
banks.”

According to Henneman, the of-
fice’s policy is to give the same infor-
mation to each bank. She said she ex-
pects the University to provide a
newly opened bank in the Lexington
area with an identical list that will be
distributed to the other four banks
during the summer.

On-campus interest groups, such
as the Admissions Office, Summer
Programs Office or fraternities, are
able to obtain computer printouts of
addresses of alumni or current stu-
dents by paying a small fee.

The price is $.015 per label, with a
minimum charge of $1.

We charge everybody the same,”’
including the businesses, Imeson
said.

Credit card brochures, which seem
to find their way to seniors’ mail-
boxes this time of year, get no help
from the University.

“How the credit card companies
get their information I just don’t
know,”’ Imeson said.

Revenue sharing fails; city to resume annexation effort

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

The city of Lexington will proceed
with its plans to annex a portion of
Rockbridge County, Mayor Charles

F. Phillips Jr. announced Tuesday in
the wake of a failure by the city and
county to reach a revenue-sharing
agreement.

Virginia has an arrangement uni-
que among states in which cities are
not part of counties. They can there-

fore increase their revenue base by
annexing land that previously was
under county control. Hostile annex-
ations are sometimes avoided
through revenue-sharing agreements
between two localities.

Such an agreement was reached

EC supports apartheid study

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

A resolution urging the Board of
Trustees to study the school’s in-
volvement with firms dealing with
the South African government was
endorsed by the Executive Commit-
tee on Monday night by an 8-1-1 vote.

The petition, sponsored by the
Washington and Lee Campaign
Against Apartheid, asks that appro-
priate action be taken if it is found
that the school helps finance or does
business with such companies, ‘‘Such
support is morally unacceptable and
inconsistent with the tradition and
principles of the University,” the pe-
tition says.

Junior representative Pat Hayden
voted against the endorsement be-
cause he said it was inconsistent for
the group to say it was only asking
the trustees to study the matter, and
yet also state in the petition that the
support was ‘‘morally unaccepta-
ble.”’ Hayden said he was opposed to

Ad hoc

 

divestment but that he did not sup-
port apartheid.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers abstained from the vote.
Some members of the committee ob-
jected when Caruthers said he want-
ed to read the petition before he voted
on it. ‘I don’t know enough about the
situation to vote right now,”’
Caruthers said.

Junior Ted DeLaney, appearing
with junior Everett Hamilton on be-
half of the Campaign Against Apar-
theid, explained that the purpose of
the petition was to create a forum for
students to come together and
discuss apartheid

“Essentially, it’s a moral appeal,”
DeLaney said. “We must look at
apartheid from an ethical angle.
We're asking you to look in your cons-
cience — to ask, ‘Is this institution in-
volved with the South African gov-
ernment and do we support it?’ ”’

DeLaney said University President
John D. Wilson is aware of the organ-
ization’s efforts, but does not neces-

sarily support or not support the
drive.

The trustees invest the school’s
money as part of a group of colleges,
DeLaney explained, and so is not
sure exactly where all W&L funds
are invested.

DeLaney said his group found that
WA&L is associated with IBM and that
IBM had once manufactured compu-
ters for the South African govern-
ment. When Law Professor William
S. Geimer contacted the corporation
on behalf of the group, however, he
found it had stopped making the com-
puters two years ago.

“This way, we didn’t have mud on
our face,’’ DeLaney said. “In this
way, we avoided an embarrassing
situation by finding out the facts
first, before acting.”

DeLaney said the EC had an obli-
gation to oppose the South African
government. ‘‘Consider the ethics of
the EC and the University,” he said.
“The ethics of apartheid are the an-
tithesis of the traditions of the EC
and W&L.”’

appointment, it could anyway.

Crutchfield made the motion to appoint a ‘‘non-white,”’

minority ad hoc member to the SCC.

Secretary-elect Mike Webb said such a member would
not be necessary. ‘‘I don’t speak for the 22 blacks on
campus, but I don’t feel that I need a black ad hoc mem-
ber to feel I’m being represented fairly,”’ he said.

Tomaso, who supported the resolution, said, ‘‘Myself,
{junior representative] Mike [Black] and Cole went
to the...SABU house and talked to the members and this
problem has to be addressed from what I saw. It became
clear in the meeting that they perceive a problem.”’

Dalton, who opposed the resolution, said, ‘‘Do you feel
that when a black man is in front of the EC that you can
overlook the fact that he is black? I feel that I can.”

“Before, we never knew when we fouled up,’’ Tomaso

said. “It was as if we were left alone and told we had

committed a violation after we had already done it.”’

“T realize that it is dangerous to say what's a violation
and what isn’t, but I don’t think we have made a big
statement,’’ he added.

The EC did vote to change the wording of one of the
major offenses, ‘‘theft offenses and fraud offenses refer-
red to the Student Control Committee by the Executive
Committee’’ to ‘‘offenses referred to the Student Control
Committee by the Executive Committee.”

They also recommended moving “the use of racial,
ethnic, religious or sexual slurs directed to an individ-
ual’’ from a major offense to a minor offense.

between Lexington and Rockbridge
last May. Under the agreement,
Lexington would have received seven
cents for each $100 of county real
estate in return for dropping its
annexation intentions.

The state Commission on Local
Government, however, issued a re-
port in February saying the agree-
ment was unfavorable to Lexington
and would harm the city economical-
ly in the fuuture. They encouraged
the localities to renegotiate, setting
Tuesday as the deadline for a new
agreement.

None was able to be reached, how-
ever, as Phillips announced at a news
conference with Board of Supervi-
sors Chairman Daniel R. Snider.

Girard

() Continued from Page 1

Subpoenaed in the case were five
witnesses and Girard’s long distance
telephone records for December
through March.

Four witnesses for the Common-
wealth testified to this chain of
events leading to Girard’s arrest (the
fifth witness did not testify) :

Sgt. Wayne Straub of the Lexington
Police Department testified that he
received a tip Feb. 27 from an infor-
mant regarding a $1,453 money order
sent by Girard to Miami. The infor-
mant, whom Straub did not identify,
advised the Lexington Police Depart-
ment that the money might be pay-
ment for a shipment of narcotics at a
later date, according to the testi-
mony.

Acting on this tip, Straub contin-
ued, he contacted the Roanoke office
of Federal Express. Employees
there were asked to watch for pack-
ages to Lexington from Miami for
two specific people, one of whom was
Girard, according to testimony by
Gary Pratt, Roanoke operations
manager of Federal Express. When
Mann asked Pratt to identify the
other person, he said he did not
remember the name.

Straub testified that two days later,
he received a telephone call from
Pratt about a ‘‘questionable’’ pack-
age that had come in. Straub, in the
company of state police officers’
went to Roanoke to pick up the pack-
age. Girard was arrested later that
day.

In Roanoke, a state police drug dog
reacted to the envelope, Straub said.
Straub then accompanied Pratt and
the package to Lexington in a Feder-
al Express van. They then met with
Hall at the Thrifty Inn in Lexington,
where another drug dog twice ‘“‘alert-
ed’’ on the parcel, he said.

Pratt testified that after the pack-
age arrived in Roanoke, he called a
Lexington telephone number on the
address label to ask directions. He
said he was not sure whom to ask for
when he called the number.

“TI saw this package...to Babe
Ruth,” Pratt testified. “I almost
started laughing — you know, gimme
a break.” He said he asked for a “Mr.
Ruth,” but that the person on the
phone sounded confused and told
Pratt that he would have to speak to
the person’s roommate.

Pratt said he asked the second per-
son if he was ‘‘Gene or Gerald Gi-
rard” and that the person identified
himself as ‘‘Gene,” and told Pratt to
deliver the package to the East Lex-
ington store.

Both Straub and Hall testified that
they waited in the back room of the
store for Girard to pick up the pack-
age. Girard arrived at the store at
about 2 p.m., according to the offi-
cers and James Bowen, owner of the
store.

Bowen testified that Girard called
him the day before the arrest to ask if
he could have a package delivered to
the store and once about two hours
before the arrest to check whether a
package for him had been received.

After the officers arrived, they told
Bowen they had a package for Gi-
rard. The next time Girard called to
ask about his package, Bowen said he
told him he had a package for him.
Bowen said the officers instructed
him to go to the back room when Gi-
rard asked for his parcel.

W&L senior Roger Dunnavan, one
of two students who live with Girard,
had been subpoenaed to testify Fri-
day. At the start of the hearing, Ca-

 

baniss asked if Dunnavan was in the
courtroom, When no one responded,
Cabaniss asked Mann if he would
agree to enter in the record that
Dunnavan gave Girard a ride to the
store on March 1. Mann agreed, ad-
ding that the purpose of the trip was
to buy a soft drink.

Bowen testified that when Girard
entered the store, he looked around
and then left. After a moment, Bowen
said, Girard returned and took a soft
drink to the cash register, patted his
pockets as if looking for money, and
told Bowen that he had none.

According to Bowen, Girard then
asked if he could pay for the drink at
another time. Bowen said he told
Girard that was all right and then
asked him if he wanted his package.

Bowen said that he and Girard then
walked to the back room where
Straub, dressed in a Federal Express
uniform, and Hall, who was in his
sheriff’s uniform, were waiting.

“When we made eyeball contact,
he turned and ran,”’ Hall said, adding
that he called to Girard to stop but
that he refused. ‘I had to run as fast
as I could to catch him,” Hall said. “I
physically grabbed him to stop.”’

Hall said he and Girard returned to
the back room, where the officer
read Girard his rights and placed
him under arrest.

In his closing statement, Mann,
said, “‘There are so many problems
with this case that I can’t believe
we're here before the court.”

Girard did not call any witnesses,
but Mann cross-examined the
Commonwealth’s witnesses.

Cabaniss clarified the Common-
wealth’s position by saying the case
hinged on the legal term ‘‘dominion,
and control,” which Black’s Law dic-
tionary defines as relating ‘‘to au-
thority over what is not in one’s phy-
sical possession.”’

Washington and Lee Law Profes-
sor Roger D. Groot explained that es:
tablishing “dominion and control” is
necessary to convict a defendant for
“constructive possession” of an ob-
ject.

A person can be convicted on either
actual or constructive possession,
Groot said. ,

Staff Reporter Mike Stachura con-
tributed to this story.

‘Here’s the beef — on the beef in Lexington

 

By TED BYRD
Staff Reporter

 

The cheapest burgers

 

Whether you're attracted by McDonald’s ‘“‘Two all
beef patties...” Wendy’s ‘‘Where’s the Beef?” or
Lloyd's location near campus, a variety of hamburgers
ranging in price from $.52 cents to $3.75 are available in
Lexington.

Three Lexington restaurants known particularly for
their burgers are Wendy’s, Lloyd’s of Lexington and
McDonald's. All three have simple hamburgers and
cheeseburgers in addition to “glorified burgers,”’ which
ie be garnished with anything from a special sauce to

acon.

Wendy’s has four burgers that a customer may choose
from, and all are made with fresh ground meat that is
formed into patties in the restaurant, according to store
manager Joan Plogger, Wendy’s has three basic bur-
gers: the single, which is made with one quarter pound
patty; the double, made with two patties; and the triple,
made with three patties. Wendy’s one ‘‘glorified burger’’

‘is a bacon cheeseburger that is made with a quarter

pound patty, cheese and bacon. All of the burgers come

* with a choice of mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles, onion, let-

tuce and mustard. Tomatoes and cheese are available at

_an extra cost of 10 and 20 cents. The single costs $1.25,

the double $2.05, the triple $2.55 and the bacon cheese-

-_ burger $1.80.

McDonald's, Wendy's chief competition, according to
Plogger, offers a wider variety of pre-made burgers at

"prices ranging from $.52 for a hamburger to $1.39 for a

Quarter Pounder with cheese. A McDonald’s hamburger

or a cheeseburger, which costs $.62, comes with ketchup,
mustard, onion and pickles. A Quarter Pounder, made
with a one quarter pound patty, costs $1.25 and comes
with the same toppings as the hamburger. The McDon-
ald’s Big Mac, for $1.35, is made with two hamburger-
size patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and
onions, just like the commercial says. McDonald’s also
has a double hamburger and a double cheeseburger,

 

Contact sponsors

which are the same as their regular counterparts except
that they come with two patties. The double cheese-
burger, which usually costs $1.25, is on special until May
5 for $1.15. Both double burgers usually have to be asked
for and made specially. McDonald’s hamburger patties
arrive at the restaurant pre-formed and frozen.

Both Wendy's and McDonald's say they seek a general
clientele.

Lloyd’s of Lexington has a menu similar to McDon-
ald’s except that it features a double bacon cheesebur-
ger. The basic Lloyd’s burger comes with mustard, ket-
chup and pickles, and lettuce and tomato $.10 extra, but
shift manager David Felts said anything can be put on
them. The hamburgers and $.59 and the cheeseburgers
$.69. The patties are made with fresh meat and weigh
between 2'% and three ounces. Lloyd’s double bacon
cheeseburger, for $1.69, is made with two hamburger
patties, bacon and cheese. The Big Quarter, also $1.69, is
made with a quarter pound patty and comes with let-
tuee, tomato, mayonnaise, onion, pickles and cheese.
Lloyd’s basically seeks a student clientele.

Three other restaurants that specialize in or feature
hamburgers, and may not be as well known, are The
Palms, Estelle’s and Kenney’s of Lexington.

The Palms specializes in the ‘‘glorified burger.”’ All
burgers are made with one-third pound patties, and any-
thing you want can be put on them, according to man-
ager Bob Campbell. The meat is usually fresh, but oc-
casionally is frozen. The Palms’ best-selling burgers,
Campbell said, are the Beta and the Heart of Texas. The
Beta comes with tomato, onion, lettuce, cheddar cheese
and bacon and is served on a Kaiser roll. The Heart of
Texas burger comes with bacon, cheddar cheese and the

Palms’ barbecue sauce. Both are $3.75.

Other burgers offered include a Muffin Burger, which
comes with bacon and cheddar on a toasted English Muf-
fin, and is also $3.75 and a Plain Jane, which comes with
blue cheese, is served on a Kaiser roll, and is $3.50. All
burgers are served with potato curls.

Estelle’s, like Wendy’s, uses only fresh meat for its

hamburgers. The burgers are made to order, and a plain
hamburger is $.80 and a cheeseburger $1. Both are made
with a quarter-pound patty, and lettuce and tomato are
$.15 extra. Three or four times a week Estelle’s also has
a bacon cheeseburger (quarter-pound patty, bacon and
cheese), iced tea, a choice of two vegetables, including
french fries and a piece of cake. Occasionally a Muzzi
Burger is also offered, which is a regular hamburger
topped with Mozzarella cheese, a strip of bacon, lettuce,
tomato and mayonnaise. Estelle’s likes to cater to stu-
dents, according to manager Michele Campbell, ‘“‘and as
long as they come in and behave I think as much of one
as the other.”’

Kenny’s of Lexington, which is located behind the
Greyhound bus station, is probably the least known of
the restaurants included here. Its ground meat is usual-
ly fresh but occasionally frozen. The basic hamburger,
for $.70, is made with a two-ounce patty and comes with
Kenney’s special sauce, mustard and onion. A cheese-
burger, with the same extras, is $.80 . Lettuce, tomato
and mayonnaise is $.15 extra, and pickles are $.05 extra.
A Double K burger, for $1.25, is made with two patties on
a three-layer bun and comes with lettuce, Thousand Is-
land dressing and cheese. A Big K burger, $1.24, is made
with a quarter pound burger and comes with lettuce, to-
mato, mayonnaise, pickles and ketchup.

ed by psychology Professor David G.
Eimes and associate sociology Pro-
fessor O. Kendall White Jr. along
with George U. Carneal III, a 1983
W&L graduate currently pursuing
graduate studies at Yale University.

The study is based upon data col-
lected from a survey of 230 under-
graduate students from nine south-
western Virginia colleges and univer-
sities who completed a four-part
questionnaire.

LIDS

Prof finds religion lowers
-belief in ESP, ghosts

The respondents were asked about
the strength of their beliefs in the
Loch Ness monster, UFOs, the devil
and the efficacy of prayer, among
other items.

The W&L team concluded that the
non-religious paranormal beliefs
may be a functional alternative to
ordinary religion. But the findings
indicate that such beliefs generally
are not as strong as religious para-
normal beliefs and do not lead to the
personal emotional characteristics
that seem to be associated with
strong religious beliefs.

White recently was named the reci-
pient of a Mednick Fellowship for
research and advanced study.

White is one of 11 professors from
Virginia colleges to receive the fel-
lowships, offered through the Virgin-
ia Foundation for Independent Col-
leges, which administers the Mau-
rice L. Mednick Memorial Fund.

White will use the fellowship to con-
duct research in Utah this summer
on the social contradictions in Mor-
mon family life.

Updating the W&L Catalogue

‘They,’ ‘them’ replace ‘he,’ ‘him’; Rush section deleted

 

By ROB DORAIS
Staff Reporter

 

The 1985-86 University Catalogue
has a few changes from that of pre-
vious years, including references to
sex, fraternities and athletics.

Gender—specific nouns such as
“he” and ‘“‘him’’ have been replaced
by ‘‘they’’ and “‘them’”’ when refer-
ence is made to students in the cata-
log.

Jeffery G. Hanna, news office di-
rector and acting director of publica-
tions, said he “worked with trying to
make the language consistent, to re-
move references to gender.”’

“It was just something that needed
to be done,”’ he added.

Sections of the catalog are sent to
different individuals who are respon-
sible for making changes in each sec-
tion, Hanna said.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John re-
ceived the section on fraternities. He
said the section on Rush activities
was removed from the catalog be-
cause it was incorrect.

‘Rather than tying it down and be-
ing specific on changes that would be

made later,” the section was deleted
this year, he said.

Hanna said that the additions to the
section on athletics ‘‘clearly needed
to be consistent with the athletic de-
partment.’’ It contains a projection
for women’s sports that is necessar-
ily vague because the athletic depart-

ment wants to take the interests of
the entering women into account.

One out of five pictures in next
year’s catalog include women, com-
pared with one out of seven photos
last year.

Catalogs are available from the re-
gistrar’s office in Reid Hall.

Publications director, 60, dies today

Romulus T. Weatherman, director
of University publications and man-
aging editor of the alumni magazine,
died early this morning in a Charlot-
tesville hospital. He was 60.

Mr. Weatherman had been ill since
August, and news office director Jef-
fery G. Hanna had taken over many
of his duties, which included direct-
ing the production and editing of
W&L’s publications, including the U-
niversity Catalogue.

A 1950 graduate of Wake Forest U-
niversity, Mr. Weatherman worked
as a reporter, city editor and editor-
ial writer for newspapers in States-
ville, where he was born, and Win-
ston-Salem, N.C.

Mr. Weatherman also worked as
director of the office of information

of the Bowman Gray School of Medi-
cine at Wake Forest and as the direc-
tor of alumni activities and editor of
the Wake Forest magazine before
coming to W&L in 1967.

Hanna today cited Mr. Weather-
man’s ability to produce a wide
range of good materials with a rela-
tively small staff.

“He was a perfectionist who would
not settle for anything but the very
best work, especially from himself,”
Hanna said. ‘‘He was a very creative
person, and I think that showed in the
materials he produced.”

Mr. Weatherman is survived by his
wife, Mrs. Clara Belle LeGrand
Weatherman, and three children.

Funeral arrangments were incom-
plete this morning.

ODACs

BY LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

 

After a win over Division I Radford
and a dominating performance in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
championships, the Washington and
Lee tennis team can only be content
to sit on its record and wait for the
decision.

The ‘‘decision” is Monday’s an-
nouncement by the NCAA’s selection
committee of the eight teams that
will receive bids to the national
championships, being held at W&L in
two weeks.

Currently, W&L is ranked eighth in
the tennis coaches’ poll, one of the
criteria used to determine the eight
teams selected. But because the ac-
tual selection process is decided by a
special panel, and because there are
other teams very close to W&L, the
Generals are by no means assured a
spot at nationals.

The Generals concluded their con-
ference season on a very positive
note. Indeed, to say the team played
well at the ODAC championships is to
say that the nuclear arsenals of the
United States and the Soviet Union
have some destructive capability.

The team completely dominated
play, winning five of the six singles
championships and all three of the
doubles flights to capture 71 of the
possible 72 team points and claim its
sixth ODAC crown in the eight years
of the conference’s existence. All
told, W&L won 26 of 27 individual
matches it played during the week-
end.

Freshman David McLeod was in
top form at No. 1, rallying to beat
Lynchburg’s Max Henderson in the
finals, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4. For his efforts,
McLeod was named ODAC Player-of-
the-Year.

The Washington and Lee track
team finished second in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference out-
door championships at Wilson Field
last Saturday.

The Generals finished 21 points be-
hind first place Lynchburg, which
scored 169 points. Bridgewater fi-
nished third with 91 points. Emory
and Henry, Eastern Mennonite and
Roanoke finished fourth, fifth and
sixth respectively.

“We didn’t lose the meet,’’ said
head track coach Norris Aldridge,
“Lynchburg won it.’’ He added, ‘‘We
couldn’t have run any better than we
did. We got outstanding perfor-
mances from everyone! I am not dis-
appointed at all in the team.”’

This year’s team actually did bet-
ter than last year’s outdoor
championship team, scoring seven
more points at the meet.

W&L captured first place in three
events. Mark Pembroke won the 800
meters (1:57.9), Andy White took
first in the 110-meter hurdles (15.4)
and Tom Murray won the shot put

Maroons

Given a final score of 20-6, you'd
guess the Washington and Lee la-
crosse team might have just lost to
North Carolina, Johns Hopkins or
possibly Virginia.

How about Roanoke?

No, never.

Guess again.

W&L head coach Dennis Daly was
left speechless by Wednesday’s de-
feat at the hands of the No. 5-ranked
Division III Maroons.

‘Who would have believed it?’’ the
Generals’ second-year mentor said.
“T can’t explain it.”

“TI know this is a bad dream and I
didn’t wake up yet on Wednesday,
May 1,” Daly said.

W&L fell behind early. The Ma-
roons raced to an 8-1 lead in the first
21 minutes of play and never looked
back from there.

Roanoke dominated play through-
out the game. The Maroons had the
edge in ground balls (73-49), faceoffs
(20-9) and shots (44-25).

“We just got outplayed,” Daly
said. ‘‘We played badly, and they
played well.”

Roanoke head coach John Pirro,
who got his first win over W&L in his
four years at the Maroon helm (Roa-
noke has beaten W&L twice before, in
1978 and 1979), said the victory was

“a big momentum builder’’ for his
team as it heads toward the Division
III national tournament, but indi-
cated that ‘‘anytime you beat W&L in
Lexington, whether you are 10-0 or
0-10, it’s a big win.”’

Pirro cited the play of goalie Bill
Pilat (19 saves). ‘‘He did an excellent

JACK MESSERLY ... ODAC No. 3 singles champ

Sophomore No. 2 Roby Mize was
tested by Hampden-Sydney’s Rock
Godsy before winning the finals 6-2,
6-7, 6-1. Freshman Jack Messerly,
who had suffered through a slump
most of the year, showed that his
game of spin variation and control is
back, losing only four games on the
way to the title at No. 3.

At No. 4, senior captain Andy Har-

give ‘best,

(45’ 9”).

Chris McGowan set a new W&L re-
cord in the 400 meters with his third-
place time of 49.9 seconds:

Although the team’s season is now
over, several Generals will compete
this weekend at the James Madison
Invitational and next weekend at the
University of Virginia Invitational in
their attempts to qualify for the
NCAA Division III National Cham-
pionships. Mark Pembroke will be
trying to make the qualifying time
for the 800 meters; he needs to run
the distance in 1:53.3. Andy White
will be trying to qualify for the 110-
meter hurdles. In addition to Pem-
broke and White, Townes Pressler,
Tom Murray, John Carder and John
White will also participate in these
meets in their attempts to qualify for
the nationals.

With the season over, the Generals
have fallen short of accomplishing
both of the team’s pre-season goals.
The Generals did capture the indoor
title, but failed to repeat as the out-
door champ. Senior captain Chris
Ives said, ‘‘Everybody did the best
that they could do. We knew that we
gave our best and we can’t be upset
about that.”

W&L ‘9’ shocks top-rated L-burg
in first round of ODAC tourney

 

By WILLIAM KING

Stop the presses!

After suffering through a 5-18
regular season and a last-place finish
in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, the Washington and Lee
baseball Generals snubbed their col-
lective noses at the odds yesterday
afternoon and beat Lynchburg, 8-5, to
advance to the semifinal round of the
ODAC tournament.

W&L broke up a 4-4 contest in the
seventh inning with four runs to beat
the Hornets, the ODAC regular sea-
son champion and the nation’s
seventh-ranked team.

Sophomore pitcher Bill Schoettel-
kotte got his first win as a W&L
hurler in the upset.

The spectacular seventh saw a
lead-off double by Chip Hutchins,
who went four-for-five on the day.
After two outs, a walk to Adam
Yanez was followed by a Bill Curtiss
triple, a Ricky Zahn single and an
Alex Sutton double to register the
four runs.

The Generals will face Bridge-

water in Saturday afternoon’s semi-

final. The finals are slated for Satur-
day evening.

In other action last week, W.&L
closed out its regular season by drop-
ping a doubleheader to Randolph-
Macon in Ashland and splitting a dou-
bleheader with Radford at home.

Against R-M, W&L got off to a good
start in the first game, only to see the
Yellow Jackets capitalize on six Gen-
eral errors and win going away, 12-2.

R-M knotted the score at 2-2 in the
bottom of the second on a two-out,
two-run homer off W&L starter Bill
Schoettelkotte and went ahead in the
third 5-2 by scoring three runs on a
pair of walks, a single and a double.

W&L cut the lead to 5-3 in the four-
th, but the Yellow Jackets responded
with two runs of their own in the fifth.

The Maroon loss came on the heels
of the Generals’ 18-12 victory over
Bucknell on Saturday, ending a 56-
day losing streak.

W&L led throughout the game and

to 12-9. Jeff Mason, Bill Holmes and
Rod Santomassimo scored three un-

win,

“Tam very pleased that we finally

Zahn in the sixth to make the score
7-4, but R-M quickly ended the possi-
bility of a W&L rally by scoring twice
in the bottom half of the inning. The
Generals managed to add a run inthe
seventh, leaving the score 9-5.

Schoettlekotte went the distance
for W&L, surrendering nine runs (six
earned) and 10 hits while striking out
four.

In the second game, the Generals
again started strongly only to fade in
the later innings. W&L scored twice
in the second on singles by Finkels-
tein, Bill Curtiss, Ricky Zahn and
Chuck Nelson to lead 2-0, but again
botched a possible big inning by leav-
ing the bases loaded.

W&L took an early 1-0 lead after
Chip Hutchins opened the game with
a double and scored on Milam Tur-
ner’s single. The Generals appeared
to be on the verge of a big inning but
failed to score a run after loading the
bases with one out.

R-M tied the game in the bottom of
the first and took the lead for good in
the third when it scored three runs on
a solo home run, a single and two er-
rors.

W&L cut the deficit to 5-2 in the
fifth when Hutchins led off with a sin-
gle, went to third on Turner's single
and scored on Hugh Finkelstein’s
sacrifice fly. - |

R-M killed all hope of a Generals’
comeback in the bottom of the fifth
when it scored three runs on four con-
secutive singles off W&L starter Billy
White, making the score 8-2.

R-M turned the game into a blow-
out in the sixth by scoring four runs
to make the final score 12-2.

White pitched 514 innings before
being relieved by Peter Detlefs in the
sixth. He allowed 12 runs (eight of
which were earned), nine hits and
struck out seven.

W&L saw its losing streak extend-
ed to five games in the opener of its
doubleheader with Radford, losing a
tough 5-3 decision.

Radford scored once in the first in-
ning against freshman Eric Acra,

One is too many

 

who was making his first start of the
season. W&L tied the game in the
second when Curtiss singled with one
out. Pinch runner Mike Suttle stole
second and scored on a pair of Rad-
ford errors.

The Highlanders moved back into
the lead 2-1 in the fourthe’”’, but W&L
bounced back with two runs in the
bottom of the inning to lead 3-2.
Schoettlekotte led off the inning with
his second home run of the season to
tie the game, and Curtiss later singl-
ed and scored on Adam Yanez’ sin-
gle.

Radford pulled ahead for the last
time in the fifth on a couple of walks
given up by Acra and a two-run dou-
ble to lead 4-3 and added another run
in the seventh for the final score of
5-3.

Acra turned in a solid performanoe
for W&L, scattering 10 hits over
seven innings and allowing only two
earned runs.

In the second game, W&L stormed
back from a seven-run deficit to take
an extra-inning 9-8 victory.

Freshman Sully Renuart got off to
a rough start on the mound in the sec-
ond game as Radford soored seven
runs in the first and second innings.
Renuart, who was hurt by three Gen-
erals’ errors in the first, was relieved
by Detlefs with two outs in the sec-
ond.

W&L began its comeback in the
fifth when Yanez smacked a two-run
homer after freshman Carmen Cle-
ment had singled. Freshman Don.
Thayer followed with a single and
scored on White’s double. White
made the score 7-4 when he scored on

Turner’s ground ball. -

Radford looked as if it would re- =
gain control of the game in the sixth -
when it scored once, but Detlefs was
able to work his way out of a bases- ~ ©
loaded jam to prevent the Highland-
ers from increasing their lead.

The Generals tied the game at 8-8
in the sixth. Schoettlekotte scored on

nonsense off by saying how little it

~~ *** dent befall George Steinbrenner, but
By Mike | won't. It wouldn’t be fair, he’s too
disgusting for an accident.
Stachura “No, this isn’t a paid political an-
: L nouncement for the Save Yogi
campaign. It’s just so obvious that Steinbrenner is out of line this time
that something had to be said.

It is said that there are people like George Steinbrenner in the world,
let alone in baseball, and this latest gem is reason enough for condem-
nation of the man.

Steinbrenner’s reasons for disposing of Yogi appear to center
around the problem of team discipline (Yogi scheduled a practice
April 22, but didn’t — horrors — make it mandatory.) Certainly cou-
pled with that were the Yankees’ last-place standing in the American
League East and their three one-run losses over the weekend.

If such were the case and we were in the middle of the season,
perhaps Steinbrenner’s action wouldn’t be so reprehensible. But
George said, ‘‘It’s never too early in the American League East.”

I don’t buy one word from Cigar Man. Yogi is, was and always will
be good for the game. Steinbrenner is not, never was and never will be
good for the game.

Why? Let's look at two simple statements from both men: Yogi said
of the current slump, ‘‘He [Steinbrenner] must think we don’t have
feelings, too. We don’t like to lose either."’ Steinbrenner said of the fir-
ing in a statement that he ‘‘would rather fire 25 players than to fire
Yogi, but we all know that would be impossible." Especially because
you spent so much getting them in pinstripes (i.e., Yogi’s expendable).

Big George’s quote doesn’t quite make sense to me. If it’s the
players who aren’t doing the job, why do we decide to fire the
manager? One wonders, as Dave Anderson’s column on Sunday ex-
plicitly stated, if George was just waiting to insert Billy Martin in the
managerial slot, for any reason he could think of.

Yogi’s statement is the simple reflection of a man fed up with having
to work with Steinbrenner. Steinbrenner stated point blank in spring
training that Yogi’s job was secure regardless of what kind of start the
Yankees had. You’d never have put such a statement with George
given the recent actions of the original hatchet man.

So, here we have a man saying he has a bad team and then firing the
manager, and also saying he’s not going to fire the manager and then
firing the manager. About as logical as having George Steinbrenner in
charge of a baseball club.

In all, we have a clash of baseball the way it should be and baseball
the way it is. Yogi brings to mind days when baseball was a game and
voluntary practices were OK, when losing three one-run games ina
row simply meant bad luck and when managing was something one
guy in a baseball uniform did by himself without any help from those

   
 

 

 

not wearing baseball uniforms. i

Steinbrenner doesn’t bring to mind these ideas. Steinbrenner is
money and winning, that’s all.

Tuesday, W&L won its final reg-
ular season match, beating Radford,
7-2. The Generals got a strong per-
formance from Adams, who fell be-
hind 3-0 in his third-set tie breaker
but roared back to win the next seven
points and the match.

Such play, coupled with the
Generals’ performance at the con-
ference tournament may seem the
culmination of a team’s season. But
for W&L, a team that is finally hitting
its stride and having each perfor-
mance outshine the previous one,
such a victory in fact may be merely
an hors d’oeuvre.

The national championships may
be the main dish.

said his team had played better
games in some of the Generals’ loss-
es, and after the Roanoke game, he
said the Generals had played their
‘worst two games back to back, even
though one was a win.”

In the Bucknell game, W&L was
led by Mark Knobloch (four goals on
four shots), goaltender John DiDuro
(17 saves) and faceoff man Rich
Schoenberg (25 of 29 faceoffs).

Next up for W&L lacrosse is an

Freebies highlight Country Cookin’

 

By PAUL DAVEY
and RUSTY JOHNSON
Restaurant Critics

 

Upon entering Country Cookin’

situated on East Nelson Street next
to the ABC Store), one is struck by
the aura of a train station. Intense
lights create a shimmery glow from
the polyester-clad patrons that seem
to cover every available foot of the
restaurant, much resembling an ant
bed at dusk.

Although the line seemed long, our
group of seven hungry inspectors
was Seated fairly quickly. We had the
full intention of taking advantage of
the unlimited salad, vegetables,
breads and desserts that were pro-
claimed on the bright marquee of the
restaurant.

As in most greasy-spoon truck
stops, the menus also double as
placemats. Also as in most truck
stops, few of the offerings appeared
palatable.

Nine entrees, four platters and four
luncheon specials offer choices rang-
ing from liver and onions to chicken
breast strips to top sirloin steak to

lish delight.’’ As stated, the me-
lange of unlimited items is included
in the price of the entrees, which
range from $3.89 to $6.89.

Our friendly and bright-eyed wai-
tress took our order of one top sirloin,
three steak and gravies, one ribeye
steak, one order of chicken finger
strips and one chopped sirloin. After
attacking the salad bar, we were
served our embarrassingly sparse
entrees. Not even garnished with a

 

 

pickle or parsley — but the idea here
is to feed heavily, not to enjoy a nice-
ly tailored meal. The most fascinat-
ing aspect of the dinners was that the
three items titled ‘‘steak and gravy”
appeared to be exactly the same size.
The similarity of their sizes make
them seem as if they had been pre-
fabricated in a plant far away from
the big country.

The ambiance of the restaurant al-
so leaves something to be desired.
One would expect to find wagon
wheels, steer horns and John Wayne
looking over your shoulder as you
choke down your meal. Yet to one’s
surprise, roughly five framed prints
adorn the north wall, most of which

The Country Cookin’ restaurant located on East Nelson Street.

look like repos from a starving mo-
dern artists’ sale.

In order to fully examine the estab-
lishment, we decided to take a swing
through the men’s room. It was fairly
clean and we were impressed up until
the moment of truth: the wrapper of
the one-ply toilet tissue. The manu-
facturer’s message that it is ‘Ideal
for use with septic tanks’ gave the
impression that the management of
Country Cookin’ does not think too
highly of the restaurant. We left the
men’s room relieved yet concerned.

Near the end of our meal, we decid-
ed to assault the Dessert Bar. We ex-
pected to find deep-dish apple pie,
peach cobbler and pecan pie. How-

   

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

ever, we were sadly met by rows of
Jello and pudding. Our feelings for
the dessert were summed up by a
member of our party who declared,
“Tt tastes like Snak Pak.”’

In sum, Country Cookin’ provides
hot vegetables, a well-stocked salad
bar, and a good place to get filled up
for about $5. But don’t go there look-
ing for a Palm’s atmosphere or a re-
spectable entree. The heart of the re-
staurant — as the sign says — lies in
the unlimited salad-vegetable-des-
sert-roll bar. It’s a place to go for vol-
uminous sustenance. But don’t ex-
pect alcohol or personal checks to be
accepted. Just race in — chow down
and catch the next train out.

‘Dragon’: An 80s update to kung-fu classics

MOVIEREVIEW

By COTTON PURYEAR

 

 

It was only a matter of time before
someone did it, but Berry Gordy and
the folks at Motown have brought
martial arts cult films into the 1980s
with a flying leg kick.

Berry Gordy’s ‘“The Last Dragon”
has all the elements of a traditional
martial arts film — arrogant bad
guys, words of Chinese wisdom and
lots of arms and legs flailing about all
over the screen. The 1980’s update

 

comes with the addition of music
videos and a soundtrack featuring
the likes of Stevie Wonder, Smokey
Robinson, Rockwell, The Tempta-
tions and DeBarge.

The story revolves around Leroy
Green (played by Taimark), a young
black man who spends his time away
from martial arts training walking
about New York City dressed like a
Chinese coolie. Leroy (known about
the neighborhood as “Bruce Lee-
roy”) is quite skilled in the martial
arts and has left his master in search
of ‘‘the glow.”’

What is ‘‘the glow,”’ you ask? Good

question. Leroy describes it as ‘“‘the
final level, when the spirit guides the
body without thought. Your entire
body glows with a beauty that is with-
out bonds.’’ A very impressive sight,
indeed, and it basically means that if
you have ‘‘the glow’’, people tend to
stay out of your way.

Along the way, Leroy comes to the
aid of video music queen Laura
Charles (played by Vanity) who is
being pressured by certified nutcake
Eddie Arcadian to play his girl’s
videos on her show. She refuses, he
kidnaps her, Leroy rescues. Pretty
simple.

A movie-goer must approach “The
Last Dragon’’ with the proper out-
look. While this movie is an action
film, don’t go in expecting Indiana
Jones-type action. The movie has a
good pace, but does get very corny in
several places.

A very hard-core martial arts fan
may be a little disappointed as the
fighting is not the star of the movie.

The film has enough good yucks,
good tunes and good action to make it
worth the price ofadmission. But just
barely. Who knows? Maybe if enough
people go see the movie, the stars can
afford to get last names.

Back Doors to play
SAB spring party

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
“The Back Page’”’ Editor

 

When the Back Doors take the
pavilion stage Saturday night, the
crowd will be treated to a perfor-
mance by a man who has spent a
good deal of time convincing himself
that he IS Jim Morrison.

Jim Hakim, lead singer of the Pen-
nsylvania-based Back Doors, began
his study of Morrison after the two
met in a Los Angeles bookstore in
early 1971. Hakim spent four hours
driving around in Morrison’s car,
and the two talked about philosophy,
religion and poetry.

After friends began to tell Hakim
he acted, talked and looked like Mor-
rison, he began doing research,
watching films and talking to Mor-
rison’s friends. He also began to
gather band members from through-
out northeastern Pennsylvania, and
the Back Doors first took to the stage
in January 1981.

Before the Back Doors, Hakim
played with some smaller rock bands
and also worked as a college instruc-
tor and as a physical education
teacher and was the October 1975

Panel seeks

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Modifying its earlier position that
drug use or possession should not be
punishable by the University, the
Drug Policy Review Committee has
recommended that drug regulations
continue to be enforced in the dor-
mitories.

The committee voted Friday to re-
commend that the dean of students
maintain ‘‘dormitory regulations
prohibiting the possession of mari-
. juana, illegal forms of, opiate, am-
phetamine, hallucinogen or co-
caine.”

The proposal directs dormitory
counselors to report violations to the
dean for ‘‘appropriate administra-
tive action.”

In its original report, the commit-
tee specifically exempted the posses-
sion or use of drugs from a Univer-
sity disciplinary structure it propos-
ed.

The new recommendation still
would remove narcotics use or sales
from the jurisdiction of the Student
Control Committee, and applies only
to the dormitories.

“It did seem like a reasonable com-
promise from the proposal we first
made,”’ said psychology Professor
Leonard E. Jarrard, chairman of the
committee.

Jarrard said the changes were
made ‘‘in response to the various

Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee presi-
dent would not have a vote in closed
honor trials under a_ proposal
presented Monday to the EC by the
White Book Revisions Committee.

The proposal, which met with
strong objection by some members of
the EC, was one of 24 White Book
revisions submitted to the EC.

The EC is scheduled to vote on the
proposed changes Monday.

The revisions stress that the presi-
dent’s role should be as an overseer
anda moderator. They also state that
the president’s function ‘‘is to main-
tain order and enforce the procedure
of the Honor System Hearings.”’

tive Pat Hayden, who is also a mem-
ber of the White Book Revisions Com-
mittee.

EC President Cole Dawson said:
“My initial idea stemmed from the
fact that the closed hearing is a fact-
finding body — not a prosecuting
hearing. The president should hear
both sides of the issue. It is his job to
remind them that it is a fact-finding
hearing. That way, if the president
has done his job, then the committee
can vote and the president doesn’t
need to.”

President-elect John Lewis, senior
representative Bob Tomaso and first-
yearllaw representative James
Crutchfield said they opposed the
changes.

Crutchfield said.

Lewis said that he thought the pres-
ident’s vote should remain intact
because he is elected to represent the
entire student body.

“The president does have to work
as a moderator,’’ Lewis said, ‘‘but he
is also one of only three people elect-
ed by the whole student body to re-
present them. Now you're taking
away his vote. The student body
wanted him there to vote for them.”

Hayden acknowledged that in or-
der to increase the president’s role as
an overseer and moderator, the com-
mittee had to increase his role as a
neutral element.

“That was our compromise,” Hay-

McHenry: Coaches are disappointed with ’85 recruits

 

From Staff Reports

 

The coaching staff is disappointed with the inter-
collegiate athletic potential of the incoming freshman
class, Athletic Director William D. McHenry told a Uni-
versity audience Tuesday night.

McHenry was a panelist for ‘‘Preserving Tradition
through Transition,” a symposium on the possible ef-
fects of coeducation that was sponsored by Omicron Del-
ta Kappa, the honorary leadership organization,

The panel of three students, four professors and two
administrators addressed an audience of about 40. Sen-
ior Chris Williams moderated the discussion, which was
punctuated by moments of both humor and friendly
disagreement.

McHenry made his remarks in response to a question
from a student, who asked about rumors that coaches
had not ‘‘gotten’”’ many of the key potential athletes they
had recruited.

“The increased College Board scores and the reduced
number of male students that is predicted could affect
our recruiting,’’ McHenry began. ‘Hopefully the yield of
our recruiting will offset that.”’

“T don’t think that’s happened this year,’’ he said
“Our yield this year has not been what we anticipated or
hoped for.’’

“T think the general perception by our coaches at the
present time is great disappointment with the efforts at
recruiting that have been made so far,”’ he continued. ‘I
think the teams that will suffer the most are the large
team sports.”

A. Page Remillard, a physical education professor
and coach of the swimming and water polo teams, said
from the audience that athletes ‘‘have to be students
first.”’

He added that attempts by the athletic department to
influence admissions decisions are limited to comments
such as, ‘‘Maybe you could read this file twice.”’

Other highlights of the 90-minute symposium;

eAssociate Dean of the College Pamela H. Simpson,
chair of the Coeducation Steering Committee, warned
that coeducation is not a panacea for everything that ails
the University.

‘Whenever a problem comes up, there’s gotten to be a
little invocation that says, ‘But that'll all change next
year when the women are here,’ *’ she said

“If anything, we’ll have a problem because we think
they'll solve all the problems

Associate Dean of Students Dan N. Murphy, who is al-

so an assistant director of admissions, agreed. ‘‘Let’s
not raise our expectations of the incoming class too far,”’
he said.

‘They are not all superstudents and, indeed, they are
not going to solve all of the questions,’ he continued. ‘‘I
don’t want to put off the students who are here now and
have them say, ‘My God, these people are going to come

in and take over the world
‘These are kids, too.”’

eSarah K. Wiant, a law school librarian and professor
who was in the first coeducational! class when the Wash
ington and Lee Law School began admitting women in
1972, said she finds unnecessary some of the ‘‘flag

See Coed, Page 4

points that have been made by facul-
ty members in meetings and in infor-
mal conversation and to the concerns
of the dormitory counselors and the
Executive Committee.”’

The 12-member drug policy com-
mittee, formed in September by Uni-
versity President John D. Wilson at
the request of the Board of Trustees,
issued its initial recommendations in
March. The proposals dealt with the
school’s drug and alcohol policies
and disciplinary system.

The report was discussed briefly at
the April 1 faculty meeting, in more
detail at an April 24 meeting of the
Faculty Discussion Club and again
Monday at the faculty meeting.

Jarrard said Wilson will schedule a

 

Sad % a5 PS ¢

«ag Sanctions for

special faculty meeting, possibly
next week, for further discussion of
the proposal in ‘‘a much less formal
way.”

Jarrard said faculty opinion
“spreads to the two poles of the con-
tinuum — from one point of view that
would be extremely conservative, to
the opposite extreme, where a person
would tend to be very, very liberal.”

“As in most debates, most people
don’t say anything, so you don’t real-
ly know what they think,’’ he added.

The original plan had been for the
faculty’s recommendation on a drug
and disciplinary policy to be ready

‘for the May 24-25 Board of Trustees
meeting, but Jarrard said that is not
a requirement.

“The president has emphasized
that he wants to take the pressure off
making a decision before the board
next meets,”’ Jarrard said. ‘‘If it re-
quires going into next fall, so be it.
We would hope, though, that it would
come in the next two weeks.”’

The committee’s ‘‘additional re-
commendations” were passed Fri-
day by a unanimous vote by the nine
members present.

eIn addition to the statements on
drugs, the recommendation about
dormitory enforcement directs the
dean of students to add to dorm regu-
lations ‘‘a statement prohibiting the
possession of alcohol by those not
legally permitted to purchase” it.

“One can make a reasonable argu-
ment that with freshmen being away
from home for the first time, they do
need more concern and direction
than others,”’ Jarrard said.

“So it seemed reasonable to try to
continue with this policy of having
dormitory counselors report to the
dean any violation of the rules or
regulations of the University — in
this case, the possession or use of il-
legal substances, including alcohol,’’
he continued.

“The Dean of Students’ office is in
a much better position to pro-
vide...penalties if they’re necessa-
ry,”’

Jarrard emphasized that the com-
mittee has attempted to make ‘‘a
very clear distinction’ between ac-

OPINION
lf at first...

The proposals Monday night by the White Book Revisions
Committee are a refreshing and practical look at the Honor
System at Washington and Lee. Some of the proposals, how-
ever, do present problems, and they ought to be carefully ex-
amined before being included in the White Book.

One of the disturbing proposals is the amendment calling
for the Executive Committee president to serve as a neutral
moderator in the closed hearing. The EC president is one of
only three students elected by the student body as a whole,
and perhaps no greater responsibility is his than enforce-
ment of the Honor System. To render the president neutral
during the closed hearing would silence a voice whose opi-
nion and know-how are greatly needed. Asking the president
to remain silent during closed hearing questioning while
later allowing him to deliberate on the accused’s guilt or in-
nocence removes any facade of neutrality that may have
been erected.

To remedy this situation, perhaps the EC might appoint at
the beginning of each year a group of its members familiar
with the White Book. Members of this group, composed of re-
turning EC members, would serve on a rotating basis as the
neutral moderator and would not participate in the deliber-
ations and would not vote. This would relieve one member
from always being the neutral party while allowing the ac-
cused to have the opportunity for the fair trial he is promised.

In this case, it is the perception of fairness that is para-
mount. When the EC can investigate, try in a closed hearing
and then prosecute in the open hearing — with the same indi-
viduals leading the proceedings throughout — there exists
some inherent conflict. At least with a modification in the
role of one member of the EC, this problem with the supposed
neutrality/fact-finding nature of the closed hearing can be at
least partially resolved.

Secondly, the proposal for the Executive Committee advo-
cate seems to raise more problems than it is worth. The pro-
posal asks that a member of the student body, presumably a
law student well-versed in legal procedures, be allowed to sit
in on all EC hearings in case any of those hearings should
result in an open trial in which such an advocate’s legal ser-
vices might be used. Such a proposal is tantamount to the
addition of a fourth law representative to the EC and would
only serve to add yet another member to the process. That is
not needed.

The sound additions to Section O dealing with the confiden-
tiality of all proceedings are a welcome clarification. After
the gossip and whispering of two weeks ago before an open
trial, the need for enforcement of the confidentiality clause is
obvious. We can only hope that the student body as a whole
will abide by the secrecy that cloaks all the proceedings and
allow the accused in any case the right to the fair trial that he
deserves. Gossip and speculation never acquit anyone.

Finally, the proposal to amend the section dealing with
transcripts ought to be rejected. A student who admits his
guilt by withdrawing before a closed hearing should not re-
ceive the same punishment as a student who exercises his
right to appeal to a student body hearing. ‘‘Not in good stand-
ing’ ought to be reserved for those students who have been
found guilty by their peers, and not students who honorably
admit their guilt and withdraw without the fanfare of the
closed or open hearing.

‘Film at eleven ’

For four years, I had looked forward to graduation with
both anticipation and disappointment. The source of the an-
ticipation is fairly obvious. The disappointment, though, re-
sulted from knowledge of the fact that the only speakers at
my graduation would be the student body president and the
University president. I had always felt a certain twinge of
regret, of missing out on something, because no major politi-
cal figure or business leader would mark my graduation with
an inspirational address.

Until Sunday.

Hampden-Sydney College scored what was considered to
be a major public relations coup by getting Vice President
George Bush to speak at its graduation ceremony Sunday. In-
deed, having a figure such as Bush at a graduation ceremony
is a nice touch, but its real value should be questioned.

Along with Bush came a cadre of Secret Service agents and
White House aides and officers — all about as inconspicuous
at the graduation as someone wearing a polyester tie. And
then of course there were the media. If one of the college’s
goals in inviting Bush was to attract coverage of the gradua-
tion, it succeeded. Nearly all of Virginia’s newspapers and
television stations ran stories on the event. W&L’s gradua-
tion, on the other hand, routinely is ignored by the media.

In this case, though, if I may mangle a metaphor, to be ig-
nored is bliss.

In addition to Bush’s speech, the graduation ceremony
included numerous senior awards, a valedictory address, a
commissioning of a senior into the Marines, the awarding of
honorary degrees and the acceptance speeches therefor.

Oh, and 150 seniors graduated.

In all, the ceremony lasted more than two hours in 85-
degree heat. But the awarding of diplomas, the purpose for
which we had assembled, was anticlimactic, almost an after-
thought.

By the time the degrees were awarded, most of the mem-
bers of the media, who’d come only to see Bush, had packed
up and left. Some members of the audience who didn’t know
any graduates also had long departed. They weren’t in-
terested in Hampden-Sydney, or in the graduates — they
were interested only in George Bush.

This might be acceptable if one thought that the visit
means something to those who give these commencement
addresses year after year. But to Bush, Hampden-Sydney
was just another stop on the way (I assume) to the White
House. Just the day before, he’d spoken at Wheaton College
in Illinois, and the following day, he would speak in New
York. One of his aides described the spring graduation cir-
cuit as being worse than the fall campaign.

A name graduation speaker may attract some attention to
himself and to the school but he detracts from the graduation
itself. W&L clearly has made a wise decision in ensuring that
attention is focused on the students by having only members
of the University community speak at the commencement
exercises,

Counsel rejects ‘ridiculous opinions’ .

To the Editors:

I realize that there is an unspoken
policy not to discuss honor proceed-
ings in this paper, but I feel compell-
ed to comment upon Ben Hale’s col-
umn of last week. I must at this time,
both admittedly and regrettably,
stoop to Mr. Hale’s level in discuss-
ing this matter. I do this only to in-
form your readers of Mr. Hale’s mis-
takes in logic, his misconceptions
regarding the system and his abso-
lute ignorance of legal terms and
practices both within our [honor
system] and in judicial proceedings.

I represented the accused in the re-
cent honor trial. I am an absolute be-
liever in our system as it presently
exists. There are some flaws in the
White Book, but those flaws are
minor and usually unimportant. Our
system imposes as the the only pun-
ishment the single sanction — a sanc-
tion established long ago and used by
General Lee on numerous occasions.
In his day, Lee had complete control
over the Honor System — there was
no White Book, nor was there initially
an honor committee. Eventually, the
students wisely adopted their own
guidelines to handle honor offenses,
and the power of the system was
transferred from the president to the
students. General Lee’s honor code,
however, that ‘all men behave like
gentlemen” was retained and was
codified into the White Book we have
today.

I support the honor code, the White
Book, the single sanction and the con-
cept that underlies them — there are
no degrees of honor. Many people on
campus do not believe in the present
system and that belief became quite
apparent during jury selection for
the recent trial. The White Book pro-
vides that potential jurors who do not
believe in the system as it stands
may be ‘‘struck for cause’ — i.e., not
allowed to serve as jurors. Although
this may give the Executive Commit-
tee the opportunity to select a jury to
its advantage, I think it is a good
rule. It ensures that the jury believes
in a system that it is called upon to
support.

Mr. Hale fails to recognize the sim-
ilarity between our honor system
and American criminal proceedings.
Many of the rules of evidence apply
to our system, and the Student Bar
Association president presides as
judge to rule on objections and to in-
struct the jury. Additionally, the
defendant does not have to testify
and the EC has the burden of proving
its case. The White Book states that
“all reasonable doubts should be
resolved in favor of the accused”’
— this is no different from the stan-
dard in criminal proceedings, where
the accused must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. Hale
states that there is an obvious dif-
ference between these two stan-
dards, yet he failed to explain in any
way the difference he perceives. In
fact, no difference exists between the
two — if any reasonable doubt exists
in either an honor or criminal pro-
ceeding, the accused must be acquit-
ted. The ‘beyond a_ reasonable
doubt’’ standard is one of the strict-
est standards of the law — it resolves
every possible doubt in favor of the
accused. No one should be convicted
of an honor offense and expelled from
our community, unless he actually
violated the Honor Code. John Sici-
lian, the SBA president, properly in-
structed the jury and Gordy Ham-
mock, the EC advocate, was abso-
lutely correct in not contesting the
instruction. Had Mr. Hale been pro-
secuting the case, his absurd opi-
nions of the system and of the burden
of proof quickly and properly would
have been stricken from the record.
Furthermore, had he continued to
voice his incorrect conclusions, Mr.
Sicilian would have been forced to
order a mistrial and the EC case
would have gone out the window.

I must agree with Mr. Hale that
polygraph tests ought to have no part
in our system. Such tests are some-
times used in court, but more often in
pre-trial and post-trial proceedings.
The obvious reason for their non-ac-
ceptance is their reliability. The ex-
perts are in disagreement as to the

accuracy of such tests and this dis-
agreement seenis to be a controlling
factor in the minds of many judges in
rejecting the tests. But if this scien-
tific evidence is kept out of honor
trials, so should the “‘invisible finger-
print powder”’ available only through
the police that sealed the fate of the
accused in the open trial. Mr. Hale
labels the use of scientific polygraph
tests in the trial as ‘‘horrifying,”’ yet
he overlooks the instruction of the
scientific powder. Had the EC pre-
sented a paid expert witness to testi-
fy about the powder, I am confident
that Mr. Hale would have been pleas-
ed to see the EC go the extra mile to
secure a conviction.

There are arguments that exist for
the use of polygraph tests in honor
trials. If one believes that the under-
lying foundation of the system is to
seek the truth, then it seems logical
that any possible means of ascertain-
ing the truth should be employed.
The government and thousands of
companies in this country use poly-
graph tests daily as a reliable means
of screening applicants and employ-
ees. We introduced the polygraph
test because we felt it was reliable

and tended te indicate that the accus-'

ed was not guilty. It was for the jury
to weigh the evidence and determine
the truth.

This leads me to another point I
wish to discuss - that being the role of
the defense advocates in the system.
Mr. Hale states that there is too

Opinion on

To the Editors:

Last week’s editorial ‘‘ ‘A’ for Ef-
fort’’ was a blatant misrepresenta-
tion of the facts. This editorial show-
ed very little journalistic responsibil-
ity. I don’t feel that anyone in good
conscience could equate hunger in
Ethiopia, where millions of people
are threatened with death, and the
system of apartheid in South Africa,
with its total disregard of self-deter-
mination and human rights, with
“saving the whales.”’

Furthermore, The Phi generalized
when it stated that the Executive
Committee by supporting the resolu-
tion on South Africa as “hopping
right on the boycott bandwagon,”’ the
resolution merely asks for the Board
of Trustees to study whether or not
the University has holdings in South
Africa and ‘‘to consider what mea-

‘Legalities

To the Editors:

I am writing in response to Ben
Hale’s ‘My View” column in The
Phi. Like Mr. Hale, I also found a
message in last week’s honor trial
—but quite a different one.

“Legalities” are not devices to
accomplish underhanded deceit.
Rather, legal technicalities are safe-
guards which ensure that no student
will be accused and convicted of an
honor violation unless and until his
accusers can prove guilt. The burden
of proof must be rigorous (as all ad-
vocates in the trial seem to have be-
lieved), otherwise it would be possi-
ble for the EC and jury to eliminate
students who are unpopular but ne-
vertheless honorable.

Our University stresses honor and
gentlemanly behavior. Surely no gen-
tleman would want to see his fellow
student wrongfully expelled. A gen-
tleman’s code of civility demands
caution before making damaging ac-
cusations.

With regard to the behavior of Jim
Kay and Stewart Thomas, I am also
in disagreement with Mr. Hale. Mr.
Kay and Mr. Thomas defended [the
accused student] aggressively. In
my opinion, they did their job well
— they forced the EC to prove every
aspect of the charge. There is nothing
underhanded or deceitful about that,
Mr. Hale.

If W&L’s Honor System is to sur-
vive, it must accomplish substantial

much emphasis on legal training in
the open trials. Here, once again, he
is mistaken. The honor system, at
least in open trials, contains numer-
ous complex technical requirements
which those with law school exper-
ience are particularly well-trained to
understand and to assist others in
understanding as well, The White
Book allows the EC to choose an ad-
vocate from the student body for a
trial if the committee wishes to. This
provision was drafted to ensure that
a capable advocate could be employ-
ed and it was undoubtedly contem-
plated that advocates from the Law
School often would be chosen. I
suspect that if Mr. Hale were accus-
ed of an honor offense, he would ask a
law student to defend him.

Ido not represent students to ‘‘beat
the system” or ‘‘to crush the EC.’’ On
the contrary, I am a member of this
system, and more importantly, an of-
ficer of this system. As an advocate, I
must support the White Book and
cannot, under any circumstances,
perpetrate a lie within the system. In
this respect, had the accused admit-
ted his guilt, I could not have allowed
him to testify as to his innocence.
When an accused swears to his inno-
cence, however, I have the absolute
and sacred duty to represent him to
the best of my ability within the
bounds of the White Book. A defense
advocate must do everything within
his power to ensure that the accused
gets a fair trial and to see that the EC

advocates follow the same rules that :
defense advocates must follow.

Mr. Hale, who failed to use my
name, stated that I engaged in “‘un-
derhanded psychological ploys” dur- ©
ing the trial. My response to that is ’
that Mr. Hale either slept through the’
closing arguments or has absolutely
no understanding of advocacy. I em- .
phasized in my closing that I believed
in and upheld our system. I stated _
that the EC has the burden of proving
its case beyond a reasonable doubt, “
and then gave our theory of the case. t
I did my best to be fair in my closing Wf
and I believe the jury, opposing ”
counsel and the chairman recognized "
that fact. mn

I am offended by Mr. Hale’s state-
ment that my knowledge of the White’
Book is ‘an abomination.” This is a’
personal attack upon my preparation ”
of the case and upon my knowledge of ~
the system. I submit that his opinions’ ’’
are the ones that are off-base, and”:
that it is he who needs to learn the
rules of the system before he publicly *'
speaks upon a subject he is ill-equip- ”
ped to address. In closing, I regret —
that his statements and mine in re-
turn were ever discussed outside of”
Lee Chapel. I am thankful, however, _
that his ridiculous opinions, to which’
he is totally entitled, did not play a “
factor in the hearing, in the decision
of the jury or in our Honor System as’
it presently stands. :

sures, if any, should be appropriate
for Washington and Lee to take.”’
The Phi, then, contrives to take
statements out of context when it
states that a representative of the
Campaign against Apartheid is quot-
ed as saying the president ‘supports’
the effort, but that later on the repre-
sentative said the president hadn't
expressed an opinion. Here again this
editorial strays from the facts; what
was said’was that the president sup-
ported the efforts to direct a cam-
paign against apartheid for dialogue
on the campus. It was never stated
that the President endorsed or re-
jected the resolution. The Phi also
labeled charges that a representative
called the Board of Trustees
“ignorant.”’ This statement is false.
Moreover the editorial went on to
state it’s ‘‘rather ironic that the EC
finds it offensive that the South Afri-

“not devices of deceit

justice. This means it must be fair
and it must appear to be fair. A retro-
spective examination of an honor
trial should be characterized by cer-
tainty. It would be fatal, tragic,
embarassing and dishonorable if we
were ever able to look back and say
that we’re not really sure if a convict-
ed student was guilty.

+ Tothe Editors:

_Mr. Ben Hale’s column last week
about the most recent student body

. hearing was nothing short of aston-

ishing. Mr. Hale made an artificial

* distinction between guilt being deter-
* mined “‘beyond a reasonable doubt,”

and ‘resolving any  reason-

” able doubt in favor of the accused.”
« Mr. Hale apparently did not realize

that one concept can be expressed in
” different words.
+ |The White Book incorporates the
, ‘reasonable doubt’’ standard. When
the White Book says a juror is to ‘‘re-
* solve any reasonable doubt in favor
, of the accused,”’ it is describing how
a juror is to vote for an acquittal. The
» advocates were simply expressing
, how the jurors are to vote for a
conviction when they said the accus-

~ ed must be found guilty ‘beyond a

)

, reasonable doubt.’’ Both instructions

state the ‘‘reasonable doubt’’ stan-
* dard; they are different sides of the
,£ame coin.

Letters

“Reasonable doubt” is not a mys-
terious legal term; it is supposed to
be understood as it is commonly us-
ed. In either case, the White Book in-
struction or the advocates’ instruc-
tion places the responsibility for de-
fining reasonable doubt and honor-
able conduct with the member of the
“student generation’’ who is serving
on the jury.

What is even more amazing about
Mr. Hale’s analysis is that he fails to
recognize an important distinction in
the function of the jury. Presumably
because Mr. Hale agreed with the ju-
ry’s verdict, he thinks ‘‘the jury
{had] the good sense and conviction
to ignore the defense advocate’s”’ ar
guments (emphasis mine). We can-
not expect accurate verdicts if the
jury ignores either side; I hope the
jury listened intensely to both sides,
and after careful consideration of
both arguments, came to a reasoned
decision. I agreed with the student ju-

‘ry’s verdict because I did not think

Titles perplexing

*To the Editors:
, After my last letter criticizing The
Ring-tum Phi’s editors, I wasn’t
‘planning on writing again. But an
,item in The Phi last month [April 4]
announcing the appointments of next
year’s editors changed my mind.
« The lead of the unbylined news
story on page 4 stated that Mike
“Allen, Paul Foutch and Cotton Pur-
yyear had been appointed by the Uni-
versity Publications Board as the
“three top editors” of next year’s
»Phi. Later, the story stated that Allen
, ‘will hold the position of Executive
"Editor and will have overall respon-
‘sibility for the newspaper’’ and that
~«Foutch and Puryear ‘‘will each have
the title of Editor, and will each be
*responsible for one of the two sec-
tions’ planned for the paper next
year.
This is literally true but mislead-
»ing, if not deceitful. It implies that
the Publications Board appointed Al-
“len executive editor and Puryear and
-Foutch as subordinate editors work-
,ing under him. This is not what hap-
‘pened. Actually, the Publications
"Board specifically rejected a pro-
posal by Allen to name him executive
editor and instead selected Allen,
‘Puryear and Foutch to serve as “‘tri-
,chief editors,” each with equal power
over the paper.
* The three agreed on their own to
,establish the setup of one executive
“editor and two section editors. Ac-
*cording to Foutch, he and Puryear
,agreed to the arrangement because
“allen, who is the paper’s most pro-
ductive reporter, indicated he might
,not work for The Phi next year if they
“did not give him a “‘promotion’’ from
this job as co-chief editor this year.
These are facts that should be
"known to W&L students, whose taxes
‘help run the paper. The Phi’s story
does not state that things did not hap-

-

pen that way, but its careful seman-
tic construction implies something
altogether different. The story re-
minds me of the editor’s note pre-
ceeding Steve Pockrass’ letter last
semester. The note implied that
Pockrass had been fired from the pa-
per’s staff before he submitted the
letter criticizing its news judgments.
A “correction”? was published the
next week, noting that Pockrass had
been let go after he turned in the let-
ter and apologizing for any misun-
derstanding the editor’s note might
have caused. Perhaps the note could
be written off as an inadvertent mis-
take, but The Phi’s editors, who are
responsibile for the paper’s content,
knew the facts of the Pub Board deci-
sion and thus knew the incorrect im-
pression their story would give.

Such self-serving misinformation
is a disservice to the W&L communi-
ty and erodes the paper’s credibility.
It is simply wrong to portray as a
promotion what could be construed
by many as a demotion: According to
a vote of the board that oversees The
Phi, Allen, who had one-half share of
ultimate editorial power this year,
will have a one-third share next year,
with the other two-thirds going to
staff members who worked under
him this year.

Perhaps, there is nothing, wrong

. with Allen,. Foutch and Puryear

working out an.agreeable and effi-
cient system for sharing the work-
load next year. And perhaps there is
nothing terribly improper with Allen
threatening to pick up his marbles
and go home if he does not get his
way. But it is definitely wrong to por-
tray the agreement as something it
was not — a decision by the board
that serves as publisher of The Ring-
tum Phi.

Lewis opposes White Book change
‘of president’s role in honor hearing

To the Editors:

+ Currently under consideration by
the Executive Committee is a pro-
‘posal by the White Book Revisions
Committee to make the president of
the student body neutral — that is,
‘take away his vote in closed honor
hearings. This is a drastic change be-
ing downplayed by the advocates of
the proposal. It makes the president
merely a moderator for what is
jntended to give a perception of
greater fairness. Is it not the job of
the Executive Committee to ascer-
tain the facts surrounding a case in
an honorable manner? There are on-
ly three members of the Executive
Committee elected by the entire stu-
dent body. Are we going to take the
vote of the man elected to carry out
the governing of the student body?

The reason for this emasculation of
the president, I am told, is so that
new evidence can be introduced on
the advice of the president, without
the consent of the accused and his ad-
vocates. I think Indians call this am-
bush. I urge members of the student
body to voice their views to the cur-
rent members of the Executive Com-
mittee before their vote on this issue
on Monday. I have spoken with sever-
al advocates of the proposal and I re-
main adamantly opposed to any and
all proposals to change the role of the
president in this way. Our system is
extremely effective and has been for
a long time. I have great faith in the
elected members of the committee to

approach all honor’ matters
honorably.

Editorial questioned

To the Editors:

‘One of the things I have struggled
with during my two years as a stu-
dent at Washington and Lee is my un-
derstanding of honor, as compared to
that of much younger students. Many
things like the pencil and pen marks
found in library books, or carving in-
to the paint of the elevators are clear-
ly dishonorable acts. The school owns
the library collection and the eleva-
tors and I am unable to understand
how a student feels he can deface
University property. I am also trou-
bled by the manner in which some
students deal with the truth and a
case in point is the editorial in [the
May 2] Ring-tum Phi.

-Even if the editorialist did not ap-
prove of the anti-apartheid petition
or of the Executive Committee's ac-
tion, he had no right to subvert the
truth. I never implied that the trus-
tees were ignorant, nor did I ever im-
ply that President Wilson supported
divestment petitions. I think there
ig a special irony that my transaction
with the EC would be reported in a
less than honest manner, I am extra-

—$rdinarily hurt and disappointed. Not

only is this an example of reckless

journalism, but the editorial does not
become a Washington and Lee
gentleman.

I would also add that the apartheid
issue and missing children may be
faddish for some, but for others it is
not. My commitment to such causes
has been unceasing for more years
than the editorialist has been alive.
Any issues involving the quality of
life, for all men, are of primary im-
portance for me, and pray God they
always will be. Concern for others
should be part of our honor. I had
hoped this apartheid issue would
cause W&L students to look beyond
the safe comfortable world of the
campus and to this extent I think it
has. It seems to me that human life is
a far more important concern than
neckties.

I thank the EC, the faculty, the
staff and all of the students who have
supported this effort.

EDITORS’ NOTE: The Ring-tum Phi
stands by its account of the meeting,
which has been corroborated by several
others who were present.

 

‘Distinction distorts case

the defense succeedeu in presenting
a reasonable doubt of guilt in the face
of the Executive Committee’s evi-
dence; I have confidence in the jury’s
verdict because I think they arrived
at their verdict in the same way.
However, the defense’s arguments
haunt me, as I hope they haunt the
student jurors — no decision so pro-
found on another’s life shoud be
made with less thoughtfulness.

Mr. Hale then goes on to indicate
that he thinks the Honor System
should incorporate a rule of evidence
that would not allow paid experts to
testify, or evidence produced by ma-
chines to be admitted. If Mr. Hale’s
rule were followed, the Executive
Committee could not have engaged a
handwriting expert to testify three
years ago. Also, “Murph,” the
school’s proctor, could not have testi-
fied in the most recent student body
hearing: Murph is a paid investiga-
tor and the evidence he presented
was obtained with the use of a
machine — a black light. The hand-
writing expert, Murph and the lie-
detector expert were presented as
evidence to help the student jury de-
termine the facts; neither should
have any effect on the juror’s concept
of honor.

Legalities are misplaced in our
Honor System — there is no logical
reason why our Honor System should
completely embrace the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure or the
Virginia Rules of Evidence. How-
ever, the need for trained advocates
at student body hearings is imper-
ative: they can sharpen the issues,
and improve the quality of the argu-
ments. Our Honor System cannot
simply rest on some nebulous philo-
sophy of honor. Sound preparation
and clear presentation require advo-
cates to map out trial strategy. Or-
dered hearings presuppose the par-
ticipants will follow a reasoned set of
procedures — pejoratively called
technicalities. Well-presented argu-
ments by both the Executive Com-
mittee and the defense advocates can
to nothing but strengthen the Honor
System.

Hale article,
law student
do not agree’

To the Editors:

As a third-year law student and a
classmate of Jim Kay, Gordy Ham-
mock and John Sicilian, I feel com-
pelled to respond to Ben Hale’s criti-
cism of their handling of the recent
open honor proceeding. Hale lacked
not only the courage to accuse any of
the three by name, but also the intel-
ligence to support any of his allega-
tions of serious misconduct with any
substance. While I cannot explain
Hale’s first failing, his second is easi-
ly explained. He is simply wrong.

Jim, John and Gordy are as well-
liked and highly respected as any stu-
dents in our Law School. Anyone who
knows them is familiar with the time,
effort and emotion that they have put
into the numerous honor proceedings
that they have been involved with
during their years here at W&L.
Their ability, intentions and, above
all, their integrity, are beyond ques-
tion. They have probably spent more
time on honor proceedings than any-
one on this campus, which should
show even Ben Hale that they not on-
ly understand the process, but have a
great deal of respect for it as well.

Unfortunately, Hale chose to rail
on a distinction that does not exist,
despite his unsubstantiated claim
that it was ‘‘obvious.’’ Regardless of
which “‘reasonable doubt” phrase is
used, the result is the same — if a
juror has a reasonable doubt as to the
defendant's guilt, he must find the
defendant innocent. Period. But this
misbegotten tirade on a non-existent
distinction between standards was
far from the worst aspect of Hale’s
commentary. Hale’s inability to de-
tect one standard defined in two
phrases pales in comparison to his
personal attacks on the three stu-
dents.

Hale accused the three of both er-
roneously and, in the case of Jim
Kay, intentionally circumventing a
system which all three support and
respect. Hale’s claim that John, Gor-
dy and Jim do not ‘‘know the White
Book — or understand it,”’ and the in-
excusable charge that Jim Kay was
“‘underhanded” in his presentation of
the defense, are more than just
wrong. They are an absolute dis-
grace,

Gordy Hammock, Jim Kay and
John Sicilian have taken the time to
learn the Honor System procedures
and to apply their legal training and
skills to make the system work fair-
ly. They are owed much more than
the shabby treatment afforded them
by Ben Hale. As I noted earlier, Hale
even lacked the courage to make his
accusations by name. Perhaps he
will have the grace to do so in a
much-deserved apology.

383 accept admission offers

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

Fifty-five presidents of major
organizations, 69 team captains and
148 honor society students, respon-
ding to the University’s May 1
deadline, are included among 281
men and 102 women who have ac-
cepted their offers of admission as
freshmen next fall.

Associate Director of Admissions
Van H. Pate said 60 additional
students on the waiting list have been
offered admission to reach the Uni-
versity's goal of 300 men and 100
women for the class.

“We have no trouble with our
waiting list,’’ Pate said. “‘These are
very fine people, and we were hope-
ful we could offer some of them ad-
mission.”

Pate said the 400 students who had
been placed on the waiting list this
year were as academically strong as
some of those the University con-
sidered top choices in recent years.

The waiting list, according to Pate,
was ranked on the same basis as the
class at large. Including the 60 addi-
tional offers recently made, 101
students on the waiting list have been
offered admission.

In total, the University sent 880 ad-
mission letters — 33 percent of the
total applicant pool — to 38 states,

Canada and Chile

About 47 percent of the high school
seniors have accepted their offers of
admission.

Pate described the group as ‘“‘ex-
cellent students”’ and ‘‘very fine peo-
ple” — a ‘‘very gratifying combina-
tion.”’

The Class of 1989 averaged 580 on
the verbal section of the SAT and 617
on the math. High school class stan-
ding averages at the 82 percentile.

finalists, compared with last year’s
nine, and 34 valedictorians or

year’s 14, will be in the class.

Also in the class will be 11 black

eral Canadians and a student from

Just more than 1 percent of the
nation’s high school seniors would
have increased interest in a
single-sex college because of that
characteristic, according to a
survey released this week.

The survey of 1,934 seniors by
the Denver-based Ingersoll Group
Inc. also found that students from
the Southeast are nine times more
likely than students from the

 

Chile. Five students are from Rock-
bridge County.

number 30 and 23, respectively.

Public school students make up 55
percent of the class, while the re-
maining 45 percent are from private
schools.

Also among the Class of 1989 are:
21 student body presidents.
18 student body vice presidents.
29 junior or senior class
presidents or vice presidents.
¢17 honor society presidents.
23 school newspaper editors.
19 literary magazine or yearbook

terest ina single-sex school.

This could be attributable to the
large number of single-sex
schools in the Southeast, said the
firm’s president, Ron Ingersoll.

Ingersoll said he didn’t have the
statistics by gender, but ‘‘it’s been
my experience that there’s even
less interest on the part of males
in single-sex institutions.’’

 

 

Being first a ‘challenge’ for women

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

The words ‘‘challenge’’ and ‘‘un-
certainty” seem to be the ones that
Washington and Lee’s first class of
women use most frequently to de-
scribe what they think their exper-
ience will be next year.

Laura Carty of Denver said she
first became interested in the school
through her father, a 1962 W&L grad-
uate. After last summer’s Board of
Trustee’s decision to begin admitting
women to W&L, Carty immediately
made an appointment for an inter-
view.

“At first I did it to kind of humor
him [her father], but once I got here

 

 

 

“All the W&L sci
really seemed to care
about each person that
wanted to come here.”’

—Laura Carty

 

and saw the campus I was really in-
terested,”’ Carty said.

Carty said the personal attention
she received during her visit had a
large influence on her decision to at-
tend W&L. ‘‘All the W&L people real-
ly seemed to care about each person
that wanted to come here,”’ she said.

Although Carty said she is trying
not to worry about what kind of chal-
lenges might face next year’s first
class of women, she said she is main-
taining an ‘‘idealistic attitude.”’

“I think it’s going to be a great
year. The admissions people are pro-
bably going to pick people that are
really excited about being in the first
class. I know I’m excited and can
hardly wait to start,” she said.

Carty said she expects a few hostil-
ities at the beginning but added that

things will probably ease off once
everyone becomes comfortable in the
new setting.

Renee Steinbrenner of Atlanta first
heard about W&L in her junior year
and she said she was ‘“‘sort of mad”’
when she found out that it was an all-
male school. When it was announced
that women would be admitted, she
decided to look into the school.

When Steinbrenner visited the
W&L campus, she told students she
was applying to Hollins College to
avoid the typical reactions. During
her visit she talked with a lot of peo-
ple who expressed positive feelings
about next year, and the visit con-
vinced her that W&L was where she
wanted to go.

Although part of her interest in
W&L stems from the idea of trying
something different, Steinbrenner
said she has a genuine interest in
W&L. ‘I'm not doing this to make a
stand,”’ she said. “I’m doing this
because I want to go to school at
W&L.”’

The area women’s colleges might
be an additional source of friction,
Steinbrenner said. ‘‘We'll be one
more set of girls for them to compete
with,” she added, ‘‘but I imagine
we'll get along.”

Although admitting that she is a lit-
tle nervous about next year, Stein-
brenner said she has no regrets and
thinks that it will turn out to be a
great year. She said she felt that the
women should not come on too strong
next year and should try to subtly get
involved with things on campus.

Leeann Flood of Ft. Worth, Texas,
got her first glimpse of W&L when
she was 10 years old. She did not visit
the campus again before her accep-
tance and was going on W&L’s repu-
tation alone. ‘‘I was really applying
sight unseen, but I did get lots of pic-
tures of the campus,” she said.

Flood said she has mixed feelings
about being in the first group of
women at W&L. “‘At first I was really
excited, but then I heard about how
much the guys didn’t want the girls
there. I’m not really worried though,
I don’t think people there are not go-
ing to be able to change and get used
toit,’’ she said.

Flood added that she thought the
whole experience would be a chal-
lenging one and hoped that the other
women coming in are as excited
about it as she is. “I really don’t sce
how anyone could not be excited
about all this,”’ she said.

Clare Kaye of Mansfield, Ohio, said
she felt honored to be selected for the
first class of women at W&L. “It’s go-
ing to be a new challenge, but I think
it will be a neat experience.”

Kaye said she hopes to continue
participating in some of the activities
at W&L that she did while she was in
high school. She said she was inter-
ested in student government, but said
she'll have to wait to see how W&L
students react to women running for
student government positions.

One area in which Kaye hopes to be
a ground-breaker is cheerleading.
“When we were sent the question-
naires about what sports we might be
interested in participating in, they
left a space for you to insert in your
own suggestions,”’ she said, ‘“‘and I

wrote down that I was very interest-
ed in cheerleading.”

Kaye said she didn’t really foresee
a great deal of friction with the sur-
rounding women’s colleges. She has

there are not going to be
able to change and get
used to it.’’

a sister attending Sweet Briar Col-

lege who loves the idea that Kaye will

be attending W&L and plans to visit.
Although the women expressed dif-

ferent views about what chal-
lenges face them next year, they
tended to agree about the probability
of starting sororities. They said that
maybe after two or three years soror-
ities would’be a good addition to cam-
pus life, but that starting them in the
first year might not be a good idea.

Flood said she thinks W&L should
hold off on sororities until after a cou-
ple of years when there are a few
more females.

‘“‘Only having one or two sororities
in the first year could create some
unnecessary divisions among the wo-
men,”’ said Kaye, who added that she
thinks they'll have plenty of other
things to keep them busy next year.

HAMPDEN-SYDNEY — It was a
match made in Brooks Brothers:

George Herbert Walker Bush
(Phillips Academy '42, Yale '48) and
Hampden-Sydney College, where
golf course attire is appropriate all
year ‘round.

The vice president gave the
commencement address Sunday at
Hampden-Sydney’s graduation and
received an honorary doctorate of
law from ‘‘the last college found-
ed before the American Revolution.”

University President Josiah Bunt-
ing 3rd noted the appropriateness of
adding Bush to the school’s roster of
alumni by making reference to the
author of ‘‘The Official Preppy Hand-
book.”’

“This new relationship will surely
gratify Lisa Birnbach, that subtle
scholar of watchbands and J. Press
collars,” he said.

At the ceremony’s start, 148 pairs
of Weejuns and wingtips filed into
rows of folding chairs on the lawn
outside Venable dormitory, a Nation-
al Historic Landmark undergoing re-
novation.

A single yellow collar was con-
spicuous in a sea of starched
white shirts, and fellow graduates
laughed nervously as one of the sen-
iors tripped on a chair, sending it
sprawling.

Barbara Bush, wife of the vice
president, sat in the shade on the dor-
mitory porch. Throughout the
speeches, she whispered to Sen. Paul
Trible, R-Va., who was seated next to
her.

Bush and the Second Lady ap-
plauded gamely while the students

cheered at the announcement that
their football field was being renam-
ed for a favorite coach.

The appropriate pleasantries ema-
nated from the podium during the
two-hour proceeding. Bunting de-
lighted the audience by welcoming
all the ‘‘distinguished wives and their
husbands.”

When presenting the honorary de-
gree to the vice president, Bunting
referred to him as ‘‘Mr. Bush.’’ He
instantly recovered by joking,
“*You'll get your title back”’ later.

One of the two political references
of the day was by Bunting, who noted
that in the press’s passive parlance,
Bush is “widely assumed” to be a
candidate for the 1988 Republican
presidential nomination.

When Bush began his speech, he
added his own topper to a one-liner
Bunting had offered about the stu-
dents mixing up the previous year’s
graduation speaker. ‘I can under-
stand your confusion with Jonas Salk
and Dr. Spock, but please don’t get
me confused with Geraldine Fer-
raro,’’ Bush said.

From there, he clung to his text,
which began: “Graduation Day is
like springtime....”’

The Secret Service kept a sharp
eye on the 30 or so reporters roped in-
to the media pen. One camerman
was hastily retrieved when he tried
to stay near the podium past his allot-
ted time. :

Valedictorian Gregory A. Brandt
was introduced as an English

major with a grade point average of
3.997.

“Sorry about the GPA,’’ he said
when he got to the podium. He said he
was tempted to ‘“‘quote Theudius
from the Greek” or “‘parse a few sen-

Washington and Lee students shop-
ping for Mother’s Day flowers this
year are choosing freshly cut ar-
rangements over potted plants or
dried flowers, local florists say.

All area florists have at least one
floral wire service by which flowers
and plants can be sent virtually any-
where in the country and overseas,
with prices beginning at $15.

“A lot of students ask for spring
flowers, such as irises, tulips and
daisies, and send a mixture of these
cut flowers,” said Frank White, own-
er of Huffman-White Florist.

A.W. Lewis Jr., owner of The Jef-
ferson Florist and Garden noted that

this has not always been the tradi-
tion, and said that potted plants and
corsages used to be more popular
Mother’s Day gifts. One explanation
he offered for the change to fresh
flowers is that “‘there might be a feel-
ing that a cup arrangement is a little
more personal or intimate.”

Lewis said that daffodils and Al-
stroemeria — a lily from Holland
that he described as very hardy — as
well as irises and tulips, are particu-
larly good flowers to use in spring ar-
rangements.

In addition to these types of ar-
rangements, several wire services
offer ‘‘keepsake’’ bouquets of as-
sorted flowers arranged in or on a
ceramic piece that can be used after
the flowers die. FTD, Floral Trans-
world Delivery, has an arrangement

zy" and “‘compel you to lob a few
champagne corks my way.”’

“The guys with the guns warned
me, however, that that was not a
good idea,’’ he said, motioning trium-
phantly toward the startled Secret
Service contingent.

The agents in the Bush entourage
seemed less than enthused about the
vice president’s apparently unending
public relations duties. ‘‘We were in
Chicago yesterday, we'll be in New
York tomorrow, and after that we
start a four-day swing,” one of them
lamented. “This is almost worse than
the campaign.”

Hampden-Sydney is one of the na-
tion’s few remaining all-male col-
leges. A September survey by The Ti-
ger, the campus newspaper, showed
that 91 percent of the 423 students
responding were opposed to coeduca-
tion.

Berkely W. Young announced the
senior class gift of oak trees, saying
they were chosen ‘‘in the hope that in
200 years, hopefully a graduating
class of all men will be out under the
trees as we are today.”

He evoked appreciative laughter
with a comment about ‘‘the dogs that
wander into classrooms — and fall
asleep.”’ He said he thought the class
would appreciate its years at Hamp-
den Sydney, even when with advanc-
ing age they got ‘fatter and dumb-

special Mother’s Day pattern that in-
cludes a candlestick, water carafe
and vase that can be sent by them-
selves or with flowers. The ‘‘keep-
sake’ arrangements begin at about
$25, according to White.

Some of the potted plants tradition-
ally popular for Mother's Day, ac-
cording to Libby Entsminger, man-
ager of University Florist & Green-
ery, ‘‘include anything blooming, like
geraniums, azalea, or ivy.’’ Lewis
believes that mums and gloxinia may
also be good choices.

Orders for the wire services should
be in by today, Lewis said, but added
that they possibly can go through
later than that and that he can find
out immediately whether he can send
an order to any particular location.

dents’ accomplishments.

She explained that she thought it was healthy that lit-
tle hoopla accompanied the initial admission of women
to the Law School, the appointment of the first woman as
editor of the Washington and Lee Law Review or the
election this year of the first female president of the Stu-

dent Bar Association.

“I think it was good that recognition did not come that
women were appointed to these positions in due course
and when they were the most capable candidates and

life went on,”’ she said.

‘“‘We showed we didn’t have to have recognition every
step of the way and we’ve matured sufficiently so it

doesn’t happen.”

Simpson disagreed with Wiant’s view that initial
achievements by women should pass without comment.
“I’m a little suspect when it’s the first time a woman has
been appointed to something and nobody wants to talk

about it,’’ she said.

“When it’s normal, then, fine. Let’s not talk about it
because it’s not unusual and it’s not newsworthy.”

UC debates drug rule

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

The student-faculty University
Council debated the report of the
Drug Policy Review Committee
Thursday, with most of the discus-
sion centering on a minority report
by head dormitory counselor and
senior Executive Committee repre-
sentative Bob Tomaso.

Tomaso’s report opposed the com-
mittee’s recommendation that drug
possession not be a violation of Uni-
versity regulations. Tomaso said he
could foresee problems developing in
the dormitories if drug possession
were not policed.

“I’m far from making the dorms
dry,”’ Tomaso said. ‘‘That would not
be very attractive to someone who
might want to go to this university.”

A key point of the discussion was
whether alcohol and drugs should be
considered separate entities.

Student Bar Association President
John Sicilian said drugs should not be
viewed differently from alcohol. ‘‘I
don’t see arbitrary enforcement as
the answer,” he added.

“You encourage students to seek
help if they have a drug problem,’’ he
continued. ‘‘I don’t see this policy as
consistent.”

Another point raised was the possi-
bility of police involvement in the
dorms if drug possession were not
prohibited. Proponents of this view
said the policy would send a message
to the community that the University
is not upholding the law.

Some members of the council add-
ed that this might invite the police to
search the dorms more readily.

EC President Cole Dawson said it
would not be in the University’s best
interest to have the police frequent-
ing the dormitories.

“T was under the impression that
the freshmen in the dorms, with the
Honor System, were policing them-
selves,’’ Dawson said.

“The cops don’t need to come into
the dorms in that case,’’ he contin-
ued.

“If we condone police involvement,
then we are sending out a message

that the community needs to come in-
to the dorms and enforce authority.”’
Assistant English Professor Jean
C. Dunbar expressed a similar view.
“T think it is dangerous when civil
authorities police our academic en-
vironment,’ she said. ‘‘We might run
the risk of their influencing ideas and
creating unrest. We have practical
problems with the police already.
The reactions of the local police are
irrational....They are not easy to get
along with. If you’ve ever been stop-
ped for a traffic violation, then you
know how irrational they can be.”
Sicilian said, ‘I thought our gov-
erning system was set up to allow the
present student generation to decide
what they feel to be an offense. Only
a portion of the students feel that
drug possession is a violation. Should
these students be punished because a
small portion of the student body felt
they should?”’
Dunbar added, ‘‘We guarantee peo-

ple the right to live in an environment
without unlawful behavior.”

In general, the UC felt that the re-
port should be reworded to stress
that the University does not condone
illegal conduct, but rather doesn’t
take it as its responsibility.

The UC also examined the EC’s re-
commendation that “the use of ra-
cial, ethnic, or sexual slurs” be
changed from a major offense to a
minor offense.

Student Control Committee Chair-
man Darby Brower said that by leav-
ing this offense in the major cate-
gory, the SCC would have the ability -
to exercise the maximum penalty if it
were necessary. If the case did not _
seem to be a major one, then the pen-
alty could be lessened, Brower said.

Dunbar recounted an incident six _
years ago in which she was confront-
ed by a verbal assault, and the stu- «
dent was expelled from the Universi-

ty.

tions affecting only the individual in-
volved and those that also harm
others.

“Anything the individual does to
himself, it seems, can best be handl-
ed through the dean’s office,”’ he ex-
plained.

“He’s not affecting anyone else.
The disciplinary structure the com-
mittee set up deals with the effects of
an individual doing something to
someone else or doing something that
would harm the purposes of the Uni-
versity.”

eThe committee recommended
that a statement be published in the
University Catalogue specifying that
the faculty ‘‘does not condone’’ the
possession or use of drugs.

Jarrard said the statement is pri-
marily a clarification of the commit-
tee’s earlier offering. ‘“‘That’s what
we thought we’d said — this is just
more direct,’’ he explained.

“TI think we all want the same thing
— a reasonable disciplinary sys-
tem,’ he said. “‘It’s just a question of
how we go about it. Some people
thought there should be a strong:
statement in the policy.”

The statement also said that the
faculty does not condone ‘“‘overindul- :
gence in alcohol” and ‘‘possession or
use of alcohol by students not legally
entitled to purchase” it.

Student Body President Cole Daw- ,
son on Monday spoke to the faculty
about the drug report. :

“I expressed again our opposition,
to condoning that which society
deems unlawful,”’ he told the EC that
night. ‘‘I also stressed I didn’t want
the community to feel they needed to
police the dorms.”

“The people of the community .
should trust the University’s judg- |
ment and when we say we’re doing
something, that we do it — that’s in- -
herent in the Honor System,’’ Daw- |
son said.

At a meeting of dorm counselors<
last week, 21 of the 23 who voted op- ,
posed the committee’s recommenda-
tion that personal drug use in the
dormitories not be punished.

Girard indicted; trial is set |

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A jury trial has been scheduled
June 11 for senior Gene Girard, in-
dicted Monday by a Rockbridge
County grand jury.on a cocaine
charge.

The indictment charged Girard, 23,
of Coral Gables, Fla., with one count
of possession of cocaine with the in-
tent to distribute it.

Girard was arrested March 1 at the
East Lexington grocery store when,
according to Assistant Common-
wealth’s Attorney Richard J. Caba-
niss, Girard arrived to pick up a
package that was later found to con-
tain about an ounce of cocaine. At an
April 26 preliminary hearing, Gi-
rard’s attorney, Laurence A. Mann,
said the package could not be con-
nected with Girard.

Cabaniss presented the Common-
wealth’s case at the preliminary
hearing, but Commonwealth’s Attor-
ney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read said this
week he will prosecute the case be-
fore the jury. ‘‘As far as I’m concern-
ed, it’s a very important case,” he
said.

Girard is still under restrictions
imposed when he posted a $30,000
property bond, according to Rock-
bridge County Circuit Court Clerk D.
Bruce Patterson. Under those re-
strictions, Girard may not leave Vir-
ginia without court permission, Pat-
terson said.

Patterson added Girard’s name
does not appear on the list of those in-
dicted Monday who have agreed to
plead guilty on May 15 in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court.

The indictment was signed by
grand jury foreman Col. Albert S.J.
Tucker Jr., Sergeant R. W. Hall of
the Rockbridge County Sheriff’s De-

partment, the arresting officer, and
Sergeant E.W. Straub of the Lexing-
ton Police Department, who also was
involved in the arrest.

Among the 40 indictments handed
down Monday were two other drug
charges, one for selling cocaine and
one for selling marijuana.

Two other indictments issued
charged Frank Erwin Lane with
breaking and entering and breaking
and entering and grand larceny.
Lane is the former cellmate of Scot
Tanner Mesner, who was charged
with arson and murder in connection
with last spring’s fatal fire at the Phi

Gamma Delta fraternity house. The
charges against Mesner were drop-
ped in December.

One of the indictments against
Lane charges that he broke into the
evidence room at the Rockbridge
County Sheriff’s Office ‘‘on or about
February 1, 1985...with intent to com-
mit larceny.”’ Lane escaped from the
Rockbridge County jail Feb. 1.

The second indictment against
Lane charges that on the next day
Lane broke into Ruley’s Garage on.
U.S. 60 in Lexington and stole a 1973
Chevrolet wrecker from the garage.
Lane was captured later that month. —

Perdue charged with drug possession:

University senior David L. Perdue
was arrested early yesterday morn-
ing on a charge of possession of mari-
juana, according to Lexington Police
Chief L.0. Sutton.

Perdue, past president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, was arrested
about 1:20 a.m. Wednesday by Of-
ficer G.P. Joines at the corner of
Nelson and Davidson streets at the
end of the Nelson Street bridge, Sut-
ton said.

Sutton declined to provide further
details of the arrest. ‘I’m not going
to go into the evidentiary aspects of:
it,” he said.

Possession of marijuana is a
misdemeanor charge with a max-
imum fine of $1,000 and a maximum
sentence of one year in jail.

A hearing for Perdue has been
scheduled for June 4 in Lexingtor
General District Court.

The Alumni Office reserved 550
hotel rooms this year, more than 500
of which already have been filled.

Journalism Professor John K. Jen-
nings (’56), who chaired the 1985 reu-
nion committee, echoed Atkins’ en-
thusiasm for the weekend.

“One of the great benefits of these
class reunions is that it gives them a

chance to find out what has been go-,
ing on around campus,” Jennings
said. ‘‘We encourage the faculty to be’
particularly available at this time.” ,

Jennings added that the wide di-
vergence in ages among the alumni‘
doesn’t pose a problem. ,

“Since everybody seems to come_
back because of their interest in
W&L, they have a common meeting
ground, something to share,’’ Jen-,
nings explained.

“Since so much stays the same,
they can reminisce about college ex-;
periences even if they were here at
different times.” i

IFC studies Wed. night parties -

 

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council has
formed a subcommittee to study a
series of proposed Wednesday night
party rules.

Greg Wheeler a junior from Pi
Kappa Alpha, was selected to head
the committee at the IFC’s meeting
Tuesday night.

At that meeting, IFC represen-
tatives reported that the proposal of
limiting a fraternity to two midweek
parties a month, with a maximum of

two houses at any one party, was
generally well-received by fraternity
members.

Another proposal, that partygoers
bring their own beer instead of the
fraternities’ providing kegs, sparked
some discussion at the IFC’s meet-
ing, though.

One member expressed a concern
that if students have to provide their
own beer, they will be carrying it
around Lexington with them. In addi-
tion, this might produce an increase
in the amount of trash around town.

Another member mentioned the
possibility that girls might be more

restriction sooner or later.

- Parker and comedy: from a survival thing to NY and DC

‘

SCA

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

For sophomore Tom Parker, comedy has been no
laughing matter — it’s been a matter of practicality

As a youngster, Parker entertained his parent's guests
with five-minute stand-up routines

During adolescence, he used his comedic abilities to
help him become accepted by peers in a new city or
school

Now, Parker’s comedy may become a career.

Parker, a political science major from Fairfax, got his
first break into the world of comedy when, at the age of
14, he became one of the youngest performers to get past
the first round of the San Francisco Stand-Up Comedy
Contest.

Since then, Parker has developed his act to a point at
which he’ll be appearing on a regular basis this summer
at comedy clubs in New York, Philadelphia and Wash-
ington, D.C.

Parker really had never looked at comedy as a career,
though. Instead, it was just a way to meet people while
he moved across the country with his Navy family.

“It all started, I guess, pretty much as a survival
thing,’’ Parker said.

“Tt used to be a way to be popular — an artificial, in
stant way — just add water and you've got friends. It
was a way to blend in.”’

After his experience in the San Francisco contest,
Parker said, ‘I loved it. I was hooked.”’

But after spending two years in New Orleans, during
which he didn’t perform on stage, before moving to Fair-
fax, Parker said, ‘‘When I was ready to come to college,
I never thought I'd do this again.”’

Last summer, though, Parker, now 20, worked at a
Washington comedy club, The Joke Book, for a month.

“| think I was originally hired as a bit of a novelty, but
I proved I can do it,” he said.

During spring vacation three weeks ago, Parker audi-
tioned at several Washington clubs. This week he ac-
cepted an offer to work at a new club, The Laugh Trak,
and travel with three other comedians, ages 33 to 45, ona
circuit that includes Philadelphia and New York.

Parker actually started just by writing jokes. ‘‘I love
to write,” he said. “For a long time, I just wanted to be a
comedy writer.”

He soon realized, though, that he could perform as

well. “I’ve been a ham ever since I was little,” he added
‘‘T wanted to get up before I had anything real important
tosay.”

At first, his act was entirely prepared in advance, but
now, he said, he prepares 50 percent or less of his act

‘‘As I get older, less and less of my act is prepared,”’
Parker said. ‘‘I wing the rest of it. You can do 20 minutes
by picking up the newspaper or seeing someone or some
thing funny in the crowd.”

Parker’s acts are divided into ‘‘bits,”’ two- to five-min
utes series of jokes on the same topic, with transitions
between ‘‘bits.’’

Topics of his bits may range from Rockbridge County
hunters (who, Parker says, shoot more hunters than
they do turkeys) to religion (a favorite piece is one about
an argument over the check at the Last Supper). Parker
said he draws much of his material from his experiences
in the different cities he’s lived in and from small-town
life in Lexington

“I doa lot of small-town stuff, and people in D.C. think
that’s funny,”’ he said

Parker also has been able to work some Washington
and Lee material into his routine. ‘‘In some ways,
[W&L] takes itself too seriously. In some ways, it’s too

big,’’ Parker said. ‘‘The W&L man is funny sometimes
How women react to it, that’s funny.”’

Another source of his material is the television room in
the Student Center. ‘‘We’ll start talking about some-
thing, and everybody in the room will write it for me,”’
Parker said

“In everything I do, I start to say, ‘Well, maybe
there’s five minutes in that, maybe I can get a bit out of
that,’ "’ said Parker, who added that he tries to write
something every night

“Life is just a constant source of comedic material,”’
Parker added

Off the stage, Parker seems to have as many project
ideas as he does jokes. He'd like to form a troupe of
younger comedians, he’s started writing a play about
the television room and he thinks a television situation
comedy about college life would go over well

In the meantime, though, Parker will stick with trying
to move up in the world of comedy

“I’m a young comedian,” he said. ‘‘I could progress
nowhere in six or seven years and still be a young come-
dian.”’

“T work in clubs I’m not old enough to drink in.”’

| Religious adviser heading west

.

 

By STEVE CONNER
Staff Reporter

 

The Rev. Peter J. Bunder, assis-
tant priest at R.E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church and Episcopal
chaplain for Washington and Lee and
Virginia Military Institute, has
resigned to become Episcopal
chaplain at Purdue University and
vicar of the Church of the Good
Shepherd in West Lafayette, Ind.

During his three years in Lexing-
ton, Bunder has acted as an adviser

 

THE REV. PETER J. BUNDER
Will be chaplain at Purdue

and counselor on religious and per-
sonal problems for the students, fac-
ulty and staff of both W&L and VMI.

Before coming to Lexington, Bun-
der was a Roman Catholic priest,
serving as campus minister in
Lynchburg for Lynchburg College,
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
and Sweet Briar College from 1978 to

1981.

From 1978-81 he was vicar of Our
Lady of Peace Church in Appomat-
tox.

Bunder also has been an instructor
at Southern Seminary Junior Col-
lege, where he taught Introduction to
Ethics and Introduction to Philoso-
phy.

“The girls are fun kids — it has
been fun teaching at Southern Semi-
nary,’’ Bunder said.

Bunder said one of his primary ob-
jectives as Episcopal chaplain for the
schools was to try to integrate the
students into church and parish life.

R.E. Lee has a Sunday evening ser-
vice at the church for students during
the academic year, Bunder said.

These evening services draw as
many as 60 to 70 students during the
fall and winter months, Bunder add-
ed.

Some of the students serve the
church as Sunday school teachers,
choir members or lay readers, and
three students are authorized to help
with the distribution of communion.

Bunder noted that although his
position is to serve both the schools
as an Episcopal chaplain, his ties are
much closer to W&L than to VMI.

‘‘A lot of VMI students take part in
the church programs to get out of
some of their military activities and
responsibilities,’ Bunder said.

Bunder said that the needs of a
VMI student are quite different from
those of a W&L student.

“Some of the VMI students are
somewhat socially retarded; they
have fellowship or social needs,” he
added.

Bunder said he deals with Wash-
ington and Lee students by challeng-
ing them.

“The need of Washington and Lee
students is to challenge them with
accepting the importance of a liberal
arts education and to accept religion
as a serious matter,’ Bunder ex-
plained.

Bunder added that he believed a lot
of the problems that VMI students
face are related directly to the stress
they are placed under at the school.
He said many of the school’s students
have a difficult time talking about
their problems.

A. problem.,some. W&L._ students
have is setting personal goals too
high. If they do not achieve their
ambitions, they feel dejected and un-
successful, Bunder said.

He said the students are placed un-
der a lot of parental and peer pres-
sure to do well in extracurricular ac-
tivities, academics and social activi-
ties.

Bunder said students should not set
personal goals too high, and should
accept that whatever they accom-
plish, they are a success.

Bunder said coeducation will be
good for Washington and Lee and re-
grets he will not be here next fall to
experience the excitement of the
school’s first coeducation class.

“T think the students will become
more religious, because women tend
to hold religious beliefs very sacred
at an earlier age than men do,”
Bunder said.

“The question that has to be an-
swered is what the school is, since it

is no longer an all-male institution,”’
Bunder said.

“T think coeducation will be
great,”’ he continued. ‘It is a very
exciting time for Washington and Lee
because it will serve as the catalyst
for the school to take a look at itself
and explore its past history, decide
what the school is all about and what
lies in the future for the institution.”

Bunder also pointed out that the co-
education decision at W&L might
cause VMI to explore the idea of pos-
sibly becoming coed in the future.

Bunder said he has enjoyed his
three years in Lexington and has had
“‘an exciting job.”

“‘T love the students, their energy,
their intensity and their ability to ask
questions,’’ he added.

Bunder and his wife, Katy O’Mal-
ley-Bunder, will be leaving later this
month.

timents.

“The whole idea of a closed hear-
ing is that the entire committee is to
be neutral,” he said. ‘If we don’t feel
that we can be impartial, then we are
not to participate in the hearing.”

“What scares me,’’ Crutchfield
continued, ‘‘is that if the president
does feel strongly toward one side,
then he might gear the deliberations
to sway the committee into agreeing
with his viewpoirt. If he can’t vote,
then he might do anything in his
power to make sure his viewpoint is
represented.”

Other revisions include:

voiced similar sen-

Allowing a student being consider-
ed as an EC advocate for an open
hearing to sit in on the closed hear-
ing, to help prepare the EC’s case for
a possible open hearing. A change
last spring created the position of EC
advocate but did not allow the stu-
dent to be present during closed hear-
ings. By a 4-5-1 vote, the White Book
Revisions Committee defeated an ef-
fort to delete that provision. The EC
did not use any members of the stu-
dent body in prosecuting the one open
trial thus far this year.

«Making the same notation on a
student’s transcript whether he with-
draws after being charged, is found
guilty after a closed hearing or is
found guilty in an open hearing. That
notation would be ‘Withdrawn,
{date}, Student Not in Good Stand-
ing.”

eChanging the Section O confiden-
tiality clause to set up specific penal-
ties for violations of confidentiality.

The proposed clause reads: ‘‘Any

and all information about a possible
Honor System violation or an Execu-
tive Committee Hearing is highly
confidential. The Executive Commit-
tee will take the following disciplina-
ry steps against any student who
breaks this confidentiality: the ac-
cused or any witness in an Executive
Committee Hearing will be placed on
social or conduct probation or sus-
pended from the University. An ad-
vocate will be permanently suspend-
ed from the right to advocate Execu-
tive Committee matters. An Execu-
tive Committee member will be sus-
pended from office; however, if the
Executive Committee recognizes ex-
tenuating circumstances, he may be
placed on probation for one or more
Hearings.”

eGiving the accused at least 48
hours, rather than 24, between the
time he is charged and his closed
hearing and between a guilty verdict
in a closed hearing and his informing
the EC president that he wishes to ap-
peal to an open hearing.

The wait is over

Wa&L netters prepare for nationals

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

On Monday, the locker room of the
Washington and Lee tennis team re-
sembled a waiting room of soon-to-be
fathers. The team was awaiting the
announcement of whether they would
be among the eight teams invited to
the 1985 NCAA Division III Men’s
Tennis Championships which will be
held at W&L next week.

Meanwhile, Coach Gary Franke,
as the South Atlantic region’s repre-
sentative on the eight-person NCAA
selection committee, was taking part
in the selection of the teams in a con-
fidential conference call.

Finding the wait unbearable, the
team recruited a passerby to take a
note to Franke asking for news. Little
relief was afforded the players when
the note returned containing a lone
question mark.

Finally, after several hours of
waiting, the news came — W&L had
received the bid. The tension let loose
in the form of shouts and pats on the
back, for a season’s hard work had
paid off.

On Tuesday, the locker room bore
little resemblance to the nervous
silence of the day before. Music
blared from a portable stereo, tennis
balls flew in every direction and
members of the team engaged in

good-natured boasting.

In this lighthearted atmosphere
one sensed a uniquers this sorup of
two seniors, two juniors, one sopho-
more and four freshmen.

For W&L, a bid to the national
championships was by no means a
sure thing. The long road to nationals
was summed up best by senior cap-
tain Andy Haring.

“It looked bleak after our Roches-
ter loss [a 6-3 defeat at the hands of a
team that was ranked just above
W&L at the time and left the team’s
record hovering around .500],’’ Har-
ing said. ‘‘Things started turning
around after we beat Virginia Tech
{an impressive 5-4 win over the Divi-
sion I Hokies that led the Generals to
an 11-4 record by the end of the win-
ter term], and we really finished
strong [with a crucial 7-2 win over
Emory and a dominant performance
at the conference championships ].”’

Though in Division III the bid to
nationals does not entail fame and a
spot on the pro tour, the bid has
brought some additional work for the

team. An extra practice session in |
the morning has been added to the .
regular daily practice |

Generals’
schedule. W&L is looking to be as
prepared as possible for the cham-
pionships, which feature a field most
coaches are calling the most balanc-
ed since the championships began.

 

Woofter wins triathlon

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Third-year law student Bob
Woofter came from behind to take
the top spot in the 2nd Annual W&L
Triathlon held Sunday.

The triathlon, sponsored by W&L
Army ROTC, consisted of a three-
fourths of a mile swim, a 13-mile bike
anda 3.1 mile run.

Woofter, who placed second in last
year’s triathlon, finished the race
with a time of 1:31:32. W&L junior
David Lewis took second place with a
time of 1:36:26.

Woofter was placed in the second
heat and after he finished the swim,
he had to wait for Lewis to finish his
heat. Lewis threatened Woofter for
the lead, finishing the bike leg in one
hour and four minutes.

But on the run, Lewis fell prey to _

dehydration and had to second place.

Linksters finish fourth in ODAC

The Washington and Lee golf team
saved its best performance of the
season for the ODAC Tournament
Thursday and Friday, firing a two-
day team total of 624 to finish fourth.

W&L was led by junior captain
Greg Wheeler, who shot rounds of 77
and 76 on the par-70 Hanover Country
Club for a 153 total. Wheeler finished
in a four-way tie for fifth place in
individual competition, good enough
to earn him all-ODAC honors.

W&L shot a season-low 309 in the
first round to trail Lynchburg College
and Division II Randolph-Macon Col-
lege by 13 shots and Roanoke College
by two shots. Freshman Chip Gist
carded a 74 to lead the Generals.

The second round, marred by win-

dy weather, saw the team scores rise

somewhat. Lynchbuiy, ranked 10th
nationally in Division III, shot 308 to
edge Randolph-Macon by one shot.
Roanoke, which finished third, had a
313 total Friday, two shots better

Lax rebounds over Loyola

 

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

You'd think a lacrosse team that
just had suffered its worst loss of the
season and was down 7-2 in what
looked every bit like loss number
eight would hang it up.

Guess again.

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
Generals, a group that has seen little
in the way of scoreboard rewards in
’85, pulled itself out of a first period
hole against Loyola on Sunday and
rallied in the final quarter to defeat
the Greyhounds, 13-12.

“Tt got to a point [in the Loyola
game] where I think our guys were
saying, ‘I’m tired of this,’ ‘I don’t
deserve this’ and ‘I’m not going to let
the season beat us,’’’ head coach
Dennis Daly said. W&L then came
back and won the game.

The Generals (3-7) fell behind 4-0 in
the first quarter but cut the Grey-
hounds’ lead to 7-5 by the end of the
period.

“They came back because there
was something there, something in-
side them. They won that game for
themselves,’’ Daly said.

In the second quarter, the
Generals’ first and second defensive
units held Loyola scoreless and the
teams went to the locker rooms with
the score tied.

W&L fell behind in the third

quarter and started the fourth period
down 9-8. However, a goal from
senior attackman Mark Knobloch
knotted things to start a five-goal
final quarter for the Generals. Junior
attackman Bill Holmes scored the
game-winning tally on an assist from
classmate Caulley Deringer.

Daly said the Generals put forth a
total team effort to earn the victory.
“I think we played to our potential,”
he said.

Sparking the W&L victory were the
three-goal performances of senior at-
tackmen Rod Santomassimo and
Sandy Brown. Holmes and Knobloch
had two goals each in the victory.
Holmes also added three assists to
his work for the day. Junior G.T. Cor-
rigan registered three assists as well.
Goalie John DiDuro recorded 15
saves on the day.

The 1985 season comes to a close on
Saturday when the Generals face off
against University of Maryland-Bal-
timore County (UMBC) on Wilson
Field.

Daly isn’t sure how his team will
play on Saturday against the 2-10 Re-
trievers.

“T don’t know where we are now.
Certainly, we are a team that could
win three of its last four games,” he
said, indicating that preparations for
the final game were made easier by
the Loyola win.

Daly also said that the UMBC
game at home would give a chance to
show ‘‘what this team is capable of
doing.”

The Retrievers are also looking to
follow a big win. UMBC defeated
Maryland in its last outing, 15-14, in
overtime at College Park.

Senior midfielder John Rodkey,
who scored five times against the
Terrapins, including the game-win-
ner, is UMBC’s leading scorer with 21
goals and 10 assists. Other scoring
leaders for UMBC are junior attack-
man Jeff Flaig (17 goals, 8 assists)
and junior midfielder Mark Hodkin
(Il goals, 8 assists).

UMBC’s goaltending duties are in
the hands of junior Dan Schaffer.
Schaffer is averaging 13.4 saves per
game and is stopping 63.9 percent of
his opponents’ shots.

W&L leads the series between the
two teams, 4-2. The Retrievers won
last year, 12-8.

NBA playoff game in Detroit.

performance the situations of any playoff game and the particulars
of Sunday’s contest and you are left with an exhibition that is note-
worthy, if not downright amazing.

Detroit, down 2-1 in its series with Boston, was winning in Game 4
by four points at the half only to see the Celtics blast their way to an
11-point lead to start the final quarter.

Enter Mr. Johnson — that’s Johnson as in ‘‘J.’’.

Johnson proceeded to hit the ‘‘j’’ from all over the floor...and not
miss. The Pistons’ sixth man hit the first six attempts he had in the
second half while his teammates held the world champs scoreless to
start the final quarter. Johnson ended the game with 34 points, 22 in
the final quarter, to lead his team to the win.

Trivial facts and stats aside, it was fun to watch Johnson go.
Words like “‘uncanny,”’ ‘‘amazing,” ‘‘oh,” ‘‘my’’ and ‘‘gosh’’ seem
the only appropriate descriptive phrases. Johnson had one of those
moments that we all will watch on ‘‘Greatest Sports Legends’”’
someday, or at least on an ad for WTBS coverage of the NBA.

So what, my wonderful audience is saying. We saw the game, and
big deal, this sub comes off the bench and does well, again, so
what? Well it’s the old bit about watching excellence and admiring
it simply because it is excellence. It was not Boston vs. Detroit,
anymore, it was Vinnie vs. missing. And Vinnie won.

It is this kind of performance that makes us forget the plasticity
of the NBA and its second-season monotony. There are still good
games in the NBA, i.e., the league lives up to its hype.

But aside from any commercial benefit, we still have Vinnie
Johnson showing us what it means to be the best you can be. And it
is fun to watch that sort of thing. He gets the pass back outside,
goes up, double pumps and pow! It’ll go.

Fans cheer for that sort of thing, impartial fans cheer for that sort
of thing. Why? Because that is what this game and any game is all
about. It is the kind of thing you can see on the Little League field,
in an occasional intramural game or even in one of those football
games you and your friends used to play: somebody having a great
day, the kind of a day that everybody in sight stands up and takes
notice of. It is, as well, the only reason any of us ever goes out to
participate in anything: to have that good day and be the star.

And that is why we laugh out loud in spite of ourselves when we
see somebody pul! a Vinnie Johnson. Secretly, we are wishing for
the day when we, too, grab that spot in the sun, if only for a very
short while...

ruggers

From Staff Reports

 

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

A group of W&L rugby players converge on a VMI opponent in action from Saturday’s game.

The Washington and Lee rugby
club fell behind early in its match
against cross town rival Virginia
Military Institute and never came all
the way back, losing 10-6 on Saturday
at the P parade grounds.

The loss dropped the ruggers’
spring season mark to 5-3.

“It was a really close game
throughout,’’ said the club's acting
captain, P.J. lerardi. ‘‘In the second
half, we got close a few times but just
couldn’t put it in.”’

The lone score for W&L came in the
second half on a give and go from
lerardi to John Miller. Pete Papa-
savas added the conversion.

lerardi cited the play of Al Roberts
and Marlow Cook as exceptional de-
spite the loss.

The club concludes its season on
May 18 with a contest against the
Chesapeake Club.

Ninth-inning woes plague W&L baseball

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team concluded its season with three
tough losses, including a one-run loss
to eventual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament champion
Bridgewater in the tourney’s semifi-
nal. The losses put the Generals’
season mark at 6-21.

Yesterday, the Generals fell 7-5 at
home to Newport News Apprentice.

The Generals raced to a 3-0 lead in
the first four innings. Hugh Finkels-
tein singled in Bill White in the first
and Bill Curtiss scored White and
Finkelstein in the third with a double.

Newport News exploded for five
runs in the fifth to take the lead for
good at 5-3.

White did cut the margin to one in
the bottom of the inning, however.
Bill Schoettelkotte followed White’s
single with a double to score the sén-
ior co-captain.

Two runs in the eighth by Newport
News sealed the victory. Schoettel-
kotte’s solo home run in the bottom of

the eighth ended the scoring.

Yesterday’s contest marked the fi-
nal game as Generals for White, fel-
low co-captain Mike Jacoby and out-
fielder Chip Hutchins.

After defeating Lynchburg in last
Wednesday's ODAC quarterfinal, the
Generals were on the verge of mak-
ing their second consecutive appear-
ance in the ODAC championship
game only to have Bridgewater score
three runs in the bottom of the ninth
inning to win 8-7.

Schoettelkotte, playing first base in
the game, was a one-man wrecking
crew at the plate, driving in six of the
seven General runs with a grand
slam home run, a solo homer and a
runscoring single.

The sophomore’s grand slam and
solo home run got the Generals to a
toa 5-5 tie after four innings.

With a run in the fifth and a White
round-tripper in the top of the ninth,
W&L led 7-5 going into the last frame.
But Bridgewater capitalized on two
General errors in the ninth to rally
for the win. Freshman Carter

pitched well in relief of starter Pete
Detlefs before being replaced by
White in the ninth with the score 7-6.
White got one batter out before sur-
rendering a bases-loaded sacrifice
fly that gave the Eagles the win.

Monday, W&L was victimized
again by a ninth-inning collapse as
next door neighbor VMI scored seven
times in the bottom of the ninth to
defeat the Generals 10-9.

VMI scored two runs in the bottom
of the first against Schoettelkotte to
lead 2-1, but W&L regained the lead
in the second by scoring two more of
its own.

The Generals used nine hits in their
next six innings to build a comfort-
able 9-3 lead heading into the last of
the ninth.

In the Keydets, final at-bat, Schoet-
telkotte walked the bases full and
was then replaced by Steuart. He was
chased after VMI cut the margin to
one with a passed ball, a run-scoring
single and a three-run home run.

Detlefs was the next General to try
to stifle VMI. He gave up a double
to the first batter he faced, and the
runner went to third on a sacrifice
bunt. Detlefs fanned the next batter
for the second out, but VMI tied the
game 9-9 when a run scored on the
second passed ball of the inning.

VMI then loaded the bases again
with a single, an error and a walk.
White replaced Detlefs, but the
Keydets benefited from another W&L
error to score the winning run on a
ground ball.

Final pavilion concert
ends ° year of testing’

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Jim Hakim, lead singer of the Back Doors, entertained pavilion-goers
Saturday night in the SAB’s last concert of the 1984-85 school year.

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
“The Back Page”’ Editor

 

Last Saturday’s concert in the stu-
dent activities pavilion marked the
end of what the Washington and Lee
Student Activities Board calls ‘‘a
year of testing,’’ and the SAB says it
will soon be looking at what kind of
future lies ahead for the pavilion.

“T was kind of disappointed with
the turnout we had on Saturday,”
said SAB Entertainment Director
John Crawford. The concert featured
the Back Doors, a band that plays on-
ly the music of Jim Morrison and the
Doors.

Crawford said he felt the problem
with that concert and some of the
previous pavilion concerts was the
reluctance on the part of W&L stu-
dents to go to the pavilion to see some
lesser-known bands. ‘‘People turned
out for the shows like Thorogood, but
if the act doesn’t have a platinum
album, chances are there won’t be a
big crowd at the pavilion,” he said.

The SAB has spent this year exper-
imenting with different acts to put in

The Ring-tum Phi

the pavilion according to Crawford
The idea behind this, he says, is to
see what kind of acts the W&L com
munity wall support.

“We've tried to stay away from the
old stuff that everybody has heard,”
Crawford said. ‘‘We really want to
try to bring in some newer bands.”’

Crawford added that it is some-
times difficult to find acts for the
pavilion. The SAB, he explained, is
limted to bands touring in the area
and also by the amount of money that
can be spent on the concert. ‘‘A
school of W&L’s size cannot support a
$30,000 concert,”’ he said.

The SAB will begin making plans
for next year’s pavilion schedule as
soon as next year’s SAB membership
has been decided, Crawford said. He
added that the pavilion will still be in
active use next year, possibly with
one or two fewer concerts overall.

Crawford stressed the fact that the
SAB wants to provide the kind of en-
tertainment that the W&L communi-
ty wants to see and encourages stu-
dents to let the SAB know what kind
of acts they would like to see in future
pavilion concerts.

Lee-Hi: ‘It’s a must for a liberal education’

 

By PAUL DAVEY
and RUSTY JOHNSON
Restaurant Critics

 

Since spring term usually means
increased trips to Mary Baldwin Col-
lege, the traveling restaurant critics
have found a source of good food —
the Lee-Hi Truck Stop Restaurant.

The Lee-Hi, on U.S. 11 a few miles
north of Lexington, is a fine dining
center that offers more than its fair
share of atmosphere.

The food really is good. One of the
items from the menu we tried was
the cheeseburger. It. was the best
cheeseburger that we have tried in
Lexington. It contained real meat, a
good slice of cheese and fresh vegeta-
bles. It tasted like one of those good
burgers you usually find in a corner
drugstore. You really can’t beat this
burger — not even with a big stick —
especially with a price of $1.40.

The other selection we sampled
was a sirloin patty smothered in
beefy gravy that couldn’t have come
out of a can, and plenty of sauteed
onions. The serving was generous
and tasted homemade. It was accom-
panied by green beans and hot mash-
ed potatoes and gravy. This was a
good meal and when supplemented
with a healthy piece of apple pie
made for a filling dinner.

Of course, the life and death of a
truck stop revolves around one thing
— its coffee. The Lee-Hi brew is hot,
flavorful and it doesn’t taste like it
was brewed back in January.

Although they serve tasty, large
iced teas in big tumblers and syrupy
soft drinks, the complimentary water
tastes like it came out of a garden
hose.

Aside from the simple truck stop
specialities we ordered, the Lee-Hi
offers a wide variety of dishes rang-
ing from seafood (in Lexington?) to

lo-cal cottage cheese plates. A daily
special — for a reasonable price — is
offered. A typical daily special might
be ‘franks and beans”’ or a similar
down-home meal.

Along with the good food, another
attraction of the Lee-Hi is the atmos-
phere. Where else in Lexington can
one dine in the midst of CB radio ac-
cessories, night kits and various and
numerous alarm clocks?

The place is truly amazing. There
is a sunglass rack that has a mirror-
ed glasses that one might find in the
home of a motorcycle club member.
And if you like 8-track tapes, the Lee-
Hi now has them on sale for only
$2.99. If you don’t know which tape
you want, you can try to match a tape
with a song on the juke box.

Cartons and cartons of cigarettes
line the walls of the diner. We esti-
mated that there were more than 500
cartons of various brands of smokes,

Since it is generally our policy to

toward the rest rooms. We were
halted when we noticed the sign
above the door: ‘‘Showers.’’ We don’t
know about you, but the thought of
racing into a shower room loaded
with sweaty truckers did not strike us
as the brilliant thing to do. In the
name of safety over journalistic ac-

If you really want to experience the

Faculty OKs
drug policy;
board to vote

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

The faculty on Monday approved a
new University drug and disciplinary
policy that says Washington and Lee
“does not condone’’ the possession or
use of drugs or the overuse of alcohol.

The policy was endorsed at a 90-
minute special meeting of the facul-
ty. The plan, approved for a trial
period of as long as three years, will
be submitted to the Board of Trustees
for consideration at its May 24-25
meeting.

A student-faculty Drug Policy
Review Committee established by
University President John D. Wilson
at the request of the trustees had
originally recommended that drug
use or possession should not be pun-
ishable by the University.

The committee modified that posi-
tion and recommended that drug reg-
ulations continue to be enforced in
the dormitories after Head Dormi-
tory Counselor Bob Tomaso said that
the policy would put his colleagues in
“an impossible situation.’’ The Exe-
cutive Committee and a majority of
dorm counselors voted to support To-
maso’s view.

The faculty approved the 12-mem-

‘ber committee’s report as amended

and narrowly rejected a minority re-
port recommending additional facul-
ty involvement in the student disci-
plinary system.

Determined

Exchange student adapts
to changes in China, life

 

By PAUL J. SMITH
Staff Reporter

 

Some things are uncertain. For
Ying Wang-Yuen, a Washington and
Lee exchange student from Hong
Kong, much of life can be character-
ized that way.

During the Cultural Revolution,
Ying was arrested by Chinese au-
thorities in Peking. She was suspect-
ed of corroborating with other stu-
dents for the purpose of overthrowing
the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP). Ying spent three trying years
in a rustic, old prison, separated
from her family and her friends, an
experience that began her literary
career and resulted in the publication
of ‘‘Female Prisoner,’’ now in its sec-
ond printing.

Her experience in jail made her
philosophical. “I had to adapt to this
new situation,”’ she said. ‘I had to
know what my ultimate goal and
value was, and how I was to survive
to keep this goal.” She has kept this
goal alive, and is now a student at
The Chinese University of Hong
Kong.

Ying’s original interest lay in the
natural sciences. But since her three
years as a political prisoner in China,
she has decided she has a duty to be
actively involved in the future politi-
cal direction of China

‘When I went to jail, I decided to
study literature and social science,”’
she said with a radiance of will. ‘I

have a duty to China’s national fu-
ture.”’

Ying has spent much of her life in
the heart of Chinese politics, Peking.
In 1956, at the age of 7, her family
moved from Shanghai to Peking,
where she started elementary school.

As she advanced through school,
Ying became curious about her en-
vironment. ‘‘I liked to ask questions
when I was young,”’ she said.

Ying’s inquisitiveness pleased her
teachers, who thought her to be an
excellent student, but soon her ques-
tions became political. Her parents
began to worry. She once pointed out
to her teachers that a certain article
in the CCP Constitution guaranteed
every citizen the right to speak and
publish freely.

‘‘T didn’t think this was true,’’ she
said flatly. But her questions did not
end there. At one time, she actually
refused to join the Communist Youth
League.

“Every student wrote an applica-
tion to join the Communist Youth
League, but I didn’t want to. Then the
teacher asked me why I didn’t want
to write the letter. Because I could
not be sure that the communist party
was the goal of human society,’’ she
explained.

In 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong de-
clared the ‘‘Proletariat Cultural Re-
volution,’’ designed to promote an
idelogical transformation in Chinese
society by eliminating bourgeois ele-
ments from China’s past. Mao wish-
ed to invoke the ideals of the revolu-

standing with the University will be deleted.

EC President Cole Dawson and junior represen-
tative Pat Hayden voted in favor of withdrawing
the president's vote in closed honor hearings.

Richard Earles, a third-year law student and a
member of the White Book Revisions Committee,

in closed honor proceedings.

“Tt gives the accused a psychological advan-
tage,’’ Earles said. ‘‘This way, the accused knows
there’s someone on the EC who doesn’t have a

First-year law representative James Crutch-
field opposed the proposal and compared the pres-
ident’s role to that of a judge. A judge, Crutchfield

insisted, must act as an impartial moderator

away the president’s vote

throughout a hearing and then be asked to make a
decision after hearing both sides of an issue.

“‘T don’t see how taking away [the president’s]
vote will make him any less partial,’ Crutchfield

The proposal met similar opposition last week,
when several EC members said they thought the
student body elected the president to represent it
and taking away his vote defeated that purpose.

tion into the youth; thus he invited
the youth to become the vanguard of
his will, through the ‘‘Red Guards”
and political discussion movements.
Part of the revolution included Mao’s
desire to cleanse the party of his
enemies, especially Liu Shaogqi.

During the Cultural Revolution,
Ying was heavily criticized for her
statements by her peers, who labeled
her a reactionary. ‘‘My friends would
come up to me and scream ‘How can
you be such a reactionary?’ ’’ she
said. One time the students went to
her home, broke in and destroyed old
books, paintings and sculptures
which they deemed ‘“‘reactionary.”’
Her parents became more and more
concerned that her behavior was go-
ing to lead to trouble for the whole
family

She recalls her own and her fellow
students’ reaction to the Cultural

Revolution. ‘‘We learned that the
reality was so different from what we
had learned at school,”’ she said. ‘‘We
had a duty to change and reform be-
cause Mao gave us the power to
change.”’

One such reality was the elimina-
tion of Liu Shaogi from the CCP. ‘‘We
[students] thought Liu was good,”
Ying recalled. ‘‘He was most in-
terested in helping the economics of
China. Before Mao declared Liu
Shaogi an enemy, we were taught
that Liu and Mao and the whole
Communist Party were good.”’

As part of the Cultural Revolution,
Ying, along with her fellow youth, at-
tended political discussions. Later,
she was sent to Inner Mongolia with
25 other students as part of a govern-
ment-required regimen for political
reeducation that included living and
working with the peasants. The

according to psychology Professor
Leonard E. Jarrard, chairman of the
drug review committee.

Jarrard, who has headed his de-
partment since 1971 and for the last
12 years has taught a course about
the effects of psychoactive drugs,
called the plan “unique’’ among
schools and said ‘‘the students have
really gained by this.’’

“T think it really strengthens the
right of students to govern them-
selves, and I hope they’ll rise to the
occasion,’ he said. “‘It’s quite a
challenge for students.’”’

Jarrard said the amendments to
the committee’s report passed by the
faculty state specifically that the
Dean of Students has jurisdiction
over drug possession in the dormitor-
ies, but that the policy includes other
University housing and might have
even broader application.

“Any time the dean of students
hears about the use of a drug, I would
think he would talk to the person,”’ he
said. “If I were the dean, I would in-
terpret that to mean other areas as
well.”

Under the committee’s plan, Stu-
dent Control has jurisdiction over
cases involving drug sales and can
suspend or expel students for ‘‘major
offenses’’ delineated in the policy.

Those offenses include ‘‘sexual as-
sault, including unwanted sexual
touching,’’ the “use of racial, ethnic
or sexual slurs,” possession of drugs
other than marijuana with intent to
distribute them and the sale of mari-
juana for profit.

Henson found
guilty, fined in
Hunter death

From Staff Reports

 

 

Sophomore P. Edward Henson
pleaded guilty Friday to driving un-
der the influence of alcohol in connec-
tion with the March 17 death of junior
J. Christopher Hunter. A reckless
driving charge against Henson was
dismissed.

Henson, a 20-year-old from Dalton,
Ga., was the driver of the car in
which Hunter was killed after it ran
off the road about half a mile north of
Lexington at 1:30 a.m. A Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon official said at the time
that the two were returning from ‘‘a
fraternity gathering”’ in the country.

The Virginia Bureau of Forensic
Science found that a sample of Hen-
son’s blood taken shortly after the
accident had an alcohol level of .12
percent. Under Virginia law, a per-
son is legally intoxicated at the .10
level.

Rockbridge County General Dis.
trict Judge Joseph E. Hess suspend-
ed Henson’s driver’s license for six
months, Henson also was given a 12-
day jail sentence and fined $1,000, but
$800 of the fine and the jail sentence
were suspended on the condition that
Henson attend an alcohol education
program. The judge added that Hen-'
son is ‘‘not to operate a [motor vehi-
cle] after consuming alcohol.”

Henson, who was not represented
by an attorney, paid the $200 fine and
$20 in court costs.

He was instructed to, if possible,
attend an alcohol education program
in Georgia this summer, and, other-

OPINION

Gray matter?

“Racism” is an ugly word.

Ugly words abound on this campus.

The current racial tension on campus was altogether too
evident Monday night at the Executive Committee meeting,
where Student Association for Black Unity (SABU) member
Billy Rhinehart and members of the EC discussed the possi-
bility of a black ad hoc member to either the EC or the Stu-
dent Control Committee or both. Tempers began the slow boil
of exasperation.

Putting aside for a moment the question of token black
representation on any committee, we as a eampus need to
take a step backward and look at the situation in a large
perspective. Blacks at Washington and Lee are an obvious
minority. Out of a total enrollment of more than 1,700 on both
the law and undergraduate campuses, fewer than 25 students
are black. Until March, no black student had ever been elect-
ed to the EC. Black membership in social fraternities has
always been next to nil. During Rush deliberations last fall,
at least one house was divided over giving a bid to a black
student simply because of the color of his skin. Racial jokes
are exchanged among white students on and off the Colon-
nade. Black students, almost without exception, all sit
together in the dining hall, as if the table were reserved or as-
signed. Few black students have enjoyed prominent leader-
ship positions on campus.

It is more than coincidence that black history at Washing-
ton and Lee lacks luster and shine. We can assign some of the
blame to the school’s location (after all we did fight a war a
hundred years ago in part because of the question of the
rights of blacks). Other factors include the social structures
present at the school that do not encourage multiracial par-
ticipation and the expressions of white racial superiority still
felt by the very minute black minority. All of these in some
way encourage the continuation of the present system. For
many, it is very convenient that the SABU house on Lee
Avenue can house most black students who do not live in
campus housing.

In this case, though, out of sight does not mean out of mind.
We as a university community must address the problems
and questions of this racial dilemma.

The solution is not in another committee that will study the
problem and come to the same very obvious conclusions.
Pressing questions do not require mundane solutions. Rath-
er, it is time that we examine the petitions for black repre-
sentatives — or minority representatives, as the cases might
be — on the various committees of importance at the school.

First, the EC. While the EC’s job is primarily that of
enforcing the Honor System at this school, it does engage in
other important activities. Dispensing student tax dollars,

- hearing petitions calling for a cleanup of the town and revis-

ing the White Book are not racially sensitive issues. The
presence of a token (and it is tokenism) black or minority
representaive will not bring about any cure. Honor, in and of
itself, is not color sensitive, just as it is not gender sensitive.

- The same arguments can be used to defend the present struc-
- ture of the Student Control Committee and other subcommit-
- tees. All of this, however, only rebuts the argument of token-
: ism. It does nothing to change the status quo, where very real

problems do exist.
Perhaps the change needed, then, is not a structural or ad-

ministrative one, but instead a very personal alteration. Both
- sides need to do some personal examinations of attitudes and
’ opinions. Each side needs to consider and respect the opi-

nions of the other and see where changes can and should oc-
cur. Why are there so few minority members in social
fraternities? Why is there not more white participation in
SABU? What changes can we make to encourage greater
participation of minorities in each of those groups? What
changes can we institute for next year when the largest class
ever of minority students will be entering the University?

The problems of color-sensitive social life, campus leader-
ship and closet racism have no easy solutions. It will not even
be easy to tell when they are no longer problems. Simply be-
cause a black gets elected to the EC or joins a fraternity does
not mean all the problems have been solved. The victory will
only come with a change in the attitude of both sides and with
the recognition that merit far outweighs the color of one’s
skin.

New heroes or pacesetters?

 

By B. Scott
Tilley

  

sd

Two weeks ago, U.S. News & World
Report released its list of 10 people
that today’s youth most seek to
emulate. These “heroes” are suppo-
sedly the people that 18- to 24-year-
olds nationwide most admire and re-

spect.

First, the good news. American

youth once again are naming heroes.

More than four out of five of those
questioned could name at least one
hero. Only 19 percent refused to

name someone they considered per-
sonally inspiring.

According to the newsmagazine,
the late 1960s and 1970s were a bad
time for the emergence of heroes.
American youth were discouraged by
events in Vietnam and Watergate
and the general ‘‘malaise’’ in the
country that President Jimmy Car-
ter described during his administra-
tion.

But the new trend reflects an at-
titude among American youth that
there are, once again, public figures
who are inspiring and worthy of
emulation.

But now, the bad news: the
“heroes” that emerged from the sur-
vey. The list of heroes was as fol-
lows: 1. Clint Eastwood, 2. Eddie
Murphy, 3. Ronald Reagan, 4. Jane
Fonda, 5. (tie) Sally Field and Steven
Spielberg, 7. Pope John Paul II, 8.
Mother Teresa, 9. (tie) Michael Jack-
son and Tina Turner.

From Hanoi Jane to Dirty Harry to
The Flying Nun to the Papa, it is an
interesting, albeit disconcerting, list
of heroes. Granted, the list is natural-
ly going to be disconcerting to the ty-
pical Washington and Lee man be-
cause of the conspicuous absence of
General Lee, but uneasiness goes
much further than that.

As one reader of the publication

Ronald Reagan appear side-by-side?
“Someone is sick,’’ he wrote. Ms.
Fonda, who was dubbed ‘Hanoi
Jane” when she traveled to North
Vietnam denouncing American
forces and the American government
and inspiring the Communists to ral-
ly against us, deserves no place on
this list. Perhaps on a list published

MY VIEW

are the others from the world of en-
tertainment and motion pictures.

These celluloid stars include some
of my personal favorites: Sally Field,
from her days as the Flying Nun has
been my favorite actress, Eddie Mur-
phy is hilarious, Clint Eastwood is a
stud and Steven Spielberg is a genius
(E.T., Gizmo and Indiana Jones all
deserve an honorable mention on any
list of heroes. )

But yet, the fact remains that they
are admired not for who they are, but
for how well they can be somebody
else. Who is being emulated, any-
way? Or maybe, they are admired
because they can get away with mak-
ing mucho bucks for not even being
themselves.

Two singers made the list: Michael
“Thriller’’ Jackson and Tina ‘‘Come-
back Kid’’ Turner. Though I dislike
her music, maybe Turner’s come-
back is in fact something to be ad-
mired. But Jackson? The only contri-
butions I’ve seen from him are the
moonwalk, a catchy Pepsi jingle and
$30 concert tickets. If a singer has to
be included, my vote goes to Bruce
Springsteen, who strives to identify
with mainstream America and is not
commercial about it (although he de-
serves all of the accolades heaped on
him recently). Or even Billy Joel
(anybody who can land Christie
Brinkley earns my respect...and en-
vy).

Of those on the list, that leaves
Reagan, Mother Teresa and the
Pope. All deserve their place on the
list. Reagan, although all might not
agree with his policies, has revived a
pride in America among the people
and rejuvenated our reputation
worldwide. As a student at the Uni-
versity of Denver said, ‘‘He’s symbo-
lic of America. He’s a father figure.
He represents the American dream.”

The latter two both come from the
realm of the Catholic Church. John
Paul II has traveled worldwide in the
name of peace, and Mother Teresa
has given endlessly of herself to aid
the cause of the world’s oppressed
and downtrodden. Both are deserv-
ing, but both are themselves emulat-
ing another hero that used to be a
perennial choice for the list and
deserves a spot of his own (at the top,
I dare say) — Jesus Christ. :

The list is not only surprising
because of who is included, but also
who is not included. No longer do
adventurers, athletes, politicians
(with the exception of Reagan),
military men, business leaders or
scientists make the list. And those
that do qualify are of the ‘‘fly-by-
night”’ variety.

Jim Craig and the 1980 Olympic
hockey team were heroes for but a

brief period, and what has come of
our heroes of the 1984 Olympics? Why
is hero status so fleeting for the Mary
Lou Rettons, Phil Mayres, Greg Lou-
ganises and Edwin Moseses? During
my childhood one of my greatest
heroes was Johnny Bench. But on
this list, there are no Doug Fluties,
Julius Ervings, Dan Marinos, Dale
Murphys or Wayne Gretzkys.

The political realm, like the athle-
tic realm, has suffered through the
hero-for-a-day syndrome. Here to-
day, gone tomorrow types include
Geraldine Ferraro (remember
her?), Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson,
Margaret Thatcher, Sandra Day
O’Connor, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
Indira Gandhi and Desmond Tutu.
All are recognizable names with sig-
nificant contributions; none were
listed as heroes.

Other heroes soon forgotten in-
clude Sally Ride (remember the first
female astronaut?), Bernard Goetz
(the subway vigilante), Barney
Clark (the first artificial heart reci-
pient) and Lenny. Skutnik. You re-
member him. Three. years ago he
became a national hero when he dove
into the Potomac River to save a
flight attendant after Air Florida
Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street
Bridge in Washington, D.C.

Once, the greatest heroes came
from the ranks of the military. Gen-
erals Washington and Eisenhower
were great military heroes before
they ascended to the office of presi-
dent. The only names that emerge
from the military in recent years are
those of Gen. Westmoreland and Lt.
Calley. Americans don’t quite
associate them with hero status. But
our military deserves our respect.
The heroes are still there. What
about those who made the valiant in-
vasion of Grenada? Or the 240
marines who died at terrorist hands
in the cause of peace in Beirut? Or
the marine who tried to scribble
“Semper Fi’’ as he died? Or all of the
Vietnam War veterans? Maybe with
our pacifist society as it is, the
military is considered unpopular (an
unfortunate development). But at
least these men, because of what
they gave in the name of peace and
their country, should be recognized
for what they are — heroes.

And don’t forget those Ethiopians
who are valiantly fighting for life and
those, including some recently on
this campus, who are giving of them-
selves to aid in the survival effort of
thousands.

Along that line, USA For Africa
must be included, and thus maybe
not everything I said about Michael
Jackson is valid. It just shows that
our minds can be changed. Let’s hope
they continue to be.

the hearing aid more?’

hearing aid I am sure he would not
have understood the President to say
“the S.S. were victims of the Third
Reich just as much as those who
were tortured and killed during the
war.’”’ Ronald Reagan merely ex-
pressed his feeling that the lowly
draftee in Hitler’s army was a victim
comparable to those of the concen-
tration camps.

Adolf Hitler rose to power through
the legitimate democratic process of
Germany in that era. If called to
serve his country on the battlefield,
the lowly draftee would have no more
right to deny his commander-in-chief
than an American draftee would
have had to deny Franklin Roose-
velt’s order. These soldiers died
thinking they were serving their
homeland, mom and Mercedes Benz.
Even those Germans living closest to
the concentration camps at the time
of their liberation by U.S. troops
claim they were never aware of the
atrocities that occurred there. How
could one blame those fighting on the
battlefield for them.

It is true that about one in 50 of the
soldiers buried at Bitburg is a former
S.S. member. President Reagan,
however, has made frequent com-

ments to assure Americans and the
world that it is not this small minor-
ity he wishes to honor. But some con-
tinue to construe the visit as they
wish to construe it, not as the Presi-
dent has said it should be construed.
For the President to have refused
Chancellor Kohl’s request that he
accompany him to the cemetery
would have been to apply the concept
of collective guilt to the vast majority
of draftee soldiers buried there.

Let’s all try to listen to exactly
what the President says and under-
stand him. If we can not forgive and
forget the atrocities of World War II,
perhaps we can at least forgive those
who had the misfortune to be born in
the same country and same time as
Adolf Hitler.

Rights came to the fore in the 1950:
when conservatives and liberals
alike realized that the U.S. was be
coming increasingly embarrassed
claiming to lead the ‘Free World’
while overtly perpetuating the rank
est forms of political and economic
discrimination. Such practices weré
reinforced by economic harassment
physical abuse and outright murder
or lynchings tacitly condoned or igi
nored by the business establishmen!
and major political parties.

The responsible leadership of this
country was not satisfied with a win
dow-dressing law. Statistical evi
dence of results is a common-sens¢
requirement if you really want tc
achieve fairness in the workplace.

The argument that AA is responsi:
ble for the loss in relative income
among untrained and poorly edu:
cated workers in recent years is
hardly to be taken seriously.

While Professor Dean is deepl;
concerned over the personal anguis!
and self-doubt suffered by black:
who have been given jobs under the
pressure of both equal employmen!
opportunity and affirmative actior
laws, my concern is for the manj
W&L students who have taken jobs ir
family businesses or who have beer
hired by firms in which their fathers
and mothers, uncles and aunts and
grandparents have substantial influ.
ence. These poor fellows can never
be sure whether they have received
these opportunities through family
affirmative action (FAA) or on their
own merit, and my heart goes out tc
them as they anguish over their fat
paychecks — all the way to the bank.

boiling over
Phi omission

To the Editors:

We are puzzled by a curious omis
sion in what otherwise is an excellen!
review of places to obtain hambur
gers in Lexington. It is especialls
curious because the place to which |
refer has ‘burgers that have beer
called ‘‘the best in town’’ — not by us
but by customers. It is even more
curious, considering that the report:
er had to pass us by in order to react
The Phi office. We refer, of course, tc
the W&L Cockpit.

So that the reading public may be
more fully informed as to the options
it has to obtain hamburgers in town,
we would like to set forth our night-
time prices and options. A one-third
pound hamburger, plain, comes with
pickle and potato chips; it costs $1.55,
A plain cheeseburger costs $1.65. Our
famous hamburger special, which
comes with lettuce, tomato, French
Fries, chips and a pickle, costs $2.25.
The cheeseburger special is priced at
$2.40.

We offer two slices of bacon extra
for 45 cents and, unlike some estab-
lishments mentioned in the review,
we will cook our hamburgers to
order. We also have four types of
cheese from which to choose: Ameri-
can, Swiss, Cheddar and Provolone.

Clearly our omission from the arti-
cle was not due to some cost conside-
ration, limiting the review to those
places which offer inexpensive
hamburgers. The cheapest hambur-
ger of one of the reviewed places is
far more expensive than a hambur-
ger we can imaginably produce.

We would like to invite members of
the W&L community to join us, the
next time they desire to eat a
hamburger.

* students, including Ying, would work

“p? in the fields with the peasants during

the day and talk politics with each

* other in the evenings.

“‘We discussed the future of China
in Inner Mongolia,’’ she noted. How-

« ever, it would be those talks that
, eventually would get her into trouble.

Two boys who had overheard the

" student discussion group in Inner

Mongolia returned to Peking early
and were arrested for stealing came-
ras. In order to receive a lighter sen-
tence,they reported that the group in
Inner-Mongolia was discussing reac-

* tionary ideas. Three months later,

Ying traveled back to Peking to visit
her parents.

After about seven days in Peking,
she was arrested by the police and
charged with ‘‘discussing reac-
tionary ideas.”

From September to December of
1969, Ying was detained in a holding
center for less serious criminals. But
in December, she was interrogated a

, second time.

.

«

«

“T learned that some people in our
discussion group told the police that
we were discussing more than just
reactionary ideas,’’ she recalled.
“They said that we also wanted to
organize a secret political party to
overthrow the CCP central commit-
tee. All of these statements about
some secret party were nonsense.”

In December of 1969, Ying was

"charged with conspiring to over-

throw the government and was sent
to prison. She had never seen the in-
side of a courtroom. She had no idea
how long she would be forced to stay
in prison. She was totally cut off from
the rest of the world. She learned that
the other students in the Inner Mon-
golia group also had been arrested,
but she could not contact them be-
cause they had been sent to different

» centers. Moreover, she could not con-

«

*

tact her family.

“‘T could not contact anyone outside
the prison walls.’”’she remembered.
“I would often have the feeling that I
was forgotten....Sometimes I could
not identify myself.”

“In order to survive, I had to

, change my character. I could not de-

pend on my older norms, values and
morals. Everyone had to struggle
with each other for sleep, space and
food.”

Part of this struggle was knowing
who to trust in the wake of the accept-
ed practice of receiving a lighter sen-
tence by reporting on another’s
crimes.

“‘T had to make others think I was a
good person so they would not make
false accusations against me,” Ying
said.

“I had to control myself. I could not
open myself to others. I could not
trust others. This made me have a
strong character which let me sur-
vive.”

In prison Ying managed to avoid
physical torture, although she wit-
nessed many instances of it.

“The guards would force people in-
to [handcuff-type devices] for many
days. [It] was placed behind the per-
son so he could not sleep,’’ she said.

“They also used belts to tie one’s
hands, which would cut off the blood
supply. Some people would become
disabled because of this.”

Psychological torture proved to be
the most demanding for Ying. She
had no idea whether she would live or
be executed.

“There was no law,”’ she noted. ‘‘A
struggle or change in the central
committee could change your fu-
ture.”

“In prison, I remember thinking to
myself, ‘There is a truth to human
society, so if I can really know what
this truth is, than I have to push this
truth, but this can happen only if I
leave jail.’ ”

In 1972, Ying was released from
prison. She attributed this to leniency
on the part of the police, due to politi-
cal developments, particularly the
death of Lin Biao, the leader of the
People’s Liberation Army, who. was
very tough on suspected political
enemies of the CCP.

Ying spent the next four years in
Peking, where in 1977 she applied to
several universities, but was denied
admission because of her record as a
political prisoner. She was finally
accepted to a school, but was forced
to study a subject she had no interest
in. Later that year, her application to
go to Hong Kong was approved, and
she moved to the British colony to
join her relatives.

In Hong Kong, Ying wrote an arti-

- separately on each of the approxi-
‘‘mately 20 recommendations in the
‘committee’s 30-page report. He said
» votes were by voice except in the

case of close votes, which were taken

‘by show of hands.

Jarrard said the closest vote was

» the defeat of a minority report by two
~ professors and Dean of Students
*. Lewis G. John that said ‘‘any judicial

over discipline in major offenses
should have faculty representatives

With that in mind, the three propos-

* ed a Joint Committee on Discipline
_ that would be composed of six stu-

*-

dents and six faculty members.
Jarrard said ‘‘there was quite a bit

. of concern’’ about Student Control
~~ having the last word on all offenses.

“The Student Control Committee will

» be much more important than in the

past, much more responsible,’’ he

"said. “I hope the students will take
+ that into account in making deci-

sions.”’
“If they make the kind of decisions

' “But if the decisions they make do

the cases, I feel quite sure the faculty

+ will want to move in the direction of
, another committee with faculty
members on it.”’

According to Jarrard, several fac-
ulty members said a new procedure
for Student Control elections should
be considered. The 13-member com-
mittee now is made up of class
presidents and vice presidents.

Jarrard said the committee should
be composed of ‘‘not necessarily the
most popular students on campus,
but students who are willing to make
objective and fair decisions.”

“We hope there’ll be some discus-
sion,” Jarrard said, “I hope the stu-
dent body will look into the possibility
of special elections for the Student
Control Committee.”’

Jarrard said the process of discuss-
ing the report for the last six weeks
has been valuable for the faculty be-
cause ‘‘they’ve had a lot of input”’
and it “brought them closer to the
whole process of discipline.”

“There were some points of honest
disagreement, as you always find
among individuals with different
views,” he said, noting, however,
that there was ‘‘generally a surpris-
ing amount of agreement.”

Jarrard said that despite the occa-
sional liveliness of the exchange of
views, he doesn’t think it will have
“any permanent effect on relation-
ships” among faculty members.

“Most academicians are known for
expressing very strongly opinions
and attitudes that they hold,”’ he ex-
plained. ‘‘Being in a profession
where verbal skills are used all the
time, you can see why they express
themselves very forcefully, and that
was done here.

“‘But they accept the other person’s
right to express a point of view, even
if they don’t agree.”’

later earned a job as a foreign corre-
spondent for the magazine. She was
assigned to cover the latest political
developments in China.

“All this time, I went from Hong
Kong to Peking interviewing high-
ranking officals,’’ she noted.

In 1978, a democratic movement
started in China. Known as “Peking
Spring,” it would later be crushed by
Deng Xiaoping.

“‘T think our magazine was impor-
tant for this democratic movement.
It made the Peking government hate
our magazine very much,” Ying
said.

Since 1979, Ying has covered such
areas as Indochina, Korea, Japan
and Europe, for the Cheng Ming
magazine.

In 1983, she decitied to quit her job
with Cheng Ming and go to The Chi-
nese University of Hong Kong. ‘‘With
my job, I realized that my knowledge
about different subjects was some-
what limited. I wanted to improve

Ying plans to continue her educa-

W&L sees demand for more campus housing

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

Nearly 150 years ago, when Washington College
students were still expected to retire by 9 p.m. and rise
at 5 a.m. fora roll call and prayer, the school abolished
the boarding of students. Many of them then chose to live
in town, where, according to one current administrator,
they benefited from Lexington’s genteel society.

On the eve of coedcuation, Washington and Lee of-
ficials, responding to surveys, studies and what they call
plain old “horseback guessing,” are doing what they can
to have a new dormitory ready for the fall of 1987.

By the early 1990s, the University will have 1,500
undergraduates, 150 more than the present level, ac-
cording to Frank A. Parsons, assistant to the University
president.

In addition to that slight growth, Parsons and Univer-
sity officials anticipate a continued desire among stu-
dents in general to choose on-campus housing. They also
expect that women will prefer to live on campus.

The 240-bed dorm on West Nelson street will be design-
ed for upperclassmen and will offer a basic living unit
for four students.

Each suite will have a small living area and its own
bathroom, while every sixth or seventh suite will have
additional common areas, including a small kitchen,
laundry facilities and storage space.

Other features planned for the building include televi-
sion lounges, a main lobby, exercise and game rooms,
and possibly a computer terminal area.

Parsons said architects are currently at work on plans
for the horseshoe-shaped structure, which will be
designed to resemble house fronts.

With no requirement that upperclassmen live on cam-
pus, the University will have to make the dorm attrac-
tive to students, Parsons said.

“We're competing with the private market,”’ he said.
“We have to offer a good bit more than either the reality
or the perception of the freedom of off-campus housing.”’

Parsons noted, though, that achieving that goal ‘‘may
be more expensive than we can afford”’ and said that the
plans, therefore, may need to be “‘fine-tuned.”’

University Treasurer E. Stewart Epley said W&L will
likely borrow $6.5 million to construct the dormitory.

The Industrial Development Authority of Rockbridge
County will meet Wednesday to consider the Universi-
ty’s request to issue $7 million in industrial revenue
bonds to raise funds for the construction.

The IDA sells its own bonds at the request of in-
dustries, banks and organizations such as W&L, and of-
fers tax-exempt interest to the bonds’ buyers. The IDA
then lends the proceeds at nine or 10 percent interest,
Epley explained

The University could issue its own bonds, Epley said,
but the interest would be taxable for buyers, and the
University would be, in effect, paying 12 to 13 percent for

Plans for a revamped freshman
orientation program emphasizing
tradition and involvement were dis-
cussed Friday with the Alumni
Association Board of Directors.

Alumni Director Richard B. Ses-
soms said a committee of the board
talked for an hour with Dean of
Students Lewis G. John and Dean of
Freshmen H. Robert Huntley about
the possibilities for the freshmen’s
first week.

The board met in Lexington during
Alumni Weekend, which included re-
unions for 10 classes ranging from
1935 to 1980.

Sessoms said freshman orientation
this fall will ‘“reemphasize our his-
tory and heritage — the civility, the
speaking tradition and, of course, the
Honor System.”

“That’s what the alumni want to be,
assured about with this particularly
critical freshman orientation,” he
said.

“We're going to reintroduce some
of the things that in my view have
sort of slipped between the cracks,”’
Sessoms said.

“If you don’t teach the freshmen
the words to ‘The W&L Swing’ during
orientation, pray tell when do you
teach them?” he said. ‘I think the
impression you gain in the first days
and weeks of college stay with you.”

“The key is finding a way to do this
that’s appropriate in the mid-1980s,”’
he said. ‘‘I’m not suggesting a return
to bonfires, beanies and the Assimila-
tion Committee, but trying to engen-

the money.

Epley pointed out that over 25 years, three or four
percentage points could add up to huge savings for the
University.

Another option for W&L, according to Epley, is the
Virginia College Building Authority, a state rather than
county organization that issues bonds on terms similar
to those of the IDA.

He said W&L has worked with that organization three
times in the past — in 1975 for the construction of Woods
Creek Apartments and for the renovation of the Univer-
sity power plant, in 1979 for the financing of the Com-
merce School renovation and to expand Evans Dining
Hall and its kitchen, and last year to refinance the
University library.

The University spent $240,000 last month to acquire the
property at the intersection of Nelson and Washington
streets, the present location of the Wometco Inc., a Coca-
Cola bottling company, and for the adjacent property at
223 W. Nelson St. known as the Ackerly home.

“The assessed value of the Coca-Cola plant is pretty
close to what would have been a fair price,’’ Parsons
said. He said the same was true for the Ackerly proper-
ty.

Five years ago, the Roanoke-based parent of the
Wometco distributing facility offered to trade the pro-
perty to the University in return for a new site in the
Lexington area, Parsons said. He said the deal offered
attractive tax benefits for Wometco.

The Board of Trustees approved the plan and allotted
$175,000 for the University to set up the distributor in
another location.

Parsons said he is unsure why Wometco did not follow
through on the offer, but said it is no longer a possibility

As owner of the proposed dormitory’s location, the
University must now convince the city of Lexington that
the development plans are acceptable.

W&L has received initial setbacks in its request for a
new institutional zone based on a model used in Rich-
mond. The school is required to submit a master plan of
all its development aspirations that must be approved
by the Lexington Planning Commission and the council.

The master plan is being prepared by GWSM Inc., a
Pittsburgh architecture and landscaping firm the Uni-
versity has dealt with for 17 years, Parsons said.

The plan, which is expected to be completed by next’
Thursday, includes the new dormitory, a proposed)
theater at the site of Lexington’s old train station, addi-
tional athletic practice fields, plans to move the admiss- °
ions staff next to the Alumni House and development of- -
ficials to Washington Hall, the Morris House renovation
and parking considerations. :

Parsons said the University hopes the Planning Com-
mission will approve the master plan by mid-June and
hopes the City Council will accept it by early July or '
August. He said the goal is to begin construction by
December or January.

Fall orientation to stress W&L heritage

der pride in the University for its own
sake.”

“If the men and women of the
freshman class come to a tailgate
party at the first football game with
undergraduates and law students
and a band playing ‘The Swing,’
they'll think that’s the way it’s al-
ways been at Washington and Lee,”’
Sessoms continued.

“If you’re here and you’re a fresh-
man and you walk across the foot-
bridge and you see the University
coming together in support of each
other and a major athletic team, it
becomes ‘not cool’ to come late and
leave early.”’

“If the experience of the first coed-
ucational class — both men and wo-
men — is uniformly good, that will be
the best thing that could happen to
the admissions program of Washing-
ton and Lee University,’ Sessoms
said. ‘‘On the other hand, if that ex-
perience is bad, it won’t take long for
the whole world to hear that.’’

‘“‘All of it starts with orientation
week,” he said.

Other highlights of Alumni Week-
end:

The board received a report from
Admissions Director William M.
Hartog III that Sessoms said shows
“there is mounting evidence’ that
the coeducation transition will be a
successful one. “To Bill Hartog’s
everlasting credit, no one is declar-
ing victory yet,” he said. ‘“‘To quote
him, ‘We’ve only cleared the first
hurdle.’ ”’

eA panel chaired by Associate
Dean of the College Pamela H. Simp-
son discussed ‘‘Women at Washing-

ton and Lee: Past, Present and Fu-
ture’ with what Sessoms described
as a standing-room-only crowd in
Northen Auditorium. ‘Everybody
came away from that feeling awfully
good,” he said. ‘“The panel revealed
the depth of the Coeducation Steering
Committee’s work.”’

eThe Alumni Board received re-
ports from student body President
Cole Dawson and his successor, John
Lewis, and Lewis addressed the ban-
quet of the 25th reunion class (1960)
at Natural Bridge Hotel.

eSessoms said his Saturday ad-
dress to the Alumni Association dealt
primarily with Kathekon, the student
alumni association formed this year.
“Students, after all, are alumni in
residence,” his speech text said.
“The analogy is that of a baseball
farm team. I avoid bragging on
them, but I will allow that our rookies
can field, and they hit for distance.”’

eThe Alumni Board, according to
Sessoms, is becoming ‘‘a more acti- |
vist” rather than simply an advisory

_ body. “The emphasis has been to no-
minate and elect alumni who have
been active as chapter presidents,
class agents for the Annual Fund and
Alumni Admissions Program repre-
sentatives so they bring to the board
true experience,’’ he said. After ad-
ding the members elected this week-
end, the board will have 19 members,
and it will grow to 20 after next year’s
elections, Sessoms added.

Details of the arrest early last
Wednesday of senior David L. Per-
due on a marijuana possession
charge were released yesterday by
Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton.

Perdue, a European history major
from Atlanta, is the outgoing Inter-
fraternity Council president.

Officer G.P. Joines found approx-
imately one quarter of an ounce of
marijuana in a plastic bag in the
glove compartment of Perdue’s car,
according to the arrest report.

Perdue was arrested after Joines
confiscated an 8mm Mauser rifle

from the car, the report stated. The
gun was later returned.

Attached to an air conditioning
vent were two hemostats, clamplike
devices that can be used in mari-
juana smoking, Joines said. The
clamps contained marijuana resi-
due, according to the report.

Perdue’s car was stopped after
Joines observed it traveling at a high
rate of speed on East Washington
Street and after the tires screeched
at the corner of Washington Street
and Lee Avenue.

Perdue passed a field sobriety test,
the report said. A court date has been
set for June 4, two days before grad-
uation.

A former Lexington police officer
was sentenced to 12 months in jail,
with 11 months suspended, yesterday
after he was found guilty of an as-
sault and battery while on duty.

The former officer, Richard H.
Rice, was appealing a March convic-
tion in Juvenile and Domestic Rela-
tions Court, and his attorney, Marc J.
Small of Roanoke, said he would ap-
peal yesterday’s conviction in Rock-
bridge Circuit Court.

Rice was fired by Police Chief L.O.

be receiving a list of procedures
as to how officers should act when
investigating a house. “If one of
my officers doesn’t follow these
procedures, let me know,”’ he ad-
ded.

Sutton’s main emphasis on the
procedures was that if fraternity
members are “brassy” with him
or his officers, the house may be
punished.

Sutton also said that if sound
equipment is confiscated at a par-
ty, the police will hold it until the
court date. A fraternity found
guilty of a misdemeanor charge
could be fined up to $1,000 and its
president or vice president could
spend up to 12 months in jail.

 

Rice is accused of assault and bat-
tery in connection with a New Year’s
Eve incident in which a 17-year-old
Lexington youth said he was hit twice
by Rice — once while handcuffed in-
side a police car and later while
awaiting treatment at Stonewall

Andrew Caruthers and Shayam

Much of the debate about this pro-
posal centered on whether to add this
statement to the transcript of a stu-

Dawson originally said he felt that
differentiating between guilty stu-
dents and those who withdraw early
could create preblems.

“We're encouraging him to leave
before the closed hearing,’’ Dawson
said.

Hayden and Dalton said this new
proposal added an unneeded moral
judgment to the Honor System.

Crutchfield said he opposed any

should be strictly private within the
University,” he said.

“I don’t think we should punish
someone for going open,’’ he con-
tinued. ‘‘I don’t think the purpose of
the Honor System is to punish any-

The question of whether to apply
the new policy to both open and clos-
ed hearings or to differentiate be-
tween the two also elicited consider-
able debate.

Dawson said applying the new poli-
cy only to those found guilty in open
hearings would discourage people
from exercising their right to an ap-
peal.
“T think this flies in the face of the
idea of the appeal,’’ Dawson said.

The use of the word “‘expelled”’ in

Novice tennis
-—68th in nation

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

Making their first appearance ever
in the team competition of the NCAA
Division 111 Tennis Championships,
the Generals finished the three-day
tournament in eighth place.

Washington and Lee lost all three
of its matches in the event. The losses
were all to teams ranked higher than
the Generals.

The last-place finish in the eight-
team event was termed a
“disappointment” by team mem-
bers. However, the players were also
quick to point out the positive aspects
of the team’s play in the tournament.

Referring to the team’s many
strong performances in the competi-
tion, senior captain Andy Haring
said, ‘‘We showed that we deserved
to be here.”’

In their first match, a 6-3 loss to
eventual national champion Swarth-
more, the Generals had several
strong showings. No. 3 Jack Messerly
was in complete control in his match.
He baffled his foe, Eric Prothero, one
minute hitting topspin lobs to the
baseline and the next laying down
drop shots within a few feet of the
net.

In doubles, Messerly.and partner
David McLeod, who pushed the na-
tion’s No. 1 player Jeff Krieger to a
second-set tiebreaker, were impress-
ive in their upset of the nation’s No. 2
doubles team of Kreiger-Shep David-
son in three sets, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.

At No. 3 doubles, Andy Haring and
Chris Wiman also won, defeating
their opponents 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.

Tuesday’s consolation semifinal
against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps
was a Classic example of excitement
in team tennis.

After singles, W&L had the edge in
the match, leading by a 4-2 margin.
The match was in no way over as the
Stags claimed victories at Nos. 1 and
3 doubles to set the stage for the
decisive match at No. 2 doubles.

W&L’s team of Roby Mize and
Scott Adams lost the first nine games
of the match, but they got back in
gear and won five of the next six
games to lead 5-4 in the second set
with the Stags serving. Tension
mounted for players and spectators
alike as Claremont held serve to knot
the match at five games all.

With each point seeming as long as
and as crucial as an individual game,
W&L came within a game of winning
the set at 6-5.

The set was destined for a tie-
breaker, and Claremont, which had
won two tiebreakers in the singles
competition added a third to its day’s
work. This last breaker went to the
Stags 7-4 to give them the match 5-4.

Yesterday, the Generals went
against Gustavus Adolphus, losing
6-3.

Though the team members had
individual regrets about various
aspects of their matches, there was a
general feeling that the team’s lack
of familiarity with the kind of con-
sistently high level of play at na-
tionals was a drawback to their ef-
forts.

“Experience was the difference.
We didn’t win the big points,’’ Adams
said. Indeed, six of the seven other

teams competing had been to nation-

timer, Carleton, had matches in the
regular season against four of the top
eight teams.

The future looks bright for the
Generals, the players said. As Mize
indicated, ‘‘Next year is The Promis-
ed Land. We have five returning
starters and several good recruits.”

But 1985 is not yet over for some of
the Generals. McLeod, Mize, Messer-
ly and Haring began singles competi-
tion today, and the doubles teams of

Haring-Wiman will begin play this

Swarthmore takes title

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Swarthmore won the team com-
petition at the NCAA Division III
National Championships last
night with a 5-4 win over Kalama-
zoo. Although the match began at
the outdoor site on the Washington
and Lee campus, the teams finish-
ed play at the Staunton Indoor
Racket Club when rain forced the
suspension of the match.

After the completion of the sin-
gles competition, the two teams
were tied at 3-3. Swarthmore pick-
ed up wins at singles numbers
two, four and six. The Little
Quakers then won two of the three
doubles matches to capture the
Division III national title.

After Kalamazoo won the num-
ber one doubles and Swarthmore,
won the number three doubles, the
match remained tied at 4-4 with

the number two doubles flight still
on the court. Swarthmore came
from behind to win that match ina
third-set tiebreaker.

Swarthmore, the tournament’s
number-two seed, advanced to the
championship round with a 6-3
first-round victory over W&L and
a 6-3 semifinal win over third-
seeded St. Thomas.

Kalamazoo, the tournament’s
number-one seed, reached the
finals by defeating Carleton 7-2 in
the first round and fourth-seeded
Redlands 5-4 in the semis.

Redlands won third place in the
team competition with a 5-1 win
over St. Thomas. The match was
stopped after Redlands clinched
its fifth victory in singles so that
the two teams could watch the
championship match.

Individual competition started

today and will continue through
Sunday.

 

 

Fast times not fast enough

Four Washington and Lee track
team members failed to qualify for
the NCAA Division III National
Track and Field Championships last
weekend at the University of Virginia
Invitational Track Meet.

Commenting on the individual per-
formances last weekend, head track
coach Norris Aldridge said: ‘‘Every-
one did well but not well enough to
qualify.”’

Although he ran his second fastest
time of the year, freshman Andy
White failed to qualify in the 110-

meter hurdles with his time of 15.2
seconds, In the shotput, Tim Murray
had his best throw since he has been
at W&L with a distance of 47’ 1/2”.
Junior Jim McLaughlin won the jave-
lin throw.

Senior Mark Pembroke set a new
school record in the 800 meters with
his time of 1:53.1, but failed to make
the qualifying time of 1:52.3. The pre-
vious W&L record in the 800 was
1:53.3.

Pembroke tried once more to quali-
fy on Wednesday at a qualifying meet

Like the weather on Saturday, the
Washington and Lee lacrosse team
threatened to make things unplea-
sant for the University of Maryland-
Baltimore County, but in the end it
was the sunshine and the Retrievers
prevailing, 9-6.

The Alumni Weekend crowd saw
W&L take the lead in the first quar-
ter, fall behind in the second, come
back in the third, but lose the game in
the fourth quarter when UMBC
scored the game’s final two goals.
The Retrievers’ defense held the
Generals scoreless for the last 21
minutes of play.

“We were unable to control the
tempo after the early part of the
game,” said W&L head coach Dennis
Daly.

Retrievers’ head coach Dick Watts
said his team was riding a high after
beating Division I top tenner Mary-
land the weekend before, 15-14 in
overtime.

‘“‘Anytime you have a game like we
had last week [against Maryland], it
has to build confidence. Our guys are
saying, ‘Hey, wecan play,’ ’’ he said.

The Generals did take the lead ear-
ly, though. Goals from attackmen
Keith Scott and G.T. Corrigan, who
scored on a behind-the-back shot, put
W&L on top 2-0 with 9:21 to play in the
first period.

However, UMBC surged back to
score the next four goals, two ooming
on man-up situations. Daly said the
man-ups took the Generals out of
their zone defense, which had been
successful early, and led to some in-
side scores. Three of the four tallies
came from right in front of W&L net-
minder John DiDuro.

W&L came back to tie up things
midway into the second quarter.
Sophomore attackman Steve Giacob-
be got a feed in front from junior
Caulley Deringer, and senior Rod
Santomassimo took advantage of a
man-up situation for the Generals’
third and fourth scores.

UMBC closed out the first half with
three goals, two scored from junior
attackman Jeff Flaig, who finished
the day leading all scorers with three
goals and three assists.

In the second half, the Ger ‘als

came out firing and cut the Retrie-
vers’ margin to one by the 6:41 mark
of the third quarter.

“T think we were upset with the
first half,’’ Daly said

Senior Mark Knobloch scored first
from long range. Then, Corrigan ad-
ded his second tally after UMBC
goalie Dan Schaffer was sent off to
serve a penalty after he shoved W&L
attackman Bill Holmes to the ground
during a dead-ball situation.

But Schaffer replaced his backup
David Miller immediately. He and
his teammates then proceeded to
shut down the W&L offense.

“In a sense, their defense was able
to contain us,’”’ Daly said, ‘‘but we

couldn’t maintain the tempo of the
game.”’

The Retrievers added two insur-
ance goals to close out the scoring,
the last coming just 12 seconds before
the end of the game.

UMBC head coach Dick Watts
cited the play of his defense as key to
the win, noting especially the play of
sophomore defensemen Jim Bime-
steffer and Tom Boyce.

“Our six long sticks did an excel-
lent job,” he said.

two assists. Once again DiDuro was

eighth loss on Saturday.

ly acknowledged the  senior’s
superior play throughout the season.

“The goalie is in a position where
he has the responsibility of being the
last line of defense. This year, John
DiDuro has handled that responsibili-
ty with aplomb,”’ Daly said.

The Generals’ mentor said the
game was closer than the 9-6 score
might indicate, noting that there
were a number of errors that could
have ended up going in the Generals’
favor.

“It was just that type of game. It
wasn’t particularly bad,”’ he said
“They took better advantage of our
mistakes than we took of their mis-
takes.’”’

 

 

No excuse

....Ninety-five percent of you out
there should be ashamed of your-
selves. And that’s putting it as nicely
as it can be put.

Fan support at Washington and
Lee sporting events has been... .
well, it hasn’t been. The state of
things might have been tolerable
. “4 ' 5; (read: expected), but after Mon-
day’s attendance for W&L’s match in the NCAA tennis championships,
I think we’ve gone beyond the point of tolerance.

It is sad that as a rule no W&L sports teams receive student fan sup-
port. It'is sad because recognition among your peers is the greatest
compliment any athlete can receive. And it is sad because being the
home team is something that should be used to one’s advantage. Un-
fortunately, time and again at W&L, the home team, through no fault
of its own, is unable to use that advantage because there are no fans to
tip the scale in its favor.

What I saw Monday — or rather didn’t see — was the kind of thing
that leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. And why? Because I
knew that a good number of assembled peers easily could have made
the difference between winning and losing. Tennis — and it can be
equated with football, basketball and even a student play — has the
quality of putting one in a me-against-the-world position. A word of en-
couragement or simply one’s presence can do wonders to alleviate
that feeling. It’s that ‘‘Hey, I’m with you, buddy”’ attitude that is miss-
ing almost everywhere you look on this campus, and it was painfully
obvious out by the tennis courts on Monday — and on Tuesday and
Wednesday, for that matter.

It is as if nobody made it a point to know what was going on. The in-
formation was there to be found. But still there were more tennis
players and officials than fans.

Sure, there was a problem with the signs telling what time the team
would play on Monday listing the wrong time. But they were corrected
before 9 a.m. on Monday. So, in fact, there was not a problem — that
is, if you don’t consider yourselves a problem.

And I don’t think this tirade should limit itself to the students. With
the noteworthy exceptions of the athletic department and President
Wilson, I don’t remember seeing any of the faculty in attendance.
Would it be out of line for a professor to say to his or her class, ‘‘Go out
and watch the tennis matches today’’? And is it asking too much again
to pull yourself away from that schedule of yours that really isn’t all
that busy to watch some of your students play for the national cham-
pionship, or sing in the glee club?

One of the great things about Washington and Lee is that much-
ballyhooed family atmosphere of the small college. As I watched the
matches this week, I wondered where the rest of the family was.

Ultimately, there is no excuse, and all of you who weren’t there at
the tennis matches and haven’t attended events all year know that as
well as I do....

....Glancing down the Colonnade, congratulations to the tennis team
on its eighth place finish at nationals. Hard work does pay off. A word
to the wise: This crew will be back in the thick of it again next year and
the year to follow and the year that follows that one...Another tip of the
cap to Page Remillard’s aquatics program and two of its many stand-
outs — water polo players Bobby Pearson and Tim Stanford were
selected first team all-America last week....

...That new game show, “NBA Lotto,” was fun, and those who
claim it really wasn’t fair because the worst team won’t get the best
talent should take a second look at last year’s mad dash for last place.
Picking numbers out of a hat is a lot more constructive than cheating
tolose....

Total Theatre: not just ‘hammers and nails’

Improving Shakespeare:
W&L profs rewrite ‘R&J’

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

The description in the University
Catalogue is not particularly speci-
fic:

“Drama 139 — Total Theatre (6) A
study of the technical aspects of di-
recting and acting problems assoc-
iated with a specific style of drama-
tic literature culminating in produc-
tion of a play within that style.”

What does this mean in practical
terms?

‘No papers, no homework, but you
have to work hard all the time almost
every day,” said junior drama major
Chris Carmouche.

For the students who take Total
Theatre, the work begins each week-
day with technical rehearsal from
9:30 a.m. until noon. Another rehear-
sal begins at 1 p.m. and runs until 5.
Evening rehearsals are frequent, of-
ten going until 10:30.

“The pace is very great,”’ said Jo-
seph Martinez, assistant professor of
drama at W&L and the current direc-
tor of the course. ‘‘But after some
grumblings, [the students] do just
fine. Sometimes I have to ride the
students a little at first, but after a
week or so, everyone gets used to it.”

The value of, the course, Martinez
said, is that everyone is involved with
each phase of the production. In addi-
tion to playing their roles, the stu-
dents must build the sets, design
their costumes and participate in
other facets of a production with
which many of them are inexperienc-
ed.

“Coming in at 9:30 in the morning
to do tech rehearsals was a new ex-
perience for me,” said Christina
Fischer, an exchange student from
Hollins College. ‘‘It gives you a good
knowledge of what goes into a pro-
duction.”

“The course lets you know what

Lee Chapel.

 

W&L drama Professor Joseph Martinez explains
some final details to Greg Stites and the rest of Total

each of the people in a production are
up against,” Carmouche said. ‘“‘It
makes you more sympathetic to the
problems of the lighting people or the
set people or the actors or what-
ever.”’

Martinez said that this year in par-
ticular, the ‘total’ in Total Theatre
is being emphasized.

“In the past, we had more people in
the class, so it was possible to have
some people working in tech alone,”’
he added. ‘‘But this year I wanted to
make everybody do everything, to re-
connect with the ‘total’ concept.”’

This approach to the course is very
demanding, and Martinez termed
himself ‘‘a stringent disciplinarian.”’

“Some of the students were not

when they signed up, so there were
some compiaints at first,’’ he said.
‘But the students have got to learn
that being in the theater takes a great
commitment from everyone. It takes
a great deal of time and energy to do
itright.”’

“It’s no longer ‘Hammers and
Nails,’ like it used to be called,”’
Fischer said.

A unique feature of the course is
that because of the changing nature
of the work each year due to the pro-
duction of the course, drama majors

ienced people in the course, and so
we like to have people take it twice,”
Martinez said.

This year’s production, ‘Two
Lovers of Verona,” a musical com-
edy, will be performed not only at
W&L but also at Mary Baldwin Col-
lege and several other area schools.

Martinez said the short period of
time in which to ready the show af-
fects the teaching aspect of the
course. ‘It can’t be just a classroom
experience, because we do in fact
have a show that must be put on,
ready or not,”’ he said.

But Fischer is optimistic. ‘‘We
started with a pretty inexperienced
group,’ ’ she said, ‘‘but we’ve come a
long way.’

“Two Lovers of Verona,’’ a
musical comic version of ‘‘Romeo
and Juliet’ written by two Washing-
ton and Lee drama professors, will
premiere tomorrow night at 8 in the
University Theatre.

The musical is a spoof of Shake-
speare’s tragedy in which two lovers
try to get married over the objections
of their parents, according to assis-
tant drama Professor Joseph Marti-
nez, one of the play’s creators.

‘Anyone who comes expecting it to
be a serious treaty on the themes in
‘Romeo and Juliet’ will be sadly dis-
appointed,’’ Martinez said.

“It's a clever treatment,’’ he ad-
ded.

The idea for the play came from
Martinez’s training in commedia dell
arte, or improvisational acting. Mar-
tinez studied at a gestural theater
school in Wisconsin where many
world famous pantomimes taught
their craft.

Actors of commedia dell arte in the
1500s would study acting for their en-
tire lives and learn their parts from
their fathers. There were no set
lines; only the scenario was set.

Martinez wrote the scenario, or
plot and characters for the play, then
“brainstormed’’ and _ improvised
with associate drama Professor Tho-
mas J. Ziegler, who wrote the finish-
ed script.

The plays of commedia dell arte
would often have references to
famous people of the day and current
events. ‘‘Two Lovers of Verona’’ re-

plicates this style with witty —
such as ‘‘Junk Food.”’

Ziegler’s wife, Shirley, wrote the’
lyrics and music for ‘‘Junk Food,”’
which is sung by Juliet’s servant. The
servant, Alfreda, does not want Ju-
liet to marry Romeo because she has ,
spent Juliet’s dowry on — you guess-
ed it — junk food. Alfreda will be por-
trayed by Mary Baldwin College ,
freshman Suzanne Lochner.

Also, Romeo and Lady Capulet
sing a suicidal song titled ‘‘Life Is’
Nothing But a Practical Joke.’’,
Romeo gives Lady Capulet a gun and
says: “‘It’s a gun — it hasn’t been in-’
vented yet — put it to your head and,
pull the trigger.”’

Although ‘West Side Story”’ is con-
sidered the classic musical version of’
“Romeo and Juliet,’’ Martinez and,
Ziegler take that one step further by
establishing many comic subplots.

In addition to three performances '
in the University Theatre (tomorrow, :
Sunday and Monday), “Two Lovers |
of Verona” will be performed at’
Mary Baldwin (Saturday), Lylburn ’
Downing Middle School (Wednes- ,
day), E.C. Glass High School in
Lynchburg (next Thursday), Maury '
Elementary School in Fredericks- ,
burg (May 25) and Hudson Commu-
nity College in Lenoir, N.C. (May 28). ©

Tickets for the three performances
at the University Theatre are $2 for '
non-W&L students and senior citizens ,
and $3 for adults. Students are admit-
ted free of charge but are encouraged '

Margarine, not butter—but real china!

and RUSTY JOHNSON
Restaurant Critics

 

The quest for more fine food took
us this week to the Virginia House
Restaurant. Located on Main Street
between the Southern States Farm-
ers’ Co-op and Harrison’s Funeral
Home, the Virginia House specializes
in good-tasting, yet expensive, food
from the hours of 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and
5 to 8:30 p.m., and has been doing so
for the past 25 years.

One of the items we tested was the
Daily Special. That day the Special
was fried chicken with two vegeta-
bles and coffee or tea. The ‘‘special’’
price was $3.15. This might make it
seem as if the owners of the Virginia
House have the customers’ best fi-
nancial interests on their minds;
however, this belief is shown to bea
fallacy — the regular price is $3.25.

The fried chicken was good and
was presented in ample quantities.

The vegetables chosen were the bak-
ed potato and the tossed salad. The
baked potato was good, even though
the restaurant only serves marga-
rine; there is no REAL butter. The
tossed salad, however, was not so
good. The colors of the lettuce
— yellow, brown and a little light
green — might perhaps lead one to
believe that the salad was not tossed
around the kitchen of the Virginia
House; rather, one might think that
the tossing was done in the studio of
an artist with a bad sense of color
awareness or in one of the cement
mixers next door at the Southern
States’ plant.

The other item chosen was the Vir-
ginia Baked Ham. For $4.98 we were
rather disappointed with this dish. To
say the least, the sparse serving was
dry and well, well marbled. Of
course, the entree came with two
vegetables, which were well-pre-
pared and hot, although it is doubtful
that the servings could have totaled
more than three tablespoons each.

To sum up, the food was pretty ’
good, served on real china (by a wai- ,
tress that greatly resembled a geria.-
tric nurse), although it was not worth '
the price. The two of us dropped ,
$17.71 (including the 15 percent tip).
We were even further delighted to ‘
find out that the evening prices were ,
“slightly higher” than the luncheon
prices. Maybe that could explain why ‘
there is a larger crowd most even- ,
ings at the funeral home next door.

Lacrosse tale facing new chapter?

Once again, Division | options being weighed

EDITORS’ NOTE: When Washington and Lee's
1985 lacrosse season ended with the Generals’ 9-6
loss to the University of Maryland-Baltimore
County, the question of whether W&L should dis-
continue playing Division I lacrosse made its an-
nual appearance. Ring-tum Phi Sports Editor
Mike Stachura spent more than a month interview-
ing players, coaches, administrators, alumni and
observers in preparing this report assessing the
future of lacrosse at Washington and Lee.

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

The tale is a curious one:

There once was a little boy. The little boy had
a bicycle that was his pride and joy. He would
ride his bike all day long simply because that
was what he liked to do. His friends, who all
had bikes like his, would ride with him, and
some days they would have races. In these
races, the little boy would always finish near
the leaders. His friends came to expect the lit-
tle boy to be among the leaders.

Then one day when the little boy went out to
go riding with his friends he noticed something
different about some of their bikes. They had
different gears and could go a lot faster than
his old bike. Soon, he was not among the lead-
ers in the races anymore. In the races, he
would start out close to the leaders but would
always end up finishing somewhere in the mid-
dle of the pack.

He knew that on the next street over, none of
the kids had these bikes with the gears. They
all had bikes like his. Still, he would try to race
against the bikes with the gears, hoping his old
bike someday would be able to be with the lead-
ers again.

Things didn’t get any better, though, so he’

decided he had better think of something to do
to make riding his bike fun again, because it
certainly wasn’t much fun anymore.

If this seems a bit remote from the world of
lacrosse sticks and Generals, try this cast of
characters: the little boy is Washington and
Lee University, his bike is W&L’s lacrosse
team, the gears are athletic scholarships and
the next street over is Division III. The little
boy has a tough decision on his hands.

So does Washington and Lee and its lacrosse
program.

W&L, for much of the 1970s the force in
lacrosse below the Maryland state line, suffer-
ed its third straight losing season this year. It’s
the first such slump since the school decided in
1971 to play in NCAA Division I, yet operate un-
der the financial guidelines (no scholarships)
of Division III.

This unique combination in a day when
money and top-level collegiate sports pro-
grams seem necessarily to go hand in hand has
given W&L the unique opportunity to reconsi-
der its divisional status in lacrosse. With any
such reconsideration, though, the sides and the
questions are many. As the lacrosse program
was at a crossroads in the spring of 1971, so

may it be again in 1985.

The future of the W&L lacrosse program re-
cently has been a frequent topic of discussion
among players, coaches, administrators, fans
and alumni. In a recent vote, this year’s
lacrosse team is reported to have evenly split
among those who want to stay Division I and
those who want to drop to Division III.

The one thing almost all accept as a given is
that the game of Division I lacrosse has chang-
ed dramatically since the University made the
decision 14 years ago to compete in Division I.
The reason: the growing effect of the athletic
scholarship. All agree that the University
needs soon to make some kind of response.

Athletic Director William D. McHenry sum-
marized the choices for W&L. ‘‘We have three
options,” he said. ‘“‘We can stay as we are and
try to continue to compete with the best in Divi-
sion I, we can stay in Division I and soften our
schedule, or we can try to be nationally
competitive in Division III.”’

The options are few. The views of those op-
tions and their attendant problems, though, are
many.

Can W&L continue as it is, competing with
the best Division I has to offer? Most say,
“No.”

Head coach Dennis A. Daly, in his second
year at the Generals’ helm, has yet to see a
winning season. He has spent many a night and
day thinking about the problems his team has
had to face in those two years and has the look
of frustration that accompanies such thinking.

 

Lacrosse coach Dennis A. Daly watches his
Generals against the University of Maryland.

He is to-the-point in his response to The Ques-
tion:

“To answer the question, ‘Can we be compe-
titive in Division I with the way we're doing

things?,’ I would have to say, ‘No.’ I would
have to say that the way we're doing things
right now at Washington and Lee, I don’t see
any chance of us winning a [Division I] na-
tional championship. I don’t foresee us to have
a chance each year on a consistent basis to
make the tournament, and in years that we

Four face charges
of credit card fraud

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Four Washington and Lee students
were arrested Saturday afternoon on
charges of fraudulent use of a tel-
ephone credit card and a Visa card
belonging to another student, police
said.

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said the charges involved the use of
an AT&T Calling Card reported lost
by sophomore David A. Shugart ‘“‘to
run up a rather large phone bill.”
Sutton said the Visa card was used by
only one of the students.

Sutton said the arrests were made
at 10 Lee Ave., the address of all four
of the students.

eSophomore Felton E. May II, 20,
of Hummelstown, Pa., was charged
with two counts of credit card fraud
and one felony count of credit card
theft. Sutton said the charges involv-
ed both the telephone credit card and
the Visa card.

eJunior Bryan K. Johnson, 21, of
Jersey City, N.J., and sophomores
Calvin D. Rankin, 20, of Los Angeles
and Walter J. Hopkins Jr., 19, of
Kingwood, Texas, each were charged
with credit card fraud and with ac-
cessory after the fact to credit card
theft. The charges involved the use of

the telephone credit card, Sutton
said.

“It’s possible that other charges
might be brought,”’ Sutton said, but
he said he “won’t know for a while
yet”’ whether that will occur.

Sutton said more than $300 in il-
legal charges were made to the Call-
ing Card during one month, and he
said billing information for the last
two to three weeks is not yet avail-
able. ‘There could be more,” he
said.

Suttton said most of the illegal calls
were made in Lexington, but that
some were made in another state.

Sutton declined to say what infor-
mation led to the arrests. ‘‘That
would be giving away trade secrets,
and might prevent similar arrests in
the future,”’ he said.

Shugart last week reported to
police that illegal calls had been
made on his card from Feb. 10 to
April 30. He said he had lost the
wallet on Feb. 10 between Evans Din-
ing Hall and the University Library.

Shugart said he cooperated with
the police investigation but declined
to comment on whether the Execu-
tive Committee has been contacted
concerning the case.

In explaining the difference in the
charges against the four students,

Counselor at Texas A&M named associate dean

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

A student counselor at Texas A&M
University has been appointed to the
newly created associate dean of stu-
dents position at Washington and
Lee.

Anne C.P. Schroer was selected
from about 155 candidates for the
position and will begin her duties
Aug. 1.

Schroer will assume varied respon-
sibilities, including working with the
women’s programs and the transi-
tion to coeducation, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

In addition, Schroer will help As-
sociate Dean of Students Michael A.
Cappeto and Placement Consultant
Stephen P. Bredin with career coun-
seling, ‘‘a need we have identified as
requiring additional attention and
staff,’’ John said.

“She will have generalist responsi-
bilities,’’ John added. ‘‘Because she
will be the only women on the [dean
of students’} staff, it would be nat-
ural that she will be dealing with the
transition and coeducation.”’

John said that Schroer’s personal
characteristics, in addition to her ex-
perience, led to her selection.

“Her experience and background,
as well as her educational back-
ground, certainly made her an at-
tractive candidate,’’ John explained.

Retreats

“She has a background in counseling
and career planning as well as in the
general area of working closely with
students.”

Schroer, 40, said she is excited
about the new position.

“T think it’s going to be a challeng-
ing appointment, but also interesting
and fun,” she said. ‘‘I’m really look-
ing forward to working with the new
women as they come onto campus
and also with the men.”

Schroer said she first heard about
the position through an advertise-
ment in The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation.

“When I read that ad, I thought,
‘My goodness, that job describes
everything I'd like to do,’ ’’ she said.
“It was almost on a lark that I ap-
plied for it because I wasn’t sure
what my competition would be.”’

Schroer was one of six applicants
invited to campus in March for inter-
views, John said.

“IT fell in love with the place,”
Schroer said of her two-day visit. “‘I
just thought it was gorgeous.’

Schroer met with two different
groups of students and said she was
impressed with the quality of the stu-
dents.

“They both were pretty open with
me, and I could see where some of
the attitudes are different and are
probably going to feel challenged
when women come onto campus,”’
she added.

After meeting with some faculty
and staff members, Schroer said, ‘‘I
just felt like a lot of the homework
[for the transition to coeducation]
had been very well carried out.’’

Schroer said she took several
weeks before accepting the job offer
because she and her family needed to
decide whether it was worth moving
from College Station, Texas. Her hus-
band also is a psychologist at Texas
A&M, and they have two sons, ages
13 and 15.

“We are a dual-career couple try-
ing to think about how both of us can
have an active career and still do the
parenting we want to do,’’ Schroer
said. All of the family’s previous
moves have been because of her hus-
band’s work, she added, and ‘“‘the
family is feeling especially challeng-
ed, also.”’

Her husband will begin looking for
a job in the Lexington area.

“Getting established in a new com-
munity is going to take some jug-
gling,’’ Schroer said, but she believes
this will help the women students at
W&L “‘see how a professional woman
tries to blend her duties with her per-
sonal family responsibilities.”’

Schroer said she will be able to help
both male and female students pre
pare for being in similar dual-career
situations, in which both the husband
and wife work. ‘‘As we look at the
kind of student body at W&L, we see
very, very able people who are more

and more career-minded,”’ she add-
ed. ‘‘We need to pay attention to that
with workshops and seminars.”’

Helping with the coeducational
programs and perhaps forming some
women’s support groups are other
activities that Schroer would like to
do, in addition to the career develop-
ment and counseling.

“What I'll be listening for is for
what the students have a need,” she
said, adding that she’ll do ‘tas much
personal development and career
counseling as I can schedule.”’

During her conversations with
W&L students, Schroer said, she
gained the impression that many are
concerned about the fraternity sys-
tem in light of the decreased number
of men that will be at W&L.

‘‘T understand that in terms of dol-
lars and cents,”’ said Schroer, adding
that good communication with the In-
terfraternity Council will be essential
next year.

Schroer said another possible pro-
blem with coeducation could be that
the men will have to deal with in-
creased academic competition from
the women. ‘‘Hopefully, that will be
challenging and exciting and not feel-
ing like [the women] are taking
over.’

Schroer received her education at
the University of Strasbourg in
France, Defiance College in De-
fiance, Ohio, Washington State Uni-
versity and the University of Nor

OPINION ayes se
Keep Div. |

It’s springtime, and that means birds, flowers, gradua-
tions, warm weather, Goshen ... and lacrosse — not necessa-
rily in that order.

As happens every springtime, though, the last item on that
list appears to be in danger here at Washington and Lee.
Once again, the powers-that-be have studied the lacrosse sit-
uation, namely whether the W&L laxmen should continue to
play in the ultra-competitive Division I without awarding
scholarhips. For now, a compromise decision appears to
have been reached — the Generals will stay in Division I for
at least the next season but will play a ‘‘watered down’’
schedule.

That decision is only a temporary solution — a Bandaid. It
solves nothing in the long run.

Unfortunately, the lacrosse problem has no remedy analo-
gous to the move to coeducation, which not only healed the
problems but actually appears to have made the patient bet-
ter than before.

The arguments for and against continuing to play Division
I lacrosse are well-known. To us, there appear to be four pos-
sible ‘‘solutions”’ : continue to play Division I, play a watered-
down Division I schedule, drop to Division III, or resume
awarding athletic scholarships for lacrosse and remain Divi-
sion I.

The last option is the least palatable. Awarding athletic
scholarships, a practice discontinued at W&L in the 1950s
after a cheating scandal, would be a more fundamental
change than coeducation. Our University — like all univer-
sities — exists for academics, which athletic scholarships do
little if anything to improve.

Dropping to Division III is a frequently suggested remedy
for the problems plaguing W&L lacrosse. “Drop to Division
III and we’ll be national champions every year”’ is the com-
mon argument. What proponents of that course forget is that
W&L continues to attract outstanding lacrosse players each
year because of the competition — the U.Va.s, the Mary-
lands, the North Carolinas — we can guarantee them. W&L’s
lacrosse greats didn’t come here to play Hampden-Sydney,
Hobart or Roanoke. Those would be just some of the teams
we would play in Division III, the top lacrosse players would
go elsewhere and within a few years W&L might be just in the
middle of the Division III pack.

The same arguments extend to the current plan, remaining
Division I but playing a watered-down schedule. Rather than
playing the top teams mentioned above, W&L will play a cou-
ple of top Division III schools and Division I schools such as
Bucknell and Dartmouth — hardly ‘“‘name’’ lacrosse teams.
A watered-down schedule will not allow even the best W&L
team to compete seriously for the national championship —to
be the best you naturally have to play the best. W&L’s name
will quickly disappear from the ranks of the top Division I
lacrosse schools, the quality of the players will decline and
the net result will be the same as if we were to drop to Divi-
sion III. (In fact, some might argue that this step is merely a
transition to dropping to Division III. )

No, the first alternative seems to be the best. It is not a
perfect solution, but if W&L makes a recommitment to Divi-
sion I lacrosse without scholarships, it can continue to be
competitive with the top teams. The top players — probably
skeptical during the past few years about W&L’s commit-
ment to Division I lacrosse — will be reassured. Recognizing
W&L’s outstanding reputation for academics, the true stu-
dent-athletes — the kind of well-rounded individuals that any
university should seek to attract — will come to Lexington in
search of more than a lacrosse field.

It’s unfortunate, but true: W&L may never win a Division I
national collegiate lacrosse championship. That, though, is
not the purpose of the lacrosse team — or, indeed, the sports
program — at W&L. Remaining in Division I will allow play-
ers to compete against the best in the country, and W&L fans,
such as they are, will have the chance to return to Wilson
Field to watch the best lacrosse teams in the nation.

The Generals may not always win, but they do — and will
— have a chance. We ought not take that opportunity from

them. —By Bruce Potter and Mike Allen

Shattered

Every Monday morning, I look forward to taking prospec-
tive students and their parents on a tour of the campus. I like
to share the history of the ‘‘hallowed”’ halls with them, share
how the Doremus gymnasium came about, how Lee himself
first planned for a school of journalism, and explain the ad-
vantages students gain from the Honor System.

But last Monday was different. I had explained to a pro-
spective transfer student and his father how the Honor Sys-
tem helps to develop the ‘‘gentleman’’ virtures the system
espouses. They wanted to see a dormitory. As I opened the
door to Graham-Lees, my eyes caught sight of three smashed
bottles immediately in front of me and the two visitors.
Someone had enjoyed dropping bottles from the fourth floor
through the stairwell.

Nice move, guys.

How was I to answer the father’s statement that he thought
the Honor System, the idea of the gentleman and the concept
of respect, helped to stop such childish behavior? Somehow,
the son’s attempt at response — ‘‘But this is college, Dad”
—seemed woefully inadequate.

rapher for the past 10 years and worked
closely with the late Romulus T.

If your first impressions of
Washington and Lee were, like mine,
formed by some of the University’s
various printed literature, chances
are that the late Rom Weatherman
had a hand in producing whatever

first saw. For more than 17 years,
Rom put W&L’s best face forward as
Director of Publications.

He worked behind the scenes, as
much by necessity as choice for there
was always another deadline coming
too soon. Rom took the time to do
things right, so there was never
enough time, because he was an
incurable perfectionist. No matter.
what the subject, Rom wanted to de-
sign and produce exactly what the oc-
casionealled for — nothing more, but
never anything less, either — from
clean and simple to filigreed and
rococo. ;

That one person could capably
span such a gamut of styles is amaz-
ing enough in itself, but Rom could —
and often did — crank whole projects

Thoughts

MY
VIEW

By Jon
Zagrodzky

 

 

When the bell rang for the first
class back in September 1981, I
remember being rather apprehen-
sive about W&L, and I wondered at
that time whether my initial uneasi-
ness would stay with me until grad-
uation. Well, it didn’t, and despite a
somewhat trying freshman year, I
have come to enjoy the University
and its surroundings. So, for my last
column, I should like to salute some
of the people who have made the ex-
perience here truly fascinating.

No organization at W&L provided
me with more entertainment than the
folks at Buildings and Grounds. As
anyone who lives in Woods Creek
Apartments will attest, B&G is a
strange organization. I can’t count
the times I’ve seen some guy with a
small pail in front of the apartments
collecting tiny bits of trash while
mountains of garbage in back of the
apartments go unnoticed for months.
We're just lucky that no one ever
walks on the trail behind the apart-
ments, or it could be really embar-
rassing. This pales in comparison,
however, with the lovely and func-
tional footbridge located behind the
library. Designed in cooperation with
the Waddell Elementary School
Corps of Engineers, this wonder is

Alleviating racism means communication

To the Editors:

The racial situation on campus has
received a good deal of attention late-
ly. The black students have request-
ed that a representative be appointed
to the Student Control Committee or
the Executive Committee to advise
on cases concerning minority stu-
dents. Many students are against
such a representative and, further-
more, see an organization designed
to cultivate black unity as separatist
and as something which discourages
a mix between the races. At any rate
there is a racial problem on campus.

When I say “racial problem,”’ I do
not mean that white students dislike
black students simply because they
are black, but many of the white stu-

dents have simply not been exposed
to blacks in their most formative
years. Due to this, confrontations be-
tween black and whites are often
awkward, and this prevents commu-
nication from being made. It seems
to be for this reason that the minority
students experience discrimination. I
stress that this discrimination may
not be intended, but it is created.
There is no reason for discrimina-
tion to exist. As students at an institu-
tion of higher learning, and as human
beings, I feel that there is a moral re-
sponsibility on the part of each one of
us to alleviate racial friction. This
can be done to a certain extent by
coming to grips with the fact that life
is being made difficult for quite a few

pes ouns, due to no fault of their own.
If one can accept the possibility that
he may feel uneasy around a person
of a different race, he may become
able to prevent such awkwardness in
the future. Perhaps good ways to
begin to alleviate this problem,
which may not be aS great as one
may think, is to simply say ‘‘Hello”’
or study together. Communication’
however, must be opened.

There is no reason for discrimina-
tion, there are only reasons why it ex-
ists. It is well within our abilities to
diminish the unjust and unfortunate
problem we have.

out virtually overnight. He didn’t
work that way by choice, but his
years as a newspaper reporter and
columnist prepared him well for a
rigorous production schedule.

Being human as he was, Rom was
certainly easier to work with at some
times than at others, but no matter
how thick and fast things were flying,
I never got the feeling that he had
anything less than total respect for
my work. He never decreed that I
had to do things his way or else.

In making an assignment, Rom
would scribble out a schematic in his
unique visual Sanskrit and, with gest-
iculations, make his vision for the
finished piece perfectly clear. It
would also make total sense.

On occasion, I’d bring him more
than just what he’d asked for, and
sometimes Rom would like my idea
better, so he would change his plans
accordingly. This was initially very
satisfying to my ego, but over the
years, I came to view this more as a
sign of a good leader: to be open to
change when someome else comes in
with a better way to do things. I
never got the feeling that I was work-
ing for Rom — I was working with
him.

From time to time, Rom was
known to belt out old jazz standards
in his office, usually when he was on
a roll during a period of intense work.
He could have given Tony Bennett

over four

rendered impassable for days by
even the mildest of showers. Equally
amusing was a claim last year that
our air conditioner couldn’t cool the
apartment very well due to building
design. I even received a bill for $125
in January for a B&G vacuum clean-
er that I had never borrowed. For
these and other classic perfor-
mances, I salute Buildings and
Grounds.

Of all the students I have known
over the last four years, none is as in-
teresting or hilarious as my good
friend Warren Taylor. For quite
some time I have watched the
world’s foremost Anglophile miss
classes, put off an entire term’s work
until the last minute and swoon at the
slightest mention of British royalty.
Once, during the three weeks before
we went on the Glee Club tour to Eng-
land last year, I noticed rows of num-
bers on a piece of paper posted next
to Warren’s calendar. When I asked
him about them, he said, “I’m coun-
ting the hours before we go to
England.”

Despite scant dedication to acade-
mic endeavors, Warren is as capable
as the best students on campus. His
limitless knowledge of good music,
good food, the Church and all things
cultural never ceases to amaze me.
He also throws the best cocktail par-
ties, and he is more fun to waste
valuable study time with than anyone
I know. Three cheers for Warren.

Next, I should like to salute the one
member of the faculty who has im-
pressed me the most over the years.
When I declared my major, I decided
on economics and romance lan-
guages. At that time, I feared that
my boundless ineptitude in Spanish
literature would destroy me in later
years, but that was before I took
Spanish 208 with Dr. Westbook Bar-
ritt. Dr. Barritt showed a bumbling
idiot that literature was not an un-
masterable subject. He was and is
extremely patient in class and al-
ways went to great lengths to help me
understand the material. Outside of
class, he is a fascinating person. He
is an avid gun enthusiast and an ex-
pert marksman, and he always
jumps at the chance to learn new
things. Once, I was chatting with him
about economics and financial mar-
kets and their impact on U.S. policy.
At that time, he seemed to know very
little about the subject, but he en-
joyed hearing about it. During the
next few months, he apparently paid

 

 

 

some competition if he’d set his mind
toit.

Working for W&L was what
brought us together most often, but
my deepest respect and affection for
Rom stemmed from his willingness
to approach my personal work with
complete candor and openness. With
his wry sense of humor and uncanny
expertise at picture-editing, Rom
knew that beauty doesn’t have to be
pretty, that symmetry is not essen-
tial for balance, and that the fashion-
able can be totally lacking of any true
style. And he would say so, if that’s
what he thought.

Rom could always find the time to
look over my latest batch of attempts

years

close attention to the news and did
some reading on the subject. When I
stopped by again, he was informed
not only about the economic matters
we had discussed earlier, but about a
few other new things as well. Dr.
Barritt is a great conversationalist, a
delightful person and a good friend.

Finally, I must salute the entire U-
niversity. Despite a few problems,
it’s a fine school worthy of the highest
consideration. I wish Washington and
Lee, as well as the Class of 1985, good
luck in the years to come. So long,
and vayan con Dios.

from his heart in reacting to what he
was seeing for the first time. He did
this with the joy of a child, as natural-

Waitress

To the Editors:

This is to protest a parenthetical
comment in the article of Paul Davey
and Rusty Johnson in the issue of
May 16. It read: ‘‘To sum up, the food
was pretty good, served on real china
(by a waitress that greatly resembl-
eda geriatric nurse)....”’

While the phrase ‘‘geriatric nurse”’
is not clear, I take it to be a deroga-
tory comment about an individual
waitress. I wonder if she read the
article. I wonder how it made her
feel. I wonder what it added to the
story.

As for me, it was gratuitous, cruel
and insensitive, about what one
might expect from a callous knave
but never from a gentleman.

It would appear that Washington
and Lee has, in the case of Mr. Davey
and Mr. Johnson, largely failed in its
mission to cultivate respect for indi-
vidual persons.

To the Editors:

The latest issue of the Washington
and Lee Political Review starts off
with a quote from Lenin. Basically, it
says that the first step in defeating a
nation is to destroy the will of its
youth to fight through ‘‘liberal mind-
ed ministers, professors and lectur-
ers,’’ creating a sense of ‘war hor-
ror.’’ If I may second-guess the Re-
view’s editors, they are attacking
those of us in the United States who
question taking active measures to
resist the spread of Soviet influence
in the world. Lenin and the Review’s
editors are right. To survive, the U.S.
must be willing to fight.

Any nation’s will to fight, especial-
ly a democracy’s, is the sum total of
its individual citizens’ wills to fight.
If they are unwilling to fight, or if ina
democracy just a large enough pro-
portion are unwilling to fight, the na-
tion cannot win a war, and just as
each individual has a role in society,
he (or she) has a role in the collective
will to fight. The quote points out,
therefore, that making individuals
unwilling to assume their roles in the
collective will to fight destroys a na-
tion’s ability to fight. Lenin said that
creating ‘‘war horror’ was the most
successful way to do this. But it is not
the only way

us with his insights into the world of
sports. We respect his opinions, but
this time he has gone too far. Sta-
chura supports the lottery system
and states: ‘‘Picking numbers out of
a hat is a lot more constructive than
cheating to lose.”’

We agree that cheating to lose is
wrong. However, the present system
has made the situation worse. Where-
as it used to be two or three teams
“competing” for the first pick, now
there are nine or ten.

Scott Tilley raised an interesting
subject last week when he wrote
about heroes. Naturally we all should
have someone to look up to and to ad-
mire, Next year, with the advent of
coeducation, it will be curious to see
how the women deal with the venera-
tion of Robert E. Lee. I do not believe
that they should take offense. Instead
they have only to look at his wife,
Mary Custis Lee, to find a heroine. A

As young men, we share the most
important role in the collective will to
fight. We are the fighters. Our unhap-
py task is to be ready, and if neces-
sary to do the actual fighting, killing
and dying. Nuclear weapons do not
change this. They reinforce what has
always been true. Nuclear weapons
only make all individuals subject to
dying, no matter what their role in
the collective will. This has made the
U.S.’s wars since the end of World
War II “‘limited wars.’ To keep
everyone from dying, the superpo-
wers avoid directly fighting each
other. But our role has not changed.

In the past, to fulfill our role we on-
ly had to join the military if there was
an actual war. In timeseof peace a
small standing military, relative to
the size of our population, was ade-
quate. The price of peace has now be-
come constant readiness for war. To
do this we have built a large, expen-
sive professional military. For the
first time in U.S. history pay scales
and living conditions are comparable
to non-military professions in order
to attract the best people possible.
This is necessary in having a good
military, and in no way lessens the
commitment of military personnel to
their duties. This is how the U.S. has
decided to provide itself with a mili-

tary. It competes with the civilian
sector for personnel. It does not
obligate us to fulfill our role in the
collective will to fight.

To the best of my knowledge, 31
members of my class will fulfill this
role. After graduation 29 of us will be
in the active Army or Reserves, and
one in the Marine Corps. I am not
condemning anyone who chooses not
to join nor am I condemning critics of
our military. Criticism is necessary
in a democracy and good for the mili-
tary. Through our political system
we have decided on an all-volunteer
military. We are fortunate to live ina
nation where an individual may
choose not to join. I do not want to
make ‘Some corner of a foreign field
that is forever’ America, but I have
joined the military because I believe
it is necessary to enable our system
to survive. But those who do not join,
and thereby do not fulfill their role in
the national will to fight, are hypo-
critical if they advoacate any policy
that will put the lives of American
military personnel or the lives of our
allies’ military personnel in danger.
Do not ask anyone to put himself ina
position to die defending America un-
less you are willing to join him.

A case in point is the Seattle Super-
Sonics. With 15 games to go in the
season, the Sonics were in a playoff
position. However, they mysteriously
lost 12 of their last 14 games. Could
this be because they preferred a
chance to play ‘“‘NBA Lotto’ instead
of a certain first-round playoff loss to
the Los Angeles Lakers? Seattle
claims not. However, consider that
during the Sonics’ year-end skid, per-
ennial All-Star Jack Sikma sat on the
bench for 13 games with a minor in-
jury to his little finger. It is unheard
of in professional sports to play with-
out a star player with a minor injury
during a bid for the championship.

It seems ridiculous that a playoff

wonderful book to read is Mrs.
Robert E. Lee by Rose MacDonald.
It is from this book that the facts of
Mrs. Lee’s life presented here came.

Mary Custis was born on Oct. 1,
1808. Her father, George Washington
Parke Custis, was the grandson of
Martha Washington and George
Washington’s adopted son. Her moth-
er was a cousin of Robert E. Lee.

Her family’s history is rich indeed.
Not’ only did it include her relation-
ship to George Washington, but her
great-great-grandfather, Daniel
Paine, was an aide-de-camp to the
Duke of Marlborough during the bat-
tle of Blenheim.

In 1824, Lafayette paid a visit to her
family and it was then that she fell in
love with Robert E. Lee, who was a
marshal in a parade given in Lafay-
ette’s honor.

caliber team, the Sonics, will pick

Thus, the NBA Lotto system has

s honor Mrs. Lee?

The couple was married on June
30, 1831, and over the years had seven
children.

The years of the Civil War were
hard for Mrs. Lee. Her home at Ar-
lington was ransacked and many val-
uable furnishings were taken. These
included many objects that had been
at Mount Vernon. In addition, her be-
loved husband was indicted by a
grand jury for treason,

Mary Custis Lee never faltered in
her devotion to her husband nor in
her belief that one day the South
would rise again.

She followed her husband to Lex-
ington, where he assumed the presi-
dency of Washington College. Both
husband and wife were inundated
with letters from admirers, and Mrs.
Lee tried to help all those who asked
for aid.

A family who had befriended Gen.
Lee during the seige of Petersburg
fell on hard times. When Mrs. Lee
heard of this she sent them $5. This
money was part of a sum given to her
“for the cause.” The last of the
money was sent to the same family in
order that their two little girls might
have Christmas presents.

She also devoted much of her time
to raising money for the new Episco-
pal church.

That was not all that she did, how-
ever. In a college town it is hard not
to come into contact with students
and Mrs. Lee loved for the students to
visit her. She organized a sewing cir-
cle to make “‘housewives,”’ or sewing
kits, for the cadets at VMI. For the
students at Washington College she
was a mother figure, someone to talk
to. She befriended many students and
encouraged an exceptionally home-
sick boy or one who was far from
home to bring her any mending that
had to be done.

The Board of Trustees of Washing-
ton College wished to provide for
Mrs. Lee’s future should anything
happen to her husband. Both Gen.
and Mrs. Lee declined any help in the
belief that the money could be ap-
plied to educational purposes. The
trustees did not alter their decision,
though.

It was known around campus that
Gen. Lee wheeled his invalid wife
around the porch of their home. Often
a group of students would purposely
walk by the house at this time. It
gave them a time to observe the natu-
ral affection the couple felt toward
each other. On Nov. 5, 1873, Mary
Custis Lee died and was mourned by
the many people whose lives she had
touched. She was born a lady and re-
mained one all her life.

I believe that Mary Custis Lee is
someone who should be remembered
and whose example should be follow-
ed. I am not referring to her sewing
circles or her mending the students’
clothes. What should be emphasized
is her sense of duty, her generosity
and her hospitality. She gave so free-
ly of herself that it is only right that
we remember this woman who stood
by Gen. Lee for most of his life.

Mary Custis Lee was loyal to her
country, by which she meant the
South. However, she was even more
loyal to her way of life. And she wish-
ed to retain as much of it as possible.
Let us hope that next year there are a
few women who desire to follow the
example of Mary Custis Lee.

Students intern under wing
of Eagles Nest, prosecutor

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

An internship, according to Col.
Harold S. Head, University registrar,
is ‘‘on-the-job training for which a
student receives credit’’ (salary is an
employer option).

At W&L, numerous departments
offer internships for upperclassmen,
including the art, journalism, politics
and sociology departments, and vir-
tually all departments offer ‘‘Direct-
ed Individual Study’’ courses. These
courses provide hands-on experience
for the student either in Lexington or
elsewhere that usually is not avail-
able to an individual until he attains
graduate status.

Two internships available to all
students are those under the heading
of Sociology 453. Specifically, they
are positions with either the com-
monwealth’s attorney in Lexington
or with the Eagles Nest Clubhouse in
Buena Vista, an out-patient center
under the direction of the Rockbridge
Mental Health Clinic. Other pro-
grams in mental illness and retarda-
tion are available. Neither internship
requires one to be seeking a law? psy-
chology or sociology degree, and
each involves hands-on experience in
the respective fields designed to
benefit the student regardless of ma-
jor. Each of these internships pro-

vide three sociology credits (no
salary).

Three students are currently in-
volved in these particular intern-
ships. Barry Funkhouser, a junior
psychology major from Lexington, is
with the Eagles Next Clubhouse.
Eagles Nest, according to Marsha
Bedwell, program director, “is a
psycho-social rehabilitation program
for persons with chronic mental ill-
ness under the direction of the Rock-
bridge Mental Health Clinic.”’

Expectations of interns are based
on individual contracts that establish
hours per week and the plan for the
semester. Funkhouser currently is
helping publish a monthly newsletter
and is assisting in the instruction of
an awareness class for diagnosed
schizophrenics. ‘‘They have a right to
know about their illness and how it
can be treated, and this fulfills that
right,’’ Funkhouser said.

A previous intern, Peter Wilbanks,
a senior pre-med major from Sea-
ford, Del., worked developing a
group discussion for counseling men
in their efforts to reacquaint them-
selves with society. Wilbanks still

assists the programasavolunteer. _

The Eagles Nest Staff is very
pleased with the W&L interns and
has high hopes for the future of the
program. The interns themselves,
though apprehensive at first with
normal misconceptions about mental

illness, say they found it highly re-
warding and recommend it strongly
to any interested student, regardless
of major.

Interns for Commonwealth’s Attor- -
ney Beverly C. “John’’ Read work —
closely with the victim-witness coor- _
dinator, the assistant common-
wealth’s attorney and with Read. -
Similar to the Eagles Nest intern- -
ship, individual assignments are tail- «
ored to the individual and to the spec-
ific need at the time. Regardless of ~
specific assignments, the intern will
gain experience in preparing for
trials; going to trial and counseling
victims and witnesses, especially
those who are unfamiliar with the
courtroom environment, procedures
and terminology.

The intern also acquires an under-
standing of The Virginia court sys-
tems, the judicial process, and its in-
teraction with society as a peace-
keeping force. As one law student de-
scribed it, ‘‘it is an experience that
few of us will have until we become
lawyers.”

According to Novack, “It is an
experience that adds to your W&L ed-
ucation as well as familiarizes you
with a system that many people do
not clearly understand.”’

rently participating in the common-
wealth’s attorney internship program.

Sutton would say only that ‘‘the
evidence would vary between some
of them.”

Fraudulent use of a credit card in
an amount of as much as $200 during
a six-month period is a misdemeanor
punishable by up toa year in jail and
a fine of $1,000.

Credit card theft is grand larceny
punishable by a maximum of ten
years in prison. Accessory after the
fact is a misdemeanor punishable by
as muchas a year in jail and a $1,000
fine.

“Credit card fraud of different

 

types is fairly widespread,’’ Sutton
said. ‘“‘We haven’t had too much of it
here, but we have had some previous
cases.”’

Sutton said Shugart cancelled the
credit cards shortly after they were
lost, but did not contact police until
he learned that the cards had been
used without his consent

‘He reported them to the company
and figured that was the end of it, but
then the companies notified him
when the bills came in,’’ Sutton said
“That’s when we got in on it and he
decided he should call us.”’

Sutton said the companies involved
are civilly liable for the charges
because Shugart reported the cards
missing. “I think the credit card
companies are the ones that had the

actual loss,”’ he said.

Sophomore John Atkins’ 1984 Audi
4000S was vandalized sometime Fri-

Lewis predicts Honor System will survive

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Honor System should survive
the transition to coeducation, Execu-
tive Committee President-elect John
Lewis told a symposium Monday
night.

Responding to a question about a
faculty member who had said the
Honor System would be placed under
a severe strain next year, Lewis said,
““We have been told by this professor
that the end of the Honor System is
near. I intend to prove him wrong.”

Lewis was a member of a four-per-
son panel talking about the past, pre-
sent and future of the Honor System
during a symposium sponsored by
Omicron Delta Kappa, the honorary
leadership fraternity.

Other topics covered during the
wide-ranging 90-minute discussion
included whether such ‘‘pranks’’ as
stealing a road sign should be~con-
sidered honor violations, whether
drunkenness should be taken into ac-
count when determining if an honor
violation has occurred and how the
student body perceives the Honor
System.

When the EC is faced with an honor
case involving a female student,
Lewis said its members ‘‘will be hon-

EC rookies
prepare for

fall challenge

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

 

With the arrival of the first women
this fall, most agree that next year’s
Executive Committee has a big job
ahead of it. However, two of the new-
est EC members say they ‘‘are ready
for the challenge.”

Brad Root and Pat Schaefer were
elected in March to be sophomore EC
representatives next year, and al-
though neither has had any previous
EC experience, both are old hands at
student government.

Root is from Erie, Pa., and he at-
tended Salsbury Prep in New Eng-
land, where he was president of the
student body and played varsity soc-
cer, hockey and lacrosse.

Schaefer is from Memphis, Tenn.,
where he atteneded Memphis Uni-
versity School. He was secretary and
president of the Honor Council, re-
ceived the Senior Leadership award
and played varsity football.

The third new EC member, junior
representative-elect Baltzer LeJeune
of River Ridge, La., is overseas this
semester.

Root said he ran for the EC be-
cause “I’ve always been interested in
this kind of student leadership and
student government and I saw the op-
portunity to get involved in the EC.”

Schaefer said, ‘‘I felt that I could
represent the school as well as the
sophomore class. I wanted to have a
say in what went on at W&L.”’

6 students take
writing honors

Six students received honors for
excellence in writing and scholarship
at the English department’s annual
awards ceremony yesterday.

Four students won George A. Ma-
han Awards in Creative Writing. Ro-
bert D. Bryant and Mark J. Pem-
broke won in the senior prose cate-
gory. Bryant, from Albuquerque,
N.M., was honored for a story titled
“Portrait of the Writer as a Young
Cad,” and Pembroke, from Milwau-
kee, was recognized for his story
“The Parrot.”

Winners in the juniors prose cate-
gory were James A. McLaughlin of
Rockbridge Baths, for ‘‘Native’’ and
John F. Pankow of Asheville, N.C.,
for ‘‘Nothing Ever Happens.”

Frank B. McQuillen, a junior from
Sea Isle City, N.J., received the Jean
Amory Wornom Award for Distin-
guished Critical writing for his paper
“Speaking, Hearing, and Under-
standing in ‘Hamlet.’ ”’

McQuillen was also the recipient of
the Catherine Houston Campbell
Scholarship in English Literature.
Hugh R. Black, a junior from Spar-

orable men, and I think these honor-
able men will be able to distinguish
between honor and dishonor and I
hope gender won’t come into it.”’

The EC will find it difficult not to
overcompensate for the women,
though, warned current Secretary
Sam Dalton, one of about 30 people in
the audience.

“It’s good that you're that idealis-
tic at this point, and I hope you're this
idealistic at this point next year,”
Dalton told Lewis.

Lewis responded that although the
first few decisions involving women
may be difficult, he believes the EC
won’t overcompensate for the wom-
en.

“After about three or four hours of
deliberations, the face begins to turn
gray, the way all the faces do during
deliberations,” he said.

Where to draw the line on honor of-
fenses and whether such acts as
stealing a road sign could be consi-
dered honor violations produced the
most discussion of the evening.

“Those are very, very different
things to cross over,’’ Lewis said.
“There is a very, very fine line
there.”

Current EC President Cole Dawson
said that cases such as those have
been reported to the EC. ‘‘Each case

is decided on its individual merits. If
the end result was going to be theft,
then that could be considered an hon-
or violation,”’ he said.

Lewis said he would view such of-
fenses in a different light because so
many apparently occur but aren’t re-
ported to the EC. “Therefore, they
must not be viewed [as honor viola-
tion] by our generation,” he said.

Pranks should not automatically
be dismissed as not being honor vio-
lations, said Bennett Ross, EC presi-
dent in 1982-83. Once they are report-
ed to the EC, he added, they should
be treated no differently from any
other possible honor violation.

“Tf it’s a question of theft, regard-
less of the object, and if you can
establish intent, then I think the EC
ought to deal with it,’’ Ross added.

Sophomore EC representative and
Vice President-elect Andrew Caru-
thers said from the audience that a
problem could result if each EC
views each act individually.

“The student generation needs to
know what is going to be deemed by
the Executive Committee as dishon-
orable,”’ Caruthers added.

Previous decisions often don’t play
much of a role in future EC decisions,
though, Ross explained.

“There’s a saying that ECs aren’t

 

 

BRAD ROOT

Both said they could offer some-
thing to next year’s EC.

“We had a successful honor system
at MUS,” Schaefer said. “‘It could be
valuable to the investigating aspect
of [the one at W&L].”

Each EC member has an obliga-
tion, Root said, ‘‘to take initiative to
bring up student opinions and
thoughts.”

Schaefer emphasized the impor-
tance of fairness with the women
next year. ‘‘We have to look at mat-
ters involving men and women in the
same light,’’ he said. “‘We must judge
each situation separately without sex
playing a factor in our discussions.”’

Both said they agree with Presi-
dent-elect John Lewis (their dorm
counselor, coincidentally) that the
gap between the undergraduates and
the law students needs to be closed.

tanburg, S.C., was awarded the other
departmental scholarship, the Eliza-
beth B. Garrett Scholarship in Eng-
lish.

ODK citation
goes to Mandak

The Washington and Lee chapter of
the national leadership fraternity
Omicron Delta Kappa has given its
Rupert N. Latture Outstanding Soph-
omore Award to Jeffrey Scott Man-
dak, a pre-med student with a grade
point average of 4.1.

Established in 1981, the award is
given to the sophomore who best ex-
emplifies the ideals of Omicron Delta
Kappa, which was established on the
W&L campus in 1914 to recognize
leadership in campus activities —
scholastic, athletic, social, religious
and literary.

The Latture Award is named for
the sole surviving founder of ODK.
Latture, a 1915 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee, was professor of politi-
cal science at the University from
1920 to 1962.

Mandak is a Robert E. Lee Re-
search Scholar in chemistry. He was
named earlier this year as the winner
of the Phi Beta Kappa Sophomore
Award for outstanding scholarship.

PAT SCHAEFER

In addition, both hope to stress the
importance of the Honor System next
year.

“{Students’] allegiance to the
Honor System in the years following
their freshman year will depend on
how well we stress the importance of
it at their orientation,’ Schaefer
said.

Looking at this year’s EC, both new
members say they have ‘‘a good role
model to follow.’’ However, each sees
room for improvement.

‘“‘Each member should have more
respect for other members’ view-
points next year,’’ Root said.

Schaefer also stressed that point.

“Hopefully, that will result in a
more complete committee,” he said.
“Each opinion can be presented,
viewed, and the problem can be seen
from all angles before it is voted on.”’

Junior Michael Black has been
named recipient of the G. Holbrook
Barber Scholarship for the 1985-86
academic year.

The scholarship goes to the rising
senior, who, according to the Univer-

scholarship, and personal charac-
ter.”

Black is a representative to the

guided by precedent and that’s abso-
lutely true,’ he said. ‘What each
committee has to do is to look at the
current student generation, look at
the facts and decide if an honor viola-
tion has occurred.”

On the other hand, Dawson said,
problems can result if the Honor Sys-
tem is based too much on the current
student generation.

‘*You don’t try to structure the sys-
tem as to what is going on — ‘Oh,
stealing signs is in this year. That’s
not an honor violation,’ ’’ he said.

ODK Vice President David Size-

more, another member of tne au-
dience, said, ‘Stealing a sign was
theft in the 60s, it was theft in the 70s,

* and I think it’s theft now.”’

Drunkenness should not be consi-
dered an excuse for an honor viola-
tion or a conduct violation, the panel-
ists generally agreed.

“We won’t accept drunkenness as
an excuse,” said panelist Townes
Pressler, chairman of the Student
Control Committee next year. ‘“‘We
don’t give them any leniency because
they’re drunk.”

Lewis agreed regarding a possible

EC changes White
to ‘gender-neutral’

 

From Staff Reports

 

In a shift from an earlier decision,
the Executive Committee has agreed
to revise the White Book to make the
language on Honor System proce-
dures ‘‘gender neutral.”’

The EC last week had voted to
place a statement in the White Book
noting that ‘‘pronouns such as ‘he,’
‘him’ [and] ‘himself’ are to be under-
stood in their traditional generic
sense as applying to all students,
male or female.”’

On Monday, the committee voted
unanimously to make White Book
pronoun references neutral through
the use of such constructions as ‘‘the
student” and “‘he or she.”’

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, chair of the Co-
education Steering Committee, told
the EC that she objected to the ear-
lier decision to use pronouns ‘‘that
are exclusive rather than inclusive.”

“It was my firm personal convic-
tion that that was not a very good
way to proceed, so I talked with some
people who’d had more experience
with language and publications than
I did,”’ she said.

Simpson submitted letters from
Sidney M.B. Coulling, chairman of
the English department, and Jeffery
G. Hanna, director of the University
News Office, urging the EC to drop
the exclusively male references.

“Our firm belief is that it is possi-
ble to accomplish” gender neutrali-

and placement, headlines, photo-
graphs and overall page design) and
second place for editorial page.

Reporter Ted LeClercq and car-
toonist Chris Bowring won second-
place awards. LeClercq’s award was
for a feature story about professors’
thoughts about exams, and Bow-
ring’s was for a cartoon depicting a
student studying for exams.

Chief Editor Bruce Potter won
third place for an editorial about the
Olden Polynice honor trial at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Honorable mentions were won by
Christopher Deighan for general
news reporting, Andy Hoppes for ser-
ies of stories, Mike Stachura for
sports feature story and Stachura
and Steve Greenebaum for sports
news story.

The overall competition was won
by The Breeze of James Madison U-
niversity. Virginia Commonwealth
University’s Commonwealth Times
was second, and William and Mary’s
The Flat Hat was third. In all, 12
Virginia newspapers entered the
competition.

‘Although we had hoped to finish a
couple of places higher in the overall
competition, our awards in a variety
of categories indicate that we can
compete with the top Virginia college
newspapers,” Potter said.

ty, Simpson said. ‘The limitations
are more in terms of the writer than
with the language itself.”

The Steering Committee said in a
statement presented by Simpson that
“to use the terms ‘he, his, and him’
when referring to all students would
convey a subtle message to our wo-
men students that they are not in-
cluded.”

“It is our belief that a disclamatory
footnote would not suffice to over-
come this perception,” the statement
said.

Hanna said in his letter that his
“concern about the language that is
used in the White Book is based on
our desire in the Office of Publica-
tions to develop and maintain consis-
tency in all of the University’s publi-
cations.”

‘Just as we attempted to be consis-
tent in the publications we prepared
for an all-male undergraduate
school, so are we attempting to be
consistent in setting forth our image
as a coeducational institution,’’ he
said.

Coulling said in his letter that he
had counted 67 uses of ‘‘he,”’ ‘‘his”’ or
‘“thim’’ in the White Book, and urged
the committee to change the wording
“if for no other reason than to demon-
strate sensitivity to the issue and the
desire to use language as accurately
as possible.”’

He said he was making the recom-
mendation because he thinks ‘‘it’s
important for us to do everything we
can to make coeducation at Washing-

honor violation. ‘‘I would never allow
{alcohol} to be an excuse,”’ he said.
“If we can establish that he intended
to steal, then he’s using alcohol as a
crutch.”

The EC needs to continue to work
to improve the students’ understand-
ing of the Honor System, Dawson
said.

“The Honor System needs to be
made as personal to the students as

' possible,” he added. ‘You need to

show them the benefits of the system.

ton and Lee succeed” and because he
believes ‘‘that we should try to con-
form to what are increasingly be-
coming national norms in the use of
pronouns.”’

Junior representative Pat Hayden,
who chaired the recent White Book
Revisions Committee, said he earlier
had misunderstood objections to the
use of gender-specific pronouns.

“I was under the impression that
the use of these pronouns was being
argued because it was offensive to
the female reader,” he said, adding
that on that basis he opposed chang-
ing the White Book because he
“didn’t see how they were offen-
sive.”

He said he changed his mind,
though, after talking with Associate
English Professor Jean C. Dunbar.
“‘She used words like ‘inexact,’ ‘inap-
propriate,’ ‘archaic’ and ‘out of
style,’ which are much more convinc-
ing arguments to me,”’ Hayden said

At the 3-hour, 15-minute meeting,
the EC also gave final passage to 16
White Book revisions that were in-
itially approved last week.

In addition, the committee approv-
ed a ‘‘two-tiered”’ transcript policy.
The ‘‘good-standing clause” is de-
leted from the transcript of a student
who either withdraws from school
after being accused of an honor viola-
tion or is convicted of an honor of-
fense. The words ‘‘student not in good
standing’’ would be added if the stu-
dent is also convicted at an open
trial.

Tomaso: ‘baby dean’

Senior Executive Committee
representative and head dormitory
counselor Bob Tomaso has been
named to succeed Bennett Ross in his
position as admissions counselor.

Ross, who graduated from Wash-
ington and Lee in 1983 and was EC
president when he was a senior, has
served for two years in the post
known casually as the ‘‘baby dean”
position. He plans to enter Vanderbilt
Law School this fall.

Tomaso, an economics major from
Milford, Mass., was selected from
among eight or nine applicants, of
whom two were from outside the stu-
dent body, Associate Admissions Di-

rector Van H. Pate said.

Pate said the position Tomaso will
fill is typically held by one person for
one or two years. The job can be re-
newed after the first year.

Tomaso plans a career in manage-
ment or finance and is considering
attending law school in the future.

The Admissions Office has also
named the top officers of next year’s
Student Recruitment Committee.

The chairman is Sandy Whann, a
junior from New Orleans. Vice chair-
men are juniors Chris Alevizatos of
Sparks, Md., and Michael Black of
Shreveport, La.

Terrorists
have goals,
Moss says

By CHRISTOPER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

 

A “collector” of Soviet intelligence
defectors told a Lee Chapel audience
Tuesday that most people in the
United States have a tendency to as-
sociate political terrorism with the
“right-wing nut.”’

But Robert Moss, a recognized au-
thority on espionage and terrorism,
said terrorists have a ‘‘specific aim”
and use their “rational and calcu-
lated tool’’ to achieve their goals.

Moss was a senior foreign policy
writer for the British magazine The
Economist, for which he covered
wars and revolutions in Indochina,
Africa, the Middle East, Latin Amer-
ica and Portugal. He is also author of
‘Death Beam,”’ the best selling ‘“‘The
Spike” and ‘“‘Moscow Rules.”’

In 1981, he told a Senate committee
that a group of Bulgarians, backed
up by Soviets, had a hand in the as-
sassination attempt on Pope John
Paul II bya Turkish hit man.

“The Soviets have a major hand in
international terrorism,”’ Moss said.

Unfortunately, he added, the
media keep the average informed
American ignorant of this fact. He
warned that the Soviets might begin
to ‘rely on our confusion and the lack
of media coverage.”

As an example, Moss pointed out
that both The New York Times and
The Washington Post waited nine
months before reporting his allega-
tions concerning Soviet involvement
in the attack on the Pope.

During that nine-month period,
Moss said, the issue was covered in
most other Western countries. It took
that length of time, plus nine months,
such international coverage and an
NBC News special before the Ameri-
can media would react, he said.

According to Moss, Western spy

speaker Robert Moss adresses a Lee Chapel audience Tuesday night.

services and the media always have
been major Soviet targets of the KGB
and GRU, the first- and second-
largest secret service organizations
in the world.

“The spy business isn’t a silly
game played by people with pervert-
ed intentions...[or] merely a matter
of stealing secrets,”’ Moss said. ‘‘It’s
a matter of shaping the mind.”

But secrets are stolen, too.

Moss mentioned the case of a “‘dis-
illusioned CIA agent” who sold the
Soviets a “billion dollar spy-in-the-
sky satellite for a lousy 3,000 bucks.”’

He said it is much easier for the So-
viets to find sympathizers than it is to
find an American sympathizer
among Soviets. Soviet intelligence
officers, he said, are under constant
pressure to produce results, He told
the story of one such officer who was
assigned to Geneva and told he would
find within seven days a citizen who
was willing to cooperate or be flown

back to Russia where shame would
await him.

The spy world does not always
match the James Bond image, Moss
said. “It is dirty, sleazy and cold,”’ he
said.

Although the Soviet intelligence
services may be the largest, they are
not the most effective, Moss said. He
said a lot of time is wasted on bureau-
cracy.

Moss called the U.S.S.R. itself a
“rotting, decaying empire”’ with ‘‘so-
cial and economic problems it can’t
begin to resolve.”

He questioned the goals of Soviet
leaders in launching an anti-drunken-
ness campaign, claiming that the
scale of drinking taking place in the
country illustrates the common
worker’s need for escape.

“If we stop the Russian worker
from drinking so he can see how ter-
rible things are, he will want to do
something about it,’’ Moss said.

Bookstore charge privileges
reinstated after complaints

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Complaints from students and the
desire to avoid further inconvenience
has led to the reinstatement of
spring-term student charge privi-
leges at the University Bookstore, ac-
cording to University President John
D. Wilson.

Charge accounts had been sus-
pended April 26, several weeks ear-
lier than usual.

After charge accounts were closed,
Wilson said, Executive Committee
President Cole Dawson came to him
with complaints from students. The
change in schedule apparently took
students by surprise, creating a pro-
blem, Wilson added.

Wilson explained that he asked the
bookstore management and the Uni-
versity business office to examine
the situation and determine whether

the charge accounts could be reopen-
ed.

The change in the charge schedule
was announced last summer‘ in a let-
ter sent to students by bookstore
manager Helena W. Roller. In a par-
agraph headed ‘“‘IMPORTANT,” the
letter states: “‘Charge accounts close
in April — Friday after Spring Term
classes begin.”’

In addition to the summer letter,
University Treasurer E. Stewart Ep-
ley said notices announcing the clos-
ing of charges were sent with book-
store bills in both February and Mar-
ch.

Epley said charges were left open
for the first week after spring break
to allow students to charge their text-
books for spring term classes.

Roller said she doesn’t like the
latest change in the charge schedule.

“T don’t like the changes,’’ she
said. ‘‘Things should finish the way
they were set up. I don’t know why

HBOed out?

New cable channel may be offered

 

By STEVE CONNER
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee students
bored with watching HBO and tired
of syndicated television shows such
as ‘Leave It To Beaver’’ and ‘‘The
Andy Griffith Show’ may have the
choice of a new cable channel for
their viewing pleasure.

The Lexington Cable Co. has just
completed a survey of its service in
the area and is considering expan-
ding the number of cable channels to
13 or making available the opportuni-
ty to subscribe to the Music Televi-
sion station (MTV).

Lexington Cable Co. office
manager Juanita Hamm said the
company recently conducted a
survey in which every 10th sub-
scriber was polled and asked to res-
pond to various questions about the

company’s policy and service.

Hamm said that about 250 cable
subscribers were asked about the
company’s quality of service, service
complaints about the cable system,
feelings toward Cable Channel IX
(W&L’s lab station and the Lexington
public access channel), if an expand-
ed service was needed, and what
channels would be preferred if the
cable system were to be enlarged.

The survey results were sent to the
parent company, Mid-Atlantic Net-
works Inc., in Winchester.

Mid-Atlantic Networks will
analyze the survey results and will
determine if the cable services in
Lexington should be expanded,
Hamm said.

Hamm said that the most-asked-
for cable channel among those poll-
ed, especially Washington and Lee
students, was MTV.

they changed it.”’

Epley said the schedule originally
was changed because of problems
collecting bills’ at the efid of the aca-
demic year.

“Students charge up until the last
minute and then take off,” Epley
said. ‘‘Our obligation is to make sure
all the bills are paid on time.”’

He added that the problem is ‘‘not
immense, but it’s enough to make it
bothersome.”

Epley speculated that by the end of
the year students have spent their al-
lotted money but still have other pur-
chases to make.

“They want to take a beer mug
home to Dad, a sweatshirt for a
brother and a cookbook for Mom,”’ he
said.

Slightly less than 60 percent of the
student body uses the charge privi-
lege at the bookstore, University
Controller Robert P. Eversmann es-
timated.

However, the Lexington Cable Co.
cannot expand its services or pro-
grams unless the expansion proposal
is approved by Lexington City Coun-
cil.

If the Lexington Cable Co. receives
the right to expand, it probably would
mean an increase in cable rates,
Hamm said.

The last cable rate increase was in
May 1981 when monthly cable prices
for basic cable went from $7 to $8.

Hamm said she did not know when
Mid-Atlantic Networks would make a
decision on the expansion proposal.

Trustees’ agenda includes
new drug rules, dormitory

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A year ago, in the wake of a special
grand jury investigation of drug
trafficking, the Board of Trustees
asked University President John D.
Wilson to establish a student-faculty
Drug Policy Review Committee.

This weekend, the trustees will
vote on the committee’s proposal.

The policy, approved May 13 by the
faculty, says the school ‘‘does not
condone’’ the possession or use of
drugs or the overuse of alcohol.

Wilson said this week that many
alumni would have found it hard to
accept that a student could be expel-
led from the University for taking 25
cents for a Coke from his roommate’s
dresser but have no disciplinary ac-
tion taken against him for using
drugs.

The proposed drug policy ‘‘clari-
fies the authority of the Student Con-
trol Committee,” he added, and dis-

Wilson said he is content with the
proposal to enlarge the SCC’s power,
saying it is a plus for student autono-
my.

Although hopeful the policy would
reduce the use of drugs among stu-
dents, Wilson said he is not ready to
rule out the possibility that such ac-
tivity will continue.

Also this weekend, the trustees will
discuss the master plan for W&L’s
expected development and, in partic-
ular, listen to architects who have
been working on plans for the new
dormitory on West Nelson Street.

Wilson said costs for the proposed
:residence hall are ‘‘pretty much ball-
park”’ at this point and the board will
authorize a ceiling on indebtedness
for the project.

To raise funds for construction and
planning, the University requested
the Industrial Development Authori-
ty of Rockbridge County to issue $7
million in bonds. The IDA would lend

proceeds from the bonds to the Uni-
versity at a nine or 10 percent inter-
est rate.

University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley said W&L will likely borrow
$6.5 million to construct the dormi-
tory.

Wilson said a pool of endowment
funds and revenue from the income-
producing building would pay off the
loan. He said expenses v;ouid not in-
vade the University’s operatiug reve-
nue.

The master plan being reviewed by
the trustees will also point out the
need for additional athletic fields and
will suggest that the Anthropology-
Archaeological Lab, currently hous-
ed on property that is to be the site of
the new dormitory, be relocated in
the old farmhouse near Liberty Hall.

The board’s agenda also includes a
presentation by the Budget and Audit
Committee.

The trustees will discuss and vote
on the 1985-86 budget and will look at
the result of this year’s budget.

of Murray’s service to the school and the students, The
award was one of several given at last night’s Senior
Night ceremonies in Lee Chapel.

Awards highlight Senior Night

Three seniors, three faculty
members and a local resident were
honored during the Alumni Associ-
ation-sponsored Senior Night last
yesterday.

About 300 seniors, faculty
members and friends of the class
gathered in Lee Chapel for the
awards ceremony and a speech by
Dean of Students Lewis G. John. The
ceremony was followed by a cookout
behind the Alumni House.

During the awards ceremony,
senior Cole Dawson was given the
Frank J. Gilliam Award, ‘‘awarded
annually to that student who has
made the most valuable contribution
to student affairs in one or more
fields,” according to the University
Catalogue. Dawson was selected by
the undergraduate members of the
Executive Committee.

Dawson, an economics major from
Houston, is president of the EC and
was an EC representative during his
freshman and junior years.

John received the other EC award,
the William Webb Pusey Award,
given to a member of the faculty or
administration who has contributed
the most to the University during the
previous year.

The EC also gave a special award
to University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray for his service to
the students. Murray has worked for
Washington and Lee since 1959.

Ring-tum Phi awards, selected by
the editors and business manager of
The Phi, were given to seniors Scott
Tilley and Bob ‘tomaso, Alumni
Director Richard B. Sessoms, former
Publications Director Romulus T.
Weatherman and George Cunning-
ham, a retired Post Office employee
and noted local runner.

Tilley was cited ‘“‘for his unselfish
service to Washington and Lee and
its students.’’ A history major from
Richmond, Tilley has served as
president of the Lampost, chairman
of the W&L College Republicans,
chairman of the University Federa-
tion, editor of the Political Review
and temporary tri-chairman of the
Mock Convention. Tilley has been ac-
cepted to the University of Virginia
School of Law.

In giving Tomaso his award, The
Phi cited his ‘‘extraordinary ser-
vice’ as head dormitory counselor,
senior representative to the EC and
student representative to the Drug
Policy Review Committee. It was
that last role, however, that led to the
award, as the Phi editors cited
Tomaso’s minority report against not
penalizing the use of drugs in dor-
mitories. His view eventually was en-
dorsed by the faculty. Tomaso, an
economics major from Milford,

Mass., next year will assume the
position of admissions counselor cur-
rently held by Bennett Ross.

The Phi cited Sessoms ‘‘for his
devoted service to Washington and
Lee and its students.’’ The editors
praised his ability to placate the
alumni during the coeducation de-
bate and the transition to coeduca-
tion and his interest in and love for
Washington and'Lee and its students.

Weatherman, cited “for his many
years of devoted service,” was
Publications Director for 17 years un-
til his death earlier this month. The
editors said the posthumous award
was in recognition of the im-
provements he helped bring about in
all of W&L’s publications, His wife,
Clara Belle Weatherman, accepted
the award.

Cunningham was cited for “his
friendship, determination and
courage”’ both in his job at the Lex-
ington Post Office and after his
retirement last fall. Despite a
laryngectomy in 1978 that makes
speaking and breathing difficult,
Cunningham has maintained an ac-
tive running schedule and in October
competed in and completed the New
York Marathon.

Lacrosse: ‘Softer schedule’ key to staying Division |?

Continued from Page 1
make the tournament, I don’t see us
having a chance at getting beyond
the first round.”

Daly, though, does not view the
harsh forecast as the result of any
particular failing on his team’s part.
‘I really think this group of kids and
coaches has done what it takes
across the board,”’ he said.

The problem lies, he explained, in
looking at the scholarship trend and
the effect of the increasing cost of a
college education. Recruiting — in
terms of attracting the kinds of play-
ers that will get a team into the tour-
nament — logically suffers, he said.

Daly said that despite the team’s
effort, the negative effect on recruit-
ing will be difficult to overcome. ““My
sense is that — and maybe I’m too
close to this season right now to feel
otherwise — but my sense is that
we've been banging our heads
against a wall, a brick wall,”’ he said.

Terry Corcoran, head lacrosse
coach at Washington College, a top
Division III program with a team
that beat W&L this season 14-13 in
double overtime, was impressed with
the Generals’ performance that day.
“They played outstanding against
us,”’ he said.

On the other hand, Corcoran also
can see the problems that W&L
faces: “If I were coaching a team
playing Division I lacrosse, I
wouldn’t want to be playing against
the Division I schools W&L is playing
without scholarships.”’

McHenry explained that the major
change in the game came in 1977
when the Atlantic Coast Conference
elevated lacrosse to one of its confer-
ence championship sports. Athletic
scholarships naturally followed,
strengthening W&L’s traditional re-
gional rivals such as the universities
of Virginia, North Carolina and
Maryland.

The result has been an increase in
the prowess of W&L’s opponents
while W&L has remained unchanged.
“The game has not changed,” noted
William N. Clements II, a 1950 all-
American General goalie. ‘“‘Rather,
other universities’ approach to the
game has changed.”’

Since 1977, W&L has made two
NCAA tournament appearances, los-
ing in the first round in 1978 (12-2 to
Cornell) and 1980 (12-4 to Syracuse).
In comparison, the Generals appear-
ed in the tournament in each of the
six years preceding the ACC deci-
sion. Their best finishes were semi-
final appearances in 1973, 1974 and
1975.

The players say they have come to
feel the difficulty of competing
against the Division I scholarship
teams.

“It’s difficult to have the schedule
we've had and to be able to expect to
win them all,”’ said junior defense-
man Chris John, a Lexington native
who grew up during the glory years
of W&L lacrosse and its six straight
tournament appearances.

Senior goaltender John Di Duro,
one of the team’s three captains, said
the season’s losses to Maryland,
Virginia and North Carolina did
become frustrating. ‘It was tough to
have practice on Monday after get-
ting our butts kicked,’’ he said.

for a good Division I program.

Emmer said specific action is
needed: ‘The school has to set up a
system where if a guy has 1,000-plus
on his boards, you’re going to be able
to work with him.”’ He added that the
same practice should also work to
benefit all students with a special
talent — in music, for example.

Emmer was quick to point out,
however, that such a position does
not necessarily lead one down the
slippery slope of scholarship sports,
where the coach becomes, in effect,
the admissions director.

‘A lot of people are fearful that to
commit to Division I means you have
to prostitute yourself and lower your
standards,” he said. “I think W&L
could be competitive without that
happening.”’

Some players feel that some con-
cessions must be made somewhere,
though.

“With the tougher academic stan-
dards, I think some concessions are
going to have to be made down the
line just to keep up the quality of the
program because obviously it’s been
slipping,’”’ sophomore defenseman
T.J. Finnerty said.

Chris John agrees. ‘‘There’s no
question that W&L will have to go to
Division III if we don’t get any help
from admissions,” he said. ‘‘They’re
going to have to look at more well-
rounded individuals. I think we can
stay competitive but we do need help
from admissions.”’

Although W&L’s conflict with ad-
missions and financial aid is a direct
result of its Division III athletic ap-
proach, there appears to be little like-
lihood of change in that philosophy.

W. Michael Hallman, a W&L ad-
missions counselor and the liaison
between the coaches and the admis-
sions department, explained the se-
lection process this way: ‘‘All of our
dealings with lacrosse fall under the
blanket of the Division III philo-
sophy.... We treat lacrosse prospects
the same as other applicants.”’

The same is true for financial aid.
According to Financial Aid Director
John H. DeCourcy, the school tries to
provide the best aid package possible
to all qualified students, especially if
the student is particularly interested
in W&L.

DeCourcy explained, however, that
‘tacademics is the only bias built in’’
to the school’s sytem for awarding fi-
nancial aid.

Freshman Greg Unger, a defense-
man for the Generals, said the in-
troduction of scholarships without
tarnishing W&L’s academic stan-
dards might solve all the problems
but sees that as unlikely. ‘I don’t
foresee them changing,’’ he said. ‘‘I
wish they would.”’

By virtue of its Division I lacrosse
status, the school has the option of
giving all of the aid awarded to a la-
crosse player in the form of a grant
instead of the usual combination of a
grant, loan and work-study job, ac-
cording to Tom Calder, a legislative
services representative at the
NCAA’s headquarters in Mission,
Kansas.

Under this setup, the student-ath-
lete would be restricted to competing
only in lacrosse, because the convert-
ed financial aid package is, in

Daly explains: ‘‘I look out there 4 essence, an athletic scholarship,

and I see what our kids’ effort was
against Washington College and I see
the satisfaction in their eyes and
within the team about the kind of ef-
fort and that good feeling.

“‘T have also seen that team have to
look at themselves after they played
their hearts out against a Virginia
and they lose 17-6.”

Daly said he is prepared to handle
any decision the University makes, \
but “I’m going to need more tools to
coach Division I.’’

Those ‘‘tools’’ would include the
areas of admissions and financial
aid. Daly’s predecessor, Jack Em-
mer, the most successful lacrosse
coach in W&L history and now the

kicked.”’

head man at West Point, one of the
nation’s top teams, thinks W&L can
remain competitive with the bottom
half of the nation’s top 10 to 15 teams.
W&L’s competitiveness, though,
depends largely on the University’s
administrators, Emmer explained.
‘What I think needs to be done is
for the University to make a commit-
ment to support a Division I pro-
gram,” he said. Only if that commit-
ment to Division I includes help in the
areas of admissions and financial
aid, Emmer said, will W&L be able to
attract the student-athlete necessary

which is prohibited in Division III,
Calder said.

W&L, though, only awards full
grants to students who have received
academic scholarships, DeCourcy
explained.

With these standards, most think
the chances of competing with the
highest level in Division I go out the
window. As Maryland head coach
Dick Edell sees it, ‘In today’s game
with all the grants-in-aid, it’s going to
be damn difficult to compete in the
top eight.’’

Dick Szlasa, who coached the W&L
team in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
agrees that the game has changed
since he was in on the 1971 decision to
go to Division I. ‘‘Scholarships have
made a sigificant difference,” he
said.

Szlasa is not ready to shut the door
on W&L in Division I, though. “I
think it’s cyclical — I think W&L will
come back,’’ he said, noting that the
University’s decision to become co-
educational will help to revitalize the
program.

Others echo Szlasa’s view. Former
all-American goalie Clements has
followed the team’s ups and downs
through the past 30 years and thinks
coeducation may put new life into the
program.

Coeducation ‘‘could change the
type of player we can attract,’ he
said. For example, students from the
many single-sex prep schools in the
Baltimore area who may have not
been attracted to the all-male W&L
may be more responsive now that it
is coeducational, he said.

At present, however, the future
does not appear to hold such promise.
W&L can remain a Division I pro-
gram under McHenry’s second op-
tion — playing a softened schedule. If
the 1985 season can be used as a
gauge, W&L defeated Loyola College
and lost to Towson State University
by one goal, and both teams finished
the year ranked among the top 15 in
the nation. The Generals, though,
also lost 20-6 to Division III Roanoke.

Other losses this year included one
each to Maryland, North Carolina
and Virginia — in a row. Daly ex-
plained the toughness of the 1985
schedule by saying he felt W&L had
to play those top-level Division I pro-
grams ‘“‘to get the recognition that we

were a [Division] I team.”’ A softer
schedule, he added, might put an as-
terisk on any chance W&L might
have of being invited to the tourna-
ment

Jim Adams, head coach at Virgin-
ia, put Daly’s thinking in perspec-
tive. “If the idea is to win a national
championship, you have to play these
teams,”’ he said.

Even though no decisions have
“been finalized, a softer schedule is
already in the works for 1986, accord-
ing to Daly. Included in the list of op-
ponents, Daly said, are three Ivy
League teams. Noticeably absent are
North Carolina and Maryland.

In the Ivies, W&L will be compet.
ing against schools with similar aca-
demic and financial requirements. It
is an idea that some, including Uni-
versity President John D. Wilson,
find appealing.

“I think the key for all of our
athletic relationships should be, to
the greatest extent possible, to be
playing with institutions with similar
academic expectations of their stu-
dents,” Wilson said.

“The most unequal condition of all
would be to be playing against
schools where student-athletes who
really aren’t students become promi-

knowledges, given the choice of at-
tending an Ivy League school or
W&L, most students at present would
choose the lvy League school.

Daly said the Ivy League idea ini-
tially appealed to him, but he now
sees it as a “stopgap.”

“One of two things is going to hap-
pen,”’ he said. “‘Either we’re going to
be successful at it, then the Ivies
won't want to play us, and then we
won't have anybody to play, because
we'll have to go back up to the schol-
arship programs, and we're not
there.

“Or, we’re gonna lose against the
Ivies, if the Cornell game [14-9 loss
this season] is any indication. Then,
so much irreparable damage could
be done to the program, that if you
have three, four, five years of losing
records, when you decide to go to
[Division] III, you’re not going to
have anybody left around here who
can be competitive against III.”

President Wilson said he hopes the
Ivy League orientation is not so pro-
blematic. Although the recruiting
concerns associated with going head-
to-head against the Ivies are real, he
said, other W&L athletic programs
are able to recruit against Ivy
League schools and W&L offers,

nent,’’ he added.

Richie Moran, Cornell University’s
head coach for 17 years, says benefits
of the Ivy League include the tourna-
ment bid an Ivy League school re-
ceives in most years and — surpris-
ingly, perhaps — recruiting.

More importantly, Moran added,
the educational benefits of attending
a top-level academic institution out-
weigh the immediate gratification of
any athletic scholarship.

Unger said W&L is competitive
with the Ivy League-type schools.
“Against the top seven or eight,

among other things, unique advan-
tages such as its prominence in the
South.

Daly disagrees. ‘‘I don’t know how
realistic it is to maintain our same
policies and philosophies and try to
play Division I by positioning our-
selves as a small Ivy, an independent
Ivy, when really what we have is a
very, very competitive Division III
team,” he said.

A further consideration is involved
with the orientation toward the Ivies
and the softer schedule. ‘‘The feeling
is that if we’re going to make the

we’re definitely out of our league,”
he added. ‘When you go past them,
though, I think we’re competitive.”’
Within this concept, as well, there
are disagreements. Even Daly is un-
sure that an Ivy orientation is all that
practical or productive. Travel costs
would be a factor. Also, Daly ac-

tournament, this is the way we're go-
ing to do it, but you would have to do
very well,’’ said John, pointing to
C.W. Post, which was 12-2 this year
but did not make the tournament.
Both John and President Wilson,
however, espouse the view that a na-
tional championship should not be

the only determinant of competitive-
ness. As Wilson put it: ““How many
people play Division I football with-
out any hope of ever winning a na-
tional title?”’

John, a captain on next year’s
squad, thinks the team’s first priority
for 1986 and beyond is to play well
and improve its record. ‘Whatever
the decision, the team’s going to get
out there and get behind it,” he said.

McHenry’s third option, to make
the move to Division III, inspires the

“‘T think the key for all
of our athletic relation-
ships should be, to the
greatest extent possible,
to be playing with insti-
tutions with similar aca-
demic expectations of
their students.”

—John D. Wilson

greatest emotions, as it touches an
intangible but very real part of W&L
— its pride.

W&L historically has done well
against the best Division III has had
to offer. The Generals’ record
against the smaller schools is 37-8 in
the 15 seasons since the NCAA’s
classification decision. A pertinent
footnote to that record, though, is
that in the last three years W&L has
split its eight contests against Divi-
sion III opponents.

Daly applauds the school’s decision
in 1971 to compete in Division I. If the
decision had to be made today,
though, Daly said he doesn’t ‘‘see
how the school could choose to be Di-
vision I.”’

George C. ‘‘Chuck” O’Connell Jr.,
an assistant lacrosse coach at W&L
during the powerhouse years of the
1970s, said he could see the hand-
writing on the wall in the latter part
of the decade. In 1981, O’Connell said,
he and Emmer discussed the possi-
bility of a move.

“We could see that even with all of
our established contacts and the
players we had that it would be three
to five years before we could get back
to where we were,”’ said O’Connell,
now assistant athletic director and
assistant football coach.

The coaches put the question to a
team vote after the 1981 season. Only
one player on the squad voted to
move to Division III, and he changed
his vote to Division I when he was
told that going Division III would
mean W&L could not play in the Divi-
sion I tournament.

Hindsight, though, is always 20-20.
“If you’re realistic about it, we fooled
ourselves,’’ O’Connell said.

Clements, who saw W&L’s perfor-
mance against Washington College
this season, said Division III looks
like the only alternative right now.
“The only thing is, if you move to
Division III, it’s irreversible,” he
said.

The permanence of the decision
rings true to a university that is just
one year removed from agreeing to
admit women for the first time in its
236-year history. It is a fact that
looms large in Di Duro’s mind.

“For all my years at W&L, I’ve
considered Division III to be an op-
tion, but the more I think about it,
once you go Division III, you can’t go
back,”’ the senior tri-captain said. ‘‘I
think we should stay Division I for a
couple of years. The next couple of
years will be the tell-tale years.”’

Daly says that in addition to the
decision’s irreversibility, there is
another misgiving some may have
about Division III.

“No one’s upset about playing a
schedule of Hobarts and Washington
Colleges,’’ he said. “It’s some other
schools that I think people are ¢on-
cerned about and the lack of some
schools on the schedule that people
are concerned about if we went to
[Division] III.”

Others see that same lack of gla-
mour about Division III. ‘I don’t
know if you get the same thrill play-
ing at Western Maryland that you
might get playing at the [Carrier]
Dome in Syracuse, but maybe you
do,’’ Szlasa wondered aloud.

If W&L were to move to Division
III, the Generals would almost neces-
sarily have to join the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference for lacrosse.
With the exception of Roanoke (this
year ranked fourth in Division III),
the ODAC offers little in the way of
top-level competition.

It is in Division III, however, that
many feel W&L would be most com-
petitive. Corcoran of Washington Col-
lege and Virginia’s Adams both feel
W&L would be near the top in Divi-
sion III. ‘“They would certainly have
a good shot at winning the tourna-
ment in Division III,’’ Adams said.

It is the possibility of success that
is the major attration. ‘Everybody

 

 

wants the ring,’’ Daly said. ‘‘It’s not
something that’s automatic [getting
a bid to the Division III tournament],
but it’s more realistic. There’s a
greater chance of success on that
level.’’

Sophomore defenseman Finnerty
is one of those who favors the move to
Division III. ‘I myself would prefer
to go Division III,” he said. “I like
the idea of going for a title and being
able to compete for the top spot.”’

Daly and John both pointed out that
as things are now, W&L has a compe-
titive Division II] team, but that
nothing should be changed with the
program if a move to Division III is
made. Daly said that if a move is
made, the University should avoid
the tendency to think that because
the team is competing on a lower
level, it will need less financial sup-
port.

With the move to Division III also
comes a concern about the effect
such a move would have on athletes
that had been recruited to play Divi-
sion I lacrosse.

Finnerty says he wouldn’t feel
cheated if W&L decided to move to
Division III. “I was looking forward
to playing in Division I, but I guess
I’ve become more realistic,’ he ad-
ded.

O’Connell put the matter in per-
spective for those who feel they
would be betrayed by a change in di-
visions. ‘‘If guys start to say, ‘I’m
leaving,’ where are they going to
go?”’ he asked.

At the same time, the existence of
W&L as an opportunity for the bor-
derline player to play Division I la-
crosse is something that argues for
the Generals to remain as they are.

Clements explains: ‘‘As we go into
the next 10 years, you don’t want to
take away anything that might at-
tract a student to W&L’’

John identified the need to act
carefully. “It’s a shame to give up on
it before it’s dead,”’ he said.

Beyond that, it is more than pre-
sent and future students that would
be affected by any decision. As Mary-
land’s Edell, one who has exper-
ienced the enthusiasm that has ac-
companied W&L lacrosse in the past,
explains: ‘‘There’s a lot of people and
alumni who will die a little bit if they
stop fighting the Division I wars.”

Clements, one of those alumni,
agreed with Edell, but noted that as
with the coed decision, ‘‘they’ll get
over it.’”’

The ramifications of the decision
are as complicated as they are num-
erous. As Cornell’s Moran under-
States: ‘‘It’s not an easy task you
have down there.” Most agree,
though, that a University decision to
commit itself one way or the other
must be made.

With June 1 as the NCAA deadline
for declaring a change in divisions, a

move is not likely for next season, but
as O’Connell said: ‘‘The longer we
fiddle and fool and don’t make a con-
scious decision to do something, the
tougher it’s going to be down the
road.”’

“It comes down to the administra-
tion,’’ Clements said. ‘‘Someone has
to bite the bullet.”

Daly agreed that a choice has to be
made. ‘‘Either there has to be a re-
emphasis and a greater emphasis
given to Division I and say, ‘This is

 

what it’s going to take for us to be

competitive in Division I,’ and come
up with some guidelines, or else say,
‘The way we want to to it...is the way
we've been doing it,’ and then, decide
where that is most competitive,” he
said.

President Wilson said that al-
though he has no timetable in mind,
the issue is not being ignored. ‘I do
concede this: This is not a situation
that can be allowed to drift,” he said.
“The lacrosse world has changed and
continues to change too rapidly.”

The decision rests with the players,
McHenry said. ‘We want to make the
experience valuable for the partici-
pants,”’ he added. ‘“‘We want to strive
to make the playing experience valu-
able and fun and to be able to play at
the highest level possible,”’

Unger, although only a freshman,
perhaps understands the situation as
clearly as it can be understood.

“For me as a freshman, it was
fun,” he said. “You always dream of
playing the best, but I can see that for
~ upperclassmen it would wear
off.”’

“Yeah, it got discouraging some-
times.’’

TIME
OUT...
By Mike
Stachura

  

 

 

 

It is clear that the champ did not dominate ‘‘The Truth” Monday
night. A score of 146-139 means the champ out-and-out was better than
his challenger in 11 of the 15 rounds. Not a terribly lucid deduction,
granted, but certainly one that reveals a decision that is questionable,
at best, unfair, at worst.

Holmes was out on his feet, couldn’t open his right eye after the fight
and didn’t seriously hurt his opponent at all during the fight.

Now, don’t get me wrong. ‘‘The Truth” was no ball of fire, either.
Although he landed more jabs than Holmes knew what to do with, the
unknown-who-became-known checked out after the 10th round.

So, let’s see, we’ve got two fighters, neither of whom was knocking
down any doors to earn the victory. The next question has to be, ‘‘What
were these two doing taking up prime time TV?”

Well, you see NBC had shelled out the dough for a Michael Spinks-
Holmes get-together. When Michael said, ‘‘Well, gee, maybe not,”’ the
Peacock fellas were left with the proverbial all-dressed-up-for-your-
date-when-she-blows-you-off look. Holmes, and he is a champion
(maybe not a winner on Monday, though), came to the network’s
rescue and fought a relative unknown in a fight that got a good deal of
viewers. That is it got a lot of viewers because it was on so long.

The point of all this being that 1) Holmes should not have fought; he
was not prepared and it showed; and 2) when Holmes does fight again,
and some say that could be as many as two more times before
November, it would be worthy of the title of champion that he fight
somebody who's going to make it worth my while to miss ABC’s Mon-
day Night Movie, say a Pinklon Thomas who would stop the champ
after four of his normal boring rounds, or even a Michael Spinks,
whose quickness would cause problems for the old man.

But whatever you do, Marv Albert, tell Ferdie to tell us something
we don’t know....

...A quick trip by the Colonnade, where we have congratulations
galore: First, to tennis all-Americans David McLeod, Chris Wiman
and Andy Haring. For the first two, an idea of what is to come, for Mr.
Haring, a much-deserved reward for four years of exemplary
play...As well, a universal doff of the cap to all those senior athletes
and other ‘award winners at the Sports Awards night on Tuesday. The
glory may not come every week in the papers or on television, it may
never come at all, but the personal satisfaction on a job done to the
best of your ability is something all of you have earned and can keep
long after the headlines are forgotten. ...

...Other topics for discussion: Watch out for Yannick Noah at the
French Open. He won at Il Foro Italico and is playing as well as he can
play on clay...Tired of the USFL yet? Well, now there’s the USBL.
Featured in USA Today (where else? ), the new league wants basket-
ball in the summer. How far away are we from the USHASL, that is,
the United States Hockey from August to September League’...

...Word is that Bernie Kosar’s financial adviser-dentist is chit-
chatting with the Useful League’s Portland Breakers. Nice idea, not.
Seems to me I remember another famous college passer passing up
the NFL, don’t rember his name anymore, though...As much as I hate
to admit it, Lakers will make all that talk of a possible Celtics repeat
seem like drivel...

....And finally, word is Jackie Stewart will not be used during ABC’s
telecast of the Indy 500 on Sunday. Too bad, the Scotsman’s dulcid tone
was the only thing that could ever make watch things going around in
circles for a couple of hours interesting, or at least bearable. But then,
what else would you expect from a network that gave us the intellec-
tually stimulating ‘‘Joanie Loves Chachi’’?...

Principia’s
Clark claims
D-3 net title

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Toby Clark of Principia defeated
Swarthmore’s Shep Davidson 6-3, 6-1
to capture the NCAA Division ITI Na-
tional Singles Championship on Sun-
day afternoon at the Washington and
Lee tennis courts. Following his sin-
gles match, Davidson teamed up
with Jeff Krieger to win the doubles
title by defeating Redland’s John
Bunch and Roy Chow, 7-6, 6-7, 7-5.

Making very few errors and using
heavy topspin to consistently pass
Davidson at the net, Clark dominated
the first set. From 2-1, he held his
serve twice and broke Davidson
again to build a 5-1 lead. Davidson
did manage to hold his serve to make

' the score 5-2, and showed signs of a

comeback when he broke Clark to
make the score 5-3. Clark, however,
ended Davidson’s rally by breaking
his serve and closing out the first set
6-3.

In the second set, Davidson failed
to make any significant adjustments
to handle Clark’s steady baseline
game.

‘It was a combination of myself
playing well and Shep having an off
day,” said Clark moments following
his victory. He added, “‘I hit the right
shots at the right time.”

The depth of the singles draw was
revealed in that neither Clark nor
Davidson is the number one player
for his school.

Clark, a freshman, said that he
spent most of his season just trying to
qualify for the national tournament
and never really thought about win-
ning the tournament until he arrived
in Lexington. He said, ‘‘When I got
here and saw the other players, I saw
that I could win.”

In the doubles, Bunch-Chow broke
Davidson’s serve in the 10th game to
tie the first set. The teams remained
on serve until 6-6 when they played a
tie-breaker for the first set. Redlands
seized an early 4-2 lead in the tie-
breaker and eventually had a set
point at 7-6, but Krieger-Davidson
fought back and won the breaker 10-8
when Davidson hit an overhead win-
ner on set point.

Davidson opened the second set by
holding his serve. The team from
Swarthmore continued to play well
as they broke Chow’s serve to take a
2-0 lead. Krieger-Davidson had the
opportunity to take a 3-0 lead with
Krieger serving a sudden-death point
at 3-3. Bunch, however, kept his team
in the matoh with a backhand return
down the line that broke Krieger’s
serve and made the score 2-1. The
teams remained on serve until Chow
was broken again on his next service
game to give Krieger-Davidson a 4-2
lead. The Redlands team, however,
answered by breaking Krieger’s
serve and then held their own to tie
the score at 4-4. Once again both
teams remained on serve until 6-6
when they entered the second tie-
breaker in as many sets. Once again
Bunch-Chow took an early lead but
this time they held it and won the
tiebreaker 7-3.

The third and final set resembled
the first two. Chow had his serve
broken in the third game and Krieger
held his to give his team a 3-1 lead.
Bunch-Chow, however, got the break
back against Krieger and tied the set
score at 4-4. Bunch then held serve
and the Redlands team suddenly led
5-4. With Davidson serving a sudden
death point in the next game, Bunch-
Chow had a match point but failed to
convert it and the score was once
again tied at 5-5.

Krieger-Davidson then broke
Chow’s serve for the fifth time in the
match and took a 6-5 lead. Krieger
held his serve and Krieger-Davidson
had won the match that had lasted
for two hours and six minutes.

College radio: You can still be

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

If you’ve been listening to WLUR-
FM this spring, you may have notic-
ed a change in the afternoons
— namely, more contemporary mu-
sic on ‘‘Afternoon Rock.” The radio
students have led the way in bringing
you the music of 1985. Believe it or
not, there are lots of good bands mak-
ing music all over the world. Not only
are international boundaries mean-
ingless to these artists, but the labels
with which music critics convenient-
ly pigeonhole artists are equally

inadequate and meaningless.

This is where college radio and
WLUR fit in. Nowhere else are non-
mainstream musicians and artists
allowed to be heard by a larger au-
dience; college radio is it. An after-
noon rock jock has the unequalled
freedom to program his (or her)
show to explore almost any music
with a beat. The difficulty, and the
listener’s reward, lies in the dj’s
showing where these musics arose
and in showing the musical continui-
ty to the listener. Before U2 there
was Dylan; before Dylan there was
Little Richard (his early inspira-
tion). Any artist worth a damn ab-

Chicago drama critic praises
Martinez stage combat

In a review appearing in the May
issue of Chicago magazine, a Chicago
drama critic has praised the fight
choreography of Associate Drama
Professor Joseph Martinez.

Martinez, a specialist in chor-
eographing stage combat, was the
choreographer for a recent produc-
tion of ‘Hamlet’? by the Wisdom
Bridge Theatre Company.

Wrote drama critic Lenny Klein-
feld: “The closing dual between
Hamlet and Laertes. . .was among
the best I’ve ever seen. It began with
a flashy but mannerly flicking of
blades, then convulsively expanded
into a bloodbath — not only the prin-

cipals but half the bystanders as well
were slaughtered; Elizabethan
luridness amplified by graphic
modern experience with political kill-
ings.”

Martinez is currently staging
classic sword duels in a stage adapta-
tion of Alexander Dumas’ ‘‘The
Three Musketeers,’’ which is being
presented by the Heritage Repertory
Company at the University of Virgin-
ia this summer.

This summer he will conduct an ad-
vanced workshop in the stage combat
arts at his private academy in the
Blue Ridge Mountains.

Burt Reynolds once
again on the ‘Stick’

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
“The Back Page” Editor

 

You've got to hand it to Burt
Reynolds — he never gives up.

Burt started out in the movie busi-
ness playing real tough guys in shoot
‘em up police stories. Then he disco-
vered Sally Field, Coors beer and the
car chase movie. In many of his most
recent efforts, however, Burt has
been struggling to come up with any
really good follow ups to his car
chase flicks.

Burt is back in the tough-guy mold
now, playing ex-con Earnest Stickley
(known to his buddies as ‘‘Stick’’) in
the movie bearing his nickname.

The plot of the movie is not one we
all haven’t seen somewhere at least
once. Ex-con gets out of prison,
meets up with an old buddy from the
good ole days. Said buddy gets gunn-
ed down by some baddies during a
drug money delivery and said ex-con
sets out to revenge the death of his
fallen comrade.

We also get to see the emotional
side of Stick as we are introduced to
his daughter, who grew up while
Stick was in the slammer. Cute girl,
but it becomes too obvious too quick-
ly that her main purpose in the plot is
to be used by the bad guys to put lev-

sorbs everything, even influences
that may not be readily apparent,
and tries to find and project his or her
own voice.

A good programmer aspires to pre-
sent his listener not only with who is
hot, but with the performers who
lighted the fires under them. The
cream of the new will rise, and inevit-
ably these will be the artists who
know their roots and strive to add
their branches to the tree. Leave the
pigeonholes and labels to MTV and
the commercial FM’s; there are
plenty of ‘‘safe’’ outlets for musi-
cians who are willing to play by the
rules. College radio is the only place

erage on dear old dad.

The film moves slowly at first, but
picks up steam by the end. It also
owes a good deal of its success to the
fine cast surrounding Reynolds.

Charles Durning plays a fat-boy
drug dealer who knocked off Stick’s
buddy. George Segal plays an eccen-
tric millionare who hires Stick as his
chauffeur. Candice Bergen has a
small role as Stick's love interest, but
a small role is plenty enough as
Bergen remains one of the most
watchable faces on the silver screen
today.

Reynolds also does an admirable
job of pulling off the tough-guy im-
age. One item I felt was noteworthy:
Stick goes out of his way not to use a
firearm during most of the movie.
Then the bad guys push him too far
and he breaks bad with barrages of
automatic weapon fire.

“Stick”’ is, overall, an entertaining
movie that is worth the price of ad-
mission. You will have to move
quickly, though, if you want to see it
in Lexington. Tonight will be the last
night you can catch “Stick” at the
State Theatre. The State will begin
showing ‘‘Just One of the Guys’”’ to-
morrow, and the Lyric will begin
shows of ‘‘Code of Silence’ on the
same day.

surprised

where you can still be surprised by
what’s coming out of the speaker.
Who knows; you may be like Janie —
“her life was saved by Rock and
Roll.”

So listen to WLUR, now and next
year, for radio that is vital, interest-
ing and occasionally inspirational.
Not just rock, either; jazz, blues,
folk, soul or whatever label you like;
WLUR has them all. You’ll hear the
connection between who’s who and
who was_ who and be able to hear
who’s next. As Bob Marley said,
“One good thing about music, when it
hits you feel no pain.” Treat your
ears right, and keep the dial on 91.5.

5 P.E.s? No debts? You can graduate

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

As graduation nears and expectations of life
after W&L arise for nearly 300 seniors, a few ‘‘non
academic forces’’ conceivably could prevent a
handful of seniors from receiving those coveted
sheepskins

Since freshman orientation and their initial
meeting with faculty advisers, students have been
warned about one of these requirements — that
they must pass five physical educ..tion courses in
order to graduate. The University Catalogue
specifically states that ‘‘degree requirements in-
clude five physical education activity courses.”

Associate Athletic Director Richard Miller said
that in his 33 years at W&L there have been ‘“‘about
a half-dozen cases’ of students’ failing to
graduate because of unfulfilled P.E. require-
ments.

“There has been no one in the past five or six
years who failed to graduate because of insuffi-
cient P.E.s,”’ Miller said. ‘‘No one in this year’s
class will fail to graduate because of it; there were
some who were close.”’

Miller said there seems to be a correlation be-
tween the students who performed poorly academ-
ically and those who did poorly in physical educa-
tion classes

“If you're a borderline student over there [in
regular courses], then you’ll probably be a poor
student over here,”’ Miller said.

Cutting classes is the major culprit, according
to Miller, who added that ‘about 95 percent of the
student body received a ‘B’ or better in P.E., but
you have to go to class.”’

The problem of student procrastination in fulfill-
ing the P.E. requirements has become worse in re-
cent years, Miller said. ‘About 75 seniors are tak-
ing P.E. in the spring term to finish their require-
ment, and one student is even taking three P.E.s,”’

he added.

Miller said students can be excused from phys
ical education requirements if they have certified
medical excuses, but this is the only valid reason
for not participating in P.E. Some students in the
past have been caught purchasing medical ex-
cuses in attempts to avoid the physical education
requirement, Miller added

Financial factors also can result in a denial of
the sheepskin. The University Catalogue again is
explicit when it states that ‘‘if amounts owed the
University are not paid, the University may with-
hold a student’s grades; withhold transcripts;
[or] withhold the granting of a degree and the is-
suance of a diploma to graduating students.”

Registrar Harold S. Head, retiring this year
after 19 years at W&L, says students are ‘notified
and warned”’ by the business office or the Regis-
trar’s office if they owe the University money. A
card-file is kept on such things as unpaid parking

Making more use of the University computer
in the Registrar’s Office is a stated goal of the
new University Registrar, appointed last week
to replace Col. Harold S. Head, who is retiring
after 19 years.

The new registrar, D. Scott Dittman, 31, has
been registrar at Muskingum College in New
Concord, Ohio, since 1982. He was selected
from about 70 applicants for the position, ac-
cording to Dean of the College John W. Elrod.

 

Sept. 1.

Dittman’s undergraduate degree in compu-
ter science from Colgate University was one of
several factors that led to his being an attrac-
tive candidate, said Elrod, chairman of the
search committee.

Elrod also cited Dittman’s experience as re-
gistrar at Muskingum, a 1,000-student liberal
arts college, and his ‘‘very high marks’’ from
the provost and dean of students there.

During a May 13 visit to campus, Dittman

The Board of Trustees last
weekend approved a new drug policy
for the University and authorized the
spending of nearly $3.5 million for a
variety of projects intended to im-
prove campus facilities, administra-
tion officials said this week.

The board also appointed a sub-
committee to study the University’s
policies with regard to investments
with companies or banks doing busi-
ness in South Africa.

University President John D. Wil-
son gave the board a petition signed
by 342 members of the University
community asking the school to
consider withdrawing support from
companies that do business in South
Africa. The petition had been pre-
sented to Wilson by representatives
of the Washington and Lee Campaign
Against Apartheid.

C. Royce Hough III of Jacksonville,

Board backs
drug policy

The board ‘‘accepted with grati-

that the school ‘does not condone

overuse of alcohol, he added.

tees took note of increased power
given to the Student Control Commit-
tee and ‘“‘self-consciously approved’
that provision, Wilson said

One of the trustees told the board
that the wording of the policy would
have to be altered to clear up a legal

Hayne warns

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

 

At the year’s final Interfraternity
Council meeting, President Jaimie
Hayne warned that twe or three fra-
ternities likely will be victims of the
school’s move to coeducation

“Everyone needs to realize that
within the next five years, the num
ber of men will be reduced,”’ he said
“There will be about 1,000 men and
500 women. With 65 percent of the
men pledging fraternities, that
means there will be 300 less men in
the fraternity system.”

“‘Let’s face it: It is fact that two or
three houses are going to go under,”’
he continued. ‘‘We need to get a high
er percentage of men in the system.

Hayne also assured the IFC that
the Board of Trustees is not attemp
ting to dissolve the fraternity system

‘They are reviewing the whole sys
tem,’ he said. ‘‘They want to make

OPINION
Farewell

All year, I’ve vowed to myself that I would resist the temp-
tation to write an editorial in the final newspaper of the year
— after all, it seemed so high-schoolish.

Now that I’m in my final week as a Washington and Lee
student, though, I’ve succumbed to the temptation. They
don’t let newspaper editors speak at graduation, so this
seemed to be my only opportunity, and I wanted to take
advantage of it.

This weakening of my resistance also was spurred some-
what by a comment made recently by a friend, a Hollins
graduate who was at W&L for a year as an exchange student.
Talking about the well-known statement that the college
years are the best four years of our lives, she said, ‘“They are
good years, but they’re not the best.”’

One reason my college years may not have been the best is
that I’ve failed to take advantage of the numerous opportuni-
ties available here. Washington and Lee offers so many uni-
que opportunities, yet I seem to have spent four years in Reid
Hall and the Ring-tum Phi office.

There are so many things I regret not doing during my four
years:

eTaking a course from Sid Coulling.

*Going to Goshen more frequently.

eTaking a course from J.D. Futch (although I probably
don’t own enough ties).

eTrying to write an honors thesis.

eSeeing Southern Comfort more than once (at last Wednes-
day’s Senior Night).

eDouble-majoring.

eSpending a spring afternoon with the children at R.E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal Church.

Living in the country.

eTaking more road trips.

Our University — and, indeed, the surrounding community
— offers such a variety of opportunities that there always
should be plenty to do. We often complain that ‘‘nothing ever
happens in Lexington.’’ In fact, nothing could be farther from
a truth. Lexington has a concert series that cities 10 times its
size would be proud to have; several good theater produc-
tions each year; and Division I football and basketball teams
(not to mention lacrosse and water polo).

Bored? It hardly seems possible. Go to the library and read
The Village Voice, take a professor to lunch in the Cockpit or
spend an afternoon at Liberty Hall with a good book and
some suntan lotion.

The years here are too short to be whiled away. Parties are
fun, and schoolwork takes up a lot of time (or at least is
designed to), but there’s more to college life than academics
and social events. The students who realize this will get the
most for their tuition and probably will be prepared better for
the future.

Those of us leaving behind professors and classrooms,
lacrosse fields and Goshen, to enter the “‘real world’’ must
remember that in whatever we do, wherever we go, we take
Washington and Lee with us. In our pursuits, as at Washing-
ton and Lee, we must always seek to do our best — we can ask
no more of ourselves. If we fail to do our best, we will have
failed Washington and Lee. If we do our best, Washington and
Lee will have succeeded.

In addition to our sheepskins, we take more tangible
aspects of W&L with us. The Honor System here has guided
us through four years of college; why not let it guide us
through the remainder of our life? Our Honor System is by no
means perfect, but I think we could agree that if everybody
lived by it, the world would be a much nicer place.

Greeting a stranger you pass on a busy city sidewalk — just
as you would the same stranger if he were on the Colonnade
— undoubtedly will brighten that person’s day. And in the
‘‘real world,”’ they’ll even let you wear ties.

Because each of us takes so much from Washington and
Lee, I believe this school has a greater impact on us than any
other university would. This is only accurate, though, if we
use our W&L experience after we leave Lexington and live by
W&L’s ideals for the rest of our lives.

We can do much worse than living by those ideals; I would
be more than happy to do so. My four years at Washington
and Lee have been good — I’ll never forget taking courses
from professors Mollenhoff and Smith, occasionally partying
too much and studying too little (and sometimes vice versa),
eating ice cream at Sweet Things, watching the lacrosse
team almost upset North Carolina with the infamous “‘Ar-
madillo” offense, taking late-night study/party breaks at
Lloyd’s, enjoying the history of Lexington and the beauty of
the surrounding area, searching for Lost Cities of Gold and
waiting for the Robert E. Lee at Fancy Dress, watching the
sun rise over Liberty Hall on Easter morning, and of course,
co-editing The Ring-tum Phi.

I will remember — and draw on — these experiences for
the rest of my life. My four years at W&L have been en-
joyable, but they haven’t been perfect. I sincerely hope my
friend’s statement proves true — after all, if this has been the
best four years of my life, what’s left?

Best offense is good defense

 

By N. RADCLIFFE PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

When I accepted the responsibility
this year to write editorials for the
paper, I relished the opportunity to
express opinions. I love controversy,
especially when it somehow involves
me.

But throughout the year, I learned
that controversy isn’t always that
romantic. Writing about your friends
and even your enemies with the
power of the newspaper name behind
you brings a trememdous responsi-
bility. It seems at times the editorials
have become an exercise in offending
as many people as possible. While I
am not prone to compromise, I don’t
enjoy the controversy it always br-
ings either. Sometimes I deserve it.

But despite the displeasure and
grief, I plug away at the Kaypro com-

puter every week, along with the gag-
gle of other Phi writers, trying to con-
tribute some important thoughts to
the direction of opinion on campus.

But thinking of such topics and de-
vising clever ways to hide my ideas
does not allow me to write what I
would really like to say. This column,
therefore, is dedicated to those loose
ends I have wanted to scream and
shout about but which I have so far
left untouched.

Foremost, I am tired of student
and faculty apathy in support of
members of the W&L community.
More than any other year, I have be-
come disillusioned with public atten-
dance at University-sponsored
events. Whether athletic events, Con-
tact speakers, department guests or
visiting lecturers, unless the event is
over-advertised (I am glad there is
no limit on Contact posters) or man-
dated by a professor, attendance has

Student body president
reviews policy changes

To the Editors:

I would like to convey my impres-
sions of the recent change in the
chatging policy of the Bookstore and
last weekend’s meeting of the Board
of Trlistees.

On behalf of the student body, I am
expressing our appreciation for
President Wilson’s thoughtful con-
sideration concerning student
charges in the Bookstore and Supply
Store.

After several students confronted
me about the change in the charging
policy, I had a two-hour meeting with
Mr. Epley and Mr. Eversmann, a
one-hour meeting with Tidge Roller,
the Bookstore manager, and finally
an hour meeting with President
Wilson. The arguments and logic
behind the change did not seem con-
sistent with the overall policy of
trust, respect and freedom which is
so much a part of our community.
The decision was made from a purely
cash flow standpoint which in itself,
although a well-thought-out and
honest attempt to improve the
University’s financial position, was
not benefiting the University as
much as it was hurting the flow of
money through the Bookstore and the
privilege of the students.

After thoughtful consideration and
many questions, President Wilson
took action within an hour of our
meeting.

On another note, a vote of con-
fidence and concern for students’ in-
terests was the general theme run-
ning throughout the Board of
Trustees’ meeting last weekend.
They reaffirmed their commitment
to student self-government and their
absolute support of a strong fraterni-
ty system.

Tom Touchton, chairman of Cam-

Crediting

To the Editors:

Last week’s headline for the article
concerning the 1984-85 Athletic
Awards presented at the all-sports
barbecue makes a rather blatant
omission, which unfortunately tends
to reflect the prevailing attitude in
society today. Each year the Athletic
Department presents four major
awards to recognize outstanding per-
formance, both on and off the field.
However, the headline only makes
mention of those who are ON the
field. Admittedly, these individuals
are more familiar to those who follow
their exploits, so why not put the
eyecatching names at the lead of a
story, since nobody knows the names
of those who do not always play or
work behind the scenes anyway?

It would seem to me that the
answer is quite obvious, but most
often is not the case. Every sporting
event is a team effort, not only re-
quiring the participation of the
players, but also coaches, trainers,
managers, grounds crew and a host
of others. Without ALL of these peo-
ple the package would be incomplete.
Therefore, Dick Morris, as the reci-
pient of the ‘Lefty’ Newell Award
for outstanding service by a student,

pus Life Subcommittee of the
trustees, said that student self-
government is a privilege he ab-
solutely believes in and condones as
long as the actions of students are
responsible and thoughtful.

The Board believes that elevating
Student Control in power and role is
consistent with our policy of self-
government and was grateful to Bob
Tomaso for his reasoned minority
report regarding drug use in the dor-
mitories.

Also, they support the coed com-
mittee’s plans to let all freshmen
choose their own hall parietals in the
beginning of orientation week and
then take a second vote three weeks
later.

Regarding fraternities, the Board
adopted a general policy statement
that replaces the Wednesday night
party restrictions. SAC will recon-
sider this year’s rules and adopt
alternate rules for next fall.

Also the Board adopted a general
policy statement regarding frater-
nities only after President Wilson
critized the use of some unduly harsh

language in one of the policy:

statements. He felt the terminology
was threatening to the fraternitty
system and felt it did not convey the
attitude that the administration or
board wanted to endorse. As a result
of his and others’ reasoned
arguments, the policy statement was
altered. Echoing the sentiments of
the board, Wilson said that the frater-
nities play an integral role in the life
of W&L. The board supports a strong
fraternity system and will do what is
necessary to make sure that they
continue to be strong.

heroes

should have been afforded the same
24-point mention given the other
three gentlemen.

It is unfortunate that those who
perform the ‘“‘thankless’’ tasks
associated with athletics, or any
other profession for that matter, are
so often ignored. Most of those behind
the scenes accept the fact that they
will not often share in the limelight.
Often their primary sense of ac-
complishment and satisfaction is
realized through the success of those
they support. Athletes do, on occa-
sion, recognize the contributions
made by support personnel, and if
unprompted, a small pat on the back
can go a very long way. It does not
take much to motivate someone who
has demonstrated a genuine concern
for a program. If the program did not
matter, they probably would not be
there, but to sense that their
presence does not matter makes for
an often frustrating association. If it
boils down to giving credit where it is
due, then so be it, because those who
occupy the limelight would appear
rather insignificant if there was
nobody to turn it on.

Class of 1985

proven meager at best. Ut course,
there are those departments whose
members conspire to require atten-
dance from all classes within the
department, and all in attendance
then are privileged to hear pompous
professors pronouncing pithy tidbits
of perplexing praxis. Really, how
many students (or for that matter,
faculty) would attend a lecture on the
price of rare espionage works from
the reign of Genghis Khan unless it
were required?

But the problem does not lie mere-
ly within the topics discussed. There
is a deeper cause, one which 1am ata
loss to diagnose. Why don’t students
attend Glee Club concerts? Why
don’t faculty ever attend Contact lec-
tures? Why is it that theater perfor-
mances do not gain the laud they de-
serve? Are we as students unable to
applaud our peers? Is the faculty
guilty of hubris not allowing them to
mingle any more than necessary
with students? What matters is
whether faculty and students alike
really don’t give a damn about sup-
porting others in their quest for
recognition. A speaker paid $4,000 by
Contact or an economist from The
People’s Republic of Massachusetts
are most likely deserving of the same
intellectually curious crowd. As a
university community, we ought to
begin to share the concerns of most
real communities and address the
question of apathy. i be.

Silence, the song says, like a can-
cer grows.

Another concern I hold for the Uni-
versity’s future is the danger pre-
sently posed by the well-meaning but
frightfully misguided intentions of
the anti-apartheid movement on
campus. While they attempt to culti-
vate anathema for the repressive re-
gime in South Africa, they conven-
iently forget the equally — if one dare
talk in degrees here — tyrannical
despots in the Kremlin, Hanoi,
Phnom Penh anu Addis Ababa. If the
basis for action upon the petition
presented to the trustees this past
weekend is out of concern for the
human rights involved, the petition
misses the mark. We might as well
be sure the University divests itself
of any stocks in companies doing bus-
iness with or investing in countries
ruled by equally repressive regimes.
That thought I cherish.

MY VIEW

By B. Scott
Tilley

 

 

 

As the Class of 1985 prepares to
leave the hallowed red bricks and
white columns of Washington and
Lee, amidst the spectrum of emo-
tions each will experience — from
joy to sadness to uncertainty —
each of us should deal with
another question: What mark
have I left behind?

In a finite world, man has an in-
born desire to leave something
behind — “‘to leave his mark.’’ It
makes life meaningful. If we can’t
live forever, let’s make our
memory live forever. Thus, we
find ouselves in a society of
memorials.

And at a school like this, where
we revel in the legacy of Gen. Lee
and many of the giants of the
school’s rich history who are
venerated through portraits,
plaques and buildings named in
their honor, the conscious ques-
tioning of ‘“‘What am I leaving
behind?’ is very real.

The question takes on extra
significance now for the Class of
1985 as we prepare to leave our
four-year comfort zone to enter in-
to the less secure “real world.’
The response, though, must be
viewed as more than just an ego-
booster or ego-buster.

Indeed, as we leave this tran-

 

 

My last view

I do not want merely to demean
those involved in the anti-apartheid
petition. Surely, their intentions are
sound, their beliefs moral. However,
the credibility of their cause has been
sufficiently weakened because of the
absence of certain key countries
from the petition as to call into ques-
tion the validity of the petition. Why
not ask the Soviets also to comply
with the Sullivan principles or else no
trade? Suddenly, it becomes easy to
bully those smaller countries over
which we exert some control. The
day anti-apartheid protestors line up
in front of the Soviet embassy and de-
cry the long history of civil rights
violations and make appointments
for being arrested at their conven- -
ience, I will take up my placard and -
march along with them. Until then, I, -
and hopefully the University as well, -
will kindly decline their invitation to -
political or economic action.

Tied to this issue are the recent -
charges of racism that have been -
hurled about campus. It is easy to.
state one’s opinion about who is a -
racist and who is not. It is another -
matter altogether to try to overcome -
any real or perceived problem. :

Finally, and perhaps with the -
greatest glee, I ought to talk about -
the direction this paper has taken -
this year. As a student who has work- -
ed on The Phi for three years, I know -
Chief Editors Bruce Potter and Mike -
Allen have done an outstanding job. -
The change in format, innovations in :
layout (kudos to Reade Williams °
too!) and a keen eye to editing and :
better writing have established a pre- -
cedent none will findeasy tofollow. .

Ihave defended the paper this year -
before questioning peers while I have -
many times simultaneously question- -
ed the decisions the editors have -
made, Those who read the paper —
rarely know the many hours of sleep
forsaken needed to get the paper out ~
on Thursday afternoon. Few take the -
time to see the effort expended in -
editing and assigning and the calling
and following up on stories and
checking the facts. Bruce and Mike
deserve the credit for all the gain,
and for those times when judgment
might be questioned or subordinates
flub up, they take all the blame. I am
glad they took the time to begin the
search for excellence. They have
made great progress.

sitory stage, the mark we leave
behind is a reflection of the men
we are. What comes out is a
reflection of what is on the inside.

This then is an important
evaluation point for us, In seeing
what kind of impression we have
left on those around us, we can see
which attributes are our strengths
and which are our weaknesses,
and how we want to become better
men in the future.

Washington and Lee has done a
lot to mold us in our four years
here. Hopefully, it was for the
good. Honor, magnanimity and
gentlemanliness are those at-
tributes that we should have ab-
sorbed that will result in positive
marks later in life.

As for me, I, too, hope that I
have left a mark here. Ten or 20
years from now, when you see my
picture while reminiscently flip-
ping through an old Calyx, I hope
you don’t remember me as Scott
the Columnist or Scott the
Republican or Scott the Student.
Rather, if I have left a mark, I
hope it is as Scott, a guy who loved
Christ and tried to reflect that
love to others.

To those of you who remember
me for a smile, a listening ear or
helping hand, hopefully in it you
caught a glimpse of Christ and his
love. That is the attitude Gen. Lee
strove to exemplify and that is the
best mark one can leave behind.

And if you did not see these in
me, understand that I am only
human. I, too, am looking at what
I left behind to see how I can
become a better man in the fu-
ture.

‘“‘He may be the Big Brother, but I have the better view’: Ten-year-old
Matthew Lonas sits atop the shoulders of sophomore John Riordan.

Brothers reach out
to community kids

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Glen Jackson gets a few startled
looks when he introduces people to
his little brother Travis.

The reason for the raised eyebrows
is that Glen Jackson is white while
Travis Jackson is black.

Actually, the Jacksons are not
related. Until October, they had
never seen each other. But they have
become ‘‘brothers’’ in a very special
sense of the word.

The Jacksons are participants in
the Big Brother-Little Brother pro-
gram at Washington and Lee. The
program pairs a W&L student with a
boy from Rockbridge County from a
fatherless home to provide a mature
male influence for the boy.

The elder Jackson, a senior from
Atlanta who heads the program, ex-
plained that it is meant ‘‘to reduce
the estrangement between the col-
lege and the community” by bringing
W&L students into contact with local
people.

“Being a big brother provides a
way to give something back,’’ he
said. “It shows that the same people
who are getting all the parking
tickets in Lexington are the same
people who are trying to help the
kids.”’

‘Our program is unique because it
has our students in the community,”’
he continued. ‘‘It’s an example of our
students reaching out to a bigger
area than the University.”

Other big brothers share Jackson’s
view.

Nick Cromwell, a senior who
volunteered to be a big brother as
part of a psychology course he was
taking, said, “I knew I would get
more out of it than just one point for
extra credit. It was a chance to help
myself and someone else.”’

Cromwell said his experiences with
his own brothers also were a part of
his decision to be a big brother. ‘‘It’s
great to have an older brother who
helps you with problems and things,”’
he said.

“Instead of doing something im-
personal, like selling raffle tickets
and raising money, this is a way tobe
involved with someone,” said John
Riordan, a sophomore.

“T have a little brother at home,
and I knew there were kids here who
needed the same type of guidance,”’
he added.

“According to Jackson, providing

to have to work a lot of long hours to
support the child,” he said. ‘‘Most of
the time, the child is home alone and
so he doesn’t get proper supervi-
sion.”’

Jackson said that in looking for big
brothers, he wants people who are
willing to be role models. The
qualities essential for a big brother
are honesty, good morals and a
desire to spend time and energy with
the little brother by taking him to ball
games or movies, or just watching
television.

Jim Kerr, a junior, said it helps the
parent to have someone take an ac-
tive interest in the child.

“The little brother gets supervision
and learns things he normally learns
at home,’’ he said. “There is a
chance to see that there is nothing
wrong with studying, working hard
and being polite.”’

Senior Chris Fulton agreed.

“After a few months, you see how
you are rubbing off on them. The
more an adult is around, the more the
child picks up,”’ he said.

Riordan added that the supervision
the little brother receives from his
big brother is different from the kind
he gets from his parent.

“Being with their big brother gives
them a chance to be free and relax,”’
he said. ‘‘They don’t have to worry
about being yelled at for a mistake.”’

Fulton said there are times when
the big brother must be a discipli-
narian.

“You never know how much of a
role to play. But there are situations
where you may have to scold the
child,” he said. “You never know
when todo that.’’

The big brothers say they also get a
lot out of the program.

According to Jackson, the big
brothers get involved with people
from a_ different socio-economic
background.

“They get.a look at the real world,”
he said, ‘‘and it gives them a chance
to learn how to give.”’

Cromwell said the program had
taught him not to prejudge people.

‘‘My little brother was black and I
was a little uncomfortable about
that. After getting to know him, I got
over that,’’ he said.

Kerr said one of the benefits for
him was that he got a sense of
perspective.

“When you’re feeling down on
yourself, it’s good to be around a
young kid,”’ he said. ‘You get a new
view of the future.”’

But it was Jackson who described
the program best.

“It makes you feel good,’’ he said.

IFC may take steps
m to reduce party litter

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council is con-
sidering hiring one or more people
next fall to pick up litter on Thurs-
day, Saturday and Sunday mornings,
according to president Jaimie
Hayne.

The decision is the second IFC ac-
tion concerning fraternity party lit-
ter, Hayne said. Three months ago, a
new rule was adopted that imposes a
$50 fine on any fraternity that is re-
ported as having litter on its property
after 8 a.m. on days after parties.

The fine was officially voted into
the IFC bylaws Tuesday night. Under
the ‘‘conduct’’ section of the regula-

IFC

() Continued from Page 1

Changes to the IFC bylaws approv-
ed Tuesday include:

eFreshmen women may attend all
Rush functions except the eight Open
Houses.

eA fraternity may register no more
than 15 women for any one Rush
Date.

Women are limited to three Rush
Dates at any particular fraternity.

¢Men participating in Rush must
attend at least seven Open Houses
and five Rush Dates, no more than
three of them at the same fraternity.

 

 

tions, it notes that ‘we commit our-
selves to good faith efforts in...the ex-
terior appearance of the fraternity
houses and grounds, which on occa-
sion is an eyesore to others.”’

The litter problem is not a new one,
according to Lexington Police Chief
L.O. Sutton. ‘‘Most of the fraternities
do a pretty good job of picking up af-
ter themselves, but everyone needs
reminding occasionally ,”’ he said.

Sutton said fraternities usually are
given a warning when excessive lit-
ter can be seen on their premises,
after which a summons is issued if
the litter is not picked up.

A spokesman for the Lexington
Public Works Department said no
special effort is made on mornings
after parties.

 

Rush Dates again will last 90 min-
utes.

Bids may not be extended until the
fifth Rush Date and may not be ac-
cepted until after the eighth Rush
Date.

Fraternity Rush will not begin until
the last day of freshman orientation,
a change from past years. Freshmen
arrive on Sunday, Sept. 8, and there
is “no contact”’ until Friday, Sept. 13.
The IFC will explain Rush procedure
in a Lee Chapel session the day
before. Formal Rush continues until
Monday, Sept. 30.

The IFC also approved next year’s
budget. Assuming 870 members (an
average of 51 per fraternity), the IFC
plans to assess each house $5.13 per
member to meet its budget.

Musical chairs?

ful as hoped. Epley, however, said
that Carter V. McNeese and Farris
P. Hotchkiss, directors of the fund,
are optimistic that ‘things will pick
up”’ before the end of June.

The Annual Fund consists of contri-
butions from alumni that provide for
about $1,000 of each student’s tuition.

The operating budget passed for
next year is balanced, Epley added.

Assistant to the President Frank A.
Parsons said most of the $3.5 million
appropriated for capital projects
next year will be used to continue
with plans for a new residence hall,
to purchase a new academic compu-
ter and to construct two additional
athletic fields.

“We'll be spending somewhere in
the neighborhood of $2 million in the
next fiscal year’’ on plans for the pro-
posed dormitory, Parsons said.

Architectural designs of the four-
story, horseshoe-shaped _ building,
drawn by Marcellus Wright Cox &
Smith of Richmond, were studied by
the trustees.

“The board did approve the con-
cept of the new dorm,” said Parsons,
adding that the trustees also request-
ed a modification of plans to reduce
costs.

According to Epley, the project
was not fully approved by the board
because ‘‘we haven’t zinged in yet on
how much it will cost’’ to complete
the project. Several weeks ago,
Epley said W&L likely will borrow
$6.5 million to construct the dor-
mitory.

If it becomes necessary to extend
financing for the project beyond the
amount authorized by the board be-
fore October, when the trustees next
meet, a plan will have to be approved
by Wilson and the chairmen of the
Budget and Audit Committee and the
Investment Committee, Epley said.
It also would have to be approved by
the trustees’ Executive Committee.

The two full-sized athletic practice
fields included in plans for next year
will be located in the open space be-
tween U.S. 60 and the unpaved road

leading from Wilson Field to Liberty
Hall. One of the fields will be used for
field hockey, Parsons said.

He added that other ‘‘nickel-and-
dime”’ projects will ease the Univer-
sity’s transition to coeducation.

The Student Health Center, for ex-
ample, will be modified slightly to
give the medical staff flexibility in
serving women.

Additional campus lighting also is
planned.

A classroom on the top floor of
Tucker Hall is scheduled for renova-
tions to provide additional office
space for increased faculty in the ro-
mance languages department.

In addition, office space is planned
for counseling services in the Student
Center. To make room for this, Par-
sons said the browsing library will be
eliminated from the building.

Other projects include the renova-
tion of restrooms at Wilson Field, the
paving of the Woods Creek parking
lot, construction of storage space at
the Buildings and Grounds complex
and construction of a chemical stor-
age vault behind Howe Hall.

Funds also have been appropriated
for the renovation of the Morris
House and a study of the possibility of
moving the Admissions Office to 32
University Place, next to the Alumni
House.

Also this weekend, the board ap-
proved broadening fringe benefits to
cover the entire University staff.

Currently, faculty members have
their children’s college tuition up to
the W&L tuition fee (minus $100) paid
by the University.

Because of a tax law change,
though, these faculty members
would be required to report these
funds as income. To remedy the sit-
uation, the board extended the privi-
lege of receiving up to 90 percent of
W&L’s tuition fee to all University
staff members with college-bound
children.

The trustees also accepted a policy
statement relating to campus life
presented them by Dean of Students
Lewis G. John, chairman of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

“It is our desire that student self-
government should be encouraged
and that a proper balance between
student privilege and responsibility
should be sought and achieved,”’ the
statement says.

“Students must nonetheless re-
main aware that they are members
of a University community whose

traditions, image and reputation can
be harmed by negative actions and
behavior as well as being helped by
positive contributions,’ the state-
ment continues. ‘‘This awareness is
especially important since the
University, lodged as it is within a
larger community, must encourage
respect for local ordinances and law
enforcement and honor the claims of
non-University persons for quiet and
safety.”

The statement will be included in
the 1985-86 Student Handbook.

would not have appointed a registrar
who did not have computer exper-
ience.

“‘We’re not sure just what needs to
be done with the computer over
there,’”’ Elrod added. ‘‘We’re certain
that more can be done with a compu-
ter at a small college.”

Among possible jobs that could be
performed by the computer, Elrod
said, are registration, room assign-
ments, transcripts and grade lists.

He noted, though, that the
University ‘‘doesn’t want to use the
computer just for the sake of using
the computer.’’ For example, al-
though the computer could print and
fold report cards and put them in
envelopes, the University probably
wouldn’t want that to be done
because Dean of Students Lewis G.
John usually writes individual
remarks on the report cards.

‘‘We think that’s very important,”
Elrod said. ‘‘There are little touches
in our system that we want to main-
tain.”’

Dittman said that before he can be-

gin to work with the computer, he
will have to become accustomed to
W&L’s 12-12-44 academic calendar
(two 12-week semesters followed by a
six-week semester, which he called
‘very unusual’’), what he is told is a
“rather complicated’’ set of acade-
mic requirements, and the procedure
of requiring seniors to apply for grad-
uation.

Dittman said he enjoyed his visit to
campus, when he met with the search
committee, the advisory committee,
University President John D. Wilson,
the admissions staff and Head.

“It was a real whirlwind tour,”
said Dittman, adding that he found
the campus ‘‘beautiful...gorgeous.”’

After graduation from Colgate,
Dittman, a native of Canton, N.Y.,
was a Peace Corps volunteer in 1975,
assigned to the Barbados Boy Scout
Association.

In 1976, he returned to Colgate as a
development researcher. in 1977, he
joined the admissions staff at Musk-
ingum, and was assistant director of
admissions from 1979 to 1982, when
he was appointed acting registrar.
He was named registrar the follow-
ing year.

Dittman is a member of the Ameri-
can Association of Collegiate Regis-
trars and Admissions Counselors. He
also has served as adviser to the
Muskingum Christian Fellowship.

In general, all colleges face
some form of racial unbalance
and tension. Usually the smaller
the college, the larger the issue
of racial relations is if there are
minorities on campus. Unfortu-
nately, Washington and Lee
happens to be one of the col-
leges which has problems in race
relations, particularly among
blacks and whites.

The majority of these difficul-
ties in racial harmony entail the
social aspects of the campus,
however, there are many that
pertain to the academics and ex-
tra-curricular activities. Many
blacks feel that relations with
whites in these three areas are
the most aggravating.

William Rhinehart, a junior
politics major, has felt much of
this aggravation since his fresh-
man year and continues to face
the problem. He came to Wash-
ington and Lee looking for a
good, small liberal arts: college.
He found that, and more. “It
was like coming from open
minds to closed ones,” he said.
“I found that a lot of whites had
problems dealing with black peo-
ple.” With the help of friends
and moving out of the dorms,
Rhinehart learned to adapt and
to confront what he calls
“racism.” “People make you feel
inferior sometimes because. of
your color and you feel you have
to prove yourself” he said, and
felt this is one reason why black
freshmen don’t do too well in the
first semester. “Some whites
think that all blacks are the
same... they think they all act
the same like they do on TV.”
He points out that black students
are more diverse geographically
than whites here.

Senior Bryan Johnson felt
that his freshman years changed
his perception of the college.
Coming from a predominantly
white neighborhood and prep
school, Johnson says he looked
at people as individuals before
coming here. Yet, when he con-
sistently saw and heard himself
referred to as a certain race and
became a “black” student, not a
student, “I started treating them
the same way,” he said.
Consequently, he felt that he
had to prove himself as a student
and as a black man.

Both students’ undesired
need to prove themselves still
occurs in the form of stereotypes
of blacks by whites. Many agree
that one of the basic reasons
they exist on campus is because
many white have never dealt
with blacks as equals, and gener-
alizations like stereotypes help
some to compensate or under-
stand. Senior head dormitory
counselor Bob Tomaso expres-
sed, “I think there is a good
number of whites here who
never had to deal with blacks or
when they did they [blacks] were
in an inferior position like a maid
or butler.” He explains his un-

derstanding of blacks in that his
best friend, when he was quite
younger, was black. Psycholo-
gist James Worth commented
that the lack of awareness on
whites’ part causes an awkward-
ness around blacks. In turn, this
leads to an inadvertant discrimi-
nation. This inadvertent discrimi-
nation increases the lack ofecom-
munication among both races for
various reasons.

Beyond stereotypes and lack
of exposure to blacks as equals,
some attitudes of the student
body and campus organizations
fail to help in race relations.
Several of those interviewed
agreed that student apathy or in-
difference inhibits black and
white relations. As senior Wesley
Payne stated, “A lot of people
look at it [race relations, black
problems] and say ‘It’s not my
problem, why should I rock the
boat?’.” Sociology professor Ken
White explained, “It’s hard for
many to understand blacks and
their problems here because it’s
not critical to their own exis-
tence, and no matter how much
sympathy is generated, there is
no vested interest.” Sophomore
Glen Lemmon explained the
apathy as follows: “Unfortunate-
ly, there is a faceless white ma-
jority. . . they come to school,
probably join a fraternity, they
go to classes, select a major,
they don’t join any clubs, the fra-
ternity is the only tie they have,
and that isn’t very strong to
them, other than when they're
drunk on Friday and Saturday
night. The only thing they’re
looking for is a good GPA, a di-
ploma and a recommendation
for the [graduate] school or job
of their choice. It’s sick, but it’s
true.” Associate Dean Pam
Simpson commented, “The pro-
blem with a lot of white students
is that the say they’re treating
everyone equal, and yet, in fact,
they are ignoring black students
and they [white students] think if
you're ignoring them, you're not
hurting them.” She stated fur-
ther that white students are un-
aware of how black students per-
ceive themselves being ignored.
That is, they also see their con-
cerns and problems being ig-
nored; too. Journalism professor
Robert deMaria felt there is more
pressure to excel and less
idealism today than when he
was going to school. “There
seems to be more cynicism, but I
can’t blame the parents because
they’re from my generation, and
I really can’t blame the students.
. . but I think the problem needs
to be solved at home.”

In regards to organizations,
Johnson said that difficulties in
race relations occur because
most groups are devoid of
blacks, which makes it harder for
them to view black opinions.
This generates a process of in-
advertent discrimination which
makes an organization seem rac-

 

 

ist to blacks. In turn, they don’t
join the group and its perception
of blacks stays low or at zero. As
a result, the entire process starts
over because once again the or-
ganization has no experience
with black students and seems
racist to them. Many view this as
the key reason why some blacks
can’t or don’t join fraternities.
Black students soon develop a
hatred or indifference to frater-
nities or clubs. “It’s like hitting
your head against a brick wall. . .
most blacks don’t want to have
to face discrimination just to be
apart of something... the price
for getting involved is some form
of harassment.” A hatred or ani-
mosity also develops in the form
best described as “if they don’t
want to associate with our kind,
why should we bother with
them.” Lemmon felt that this is
detrimental to both races be-
cause it only maintains a gap of
communication. Often the black
student feels indifferent to other
blacks, who should act a certain
way to him as a sign of his race.
That is, if a black associates and
adapts the same habits of whites,
he is labeled an “uncle tom” or
some other derogatory remark.
Lemmon felt that his negative
attitude arises when blacks
refuse to assimilate, which is
stressed at W&L. “Blacks want
to maintain their identity and at-
tend the university, but the em-
phasis on assimilation causes
problems for them,” he said.

The Student Association for
Black Unity (SABU) has its share
of problems, too. Designed as a
support group and social gather-
ing for black students, SABU
faces problems of communica-
tion with the W&L community,
social atmosphere and what Fi-
nancial Aid/Minority Affairs Di-
rector John DeCourcy calls
“",.to0 many generals and not
enough soldiers.” Members ad-
mit their faults in leadership and
organization, but according to
Rhinehart, “When we want to
try something that requries a
group effort; we usually put
aside our personal problems.”
SABU has constantly been ac-
cused of acting as a separatist
group, “Because we don’t inter-
mingle in the mainstream of
campus life; we only deal with
the academic sphere,” quoted
Payne who insists he’s heard the
argument as least a hundred
times. He argued many blacks
participate in intramural sports,
hold open house at SABU, in-
vite whites to parties, and their
location compared to fraternities
is much closer to the university.

There are other problems in
race relations which concern the
faculty and administration. One
of the largest problems is the dif-
ficulty in minority recruiting.
Everyone interviewed agreed
that there is a definite need to
recruit more blacks in order to
alleviate some of the racial ten-

“It’s sick, but it’s

sion by making blacks feel less
like a minority or like they are
being ignored. Payne felt that
more recruiting is good, but
there needs to be some kind of
cultural interest for blacks once
they get here. The reason for the
shortage of blacks is they many
choose large ivy-league colleges
or other colleges which have a
more urban area, according to
DeCourcy. A problem with the
faculty is some form of inadver-
tent discrimination, which Simp-
son said comes from, “...the
burden of cultrual baggage that
everyone has and growing up in
a society like ours means that
you have certain assumptions
about people. They’re probably
unconscious, nevertheless, we
carry them.” Several black
students interviewed have re-
ported incidents of racism from
some faculty members. An ob-
vious problem mentioned was
the lack of black faculty. mem-
bers. Many felt black faculty
members would make blacks feel
more comfortable with the ad-
ministration and the faculty in
general. Simpson explained the
problem in acquiring blacks as
professors as a general shortage
and a high demand for them.

What are some solutions to
these pressing issues? Among
the various suggestions offered
there were several which many
agreed and disagreed on for
numerous reasons.

One of them was coeducation
next year. Some, like Tomaso,
feel that coeducation will help
the situation. Most believed
that it will improve communica-
tion and reduce apathy. “It will
make it a lot easier socially for
blacks because attitudes and
people are gonna change,” said
Tomaso. White believes that co-

 

 

 

 

Seniors Wesley Payne and Terry McWhorter discuss a few views on race relations.

education will bring more diver-
sity and more responsiveness
and interest in the classroom dis-
cussions. “I do realize that many
[women] are coming from the
same background as the guys,
but those that rejected the school
because it wasn’t coed, and saw
that as limiting, will bring a cer-
tain social and intellectual life to
different aspects of the campus,
which will, | hope, help the mi-
nority problems,” he said. Worth
feels that the opportunity of
change itself gives blacks a
chance to push for changes
which will be enhanced by the
fact of women on campus who
will also be causing changes.
Others, however, didn’t know
or didn’t think the addition of
women will help the problem of
race relations. Johnson said that
the change will only put blacks
lower on the “totem pole” and
felt it will be harder and easier for
black women than for black
men. “Guys generally speak to
women and the women won't
have too much trouble socially,
but it will be harder because

they're black and leadership po- |

sitions won't be all that open to
them,” he said.

An increase in minority re-
cruiting was another popular sol-
ution offered basically because it
would ease a lot of social tension
and give blacks more reasons to
participate.

According to deMaria, this
would definitely help race rela-
tions. “We need more minority
students who are willing to risk
their reputation and put their
heads on the chopping block,”
he stated. Tomaso agreed in his
statement that, “All it takes is
one or two guys to turn some
heads and give white students a
black-role model to respect.”
Some felt that SABU needs to
Participate more in campus acti-
vities in order to give whites bet-
ter opinions of blacks’ concern.
Sophomore Mike Webb com-
mented that, “Times have
changed and SABU hasn’t and
they definitely need to in order
to get something done.” Several
agreed with Webb’s statement.
“SABU also needs to be a stepp-
ing stone for black students to
get into organizations,” stated
DeCourcy.

Other suggestions offered in-
cluded increased publicity to mi-
norities. Rhinehart advised
increasing mailing to minority

 

students and teachers. Simpson
said that the university should
and may look into the Colgate
Data Base, which can help the
university select certain target
groups for publicity and increase
its potential for acquiring black
faculty. “I think if the university
brought in a qualified black,
which I’m sure they wouldn’t
have any trouble finding, it
would help a great deal, espec-
ially a guy who could teach in
the C-school [Commerce
School].”

A black student-control ad-
hoc member (which means a
non-voting member that gives
advice) was acknowledged by
Rhinehart and Tomaso as good
way to ease black apprehension
towards student organizations
like the Executive Committee.
Others felt that organizations,
SABU, and blacks need to strive
to find a common ground and
stop being judgemental of the
other. “I think it was very hypo-
critical of The Phi to run that
editorial (in May 16th issue) tell-
ing everybody else they needed
to work on the problems of
blacks and whites at W&L when
they have done very little to
help, if not very little, they have
hurt the situation” stated To-
maso. Webb and Lemmon ex-
plained that organizations’ struc-
ture and content usually changes
sometimes and with that more
opportunity for minorities may
arise, and they need to be taken.
They couldn’t agree on who suf-
fers the most when a minority is
refused admission into a group,
but both felt in the end, the
school suffers.

Although there were more
suggestions offered, the pre-
ceding appeared to be the most
plausible. It is important to re-
member, however, that none of
these solutions are new, they just
haven't been discussed openly
for the public. After all, the stu-
dent body is what makes the uni-
versity function and should be
made aware of its problems. The
purpose of this article was to
simply discuss and present some
issues and solutions to the pro-
blem of race relations on the
campus. | feel they must be re-
solved soon before the university
loses all of its appeal to minor-
ities. How do I know it’s losing its
appeal? It lost its appeal to me
and yes, | am a minority.

words of Warner wisdom

From Staff Reports

 

Lawyers need to develop perspec-
tive — something they can’t learn at
law school — U.S. Sen. John W. War-
ner, R-Va., told 128 Wa.hington and
Lee Law School graduates Sunday.

When he recommends lawyers for
federal judgeships, Warner said, he
looks for those with three character-
istics integrity, resilience and

perspective.

Warner, a 1949 W&L graduate who
obtained his law degree from the Uni-
versity of Virginia, said the integrity
and resilience can be gained from a

 

W&L education. Perspective, though,
must be learned elsewhere, he add-

ed.

“You have been taught, as was I,
the skills of the profession, the tech-
nical skills that every counselor at
law requires: how to write briefs,
how to research, how to debate, how
to argue a case,”’ Warner said. ““You
have a sound understanding of the le-
gal principles which serve as the
foundation of our society and the
framework of our government.

“That part of perspective you can
be taught. But the larger part of per-
spective you must learn yourself.”

 

“Nice suit’’: Sen. John Warner chats with Arthur Silver, who ran a men’s
clothing store in Lexington when Warner was a student here.

By Cotton Puryear /The Ring-tum Phi

Warner encouraged the graduates
to use their law degrees for more
than making money. As an example,
of the latter, he said a car that
recently swerved in front of him had
‘the license plate, “ISUE4U.”’

“Well, that’s obviously a lawyer’s
automobile, and he’s trying to drum ~
up business. That troubles me,”’ said
Warner, holding up a piece of paper
with the license plate number on it.

“Yes, you have earned the right to
material reward, and you will win
it,”” Warner told the graduates. ‘“‘But
you fail Washington and Lee if that is
your only goal.

“America itself will surely fail in
our quest for the preservation of free-
dom. . . if you, with the finest educa-
tion and proven talent and the per-
spective you have now and will gain,
withhold your full contribution and
pursue ‘ISUE4U.’ ”

Illustrative of the perspective law-
yers need to gain, Warner said, is the
studying he did in preparation for at-
tending the arms control talks. in
Geneva this week with nine other
Senators.

“History is the best of teachers,”’
Warner said. ‘‘It’s the rear-view mir-
ror of life.”

In reviewing the history of pre-
vious negotiations, Warner said he
found an incident in which the
French negotiator, Charles de Tal-
leyrand, was told that the Russian
ambassador to the negotiations had
died.

“T wonder what his motive was?”
Talleyrand asked the messenger who »
brought the news.

“This story reinforces what our

before the trial, Read showed him ‘‘a
photograph and asked me if that was
the man that I had seen in the room.
It seemed pretty clear to me that it
was and I was fairly certain it was.”

Read testified yesterday that he
held a_ pretrial conference with
several of the rape-case witnesses
the day before the trial. Read said
Vawter never saw any mug shots or
viewed a police lineup.

Read told the court his desk was

cluttered with case-related material
during the pretrial conference, which
was attended by the victim, her un-
cle, one of her friends, Vawter,
‘Gilman, Stanford and Steve Best,
another Pika.

Among the items in view, Read
said, were a Lexington’ Police
Department mug-shot book of black
male suspects, pictures of the crime
scene, a floor plan of the fraternity
house, and other pictures and items
he planned to use at the trial.

Read said three of the photos on his
desk were of Tinsley.

Crawford said Vawter’s ‘‘change of
heart’”’ regarding the pre-trial con-

ference and photo identification may
indicate Read knew at the time of the
trial that Vawter’s testimony was
perjured.

If that were the situation, Crawford
contended, Tinsley may have been
denied due process of law.

Crawford, who was not Tinsley’s
attorney at the trial, asked for the
trial transcript for use in preparing
the appeal.

Tinsley’s state Supreme Court ap-
peal was filed May 13. Such an appeal
now would likely be made to the
Virginia Court of Appeals, a newly
created level of the state judicial
system.

Girard seeks to suppress evidence

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

The attorney for Washington and
Lee senior Gene Girard asked yester-
day that certain Western Union
money orders be barred as evidence
in Girard’s upcoming trial on a
charge of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute it.

Lexington lawyer Laurence A.
Mann asked in his motion that any in-
formation concerning Western Union
money orders issued in Girard’s
name between Jan. 1 and May 1 be
suppressed as evidence against him.

Girard was arrested March 1 at the
East Lexington grocery store in con-
nection with a Federal Express
package containing about an ounce of
cocaine that was received there on
that day.

At an April 26 hearing, Lexington
and Rockbridge County law enforce-
ment officers testified they received
a tip Feb. 27 from an anonymous in-
formant that Girard had sent a
money order for $1,453 to Miami. The
officers said they then watched for
Federal Express packages to Lex-

ington from Miami.

Mann’s motion says interception of
telephone or telegraph transmissions
is unlawful under Virginia state law.
It further states that the Com-
monwealth claims its case is based
on information from ‘‘a reliable in-
formant,” not from a wiretap.

The motion says Western Union of-
ficials deny giving information to the

 

Commonwealth in connection with
money orders and that Girard knows
of no other possible source for the in-
formation.

Mann presented his motion before
Circuit Judge George E. Honts III.

Girard, who was not present in the
courtroom yesterday, is scheduled to
be tried June 11 in Rockbridge Cir-
cuit Court.

Is that a tort? One law student seems more enthralled
with a bottle of bubbly than he is with the filibuster on

arms control negotiators are faced
with,’’ Warner said.

The brief interlude about the arms
control negotiations was Warner’s
only foray into politics. He did spend
some time, though, praising his
Washington and Lee education.

“T have taken from this University
a treasury of memories,” said War-
ner, adding that he first thought
about becoming a senator when he
met a classmate’s father, former
U.S. Sen. Willis Robertson.

“I wouldn’t be in the Senate today
had it not been for the privilege of at-
tending this great university and re-

ceiving its education,’’ Warner said.

Introducing Warner, Law School
Dean Frederic L. Kirgis Jr., describ-
ed Warner’s attending the University
of Virginia law school as ‘‘a minor
setback in his career.”’

Warner, who served on _ the
University’s Board of Trustees for 11
years, said he had brought with him
his father’s 1903 Calyx — “‘one of our
most treasured family heirlooms.”’

Encouraging the graduates, War-
ner said, ‘‘I assure you, you will suc-
ceed. If I could do it, you will do it.”’

Zola charged with $160 theft

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Junior William F. Zola was ar-
rested early Tuesday and charged
with stealing a $160 tub of wine from
Spanky’s Delicatessen.

Zola, a 21-year-old from Sudbury,
Mass., is the outgoing president of
Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

Lexington police Sgt. Steven E.
Crowder, the arresting officer, said
in his report that while responding to
a 1 a.m. complaint about noise in
Stonewall Jackson Cemetery, he saw
three males carrying a tub of wine
toward 201$,RandolphStw...._;,

He said in the report that his in-
vestigation revealed that Zola had
taken the items from Spanky’s.
Crowder obtained a warrant and Zola
was arrested shortly after 2 a.m. A
magistrate set bail at $500 but releas-
ed him on his agreement to appear in
court.

The 22 bottles of Almaden Gamay
Rose wine are valued at $160.28. -

Zola’s hearing in Lexington

General District Court is set for June
18. He will appear Tuesday to name
his lawyer.

Petit larceny carries a possible
sentence of up to 12 months in jail, a
fine of up to $1,000, or both.

Other police news this week includ-
ed something that could only happen
in Lexington — the case of the
unidentified flying chair.

You wouldn’t believe it unless it
came from Police Chief L.O. Sutton:

An air conditioning protector at
Domino’s Pizza was broken last week
when a chair was thrown at it from
the apartment of seniors Donald Pal-
mer and George meaner at 25S. Jef-
ferson St,

Palmer and Renee, though, say
they don’t know who hurled the four-
legged projectile.

They have offered, however, to pay
for the damage, which is estimated
at $100.

Also this week, thefts and van-
dalism continued to plague W&L
students. Some recent examples in-
clude:

eSophomore T.J. Finnerty this

The W&L

Independent Union

week reported his Raleigh 10-speed
bicycle taken from in front of Evans
Dining Hall. The silver bicycle with
blue trim is valued at $175.

eA window in the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity house was broken at 1 a.m.
last Thursday when an unknown per-
son threw a six-inch piece of wood
through it. Two potted plants were
broken. Damage of $50 was done to
the room of senior Scott Vanmeter.

eSophomore Marquis Smith report-
ed an equalizer stolen from his car,
which was parked in front of the Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity house. The
left front mirror and the antenna of
the car were broken. The value of the
equalizer is $50 and the other damage
was Said to total $35.

eFreshman Sydney Speer had the
antenna broken off his 1985 Honda
Prelude, Sutton said. The car was
parked in front of the Unviersity
Center. The damage is estimated at
$25.

eJunior Randy Ellis reported the
right windshield and the antenna
broken on his car. The damage is es-
timated at $35.

“We have a good class from a good
university hitting a strong job
market.”

With those words, Associate Dean
of Students Michael A. Cappeto ex-
pressed his optimism for this year’s
graduating class.

Cappeto, also University place-
ment director, mailed a question-
naire to seniors several weeks ago in
which he asked about their plans for
next year. Included were questions
about graduate schools and job offers
as well as a question about plans in
general.

The purpose of the survey was to
“‘get an idea of where seniors were

Liberty Hall:

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A special ceremony at Liberty Hall
marking the 200th anniversary of the
University’s first commencement ex-
ercises will highlight next week’s
graduation events.

Farris P. Hotchkiss, director of
University relations and develop-
ment, described the commemoration
as a “very simple ceremony that will
have two basic purposes.”’

“One, the observation of the 200th
anniversary of W&L’s graduation of
a baccalaureate class, and, two, an
opportunity for the University to give
to each graduating senior a medal-
lion that will mark the occasion,”
Hotchkiss added.

The ceremony, which will take
place Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. at the
Liberty Hall site, begins with a
benediction from John N. Thomas,
former rector of the Board of
Trustees.

Also included are a brief historical
sketch of the school by I. Taylor
Sanders II, University historian, and
a message from University Presi-
dent John D. Wilson.

Medallions then will be handed out
to the seniors, concluding the cere-
mony, which Hotchkiss said will last
about half an hour.

Hotchkiss pointed out that Augusta
Academy and Liberty Hall, which
preceded Washington and Lee, did
have graduating classes prior to 1785.

going,”’ said Cappeto, who added that
only 95 of the 300 surveys he mailed
were returned.

The low rate of response made it
difficult to get an overview of class
plans, Cappeto said.

“With a 30 percent return rate, the
results are not accurate”’ as a reflec
tion of the senior class as a whole, he
explained.

Cappeto said he usually does an ex-
tensive survey of the senior class
every two or three years. This is the
first time he has mailed a survey in
the spring.

Of the students who have returned
surveys, Cappeto said, many are go-
ing to graduate schools, particularly
in the fields of law and medicine.
Others are beginning careers, ‘he
said, noting that the most popular

class,” Hotchkiss said. “It is the
200th anniversary of a commence.
ment ceremony.”

“‘We were the first private school in
the Commonwealth of Virginia to be
chartered and to grant what is today
the baccalaureate degree,’ he
added.

“This will be something mean-
ingful,’’ Hotchkiss said. ‘‘It will be
something this class will be able to
participate in and take away with
them as an important part of their
W&L experience.”’

Other graduation activities include
a baccalaureate service Wednesday
at 11 a.m. in Evans Dining Hall and
the awarding of diplomas to about 300
seniors during the exercises on the
Front Lawn beginning at 11 a.m. next
Thursday, June 6.

The speaker for the baccalaureate
will be the Rev. Peter J. Lee, bishop
coadjutor of the Episcopal Diocese of
Virginia.

Lee, a 1960 graduate of W&L, was
consecrated as a bishop coadjutor in
the Washington Cathedral a year
ago. He previously had served for 14
years as rector of the Chapel of the
Cross in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Following the baccalaureate ser-
vice, the graduating seniors and their
families will be the guests for a
luncheon on the lawn.

After the Liberty Hall ceremony,
the faculty will hold a reception and
dance for the seniors in Evans Dining
Hall.

Thursday’s commencement activi-

Job prospects still ‘strong’

areas are finance, banking, market-
ing and accounting.

It is not unusual for students not to
have jobs at this time, Cappeto said,
and those who don’t have jobs yet
should not be discouraged

“Because of the diversity of our
student body, we can’t expect every-
one in the graduating class to have
jobs now,’’ Cappeto said. ‘People
who look hard over the summer
should have no problem finding one.
Within a month or two, almost every-
one has a job.”’

‘‘Last year was a very good year’’
for job-hunting, Cappeto said, ‘‘and
not much has changed.”

The role the placement office plays
is one of guidance, Cappeto said.
“The thrust of our efforts is to teach
W&L studerts how to find jobs,” he

explained.

The placement office has several
programs throughout the year for
students looking for jobs. These in-
clude a September meeting for stu-
dents interested in applying to law
schools, a resume-writing workshop
and a career symposium.

Preparation is the key to finding a
job, Cappeto said.

“For those who don’t have a job,
they should know how to find one,” he
said. “For those who aren’t motivat
ed, it's time to get off their ass and
get going.”’

Cappeto acknowledges that W&L is
not the ideal school for easy job-
hunting because Lexington is a dif-
ficult place to arrange job inter
views, and many students have to set
up interviews on their own.

New assistant athletic director leads lunch-time aerobics class

It’s noon on a weekday, and one
might expect Washington and Lee

For some, indeed, that might be the
case, but for about 25 faculty and
staff members and spouses, it is far
from it.

Instead, they spend their lunch

W&L in summer has something for everyone...

‘A taste of college life’

 

By STEVE CONNER
Staff Reporter

 

Although Washington and Lee of-
fers no summer college credit
courses for undergraduates, the
University does offer summer pro-
grams from June through August for
nearly every other age group.

A total of 16 programs will be of-
fered this summer on the W&L cam-
pus, ranging from the Summer
Scholars session for rising high
school seniors to an Elderhostel pro-
gram for adults age 60 and older.

W&L has offered the Summer
Scholars program each of the past
four summers. The Summer Schol-
ars program is designed to give ris-
ing high school seniors a taste of col-
lege life, according to Robert P.
Fure, director of summer programs.

A total of 120 boys and girls, chosen
from 300 applicants, representing 29
different states will participate in
this summer’s program.

From June 30 to July 26, these high’

school seniors will take courses rang-
ing from English to history to sociolo-
gy. All courses will be taught by 19
members of the W&L faculty.

The average SAT score among the
Summer Scholars students is 1,200
and the majority of the students were
in the top 10 percent of their classes,
Fure said.

The price for each Summer Schol-
ar participant is $1,200. The fee in-
cludes room and board (the students
live in Graham-Lees Dormitory).

The Elderhostel program offers
college courses for people age 60 and
older. A total of 50 will participate in
this summer’s program.

Elderhostel will be divided into
three week-long sessions, with the
first session scheduled to start June
23 and end June 29.

The first Elderhostel session will
offer courses ranging from Third
World politics to the Civil War to
modern art.

The other two sessions will run
from July 21-27 and from July 28-
Aug. 3. Both of those sessions will be
conducted at the Washington and Lee
School of Law, where law professors
will lecture about income taxes,
criminal law, consumer protection
and mass media law.

Fure said many of the Elderhostel

students are retired executives or
teachers, many of whom want to
keep learning new things and ideas.

“The faculty loves teaching these
senior students,” Fure said. ‘‘They
have much to offer.”

The fee for the program is $195.
This includes meals and housing in
the Woods Creek Apartments.

A two-week program is offered for
business executives. About 15 ex-
ecutives from such major companies
as IBM, AT&T and Arco will par-
ticipate in the Institute for Ex-
ecutives, which will take place on the
campus from June 16-28.

The theme of the program is bus-
iness ethics. The total fee for the pro-
gram is $3,000.

The W&L Alumni College Program
will offer this year for the first time a
college program in England. The
tour is offered to W&L alumni and
their families. A total of 36 people
will participate in this year’s sum-
mer sessions.

The topics for the four sessions
are: “Great Writers, Etc.,’’ from
June 30-July 6, ‘Society and Health,”
from July 7-13, ‘‘Classical Athens,”
from July 14-20, and ‘‘Alumni College
Abroad: England,”’ from Aug. 6-23.

The fee for campus courses at W&L
is $400 and $2,200 for the England
course.

A variety of athletic camps are of-
fered during the summer on the cam-
pus. All camps and clinics are coach-
ed by members of the W&L coaching
staff.

There is an aquatics camp in June,
a lacrosse camp in July and three
basketball camps during the sum-
mer. A soccer day camp also is of-
fered.

The camps last for one week and
are open to high school students in
general.

Fure said about 50-100 youth par-
ticipate in each athletic program.
The fee for each camp ranges from
$175 to $225, including meals and
room and board.

ly on the campus for the benefit of

of Rankin’s workout have ranged
from ‘‘fun’’ to ‘‘physically challeng-
ing’’ to “‘agony.”’

Rankin said that the course was not
originally her idea, but rather that
she took it over from Athletic Direc-
tor William D. McHenry and head
football coach Gary R. Fallon. The
program initially consisted of a rota-
tion of swimming, weight training
and aerobic dance, but time con-
straints made doing justice to the dif-
ferent workouts difficult, Rankin ex-
plained.

Aerobic dance is helpful in reach-
ing the different target areas of
fitness, Rankin said. The workouts
are designed to increase the strength
of the cardiovascular system as well
as overall strength and endurance.
Emphasis also is placed on flexibility
exercises, some balance activities
and just plain basic coordination.

Rankin started the program by cir-
culating a letter to all faculty and
staff members. She said the response
was surprising.

‘“‘We were expecting 10 to 15 people
at the most, and the first day we had
35,” Rankin said. Not all of those
original 35 have stayed with the pro-
gram; in fact, nine left after the first
session. On the other hand, nine more
have enrolled since the course began.

The participants in the program
seem to be there for different
reasons. Journalism Professor
Robert J. de Maria said his motiva-
tion was the realization that he was
out of shape.

“All those desserts, pastas and
breads build up, and I had really let
myself go to hell,’’ he added.

The course was tough going at first
because of the usual aches and pains,
said de Maria, adding, ‘I was sore in
muscles I never even knew I had.”’

Reference librarian Yolanda War-
ren signed up for Rankin’s course
because its meeting time is more
convenient than the course she was
taking in Lexington. Warren said
that although she already was in fair-
ly good shape, she still benefits from
the course by putting more effort into
each individual exercise.

Robert Fure, director of summer
programs for W&L, has a twofold
reason for taking part in the pro-
gram. First of all, he wants to gain
the physical benefits. Secondly, Fure
said, he enjoys getting to know new
members of the W&L staff and saw
the aerobics course as a chance to get
to know Rankin, who just began her
duties this spring.

Fure said he has been impressed
with the job Rankin has done with the
aerobics class. ‘‘She puts to rest any
assumption that men have more
physical stamina than women,” he
added.

The program is designed to be
challenging to people at all levels of
physical fitness, Rankin said.

Before beginning the program,
each participant figured his heart
rate and used this as a basis for his
progress in the course. This way,
each participant can do as much or
as little as it takes to work on
strengthening his heart rate.

Many of the participants are doing
other workouts in addition to the
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
aerobic sessions, Rankin said. Some
are walking or jogging, others are
swimming and a few are lifting
weights with Fallon.

A course similar to this one is plan-
ned to be offered to the under-
graduate students next year, in addi-
tion to Coach Norman F. Lord’s
aerobic running class.

No chance

....When some people finally
started to watch the tennis at the
TIME national championships, they had a
OUT good time and were excited about
“**. the progress the W&L team
By Mike members were making. And while
Stachura

 

more often than not the wins were
upsets, there was a chance, for ex-

' : ample, that David McLeod could
beat the No. 1-ranked singles player in the nation.

And why was there such a chance? Because W&L was competing
in a league of similar foes. Presumably, none of the tennis players
at the national championhips were on athletic scholarships.

The Washington and Lee lacrosse team cannot beat Johns Hop-
kins, and there is no chance that W&L can beat Johns Hopkins. That
inequity illustrates the need for change in the lacrosse program.

W&L striving to compete in Division I is a silly idea. We are now
and will continue to be out of our league ad infinitum in Division I. A
five-minute glance at ESPN’s coverage of the recent Division I
championship will give any doubters enough fuel for reconsidera-
tion.

To continue to compete in Division I is a logical absurdity. Moving
to Division III is a logical decision. Let’s face it. W&L is a Division
III institution. Having one sport buck the institution’s philosophy is
not necessary and doesn’t make sense.

Well, then, why does W&L compete in Division I lacrosse? In 1971,
the decision to play in Division I made sense essentially because
there was no difference between Division I and Division III teams,
save in ability level. In 1971, W&L was competitive with those teams
that decided to compete in Division I. In 1985, W&L is not com-
petitive in Division I.

All right, then, why did W&L choose to remain in Division I? My
educated guess is that when a team vote is split down the middle,
you feel it would be unfair to permanently smite that many young
men. As well, the permanence of a move to D-III is a scary thought
to many. And that type of thinking is unfortunate.

Staying in Division I is keeping a dream alive. A bad dream. To
me, it is not any fun to lose. It does not make me any better to lose
to North Carolina 19-5 than it does to lose to Roanoke 20-6, or UMBC
9-6, for that matter. Losing is not attractive (that’s as in recruiting),
either. No one wants to play for a loser, be he in Division I or Divi-
sion III.

Sure, W&L can play in Division I. There are scads of discount D-I
programs out there. But a 10-1 season against Virginia Techs
doesn’t impress me. Simply put, with the way things are now at
W&L, with no changes in the administration’s attitude toward
lacrosse, success in Division I means a ho-hum schedule.

It has been said that the University does not have a stake in pro-
ducing national champions. Perhaps not. But no one can dispute the
achievements of the national championship swim team or tennis
team. I submit that the W&L lacrossers have been deprived of that
same Satisfaction, simply by being placed out of their league.

I did not enjoy watching lacrosse this season. But then I don’t like
human sacrifice, either. It is not fun to watch your peers go into bat-
tle, for all intents and purposes unarmed.

It is not, by any means, a sign of cowardice to admit that you
don’t belong anymore. It is a sign of unnecessary stubornness to
stay somewhere you don’t belong...

   

 

....AS we head down the Colonnade one final time in 1984-85, I
salute all the athletes this year. Other than providing me with
something to do for the last nine months; you gentlemen have shown
anyone who took the time to notice that athletics — when ‘they ar@
what they should be — are people striving to reach their potential,
and if they are successful, reaching it. Even if they don’t, they go on
undaunted. I applaud your efforts, whether they be on the practice
field or in the championship game, because they have been always
efforts pushed to the utmost of your abilities. And in the end,
regardless of any scoreboard or stopwatch, that iswhere champions
are made...

....1’ll look forward to this nonsense again next year. In the mean-
time, enjoy your summer and remember that they have yet to name
the ladies teams for next year. Sure, they can make the decision to
go coed, but when it comes to details...

‘Active’ women interested in sports program

 

By DAVE NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Seventy-five women who will at-
tend Washington and Lee next year
are either very interested in or are
considering participation in the W&L
athletic program, according to assis-
tant athletic director Cynda Rankin.

The athletic department gathered
this information when surveyed wo-
men accepted for the 1985-86 acade-
mic year. The athletic department
has processed only the responses of
women who have confirmed their ac-
ceptances.

The survey was used to determine
the athletic interests of the women

who will attend W&L next year. Ran-
kin stated that although a woman my
have indicated an interest on her sur-
vey it does not necessarily mean that
she will participate in the athletic
program.

Referring to the women in next
year’s freshman class, Rankin said,
“They seem to be very active in
athletics, student government, dra-
ma and music. We [the athletic de-
partment] will be competing for their
time.”

Rankin further stated that if a
woman expressed interest on her sur-
vey, it does not imply that she has a
background in that sport.

Next year, Washington and Lee
will field women’s teams in cross

Fall schedules boast
a few new opponents

 

From Staff Reports

 

A few new faces dot the proposed
schedules for next fall’s football, soc-
cer and cross country seasons.

The football team jumps right into
its ODAC schedule with its season
opener on Sept. 14 at Emory and
Henry. The nine-game season in-
cludes two changes from last year’s
list. Pennsylvania’s Ursinus will be
the site for a Nov. 9 contest. It will be
the first meeting between the two
teams.

The season concludes with a home
game against Washington University
(St. Louis). It will be the 17th
meeting of the two institutions. The
last meeting was in 1974.

The soccer schedule has four dif-
ferent opponents from the 1984
season. The new foes include season-
opener Shenandoah, North Carolina
Wesleyan, Liberty Baptist and
the University of the South.

The cross country schedule is
much the same as the 1984 edition.
The season includes the Virginia
State Divisions II and III meet, which
will be held at W&L.

Here dre the™schediles” for the

three sports. (the water polo schedule
was not available ):

country, golf, tennis and swimming
and diving. These five teams were
selected because of the current facili-
ties available and the makeup of the
W&L coaching staff as well as the
interests of theincoming women.

Rankin added that these sports are
individual team sports that will allow
women athletes not only to partici-
pate but also to accomplish indivi-
dual goals despite the level of compe-
tition or number of participants in
the program.

“The sports that were chosen ap-
pear to have been excellent choices,”
Rankin said. Of those responding to
the survey, 37 women said they are
interested in participating in the ten-
nis program, 33 in swimming and
diving, 18 in golf and 17 in cross coun-

 

try.

The survey provided the initial step
in the recruiting of women athletes.
Based on survey responses, W&L
coaches have written or called those
who indicated an interest on their
survey.

The athletic department currently
is scheduling matches and meets for
next year’s women’s varsity pro-
grams. Tennis and swimming and
diving will compete in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference. Cross coun-
try and golf will not.

The survey also asked the women
to express interest concerning possi-
ble future women’s programs so that
the athletic department may best
plan the course of women’s athletics
at Washington and Lee.

Letterman:
He’s just so

Su-sussudio

By The Associated Press

 

 

BURBANK, Calif. — David Letter-
man, a wizard of humor operating in
the witching hour, says he has
something of a cult following.

Letterman is found in the after-
midnight television void usually fill-
ed with such movies as “The Attack
of the Killer Tomatoes,” bizarre used
car salesmen and ads for all those
golden-oldie records you can’t buy at
your local store.

“Late Night With David Letter-
man,” like ‘‘The Tonight Show”’ that
precedes it on NBC, is something of a
catch-all, You never know who's go-
ing to show up or what’s about to hap-
pen.

In an interview during the show’s
first visit to NBC’s Burbank studios
(the show was originated from New
York since it went on the air in
February 1982), Letterman said his
philosophy is, ‘‘Let’s not take things
too seriously.”

The tall, lanky comedian, wearing
shorts, a University of Michigan T-
shirt and a Detroit Tigers’ cap, add-
ed, ‘‘We’re just trying to have a good
time. There are places for thought-
provoking material, but not on our
show. Maybe ‘Nightline.’ It’s really
frivolous. It’s a silly show. And by
design.”

An estimated 5 million people tune
in to the show every Monday through
Friday. ‘‘I think a lot of it is cult,”
Letterman said, ‘‘But cult brings to
mind a curious kind of people living
in tents outside of Barstow. We have
a good cross-section of people. Not
many high school people, because it’s
too late. In the beginning we didn’t

get a lot of older people, either, but
now we are getting more older peo-
ple.”

“Late Night,’’ like Carson’s show,
is taped in the early evening for
broadcast later. Letterman laughs at
the thought of trying to go live as
“Saturday Night Live’’ does.

‘‘In New York at that time of night
you'd get people trying to get warm,”
he said. ‘‘Or looking for a place to re-
load their weapons.”

Until he began ‘‘Late Night,” Let-
terman had lived in Los Angeles.

‘We could have done the show out
here.”’ he said.

But, he explained, ‘I think NBC
liked the idea of using its facilities in
New York and contrasting it with
‘The Tonight Show’ from Los
Angeles.”’

‘Just One of the Guys’

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
“The Back Page”’ Editor

 

What happens when a_ budding
young journalist loses the local
newswriting contest because she’s
young, attractive and female? She
does what every young, attractive
budding female journalist does — she
dresses up like a guy and decides to
write a story about her experiences.

There you have the plot for ‘‘Just
One of the Guys,” the story of Terri
Griffith, a young girl who dresses up

in her younger brother’s clothes to
prove to the world that she has what
it takes to be a reporter.

Along the way she discovers that
her little charade is not going to be
the piece of cake she thought it would
be. She gets confronted by the terrors
of the boys locker room, the proposi-
tion of playing on the ‘‘skins”’ side of
a basketball game and the no-holds-
barred lust of a brunette Madonna
dress-alike who wants nothing more
than to have her way with Terri's
male alter-ego.

Things only get worse from there.

Letterman originally was sum-
moned here to talk to the NBC af-
filiates meeting, but Brandon Tar-
tikoff, president of NBC Entertain-
ment, suggested that Letterman do
his show from Burbank for a week.

“It’s a different feeling out here,”
he said. ‘‘The first important show I
ever did came out of here. You’re
driving to work on the Ventura
Freeway and you get a shot of
adrenaline just thinking about it. For
me, that’s a real boot. I have nothing
but pleasant memories about work-
ing here.”’

Letterman was often mentioned in
1980 as a possible successor to
Johnny Carson as host of “The
Tonight Show.”’ That was at the time
when Carson could not reach an

agreement for a new contract with
Fred Silverman, then president of
NBC. It was rumored that Carson
might go to ABC. Instead, Carson
signed a new contract.

It was shortly afterward that Let-
terman did his short-lived morning
show for NBC. After its failure, pro-
blems began to develop with ‘‘Tom-
orrow.”’ The show, originally an in-
terview show with Tom Snyder, was
expanded to 90 minutes and enter-
tainment elements were added. But
it wasn’t working.

“Grant Tinker said we don’t need
this aggravation with ‘Tomorrow’
and said let’s put David Letterman

why she’s cut her hair off and why all
of a sudden she doesn’t have any time
to spend with him.

Meanwhile, Terri starts to fall for
Rick, the guy she becomes friends
with while she’s dressed as a guy. On-
ly problem is that she persuades him
to get a date for the prom, leaving
Terri to take her best friend Denise to
the prom.

Sound confusing? It’s not really.
More than anything, this movie
comes across as sort of a teen flick
remake of ‘Tootsie’ but doesn’t
come close to being as good.

“Just One of the Guys”’ is mildly
entertaining but if your money is run-
ning tight, save your $3.50 and go see
“Beverly Hills Cop” when it returns
to the State Theatre on Friday.

Plans underway for

people in the dancer's ring that
weren't supposed to be there, and.
that hampers us greatly,’’ Whann

said. ;

While the dance raises most of its,
money by pledges made to dancers,
the committee is looking into other‘
ways to raise money for the MDA.»
Last year an additional $6,291 was
raised through beer sales at the’
dance, fraternity contributions and,
faculty pie throws.

Whann said one fundraising event
he sees becoming even more impor-
tant are ‘‘slave auctions’’ held at the
local women’s colleges. Whann ex-*
plained that at a slave auction, W&L +
students are ‘‘sold’’ to the highest
bidder and the slave performs acts of '
“mutually agreed servitude”’ for the +
highest bidder. ;

The actual date of the dance has
been a problem in past years. ‘‘For '
the past two years, we've held the ,
dance when two women’s colleges
have been on vacation,’ James said,
“and that cuts into the number of
dancers as well as the number of
spectators.” :

The 1986 Superdance has been set
for Jan. 24-26.

Whann said he thinks the Super-
dance will get a boost in participation
from the women who will begin atten
ding W&L this fail. :

“These young women will be sear
ching for activities to participate in
next year,’’ Whann said, ‘‘and we feel
we provide a really positive at- *
mosphere for people to work in. We
have fun, but we also raise money for
avery deserving group.”

The Washington and Lee Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance Committee
has already begun plans for next
year’s event, hoping to make it the
most successful in the weekend’s
seven-year history.

Superdance co-chairmen Paul
James and Sandy Whann said a ten-
tative goal of $30,000 has been set for
the 1986 Superdance.

Whann said the fundraising goal is
used as a psychological boost and the
most important thing is the amount
actually donated to the Muscular
Dystrophy Association. Last year’s
30-hour dance marathon raised
$33,213, and after expenses about
$20,000 went to the MDA.

The Superdance Steering Commit-
tee has begun work now, hoping to
find new ways to run the dance so
more money can be given to the
MDA, Whann said.

“What we’re doing is looking at
last year’s dance and dissecting it,”
he said.

Whann noted that the positive
aspects of the dance included in-
creased support from the W&L com-
munity over the past year, as well as
added support from fraternities and
the local women’s colleges.

A real effort is going to be made to
cut expenses, Whann said, but not at
the expense of quality.

A few problems with security were
the only negative aspects that Whann
saw from last year’s dance. ‘‘We had

Presently we have 45 brothers. We

we are “a close, but diverse

from All-Americans (2) to Phi

life. We have the largest house on
