Thirteen sophomores who planned
to join Kappa Sigma last year have
now taken residence in Gaines Hall,
far from their now-empty fraternity
house in Davidson Park.

Kappa Sigma fraternity (Mu Chap-
ter) had its charter revoked by Kappa
Sigma National on July 13, 2007.
This decision came after investiga-

. tion of two separate hazing incidents,
one occurring in 2004 and another
earlier this year. It will no longer be
a recognized fraternity at Washington
and Lee University for the 2007-2008
academic year, according to a press
release from Director of Campus Ac-
tivities, Jason Rodocker.

Former President of Kappa Sigma
George Hunter said, “We cared about
Mu Chapter. That was always what
was most important to us. It will al-
ways be what is most important to us.
It is a shame that we cannot carry on
with the backing of Kappa Sigma.”

. When allegations of hazing viola-
tions surfaced in Feb. 2007, Kappa
Sigma had already been placed on
probation, or trusteeship, for similar
violations committed earlier in 2004.

“Mu Chapter had not worked their
way off trusteeship, and members
knew that Kappa Sigma National
and W&L both have zero tolerance
policies on hazing, including speciﬁc
written explanations of what is haz-
ing,” Rodocker said.

In 2004, allegations of hazing vio-
lations were reported directly to Na-
tionals. At that time, Nationals con-

. ducted an investigation and found that
the alleged violations were indeed
committed and placed Mu Chapter on
probation.

In 2007, the new charges were
heard and deliberated upon by the
lnterfratemity Council (IFC), an orga-
nization which is composed entirely
of W&L fraternity men. After deter-
mining that Mu Chapter had violated
rules against a speciﬁc type of haz-
ing, members of the IFC assigned the

“We never found out the relationship to our chapter

of the person who made the allegations or the alle-
gations themselves. We heard them through the IF C,

like a game of telephone. ’

GEORGE HUNTER, former Kappa Sigma president

penalty of critical probation. W&L’s
Student Affairs Committee (SAC),
composed of half student leaders
and half faculty and staff, echoed
the IFC’s decision.

While Hunter admitted that the
chapter had been guilty of hazing,
he argued that signiﬁcant discrepan-
cies surfaced during the IFC trial.

“We did not haze in a man-
ner that was absolutely consistent
with the questions that were being
asked,” he said. “We never found
out the relationship to our chapter of
the person who made the allegations
or the allegations themselves. We
heard them through the IFC, like a
game of telephone.”

After critical probation was as-
signed, Kappa Sigma National de-
cided to conduct its own investiga-
tion. Rodocker said, “During that
process, W&L ofﬁcials consistently
urged Kappa Sigma National not to
suspend Mu Chapter’s charter and
that the critical probation penalty
imposed by the IFC was sufficient.”

However, Nationals proceeded
under its own authority and visited
Mu Chapter for a formal investiga-
tion in May consisting of a member-
ship review.

“We were unequivocally open
with the university and with Nation-
als about the process, the details
of the hazing and exactly what the
hazing consisted of,” Hunter said.
“However, they required as part of
their membership review not only
information about the hazing, which
we proffered in ﬁlll, but exactly

which brothers took part in the haz-
ing.”

Because Nationals viewed
the chapter’s response during the
membership review as uncoop-
erative, the chapter was asked to
attend a hearing with the Kappa
Sigma National Supreme Execu-
tive Committee this summer. Sev-
eral Mu Chapter members attended
the conference, which was held in
Miami, Fla.

At the conference, Nationals
decided to revoke Mu Chapter’s
charter on grounds of hazing vio-
lations, lack of cooperation during
formal investigation and member-
ship review and existing probation-
ary status.

In retrospect, Hunter said he
believes he and his brothers made
the right choice in taking the pun-
ishment as a house. He said, “It
was mistakes we had all made. I
thought it was strong of all of us to
not better our own positions at the
expense of anyone else.”

Nationals and W&L want to
bring Kappa Sigma back but will
likely wait until all current mem-
bers have graduated, said Rodock-
er’s press release.

Matthew Bott, Kappa Sigma
National’s Assistant Executive Di-
rector, said, “We’ve been on cam-
pus there for over 100 years. We
know we’ll be successful when we
retum.”

Based on IFC trials from previ-
ous years, Womom believes that
the Greek system is moving in the

right direction.

Although losing Kappa Sigma
is certainly not positive for W&L,
Rodocker said valuable lessons, such
as developing a healthy relationship
with a Greek house’s Nationals and
revamping New Member Education
to be a positive experience, can be
drawn from this event.

He said, “The perception that
bonds of brotherhood are formed
through group suffering is incor-
rect. Several healthy methods exist
for developing brotherhood that is
pure and productive - hazing is not
one of them.”

Princeton Review
study labels W&L
as a party culture
lacking diversity

Bywes 0’DeIl
STAFF WRITER

The Princeton Review (TPR), a New
York-based test preparation company, re-
cently released its latest round of college
rankings in its annual publication, “The Best
366 Colleges”.

In it, TPR surveys about 325 college stu-
dents at each of the 366 campuses and asks
them about their college experience in terms
of academics, social life and student body.

The results are then used to rank these in-
stitutions in 62 separate categories.

This year, W&L ranked ﬁrst in the cat-
egory “lots of hard liquor,” second in both
“little race/class interaction” and “major
frat/srat scene,” fourth in both “homoge-
neous student population,” and “lots of
beer,” and ninth in “altemative lifestyle not
an altemative” (measuring acceptance of the
gay community).

Several members of faculty and adminis-
tration ﬁnd fault with this methodology.

“The Princeton Review thrives on cari-
cature,” said University President Kenneth
Ruscio.

“It proﬁles institutions based on selective
or incomplete or inaccurate data. As a result,
some features of campus and academic life
at particular colleges—not just Washing-
ton and Lee-—get exaggerated or placed in
a context that aligns only roughly with the
more complex reality.”

Associate Dean of Students Tammy
Futrell called TPR’s methodology “ﬂawed”
and said that W&L had “suffered some un-

fair ratings at its hands, and our diversity rat-
ing is no different.”

She pointed to the success of Black
Greek Letter Organizations and increased
multicultural student enrollment and reten-
tion as clear evidence of progress.

The negative stereotype these rankings
breed is a plague to the Admissions Ofﬁce.

As far back as 2004, the oﬂice published
a scathing brochure calling TPR “disreputa-
ble and commercially driven” and attacking
its methodology as “so suspect that it ren-
ders [survey results] meaningless.”

According to Associate Dean of Admis-
sions Jonathan Webster, “little is said about
the high-quality programs and academics we
have, and we’re made out to be some sort
of anti-intellectual caricature of ourselves.
It certainly doesn’t help us in recruiting stu-
dents. . .I admit I sometimes wonder how
prospective employers and graduate school
admission ofﬁcers regard us and our alumni
on seeing that sort of stuff in print.”

rankings claiming them “to be representative
of the W&L experience.”

When asked how TPR affects the admissions
process, Kelly replied “No comment. Our mis-
sion is to simply and unabashedly provide infor-
mation [the prospective student] won’t get from
the W&L brochure and the W&L website.”

She defended the survey’s methodology while
admitting it is a “self-selecting opinion poll.” A
valid, unique W&L e-mail address is required to
complete the W&L survey and the respondent
must reply to a validation email at the end of the
process. This prevents one or two students from

D repeatedly voting and skewing the results.

Similarly, she pointed to the satisfaction_ of
students themselves as evidence that the process
is fair. At the end of every survey, students are
given a chance to rate the previous year’s pro-
ﬁle of their college; “nationally, 81% rate them
‘very’ or ‘extremely accurate’,” she said.

Kelly said TPR is a “big fan of W&L,” and
it wants to provide an accurate snapshot of cam-
pus culture to help prospective students decide if
it’s “the right ﬁt.”

Student Recruitment Committee tour guide
Dane Boston said he often faces questions from
those prospectives based on TPR’s rankings.
He reminds them that college guidebooks are
designed to make money and that alcohol is a
problem on all college campuses. His best coun-
ter: “spend time on campus and talk to real stu-
dents,” he tells them.

Nonetheless, Boston does see an element of
truth in the rankings—he points to a lack of so-
cio-economic diversity and a “divisive” Greek
system as real problems confronting the com-
munity. Rather than shy away from these “deep
ﬂaws,” he simply tries to “communicate my
hope that new generations of students will ad-
dress the ﬂaws while beneﬁting from the many
things we do right as an institution.”

Similarly, President Ruscio expressed conﬁ-
dence in the ability of the university community
to “make our own judgments of our strengths
and weaknesses.”

TPR’s Kelly would agree.

“Let us know if we’ve got it right or wrong,”
she said, urging more students to participate at
survey.review.com.

$100 million dollar man

Donor of the recent gift revealed at convocatio

By Jacob Gelger and
Mlchael Keenan
MANAGING EDITOR AND
SPORTS REPORTER

When Washington and

Lee University President
Ken Ruscio took ofﬁce in
July 2006, one of his ﬁrst
priorities was to visit Ru-
pert Johnson, Jr.

That visit, coupled with
Johnson’s interest in help-
ing his alma mater address
one of its strategic goals,
led to a $100 million dona-
tion that Ruscio announced
last spring at graduation.

“I went out and spoke
with [Johnson] early in July
last year, right after I came
on,” Ruscio said. “The ﬁrst
thing he said was that he
wanted to do something
that was a priority for the
university.”

Worried that the an-
nouncement would over-
shadow the Class of 2007’s
accomplishments, Johnson
choose to remain anony-
mous until last Wednesday,
when Ruscio announced
the new scholarship plan at
Convocation. ‘

Dennis Cross, W&L’s
Vice President for Uni-
versity Advancement said
Johnson also wants to
avoid the national media
spotlight.

“He always thought that

announce his name to the
W&L community,” Cross
said.

Johnson, who graduated
from W&L in 1962, is the
Vice Chairman of Franklin

Templeton Investments.
His father started the group
in 1947.

Forbes Magazine esti-
mated Johnson’s net worth
at $4.6 billion, and he is
listed as the world’s 172
richest person in the maga-
zine’s 2007 rankings.

Johnson did not return
two calls requesting com-
ment.

Cross said Johnson had
been a generous and active
donor in the past.

“It was clear that [John-
son] was very interested
in student scholarship and
making sure the best stu-
dents could attend W&L
regardless of cost,” Cross
said.

The new program will
certainly enhance that goal.
$85 million will go directly
toward need-based grants.

Ruscio said the new
program, when fully imple-
mented, will increase the
need-based aid budget by
25 percent. The Class of
2012 will have 44 John-
son scholars, with a similar
number entering each.year.
Half of the students will
hold merit scholarships

VV 8514 THeaTeR

similar to the old George
Washington scholarship
program, and half will hold
new need-based grants.

Dean of Admissions
William Hartog canceled
an interview to discuss the
program, and other mem-
bers of the admissions of-
ﬁce were either out of town
or did not respond to re-
quests for comment.

Cross said the gift will
be paid to the university
over the next four years. 5

But Johnson’s gift goes
beyond simply paying stu-‘
dents’ tuition. The remain-
ing $15 million will create
two new professorships,
establish a lecture series
and symposium and gives
rising seniors the opportu-
nity to pursue leadership
development

“Ken outlined in pow-
erful terms the need for
professorships and sympo-
siums,” Cross said.

One of the new profes-
sors will teach in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences,
studying how individuals
and ideas can shape his-
tory. The second professor
will teach in the Williams
School, focusing on leader-
ship and entrepreneurship.

Ruscio has a history of
studying and teaching lead-
ership. Before becoming
W&L’s 26”‘ President, he

served as Dean of the Uni-

son School of Leadership.

As Ruscio pointed out
at Convocation on Wednes-
day, university presidents
have spent more and more
time in recent years deal-
ing with fundraising and
alumni relations.

“A lot of my job is talk-
ing to alumni and support-
ers of the university, but it’s
not always talking about a
donation,” Ruscio said.
“It’s about their connec-
tions to the university.”

Johnson’s $100 million
gift certainly helps W&L
address one of the major
priorities of its new stra-
tegic plan, Ruscio said the
school still has about $600
million worth of spending
built into its plan for the
next 10 years.

Asked what he would
do if another donor offered
up $100 million, Ruscio
said the gift could go to a
number of places.

‘‘I’d want to find out
what in the strategic plan
is meaningful to that [do-
nor],” Ruscio said. “Maybe
it’s the Colonnade, maybe
the replacement for Du-
Pont Hall, or maybe it’s
more money for improving
faculty salaries. We try to
match the donor’s interest
with the plan.”

Greeks need to fight problems as one

We ’re only shooting ourselves in the foot. Instead of always fighting each other: band together

By Cody Beauchamp
co LU M NIST

Schadenfreude — n. A mali-
cious satisfaction obtained from
the misfortune of others.

Over the summer, Kappa Sig
had its charter revoked. Dur-
ing orientation week, Phi Psi”s
Fallout, was busted and shut
down. Just this weekend, I had to
sneak back to campus in a mass
of people because Lexington po-
lice managed to scare the Pikas at
Aquavelva into shutting down.

Since all fraternities compete to
throw the best parties and impress
the same rushees, I get a distinct
feeling of schadenfreude every
time I see another house’s parties
get shut down. I secretly~-heck,
openly—smile whenever I hear
a freshman swear they’ll “never
go back to that house; they get
busted.”

Really though, why should I
celebrate?

All Greeks like to entertain the
notion that our houses are unique,
that what troubles one house
won’t affect all ofus.

We couldn’t be more naive.

Would it help frat A’s rush if
competing frat B has their parties
continually shut down? Of course
it would. But are frat A’s long-

area community has made no se-
cret about how much they hate the
Greek system, ergo a majority of
W&L students.

The city and county have con-
tinually honed laws and ordinanc-
es towards ever more effective
forms of student discrimination.

Last year the county seriously
considered cracking down on
country parties because of com-
plaints from local residents who
had moved near party homes.
These houses had become infa-
mous for loud parties long before
their neighbors moved in. What
did these people expect - study
sessions at Downfall?

The implicit threat of an or-
dinance being put on the books
still lingers for the country. Some
neighbors! They moved to where
we are and we’re in trouble.

Go down to the police sta-
tion to obtain an ampliﬁed sound
pennit. as I did with a fraternity
brother last week.

If you walk in and introduce
yourself as the president of the
local gun club, explain you’re
having a club BBQ, and ask for a
permit, you’ll get it without much
hassle.

Introduce yourself as the So-
cial ('hair of a fraternity and
you’ll suddenly be required to

(We know that We’re essential-
ly denying you a basic permit, but
sorry Mr. Fratman, you haven’t
jumped through this especially re-
served hoop yet!)

The anti—Greek sentiment is
ridiculous. Our frats and srats
give hundreds, even thousands, of
hours of community service each
year. They also represent most of
the student body, a student body
that adds intelligence and talent to
the community.

W&L is the reason, obviously,
over a hundred of brilliant profes-
sors live in Lexington, again add-
ing to the quality of life.

If nothing else, the Greek
houses pump tens of thousands of
dollars into the local economy.

But nobody seems to care.

The community simply sees
us as a bunch of spoiled rich kids
looking to get drunk; never mind
the blood-drives, the charity 5Ks
or the carnivals for kids.

Never mind the millions of
dollars pumped into the local
economy because of the school,
an entity made up of nearly 80%
Greek students. Even the exces-
sively large police force gets to
justify size by citing us.

Unfortunately, the administra-
tion and their proxy—or should
I say pawn?—the IFC don’t do

es is both unfair and enough to
terrify the most stalwart deans.

The IFC though, as the very
students discriminated against,
has no excuse for its passiveness.

If the members really are rep-
resentative of the fraternities,
they should be protesting them-
selves sick every day about how
unequally the frats and srats are
treated.

Are there possibly underaged
kids drinking at these parties?
Sure. But can the police magically
bend the rules of due process/sus-
picion just because people are vis-
ibly young? No.

The IFC should be advancing
that protest like it’s their job. Be-
cause—are you listening gentle-
men?——it is. That’s what advo-
cates do.

Greeks at W&L have to start
standing up for each other. Collec-
tively we have to start demanding
that the community, law enforce-
ment, and other authorities treat
us without prejudice. If a city or-
dinance made it more diﬂicult for
black people to assemble peace-
fully, do you think it would pass
without protest? No.

Why then do we stand by idly
when We’re discriminated against
for being students or in a frat or
srat? Schadenfreude may be fun

Rankings don ’t matter

High schoolers are ravenous for information about
their prospective colleges. Cheery pamphlets sent from
admission ofﬁces are well and good, but they fail to
convey the truth of student life. The annual Princeton
Review says it tries to provide a true picture of W&L
life to prospective students.

We’re ranked No. 1 for lots of hard liquor, No. 7 for
lots of beer and No. 2 for having a major Greek scene.
True, the admissions office does not advertise that side
of the school, but that’s also because these are opin-
ions.

The review admits is doesn’t use scientiﬁc methods.
It surveys hundreds of students to rank the schools rath-
er than using hard data.

Every year the administration makes it a point to
mention Princeton Review because they know students
and parents have seen the rankings.

But why do they bother?

If people rely solely on Princeton Review, do we re-
ally care? Any student worth admitting will do his re-
search or visit the campus. Parents who are concerned
should also do their research and not just read one re-
view.

Princeton Review panders to concerned parents. Do

The selection of a vice presi-
dent with appeal to key demo-
graphics, ideologies and regions
will be incredibly important to
the Republican party. With such
an ideologically diverse group of
presidential aspirants for 2008,
each contender would likely want
different things in their running
mate. The following vice presi-
dential candidates all have their
own strengths.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee

With his strong performances
in the recent Iowa Republican
straw poll and the past several dc-

tion to the ticket of a moderate
like Giuliani or McCain, espe-
cially Considering the fact that
Huckabee could help to fortify
the South against the encroaching
Democratic gains in the region.

Arizona Sen. John McCain

Some would question whether
this veteran senator and former
frontrunner would consider the
position described by former Vice
President Garner as “not worth a
pitcher of warm piss”.

McCain would likely ﬁnd the
offer to continue his long service
to our nation hard to resist. With
the other candidates’ recent com-
pliments paid to McCain, they

This conservative Midwest-
emer has long been considered
a possible Presidential or Vice
Presidential selection. Pawlenty’s
national visibility has been elevat-
ed considerably by his leadership
during the recent Minneapolis
bridge collapse and the fact that
the 2008 Republican National
Convention will be held in the
Twin Cities.

His region of the Midwest has
become increasingly important
to the Republican electoral math,
and his presence on the ticket
could help win his blue state’s
10 electoral votes as well as keep
Iowa and Indiana red. However,
Pawlenty’s early and vocal sup-

is often viewed as a northern big-
govemment moderate. Sanford
could make a mark if he endorsed
the eventual winner of the South
Carolina primary and the nomina-
tion. However, Sanford’s limited
national exposure and lack of true
signature accomplishments limits
his viability.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry

While Perry’s connection to the
legacy of President Bush makes
a national run unlikely in this
cycle, Perry continues to receive
mentions as a possible candidate.
With a staunchly conservative re-
cord over his seven years in Tex-
as’ executive branch, Perry could

applicants these days. A report from Princeton Review
is hardly going to scare all of those talented applicants
away.

If they’re smart enough to be admitted (and doesn’t
admission say that each class is smarter than the one
before?), then they’re smart enough to get a balanced
view of W&L.

W&L students have always had a reputation for «

playing hard and working hard. The formula has always
worked before, so why is admissions and the adminis-
tration so detennined to change it?

W&L ﬁghts to change

elitist reputation

The class of 201 I reﬂects continuous struggle‘
for greater ethnic and economic diversity

By Queenle Wong
smrr wmren

Every year the admissions office at Wash-
ington and Lee University works hard to di-
versify a predominately white student body.

“We want to create a well—rounded fresh-
men class and to do that we have to bring
students from many different backgrounds
together,” said Erica Reisbeck, the assistant
director of admissions.

Yet despite increasing efforts to recruit
more multicultural students to thiscampus,
the university still remains far from diverse.

In the latest issue of U.S. News and World
Report’s “America’s Best Colleges,” the
university, ranked against other liberal arts
colleges, received low marks for economic
diversity as well as ethnic diversity.

Washington and Lee ranked last in eco-
nomic diversity with 4 percent of the under-
graduate population receiving Pell grants, a
federal grant for low-income students. In ad-
dition, the school received a score of 0. l 9 out
of 1.0 on the publication’s diversity index,
which only factored in the number of Ameri-
can minorities: a shocking ﬁnd for a school
that was ranked 15 overall.

For years, the university has worked to
increase the number of students with diverse
backgrounds. In 2002, the board of trustees
adopted “A Statement of Commitment to
Diversity,” which stated that the university
would not only work to create a more diverse
student body, but a diverse faculty and ad-
ministration as well. “Just as a vibrant liberal
arts education in the classroom challenges
attitudes, beliefs and accepted ways of think-
ing, the interaction outside the classroom
of individuals with different perspectives
strengthens our educational enterprise,” it
stated.

Reisbeck pointed to the advancements
in technology as one of the tools that has
helped push the university’s diversity efforts
forward. Five out of eight employees at the
admissions office will also travel intemation-
ally, going anywhere from ﬁfteen to thirty
different foreign countries in the fall, she
said.

“From all the liberal arts colleges, 1 decid-
ed to attend Washington and Lee University
because of its unique academic and social
environment,” said Vasil Vulkov, a freshman
from Bulgaria.

A presentation that was delivered in his
high school attracted him to the university as
well, he said.

Although Reisbeck admitted that other
variables such as race and ethnicity are used
in the admissions process, she wouldn’t clas-
sify it as affirmative action. Academically,
each applicant is judged equally, but in any
competitive admissions process, the univer-
sity must base admission on what the student
will bring to the campus environment. There-
fore, two students with the same SAT score
and GPA are eventually separated based on
other criteria like race, legacy, geography, or
talent, Reisbeck said.

This year 22 international students and 54
American minority students enrolled out of a
total of 463 freshmen. However, these num-
bers did not include the 11 dual citizens that
are also attending Washington and Lee.

For the most part, there have not been any
signiﬁcant changes in the university’s eth-
nic diversity during the last ﬁve years, but
Reisbeck said that new efforts to increase
socio-economic diversity are currently tak-
ing place.

“In college, we hope to make an impact
on students and diversity is one way to do
that.” A

Hinely shares musical art

W&L photographer combines two passions

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

University photographer Pat-
rick Hinely is rarely seen, yet
his work is all over campus.
He ﬁlls the university calendar,
magazines and website with
photographs of students, alumni,
athletes, events and locations
around campus.

In his exhibit “Jazz People,”
featured this month in the Sta-
nier Gallery, Hinely steps out
from behind his camera to dis-
play photographs much different
from his typical full-color shots
of campus. Hinely takes the op-
portunity to show off his love
of both jazz music and raw ﬁlm
photography.

The exhibit is in anticipation
of Hinely’s newly published
work, a 52-page hybrid book,
calendar and diary called the
“Jazzperezzo 2008 Jazz Calendi-

ary.”

Hinely has been taking pic-
tures of musicians since he grad-
uated from Washington and Lee
in 1973.

“It’s gotten amazingly and
wonderfully out of hand since
then,” Hinely said.

Hinely followed some of his

  

favorite bands as they traveled,
taking photographs and offering
his prints to their record compa-
nies. As a result, Hinely’s work
has been featured on the inside
or the cover of almost 200 al-
bums as well as jazz magazines
from around the world.

“Jazz is a music that comes
from America but doesn’t thrive
here anymore,” Hinely said, ex-
plaining why his photographs
range from Lexington to Berlin
to Japan. “Music has taken me a
lot of places I wouldn’t have got-
ten to go otherwise.”

Just as Hinely continues to
shoot with a black and white
ﬁlm camera, the subjects of his
photographs have pursued a craft
often considered defunct.

“To me they’re heroes in a
way,” Hinely said. “They’re car-
rying on a tradition because they
love it so it’s worth it.”

Hinely explained how the
exhibit tries to show the over-
lap between beauty and truth, of
glamour and simplicity.

“Among all the media, these
pictures can present something
that might be beautiful but that is
certainly true,” Hinely said. “My
job is to ﬁnd them both.”

Though the pictures show

Bl'Ball The Banli.

some famous faces, they are all
presented in black and white, un-
ﬁnished and unframed, hanging
from the walls by paperclips.

“In the world of ﬁne art these
prints are wearing shorts instead
of tuxedos,” Hinely said.

He enjoyed the way an art
director from another univer-
sity noted that the exhibit was as
simple as sheet music hanging
on the walls.

Most of all, Hinely wants gal-
lery visitors to take away the idea
that “music doesn’t just create it-
self, there’s work involved, both
glamorous and unglamorous.”

Hinely wants to show the te-
nacity of the musician’s spirit,
something that he feels makes
them remarkable.

“I like what these people do
because they talk about freedom
of expression and inspire the po-
tential of human spirit,” Hinely
said. “They play like it might be
the last time they’ll ever play:
from the depth of their souls.”

“Jazz People” will be featured
in the Stanier Gallery from Sept.
3 through Oct. 10. Hinely will
give a short lecture on Friday,
Sept. 14 at 5:30 p.m., followed
by a reception featuring live mu-
sic in the gallery.

BHOTO COURTESY OF STACY DOORNBOS

Junlor Michael Welsh won the Washington and Lee Invitational in
a time of 28:39 to help the men's team secure first place.

XC off and running

Michael Welsh wins ﬁrst collegiate race on 21 st birthday
Men win team title, Telfeyan leds women to second place

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s cross coun-
try teams began their competitive sea-
sons with great runs at the Washington
and Lee Invitational. The men’s team
ﬁnished ﬁrst while the women’s team
claimed second place, with both compet-
ing against 13 other teams.

The men’s performances were high-
lighted by three ﬁnishers in the top ten of
124 runners. Junior Anthony Ives round-
ed out the top 10 with a time of 30:23,
junior Vance Berry took fourth with a
time of 29:26, and junior Michael Welsh
ﬁnished ﬁrst with a time of 28:39.

As a result, Welsh celebrated both his
ﬁrst collegiate win and his twenty-ﬁrst
birthday on the same day.

Thomas Brower, senior captain of the
men’s team, commented on Welsh’s win,
“I can’t think of a better birthday pres-
ent for Welsh than his ﬁrst collegiate vic-
tory.”

The women’s team ﬁnished well, es-
pecially with individual performances by
sophomores Kat Telfeyan and Dorothy
Todd. Telfeyan ﬁnished sixth with a time
of 25 :29, while Todd took ninth after ﬁn-
ishing in 25:39.

The performances on Saturday by our
cross country teams have set them up for
a strong year. Before the meet, the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference released
its 2007 preseason coaches poll which
named both of W&L’s teams as the fa-
vorites to win the ODAC championships
this year.

“We got the win despite holding out two of our top ﬁve run-

ners, which gives us a lot of conﬁdence moving forward The

the country in very warm conditions. ’

freshmen ran very well on one of the most diﬁicult courses in

}

TOM BROWER, Men's cross country captain

When asked about how the teams
have reacted to the results of this poll,
Brower remarked, “I don’t think the poll
itself places any pressure on us. Between
returning our top 12 runners and adding
eight new runners, we expect that we are
the team to beat. Our position in a poll
doesn’t change how much we want to
keep the ODAC title in Lexington for a
fourth consecutive year.”

Jessica. Buckingham, senior captain
of the women’s team, added, “While the
women’s team has won the ODAC for
the last three years, I think we are cer-
tainly capable of defending our title this
year. I am pleased and honored we have
been picked to win the conference title,
because it gives us something to work
toward throughout the season. Being
picked ﬁrst does not mean the title will
automatically be handed to us this year.
After placing second to Roanoke in the
invitational, we learned that this title is
going to be something we need to ﬁght
for. Being picked to win provides us with
this goal.”

So what do Saturday’s results mean
for the teams as they continue with the
rest of their season? Brower observed,

“We got the win despite holding out two
of our top ﬁve runners, which gives us
a lot of conﬁdence moving forward. The
freshmen ran very well on one of the
most difficult courses in the country in
very warm conditions, plus it was their
ﬁrst ever experience with 8000 meters.
It’s a lot to ask.”

For the ladies, Buckingham noted the
strength of Roanoke, “I think coming in
second place to the Roanoke girls will
motivate us to work even harder through-
out the season. Though I think we all
would have preferred to win our opening
invitational, this hopefully will serve as
a reminder to us all that Roanoke is go-
ing to be a dominant force in the ODAC
this year and that we are going to have to
work hard to beat them in the conference
championship!”

Overall, the teams are off to a strong
start and as senior captain Andrew Fris-
ki said, “Everyone went out and did
their best. No one could have asked for
more.”

After this fantastic start, the cross
country teams will return to action this
Saturday at the New York University In-
vitational.

For NFL,
upcoming

season provides

solace and
distraction
from off‘-season
issues

NFL looks towards upcoming

season to dispel image issues

By Amor Nelll Thurapl
COLU M msr

Aside from Thursday night’s opener featuring the Su-
per Bowl Champion Indianapolis Colts decimating the
New Orleans Saints, this past Sunday marked the begin-
ning of the 2007-2008 NFL season, arguably one of the
most important days of the year for sports fans. However,
this new season is unlike any other before it due to the
current state of the National Football League. Following
what can be described as the most tumultuous off-season
in league history, the NFL and its fans must look towards
this upcoming season as an escape from all the issues that
have plagued its players and personnel off the ﬁeld.

First and foremost, the past few months have seen the
ongoing saga of the Michael Vick scandal unfurl before
our very eyes. One of the best overall athletes ever to
grace a football ﬁeld now stands to face a minimum of
12 months in prison as a result of his involvement in an
illegal dog ﬁghting and gambling ring. As details of Vick
and his fellow defendant’s crimes surfaced, the ensuing
media frenzy surrounding the case produced daily from
page reports and round-the-clock coverage of Vick.’s ap-
pearances in court. At a time when NFL fans and sports
enthusiasts alike should have been getting excited at the
prospect of training camps opening up, signaling that the
NFL season was just around the comer, they were sub-
jected to constant reminders of the appalling behavior of
which one of the league’s most successful and marketable
players was a part. This dark cloud loomed large over the
NFL, and it appeared to provide the ﬁtting, ﬁnal chapter
to this year’s most disappointing off-season.

It is imperative to note that the Vick investigation and
indictment concluded an off-season in which second year
Commissioner Roger Goodell had already suspended
NFL players Adam “Pacman” Jones of the Tennessee Ti-
tans (for the entire season), Chris Henry of the Cincin-
nati Bengals (8 games), and Terry “Tank” Johnson of
the reigning NFC Champion Chicago Bears (8 games).
Each of the aforementioned athletes has had numerous,
and repeated, arrests with charges ranging from provid-
ing alcohol to minors, in Henry’s case, to Jones’ felony
and misdemeanor assault charges, and Johnson’s charges
of aggravated assault and possession of unlicensed weap-
ons.

Such reckless behavior by professional athletes brings
an unnecessary black eye to a league that is the highest
grossing professional sports organization in America. Not
since the tragedy surrounding former Carolina Panthers
wide receiver Rae Carruth’s role in the murder of his then
pregnant girlfriend in 1999 — an act for which Carruth is
currently serving an 18 year sentence — has the NFL had
to deal with such serious criminal offenses. Even the al-
legations surrounding Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray
Lewis’ involvement in a double homicide ended with
all felony charges being dismissed, thereby clearing his
name, despite the fact that many might contest that the
same cannot be said in the court of public opinion.

It appears that the NFL is in dire need to revamp its
image, and must do so in order to maintain its stronghold
as the most popular professional game in America. Unlike
in years past, there seem to be more and more players who
possess an overall lack of discipline, self-restraint, and
respect for authority. Such players only serve to further
mar the reputation of professional athletes and the league
itself.

That being said, I feel that this season presents the
NFL with the unique opportunity to restore its image
throughout the upcoming months. Fans of the NFL get to‘
witness a bona ﬁde superstar in Ladainian Tomlinson as
he continues to carve up opposing defenses while putting
up record breaking statistics. They also get to see capti-
vating rivalries such as another potential playoff matchup
between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis
Colts for the third time in four years as Peyton Manning
tries to build a dynasty, while Patriots quarterback Tom
Brady attempts to start another one of his own. These sto-
rylines combined with the usual, yet unforeseen, drama
that unfolds over the course of the NFL season certainly
serve to ease the minds of football fans away from the
incidents that occurred this past off-season.

While the coverage of Michael Vick’s sentencing in
December will once again be in the news, and while there
will inevitably be certain disciplinary issues that Com-
missioner Goodell must face this season, it seems that for
the ﬁrst time since last February, the NFL will once again
be about the bone jarring hits, the underdog upsets, and
the beauty of the game itself, something that I think fans
all across the country are anxiously anticipating.

Defense stonewalls F&M

Pacicco rushes for 122 yards and a pair of touchdowns in victory

By Brian Devlne
STAFF warren

Washington and Lee football
games have sometimes been writ-
ten off as a joke, as a place to show
off that new sundress or bow tie
before leaving at halftime. In past
seasons, the team’s on-ﬁeld per-
formance has somewhat justiﬁed
this attitude with poor results and
unexciting play.

In 2006, however, the boys in
blue performed well above expec-
tations, winning ﬁve of six league
games, including clinching the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence title- and W&L football’s
ﬁrst postseason birth since 1951-
in front of a near-capacity crowd
on Parents’ Weekend.

Therefore, the trend of the si-
lent ﬁrst-half crowd was greatly
diminished, as loyal fans started
to stay the entire game and to
support the home side with chants
and noisemakers.

The 2007 season opener, a
sun-drenched affair Saturday af-
ternoon, proved too hot for the

large number of home fans that
left at halftime and for the visiting
Franklin and Marshall Diplomats,
who lost 20-0. The reduced crowd
support didn’t seem to bother the
Generals’ vaunted defense, . who
held the visitors to just three suc-
cessful third down conversions on
17 attempts.

Several defensive stalwarts
from last year’s postseason run
made their presence, including
the reigning Virginia Division
ll-Ill Defensive Player of the
Year, comerback Mark Snoddy.
Snoddy and fellow seniors Bry-
ant Fulk (5 tackles, 1 sack), Ryan
MacPhee and Kyle Luby held the
Diplomats to just 122 yards of to-
tal offense.

The visiting team was out-
played from beginning to end of
Saturday’s contest on both sides
of the ball.

Tailback Tom Paccico led the
way for the blue and white, rush-
ing 33 times for a career-high 116
yards and two of the Generals’
three touchdowns. Senior Jack
Martin, a pre-season All-America
selection at wide receiver, caught

nine passes for 177 yards and one
touchdown.

Perhaps worried about the
triple-edged ground threat of Pac-
cico, quarterback R..I. Vamer and
V-back Stuart Sitterson, Diplo-
mats coach John Troxell often left
only comerback Jeff Liberatore
to cover Martin, even in obvious
passing situations.

Vamer, a sophomore, took ad-
vantage of the mismatch to great
effect, often looking immediately
to Martin on pass plays because
of the single coverage. Vamer
ﬁnished the game with 250 yards
passing from 18 completions out
of 40 pass attempts.

The Generals dominated the
second half, making F&M punt
on seven of their eight drives, the
eighth ending only at the game’s
ﬁnal whistle. Dips’ quarterback
Kyle Turner, heckled all game by
the loyal home fans, was sacked
four times and completed only
seven passes for 59 yards.

The lone bright spot for the
visitors was the play of a few de-
fenders. Zach Romash recorded
eleven tackles and James Gregory

had ten. Defensive end George
Farrell had nine tackles and
forced a fumble, and safety Jeff
Kellar picked off two of Varner’s
passes.

All in all it was a resounding
victory on Hall of Fame week-
end, and even Dips coach Troxell
acknowledged the talent on the
W&L team.

“We played a team this after-
noon that is ready to compete on a
national level,” Troxell remarked
to the F &M athletics website.

If the Generals’ defense con-
tinues to stiﬂe opponents and
Martin remains a big-play threat,
then the 2007 season could be as
successful as 2006.

The Generals were picked to
ﬁnish second in the preseason
ODAC coaches’ poll, which
points to a crucial showdown-
again on Parents’ Weekend- with
top—ranked Bridgewater.

As with last season, perhaps
fans will begin to realize that
Generals football is worth watch-
ing and cheering for, and perhaps
their support will once again in-
spire the team to the postseason.

Volleyball opens season by winning two of four as hosts oft e W&L Invitational

By Michael Keenan
sponrs ronon

The Generals began their drive
for a seventh consecutive ODAC
title this weekend by hosting the
Washington and Lee Invitation-
al. While most volleyball teams
opened their season a week ago,
W&L’s had to wait until this
weekend because NCAA restric-
tions prevent teams from compet-
ing until classes have started.

“It’s pretty big,” said Coach
Snyder of opening against teams
that had already played their ﬁrst
games. “It’s not an excuse but it
is a factor.” 1

In the ﬁrst game of the tourna-
ment, the Generals took on South-
ern Virginia University, who en-
tered the match riding a seven
game win streak.

After dropping the ﬁrst game,
the Generals rallied to take the
second game and tie the match
a 1-1. After falling behind 26-22
in the third game, the Generals
“showed a lot of heart” in coming
back to win that game, said Sny-
der. Though they would lose the
fourth game, the Generals won
the ﬁfth game to win the match
24-30, 30-28, 30-28, 31-33, 15-
10, to preserve their undefeated
record against SVU.

were named to the All-Tournament team.

In the night cap, the Gener-
als took on Christopher Newport
University Captains. CNU en-
tered the match with a 1-5 record
after being swept by Southwest-
ern University earlier in the after-
noon. The Captains doubled their
win total for the year by sweeping
the Generals by a score of 30-26,

30-16, 30-14. With a number of

new players and some returners
in new positions, the Generals’
inexperience showed with ragged
play.

The Generals rebounded Satur-
day morning with a sweep of their
own against McDaniel, 30-23, 30-

23, 30-24. In the ﬁnal match of

the tournament, the Generals took
on Southwestern University. The
Generals dropped the ﬁrst two but
refused to give up. In game three,
the Generals took a 27-23 lead
and then gave up four straight
points to tie the game. But the
Generals regained their compo-
sure and won the game 30-27 to
avoid being swept. After keeping
it close through the fourth game,
Southwestern proved to be too
much and won the match 30-27,
30-24, 27-30, 30-24.
Southwestem’s win was their
fourth of the tournament, which

 
   

clinched the overall team trophy.
Southwestern was led by touma—

ment MVP Katy Lukaszewski -

and All-Toumament Team mem-
ber Marie Bruce. ‘

Joining the all-toumament
team for the Generals were junior
Laura Mauer and senior Jess Hu-
dock.

Overall, Snyder said he was
pleased with the team’s ﬁnish. He

was particularly impressed with-

freshmen Jenna Finger and Marah
Schmitz because they were asked
to play a lot and responded well in
their first collegiate matches.

Snyder believes the team has
the tools to put together another
successful season but still needs
to polish its skills, starting with
defense. Some of the raggedness
was a result of being out of posi-
tion defensively, which led to in-
decision on the court.

When asked about the team’s
chances to repeat as ODAC
champions, Snyder said the team
doesn’t view it as defending the
2006 title because nobody can
take that was but instead looks at
it as attacking the 2007 title.

“It’s a strong conference,” said
Snyder.

The Generals return to action
next Saturday when they take on
a strong Bridgewater team at 1 la.
m. and Gallaudet at 1 p.m.

Two foreign males entered the hallway on Davis dormitory’s third floor and entered several rooms of its female residents.

By Joel Poelhuls
STA FF WRITER

Two South African visitors en-
tered severalr freshman girls’ rooms
uninvited late Wednesday night after
parties, even climbing into bed with
girls who were asleep.

Though neither is a student
of Washington and Lee, brothers
Jacques and Marscell Newman, ages
22 and 21 respectively, were able to
enter Davis and Gilliam dorms.

According to freshman Joan
Oguntimein, the brothers went from
room to room on the girls’ halls, ask-
ing for a place to sleep before their
drive to the airport in the morning.

Oguntimein continued that the
two were forceful in their demands,
closing the door of her room in Davis
behind them after entering.

She ﬁrst became aware of the in-
truders when she heard them talking
to boys on Davis’ 2nd floor. Jacques
and Marscell then ascended to the 3rd

Fraternity returns to campus
after four-year hiatus, looks for
men of exceptional character

By Catherine carlock
c 0 pr E D ITO R

Sayonara, Kappa Sig. Bienvenido, Beta.

That’s right, Beta is back.

According to Adam Porter Price, Beta Theta
Pi’s Senior Leadership Consultant, the fraternity’s
return to campus will be “a big extravaganza.”
Price is a 2006 alumnus the University of Connect-
icut’s Zeta Chi chapter.

Four years have passed since Beta Theta Pi’s
Alpha Rho chapter at Washington and Lee had
their charter revoked.

According to Price, Beta’s alcohol and drug
abuse was widespread. But even more serious
were allegations against the fraternity for serious
hazing violations. With the help of W&L officials,
Beta alunmi and the General Fraternity (similar to
Nationals), Beta’s chapter at W&L closed in 2004.

According to Price, there was a “consensus that
the chapter needed to be closed in order for it to be
good again.”

Even though Beta had not been a formally rec-
ognized fraternity for several years, it still had a
presence on and off campus last year. Former Beta
members have occupied a house called Pole 1.

Matt Leisman, a ﬁfth-year senior and a former
Beta, said that his fraternity was “just a bunch of
really good guys who loved having a good time”
and who “didn’t care what other people thought.”

This past spring brought the graduation of most
of the 2004 Beta pledge class. As a result, the Beta
General Fraternity has again partnered with W&L
ofﬁcials and Beta alumni to re-colonize the Alpha
Rho chapter.

For most of Fall Tenn, Price will do the re-
cruiting himself. In November, however, Beta’s
General Fraternity will send three to four more ad-
ministrators to campus to aid Price in his search.
Then, in January, the formal expansion process
will begin.

Because of W&L’s deferred recruitment pro-
cess, Price has plenty of time to get‘ to know po-
tential new members. These new members can be
“anybody who is not currently in a fraternity” said
Price. This includes independent upperclassmen
and freshmen men.

According to Price, the new Alpha Rho is go-
ing to be different from the old chapter in three
signiﬁcant ways: V

0 No hazing. Price said he wants new member
experiences to be “totally, 100 percent positive.”

0 Responsible use of alcohol.

0 A closer understanding of the values of Beta
Theta Pi.

Price is currently seeking leaders, scholars
and gentlemen. Instead of waiting for potential
pledges to come to him, Price is seeking them out
himself. He’s asking professors for referrals of
stellar students; he’s asking dorm counselors for
referrals of quality gentlemen.

What deﬁnes a gentleman is “a really hard thing
to know” said Price. “It’s kind of a gut feeling for
me.” He wants “guys who everybody looks up to.”
In other words, Price wants “role models.”

According to Leisman, Beta’s “expectations are
oi? the charts.”

“It’s good-hearted but it’s not something that’s

Sobriety checkpoints will become routine in Lexington

Police issued several reckless driving tickets for over-crowded vehicles at traﬁic checkpoint at the East Lexington Bridge

STAFF WRITERS

Ann Marie Russell does not
drink. Instead, she ensures that
her friends who choose to drink
can get around safely.

That is why Friday, Sept. 7,
she was happy to drive her friends
out to Windfall Hill. She had one
more person than her car could
hold, forcing two of her friends to
share the front seat.

Little did she know that the
Lexington police were running a
checkpoint that evening, and she

“Just because you ’re on the bus, its not safe base. You

set one up and [to] always have an
alternative plan,” he said.

Lt. Miller said that although a.m.

er a wide range of public safety

LT. BUCKY MILLER, Lexington Police Department

would be charged under Virginia
law for reckless driving. --
Russell, who felt she was do-
ing a public service, said, “It’s
just frustrating to me, because if
I weren’t there someone would
have been driving drunk.”
Although it is rumored that the

sobriety checkpoint was aimed at
catching drunk drivers, DUI’s are
actually the least common tickets
issued in such efforts, Lt. A.M.
“Bucky” Miller said.

“The goal of the checkpoint is
to make everyone realize that you

these checks will not be run
monthly, W&L students will
definitely see more in the future.
Friday’s checkpoint was the ﬁrst
to occur for the 2007-2008 aca-
demic year. The last checkpoint
during the 2006-2007 year was
held in December.

At the checkpoint, 12 Lex-
ington Police ofﬁcers and seven
state troopers conducted a trafﬁc
checkpoint at the East Lexington
Bridge. The police stopped trafﬁc
both ways on State Road 631 East

That night, the police arrested
one individual, not of the W&L
community, for driving under the
inﬂuence. They also issued eight
court summons on counts of reck-
less driving and faulty equipment,
such as cracked windshields or
malfunctioning headlights.

The checkpoint was funded by
an annual $5,000 grant from the
Department of Motor Vehicles
that expires on Sept. 31. The
police department must reapply
for this grant every year. When

and emergency medical services.
In order to receive the grant,
the police department issues a
plan outlining the guidelines of
the checkpoint to the state. For
example, if trafﬁc is backed up
more than 300 feet, officers begin
checking every other car, every
ﬁfth car or simply allow all cars
to pass through, Miller said.

given for having even one too many passengers
in a vehicle.
“I think [the police] just wanted an excuse
to give people tickets,” Schreeder said.
Given the crawling pace of traffic, students

' tried to ﬁt as many people as possible into ve-

hicles headed back to campus, making such ci-
tations a common occurrence for the night.

Reckless driving in Virginia is punishable
by up to one year in jail and/or a ﬁne of up to
$2,500, as well as a possible suspension of driv-
ing privileges for up to six months.

Therefore, Miller cautioned W&L students
to avoid seating vehicles past their capacity.

“Just because you’re doing a good thing
doesn’t mean you can break the law to do that

good thing,” he said.

Miller also stressed the issue of liability.

If the driver of the vehicle should get into a
wreck, he or she would be liable for a lawsuit as
would the Greek organization that hired him.

Both Miller and W&L strongly urge W&L
students to use Traveller, the school’s bus sys-
tem, as their alternate mode of transportation
when driving is not an option.

Miller added, “Just because you’re on the
bus, it’s not safe base.”

“You still have to behave. If you’re on the
bus and you’re ﬂipping me off and you think
‘Oh, I’m on the bus, the police can’t do any-
thing,’ you’re dead wrong.”

Miller said he was pleasantly surprised to
see a large number of community members, in-
cluding W&L students, thank police officers for
keeping the roads free of drunk drivers.

Security

called security. The Newmans left.

“They were friendly,” Albuja said, “but they ended
up being a little too friendly.”

After exiting Davis, the two brothers entered Gil-
liam dorm where they continued to harass female resi-
dents.

Freshman Gilliam resident Summer Lollie was
asleep in her room around 3 a.m. when she felt an ex-
tra weight on her bed.

“l thought it was a dream, so I just turned over,”
Lollie said, “then I got turned back over and felt my
hand being moved.”

When the men tried to touch her inappropriately,
Lollie screamed, waking her roommate.

The trespassers ﬂed immediately, and the girls did
not report the incident to their Dorm Counselor that
night.

The Newmans had been staying with sophomore
Drew Crowley during the previous week at the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity house.

Crowley, who met Jacques over the summer in
Boston, said the two were well—liked around the house.
Crowley reports that there had been no incidents be-
fore Wednesday.

Freshman Cassandra Lewis said the brothers were
at a party she attended at Windfall Hill Monday night.

According to Crowley, Wednesday was the last day
the Newmans planned on being at W&L.

Crowley said he lost Contact with the brothers
Wednesday night. He added that the two planned to
catch a bus out of Lynchburg at 7 a.m. to New York,
where they were planning to ﬂy back to South Africa.

Michael Young, Director of Public Safety for W&L,
said security operations will not be altered by the in-
cident. However, he stressed the need for students to
be aware of who is coming into and going out of the
residence halls and to keep room doors locked.

Young said local police were not contacted. Dorm
counselors who were asked about the incident offered
no comment, in accordance with university policy.

Britney: Gimme no more

Her VIVA performance, full of stumbling and lip-syncing, could end her career

By Grace Andrews
COLUM NIST

For the past week, everyone
has been talking about the artist
formerly known as the Princess
of Pop, Britney Spears.

On Sept. 9, 2007, millions
of people gathered around their
televisions and watched the
MTV Video Music Awards for
what could have been the great-
est comeback in musical history;
instead it was one of the greatest
ﬂops ever seen.

Ms. Spears looked like a
drugged out impersonator teeter-
ing and tottering around the stage.
If you thought Ashlee Simpson’s
lip syncing performance on SNL
was bad, Britney made her look
like a seasoned professional.

At some points in her perfor-
mance, Ms. Spears would stop
singing all together and just stum-
ble around the stage some more.

Now, this terrible performance
could have been excused if Brit-
ney had come out in all of her
shimmery skin-colored-bodysuit
glory.

Instead, she came out in what
I will not compliment by calling
clothes... I will refer to them here
and ever after as undergarments.

So Ms. Spears had some unfor-
givably revealing undergarments,
terrible weave and questionable
make-up. It looked as if her vi-
sually impaired stylist had used

Elmer’s glue to apply some hair
stolen from a Bratz doll (that may
even be a compliment).

When I ﬁrst saw the atrocious-
ness that was on top of her head, I
said a silent prayer for the minia-
ture Clydesdale that had been kid-
napped and shaved to create those
terrible extensions.

When I say home-girl looked
bad, I mean BAD. All of America
probably watched the entire per-

formance with their jaws on the \

ground.

Sadly the shattering of jaws all
around the country was not only
from Britney’s two-tone hair.

Many people and magazines
have called Britney “fat” for the
way she looked at the VMA’s, but
I would like to say that fat is not
an accurate word in which to de-
scribe Britney.

This young lady has not only
had one but two kids. I have not
had even one child and I don’t
look that good.

v I think that the distinction peo-
ple want to make is that she is not
in quite the shape she used to be.
The self-professed crunchaholic
has clearly not been doing her
daily regimen of 1000 crunches.

But who can blame her, she’s
probably too busy almost drop-
ping her babies and partying so
hard she passes out on dance club
ﬂoors to focus entirely on exer-
cise.

The slight pooch could also be

a small present from the alcohol
king as a reward for the large in-
vestment she’s been making in his
empire.

All I have to say is that I per-
sonally feel terrible for Britney.
Her fall from glory almost rivals
that of the crazy man named Tom
Cruise.

I do not know about the rest
of America, but I was person-
ally rooting for her. As much as I
detest some of her songs, and by
some I mean almost all of them,
and believe her to be a terrible
actress and okay singer, I wanted
her to succeed.

I wanted Spears to prove to not
only the public, but to herself and
her boys that she could do it.

The young diva came out look-
ing like the neighborhood crack-
head instead of the girl next door
and proceed to dance in a manner
so lethargic that a 95-year-old
grandma could have beat her at
a game of Dance Dance Revolu-
tion.

There were points in the per-
formance where she looked back
at her dancers to see what they
were doing, only to wave her
hands at them and continue to
stumble around the stage like a
drunken Vagabond.

After watching the perfor-
mance laughed at from around the
world, I could not help but feel
deceived and cheated. If nothing
else, Britney has always been a

great performer.

No matter how terrible her
songs, you could always be guar-
anteed that she would give the
show of her life. Instead on that
fateful Sunday night, she gave the
performance that could END her
musical life.

Britney has ofﬁcially written
her page in the book of infamy.

Rumors has it that after the
performance Brit Brit ran off the
stage and cried her little languid
dancing heart out, as she should
have.

Had I been her, I would have
cried so much that my tears would
have created a baby Nile on the
stage.

However, I write this article
not only to vent, but to sort of ad-
vocate for Britney.

The stress of growing up in
Hollywood and the pressure of
success has become the common
Achilles heel of many stars. The
average person probably not only

has a hard time understanding, but '

also sympathizing with Britney.

I only pray that Ms. Spears
can get her life together in time to
keep her children and her dignity.

Britney needs help both emo-
tionally and psychologically and
she needs to return to her throne
of terrible bubblegum pop. As
much as I hate to admit it, she can
do better and deserves a better life
than what she has now.

Facebook stalking not a joke anymore

The site can help to waste hours of time, but make sure it doesn ’t replace real life

By Crlghton Allen
COLUMNIST

See if this sounds familiar: it’s
late and you have more homework
for one night than you did in your
entire senior year of high school.
You ﬁgure, okay, I’ll check my
Facebook for a second and then
I’ll hit the books.

When you ﬁnally emerge from
checking out your friend’s family
vacation to Rome and discovering
that the guy down the hall is ac-
tually a closet Gilmore Girls fan,
you look up blearily at the clock
and realize that it’s 1:00 am. and
that you still have 50 pages of
reading on free radical formation
for your organic chemistry class.

College students are the mas-
ters of procrastination and Face-
book is the single greatest inven-
tion in the history of time-wasting
since the launching of MTV.

F acebook has it all, no doubt.
You can review movies, post
comments on people’s walls 24/7,
and look at picture after picture of
your friends’ lives and wonder to
yourself “why doesn’t my fam-
ily go to Bora Bora? How come
I didn’t get a graduation trip to
Cozumel? And why don’t I have
a ski lodge in Vail?”

With all the hours of idle time-
wasting, though, come potential
consequences. Just ask Amy Po-
lumbo, the current Miss New Jer-
sey who earlier this summer was
held hostage by those threatening
to release scandalous photos of
her unless she relinquished her
title.

Where did the guys obtain the

photos? You saw it coming a mile
away, but it’s true: F acebook.
Polumbo was held in the pub-
lic spotlight for days until she beat
her foes to the punch, publicity
releasing the admittedly “unlady-
like” photos on the Today Show.
Polumbo was allowed to keep her
crown, but she caught loads of
unnecessary grief in the process.
But we’ve all been lectured
enough times about the dangers
of having unbecoming content

stand outside their window and
leave weird presents around, Boo
Radley style. But now, someone
can ﬁnd out everything about
you: your courses, your favor-

ite movies, anything that you-

post about yourself is fair game.
Some guys have resorted to using
Facebook as a primary method
of picking up girls. Guys ﬁnd a
girl, plot a “random run-in” as she
leaves class, and, in the ensuing
conversation, reveal their deep

Just make sure that you ’re not ﬁnding out

more about what you did on your nights out

from other people 19 pictures than what you

amd your friends can remember

on public forums, so the stories
about others getting in trouble for
indecent content on their proﬁles
may ring a bit hollow.

Just make sure that you’re not
ﬁnding out more about what you
did on your nights out from other
people’s pictures than what you
and your friends can remember.

Something you may not have
thought enough about concerning
Facebook is so called “stalking.”

Sure everyone has joked with
friends about “stalking” someone
and leaving comments on their
pictures or discovering their ob-
session with Ryan Adams, but
sometimes, this practice can be
turned into something else.

Before F acebook, the ‘ best
way to stalk an interest was to

passion for Death Cab for Cutie,
which is - what a coincidence —
her favorite band as well. Or the
guy could drop something else
that they share in common, like
they are both “Addicted to Star-
bucks!”

This happens, and it does not
get a pass. This practice is lame,
and guys (and possibly girls) who
employ this as the chief aspect of
their game spittin’ need to watch
“The Ladies Man” and pick up
some tips from Leon Phelps. Girls
fall every time for the offer of the
ﬁsh sandwich.

All joking aside, F acebook can
be a tool wielded by those who do
not have good intentions.

By many reports, cyberstalk-
ing—using the Internet and elec-

tronic communications to harass
and threaten people—is quietly
going strong in the United States.
Jayne Hitchcock, the president
of the anti-cyberstalking group

.. Working to Halt Abuse, says that

her organization receives between
50 and 100 reports of cyberstalk-
ing or online harassment each
week. Students who post personal
information on their proﬁles such
as phone numbers and addresses
put themselves at greater risk.

You’re probably thinking, but
only my F acebook friends can see
my proﬁle. However, there are
people out there with the time and
desire to get around obstacles like
that.

Bottom line, don’t accept a
friend request of a total stranger
and don’t post your dirty little se-
cret for the entire world to see.

One article I read said that
F acebook proﬁles should be treat-
ed like resumes. While no college

student alive uses it in a matter —

even close to that, practicing pru-
dence in what you tag, post, or
comment cannot hurt. Use‘Face-
book to keep in touch with friends
from high school, check out the
relationship status of the cutie in
your bio lab, (note to reader: use
of Facebook for this purpose is
allowable. To make your move,
use your own game, and ﬁnd and
poke the quarterback of the rival
team to get inside his head.

Just be mindful of what can
go wrong if F acebook is misused,
and for the love of all things holy,
walk away from the computer and
start on your organic chemistry.

editorial     

A nineteen-  
man DUI  

checkpoint  

How many police oﬁicers does it take
to run a checkpoint that issues only
one DUI arrest on a Friday night?

It took 19 police oﬂicers — twelve from the Lexington Po-
lice Department and seven from State Police — to man a sobriety
checkpoint on the East Lexington bridge two weeks ago. Nine-
teen.

And those 19 ofﬁcers made exactly one arrest for driving un-
der the inﬂuence.

Is that really the best use of these ofﬁcers’ time?

That means only three of Lexington’s 15 police ofﬁcers weren’t
on the East Lex bridge. '

Stopping drunk drivingis certainly an appropriate goal.

But Washington and Lee students have a right to be skeptical
of the police’s motives.

Scheduling a DUI checkpoint between Lexington and the ma-
jor student party hub ~ on the ﬁrst Friday of school, no less — cer-
tainly seems to send a message.

It is no secret that those neighbors, even
after students patched up relations with
county residents last year, wouldn ’t mind
seeing less partying at the Pole Houses and

Windfall Hill.

If that message is “don’t drink and drive,” ﬁne.

But it may also be a way to deter students from trying to party
in the country. _

Last year’s squabbles between Windfall students and their
neighbors are certainly familiar to every returning student. It’s no
secret that those neighbors, even after students patched up rela-
tions with county residents last year, wouldn’t mind seeing less
partying at the Pole Houses and Windfall Hill.

True, the DUI checkpoint was organized by Lexington offi-
cers, not the Rockbridge County Sheriff ’s Department.

But if students don’t think they have a way to get to houses
in the country, they’ll return to their old party areas in the city.
And parties in the city are bound to disturb as many ~ if not more
— people than the annual country bashes each fall.

W&L’s policies on parties in the fraternity houses have led
many organizations to take their social scene off campus. Sure,
their will be plenty of band parties in frat basements this year,
especially as the weather gets colder.

But students are increasingly unwilling to go through the has-
sles and hoops required by both the school and the city.

It’s simply easier to head for the country. Fewer rules, fewer
permits and fewer cops who drop by the parties.

And since the Lexington Police department initially refused
to issue sound permits to fraternities during the ﬁrst weekend of
the year, people felt like heading to the country was their only
choice. «

Lt. Bucky Miller told our reporters that DUI checkpoints will
continue throughout the year. And that’s ﬁne. ' ' I

It’s no secret that far too many college students — and Ameri-
cans in general — get behind the wheel after drinking.

But if each checkpoint is set up directly between town and
student party houses, W&L students will wonder if they’re being
singled out unfairly.

And if it takes 19 ofﬁcers to make one DUI arrest and write
a handful of traffic tickets, are state grants and taxpayer dollars
being well spent?

That question will have to be answered with time.

Test everything possible

Freshmen have the best opportunity to make changes; tradition not always best

By Dane Boston
GUEST COLUMNIST

I hope the freshmen will not
begrudge a rather sentimental sc-
nior a few words of advice  they
begin illustrious careers at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The University Crest, an amal-
gamation of heraldic elements
found in the Lee and Washington
crests, seems to me to he particu-
larly full of wisdom and guid-
ancc.

What struck me as l'contem-
plated this immediately recogniz-
able symbol of our school was the
open book in the upper left-hand
quadrant. “Omnia pro autom-
bate,” cnjoins the tiny text. “Test

everything,” a quotation from St. '

Paul’s first letter to the Thessalo-
nians.

I humbly submit that we have
the key to living out the school
motto printed beneath that crest.

II’ we are to be mindlill of the
future, we must be prepared to
obey the words of that tiny book
and test everytliing.

I address these thoughts to
freshmen (although upperclass-
men are not exempt) because they
will have many opportunities in
the coming months to put this
very good advice to work. The
complete text ofthc verse alluded
to runs. “Test everything, hold
fast to that which is good.”

Though our traditions strength-
en and sustain us at W&L. too
many un fortunate elements of our
institutional life persist because
we are unwilling to test them. We
are too easily swayed by appeals
to obscure concepts of tradition

and “the unique character of the
University” in matters that, if this
place is to survive and thrive in
the years to come, must be ad-
dressed.

Test everything. Challenge the
social conventions that limit this
place in the eyes of prospective
students and peer institutions.

Test the Greek system, that
strange and mysterious creature of

soured by the stench of exploita-
tion called New Member Educa-
tion, cast them aside.

Strike out on a sometimes dif-
ﬁcult, often lonely, course to ﬁnd
ways in which this wonderful
place may be freed from the bur-
den of elitism, strengthened by a
true collegial spirit, and stimulat-
ed to become the breeding ground

dubious value and equipped with
ponderous defenses. Freshmen
especially must avoid the trap of
thoughtlcssly falling into situa-

tions that compromise personal

values, all in the name of tradition
and assimilation. Test each house
you visit; pull each sordid detail
in the glaring light of day and
consider them next to the shining
virtues expounded by the 80 per-
cent of our student body who find
community in Greek life.

If you find that the scales tip
in favor of the house. join it and
strive with all your might to em-
body those virtues in your own
life and seek out creative ways
in which those guiding principles
can benefit the life of this aca-
demic community.

But if you find the old clubs
lacking; if you find their virtues
drowned in a sea of alcohol or ob-

Test the majors and depart-
ments. Find something that you
love, and classes will never be a
burden. Seek out professors who
inspire and energize you. we
have many years of work ahead,
so why not spend these four in the
warm glow of a true liberal edu-
cation‘? Test the departments and
throw yourself with enthusiasm to
the one best equipped to develop
your mind. and soul, not your em-
ployablc skills.

Test the policies and practices
of the University. Argue about
the relative merits and demerits
of the imminent change from the
$100 million bequest. Talk to one
another about the distinguishing
characteristics of W&L and test
them too. If you ﬁnd them want-

yourself in that essential process.

We must also, finally, test
ourselves. We must examine our
individual lives, each of which
contributes to the great whole of
the community.

What are the ways in which
we exploit, belittle, or dehuman-
izc? What are the ways in which
we empower, ennoble, and show

ery thought and every action.

For ourselves, our friends,
classmates and colleagues, may
we “throw away the worser part”
of our souls and live into the no-
ble possibility of this school with
the other half.

Freshmen have as much a
right to contribute to the broader
conversation as the most well-
known seniors and the most pow-
erful alumni; in fact, what you
have to say matters more because
four splendid years lie before you
to realize those hopes and dreams
you have for W&L.

There is much good in it, stores
of knowledge and virtue that are
vast and deep for you to enjoy.
There is also much. that we should
reject as unjust, corrupt, and un-
worthy to be associated with so
great a place.

Your job, and the responsibil-
ity of all former, current, and fu-
ture students, is to decide which
aspect of the University will leave

»a mark on your life, and to which

hoard you will contribute through
your life and actions.

Test everything. hold fast to
that which is good.

Sculpter shares passion in
Huntley Hall exhibit

By Carson Haddow Ken Smith is
STAFF WRITER the kind of sculp-
  tor who won’t take

no for an answer.
When he picks up his chisel he “goes to war” with
the stone. In doing so, he instigates another conﬂict
with most of the world of modern sculpture. Unlike
most contemporary sculptors, Dr. Smith chooses to
work in a style called “direct carving.” This means
that in the true tradition of Michelangelo, the good
doctor goes at his beloved blocks of raw stone with
only his hands, a chisel and a hammer (although
sometimes he uses a drill too.)

Dr. Smith is, however, not unused to working
with his hands. After the service of a “year that
seemed like ﬁve” in the Vietnam War, Smith went to
college. There he majored in biology and chemistry.
He eventually attended George Washington Univer-
sity Medical School to become a privately practicing
plastic surgeon. Both the resolve he learned from the
army discipline of Vietnam and the scientiﬁc back-
ground he acquired through his medical practice are
highlighted in his work.

Smith, whose new show opened Saturday in the
Williams Gallery, describes sculpture as “a compo-
sition of lights, darks, form and textures.” This tenet
adds to his unique idea that “art should seduce you to
touch.” Dr. Smith explains that touching stimulates
physiological impulses otherwise lost in the view-
ing experience. His dual philosophy is a reﬂection
of a measured, deeply scientiﬁc approach to sculp-
ture and art in general. For Dr. Smith every facet of
his work is crucial; every detail of light’s elaborate
dance on his surfaces must be calculated.

His surgical style does not, however, prevent the
depiction of romantic and at times sentimental sub-
jects. Smith himself cites “the disturbing” and “the
emotional” as among his major themes. Included in
his sources he lists the proto-expressionist master Van
Gogh and the enigmatic El Greco. There is certainly
an evident measure of emotion and intrigue in many
of his works. This is especially true of the bronze
works Deprivation and African Cruciﬁx. Some of
his most stimulating work includes his “body knot”
series represented in our show by Embrace After
Schatz and The Temple. Other subjects range from
poignant depictions of the African-American eman-
cipation to the trials of love and courtship.

Ken Smith’s captivating personality and scientif-
ic erudition give his work a unique ﬂare and signiﬁ-
cance. His obvious talent as a craftsman makes his
work pleasurable for anyone. His show is entitled
“A different path, a different view.” This title refers
to both his personal history and the distinctiveness
of his work. The exhibit at the Williams Gallery in
Huntley Hall will last until January 15 and is cer-
tainly not a show to miss.

  9/11 still felt At 99“,

Washington and Lee community remembers

ana’ mourns the anniversary of September 11

By Mlchele Farquharson
STAFF WRITER

This past Tuesday was the
sixth anniversary of the terrorist
attacks on the United States. At
noon a small ten minute service
of remembrance, presided over
by Burr Datz, was held in the
Robert E. Lee Chapel. To my
great surprise out of the seven-
teen hundred people that attend
Washington & Lee only seven-
teen attended this service. And
to my embarrassment, if I had not
been assigned to write this article
I would not have checked campus
notices to see if a service was be-
ing held. Some people saw the
service ‘advertised but couldn’t
attend because of class. Others
didn’t realize it was Sept. 11 until
they wrote the date on their pa-
pers.

When Burr Datz asked us to
bow our heads in silence to re-
member those who died in the at-
tacks I found myself thinking back
to that day and how even now I
can re-live almost every moment
as if it just happened. How, as my
friends and I entered our history
class, we saw the newsreel play-
ing on the television and thought
it was a movie, like Independence
Day or King Kong. Then the
ﬁrst tower fell and all the televi-
sions in my school were turned
off. They didn’t let us watch be-
cause students’ parents worked in
D.C., and in the Pentagon. But
we didn’t have to; we could hear

the airport!

the ﬁghter jets ﬂying to and from
Fort Meade, patrolling the air-
ways. My parents took me out of
school early and we sat in our liv-
ing room watching the events un-
fold. It wasn’t until I realized the
black specks falling off the side
of the second tower were not only
rubble, but people as well, that I
started crying and couldn’t stop.
Sept. 11 is the Pearl Harbor,
the assassination of Kennedy,
and fall of the Berlin Wall for our

moment when we stood united as
a nation to support the victims,
their families, and those who tried
to save them. It was the week
following the attacks when our
nation came together to grieve
and the world mourned with us.
France put it well, “Nous soyons
Américaines,” we are all Ameri-
cans. The unity I found when in-
terviewing members of our com-
munity was their remembrance.
They all remembered where

Sept. 11 is the Pearl Harbor, the assassi-
nation of Kennedy, and fall of the Berlin
Wall for our generation.

 

generation. The ramiﬁcations of
Sept. II have been massive, and
will continue to inﬂuence our
nation and our world. This is
where I was tempted. Tempted
to write about politics and the
national and global ramiﬁcations.
I asked teachers and students of
their opinions on the steps taken
after 9/ I1 and the war on terror.
I read through the responses and
agonized over how I could write
this article. Then I realized why
it didn’t'feel right to talk about
the division of our nation over
the war on terror. It’s not what
this day is for.

One of America’s greatest mo-
ments came out of Sept. 11. The

0 Notre Dame and Michigan still matter?

Nation is oldest rivalry still brings out fans despite teams ’ 0-2 starts

By hmor Nelll Thuparl
STAFF wmrzn

 rare event occurred this past
Saturday in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Actilally, the word rare may be a
bit of an understatement consid-
ering that this was the ﬁrst time
in the history of college football
that: both the University of Notre
Dame and Michigan University
entered their annual matchup with
an 0-2 record. Needless to say,
two‘ of the most storied programs
in college football, in one of the
greatest rivalries the sport has to
offer, took the ﬁeld Saturday in
the most unfamiliar of positions.

As the story goes, on a chilly
November afternoon in the fall of
1887, Michigan students traveled
to South Bend and proceeded to
teadi Notre Dame students the
garrie of football, thus beginning
their illustrious rivalry. Over
time, the Notre Dame-Michigan
game developed into one of the
most heated contests in college
football, with the bad blood be-
tween the players, coaches, and
schools growing incessantly with

each meeting. In fact, due to the
intense nature of the rivalry com-
bined with the brewing hatred
amongst the schools, the series
ceased its annual meeting for
over three decades on two sepa-
rate occasions. Once for 32 years,
returning in 1942 only to see the
game disappear again, this time

, for a 35 year hiatus, returning in

1978 for what is now an annual
ﬁxture on both teams’ schedules.
Subsequently, since the rivalry
renewed in 1978, the Michigan-
Notre Dame game has become
one of the premier events on the
college football calendar. Com-
bine this already fantastic history
with the fact that Michigan has
the all-time winningest program
in college football history, and
that Notre Dame remains a close
second in that regard, and one
could have a legitimate case for
stating that this rivalry supercedes
all others in college football.

In years past, the Notre Dame-
Michigan game has played a

large role in whether or not one ,

team moves on to a major bowl

game or even a shot at a national
championship. This year, how-
ever, there was no undefeated
season on the line or any national
championship hopes resting on
this game. Instead, it was a clash
of two titans ﬁghting for the pride
of their schools, and the satisfac-
tion of getting their ﬁrst win of
the season over a bitter rival.
While watching the pre-game
festivities on Saturday, I couldn’t
help but get goose bumps at the
prospect of seeing an instant
classic between Notre Dame and
Michigan in front of a packed
crowd of over 111,000 at Michi-
gan Stadium. The passion and ﬁre
with which each team emerged
with as they lined up for the start
of the game certainly didn’t give
off the impression that both teams
were 0-2. Unfortunately for Fight-
ing Irish fans, from the ﬁrst snap
it didn’t appear that any Irish eyes
were smiling down on this team
in Ann Arbor. The presence and
purpose with which Michigan
came out with truly set the tone
for their complete destruction of

the Irish. Before Notre Dame’s
freshman quarterback, Jimmy
Clausen, could get into any kind
of rhythm whatsoever, the Irish
found themselves losing turnover
after turnover to a swarming,
bruising Wolverine defense, led
by junior linebacker John Thomp-

This year, however,
there was no undefeat-
ed season on the line
or any national cham-
pionship hopes resting

on this game.

son. On the other side of the ball,
senior running back Mike Hart,
who earlier last week guaranteed
victory over Notre Dame, did ev-
erything he possibly could to keep
that promise by rushing for 187
yards and two touchdowns. Hart’s

performance allowed freshman
quarterback Ryan Mallet to settle
down in the pocket and ﬁnd his
groove, which led to three pass-
ing touchdowns for Michigan.
From start to ﬁnish, Michigan
simply seemed more prepared,"
more motivated, and more driven
to winning this football game, and
they did so in a most convincing
fashion.

A short while after the clock
wound down to double-zero and
all the fans had cleared out of
Michigan Stadium, I couldn’t
help but wonder if we had just
lay witness to one of the low-
est points in the rivalry between
Michigan and Notre Dame. Truth
be told, it was as if it was 1887
all over again and the Wolverines
had to teach the Irish the game of
football. 38 to 0 is no easy loss to
take, or even look at for that mat-
ter. For the third straight time this
season, Notre Dame had failed
to put up positive rushing num-
bers, let alone score an offensive
touchdown. The school whose
name is associated with some of

the greatest, most celebrated mo-
ments in college football is now
ranked ll0"‘ or worse in seven
major offensive categories. Their
0-3 record is synonymous with
that of schools such as Temple,
Northern Illinois, and Florida
Intemational. The words, “Play
Like a Champion Today,” seem
to be more wishful thinking than
anything else, and with the possi-
bility of a 0-8 start to their season
exceedingly imminent, one has to
wonder if Notre Dame lost more
than just a game on Saturday.

Head Coach Charlie Weis
said after the game that his Notre
Dame squad will return home and
start their season over as if it were
ﬁrst day of training camp. On the
brink of the worst start in the his-
tory of Notre Dame football, the
much ballyhooed leader of the
Fighting Irish hopes to salvage
what’s left of the season by start-
ing it anew next week against
Michigan State, and, for the sake
of Notre Dame fans across the
country, maybe that’s not such a
bad idea after all.

W&L 4 back with three consecutive
Rando|ph- wwins, defeating Sewanee-
the University of the
South, Randolph College,
and Randolph-Macon College. This past
week, the Generals commenced play in
the Old Dominion Athletic Conference by
defeating Randolph at home on Watt ﬁeld
and Randolph-Macon on the road. Thus,
the team is off to an auspicious beginning
in conference play.

From the outset of the game against
Randolph on Wednesday, W&L started
fast; junior midﬁelder Katie Corr and
sophomore midﬁelder Roz Klann netted
goals in the ﬁrst 13 minutes. “Anne [Van
Devender] broke away from the pack
towards the goal with a defender on her
inside. She outran her defender, but still
didn’t have a very good angle to shoot, so
I sprinted to the top of the 12 on the oppo-
site side, shouting for the ball, and Anne
passed it on the ground so I could run onto

Subsequently, forward Anne Van Dev-

_ ender put in two goals of her ovm. Finally,

Jackson, and into the right side of the net.
While the score was 5-0 at halftime, it
could have been a wider margin if it were
not for some tremendous saves by the

. Wildcats’ goalie, who collected 14 saves

in the ﬁrst half and 20 overall.

In the second half, the Generals con-
tinued their attack, scoring two goals in
the span of 13 minutes; one by Klann and

remarked after the game on the team’s
strategy, “[T]he midﬁeld and forwards
held onto the ball and attacked for most of
the game. We played three in the back to-
day and the defenders were still able to get
forward and help in the attack.” As a re-
sult, the majority of the game was played
on Randolph’s side of the ﬁeld.
Ultimately, the team was well balanced
in the 9-0 victory. Van Devender stated of
the team’s success, “Tuesday’s practice
was strong and that just continued into
Wednesday’s game. We were trying some

“It will undoubtedly be a challenge to better what we ac-
complished last year with an Elite 8 appearance, but we

tha Caulker. In the waning moments of
the game, at 88:06, Giordano scored her
second goal. One minute later, freshman
forward Karen Lambdin capped off the af-
ternoon by sending in a goal off of a pass
from Caulkins.

While the offense was exceptional, the
defense was equally effective, stiﬂing the
Randolph offense and not allowing even a
single shot. Senior captain Haley Bunting,

new things and I think the game gave us a
chance to really try them out.”

On Saturday, the Generals traveled
to Randolph-Macon for the second con-
ference game. Over the past ﬁve years,
Washington & Lee is 5-0 against the Yel-
low Jackets. However, this was a close af-
fair for much of the game. Neither team
scored in the ﬁrst half, though W&L
amassed 14 shots and ﬁve comer kicks.
While the Generals were able to control

the ball well on the opponents’ side of the
ﬁeld, they could not capitalize.

No team scored until 58:00 into the
game. Washington & Lee cracked the
scoreboard ﬁrst off of a Van Devender
goal that was unassisted. Randolph-Ma-
con responded with a goal of its own eight
minutes later by Brittany Jones; this knot-
ted the game at 1-1.

Strong teamwork by the Generals pre-
vented momentum from swinging back to
the Yellow Jackets and junior midﬁelder
Katie Kern headed in a goal off of a cross
from Van Devender. From then on, W&L’s
suffocating defense took over and pushed
the ball forward. Seniors Mary Clair Tum-
er and Diana Dozier slammed the door
shut with goals near the end of the game.
The ﬁnal score was 4-1.

Next up, the Generals head out of con-
ference for one game before beginning a
stretch of four critical conference games
over the next two weeks.

Coach Neil Cunningham said of this
year’s team, “It will undoubtedly be a
challenge to better what we accomplished
last year with an Elite Eight appearance,
but we have a group of players that are
very determined and committed to doing
everything they can to make that possible.
The chemistry is excellent and I have a
good feeling about this group; we may
surprise some people.”

“In overtime, every player must
play every position on the ﬁeld,”
said Merchant. “Possession of the
ball is key, and a turnover could
result in a goal quickly. Also, we
must capitalize more on penalty
comers because the odds of scor-
ing are much higher than in regular
play.”

In overtime, the Generals again
proved to be the dominant team,
rarely allowing the ball to leave
their offensive half. Just over seven
minutes into the overtime period,
Merchant found Korte off of a pen-
alty comer for her second goal of
the game, ﬁnishing the General’s
3-2 victory.

“The win was really important
for us as a team, because it is our
ﬁrst win on our own turf ﬁeld, and
last year we didn’t play to our po-
tential against McDaniel,” said
Armstrong. “we just tried to con-
tinue to work on the basics we em-
phasized during the week such as
marking and really shooting hard at
the goalie.”

The Generals return to action
when they travel to play Villa Julie
on September 22 at 2:00 p.m.

“Each of our runners who had
run the course before bested their
previous times by forty seconds to
one minute,” echoed Berry when
asked about the team’s perfor-
mance. “I can’t downplay what an
improvement this is.”

The men received some competi-
tion from Lynchburg College while
in New York. Lynchburg ﬁnished 9”‘
overall, ahead of W&L. After beat-
ing Lynchburg last week, tthe men
will hae to continue to work hard
in order to capture another ODAC
title, as Lynchburg was, on average,
one second faster this week.

“The only bitter point of this '

weekend was being bested by
ODAC rival Lynchburg, who
topped us by a narrow point mar-
gin,” said Berry.

“We had a good day, they had
a great one, and they got the bet-
ter of us. When the chips are down
at ODACs seven weeks from now,
I’m conﬁdent that we will be that
much ﬁtter — well prepared to de-
fend our title.”

The women will participate in
the William & Mary Invitational on
September 29"‘. This will be their
ﬁrst look at the regional champion-
ship course.

The men will continue their sea-
son on September 28”‘ at the Lehigh
Paul Short Invitational and on Sep-
tember 29th at the Virginia Military
Institute Invitational.

Prof’s lecture

attracts crowd

Scholar speaks on effects
of the South on hearts of
African-American writers

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

Professor Trudier Harris, this year’s Shan-
non-Clark guest lecturer, spoke last Thursday
to a packed house in Northen Auditorium.

As she began her presentation on her lat-
est book, “The Scary Mason—Dixon Line”, it
was clear that she did not need prepared jokes
to captivate her audience or a microphone to
make herself heard.

“There is this great, vast, brooding, welcom- ‘

ing and bloodstained land, beautiful enough to
massage and break the heart,” said Harris. With
these words she captured the subject of her lec-
ture, the American South, and the effect that it
has had on the hearts of black writers.

She made her case like a courtroom lawyer,
systematically and persuasively presenting the
knowledge attained from a lifetime of scholar-
ship.

Harris attended Stillman College inAlabama
and earned her Ph.D. at Ohio State University
in 1973. She taught at the College of William
and Mary until 1979 and went on to teach at the
University of North Carolina. She is now the J.
Carlyle Sitterson Professor of English at UNC.

In the ﬁeld of black literature, Harris is a
leading scholar.

She has written seven books on authors like
Toni Morrison and James Baldin, and she has
edited numerous anthologies.

She has seen black literature from Northern
and Southern perspectives.

But more impressive than her resume was
the complete ease with which she drew on the
literature, dissected it and made it accessible to
the audience.

Students and faculty were attentive as Har-
ris spoke of the fear that black writers have of
the South and their simultaneous attraction to
it.

She called the American South a “rite of
passage”—a terrifying, compelling subject to
be attacked and overcome.

She spoke rapidly and energetically as she
ranged over these themes.

After her 45-minute lecture, a reception was
attended by more than 120 audience members.

As professors and, students munched on
their cheese and crackers, they chatted in small
groups and waited for their chance to speak to
Harris.

Every reaction to her talk was enthusiastic.
French professor Mohamed Kamara described
it as “very exiting” and “amazing.”

Senior English major Dane Boston said, “I
thought it was very engaging and also very in-
sightful.”

President Ken Ruscio’s academic
proposal aimed at making Washing-
ton and Lee a national leader in liber-
al arts education has elicited diverse
responses from students and faculty.

The plan, if approved, would go
into effect at the beginning of the
2008-2009 academic year. Under the
new proposal, Spring Term would de-
crease from six weeks to four weeks,
and the graduation requirements
would drop from 38 to 36 courses.
Additionally, faculty would teach an
average of 5.5 courses per year, down
from six.

“It’s going to have a momentary
dramatic impact,” Ruscio said.

Compared with 24 of its peer insti-
tutions, W&L has the highest faculty
course load and the second highest
course graduation requirement. Rus-
cio said in order for W&L to establish
itself as a leader for liberal arts, these
constraints, along with the current
structure of Spring Term, need to be
modiﬁed. ‘

“I’ve been thinking about it al-
most from the moment I walked in
the door,” he said.

In decreasing the length of Spring

Term to four weeks, Ruscio said stu-
dents would take a single course that
is more focused and intensive instead
of two courses. When Ruscio came
into oﬁice a year ago, he said he did
not understand the current Spring
Term system. Now that he has a grasp
of it, he said he has little conﬁdence
that it will succeed.

“It would be irrespon-
sible ofme to waitfor
the chaos and pick up
the dead bodies. ”

KEN RUSCIO, W&L President

“It probably is only a matter of
time before it collapses on its own,”
he said. “If I’m really seeing that, it
would be irresponsible of me to wait
for the chaos and pick up the dead
bodies.”

In the past two weeks, Ruscio pre-
sented the proposal ﬁrst to the depart-
ment heads, then to the faculty and
ﬁnally to the Executive Committee,
comprised of students. ’

Though a general respect and ap-
preciation for the proposal’s inten-
tions seems universal, several faculty
members and students have expressed
doubts and concerns.

Junior Representative for the EC,
Rich Cleary, said he values the cur-
rent length of Spring Term, because
there is more time to develop rela-
tionships with professors.

“It’s the professor-student relation-
ships that has been one of the most
outstanding parts of my W&L expe-
rience,” he said. “One of my worries
is that [a shorter Spring Term] will
reduce and dilute and cheapen the
academic experience.”

Professor Kenneth Van Ness,
head of the Physics and Engineering
department, said the new plan will
affect his discipline, because there
are required major courses during
the spring. The proposal mandates a
four-week intensive course, but in the
Sciences, he said there is not a lot of
ﬂexibility.

“We still need to teach courses
for the major, or they’re not going
to learn what they need to learn,” he
said. “The six weeks is pushing it. I
don’t think you could compress itany

Mock Con gains momentum

Delegate fair sparks enthusiastic campus participation

By Allison Chopln
STAFF wrmsn

Students swarmed into Stem-
mons Plaza last Wednesday, greeted
by an overwhelming array of ban-
ners, chocolate chip cookies and loud
music. Student"-manned booths were
decorated with signs, and students
could peruse dozens of tables.

The Mock Convention Delegate
Fair was the last chance for students
to become participants in Washing-
ton and Lee’s Mock Convention for
2008.

Mock Con is held at W&L during
every presidential election year. Its
purpose is to predict the non-incum-
bent party’s presidential candidate.
Students participating in this year’s
convention will select the nominee
for the Democratic Party.

Oberlin" College in Ohio was the
ﬁrst college in the United States to

hold a presidential mock conven-
tion. The ﬁrst was held in 1860. Other
schools with similar conventions in-
clude Westminster in Pennsylania
and Loyola College in Maryland.
However, W&L’s Mock Con has been
praised by “Time”, “Newsweek”, the
U.S. Senate and others as being the
biggest and most accurate convention
of this type on college campuses. Out
of 23 predictions, the convention has
been correct 18 times. Recent years
have been extremely successful--only
one incorrect prediction has been
made since 1948.

The 2008 Mock Con will mark the
100"‘ anniversary of the ﬁrst conven-
tion, held in 1908.

The convention is a campus—wide
event. At Mock Con 2004, over 90
percent of the student body was in-
volved in some way. This year, the
numbers look even better.

“We are deﬁnitely well over 1500

students and looking to be on par with
the traditional 92 percent of students
involved,” said senior Tri-Chair Sara
Mueller.

“This is the last chance for
students to get involved with
Mock Con. We just want as
many students to participate

as possible. ”

KATE CHIASSON, Wlsconsln chalr
 

Wednesday’s Fair gave students an
opportunity to join the convention as
delegates. Senior Kate Chiasson, the
state chair for Wisconsin, explained
the importance of the fair.

“This is the last chance for stu-
dents to get involved with Mock Con.

We just want as many students to par-
ticipate as possible,” she said.

At any time between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. on Wednesday, crowds of stu-
dents gathered around tables in the
plaza to join the delegation for their
favorite state.

The chairpersons for each state
had assembled enticing displays to
advertise their delegations, complete
with state ﬂags, music and posters
proclaiming state mottos, history
and interesting facts. For example,
Maine’s delegation sported the motto
“Maine-iacs,” and the accompanying
poster featured a peculiar state law:
after January 14 of the new year, citi-
zens can be charged with a ﬁne if they
have not taken down their Christmas
decorations. What better reason could
one need to join the state of Maine?

Many students chose to join the

delegations of their home
states, or they signed up with
friends or chose a state that
interested them. The more ad-
venturous would-be delegates
could also sign up for U.S.
territories, such as Guam, the
American Samoa and the Vir-
gin Islands. Students could also
join the Democrats Abroad if
they did not wish tojoin a state
or territory.

“I wanted to be part of a
more southern state,” said
freshman Katherine Gould.
She is from Kentucky and de-
cided to join Georgia.

A number of international
students chose to participate.
Freshman Wendy Shang, who
is from China, signed up as a
delegate for Texas.

“I will spend this Christmas
in Texas, and I hear that it is an
awesome state,” she said.

I unior Grace Andrews, who
was born in Ghana, Africa and
grew up in Tennessee, chose
to serve as the state chair for
Hawaii.

“I chose to represent Ha-
wail, because I knew that I
didn’t know much about their
political background. I saw be-
ing the state chair as a chance
to learn about the islands be-
sides what l‘ve always seen
on TV. while having fun,” she
said.

New delegates can ﬁnd
many ways to get involved
with their delegations. They
can take up positions such as
vice chair or treasurer, or they
can assist in designing a t-shirt
or lloat or performing research.
Students can also choose to
simply attend the convention
and cheer on their respective
delegations.

“They can be as involved
as they want to. It’s up to them
as to how they want to par-
ticipatc.” said junior Michael
Gretchen, the state chair for
Louisiana.

Junior Riley Barnes, the
chair for Texas, explained
some of the responsibilities of
being a chair.

Chairs are in charge of su-
pervising the delegation. One
ofthese tasks is conducting re-
search on the state or territory
so that accurate votes will be
cast. .

W&L’s Mock Con will be
Jan. 25-26, 2008. “I’m excited,
because it is something unique
to W&L,” Gould said.

Prof’s lecture

continued from page 1

Marc Conner, an English
professor who teaches Afri-
can-American literature, was
greatly impressed by Harris.

“The lecture was fantastic--
so much energy and then such
knowledge,” he said. “I mean,
she mentioned about 30 dif-
ferent writers in‘/45 minutes.
That‘s hard to do.”

Conner was responsible for
coordinating this ycar’s Shan-
non-Clark lecture and gave the
introductory remarks for Har-
ris.

When asked why she was
chosen to be the speaker, Con-
ner said, “Particularly since
this is the third year of the
African-American studies pro-
gram, and literature is a big
part of that, we really wanted
to bring an African-American
literary scholar.”

Conner also said, “She is
easily one ofthe top 10 [schol-
ars in black literature] in the
world, and I would say one of
the top five.”

Art professor Pamela Simp-

, son said she hopes she inspires

lecture attendees to read the
books she references.

However, she said Harris
far exceeded normal expecta-
tions.

“It‘s also just the intellec-
tual enterprise of encouraging
people to think about the world
and the environment they live
in." said Simpson.

Spring Term
continued from page 1

Journalism Department Head Brian
Richardson said his program runs into
problems when faced with the require-
ments of being a nationally accredited
program. The accreditation insists that
students take a certain number of credits
outside the major, and with less courses
now offered, it leaves little room for
ﬂexibility within the department.

“It is a squeeze,” he said. ‘‘It doesn’t
leave any room left to take electives in
our department.”

Spring Term has become known for
certain courses like the Archaeology
Department’s Dig. Archaeology Profes-
sor Laura Galke said the Dig has been
around since the 1970s. She said it might
now have to be offered in the fall.

“Compressing a full excavation...
into a four week term would be chal-
lenging,” Galke said.

Though the course may no longer
be offered in the Spring, Galke said the
department is committed to continuing
the program. She also said the shorter
Spring Term would still be a prime op-
portunity for studies in ﬁeldwork.

Other faculty view this abbreviated
term as an opportunity to be creative
with course offerings.

“Teaching can be really fun in this
regard,” said History department head
Ted DeLaney. “It’s a real privilege to
be able to totally immerse students in a
single course for four weeks -- that’s not
to say that creating such a course will be
easy for everyone.”

DeLaney said this term would lend
itself beautifully to something like an
oral history project. ,

“In a discipline like history, creating

- a four-week long couse takes a lot more

creativity and imagination,” he said.

Although it will not affect senior
EC Vice President Jordan Campbell, he
said he likes the proposal and Ruscio’s
motivation. The idea of a four-week in-
tensive class to enhance the liberal arts
education makes sense to him.

“That’s kind of what the heart of
Spring Term was originally supposed to
be about,” he said.

Ruscio plans to let the ideas sink in
during Fall term, and then he wants to
take a vote at the end of December.

“It’s going to have to be supported
by the faculty,” he said.

Richardson said he thinks faculty re-
sponse has been positive.

“As far as individual faculty go, I
sense a fair amount of broad support,”
he said. “Whatever we do now, we’re
going to leave it the hell alone for 10

years.”

Cleary said he hopes the proposal
will spark discussion within the entire
W&L community. He also said at the
moment, he does not think there is a full
awareness of the proposal within the
student body.

Ruscio stressed, however, that stu-
dent feedback is very valuable to him.

“What I hope this spurs is a real con-
versation about academic life,” he said.
“I would welcome those kinds of con-
versations with students.”

With this proposal, Ruscio said he
hopes to ﬁrst shape the local conver-
sation about liberal arts education and
then begin to affect the national conver-
sation. .

“That is the bread and butter of-liberal
arts teaching,” he said. “I am convinced
that we have all of the ingredients.”

COLUMNIST ‘

You’re in the process of set-
ting up your fall schedule, but
there’s deﬁnitely one thing miss-
ing: your weekly dose of reality
and dramatic television.

That’s right, it’s time for the
fall television lineup.

This week, the ABC and NBC
networks will begin the premieres
of this fall’s new shows, as well
as some popular returning shows.
Now don’t get too excited. This
is your ofﬁcial disclaimer: I will
not guarantee that any of these
shows will be worth watching.

But sometimes it’s that train-
wreck TV show that just draws
you in. It’s ok! Everyone has a
guilty pleasure.

One season highlight is
NBC’s fourth season of “The
Biggest Loser.” This show airs
on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. as Days of
Our Lives star Alison Sweeney
guides 18 overweight contestants
through a competition to lose
weight.

The biggest loser implies the
person losing the most weight.
Clever, huh?

These contestants work out
on a consistent basis and are then
tested using cardiovascular activ-
ities. At the end of each test the

Powerful bombs, Cold War—like spying, and assassinations add up. for attempt to

it may not be a “Cold War”
but things are deﬁnitely chilly
between the United States and
Russia.

What was once a friendly rela-
tionship between President Bush
and Russian President Vladimir
Putin has warped into a tension-
ﬁlled stare down between former
foes and supposed allies.

Once again arms are a major
issue. While Americans were
pausing to reﬂect this past Sep-
tember 11”‘, the Russians intro-
duced the world to the “Father of
All Bombs.”

The bomb is meant to rival the
U.S.’s “Mother of All Bombs” as
the most powerful non-nuclear
bomb in the world.

According to the Russian De-

 

losing team eliminates someone;
the winning team is rewarded
with typical prizes, things like
letters from home.

Didn’t you know that limit-
ing contact with family mem-
bers creates a better atmosphere
for losing weight? Yeah, weird.
Well, I guess that’s why I’m not
a producer. I wouldn’t be able to
choose the correct type of bait.

However, this season there’s
a new twist! Maybe they’ll get
video phone calls from their fam-
ily members since we are in the
21*‘ century. So there’s a synop-
sis of “The Biggest Loser” in
case you’re like myself and have
never managed to see an episode
before. How did we live?

A new series that does show
some promise is “Joumeyman,”
airing at 10 p.m. on Mondays,
Main character Dan Vassar
changes the past for the better
when caught in a whirlwind of
time travel.

This may seem reminiscent
of the late 80s show “Quantum
Leap,” but don’t write it off just
because it’s a remake. After all,
the basis of American pop culture
and television entertainment is
the recycling of old ideas.

As a matter of fact, recycling
is a key ingredient for some of

fense Industry, the volume-deto-
nation bomb does not contradict
a single international treaty.

Some in the US are already
calling for the creation of a
“Grandfather of All Bombs”, po-
tentially leading to a non-nuclear
arms race.

The U.S. would probably not
be as wary of Russia having such
a powerful bomb if it were not for
the amount of spying that Russia
is taking part in.

National Intelligence Director
Mike McConnell remarked that
Russia and China have increased
their espionage activities in the
U.S. to “Cold War levels.”

“China and Russia’s foreign
intelligence services are among
the most aggressive in collecting
against sensitive and protected
U.S. systems, facilities and de-
velopment projects,” McConnell

the 215‘ century has taken on a
new form. It’s called the “if we

theory.

The immense popularity of
“Law & Order” yielded to its
re-creation through newer ver-
sions such as “Criminal Intent.”
Entering its l7“‘ season, it’s obvi-
ous that though a great show, the
“run with it” theory has deﬁnitely
been applied. It makes you won-
der how many crime scenarios
they can come up with.

Don’t be fooled into think-
ing that the “run with it” theory
only applies to an original show
that provides good ratings, such
as “ER” and “Scrubs,” both of
which premiere Thursday start-
ing with “Scrubs” at 9:30 pm.

Honorable man

To the Editor:

Honor is not dead at W&L.

Last Saturday I lost my pocketknife somewhere between the parking garage and the Commons——not just any
old knife but my father’s own, given to me and of considerable sentimental value (yes, philosophers do have

sentiments l).

Monday I went to Agnes Gilmore at the Commons desk to inquire if it had been found and turned in. She
said “wait a minute, there’s something in the campus notices.”
Sure enough, someone had found a knife and taken the time to post a notice. So I emailed, and eventually
we found a time when he could bring it by my ofﬁce: the lost was found.
Now all of this may seem like a small matter (though the knife means much to me), but I wish there were
some way of taking note of such honesty-—routine here, perhaps. but unexpected in the wider world. The stu-
dent’s name is Bobby Ray Martin.

This theory also lends itself
to shows based on once popular
movies - “Friday Night Lights”
and the very popular show “The
Ofﬁce" will debut their ﬁrst
episodes of the season as well.
I guess the theory holds some
water. if people liked it the ﬁrst
time, surely a re-creation of the
original ﬁlm in different scenar-
ios should also prove successful.
I wouldn’t have thought sob but I
guess this is another reason why
I don’t produce shows.

Bottom line, NBC comes
through with a re-manipulation
of old shows, movies, and reality
TV, much like what every other
network is offering.

Not only has the Russian gov-
ernment impeded the investiga-
tion, but the man accused of plot-
ting the murder is now the head
of the Russian Nationalist Party
and running for parliament with
Putin’s approval.

This doesn’t even cover all the
disputes.

Add restrictions on the press,
a weakening democracy, some
support for Iran, a vehement
stand against a U.S. missile de-
fense plan for Easter European
countries and you get a Russia
that is much more than a thorn in
the America's backside.

ls Russia preparing for war
with the United States? Chances
ofthat are close to nil.

But is Russia trying to reclaim
its spot as the second superpower
by once again positioning itself
as “pole” to the US? That is

Its a vicious cycle, but someone s gotta do it. Namely every major television network

with Cheetah girl Sabrina Bry-

Another “run with it” prod-
uct is the new series “Cavemen,”
following the popular run of the
Geico cavemen commercials. I
would anticipate a poor excuse
for a show but expectations are
high. Checking out an episode or
two probably wouldn’t kill you.

However it premiers Oct. 2
and will coincide with “The Big-

ABC actually has a pretty
good lineup returning with Seat-
tle’s favorite sex-crazed hospital
in “Grey’s Anatomy” and the
spin off“Private Practice.”

Back-stabbing housewives
reappear with “Desperate House-
wives” as it premieres at its usual
spot on Sunday night at 9..

All in all I would lean towards
ABC this fall for a consistent pre-
sentation of entertainment.

But in this age ofreuse and re-
cycle (usually a good thing), the
options are limited; I would ad-
vise giving everything a try. You

Good luck.

Ruscio’s grand plan

Plan to shorten Spring Term may threaten C— and J-
schools, needs input from both students and faculty

We’ll say this for President Ken Ruscio.
When he has a new idea, he certainly knows
how to make a splash.

Last week Ruscio proposed several chang-
es to the university’s academic schedule, in-
cluding a proposal that would shorten Spring
Term to four weeks. '

With students taking just one class in the
spring, along with a cut in graduation require-
ments from 38 courses to 36, Ruscio hopes to
lighten the teaching load of W&L’s profes-
sors. '

We’re not sure yet if Ruscio’s plan is the
best option for W&L’s future. But there seems
to be a deﬁnite need to revise the current
Spring Term if it is going to survive.

As Ruscio has said, students don’t under-
stand the current Spring Option.

And even if we did understand it, most
of us would rather be enjoying Lexington or
studying abroad.

Above all, students and faculty don’t want
another exhausting, drawn-out ﬁght over the
future of Spring Term. We did that, we fought
those battles, and none of us want to hear the
same tired arguments again.

Ruscio understands that, and that’s why
he’s hoping for a quick decision.

lf, as he claims, the current Spring Term
system can’t survive, then a quick decision is
exactly what we need.

Students say they don’t want to lose two
weeks of Spring Term. But four weeks of fun
in Goshen sounds a lot better than no Spring

Term at all.

And faculty members are worried about
how they can ﬁt important classes into an even
tighter time-period.

Still, with students taking only one class
each term, professors will have the ability to
schedule classes any way they’d like.

Maybe you’ll want to have a two or three
hour block each day. Or maybe it would work
better to meet three times a week for ﬁve
hours.

That’s one of the best parts of Ruscio’s

If professors in the Williams School decide
that they don’t like the changes, should we
still go ahead‘?

W&L is no longer just a liberal arts col-
lege.

Our journalism and business schools are
well-known and well-liked in their respec-
tive ﬁelds. As more students pursue majors
in those schools each year, the college and its
leaders must keep the needs of those schools
in mind.

This much, at least, is clear. Ruscio’s pro-

tion. And even if we did understand it, most of us would rather

plan. There is room for ﬂexibility.

Multi—day ﬁeld trips are suddenly possible.
Art students could spend several days in D.C.
or New York without worrying about missing
other classes.

But as Ruscio and the faculty consider
these changes, the concerns of various depart-
ments should not be brushed aside.

lfthese changes will hurt W&L’s ability to
maintain an accredited joumalism school, are
the changes worth it‘?

posal has sparked a broad debate that should
continue around the campus this fall.

Ruscio and the faculty need to pay close at-
tention to the opinions of students while con-
sidering these changes.

The president really gets the best of both
worlds. If his proposal is approved, he’ll be
happy-

But even if it fails, he’s managed to kick-
start the debate on how Spring. Term should
look in coming years.

STAFF WRITER

“Quiet in the house!” calls
Helen Coupe, Washington and
Lee junior and director of the
theater department’s third annual
Student Showcase. As perform-
ers rush in and out of rehearsal,
Coupe reviews the intended bill
for this weekend’s event. One
thi is for certain: The 2007 Stu-

‘ I de Showcase is something that

students will not want to miss.
Returning to the stage for yet

another round as Master of Cere-

monies is sophomore Markheav-

. ens Tshuma. Tshuma will also
be performing two acts in the

Student Showcase, one of which
includes a rendition of “Big,

' Blonde and Beautiful” from the

musical “Hairspray.”
“I like to think of this as the

Markheavens show,” said Tshu-
ma.

This year’s bill has ﬁfteen
engaging acts that range from

Reitz on guitar and a fun hip-hop
piece including sophomores So-
phie Xiong, Kenneth Hopkins
and Rasaq Lawal.

“The Student Showcase is a really special W&L

event, because its the only true talent show on

campus. Its a display of student talent without

all the stressful rehearsals and practice times. ’

Matt Amllng, class of 2009

monologues to arias and from
stand-up comedy routines to cho-
reographed dance pieces. The
line—up is also sprinkled with a
few student favorites like the V0-
cal stylings of Matt Amling, Eric

“With try-outs being held so
much earlier this year, I feel in-
credibly lucky that so many very
talented students came out to
audition,” said Coupe. “As a di-
rector, it makes my job so much

easier.”

The 2007 Student Showcase
will also be signiﬁcant for the
theater department since it serves
as Technical Director, Sha\vn
Paul Evans’s ﬁrst event.

“He has just been incredible
so far; we are so glad to have him,
and of course he will be working
on Othello and other productions
to come, as well,” said Coupe.

Coupe hopes that directing
this year’s Student Showcase will
pave the road for directing larger
productions in the coming years.

“I really want to prove myself
with the showcase so that I can
direct one of the three larger pro-
ductions for my senior directing
thesis,” said Coupe.

The Student Showcase will
be held in the Johnson Theatre
on Sept. 28th and 29th at 8 pm.
Tickets will be sold for $3 each.

and students who hope to attend
should call ahead to purchase
tickets since the show is expected
to sell out.

“Last year-we held the show-
case in the Keller Theatre and it
was almost full, so this year we
have two nights instead of one;
however, the Johnson Theatre is
substantially smaller, so students
really should call ahead to get
tickets," said Coupe.

While there are many oppor-
tunities for W&L students to get
involved in the arts on campus,
the Student Showcase truly is a
unique as well as a new tradition.

“The Student Showcase is a re-
ally special W&L event, because
it‘s the only true talent show on
campus,” said junior, Matt Am-
ling. “Its a display of student
talent without all the stressful re-
hearsals and practice times.”

Neville F ogarty discusses the trials and tribulations of the game show world

  "'°Wt° enter

By Kimber Wiggs
STAFF wrmrn

A few weeks ago, I found my-
self enthralled by the most exciting
gar. show 1 have ever watched,
including the ﬁrst episode of
“Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”
and any episode of “Jeopardy”

‘ featuring Ken Jennings. The show

was Merv Grifﬁn’s “Crosswords,”
and the contestant was none other
than Washington and Lee sopho-
more Neville Fogarty. Commons
345 was packed, as people from
all over campus came to watch
our compatriot in action. The

show did not disappoint.

The rules of “Crosswords” are
sinﬂe: answer clues to ﬁll in a
gia crossword puzzle and win
money. The show is a synthe-
sis of Merv Grifﬁn’s other two

gems: “Jeopardy” and “Wheel of .

Fortune.” The twist is that half-
way through the game, three new
people join with the objective of

' usurping the original contestants’

podiums. Time and again the
Commons audience booed and
hissed as Fogarty was unfairly
ousted from his winning position
by Pam and the “evil Scott.” I
admit I was nervous for our hero.

but Fogarty calmly revealed that
he was not worried.

 “I started playing a more risky
game,” F ogarty said. “I had my A
game in the front podium but my
A+ game in the back.”

Ultimately, the less worthy
contestants fell to the wayside as
Fogarty emerged victorious and
moved on to the equally exciting
bonus round. All in all he won
$3,450 in cash and a trip for 2
to Antigua; not bad for an hour’s
work.

Fogarty’s road to game show
stardom began at the tender age
of 12 when he appeared on an
episode of “Jeopardy’s” Back to
School Week. A few months later,
in the spring of 2001, Fogarty
appeared on an episode of Nick-
e1ode0n’s “Slimetime Live.” Just
last fall, Fogarty competed against
his mother and another man for a
chance at $100,000 in gold for a
show called “Gold Rush.”

Most people watching game
shows on TV think, “I’m smart-
er than those people. I could do
that.” Smarter, yes, but are you
also as personable, available, and
compatible with the interviewers’
needs? First, Fogarty had to pass

one of three written exams. Of
thirty people taking the test, seven
moved on, while the rest went
home with “nothing but two hours
wasted and tears in their eyes,”
Fogarty said.

Next, Fogarty sat for two per-
sonality interviews to make sure
he was not too shy or too crazy,
like the people who appear on

“If they asked me to do

[“Jeoparay”] again
but without any pay if I
win, I still would. ”

Neville Fogarty, class of 2010

“Deal or No Deal.”

After passing all the tests, F og-
arty was put into the contestant
pool for “later”, but he managed
to get himself put on an episode
the very next day: the fastest tum-
around the show has ever had.
Another thing that worked to his
advantage, Fogarty explained,

was that he was from out—of—town.
Because game shows often have
only one audition city, the major-
ity of people who appear on them
live in LA; failing actors who
need money, perhaps‘?

Coming from somewhere else
adds a little ﬂavor for the contes-
tant pool and is a good bargaining
chip if you want to be on a show
soon, because you need to go
home in a few days.

Fogarty has been making quite
a name for himself in the game
show industry. He even started a
W&L Quiz Bowl team with Su-
zanne Hange last year, bringing
his game show prowess straight to
campus.

Fogarty plans to audition for
more shows in the future. I asked
him why he does so many. One
would think the chance to win big
and be on TV would be a massive
draw. But he doesn’t do it for the
fame and fortune.

“It’sjust fun,” Fogarty said. “If
they asked me to do [“Jeopardy"]
again but without any pay if] win.
I still would.”

He said he loves the thrill of
the game, and he doesn‘t plan on
stopping anytime soon.

HFH lends a
helping hand

Habitat for Humanity brings students
and townies together through service

By Andrew Connelly
STA F F W R I T E R

As an international organization devoted to
building “simple, decent, and affordable” housing
that is celebrated throughout America and the world,
Habitat for Humanity (HFH) is a name you would
expect to hear more often around the Washington
and Lee campus.

Founded in 1976 in Americus, Georgia by Mil-
lard and Linda Fuller as a non-governmental and
non-proﬁt organization, HFH seeks to provide “a
hand up, not a hand out” and helps low income fam-
ilies build and own homes in their local area.

Built using a mixture of volunteer labor and
‘sweat equity’ whereby the family itself works on
site, the homes are sold to the families at no proﬁt,
with no interest charged on the mortgage. It has
been such a successful formula that HFH recently
celebrated its 225,000th house.

“Any new members this year will
be able to ﬁnd their niche. Just
being able to hold a paintbrush or
lay grass seed is great. ”

Claire Spadafora, class of 2010
 

The W&L chapter was formed in 1995 and works
in partnership with the Lexington/Rockbridge chap-
ter, helping to “educate and advocate” and get as
many people involved as possible.

This goal has developed into a rough delineation
of responsibility between the two sides, with the
students taking on a large part of the fund raising
duties and the townspeople leading the construction
efforts.

W&L raises approximately $25,000 every year
to fund the construction of one of the project homes
in the county, which cost $53,000 on average. This
year’s publicity chair, sophomore Claire Spadafora,
is eager to point out that this does not preclude the

students from taking an active role in the hands-on
work

“Any new members this year will be able to ﬁnd f

their niche,” she said.

In terms of new members, “we would love
anyone who is positive and able to get involved,”
Spadafora said.

On-site contributions can be made whenever
possible, ranging from several hours per week to an
hour or two per month. ‘

As far as technical skills are concerned, Spada-
fora makes it clear that enthusiasm and a willingness
to learn are the prime prerequisites. .

“Just being able to hold a paintbrush or lay grass
seed is great,” she said. “We always have experi- '
enced locals on hand to provide guidance.”

Some incoming W&L students have already
been given a taste of the work HFH does and of the
rewards that work can bring.

For the last six years, HF H has coordinated the
Lexington section of Volunteer Venture, the fresh-
man pre-orientation activities program that affords
incoming students the opportunity to take part in
charitable work in several areas in and around.?r»
ginia.

For the week before normal freshman orientation.
ﬁfteen freshman participants and six upperclassmen
leaders stayed on campus and drove out daily to
work on four homes in the nearby town of Glasgow.
Their work mainly consisted of outdoor landscaping
improvements, the bulk of the construction work al-
ready having been completed.

By all accounts, this “tuming a house into a
home,” as Spadafora put it, was something enjoyed
by all involved.

Junior leader Dana Statton spoke about her fI‘<,.Sl1-
man experience. “It was a great feeling to look back
on the week and see all that we accomplished,” she ’
said.

This year, W&L HFH hopes to construct four ‘
homes in the area and raise funds to help local it
families realize their dream of home ownership.

Wesleyan is second half comeback
hands W&L a heartbreaking loss

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee Women’s Soccer
team was 2-1 this week, defeating Greens-
boro College and Hollins University, while
losing to rival Virginia Wesleyan College in
a battle of two closely ranked top 25 teams.

Over the past three years, W&L and Vir-
ginia Wesleyan have engaged in ﬁve games;
all but one have been decided by one goal
or less. The Generals are 0-3-2 over that
stretch. Furthermore, Virginia Wesleyan
ended W&L’s season last year in the Elite
Eight of the NCAA Tournament on penalty
kicks.

Once again, the two teams treated fans to
an intense game. The teams went back and
forth until the Generals asserted themselves.
At 26:26, junior Anne Van Devender broke
free from her defender, but did not have a
good angle for her shot. Instead, she set up
Erica Girodano who managed to strike the
ball just past the Marlins’ goalie, Lindsey
Williams. '

For the next 30 minutes, neither team was
able to take advantage of the few opportu-
nities. Then at 57:53, Virginia Wesleyan’s
Laura Jackson stalemated the game at 1-1 af-
ter receiving a pass from Missy Kuhns. Just
15 minutes later (72:10), Jackson found the
net again for her second goal and the even-
tual game winner. W&L continued its attack
in the waning moments of the game, but it
did not translate into a goal. The ﬁnal score
was 2-1.

For the second time all year, W&L was
out-shot during the match and the result was
the same: a loss. The Generals had 12 shots,
compared to the 16 by the Marlins. Howev-
er, the biggest disparity was in comer kicks;
W&L had 4 compared to 10 by VW. Also,
junior goalie Kiki Moreo made 4 saves in the
effort.

On Sunday, Sept. 16, one day after de-
feating conference opponent Randolph-Ma-
con, the women faced Greensboro at home.
Greensboro, which plays in the USA South
Conference, entered the match with an im-
pressive 4-0-1 record.

At the start of the game, the Generals were
not able to convert on several opportunities;
the team was relentless in its attack but came
up empty. Neither team scored until the sec-
ond half and, in contrast to most games, it
was not W&L who cracked the scoreboard
ﬁrst. After the Generals were thwarted by
the Greensboro goalie, Shana Saganich, the

Pride quickly marched down ﬁeld and, in the
65"‘ minute, capitalized on a goal by fresh-
man forward Cassie Sheppard.

Consequently, team captains Martha
Caulkins and Anne Van Devender called for
a team huddle. The team emerged rejuvenat-
ed and knotted the game at 1-1 off of an un-
assisted goal by Van Devender at 76:57. “It
took a goal from Greensboro to make us re-
alize that we had to take advantage of those
chances we had been getting all game,” said
Van Devender. “In those last 14 minutes, we
just wanted it more than they did.”

Just eight minutes later, at 84:53, W&L
received a gift when the Generals were
awarded a penalty kick as a result of a hand
ball in the box. Freshman Roz Klann was the
recipient of the free kick, and she took ad-
vantage of the opportunity. Klann said of the
kick, “I approached the ball straight on and
kicked it a little left of center, and she dove
for it and missed it.”

Four minutes later, at 88:32, Katie Corr
managed to weave through the Greensboro
defense and score, putting an exclamation
point on the afternoon. The ﬁnal score was
3-1. .

After the game, Klann commented on the
pressure of taking the penalty kick. “There
is no better feeling than stepping up when
everything is on the line and coming up big
for your team. Everybody worked incredibly
hard throughout the game on Sunday, and I
love to take the opportunity to come through
for my team in big games. There was not a
doubt in my mind I wanted that kick.”

After a tough home game against Greens-
boro, the Generals traveled to play Hollins
University in nearby Roanoke on Wednes-
day. While the previous game was tight

' throughout, this match was not.

Thirty seconds into the game, freshman
Laura Youngmeyer scored off of a pass from
Katie Kern. This goal set the tempo for the
afternoon as W&L amassed a staggering 7-0
halftime lead. In the second half, the team
continued the onslaught by adding two more
goals in the 9-0 victory.

In total, W&L compiled 36 shots com-
pared to one by Hollins. In the effort, Van
Devender, Caulkins and Taylor Garrett each
had two goals a piece.

Washington & Lee now has a 5-2 overall
record and is 3-1 in conference play. Next
week, the Generals face two more confer-
ence opponents: Bridgewater College at
home and Emory & Henry College on the
road.

Dodd is hat trick and stifling   

defense lead to 5-0 victory

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

The men’s soccer team opened ODAC play
this week, traveling to Lynchburg to take on the
Hornets Wednesday evening and

s°°"°5 hosting Guilford on Saturday.
W&L 5 The Generals battled Lynchburg

to a 0-0 double overtime draw
Guilford O

and routed the Quakers 5-0.

The Generals were ranked
fourth in the ODAC Coaches Preseason Poll,
trailing preseason favorite Roanoke, Virginia
Wesleyan and Lynchburg.

“People are going to say that we are under-
rated, but I feel like fourth is very fair,” said
senior Ted Sheedy. “We haven’t earned a better
ranking with our past results. We can’t just sit
around and wait for people to give us respect; it
is up to us to show our worth on the ﬁeld.”

“I think that is about accurate considering
the seniors we lost last year,” agreed Junior
John Lindsay, “but I think we have the ability to
ﬁnish in the top three.”

During the Wednesday night match, the Gen-
erals out shot the Lynchburg 22-19 and earned
one more comer kick but couldn’t ﬁnd the back
of the net. Sheedy played all ll0 minutes and
had six saves for W&L, while Lynchburg’s
Marcus Jordan matched those totals in goal for
the Hornets.

“To get a point at Lynchburg is nice,” said
Sheedy. “But I am somewhat disappointed that
we didn’t get the win because I felt we were
dangerous and had several opportunities to
score.”

The Generals made sure to take advantage
of their opportunities during Saturday’s game
against Guilford. After about ﬁve minutes of
play, it was clear the Generals were the domi-
nant team.

Senior Josh Dodds found the back of the
net twice in the ﬁrst half and freshman James
Pymm added another goal with less than ten
minutes to play in the half to give the Generals
a 3-0 lead at the break.

“Getting the early goals helped us relax the
rest of the game,” said junior John Lindsay.

The Quakers best scoring chance came with
eighteen minutes to play in the ﬁrst half when
they managed a shot from the top of the box.
However, Sheedy was in perfect position to
make one of his two saves.

Fifteen minutes into the second half, junior

Tommy Pignatelli crossed the ball from the right
side, junior Whitt Larkin ﬂicked it on through
the box, and Dodds shot it into the back of the
net from just outside the goal box to complete
his hat trick.

Several times throughout the game tempers
ﬂared. With less than ﬁfteen minutes to play in
the ﬁrst half, Lynchburg defender Brandon Tay-
lor was shown a yellow card for an aggressive
tackle in the midﬁeld.

With about thirty minutes to play in the
game, Lindsay was carded for taunting after a
verbal exchange with a Lynchburg defender.

The most aggressive outburst of the game,
however, was by Lynchburg goalie Beau Ar-

“People are going to say that
we are underrated, but I feel
like fourth is very fair. We
haven ’t earned a better ranking
with our past results. We can’t
just sit around and wait for
people to give us respect; it is
up to us to show our worth on

the ﬁeld. ”

Ted Sheedy, Goalie

ceneaux. After senior Travis Short tacked on
a ﬁfth goal with less than three minutes to
play, Arceneaux, who had already having been
warned twice by the referee, unleashed a pro-
fanity-laced tirade against his defenders, cam-
ing himself the game’s third booking.

Sheedy was pleased with the game.

“All the pieces are in place, it is just a matter
of executing when it matters,” said Sheedy.

The Generals return to action this week with
two ODAC matches.

On Wednesday they travel to Randolph-Ma-
con for a 4 pm. contest, and on Saturday they
host Eastern Mennonite at 1 pm.

Generals improve to
2-0 with 35-2] win
over reigning USA
South Conference

’ champions Averett

By Brian Devine
surr WRITER

Part of the attraction of
watching a football game is
the heart-stopping moments
when it appears that no amount
of skill, strategy or determina-
tion can lead a team to victory.
Close contests provide a back-
and-forth thrill ride, and there
is little better than watching
two evenly matched opponents
take and miss their chances to
score up until the bitter end.

Just ask the dozens of Wash-
ington and Lee students who
made the trip to Salem for the
Generals’ neutral-site contest
against the Averett Cougars.
The defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champions
eked out a 35-21 victory over
their opponents, themselves the
title holders in the USA South
Conference. Salem Stadium,
the venue for the NCAA Divi-
sion lII football championship
game, hosted the two titans as a
beneﬁt for Habitat for Human-
ity. The vocal crowd watched

rushing. Luby in particular had
a stellar night, with 14 tackles,
several of which would be best
described as “bone-crunching.”
Matteo sacked Averett quarter-
back Shan Fairbanks twice, and
Fulk was his usual dominant
self, credited with nine tackles
but also drawing two key false
start calls fromthe Averett of-
fensive line.

When Fairbanks wasn’t
becoming acquainted with the
Salem Stadium artiﬁcial turf,
he played well, passing for
209 yards and one touchdown.
Fairbanks was especially effec-
tive when throwing to wideout
Antonio Hammond (5 catches,
45 yards). Later in the contest,
the W&L secondary stepped up
their coverage, and before long
Fairbanks was throwing most-
ly short passes to his running
backs. Averett’s giant fullback
Brian Daniels had the Cougars’
ﬁnal touchdown but was other-
wise limited.

W&L’s rushing attack, lim-
ited early on by ineffective
play-calling that saw rushers

“[W&L has] some of the best fans in Divi-
sion III. [They] make it really fun to play. ”

KYLE HARVEY, Senior linebacker

a game that was much closer
than the two-touchdown mar-
gin of victory indicates.
Averett had a 21-20 lead
with 4:37 to go in the third
quarter but failed to score again.
The Generals’ vaunted defense
had difficulty containing the
Cougars in the early stages
but held them when it counted
most. The game unfolded at a
slower-than-usual pace, thanks
to the defensive play from both
sides, several injuries on both
teams -- none serious -- and a
refereeing crew that seemed to
stop play for no reason. Safety
Kyle Luby, linebacker Bryant
Fulk and defensive end Tommy
Matteo, the hard-hitting pil-
lars of W&L’s defense, held
the Cougars’ highly-touted
offense to just 79 total yards

Tom Pacicco and Stuart Sitter-
son often swarmed at the line,
changed focus in the second
quarter to great effect. Instead
of pulling blockers to the out-
side and running horizontally,
Pacicco began running down-
ﬁeld straight from the handoff.
The offensive line’s run block-
ing was excellent, and Pacicco
ended with 179 yards and 2
touchdowns on 27 attempts.
Sitterson also added the Blue-
and-White’s go-ahead touch-
down in the fourth quarter and
caught R.J. Vamer’s pass on
the two-point conversion to put
the Generals up 28-21.

Varner had a mixed game,
throwing two touchdown pass-
es to Jack Martin but also losing
two fumbles in the ﬁrst quarter.
He ﬁnished ll-for-23 with 193

yards and an interception that
was returned for the Cougars’
ﬁrst touchdown.

The Cougars seemed to
have done their homework and
rarely left the always-danger-
ous Martin in single cover-
age after the ﬁrst touchdown,
which came just a minute into

' the game.

Even with help, comerback
Calvin Hall had trouble con-
taining Martin, who simply
outjumped him to catch his
second score.

The loyal and vocal W&L
supporters took to chanting
“Heisman” for Martin, who
ﬁnished the game as the Blue-
and-White’s all-time career re-
ceiving leader. The record, set
by J .T. Malatesta, a 1999 grad-
uate, was 2,312 yards. Martin
now has 2,403 in his college
career and has seven regular-
season games remaining to add
to his lead.

His big-play capability,
along with the sheer power of
Pacicco and the hard-nosed
play of Luby, enthralled the
W&L supporters that made
the trip to Salem. “[W&L has]
some of the best fans in Divi-
sion IlI,” said linebacker Kyle
Harvey after the game. “[Theyl

make it really fun to play.”

Fan support may have been
just what was needed to take
the team through those heart-
stopping moments and on to
close victory. If the team is to
reach their goals and win the
conference for the second year
in a row, they may need it a few
more times.

Five of the seven Washington and Lee
students who were international interns for
the Shepherd Poverty Program spoke about
their experiences in Ghana, Tanzania, Po-
land, Peru and Brazil last Thursday night in
the Commons.

Presenters included seniors Angela
Young, Katelyn Finley, Katherine Chiasson,
Nicole Merrullo and junior Eugina Huang.
Each spent eight weeks in a foreign country
living with local families and interning for
organizations that provide day care, health-
care and education to the needy.

dents chose to explore poverty on an inter-
national level.

Young, who worked in Tanzania, said
she chose an internship abroad “not because
poverty here is non—existent. I just think it’s
so much more drastic in other places that I
just wanted to be there.”

All ﬁve interns observed poverty ﬁrst-
hand and found ways to help, which is the

purpose of the Shepherd Program.

“Everyone was sick, and half of them
had malaria,” said Chiasson, who served at
a public hospital in Ghana.

She noted that healthcare is accessible to
everyone, but sanitary practices are lacking
and work ethic is low. She said that none of
the nurses wore gloves and had little concern
for their patients’ conditions.

Although AIDS, sickness and death char-
acterize life in Ghana today, Chiasson is op-
timistic and believes the situation will only
improve through a greater level of educa-
tion.

Ruscio’s proposal

N X Washington Terms to continue
despite shorter Spring semester

By Dane Davls
STAFF wnmzn

Washington Term and New York Term will likely continue to
be six weeks long, despite recent proposed changes in Spring Term
duration.

At information sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday of last
week, politics professors William Connelly and Mark Rush told
students that both programs have been grandfathered in and would

remain six weeks long despite a potential four-week’ Spring Term.

The announcements come aﬁer concerns over the viability of
the two six—week programs in light of President Ken Ruscio’s new
proposal for the term.

Ruscio’s plan is to shorten spring term from six weeks to four
and decrease the number of courses professors are required to
teach per year. However, with both Washington Term and New
York Term lasting at least six weeks, some questioned the compat-
ibility of a four-week term with the two internship programs.

Both the Washington Term and New York Term combine in-
tense internships in politics and business with equally intensive
classes.

At the Washington Term meeting, Connelly said that “Having a
four-week Washington Term Program wouldn’t be possible. Most
internship sites are reluctant to take students for six weeks, let
alone four."

Connelly went on to say that it was the students who would
determine whether the internship program would continue. When
Connelly conducted an impromptu survey of whether students
would remain interested if the program required them to be in
class two weeks after summer vacation began, the results were
overwhelmingly positive. Only a few were reluctant to accept that
added burden.

Junior Rich Cleary, the Washington Term’s work study, said,
“The presence of Professor Connelly amidst the ﬁeld of applicants
probably skewed those results.”

Cleary also said, “The issue would be to students—[if] they are

Students for Life localize national ‘4O days’ movement

W&L community members gather in library to pray for abortion victims, coordinate activities to increase awareness

VOLUME GXI, NUMBER/3/4.

 

By Alllson Chopln
surr wmren

Wednesday marked the ﬁrst day of
a nationwide pro-life movement called
40 Days for Life. This campaign aims
to spread awareness about pro-life is-
sues, bring prayers and healing to those
who have been affected by abortion
and eventually bring an end to all abor-
tions.

The Students for Life organization
at Washington and Lee has been re-
sponsible for bringing the movement to
Lexington. Last Wednesday at 10 p.m.,
nine students gathered in the Sacred
Space room, a newly consecrated reli-
gious meeting place in the library, for
reﬂection and prayer. Students for Life
is the ﬁrst organization to reserve this
space for a speciﬁc religious purpose.

“If you are religious, you believe
that prayer makes a difference. Prayer
also brings people together,” said senior
Jameson Graber, president of SFL.

Graber led the group in opening and
closing prayer, and sophomore secre-
tary Jessica Makona read a devotion.

SFL members will continue to meet
every night of the 40 days for prayer
and meditation. Meetings are open to

paign also‘ encourages peaceful vigils
and educational community efforts.
SFL plans to hold a community-wide
vigil on campus at the conclusion of
the 40 days on Nov. 4, and the group
may also attend a vigil to be held at an

all students and faculty.

“I personally plan to be there every
night to pray for the victims of abor-
tions, both women and children,” said
Graber.

Prayer and fasting are one compo- ,

nent of 40 Days for Life, but the cam-

abortion clinic.

A grassroots effort to increase
awareness will also be launched. Fly-
ers and informational posters will soon
appear around campus, and SFL will
be working with local churches and
schools for educational purposes and

to coordinate donation drives to collect
diapers and baby clothing.

These donations will go to pregnan-
cy clinics such as ComfortCare Wom-
en’s Health in Staunton, Va.

“The ﬁrst step is to create aware-
ness,” Makona said. “It’s hard work,
but we have to start somewhere.”

The month of October is also Re-
spect Life Month, during which pro-life
supporters honor the belief that human
life is sacred and should be protected at
all times, from the moment of concep-
tion until natural death.

Students for Life plans to coordi-
nate other activities throughout the
year. Members plan to donate time and
money to pregnancy centers, hospices
and other pro-life efforts.

They will also continue to post
weekly “factoids” about abortion and
other issues around campus, even after
40 Days for Life has concluded.

“Reaching out to other people
spreads the effect,” said freshman Alex

Sweetser. “Maybe it will reach some-
one in the situation, and then it will be
saving a life.”

SFL members believe that their
cause is inherently important to W&L.
“Our mission is crucial to any college
campus,” Graber said.

“Fiﬁy-two percent of abortions hap-
pen to college-age women, so the de-
bate is important here. People are un-
sure of their stance on this issue, and it
is disastrous to be undecided.”

After just a few days, the national
40 Days for Life campaign has already
created results.

According to David Bereit, the na-
tional campaign director, word has
been received that several abortion
clinics and Planned Parenthood loca-
tions around the country have closed
or stopped operating in cities where the
peaceful vigils are taking place.

SFL members at W&L hope to echo
these efforts and bring the effects closer
to home.

even though school would

That same dilemma
faces the students applying
to the New York Term. At
the Wednesday information
meeting for the program,
Rush and business and ad-
ministration professor Kip
Pirkle did not mention the
potential changes to spring
term.

Instead, they focused on
the advantages of having a
six-week internship before
most college students are
free for the summer. The
early experience gained is
invaluable not only for the
rest of the summer, but also
for future job prospects.

Students, though, seem
to be willing to sacriﬁce two
weeks of summer for the op-
portunities both programs
afford. Over 70 students
turned out for the New York
meeting, and about 30 came
to the Washington Term
meeting.

Despite any potential
changes, the values and
skills gained from both pro-
grams still remain. Cleary,
speaking of Washington
Term, said, “You examine
as a class the various ex-
periences in Washington.
It really makes for a great
cross-pollinating intellectual
experience.”

tains showed her that poverty is
relative: “ They wake up early,
ﬁnish the day’s work, take a little
siesta, and spend the rest of the
day drinking to celebrate some
patron saint. And who’s to say
that’s poor?”

Merrullo interned in Rio, Bra-
zil, where she lived on the edge
of the “ﬂavelas,” the steep hill-
side communities featured in the
movie “City of God.” She said
most residents would not want to
live anywhere else despite a lack
of plumbing, running water and
electricity.

Merrullo worked with children

under four in a daycare center. _

 

 

Most of the children had never
left the ﬂavelas, so she took a
group to the zoo across town. “It
was amazing just watching their
reactions,” she said. “It was such
a new thing for them.”

Juniors Julie Peterson and Ali-
sha Laventure interned in Nica-
ragua and Peru, respectively, but
they are studying abroad this term
and were unable to make presen-
tations.

The Shepherd Program also
offers a variety of domestic in-
ternships in ﬁelds like education,
law, journalism and healthcare.
Fran Elrod, Coordinator for the
Shepherd Alliance, encourages
students to contact her if they are
interested in applying for either
domestic or international intern-
ships in the future.

' Real world versus Lex Vegas

Swiping home all your needs for four years is handy, but it doesn’t translate well when we leave W&L

By Grace Andrews
C0 LU M N l ST

W&L can make us oblivious to
how people live in the real world.
You’re probably saying to your-
self at this exact moment, “what
does that mean?”

Let’s start with the habit peo-
ple in our school have of leaving
valuable items, such as wallets,
jackets, and shoes in any locale
that they wish and then posting a
campus notice when they realize
that these items are gone.

In the real world, when you
leave something in a public place,
what usually happens after that is
called theft. '

For those of you readers shak-
ing your head in disbelief, I am
speaking from personal expe-
rience. Just two weeks ago, I
ﬂew home for the weekend and
removed my rings to wash my
hands in an airport bathroom. I,
of course, forgot the rings on the
sink counter and did not realize I
did so until I was out of the check
point.

By the time I had gotten a

void ticket to go back to the wait-
ing area and the ladies’ room, the
rings were gone. I enforced the as-
sistance of the nice maintenance
woman, who did her best to page
her colleagues, but to no avail. I
even reported it to Nashville air-
port lost and found. The rings I
lost had very little monetary value
but were absolutely priceless in
sentimental value, making them
irreplaceable.

See, I’ve done that before on
campus, but of course no one
touched them and I was able to
rescue them for the same spot
in which I abandoned them. So
what’s the lesson? Don’t leave
your stuff lying around, even if
this is W&L; don’t be testing that
Honor System.

Second, let’s explore the topic
of people not locking their room
doors or car doors. You see, this
is what I’ve called “small-town
syndrome.” In smaller towns, like
the one I grew up in, people leave
everything unlocked and then
act confused when they ﬁnd out
things are missing.

I know that prior to stepping on

campus, I was lock-happy. I was
what you may call a lock-a—holic.
I’d lock things that there weren’t
even keys for. Arriving at W&L
three years ago, I was shocked
to learn that no one locked their
doors, except for those amongst
us whom we quickly began to call

or safe for you to do so; here all
we do is leave things wide open.
Students on this campus also
have the desire to put themselves
in unsafe situations, say like
walking to your apartment at 3
a.m. all alone, despite the fact that
you live somewhere that involves

In smaller towns, people leave everything

unlocked and then act confused when they ﬁnd

out things are missing. Prior to stepping on

campus, I was lock-happy. I 'd lock things that

there weren ’t even keys for.

“paranoid” for doing so. Maybe
we should have been calling them
S-M-A-R-T, because that’s what
they are. When’s the last time you
saw someone in the “real world"
leaving something as valuable
as a car unlocked or their house
entirely unlocked, even if they’re
not home.

That’s right! You probably
haven’t, because it’s not practical

wooded areas and deserted trails
(yes, I‘m talking about Woods
Creek).

livery day, students who live
slightly off campus leave at un-
godly times with total disregard
of their personal safety. lt’s be-
cause at W&L, everyone has seen
or met everyone. Because we feel
like “we know people,” we have
no problem walking alone across

Cadaver bridge or going the back
way from the library to Woods
Creek. This is what some may
call DANGEROUS! In the real
world, we’d be snatched up faster
than a balding weather man’s tou-
pee during a hurricane.

Last but not least, lets us in-
vestigate the terrible ﬁnancial
habits some of us learn here at
01’ Dubyanell. You see the swipe
card on this campus is one that is
comparable to crack! Yes, crack,
the highly addictive drug. That’s
the only reason I can understand
for why people don’t carry cash
on this campus. Searching for an
actual dollar is like the crowning
of an overweight woman as Miss
America — never going to hap-
pen.

I myself enjoy swiping home
despite the fact that my parents
send me the bill or just remove the
money from my personal account.
You see, my parents don’t believe
in that swiping game and depend
on the fact that every cent I spend
is my own. That doesn’t keep me
from swiping, but instead helps
me regulate how much I swipe.

In the real world, the swipe
system is comparable to hav-
ing a credit card, except unlike
a personal credit card, your par-
ents pay the bill. Such a system
teaches people to swipe now and
worry later, which can translate
into independent adult life, but
result in what some of us like to
call DEBT! Debt is in no shape,
form, or fashion sexy and will
ruin your life.

So for all you swipe-happy
folks out there, get your life to-
gether and think before swiping.
I’m not saying don’t swipe at all,
but don’t be swinging that card
around like Jason does his chain-
saw

You see my friends, the real
world is very much unlike W&L.
Out there, people very rarely
give a damn about you or your
items and don’t respect tradi-
tions such as the Honor System.
For this reason, I implore all of
you to remember that when you
leave W&L, you’re leaving a
safeguarded community, and you
should exercise a basic knowl-
edge of outside world.

A fresh perspective comes to town

At a pivotal junction, freshmen can be pioneers forging ahead, deﬁning themselves

By Scott Graham Centorino
c o L u M N I s T

Very few moments in our lives
have the power to deﬁne who we
are. This is true, perhaps, only be-
cause such moments are so rare
and so testing.

Most of you have either lived
“the freshman experience” at
W&L in the past or are living it as
you glance at this ink.

All of us have come to under-
stand that the ﬁrst few weeks are
not so much days and weeks, but
truly one grand moment. It is a
separation from all things famil-

parents or home, but from our
previous world.

In fact, very little concretely
unites us as a student body. We
hail from so many different states
and countries, and are pursuing so
many different things here and in
life, that it is often difficult to see
how the wheels are turning on this
bandwagon of dissimilarity.

I do not mean to repeat the cli-

ches of “what divides us is what

brings us together,” or that our
diversity is our strength. While
these are both wonderful expres-
sions, they cower against the true
nature of our endeavor.

We are pioneers. What else
would you call a group like this
collecting to go on an adventure
together?

But the men and women on the
Oregon Trail did not pause during
times of starvation and bombard-
ment to note that their strength
came from the diversity of their
members. The crew of Apollo 11
did not stop during their mission
to the moon to remark on how re-
markable it was for them to have
come from different regions and
backgrounds.

In every case where challeng-
es were faced and met, strength

does not come from our diversity,
or from our division, but from our
strength to dismiss such differ-
ences and to ignore them.

The pioneers did not stop to
reminisce. They were in the heat
of a deﬁning moment in their
lives, where their own conditions
took a backseat to the ultimate
goal. To gaze around at each other
and marvel distracts us from what
we should be looking at - the road
ahead.

So what do we know? We
know what we are doing is piv-
otal. We know that others have
done it before. We know W&L is

“Controversial” speaker not to blame

Columbia didn ’t want to learn from the Iranian president, only to berate him

By Crighton Allen
C0 LU M N I SI

On Sept. 24, 2007, Iranian President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad spoke before a packed
auditorium at Columbia University’s School
of International and Public Affairs on the invi-
tation of University President Lee Bollinger.

Predictably, many people are outraged that
so “controversial” a ﬁgure garnered an invite
to speak before an audience of university stu-
dents.

While I too am upset about this, I quibble
with those who call Ahmadinejad “contro-
versial.” Controversy would imply a dispute
about the man, and there seems to be a con-
sensus that Ahmadinejad’s comments are vile
and that his worldview is highly reprehen-
sible. '

For those ofyou unfamiliar with this speci-
men, let me hit you with some highlights: Ac-
cording to Amnesty International, 210 people
have been executed this year in Iran, the ma-
jority by hanging.

According to reports by the Council on
Foreign Relations, Iran is a state sponsor of
terror and funds such violent group as the
Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Hamas, and
Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The commander of
U.S. force in Iraq, General David Petraeus,
reported this month that arms supplies from
Iran, including 240mm rockets and rocket
propelled grenades (RPGS), are contributing
to “a sophistication of attacks that would by
no means be possible without Iranian sup-
port.”

Judging by how he runs his nation, Ahma-
dinejad isn’t exactly the guy you ladies want
to bring home to meet the parents.

What he says is even more disturbing:
“They have invented a myth that Jews were
massacred and place this above God, re-
ligions, and the prophets”; “anybody who
recognizes Israel will burn in the ﬁre of the
Islamic nation’s fury”; “Iran doesn’t have the
issue of homosexuals.”

Quick recap of Ahmadinejad: He denies

the Holocaust took place, longs deeply for
the destruction of Israel, and regards human
rights the way you might a leaf. Yet, this man
was invited by one of Ameriea’s leading uni-
versities to give a lecture.

Let me be clear; he has every right to hold
these opinions, despite how loathsome they
may be, and Bollinger was within his rights
and power to invite him. That is not the issue
here, however.

If I comprehend the underlying concept of
a liberal college education correctly, a princi-
pal method by which one gains understanding
of the world and its workings is by engaging
in rational and civil discourse with another

Someone 3 mother or father is

dead because Ahmadinejad al-
lows his nation to overtly sup-

port terrorism. That Columbia
received this man with his

bloody hands is nauseating.

whose opinions differ from one’s own. In the
case of Ahmadinejad, his discourse can offer
neither.

The positions he holds in regards to Juda-
ism, Israel, and human rights are absolutely
untenable, and the president offers zero justi-
ﬁcation for his beliefs other than an occasion
rant of his perversion of Islam.

And lest we forget, Iran has ﬁnanced,
armed, and done everything else save actively
take up arms alongside the insurgents to aid
them in their quest to spread chaos and death
in Iraq. The commander of American troops
stated on the record that the insurgency would
not be at its current strength without Iranian
support.

Ahmadinejad is not directly culpable, but
American servicemen and servicewomen,
someone’s mother. father, daughter, son, sis-
ter, brother, wife, or husband is dead because
Ahmadinejad allows his nation to overtly
support terrorism. That Columbia received
this man with his hands sodden by American
soldiers’ blood is, frankly, nauseating.

The Iranian president merely accepted an
offer extended to him; the guilty party in this
circumstance is clearly Bollinger and the rest
of the administration.

During his introduction of the president,
Bollinger took multiple potshots at Ahma-
dinejad calling him, among other things, “a
cruel and petty dictator.” Bollinger used the
Ivy League reputation ofhis university to at-
tract the Iranian leader then pulled a bait-and-
switch, using his time on stage to throw in his
two cents.

If you feel that the man is a dictator with
“preposterous and belligerent" views, do not
give him another platform to disseminate
them further.

Also not receiving a free pass is the Dean
of the Policy School, John Coatsworth. The
day after Admadinejad’s appearance, Dean
Coatsworth was asked to justify the invita-
tion. He made the remark: “if Hitler were in
the United States and. . . if he were willing
to engage in a debate and a discussion to be
challenged by Columbia students and faculty,
we would certainly invite him."

‘ If Hitler is your go-to argument in a de-
bate, you lose, period. Also, the Hitler ref-
erence adds insult to injury the large Jewish
population of Columbia who had to stomach
the appearance of a man who calls for the de-
struction of their people just days after cel-
ebrating a holy day, Yom Kippur.

Ahmadinejad has caused enough suffering
in the world from far-away Iran. Inviting him
to America is nothing short of moronic and
offensive.

Bollinger should be ashamed and disap-
pointed; many in the Columbia University
family and America certainly are.

a great place to be.

After all, we have all taken
classes before; we have all had
to make new friends and adapt to
new environments. What is new?

None of us have taken class-
es here or lived here, or adapted
here.

Here is new. But here is now.

Years from now, if not next
week, you will look back at these
times. The upperclassmen read-
ing this are already reminiscing.
We will not see our ﬁrst frat party,
or ﬁrst encounter with our room-
mate, or even our ﬁrst class.

What we will see is truly

“the freshman experience.” We
will see a pillar of our nature, a
juncture of our own being on this
small planet.

Do not ask yourself, “How
much of this homework should
I do if I know the teacher won’t
check it? What should I wear
to the sorority dinners? or what
should I do when I don’t know
anyone at the D-hall?”

Ask yourself, “where I do I go
from here?”

Then, and only then can we
say we have lived “the freshman
experience.” Then, we can begin
to deﬁne ourselves.

The law school hoasts about
-Princeton Review rankings

Gir-

Are the Princeton Review ranl<;ings a valid source for as-
scsting college cha1'acteri:‘.tics? At \»’v’¢‘s’Ll-, the answer is appar-
ently “yes” and “no.”

The School of Law boasts on its website that W&L rates
li3=?h in the Princeton Review rankings for both faculty quality
student engagement: “The 2007 results placed W&L at the
top oftlie ‘Professors Rock (Legally Speaking)" category and
sixth in ‘Best Overall Academic ljxpericncc.”’

5-lowever, the College, for which W&L rates high in less
(lu.'il’éll)lC categories (“Lots of Hard siquor." “Lots of Beer,”
“l_.i;éle Class/Race Interaction,” and “Alternative Lifestyles
Not an Alternative’), still circulates a 2004 report attacking
the rankings: “The Princeton Review...is a perfect example
ol"..ni ill-constructed opinion stiijvey. Unfortunately, there is no
way of preventing this sort of cliicanery frorn being depicted
as '~-.!.:ience to the public.”

In other words. the university is for the /’rim:c/on Review
rankings except when it’s against them‘?

Someone needs to get the story straight.

The current inconsistency--touting a ranking system when
it's convenient and chastising it when it’s not——can only be rec-
ognized as opportunistic.

Surely, all methodologies for ranking colleges have their
shortcomings, and the Princeton Review’s is chief among
them. Yet,.,eitl1er W&L must accept the rankings (both the good

Until an honorable institutional decision is made, the Princ-

picks them for mere public relations purposes.

l tear Editors,

i read with dismay and alarm Dane Boston's attack on
WrS:.L’s Greek system. In the Sept. I7, Phi, this “sentimental
senior” provided the incoming freshman with “a few words of
advice as they begin their illustrious careers at Washington and
Lee.” After acknowledging the existence and importance of
tradition at W&L. Mr. Dane speaks with contempt of the many
“unfortunate elements of our institutions” that are allowed to
persist because students are “swayed by appeals to obscure
comepts of tradition.” Mr. Dane laments the probability that
these arcane concepts “limit this place“ in the eyes of prospec-
tive students. Dane goes on to declare that “if this place is to
survive and thrive in the years to come” these concepts must
be “addressed.”

for 150 years the Greek system at W&L has provided a
nieans for like minded men and now women to enjoy friend-
ships and make memories.

My own advice to the freshmen would include “live and let
live.” There are as many ways to go through W&L as there are
stmlents that have and will attend the University.

I agree with l\/lr. Dane - “this place will change you.” Be-
liei c it or not this has always been true. The Greek system is a
time-tested tradition that I believe is important to “this place.”

'l‘raditi0na change

Shortening Spring Term won ’t mean
less free time or kill the tradition of
frequently ﬂoating down the Maury

By Cody Beauchamp
c o L u M N I sr

President Ruscio is on to some-
thing.

If I’m any good at gauging the
zeitgeist, the student body met his
announcement that he wanted to
make sweeping changes to Spring
Term with mixed feelings.

I’ve heard a lot of people object
with horror upon realizing that the
beloved term could become shorter.
I’ve heard skeptics question wheth-
er or not the proposals to “tweak
the numbers” will do much.

But there’s really no reason to
worry, sports fans.

In the memo he sent to the fac-
ulty that started this current Spring
Term discussion, Ruscio actually
makes a good case for his changes.

He notes that Washington and
Lee’s academic structure “simply
can’t bear its weight,” and he’s
right. It’s virtually impossible to

fewer parties and less time. How
does that make sense? Obviously
the term will be shortened (by two
weeks), but since the class require-
ments are cut in half, it seems logi-
cal that the free time will double.

Also, as much as I love ﬂoat-
ing the Maury, I’d much rather hit
the beach, ﬂoat the rivers near my
house, or whatever. Getting out of
school two weeks earlier means an
additional two weeks when classes
don’t keep me within driving dis-
tance of Lexington.

Change isn’t something we do
well at W&L. We really are a rather
conservative schoo1—not political-
ly conservative per so (although the
prevalence of those Reagan/Mari-
lyn shirts is a little ridiculous), but
conservative in the true sense of the
word—we don’t change radically.

But sometimes we should take
a look around and realize change
is needed. I love having six weeks
every year to cut back with mini-

I love having six weeks every year to cut back

with minimal responsibility. But I also love the

fact that I ’m in a top-ﬂight college. Ultimately,

than get a really good tan.

keep our amazingly—low average
class size while at the same time
only hiring the most qualiﬁed
professors and requiring as many
credits for graduation as we do. It
doesn’t take the entire provost’s of-
ﬁce to ﬁgure that one out.

So what is the‘president’s pro-
posal? It’s a lower teaching load
for the faculty, a shorter term, and
a lower graduation requirement for
students.

The new plan would require a
5.5 teaching load for the faculty.
Don’t get me wrong; that’s still an
awful lot for what is essentially a
mini—mester, but it’s deﬁnitely a
step in the right direction.

The new plan would lower
the graduation requirement to 36
courses. That’s still high for a col-
lege of our nature—a liberal arts
college—but I certainly won’t
complain about a lower class re-
quirement.

The plan even grandfathers pro-
grams that are designed for the six
week version of Spring Term.

The complaint I hear the most
is that shortening Spring Term will
make it less fun, that there will be

mal responsibility. But I also love
the fact that I’m in a top-ﬂight col-
lege. Ultimately, I’d rather I gradu-
ate from a top-ﬂight college than
get a really good tan.

Ruscio’s plan for changing
Spring Term will give the school
the ability to not only remain atop-
ﬂight school but also climb even
higher in prominence. Ruscio calls
it being able to lead the conversa-
tion in higher education; the stu-
dents should call it better jobs for
graduating from a better school.

I’m a bit afraid I sound like I’m
the administration’s patsy; Lord
knows I’d rather not. But this time
I think they’ve proposed a policy
which will improve all of our lives.
Graduation will become easier
while at the same time the school’s

. quality of education will rise. Pro-

fessors will have more time to do
what they do best—teach. Students
will have more time in the Spring
to relax while truly focusing on an
interesting class.

It’s stating the obvious if you re-
ally think about it—President Rus-
cio is on to something.

Where were you Friday night? This past
Friday Pi Beta Phi and Phi Beta Sigma host-
ed a rockin’ dance party in the Commons.
Proceeds from the Dance-a-thon are going
towards the sponsorship of March of Dimes,
which deals with infant mortality, and vari-
ous local literacy projects. The Dance-a-thon
was particularly signiﬁcant because accord-
ing to one of the event organizers, “It is mon-
umental to have a historically black fraternity
joined with a pan-Hellenic sorority.”

This cooperation between traditionally
distinct alcoves of the Greek world surely
indicates both changes in the perceptions of
our students and the strong sense of general
community here at W&L.

What was the big deal at the dance? The
dance featured a six hour long, non-stop
danceoff, basically a dance till you drop bo-

This event not only strength-
ened the W&L community, it

nanza. Also included in the night’s activities
were raﬂies, dance prizes and special deals
with local restaurants and businesses. The or-
ganizers of the event feel that they were able
to bring the entire community together for
this event. Everyone from the siblings of vis-
iting students to Lexington shopkeepers got
involved. This event not only strengthened
the W&L community, but it also reinforced
our relationships with the area and the com-
munity of Lexington as well. We were able to
give back to the people who have so kindly
accepted us into their hometown through the
two philanthropic fundraisers; the people of
Lexington have been able to get involved in
a fun school activity. Since a good commu-
nity is one of the foundations of this school,
events like the Dance-a-thon are critical.

As one of the event organizers put it, “Ev-
eryone likes to dance!” Friday night was a
great time to boogey.

Women cruise to
sh utout victories

Defense allows just seven shots against Bridgewater
and Emory & Henry in ODAC matches this week

MICHAEL KEENAN / Sports Editor

Junior Katie Kern finds the back of the net during Wednesday's 5-0 win over Bridge-
water. Kern, who missed most of last season due to injury, has scored four goals In
the team's ﬂrst nine games.

By Hank Nathan
sun warren

The Washington and Lee women’s soccer team
rebounded in a big way this week.

After losing to conference-rival Virginia Wesley-
an, the Generals took out their frustration on confer-
ence opponents Bridgewater College and Emory &
Henry College.

“We knew after the loss on Saturday that we
needed to step it up this week,” said Katie Kern.
“We weren’t sure what to think about Bridgewa-
ter coming in, and we were missing some key for-
wards, so we knew that everyone was going to have
to work hard for each other.”

And the team did just that. Without team captain
and leading goal scorer Anne Van Devender, who
was out with an injury, the Generals focused on a
more team—oriented game.

From the outset against Bridgewater, W&L em-
ployed its aggressive style offense. Within the ﬁrst
two minutes of the game, the Generals narrowly
missed a goal after hitting the crossbar. Then, a few
minutes later, Haley Bunting put the ball in the back
of the net, only to have it taken away because of
an offside call. Moments aﬁer, Bunting received an-
other opportunity in a one-on-one situation with the
Bridgewater goalie, but the shot was just high.

Finally, 25 minutes into the game, W&L ended
its scoring drought. Kern ﬁred a shot into the leﬁ
side of the net off of a perfectly placed pass by de-
fender Marisa Van Brunt who was near midﬁeld.

“Marisa played a great ball across into the gap,
and I ran onto it, took a touch, and ﬁnished it,” said
Kern of the sequence that led to the goal.

Sixteen minutes later, at 41:21, Taylor Garrett,
from midﬁeld, headed the ball down the middle of
the ﬁeld to a seemingly wide open Martha Caulkins.
Caulkins broke away from the defense and shot the
ball just past the outstretched arms of the Eagles
goalie and into the right side of the net, advancing
the score to 2-0.

Even though they were ahead, W&L still strug-
gled to distance themselves from Bridgewater in the
ﬂrst half. However, the Generals opened the ﬂood
gates at the beginning of the second half, scoring
two quick goals, effectively putting the game out of
the Eagles’ reach.

Karen Lambdin scored off of a cross from Roz
Klann at 49:20, and Caulkins put in another goal off
of a deflection by a defender at 54:49.

Kern added in her second goal from a feed by
Caulkins as Bridgewater failed to clear the ball with
less than 10 minutes to play. The ﬁnal score was
5-0.

“We rebounded pretty well after the loss on Sat-
urday,” Kem stated after the 5-0 victory. “We just
have to keep working hard for each other and play
our game and we’ll be successful.”

W&L carried momentum into its next game at
Emory & Henry College on Saturday.

Van Brunt opened the scoring after putting in a
goal off of an assist by Bunting just four minutes
into the game (3:38). Ten minutes later, the same
combination hooked up again for another goal. This
ignited three more goals which were scored in a
span of 15 minutes, giving the Generals a 5-0 half-
time lead.

In the second half, the team added two more
goals, and the ﬁnal score was 7-0.

In the effort, Van Brunt and Klann each scored
two goals, while Bunting, Kern and Lambdin each
added one.

W&L compiled 32 shots compared to two by
the Wasps. Moreover, Emory & Henry did not even
have a single shot on target which was a testament
to the Generals’ stiﬂing defense.

W&L is now 7-2 overall and 5-1 in conference
through the halfway point of the season.

“We have made good progress from the ﬁrst
game of the season,” said Coach Neil Cunningham.
“Players have been very open to changes of forma-
tions and positions and have adapted well.”

Packer a deserving holder

that will take risks that no other
quarterback would by throwing
the ball into triple coverage late
in the 4"‘ quarter trying to mount
a comeback. He will still stop
at nothing to avoid going down
and instead ﬁnd an open receiver
down "ﬁeld to move the chains.
He does this because he can and
it is how he has been since he
first came to the Packers in ’92,
and that’s how it will be until he
announces his retirement from
the game.

One of my fondest memories
of Brett Favre was seeing him
throw a touchdown pass to An-
dre Rison in Super Bowl XXXI,
and seeing him sprint down the
ﬁeld faster than any other player,
hands in the air, with an expres-
sion of sheer joy and jubilation
on his face, not like a larger than
life professional athlete, but like

gardless of the situation. On
October 21, 2003 Favre lost his
father, Irvin Favre to a heart at-
tack, leaving him questionable
for the following night’s game
against the Oakland Raiders.
However, Favre did what he
thought his father would have
wanted him to do, and came
out on Monday Night Football
throwing for 399 yards and 4

. touchdowns in one of the most
memorable and emotional per-
formances ever in the history of
sports. For anyone who watched
that game or remembers seeing
Brett F avre speak after it, it was
hard not to get choked up think-
ing about just what Favre was
going through and how he over-
came such circumstances. Other
misfortunes that Favre had to
overcome included his wife,
Deanna, being diagnosed with
breast cancer in 2004 as well as
the physical injuries such as bro-
ken ﬁngers, sprained ankles," and
the everyday bruises and abuse
that comes with the punishment
of being an NFL quarterback.
Yet throughout all of the adver-
sity that Brett Favre has had to
face, he still continues to play
week-in and week-out, perform-
ing with the best the NFL has
to offer at a caliber that most
professional athletes couldn’t
dream of achieving.

Although in recent years
past, the critics have become
quite vocal and numerous in
calling for F avre to hang up his
cleats, saying that his time had
passed, nevertheless, this year
Green Bay is a perfect 4-0, sit-
ting in ﬁrst place in the NFC
North, thanks in large part to
Brett Favre’s management of
the game. However, the way
Favre manages the game hasn’t
changed the way, certain_.ana-
lyv  uld have’ you belT§%.
I e is stilt the famed giiiisliriger

Green Bay Packers quar-
terback Brett Favre has broken
Hall of Fame quarterback Dan
Marino’s record for touchdown
passes over the course of a ca-
reer this Sunday in Minnesota.

. Going into week 4 against the
Vikings, Favre had thrown for
420 TD’s and started in an NFL-
record 240 consecutive games
by a quarterback. Now, F avre
stands alone atop one of the
most prestigious records in the
modern day NFL.

Drafted out of the University
of Southern Mississippi in 1991
by the Atlanta Falcons, Brett Fa-
vre had a rough start to his jour-
ney in the NFL which led him to
be traded to the Green Bay Pack-
ers in February of 1992. After

“ three weeks in which in he saw
minimal but meaningful play-
ing time, in week 4 of the 1992
NFL season Packers coach Mike
Holmgren decided to start F avre
in place of then injured quarter-
back Don Majkowski. Little did
we know that over the next 15
years Brett Favre would become
one of the best quarterbacks in
the history of the NFL. During
his time in Green Bay, Favre has
won a Super Bowl, been named
the Most Valuable Player of the
NFL three consecutive times—a

‘ feat that no one has matched-
-and has become the all-time
winningest QB in NFL history,
notching 150 wins in his regular
season career and counting.

However, amidst all the ac-
colades and formal recognitions
that F avre has received, he is
probably most well known for
his passion for the game, his
charismatic leadership, indomi-

Q table will, and overall heart that
he demonstratesreach anekevery
time he steps onto t.l=re'ﬁeld, re-

game with the kids in the neigh-
borhood in his backyard. There
was something so sincere and so
genuine about him that I knew
that I was witnessing something
special.

Fast forward to the present
and Favre has just broken one of
the most hallowed records in the
history of the NFL. He is with-
out a doubt a future, ﬁrst ballot
Hall of Famer that has made
his way into the hearts of foot-
ball fans across the country and
must seriously be considered in
the debate of the greatest NFL
quarterbacks ever. And although
years from now Peyton Man-
ning may break Favre’s record
and rewrite the history books on
his own, Favre will be forever
remembered for the many gut-
wrenching moments in which he
overcame all the odds with his
immensely strong will and heart
,agt_l\._ unadulterated love for. the
 Tru"ﬂifully, 1 dovnjtjﬂiink

XC gains momentum

Kat Telfeyan leads the cross country team as it beats four

D—I teams; men get revenge on ODAC rival Lynchburg

By Kevln corn
smrr wmnzn

The Cross Country teams had
a busy week as the women com-
peted at the William and Mary
Invitational on Saturday, while
the men were at the Lehigh Paul
Short Invitational on Friday and
the VMI Invitational on Saturday.
The women took sixth out of ten
Division I teams, holding their
own as the only Division 111 team
present. The men took ninth out
thirty—nine teams at the Paul Short
Invite and lost by only one point
to VMI at the VMI Invite.

At the William and Mary In-
vitational, the women were once
again led by sophomore Kat Telf-
eyan who ran in 23:34 to take for-
ty-third out of 103 runners. Junior
Becca Taylor took sixtieth with
a time of 24:23. Finishing just
behind her in sixty-second was
sophomore Dorothy Todd, who
ran in a time of 24:28. Freshmen
Christine Balisterri and Katherine
Fenwick took sixty-ﬁfth and sev-
enty—ﬁfth respectively with times
of 24:41 and 25:31.

This meet was especially im-
portant since it gave the women
a look at the Regionals course.
Todd commented, “We were able
to familiarize ourselves with the
course so that when Regionals
rolls around, we will know what
to expect. Everyone on the team
really seemed to enjoy the course;
it was a great combination of roll-
ing hills, open ﬁelds, and wooded
trails.”

Furthermore, the women were
competing amongst SEC and
ACC schools. “It was a nice pre-
view of the course, and the large
‘ﬁeld of competitors made us not
only push ourselves but get ready

for the competition at regionals.
I was very proud of the team.
We’ve been training hard these
past weeks, and jumping in the
race with some big name schools
gave us some good experience,”
stated Telfeyan. Todd added,
“The ﬁeld was entirely Division I
with the exception of us, so there
were very fast girls in our race
that pushed the pace and pulled
us along. Being able to hold our
own against teams from the ACC
and SEC is exciting, so as a team,
we were very happy with our 6th
place ﬁnish.”

The men meanwhile took care
of business while at the Paul Short
Invite by outrunning Lynchburg.
Junior Michael Welsh led the
team by ﬁnishing thirteenth with
a time of 26:24, while senior Tom
Brower completed the race in a
time of 26:59 to take thirty-sixth.

Juniors Vance Berry and An-
thony Ives crossed the ﬁnish
line in forty-third with a time of
27:11 and sixty-eighth in a time
of 27:38, respectively. Lastly,
freshman Michael Shiplett took
106*‘ with at time of 28:05, senior
Andrew Friski ﬁnished in a time
of 28:16 to take 116“‘, and sopho-
more Ben Stutts ﬁnished 164"‘ in a
time of28:5l.

“Placing ninth was great, but
it wasn’t particularly signiﬁcant.
What really mattered was beat-
ing Lynchburg by 97 points and
Mary Washington by 115. We’ve
obviously taken a big step in ﬁt-
ness since NYU, and we’re glad
to see that paying off’ commented
Brower. Berry added, “We bested
ODAC rival Lynchburg by a sig-
niﬁcant margin, showing a marked
improvement from our last outing
at NYU where they got the better

of us. It’s been a hotly contested
rivalry this year, with the better
prepared team winning each out-
ing. We’ll look to hold this mo-
mentum through the ODAC meet
in four weeks.”

Also worth noting was Ives’s
breakthrough this week. Brower

mentioned that Ives “had the kind ,

of race which we need him to run
as our No. 4, plus the 29 second
PR (personal record) was pretty‘
incredible.”

Lastly, while at the VMI In-
vite, ran well with great efforts
from freshmen Jack Ivy, Robert
George, and David Doobin, soph-
omore Elliot O’Brien, and junior
Alex Jackson. Doobin commented
on the Generals’ ﬁnishes, “A lot of
us felt like our performance. . .was
exactly what we have been train-
ing for thus far this season, and
that if we can keep on performing
at that caliber for the remainder
of the season it bodes well. To
nearly beat VMI was largely un-
expected, and a pleasant surprise,
but it was never really our goal.
We just wanted to reach our rac-
ing potential and we thought that
VMI would be way out in front of
us.”

The meet was also fun for the
participants because those not
running cheered on their team-
mates with entertaining signs,
such as “go elliott, ﬂy like a kiwi,”
a phrase that can be attributed to
freshman Davis Franklin. O’Brien
reported the race was even started
with a cannon.

The men will next be in action
October 13 as they participate in
the William & Mary Invitational,
while the women will compete

the same day at the DeSa1es Invi-.

tational.

FH hangs on for win

Womenlopen ODAC schedule with win over Randolph-Macon

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

After losing a double overtime heart-
break to No. 11 Johns-Hopkins University
last Sunday, the Generals began confer-
ence play Friday night by defeating Ran-
dolph-Macon College 3-2 on Friday night

in a hard-fought game.

s°°'°s In the preseason ODAC
w&l_ 3 coaches poll, the Generals
R_MC 2. ranked second to Lynch-

burg by just one ﬁrst-place

vote. R-MC entered the
season ranked a distant fourth. For the
ﬁrst few minutes of Friday night’s game,
it appeared the rankings should have been
reversed.

R-MC got off to a quick start when
freshmen Mary McCarthy scored an unas-
sisted goal less than three minutes into the
game, causing an eruption of cheers and
optimism from the visitor’s bench.

“They were ready for this game and
really wanted it badly,” said senior Laura
Nugent. “They were absolutely intent on
beating us.”

“Their ﬁrst goal was a wake-up call,”
said sophomore Caroline Habliston.

It didn’t take long for the Generals to
wake up, though. Just 76 seconds later ju-
nior Liz Garson tied the game, ripping a
shot past R-MC goalie Ashley Crouch off
a penalty comer.

‘‘It was surprising that R-MC scored
quickly, but we didn’t let that get us
down,” said sophomore Sallie Armstrong.
“We responded quickly with Liz Garson’s
goal which was so important to keep us
from playing frantic and on our heels.”

“[Responding with a goal so quickly]
was necessary to show that we were actu-

ally in this game and to prove to ourselves
that we could reorganize and get ourselves
into the game,” said Nugent. “We were ex-
cited about the game, but it seems like we
weren’t totally ready to win and ﬁght for
a victory.”

Ten minutes later the Generals found
back of the net off another penalty comer.
This time it was Armstrong taking a quick
shot off the short pass. Less than three
minutes later, Armstrong took advantage
of another penalty corner to score her sec-
ond goal of the night.

“We have been very focused on [pen-
alty comers in practice],” said Nugent.
“The stoppers have been taking at least
10-20 stops a day, and Sally and Liz have

“[The goal] was shocking, to be hon-
est,” said Nugent. “We just weren’t play-
ing our game.”

Though the Yellow Jackets would
mount several more offensive opportuni-
ties, the Generals defense held strong. Ha-
bliston, in goal for the second half, came
up with three bigsaves to preserve the 3-2
lead and give the Generals the victory in
their ﬁrst ODAC contest of the "season.

“I thought that R-MC played really
well Friday night,” said Armstrong. “They
lived up to my expectations and maybe
played a little better like they wanted it
more than we did.”

The Generals return to action on Tues-
day evening when they travel to Eastern

“We have been very focused on [penalty corners in prac-

tice]. T he stoppers have been taking at least 10-20 stops a

day, and Sally and Liz have been perfecting their hits. Its

drills pay oﬂ"/ ”

The Yellow Jackets mounted an offen-
sive surge with about ten minutes to play,
winning several penalty comers, but the
Generals’ defense refused to budge and
took a 3-1 lead into halftime.

Less than 10 minutes into the second
half, R-MC’s Nicole Klee scored off a
penalty comer to bring the Yellow Jackets
within one.

Mennonite to take on the Royals, who
were picked third in the preseason poll
and have already defeated Lynchburg and
Virginia Wesleyan in conference play.

“EMU is our biggest game in the near
future since they eliminated us from the
ODAC tournament last year and have al-
ready won against No. 1 Lynchburg this
year,” said Habliston. “We have very
similar styles of play and will approach
the game with composure and looking for
payback.”

Yellow Jackets sting Generals 42-17

After a closeﬁrst half Randolph-Macon destroys W&L in second half

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

Last season, Washington and Lee foot-
ball enjoyed a good degree of success,
winning the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference and restoring a sense of worth to a
program that had been off W&L students’
collective radar for several decades.

This season, the Generals notched two
impressive, hard-fought out-of-conference
victories and looked to be on course to a
repeat ODAC title.

On Saturday afternoon, in suburban
Richmond, the wheels came off. The boys
in blue fell 42-17 to a surprisingly strong
Randolph-Macon squad picked to ﬁnish
last in the conference before the season
began.

The Generals had only themselves to
blame as they committed six turnovers and
gave up 30 unanswered points.

The game started inauspiciously when
the host Yellow Jackets scored a touch-
down less than two minutes into the con-
test. The ﬁrst half was a competitive affair
where each team scored two touchdowns.
W&L’s Torn Pacicco had both for the visi-
tors on 1- and 2- yard runs and R-MC add-
ed to their early lead with a 79-yard kick
return by Waddell Howard after Pacicco’s
ﬁrst. Pacicco nearly added a third but fum-

bled the football only one yard from the
end zone to put an end to an impressive
16-play, 90-yard drive.

The score at halftime was the exact
same as in last week’s game against Aver-
ett, 15-14, after a R-MC ﬁeld goal. From
there on, though, the aftemoon’s affair di-
verged remarkably from its predecessor.
R-MC kicked off to start the second half,
but the ball was fumbled by W&L’s Aaron
Fulk and was recovered by R-MC’s Tristan
Carr. The Jackets capitalized on the error
with a touchdown pass from Brandon Bra-
ner to tight end Stuart May. W&L punted
on its next possession and then gave up an-
other touchdown to go down 14-28.

Still within reach at the start of the
fourth quarter, W&L quarterback R.J. Var-
ner fumbled at his own 5-yard line under
pressure on the ﬁrst play of the ﬁnal pe-
riod. The ball was recovered by R-MC’s
Ray Johnson in the end zone to put the
hosts up 35-14.

From there, Vamer’s afternoon only got
worse. He was intercepted on the ﬁrst play
of the next possession and it took Braner
only two plays to put his team up 42-14.
Chris Prugar tackled Rod Nelson on the
one-yard line to save a touchdown, only
to see Zak Thornton rush for his third of
the day on the very next snap. Vamer then
threw his third interception just three plays

into the next possession though R-MC was
forced to punt. Vamer was replaced by
freshman Patrick Rouse for the next series,
who led the Generals to their ﬁnal points,
a ﬁeld goal by Andrew Wilbourn to make
the ﬁnal score 42-17.

Vamer was candid about his 8-for-
15, 59-yard afternoon. “We got our butts
kicked,” he said plainly. There were few
bright spots for the Generals, though
Pacicco had over 100 yards rushing for the
third straight game and safety Kyle Luby
again led the team in tackles with nine.

The Blue Menace defense proved al-
most entirely unable to stop the Yellow
Jacket offense, who punted only ﬁve times
in the game. R-MC’s Thornton (22 rush,
89 yards) and Braner (10-17, 118 yards, 1
TD) have proven to be one of the better
RB—QB pairings in the conference. Their
preseason ranking, seventh, was clearly
too low, as the Jackets are now 4-1 and un-
defeated in conference play. They had not
won four games in a season since 2003.

Unless the Generals can correct the
widespread mistakes that plagued them on
Saturday, their preseason ranking, second,
may have been too optimistic. The Blue
and White will need to commit far fewer
turnovers if they hope to win the confer-
ence again, as many of their newfound
fans expect them to do.

  . Quadrennial convention

Alums recount signiﬁcant Mock Con experiences

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

When Sam Syme remembers
Washington and Lee’s famous 1956
convention, he remembers the front
row seat he had for all the action.

“I was Secretary of the Student
Body, which made me secretary of
the convention," Syme, a member of
the Class of I956, said.

“Mainly that meant I called the
roll ofstatesz Alabama, etc.”

Syme, who also served as editor of
The Ring—tum Phi, was sitting on the
podium when Sen. Alben W. Bark-
ley, a former Vice President who had
returned to the Senate as Kentucky’s
junior member, came up to speak.

Such a prominent Democratic
speaker had attracted huge crowds to
Doremus Gymnasium.

Syme remembers that the students

were joined by local residents and a
large press delegation. The governor
of Virginia was in the audience as
well.

“Barkley got up to make his
speech, and he was using lots of

revival.”

Barkley’s next — and ﬁnal — words
are well known.

As he described his 50 years of
government service to the cheering
crowd, he said, “I would rather be a

“Barkley got up to make his speech, and he was
using lots of biblical quotes, being very folksy. He
was working himself up, and he sort of spoke like a
revival preacher. You didn ’t know if you were at a
convention or a Baptist revival. ”

SAM SYME, Class of 1956

Biblical quotes, being very folksy,”
Syme said. “He was working him-
self up, and he sort of spoke like a
revival preacher. You didn’t know if
you were at a convention or a Baptist

servant in the land of the Lord than sit
in the seats of power.”

As the crowd cheered, Barkley
suddenly collapsed.

“He staggered, caught himself

and then hit me in the knee as he fell
down,” Syme said.

Doctors hurried out of the crowd,
but Barkley was pronounced dead at
the scene.

The next morning Lexington ap-
peared on the front pages of newspa-
pers across America. The press corps
covering the convention raced to call
in their stories.

Barkley’s body was taken to
Washington, D.C., where it would lay
in state at the Capitol. Syme and sev-
eral other students traveled to D.C. as
an informal escort for the late Sena-
tor.

“There were four W&L students
and four VMI students” Syme said.
“It was good because the cadets
knew what to do with these sorts of
things.”

Beta offers 12 bids to former Kappa Sigs

Frat alum expresses enthusiasm, support for recolonization of Alpha Rho chapter

By Sarah Kientz
STAFF WRITER

Adam Porter Price, Beta Theta
Pi’s Senior Leadership Consultant,
has no problem closing chapters.

“We enjoy closing chapters,” Price
said. “We’re not willing to accept me-
diocrity and we stand for the things
we believe in. It helps us live up to
our standards.”

Recolonization of Beta chapters

under this philosophy has been oc-

curring around the country. Price

said that in the last ﬁve years, Beta
has closed 60 chapters and done “ex-
pansions,” or recolonizations, in 40.
Bill Kientz, a 1976 alumnus of
Alpha Rho chapter who spoke with
Ring-tum Phi Managing Editor Jacob

Geiger, was in Lexington for a re-
union at the time Beta was dismissed
from W&L.

He said, “I don’t think anybody
was incensed by it. Some of us were
told why. As adults, you scratch your
head and go, ‘Geez guys...”’

Kientz sympathizes with the
freshmen pledging Beta at the time of
dismissal. He said, “The [freshmen]
probably didn’t have a lot to do with
it and then lost their chapter.”

Currently, Price is looking to ﬁll
the new chapter with both freshmen
and upperclassmen who are either in-
dependent or have disafﬁliated.

Kappa Sigma was removed from
campus this past year, creating an
entire fratemity-worth of potential

Betas. Price has already extended 14
bids to upperclassmen, 12 of whom
are former Kappa Sigs.

“We enjoy closing chapters.
‘We ’re not willing to accept

mediocrity  It helps us live

I

up to our standards. ’

ADAM PRICE, Beta representative
 

“We’re looking for guys who are in
tune with the experience of fraternity
life, but the experience we’re looking

for is much different than what that
fraternity was,” Price said, compar-
ing Beta to Kappa Sig. “While we’re
not going to be necessarily better than
any other fraternity, it’ll be different
and unique and not like the former
Kappa Sig chapter and certainly not
like the former Beta chapter.”

‘ Junior Rogers Crain, a former
Kappa Sig, has accepted his bid to
become one of Beta’s Refounding
Fathers.

He is excited to create a new fra-
ternity. “I chose to join Beta because I
thought it would be a very unique op-
portunity that I would never have
been able to do otherwise,” Crain
said. “The chance to build a fraternity

national theft

Internet sites like eBay used
as unconventional tools for
criminal investigations

By was 0’DeIl
srnrr warren

This summer, Sgt. Mark Riley of the Lexington Po-
lice Department solved a national crime using eBay.

Riley said that while browsing eBay for leads was
not standard procedure before, he’ll be “checking it
regularly” from now on.

Following a trail that threatened to go cold, local
officers helped bring to justice a William and Mary stu-
dent who is now charged with the theft of somewhere
between $300,000 and $500,000 worth of property.

The student, Curtis White, is accused of master-
minding a crime spreethat stretched from Maine to
Mississippi and affected between six and eight sepa-
rate colleges, including Washington and Lee.

W&L’s involvement began on July 17, when eight
overhead projectors valued at nearly $45,000 were
stolen from several locked 200-and 300-level Huntley
Hall classrooms. Flash Floyd, who oversees the projec-
tors, was shocked.

“It is just old fashioned
police work I ’m most
happy to just get the
equipment back It
makes you proud to be
from Lexington. ”

MARK RILEY, Sergeant at Lexington Police Department

“You simply don’t expect something on this scale to
happen on our campus,” Floyd said.

The police were similarly bafﬂed.

“We had no leads, no suspects, no witnesses,” said
Riley, the investigator in charge.

The case remained stalled until July 31, when Riley
decided to check the intemet auction site, eBay.com, to
“cover his bases” and see if the missing projectors had
turned up there.

Sure enough, Riley found several projectors up for
auction that matched the description of those stolen
from Huntley Hall.

They also lacked remote controls, an oddity that
quickly drew the investigator’s attention.

Riley proceeded to contact the seller of the items,
who had purchased them from a second party and
knew nothing of their origins.

According to eBay’s website, it strictly prohibits
the sale of stolen property and “strongly supports law
enforcement efforts” to recover such items.

In this case, the seller confirmed that the ID num-
bers of the projectors matched those stolen from W&L
and then turned them over.

The case was far from closed, however, as the po-
lice proceeded to track the check that the seller had
written to pay for the projectors; it led them to Curtis
White, a resident of Stafford, Va. and a student at Wil-
liam and Mary.

Using both evidence obtained from the seller and
security camera footage from George Mason Univer-
sity, which also suffered a break-in earlier in the year,
police obtained a warrant and searched White’s home.

There, they found a lock core from Huntley Hall.

According to Riley, White employed the same
scheme at many colleges: he would scope out the facil-
ity a few days beforehand and remove a lock core from
one of the doors.

He would then make a key that would allow him to
inﬁltrate classrooms with ease and make off with the
valuable technology inside.

Further investigation revealed that White had ac-
complices, and that he may have even hacked the
W&M computer network to raise his grades. White
himself was arrested in Philadelphia not long after and
is currently in the Fairfax jail awaiting trial.

For defense, White has hired Peter Greenspun, a
prominent attorney whose past clients include sports-
caster Marv Albert and John Allen Muhammad, the D.
C.—area sniper.

However, between the lock core and evidence re-
covered at George Mason, Riley said he is conﬁdent
that there is a “real strong case” against him.

As for the projectors, the University quickly ﬁled an
insurance claim and had them replaced.

According to Treasurer and Vice President for

Finance Steve McAllister, the re-
covered projectors are thus the
property of the insurance company
and will soon be transferred.

According to Floyd, security up-
grades are already underway to pre-
vent ﬁiture thefts. He also praised
the investigators for the unlikely
recovery.

“I don’t think anyone thought
there was a chance of recovering the
projectors,” Floyd said. <

“Our Public Safety Ofﬁce and
the Lexington Police Department
did a tremendous job in investigat-
ing this incident.”

Riley is taking particular pride
in the leading role the Lexington
Police took in this multi-state inves-
tigation and in the fact that W&L’s
projectors were the only stolen
property recovered.

“It’s just old fashioned police
work  I’m most happy to just get
the equipment back,” Riley said.

The investigation is soon to be
featured on “America’s Most Want-
ed.”

Riley added: “It makes you
proud to be from Lexington.”

Fifty years after graduation,
Syme still comes back to campus

He added, “The experience will
be unique because the undergradu-
ate members will be in the driver’s
seat. [It] will allow us to build
exactly the kind of organization
that we want without any negative
qualities.”

Kientz is similarly optimistic.
He believes that the current recolo-
nization of Beta at W&L has been
successful thus far and is moving in
the right direction. He said, “[Price]
seems like a nice guy and is doing it
the right way. I think all the alums
alﬁliated with a fraternity want to
see their chapter on campus.”

Most importantly, Kientz wants
current students to have the same
experiences as he and his brothers.
“Fratemities were great places to

. get together. It was an interesting

group of people,” he said.

Like Price, Crain said that Beta
is looking for individuals who are
“leaders, scholars and gentlemen”
but that the upperclassmen, who
will be initiated in December, will
not have the ﬁnal decision on the
freshmen pledge class that will be
initiated in March.

“The upperclassmen will have‘

some say in who is chosen, but ul-
timately Adam Price will be making
all decisions on who gets a bid,”
Crain said.

Price said that the chapter will
be satisﬁed with 20 new members,
but will not be disappointed if they
receive less than quota.

“We’re focused on ﬁnding the
right men, not a certain amount of
men,” Price said. “We’re more con-
cerned with quality than quantity.”

Deﬁning Lee’s place in history

Scholars gather to consider Lee as a general, leader and teacher

By Alexandra Scaggs
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee will con-
tinue its celebration of Robert E.
Lee’s 200* birthday today with a
full-day symposium at Lee Cha-
pel.

The program will begin at 10
a.m. with keynote speaker Peter
S. Carmichael, editor of “Audac-
ity Personiﬁed: Essays on the
Generalship of Robert E. Lee.”

His speech, entitled “Truth is
Mighty and Will Eventually Pre-
vail: Why Americans Disagree
about the Historical Legacy of
Robert E. Lee,” will discuss the

representation of Robert E. Lee
at museums and historical sites,
Lee Chapel included.

Carmichael is the Eberly Pro-
fessor of Civil War Studies at
West Virginia University. Since
Lee’s 200th birthday on January
19, the university has hosted nu-
merous panels and discussions to
consider Lee’s legacy.

The rest of the day will be a
discussion of Lee’s three most
important roles: a general, a
leader, and a teacher. At ll:l5
a.m., A. Wilson Greene and Gor-
don Rhea will speak on “General
Lee’s Overland Campaign.”

Greene has written six books
and over two dozen articles on
Civil War and Southern history.
He also worked as a historian
for the National Park Service for
16 years. His most recent book
focused on Petersburg, site of a
nine month siege in 1864-1865.

Rhea is a co-author of “In the
Footsteps of Grant and Lee: The
Wilderness Through Cold Har-
bor.”

At 2 pm., Lee’s leadership
abilities will be the subject in
“General Lee and the Rank and
File,” presented by Dr. J. Tracy
Power, a South Carolina histori-

an, and Dr. Aaron Sheehan-Dean,
a history professor at University
of North Florida. There will be a
short Q&A session after the two
historians speak.

The author of “Robert E.
Lee: A Biography,” Dr. Emory
Thomas, and Virginia Historical
Society representative John Mc-
Clure will speak last, with “Lee
and Education.”

They will give insight into
Lee’s identity as an educator and
his relationships with the stu-
dents and faculty of then-named
Washington College.

They will also discuss the

fallout from Lee’s loss in the
Civil War and the seizure of his
plantation for the Freedman Bu-
reau’s village, a settlement for
freed slaves.

Monday’s panel coincides
with last week’s reopening of th
chapel’s museum. Lee’s base-
ment ofﬁce is once again open to
visitors.

The crypt where Lee, his
wife, children and other family
members are buried is also open
again for public viewing.

Your God- given right to sag

Beware: The idea of a fashion police is no longer a silly notion, its a reality

By Kathie Scott
COLUMNIST

A fashion “faux pas” refers to
a social blunder. And within the
fashion world this term can be de-
ﬁned as wearing chocolate brown
with black, white after Labor Day,
or cropped pants with boots.

Some fashion experts claim
that rules were meant to be bro-
ken. After all, sometimes brown
and black don’t look so bad to-
gether.

However, some cities in the
U.S. feel one fashion faux pas that
should be avoided is that of visi-
ble undergarments, usually paired
with baggy pants. In Delcambre,
La., wearing anything that allows
your underwear to be visible is
punished with a ﬁne of up to $500
or six months in jail.

The baggy pants tradition be-
gan in jails when prisoners were
not permitted to wear belts for
fear of injury. The trend shifted
to the community, spread nation-
wide, and became a fashion trend.
They’re concerned that if crimi-
nals wear baggy pants, then those
who wear baggy pants must be
criminals. Supporters of the ban
fear that the baggy pants phenom-
enon will carry down to small
children, thus introducing a life of
crime and violence early on.

In my opinion, I think baggy
pants are ridiculous. I won’t lie,
I can deﬁnitely appreciate a guy
who wears a natural sag, which
falls just around the hips (Note:
Since the idea of sagging might
be a foreign concept to some

readers on this campus please
note that “sagging” is the verb for
producing baggy jeans. “Baggy”
is merely the adjective involved
in describing this ﬁnal product.
“Sag” can be used as a noun as
well as an adjective).

In fact, I enjoy the natural sag.
This natural sag usually involves
a little boxer Visibility; 1 can deal
with a little.

However, there are more ex-
treme methods of sagging. This
sagging usually involves a lot of
underwear visibility and you can
usually tell how bad the sagging
is by checking the alignment of
the back pockets with the person’s
body. For instance, back pockets
aligning with the back of one’s
knees equals too much sagging.
Pretty much anything that goes
below mid-butt range is too much
sagging.

All opinions aside, how ridic-
ulous is this law? Does anybody
else feel this might infringe on
First Amendment rights? Granted
it’s the right to look stupid, but
everybody should have that right!
Previous generations had the right
to look stupid when legwarrners,
tie dye shirts, and shoulder pads
were “in.”

Let’s think about this logically
with regards to the Constitution.
America guarantees freedom. Is-
sues only arise when person A’s
freedom infringes upon person
B’s freedom. Maybe showing un-
derwear infringes upon the rights
of others. But if were to be sen-
sitive to those rights, this brings
about an entirely new set of ques-

  . Speaking out for common courtesy

Don ’t greet others simply because it is tradition but because it is the right thing

By Celeste Cruz-Caradang
and Joan Oguntlmeln
C O L U M N I S T 8

Two letters.

Just two, making a word that
makes a world of difference.

“Hi.” One syllable made in
one breath.

Yet people on this campus
ﬁnd it so hard to say this simple
word. “Hi.”

Why?

We’re not really sure. May-
be they’re talking on their cell
phone, running and therefore out
of breath, detached, spaced out,
or simply just don’t care.

Washington and Lee holds

.not only an academic reputation

of greatness, but also possesses
one of the most coveted histori-
cal legacies in the nation, which
is immersed in traditions.

One such tradition has be-
come less precious to our com-
munity.

The Speaking Tradition, as its
name implies, is a time honored
custom that simply speaks of the
civility that all members of the_
W&L community possess, or
rather should possess.

Indeed, despite the sense
of community that it gives our
school, the Speaking Tradition
has gone unpracticed, unnoticed,
and undervalued.

Our late president John W.
Elrod said it best in his 1995 in-
augural address: “The Speaking
Tradition calls for the ordinary
courtesy of greeting each other
in our daily commerce. It is a
simple act but one whose mean-

ing and value we should not un-
derestimate.”

So if the Speaking Tradition
calls for common courtesy of
greeting, why do people ﬁnd it
so hard to practice it?

Why do students ﬁnd it so
easy to practice the Honor Sys-
tem, our other major tradition
here at W&L, but not the Speak-
ing Tradition? They both boil
down to the same thing; respect
for each other.

I think we all have to realize
that the phrase “common cour-
tesy” is a rather curious oxymo-
ron. Courtesy is not as simple as
the preceding adjective implies.
In fact, it is what makes a per-
son different and noticeable in
today’s society.

But despite the lack of good
manners in the “real world,” at
W&L it is common courtesy that
makes this student body have
such a pleasantly refreshing am-
bience of welcome and commu-
nity.

This school has only 1700
students, a much smaller popula-
tion that that of the high schools
many of us attended. You’ve
probably met, seen, or know al-
most everyone on this tiny cam-
pus. To refuse to greet someone
as they pass you by is purely
rude and quite frankly, it shows a
serious deﬁciency in character.

Now, please don’t misunder-
stand us. We’re not asking you
to walk around like an annoying
happy machine, getting in every-
one’s face for a chance to say hi.

We know everyone has their
bad days where they just don’t
feel like being around people or

engaging in a conversation with
anyone.

However, greeting someone
or at least acknowledging his or
her presence with a simple head
nod, hand wave, or slight upward
curl of your lips, won’t make
your day any worse.

In fact, their possible kind
and polite response to your civil
gesture might be exactly what
you need to make your day a
little brighter.

Now I know that this can be a
tiresome task. We will be the ﬁrst
to admit that we do not always
behave courteously and actively
practice the Speaking Tradition.

It does take a small amount
of courage to start that awkward
sidelong eye contact, continue
into the instinct of looking down
as the other person approaches,
and the progress somewhat re-
luctantly into gazing upward and
giving the salutation of choice.

The latter portion in itself is
difficult. Aﬂer all, there are the
head nod friends, the high-ﬁve
group, and then the regular old
vocal hello students.

Yet, as heart-wrenching as
this second long process is, may-
be all we have to do is take a step
back and realize that hi is just
hi. If the other person does not
reciprocate our reception, social
suicide is not inevitable.

If we want W&L to continue
to be the tight-knit community
that it aspires to be, we must
each do our part to uphold this
tradition.

The Speaking Tradition and
the Honor System give W&L its
singularity and superiority.

We visit and experience a
community in which we are wel-
comed, accepted for our individ-
uality, appreciated for our integ-
rity and valued for our intellect
and creativity.

Yes, academic prestige did
contribute a lot to our college
decision, but it was this afore-
mentioned sense of comfort that
made W&L more of a home than
a large state school or larger pri-
vate schools.

I In short, we were all drawn
to this school because from the
minute we walked on campus
and saw the sweeping white an-
tebellum columns and red clay
buildings, complete strangers
greeted us,

As much as the architecture
may make it seem, W&L is not
simple a place of history and tra-
dition.

The founding date of our uni-
versity does not deﬁne our sense
of honor or our sense of cour-
tesy.

Therefore, do not feel com-
pelled to great that fellow stu-
dent because of that trident on
your ﬂip ﬂops or the Generals
emblem on your polo.

Say hello because it is the
right thing to do.

We appeal to you: Please
don’t let the Speaking Tradition
die.

Revive it once again.

Let it awake from its defunct
depths of dormancy to show the
world its power and potential to
inﬂict change.

Let us practice civility.

tions.

If others feel it is unbearable
to witness the exposure of some
underwear (namely, boxers which
are really just shorts anyways)
then maybe I shouldn’t have to go
to the beach and shield my eyes
from the inappropriate bathing
suits worn by those who didn’t
prepare/tone up for the season.
Should I have to witness had
highlights, bad makeup, and out-
ﬁts consisting of polka dot prints
AND stripes?

If others feel its un-
bearable to witness
the exposure of box-
ers, maybe I shouldn’t
have to shield my eyes
from inappropriate

bathing suits.

Well, hell, let’s all just wear
the same thing. That would make
things easier.

l’ll wait for the government
to send me a list of appropriate
clothing. Who knows, maybe
they’ll also be kind enough to tell
me who I should marry and how
many kids I should have! Weird
how that reminds me a lot of that
one form of government, oh yeah,
COMMUNISM!

If anti-baggy pants supporters
will make the huge jump in corre-
lating baggy pants with criminal

  

activity, I too would like to make
a jump in saying that regulations
of this nature will only escalate
until the government is involved
in every aspect of our lives.
What’s next?!

As for baggy pants spreading
to the wardrobe of small children,
instead of asking the govem-
ment to create rules concerning
dress, why not act like a parent
and enforce these rules in your
own household? As a parent, you
know what your child is wearing
and will not have to be concerned
that the minute you turn your
back, your 7-year-old son will
whip off his belt and pull down
his pants.

Teenage rebellion usually
starts during the teenage years. If
you cannot exhibit control in your
home regarding what your child
is wearing before those rebellious
years hit, maybe you should join
Britney in a parenting class or
two.

I understand that crime is an
issue in this country. I also under-
stand that one of the best places to
start is within youth. However, I
don’t understand how, after close
analysis of the nature of crime in
this country, the ﬁrst appropriate
place to start is pants. If baggy
pants began in jail and the punish-
ment for wearing baggy pants in
public can be jail time, isn’t this
just an inﬁnite loop? I suggest
someone re-assess the elements
involved in creating a criminal
and realize that people who don’t
wear baggy pants can commit
crimes too.

Cracking the case

Local police oﬁlcer solves school thefts

In the past few years we’ve
taken our fair share of shots at
the Lexington Police Department.
From a student perspective, there
are weekends when it seems like
the entire department has nothing
better to do than sit outside the
most popular off-campus houses.

There are few things that look
as strange as three young police
officers doing a ﬁeld sobriety test
on a 22-year-old driver who then
blows a .018 BAC.

Hopefully Chief Steve Crowder
will eventually help his new of-
ﬁcers learn to avoid the heavy-
handedness that has plagued so
many interactions with students
this year. Many of the force’s
veteran ofﬁcers could teach the
young bucks a few things about
building trust and good will with
the people you serve and protect.

But for all the criticism we’ve
leveled at the police, we know
how to give credit when it’s due.

Sgt. Mark Riley has already
been lauded in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch and other daily
newspapers. But we don’t have
a problem with repeating the
praise.

Working from his ofﬁce behind
City Hall, Riley is proof that the
intemet lets small-town detectives
solve crimes they might never
have resolved in the past.

It was Riley, not an ofﬁcer
from a larger, more prestigious
department, who went online to
look for the stolen projectors.

Riley’s smart use of Ebay
cracked a sophisticated, multi-
state crime ring that had stumped

police up and down the East
Coast.

This type of difﬁcult investiga-
tive work is exactly what Crowder
and his predecessor, Bruce Beard,
want from Lexington police.

The department has state ac-
creditation, making it one of the
smallest accredited departments
in Virginia. And as Washington
and Lee ofﬁcials will tell you
while they prepare for our accred-
itation process, earning that status
in any line of work is nothing to
sneer at.

It’s an oft-repeated cliché that
students forget they’re not always
safe on and around our campus.
The dorm intrusions last month
and the break-in at Pi Kappa Al-
pha this summer were certainly
stark reminders of that. And stu-
dents living off campus forget that
the late-night police patrols help
keep their houses safe, especially
during the long breaks when some
neighborhoods are half—empty.

Most of this work goes unno-
ticed. Students and police will
probably never get along perfect-
ly. We simply have very diﬁer-
ent goals and opinions. Many of
us choose to drink alcohol, even
though we know the age is 21.
Police are charged with enforcing
Virginia’s laws, even the ones we
break on a regular basis.

Maybe we’re never going to
get along well with the Lexington
police. Maybe the newer officers
won’t be willing to change their
style.

Mark Riley reminds us that the
police really do make Lex safe.

  

Campus should provide
for the possibility of
pregnant student

Students for Life should push for options for a
pregnant student, such as continuing classes

  



editor

Reading last week’s article on the Student’s For Life vigil made me
wonder if they had a point — this issue does need to be brought to our cam-
pus.

Now personally, I am pro-choice, and I respect that everyone has a right
to their own beliefs, but wouldn’t it be more constructive to their cause to
open options and resources to help someone who might be in that situa-
tion on this campus rather than eliminating other options that are safe, but
controversial? I

No student, at least in my experience, has ever been visibly pregnant on
this campus, so it’s hard to gauge what it would be like. Not many can deny
the extreme diﬂiculty of handling the stress of classes and being pregnant,
while also still being a part of the W&L community.

The most loved characteristic of W&L is its culture and campus life.
The education combined with its social traditions is what makes this school
what it is, what makes it unique. But currently, we have no support system

for a student to continue her education on this campus and be pregnant.

So, what is she to do? Drop out? Leave behind the experience and ben-
eﬁts of going to college at a place like W&L?
Then what happens to the child with a mother who does not have a

college education or is struggling to ﬁnish it? That child’s quality of life is
reduced.

But if that child had a mother who was supported by her university’s

community and ﬁnished her top notch education, then the quality of life
would be greatly improved.

W&L offers us so much already for our futures, and maybe efforts

Katie Hager

should be redirected so that W&L could also offer a female student in the
position of being pregnant during her four years, something for her child’s
future as well.

The University Concert
Guild brings talented

musicians to campus

By Michele Farqueharson
surr wanna

The Washington and Lee Concert Guild brings
in internationally recognized classical musicians
to campus and makes their concerts available to
Washington and Lee students.

Professor Tim Gaylard, the adviser to the Con-
cert Guild, answered some questions concerning
the Guild, how students can get involved and what
we can expect this year: -

Q: What kind of music does the Concert Guild
bring to campus?

A: [It is] always mainstream classical from the Ba-
roque, Classical, Romantic and Modern periods.

Q: How do students get involved in the Concert
Guild?
A: Music majors and students interested in mu-
sic [such as] performers and students who have
taken a lot of musical classes are invited onto the
Board.

Q: What do we have to look forward to over this
Concert ’s season?

A: There are three events this season: Pianist
Marc-André Hamelin on Tuesday, October 9th,
the a cappella group, King’s Singers, on Sunday,
February 10th, and the Brentano String Quartet on
Tuesday, March, 18th.

Professor Gaylard’s role on the Board is to
meet with the students periodically throughout the
year to suggest artists to hire for the next season,
to organize hosting the artists, and to ﬁnd support
for their performances. This is where the student
body can get involved. Ushers and people to work
back-stage are needed to produce the shows and,
as Professor Gaylard pointed out, “The concerts
are of very high quality and provide a wonderful
opportunity for all the W&L community to enjoy
ﬁne‘ musical performances.”

The Concert Guild is bringing some amazing
artists to campus this year. Marc-Andre’ Hamelin
was born in Montreal and is an internationally re-
nowned French-Canadian pianist. He has toured
all over the globe from Germany to New York to
Japan and has played with the BBC Symphony,
Royal Concertbouw, Australian Chamber Orches-
tra and Les Violons du Roy. International Piano
Quarterly claimed him as “one of the most adven-
turous and certainly the most courageous pianist
of recent times.”

If you missed Marc-André, have no fear! You
have plenty of time to prepare yourself for the a
cappella group, King’s Singers, in February. It is
a group of six men who graduated from King’s
College in Cambridge and who during their time
there were honored as choral scholars. While the
founders of the group are no longer performing,
the tradition has been upheld and the group has
been on tour for over thirty years. They have per-
formed with groups and artists such as Placido
Domingo, The Boston Pops Orchestra, and Paul
McCartney. Currently, the members include Da-
vid Hurley, Robin Tyson, Paul Phoenix, Philip
Lawson and Chris Gabbitas.

Maybe February isn’t a good month for you?
The ﬁnal performance coming to W&L is the
Brentano String Quartet. The group has per-
formed all over the world in venues such as Cam-
egie Hall, the Library of Congress, the Concert-
gebouw, the Konzerthaus and the Sydney Opera
House. The current members are Mark Steinberg,
Serena Canin, Misha Amory and Nina Lee. All
four members have degrees from the prestigious
music school, lulliard, and have taught at institu-
tions such as Princeton, Harvard, and Columbia
Universities. The New York Times remarked,
“The Brentano String Quartet is something spe-
cial...their music making is private, delicate and

’ fresh, but by its very intimacy and importance it

seizes attention.”

As you can see, these performances are of the
highest quality and provide Washington and Lee
students with an amazing chance to hear some
of the most well-known musicians in the world.
Most small universities do not have this kind of
opportunity, so please take advantage of what
your school has to offer. Sit back, relax, and enjoy
the.music!

Washington and Lee gives
a huge welcome home to
both young and old alumni

By Kimber Wiggs
STAFF WRITER

This weekend W&L welcomed back some of our long-lost compa-
triots. Our fallen comrades-in-arrns returned from the graduation grave
to grace us with their presence once more. Their homecoming began
with the usual display of enthusiasm and revelry, so now it is time to
look back on the days leading up the actual events.

Homecoming is an interesting time on campus. Seniors ﬁnally got
to partake in the Alumni Wine Tasting, while freshmen scrambled for
dates and tried to decide which frats they like the most at this moment.
For those in-between, Homecoming was, at the least, an opportunity to
look at some banners and see a pretty good, if inadequately attended,
concert in the Pavilion.

The Homecoming banners went up Tuesday, amid a wave of anti-
Catholic sentiment. Last week was certainly a good time to be a Prot-
estant on this campus.

Robert Randolph and the Family Band played Wednesday night.
The turnout for the opener, Rose Hill Drive, was less than encouraging;
though the band played a great set and deserved more attention. Hap-
pily, when Robert Randolph took the stage, an enthusiastic crowd had
gathered and was ready to bring in both the noise and the funk.

Robert Randolph got the crowd going with their perennial favor-
ite, “I Need More Love.” Everyone appeared to be having a good
time,because when Robert Randolph’s little sister asked if they were,
they all replied in the aiﬁrmative.

As for the weekend festivities, inital attitudes varied from sheer eu-
phoric excitement to anxious apprehension. Sophomore Meghan Keane
was “pumped to see her old friends and excited for the freshmen to
attend a classy W&L function that doesn’t involve beer in basements.”
Not to begin with, at least.

All in all, Homecoming was a good experience for the freshmen and
pretty much business as usual for everyone else. Now it’s time for the
cocktail dresses to go back into hibernation until Christmas Weekend
rolls around.

Field Hockey rebounds from tough loss with scoring outburst against Roanoke

By Mlchael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

This week posed two tough
ODAC matches for the Washing-
ton and Lee ﬁeld hockey team.
After suffering a tough 2-1 loss to
the Royals of Eastern Mennonite
University on Tuesday evening,
the Generals returned home to
take out their frustration on the
Maroons of Roanoke.

On Tuesday evening the Gen-
erals took on EMU in an ODAC
showdown between the two un-
beaten teams in conference play.

Twenty-ﬁve minutes into the
first half, sophomore Alyssa Der-
stine scored her ﬁrst goal of the
game on a penalty stroke to give
the Royals a 1-0 lead. Less than
ten minutes into the second half,
Derstine struck again to extend
the lead to 2-0.

The Generals refused to quit.
Less than four minutes later,
sophomore Stephanie Mansey
scored an unassisted goal to bring
the Generals within one. Howev-
er, that was as close as they would

on for the 2-1 victory.

“We need to play the entire 70
minutes to beat EMU,” said soph-
omore Sallie Armstrong. “We
had a chance on Tuesday, but we
played with too much anxiety and
were so nervous to lose that we
didn’t play together as a team.”

The Royals improved to 3-0 in
ODAC play, 4-5 overall, to lead
the conference while W&L fell to
1-1 in the conference.

It didn’t take long for the
Generals to shake off Tuesday
night’s loss. Just 70 seconds into
the game, Armstrong broke free
down the right side, ripped a shot
to the far post, and found the back
of the net to give the Generals a
1-0 lead.

“It was great to set the tone of
the game with a shot in the ﬁrst
two minutes,” said Armstrong. “It

Though the Maroons were able

half with 2:20 to play in the half.

The Generals weren’t ﬁnished.
With time winding down, Korte
found sophomore Stephanie Man-
sey just inside the circle. It took
a kick save by Roanoke goalie
Lindsey Paz as time expired
to prevent another W&L goal.
Though giving up four goals, Paz
would ﬁnish with fourteen saves.

The Generals came out ready
to play in the second half, scoring
almost as fast as they had in the
ﬁrst half. Just over three minutes
in, sophomore Alex Caritis assist-
ed junior Guada Suarez to extend
the Generals’ lead to 4-0.

The Maroons refused to roll
over and die. With eighteen min-
utes to play, Roanoke was award-
ed a penalty comer and nearly
scored but sophomore goalie
Caroline Habliston made a kick
to prolong the shutout. However,
the Maroons would ﬁnd the net

“Tuesday’s loss made us want
to really beat Roanoke and really
come together as a team to beat
them,” said Armstrong. “Our
passing was the best it has been
all season, and it looks like we are
really coming together and know
where our teammates are at all
times.”

With the win, the Generals im-
prove to 5-3 overall. The Generals
return to action at home against
preseason favorite Lynchburg on
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

“Tuesday’s game against
Lynchburg is deﬁnitely going to
be one of the toughest games of
our season,” said Merchant. “We

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity women’s volleyball team
won all six matches it played this
week to run its winning streak to
ten matches. After traveling to Fer-
rum on Tuesday, the Generals took
on ODAC foe Guilford at home on
Wednesday evening and then trav-
eled to Danville, VA, to participate
in the Averett Invitational, where
they swept all four matches.

On Tuesday evening the Gener-
als took on Ferrum. Without much
trouble. the Generals corralled the
Panthers, sweeping them in the
games: 30-24, 30-15, 30-27. The
Generals were led by junior Abbey
Wi1son’s six kills and ﬁve blocks
and sophomore Kristi Stevens’ 20
assists and 12 digs.

Wednesday evening the Gener-
als returned home to face Guilford
in their ﬁfth conference match of the
season. The match got off to a rough
start as Guilford quickly opened a
sizeable lead, but the Generals re-

mained unfazed. Down 27-19, the
Generals won a side out and junior
Jess Ulrich served ten in a row to
steal the ﬁrst game for W&L, 30-
27.

Guilford stayed close early in
game two, but with the score tied 4-
4, the Generals opened up an eight
point lead with a 9-1 run and then
ﬁnished the game 30-16. In game
three, the Generals jumped out
to an early 9-4 lead but Guilford
closed to within two points at 10-8.
The Generals responded with a 9-3
run to go up 19-11 and were never
threatened again, winning the ﬁnal
game 30-21. The Generals were led
by junior Laura Maurer’s 13 kills
and Stevens’ 25 assists.

On Friday and Saturday, the
team participated in the Averett
Invitational, taking on ODAC ri-
val Randolph-Macon, host Averett,
Queens, and Greensboro.

On Friday evening, the Gener-
als opened with a quick 3-0 sweep
of the Yellow Jackets of Randolph-
Macon. The Generals became pro-
gressively more dominant, winning

by a score of 30-24, 30-23, 30-17.
Sophomore Rachael Phillips led the
way with 16 kills and eight digs and
Maurer chipped in 18 digs in addi-
tion to six kills.

The Generals would be glad
their ﬁrst match was only three
games because the nightcap against
Averett would go the distance. The
match was back and forth through-
out. After dropping the ﬁrst game
27-30, the Generals fought back
to take the second game 30-21, the
only game of the match decided by
more than three points.

However, the Cougars refused to
roll over and die, clawing their way
to a 30-28 win in the third game to
put them just one away from the
victory. However, the Generals dug
in and won the fourth game by the
same score and then sealed the win
with a 16-14 ﬁfth game victory.

Splitting time at setter, Stevens
and senior Lauren Rudolph com-
bined for 56 assists and 35 digs.
Phillips and Maurer continued their
strong play, tallying 20 and 16 kills,
respectively. Senior Jess Hudock

also added ﬁve aces to go along
with 14 kills and 17 digs.

In the morning, the Gener-
als awoke to take on Queens and
Greensboro. In the morning match-
up, the Generals downed the Royals
of Queens in three games. After a
relatively easy ﬁrst game win, 30-
14, the Royals awoke but came up
short, losing the second game, 31-
29. Their spirits crushed, the Gener-
als cruised to a 30-17 win in game
three, sealing the 3-0 victory.

The Generals carried the mo-
mentum into the second match
of the day against the Pride of
Greensboro, downing them in three
straight: 30-23, 30-19, 30-23.

On Saturday, offensively the
Generals were led by Maurer’s 22
kills and Hudock’s 19 kills while
Rudolph and Stevens amassed 37
and 36 assists, respectively. Defen-
sively, Maurer’s 19 digs were tops
for the Generals.

The Generals return to action this
Tuesday at the Warner Center when
they take on ODAC rival Roanoke
at 6:30 p.m.

Men extend unbeaten streak to eight

Washington and Lee’s men’s
soccer team chalked up vic-
tories over in-town rival D-I
Virginia Military Institute and
ODAC rival Roanoke.

On Wednesday afternoon,
the Generals welcomed VMI to
Watt ﬁeld for the 35th meeting
between the two teams.

The Generals struck quickly.
Less than ﬁve minutes into the
contest, junior Tommy Pignatel-
li’s shot was deﬂected to senior
Jack Palmer, who ﬁnished the
close range opportunity. The
Generals kept up the pressure
through the ﬁrst half, ﬁring 15
more shots, but failing to add a
second goal.

Just three minutes into the
second half, the Generals struck
again when Pignatelli scored a
goal of his own off another de-
ﬂection to extend the lead to
2-0.

In the 73rd minute, Pi gnatel-
li’s comer kick was ﬁnished by
senior Travis Short to extend
the lead for the ﬁnal time to 3-
0.

The win gave W&L their
ﬁrst victory over VMI since
2001 and improved their head-
to-head record to 17-14-4.

On Saturday, the Gener-
als took on the Maroons of
Roanoke in a battle of two top
ODAC teams.

Roanoke’s Michael Rouha-
na was shown a red card in the
32nd minute, forcing his team
to play down a man for the re-
mainder of the match. However,
the best chance of the ﬁrst half
still belonged to Roanoke when
a shot clanked off the inside of
the post.

It wasn’t until the 57th min-
ute that senior Jack Palmer
scored an unassisted goal to
give the Generals a 1-0 advan-
tage, which they clung to for
the rest of the game.

The loss was Roanoke’s ﬁrst
in conference play this seaon,
while the Generals improved to
7-1-2., 4-0-1 in ODAC.

The Generals return to ac-
tion on Wednesday when they
travel to play Ferrum at 4:00
p.m.

Junior Kiki Moreo makes a save with six seconds remaining
in the game to preserve the win. The shutout was her 31st,
making Moreo the all-time leader in shutout wins at W&L.

Women tally two more shutout
wins over Guilford and CN U

to play, junior Marisa Van Brunt
headed home a Katie Kern corner
kick to make the ﬁnal score 4-0.

On Saturday; the women
struck quickly when Van Dev-
ender passed to Kern, who found
the back of the net less than six
minutes into the game.

The rest of the game proved to
be a defensive struggle, with nei-
ther team scoring in the remain-
der of the game.

Junior Kiki Moreo played the
entirety of both games, tallying
six saves and was credited with
the two shutout wins. The two
victories gave Moreo her 30th
and 31st shutout wins of her ca-
reer, which moved her into ﬁrst
all-time at W&L in that category.

ODAC match.

Though the Quakers were able
to hold the score to 0-0 at the end
of the ﬁrst half, the second saw a

Junior Kate Corr started the scor-
ing less than ﬁve minutes into the

The N ei1(l)s
break down the
ﬁrst four weeks

of the NFL
Season

By Neill Thupari and Neil Sheaffer
STAFF WRITER AND GUEST WRITER

What are the best and worst surprises thus far in
200 7?

NT: Best surprise this year for me has got to be the revival
of the Green Bay Packers. For anyone who has seen Brett Favre
in the mid 90’s during his prime, it is absolutely invigorating to
see him leading a contender once again. I only hope that they can
continue their success and ﬁnd a running game to complement
Favre’s gunslinger mentality. Being from Baltimore and having
to hear the non-stop commentary from Ravens fans with Super-
Bowl aspirations, I have to mention them as being one of, if not
the, worst surprise this year. Highly overrated, the Ravens are 2-2
coming off a loss to Cleveland; and if they do not right the ship in
the upcoming weeks, Brian Billick will immediately be placed on
the hot seat after failing to build on the success of last year’s AFC
North Champion squad.

NS: l’ve been pretty negative about the NFL this year, so it’s
tough for me to think of a pleasant surprise, so I’m going to start
negative. Worst surprise: the San Diego Chargers. They abso-
lutely stink, and this is coming with someone who would take
multiple bullets for LaDainian. I think plenty [read: all] of the
blame should fall on the coaching staff because they were work-
ing with almost the complete roster from last year’s team that
went 14-2. There are reasons that Ted Cottrell and Norv Turner
were unemployed last season. Okay, now for my best surprise. I
haven’t ever really liked Tony Romo, maybe because he plays for
the Cowboys and maybe because he made the Pro Bowl roster
after only playing half a season, but the guy is legitimately good.
And that’s a surprise to me. I always ﬁnd it odd that a guy like
him can ﬂy so far under the radar for a while and then suddenly
be an upper tier player. How does this happen? It’s not like he got
that much better while sending in the signals to Drew Bledsoe.

Which teams’ record doesn’t accurately- reﬂect theirn
.-oath,

overall performance?

NT: I feel that something has to be said here for your Char-
gers, Neil. Yes, San Diego is 1-3, and yes, they don’t appear to
have the hunger they did last year, but this is still the Chargers
team that was an absolute juggernaut last year on their way to a
14-2 record. They are insanely talented on both sides of the ball,
and if the coaching staff can get it together and make the players
believe in the Norv Turner and his assistants they can still turn it
around. Phillip Rivers at QB. Reigning MVP LaDainian Tomlin-
son. Antonio Gates as the best downﬁeld tight end in the league.
A defensive attack led by Shawne Merriman that possesses the
ability to play physical and shut down any offense that comes its
way. These don’t sound like the ingredients to a 1-3 team, and I
don’t think it has to stay that way.

NS: I think it will stay that way. With Norv Turner as their’

coach the Chargers will not win more than 6 games. As for a team
whose record is nowhere near where it should be: Tampa Bay.
They are awful. Or at least they should be awful. If I were a fan/
coach/teammate, I would not want my team’s destiny in Jeff Gar-
cia’s hands. Yes, the guy tends to win, but I still don’t know how.
I think he’s the quarterback that we all saw in Detroit a couple
years ago. They deﬁnitely aren’t going to stick around at 3-1. The
Cadillac is out of commission for the year and their starting left
tackle Luke Petitgout is also on the injured reserve list.

Who is the league MVP thus far?

NS: Randy Moss. In my mind, this is a very simple pick. He
and the Patriots are playing at a whole different level than any
team in the NFL, and he is the primary reason. True, they’ve
won a few SuperBowls without any deep receiving threat. True,
Tom Brady makes almost anybody he plays with a lot better, but
in this case it is Randy Moss that is making Brady better. This is
the best Patriots team that I’ve ever seen, and I think they have
a legitimate shot to go undefeated. I’m going to quickly touch
on Moss’ stats before I turn this over to Neill for his round of
Moss bashing. He has 505 yards and 7 touchdowns. He is going
to threaten or break every major, single season receiving record.
Moss is a player that a quarterback can put complete faith in as he
is still one of the fastest receivers in the league and his hands are
unparalleled. If they win the Super Bowl this year, most of the
credit needs to go to Moss. . .and this is coming from a Michigan
fan that basically worships Tom Brady. . .so there.

NT: I cannot believe you actually think Randy Moss is this
year’s MVP. I suppose the fact that he has been an absolute head-
case for the majority of his career and all of a sudden buckles
down and appears disciplined has nothing to do with the fact that
Brady is his quarterback. Tom Brady has already built a dynasty
in New England with three Super Bowls and two Super Bowl
MVPs, and at the end of his career when all is said and done, he
may be the best quarterback to have ever played the game. If you
take out Tom Brady and put an average or mediocre QB in the
Patriots scheme, what’s their record right now? 2-2? 3-1, at best,
with no real shot at the Super Bowl without Brady at the helm?
Would Randy Moss even be able to play for another QB? Now,
let’s take Randy Moss out of the equation and let’s substitute Wide
Receiver Vincent Jackson from the San Diego Chargers. The Pa-
triots would still be 4-0, Vincent Jackson’s stats would be through
the roof as well, catapulting him into the top 5 for widereceivers,
and the Patriots would be on their way to another Super Bowl
with Tom Brady as their leader. As quarterback, Brady has to take
care of every single aspect of his offense when they’re on the
ﬁeld and he must make the according decisions to lead his team
to victory. Without Brady, there is no Moss. Without Moss, Brady
is still the premier quarterback in the NFL. Tom Brady is the MVP
right now; to even consider someone else is sheer lunacy.

Catholic is last Second prayer falls incomplete .

By Brian Devine
SPORTS WRITER

Washington and Lee football was
picked second in the ODAC preseason
poll primarily based on the strength of its
defense. The ﬁrst two games of the 2007
season showed why.

The Boys in Blue gave up 122 yards to
Franklin and Marshall, then an outstand-
ing 79 yards to a highly touted Averett
squad. Last week’s 322-yard, 42-point
drubbing at the hands of Randolph-Ma-
con had fans wondering, was this an aber-
ration or the defense’s true colors?

On homecoming weekend, in front
of another loud and supportive crowd at
Wilson Field, the Generals sent a clear
message.

The Blue Menace is back and open for
business.

The visiting Catholic University Car-
dinals gained just 45 yards rushing, and
the Generals got their ﬁrst conference
win of the year, 28-21. The visitors went
three-and-out on eleven of their twenty
total drives of the game and were shut
out until 1:20 left in the second quarter.
In the second half Cardinal quarterback
Keith Ricca began to ﬁnd the holes in the
Generals’ zone, defense and ﬁnished with
227 yards passing. Ricca was unable to
pull his team to victory though he came
close.

Down two touchdowns with 33 sec-
onds to go, Ricca led his team 65 yards
on ﬁve plays for a 27-yard touchdown
pass to Miles Sabrick. Just ﬁve seconds

remained on the clock, the Cardinals now
down just seven points. The ensuing on-
side kick was successﬁil and Ricca had
the chance to snatch victory from the
jaws of defeat, but his Hail Mary pass
was knocked down in the end zone.

As fans started to celebrate the narrow
victory, referee Jeff Shears threw a ﬂag
for a questionable late hit on Ricca. This
gave the visitors one last untimed play to
score from the hosts’ 39-yard line. Ricca
was hit by Britt Jamison and dropped the
football. Catholic offensive lineman Rich
Brennan picked it up and began rumbling
toward the end zone. He was stopped by
Bryant Fulk just 22 yards from pay dirt,
and the win was preserved by one touch-

' down.

Catholic’s late-game heroics aside, the
Blue Menace defense was near-perfect.
Catholic’s ﬁrst two touchdowns came
off short drives after two successive R.J.
Varner interceptions late in the ﬁrst half.
Those interceptions helped Catholic turn
a 10-0 deﬁcit into a 14-10 halftime lead.

When the visitors were not gifted with
ﬁeld position, they were mostly unable to
gain yards against Fulk (9 tackles), Scott
Russell (9 tackles, 1 sack) and Mark
Snoddy, who ﬁnally caught an intercep-
tion after recording nine last season.

Vamer’s consecutive interceptions
were the only taint on an excellent perfor-
mance by the Generals’ offense. Tailback
Tom “Chico” Pacicco, fresh off three
100-yard games in a row, set a career best
with 195 yards and one touchdown on

35 carries. “Chico” has improved every
game this season and has quickly become
a fan favorite after spending most of last
season as a backup to the now-graduated
Colton Ward.

Because of the consistent powerful
running of his backﬁeld partner, Varner
was called on to pass only 19 times all
game. He completed seven ofthose pass-
es for 104 yards and one touchdown, to
backup tight end Jason Bacaj, but threw
multiple interceptions for the second
game in a row. Cardinals cornerback
Achilie Kolla shut down W&L’s Jack
Martin, limiting the star wideout to just
three catches and 65 yards and snapping
his streak of consecutive games with a
touchdown at three.

So the “J -Mart” chants from the crowd
were replaced with “Chico” for this game.
and the Generals players and coaches
again acknowledged the loud, standing
section at the 50-yard line at the conclu-
sion of the game. Most of the capacity
crowd again left at halftime, but most of
the alumni seemed to stick around even
after the halftime festivities. The vast ma-
jority of students missed out on the most
exciting ﬁnish to any game this year. in
two weeks, the Boys in Blue will host
their biggest ODAC rival, the Bridgewa-
ter Eagles, on Parents Weekend. This will
undoubtedly be the most important game
of the year for the Generals, and hopeful-
ly students will stick around for the ﬁnish
as a loud and enthusiastic crowd never
goes amiss.

The glass doors of Traveller buses have been kicked in by students, drivers have been verbally abused and
angry mobs of students have swarmed buses and cars. TraveIler’s leadership is promising to take action.

Malicious bus driver, insensitive students mark Homecoming

By Wes 0’Dell
STAFF wmren

The Traveller safe-ride system has been
plagued by several high-proﬁle incidents this
year, the most shocking of which occurred
earlier this month over Homecoming Week-
end.

In the early morning hours of Sunday,

.October 7, the central Traveller dispatcher
received a complaint claiming that a Travel-
ler Express bus driver was drunk on the job
and was charging students money to get off
the bus.

The dispatcher immediately contacted Ed
Bulger, the Public Safety Officer in charge of
Traveller oversight, and gave him the com-
plaining student’s contact information. Bulg-
er then conﬁrmed the report with the student
and took action.

“I had no reason to doubt him,” said Bulg-
er of the student report.

At 2 a.m. that morning, Bulger tele-
phoned the owner of Goff Transportation,
the bus company the school contracts with,
and reported the incident. The owner quickly

agreed to investigate the driver when he re-
ported back to his home base. He furthermore
explained that the driver in question was a
substitute who had gotten in trouble on other
routes for putting up a “tip box” in his bus.
The subsequent investigations conducted
by Washington and Lee University and Goff

“It was wrong, it hap-
pened, we hope it never

happens again. ”

ED BULGER, public safety officer
 

conﬁrmed the ﬁve separate complaints Trav-
eller received concerning that bus. The driver
had charged students a total of $26 that eve-
ning. to exit the bus, and had refused to let
some people leave until they paid up.

In a display of chivalry, one student self-
lessly paid a total of $20 to allow several of
his cashless peers to leave the bus.

The charge of drunk driving was never of-

ﬁcially conﬁrmed or denied, though Senior
Aisha Davis, an otherwise uninvolved party,
reported seeing a Traveller bus driving reck-
lessly that night.

For its part, Goff Transportation issued a
formal apology and didn’t charge W&L for
the bus that night. They also reported that the
driver is now “an ex-employee.”

“It was wrong, it happened, we hope it
never happens again,” said Bulger, who was
praised by the student complainants for his
quick action. _ '

Unfortunately, complaints of a drunk,
money-extorting bus driver were not the only
issues Traveller faced that weekend. Students
and alumni themselves caused their share of
trouble. ,

Traveller has a blanket policy of no bever-
ages on its buses. When one African-Ameri-
can bus driver told a student to either get rid
of his drink or get off the bus, the student re-
sponded with a racial slur and left the bus.

When the driver, a veteran army para-
trooper whom Bulger calls “one of the nicest

Judson Laipply, the star of the YouTube
video “The Evolution of Dance,” spoke about
dating in the Commons theater last Thursday.

“My goal is to raise your relationship I.Q.,”
he said. The speech was interactive and stu-

Students had the opportunity before the pre-
sentation to write questions on index cards, and
Laipply took breaks to answer the anonymous
questions during the program.

There was even a “90-second blitz,” where
both women and men had their respective turns
to air their complaints about the opposite sex.

For anyone who has seen The Dating Doc-
tor in previous years, Laipply used an almost
identical program.

First, he asked students what issues they
thought could end relationships.

Students took turns giving answers like
alcohol(ism), sex, exes, politics and religion.

The audience laughed at outrageous com-

cohol, money, jealousy and sex are common

ics of conﬂict.

“Yes,” he said, “the arguments keep on go-
ing after you get married, just about different
things. Relationships are work.”

Laipply repeated this message several times,
and he said that there are two parts necessary
to a long-term relationship: commitment to the

person and to the relationship itself.

While the many dating doctors (or danc-
ers, in this case) that grace the campus give
solid relationship tips, many students think that
Washington and Lee has an atmosphere that
isn’t conducive to most dating gurus.

“I don’t think he really understood the way
it is here at W&L,” said senior Samantha Hish-
meh, who attended a dinner with Laipply and
members of the Gender Relations Committee.

“We obviously have terrible gender rela-
tions, so I just don’t think that he got it.”

However, Laipply did address issues that
single W&L students can relate to.

“For God’s sake, if someone texts you after
10 p.m. on a weekend, do not think that this
person wants to get in a relationship with you,”
he said to knowing snickers from the crowd.
“That is a sex text.” '

He also brought up money issues say-

Ruscio claims increase needed to
address school is long-term goals

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING emroa

Tuition at Washington and Lee has more than doubled in the
last 10 years, rising from $16,470 in 1998 to $34,650 this year.

And by the time room and board, books and other expenses
are counted, the Office of Financial Aid estimates that this year’s
cost of education is $47,300.

W&L President Ken Ruscio said the tuition increase was
needed to let the university address its long-term needs.

“Our tuition and costs were signiﬁcantly below our peers,"
Ruscio said. “Part of the Board [of Trustees’] reasoning was that
we had signiﬁcant needs in the future.”

But even with the increases, the university’s tuition remains
about $2,000 below the average tuition for the top 25 liberal arts
schools.

The board sets tuition each year after receiving a recommen-
dation from Steve McAllister, the vice president for ﬁnance.

Despite six years of 10 percent tuition increases, Ruscio thinks
middle class families can still send a child to W&L.

“There are middle class families who think they won’t qualify
for ﬁnancial aid but do,” Ruscio said. “We’re mindﬁil of the
squeeze on the middle class and part of it is that we need to tell
the story [of W&L’s ﬁnancial aid packages] better.

McAllister said the board began rapidly increasing tuition in
2001.

“Our student ﬁnancial aid was well below its peers,” he said.
“I guess over the last few years [tuition increases] have been 
trying to address strategic needs, especially more undergraduate
faculty and improvements to facilities.”

Ruscio said the increase in faculty, along with the need for
increasingly expensive scientiﬁc equipment, has driven up costs.
Students expectations have also risen.

“Higher education is just more complex, whether it’s student
health, security or science equipment,” Ruscio said.

McAllister, a university employee since 1993, has seen the
university make major improvements during his tenure.

“When I came here, the Science Center wasn’t complete,"
McAllister said. “There have been big improvements for the
arts, the University Commons and improvements for athletic fa-
cilities as well.”

Wilson Field, the General’s football and lacrosse stadium, is
scheduled for renovations this winter. The Colonnade will also
undergo major interior renovations during the next decade.

“There won ’t be lower tuition, because
the educational experience at Washington
and Lee won ’t change. Interaction with the

faculty won ’t change. ’

KEN RUSCIO, W&L Presldent

The inﬂux of new faculty has cut the annual teaching load
from seven courses to six, and Ruscio is currently proposing
changes to the school’s academic structure that could cut the load
even further.

Most top liberal arts colleges require faculty to teach ﬁve
courses a year, with some requiring only four.

Ruscio’s proposal

Earlier this fall Ruscio unveiled a plan to overhaul the univer-
sity’s academic life. He wants W&L to become a national leader
in discussions about liberal arts education.

Part of the plan calls for Spring Term to shrink from six weeks
to four. Students would focus on taking one intensive class dur-
ing the month-long term.

Ruscio wants faculty to vote on the plan before Christmas.
but even if the plan passes, the shorter school year won’t mean
lower tuition.

“There won’t be lower tuition because the educational experi-
ence at Washington and Lee won’t change,” Ruscio said. “Inter-
action with the faculty won’t change. One reason we’re looking
at this is we want to provide the opportunities we have now at the
level students expect.”

Under the new plan, 108 credits would be required for gradu-
ation. The current requirement is 115 credits, down from the 121
that were required for the Class of 2006. Ruscio said the lower
graduation requirements would not prevent students from taking
additional classes.

But retaining the old course load in a four week Spring Term
would force students to overload their schedules, taking more
credits than recommended by the school’s academic deans.

“All of those experiences we associate with academic quality
won’t change,” Ruscio said.

A major gift

Financial aid got a big boost this summer when Rupert John-
son, a Class of 1962 alumnus who is vice chairman of Franklin
Resources, donated $100 million.

The lion’s share of the money — $85 million — will be used to
pay the full educational expenses for 44 students in each future
class, starting with the freshman entering next fall. Some of the
slots will be merit-based, while others will be need-based.

The student turnout was fairly
small compared to the turnout for

that could have been because of

Laipply ’s Five Characteristics
of a Healthy Relationship:

Justin Laipply gives advice
about the components of healthy
relationships to those currently in
relationships and those seeking
one.

Trust- “Trust is the foundation
and the building block for every
relationship--not just romantic.”

Respect— Mutual. Equal. Earned.

Intimacy- “Not sex... The small I

things in a relationship that you
share with that person and that
person alone.”

Passion- “If you’re dating some-
one, and there’s no passion, it’s
like dating your brother or sister.
Believe me. I’ve tried.” (cue the
West Virginia jokes)

C0mmitment- “Both the rela-
tionship and the person. Things
are going to change. Why? Life
is change.”

Laipply’s Guide to Knowing if
Someone is Interested:

The quicker they want to have
sex, the less long-terrn plans they
have for you.

If they say ‘let’s date other peo-
ple,’ beware, as often, we don’t
really share what we intend to
keep.

Observe the way they treat people
around you. That’s likely to be the
way you end up being treated.

The more personal information
they offer, the more badly they
want to get to know you.

If they are willing to alter their
life to accommodate you, you
matter to them.

with a lower tuition price.

He did say, however, that high
costs had not deterred students
from applying to W&L’s binding
early decision programs.

Rising tuition, of course, is not
a phenomenon isolated to W&L.
Webster said the high cost of pri-
vate schools around the country
has made prospective students
and their parents want more infor-
mation up front about the colleges
they are considering.

“I suspect that the rising cost
of higher education is partly re-
sponsible for the fact that stu-
dents these days apply to a lot of
colleges,” Webster said. “Some
of our applicants apply to 10 or
more other schools.”

A student perspective

Junior Jen Lysenko is a George
Washington Scholar, the Wash-
ington merit scholarship that will

be folded into the new Johnson
Scholarship program.

Lysenko, a biology major, says
the scholarship was instrumental
in getting her onto W&L’s cam-
pus.

“I applied to nine schools,”
Lysenko said, “and W&L was
the only one I applied to without
looking at it. The [George Wash-
ington] interview weekend made
me want to come.”

Lysenko said the visit sold her
on W&L even before she won the
scholarship. But the scholarship
has continued to open up new op-
portunities for her.

“I’m trying to go to dental
school after graduation,” Lysenko
said. “It would be an awful lot
of debt to get myself into, but the
scholarship has been a huge help
ﬁnancially because now I have
money for dental school that I
would have spent on undergradu-

 

ate tuition.”

Using money that she didn’t
have to spend on tuition, Lysenko
spent last Spring Term studying
abroad in Italy. Just weeks after
remming to the United States,
she turned around and ﬂew to Mt.
Kilimanjaro for a two-week trip
with the W&L Outing Club.

Lysenko said the African trip
was the “best experience of [her]
life.”

What’s in store

Ruscio and McAllister both
said the days of 10 percent tuition
increases may be ﬁnally ending.

“I’d guess we’ll be between
[a] 4.5 to 5.5 percent [increase]
next year,” McAllister said.

A ﬁve percent increase would
bring next year’s tuition, room
and board to a combined $46,378,
an increase of about $2,200.

McAllister and Ruscio said

they think ﬁiture increases will be
pegged against increasing costs
of education rather than large
capital expenditures.

And W&L does remain near
or below its peers in the top 25.
Colgate’s tuition for 2006-2007
was $3,155 higher than W&L’s
mark. Grinnell, in contrast, was
the cheapest top 25 school that
year with a tuition of $29,030.

Ruscio said there’s little
chance of tuition decreasing in
the future. He also isn’t expect-
ing any tuition freezes.

“Tuition does not pay the full
cost of student education,” he
said. “The endowment pays a
good chunk of it.”

Massive donations to the en-
dowment would be needed to
make a reduction feasible.

“If you’re thinking about
freezing tuition, you’d need en-
dowment growth well beyond

Plan launched to enhance W&L experience

Entire school community charged with developing a Quality Enhancement Plan

By Alllson chopln
surr wmren

This week markedthe ﬁrst step
in developing a Quality Enhance-
ment Plan (QEP), a necessary
component of Washington and
Lee’s re-accreditation and a plan
that seeks to improve learning.

W&L must be re-accredited
every 10 years by the South-
ern Association of Colleges and
Schools (SACS). As an accredit-
ed member of SACS, the univer-
sity is eligible to receive federal
money such as grants and loans.
This also allows W&L to keep its
position as one of America’s top
colleges.

To be re-accredited, W&L is
required to enhance its commit-
ment to education by putting into
action a proposal that will im-
prove some part of the learning
experience. This is the QEP. The
main requirement is that the plan
should affect the entire commu-
nity, including students, faculty
and staff.

The possibilities for the QEP
are open. The plan can focus
strictly on the classroom, or it
can be extracurricular or a com-
bination. Examples include creat-
ing new study abroad programs,
developing courses that instill
values and morals, improving
technology or even adjusting the
school calendar.

Other SACS member colleges
have already implemented plans
such as these. For example, Da-
vidson College recently developed
a QEP that focuses on a freshman
year writing program, a revision
of the Humanities program, and

drivers around,” asked the pas-
sengers for help in identify-
ing the offending student, none
spoke up.

Bulger issued a formal apol-
ogy on behalf of the students, the
university, and Traveller.

Nor was that the end of Trav-
eller’s troubles that weekend.

Junior Rebecca Koval, a
driver with Traveller Dispatch,
was responding to a call from
a packed Red Square when her
van was swamped by passengers.
When Koval asked them to get
out and make room for the stu-
dents who had called her there,
one passenger riding shotgun
grew hostile.

Holding a female friend in
his lap, the passenger remarked
that he graduated last year and
“knows how the system works.”
He then proceeded to complain
that there were “too many f—ing
people waiting,” and that they
would have to wait for the next
car.

opportunities for in-depth study
across departments.

A committee consisting of fac-
ulty, administrators, students and
staff has been formed to develop
the idea that will become the QEP.
Professor Michael Anderson is the
chairman of the committee.

“Our committee’s first goal is
to help community members un-
derstand what a QEP is, that it is
focused ultimately on students,”
said Anderson.

The student representatives are
freshman Class Presisent Charles
Curry, junior Rich Cleary, and
law student Katy Hall.

These students are enthusiastic
about their role in the process. “I
feel strongly that the plan W&L
proposes will greatly improve
the educational experience,” Hall
said.

The committee also wants to
express that the QEP goes beyond
mere re-accreditation.

“While, of course, receiving a
degree from an accredited univer-
sity is important to students, the
substance of the QEP itself should
play a large role in the campus
learning atmosphere. Hopefully,
the QEP will be transformative
for our community, enhancing
and/or expanding educational op-
portunities,” said Cleary.

In order to choose the idea that
will have the optimal success, the
committee has turned to the en-
tire community. Students, faculty,
and staff are asked to submit their
ideas. They can do so by visiting
the webpage at QEP.wlu.edu or
by dropping their suggestions in
boxes in the Marketplace, Elrod
Commons, or the Law School’s

“I’m not getting out of the
car, b——ch,” he then told Koval.
“I paid tuition for four years. . .so
drive me, b—ch.”

Koval contacted her dis-
patcher, who advised her to take
the hostile passenger where he
wanted to go for her own safety.
“I should’Ve went to the‘ police
[who were nearby],” Koval said
in retrospect.

Now in her second year of
driving, Koval said that she had
never been verbally abused in
that manner; “I’ve never had to
raise my voice to a passenger.”

“I can’t say my experience
[over Homecoming] is unique,”
she added.

Traveller’s incident reports
bear that out.

The year did not start auspi-
ciously; the Friday before Ori-
entation Week saw a law student
dispatch driver verbally harassed
by a group of students claiming
to be afﬁliated with the Cadaver
Society; they blocked the road
and shouted obscenities while
one ﬂashed the Cadaver emblem
on his cell phone and threatened

Brief Stop in Sydney Lewis Hall.

“It’s very important that the
community understand that all
of us are charged with coming up
with a QEP,” Anderson said.

All suggestions must be sub-
mitted by November l 6. Aﬁer this
date, the committee will evaluate
all suggested ideas. The top three
submissions will be presented‘ to
Provost June Aprille by January
or February. This is when the Pro-
vost and administration will take

over in implementing one of the
ideas.

To narrow down the sugges-
tions, the committee must con-
sider which ideas ﬁt the criteria
for the QEP. The plan must focus
on learning, affect a large portion
of the community and agree with
W&L’s Mission Statement. The
effect on learning must be able to
be measured over time. Potential
cost will also be evaluated.

“We are blessed by being in
a community with the ability to
bring resources and talent to a
project. The campus environment
is so dynamic, there are always
ways to build upon our traditions
in creative and new ways. I have

picking them up.

The door glass on one Travel-
ler bus was kicked out by rowdy
students. Dispatch cars have
been mobbed by angry crowds.
Riders have provoked the po-
lice into boarding the buses on
multiple occasions. Dispatch di-
rectors have been harassed over
the phone by irate inebriated stu-
dents.

Traveller’s student chair, Yin-
yan Li, was most surprised by
the number of incidents that have
cropped up so early in the school
year.

“Things came to a head very
quickly,” she said.

Traveller made headlines
last Spring Term during Alumni
Weekend, when widespread row-
diness drew a quick rebuke from
student leaders.

Li’s greatest concern is stu-
dents misconstruing Traveller’s
true purpose. “It can’t be seen as
a taxi service...it’s purpose is to
get you home, not to parties.”

Likewise, Koval is concerned
that students see Traveller as an

sometime next semester we are
going to have an exciting pro-
gram,” said Anderson.

The proceedings of the com-
mittee will be continually made
public. Anyone in the community
will be able to read updates on the
website in the near future.

While committee members are
conﬁdent about the future success
of the QEP, some students have
their doubts about how much the
plan can actually achieve.

“I think some of the ideas the
school will get might be difﬁcult
to implement, so even though
students will be suggesting ideas
that we all want, they won’t be
chosen by the school. I think the
school will pick something sort of
in the middle between changing
something radically and keeping
things pretty similar to how they
are now,”,freshman Greg Franke
said.

Curry, Cleary and Hall are
currently reaching out to various
groups of students in order to en-
courage responses. They also of-
fer a potential prize: anyone who
submits an idea will be entered
into a drawing to win a video
iPod.

More than 30 ideas have been
received in the ﬁrst few days.

The committee members are
optimistic about the response and
support they will continue to re-
ceive.

“One of W&L’s strengths is its
pro-active student body, and the
request for QEP submissions is a
way for students to demonstrate
just how much they care about
their university,” said Hall.

entitlement and consequently for-
get that it is student volunteerism
that extends W&L’s community
of trust to its safe ride system.

“If we weren’t in the bubble
[that is W&L],” she said, “they’d
be arrested.”

Nonetheless, Koval is thank-
ful for the majority of passen-
gers, who she says are respectful
and grateful. She sees her work
with Traveller as serving the
W&L community.

“I do it because I like helping
people,” she said.

Despite the very public trou-
bles of the current school year, Li
is pleased that student ridership
numbers continue to rise. “More
students are taking responsibil-
ity [for getting themselves home
safely],” she said.

Bulger is also pleased that
students continue to show inter-
est in Traveller, both in riding it
and driving for it.

He does sound a cautionary
note, though; “We’re bound and
determined to stop [the abuse of
drivers],” he said.

  WIS pick of the Week

ByAlexSkaggs
smrr wnnrn

The Williams Investment Society, known to students as WIS, is
a student-run organization that is entrusted with investing part of the
school’s endowment. The goup currently holds stock in 27 companies,
and over the past four years, has consistently performed better than the
Standard & Poor 500. WIS consists of 7 investment groups: technol-
ogy, ﬁnancials, energy, basics, healthcare, non-cyclical, and cyclical.
This week, the cyclical group is featured.

“As the cyclical group, our job is to ﬁnd stocks that move in tandem
with the overall economy,” said Cyclical Investment Head Barron Mar-
tin. If the overall state of the economy rises or falls, so will a cyclical
company’s stock prices.

WIS’s latest cyclical stock pick is Joy Global, Inc. (JOYG). Joy
Global is the worldwide leader in mining equipment, parts, and ser-
vices, with a market share of about 60 percent. Mining stocks are con-
sidered cyclical because as the economy grows, they grow: businesses
need more energy and materials from mining companies as they pro-
duce more goods. About 51 percent of Joy Global’s revenues come
from international markets, leading to enormous potential for overseas
growth in emerging markets. However, it has been largely overlooked
by US analysts because the American coal market is so weak. Martin
blames this weak market on the US’s recent abnormally mild weather.

“In the next couple of years, we expect weather patterns to revert to
normal, so coal excavation should increase. This, along with enormous
growth in emerging markets and the oil sands region of Canada, should
drive revenue growth for years to come,” he said. The oil sands region
of Canada contains an estimated 174 billion barrels of economically
recoverable oil, which can only be recovered by shallow mining.

According to the cyclical group’s WIS’s calculations, Joy Global is
the most undervalued company in their market. They determined the
fair value to be around $70 per share, which is roughly 35 percent above
its current price.

WIS’s presentation this Friday will feature a full analysis of this
stock option, as well as an overview of their decision to sell Carnival
Cruise Lines (CCL).

WIS stock picks are strictly the opinions of the aforementioned in-
dustry group and should not be used as the basis for individual acquisi-
tions. Always consult your personal ﬁnancial advisor before making an

investment decision, as all stock investments carry risk. Past results are
not necessarily indicative of future performance.

Halloween Big Leagues

The clothes make the man, so avoid the store-bought costumes and be original

By crlghton Allen
snxrr wnnsn

Say tomorrow you ﬁnd yourself walking to
class next to someone whom you don’t know
very well. As the silence builds to an awkward
level, you begin to search your mind for a
question to ask to alleviate the tension.

Before resorting to the wom—out go-to
“Are you going out tonight/Did you go out
last night,” think a little bit harder about what
holiday is just around the comer.

That’s right, it’s Halloween. Instead, you
could ask that person, “What are you dressing
up as for Halloween?”

Oh yes, you had better believe they will be
dressing up for Halloween and you should be
too. I A

Dressing up for Halloween during that awk-
ward age of 14 might have made you a “loser”
then, but this isn’t seventh grade anymore.

It’s college, the big leagues. You need to
dress up and you need to bring your A-game.

Costumes make Halloween.

Candy is great, no doubt about it, but you
can get that any time of year. Rare is the oc-
casion when one can go out in absolutely any-
thing that can be justiﬁed as a costume without
winding up on “What Not to Wear.”

Halloween costumes give you the freedom
to be for one night whom you have always
secretly longed to be, but have been afraid to
manifest that persona in public.

Fellas, are you feeling a need to embrace
your inner guido? There’s still time to join a
tanning salon, dye your hair platinum blond,
and ﬁnd a track suit or tight-ﬁtting silk de-
signer shirt (popped collar, of course) before

MyGreeks

the big night.

Ladies, have you logged some serious gym
time lately and want to show off your newly
improved body but afraid of being labeled if

that.

Encourage your professors to get into the
spirit as well and to lecture in costume on Hal-

sion over your research paper’s thesis, seek
their counsel about which outﬁt you should
wear. Your professors truly care about you as
an individual and want you to look your best.

Cultivating a campus-wide excitement over
Halloween is just what W&L needs. The more
people that become involved with the festivi-
ties, the better the experience will be for all
who participate.

See you out Halloween night.

People not wicked but do precious little-1to'form‘Ivirtuous members from freshmen

By Dane Boston
COLUMNIST

It’s a rotten thing to be misconstrued. Do I
not express my thoughts clearly? Do I ask too
many rhetorical questions?

Such was my dilemma after reading last
week’s Ring-Tum Phi. I found myself excori-
ated for an article I didn’t know I’d written. I
grant that the author of the letter to the editor,
an alumnus who disliked my treatment of our
Greek system, makes no personal attacks or
outlandish statements. But his letter stings me
just the same, because I never thought myself
guilty of the crime for which I stand accused.

Apparently in an editorial playfully entitled
“Test Everything Possible,” in which I elabo-
rate on and attempt to apply the lessons we ﬁnd
hidden in a Latin phrase on the school crest,
I say things that Steve Scully, Class of 1976,
construes as an attack on the Greek system.

insist that not all ways are equal.

There are ways to go through the Univer-
sity guided by a devotion to and reverence for
the principles of honor and liberal learning
from which we construct our identity and draw
our strength. There are ways to go through the
University shaped by a commitment to self-
improvement and the improvement of this
campus community and the wider community
we inhabit. There are ways to go through the
University that challenge and destroy the ste-
reotypes, preconceptions, and falsehoods that
hold us back as individuals and as a group.

These ways honor the legacy of supportive
alumni, the work of committed faculty, and the
vision of our great namesakes.

But there are other ways of going through
the University, ways that disgrace the moral
foundations of this place. I do not contend that
the people who go through Washington and
Lee enjoying the active party scene are wick-

What regard is there in the Greek system for human dignity

when fraternities degrade men and call it bonding, or disgrace

women and call it great fun? I accuse the Greek system.

Now I don’t mind being disagreed with.
A good debate or battle keeps us on our toes
and forces us to confront the inconsistencies
and weak points in our thinking. But if people
ﬁnd in my writing something I didn’t put there,
then there must be something at fault with my
writing. If I have euphemized or dallied with
my argument, I have done a disservice to my-
self and anyone who condescended to read my
poor scribbles.

So let me set the record straight, once and
for all. My editorial was not in any way an at-
tack on the Greek system. I encourage students
to consider the institution honestly, fairly, and
critically.

My editorial was an attack on the blind ac-
ceptance of tradition and senseless acquies-
cence to unreasonable and unhealthy practices
and activities.

I stand by my statement that freshmen
should investigate and test all of our traditions,
accepting the good and rejecting those that run
afoul of sound principles and common sense.

To reiterate, my editorial of several weeks
ago was_not an attack on the Greek system. But
since I’ve never been one to accept credit for
something I didn’t do, please accept the fol-
lowing attack on the Greek system.

As Mr. Scully states in his letter, “there are
as many ways to go through W&L as there are
students that have and will attend the Univer-
sity.” This I cannot deny, but I must fervently

ed. They have as much a right to revel in the
social life of Lexington as others have to em-
brace wholeheartedly the intellectual life.

I do not claim that fraternities take good
men and corrupt them or twist them into evil
perversions of the collegiate ideal. There are
good men and women whom I know and love
dearly who have done great things through
their fraternities and sororities.

I have, however, seen precious little evi-
dence to convince me that fraternities take
freshmen men with little sense of moral obli-
gation and duty to others and work to instill
those virtues in them. Instead, I have seen im-
pressionable, malleable young men drawn into
organizations that laugh at exploitation and
encourage intemperance in every vice.

I have witnessed the disastrous ripples
spread through every layer of campus life,
dividing and stratifying the student body and
pitting us all against the larger Rockbridge
community.

I do not accept, as an answer to my criticism,
tales of the good done by our Greek organiza-
tions. Thousands of hours of volunteering and
thousands of dollars in charity cannot atone for
thousands of men and women deceived by elit-
ism into doubting their very self-worth.

The good done by Greek organizations
ought to have nothing to do with philanthropy
but with empowering, edifying, and enlight-
ening members. It ought to blend seamlessly
with the academic experience, reinforcing the

lessons of a liberal education.

These clubs ought not drown students in a
sea of cheap beer (a process commonly called
rushing) and then grind them down under
boulders of physical and emotional abuse (or
pledgeship in the language of the people).

What regard is there in the Greek system
for human dignity when fraternities degrade
men and call it bonding, or disgrace women
and call it great fun?

I accuse the Greek system.

Some may argue that it is not responsible
for the culture that limits and degrades this ex-
traordinary University. Such people must not
have any regard for the simple demograph-
ics of this place. If eighty percent of our stu-
dent body enjoys some level of involvement
in Greek life, and problems of sexual assault
and alcohol abuse persist at or exceed national
levels, the Greek houses should respond vigor-
ously, uncompromisingly, and relentlessly.

Some will say that the problems I lay at the
feet of our cherished fraternities plague every
college campus. To them I say that for three
years I have listened to empty rhetoric about
the difference fraternities and sororities make
here and the unique culture we cultivate. Where
is their differing inﬂuence in these grave con-
cerns? How does our unique culture respond to
these pressing issues whose apparent ubiquity
threatens to consume our entire generation?

We have no excuse to share the vices of oth-
er campuses. This is W&L in old Lexington,
saved from ruin by no less a man than George
Washington and from irrelevance by Robert E.
Lee himself. Ought we not to hold ourselves to
higher standards and loftier ideals?

Cast off base hypocrisy! Let us open our
eyes and assess the situation frankly and hon-
estly. Not as an independent, but as a proud
student of this ﬁne school, I say I have had
enough.

The preceding paragraphs constitute an at-
tack on the Greek system. It is not an attack on
the many ﬁne people in the Greek system, but
on the organizations in spite of whose inﬂu-
ence those people are good.

I hope the many ﬁerce defenders of our
“time—honored tradition” will seriously con-
sider whether friendships and memories (of
which I have many, and none made by endur-
ing the patented bonding techniques of our in-
stitutional torturers) are a good enough excuse
for stratiﬁcation, degradation, and rampant in-
temperance.

We have come to college to think hard about
real things; we must not simply “live and let
live,” for that is the unexamined life not worth
living. Instead, let us live well, and gently help
others to do the same.

After three years of observation I believe
that the Greek organizations do not support
that goal, and should therefore be dramatically
reformed or abandoned.

Kappa Sigma
article deceptive

Unclear that sophomores were
only pledges, never truly initiated .

To the Editor,

I am writing to express concern with the article entitled
“Beta offers 12 bids to former Kappa Sigs.”

The ﬁrst issue in the article that is, at best, unclear is the
author’s relationship to the quoted alurrmus, Bill Kientz. If the
quoted individual is related to the article’s editor, that ought
to be disclosed. If this isn’t the case, the coincidence deserves
clariﬁcation in the text.

The statement that “Price has already extended 14 bids to
upperclassmen, 12 of whom are former Kappa Sigs,” is also
extremely problematic. The article does not explain that the 12
“former Kappa Sigs” are in fact all sophomores—technically
upperclassmen, but usually not referred to as such. In addition
to allowing readers to believe that former Junior and Seni
Kappa Sigmas are joining Beta, it does not draw a distinction
between those who were afﬁliated with Kappa Sig for 3 years
and those who were pledges for 3 weeks-the article makes no
mention that the 12 were former pledges, and never actual initi-
ates.

The entire reference to Kappa Sigmas in the article is, in my
view, misleading. The tone of the article leads the reader to
believe that Junior and Senior Kappa Sigs are joining Beta. This
is absolutely not the case.

Moreover, one student quoted in the article is referred to as
a “former Kappa Sig.” In the 2005-2006 school year, this in-
dividual was a Kappa Sigma pledge for less than a quarter of
New Member Education before ‘fdepledging” of his own ac-
cord. I believe that referring to a man as a “former member” —
an fraternity into which he was never initiated and from which
he chose to immediately disafﬁliate more than a year ago is
misleading.

Sarah Kientz is typically an excellent reporter, but I’m afraid
that this article suffered from a signiﬁcant failure in editorial
oversight.

Sincerely,

George Hunter ‘08 ,

Ed. 3‘ note.‘ Hunter is the former of Kappa Sigma president.

Campus support for
pregnant students

Options for those who want to stay at W&l

Dear Editor,

We write in response to a letter in the October 8, 2007 is-
sue regarding the possibilities for pregnant students at W&L.
While we appreciate the spirit in which the letter was writte
we would like to correct the assertion that “we have no supprﬁ
systems for a student to continue her education on this campus
and be pregnant.”

We have since had some great conversations with the stu-
dent who submitted that letter to inform her of the multitude of
services provided for students who choose to remain a student
when dealing with an unexpected pregnancy as well as should
a student choose to remain at W&L. However, since the letter
has such wide readership, we thought it important to disabuse
readers of the notion that there is no support for students who
ﬁnd themselves in this situation.

W&L offers comprehensive student health services to its
students as shared in orientation and with students throughout
their time at W&L. This includes pregnancy counseling ay
connecting students with area resources. There have, in f ,
been students (both male and female) who have chosen to re-
main at W&L and parent.

In Spring 2006, Students for Life sponsored a pregnancy
resource forum, with an outside consultant from a nationally-
based organization, that asked campus leaders to discuss re-
sources for students with an unexpected pregnancy.

Following that forum, W&L was actually singled out by
the leader of that national organization as the University that
provided more services and assistance than any other college
or university she had ever visited. Like all of the University’s
services, care is offered case-by-case and sensitive to the needs
of individual students.

One might then argue “Why don’t I know this?” That is o e
reason we write this letter today. It is possible to be a parent ah
a student while at Washington and Lee.

Working with students who ﬁnd themselves with an unex-
pected pregnancy is one of the many services offered to W&L
students. Our Student Health Services works with health—related
issues from A - Z.

The Dean of Students Ofﬁce works with students to navigate
academic adjustments that might be necessary for a new parent
including obtaining course reductions if needed. The Dean of
Students Office and Student Health Services work together to
help secure the many items necessary for new parents and in-
fants and, as needed, obtain appropriate housing.

If you’re interested in working to spread the word about
health-related services at W&L, we encourage you to partici-
pate in LIFE, the peer health education group on campus. T
University also has student organizations that support both pro-
life and pro-choice stances for interested students.

What’s most important in this conversation is that W&L
works hard to support students no matter the individual situa-
tion in which a student ﬁnds him or herself?-welcoming a new
child into this world is not an exception to this.

  Facebook Validation

With all the applications and the intrusive mini-feed, addiction is easy

if  ‘ff

By Grace Andrews
C0 LU M N l ST

Oh, the latest pop culture phenomena-
Facebook.

First, I want to discuss the expansion of
F acebook. The F acebook was started as a
project of a Harvard student that was to be ex-
clusively for college students, or people with
university e-mail addresses. The problem was
that not every college was on F acebook.

As of a year ago, F acebook was opened to
everyone. And when I say everyone, I mean
everyone—their moms, grandfathers, and ﬁfth
cousins twice removed. To make matters
worse, they even developed a high school edi-
tion.

The expansion didn’t bother me until they
allowed for the high school Facebook and
college Facebook and regular Facebook to
become one conglomerate. I personally felt
upset and cheated when this occurred.

Facebook was created during my senior
year in high school and was the holy grail of
social networks, or at least I thought it was.

The fact that it was only for college stu-
dents and a limited number of them, made me
feel like being a part of it was “special” and
thus would make me “special.”

Oh the na'1'veté of youth! Now, Facebook
has just opened the door for anybody to en-
ter the Facebook world, making it less presti-
gious and exciting.

Also, maybe l’ve just watched too many
“Lifetime” movies, but the idea of total
strangers between the ages of 14-100 interact-
ing virtually makes me a little nervous. With
Facebook stalkers and creepy individuals
randomly adding people they don’t know and
poking them, one has a right to worry.

Stalking brings me to my second issue
with Facebook—applications. There are cur-

rently 5,500 different applications available to
Facebook users.

Do you know what I call that many appli-
cations? If you said “foolishness,” then you
are correct. How in the hot mess is someone
supposed to use over 5,000 applications?

Some apps, such as the graffiti one, are
just nonsense. Seriously, a grafﬁti application;
Facebook isn’t a bridge by the street corner, so
there’s no need to be drawing anything on it.

I’m judging every person who has over
10, and those will not be positive judgments.
(Takes a quick moment of silence to judge all
the people with too many darn applications.)

However, besides the apps, the bane of my
existence is the mini-feed. The mini-feed ap-
plication is basically the virtual equivalent to
a big-haired small town gossip, telling stories
about your life to anyone who will listen.

Granted, you can turn off your mini-feed
or only set it to report certain proﬁle changes.

One could basically say that the mini-feed
is a validation system especially for those in
college.

For example whenever someone becomes
a “couple,” the relationship isn’t recognized
until you’re together on Facebook.

I know this sounds like straight-up fool-
ishness, but it’s true. Just the other day, I was
conﬁrming that my friend had ended a rela-
tionship by looking at their F acebook proﬁle.
It’s sad, and I know it. I took a moment to
judge myself.

To make matters worse, Facebook is now
informing you of people’s moods, heritage,
and horoscopes. Pretty soon, Facebook will
be mapping out a strand of your DNA and
reporting your blood type on mini-feed. The
future is limitless, but in the case of Facebook,
let’s hope not.

Facebook is not the end-all be all of hu-
manity and shouldn’t be treated as such; it

also shouldn’t be used as a personal diary and
online scrapbook of every moment you’ve
ever had. I mean honestly, no one cares that
you slept till noon. There’s no reason to cap-
ture that digitally and then make a 15-picture
album of it entitled “Sleep Saturday.”

And while I’m at it, I advise that people
not put pictures of themselves participating in
activities that others do in dark alleyways and
behind garbage cans. If you are doing some-
thing that resulted in Whitney Houston down-
fall, Lindsay Lohan’s rehab stay, or Britney
looking a hot mess at the VMAs, don’t put it
on Facebook. This is not Amsterdam, and no
one wants to see all that.

We also do not want to read all that, so if
you ﬁnd yourself pouring out your heart in a
note, do not send it to your friends. F acebook
notes are only fun if they are a mass “thank
you,” an enlightening tidbit, or a joke. If your
notes result in a tearful episode or a bout of
“Oprah” watching, just leave it alone.

I want to let you all know that if you ﬁnd
yourself checking your Facebook several
times a day or more, receive e-mail notiﬁca-
tions for every application, and shake uncon-
trollably when you go a full 24 hours without
F acebook—you may be an addict.

As a member of FA (Facebookers Anon-
oymous) I know how hard it can be to kick
the habit. But look, I did it, so I know you
can too!

Despite the fact that Facebook can be a bit
intrusive, application-happy, and downright
addictive—I still love it. It’s a great way in
which I can keep in touch with those random
people I haven’t seen since grade school and
don’t want to call, or quite frankly even see.

It’s wonderful for keeping in touch, if only
at a superﬁcial level.

Guilt fuels diversity initiatives

School programs imply non”-white‘stua'ents* aren ’t capable

By Cody Beauchamp
COLU M NIST

I hesitate to write this article.

I want to talk about “diversity” at Washington & Lee.
I hope to make well-reasoned critiques of the way the
school treats diversity; I hope to do this even though I’m
a white, straight, Protestant male—the one demographic
set that it seems can never be critical concerning diver-
sity.

I’m not sure l’ll be able to get away with this without
being branded a bigot, but hopefully I can pull this 0E.

The truth is, W&L has never done diversity well. Over
most of our history, we were one of the most white, most
Southern, most homogeneous colleges in the world.

Sure, John Chavis became the ﬁrst African-American
with a college degree in 1800, and it bore the Washington
College name. But Chavis was a hero of the Revolution-
ary War, one of the brilliant John Witherspoon’s private
students, a genius. He was the exception, not the rule.

W&L would not admit another black student until
1966, another undergrad until 1968.

The law school did not admit women until 1972, the
undergraduate programs until 1985.

Foreign students were so odd and noteworthy—until
just recentlyethat French alumnus Philippe Labro even
wrote a book-tumed movie about an odd-man-out for-
eign student, “L 'Etudiant étranger.”

Historically, we’re not good at diversity.

I think this history of ours might explain the current
state of affairs.

By current state of affairs, I’m referring to the tenden-
cy by students and administrators to go arguably too far
in the other direction. After 200+ years of being a white,
conservative, male school, it seems like we’re trying to
make up for lost time with a plethora of initiatives and an
abundance of being overly politically correct.

The school’s brass seems to go out of their way to
mention how seriously the school is committed to di-
versity. The administration has supported numerous
initiatives aimed at increasing the presence of minority
students and groups in the forefront of our community’s
thoughts.

They sponsor awareness weeks, special meals in the
D-Hall, speakers, etc.

I can’t help but wonder if the sum total is that we’re
making our non-white students tokens.

When you have special programs designed to help
non-white students “transition” into life at W&L, I can’t
help but think that you’re sending the message that they
need help transitioning, that they can’t do so on their
own.

The same goes for any kind of special event aimed at

Oil Exchange & Lube

putting minorities into the forefront of the W&L commu-
nity. I’ve no problem with minorities being in the fore-
front of the W&L community-it’s the “putting” them
there part that bothers me.

Are we saying that they wouldn’t have been capable
of getting their on their own?

Perhaps the case-in-point that got me thinking about
this would be the election of our latest Homecoming
Queen.

Quiana McKenzie’s crowning shouldn’t have stirred
up even the least bit of controversy, yet it did.

Quiana is a perfectly qualiﬁed representative of
W&L--she’s smart, dedicated to the school, a key player
in God-knows-how-many organizations and clubs; an
ideal person to recognize with an honor such as Home-
coming Queen.

Yet, in polite—that is private—circles I’ve heard some
people express shock that a black woman was made our
Homecoming Queen.

In other circles, I’ve heard people exclaim how laud-
able it is that she’s championing the cause of diversity by
winning the honor.

In both cases, I can’t help but laugh a little. Honestly,
can’t it just be that Quiana is a great representative and a
deserving winner? Why does she have to become a sym-
bol for some greater, really rather pointless, struggle to
promote diversity at W&L?

That’s the way this school must treat anything remark-
able a non-white, non-male does, I suppose. After 200+
years of being retrospectively too white, too male, and
too homogeneous, we’re feeling guilty.

We can’t just applaud our minority students because
they’re excellent students; we must applaud them on
principle just because they add to our “diversity.”

We can’t just applaud cases like Quiana’s winning
Homecoming Queen because she’s an exceptionally de-
serving person; we’ve got to cheer a little louder because
she happens to be a deserving black, female person.

Personally, I’m just hoping I can live to see the day
when we don’t need to have special programs for mul-
ticultural students, where we don’t need to have admin-
istrators swear to the high heavens we’re committed to
diversity. '

I’m hoping I see another non-white Homecoming
Queen crowned when no one really cares what color
her skin is, or what religion she follows, or where she’s
from.

I’m hoping that in a few years, maybe decades if
needed, we can quit trying to push diversity, and instead
just watch it happen naturally.

I’m hoping, in short, for the day when Washington
and Lee does diversity right.

W&L’s arrogant babies

How should we describe recent student ac-
tions on the Traveller sober ride system?

Embarrassing comes to mind. So does ap-
palling.

How could W&L students and
alumni call one driver a racial slur
and call a student driver a b—ch?

Our actions are so astonishing
that they almost defy words.

We absolutely love to talk about
Lee’s code of gentlemanly—and
lady-like—conduct.

But our actions increasingly
make that ﬁne talk look like point-
less drivel.

Sure, it’s easy to be a gentle-
man or lady on the Hill. But out at
Windfall Hill, we live by another
standard.

Parents, aren’t you thrilled to see how your
children act away from home?

This isn’t a new problem. Traveller driv-
ers have been reporting harassment by students
since last year.

You can hardly blame one driver for wanting
to be paid before he let students off his bus.

His actions were inexcusable but no worse
than the actions of W&L’s students.

We’re not ladies and gentlemen. We’re ar-
rogant college kids with a major sense of en-
titlement.

“But wait!” you say. “These problems are
just the actions of a small majority.”

That might be true, but this “small major-
ity” has certainly been busy in the last year.

And we’ve heard nothing from the majority
of students.

There have been no protests by students, no
calls for accountability. Nothing.

I’m sure most students are genuinely upset
by the behavior. And most are courteous, re-

spectful riders on Traveller.

But this silence needs to stop.

When the African-American driver asked
other students to help identify the one who
yelled at him, nobody spoke up.

What a bunch of cowards we are.

If normal students won’t take action when
their peers act like arrogant jerks, it’s time for
student government to get involved.

Traveller drivers—both students and Goff
employees—should turn to the SJC for assis-
tance.

Next time a student uses the N-word on
Traveller, the SJC should ﬁne the student, ban
him from Traveller and even consider a sus-
pension.

When a call for civil conduct can’t get re-
sults, maybe punishments will.

Normally we’re strong advocates of free
speech, but no student has a right to use that
sort of language.

Students have famously short memories.
None of them have been on campus long
enough to remember the DUls and alcohol-re-
lated trafﬁc deaths that plagued W&L just 5-10
years ago.

If this keeps up, Traveller’s student driv-
ers will have no reason to keep working. Who
wants to be yelled at all night?

And if the Traveller system collapses, it’s
just a matter of time before a drunk student
dies while trying to drive on a winding, coun-
try road.

Is this what drunk, impatient W&L students
want? To see Traveller shut down?

How many times do we need to be told that
this is not a taxi system? The purpose is to
get students home safely, not whisk you around
Rockbridge County free of charge.

These actions make us embarrassed to call
ourselves Washington and Lee students.

8 TA F F W R I TE R

The students of Washington and Lee
University insist that our campus has
something more than the average college
campus. We have more history, more
prestige, but most of all, a greater sense
of welcoming than any other college
community.

However, at times we fail to realize
that this ambience of acceptance is not in-
herent within these antebellum columns.
In fact, it is the work of those who walk
up and down the Colonnade, in front of
Lee Chapel, and into the Commons.

To put it simply, each individual at
W&L strives to make this university
what it truly is: a family.

This “family thing” is something that
grows within every student and faculty
member who walks through this place.
Yet, even within our family, there are
those who nurture and enrich our lives to
epic dimensions. We must regard them as
more than just a cornerstone for this tradi-
tion, but love them as the support system
for this family. W&L Traﬁic Coordina-
tor and Security Guard Thomas “Baner”
Bane has been this foundation for what
he called “the family thing at Washington
and Lee.”

For over three decades, he has wel-
comed freshmen and their parents to this
seemingly daunting campus and worked
endlessly to quell the fears of both parent
and child. Battling through the worry and
sorrow of all family members present on
move-in day, Baner fought to comfort
and usher in a sense of both acceptance
and calm with his words. Oftentimes, his
mere presence successfully eased the sor-
row of parting and brought to light the
sweeter aspects of embarking on a new
educational life.

His wife, Doris Bane, wishes to honor
both Baner and the students he inspires
through a book about her husband.

While “Family and Honor” took only
a year to write, Bane insists the urge to
write this book has lasted for “over thirty
years.” However, she wishes her readers
to note that this book does notpaint her
husband as a saint or legendary ﬁgure.

“This isn’t a brag book about Baner,”
Bane said. “It’s to honor him and to hon-
or the students and alumni we’ve shared
memories with.”

Baner never felt the need for the rec-
ognition of his extraordinary kindness.

“To him, there was no great praise or
acknowledgement needed,” Bane wrote.

“He was just fulﬁlling a promise he made
to thousands of parents as they prepare
to leave campus after freshman move-
in weekend—‘Ya’ll go home now, your
son or daughter will be just ﬁne here,
cause they’re part of our family now at
W&L.”’

To the luck and surprise of genera-
tions of students, Baner did all he could
to uphold and honor this promise. It is
through his actions, rather than his words
(also known as“Banerisms)” that earn
him legendary status.

“My desire is to honor Baner as he
has not only spoken of this family thing
at Washington and Lee, but has lived it
as he interacts with the students, parents,

“This isn ’t a brag book
about Baner. Its to honor
him and to honor the stu-
dents and alumni we ’ve

shared memories with. ”

Dorls Bane, author of Family and Honor
 

alunmi, faculty and staff,” Bane explains.
Indeed, the inspiration for the book
stemmed from observing this interaction
her husband had with the W&L students.

Last spring, the Phi Kappa Sigma fra-
ternity invited the Banes to a dinner they
were hosting the night before the upcom-
ing graduation ceremonies. During the
meal, they awarded Baner lifetime mem-
bership into their fraternity, officially
making this security guard their brother.

The plaque he received read, “Baner
is hereby awarded the distinction of life-
time membership in Phi Kappa Sigma—
In recognition of his steadfast protection,
guidance, support and most of all, for
showing us by friendship the true mean-
ing of the Washington and Lee Family.”

During the conversations following
her husband’s acceptance of the award,
the emotional reactions of the students
inspired her to write this book. The book
includes stories of how Baner strives to
protect students and how greatly the stu-
dents love him for his efforts.

The W&L community has supported
Bane in her endeavor.

“The response from the alumni has
been phenomenal; not so much as in the

number of responses I received, but in
the depth of emotion and sincerity as to
how their college years at Washington

and Lee were enhanced by Baner,” Bane ’

says. Any letter she has received from
a student has been “...from the heart,”
Bane observes.

Yet what else would we expect from
this family? As trite as it may sound, Ba-
ner has impacted the lives and touched
the hearts of many who venture through
these red brick buildings. It is only appro-
priate that the W&L family gives back a
little bit of the heart Baner so willingly
offered.

After printing over 3,000 copies, Mrs.
Bane will not exactly be destitute. Yet,
after being asked what all of that men-
ey is going towards, Mrs. Bane remains
humble and true to her husband.

“I’m going to pay off the original
$10,000 loan to get the book published. ..
so the book will be debt free,” Bane
promises. “If I didn’t make another dime,
it would be okay. Just to see Baner read
the emails and letters...and seeing them
on the pages of “Family and Honor”. . .is
worth millions of dollars to me.”

The book signing will be held in
Elrod Commons the Friday and Saturday
of Parents’ Weekend. On Friday, Mrs.
Bane will be signing books from 1:00 un-
til 4:O0 and again on Saturday from 1 1 :00
until 2:00 that afternoon.

Those who are unable to attend the
signing or cannot obtain a copy of the
book should feel free to email Mrs. Bane
at banerandi@yahoo.com.

Instead of the traditional refreshments
for a book signing, Mrs. Bane will hand
out a complimentary packet of tissues
with each copy of the book because, as
she maintains, “You’re going to need it!”

Overall, the book’s title, “Family and
Honor,” speaks volumes of the intentions
and contents of this book. It will speak
to the tradition of community within this
university and the honor each student or
faculty and staff member feels in uphold-
ing it.

However, Mrs. Bane’s book goes one
step further and connects the two: her
purpose is to honor this “family thing”
for which her husband puts his life on the
line.

“This book will. . .honor the many
students who have walked through the
Colonnade on the W & L campus that
is so rich in tradition, goals and honor,
that does not stop as they walk across the
stage to get their diploma, but is carried
with them for the rest of their lives.”

An Alternative Program

Get experience while a student with Teach Kentucky

By Michele Farquharson
smrr wrmrn

Teach Kentucky is a program established in the
City ot’L»’ uisville to bring a young. new, invigorate-
ing set ofteachcrs to Kentucky’s public schools in
order to revitalize the teaching community. While
Teach Kentucky is similar to Teach for America, it

‘is a localized program that provides a more consis-

. rent support group for the teachers. Those selected

for the program move to Kentucky and go through
me University of Louisville’s alternative teaching
program while committing two years to teaching in
‘heir public school system. They will also be given
a family in Louisville to mentor them throughout
their two years in Louisville.

Joe Franzen graduated from W&L in 2006 as
the recipient of the Sally G. Ball Award. The Ball
.-‘award is a $4,000 salary stipend that goes to a col-
I ge graduate who shows promise in the teaching
ill l(l education ﬁelds. Franzen applied for Teach for
America and was rejected. Feeling rather down,
he stumbled on the Teach Kentucky program and
took another chance, applied, and was accepted.
When he went to Kentucky, it was not what he ex-
pected. Instead of a formal interview like he had
when applying for Teach for America, there was
a barbeque, beer, and a great discussion of teach-
ing philosophies between the other applicants and
teachers involved in the program.

Enthralled with this new environment, Franzen
packed his bags and moved to Kentucky. As he
had never been in charge of a class before, he spent
most of his ﬁrst day at Shelby West Middle School
talking about ice cream to get to know the kids.
While the ﬁrst few months were rough and his
teaching plans from his summer graduate courses
at University of Louisville had been thrown out,
F ranzen’s creativity and dynamic personality
helped him connect and build lasting relationships
with his students. His biggest piece of advice to
those going into one of these teaching programs is
to fund an opportunity to teach while still a student.

in order to build up teaching experience.

Even though the challenges of teaching were
difﬁcult, the diversity of the student body, both
ethnically and socioeconomieally, proved to be the
largest obstacle. Trying to challenge children at dif-
ferent academic levels in a class size of thirty kept
Franzen busy day and night, planning and updat-
ing his curriculum and lesson plans. Throughout
these ordeals. the teachers in the Teach Kentucky
program were there to support him.

Franzen described the Teach
Kentucky program as an oppor-
tunity to be placed in an area
where he was needed and chal-
lenged. It has placed him on

a fast track to leadership posi-

tions within his new school... ”

Franzen described the Teach Kentucky program
as an opportunity to be placed in an area where he
was needed and challenged. It has placed him on
a fast track to leadership positions within his new
school, and provided him with a network of teach-
ers and contacts in the Louisville area. At the end
of next year, he will receive a teaching certiﬁcation
and a masters in teaching. The Teach Kentucky
program needs teachers in all subjects. If you are

Are you a creative or dynamic person? Do you
like helping kids? Are you interested in pursuing a
career in teaching or education? If you answered
yes to any of these questions, then you should learn
about the organization Teach for America.

Teach for America is an organization that works
to eliminate educational inequality within schools.
Studies show that children who grow up in poor
socioeconomic households are nearly three grade
levels behind children who are raised in wealthier
socioeconomic households.

According to Joanna Perini, a graduate of W&L
and of the Teach for America program, “The goal
is to get highly motivated young teachers into
classrooms where [they] are desperately needed
with the hope that these teachers, alter their two
years, will either stay in the classroom or will go
on to another career where they can impact the
American educational system.”

Joanna taught at a school in New Mexico for
two years and is currently attending law school
at Northwestern University. Last summer she
worked on special education legal issues with a le-
gal non-proﬁt organization in Chicago. While she
taught in New Mexico, she had to take nine credits
per year towards a masters in special education so
that she could maintain her teaching license. Other
states have different requirements while students
are in the program, but in most cases, the partici-
pants must be working on a masters in education,
teaching, etc., as well as working towards their
teaching certiﬁcation.

If you are accepted into the program, you are
expected to commit two years after graduation
from college to the program. For a short period of
time immediately following graduation, you go to
the site where you will be teaching in order to get
settled in. Then, you go to the Teach for America
institution to receive ﬁve weeks of training, and
then back to the site to begin teaching. For this
ﬁrst summer, you may get one to two weeks off,

but in most cases, the ﬁrst summer is committed-to
the program as well. Aﬂer that, you are on a nor-
mal teacher’s schedule, and after the second year
of teaching, it is your decision to either leave your
placement or to stay.

Another W&L graduate, Nazo Burgy, is in
his second year of teaching second grade in Mi-
ami (Little Haiti). He describes it as “a constant
time commitment. There isn’t a minute in my day
when I’m not thinking about my students, what
I’m doing the next day, or how to better serve
them...you’re leaving a civic-minded lifestyle at
all times.” Nazo is planning on getting his mas-
ters in educational leadership and then opening
up his own charter school. Ansel Sanders, yet an-
other W&L graduate who went into the Teach for
America program, is currently a vice principal in a
public middle school in Greenville, SC. He taught
in Baltimore, MD for three years while attending
Johns Hopkins and working towards his certiﬁca-
tion. When asked about his plans for the future,
Ansel replied, “I will be in education as a career.
My experience with Teach for America galvanized
this desire. I would like to continue on the path to
school leadership and be a principal.”

Teach for America provides an opportunity for
students interested in education to gain experience
in urban and rural public schools, while helping
close the achievement gap between children grow-
ing up in various socio-economic situations. An-
sel described the desired applicant as “the type of
student who is passionate and committed to en-
deavors and goals; someone who is dynamic and
strong-willed; someone who will be able to keep
a perspective when times get rough during their
experience and commit themselves 110% while in
the program. Lots of folks at W&L ﬁt this descrip-
tion and I hope many, many students apply.”

If you are interested in this program, Steve De-
Man is in charge of recruiting at W&L. His email
is: stephen.deman@teachforamerica.org. More
information and the application can be found at
www.teachforamerica.org.

Jackson victory over D-I VMI

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

Last Friday, October 19, the
.men’s lacrosse team took on Vir-
ginia Military Institute in the 21st
annual Lee-Jackson Classic and
came home with a 17-14 victory

This tradition started in 1988
and is one of the longest running
annual events in college lacrosse
today. It is also one of the few Di-
vision 1 versus Division 111 games.
Despite the difference in divisions,
the game is always competitive
and intense. The Generals had won
two straight against the Keydet’s
coming into Friday’s game. Due
to scheduling issues, this year’s

.match-up marks the ﬁrst time this
event has been played during the
fall off-season. The game is usu-
ally played in April during the reg-
ular season. The players say this
gives this Crosstown rivalry extra
emphasis. It also allows the Gen-
erals to give themselves a real test
in the fall.

The 17 goals by the Generals in
the high-scoring affair topped last
year’s high mark of 14 against Ro-
anoke. It is the most goals scored
in a game by the Generals since

.they put up 17 against York two
years ago.

Early in the game, VMI scored
ﬁrst and at one point led 3-1, but
W&L recovered and led by a score
of 5-3 at the end of the ﬁrst quar-
ter. The second quarter was played
evenly, leaving the halftime score
7-5.

The Generals came out ﬁred
up in the third quarter and domi-
nated. They outscored the Key-

 

dets 7-3 with contributions from ‘

6 different players including one
by senior Will Englehart with one
second left to cap off the quarter.
From the end of the third quarter
to the beginning of the fourth, the
Generals went on their third scor-
ing streak of 4 or more. VMI came
back strongly in the last quarter
when the Generals took out some
of their starters, but in the end
W&L stayed in control and came
out on top.

The Generals got contribu-
tions from all around in their third
straight victory over VMI. The
strong offensive performance was
led by senior captain Ned Rider
with 3 goals and 4 assists. He won
the Fallon award for most valuable
player on W&L in the Lee-Jack-
son Classic. The award has been
awarded annually since 1996 and
is named after former Washington
and Lee football coach and la-
crosse ofﬁcial Gary Fallon.

Englehart (4 goals), sophomore
Will Keigler (2 goals, 4 assists),
and sophomore Deets Hoffman (2
goals and an assist) provided other
strong performances. Junior Sel-
don Clarke won 22 of 26 face-offs
including 9 of 10 in the Generals’
dominant third quarter. The de-
fense was lead by senior captain
Spotty Robins.

With this win, the Generals
are looking forward to the sea-
son. The team is mature with six
seniors. The ten different players
that scored show the squad has
depth. About the game, Coach
Eugene McGabe said, “I am very
pleased. We had 17 goals with

contributions from a lot of players.

We had good execution and a solid
effort. I am excited about the rest
of the season.” The players also
said they are excited and happy
with their fall ball performance. ‘

The team resumes play this
winter.

Wimmers split at Mary Wash.

Men win 12 of I 4 events and cruise to a dominating victory in their season opener

By Mlchael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

As the temperatures outside
begin to drop, the swimming pool
starts to steam. Both the men’s
and women’s teams opened their
seasons on Saturday at Mary
Washington. The men won in con-
vincing fashion, 169-93, while the
women lost by the same score.

The men’s team was led by se-
nior Will Hartmann’s victories in
the 100 back, the 200 back, and
the 200 individual medley. Senior
Alex Sweet contributed victories
in the 100 free and 200 free and
was a part of the victorious 200
free relay along with senior Tim
McGlaston, junior Paul Crook,
and sophomore Brandon Bamds.

Crook tallied two individual
wins in the 100 breast and 500
free while McGlaston also won
the 50 free in a time of 20.82, good
enough for an NCAA provisional
cut. Sophomore Ian Childers pro-
vided one of the best individual
swims, winning the 200 breast in
2:18.32.

Overall, the Generals won l2
of the 14 events contested.

“To let our opponents know
that we intend to pillage our op-
ponents, not just win,” said Me-
Glaston when asked about the
signiﬁcance of the win. “We want
to demonstrate that we’re a na-
tionally competitive team.”

On the women’s side, the
Generals were led by freshman

Tess Hayden who touched ﬁrst in
both the 500 free and 1000 free.
Hayden’s swims provided a spark
for the whole team. Juniors Lind-
sey Strachan and Julianne Miata
also chipping in with wins in the
100 back and 100 ﬂy, respective-
ly. Freshman Jackie Smith also
contributed a second place in the
200 free.

“The best performances of the
meet were from Tess Hayden,”
said Miata. “As freshmen, the
team isn’t really sure what to
expect of them. We don’t know

we swam in our ﬁrst meet,” said

Hayden. “From my experience,‘

I’ve found that it’s difﬁcult to
swim really well at the beginning
of the season. But everyone on
the team went out and raced and
came away with some really fast
times.”

The freshmen weren’t the only
ones experiencing their ﬁrst meet
at W&L. New women’s head
coach Kami Gardner, who came
to W&L this season after 13 years
as the head coach at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Oswego.

“T 0 let our opponents know that we intend

to pillage our opponents, not just win. We

want to demonstrate that we ’re a nationally

competitive team. ”

TIM MCGLASTON, Class of 2008

how they get pumped up for races
or how the pressure can inﬂuence
their performance.

“Tess won both of her races,
smoked the competition, and
never looked back. It was neat to
watch because you could tell that
she focused on her race, and hers
only. The intimidation from the
other team didn’t matter, and it’s
great to have someone like that as
a part of the team--it just rubs off
on everyone.”

“I was amazed at how well

“It was great to experience our
ﬁrst meet with our new coach,”
said Miata. “She really paid at-
tention to everyone’s race, of-
fered support, and gave great ad-
vice for improvement. She puts
everything in a practical perspec-
tive, and assures us that perform-
ing well does not mean winning.
There are many more details that
make a huge difference in your
race, and it’s important to be re-
minded of those sometimes.”

For the men, the ﬁrst meet was

as much about competing with
the clock as their opponents.

“This meet was a self-test for
us; it was really our ﬁrst chance to
go out and see if we could swim
fast despite training hard right
through, and it was our ﬁrst gauge
of where we are at as a team,” said
sophomore Josh Gonzalez.

The ﬁrst meet provided a test
of how the holes left by the gradu-
ation of last years seniors, includ-
ing several All-Americans, would
be ﬁlled.

“Kevin Hayes left an extreme-
ly large gap in our depth chart,”
said McGlaston. “Fortunately, we
have lots of smaller but faster un-
derclassmen to ﬁll that gap. Mike
Ginder left a tall and skinny gap
that Alex Sweet is likely to fill.”

“Will Hartmann won both the
backstroke events and the 200
IM, which were normally held
down by two different seniors
last year, and Brandon Bamds,
who did a nice job on some relay
spots that were held by last year’s
group and in the 200 freestyle,”
said Childers.

If the Generals are going to
accomplish an undefeated regular
season, they will need people to
continually step up for the team.
The men’s schedule this year in-
cludes a number of quality op-
ponents including Carnegie Mel-
lon, Franklin and Marshall, Johns
Hopkins, and Blue Grass Moun-
tain Conference rival Wingate.

“Our biggest rival in BGMC

will probably be Wingate again.
As a D—lI school they are able
to buy some pretty good foreign
talent with their scholarships,
they’ve got a good young coach
and they gave us a run for our
money last year,” said Gonzalez.

The teams’ goals aren’t limited
to the pool though.

“Our academics are also really
important to us. The men’s team
posted the second highest GPA in
the country winter term and com-
bined with the girls team we post-

ed the highest GPA in the country
of any combined team in D-I, D-
II, D-III or any of the independent
divisions, so we obviously want
to continue with our success in
the classroom,” said Gonzalez.

The Generals return to action
next Saturday in the home opener
against Transylvania at 12:00
p.m.

Cycling team is fast out of the gate  

Team is only I 0 months old but has already earned its ﬁrst win

By Michael Keenan

When most students think of Traveller at W&L,
they’re looking for a ride home. Since arriving on
campus last year, sophomore Elliot O’Brien has been
racing to change that.

On October 14, O’Brien entered the team’s ﬁrst cy-
clocross competition in Charlottesville, Va. and took
first place in his category.

“My expectations of what a cyclo-cross race would
look like were very hazy: something about parks, bar-
riers and running with the bike,” said O’Brien.

After warming up for a few laps an the course, he
was still uncertain about how he would do.

“I felt a little nervy at the start,” said O’Brien. “My

two warm—up laps were a combination of awkward,

dismounts, poor gear choices and many a dropped
chain.”

O’Brien went out conservatively hanging out in
the middle of the pack for the ﬁrst of ﬁve laps but be-
gan to move up quickly and by lap three had the leader
in his sights. His cross-country running training paid
off for him during the mandatory dismount sections,
where the rided must jump of the bike and run.

“From there on out it was just a matter of not
crashing or dropping out due to mechanical issues,”
he said.

However, on lap four he ﬂipped over his handle-
bars into some sand, but gamely “shook the sand off,
jumped back on. and kept riding.” With about a third
of a mile to go, he survived a scare when his chain
came off, but with a ﬂick of front derailleur, the chain
was back on and O’Brien was on his way to victory.

“All in all a great experience,” said O’Brien.
“Technical but fun, lots of gravelly climbs with a bal-
ance of ﬁnesse and brute strength required to make it
through.”

In January, 2007, O’Brien, with the help of alum-
nus David Cobb, reinvigorated the dormant W&L cy-
cling club as Team Traveller. Upon its founding, only
one rider in the club was licensed with USA Cycling.
Today, the team has grown to include 20 current W&L
students as well as a number of alumni and commu-
nity members.

Last spring, the team was registered and O’Brien
and Cobb purchased their individual racing licenses
from USA Cycling. After a number of strong ﬁnishes,
including victories in Greenville, N.C.; in Rock Hill,
S.C.; and the Tour of Virginia Criterium in Harrison-
burg, Va., O’Brien earned a promotion to Category
Four last May.

The promotion didn’t slow him down as he took
third in his Category Four debut and later placed sec-
ond in the South Mountain Mass Start Hill Climb in
Pennsylvania.

In addition to racing, the team has also undertak-
en several charity events. Last February, team Vice-
President Matt Langan organized a 385 mile trip from
Richmond, Va., to Norristown, Pa., in order to raise
money for the National Parkinson’s Foundation. Lan-
gan was joined by Cobb, O’Brien and senior Wood-
row Friend.

They stayed in homes of students and alurrmi along
the way. Because of the success of the ride, the team is
planning charity events for the future, but are “intent

New Zealand native Elliott O’Brien (above) partnered with alumnus David Cobb
to restart W&L’s cycling team. Since January the team has grown from one rider

that future routes will go south rather than north.”

The Washington and Lee Riding team
has no home shows. They don’t even
practice in Lexington.

But each fall and winter the program
matches up with — and often beats — re-
gional riding powerhouses like Hollins
University, Bridgewater College and
Sweet Briar College.

Last weekend the Mounted Generals
took second place at Hollins, defeating
the hosts and ﬁnishing just two points be-
hind the University of Virginia.

Hollins has more than 80 riders in its
programs. The Generals have about 20.

“We practice less than all the other
teams,” Coach Gordon Reistrup said.
“The girls just have to be ready to step
up.”

That can make life a bit hectic. Reis-
trup said it helps that he coaches a team of
extremely smart riders.

In this fall’s seven-week season, Reis-
trup has had to hold tryouts, train his team
and guide them through four shows. The
fall season concludes Nov. 3 with a show
at Bridgewater College. The team will
compete seven‘more times in the winter
and spring.

Reistrup, a 1988 UVa graduate, com-
peted in Intercollegiate Nationals each of
his four years at UVa. He has continued
to show competitively while coaching at
W&L and training private clients.

Each showlhe competes against his
former coach, UVa’s Claiborne Bishop.
He enjoys matching up against Bishop
and other friends in the coaching busi-
ness.

“When the program came to [Reis-
trup’s barn in Collierstown], we had to
start from ground zero,” he said. “I called
in favors from friends all over. Claiborne
was one of the ﬁrst people I called.”

Reistrup’s wife, Amy, was the team’s
coach during the 2005-2006 season, tak-
ing the team to its ﬁrst ever Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference title. Gordon
Reistrup took over the program after his
wife died of cancer during the summer of
2006.

He took over a team in transition. Cait-
lin Lane, a four time national qualiﬁer in
the top division, had just graduated. Cap-
tain Katie Goodrich, another all-ODAC
rider, also graduated. The team also grad-
uated three strong mid-level riders.

Intercollegiate horse shows consist of
competitions of eight classes: ﬁve “ﬂat”
classes and three jumping classes. First
place in a class earns the team seven
points, with lower ﬁnishes earning few-
er points. Riders are placed into a class
based on their prior riding and showing
experience.

That means the team has riders who
have been competing for 10 years and
others who got on a horse for the ﬁrst time
last month. But a team needs depth across
the divisions if it hopes to do well. I

“That was ‘my biggest adjustment last

to 20, with numberous alumni and community riders joining the team for some
competitions. O’Brien is a sophomore.

year, having to teach complete begin-
ners,” Reistrup said. “You have to adjust
your thought process; you can’t get too
technical.”

Junior Hila Yashar joined the team her
freshman year.

“I had never been on horses before I
came to W&L,” Yashar said.

Last week at Hollins, Yashar won the
walk-trot division, beating all other be-
ginning riders. *

“In my division they look at how well
you control the horse, how your body sits
on the horse and your steering ability,”
Yashar said.

On the other hand, freshman Caitlin
McCurdy had been riding for 10 years
but had never appeared in a show. Last
week she won the walk-trot-canter divi-
sion, which is the division directly above
walk-trot.

Though W&L’s team can’t boast as
many riders as some of the other pro-
grams, team captain Sarah Bujtas says
there are advantages to being a small
team.

“We’re much tighter than the other
teams,” Bujtas, a junior, said. “We have a
lot of fun at shows.”

Even though only part of the team
shows each meet, Yashar said the riders
aren’t competitive with their teammates.

“The spirit of the team is my favorite
part [or riding]” Yashar said. “People are
very supportive when you ride.”

Hockey’s hea rtbrea ker

Team falls to Lynchburg in season ﬁnale, takes 3 seeed in ODAC tournament

By Mlchael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

On Tuesday evening the Washington and
Lee ﬁeld hockey team took the ﬁeld for the
last time during the regular season against
rival Lynchburg, losing a heartbreaker 3-2 in
overtime.

The Generals did not come out playing
with the intensity one would expect of a rival-
ry game. Lynchburg dominated the first twen-
ty-ﬁve minutes but was only able to capitalize
once when Jessie Bowman scored 13 minutes
into the game.

The Generals ﬁnally showed some signs of
life in the last ten minutes of the half. Within a
span of ﬁve minutes, the team won three pen-

alty corners. With ﬁve minutes to play in the
half, they converted as senior Kendall Korte
squeezed a shot between the keeper and the
near post to tie the game at one.

“After Lynchburg scored initially, we knew
we had to answer back quickly and show them
that we were still in the game,” said junior
Christina Merchant. “After we scored the ﬁrst
time, it boosted everyone’s conﬁdence, and we
began to play even better.”

Less than a minute later, Lynchburg put the
ball in the back of the net, but it was called
back for an offside infraction, leaving the
score tied at one going into halftime.

In the second half, the Generals came out
ﬂat again allowing Lynchburg to control play
for the ﬁrst ﬁfteen minutes. It took multiple

Since October 16th, the Washington and
Lee men’s soccer team has wrapped up its
ODAC regular season with a 1-0 victory over
Emory & Henry, a" 1-0 overtime loss against
Virginia Wesleyan, and a 1-1 draw with
Hampden-Sydney.

Against Emory & Henry, senior Jack
Palmer scored that game’s lone goal in the
36th minute. The Generals controlled the
game throughout making the ﬁnal 1-0 score
deceptive.

“We out shot them 35-5 and had 18 comer
kicks,” said senior Josh Dodds. “It wasn’t
very close.”

After defeating Emory & Henry last week,
the Generals improved to 10-1-2 overall and
6-0-1 in conference, they held pole posi-
tion and were looking to secure home ﬁeld
advantage for the tournament. However, the
ﬁnal two games would be the toughest of the
ODAC season, and the team was only able to
salvage one point, dropping them to the third
seed.

On Saturday, the Generals traveled to
Norfolk, Va., to take on Virginia Wesleyan. It
took more than the 90 regulation minutes to

saves by Rubenstein to keep the score tied at
one.

With less than 23 minutes to play, W&L
was awarded a penalty comer and freshman
Kelly Tran redirected a ‘shot from sophomore
Sallie Armstrong to give the Generals a 2-1
lead. The lead didn’t last for long. Less than a
minute later Lynchburg answered with a goal
of their own to tie the game at two.

In overtime, the Generals looked like a dif-
ferent team.

“We really become a different team in over-
time,” said Merchant. “The 7-a-side formation
allows us to stay spread out, and really use the
turf to our advantage.”

However, the Generals were unable to turn
their advantage into a game-winning goal. Six

minutes into the overtime period, until they
surrended a penalty comer and Lynchburg
converted for the 3-2 win. The loss dropped
the Generals to 10-6, 5-2 in ODAC play,
which is good enough for the third seed in the
playoffs.

The Hornets held a 12-7 advantage in shots
and a 15-7 advantage in penalty comers. If not
for the Generals’ defense and goalkeeping of
senior goalkeeper Tara Rubenstein, the game
could have been a blowout.

The past week was not without its upside
though. On Saturday, the team traveled to play
Virginia Wesleyan and emerged with a 3-2
overtime victory.

score.
The loss dropped

the Generals to 6-1-

1 in the ODACs and

a ﬁrst place tie with

Hampden-Sydney.
When Hampden-

Sydney arrived at
Watt Field on Tuesday afternoon, it brought
with it a contrasting formation that neces-
sitated the Generals make some adjustment.
While W&L usually lines up in a 4-3-2-1,
Hampden-Sydney plays a 4-3-3.

“They play with 3 forwards so their game
plan is to hit it long and have someone track
it down,” said senior Josh Dodds. “From our
end they crammed the center midﬁeld with 3
guys and were pushing up defenders on our
outside mids, so we took what they gave us
which was the long ball to the comer.”

The game got off to an ominous start in
the ﬁrst minute when a Hampden-Sydney
forward broke through and dribbled senior
goalkeeper Ted Sheedy but was denied by
sophomore J.P. Pratt, who cleared the ball off
the goal line.

From the outset, neither team was able to
possess the ball to build up an attack. Serious
scoring opportunities were limited for both
teams. With ﬁfteen minutes to play in the
half, junior Tommy Pignatelli dribbled down
the right side and ﬁred a low shot passed the
outstretched arms of the Hampden-Sydney
keeper, off the far post to give the Generals a
1-0 lead. The Generals had a few more chanc-
es in the half but were unable to convert, leav-
ing the lead at one.

found the back of the net off a pass from Alex
Caritis with only three minutes to play in the
ﬁrst half. However, the Marlins came back in
the second half, tying the game in the ﬁrst ten
minutes when Katie Melzac scored. Melzac
struck again 17 minutes later to give the Mar-
lins a 2-1 advantage.

The Generals refused to quit. Just three
minutes after Virginia Wesleyan took the lead,
Korte responded with an unassisted goal to tie
the game at two.

“If we hadn’t come back from being down
2-1, I don’t know what would have happened.
It would have thrown off so many things
— seeding, home ﬁeld for Parents Weekend,
etc.,” said Garson.

With neither team able to ﬁnd the net again
in regulation, the game went to overtime. With
less than three minutes to play in the ﬁrst half
of overtime, Merchant ended the game by
scoring with an assist from sophomore Steph-
anie Mansey.

“Until Saturday we had never beaten Va
Wes at their ﬁeld,” said Garson. “I think it was
a mental thing we had to get over - knowing
we could beat them on their ﬁeld.”

On Sunday, the Generals traveled to Cap-
tains Field to take on fourth ranked Christo-
pher Newport. The Captains started out fast,
scoring twice within the ﬁrst six minutes. Then
the Generals settled down and only allowed
one goal the remainder of the game, losing by
a ﬁnal score of 3-0.

“If you take away the ﬁrst ﬁve or ten min-
utes from the game I think we played very well
against CNU,” said Garson. “We didn’t come
out ready to play the ﬁrst part of the game and
that showed when they scored two quick goals
on us.”

The Generals will resume play this week-
end at home in the ﬁrst round of the ODAC
playoffs, against Bridgewater, a team they

defeated during the regular season.

“I think we can deﬁnitely beat Bridge-
water if we stay focused on the game,” said
Merchant. “It is easy to look past Bridgewater
since we already beat them in the regular sea-
son. However, it is important to keep in mind
that anything can happen during the touma-
ment, and we need to make sure we bring our
A game.”

If the Generals win, they will take on the
winner of the Lynchburg/Virginia Wesleyan
game. If the Hornets wins, the Generals will
travel to Lynchburg for a rematch.

“Facing Lynchburg again will deﬁnitely
be a huge challenge,” said Merchant. “After
tonight’s game, our team is anxious to see
Lynchburg again, and prove to them that we
can win.”

Generals host Lynchburg Saturday in quarterﬁnals

Ten minutes into the second half, Hamp-
den-Sydney tied the score when Will Rob-
ertson headed home a cross at the back post.
After the goal, Hampden—Sydney’s opportu-
nities were few and far between.

The Generals, however, had a number of
chances to put the game away both in regula-
tion and overtime. Junior Whit Larkin broke
free a number of times and Dodds threatened
with a few times but each time Hampden-
Sydney’s goalie John Robert Plyler was up to
the challenge. Plyler ﬁnished the game with
nine saves.

With neither team able to score again in
the two overtime periods, the game ended in
a 1-1 tie. With Virginia Wesleyan’s 2-0 vic-
tory over Randolph-Macon that same day,
the Marlins stole the top seed for the ODAC
playoffs. Because of predetermined lots,
Hampden-Sydney held the tiebreaker over
the Generals and received the second seed
leaving the Generals in third.

Injuries will be a major obstacle for the
Generals to overcome during the ODAC
playoffs. The season has taken its toll and
some members aren’t able to play at the same
level while the reserves are stretched limiting
the number of fresh substitutions.

“We are incurring more and more inju-
ries,” said Pignatelli. “Three of our four out-
side midﬁelders are injured.”

The Generals will start their run in the
ODAC playoffs at home this Saturday against
Lynchburg.

While Coach Rolf Piranian left open the
possibility of an at-large bid to the NCAA
playoffs, he hinted that it would most likely
take an ODAC championship for the Gener-
als to continue their season.

“Nothing from the regular season mat-
ters anymore,” said Dodds when asked how
the team will recover from two tough games.
“The seeds have been determined and it’s just
a matter of winning the next game or having
our season ended. ‘

Sports and family

My father ivﬁrst trip to Camden Yards

By Amor Nelll Thuparl
COLU M msr

As Parents’ Weekend approaches here at W&L, I thought
it’d be ﬁtting to take the time to reﬂect on the role that sports
can play in a family. For some people, the realm of sports is
nothing more than a short break from reality. Simply there
for entertainment purposes, these people view all forms of
sport as a brief distraction from their everyday lives, and I
understand their sentiments. However, since the ﬁrst time I
experienced the daily excitement and emotion of following
the Orioles in a heated pennant race, or the ﬁrst time I wit-
nessed the sheer, unadulterated drama that unfolds with the
NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, I knew that sports was
something that meant much more. Unfortunately, my mother
and father never really shared the same feelings that I had, nor
did we spend time together embracing sports. Of course, this
changed on one unforgettable night last year.

It was a fairly cool Monday night on September 11, 2006,
when the New York Yankees played the Baltimore Orioles in
the ﬁnal game between the two teams at Camden Yards that
season. My beloved Orioles came in close to 20 games under
.500 with no shot at the postseason whatsoever while the Yan-
kees entered amidst a tight race atop the division standings,
vying for a 9th consecutive AL East title. Nonetheless, this
seemingly insigniﬁcant contest would wind up being one of
the most memorable and meaningful in my life, not because
of what transpired on the ﬁeld, but because of whom I was
with that evening. I say this because on that night for the ﬁrst
time in my life, I attended an Orioles baseball game with both
my mother and father. Now, since I was a child, I have been to
countless baseball games with friends, other family members,
and even with just my mom, but on that night my dad, for the
ﬁrst time in the 24 years that he has been in this country, went
to a baseball game. Sure, he had seen baseball numerous times
before on television, but never did he actually come to Cam-
den Yards, or any stadium for that matter, and take in all the
sights, sounds and smells that come with time spent at the ball
park. As one might imagine, everything that my family and I
experienced that day just seemed better than any of my previ-
ous trips to Oriole Park. From the smell of the grass, to the
peanuts and Dippin’ Dots, it was, without a doubt, my most
enjoyable time at an Orioles game since the mid-1990s when
we were contenders. Being able to share everything that I love
about the game of baseball and the Baltimore Orioles with
my mom and dad was something that I had never experienced
before, and looking back, I am truly glad that I was able to
cherish every moment of it.

For sports fans and enthusiasts across the nation, there is
an understanding of the possibility of sports transcending the
principles of competition and the subsequent accolades into
something much more meaningful. When it’s not about wins
and losses, but recognition of the extraordinary taking place
and being able to enjoy it with the people with whom you’re
sharing the moment. Moments like these happened in game 5
of last season’s Eastem Conference Finals of the NBA Play-
offs when LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers scored 48
points, including the Cavaliers’ ﬁnal 25, en route to a double
overtime victory over the highly favored Detroit Pistons. I
will never forget sitting along side my dad at home, leaning
forward eagerly anticipating what would happen next. If you
were watching the game last June, you knew that you were
watching something truly special, and there was no way you
could tear yourself away from the television.

As for the game itself, that night played out the way most
Oriole games of recent memory have. The Birds jumped out
to a 5-2 lead on the feared Yankee ace, Randy Johnson, only
to have the bullpen give up 6 runs in the 7"‘ inning. The icing
on the cake was Alex Rodriguez’s solo homerun in the 9”‘ in-
ning to put the game away as the Yankees went on to win by
a score of 9-6.

Nevertheless, for me that game in Baltimore was one of
these instances where watching the sport and realizing whom
I was with transcended any other game that I had previously
attended. Regardless of the outcome of the contest, I knew
that being with my family, being together and enjoying the at-
mosphere and experience meant far more than what the score-
board read. So as we look towards spending time with our
parents here in Lexington this weekend, I hope some of you
can look back and identify some of the moments that you’ve
spent with your parents celebrating sports, whether it be base-
ball, college football, professional basketball, or anything of
the like.’You just may be surprised at some of the memories
you have shared.

Anne Van Devender tries to dribble out of trouble. She finished with 10 goals this season.

Next up: Eastern Mennonite, whom they beat 3-] this week

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee women’s soccer
team went 3-1 during its ﬁnal four games, end-
ing the year winning nine of 10.

The Generals traveled to play Rhodes Col-
lege last Sunday, Oct. 14, at'a neutral site in
North Carolina. The team came out fast as
they have done all season and scored a goal
in the first 15 minutes. Senior Captain Haley
Bunting converted a goal off a pass from an-
other captain, Anne Van Devender. This tan-
dem has hooked up many times throughout
their Careers. 5

Rhodes’ Diana Buss responded just 15
‘minutes later (30:50) with a goal that knotted

the score at 1-1. The score remained the same

§as‘tlié'te'anis‘wént iiitb halftiin’e"."  ' ' .

I "W&L cpenedup the second half the same
-way it did in the ﬁrst by scoring eight minutes
into period. This time, Van Devender scored
a goal on her own to give the Generals a 2-1
advantage. This goal turned out to be the game
winner as W&L rolled past the Lynx and ex-
tended its winning streak to eight games.

This game marked the ﬁrst time since the
loss to Virginia Wesleyan on Sept. 22 in which
they team allowed a goal.

“Our success since the Virginia Wesleyan
game is due to our team’s determination to win
and to be the best team on the ﬁeld at any giv-
en time,” said goalie junior Kiki Moreo who
had eight saves in the winning effort. “We are
determined and driven to succeed, and that
is why we have managed to only let in one
goal.”

This game also marked Coach Neil Cun-
ningham’s 100th win as W&L’s women’s soc-
cer coach.

“It was nice to be recognized for the 100th
‘win, but to be honest, it was not something I
was aware of until people brought it up,” said
Cunningham. “I think more impressive than
the 100 wins is the fact that we have only lost
'18 games in that time frame.”

The Generals then faced rival Lynchburg at
home on Watt Field in a pivotal ODAC confer-
ence game on Oct. 17. Both teams were 7-1 in
conference heading into the important match.

The game started out fast-paced with both

teams racing down to their opponents’ ends
of the ﬁeld, but neither team could capitalize
on the shot opportunities. The action bounced
back and forth without either team being able
to score through the ﬁrst 45 minutes of play.
In the ﬁrst half, both coaches made numerous
substitutions in order to ﬁnd the right combi-
nation of players to break the deadlock, but
they came up empty.

W&L caught the ﬁrst break of the game
when Van Devender’s cross into the box de-
ﬂected off of a Lynchburg defender and went
into the goal in the 54th minute. This seren-
dipitous play ended the scoring drought.

Van Devender capped off the afternoon by
sending home a shot that she received after it
caromed off the pipe in the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes.

-A “Lynchburg is always» a-big game,” said V

Moreo after the game. “We get ﬁred up to play
them, and they get ﬁred up to play us. For us,
losing was not an option. We know what our
post-season‘ aspirations are and to achieve
those we needed to beat Lynchburg.”

The Generals traveled to play Roanoke in
their second to last game of the year. Both
teams had identical 8-1 records in conference
heading into the match and were playing for a
two seed in the upcoming conference touma-
ment. W&L had not lost to the Maroons since
2001.

The intensity exerted on the ﬁeld matched
the importance of the game. Just eight minutes
into the game, Roanoke received a penalty
kick and took advantage of the opportunity
,making the score 1-0.

Both teams battled hard throughout the
game, amassing 33 total shots in the effort.
Roanoke held onto the lead until the Generals
ﬁnally capitalized in the last 10 minutes of the
game. Katie Corr scored an unassisted goal at
82:17 to send the game to overtime.

“When there was less than 10 minutes left,
we were getting pretty desperate, and even
though we weren’t haven’t a particularly good
game, it seemed as if we could still make it out
ofthe game with a tie or a win,” said Corr, “so
[I was] pretty ecstatic since we really needed
the win.”

The teams received few scoring chances in
the ﬁrst overtime, resulting in a second over-

time.

It appeared as though the game would end
in a tie when, with under three minutes to play,
Meredith Grunewald of Roanoke took a shot
that hit the crossbar and rolled into the back
of the net. This ended the game, 2-1, with a
Maroon victory.

“We did not play our game on Saturday,”
said Corr after the game. “When we do play
our game, we can beat just about anyone.
So although this makes our road more dif-
ﬁcult, our team still has the ability to go to
[the NCAA Tournament] and to do very well.
We have been playing very well the past few
games, and we just need to learn from Satur-
day that the past few games don’t matter.”

The Generals ended the regular season on
a high note by defeating Eastern Mennonite
3-1.

In typical W&L fashion, the team scored
just seven minutes into the game. Van Dev-
ender fed Katie Kern for the ﬁrst goal at 7:01.
Then, one minute before halftime, Shana Olt-
mans was the recipient of another Van Dev-
ender pass that resulted in a goal. Fifteen min-
utes into the second half, Van Devender put a
goal in on her own, advancing the score to 3-0,
and the team did not look back.

The defense was equally impressive in the
outing, allowing one goal in the waning mo-
ments of the game. Also, the defense only sur-
rendered ﬁve shots in total and only two on
target.

The team ﬁnished the regular season with
an overall record of 15-3 and 9-2 record in
conference.

The Generals are the three seed in the up-
coming ODAC Women’s Soccer Tournament
and will face the six seed, Eastern Mennonite,
on Saturday at home on Watt Field.

Earlier in the week, Cunningham reiterated
that the team’s goal is still to win the ODAC
championship.

“As we enter the remainder of our sched-
ule, we just need to maintain our focus and
commitment to each other and work to that
common goal: winning an ODAC title,” said
Cunningham.

volleyball world, we are like the Yan-
kees, Duke basketball, or Notre Dame
football - albeit on a much smaller
stage.”

In addition to extending W&L’s
streak of consecutive ODAC titles to
seven, winning the ODAC tournament
would guarantee the Generals would
continue their season in the NCAA
playoffs. However, Snyder was opti-
mistic the Generals would still have
an outside shot should they lose in the
conference tournament.

“If we can beat Rhodes this week-
end and we make it to the ﬁnals of the
ODAC tournament, I would think we
would have about a 25 percent chance
of getting an at-large bid,” said Sny-
der. “If we fail to do both of those
things, then I would think are chances
are very remote. We are going to fo-
cus on winning the ODAC as our way

ally give everything we have towards
that goal.”

The Generals will conclude their
regular season this weekend at the
Maryville Tournament taking on
Rhodes, the University of Cumber-
lands and host Maryville. The ODAC
tournament commences Nov. 2 ‘and
will be hosted by Hollins.

well teams are able to perform against teams
that are not in their region,” explained Todd.
“We really seized this opportunity to race
against schools that we usually don’t get to
compete against, and everyone put in great
performances. We were all so excited because
proved ourselves against those out-of-region
teams, and we ended up 2nd out of 23 teams!
We were also extremely happy with our ﬁn-
ish because we were only 34 points behind St.
Thomas, a nationally-ranked team.”

“We wanted to be the dark horse that no

one saw coming,” said Taylor. “Practicing on _

the course the day before really helped with the
mental preparation because being able to visu-
alize all the twists and turns before-hand helps
you break down the race into manageable parts
and gives you an edge over the competition.”

The Generals will conclude their season
next Saturday at home for the ODAC Cham-
pionships. Home-ﬁeld advantage is especially
signiﬁcant considering W&L’s course is one of
the most difﬁcult in the country.

“Our course is the most difficult course in
Virginia, one of the top in the country, requir-
ing 9.23 percent more energy to run than the
same distance on a track,” explained men’s
coach John Tucker. “We’re going to use the
experience we have running our course and
we’re going to take advantage of knowing it’s
our course.”

“I think we are all super stoked to have
ODACS on our home course,” said Taylor.

“The home course advantage is going to be
great, especially with all the support of our fel-
low Generals. And whether or not we love or

I hate our course (I lean towards love), we know

it better than anyone else.”

“Running on our home course is a huge help
for us; it may be the deciding factor,” added
Brower.

The team’s preparations began long before
they reported for preseason camp in August.

“Preparing begins in the summer so the team
has been running since June, up to 75 miles a
week,” said Tucker. “At this point, the work is
done.” He added that this year’s team includes
“an impressive group of young men.”

“To get excited for ODACS, the team is doing
psych buddies during the two weeks leading up
to ODACS,” said Todd when asked about how
the women’s team is preparing. “Each member
of the team is responsible for getting another
member of the team psyched for ODACS.

“We each made knick-knacks, posters, and
little gifts for our psych buddy’s locker this
week, and I think that we might be making
tasty treats for our psych buddies in the next
few days. It is a great way to come together
as a team and to get everyone excited for
ODACS!”

This year, look to see Telfeyan, Todd, and
Taylor leading the women’s team, while Welsh,
Berry, and Brower lead the men’s team.

“The goal is to run your best and run at the
level you are capable of,” said Tucker.

Must win

I/Wth two conference losses on the
books, W&L needs to beat Bridgewater

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

A chance to win a conference title. A pair of conference losses
on the road. A must-win game on Parents’ Weekend.

Sound familiar?

For the second consecutive year, the Washington and Lee
football season is on the line in front of the Wilson Field crowd.
Sitting fourth in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference at 4-2
(2-2 in conference), a talented but inconsistent Generals squad
faces their perennial nemesis, the Bridgewater Eagles, in a 1:00
p.m. contest on Saturday. It will be the squad’s last home game
of 2007 and their best chance to prove that they belong at the top
of the ODAC standings.

Last year W&L defeated Emory & Henry 24-6 on Parents’
Weekend to claim their ﬁrst ODAC crown since 1985 and ap-
peared in their ﬁrst postseason since the 1951 Gator Bowl. This
year the championship picture is a good deal more murky. The
Randolph-Macon Yellow Jackets currently sit atop the table, un-
defeated in conference play. Behind them sit the Hampden-Syd-
ney Tigers at, 4-1 within the ODAC, followed by Bridgewater
(2-1) and W&L. For the Generals to emerge from the pack, they
will need to beat the Eagles on Saturday and follow it with a
win at E&H next weekend. That would place the Generals at 4-
2, meaning Randolph—Macon and Hampden-Sydney will have to
lose again in conference play for W&L to repeat.

All the permutations depend ﬁrst and foremost on a win on
Saturday. Bridgewater was picked ﬁrst in the preseason ODAC
poll (W&L was second) and led the conference for most of last
year before a pair of late losses consigned them to second place.
The Eagles are again led by tailback Phillip Carter and a stiﬂing,
aggressive pass defense that has registered eight interceptions
in the past two weeks. They have struggled offensively of late,
however, beating Emory & Henry last week only on a ﬁeld goal
in the ﬁnal seconds. »

The Generals, by contrast, won decisively last Saturday, be-
coming the ﬁrst ODAC team to effectively stop Guilford’s top-
ranked aerial attack. It was the Generals’ ﬁrst road win since the
ﬁfth week of last season. The defense, run off the ﬁeld in the
shootout loss at Hampden-Sydney two weeks ago, returned to its
usual form and held Josh Vogelbach and the Quakers to just 282
total yards (they had averaged over 500 yards per game on the
season). Luby recorded 13 solo tackles and was named ODAC

Bridgewater was picked ﬁrst in the pre-
season ODAC poll (W&L was second) and
led the conference for most of last year
before a pair of late losses consigned them
to second place. 1
The Eagles are again led by tailback Phil-
lip Carter and a stifling, aggressive pass
defense that has registered eight intercep-
tions in the past two weeks.

Defensive Player of the Week. Safety Chris Prugar preserved the
victory when he intercepted Vogelbach with less than two min-
utes remaining and the score at 17-13 in favor of the Blue and
White. On the ensuing possession, Stuart Sitterson ran for his
second touchdown of the night to seal the victory, 24-13. The de-
fensive performance that held Vogelbach to just 201 yards pass-

. ing and three interceptions was undoubtedly the Blue Menace’s

best since the opening weekend shutout of Franklin & Marshall.

The Generals offense clicked smoothly for the second consec-
utive week, led by Sitterson’s 147 all-purpose yards. Quarterback
R.J. Vamer again had a mixed performance, throwing for 257
yards but also throwing two interceptions for the third time this
season. Sitterson has taken on an increased role in the offense of
late, often at the expense of early-season standout Tom Pacicco.
Sitterson totaled a school-record 389 all-purpose yards, includ-
ing 189 on kick returns, in the loss at Hampden-Sydney. Varner
also set a school record in that game, throwing ﬁve touchdown
passes. But the combined efforts of the Generals’ offensive stal-
warts were not enough to overcome the Tigers’ top-ranked of-
fense, and the visitors lost 42-45. Luby, Bryant Fulk and the rest
of the defense proved totally unable to stop Hampden-Sydney’s
dynamic duo of quarterback Corey Sedlar (295 yards, 1 TD) and
running back Josh Simpson (259 all-purpose yards, 4 TDs), who
have Tiger fans thinking championship.

For most people, the conference title race has been pared
down to Randolph-Macon, Hampden-Sydney, and the winner
of Saturday’s Eagles-Generals contest. A loss would make it ab-
surdly difﬁcult for the Generals to win the conference, and ef-
fectively, their season is on the line. All the dominoes will have
to fall into place. Bridgewater depends on Carter and the running
game to control possession, gaining points while denying oppo-
nents the chance to score. Stopping the run will fall primarily to
DT Scott Russell, MLBS Ryan MacPhee and Kyle Harvey, and
SS Kyle Luby, the team’s leader in tackles. On the offensive side
of the ball, either Sitterson or Pacicco will need to turn in a domi-
nating performance to eat up the game clock and perhaps leave
Jack Martin, just 19 receptions shy of the school’s all-tiine mark,
in single coverage, where he has been enormously successful all
year

Finally, the Generals will need vocal support from the fans.
Parents’ Weekend last year was a vocal, standing-room only
crowd that celebrated with the squad as they won an ODAC
championship. The trophy will not be awarded on Saturday, but
if W&L wants any hope of defending their title, the road will
start there. I

Juniors Abbey Wilson and Laura Maurer block a Lynchburg attack during Wednesday night's action.

SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s vol-
leyball team wrapped up ODAC regular
season play with a 30-21, 30-32, 30-27,
30-22.

Even though the team’s playoff seed
was already secured regardless of the out-
come, the players stayed focused on the
game.

“Every game is a chance for us to im-
prove as a team, and Lynchburg is a good
team,” said senior Lauren Rudolph. Even
though we have the number two spot in the
ODAC secured, that of course is not our
ﬁnal goal of the season — we need to con-
tinue to get better every day, and the game
against Lynchburg is another opportunity
to do that.”

The team came out swinging, opening a
7-1 advantage in the first game. Down 24-
17, Lynchburg tried to make a run, scoring
two points off their serve, but back-to-back
kills by Rachel Phillips extended the lead
to 26-19. Leading 28-21, Rudolph served
up back to back aces to secure game one
for the Generals, 30-21.

In game two, the Generals jumped out
to an early 5-1 lead. After extending their
lead to 11-4, Lynchburg burned a time out
to try to stop the game from getting out of
reach. The Hornets regained their compo-
sure and came out with a 5-1 run of their
own to close to within three but the Gen-
erals remained unshaken an extended heir
lead to 17-10.

The Generals continued to roll until
Lynchburg used its second timeout, trail-
ing 22-14. Coming out of the timeout, the
Hornets reeled off ﬁve straight, forcing the
Generals to take a timeout of their own.
Lynehburg’s roll continued as Hornets won
ﬁve of the next seven to tie the game at 24-
24. Then the Generals opened up a three
point lead but could not ﬁnish as Lynch-
burg tied the game at 29-29. Lynchburg
ended the game four points later, 32-30.

In game three it was the Hornets who
jumped out to the early lead. However.
the Generals fought back to tie the game
at 11-11. The game remained close until
the Generals opened a 20-17 lead, forcing
Lynchburg to take a timeout. Out of the
timeout, Lynchburg took six of the next
eight to take a 23-22 lead. This time, the
Generals rose to the challenge, winning the
game 30-27.

In game four, the Generals opened with
a 6-0 run but could not sustain the advan-
tage, giving up the next five in a row. The
game was back and forth until the Gener-
als opened up a 19-15 advantage and never
looked back, winning the fourth game 30-
22.

The win was W&L’s 19th in a row and
improved W&L’s reocrd to 23-5, 9-1 in
conference.

encc,” said Hudock. “We have proven to
ourselves that we are a‘ great team, espe-
cially with coming out of our past couple
tournaments without a loss. We have more
conﬁdence in our abilities and our chem-
istry on the court is much more ﬂuid and
controlled than it was in the beginning of
the season.”

“Wc‘ve developed a lot of conﬁdence
and more of a “killer instinct” when play-
ing teams," said sophomore Megan Stein-
hardt. “We’ve been able to win a lot of
close matches which helps us remain calm-
er when a match gets tight again.”

“Once we started playing the way we
knew we could, our conﬁdence and ener-
gy improved tremendously," said Maurer.
“This really showed when we played CNU
for the second time. They beat us really
easily the ﬁrst time we played them, but we

“We ’ve developed a /at 0_f'c0nﬁclen(%e and more ofa ‘killer

instinct ’when playing teams. "

Sophomore Megan Steinhardt

 

The team has come a long way since
opening the season 4-5, including dropping
their ﬁrst ODAC regular season match.

“It took a few matches for the 6 play-

ers on the court to come together and play _

as a team,” said Rudolph. “With every new
year, there are different personnel on the
court than the year before, and it took__ us
awhile to get comfortable in that new sitti-
ation.”

Since then, the team has put together a
19 match winning streak, including eight
ODAC wins and a 3-2 victory over Chris-
topher Newport, in a tournament hosted by
CNU, who had swept the Generals in their
ﬁrst match of the season.

“Our biggest change since the ﬁrst time
we played CNU is conﬁdence and experi-

really came together in that second match
and all gave 100% because we knew we
had improved a lot and had a great chance
of beating them.” -
The team is seeded second going into
the ODAC playoffs, with their only loss
coming in the ﬁrst match of the season
against Bridgewater. Even though they are
seeded second, the team still has a target on
their backs and will have to stay focused
each match rather than looking ahead.
“Our biggest obstacle is probably the
fact that we have won the past 6 champion-
ships and 10 out ofthe past 12, so everyone
gives us their best match and wants to make
sure that we don’t win another one,” said
Coach B1'yan Snyder. “Within the ODAC

Runners seek fourth consecutive title

Teams hope to retain conference championship on home course

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

Over Reading Days, the men’s and women’s cross country teams
were on the road Saturday morning to ﬁnish the last of their regular
season meets. The men traveled to William and Mary to compete in
the Tribe Open, while the women were in Allentown, Pennsylvania,

for the Desales Invitational.

At the Tribe Open, the Generals top runners were junior Michael
Welsh who ﬁnished 31st in a time of 26:20, junior Vance Berry who
ran in a time of 26:30 to take 35th, and senior Tom Brower who cap-
tured 38th after completing the course in 26:33.

“We ran pretty well,” Brower commented. “Although there is no
ofﬁcial team scoring, Mary Washington beat us by about ﬁve points

and we were able to beat Bridgewater. Our only real plan was to try . 

and close up the gap between our 4-5, which has been an issue for 
most of the season, and could be a deciding factor at ODACS.”
The meet was also important for boosting the team’s conﬁdence

going into postseason competition.

“It was an important meet insofar as we’re now entering champi-
onship season on a positive note,” Brower noted.

Meanwhile, the lady Generals were busy in Allentown taking care
of business. The women took second and ﬁnished only 34 points be-
hind nationally ranked St. Thomas. Out of 203 runners, Washington
and Lee’s top runs included sophomore Katherine Telfeyan’s ﬁnish
in ﬁfth with a time of 24:23, and junior Rebecca Taylor who took
seventh with a time of 24:31. Sophomore Dorothy Todd crossed the
ﬁnish line in 25:16 to take 18th while junior Elizabeth Webb ﬁnished
22nd in a time of 25:16 and freshman Christine Balisterri ﬁnished in

a time of 25:18 to capture 24th.

“[The meet was] a really big deal for us,” said Taylor. “I am so

proud of how awesome the entire team did!”

Running against out-of-region teams is extremely important for a

team striving to make it to nationals.

Team upsets No. 1 seed Bridgewater to win another ODAC crown

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

For the ﬁrst time in years, the Washington
and Lee women’s volleyball team did not en-
ter the ODAC playoffs as the top seed. How-
ever, this only made them more determined
to win as they steamrolled their way through
Emory & Henry, Randolph-Macon College,
and Bridgewater to win their seventh con-
secutive ODAC title and assure themselves
a place in the NCAA playoffs. The Generals
entered the tournament as one of the league’s
hottest teams, riding a 22 game winning
streak dating back to September 22.

On Friday evening the Generals opened
the tournament against seventh-seeded Em-
ory & Henry. The Generals took the sting out
of the Wasps who only managed a meager
0.073 hitting percentage for the match. Offen-
sively, the Generals were led by junior Laura
Maurer’s 10 kills and eight aces and sopho-
more Rachael Phillips’ 10 kills. Preparing the
way for the attack were setters senior Lauren
Rudolph and sophomore Kristi Stevens, who
tallied 17 and 20 assists, respectively.

“We just focused on our game and played
at our own pace, not thinking about what
team was on the other side of the net,” said
Phillips about the team’s focus in the early
rounds. '

The ﬁnal score was 30-19, 30-17, 30-12.
The win advanced the Generals to the semi-
ﬁnals where they would face sixth-seeded
Randolph-Macon who upset Virginia Wes-
leyan to advance.

The Generals did not drop a game to Ran-
dolph-Macon in the two matches they played
during the regular season. The streak contin-
ued as the Generals swept the Marlins 3-0
with games scores of 30-14, 30-17, 30-25.
Phillips and Maurer continued to lead they
way, tallying 18 and 12 kills respectively.
Stevens and Rudolph combined to chip in 36
assists, and senior Jess Hudock added seven
kills and eight digs.

in the regular season, but that game helped
us see what we needed to improve upon to
get better as a team, so we focused on those
things and have improved dramatically since
then.”

The Generals played like a team on a mis-
sion, grounding the Eagles’ plans to foil the
Generals’ hopes for a seventh straight ODAC
title. En route to a 30-22, 30-19, 30-18 vic-
tory, the Generals were led by the usual sus-

“We had no doubt that we were going to win the game against

Bridgewater. We have a much tougher schedule than they do

and have battled good teams and come out on top, so we had

the edge in that area. ”

LAUREN RUDOLPH, team captain

In the ﬁnals, the Generals faced a Bridge-
water team that had not lost since September
15 and had swept the Generals in the Warner
Center earlier in the season. However, the
team knew this match would be different.

“We had no doubt that we were going to
win the game against Bridgewater,” said Ru-
dolph. “We have a much tougher schedule
than they do and have battled good teams and
come out on top, so we had the edge in that
area. The ﬁrst time we played Bridgewater
we did not play as well as we wanted to, and
we lost. Of course we hated losing to them

pects. Phillips, Maurer and Hudock all regis-
tered double-digit kill totals while Rudolph
and Stevens combined for 39 assists.

“It is amazing to have won ODACs every
year that 1 have played,” said Rudolph. “Be-
ing a part of a program that is this successful
is amazing and I’m sure that tradition will
continue long after I’m gone because of the
coaches and players that constitute the W&L

proposed four-
Week Spring Term

Current structure strains faculty,
undermines academic exploration

By John Henderson
5 TA F F w R I T E R

President Ruscio made the case for a shorter Spring Term on
Monday to students, stating that two classes in the spring is too
many. “If we don’t do something, spring term is going to be in
real jeopardy,” he said.

But he made his pitch to a largely empty room. Two student
forums — one on Oct. 15 and one on Oct. 29 — drew just one stu-
dent to each meeting.

That miserly turnout suggests that student input won’t be a
major factor when faculty vote on the plan today.

This year, students will be required to take two classes dur-
ing Spring Term, which Ruscio believes will defeat the purpose
of having a shorter semester. He is concerned that Spring Term
will become a condensed fall or winter term, not the immersive
academic experience it was meant to be. R

Last year, the faculty voted in favor of a two-class require-
ment for Spring Term, believing that many students were treating
Spring Term like a six-week vacation. A more intensive term
would keep students focused on school, they reasoned.

But as Ruscio pointed out, 25 percent of the student body
would have to leave to accommodate regular class limits. Other-
wise, classes would have to get bigger. Ruscio fears that small
classes encouraging academic exploration, which are the essence
of Spring Term, would be replaced by large, ungainly ones.

“If we don ’t do something, Spring Term is
going to be in real _ jeopardy...we have one

foot on the gas and the other foot on the

J

brakes. ’

Ken Ruscio, university president

Ruscio’s plan would limit students to one class during the
four-week term and thereby keep classes small. He said that his
model would revert Spring Term to its original format: a short,
intense academic experience with greater ﬂexibility.

Ruscio stressed that he is not trying to get rid of Spring Term
but save it. He said, “l’m worried that in two years it would re-
ally collapse. .. This is a way of rejuvenating Spring Term.” He
said that students would still have the option of going abroad for
a full six weeks or doing spring internships such as the Washing-
ton Program.

Ruscio sees a lot of potential in a four-week Spring Term.
Without scheduling constraints, professors could be creative

bus driver; “most show respect, but then
you have the oddball. . .the one’s that are
good try to be good for the one’s that
aren’t.”

Hudnall has actually seen marked im-
provement over the last few years; while
he received “no thank-yous” his ﬁrst
year at W&L, he now says a majority of
riders thank him.

“For the most part, students are very
polite,” said driver John Smith, “[but]
every crowd has one or two jerks.”

The Bad

According to Smith, there are three
kinds of drunks: “the happy go-lucky
drunk, who is nice and sweet, the guy
who wants to ﬁght, and the sick and
blacked-out kind.”

Rude and belligerent riders are a pe-

rennial problem none of the drivers be-
lieve will ever go away. Each deals with
them in their own way.

Hudnall, for example, is fond of slow-
ing down near the county jail and direct-
ing the angry rider’s attention that way:
“there’s free room and board there!” he
exclaims.

Music can also sooth the savage
drunk; Massie and Hudnall’s buses are
both equipped with sound systems. “They
ask for music,” said Massie, “[it’ll] keep
them calm until we get where we are go-
ing.”

Sick students are a sore spot: “Use
the bucket, don’t use the bus,” said Hud-
nall. John Smith —who has taken three
students to the Health Center already this
year—vividly recounted an episode in
which a rider at the back of the bus was
so sick that the evidence of his sickness
ran all the way to the front of the bus.

Liquids of any sort are forbidden; vi-
sual evidence of alcohol earlier this year

classes, he said. Students would
have more time and attention to
dedicate to one class and would
get more out of it.

The plan would “revitalize

the academic conversation and
get us thinking in new and excit-
ing ways,” Ruscio said.
Ruscio’s plan is not just to short-
en Spring Term but to lessen the
teaching, credit and major re-
quirements as well. Professors
would only have to teach 5.5
courses per year, which in practi-
cal terms means ﬁve courses one
year and six courses the next.
Teaching is more complex than
ever, Ruscio said, and professors
need more time to teach, advise,
write and do research.

Ruscio said that most other
liberal arts schools have far
smaller requirements than we
do, but at W&L we try to do too
much. “We have one foot on
the gas and the other foot on the
brakes” he said.

But Ruscio also feels that
W&L has the best environment
of any liberal arts college for
teaching and learning. He be-
lieves that if W&L can rethink
its requirements, it will become a
leader among liberal arts colleg-
es. “We’d be like the Red Sox
sweeping the Rockies” he said.

Ruscio will present his plan
to the faculty today. If approved,
the plan would go into effect in
the 2009-2010 academic year.
Spring term would go back to
its original format until that time
six weeks long with only one re-
quired class.

“We want to have another

Rudolph. “Once we ﬁnd out who

will be our focus, but if we con-
tinue to play the way we have the
past few weeks, 1 think it will be a
great NCAA tournament for us.”

“Whether we win or lose, we
just hope to play all out and leave
everything on the court,” said
Phillips. “And if we do lose, we
want to go down ﬁghting.”

even provoked the police to search a bus.
This Parents Weekend, one rider tried to
bring what Smith described as “a trash
bag full of beer” on the bus. When Smith
explained that the spirits would have to
stay behind, the spurned rider was “very
upset.”

The drivers agree that students don’t
understand the buses.

“When they get on the bus, it’s like
‘what can you do for me?”’ said Smith.
Students don’t realize that Traveller is a
system to get them home safely. Many
also can’t wrap their minds around the
idea of Country Express, which runs a
continuous route from Red Square to the
country after midnight to reduce wait
times.

Riders tend to swarm the buses near
the end of the night, fearful of being
stranded. Drivers have seen some stu-
dents nearly trampled in the rush, de-
spite the fact that the buses will gener-
ally make another run after 2:00 if the

crowds warrant it; Traveller Country
Express didn’t return to Red Square on
Parents Weekend Saturday until 2:29.

Despite recent troubles, Massie is op-
timistic that the Traveller organization
and the students can solve their prob-
lems: “Together, we’ll all get this ironed
out.”

The Taxi

There is no typical night for a Travel-
ler Dispatch driver. On October 26, for
example, driver Jess Steinmetz (with a
Phi reporter in tow) was sent to a non-
existent address in town, mistaken for a
Dominoes delivery vehicle, and offered
a chance to purchase narcotics some-
time in the future by a particularly grate-
ful rider.

“It was such a slow night,” she said--
without irony-—afterward..

Operated by the students for the stu-
dents, the Dispatch service operates a
number of taxicabs that ferry students

right out of the box, along with a

30-Day FREE Napster To Go trial.

When I think sometimes

Why do we laugh at situations that really are not funny?

By Lenora Nunnley
C0 LUM NIST

Why exactly do we laugh? That’s right;
I am asking why do we laugh, in particular
at other people? Many of the things that we
giggle, chuckle, and double over laughing
at are not really funny at all once you stop
and think about it.

I’m sure you’ve found yourself, at some
point in your life, laughing at a person be-
cause they are running. Yes, running, which
by itself is not hilarious. However, given
that all surrounding people are calmly walk-
ing and there’s that one man who is sprinting
as if being chased by a cheetah that hasn’t
eaten for 91.2 days, you just might ﬁnd run-
ning rather funny.

Would you laugh? Even if you’re not the
laughing type, most would smile or at least
make a little humming sound as if to contain
a laugh.

Why? Because we ﬁnd it funny when
other people run and we are unaware of the
reason. Of course the man could be running
to save a baby who is being suspended ov_er
a balcony by a very pale high—voiced male
or perhaps he is running to help a 97-year-
old lady cross the street. However, because
of his inability to share that valuable infor-
mation, he will be the source of someone
else’s laughter.

Sadly, I cannot honestly say that it would
make much of a difference even if he were
being chased by a hungry cheetah. It’s my
bet that after the bystanders ensured their
own safety, they would most deﬁnitely bend
over and laugh at the man who was running
for his life.

This is not funny. However, if such a
thing were to happen, I guarantee you that
99.5 percent of the witnesses would laugh,
call someone else and tell an exaggerated
version of the story, and/or bring up the
situation for comic relief at some point in

the future.

Why do we laugh when people
fall? Here’s how it usually happens: Some-
how you fall, quick like lightning you get
up, rearrange your clothes, and wipe off a
single bead of perspiration, and you look
around two to four times to make sure you
were not seen.

If you have witnesses, you look down
at your feet and ﬂoor and exclaim “what
was that?” loud enough for everyone to
hear, pretending that something besides
your own two feet caused your fall. As you

Of course the man could be
running to save a baby who is
being suspended over a balco-
ney by a very pale high—voiced
male... but because of his in-
ability to share that, it is funny.

carefully walk away looking confused, you
listen for whispers or laughs. Once you’re
out of sight of the witnesses you sigh while
thinking,“That was so embarrassing.”
That’s mostly likely how you reacted
when you fell. A deviation would be if you
fell on your face or in front of kids. If you
fall on your face, never jump back up; most
likely your face will be stinging so badly
that you won’t be able to anyway.
However, even if you feel like you can
get up, stay on the ground motionless and
wait for someone to run to your rescue; that
way people will be more apt to feel sorry
for you or at least see if you are okay be-
fore laughing. Actually, when you fall it’s

always best to stay on the ground for a few
seconds rather than jump back up; with ev-
ery second you remain on the ground, the
level of sympathy you will receive increas-
es exponentially.

But if you fall in front of a group
of kids, you better be prepared for an
earthquake. Yes, the earth will shake with
high pitched laughter. A vivid description of
your fall will deﬁnitely be the ﬁrst thing out
of all the kids’ mouths when they see their
parents.

Most likely after one of these falls you
will start preaching that falling is not a
laughing matter and can be very serious be-
cause people can get hurt. Your pride will
probably be the only things hurting at the
time, but you will try to convince the kids
otherwise by making up some story about
someone who fell and had to go to the
hospital. The extreme may even say that the
person died because of their fall.

If you trip, you will also get laughed
at. However, trips are more disappointing,
at least for the witnesses. So you’re walk-
ing, whistling a cheerful tune, and you trip;
there is a spilt second between a trip and a
fall, and it’s during that spilt second that sus-
pense builds and people become excited.

During that split second, people around
you will start celebrating within themselves
as they think they are about to witness a
fall. However, you terminate their anticipat-
ed climax of you hitting the pavement when
you catch yourself and do not fall.

Of course, some will ask you if you are
okay, but they are secretly very dismayed;
others will laugh anyway to mask their dis-
appointment. _

I’ve given you three examples of things
we laugh at that are not exactly funny, how-
ever, the list could go on. By no means am I
advising anyone to stop laughing. Laughing
is good for your health; I just want you to
stop and ponder why we laugh.

Strikes = reruns

Why pay more for disappointing quality?

W&L sﬁrst Black Homecoming Queen addresses student shock at her win

I was not surprised to ﬁnd an
article attacking diversity on our
campus in the Parents Weekend
Edition. It is a yearly tradition
after all. I was taken aback,
however, by the number of fac-
tual errors within “Guilt Fuels
Diversity Initiatives.” Before I
address the substantial concerns
about diversity on our campus,
let me set a few things straight.

Therelare indeed special di-
versity awareness weeks, meals
in the dining hall, and speak-
ers. Most of these initiatives
are hosted by student organi-
zations, not the administra-
tion. The Multicultural Student
Association (MSA) sponsors
heritage months that recognize
the contributions of the various
cultures and groups to W&L
life and American society. The
Student Association for Inter-
national Learning (SAIL) often
collaborates with the D-Hall to
sponsor special menus, drawing
attention to the diversity that ex-
ists within our student body. I
imagine that if I came from an-
other country, I would want to
share some aspect of my culture
with others. Why not food? We
all have to eat.

The article also mentions
that there are special programs
to help non-white students
“transition” into life at W&L. I
like to think of myself as rather
informed, and to my knowledge,

Sororities create student divide,

As a member of a Greek or-
ganization, I am truly aware of
all the positive aspects that the
Greek system embodies; other-
wise why would I bother? That
being said, my positive experi-
ence has been tainted by a huge
ﬂaw in W&L’s Greek system.

One of its biggest draws,
the all-inclusiveness touted as
so unique to our school, actu-
ally serves to exacerbate the
“elitism” and “doubting of self-
worth,” a problem acknowl-
edged by Dane Boston’s article.
By its very nature, the inclusion
of a vast majority of the student

there are no special transition
programs for multicultural stu-
dents. In general, students have
access to the same transition
programs. If there are efforts
to help multicultural students
adjust to campus, they are ini-
tiated and controlled by other
students.

It is not my intention to focus
on these surface-level details
about diversity. Instead, like the
author, I want to challenge the
common perception of diversity
on our campus. The problem
with diversity on our campus
lies not with the administration
but with the student body. Let’s
discuss the Homecoming Queen
controversy.

I am honored to be the 2007
Homecoming Queen and indeed,
W&L’s ﬁrst Black Homecoming
Queen. What is sad about the
experience is that so many of us
were shocked that it happened.
Despite my work on campus,
love for this university and
some (not all) of its traditions,
I was afraid that I would not
be named Homecoming Queen
because of my race. Many stu-
dents are genuinely excited that
I am Homecoming Queen, yet
others would deny me the op-
portunity because I am black.
It’s disappointing to think that
students, my peers, would not
be able to see past my race and
acknowledge my connection to

body creates a hierarchy within
the Greek community and alien-
ates those not participating.

The all-inclusiveness of our
sorority system works to sepa-
rate the students, not unite them.
There exists a huge struggle for
recruitment. Instead of the po-
tential end goalin recruitment to
be in a Greek organization and
part of the Greek system as a
whole, the emphasis moves to try
to join the sororities at the top of
the hierarchy. What is the point
of an all-inclusive system if it
doesn’t even protect the feelings
of potential new members? Our

this university. In a community
that claims to be inclusive, it’s
hard to deal with this conflicting
perspective.

I am positive that when those
students expressed shock about
a black Homecoming Queen
that other students stayed silent
and did not challenge their state-
ments. I recognize that there are
“unoﬂicial” pressures on campus
to change who one is and con-
form to different ways of think-
ing, acting, and even dressing.
I know that there is a tendency
to ignore or disparage other stu-
dents because of their gender,
sexual orientation, Greek afﬁli-
ation (or lack thereof), race, or
ethnicity. We criticize the ac-
tions of our administration but
how often do we consider our
own actions? Those pressures,
those statements, and that way
of life come from within our
student body.

So what is diversity done
right? The ﬁrst step to “doing”
diversity right is to stop think-
ing of it as a burden upon our
university rather than a beneﬁt.
We should all consider how in-
creased diversity can broaden
our perspectives and help us
further engage in our local and
global communities rather than
focus on unrealistic hypothetical
changes to our university (such
as white southemers becoming a

minority group).

campus as a whole has decided
to ignore this problem and con-
tinues to promote the idealized
notion of total participation.

For now, seeing as the ad-
ministration continues to propa-
gate false beliefs about the func-
tion and intention of the Greek
system, the burden falls upon
potential new members to see
beyond meaningless stereotypes
and the dangerous tendency to
extract a measure of self—worth
from one’s membership.

Yes, joining certain organi-
zations will change your W&L
experience, and at this point in

Diversity done right includes
initiating open dialogue among
students about our campus cul-
ture and acknowledging that
not every tradition is perfect.
Diversity done right includes
initiatives by students to assess
inclusiveness on campus. It also
includes a student commitment
to diversity in its many forms.
Like the author, I look forward
to the day when it’s not a nov-
elty that a deserving woman
of any background is named
Homecoming Queen. In order
to see that day, however, W&L
students will have to take an ac-
tive role in bringing it about.

Therefore, it’s not a bad
thing to celebrate that W&L has
a black Homecoming Queen. It
is an example of the progress
W&L has made. But let’s not
stop there. We as students need
to come together and ﬁgure out
what we can do to make our
campus environment more in-
clusive. Stop expecting change
from the top and instead focus
on what we can do on a peer-
to-peer level. Diversity on this
politically correct and tradition-
mired campus will not happen
naturally. It’s an admirable no-
tion, but an inclusive community
on this campus requires proac-
tive student initiatives. We need
active student participation. I
am ready whenever you are.

hierarchy

your university career, it might
seem as though this change will
be for the worse.

But let me emphasize, in a
few years removed from the
emotionally-charged chaos that
is sorority recruitment, you’ll
see the emphasis on. your af-
ﬁliation wane, and life becomes
more about who you are, not
what you are. Appreciate the
Greek system for the opportuni-
ties it provides, but do not allow
the system to tell you that two or
three Greek letters deﬁne who
you are.

By Kathie Scott
COLUM NIST

The information from my fall
television lineup may now be obso-
lete since Hollywood writers have
called the ﬁrst strike since 1988.

The contract between The Writ-
ers Guild of America and the Alli-
ance of Motion Picture and Televi-
sion Producers expired on Oct. 31.

So what is this big nonnegotia-
ble quarrel over? The most popular
source of problems: money. The
writers want more.

Once upon a time, writers could
proﬁt only from VHS and the one
television slot they were appropri-
ated. We all know this has changed
in this new age of technology.

After all, how many of you
watch your favorite show online?
Now we have iPods, cell phones,
computers and DVD players all
providing viewers with more access
to the shows they love the most.

With television shows gaining
more visibility, writers feel they
should be paid more for their script-
writing abilities. And in all fairness,
don’t songwriters obtain ﬁnancial
compensation whenever their song
is played on a radio station, a mov-
ie, or a television show?

The big question, of course,
is how does this affect me? As a
viewer, the effects of the strike will
not be felt until next season. The
scripts for this season have already
been ﬁnished. The troubling times
will occur in January when new air-
ings will be replaced with reruns.

The only saving grace in this
matter is the surprisingly still popu-
lar reality television frenzy. These
shows do not heavily rely on writ-
ers and will therefore continue pro-
ducing new shows. The ﬁrst shows
to suffer will be late night shows
like The Jay Leno Show and The
Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Then
daytime and primetime shows like
General Hospital, Heroes, and
Grey’s Anatomy will provide an
appropriate dose of déja vu with
reruns galore. '

The more pressing matter is how
this strike affects the economy. The
entertainment industry contributes
to $30 billion dollars a year or seven
percent of Los Angeles’ economy.
In L.A. the amount of lost revenue
totals $2 billion dollars a month

and 82,000 lost jobs.

The scariest part to think about
is that this strike has a domino ef-
fect. It’s not just the writers who
lose money. The owner of Televi-
sion and Cinema Wardrobe Clean-
ers manages 2,000 garments a night
for certain television shows. There
are some Landscape companies
who specialize in greenery for tele-
vision show sets. Restaurants that
cater to certain studios have already
experienced a decline in customers
since talks of a strike began. And
of course Talent Agencies might
begin layoffs.

Now, when all these repercus-
sion are fully processed, I begin to
think the writers are selﬁsh. If the
writers continue with this strike,
the studios will be forced to either
show reruns or recreate past ideas
from earlier episodes. Oh wait, they
already do that anyways.

From analyzing the fall lineup,
I learned that the Hollywood motto
is “Reuse, Renew, and Recycle.”
So will anyone really notice if the
writers go on strike? Do writers,
who already make $200,000idollars
a year plus residuals, really need
their pensions doubled?

In fact, WGA writers made $56
million dollars in surplus for DVD
sales. What’s more, does anyone
really care if Hollywood writers
aren’t getting as much money as
they “deserve” when they’re al-
ready getting paid well enough
given the quality of the scripts?

Is anyone else really disappoint-
ed in “Grey’s Anatomy” lately? I
don’t think that writer should get
twice as much money. As entertain-
ing as “Heroes” can be at times,
does that writer really deserve
double his already large income?

Basically, I think the writers
should quit their whining. Show
me new scripts, with new ideas and
new twists, and then I’ll entertain
the idea of doubling their money as
a reward for all that they do.

Invest in Netﬂix. If January
comes around and the strike is still
going strong, invest in an obscene-
ly large movie collection and you
will be just ﬁne. The strike in 1988
lasted 22 weeks, I’m sure this strike
will not last any longer.

Now, if the actors follow suit and
strike, then some concern would be
appropriate.

Students Support Sudan

W&L students show support for Sudan while showing 017 their talent in Showcase

By Klmber Wlggs
STAFF WRITER

Last Friday, the Student Association for International Learning (SAIL) held
the second annual Showcase for Sudan. The competition brought acts from
all over campus to entertain and to promote the cause of stopping genocide in
Darfur.

W&L was treated to a wealth of homegrown talent, ranging from the co-
medic to the incredible. MarkHeavens Tshuma and Linnea Bond amused the
crowd with a song from the musical comedy Urinetown, while the Hotness,
featuring Zaq Lawal, Sophie Xiong, Colton Payne and Chris Washington, had
the audience agape with their astonishing moves. In the end, Eric Reitz came
in third place, Julia Pleasants landed second, and the Hotness walked away
with the ultimate prize. The dance group then wrapped up the evening with an
encore of their winning performance. '

Though the night was entertaining, to say the least, it is important not to for-
get the reason for the evening. The goal of the Showcase was to raise money for
and awareness about the continuing genocide in Darfur. When the Showcase
for Sudan was first conceived last year, the Darfur conﬁict was a major news
story, bringing it to the attention of one of SAIL’s sister organizations, IDRG
(International Development Relief Groups). I had a chance to interview Grace
Andrews, member of IDRG and one of the mastemiinds behind Showcase for
Sudan.

One question many people have is “Why Sudan?”

“Sudan is the genocide of our generation,” said Andrews. She and her fel-
low SAIL members felt that the injustice in Darfur was something particularly
relevant to our age group, something for people to rally behind and be pas-
sionate about. The conﬂict began back in 2003. Since that time, UN ofﬁcials
estimate that over 400,000 people have lost their lives due to starvation and
disease as well as ethnic violence. When faced with such statistics, it is difﬁcult
to remain complacent, which is why the Showcase was created. If a few more
people are made aware of this crisis and begin to further support the cause, then
I say the evening was a success.

The Showcase was also successful on a more local level, because it was an
opportunity for student organizations from all over campus to come together
for this important cause. The General Activities Board contributed time and
money, paying for the winners’ trophies and cash prizes. The faculty and ad-
ministration were very supportive of the planning and execution of the event.
Greek organizations helped spread the word among their membership. The Pro-
duction Club ran lights and sound. As Andrews ran through a list of organiza-
tions, it seemed as if the entire campus was involved in some way, which is a
truly inspiring notion.

“Sometimes there’s a disconnect,” said Andrews, “because so much is going
on. For this effort, everyone really came together... I don’t think it happens as
often as it should.”

Indeed, it doesn’t, but thanks to events like this, we are perhaps making
strides toward a more united and conscientious community.

New Scott ﬁlm good but
not best suited for actors
Washington and Crowe

By Scott Centorino
STAFF WRITER

“The loudest man in the room is the weak-
est."

So says Frank Lucas, portrayed by Denzel
Washington in the new crime ﬁlm, American
Gangster: Unlike other crime lords, Lucas‘
sharp yet subtle dress marks both his physical"
appearance and attitude toward the family busi-
ness. Lucas slowly rises to the top of New York
City‘s drug trafficking business in the late 1960s
and early 1970s in a cool but brutal fashion.

Arnerican Gangster, directed by Ridley Scott
and starring Washington and Russell Crowe, is
a gritty and violent slice of life during the Viet-
nam War. Its direction, costumes, soundtrack
and supporting cast all make the ﬁlm an excel-
lent way to spend two and a half hours.

It is well-paced, entertaining, thought-pro-
voking at times and does not drag. Scott’s previ-
ous ﬁlms, such as Black Hawk Down, Gladiator,
and Kingdom ofHeai'en, have many of the same
qualities in terms of setting moods and trans-
planting viewers into another era. However, the
ﬁlm’s weaknesses also spring from similari-
ties to other films. For the most part, American
Gangster is an updated, African-American ver-
sion of The l"r‘ench Cormection.

Scott’s lack of originality can become tire-
some for anyone who has seen The French
Connection, which won the Academy Award
for Best Picture in 1971. The same basic plot
of a cop (Gene Hackman in The French Con-
nection and Russell Crowe in American Gang-
ster) cracking a drug trafﬁcking scheme in the
greater New York City is copied well, but cop-
ied nonetheless.

Going to a movie starring two Best Actor
winners still in the prime of their careers, one
expects fantastic acting to carry the ﬁlm. Wash-
ington and Crowe have given some of the most
memorable performances of the last twenty
years, but neither performs with the depth that
their characters deserve.

However, looking back on Ridley Scott's re-
cord, wc see great movies, not great actors. For
example, Black Hawk Down didn’t mesmerize
us because ofteiriﬁc acting. Ridley Scott craft-
ed the filiii so the actingjust “ﬁt in” with his di'-
recting. Scott made Black Hawk Down, not Josh
Hartnctt. However, none of Ridley Scott’s pre-
vious hits were character driven. Perhaps Scott
doesn’t have the ability that other directors have
in bringing out the best in actors, or, perhaps he
just shines with epics that are entertaining rather
than a product of quality acting.

Regardless, American Gangster; although
billed as an epic, is no epic. No crime ﬁlm is an
epic. Not even The Godfather is an epic ﬁlm.
Crime films are naturally small scale, character‘
driven ﬁlms. Acting made The Godfather; as
well as The Departed and Good/‘e/las.

Americarr Gangster is simply a mismatch.
Ridley Scott excels in non—cliaracter driven,
historical epics. Deiizel Washington and Russell
Crowe excel in smaller, character-driven films,
which American Gangster should have been.
Despite all of this criticism, the film is superbly
entertaining and compellingly dirty.

For fans of the genre, it satisﬁes a craving.
But in the end, we see Ridley Scott try to over-
direct this ﬁlm, shadowing the acting talent he
has at his disposal. Scott's enormously powerful
(lirectioii actually hurts the ﬁlm.

“Tlie loudest man in the room is the weak-
est.“

The Birth of a New Evil Empire

Why two Red Sox titles in four years isn ’t necessarily a good thing

By Amor Neill Thuparl
smrr written

A lot has to happen for a
team to win a World Series these
days. You need to have excel-
lent pitching from your starters
to the heart of your bullpen. You
need to have consistent, timely
hitting in every tough playoff
situation. And maybe more so
than you think, you need to
have some luck, or a lot of luck
if you can, to help you along
the way. The 2007 Boston Red
Sox had all of these things and
more on their way to sweeping
the Colorado Rockies. The city
that was once synonymous with
heartbreak, disappointment and
failure in baseball now stands
atop the league once again, and
it doesn’t look like things are go-
ing to change anytime in the near
future.

As it stands right now, there
is no salary cap in Major League
Baseball, meaning that any team
can spend as much money as
they want, depending on the ﬁ-
nancial capabilities of its owner.
This has led to the New York
Yankees having a payroll of
over $195 million while teams
such as Washington, Florida and
Pittsburgh struggle to reach $50
million. The Yankees are no lon-
ger a team but simply a bizarre
collection of amazing talent that
cannot seem to win champion-
ships the way they did in the mid
to late 1990s when they were an
actual squad of 25 baseball play-
ers working together.

The same cannot be said
about the Red Sox given their
recent success in the postsea-
son, but it must be noted that
they have a payroll of over $143
million, easily the second high-
est payroll in all of baseball. In
the last off-season they paid over
$51 million just to talk to Japa-
nese pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka
and eventually signed him for
a contract that could be worth
$60 million. This year they also

playing according to the rules of
the game, and as long as there is
no salary cap in baseball, they are
allowed to spend how much they
want on whoever they want.
Using this tool to their advan-
tage, the Red Sox were able to
win the World Series this year
despite having just eight mem-
bers of their 25 man roster be
homegrown products of the Red
Sox farm system. The rest of the
team simply came together from

Hoards of Red Sox ‘fans ” now ﬂock to oppos-

ing stadiums and feel obligated to carry on

eryone else and then proceeds to tell everyone

spent $14 million on the listless
and hopeless J.D. Drew, whom
Boston fans have constantly be-
rated all season until Drew hit
a grand slam home run against
Cleveland and all was magically
forgotten.

Now, I’m_ not trying to make
it seem as if this is an unfair at-
tribute of the Red Sox. They are

other cities in search of a big-
ger contract. Boston outﬁelder
Manny Ramirez even said in an
interview when down 3-1 in the
ALCS, facing elimination to the
Cleveland Indians, “It doesn’t
happen, so who cares? There’s
always next year. It’s not like it’s
the end of the world.”

It’s sad to say it, but I’m not

the least bit hesitant to because
of the truth and reality of it, the
Red Sox completely show what
is wrong with baseball by buy-
ing their way to a World Series.
They did nothing different than
what the Yankees have done, and
along the way they even lost some
of their prized free agents to the
Yankees and other teams in bid-
ding wars. They didn’t look for
team chemistry but rather relied
on blind luck as to what would
happen and whether or not the
team would gel over the course
of the season. It’s the baseball
purists’ worst nightmare: a new
Evil Empire that actually wins
World Series titles.

Hoards of Red Sox “fans”
now ﬂock to opposing stadiums
and feel obligated to carry on
like the little kid in your neigh-
borhood who got a new bike and
comes to show it off for every-
one else and then proceeds to tell
everyone just how inferior their
bike is in comparison to his. Did
he earn his bike? Of course not.
Mom and dad had to buy it for
him so he’d stop complaining
and actually shut up for a while.
Pretty soon, fans of the Red Sox
will be put into the same posi-
tion as Yankees fans are now,
and if they don’t make it to the
World Series often and win them
with regularity, each season will
be a disappointment. So enjoy
it while you can, Red Sox fans,
because come next April it will
have been ﬁve months since
your last World Series win. It’s
unbearable, isn’t it? How unfair.

IM ﬂag football sees
new rules changes

Some teams don ’t like new rules, but referee says
using them has been easier than expected

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

Flag football has long been one of
Washington and Lee’s most popular in-
tramural sports. So Ray Ellington, W&L’s
campus recreation coordinator, knew that
making changes to this year’s IM league
would be difficult.

The biggest change is a move to link
W&L’s ﬂag football league into a national
competition between college intramural
champions. That means the winner of
W&L’s league gets to travel to the Univer-
sity of Maryland over Thanksgiving break
to compete for a spot in the national ﬂag
football championships.

The campus recreation department will
pay the winning team’s hotel and travel
costs.

But the ensuing rules changes — espe-
cially a rule that says all blocking must
be non-contact — are being questioned by
some IM participants.

Since the regional championships are
played under non-contact blocking rules,
Ellington said W&L’s winning team will
be at a major disadvantage if the league
doesn’t use the standard national rules.

But Chris Stevenson, a junior in his
second year as chairman of Phi Kappa
Sigma’s IM.program, said the new rules
are ruining W&L’s most-popu1arIM sport.
Phi Kap won last year’s football champi-
onship.

“They completely take away from the
sport of ﬂag football. You can’t even use
your hands to block on offense or de-
fense,” Stevenson said. “It takes away
all aspects of football. The game is now
just an NCAA-esque QB Option. There is
rarely an actual football play.”

Junior Jamila Seaton says refereeing
under the new rules has been easier than
she expected.

“At ﬁrst I was thinking it would be
impossible and that football was all about
contact, but the ﬁeld is so big and there is
so much passing that there really isn’t any
need for blocking,” Seaton said. “People
seem to be having more fun even though
at times the frustration of no contact sets
in.”

She said that teams haven’t always
liked the rules but haven’t been criticizing
the referees.

Another new and controversial deci-
sion is a new plan that grades each team’s
sportsmanship on a 4.0 scale. At the end
of the regular season, teams scoring below
a 3.0 won’t be allowed into the playoffs.

And if any team receives a GPA rating
of 0-1 .9, that team is immediately disqual-
iﬁed from the playoffs.

Stevenson said the GPA may sound
good in concept but is “terrible in execu-
tion.” ‘

“Most of the complaining done by
teams [is] the result of the terrible new
rules,” he said. “All of the arguing last
year was due to the competitive nature of
the sport  now the arguing is solely at
the ref to enforce the new rules, even if
both teams don’t agree with them. The refs
are paid too little to be yelled at.”

Stevenson said that he has struggled to
ﬁeld a team on some nights this year be-
cause players don’t like the new system.

He said his criticisms aren’t an attack
on Ellington and he appreciates the at-
tempts to make changes Still, he wishes
Ellington had let the IM chairs vote on the
new rules before implementing them.

Seaton thinks that the new rules will
gain acceptance as time goes by.

“I think it’s natural for us to complain
because we’re so used to doing things a
certain way, but in reality it’s not that
hard,” Seaton said. “It’s more [of a] habit
and it can be broken.”

ﬁI_11Sl1€S
with loss to
Lynchburg

By Mlchael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

After defeating Bridgewater 7-0 in the ﬁrst round
of the ODAC ﬁeld hockey playoffs, the Generals
hoped to avenge their regular season overtime loss
to rival Lynchburg College. Though they would
get the chance, they would come up short again,
losing 1-0 at Lynchburg to end their season.

By virtue of being the third seed in the ODAC
playoffs, the Generals gained home ﬁeld advantage
for their opening round match against Bridgewater Col-
lege. In their ﬁnal home game of the season on Parents’
Weekend, the Generals put on an offensive barrage against the
Eagles, easily winning 7-0.

The Generals started the scoring 15 minutes into the game and pro-
ceeded to ﬁnd the net seven times in the next 45 minutes. The ﬁrst half
belonged to seniors Kendall Korte and Melissa Dolan who scored two
goals apiece to give the Generals a 4-0 lead going into half.

In the second half, the Generals came out ﬁring again as sophomore Alex
Caritis scored just 1:15 into the period. Less than three and a half minutes
later senior Kay Dyt scored to make it 6-0. Junior Louise Bance registered
the ﬁnal tally for the Generals with just over 12 minutes to play.

All three goalkeepers got playing time for the Generals in the shutout,
but only sophomore Caroline Habliston was forced to make a save.

The Generals out-shot the Eagles 27 to one, with 20 of the Gener-
als’ shots being on target. W&L also won 13 penalty corners while
giving up only four.

The game against Lynchburg was a much different story. Lynch-
burg controlled much of the play in the ﬁrst half. The Generals man-

more forward Allie Weir found the back of the net with 10 minutes
to play. Though the Generals won four penalty comers in the second half, they were still unable to put a shot on goal and
Lynchburg survived 1-0.

Much like the loss in the regular season, the,Generals were dominated in almost every statistical category except goals.

The Generals managed only three shots the entire game, none of which were on target, and Lynchburg goalie Sarah Cates
was not forced to make a save. The Hornets ﬁred 26 shots, nine of which were on goal. Rubenstein ﬁnished with eight saves
in the game.

With the victory, the Hornets moved on to the ODAC ﬁnals where they would later defeat EMU on Saturday 1-0.

The loss ends the season for the team but senior Kendall Korte will continue for one more game as she was selected to play

7 ' THE RING-TUM PHI

 

~,. By Russ Weems

 

STAFF WRITER

The improbable run to an
ODAC title fell short Saturday
night for the men’s soccer team as
they fell to Roanoke 2-0.

Picked in the preseason to ﬁn-
ish fourth in the conference, the
team led the league standings for
most of the season and ﬁnished in
a tie for second place.

On Friday, the Generals took
on the Hampden-Sydney Tigers at
Virginia Wesleyan College in the
semiﬁnals of the ODAC men’s
soccer tournament. The game

y_ started quickly as Hampden-Syd-

ney’s Matt Swaney scored off of a
corner kick taken by Jason Powell
in the 10th minute.

This early goal did not shake
the Generals. They kept battling
and tied the game when senior
midﬁelder Travis Short put one
past Hampden-Sydney goalie
John Robert Pyler in the 40th
minute. The game went to half-
time tied 1-1.

The second half started as
quickly as the ﬁrst had. A Hamp-
den-Sydney foul in the penalty
box in the 47th minute gave the

Generals a penalty kick. The in-
tense game featured six yellow
cards and 27 fouls in total.

Junior defender Fletcher Mc-
Craw seized the opportunity and
buried the PK in the back of the
net to give the Generals the lead.
The Generals played tough de-
fense for the rest of the game and
W&L went on to the 2-1 victory.

In the end, the Generals had
outshot the Tigers 10-8, whereas
Hampden-Sydney had the comer
kick edge 10-2.

Men roll through early rounds but came up a little short against Roanoke in ODA C ﬁnal

their 12th victory of the season

and an opportunity to play in
the ODAC ﬁnal for the ﬁrst time
since 2003. The Generals were
enthusiastic about their win and
looking forward to the champion-
ship game.

On Saturday evening, the
Generals faced the fourth seed

 \, After the goal, the scoring set-
tled down a bit. The score stayed
1-0 for the majority of the game

The Generals battled hard
in the second half but could not
beat Roanoke’s goaltender Austin
Rose, who had ﬁve saves for a
clean sheet. Despite the 2-0 score,
shots and comers were relatively

tournament with a 12-3-3 record.
The date of the Generals’ next

Roanoke for a second time this year

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The women’s soccer team went 1-1 in
the Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament this past week, ending their
hopes of an ODAC title.

Four days after defeating Eastern Men-
nonite 3-1 in the regular season ﬁnale, the
two teams met in the ﬁrst round of the
conference tournament. This was the 19th-
straight season that W&L advanced to the
tournament.

The game was played at home on Watt
ﬁeld this time. The Generals asserted
themselves early by putting pressure on
Eastern Mennonite at the outset. W&L
controlled the ball on the Royals’ side of
the ﬁeld for a majority of the ﬁrst half.

In the 21 st minute, Anne Van Devender
broke free from the defense and notched
her 15th goal of the season. Just 13 min-
utes later, Roz Klann scored an unassisted
goal, improving the score to 2-0. The Gen-
erals took this 2-0 lead into halftime.

W&L came out in the second half the
same way they started in the ﬁrst half,
controlling the ball on the opponents’ side
of the ﬁeld. Under 15 minutes into the
second half, Martha Caulkins added in an-
other goal off of a pass from Katie Kern.
From then on, the team did not look back.

Eastern Mennonite tightened the con-
test by scoring a goal with 10 minutes to
play. However, it was not enough as the
Generals rolled past Eastern Mennonite
3-1 and into the semi-ﬁnals of the touma-
ment.

W&L amassed a staggering 36 shots
in the match compared to four by Eastern
Mennonite.

The Generals then traveled to face ri-
val Roanoke in a game where the winner
would advance to the conference champi-

onship. The two teams played each other
less than two weeks ago in a grueling
double overtime match in which Roanoke
won 2-1. W&L had revenge on its mind
this time. ,

Once again, the importance of the
game was matched by the intensity ex-
erted on the ﬁeld. Each team countered the
other by attempting to go down the ﬁeld
and score, but the teams came up empty
in the extremely physical ﬁrst half. Each
team committed ﬁve fouls in the ﬁrst half
and W&L ended up with two yellow cards
in the outing.

The scoring drought quickly ended
when a ﬂurry of goals came early in the
second half. In the 54th minute, Roa-
noke’s Kristen McCoy knocked in a shot
off of a cross from Meredith Grunewald.
Four minutes later, W&L’s Shana Oltmans
knotted the game at 1-1 after taking a shot
that deﬂected off the crossbar and went
into the back of the net.

“Marisa [Van Brunt] took a great free
kick, and I was able to ﬂick it on behind
me, and then the ball ended up popping
back out to me and I was able to chest it
and half volley it into the goal,” said Olt-
mans of the goal. “I was ecstatic after we
scored, and I deﬁnitely thought we were
going to have the momentum and score a
few more.”

However, momentum immediately
shifted back toward the Maroons as Jes-
sica Joyner put in a rebound off of a shot
deﬂected by the Generals defense at 61 :08.
This goal turned out to be the game win-
ner as Roanoke quashed W&L’s goal of an
ODAC title.

The soccer team must now wait for the
announcement of whether they will re-
cieve an at-large bid to the NCAA Touma-
ment, which was unknown when the Phi
went to press.

Two dynasties roll on

Men and women Sweep ODAC cross country meet

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s cross country teams have truly
become dynasties in the conference after
winning the ODAC Championships for
a fourth year in a row. Both teams took
control of the course and advantage of the
home ﬁeld as the men ﬁnished ﬁrst out of
nine teams and the women took ﬁrst by
a very slim one point over second-place
Roanoke.

“Winning a fourth ODAC title was like
dancing with your eldest daughter on her
wedding day and hearing her whisper ‘I
love you daddy’ into your ear,” said senior
and captain Andrew F riski.

The men’s team was led by junior Mi-
chael Welsh who ﬁnished second in a time
of 27:56.35, while senior and captain Tom
Brower took‘ third, crossing the ﬁnish at
28:03.97. Juniors Vance Berry and Alex
Jackson, and Friski ﬁnished sixth, thir-
teenth, and fourteenth, respectively. Their
respective times were 28:33.19, 29:26.50,
and 29:36.98.

Jackson described the highlight of the
day.“The best part of the day was the mo-
ment Friski and myself ﬁnished the race
and everyone went absolutely nuts. There
was an indescribable energy in the air when
everyone realized that we had defended our
title. Hugs were given out generously.”

Brower agreed. “I couldn’t have asked

for anything more perfect than Saturday.
It was a very emotional day between how
well the race went personally, how well
the team ran, and having my parents there.
Having spent four years running for W&L
and never letting the ODAC title leave
Lexington is a very special thing, some-
thing I’ll always remember.”

Meanwhile, the women were led by
sophomore Kat Telfcyan and junior Becca
Taylor, who took ﬁrst and second respec-
tively with times of23:-48.80 and 24:09.25.
Junior Elizabeth Webb ﬁnished in a time of
24:40.80 to take sixth. Freshmen Christine
Ballistreri and Katherine Fenwick took
11”‘ and 13"‘ with times of 25:27.24 and
25:34.59, respectively. Sophomore Doro-
thy Todd rounded out the leaders by ﬁnish-
ing 14"‘ with a time of 25:37.74.

Because of her win, Telfeyan earned
ODAC women’s cross country Runner of
the Year honors.

Telfeyan commented, “Personally I
was very excited to win the race; it was the
ﬁrst time I had won a cross country meet.
1 think we all knew how close it would be
with Roanoke and that every point counts
and it helped knowing that every one of
us was going to put everything into that
race.”

Webb spoke about the emotions of the
day for the women. “I still haven’t come
down from cloud nine. 1 think we’re all
still in shock that we actually pulled off a
fourth victory and by just one point. After

Roanoke defeated us at our home invite
earlier this season, we were pretty disap-
pointed, but we refocused and continued to

train hard. We all knew that the victory in’

October would be the one that would mat-
ter. By the time ODACs rolled around, we
were ready. Everyone on the team contrib-
uted that day. 1 still get chills thinking that
if any one of us had let another Maroon
jersey slip by, we would have come in sec-
ond. The close races are the ones that you
remember forever.”

Brower was named the ODAC men’s
cross country Scholar-Athlete of the Year
for the second-straight year and Coach
John Tucker was named the ODAC men’s
cross country Coach of the Year for the
sixth time in his 19 seasons here at W&L.

Taylor was named the ODAC women’s
cross country Scholar-Athlete of the Year
for the second straight year and Coach Kris
Hoey was selected the ODAC women’s
cross country Coach of the Year for the
fourth time in her ﬁve seasons at W&L.

The teams will try to advance to Na-
tionals on Nov. 10 at the NCAA Regional
in Williamsburg.

An enthusiastic and optimistic Todd
commented, “We are so excited about the
opportunity to run at Regionals and are re-
ally looking forward to shaking things up
at the race! A lot of teams have underes-
timated us this season... I think that they
are going to be in for quite a surprise come
Saturday!”

Football extends win streak to three

Team snaps seven game loosing streak to Bridgewater in ﬁnal home game

By Brian Devlne
STAFF WRITER

Wilson Field has seen a lot. Since its
construction in the ﬁrst decade of the 20th
century, Washington and Lee football has
seen highs— a trip to the 1951 Gator Bowl-
and lows- a cheating scandal and removal
from NCAA D-I two years later. Now, a
century after students clamored for a per-
manent home to play their favorite sport,
Wilson Field has seen its ﬁnal match.

It was the Parents’ Weekend football
game, an annual tradition of gridiron in
the cool October air. The Generals, fresh
off shutting down Guilford’s top-ranked
offense, faced the Bridgewater Eagles,
ranked 19th in the country.

It would be almost a disservice to Wil-
son Field for W&L to lose its ﬁnal game to
the Old Dominion Athletic Conference’s
traditional doorrnat, though the Eagles
have now become one of the conference’s
powers. The elements for a classic were
all there - a full stadium, a raucous crowd,
and the knowledge that this game would
be the last at the grand old ground.

Playing better than they had all season,
the Generals delivered. The Blue Menace
had another outstanding defensive perfor-
mance, holding Bridgewater to 212 yards
of total offense and just 14 points, the Ea-
gles’ lowest point total of the season.

Safety Kyle Luby again led the Gener-
als with 11 tackles, and the visitors’ star
running back Phillip Carter had only 103
yards rushing. The Generals were led by
Stuart Sitterson, who racked up his third
consecutive 100-yard game, totaling 216

all-purpose yards, including 103 on the
ground.

The Blue Menace looked to be in trou-
ble early on when Carter ran roughshod
over the hosts on the visitors’ ﬁrst series,
scoring a touchdown just 4:12 into the
contest. But Luby and his cohorts started
closing the gaps and Carter was not to see
the end zone again.

The Generals started their rally with
two touchdowns at the end of the ﬁrst
half, ﬁrst on a 22-yard pass from R]. Var-
ner to Ty Parrino and then a two-yard con-
nection from Vamer to Billy Murray with
30 seconds remaining. Mark Snoddy then
kicked a ﬁeld goal in the third quarter to
give the home side a 17-7 lead.

With Carter’s success limited, the Ea-
gles turned to the air in the second half.
Bridgewater quarterback Jeff Highﬁll
pulled his squad within three points but
the Generals’ defense held strong to pre-
serve the win.

As soon as the ﬁnal whistle blew, the
thousand of fans left Wilson Field in its
current conﬁguration for the last time.
Two days later construction crews started
dismantling the aging metal grandstand
and the Blue-and-White started looking
toward their next conference game, on
Saturday at Emory & I-Iemy.

A loss at E&H would discount the
Boys in Blue from any chance at the
ODAC title. But Jack Martin, largely ab-
sent from the Parents’ Weekend victory,
was not about to let that happen. Martin

hauled in a 61-yard touchdown pass from
Vamer with 67 seconds remaining to win
the game by the same scoreline, 17-14. In
the remaining time the Menace forced the
Wasps to turn the ball over on downs and
the win was preserved.

Sitterson was again his dynamic self,
recording a career-high 100 yards on the
ground in addition to 89 return yards and
eight receiving yards. Vamer had one of
his best games, turning in 193 yards pass-
ing. Tommy Matteo recorded nine tackles
and Bryant Fulk had eight plus one inter-
ception.

Even with the win, though, the Gener-
als fell short of their goal of returning to
the postseason. Randolph-Macon’s Sat-
urday victory over Bridgewater left them
atop the ODAC-table with a 5-0 confer-
ence record with one game to play. Sitting
third with two losses, the Generals cannot
ﬁnish any higher than second.

The conference title and its automatic 1

playoff berth will be decided next Satur-
day in suburban Richmond when R-MC
hosts second-placed Hampden-Sydney.
The Generals, ﬁnished with their confer-
ence schedule, face Camegie-Mellon to
ﬁnish their season.

It will be nine frantic months before
the Generals start another season at a new,
more modern stadium for a football pro-
gram that once again has taken hold of the
support of the university’s sports fans.

Ruscio is controversial
proposal approved by

a majority of faculty

By Andy Rubln and Grace Wang
ASSISTANT COPY EDITOR AND ASSISTANT
NEWS EDITOR

After weeks of intense debate, Wash-
ington and Lee faculty ultimately support-
ed President Ken Ruscio’s new academic
plan by a wide margin. The proposal will
take effect during the 2009-2010 academic
yean

The largest and most controversial
change introduced by Ruscio reduces the
Spring Term from six to four weeks and
requires students to take one intensive aca-
demic course. This downsizes the current

. Spring Term, which requires two academic
courses. Because students will no longer
have to split their time between multiple
courses, Ruscio believes the new Spring
Term will promote deeper academic ex-
ploration and immersion, goals that were
initially sought after at the term’s incep-
tion.

Faculty response to Ruscio’s plan has
been largely positive as evidenced by the
plan’s passing last week. -

1}  Dr. Daniel Kramer of the German De-
7 partment believes the new plan will further
strengthen foreign language departments
in a meaningful way.

He pointed to innovative, immersion-

 

  
 

“T he main challenge will
be to ﬁnd a meaningful and
. important course of study
that can be accomplished in
only four weeks. Many col-
leges went down the road

the 1970s only to abandon
the effort after a few years. ”

of History

 

like courses on campus as well as a new
four-week study abroad experience, simi-
lar to Washington and New York Terms, as
areas of growth.

Kramer added, “We also think it may
lead to good discussions about introduc-
ing minors and International Studies at
W&L.”

The plan also includes a measure to
reduce faculty teaching load. Professors
will now teach 5.5 courses per year, which
means ﬁve one year and six the next. This
change will make W&L more comparable
to other top liberal arts colleges, most of
which require faculty teaching loads of 4.5
or ﬁve courses a year.

Finally, Ruscio’s plan reduces the num-
ber of credits students will need to gradu-
ate. Currently, students need 115 credits.
In 2009, this number will be six credits
less, or 109 total credits.

Although the new Spring Term will
shrink in duration, already-established
six-week study abroad programs such as

. Washington and New York Terms have
been widely endorsed by both faculty and
students.

Dr. Richard Bidlack of the History De-
partment said he looks forward to the op-
portunity to work intensively with a small
group of students during a four-week
term.

He said, “Creative options for faculty
will increase signiﬁcantly with students

College women across the country will be affected by an increase in
the cost of prescription contraceptives that they can obtain from their

' campus health centers starting this year.

Schools rely on discounts from companies in order to provide inex-
pensive birth control to their students. The Deﬁcit Reduction Act was
passed in 2005 and went into effect last January. This federal law affects
Medicaid discounts for drug companies and makes it difﬁcult for these
companies to offer low rates to colleges.

At Washington and Lee the increase in cost has caused the health
center to stop carrying some brands of contraceptives.

“The health center stopped getting [NuvaRing] and couldn’t sell
them for $5 anymore. Now I have to get a prescription from the health
center and go to the drug store to get NuvaRing,” one female student
said. She now pays between $50 and $60 each month.

Rates‘ that were about $5 per month last year have now risen to any-
where from $12 to $50 per month on some campuses. At the University
of Iowa, students are paying $53 per month for Ortho Tri-Cyclen-Lo, a
brand name birth control pill. This adds up to $636 spent in one year on
contraceptives.

Dr. Jane T. Horton, the director of Student Health and Counseling
at W&L, explained that two types of birth control pills are currently
offered at the health center. Solia, the generic name for Desogen, costs
$12 per month. Ortho Tri-Cyclen L0 is $5, but supplies of this brand
will soon run out, and that price will rise. The health center does not yet
know what the new cost will be.

“We will discuss contracep-
tive options and dispense one of
the ones we have here at the stu-
dent health center if appropriate,”
Horton explained.

Students can also receive a
prescription from the health cen-
ter and take it to a pharmacy if
the particular contraceptive is not
carried by W&L.

around, and this is an important
exception, are those of varsity
athletes.” '

Although response to the ap-
proved plan has been largely
positive, as evidenced by the
plan’s largely unanimous pass-
ing last week, faculty predict
there may be signiﬁcant kinks to
work out.

Bidlack said, “The main
challenge will be to ﬁnd a mean-
ingful and important course of
study that can be accomplished
in only four weeks. Many col-
leges went down the road that
we are headed back in the 1970s
only to abandon the effort after
a few years. But I hope that we
are determined enough and suf-
ﬁciently thoughtful to succeed
where others have failed.”

Dr. John Wielgus of the Biol-
ogy Department believes similar
difﬁculties may arise in the sci-
ences.

He said, “Some disciplines
— molecular biology, biochemis-
try, neuroscience, and engineer-
ing, for example — are already
hard-pressed to teach the mini-
mum foundational information
as is. Some traditional courses
predictably will be lost in the
new schedule and so will the op-
portunity to teach courses funda-
mental to\the major in the spring
term.”

Moreover, Wielgus worries
about Ruscio’s plan to reduce
the number of courses required
for graduation.

He said, “The biology major,
for example, requires eight cog-
nate courses in math, chemistry
and physics in addition to at least
34 credits in biology courses.
None of these courses can be
dropped without jeopardizing
our graduates’ ability to remain
competitive and gain entrance
into top post-graduate programs,
and ﬁtting them in over fours
years is difﬁcult as is along with
FDR requirements.”

Overall, however, Wielgus is
optimistic.

He said, “Despite these chal-
lenges, which must be addressed
successfully, the new curricular
plan will, as President Ruscio
noted, help re-establish W&L as
a premier liberal arts institution
— one that graduates whole peo-
ple, who are capable of viewing
world problems holistically and
eager to contribute to the human
enterprise.”

 

$5 per month, but the Federal
Deﬁcit Reduction Act of 2005
ended our discount contracts
about a year ago,” said Horton.

The health center no longer
offers NuvaRing because of the
increased cost. The doctors will
also soon be carrying more gener-
ic pills rather than brand names.

Since the increase in cost for
oral contraceptives at W&L has
not been extreme, Horton said
that most students have not been
severely affected.

“Students seem to have been
able to cope with the increase
from $5 to $12 per cycle-—they
just may not get as many cycles
at a time,” she said. “We can

sometimes get free sample packs
of pills that we can give a student
who really can’t afford the other
options.”

If students wish to use insur-
ance, they can get a prescription
from the health center and ﬁll it
at a pharmacy instead of purchas-
ing it at W&L. Another option is
to send a receipt to the insurance
company for reimbursement.

The price at a drug store will
vary, but at CVS Pharmacy, Ortho
Tri-Cyclen L0 is $53.99 for a one-
month pack without insurance.

“We can usually ﬁnd a contra-
ception option that students can
afford,” Horton said.

According to Time Magazine,

@2007 US. Cellular Corporation.

even though the law went into
effect in January, many campus
clinics did not feel the effect of
rising costs until the spring or fall
because they are now running out
of their supplies from last year.

Obtaining health insurance to
cover the new costs is an option,
but health care experts claim that
many women choose to pay for
their prescriptions on their own
because they cannot afford insur-
ance or do not want to involve
their parents.

Thirty-nine percent of fe-
male undergraduates used birth
control pills in 2006, according
to the American College Health
Association (ACHA). Others use

the patch, the shot, or NuvaRing,
which are also affected by rising
costs.

At W&L in 2005-2006, there
were 1,043 visits to the health
center to seek birth control, and in
2006-2007, there were 892. One
reason for the decrease is that the
doctors have begun to provide re-
ﬁll prescriptions through e-mail
rather than in person.

Some students are concerned
for their fellow college students
who may be putting themselves in
danger if they choose not to use
birth control because of the cost.

“[High costs] will only make
young women more vulnerable
and more likely to ﬁnd themselves

in bad situations of which they
are no longer in control and may
ultimately dramatically alter. the
lives of those involved, including
the innocent child which may be

about the cost of birth contro ,

Looking past Quiana’s skin color

‘f§§}4pplaud minorities not for their heritage but for real achievements

:::;,: By Celeste Cruz-carandang
:3_:C0LUMNlST

There has been a storm of

'3 controversy surrounding Quiana

McKenzie’s election as home-
coming queen. Rather than the
university reacting with a simple
and well-deserved congratula-
tions, McKenzie’s coronation
has warranted the questioning
.of diversity on Washington and
Lee’s campus.

Furthermore, the administra-
tion’s and student body’s actions
towards the increasing amount
of multicultural students has
been placed under unnecessary
and unjustiﬁed scrutiny. This
unfair criticism regarding diver-
sity leads me to conclude that
our progress as a community has
been overestimated.

Any article meant to congrat-
ulate Quiana referred to her as
W&L’s ﬁrst black homecoming
queen. By adding “ﬁrst black,”
Quiana is separated from the rest
of the past homecoming queens
and is onbut a different, not a

stems from a tendency to over-
complicate the problem. Our
community’s goal is to be ac-
cepting of all races and cultures.

But this acceptance cannot be
misconstrued with the acknowl-
edgement of different view-
points. It must go further than the
so-called assimilation of multi-
cultural students and address a
revolutionized attitude towards
those of diverse backgrounds.
This new state of mind deﬁnes a
person by, as Martin Luther King
Jr. said, by the content of their
character rather than the color of
their skin.

Unfortunately, Quiana has
been placed in the middle of a
politically correct tornado. I ﬁnd
that despite her numerous ac-
complishments, she only serves
as the faceless poster-child of
W&L’s progress towards diversi-
ty. It is quite abhorrent that a dis-
putation occurs because the only
identiﬁable feature of this poster-
child is the color of her skin.

I admit that I am also a multi-
cultural student. Up until the de-

aging attitude towards students
such as myself.

I am compelled to conclude
that W&L has not progressed
as far as previously thought. We
still cannot get past race and see
the actual person.

This pedantry has manifested
itself in a different way. Rather
than condemning the multicul-
tural student body, W&L con-
gratulates us. But these congrat-
ulations are not for our grades
or accolades or for our sense of
integrity and honor.

Rather, we are congratulated
because we are black, we are
Asian, we are Hispanic, or we
are different. While we are ex-
tremely proud of our heritage,
we do not want do be identiﬁed
by the deeds of our ancestors.

Quiana is homecoming
queen. Yet, with the addition of
one word, “black” or perhaps
even two, “African-American,”
Quiana gets lost and is buried
under the rubble of political-cor-
rectness and a slow progression
towards true diversity. «

This article is not meant as a
simple commentary or rant to-

wards the state of mind on this
campus. Instead, this is supposed
to act as a catalyst for a change in
this mindset. Do not congratulate
us because we were born a differ-
ent color than most. Commend
us because we excel in academ-
ics and athletics, but praise un-
der the same circumstances you
would applaud a white student.

I contend that diversity does
not simply encompass cultural
differences, but must also rec-
ognize the diversity of thought.
The expansion of this deﬁnition

"inspires students to see them-

selves not as multicultural or as
white, but simply see themselves
as students, united under one stu-
dent body.

I concede that we all come
from different backgrounds,
some more similar than others.
But diversity and acceptance is
not rooted in the celebration of
similarities. It comes from a cel-
ebration of differences.

So I want to say what has not
been officially said: Congratula-
tions, Quiana. You exemplify and
you are the title of homecoming
queen.

ate under a different value system
than most but we should build on
the fact that we are a community.
We should support rather than
condemn our fellow students. If
someone is doing something in-
appropriate, let them know, or
at least let one of your mutual
friends know. The person might
simply not know any better.

So while we gossip and giggle
about the bad life decisions of
others, let’s not feel morally su-
perior to our peers.

Don’t feel any better because
under intensely intoxicated cir-
cumstances you might have done
the same thing. But we’ve never
stop to ask ourselves if we did the
right thing.

For a school with so many
honorable traditions, it seems our
honor doesn’t translate to parties
on the weekends.

Sure we don’t lie, cheat or
steal but what else constitutes
honor? Our school was founded
on Robert E. Lee’s principle that
we have but one rule; to act as a
gentleman or a lady. Does making
out on the dance ﬂoor constitute
acting as a gentleman or a lady?
Or how about hooking up with
someone you just met?

Our honor should not only ap-
ply to academics, it should tran-
scend all aspects of our lives.

Maintain your dignity.

Maintain your honor.

Respect yourself.

Endless Spring Possibilities

Ruscio gets it right with his quick action on Spring Term,
but don ’t change policies to aﬂect students ’social lives

After a fall of discussion and debate, Pres-
ident Ken Ruscio and the faculty made the
right decision on Spring Term.

By an overwhelming majority the faculty
approved a new four week term, where stu-
dents will take one intensive class.

The plan covers more than Spring Term,
of course.

Ruscio says this proposal will help W&L
lead a discussion about liberal arts education
in America.

We know some students are disappointed
that they’ll lose two weeks of tubing, Goshen
trips and volleyball in the frat front yard.

Still, four weeks of Spring Term are better
than no Spring Term.

But Ruscio was right when he insisted that
the current Spring Term could not survive.

We simply don’t have enough professors
to make students take two classes.

And there is no indication that a signiﬁ-
cant students are willing to go abroad each
spring.

That’s why Ruscio’s plan is the best com-
promise.

It protects Spring Term for posterity and
makes the term an economic reality.

And if faculty really do design new class-
es rather than just condensing an old sylla-
bus, then Spring Term may be better than it
is now.

The possibilities are literally endless.

Art History classes that take ﬁeld trips to
Washington, D.C. and New York.

Civil War classes that travel across Vir-
ginia and up to Gettysburg or down to Vicks-
burg.

Not only is the new plan a great way to

protect Spring Term down the road, we also
like the way Ruscio handled the debate over
this new proposal.

Other discussions have dragged on for a
year or even 18 months.

This year the faculty voted less than two
months after the initial proposal.

Sure, the faculty may have wanted more
time to study the plan and consider its long-
term implications, but we needed direction
and change immediately, not a year down the

needs to ﬁx.

The requirement that students take two
classes this spring needs to be dropped.

Why was this measure introduced?

Because faculty felt that we weren’t get-
ting enough of an academic challenge.

Oh, and because they think we party too
much all spring.

Memo to the faculty: keeping us oﬂ‘ the
river on Tuesday afternoons is not a good
reason to tweak academic requirements.

If faculty really do design new classes rather than just con-

densing an old syllabus, then Spring Term may be better than

it is now. The possibilities are literally endless. Art History
classes that take ﬁeld trips to Washington, D. C. and New

York. Civil War classes that travel across Virginia and up to

Gettysburg or down to Vicksburg.

road.

Shortening the period for discussion may
also have helped keep the debate civil, some-
thing that hasn’t always occurred in past
Spring Term discussions.

Now the faculty on both sides of the de-
bate need to come together, put aside their
disagreements, and prepare for this plan so it
can hit the ground running in April 2010.

There’s still one more thing the faculty

You focus on academic life; let us and the
Dean of Students worry about everything
else.

In any case, Ruscio has won a major vic-
tory with this plan.

Students should be excited that future
generations will get to enjoy the same Spring
Term experience we have.

IM football
obliterated

Rule changes hard to enforce,
fail to beneﬁt anyone, and
ruin the integrity of the game

 

Editor:

I am 5-feet, 7-inches tall and weigh 135 pounds. If
anyone stands to beneﬁt from the new rules governing
IM ﬂag football, it’s me. Under the new rules prohibit-
ing contact, I do not run the risk of broken bones or
other bodily harm from contact with another competi-
tor. Under the new rules, I should be perfectly happy
with my IM experience.

Yeah. Right.

What are these new rules designed to do? As far as
my team and I can tell, the purpose of these new rules
is to eliminate the integrity of the game.

What we are playing on the turf ﬁeld can hardly
be called football. If we wanted to run around on the
turf ﬁeld without touching anyone or hitting anyone,

All I hear are excuses

Website sells fake notes for $25 to avoid work or classes

By Jess Steinmetz
CO LU M NIST

I remember classmates having the most ri-
diculous excuses in school for not doing their
homework. “My dog ate it” was one that al-
ways came up from one not-so-bashful third
grader.

, As I entered high school, I met people who
came up with more creative excuses and actu-
ally used their parents to sign their fake excuse
notes. They would claim their child had been
sick the night before, the intemet was down so
they could not ﬁnish the research for the gov-
ernment term paper, or their cable was broken
so they could not watch Spanish television or
the news.

Others would go even beyond making ex-
cuses and straight out lie by verifying that their
child had completed the required number of
service hours that they knew their teenager was
just too lazy to complete. I never understood
that.

Why would a parent sign a note that lied to
the teacher of his or her child? I was due for
a real shock when I heard about www.myex-
cusedabsence.com. Can you imagine making
money by giving people excuses to get off
work? Darl Waterhouse and John Liddell do

exactly that. Their website charges custom-
ers $25 for excuse notes to get outof work or
class.

“Dr. Sicknote” sells templates with fake
notes intended to fool professors or employers.
Customers simply type in their name and any
applicable personalized information such as

with fake notes tofoolprofes—
sors or employers. After press-
ing print, they receive what

looks like a genuine document.
 

the doctor’s name and business address. After
pressing print, they receive what looks like a
genuine document.

The excuses sold include a visit to the doc-
tor or dentist, emergency room, jury duty, and
funeral service. They will even sell a funeral
service program with names of pallbearers and
poems to honor the dead. Seriously, how sick
can you be? It is bad enough someone would
pay to lie to their boss, but why in the world

would you make up a death and show fake evi-
dence to ‘prove it’?

The website actually features a picture of
someone skiing with the following quote as
background text: “Yea, grandma’s death came
as such a shock to the whole family, and we all
really appreciate you’re being so understand-
ing.” Is this really what the world is coming
to?

The website of course claims it is for enter-
tainment use only. If this is true, why would it
sell a funeral service program? How depraved
would someone have to be to pay $25 to receive
a funeral service program as a joke? I think that
person would have to be about as depraved as
someone who would actually use it to get time
off work.

Additionally, one of the founders stated in
an interview that “if employers would treat
people the way they need to be treated, people
wouldn’t be using these notes.” If this was all
an elaborate joke, why would the founder say
this in an interview?

Naturally, the owners refused to reveal the
amount of money that their sick enterprise
earns but stated that each month the website
has approximately 15,000 hits. Hopefully, the
vast majority of these are from people like me
who cannot believe such a business would even

 

we would do that, and call it — I don’t even know what
we’d call it — running around on the turf ﬁeld like fools,
maybe. It’s the newest sensation that’s sweeping the
nation!

Perhaps there’s some other purpose that we don’t
know about. Apparently the winners of the league get
to go to Maryland over Thanksgiving Break and play
in the regional ﬂag football championships. Apparent-
ly, they play this emasculated version of “football” at
these “championships.”

If I had a choice between going to Maryland to
play “football” for Thanksgiving and going home for
Thanksgiving and being with my family, I believe I’d
choose my family. In fact, I’d choose my family over
real football.

What’s worse, the officials can’t enforce these
rules. They’re trying their best, but there is such irrita-
tion about the rules amongst the teams that whenever
anyone is touched on the ﬁeld and no flag is forthcom-
ing, a whining starts up the likes of which haven’t been
heard since the Israelites traversed the Sinai.

It honestly sounds like a couple of 8-year-olds in
the back of a car.

“DAAAD! He touched me!”

“Yeah, well, she touched me ﬁrst!”

“Yeah, well, he looked at me funny!”

And the poor person who has to be the adult in this
situation, the ofﬁcial, has no recourse but to ﬁnally
shout the equivalent of “If I have to stop this car, God
help you both!” They don’t get paid enough to stand out
in the cold and put up with our crap, crap that wouldn’t
be forthcoming had it not been for the ridiculousness
of these rules.

Nevertheless, we whine at the officials. Why? Frus-
tration in football is meant to be taken out by hitting
someone on the ﬁeld. Frustration will come out, and
since it won’t come out on the line of scrimmage, it
comes out of competitors’ mouths toward the unde-
serving ofﬁcials.

The IM ofﬁce fails to understand that it is subject to
the free market. IM ﬂag football is a product that caters
to two markets. The ﬁrst market is people looking to
play football. The second market is people looking to
make an extra buck by ofﬁciating.

The ﬁrst market is surely irritated with the prod-
uct, and I have heard the “news on the street” that the
groups that participate in ﬂag football will set up their
own alternative product next year, if the rules package
is not reversed.

The second market is being infected with the irrita-
Lion of the ﬁrst market. lfl were an oilicrui, and l l.;~.d
to deal with the whining teams, I wouldn’t do it beyond

 first night. Suddenly, IM ﬂag for‘-tbill is without
players and without ofﬁcials.

When the IM ofﬁce decided to stick its hand in the
machinery, we ended up with a product 1000 times
worse than before.

I challenge the IM ofﬁce to give me a good reason
why the rules were changed. Getting the opportunity
to go to Maryland over Thanksgiving Break does not
count. If the IM office cannot produce that reason, then
it would be wise of it to reverse the rules package for
next season. Otherwise, IM ﬂag football is dead at
W&L.

In Miller High Life beer commercials, a delivery-
man for Miller High Life enters establishments that he
feels are disrespecting the common man by charging
eight dollars for a can of tuna or, my personal favorite,
eleven-ﬁfty for a hamburger. Because of this affront
to society, he removes all the Miller High Life from
the establishment and says something to the effect of
“l1.50 for a hamburger! You must be crazy! You just
lost your right to sell the High Life.” It varies from
commercial to commercial.

Football without contact? You must be crazy! If the
IM ofﬁce doesn’t at least offer a good explanation (and
even that might not be good enough), then I’m afraid
that they just lost their right to run the football league.

Sincerely,

Sam Gilleran, 2011

Rudy’s ‘problem

Do not compromise on abortion beliefs‘

By Chris Tutor
STAFF WRITER

“Gutsy.” “Nuanced.” “Cen-
trist.” Such is Rudy Giuliani’s
position on abortion proclaimed
by many pundits. “America’s
Mayor” has repeatedly claimed
that he personally opposes abor-
tion, but (and it is a big “but”) he
also opposes the imposition of his
values on other Americans.

During the ﬁrst GOP debate at
the Ronald Reagan Public Library
on May 3, Giuliani stated, “I hate
abortion; I would council against
it. But as a matter of conscience, I
would have to support a woman’s
right to choose.” Weeks later,
during the party’s June 5 debate
in Manchester, New Hampshire,
Giuliani declared, “My view on
abortion is that it’s wrong but that
ultimately, government should
not be enforcing that decision on
a woman.”

Obviously, slavery violates an
individual’s right to liberty, one
explicitly enshrined in the Dec-
laration. However, before the
Civil War, many Southerners
maintained that it was not the
place of abolitionists to impose
their values on other Americans.
They maintained that individu-
als should be allowed to choose
whether or not they owned slaves.
Today, such a defense would be
considered unconscionable. But
isn’t that essentially equivalent to
the position offered by Giuliani?
If one believes that abortion
violates an individual’s right
to life, he or she should defend
that right even if others disagree.
Surely, lack of consensus does
not nullify the right or preclude
the defense of it. Again, this is
not a question of the imposition
of moral values. It is a question
of the protection of unalienable

Southerners before the Civil War maintained

that individuals should be allowed to choose

whether or not they owned slaves. Today, such

a defense would be considered unconscionable.
 

Although lauded by many,
Giuliani’s position is, simply put,
illogical. This is not intended to
question his intelligence or char-
aeter, only the validity of his po-
sition. First, Giuliani states that
he hates abortion and that it is
wrong. Simultarirw-sly. he ""-
gues that the government cannot
defend the right to life because
of a woman’s right to choose. It
is one thing to believe that a fe-
tus is not an individual and. thus,
does not possess the right to life
“endowed by [the] Creator.” That
is a completely respectable posi-
tion and entails no contradiction.
But Giuliani, in his own words
and their obvious implications,
believes otherwise. Therein lies
the problem.

This inconsistency is derived
from Giuliani’s mistake of con-
fusing the imposition of values
with the protection of rights. Val-
ues (i.e. morals) lack consensus.
However, the belief in unalien-
able rights and the equality of
men enjoys almost complete con-
sensus. Most, if not all, Ameri-
cans subscribe to such a belief.
Indeed, it is the most fundamen-
tal unit of our social contract.
Surely, Giuliani believes that the
government is obligated to pro-
tect those rights. Therefore, how
can the right to choose supersede
the right to life? It is illogical.

Let us construct an analogy.

rights. In fact, the Declaration
states emphatically, “That to se-
cure these rights, Governments
are instituted among Men.” In-
deed, it is bold for Giuliani to dis-
agree with the anti-abortion base
of the Republican Party. It would
be bolder for him to stand by his
convictions concerning abortion.

Senator Charles Sumner, the
audacious abolitionist from Mas-
sachusetts once noted of the slav-
ery issue, “This will not admit of
compromise. To be wrong on this
is to be wholly wrong. We must
defend freedom unreservedly and
careless of the consequences.”
Sumner chose to ﬁght for the un-
alienable rights of slaves, whether
it was an imposition on the values
of the South or not. He believed
that a slave’s right to liberty su-
perseded a slaveholder’s right
to choose. His position was not
popular. It was not nuanced. It
was certainly not centrist.

Thus, it might be popular to
ignore the right to life in defer-
ence to the right to choose. Giu-
liani has received much positive
press on his position. But legiti-
macy is not conferred by popular-
ity, and boldness is not a replace-
ment for reason. Giuliani should
reconcile his currently conﬂicting
beliefs. Now that would be gutsy.
It would also be right.

Redford disappoints

Lions for Lambs both title and impression of new ﬁlm

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

Robert Redford usually makes
good ﬁlms.

Sure, Redford ﬁlms are typi-
cally on the subdued side — you
won’t get action-packed thrill-
ers or over the top performances
with Sundance behind the lens.

For that matter, many of his
movies are just the opposite of
loud. The Horse Whisperer or A
River Runs Through It are practi-
cally case studies in great movies
that require very little dialogue.

Maybe that’s why Lions for
Lambs, Redford’s latest, might
seem a little out of its element-
it’s a “talky” ﬁlm. No, seriously,
the whole thing feels like a lec-
ture.

The movie essentially follows
three different plot lines, occur-
ring more or less concurrently
across the globe.

At an unnamed California
university, Redford’s college pro-
fessor is attempting to motivate a
talented and bright but lazy stu-
dent. Professor Redford’s mo-
tivation stems from the fact that
he had earlier inspired two other
talented students (Derek Luke &
Michael Peﬁa) into enlisting in
the US Army to do some good in
Afghanistan.

Enter the second plot line
— Peﬁa and Luke’s soldiers fall
out of their under-ﬁre helicopter
and are stranded in the Afghani
mountains. The Taliban are clos-
ing in quickly. Things aren’t too
chipper.

Meanwhile, back in D.C.,
Senator Jasper Irving (Tom
Cruise, of all people) is trying to
sell reporter Janine Roth (Meryl
Streep) on a new military strate-
gy for Afghanistan. Irving, inci-
dentally, is a Republican favorite
to run for the Presidency.

Given the three stqry lines,

the movie starts with deﬁnite zeal
and interesting scenes. The three

plots have great potential of inter- I

twining and informing each other
in breathtaking, thrilling twists.

But, after about 30 minutes,
the audience realizes that’s prob-
ably not going to happen. Strap
yourself in folks, you’ve got a lot
of talking to listen to.

It’s not that Redford, Streep,
Cruise, Peﬁa and Luke don’t try—
valiantly. Streep ﬂexes every Os-
car-winning muscle she can think
of to infuse her reporter character
with more than one dimension.
Alas, even she falls short, leaving
us with the image of Meryl Streep
sitting, scribbling on a note-pad

factthat he spends most of the
ﬁlm simply talking. A college
professor is expected to lecture,
so his performance ﬁts. But be-
cause it is just a lecture, it’s not
what most would call compel-
ling.

That, more than anything, is
the ﬁlm’s ﬂaw—~nothing hap-
pens. Allthe technical elements
that support the script and perfor-
mances are ﬁne. It is the script
that is the problem. It’s just so
damn. . .talky.

Filming an ofﬁce-hours debate
in the C-school on Bush’s foreign
policy would have just about as
much plot momentum. There
would be compelling ideas, sure,

and clucking at Cruise—a pretty
bland reporter.

Cruise also looks trapped in
ﬁrst gear. Jasper Irving, as the
earnest politician who believes
he’s doing the right thing (and
probably isn’t), could have been
one of the great characters of this
year, ‘a case study of what it’s
like to be a Bush, a Cheney, or a
Rumsfeld. Instead, the audience
gets a performance from Cruise
that he apparently wasn’t fully
committed to. He pretends to be
the Bushian Republican, but he
won’t let you forget that he’s only
pretending. He doesn’t want to
completely give in to the role.

Redford, however, acts well
and creates the most multi-di-
mensional character in the ﬁlm.
Yet, his acting can’t change the

but not compelling ﬁlmmaking.

It’s a shame.

The ﬁlm’s title comes from
a quote attributed to a German
soldier during World War I. The
soldier was praising the courage
of his British Army opponents,
saying that their courage, valor
and bravery only made their of-
ﬁcers’ disastrous waste of their
lives more horrible. It was lions
being led by lambs.

In many ways, Redford aptly
named his ﬁlm—for all potential
and promise the ﬁlm’s concept
presented, its script criminally
wasted it.

Redford’s directorial skill, a
cast chocked to the rafters with
talent, poignant timing—it’s all
cinematic lions for lambs.

Goodman scores a layup against VMI in a preseason scrimmage.

Baller turned “SAACer”

Junior Isaiah Goodman was selected to serve on the NCAA SAAC

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDl_TOR

Before this year, Washington and Lee
did not have a campus Student—Athlete
Advisory Committee, much less a repre-
sentative on the national Student-Athlete
Advisory Committee. This year, both
of those are changing thanks to junior
Isaiah Goodman, a business major from
Minneapolis, Minnesota, who is captain
of W&L’s basketball team.

“I wanted to join the national SAAC
because I thought I could provide valu-
able feedback to the NCAA,” said Good-
man. “I thought it would be a great expe-
rience to meet athletes from around the
country and share ideas and thoughts.”

Last spring, Goodman was nominated
to serve on the national SAAC.

“Last spring I was nominated by Ian A

Rosman and thought nothing of it until
I returned on campus,” said Goodman
when asked about the selection process.
“We assumed that I had not been select-
ed and I was excited to start the campus
SAAC. I later received a phone call and
was notiﬁed that I was a ﬁnal candidate
for the national SAAC.”.

The selection process is quite lengthy.
After the selections are received, the
NCAA committee ‘administration staff
compiles the nominee information and

forwards it to the Division III SAAC
for review. Then the Division III SAAC
forwards its recommendations to the
Nominating Committee for approval.
Afterward, the Nominating Commit-
tee forwards the recommendation to the
Management Council for approval and
to the President’s Council for ratiﬁca-
tion. Finally, appointees are notiﬁed by
the committee administration staff and
are provided NCAA travel policies and
access to the online Committee Appoint-
ment Acceptance Form.

Goodman represents the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference and Middle
Atlantic States Conference as one of 22
members of the NCAA SAAC. He will
serve until his term concludes in Sep-
tember 2010.

As a member of the national SAAC,
Goodman will offer his perspective on a
number of issues in Division III athletics,
including rules, regulations and policies.

“The national SAAC serves as sort ‘of
a funnel for the student-athlete opinions
from each institution. 1 will attend three
national meetings thoughout the year,
and I will continually provide feedback
to all channels about any surveys, legis-
lation or issues that come about.”

In addition to serving on the national
committee, Goodman is also playing an

active role in the creation of the SAAC
here on campus.

“For several years W&L has used
SAMs in order to perform the typi-
cal duties a campus SAAC would do,”
said Goodman. “It worked well until the
NCAA required all institutions to have a
campus SAAC. So, we’ve had one for a
while, but now we have the ofﬁcial title,
and the Campus SAAC will specialize in
its duties, and the SAMS will specialize
in their areas of interest.”

Goodman is one of the inaugural
committee members here on campus
that will help shape its mission. He cur-
rently serves as the chair of the constitu-
tion committee that is working to lay the
framework for the future. His vision for
the committee is far reaching. (

“I hope to establish SAAC as a legiti-
mate organization on campus. It is not
just another resume builder, it can actu-
ally enhance the lives of student-athletes
at W&L. I would like to see SAAC get
W&L athletics more involved in com-
munity service efforts and promote
events and activities that have not been
traditionally done on campus.”

“I think it is very special to be able
to participate in the National SAAC and
bring that experience back to a newly
formed campus SAAC.”

nine of 11 results behind a 0ne—tw0-
three Sweep in the 400 medley relay

ning relays. All told, twelve different swimmers ﬁnished the
meet with at least one ﬁrst place ﬁnish. '

On Saturday, the women crusied to another victory against
an overmatched Bryn Mawr College team winning 89-6. Gettys-
burg, however, proved to be much more of a challenge.

Gettysburg jumped out to a fast start, winning the ﬁrst eight
events before junior Lindsey Strachan took ﬁrst in the 200 back-
stroke in a time of 2: 13.39. Strachan also teamed up with Miata,
junior Susan Mahoney, and sophomore Jenna Worsham to take
second in the 400 medley relay.

The men had just one meet this week, facing Gettysburg on
Saturday, but made the most of it by winning nine of 11 events,
including both relays and the ﬁrst four events of the contest. It
was another total team effort with no swimmer tallying more
than one individual victory. ,

The opening event, the 400 medley relay, was a strong indica-
tion of things to come when the Generals swept ﬁrst, second, and
third place, giving them a 17-0 lead after the ﬁrst event. The team
of senior Even Fitzgeral, sophomores, lan Childers and Brandon
Bamds, and freshman Brandon Wilder won in a time of 3:45.03.
Wilder held off a late charge by senior Alex Sweet who swam the
anchor leg for the second place relay, winning by less than six
tenths of a second.

In the 400 free relay the team of senior Joe Steiner, fresh-
man Ryan Elsey, sophomore Nick Talluri, and Sweet came from
behind to win the ﬁnal event of the day. Sweet, swimming the
anchor leg, entered the pool over two seconds behind Gettys-
burg’s Adam Taft but completed the leg in 46.74 seconds to win
the event by less than three tenths of a second. It was an espe-
cially satisfying victory because earlier in the meet, Taft had out
touched Sweet in the 200 backstroke by the same margin to win
that event.

The women improved to 4-3, including 2-0 in conference,
with their performances this week while the men continued their
undefeated season, improving to 4-0. Both teams return to action
next Saturday when they travel to Pittsburg, Pennsylvania to take
on host Carnegie Mellon, Rochester, and Franklin and Marshall

Football closes year with  

loss in Pittsburgh

Team» ﬁnishes year at-2.5-3’-"While compiling a 4-2 mark in ODA C play

By Brian Devine
STAFF EDITOR

This was supposed to be the
season. All the pieces seemed
to be in place. A young and tal-
ented quarterback who gained
valuable experience when
thrust into the starting role in
his freshman year. A bruising
every-down running back to
wear down opposing defenses.
A smothering pass defense
to hold off opponents’ come-
backs. Despite the early-season
promise, this football season
was a disappointment, marred
by inconsistency and failure to
execute on the road and in big
games.

The Washington and Lee
Generals turned in what the
Europeans call “a yo-yo cam-
paign” -- up and down, losses
following wins, no consistency.
Picked second in the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference by
its coaches and ranked 25th in
the nation by D3football.com in
the preseason, the Boys in Blue
failed to live up to expectations,
ﬁnishing third in a vastly im-
proved conference.

Last season the Generals did
just what they needed to do,
losing only once in the confer-
ence — at defending champions
Bridgewater — and inspired a
revival of fan support that had
lagged for at least a decade. The
conference’s traditional pow-
ers, Hampden-Sydney and Ran-
dolph-Macon, ﬁnished fourth
and last, respectively, in the ﬁ-
nal table.

To put it simply, they’re
back. The two faced off on Sat-
urday in the 113th edition of
“The Game” — a winner take all
match that handed the confer-
ence title to the visiting H-SC
Tigers.

On the same day, W&L, ﬁn-
ished with its conference sched-
ule and mathematically incapa-
ble of winning the title, lost to
Camegie-Mellon 39-21 in Pitts-
burgh. It marked the ﬁrst time
the squads have met since 1960
and just the third time overall.

MICHAEL KEENAN / Sports Editor

The Generals celebrate the final first down in the history of Wilson Field
against Bridgewater. The gutsy call to go for it on fourth down rather than
punting paid dividends as the Generals got the first, allowing them to kneel
down to run out the rest of the clock, sealing their 17-14 victory over Bridge-

water.

The game served as an oddly
appropriate cap to the Gener-
als’ season as it gave the team

. the chance both to look towards

the future and to send off its
senior class. Freshman Patrick
Rouse received the lion’s share
of the snaps from the quarter-
back position, replacing sopho-
more R.J. Vamer in the second
quarter. Rouse showed promise
(117 yards, one touchdown) but
also the need for his continued
development (three intercep-
tions). Aside from Rouse, the
squad looked to its departing
senior class for leadership. The
class’s overall four-year record
now stands at 26-14, tied for the
third-best four-year record in
the program’s history.

One senior made an espe-
cially signiﬁcant contribution
in Pittsburgh. Fan favorite wide
receiver Jack Martin, who was
averaging just over ﬁve catches
per game this season, snagged
eleven passes to bring his career
total to 167, a school record.

Martin surpassed another fan
favorite, 2007 graduate Colton

Ward, who totaled 161. With
his 108 yards receiving and one
touchdown on the day, “J -Mart”
will also graduate as the Gener-
als’ all-tirne leader in receiving
yards (2,953) and touchdowns
(23) and is certainly one of the
ﬁnest football players to ever
wear the Blue and White.

The Generals defense, re-
turning nine starters from last
year, seemed poised to dominate
opposing offenses. At times the
squad played at their potential,
shutting down Guilford quarter-
back Josh Vogelbach, already
among D-I1I’s all time most
productive QBs with a year left
to play. At times they looked
like a sieve, allowing 45 points
at Hampden-Sydney. Safety
Kyle Luby, another senior, de-
servedly won the team’s annual
Falcon Award, honoring former
Coach Gary Fallon, ﬁnishing
the season with a team-high
84 tackles. Luby and ﬁve other
seniors will graduate as the pil-
lars of a defense that showed
ﬂashes of brilliance but did not
improve on pace with the rest of

the ODAC.

What, then, can we take
away from the 2007 season?
Ultimately it is that W&L has
a short memory. Just ﬁve years
ago a third place ﬁnish and a
fourth consecutive winning re-
cord would have been cause for
celebration.

But last season’s title and
the accompanying expectations
for this season set the Blue and
White up for disappointment.

Had the Generals beaten
Hampden-Sydney four weeks
ago they would be sharing in
the ODAC title right now. In-
stead, the lasting image of this
season will be bulldozers on
Wilson Field, a stadium that
needs a serious upgrade.

Perhaps as we rebuild our
program’s longtime home, the
Boys in Blue will rebuild them-
selves into a more consistently
competitive side. To challenge
the conference’s new power-
houses, as they say, all the piec-
es will have to fall into place.

Women take third, men place third at cross country regionals at CN U

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s cross coun-
try teams sprinted through Williamsburg
Saturday as they competed in the NCAA
South/Southeast Regional meet. The

women ﬁnished at a strong third out of

twenty-eight teams while the men took
fourth out of twenty-one teams.

The women were once again led by the
duo of sophomore Kat Telfeyan and junior
Becca Taylor who ﬁnished ninth in a time
of 23:32 and tenth in a time of23:33, re-
spectively.

These ﬁnishes qualiﬁed both Telfeyan
and Taylor for Nationals.

“Sometimes when you stand at the line,
with your teammates all around you, wait-
ing for the gun to go off, you just know it
is going to be a good race,” said Taylor.
“Saturday felt like that.”

“I’m very excited to be going Nation-
als; it’s a great opportunity to race at that
level of competition” commented Telf-
eyan.

The women also had some very
strong runs from junior Elizabeth Webb
and freshman Christine Balistreri. Webb
crossed the ﬁnish line in a time of24:03 to

take fourteenth, while Balistreri ﬁnished
thirty-third with a time of 24:54. These
are high rankings considering the ﬁeld of
186 runners.

Telfeyan concluded, “Our team had
been looking forward to Regionals all
year. We had hoped to beat Trinity for a
second place and guaranteed trip to na-
tionals, but they raced hard and almost
ﬁnished ﬁrst. I was very proud of the
team; we had 3 people in the top ﬁfteen,
and we blew away Mary Washington and
Roanoke, which was nice since we only
beat Roanoke by a point at ODACS.”

Meanwhile, the men were once again
led byjunior Michael Welsh who ﬁnished
in a stunning ﬁfth place out of 170 run-
ners after completing the course in a time
of 26:09, and qualifying for Nationals. Ju-
nior Vance Berry ran a time of 26:43 to
take seventeenth while senior Tom Brow-
er ﬁnished nineteenth in a time of 26:52.

Welsh spoke about making Nation-
als, saying, “This is something I’ve been
trying to accomplish for over two years.
Words can’t describe how amazing it feels
for all the miles, time, and sacriﬁces to
pay off in such a big way.”

And Welsh’s work has not gone un-
noticed by his teammates. “The day...

belonged to Michael Welsh. He ran an
amazing race to get ﬁfth and qualify for
nationals. The team couldn’t be happier
for him. There isn’t a more deserving guy
out there” commented Brower.

Berry went on to say, “Michael Welsh
put forth a surreal performance to take
ﬁfth place individually. He won’t tell you
this himself, but this guy is a stud.”

Overall, the team did very well. “Re-
gionals was one of the most important
meets of the season for us” explained
Brower. “We were ranked sixth in the re-
gion coming into Saturday, but we knew
with the right race we could get fourth or
ﬁfth, so this is an outstanding way to end
the season. This was our highest ﬁnish at
Regionals since 2004.”

Berry attributes much of the team’s
success to the coach. “Immense praise is
due [to] our coach John Tucker. I attribute
the lion’s share of this team’s success to
his calculated training plan and constant
encouragement.”

Welsh, Telfeyan and Taylor will all au-
tomatically compete at the NCAA Cham-
pionships on Saturday, which will be

Lexington City Council will meet Thurs-
day night to discuss the future of the Jordan’s
Point dam. The dam’s future has been uncer-
tain since Charles Volpe, a 16-year-old student
of Rockbridge County High School, drowned
there in April 2006.

If the city decides to remove the dam, the
normally still water near the Pole Houses may
once again become a ﬂowing river.

Since Lexington opened Jordan’s Point
Park, the tiny island has become a popular
hangout and swimming hole for students of all
kinds. Local high school students, Keydets,
law students and W&L undergrads have all
enjoyed a spring afternoon at the park.

Now the park'has a new feature — a me-
morial garden built in honor of Volpe, who
drowned beneath the park’s dam on April 23,
2006.

“I had the idea to do something when Mr.
Volpe and Mrs. Volpe said they never wanted
Charles to be forgotten,” Dylan Fitzgerald, a
Rockbridge County High freshman, said.

Fitzgerald erected the garden as part of his
Eagle Scout project.

Fitzgerald moved a bench inscribed with
Volpe’s name and one of his favorite sayings
to a spot that over looks the dam. He also
planted a birch tree and will add more plants
when spring comes.

The saying seems to capture the way Volpe

   
  
 
 
  
   
 
   
  
  
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
  
   
  
  
    
  
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
 
   
 
 
   
  
 
   
  
 

   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
   
  
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
   

 

What is legal.

Alum reﬂects on his time advising
Bush about terror war is legal limits

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

Jack Goldsmith, W&L Class of 1984,
spent ten months as assistant attorney gener-
al, giving legal counsel to the White House on
issues from counterterrorism to Guantanamo
Bay in 2003 and 2004. When asked wheth-
er he would do it again, Goldsmith said, “I
might ﬂip a coin.” He spoke at Washington
and Lee last Monday on his experiences.

Goldsmith graduated summa cum laude
from W&L in 1984, earned B.A. and M.A.
degrees at Oxford and later attended’ Yale
Law School. In 2003, while working for
the Defense Department, Goldsmith was
called to the White House for an interview
with Alberto Gonzales, the President Bush’s
legal counselor. Weeks later, Goldsmith was
sworn in as the assistant attorney general.

As head of the Oﬂice of Legal Counsel,

dent have been restricted by criminal laws,
meaning that a violation of those laws is
punishable with a prison sentence. Bush
and his cabinet needed to know just how far
they could go in the “War on Terror” without
breaking the law.

Goldsmith was in the uncomfortable posi-
tion of telling the president (through Gonza-
les) what he could and could not do. When
the Bush administration pushed against the
law, Goldsmith had to push back.

Towards the end of his term, Goldsmith
was exhausted and fed up with the secrecy
and unilateral decision-making within the
White House. The Bush administration was
making decisions without expert advice,
Goldsmith said. He believes that the Presi-
dent should have been working more closely
with Congress. Instead, Bush took the “go-
it-alone approach” and thereby lost a lot of
trust.

“The central irony is, the agenda to expand presidential

power will end up weakening the presidency in the foresee-

able future. ”

Jack Goldsmith, former Asslstant Attorney General and 1984 alum
 

Goldsmith determined whether certain exec-
utive actions were lawful. In his ﬁrst eight
weeks he was briefed on various counterter-
rorism operations for which the president
would need approval. In time, Goldsmith
came to the conclusion that the opinions of
his predecessors, in support of these actions,
were “deeply ﬂawed.”

“It began to dawn on me that I could
not. .. stand by or reaﬁirm these opinions” he
writes in his book, “The Terror Presidency.”

Goldsmith spoke in Lee Chapel on Mon-
day to an audience of students, professors
and local residents. He argued that the pres-
idency is torn between two fears — fear of

attack and fear of the law. After September ,

11, Goldsmith explained, the White House
tried everything possible to prevent another
terrorist attack. There was the sense that a
second attack would be blamed on the presi-
dent. “They pushed against the law, feeling
that they had to go right to the line,” Gold-
smith said.

At the same time, there was the fear of
pushing too hard and crossing the line.
Since the 1970s, the war powers of the presi-

“The central irony is, the agenda to ex-
pand presidential power will end up weaken-
ing the presidency in the foreseeable future,”
Goldsmith said.

Politics Professor Rob Strong agreed with
Goldsmith’s analysis, and added, “We’re go-
ing to be living with this kind of threat for
a very long time.” It will be up to ﬁiture
presidents, he said, to balance civil liberties
with the need to address threats.

After the talk, a reception was held in
the Alumni House. Goldsmith chatted with
members of the audience and elaborated on
his earlier points. Several members of the
audience waited to have their copies of “The
Terror Presidency” signed. Attendants felt
like they were standing in the presence of a
dignitary. K

But Goldsmith is just an ordinary man
who has experienced an extraordinary career.
He now teaches law at Harvard University,
which is a welcome change after the arduous
schedule that kept him away from his wife
and sons. “It was a painful experience” he
said, but he was grateful to have learned so
much from it. ‘

US. must reach out

Expert on Islam says peace won ’t come unless dialogue improves

By Joel Poelhuis
STAFF WRITER

Ambassador Akbar Ahmed, rec-
ognized by the BBC as “the world’s
leading authority on contemporary
Islam,” spoke at W&L last Wednes-
day night in Lee Chapel. In a speech
ﬁlled with hope but grounded in se-
rious realism, Ahmed told attending
students, professors and area resi-
dents that building bridges between
the Islamic world and the United
States is essential to global welfare
in the 21st century. Ahmed’s speech
served as the third event in an ongo-
ing Middle East series sponsored by
W&L student organization Contact.

Ahmed revealed that the U.S. is
perceived by Muslims as conduct-
ing an active attack on Islam. These
tensions fuel a rising anti-American
sentiment and give credence to ex-
tremists. The solution to the conﬂict,
according to Ahmed, is a three-part
process in which the West must take
the lead. The cost of not taking action
could drain U.S. resources in expen-
sive foreign wars while destroying
the chance for development in Islam-
ic countries. This situation, Ahmed
claims, would prevent the US from
focusing on other world priorities
where its leadership is badly needed.

The ﬁrst step is to do away with
a retaliatory mindset and instead, ad-
dressing the underlying causes of the
conﬂict. America’s current “war on
terror” has a blinding effect, which
Ahmed warns could be counterpro-

ductive to its long term goals. Us-
ing Pakistan as an example, Ahmed
showed how US. foreign policy has
shifted from promoting democracy to
forging short-term military alliances
for strategic value. These alliances,
claims Ahmed, are not as beneﬁcial
to development of U.S.-Muslim rela-
tions because they are heavily contin-
gent on U.S. military aid and may not
have the overall support of the popu-
lace. Foreign aid sent to governments
of this type often turns up in military
form, which destabilizes rather than
develops a region.

Dialogue is Ahmed’s second step
and one he is personally familiar
with. He consistently meets with
leaders in other faiths and works to
promote inter-faith discussion and is
a trustee of the World Faiths Develop-
ment Dialogue. Ahmed places great
importance on the status of Abraham
as the root of the Jewish, Christian,
and Muslim faiths and painted reli-
gion as a conduit which could lead
to greater cultural and political un-
derstanding. Symbolism is crucial
in Ahmed’s plan for dialogue. For
example, when President George W.
Bush visited a mosque shortly after
the attacks of 9/ I 1, the Muslim world
reacted positively. Ahmed said ac-
tions like this are important in build-
ing credibility for open dialogue.
Ahmed also desires greater maturity
in the Muslim world, especially the
ability to maintain composure when
faced with a different opinion. The
difficulty with this value, Ahmed

claims, is that “the majority of the
Muslim world is young, illiterate, and
unemployed,” a recipe for trouble in
any belief system.

This lack of education and op-
portunity is one of the problems that
lead to the ascendancy of Muslim lit-
eralists or fundamentalists over more
moderate modernists. Ahmed rec-
ommends direct funding of education
and infrastructure development as a
way to combat extremist views of the
U.S. This paves the way for dialogue
and opens the door to challenging ex-
tremist views with textual evidence
from the Quran.

The goal of these steps is friend-
ships between individuals in the
Islamic world and the U.S. When
personal friendships exist, political
differences will not disappear, but
will be dealt with in a more mutually
beneﬁcial way, according to Ahmed.

Neil Scheaffer, co-chair of Con-
tact, said the current series on the
Middle East has boosted attendance
of Contact events.

“We wanted to take a relevant top-
ic and approach it from a number of
different angles,” Scheaffer said.

Ahmed’s speech was co-sponsored
by the W&L Religion department,
which Scheaffer said helped create a
strong base of support for promotion
and attendance.

The next speaker in the Spotlight
on the Middle East series will be
General Anthony Zinni on March
6th speaking on “War in the Middle
East.”

QEP project update

The Quality Enhancement
Plan committee is moving for-
ward in its efforts to select one
idea that would improve life at
Washington and Lee. .

The project is part of W&L’s
re-accreditation efforts. Junior
Rich Cleary said the committee is
now seeking input on 11 ideas.

The top three ideas will even-
tually be presented to the provost,
and one idea will evenually be
implemented.

The ideas are as follows:

1. Freshmen seminar: This pro-
posal would expand the cur-
rent freshman seminars so
they could be open to all
freshmen. Another option
would use the seminar to help
freshmen with the transition

to college.

2. Student intellectual life: This
idea could enhance out—of-
classroom ideas to improve
intellectual life.

3. Academic life: Help implement
the newly approved academic
life plan, with a focus on de-
veloping innovative courses
for the 4-week spring term.

4. Service learning: Focus on
making connections between
academic objectives and real
world issues.

5. Sustainability: A focus on elim-
inating or offsetting W&L’s
climate-changing emissions.

6. I Program: Students would
participate in one of three
“I”s: Independent research,
international study, or an eight

week internship.

7. Information ﬂuency: Focus on
helping faculty and students
use technology to ﬁnd data
and conduct research. Also
encourage students to share
research they have complet-
ed.

8. International education: This
plan envisions using winter
and spring terms to encour-
age language students to take
intensive classes and study
abroad. .

Comedian gets a laugh wherever he goes

Mary Washington student Watt Smith tries to break through, build his career

By Carson Haddow
snrr warren

Watt Smith is another one of
those funny guys. The brother of
a current W&L senior, Watt was
invited to perform a stand up
comedy routine in the Stackhouse
Theater on Tuesday. To give an
idea of Watt’s general atmosphere
it would do well to consider his
simpleton philosophy: “If I took
it too serious, I would cry after
every show.” Kind of a live life as
it comes mentality — oh and try to
laugh as much as possible.

Watt was born in Richmond
and is now at Mary Washington
University in Fredericksburg, at
least when he’s not on a semi-pro-
fessional joke tour in D.C. or Vir-
ginia. He started telling jokes for
fun and publicly in high school,

lived his life: “Live to love, love
to live, no regrets.” —

The crowning touch of the gar-
den is a piece of limestone that
Fitzgerald and Volpe’s parents
moved from the family’s prop-
erty.

Workers at Hamric Memorials,
donated their time and carved the
same saying onto the stone.

Though Fitzgerald and Volpe
are a few years apart in age, the
two became friends at the 10-
cal skate park. Chuck Volpe,
Charles’s father, said his son
looked out for younger kids at the
park.

"‘It turned out [Charles] liked
to help the younger kids,” Volpe
said. “So I had a lot of these
younger boys that were 12 years
old come up to me after Charles’s
death and say, ‘your son was re-
ally nice to us.’”

Fitzgerald is not the only local
teenager working to keep Volpe’s
legacy alive. Cassie Benson and
Ben.Goldsmith, two former class-
mates of Volpe, have been work-
ing with Chuck Volpe to raise
awareness about the dangers of
dams.

The Jordan’s Point dam is a

of a boom,” said the Basics Group
report. And although Nucor took a
loss during the third quarter, it beat
expectations, leading to a 4.1% rise
in stock.

The group also decided to sell
Kaydon, what they say is the weak-
est stock in their portfolio. Kaydon
manufactures bearings, split-roll
bearings, ﬁltration products, linear
deceleration products and perfor-
mance seals. The machinery indus-
try has been hit hard by the slow
housing market, and the weak dol-
lar also affected the performance of
the company, and it’s unknown how
long it will take for the stock to re-
cover.

of the aforementioned industry group and

vidual acquisitions. Always consult your

ments carry risk. Past results are not nec-
essarily indicative of future performance.

won a joke contest and the ca-
reer was launched. He does plan
to ﬁnish college, at least to make
the parents happy, but then, of
course, he’s on to bigger and bet-
ter things. Watt seems to envision
a life in L.A., moving around get-
ting comedy gigs like a musician.
He says it is tough to ﬁnd work
and pay: “It’s hard to make it as a
comedian,” especially early in the
game. He maintains however that
all he needs is enough for some
food and a place to live. He will
work hard, but he will certainly
have a blast doing what he loves,
Watt, or Walter really, just re-
ally likes making people laugh. It
is always a relief, he says, when
the fear of that awkward, post-
funny silence is evaporated by
the giggles and grins of an at least

“low-head” dam. While these
dams often look unimposing, they
create deadly hydraulic effects.
As water comes over the darn it
re-circulates back to the base of
the dam, trapping anything that
has gone over the dam.

Benson and Goldsmith said
they were shocked to hear that
Charles, who was an expert swim-
mer, had drowned.

“We were really surprised to
hear it because of how comfort-
able he was around the water.”

The two teenagers, along with
Chuck Volpe, worked with Del.
Ben Cline (R-Lexington) to get a
new dam safety law passed in the
Virginia state legislature.

The law urges dam owners to
put signs up warning swimmers
and boaters not to approach the
dam. Owners who put up signs
limit their liability to $25,000
if someone is injured or killed.
Owners who don’t put up signs
risk having to pay much larger
settlements in a lawsuit.

Volpe ﬁled a lawsuit against
the city in September, claiming
that the city was negligent because
it failed to put up signs warning
swimmers of the dangers around
the dam. He is seeking $3.3 mil-
lion in damages.

' The city did put up no trespass-

somewhat attentive audience.

He always tells new jokes; he
writes them before each routine.
It seems like too much work and
stress going into such a funda-
mentally carefree and amusing
pastime. He’s spent nights on end
of working in D.C., standing in
front of people and desperately
bidding for their attention. Watt
takes it easy and just lives life. He
does not really need to “save the
world with laughter,” but rather
he wants simply “to have fun be-
ing funny.”

His comedic technique is to
honestly setup an idea or scene,
and then shock people by giving a
surprising twist in the punch line.
He makes people see a different
viewpoint, and makes them laugh
at it and sometimes their selves.

were no signs in place on the day
Volpe died.

In fact, the city didn’t even
know it owned the dam. Only af-
ter Volpe’s death did city ofﬁcials
discover they had acquired the
dam nearly 70 years ago.

Chuck Volpe initially wanted
to see the dam demolished, but
other local residents didn’t want
to lose the ﬂat stretch of river cre-
ated by the dam.

Now Volpe and City Plarmer
Bill Blatter are discussing an op-
tion that could remove the dam’s
dangers while still preserving the
ﬂat water that boaters and swim-
mers currently enjoy.

Volpe’s plan calls for two dams
to be built upstream of the current
dam, while the current dam would
be partially removed.

The result, Volpe hopes, would
be Class II rapids that boaters
could safely paddle through.

In a way, Volpe hopes his cam-
paign to raise awareness about
these dams will serve as a penna-
nent memorial to his son.

But he’s glad that F itzgerald’s
garden will keep the memory of
his son alive at Jordan’s Point.

Even if you avoid looking like you

By Grace Andrews
STAFF warren

For my last article of this year,
I thought of writing an uplifting,
engaging article, that reminded
us all of the blessings we have
and the purpose of the holiday
season. This article will probably
not be doing any of that.

A few days ago, I was talk-
ing to campus favorite Burr Datz
when I was forced into a paralyz-
ing silence. For those of you who
know me, you all realize what a
great feat this must have been.

What I saw that silenced me
were a pair of khaki pants in the
bookstore window. However,
these pants were no ordinary
slacks, they had blue and white
tridents ALL over. I would guess-
timate that there were at least 30
tridents.

When I ﬁst saw the pants,
I thought that the trident de-
cals were actually sharks. Why
sharks? Well, I assumed that the
pants were Vineyard Vines and
just following the same mold as
the women’s slacks that have ev-
erything from whales and ﬁsh to
palm trees and pineapples.

Just the other day, I saw some-
one wearing shorts that had a
whale and skull and crossbones
pattern. I did not realize that
skulls and whales were the next
dynamic duo. Maybe they were
trying to do a pirate/sea-faring
creature theme? I’m not sure what
was going on but it disturbed me
and shook up my soul up to the
point where I was saying “Ay,
matey.”

I personally do not believe in
having tropical seascapes, insects
or fruit on my clothing. I battled
that decision, but after some soul

 

Abortion: a balancing act  

editor

State shouldn ’t force moral judgments on everyone

This is in reply to Chris Tu-
tor’s article “Rudy’s Problem”
from the Nov. 12 issue of the

‘Ring-Tum Phi. I take Giuliani’s

position to be internally consis-
tent, and here’s why.

As Tutor correctly points out,
there are important rights that
society should protect, and mem-
bers of society should not be left
to choose for themselves whether
to respect these rights or not. In
the United States, there is a shared
value framework to which we can
appeal in negotiating our differ-
ences and identifying the rights
that should be entitled to legal
protection.

An important value we share
is that we should not use the coer-
cive power of the state to enforce
our sectarian views. Suppose,
for example, that my faith for-
bids me to consume intoxicating
substances (such as coffee and
alcohol). Since I live in a society
containing a plurality of religious,
moral and philosophical systems,
I recognize that my reasons for
abstaining are not shared, and
I cannot justiﬁably expect the
state to enforce abstinence for
everyone based on my religious
reasons. The claims of others to
conduct their lives in harmony
with their sectarian value systems
is as strong as my claim to adhere
to my own.

But all reasonable moral sys-
tems in society seem to overlap

searching I’ve just decided that
I don’t support attire that either
makes me hungry, swat at myself
or want to go on a vacation.

After seeing those pants in the
display window, I decided to fur-
ther dissect some of the fashion
on campus. I enjoy nothing more
than fun and funky patterns and
colors on clothes, but sometimes
people make terrible life choices
concerning clothes.

If it is cloudy, drizzling and 40
degrees outside, you should not
wear shorts with a tee, have on
sandals, or be wearing colors so
bright that your reﬂection causes
vision loss.

You know what I’m talking
about. If it looks like a skittle bag
exploded all over your clothes or
when describing the color that
you are wearing, you have to
put the word “neon” in front of
the name, you may want to wait

at certain points, and this over-
lap constitutes our shared value
framework. This common value
system recognizes certain basic
rights, such as the right to life and
security of the person, including
the right to bodily integrity (e.g.,
not to be killed, battered, raped
or tortured) and the right to lib-
erty (including the right not to be
unjustly imprisoned and not to be
enslaved). State coercive power is
used, justiﬁably, to protect these
rights.

Still, basic rights are not abso-
lute. Although all people are en-
titled to their lives and freedom,
there are circumstances under
which some people’s interests in
life or liberty must give way to
others’ corresponding interests.

For example, people can be
imprisoned for committing crimes
and killed under death penalty
statutes in some states.

In some states, such as Virgin-
ia, that society should express its
moral outrage by executing per-
sons convicted of capital crimes
is taken to justify the loss of in-
nocent life on the inevitable oc-
casions when people are wrongly
convicted.

One might disagree about
whether these particular qualiﬁ-
cations to basic rights are justi-
ﬁed, but few argue that no quali-
ﬁcations are justiﬁed. One who
supports an unqualiﬁed right to
life must oppose the death pen-

and wear that color in the spring
— the time of brightly colored
clothes.

Outside of brilliantly blinding
bold colors, the mixing of various
patterns plagues this campus like
a terrible biblical curse. Stripes,
polka dots, checks, etc. are great
to wear but not together. I’ve
seen people on campus put these
varied patterns together, and all it
does is make them look like the
product o_f a zebra and cheetah,
mixed with a candy cane.

Honestly, if someone may get
dizzy looking at all of the de-
signs on your clothes, that outﬁt
may not be the one. Please re-
member, friends don’t let friend
wear plaids with polka dots, just
DON’T do it!

What I ﬁnd interesting about
the fashion choices is that many
of the individuals wearing these
style are trying to be “individu—

alty, even use of deadly force in

self-defense (which would justify

a complete ban on handguns).
Should abortion be legal?

"That depends on which interest

is stronger: a woman’s interest in
autonomy or a fetus’s interest in
being born.

Should slavery be legal‘? That
depends on which interest is stron-
ger: a person’s interest in owning
other people and proﬁting from
their labor, or a person’s interest

People shouldn ’t be
left to choose for
themselves when to
respect others ’ba-

sic rights. What are
these basic rights that
should be protected?

Melina Bell, assistant
professor of philosophy

in liberty and self-govemment.
The slavery question is a very
easy one if we don’t think the ﬁrst
interest is a legitimate one at all.
But many people do not ﬁnd
the legal abortion question easy,
even if they believe the fetus is

als” and have their own style.
The problem occurs when 200 or
more people try to be “individu-
als.”

If everyone is wearing the
same stripped pants with a polka
dot polo, then you have went
from being “different” to “look-
ing like everyone else.” Thus
resulting in a homogenously dif-
ferent campus sense of fashion.
Only at W&L would rebellious
fashion consist of NOT wearing
ﬂorescent colored Polo or a ma-
dras printlskirt. Where I’m from
in western Tennessee, neither of
those options would be thought
kindly upon.

However, I must say that on
most days, the intricate attire and
attention-grabbing garb makes
me smile a big Kool-Aid grin
while chuckling deep in my soul.
I enjoy the efforts made by my
peers to be different while still

a person with full rights like you
or me. Many people who op-
pose legal abortion would make
an exception in cases of rape,
incest and/or when the pregnant
woman‘s life or health is at risk.
In these cases, the fetus is as fully
a person as in other cases.

So there must be a balancing
of important interests that we
value in common that is taking
place, rather than an insistence on
unqualiﬁed rights based on a sec-
tarian view.

Of course people shouldn’t
be left to choose for themselves
when to respect others’ basic
rights. The difﬁcult question is:
What are these basic rights that
should be protected?

Finding the answer requires
us, together as a society, to recog-
nize and evaluate important com-
peting claims and values, offering
each other reasons from within
our shared value system that we
can expect others to recognize.
This is how our shared value sys-
tem expands and develops.

As Giuliani acknowledges,
one value we share is that the co-
ercive power of the state is not to
be used to enforce sectarian moral
judgments but only rights and val-
ues established within our shared
value system.

Sincerely,
Melina Bell

° Friends don’t let friends dress badly

’re headed to vacation, you may be one of the homogenously different

playing it safe since everyone
else is dressed like them.

Tying this article into the holi-
day season, I suggest that if you
have any of the aforementioned
attire in your closet and do not
wear them, donate them to the
Union Mission, Goodwill or an-
other charity of your choice.

Lastly, I implore some of the
W&L student to mix up their
fashion a little and try new things
with next season"s style. I have
no desire to see 50 million people
with the same polo and khaki out-
ﬁt for all of Winter Term or the
same wool dress and pashmina
scarf.

As you do your holiday shop-

No college male in his right mind would hang posters of anyone from Maxim is unsexiest women on their dorm wall

By Kathie Scott
surr WRITER

How would you like to open
up an issue of Maxim to ﬁnd your
name listed as one of the unsexi-
est people in the world? Oh, to be
a celebrity.

Maxim published its very of-
ﬁcial list of the ﬁve unsexiest
females in the world, as follows
(with unsexiest listed at the top):

1. Sarah Jessica Parker
2 Amy Winehouse

3 Sandra Oh

4. Madonna

5 Britney Spears

Now let’s discuss the logic be-
hind this list. Sarah Jessica Parker
is apparently the unsexiest female
in the world. This seems so ironic
because Sarah Jessica Parker is
most commonly referred to as
Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and
the City. Because of this, I ques-
tioned Maxirn’s decision to place

poor Sarah at the top of their list.

But then I thought about it and

ﬁgured out a way to determine if
she is really all that unsexy. Pic-
ture a college male’s dorm room.
Can anyone imagine a poster of
Sarah Jessica Parker hanging
above the bed? Exactly.

So Sarah really isn’t very
sexy. Does she deserve to top the
list? That is arguable. But let’s
continue.

Amy Winehouse. Done. There
really is no explanation neces-
sary for her position on this list.
In case you hadn’t heard anything
about Amy Winehouse recently,
she’s insane. A “recovering” her-
oin and crack addict, Amy Wine-
house made her biggest splash
in celebrity gossip when she and
her husband appeared before the
press bruised and bloody.

Apparently Amy’s husband
saved her life. She was cutting
herself alongside of a call girl
when her husband came in to save
the day. A physical dispute began
that left Amy running out of her

hotel very bloody and bruised,
her husband not too far behind.

Don’t you just hate it when
that happens? I can’t imagine a
poster of Amy Winehouse in her
delicate condition on anyone’s
wall. I personally think she de-
serves the number one spot as
unsexiest female. But maybe
there’s something Maxim knows
that I don’t.

Coming in at number three is
Sandra Oh. The infamous Cris-
tina from the ABC show “Grey’s
Anatomy.” You either love her or
hate her direct and emotionally
detached manner. But either way,
I don’t think she ‘gets many hits
on Google for sexy pictures.

Granted, nowadays every-
body has a sex tape somewhere
or a stack of sordid pictures from
early on in his/her career. None-
theless, Sandra is not a person
I would use to deﬁne sexy. Her
role on “Grey’s Anatomy” may
or may not have pushed her un-

sexy image, but I just think she’s
unattractive.

Number four on Maxim’s list
is Madonna. This is another entry
I don’t quite understand. Madon-
na. deﬁned sexy for a generation
or two when she ﬁrst started her

Madonna has progres-
sively become unsexy
over time. But, hey,

isn ’t that just aging?
 

music career.

Don’t get me wrong, her very
muscular look does make her
look even older than she already
is. She’s never really ﬁxed that
gap between her teeth, though
maybe some ﬁnd it becoming.

Madonna is also a huge diva

(in the bad way). I mean, for one
television broadcast of the Em-
mys, Madonna refused to appear
if she didn’t open although Mari-
ah Carey was the most logical
choice for opener at the time.

And really she has progres-
sively become unsexy over time.
But hey, isn’t that just aging? Is
that really fair? Sandra Oh is just
inherently unsexy. But Madonna
brought sex to music. I don’t like
Madonna very much but I’m not
sure she belongs in this list.

Our last unsexy female is the
Princess of Pop, Britney Spears.
This is another person I will ar-
gue. -

Britney is a mother. She’s not
as toned as she once was. Yes,
she shaved her head. But come
on! Not only did Britney top sexy
charts at one point, but this girl
was really really sexy.

And the true test is that one of
the more popular posters in col-
lege dorms is the enlarged ver-

sion of her on the cover of Roll-
ing Stone magazine. Now we can
all agree that she’s not the same
girl from her boy short underwear
days. And her fall has been quite
significant. But even in her cur-
rent state, I will always remem-
bcr Britney as a sex symbol for
our generation.

And because of that not too
distant memory, I feel Britney
should be removed from the list.
Isn’t it enough that she was stupid
enough to marry Keven Federline
without a prenuptial agreement?
C an‘t we just let her become un-
sexy in peace without calling her
out on it?

All in all, Maxim did a pretty
good job of coming up with an
interesting and somewhat ac-
curate list of unsexy females. I
could argue a case for some of
the placeholders but I’m not ap-
palled by the choices. Good job
Maxim! I’ll be waiting for the list
of unsexiest males.

Busy week for ball

Team starts 0-2 in

The women’s basketball team had a busy week, playing
three games. They went 1-2 facing three tough opponents,
Mary Baldwin, Randolph-Macon and Virginia Wesleyan, a
combined 10-1 coming into the games.

The team started the week Tuesday night against Mary
Baldwin Squirrels. W&L started slow, going down 0-9. At
one point in the ﬁrst half, the deﬁcit was 14. It was look-
ing bleak for the Generals who had yet to post their ﬁrst
win. After a run by W&L to end the ﬁrst, the Generals had
cut the difference to two at half time. The second half was
close and intense. The half featured 11 lead changes and 8
. ‘ ties. With 71 seconds remaining in the game, the score was
tied 59-59. The tie was broken by a lay-up by senior guard
Kristin Krouchick who led the Generals with a season-high
21 points and 9 boards. She added a free throw to make it
62-59, the ﬁnal score. W&L had their ﬁrst victory of the
season. Other Generals also provided strong performances.
Sophomore center Kaitlin Kamp had one of her best games,
tallying a career-high tying 15 points and a season high 7
rebounds. Senior Amanda Kane also scored in double dig-
its. It was an exciting win for the Generals, giving Mary
Baldwin their ﬁrst loss of the season.

Friday, the Generals faced the 22”“ ranked Yellow Jack-
ets of Randol h-Macon. The Yellow Jackets came out
Dr° Sheryl H‘ C3-rls ﬁring from thepbeginning. They shot 55 percent from the
28 Bones Place Lexington, VA 540-463-2715 ﬁeld in the ﬁrst and took an 18-point lead twice in the ﬁrst

' half. They looked like a nationally ranked team. The score

Q was 40-26 coming into half time. After half, the Generals

security issues, committing 22 turnovers in the defeat. Also,
they allowed the Yellow Jackets to get 4 players in double
ﬁgures and shoot over 50 percent. There were some bright
for the Generals, however. Junior guard Bethany Riden-
hour had a season high 16 points and four steals. Freshman
guard Allie Long had a career-high 11.

Saturday, the Generals took on the Virginia Wesleyan
Marlins. The Generals started off strong, building up a sev-
en-point lead with 5:55 to play in the ﬁrst. After this point,
the Generals went cold, and the Marlins went on a massive
run. The Marlins scored 33 of the next 35 points. By the
end of the rtm the score was 50-26. The Generals were able
to chip away at the lead some, but it was not enough. The
game ended in a 17-point victory for the Marlins, 61-44.
This run was the obvious difference in the game. The Gen-
erals controlled the beginning and the end of the game but
just couldn’t stop the bleeding in the middle. W&L again
had turnover problems, committing 20. The team was lead
by Kristin Krouchick’s 15 points with 6 boards. Senior
guard Emily Wolff had 9 points and 6 rebounds

The Generals return to action Tuesday in a 7:00 away
contest against Hollins. .

The Washington and Lee wrestling team traveled to Grantham, Pa., to
take part in the Messiah-Petrofes Invitational this weekend. After two tough
days of wrestling, an undermanned Generals team managed to place 11th out
of 13 teams with just ten wrestlers, compared to 23 for champion Heidelberg
and featured several strong individual efforts. .

“The team did far better than last year,” said junior John Christopher.
“However, everyone still has a good amount of work to do in order to have a
successful dual meet season.”

The Generals were led by Christopher’s third place ﬁnish in the 197-lbs
weight class. Christopher was seeded third started out strong downing Corey
Proscia in the opening round and followed up with a 4-0 decision against
sixth-seeded Mike DiOrico of Oneonta. However, his run through the cham-
pionship bracket was derailed when he was beaten by second-seeded Tyler
Schmidt of Johns Hopkins in the semiﬁnals. However, Christopher rebound-
ed by running the tables in the consolation bracket. He defeated Proscia for
the second time in the tournament and then bested Bill Sholly of Muhlenberg
by a 6-1 decision to claim third place, the highest of any General.

“I feel like I did a solid job but could have done better,” said Christopher
of his performance. “I realized a several things I need to work on and have a
month now to iron them out.” i

The biggest surprise of the tournament for W&L came from senior Kirk
Adamson in the 184-lbs. weight class. Adamson was unseeded but knocked
off sixth-seeded Ed Bizorik of Heidelberg 6-4 in his opening match. He fol-
lowed up with an even bigger upset, defeating third-seeded Matt Horn from
Muhlenberg with a 4-2 decision. That was as far as he would get, Second-
seeded Eric Fishel of Johns Hopkins knocked him into the consolation brack-
et where he lost to Bizorik 3-0 and then to Horn in the 5th place match.

Senior Peter Lawrence provided the only other top eight ﬁnish for the Gen-
erals, wrestling in the 149-lbs. weight class. Lawrence defeated Brockport’s
Pat Fallot in a 12-6 decision and then crushed Evan Kidwell form Messiah .
by a 20-7 major decision. Lawrence came up short against ﬁrst-seeded and
eventual champion Paul LeBlanc from SUNY Cortland. He bounced back by
overpowering Heidelberg’s Frank Dudzik by a 14-3 major decision before
falling to ﬁfth-seeded Zach Mizer of Heidelberg 8-1 and then seventh-seeded
Sean Dreger of Mount Union in the seventh-place match.

The Generals had several other wrestlers record wins though they did
not place. Seniors David Shubeck, Tim Manson, and Anthony Boniello won
two matchs each. Junior Rob Terrin and sophomore Jonathan Brown tallied
a win.

“The Messiah Tournament was a very good gauge of how the team is

Three Generals
run at nationals;

Three of Washington and Lee’s fastest runners
spent their ﬁrst weekend of Thanksgiving break not
gorging themselves on home cooked meals or long
nights of sleep but running in cold Minnesota at the
NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships.
In Northﬁeld, Minnesota, on a freezing morning and
a light dusting of snow on the ground, Junior Mi-
chael Welsh, Junior Becca Taylor, and Sophomore
Kat Telfeyan competed with the top runners in the
country in Division III.

His first time running at Nationals, Welsh ﬁnished
in a time of 26: 10 to place 164th out of 280 runners.
Welsh is a junior and has higher goals for next year.

“I deﬁnitely want to be back at nationals next
year, ideally with some other guys on the team,” said
Welsh. “This year was all about learning how it feels
to race with the big boys. Next year, I’d like to be

opponents Waynesburg, Gettysburg and host Washington and Jefferson.

one of them.”

Meanwhile, Taylor and Telfeyan sported strong
runs in the women’s race. Taylor crossed the ﬁnish
line in 23:56 to claim 235th place out 245 runners.
Telfeyan took l03rd after completing the course in
23:00.

“Nationals was a great experience this year,” com-
mented Telfeyan. “Being in that kind of environment
really encouraged me to run hard. It got me excited
for track and next year’s cross country.”

“The team is only getting better and I think we
will surprise everyone next year,” shared an excited
Telfeyan. V

Three months after the season ofﬁcially began,
the cross country teams have put their shoes away,
though most have now only exchanged them for
track spikes.

STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee men’s
basketball team ended its 30
year losing streak to Randolph-
Macon College by beating them
in overtime as the Generals went
2-! this past week.

1 The Generals lost to the Yel-
low Jackets by one point in their
ﬁnal matchup last year when
now senior captain Greg Biene-
mann missed two free throws
down the stretch. This year, Bi-
enemann got his redemption - he
hit a layup with 1.3 seconds re-

maining in overtime to seal the '

victory.

“What a great feeling— to be
a senior and beat [Randolph-
Macon] for the ﬁrst time in 30
years,” said Bienemann. “Hit-
ting the game-winning shot was
awesome. [I’m] just glad I could
be there for my teammates.”

W&L won the opening tip
and Bienemann scored on a la-
yup, which set the tempo en
route to a 33-point game, tying
his career high. Randolph-Ma-
con immediately responded with
a layup and a subsequent 7-0 run.
However, Bienemann thwarted
the run when he hit a layup on a
pass from fellow senior captain
Femi Kusimo.

The game went back and
forth until Bienemann sparked
the team with 11:45 left in the
ﬁrst half by sinking a shot while
being fouled. This propelled
W&L to a 25-15 lead just two
minutes later and the team ended
the half up by 12, 40-28.

Bienemann opened up the
second half the same as the ﬁrst
by converting a layup on a feed
by junior Chris McHugh. Again,
the Yellow Jackets answered
with a 5-0 run, cutting the lead
to nine. This time, junior captain
Isaiah Goodman ended the run
as he hit a baseline jump shot.
Randolph—Macon responded by
scoring the next three points.

W&L then went on an 8-0
run of its own. Sophomore Ben
Goetsch and junior Kirk Jones
made back-to-back three-point-
ers and Bienemann added in two.
The score was 52-36, the Gener-
als’ largest lead of the game.

Both teams then traded bas-
kets when a relentless Randolph-
Macon team went on a 17-0 run
to re-take the lead with under
four minutes to play; this was
the Jackets’ ﬁrst lead since the
ﬁrst few minutes of the game.
Bienemann once again ended
the run and hit two crucial foul
shots to make the score 61-60.

Later, in the last two minutes
of the game, McHugh hit a three
despite a defender in his face
to give W&L a two point lead.
Randolph-Macon, undeterred,
went right down the court and
knotted the game at 67-67 with
one minute to play. Neither

team was able to score again in
regulation and the game went to
overtime.

The Yellow Jackets opened
the scoring in overtime on a fast
break that led to an easy two
points. Kusimo countered with
a jump shot at the foul line, to
deadlock the score at 69-69.
Randolph—Macon scored the
next four points, but Bienemann
responded with the next four
points. With 1:36 left to play, the
Yellow Jackets knocked down
two foul shots. McHugh was
fouled on W&L’s next posses-
sion and matched Macon’s two
foul shots.

With the shot clock turned off
at the end of the game, McHugh
drove past his defender from the
top of the arc, but was blocked
on the shot attempt. Bienemann,
who was in the right spot the
whole game, grabbed the loose
ball and banked in a shot with
1.3 seconds remaining to win
the game. ‘

Goodman said the win was
a testament to how the program
has progressed over the past few
years.

“It meant a lot to our team
to end that winning streak,”

said Goodman. “We have gone
through so much together as a
team, and to be able to say that
we’re the team that ended that
losing streak shows how much
we have grown. Two years ago,
we may have lost that game in
regulation. Last year, we might
have lost in OT. But this year,
we pulled it out with a lot of
great plays - we got stops when
we had to have them and ﬁn-
ished buckets when we needed
them. Our next task is to start
the W&L winning streak over
Randolph Macon.”

W& Lee defeated Dickinson
College at home earlier in the
week in the team’s ﬁrst home
game. The Generals started out
fast, building a 22-6 lead in the
opening 10 minutes of the game;

.they hit 12 of their ﬁrst 15 shots.

W&L improved its lead and
went into halftime up by 20, the
score was 35-15.

Dickinson would not relent in
the second half and cut the lead
to 12 with just under 12 minutes
to play. However, W&L did not
let up and increased its advan-
tage to as high as 24 points (70-
46). The ﬁnal score was 70-52.

Sweet swims for men at

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team is pick-
ing up the pace as the quality
of their opponents rises. From
Thursday through Saturday the
teams traveled to Gambier, to
participate in the Nike Invita-
tional at the Kenyon Athletic
Center Natatorium for the Nike
Cup, against their stiffest com-
petition all year.

“Some of us just wanted
to swim lifetime bests, some
wanted to make national cuts,
and others are recovering from
injuries and just want to see
where they are so far this year,”
said senior Alex Sweet. “We
had a lot of great swims and
are looking forward to our next
chance to compete.”

The men ﬁnished with 296
points, good for sixth out of
seven teams and just 15 points
behind Davidson.

On Thursday evening, the
Generals got off to a strong start
when their 800 free relay team
of juniors Paul Crook, Chris

Diebold and Brett Tatman, and
Sweet took ﬁfth place with a
time of 6:51.56, good enough
for a provisional cut.

“As always there is a high
sense of pride and team when
we are on deck, whether it be
at a duel meet, conference, na-
tionals, or the Nike cup,” said
Tatman. “People tend to take
their swims very seriously at
this mid-season meet because
we have rested and (some of us)
shaved, although that’s not to
say we’re not joking around to-
gether. I think we all swim bet-
ter when we are having fun on
deck, some teams tense up and
stress too much at big meets, but
I think that’s one advantage our
team has. When the atmosphere
is fun and you can joke around
with your entire team (coaches
included), you are going to be
less stressed about your swims
and swim much faster.”

The Generals were led by
Sweet’s multiple automatic
qualifying times on the sec-
ond and third days of compe-
tition. In the prelims for the

50 free, Sweet broke the pool
and W&L record, touching the
wall in 20.55. In the ﬁnals, he
broke his new record by record-
ing a 20.43, which automati-
cally qualiﬁes him for nation-
als. Sweet also placed third in
the 200 free with a time good
enough for a provisional cut.

“The atmosphere is certain-
ly more intense with all of the
great competition,” said Sweet.
“But we have already had a
very close meet with Carnegie
Mellon, which helped us to pre-
pare for Kenyon.”

Other day two highlights in-
cluded Crook placing eighth in
the 200 free with aprovisional
cut time of 1:42.40 and senior
Tim McGlaston placing ﬁfth in
the 50 free with another provi-
sion cut time of 20.90. Sweet
and McGlaston teamed with
Tatrnan and sophomore Bran-
don Bamds to take fourth in the
200 free relay with another pro-
visional cut.

“We are also on the bubble
in the 800 and 200 free relays,”
said Sweet. “Ideally we would

season high of 24 points on 10
of 15 shooting from the ﬁeld.
Goodman and Jones were also
in double ﬁgures, scoring 11 and
10 points respectively.

Goodman attributed the win
to execution and good defense.

“We played great defense and
held their leading scorers below
their averages,” said Goodman.
“We took care of the ball and
picked their zone apart.”

The Generals were not as
effective against ﬁfth-ranked
Virginia Wesleyan on Sunday.
Bienemann got the Generals
off to a quick start scoring on
the ﬁrst possession but Virginia
Wesleyan’s outside shooting
overwhelmed the Generals from
the start. The Generals trailed
37-26 at halftime and, despite
a few sparks could never mount
a serious threat to the Marlin’s
lead, falling 68-53.

W&L now has a 2-4 overall
record and is 1-1 record in the
ODAC.

Bienemann said the team has
lofty goals this year.

“The team’s goal this year is
to win an ODAC championship
and go to the NCAA touma—
merit.”

Kenyon

like to get the A cuts in these
events at conference and settle
the issue for sure.”

Day three saw Sweet leading
the way again, this time in the
100 free. He broke his school
record in the preliminaries with
a time of 45.15 and then reset
the record again in the ﬁnals,
placing second in a time of
45.04, his second individual au-
tomatic cut of the meet.

In the ﬁnal event of the
meet, Sweet, McGlaston,
Bamds, and Crook teamed up
for the 400 free relay. Though
they broke the pool record set
last year by W&L’s relay of
Sweet, McGlaston, alumnae
David Croushore and Michael
Ginder, they placed third be-
hind Penn’s and Johns Hopkins’
relays. However, they did beat
rival Kenyon by just three hun-
dredths of a second.

After training in Florida
over Christmas break, the Gen-
erals will host Marymount and
last year’s Bluegrass Mountain
Conference runner-up Wingate
on Jan. 12 at 1p.m.

As Washington and Lee’s
most active judicial body, the
Student Judicial Council main-
tains a surprisingly low proﬁle.
That is, until a conduct violation
lands you in front of them.

And that’s something SJC
Chairman Shane Wilson aims to
change.

“A lot of students aren’t
aware of what the SJC is, what
our role is, what we’re doing,

what our policies are,” said Wil-
son.

That issue grew
more complicated recently when
a major policy change
altered the procedures
and implications of a
“ﬁrst strike;” ﬁrst-time
student offenders can
now be penalized ad-
ministratively through
the Dean of Students’ of-
ﬁce rather than by a trial
before the SJC, the body
tasked with enforcing uni-
versity policies dealing
with student behavior—in-
cluding alcohol and drug
violations.

The new policy also al-
lowed ﬁrst strikes to be ex-
punged from students’ records
after a period of good behav-
ior. .

Many students accused W&L
of backsliding on student self-
governance with these changes
and the appointment of Associate
Dean of Students Brandon Dotson
as the SJC’s ﬁrst advisor.

Wilson, a veteran SJC Justice,
ran on a platform designed to edu-
cate the student body about the SJC
while addressing concerns about the
body’s independence. Having worked
in the new system for several months,

however, he is pleased with its progress:

“Basically, [the new policy] helps students
out if they’ve had one strike,” Wilson said. [If]
they go 52 weeks without having a second inci-
dent, the strike is effectively treated as an edu-
cational opportunity which would not result in
a permanent disciplinary ﬁle so, in terms of re-
porting to graduate schools and medical schools
and employers, a student does not have to say
that he or she had a serious conduct incident.
That’s a really great change that’s happening for
students at W&L.”

He is also pleased that the SJC is once again
hearing select ﬁrst-offense cases, “As coopera-
tion increases, as we rebuild a lot of our trust and
credibility with the faculty, Dean Dotson and I
are able to talk about cases individually and say
‘this is a ﬁrst incident, but it’s kind of egregious

Praise for new policy

SJ C adapts, educates as strike rules change

He also hopes to address student concerns
about the disciplinary duties of the SJC: “We’re
not looking to throw people under the bus...
we’re not the police...we’re looking to prepare
students to go out from W&L and represent our
university honorably.”

Dotson shares Wilson’s belief in the educa-
tional mission of the SJC and reciprocates his
praise.

“Shane Wilson is an outstanding student
leader. . .his leadership has brought a lot of new
ideas. He really cares about students at W&L as
individuals,” he said. “It’s an absolute pleasure
to work with the SJC.”

Dotson stressed that his role is one that helps
maximize the SJC’s potential and increase its re-
sources—and he’s pleased with its progress.

He offered particular accolades for the

and we want to see what students have to say
about it.’”
“It works well because we can weigh in on
situations that aren’t standard,” he said.
As for the controversial advisory position,
Wilson has nothing but praise for Dotson:
“[Dean Dotson] has been a great advisor and
wonderful asset. . .he’s been a pleasure to
work with,” he said, citing in particular the
inﬂux of funds and resources that SJC has
enjoyed this year.

“We have a laptop, we have a printer, we have
some discretionary funds we can use for getting
the word out, for education,” he said.

Education is key to Wilson’s vision for the
SJC: education about the rules, about the pen-
alties, and about the body itself. The group has
worked throughout the year to be more visible;
they’ve manned a booth at the student activities
fair and helped sponsor several mailings cau-
tioning students to enjoy themselves responsi-
bly. Future plans include community forums to
bring the SJC’s message—and its warnings—to
the students.

“Students have a right to know,” said Wil-
son.

group‘s ability to follow university policies
“with the individual student and the community
interests in mind,” and characterized its future as
“extremely bright.” In the long-terrn, he hopes to
see the SJ C take its place as “the frontrunner in
sound student self-governance.”

Junior Justice Chris Tutor, who announced he
is running for an ofﬁcer position in the next elec-
tion, may be a part of that future and he consid-
ers the changes beneﬁcial.

“Shane has done a
wonderful job of getting the SJC the credibil-
ity it needs so the faculty don’t pull the plug. I
think it’s more efficient this year, Dotson said.
“Andl think he’s really tried to be more proac-
tive in getting these issues out there,” he said,
referencing the policy of mandatory suspension
for students refusing a breathalyzer test at the
police station after a Driving Under the Inﬂu-
ence arrest.

Said Tutor, “I think everyone from the faculty
to the administration to the student body should
have 100 percent conﬁdence in the SJC and I
think we’ve done a_wonderful job.”

Chairman Wilson concurs: “I try to be fair
and I feel like we do that.”

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

Since September 11, 2001,
President Bush’s war on terror-
ism has been one of the hot-but-
ton issues in American politics.

From the Iraq war to the Pa-
triot Act, the Bush administration
has been known to make deci-
sions behind closed doors. In-
vestigative reporter Bob Wood-
ward, who will speak at W&L
on Friday, is one of the few and

showed how authorities deep in-
side the White House had worked
to cover up the break-in.

On the verge of impeachment,
President Richard Nixon made
history by being the ﬁrst Ameri-
can president to resign from of-
ﬁce.

When the Woodward and
Bernstein spoke at the Society
of Professional Journalists con-
ference last fall, the room was
packed with reporters who want-
ed to hear from the reporters,

Lee’s Director of Special Pro-
grams, said that the symposium
is designed to foster discussion.
“It’s one thing to sit at the feet of
a celebrity—it’s another thing to
engage that celebrity,” Fure said.

“[The Institute for Honor]
wants to create a community of
leaming——a community that is
much larger than at W&L be-
cause it includes adults. People
of all ages can talk to each other
about the questions the program
raises.”

Prowler caught in houses

Rockbridge County Sheriff ’s deputies arrested a prowler Wednesday morning behind a W&L stu-
dent’s house. . .

Lt. Tim Hickman of the sheriff ’s department said deputies were dispatched to 664 Greenhouse Road
(near the old County Seat Traveller stop) after a female student called 911 and said she could hear some-
one in the ﬁrst ﬂoor of her house.

A deputy went behind the house and found Chad Williams, a 25-year-old Lexington resident, leaving
the house. "

The prowler apparently visited more than one house before being caught by police.

W&L senior F emi Kusimo said he woke up at about 5:45 a.m. Wednesday morning when he heard
the door to his bedroom open.

Kusimo, a senior who lives at Pole 4, said he thought his roommate was coming into the room to bug
him.

Cedar Lake Comes to Lexington
By Ryan castle

When I thlnk of ballet, vlslons of toy soldlers
In tutus danclng to lullaby muslc come to mlnd.
Admittedly, l’ve never been a big fan. My perceptlon
changed, however, when I was Introduced to the work
of the New York clty based company Cedar Lake.
Watching their performance, I soon reallzed that they
were unllke any ballet group I had seen before (and
with ﬂve sisters, I've seen my falr share). cedar Lake
utlllzes unique, lnnovatlve dance technlques to dellver
a gripping show even for skeptlcs. Gravity seems not
to blnd these dancers as their stage ls-not llmlted to
the ﬂoor but extends to the walls and celllng. Thls
multl-dlmenslonal approach to ballet coupled with
contemporary muslc overwhelms the senses and makes
for a remarkable experlence for ballet connolsseurs and
novlces allke.

After seelng a vldeo of the performance,
sophomore Prarna Mansukhanl descrlbed It as,
“Awesome! Deﬂnltely the coolest ballet I've seen. It’s
amazing what they’re able to do”.

On January 31, Cedar Lake will be welcomed
to campus and exhlblt thls lnnovatlve dance In a
performance open to all audlences. This Is a great
opportunlty to experience the show In Lexington as It Is
In high demand In New York. Tlckets are a steal at only
$10 and are avallable for purchase onllne.

You picked a Winner

Mock Convention.‘ more than just a wild party this year

As the Democratic race see-
saws across the country, Wash-
ington and Lee suddenly has a
chance to end the mystery.

Who will it be? Hillary or
Obama? Edwards - probably not
so much.

Hillary’s victory in New
Hampshire deﬁed the polling data
and newspaper articles that were
predicting her campaign’s immi-
nent collapse.

That resurgence — the second
time a Clinton has used New
Hampshire to launch a comeback
— means that Mock Convention
actually has a real prediction to
make.

Too many of the last conven-
tions have been nothing but a
rubber stamp on conventional
wisdom. By convention time in
2004, everyone knew Kerry was
the runaway winner. Bush had a
clear advantage in 2000 and old-
man Dole ran away with things in
1996.

In fact, not since 1992 (re-
member that other Clinton, the
one who played sax on stage at
Zollman’s?) have the political
gurus around campus had such a

difﬁcult decision to make.

In 1992, the convention man-
aged to select Clinton even
though the first ﬁve primaries
produced four different winners.
This year’s race is more of a two-
horse show, but nobody seems to
know who really has the edge.
Obama is exciting new voters, but
Hillary’s New Hampshire victory
showed that older voters — and es-
pecially older women — still carry

less than two weeks from now.

A week after Mock Conven-
tion, twenty-two states will go to
the polls on Super Tuesday. No-
body knows if that massive day of
voting will settle the race or leave
it dragging on to the real conven-
tion in Denver in the summer.

The Mock Con organizers
love to brag about the conven-
tion’s history and accuracy. Those
boasts are an important reminder

That resurgence — the second time a Clinton

has used New Hampshire to launch a come-

back — means that Mock Convention actually

has a real prediction to make.

Too many of the last conventions have been

nothing but a rubber stamp 

 

a lot of clout.

And so while the press and
political establishment scramble
around the country looking for the
secret to the nomination the win-
ner will be revealed in Lexington

that the convention is about more
than a wild weekend of drinking
red, white and blue beer (all in the
name of patriotism, right?).

And, yes, in some years (like
1988’s famous Clinton moment)

the partying has been more.im-
portant than the convention.

But other years like the inau-
gural event in 1908 when del-
egates got so excited that a brawl
broke out between supporters of
rival candidates, this event has
been about politics ﬁrst and par-
tying second.

But amid the revelry, there’s
some serous business to deal
with.

Nobody wants to be part of
the convention that spent thou-
sands of dollars andthousands of
hours planning, organizing and
enjoying the event that picked the
wrong candidate.

Aside from the honor system,
alumni mention Mock Con as one
of the most important things that
make W&L what it is.

And so as the festivities get
underway, the ﬂoats get built
and the political bigwigs roll into
town, take a minute to check the
polls and see how your state will
vote.

Across the nation, Democrats
want a candidate. Mock Conven-
tion matters again.

Why doesn’t W&L honor MLK Day?

The school, with its low number of minorities, has a duty to honor his principles

By Jess Steinmetz
STAFF WRITER

Every year on the third Mon-
day of January, federal otﬁces,
post ofﬁces, banks and schools
across this nation close to honor
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As
we all know, this admirable civil
rights leader spoke out against
segregation, discrimination and
hate. The day is taken off to re-
member King and to honor his
memory.

So why do we not do this in
Rockbridge County? The banks
and post oﬂices will, of course,
close but students attending both
local colleges and Rockbridge
County Schools will be in class.

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty thankfully does not completely
ignore Martin Luther King Jr.,
Day. We celebrate with a birthday
party for the children of the com-
munity, a lecture delivered by a
distinguished African-American
writer and_a candlelight proces-
sion. But is this really enough?

What does it say about our
school that it simply omits a na-

~s<.3”t£§«‘:»-e‘
I-Z<«<‘~.§..t.¥Z?25

    

tional holiday from our sched-
ules? I am sure there is a some-
what valid reason on paper why
we attend class on this day.

Likewise, Rockbridge County
Schools made the decision to fail
to observe the holiday this year,
because the school closed at least
once for inclement weather be-
fore January.

In 1986, President Ronald
Reagan declared Martin Luther
King Jr. Day a federal public holi-
day. Prior to this, King’s birthday
was observed as a public holiday
in 27 states and the District of Co-
lumbia.

Martin Luther King Jr. stood
for the non-violent ﬁght for
equality, dignity and freedom for
all races and peoples. Why is this
not good enough for W&L?

There has been great reluc-
tance to observe Martin Luther
King Jr. Day both before and after
the bill was passed. The state of
Virginia originally added Martin
Luther King Jr. Day to Lee Jack-
son Day thus it became known as
Lee-Jackson-King Day.

How ironic is it that this holi-

day celebrated not only a civil
rights leader but also Confederate
Army generals on the same day?
The state of Virginia ﬁnally
recognized Martin Luther King
Jr. Day in 2000. In my home
state of California, no one would
even dream of attending school
on Martin Luther King Day. But
I could never imagine honoring
a Confederate Army General or
a Confederate ﬂag hanging in a
dorm room back home either.
Even after all of the work by
civil rights leaders, there still is
discrimination and hate in our so-
ciety today. W&L’s location in the
South makes it’s observation of
Martin Luther King Jr. Day even

more imperative.

Our school is not exactly
known for diversity or lack of rac-
ism. Are we not only reinforcing
these stereotypes about us by not
observing the only national holi-
day dedicated to a commemorat-
ing an African-American?

Furthermore, it is our duty as
a prestigious institution of higher
learning to show our commitment
to the principles of Martin Luther
King Jr.

There is no more perfect way
than doing this than by the simple
observation of the holiday that
was intended to honor his mem-

ory.

New exhibit in Staniar Gallery shows how scanners can double as cameras

By Queenle Wong
STAFF WRITER

Co-curators of the exhibition
“Scanner as Camera,” Ruth Ad-
ams and Christa Bowden, at a
joint lecture Thursday revealed
the process and techniques they
and other artists used to create the
pieces featured in the university’s
Staniar Gallery.

“I think that ﬁnally just in the
last ﬁve years or so we have taken
those two things, Photoshop and
the scanner, and brought them
into our art world. We use them
as speciﬁc tools to get the look
that we want,” said Adams to a
packed Concert Hall.

The lecture and the exhibition
showcased the works of Adams
and Bowden along with six other
contemporary artists! Stephen
Althouse, Darryl Curran, Val-
erie Mendoza, J. Seeley, Rhona

Shand and Maggie Taylor--who
used the ﬂatbed scanner as a digi-
tal camera.

Adams and Bowden demon-
strated different ways each art-
ist used the scanner to create a
unique look. Through a series of
slides, the audience consisting of
students, faculty and community
members saw the artists’ original
works before they digitally ma-
nipulated them. With each slide,
the audience saw the artists’ scans
gradually change, illustrating
how they got to the ﬁnal product.

Adams for example, an assis-
tant professor of art at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky, reluctantly re-
vealed that the blurry background
in her piece “Moulin Rouge” was
actually a scan of her hair.

“It’s an entirely different way
of working,” said Bowden, an as-
sistant professor of art at Wash-

ington and Lee University.
Audience member reactions
to the lecture and exhibit were
positive.
Ellen Martin, a photographer

didn’t know that Maggie Tay-

lor, whose works portray a sense.

of fantasy,- used painting in the

background of her photographs.
“It makes me want to go

“It makes me want to go home, take my scan-

ner apart, put some of the techniques I saw in

the show and put them to use. ’

HANS RILLING, local photographer
 

in Rockbridge County, said that
the lecture helped her understand
scanography better. Martin said
that she appreciated the fact that
the artists revealed some of their
techniques rather than keeping
them private. For example, she

home, take my scanner apart, put
some of the techniques I saw in
the show and put them to use,”
said Hans Rilling, another pho-
tographer in the county.
Freshman Kyle Parsons de-
scribed the photographs as “re-

ally interesting.”

The exhibition was first
presented at the University of
Kentucky’s Tuska Center for
Contemporary Art in November
2006. Adams, Bowden, Curran
and Taylor were part of a panel
that discussed scanography at the
Society of Photographic Educa-
tion’s annual conference in 2006.
Althouse and Seeley also attend-
ed the conference. It was after the
panel that Bowden and Adams
began to organize the exhibition.

Choosing artists was a difﬁ-
cult decision due to the number
of artists across the nation that
work with scanners. Yet a small
group, which represented how
artists were using these tools just
“made more sense,” Adams said.

They wanted to showcase a
variety of styles in the exhibition
rather than having all the works

look the same.

Mendoza’s “Insomnia” for
example, took advantage of the
technology’s shortcomings — the
claustrophobic feeling created by
the boundaries of the scanner --
in order to illustrate her struggle
with insomnia.

Taylor and Shand used a more
traditional approach by scanning
two-dimensional objects. Shand’s
works also depict a sense of ee-
riness not present in the other
works.

“Scanner as Camera” will re-
main on view at the Staniar Gal-
lery until Feb. 15. The gallery,
located in the Wilson Center, is
open to students and the public
during day-time hours.

“I really love how the show
is...and we are hoping that it’s
going to travel,” said Adams.

Walk Hard

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

I used to work in a movie rent-
al store. For about half a year,
for some God-forsaken reason,
my manager thought the only
movies that were appropriate to
play in-store were the musician
biopics that were the fad at the
time—“Walk Hard,” “Ray,” and
the like.

Anyone who has ever seen
even a little of this genre can in-

_ stantly recognize the many cli-

chés it offers.

Maybe that’s why I laughed
like a drunk hyena for the first
20 minutes of “Walk Hard: The
Dewey Cox Story.” The Judd

Knocked up 2

By Cody Beauchamp
STAFF WRITER

There’s usually not much
that’s funny about teen pregnancy
(duh). But in this art-house ﬂick
heavy movie season, “Juno” is a
stunning little gem that makes it
look hilarious. .

Go see this movie. It’s proba-
bly not the best ﬁrst date choice-
“so. . .umm. . .about that drink I
invited you up for. . .”—but it’s a
must see.

The screenwriter is one Dia-

You ’ll laugh like a drunken hyena, but the gags get stale in this send-up of movies about musicians

Apatow Gang’s newest is a send-
up of the musical biopic that’s re-
ally, really funny...for about 20
minutes.

After that, the jokes, just like
the genre itself, become stilted
and stale.

Maybe the problem was the
go-for-broke approach to jokes.
Apatow and co. are deﬁnitely
the new comedic royalty of H01-
lywood~they can come up with
funny stuff endlessly. But some-
times, less is more.

“Walk Hard” proves that more
than any of their previous works.

The ﬁlm takes a very “Air-
plane”-esque approach to things.
Basically, if it’s a gag—be it a
sight gag, a bit of slap-stick, a

sex joke, a pun, anything—do
it. It was funny the ﬁrst time
that Dewey tore a sink off the
wall, so of course it’s going to be
funny seeing it eight more times.
Right? Hello?

Don’t get me wrong, the ﬁlm’s
funny throughout. It’s just not
that funny.

The jokes get old, the wit dulls,
and the character of Cox becomes
just as one-dimensional as can be.
And sadly, tortured genius still
isn’t quite funny enough.

As for the acting, Reilly’s
still got great presence. Jenna
Fischer—of “Ofﬁce” fame—is
hilarious ripping the June Carter
Cashes of the world. She’s one of
the only enduringly bright spots

of the movie.

The supporting cast is a virtual
who’s-who of comedians—-Tim
Meadows, Chris Parnell, Harold
Ramis, John Michael Higgins,
Paul Rudd, Justin Long, Jason
Schwartzman and Jack Black all
show up in funny little scenes.

Jack White even put in a side-
splitting half-minute of screen
time as Elvis.

All that was really missing
was Will Ferrell showing up in
blackface as Jimi Hendrix. And
honestly, they went for every oth-
er gag, why not that?

All and all, “Walk Hard” is
stuck in a twisted little catch-22:
it can’t poke fun at how formu-
laic biopics are without being te-

diously. . .umm. . .forrnulaic. Just
like biopics that take themselves
seriously, even the incredible tal-
ent of the cast can’t save a con-
strained and usually depressing
story.

It’s sad, really, that one John
C. Reilly’s poorer roles has
earned him his most well-known
award nomination. I love Reilly
as an actor, but he should not take
home this year’s Golden Globe
for Lead Actor in a Comedy or
Musical.

Reilly stole what should’ve
been Seth Rogen’s nomination
for “Knocked Up.” Neither of
the two roles deserves to beat
Tom Hanks’ turn as Charlie Wil-
son, or Johnny Depp’s Sweeney

Todd, but it’s still a shame Reilly
got nominated over Rogen.

Given Reilly’s many great
previous roles, what’s especial-
ly shameful is that it was a bad
Johrmy Cash meets Cal from Tal-
ladega Nights that did it. Boo,
Golden Globes.

“Walk Hard” is deﬁnitely hu-
morous enough to be worth rent-
ing, but it’s hardly the best satire
of the year. So go rent it. I Hope-
fully it’s R rating will keep some
poor 16-year-old kid from seeing
it endlessly down at the Block-
buster.

I promise these gags won’t be
funny the 500th time.

You wouldn ’t expect a comedy about teen pregnancy, but Juno delivers a witty look at life with a big belly

blo Cody, a blogger and novel-
ist who—side note—published a
memoir in 2006 about her time
as a stripper. The book, “Candy
Girl” was the ﬁrst book selected
for Dave Letterman’s book club.
Go ﬁgure.

The ﬁlm’s supporting cast is
excellent. Cody created a great
set of characters, from the too-
cool-to-be-true dad to the too-
adorable-to-be-real baby’s daddy.
The cast does a universally great
job with each of their roles.

Of particular note are Jenni-

fer Garner and Jason Bateman as
the adoptive parents—to—be. Bate-
man’s cool yuppie is pitch per-
fect, while Garner delivers one of
the ﬁlm’s top moments.

In a ﬁlm where the antagonist
is actually growing within the
protagonist, Garner’s role pro-
vides a good stand-in for the au-
dience’s disdain. Yet despite this,
she still commands sympathy—a
delicate spot of acting, superbly
done.

Michael Cerra, as the lovable
geek who knocks Juno up (“he’s

great in. . .chair”) is so-so.

He doesn’t really seem to be
fully comfortable with his char-
acter. Part of this is Cody’s fault.
Part is probably that Cerra is still
a young actor.

I’m willing to forgive this dim
spot though. It’s one of the few
parts of the ﬁlm where the mark
is missed, and the movie is in no
way about Paulie Gleeker any-
way.

This ﬁlm belongs to Juno.

As for that, I’ll say this'—if
Ellen Page doesn’t receive an

Oscar nod this year, it’s a down-
right insult. Seriously, she’s that
good. Cody’s character is one of
the wittiest in recent ﬁlm. But it’s
Page’s brilliant performance that
brings the character fully to life.

Page is only 20 years old and
her ﬁrst major role was playing
a pregnant teen in love with that
guy from “Superbad,” so don’t
expect an Oscar win. The Acad-
emy has shown an unfortunate
fear of rewarding young actors or
daring roles. _

All the same, watch this one’s

career. She’s, umm. . .supergood.

“Juno” opened into wide-re-
lease on Christmas day. It’s a ﬁt-
ting choice. The same day when
a miraculous birth is traditionally
celebrated, we’re given another
miracle to look at.

A movie about teen pregnancy
that’s not preachy or political,
that handles the uncomfortable
with grace and is also whip-
smart, funny, and poignant-now
that’s a Christmas miracle.

Wrestling ﬁnishes fourth of seven teams at ﬁrst home meet

By Mlchael Keenan
spams canon

The Washington and Lee wrestling team
. competed in its ﬁrst home event, the W&L Invi-
tational, on Saturday. The Generals totaled 58.5
points, good for fourth out of seven teams. The
Generals beat Scranton, Waynesburg and South-
ern Virginia but fell to team champion Mt. St.
Joseph, Washington & Jefferson and Muhlen-
berg. W&L’s alternates also totaled 17 points
that did not count toward the team total.

The Generals were led by senior Anthony
Boniello, who took ﬁrst place in the 165-pound
weight class, the only General to win his weight
class. After receiving a ﬁrst-round bye, Boniello
cruised past SVU’s Julian James by a ﬁnal score
of 6-1. In the ﬁnal, Boniello captured ﬁrst place
by beating Josh Sasfy of Mt. St. Joseph, 7-2.

In addition to Boniello’s win, the Generals
had a number of other strong performances,
including third-place ﬁnishes by seniors Peter
Lawrence, Tim Manson and Kirk Adamson and
junior John Christopher.

Lawrence opened his day by pinning Scran-
ton’s Mike Ebert in 4:56. In the championship
semiﬁnals, Lawrence was defeated in a very close
rriatch by Muhlenberg’s Rob Kevin. Lawrence
trailed 4-3 most of the third period but could not
get controlfor the two points needed to give him
théi lead. Witli just seconds left, Lawrence’s last
attempt wasithwlarted and Kevin gained control
. as the buzzer sounded to make the ﬁnal score 6-

3. However, Lawrence rebounded with two vic-
tories to take third place in the 149-pound class.
He defeated teammate senior Eric Gagne 14-7
inthe consolation semis and then bested‘ Wash-
ington and Jefferson’s Shaun Yackey 7-5 in the
consolation ﬁnals.

Manson operied his day with a hard-fought pin
against Muhlenberg’s Ryan Hoffman. Through
the ﬁrst two periods, Manson and Hoffman ex-
changed controls and reversals several times and

. entered the third period tied, 6-6. Manson. started
down to begin the period and broke free to go up

7-6. From then on Manson was in control, open-
ing a lead before pinning Hoffman with 0:19
remaining. Manson was beaten in the champi-
onship semiﬁnals by the eventual champion,
SVU’s Pete Rose, 7-2. Manson rebounded with
two more victories, both by a pin in under two
minutes, to take third place. Lawrence pinned
Waynesburg’s Kevin Walsh in 1:59 and then
pinned teammate freshman Keith Jaworski in
1:58 to take third place.

Adamson also tallied a third—place victory
for the Generals. After breezing past Scranton’s
Luke Genovese 9-2, Adamson fell 6-3 to Wash-
ington and Jefferson’s Chris Price. Adamson
then defeated two teammates, sophomores Rich-
ard Knack and Jon Brown, to win the consola-
tion ﬁnals of the 184-pound class.

Christopher also ﬁnished with a 3-1 record
for the Generals. After winning his opening
match against Muhlenberg’s Billy Sholly, he
was pinned in the championship semis by Wash-
ington and Jefferson’s Alex Cressley. After se-
curing a 10-1 major decision in a dominating
performance against Scranton’s Joe Williams,
Christopher bested Sholly again to take third in
the 197-pound class.

The Generals will return to action next week-
end when they host a tournament featuring Ste-
vens Tech, King’s Point and McDaniel.

Women break even in ODAC play

By Russ Weems
surr wnmzn

The women’s basketball team had an important week,
facing two tough conference opponents. They took on
last year’s ODAC runner-up Virginia Wesleyan on Tues-
day and Roanoke College on Friday.

The women started out with a tough match-up against
the Virginia Wesleyan Marlins. The Generals were
plagued by a slow start, shooting 22.2% (6 out of 27) in
the ﬁrst half. At the break, the Generals trailed the Marlins
by a score of 27-16. After the half, W&L came out ener-
gized and scored the ﬁrst three baskets, cutting the lead to
27-22. The Generals kept ﬁghting and trailed by only six
points on three occasions. They could not pull any closer
though as the Marlins pulled away to tally a 52-38 vic-
tory. The Generals had a tough time stopping the Marlins’
two starting forwards, Heather Phillips and Taylor Lowe,
who scored a combined 25 points. However, the Gener-
als did» have some strong individual performances in the
defeat. Sophomore center Kaitlyn Camp tallied a double-
double with 10 points and 12 boards. Junior forward Kara
Nadeau had 8 points to go along with 8 rebounds. Fresh-
man guard Allie Long provided 9 points in the effort. The
loss dropped the Generals to 2-3 in ODAC play.

The Generals posted a strong away win against the
Maroons of Roanoke College on Friday. The women
would have to overcome a large deﬁcit to win as they
again started out cold. The General again shot 22.2% in
the ﬁrst half. They trailed by as many as 15 in the ﬁrst
and trailed by 12 (30-18) at half. For most of the second
half, the Generals could not do much to crack into this
lead. With just 6:30 remaining, the Generals were down
by 13. It was going to take a special performance by the
Generals to come back, and they had one. The Generals
ratcheted up the defense, holding the Maroons to only one
basket for the rest of the game. W&L outscored Roanoke
19-2 in the ﬁnal 6:30. This end-of-the-game domination
was a total team effort. Freshman guard Allie long led
the run with nine pointsvin the stretch. Junior guard Beth-
any Ridenhour provided a couple of clutch three-point-
ers in the ﬁnal 90 seconds. The win was sealed for the
Generals by a couple of free throws by senior forward
Amanda Kane with 13 seconds left. The Generals more
than doubled their low 22 percent ﬁrst-half shooting with
a 52 percent mark in the second. W&L had a strong per-
formance on the boards, out-rebounding Roanoke 42-33.
Many Generals had strong contributions to the win. Allie
Long had 13 points and 4 assists. Senior forward Kris-
ten Krouchick had 11 points and 6 boards. Amanda Kane
and Bethany Ridenhour both added 8 points. Overall, the
women are now 3-3 in ODAC competition and 4-7 overall
and looking to carry the momentum of this win into the
rest of conference play.

The Generals will return to action away against the
Eastern Mennonite Royals at 7:00 on Tuesday, Jan 15.

Decorated athletes escape consequences

ByAdam Lewis
COLUMNIST

To a lot of people,‘ the symbol of
an asterisk (*) is just that-—a symbol:
A meaningless representation of some
seemingly notable words or numbers
about which no one actually cares.
Let’s face it, the asterisk’s value in our
society can be summed up by its lo-
cation on your keyboard, and the fact
that it takes holding down the “Con-
trol” and “8” keys just to access it.
However, recent events in sports have
led me to place this trivial little symbol
in higher regard than a Dave Monroe
article in The Trident.

This past year’s revelations of the
“Spygate” scandal in the NFL and the
“Mitchell Report” in baseball serve as
the basis for my newfound emphasis
on the asterisk. And it should be not-
ed, (perhaps with an “*”), that I am not
naive enough to believe these cases to
be the only ones Worth highlighting;
they. just happen to be the only docu-
mented instances that merit an asterisk
in my mind.

To thosejofyou who are unfamil-
iar with what sports people are calling
“Spygate,” the term refers to the guilt
of the New England Patriots orga-
nization in the spying of opponents’
sideline signals. Though the Patriots
claim this illegal act to be prevalent
throughout the league, they have been
the only team caught and penalized for
it. Oh, and by penalized, I mean «they
surrendered the worse of their two ﬁrst
round draft picks and a few hundred
thousand dollars. In a league where
anything less than six ﬁgures means as
much as Tony Romo to Jessica Simp-
son, this “punishment” is merely a
false start worth ﬁve yards to a team
already up by 40 points in the fourth
quarter. In other words, it’s a slap on
the wrist.

Tell me something, Mr. Commis-
sioner (and I apologize to any rela-
tives who may be reading this). How
is it that the Patriots get off this easily
when they are the ﬁrst team to go un-
defeated in a 16-game season and they
are going for their fourth Super Bowl
this decade? If you ask me, I have no
problem holding “Ctrl-8” and typing
an asterisk next to not only this sea-

_ son, but to all of their Super Bowls. I

mean, the Patriots are proven cheat-
ers, and no one cheats just once if they
continue to get away with it. They
should be counting their blessings that
they even get to keep their rings. Hey
Coach Belichick, put that and your
oversized sweatshirt in your pipe and
smoke it.

Speaking of cheaters, Senator
George Mitchell disclosed one or two
in his report last month. Within the
report, there are ﬁles on 83 current,
and retired baseball players who are
alleged users of human growth hor-
mones or anabolic steroids. And ex-
perts say that this only scratches the
surface of steroid use in baseball over
the past twenty years.

So far, some players have openly

‘ denied any truth to these reports, some_
have admitted to minor use of men- -

tioned supplements, and still others
have yet to speak out, probably be-
cause the steroids have caused their
mouth muscles to be too big to talk.
As far as I’m concerned, the factual
evidence of this report is overwhelm-
ingly blatant, and Bud Selig should
warm up his ﬁngers for a great deal
of asterisk typing. One may argue that
the extent of a player’s use of either
HGH or steroids could be insigniﬁ-
cant, but the lack of an asterisk next
to the statistics of these guilty players
severely hurts those who are innocent.
Now, barring a similar future report,
players like Greg Maddux who have
been overshadowed by cheaters such
as Roger Clemens will gain the recog-
nition they deserve in the form of as-
terisk-free statistics.

With the path that modern-day
sports are taking, it won’t be long be-
fore the asterisk gets a key of its own
on your keyboard. As long as Barry
Bonds hoists the Home Run crown
above his steroid-induced head and
Bill Belichick’s hand is worth more
than a small country’s GDP, this era in
sports will be known as the Age of the
Asterisk. And hey, with the rising rate
of Adderall use among college stu-
dents, I wouldn’t be surprised to see
GPAs with little asterisks next to them
saying “Student used performance-en-
hancing drugs.”

Generals huddle to congratulate Marymount and Wingate after Saturday's home meet.

Relay secures Victory

Men dominate Marymount, squeeze by Wingate; women end meet at 1-]

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s swim-
ming teams returned to action
for the ﬁrst time following
their annual winter training
trip as they took on Wing-
ate and Marymount. For the
men, it was a chance to see
how they stacked up against a
Wingate team that nearly took
the Bluegrass Mountain Con-
ference title from them last
year. In a thrilling ﬁnale, the
men won the meet in the ﬁnal
relay and beat Wingate 133-
129. The women fell to Wing-
ate 160-101, but both teams
beat Marymount; the men by
a 222-37 score and the women
by 184.5-70.5.

The men trailed most of the
meet and were down by nine
points with just three events
remaining, the 100 butterﬂy,
200 individual medley and
400 free relay. Led by sopho-
more Josh Gonzalez, the Gen-
erals dominated the 100 ﬂy
taking ﬁrst, third and fourth.
Gonzalez touched the wall in
53.26, just 0. 14 seconds ahead
of Wingate sophomore Scott
Stevens. Freshman Brandon

Wilder and sophomore Win-
ston Stagg also ﬁnished in un-
der 54 seconds to secure third
and fourth and tie the meet
113-113 with two events to
go. Wingate regained the led

alter the 200 IM with sopho-'

more Kyle Corcoran’s win.

With only one event re-
maining, the men trailed by
ﬁve points. If the Generals won
the ﬁnal relay, the meet would
be tied. If they could take ﬁrst
and third, the meet was theirs.
Though the Generals’ top re-
lay of seniors Tim McGlaston
and Alex Sweet, junior Brett
Tatman and sophomore Bran-
don Bamds jumped out to a
commanding early lead that
was never challenged, the bat-
tle for third place remained in
doubt. After the ﬁrst two legs,
sophomores Nick Talluri and
Jonathan Giesen had opened
a second-and-a-half lead over
Wingate’s B team in the battle
for third. Swimming third,
Gozalez more than doubled
the lead to over three seconds
and junior Chris Diebold an-
chored to secure third place
and the team victory for the
Generals.

The win was a total team
effort. The duo of Sweet and

McGlaston dominated the
sprint freestyle events for the
Generals ﬁnishing ﬁrst and
second in both the 50 free
and the 100 free. Sweet won
the 50 free in 20.80 with Mc-
Glaston just a tenth of a sec-
ond behind. Sweet then picked
up his second individual vic-
tory of the day when he bested
McGlaston by half a second
in the 100 free, ﬁnishing in
a time of 46.75. Senior Will
Hartman also chipped in a win
in the 100 backstroke.

On the women’s side, ju-
nior Lindsey Strachan and
freshman Tess Hayden led
the way with two individual
victories each. Strachan won
both backstroke events, the
100 back in a time of 1:02.03
and the 200 back in a time of
2:12.63. Hayden took ﬁrst in
the 1000 free, ﬁnishing the last
100 over three seconds faster
than Wingate’s Sarah Erickson
to win in a time of 11:04.57.
Hayden also won the 500
freestyle in 5:24.49. Freshman
Jackie Smith won the 200 free
in a time of2:01.33.

With the wins, the men
improve to 9-0 this season
and the women’s record sits
at 7-5. Next up for the women

is a trip to defending ODAC
champion Randolph-Macon
for a dual meet on Jan. 18.
The men don’t return to action
until they host Johns Hopkins
for two-day duel on Jan. 25
and 26 in what will likely be
their toughest test of the regu-
lar season.

Men’s bball makes habit of Winning

Loss to Roanoke ends four-game winning streak, but team is still 6-5

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee
men’s basketball team is on
a role, extending its win-
ning streak to four games this
week.

A 71-64 home loss to Roa-
noke halted that streak Sunday,
as Roanoke pulled away in the
second half despite 28 points
from Greg Bienemann.

The game was tied at half-
time, but the Generals went
cold in the second half, hitting
just two of their 14 three-point
attempts.

Since losing to conference-
rival Virginia Wesleyan over a
month ago, the Generals have
hit their stride as they head
into conference play. W&L
won its own tournament over
Winter Break and defeated
Goucher College on the road
before beginning the heart of
its schedule.

The win against Eastern
Mennonite University on
Wednesday marked the ﬁrst
four-game winning streak for
the program since the 1989-
1990 season. Coach Adam
Hutchinson credits better ex-
ecution and cohesion for the
team’s success.

“Our offensive execution
has improved since the be-
ginning of the season,” said
Hutchinson. “We seem to
have greater trust in each other
and are more willing to share
the ball.”

On Wednesday, W&L
opened the contest against
Eastern Mennonite with two
quick layups by senior captain
Femi Kusimo to take a quick

ly narrowed the gap to two
points, 17-15, at the midway
point in the ﬁrst half. W&L
went on some small scoring
runs, but Eastern Mennonite
was right there to counter.
W&L built an 11-point lead
on a layup by senior captain
Bienemann with roughly ﬁve
minutes left in the ﬁrst half.
Junior Ryan Owens also con-
tributed to the highlight reel

“Our offensive execution has improved

since the beginning of the season. We seem

to have greater trust in each other and are

more willing to share the ball. ”

‘ADAM HUTCHINSON, head coach

4-0 advantage. The Royals did
not score until three minutes
into the game which is a testa-
ment to the Generals defense.
During the_ winning streak,
W&L has held all of their op-
ponents to under 70 points.

Seven minutes into the
game, the Generals had a com-
manding 10-point lead, which
included a dunk by sophomore
Zac White.

However, the Royals quick-

with a dunk of his own. The
team took control from then
on and ended the ﬁrst half up
42-35.

The Generals came out ﬁr-
ing in the second half the same
way they did in the ﬁrst with
a layup by Kusimo. The team
continued to distance them-
selves over their opponent,
increasing the lead to 16 at the
ﬁve-minute mark into the sec-
ond half.

The Royals answered with
a 9-0 run, but W&L countered
with an impressive 13-0 run of
its own, making the score 70-
50. Fellow captains Kusimo
and Bienemann combined for
10 of the 13 points during the
scoring run. The team went
into cruise control after that,
winning the game 79-65.

Bienemann and Kusimo
combined for a staggering 45
points in the win, including a
season-best 21 pointslby Kusi-
mo. Junior Kirk Jones also
added 11 points in the effort.

Kusimo attributed his and
Bienemann’s success to strong
guard play.

“Greg and 1 were able to
be so effective against EMU
because they had to respect
the shooters on our team so it
gave us room to work,” Kusi-
mo said.

He also said that defense
and ‘working as a team are piv-
otal in marinating success.

“For the winning streak
to continue, we have to keep
playing tough defense and
keep playing unselﬁshly on
offense.”

Washington & Lee is now
6-4 overall and 2-1 in confer-
ence as the team begins a 15-
game in-conference stretch.

emocratic Mock  
Convention  

After three years of preparation, countless hours of research and untold amounts of booze,
it all comes down to this: Barack Obama vs. Hillary Clinton. In a year when students

are celebrating the centennial convention, it seems appropriate that the gathering faces

its most difﬁcult decision in years. Before the convention gets down to the business of
selecting the Democratic nominee, some of the biggest names in Democratic politics will
take the stage to stump for their candidates. ‘Va. Gov. Tim Kaine, who speaks ﬁrst on Fri-
day, was one of Obama’s earliest supporters, while Geraldine Ferraro, the ﬁrst woman to
appear on a major party’s ticket, is a strong supporter of Clinton. The most exciting part
of the convention may c_ome decades later, when Beau Biden, Harold Ford, Jr. or Patrick
Rose run for President. That’s one of the legacies of the convention’s ﬁrst 100 years: ﬁnd-
ing risingistars like Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter and introducing them to America years
before anyone else knows who they are. The other legacypis accuracy: W&L‘students
have been right 18 out of 23 times and have only been wrong once since 1948. Will that

legacy continue? Clinton or Obama hope it do.es.

Delegations log long hours behind scenes

State chairs, student leaders sacriﬁce time to research, fundraise and design

By Allison Chopin
STAFF WRITER

Mounting excitement sur-
rounding the centennial anniver-
sary of the Mock Convention have
students anxiously awaiting the
myriad events planned for them
- the parties, distinguished speak-
ers, parade and ﬁnal outcome.
However, not all have taken time

, to notice how hard their state del-

egations have worked in the past
months.

Each state delegation has pro-
vided numerous opportunities for
its members to participate.

The state chairs were selected
over a year ago through a rigorous
application process. Each chair
has to oversee political research,
help plan the parade ﬂoat and get
its delegation ready for the con-

vention.

When students joined delega-
tions in September, some chose to
take on other leadership positions.

The'vice chair serves as an as-
sistant to the other positions, and

'the treasurer manages ﬁnances,

such as donations made to the del-
egation. *

Some delegations may have a
ﬂoat chair in charge of supplies,
designs and construction of the
state’s parade ﬂoat. L

Aside from these typical posi-
tions, the student who takes the
job of research chair must conduct

business that is particular to each '

state.

“The research chair is responsi-
ble for making contacts within the
state to communicate with about
the‘ election and for preparing the
various reports required of each

state,” said senior Kate Chiasson,
the chair for Wisconsin.

Both the research chair and
state chair may be responsible for
contacting state politicians if nec-
essary.

“The majority of
the delegates have
been helping with
making the ﬂoat. ”

KATE CHIASSON,
Wisconsin state chalr

“[In Wisconsin] the research
chair is the most involved,” Chias-
son said. -

A All delegates were asked to be

involved in the act of fundraising.

Each member provided the
names and addresses of ﬁve con-
tacts, such as friends and family,
who might be interested in donat-
ing to the student’s delegations

The students who do not as-
sume leadership roles can become

. involved in the areas of T-shirt and

ﬂoat design, among other things.

“Since we don’t have a ﬂoat
chair, the majority of delegates
have been helping with making
the ﬂoat,” said Chiasson.

The time commitment may be
small for average Mock Conven-
tion participants, but the delega-
tions still require their contribu-
tion and commitment.

“Delegates can choose to be as
involved or not involved as they
wish, but they can expect to go to a
meeting or two and help out when
it is asked for,” Chiasson said.

Are you fed up with the crazy
political calendar that has
Iowans caucusing during a
blizzard and W&L students

freezing to death while they
build floats? Or are you a fan of
the drawn-out campaign and
love the rounds of meetings,
rallies and debates? Abel
Delgado and Scott Centorino
have it out over whether our
political system needs to be
changed.

Couldn’t make it to
. the last 96 years of

from 1982 to 1996, Manchin helped

The first and only African—Ameri-
can woman elected to the Senate,
former Illinois Senator Carol Mose-
ley Braun is most well known for her
candidacy for the Democratic Party
nomination in the 2004 presidential
election. However, she dropped out of
the race days before the Iowa caucus,
deciding instead to support Howard

Harold Ford Jr.

Former Tennessee U.S. Rep

 

Former Tennessee U.S. Rep. Har-
old Ford Jr. was born in Memphis,
TN, and earned a degree in American

Senate, 1992, was known as the “Year
of the Woman.”

She gained political experience
when serving as a prosecutor in the
U.S. Attorney’s office in 1973, work-
ing in housing, health and environ-
ment. She later won the Attorney Gen—
eral’s Special Achievement Award.

The year after she left the U.S.
Attomey’s office, she won a seat in
the Illinois House of Representa-
tives, focusing on governmental re-
form, education and civil rights. She
angrily ran for a seat in the Senate
when the incumbent voted in 1991 to
confirm Clarence Thomas for the Su-
preme Court. For her ﬁrst six years in
the senate, she was the only African-
American. She has spoken out against
the death penalty, against removing
Saddam Hussein, for abortion rights
and gun control and voted for gay
marriage recognition.

Recently, Braun was in the public
eye again when she resisted a mugger
tried to steal her purse. She has also
made headlines for her organic food
line called Ambassador Organics.

Braun will speak in the convention
late Friday night.

Tracking down the speakers

With some dzﬁiculty, W&L receives top-notch
speakers for this year 3 Mock Convention.

By Queenie Wong
srnrr wmrsn

For the last two years, the Speakers
Committee has worked hard to bring
prominent political leaders to this
weekend’s Mock Convention.

With twelve speakers booked,
Speakers Chair Logan Gibson said
that she’s excited about the upcoming
event.

“I don’t think Mock Convention
has ever had such a strong lineup,”
said Gibson.

This year’s speakers include Vir-
ginia Governor Timothy M. Kaine,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Texas
Rep. Charles Wilson, Chairman of the
Democratic Leadership Council Har-
old Ford Jr., as well as other speakers
the committee believes will become
more politically inﬂuential in the fu-
hue

Although students were hoping
that one of the three main contenders
for the democratic nomination would
make an appearance at the event, the
South Carolina primary this Saturday
made it unlikely that Hilary Clin-
ton, Barack Obama or John Edwards
would come.

“The front-loaded primary season
made it difﬁcult for us to get top notch
speakers, because so many speakers
are stumping for the candidates,” said
Advisory Board Liaison Bill Larson.

Gibson also pointed out that the
Virginia primary isn’t until Feb. 12.
The candidates don’t have much of
an incentive to come down to the uni-
versity, she said. Timing was probably
the most difﬁcult obstacle the com-
mittee faced.

The Speakers Committee includes
nine other students—Natalie Murphy,
Richard Cleary, Taylor Lawch, Hunt-
er Branstetter, Laura Secrest, Dylan
Merrill, Chris Martin, Alex Utsey
and Weston Jones. Gibson assigned
each member about ﬁve speakers to
research and the committee reported
back on their progress weekly. Each
member contributed about four to five
hours per week, cultivating contacts
and trying to book speakers for the
event.

Gibson said the committee used
about two-thirds of its budget, but
would not specify the budget amount.

In 2004, the Mock Convention
raised over $450,000. General Chair-
man Richard Friedman said that this
year’s budget exceeded the amount of
the last event. He, too, would not re-
lease any exact ﬁgures.

In previous Mock Conventions, the
Speakers Committee had a knack for
choosing speakers, who had promis-
ing futures in politics—-Jimmy Carter
in 1972 and Bill Clinton in 1988, just
to name a few.

Gibson said that selecting speak-
ers did involve a lot of insight into the
speakers’ futures, but that the com-
mittee also wanted to target Virginian
leaders.

Gibson praised the committee’s se-
lection of U.S. Sen. Jim Webb as the
keynote speaker.

“He’s a very pivotal figure on the
national scene right now and having
him come to Lexington for this event
is huge,” she said.

about the incident. His neighbor lost
the election. (
While still in the Navy, Wilson

marches in 1965 that were organized by
Martin Luther King, Jr. Two decades
later, Jackson tried to become the ﬁrst

black president in 1984 and again in
1988 and is returning to one of the six
states in which he won the Democratic
primary.

He has travelled the world and
met with American adversaries Hugo
Chavez, Syrian President Bashar Assad,
Fidel Castro and former Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic. He’s
argued for the release of American pris-
oners abroad, peace in the Middle East,
the end of apartheid and against the war
in Iraq. He also served as U.S. special
envoy to Kenya in 1997. In 2000 Bill
Clinton gave Jackson the highest award
possible for a civilian, the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, for his political ac-
tivism. -

Jackson has thrown himself into nu-
merous recent issues, including Terri
Shiavo (the Florida woman with brain
damage), the Duke lacrosse scandal
and Michael Richard’s (Kramer from
Seinfeld) racist outburst.

Jackson has already publicly an-
nounced his support of Barack Obama,
who has spoken on Jackson’s radio
show.

Only in America does the
toughest job have the most
absurd hiring process.

The primary and caucus
system used by political par-
ties to pick their presidential
candidates is outdated, un-
fair and utterly ridiculous.
Americans are beginning to
notice that in order to avoid
another painfully early and
dragged-out campaign sea-
son in four years, the rules
of the game need to be re-
written.

A start would be to turn
the caucuses into actual pri-
maries. To those of us who
do not live in one of the 17
states that holds a caucus,
voting in private seems like
a natural right. Not so in the
caucus system where you
have to publicly state your
preference and make an ar-
gument for your candidate
to convince others. Nor do
you have all day to vote like
you do with regular prima-
ries. Instead you have a set
meeting time and place, and
if you cannot be there then
you obviously don’t matter
enough to have a say.

That means soldiers,
on—duty police ofﬁcers and
ﬁremen, the ill and anyone
unfortunate enough not to
be able to control their work
schedule don’t get a vote.
Do these people not deserve
the right to vote?

Then, debunk the myth
that small states have a di-
vine right to vote ﬁrst and
essentially decide each par-
ty’s candidate. Regardless
of how different they are
from each other, Iowa and
New Hampshire are not
representative of the
nation as a whole.

According to
the Census Bu-
reau, they con-
tain less than
2 percent
of the
total
U.S.

  

  
   
    

CON Primary overhaul

Presidential candidates we can live with? Someday

population. While the na-
tion’s population is over a
quarter minority, minorities
comprise less than 10 per-
cent of Iowa and less than 5
percent of New Hampshire.

The number of voters in
Iowa is so small that, by the
end of caucus night, more
Republicans voted via ab-
sentee ballot in Florida than
took part in the caucuses in
Iowa. Yet, if one candidate
wins both states, he or she
is essentially crowned the
nominee. You can certainly
lose the nomination if you
lose in the ﬁrst two states -
—just ask John Edwards and
Rudy Giuliani in a couple of
months.

The solution is to hold
every primary on the same
day, a “Super-Duper” Tues-
day of sorts. If we hold our
general election on the same
date throughout the country,
why not the primaries?

The last step to ﬁxing the
primary system would en-
sure that radical candidates
on both sides do not have
an unfair advantage. By
appealing to party bases,
those considered very
liberal or very conser-
vative usually have
the advantage in

primaries.

you are registered with a par-

one without general support
gaining a party nomination.
Other states, though, allow
independents to vote in one
of the two party primaries.
This ensures centrists a fair
shot and helps the parties by
giving them a more electable
candidate in the election.

Registering with a party
should be a sign of support,
not the only way one gets
to vote. Thus, every state
should allow independents
to vote in primaries.

While there has been

changing the primary

New Hampshire and Iowa
have yet to lead as wrong

By Scott centorlno
STAFF WRITER

Our mother ducks: Iowa and New Hampshire.
When a group of ducklings crosses the street, a mother duck leads it to
safety. We know that without that mother duck, all the ducklings would confus-
ingly scatter in different directions with no guidance, no sense of judgment and
no experience of safe-crossing. The same is true of our presidential primary system,
speciﬁcally of the early, small states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.

Is very Sum‘ While neither Iowa nor New Hampshire have the population or power to normally
The changes be considered mother ducks in politics, both states have a ﬁne record and experience in
would have showing other duckling states the right way to cross.

to be First off, let’s dispel the theory that these two states have all the power. They do not. It is
glad: South Carolina, not Iowa or New Hampshire, that can say its Republican winner has gone on

to win the GOP nomination every election since 1980. Bill Clinton didn’t win in Iowa or New
Hampshire but found his way to the White House.

Both Iowa and New Hampshire have a long and storied tradition of independent, responsible citi-
zenship above any inﬂuence of national media or outside inﬂuence. ‘

Almost every Democrat and most Republicans would agree that, in hindsight, John McCain probably
would have been the better Republican nominee in 2000. New Hampshire thought so, too. Despite superior
organization and name recognition, two features that would dominate a national primary, New Hampshire’s
brand of door-to-door, retail politics allowed its voters to make a more informed decision.

As someone who has seen presidential candidates during this election in both Iowa and New Hampshire, 1 can

say with certainty how superior voters’ decision-making is given the chance to personally host a candidate in your
home and have a chat.

That is what politics truly is. That is true democracy. It’s up-close. It’s real. Voters don’t form opinions based on televi-
sion commercials. That would simply empower those with money and leave lifeless those without the necessary funds to
voice their message, antithetical to democratic principles.

The ultimate test of a candidate should not be how effectively he can saturate media markets with sappy images of himself.
The true testament to a statesman is his ability to get out there, meet people, connect with regular Americans, make a direct impact
on voter beliefs and step outside plush D.C. ofﬁces.

I want my leader to know me, to know my family, to be able say he’s met me. In that spirit, this nation has gained its strength. I
want to know that he’s been to my town and seen the local problems. '

The counterargument to this, of course, is that the candidate won’t have time to meet every voter in the nation. So, in order to be fair,

we should make it a national primary. That is simply selﬁsh, irresponsible, and ignorant of history. It is the equivalent of a 4-year-old saying
of a classmate, “Timmy has a toy car and I don’t,” and then yelling at the teacher about Timmy’s toy car until the teacher takes it away.

This alternative is a Stalinist nightmare where you only elect people from a distance. No system will achieve perfection, and I am not claim-

ing our current system has. Iowa and New Hampshire do not represent America as a whole, but only in that they think independently, unlike
states which have no tradition of doing so.
How much does a New Hampshire voter have in common with a New Mexico voter? Probably not a great deal. But that New Mexico voter can

still trust New Hampshire voters to make the right choice because of proximity to the candidates and unique perspective and ability to make judg-
ment.
Candidates have been effectively judged by Iowans and New Hampshirites in the past because both groups understand the importance of their decision
and take it seriously. Perhaps considering their shining track records, we should put more emphasis on the two states.
So, I salute you Iowa and New Hampshire. I recognize the work you’ve done for yourselves and for this nation. I wish you the best in thwarting threats from
childish states jealous of your position. And, I hope that for many years to come, presidential candidates will still have to speak on the farms and in the Veterans
of Foreign Wars halls all across your two states.
Your mother duck wisdom has yet to fail us.

Hillary Clinton should not be
the Democratic Party’s nominee.
Period.

For any liberal who actually
wants to see a Democrat in the
Oval come Jan. 21, 2009, the
reasons why should be like a
well-known litany by now.

When I told my editors I
wanted to write an anti-Hillary
piece, they immediately told me
that I better have good reasons.
I needed something more than
“she’s a bitch.” (Writer’s Note —
Can I write that? If you are read-
ing this sentence, dear friend, I
suppose so.)

Now, let’s all be big boys and
girls about this and quit being
ridiculous. The hyperbolic lan-
guage and emotion that Clinton
inspires is downright silly.

I sincerely doubt that very
many people will be moving
to Canada if Senator Clinton is

- electedpresident. Perhaps Pro-

fessor Beckley or Brown will
correct me, but I don’t believe

Hillary Clinton is the ﬁrst horse— 0

man of the apocalypse.
(Although, on a side note,

if Senator Clinton» is to win the

general election, and if we must

  Avoiding the shame: No, Clinton

all ﬂee the country, why in all of

God’s earth are we picking Can—'

ada as the ex-pat destination de
jour? I propose Tahiti or maybe
Rio.)

Perhaps never before in con-
temporary American history has
a ﬁgure managed to be so polar-
izing. Few people have moder-
ated feelings towards Clinton—
she’s either deeply adored or
furiously hated. I

She, accordingly, inspires a
lot of discussion. She is so po-
larizing a ﬁgure that the Repub-
lican’s profound dislike of her is

even affecting their nomination _

race. I think the fact that the Re-
publicans assumed she’s pow-
erful enough to win is actually
what makes her the frontrunner.

In a catch-22, the foregone
conclusion makes it a foregone
conclusion.

Why? There really isn’t any
reason for Clinton to be the
frontrunner she is.

Clintonites always tout her
experience. They use this tactic
especially to draw contrast with
her two strongest rivals, Obama
and Edwards.

But it’s a load of crock. Check

. the math.

Clinton assumed ofﬁce in
2001. She has thus served in the

Senate for (a whopping) six years
(technically, she ’s just begun her
seventh). Obama assumed ofﬁce
in 2005 but served in the Illinois
State Senate for seven years——7

' plus 2 is 9,‘three years more than

Clinton.

Edwards served a six-year
term in the Senate and, thus,
has an equal number of years as
Hillary as a public servant.

And, although all three have
dropped out of the race already,

it should be pointed out that Sen-'

ators Joe Biden and Christopher
Dodd have 60 years in the Sen-
ate between them, while Gov.
Bill Richardson served over 20

years total as a Congressman, ‘

ambassador to the United Na-
tions, Secretary of Energy and
as governor of New Mexico.

Clearly, either Hillary can’t do
math or she is banking on a dif-
ferent deﬁnition of experience to
carry the day. Because, Hil, you
ain’t got squat. Even Kucinich
is whopping you in time in ofﬁce
(12 years in elected office).

No, when Hillary claims she
has experience, she ’s talking
about that ridiculous idea that
her eight years sharing the White
House bed with Bill—most of
the time, that is, Bill, you old
dog—gave her the‘ experience

that the ‘others didn’t get while
they were... umm, I dunno, actu-
ally serving as elected ofﬁcials.

Pillow talk certainly gave
Hillary a perspective on the
presidency all the other candi-
dates in both parties will never
have. But, the capability to have
sex with a president doesn’t re-
ally mean you inherit any of his
experience. (Or if I’m wrong-—
Monica for Congress!)

Even if her time as First Lady
should count as experience, her
record during those years isn’t
anything to brag about. The
health care revamp she led dur-
ing 1994 was a disaster for the
Clinton administration. After
that ﬂop, Clinton spent the re-

mainder of her time in ofﬁce‘

going on banal goodwill trips to
countries that the U.S. actually
couldn’t care less about.

And, incidentally, .being
sent in lieu of her husband for
a photo op with the Prime Min-
ister of Iceland before visiting
an elementary school class and
hopping back on a plane doesn’t
count as foreign policy experi-
ence. '

The bottom line is Hillary has
no more experienced than the
rest of the ﬁeld. Period.

So then why nominate her?

Clinton ’s_ onbz the ﬁontrunner because
the Republicans made her one A

As hated as she is by conserva.
tives everywhere, why risk so-
lidifying the conservative base
for whichever poor sucker wins
the Republican nod (I’m putting
a dollar on McCain) by nominat-
ing Hil?

The Democrats have a unique
opportunity—they could easily
use the disarray that the Repub-
licans are feeling because of a)
eight years of a terribly unpop-
ular President and b) a brutal
nomination ﬁght to sweep back
into the White House.

‘T hey could easily neutralize
any of the tired ‘old white men
who could be the Republican

nod by nominating Obama (di— 4’

versity) or Edwards (energy).

They could easily claim the
grounds of change, of hope, of
ending the war, of a fresh start.

But, instead of a fresh start,
the Democratic party is commit-
ting collective political suicide
by even considering a blast from
the past.

It’s simple——Hillary may be
the best candidate, but it doesn’t
matter. After the last 20 years
of Bush-Clinton-Bush, even
Americans aren’t stupid enough
to keep the pattern going.

It’s time for a fresh start.

ice: Barack Obama

He can inspire, solvenational issues and change the world

In a year when the Democratic Party is
so evenly divided between two strong can-
didates,'it seems fitting that our editorial
board was also divided. The vote between
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama split us
almost right down the middle.

Despite the divide, we’ve made our de-
cision. ~

Barack Obama deserves to be the nomi-
nee at the Centennial Mock Convention.

Obama offers our nation a chance to
move forward and step beyond the bitter
wrangling that has paralyzed Washington,
DC. in the last 15 years.

There’s no question that Hillary is a
great policy expert, well versed on almost
every major issue facing our country. We

o think she would be a strong president.

In a debate last week, Clinton said she
envisioned being a hands-on president,
handling big and small issues from the
Oval Ofﬁce. Obama took the opposite tack,‘
saying he wants to spend his time planning
the country’s overall direction while let-
ting his staff handle the details.

But we don’t need a policy wonk in the
White House right now.

We need a visionary leader, someone
who can inspire our citizens again and give
us new ideas about solving the great prob-
lems of the 21st century. ,

Obama offers that hope, that vision.
He can be our generation’s John F. Ken-
nedy or Ronald Reagan. Those men used
the Oval Oﬁice as a platform to lead and
inspire the nation.

Almost every Obama speech ends
with the call to duty: “Let’s go change the
world.”

How can Hillary’s policy expertise
match that? The short answer: it can’t.

The next president will inherit a deeply
divided nation unsure of how we should
handle Iraq, the continued hunt for Bin
Laden and a host of other issues.

The new president will have to navigate
a poisonous political atmosphere that has
made it virtually impossible for Democrats
and Republicans to work with each other
on any important issue.

There’s just no way the Clintons can
heal these partisan wounds and get Ameri-
ca moving forward again. _

Nothing makes Republicans dig in their
heels more than the sight of the Clintons.

And as Bill’s bullying ego trip contin-
ues across America (calling Obama’s Iraq
positions a fairy tale in New Hampshire
and then whining about how the big, bad
Nevada unions are out to get poor 01’ Hill-
ary), we’re left to wonder why anyone
wants to return to the'drama-ﬁlled days of
his presidency. .

In fact, most of Bill’s speeches during
this campaign seem to mention him far
morethan they mention his wife. Who are
we voting for here?

Here’s what Bill doesn’t realize: Ameri-
cans want the economic boom of the 1990s
back, but they don’t want Bill to come
along in the time machine. Besides, the in-
temet boom created those great economic
days, not anything he did.

That’s what both Clintons just don’t
get. '

Our generation is tired of listening to
old politicians whine and argue from the
same political positions.

We’re sick of hearing them take credit
for things they didn’t do.

We’ve heard the Clintons before and
know what they have to say. America is
ready for new ideas, a new vision.

The second Bush presidency was far
worse than the ﬁrst one; Is anyone worried
that we might see the same pattern with the
Clintons?

Obama can take us beyond this rancor
and melodrama that Hillary’s nomina-

tion would promise. He can take this na- .

tion into a post-partisan world, ﬁnally get
young Americans excited about politics
and start the next great American era.‘

Hillary’s the safe choice, the vote you
make with your head.

Obama’s the inspiring choice, the vote
you make with your heart.

This weekend, go with your heart and
vote ‘for Obama.

Are you ﬁred up? Get ready to go.

West Virginia,

By Andrew Connelly and
Brett Holton
STAFF wRm:Rs

Students across campus have
been bombarded with the news
surrounding Mock Convention,
but how many are familiar with
the delegations? We sat down
with several State Chairs to ex-
plore the personal side of Mock
Convention.

Wesley O’Dell, the State
Chair of West Virginia, is mak-
ing sure that his delegation per-
forms to its fullest capabilities.

“West Virginia is very seri-
ous about its research and pre-
diction,” said O’Dell. “Mock
Con. is such an important facet
of W&L li-fe — we deﬁnitely want
to do what we can to continue its
tradition of excellence.”

But for O’Dell, the parties are
just as important.

“The social events surround-
ing Mock Con are an integral part
of the experience,” he said. “We

In all honesty, I am truly not
stressed about Mock Conven-
tion. However, you must con-
sider the fact that I am a fresh-
man delegate. The extent of my
participation in this inimitable
event has been the purchase of
a t-shirt and maybe contributing
a few dollars for a commemora-
ti-ve shot glass. Despite my elev-
enth hour efforts, I do realize that
copious amounts of work have
gone into preparation for this
week and weekend. The state
chairs of mock convention have
voluntarily conceded to assume
a large part of the responsibility
for the success of this affair.

Unbeknownst to many, the
role of a state chair began last
year. Since last winter term,
Washington and Lee’s student
leaders have been applying for
positions, mailing in their re-
sumes and going through an in-
terview process. Fortunately for
those interested, the university’s
small community facilitated po-

nthusiastic state chairs speak up

Michigan, Alaska and Hawaii chairs share their excitement and nerves

already had a great Gala last fall
and we look forward to enjoying
the various delegation parties

- this week—particularly an event

we and a few other small states
have combined to host.”

Neil Sheaffer is the State
Chair of Michigan, a state that

“It’s disappointing to be sure,
but there’s nothing we can do
about it,” he said. “[Our] del-
egation is all about ﬁnding ways
to enjoy the convention, like by
building a fun ﬂoat, even though
we will have no say in who the
nominee will be.”

“Mock Con. is such an important facet of W&L

lif —- we deﬁnitely want to do what we can to
continue its tradition of excellence... T he social
events surrounding Mock Con are (also) an
integral part of the experience. ”

Wesley 0’Dell, West Virginia state chair

in the actual political arena lost
its delegates when it moved the
primaries to‘ January 15"‘, break-
ing the rules of the Democratic
National Convention.

But this hasn’t deterred She-
affer from enjoying Mock Con.

Sheaffer regrets the DNC’s
decision to strip the state of its
delegates. He says Michigan
has a lot at stake in this election,
citing its shrinking population,
and the search for alternative
energy, which will beneﬁt both

the statc’s auto industry and the
farmers who produce corn for
ethanol.

Especially interesting is the
approach taken by the smaller
delegations representing Amer-
ica’s more remote and often
overlooked areas. For Robert
Wilson, the Alaska State Chair,
the reality of having few genuine
Alaskans at W & L has a price.

“No one in our delegation is

actually from Alaska, so we’ve
all had to do some basic research
on the political climate there.
Only three [out of ﬁfteen] of us
have even been there.”

Compounding this is the lack
of interest shown in Alaska by
the mainstream media.

“Research has been tough, as
there have been no ofﬁcial polls
taken in Alaska to gauge the sta-
tus of the Democratic race.”

This problem has also been
noted by the Hawaii State Chair
Grace Andrews. '

I “There is no polling data and
a lot of major candidates don’t
care. This makes our decision a
hard one. Local newspapers are
often the only source of data and
they are potentially biased.”

This has been a hindrance, but
hasn’t stopped Andrews and her
delegation from delving deeply
into Hawaii’s unique local politi-
cal scene. Close contacts with
local political participants like
Michael McCartney, the Demo-
cratic Party Leader in the state,
and Richard Boreka,‘ a lead-
ing Hawaiian columnist, have
helped Andrews and her team
stay on top of their research.
The unique nature of Hawaiian
politics also helps to keep things
interesting.” ‘

“Hawaii has an fascinat-
ing political environment, that
doesn’t follow many of the pat-
terns in the rest of the US. There
are lots of independents and the
partisan atmosphere common

79

elsewhere is lacking somewhat.

As an example,‘ she offers
up the candidacy of Dennis Ku-
cinich for the 2004 Democratic
presidential nomination. Ig-
nored by the media and not even
on the ballot in many states he
managed to come second behind
John Kerry in Hawaii’s primary

. with 31 percent of the votes.

As with the Alaska, the Ha-
waii delegation has few native
members (one out of the twenty
seven was born there and moved
away at any early age), but An-
drews maintains that the charac-
ter of the islands is strong enough
to bring the group together.

“We are an eclectic group,
like the islands themselves. We
all come from different back-
grounds, geographically, social-
ly and academically. We were
brought together by Hawaii’s
exhilarating and mysterious na-
ture.”

of Mock Con share their thoughts

discuss some of the trials and tribulations of heading delegations

sitions for all those who were

interested. “Mock convention is

great because it allows everyone

to contribute their own special
talents,” said West Virginia State
Chair Wes O’Dell, “The poli-
tics people, social people, press
people and so many more can be
a part of the making of history.”
Interestingly enough, all of these
men and women consented to
this procedure without a full un‘-
derstanding of what each step
would entail. “To me, the inter-
view was hilarious, because I go
in and there’s a line of people,”
recalls Puerto Rico State Chair
Aisha Davis, “We’re all thinking
that we have no idea what's go-
ing on right now.”

Jordan Wilson’s experience
was a little different. As the only
freshman state chair, the ambi-
tious student stands out. “Over
the summer, I sent out-emails to
the directors of Mock Con. to see
ifl could help out...l found out
that the position in Guam was
open and my name got recom-
mended and I got interviewed for
it....I think that I’m living proof
that if you’re interested in some-

thing here, you can ﬁnd some
outlet for it.”

The state chairs are respon-
sible for managing their delega-
tion. They are the lucky few who
have the privilege of sending out
the mass emails about meetings,
t-shirts and ﬂoat construction.
According to'Arizona State Chair
Justin McKeen, “Most impor-
tantly, a. state chair is in charge
of directing delegates under his
state and coming up with, hope-
fully, a correct prediction for
how his state is going to vote.”
The delegations are responsible
for determining their position by
extrapolating from the research
done by both the state chair and
his or her research chair. “The
biggest and most important one
[responsibility],” in the opin-
ion of Maine State Chair James
Dick, “is researching: state polls,
newspapers, blogs, talking to
people within that state in order
to understand what the people in
that state are looking for.”

However, a project this large
entails complicated planning and
logistics on the part of its leaders.
Every state had its own share of

problems. “My delegation was

pretty small, about sixteen peo-

ple. So anytime that I needed
something done, I needed ev-
eryone to be there. As opposed
to larger delegations like Texas
and Virginia, who can send out
a mass email and get twenty vol-
unteers,” said Tennessee State

don’t speak Spanish. So when I
was on the phone I’d always be
looking for someone who spoke
English,” Davis said. However,
a _lack of information was another
obstacle that the state chairs had
to battle. “[The] most particular
obstacle,” for James Dick, “is

that Maine is not considered by

“A state chair is in charge of directing

delegates under his state and coming up

with, hopefully, a correct prediction for

how his state is going to vote. ’

J

Justin McKeen, Arizona state chair

Chair, Rebecca LeMoine. Be-
sides size, distance continually

thwarted research and communi-

cation. “I had to send out emails
that would cross the internation-
al dateline,” remembers Jordan
Wilson. While Jordan had to
overcome intemational barri-
ers, Aisha Davis had to triumph
over the language barrier. “Even
though I chose Puerto Rico, I

the national media to be an im-
portant part of the nomination
process, so there was a dearth of
polls.”

Despite all the difﬁculties, the
state chairs still have interesting
moments and a myriad of events
to enjoy thisweekend. When
asked what his most unique ex-
perience was, James Dick im-
mediately answered, “Buying a

lobster costume for one of my
fraternity brothers to wear on the
Mock Convention ﬂoat. I don’t
know what I ’in going to do when
Mock Con. is over.”

Davis recalls the two hour
long t-shirt planning meeting and
a certain gift comes to McKeen’s
mind.

“One of my contacts in Tus-
con was a W&L alum. When he
heard that I was a state chair for
Mock Convention, he gave me a
bottle of Jim Bean that was es-
pecially made for W&L’s Mock
Con. when he was a student.”

The state chairs are looking

' forward to rest, relaxation and

the enjoying the events planned
for the convention itselﬁ Nota-
ble speakers, such as Jesse Jack-

son and Tim Kaine, will be con- ’

tributing words to the ceremony.
Still, others are ready to bask
in the pleasure of smaller gifts.
“I’m just happy thatil won’t have
to send out mass emails any-
more,” admits LeMoine.

Through the years

 After I 00 years, convention has
seen its share of highs and lows

 

1908

After a visit by populist William
Jennings Bryan, students get to-
gether and hold a replica of the
real Democratic Convention. The
event gets off to an excellent start,
but the debate over whether to
nominate Bryan or Minnesota Gov.
John A. Johnson soon turns ugly,
as ﬁghts break out in the Kansas
delegation and several other spots
on the Convention floor. The 2008
convention, like the 1908 conven-
tion, will be held in Denver. At the
1908 affair, Bryan's victory gave
W&L its first correct prediction.

1924

After a record-setting number of
ballots, W&L students select John
W. Davis, an undergraduate and
law alumnus, who served as a
Congressman from West Virginia,
Solicitor General and Ambassador
to Great Britain. At that summer’s
convention, Davis, who received
only three percent of the delegates
on the first ballot, was finally elect-
ed after 103 ballots, a record that
will likely never be broken. Unfor-
tunately, Davis gets massacred in
the election by Republican Calvin
Coolidge, who wins 54 percent of
the vote while Davis earns less
than 29 percent.

1956

Former Vice President Alben Bar-
kley, who returned to the Senate
after his term as Vice President
ended, gives the keynote speech.
in front ofa cheering crowd, he de-
clares, “For I would rather be a ser-
vant in the house of the Lord than
to sit in the seats of the mighty.”
As the crowd cheers, Barkley col-
lapses and dies almost instantly.
At the urging of Barkley‘s widow,
the convention eventually resumes

and picks Adlai Stevenson.

1960

Former President Harry Truman
helps dedicate a memorial to
Barkley and then delivers the key-

0

note address. Early voting puts
Stevenson on top again, but the
staff doesn't have enough adding
machines to calculate the votes.
While the convention waits, several
delegations switch their votes to
John F. Kennedy, sending him on
his way to the White House.

19721

A fierce debate breaks out between
supporters of George McGovern
and Ted Kennedy. Kennedy wins
the W&L nod, but McGovern gets
the win at the real convention.
After McGovern gets hammered
by Nixon, some students wonder
if the convention had a better feel
for the national political climate
than the Democratic Party did.

Jimmy Carter, than the obscure
governor of Georgia, addresses
the convention.

1988

Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, already
a rising star in the Democratic
Party, speaks at Mock Convention.
But the real excitement comes that
night at Zo|lman's Pavilion, when
Clinton hops up on stage tojam out
on a saxophone.

2004 1

Despite the noisy protests of a few
Deaniacs, John Kerry cruises to vic-
tory. Democratic strategist James
Carville, sometimes known as the
Rajun Cajun, bashes the GOP in
his keynote address.

“Save my children,” was all he
said. It was all he needed to say.
The audience, already energized by
the presence of as notable a ﬁgure
as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, repeated
after him: “Save my families. Save
my environment. Stop the war.”

The centennial Mock Conven-
tion was in full swing.Friday as
Jackson took the stage; he was
preceded by two other Democratic
icons: former congresswoman and
vice-presidential candidate Geral-
dine Ferraro and former senator and
Vietnam veteran Max Cleland.

‘Honored to be at this place’

Jackson prefaced his remarks
with warm words for the other at-
tending dignitaries and for W&L
itself. “I’m honored to be at this
place, at this time,” he said.

His speech, an eloquent and
emotional address, immediately

MOCN CON picks  1|

touched upon the issue at hand:
the Democratic primary. Jackson
called the impending South Caro-
lina primary, the ﬁrst test for the-

‘Democratic candidates in a state

with signiﬁcant numbers of Af-
rican-American voters, a test ‘for
the American political system as a
whole: “our maturity is at stake, our
character is being tested.”

Jackson went on to decry what
he called the separation of the na-
tion’s “moral center” from its “po-
litical center.” He also criticized
voting rights irregularities in the
2000 and 2004 elections, declaring
that “we deserve a better America
than that.”

,. Greek leaders develop Vision council

Alcohol abuse, risky behavior on Tear Night spark ideas to improve student health

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING sonoa

Two weeks after Greek rush
week resulted in disciplinary
sanctions against multiple fra-
ternities, and a full health center
on Tear Night, Greek leaders are
launching a new plan to address
problems in the fraternity system.

Incoming Inter-fratemity

‘ Council President and current Ju-

nior Justice Alex Duckworth said
work began on the document the
Monday and Tuesday after Tear
Night.

“We want this to be something
students think is a good idea,”
Duckworth said.

According to Director of Cam-
pus Activities Jason Rodocker, the
document will act as a constantly
evolving barometer of Washing-
ton and Lee’s Greek system.

The current version describes
a Greek system struggling with
alcohol abuse, harassment of
Traveller drivers, hazing prob-
lems, women seeking the morn-
ing after pill after unprotected
sex and sexual assault rates that
continue to exceed the national
collegiate average.

“Basically, Tear Night was
the catalyst” for the document,
Rodocker said.

Both Rodocker and Duckworth
said problems with the fraternity
rush began before the Tear Night
parties resulted in students being
admitted to the health center and

democracy” originally conceived
by the founders~—a democracy
with the franchise limited to a
landowning class.

He praised the Democratic
ﬁeld’s diversity and willingness
to vigorously debate the best di-
rection course for the nation while
condemning the “mutlichrome
debatelessness” of the Republi-
can candidates.

Touching brieﬂy on policy
recommendations, Jackson drew
applause from the predominantly
college-age crowd for his call to
increase Pell grants in order to
ease the ﬁnancial burdens on stu-
dents.

“Too few in college, too many
in jail,” he said.

Jackson also called for invest-
ment in infrastructure such as
roads, bridges, and schools, and
called for strong action to “put
American back to work” and to
address what he called the “sub—
prime crisis” in the housing mar-
ket.

He closed by admonishing
a government that he believes
leaves “poor people exposed” and
“ﬁghts terror with terror.”

“I dream of the day when we
will honor the promise of fairness
 of equality,” he said, “It’s time

“It was kind of shocking to
see some things we seemed to

be making progress on go back-‘

wards,” Rodocker said.

According to philosophy pro-
fessor Melina Bell, who serves on
the Student Affairs Committee,
these types of incidents give fac-
ulty a negative view of the Greek
system.

“Students can learn real leader-
ship and address problems in the
community [through the Greek
system],” Bell said.

“Faculty members who were
Greek see it as a social organiza-
tion but also as other things like
a chance to learn leadership and
service.”

Bell said the faculty doesn’t
mind the fact that students drink.
What does concern them, she
said, is how prevalent alcohol ap-
pears to be at W&L.

“There is concern for stu-
dent health, and it draws energy
away from learning,” Bell said.
“People are more tired; alcohol
impairs memory and takes time
away from studying and events
that could broaden horizons.”

A weekend of problems

For the IFC, problems began
the Thursday night of rush week,
a night more commonly known as
bid night. IFC ofﬁcers regularly
noticed that members at both Pi
Kappa Phi and Kappa Alpha were
serving alcohol to freshmen, a di-
rect violation of rules that prohibit

for achange.” _ .

address, Jackson elaborated on
his policy vision. He called for
a new national vision along the
lines of the New Deal to address
the ailing economy at home and
a policy of engagement with Iran
and Syria abroad.

“We need a foreign policy not
foreign to our values,” he said.

When asked about the legacy
young people should receive,
Jackson expressed his hope that
he could pass down to his grand-
child “a sense that she matters,
a sense of religion, a sustaining
force.”

He also touched ‘brieﬂy on
his own upbringing, stressing
in particular the importance of
hard work and temperance; he
explained that he does not drink
to this day because he saw as a
young man too many hard—work-
ing friends “get drunk and lose all
self-respect on the weekends.”

While Jackson did not wish to
sway student opinion one way or
another, he was not shy about de-
claring his own allegiance: “I’m
voting for Barack,” he said.

‘Most serious election of my
lifetime’

Earlier Friday, delegates heard
remarks from former congress-
woman Geraldine Ferraro. Fer-
raro, the first woman nominated

alcohol from being served during
formal rush.

The IFC handed the two fra-
ternities social probation for two
weeks, a $5 per member ﬁne and
conduct probation, which means
that if the fraternities violate rush
rules next year, they’ll face a dis-
ciplinary strike from the IFC.

Current IFC President Chris
Womom said the problems at
the two houses were conﬁned to
just a few members and weren’t
house-wide.

Things only got worse Friday,
a supposed no-contact night that
was designed to give freshmen
time to think about which house
they want to join.

But IFC discovered that most
fraternities had set up parties Fri-
day night where freshmen could
go to an empty house and help
themselves to copious amounts of
beer and liquor.

No upperclassmen were pres-
ent at most houses, so no-Contact
rules were not technically vio-
lated. But according to Rodocker
and Duckworth, the events clearly
abused the spirit of the no-contact
rules. _

, Since so many houses were
caught, the council decided to
forgo disciplinary measures and
instead focus on writing new rules
that will prevent the recurrence of
these parties next year.

“Rules like this come about
because people exploit loopholes
in the principles” of rush week,
Rodocker said. i

Senator Hillary Clinton’s presi-
dential campaign.

In addition to Clinton’s record
and policy stances, Ferraro was a
particular fan of another one of
her qualiﬁcations: “I really like
the fact that she’s a woman,” she
said.

Declaring that the nation is

5 -ready for a woman chief execu-

tive, Ferraro went on to say that,
had Walter “Fritz” Mondale won
the 1984 election, she would have
been elected in 1992 and “the
whole issue would’ve been de-
cided.” -
She remarked on how much
has changed in recent times—de-
claring that, for the ﬁrst time
in United States history, “being

white and male is a disadvantage” I

in a presidential campaign.

Ferraro spoke hopefully about
the role of youth in the political
process, declaring that young
people possess a “baloney-meter”
that can detect the authenticity of
the candidates.

She expanded upon this theme
in a press conference following
her speech, praising the student
body for its political awareness;
she suggested the voter turnout
of W&L students in the coming
election would almost certainly be
ahead of the nation as a whole.

But problems in the Greek
system aren’t just conﬁned to fra-
ternities.

As the ﬁrst draft of the Greek
vision said, “Sorority women
show up at fraternity parties hav-
ing already gotten drunk beyond
the point of good decision mak-
ing.”

Jackie DiBiasie, the incoming
Panhellenic president, said the
sororities would be working hard
to address the issues in the docu-
ment.

“We recognize it is an equal
problem on the guys and girls
sides,” DiBiasie said.

A full health center

Dr. Jane Horton, director of
student health, said this year’s
Tear Night was the busiest in
about 10 years.

“We were busier here than all
fall,” Horton said. “People were
celebrating in high-risk ways.”

And though every bed and
couch in the health center was
full with a mix of students suffer-
ing from regular illnesses or from
alcohol problems, Horton said
the staff managed to handle the
crunch of students without having
to call in extra staff.

According to Duckworth, the
IFC president, some students were
sent to the hospital with blood al-
cohol levels that approached or
exceeded .30 percent. The legal
driving limit for 21-year-olds in
Virginia is .08 percent.

Horton also said that use of

 She also.,discussed upon the _
‘state of the campaign leading up

to what she called in her speech
“the most important election of
my lifetime.” She declared that
women “are never allowed to
cry in politics” while disput-
ing the claim that Sen. Clinton’s
eleventh-hour show of emotion
helped her achieve victory in a
close New Hampshire primary.

Regardless of who wins the
primary, she expressed conﬁ-
dence that Democrats will “come
together at the convention.”

She also expressed her ap-
preciation for fellow speaker and
former colleague Charlie Wilson:
“He’s better looking than Tom
Hanks,” she said of the former
Congressman.

‘What the hell?’

Former senator Max Cleland
delivered a rousing speech to the
convention that was part polemic
and part comedy.

He opened by quoting Benja-
min Franklin’s famous line that
he had given the people “a repub-
lic  if [they could] keep it” and
praised the student body’s partici-
pation as a ﬁne example of such
“keeping.”

However, he qualiﬁed his
statement by remarking that, if
Franklin were to walk into the
gym that day, he would probably
exclaim “What the hell?”

emergency contraceptives, or
Plan B, by female students was
more prevalent after Tear Night.

“We always see a Plan B blip
on big weekends like Orienta-
tion, Homecoming and Christmas
Weekend,” Horton said. “The
number of prescriptions we gave
out [after Tear Night] was in line
with those levels.”

Horton said the she sees a
direct correlation between high-
risk alcohol use and the number
of Plan B doses requested by
students. W&L still administers
Plan B as a prescription, but stu-
dents can receive the dose from a
nurse and do not have to see one
of the center’s two doctors.

DiBiasie said the sororities
would continue to educate their
members about the link between
drinking and unprotected sex.

She said sorority women also
continue to be distressed by the
high level of sexual assaults.

“Alcohol is linked to that, so
hopefully after alcohol use goes
down, assaults will go down
too.” ‘

Bell said the faculty members
often wonder why W&L students
seem to spend so little time inter-
acting with members of the oppo-
site sex.

Closing the gap

The remainder of his speech
dealt with far more serious is-
sues. ~

“We are in as grave a situation
since World War II,” he declared,
launching into a lengthy discourse
against war in general and the Iraq
war in particular.

“War has become a part of the
institutional fabric of our country,
and that’s not the way it’s sup-
posed to be,” he said, adding that
it is “immoral” to keep American
troops in Iraq. The president and
secretary of defense, he said after-
ward, are “continuing this descent
into hell [by sending] these kids

ministration is bankrupt.”

of different Greek chapters.

“This school needs and is
ready for change, but drastic
change won’t work,” Duckworth
said. '

He said that constant evolu-
tion will help fraternities move
forward. i

“The fraternity I joined fresh-
man year and the one I’m in now
are not the same chapter, in a good
way,” Duckworth said.

To get more chapter members
involved, a Greek vision council
is being formed to continually re-
view and discuss the document.

Womom said that fraternity
members don’t necessarily have
to help develop the vision, but he
said members realize that change
is coming to the system.

“They do need to understand
why it’s important,” Womom
said. “If we achieve that a lot of
things will fall into place.”

Bell said she also sees the sep-
aration between student leaders
and chapter members.

“I see a big disconnect be-
tween what leaders do and want
to do and student expectations.”

Bell said that the faculty wants
to see the Greek system improve
and has been impressed with the
response of student leaders in the
Greek system.

“They have the right attitude
and potential to make changes,”
Bell said.

“The most pressing concern
is how much students drink and
how often.”

Three panhellenic sororities Vie for single spot at W&L

Sorority women will vote for sixth chapter to join campus next fall, changes in recruitment will beneﬁt newcomer

By Jacob Gelger
MANAGING EDITOR

After years of work, Wash-
ington and Lee University is just
weeks away from ﬁnalizing plans
to bring a sixth Panhellenic soror-
ity to campus.

After Panhellenic Council
reviewed applications from 11
sororities, three — Phi Mu, Alpha
Delta Pi and Delta Delta Delta
— were selected as ﬁnalists.

Each of the ﬁve existing soror-
ities will rank the candidates from
1-3, and the sorority with the
highest score will become W&L’s
newest chapter.

“With fraternities, you have 14
options, whereas girls only have
ﬁve,” said Lauren Ottaway, who

led Panhellenic’s extension — or
sorority recruitment — efforts.

The new chapter will colonize
on campus next winter during
formal recruitment. Though the
chapter will not have a house next
year, the university has agreed to
build a sixth sorority house that
will open no later than fall 2011.
The house will be located next to
the Kappa Kappa Gamma house.

A 2005 attempt to add a new
sorority collapsed because the
school and national sorority could
not reach an agreement over how
— and when — a new house would
be built.

Ottaway [said she and other
sorority women looked closely at
the candidates to make sure they

understood W&L’s culture.

“You can deﬁnitely tell who
had been to campus and looked
things up,” she said.

Senior Jess Cobb, who just
ﬁnished a term as president of Pi
Beta Phi, said Panhellenic also
looked for a sorority that would
complement the current houses.

“We looked for different types
of programming, different philan-
thropy,” Cobb said.

Dana Smith, the assistant di-
rector of student activities and
Greek life, said the main purpose
of adding a new chapter was to re-
duce the size of sororities.

“Students come to W&L for
a small, close—knit community,”
Smith said, “and they want that in

student life as well as in the class-
room.”

The current chapters started
the year with between 73-100
members and then added 35-40
new members during rush.

Once the new sorority reaches
full capacity, each chapter would
hopefully have an average size of
70 and then add 20-25 new mem-
bers each winter.

To help the new sorority reach
capacity, it will be able to offer 70
bids next winter while other so-

‘rorities will only be able to extend

about 25. That number will not
officially be set until next fall.
Recruitment efforts will be led
by national ofﬁcers from the so-
rority and women from chapters

at nearby schools. Smith said this
practice is common when new
sororities colonize at a school.
Members of W&L’s Kappa Alpha
Theta chapter helped a new chap-
ter at James Madison University
get off the ground in the fall.

The _three ﬁnalists will be on
campus this week for presenta-
tions that will be open to the pub-
lic. Alpha Delta Pi will be here
on Jan. 31, followed by Delta
Delta Delta on Feb. 5 and Phi
Mu on Feb. 7. All presentations
will start at 7:30 p.m. in the Elrod
Commons’ theater, with smaller
discussions scheduled to take
place after each presentation in a
room upstairs.

To vote, women must attend

all three presentations.

And though the new chapter
won’t have a house for girls to
live in, Ottaway said there will be
other selling points for the new
sorority.

“A major selling point is to
be a founding member and see a
sorority come into fruition,” Ot-
taway said. “It also lets sopho-
mores and juniors come in and
take strong leadership roles right
away.”

Jackie ‘DiBiasie, the incom-
ing Panhellenic president, agreed
with Ottaway.

”“You have no house, but you
have the opportunity to create a
new sorority,” DiBiase said. “lt’s
a chance to set precedent.”

We may have chosen Clinton, but youth not guaranteed to vote come November

At 8:00 Friday night, Mock
Convention ﬁnally made
sense. ' '

It was truly moving to look
out across a packed house of
students in ties, dresses and
those funny little hats as for-
mer Sen. Max Cleland and
Rev. Jesse Jackson captivated
the crowd.

Years of planning, recruit-
ing speakers, signing up dele-
gates and a bitterly cold parade
ﬁnally paid off.

Many of us probably didn’t
agree with parts of Jackson’s
speech. Alter all, he focused
on race in a year when the can-
didate he supports — Barack
Obama — is talking about mov-
ing beyond race and looking
into the 21st century for a new,
bi-racial coalition.

In a way, Jackson’s speech
was a perfect example of the
divide that separates Obama
and our generation from people
like the Clintons and Jackson.

Regardless of each dele-
gate’s politics, it was exciting
to see a campus.

We may have enjoyed hear-
ing people like Gov. Tim Kaine
and Sen. Jim Webb, but this
convention really belonged
to Del. Attorney Gen. Beau
Biden, Texas Rep. Patrick Rose
and former Rep. Harold Ford,
Jr. Those three men are the
next generation of leaders, and
it was clear from the reception
they received that students are
excited about the future these
men represent.

Mock Convention prob-
ably describes our school and

culture better than any other
event.

The hard work across the
board was obvious. Incredible
ﬂoats (did you see the Arkan-
sas and Georgia delegations?)
mixed with — we hope — incred-
ible political savvy.

And because we’re W&L,
we took time out to laugh at
ourselves and make sure the
Texans on campus remembered
that they’re just another state,
not their own nation. And, in
case you forgot, Colorado is
the highest state in the nation.

It may be weeks before we
know who wins the Democrat-
ic nod, but this much is clear:
despite the overwhelming sig-
nal that more students support
Obama than Clinton, each del-
egation voted with its head in-

stead of its heart.

Though Cllinton won yes-
terday’s vote, our convention
should serve as a warning to
her. Young voters — both on
this campus and across the na-
tion — are a huge wild card for
the primaries and the general
election.

If Obama can emerge with
the nomination, these Voters
might be the block that guar-
antees a victory against his
Republican opponent (assum-
ing, of course, that the GOP is
eventually able to pick a can-
didate).

Will these young voters turn
out for Clinton in November?
Or will they stay home and
decide that their parents and
grandparents ‘are too dumb to
pay attention to the youth?

When asked, most of the
speakers seemed conﬁdent that
W&L students will vote in No-
vember regardless of who the
parties nominate. They’re tak-
ing the student vote for granted,
convinced that this important
election will have high turnout
regardless of the candidates.

This idea is foolish and
naive. Students won’t vote in
November unless they think
one of the candidates will lis-
ten to the younger generation‘
and move beyond the pointless
bickering that has left so many
young Americans fed up with
politics.

We may have picked Clin-
ton, but unless she changes
her tune, she shouldn’t expect
many of our votes in Novem-
ber.

Mock Con continues time-honored traditions

Strong, promising Democratic leaders who speak on relevant issues a privilege to listen to

By Jess Stelnmetz
COLUMNIST

Unlike many seniors, I only
had the small role as a delegate
in Mock Convention. While I
did not take advantage of the
opportunity to become further
involved, I still believe it was
a more rewarding experience
than it would have been if I
were a freshman.

Since I moved to Lexing-
ton, the classes I have taken
and my experiences have
made this weekend even more
meaningful. Without Professor
Beckley’s poverty class, the
speakers who focused on pov-
erty would have not had such
a profound impact. Similarly,
without Professor’s Mitchell’s
class on election media cover-
age, I would have barely known
Harold Ford’s name.

Knowing the details of his
political history allowed me to
further appreciate his inspiring
words.

I had little connection with
Virginia freshman year and still
found it diﬂicult to even imag-

ine that I lived in the South of
all places. Now I actually say I
live in Virginia without think-
ing twice, which made hearing
Virginia Governor Kaine, Vir-
ginia Senator Webb, andRich-
mond Mayor Wilder even more
consequential.

As a senior, my perspective
on voting is far different than
it was as a college freshman.
I will soon be graduating and
leaving “college life” behind
me. As a freshman, my focus
was on the nextlfour years of
my life, which is certainly not
the case now.

When voting for president,
it is crucial to look at more than
just the next four years. Politi-
cal issues now have an impact
on my life as a working indi-
vidual rather than a student.
I believe most freshmen are
looking at politics as a student
where seniors are starting to
view it differently.

Thankfully, graduation is
approaching and we will soon
be entering the workforce.
Thus, we will soon have a
vested interest in the dreaded

topic of taxes. Since all candi-
dates address the issue of taxes,
this is a far more relevant issue
for graduating seniors than for
freshmen. While I have been
paying taxes since I ﬁrst moved
here, it becomes more crucial
of an issue since my meager
paycheck will be soon rising.

For the masses of students
who left Friday night after
Jesse Jackson’s speech, you
not only made Washington and
Lee students appear rude but
you also missed a unique op-
portunity. Texas State Repre-
sentative Rose, former Senator
Moseley Braun and Richmond
Mayor Wilder all gave inspir-
ingspeeches that deserved the
undivided attention of the stu-
dent body.

My favorite part of Mose-
ley’s speech was her anecdote
about her reason for running
for president. For those who
missed it, her 10-year-old niece
was highly disturbed when she
looked in her history book and
only saw the pictures of boys
as president.

Waller and co’. declared—
without a hint of indeci-
sion—that Hillary Clinton
would win the White House.

Their prediction was the
product of countless hours
of research by them, the state
chairs and scores of other
students.

They probably gave us
the right answer. Hillary will
probably win the Democratic
nomination.

Damn.

The thing that struck me
about the scene is this—we
could not have engineered a
better picture of the problem
with our generation voting.

Obama is an exciting can-
didate.

The youngest voters have
adopted him as the next JFK,
the next great inspirational
American leader. He excites
young voters in a way that no
other candidate can.

At Mock Con we were
supposed to play house.

We were supposed to pre-
tend we were the delegates
who are headed to the DNC
in Colorado later this year.

These delegates—our

Mock Con research teams
tell us—like Hillary. They

“Sweetie, girls can be president,
too,” was what she then saw as
a white lie. It later inspired her
to not let that lie stand, and she
ran for president. When I met
and shook hands with Carol
Mosley Brown, I was struck by
the fact that she is an amazing
woman who has made signiﬁ-
cant differences for women in
politics.

Although I would hate to’

think this is the year that breaks
our record, I cannot help but
wish we predicted wrong and
that ‘Barack Obama will be our
next president. As Governor
Kaine suggests, Barack Obama,
“is about bringing people to-
gether and about unifying this
nation.” After all, can you re-
ally picture a Clinton bringing
Republicans and Democrats
together?

Although I sincerely be-
lieve it is far past time that.a
woman was elected president, I
am not conﬁdent Senator Clin-
ton is the best choice. I believe
she has the capability to win
the Democratic primary, but I
fear her election will margin-

look at her credentials and

policies, her networks and
' campaign team and they see
someone who can win.

For a brief while, though,
a majority of Washington
and Lee students forgot to
play house. They forgot to
pretend to like Hillary.

A perfect example—Al-
ice Shih announcing that the
great state of Texas allots
delegates to Hillary Clinton
while the entire delegation
is on its feet waving Obama
signs.

Umm...well, see if you
can grab a Hillary sign, I
guess.

Texas wasn’t alone.

I’m sure W&L’s public
relations people breathed a
silent prayer of thanks when
they found out it was Bill
Clinton on the phone instead
of his wife.

I’m not sure it would have
been good press for the sena-
tor to overhear the Obama
chants after we supposedly
nominated her.

Bill we love, if for no
other reason than the man
would probably be the ﬁrst
on the Pole 3 dance ﬂoor (see
Zollman’s, 1992).

If you think about it, the
symbolism is dead on.

Why do you think the
youngest American voters
don’t vote?

I’m not a political sci-
entist. I don’t quote de
Touqueville. But if I had
to guess, I’d say that young
voters are tired of tired can-
didates.

av

alize disgruntled Republicans
and keep the White House in
Republican hands. Even if she
is successful in becoming the
ﬁrst female president, her last
name will result in partisanship
for the next four years.

This weekend W&L stu-
dents were privileged to have
the opportunity to listen to es-
teemed guest speakers who all
have made signiﬁcant contri-
butions to our political system.
Mock Convention has previ-
ously chosen speakers with
promising futures in politics.
This year we continued this
tradition by listening to Har-
old Ford Jr. and Patrick Rose. I
ﬁrmly believe we will see these

, two individuals become strong

leaders in the Democratic Party
in years to come.

I sincerely hope that Mock
Convention inspired students
to become more involved in
our political process. It ener-
gized my enthusiasm for poli-
tics. Personally, I feel honored
to have listened to the speeches
of these highly regarded politi-
cians.

I hope Mock Con’s Wrong

We can ’t stand Hillary, crowd shouted “O-bam-a ”

Hillary has been around
for a while. I still disagree
with Congresswoman Fer-
raro about her “experience,”
but that’s another matter.
Experienced or not, she’s an
old hand.

Obama is young. He ex-
cites people, and, more im-
portantly, he excites young
people.

But if every exciting can-
didate for our generation
loses their nomination bids,
do you really expect young
voters to show up in force?

Absolutely not.

Maybe Mock Con should
have thrown their aspirations
of accuracy out ohe window.

Will it be accurate as a
predictive exercise that we
nominated Hillary?

Probably, and for that I
applaud those among us who
worked so hard to that end.

But was nominating a
candidate I don’t think many
in the student body can stand
the best use of our school’s
bully pulpit?

With national media at-
tention focused on little old
Lexington, W&L’s students
ofﬁcially predicted Hillary
would win. Ofﬁcially.

But the Obama chants
showed who we wanted to
win. I hate to ruin Wes Lit-
tle’s day, but I hope we got

it wrong.
If the chants,‘posters and
deﬂated students showed

anything, it’s that a lot of
them are secretly hoping the
same thing.

Sorry, Wes.

 

_§ Abortion  

"'5
on

a crime

Most diverse
Americans oppose
legal abortions

Dear Editor, ,

This is a response to Prof.
Melina Bell’s letter to the edi-
tor in the Dec. 3 issue.

In the words of Mahatma
Gandhi, “It seems to me as
clear as daylight that abortion
would be a crime.”

I agree with Prof. Bell’s
premise that sectarian views
should not be enforced by the
state. Given that premise, her argu-
ment for keeping abortion legal rests
on the claim that the pro-life position
is a “sectarian” view; therefore, it does
not reﬂect the fundamental beliefs of
all people in our culture.

This claim fails for two reasons.
The pro-life position is not sectarian
because it is held by so many people
from so many different backgrounds.

A recent Time magazine poll
showed 55 percent of Americans op-
pose legal abortions, except possibly
in rare cases of danger to the mother’s
life or rape/incest.

And it’s not just Christian conserva-
tives who oppose abortion. Do a search
on the web for pro-life organizations,
and you can ﬁnd many Jews, Muslims,
atheists and agnostics, liberals, femi-
nists, gays and lesbians and others who
oppose abortion.

The second reason why the claim
fails—this also explains the ﬁrst—is
that the pro-life position is derived
from very basic scientiﬁc and moral
principles. Religious doctrines are not
necessary.

Take the fact that a fetus is a human
being with its very own identity-I
don’t see Prof. Bell seriously disputing
this. Then add the fact that the fetus has
done nothing wrong, certainly nothing
warranting death.

Given the basic moral principle
that all innocent human beings have
a basic, inalienable right to life, it fol-
lows that the state ought to uphold the
fetus’s right to live.

Is being anti-slavery sectarian?

Is being anti-segregation sectarian?

Once upon a time one might have
said yes. So I’m not surprised the pro-
life position is beirig called sectarian
today.

I ﬁnd it interesting that Prof. Bell
compares slavery with abortion because
slavery is a case in which a clearly im-
moral practice was kept alive because
of cultural problems too ingrained to
eliminate using pure logic.

The same is true with abortion to-

day.

We can talk about “offering each
other reasons from within our shared
value system” all day long, but the real
reason abortion continues is that our
society has many structural problems
that need to be addressed. The pro-life
movement has taken practical steps to
address these problems.

Pro—lifers run organizations that
provide free healthcare to pregnant
women, post—abortive counseling,
adoption assistance, and even sexual
education programs. All of these orga-
nizations rely on the support of people
who are willing to act on their pro-life
convictions, not merely attack abortion
with heated rhetoric.

Their services help to provide a
model for a society that is both com-
passionate and responsible.

This is the long and difficult solu-
tion to the problems our culture faces
with unwanted pregnancies. But it is
the only real solution.

Abortion is given as a much quick-
er and easier solution, but such shallow
virtues can never justify killing inno-
cent human beings.

Abortion continues to be part of our
culture not because we really feel it is
justiﬁed, but rather because we feel it
is impossible to lose abortion.

In this way, it really is no different
from slavery—completely wrong, yet
completely ingrained in our culture.

As a country we ought to be clam-
oring for a state that recognizes this
and is willing to effect a change.

  Mock Convention  
parties a highlight  
  of the weekend  

Social aspects of the weekends
demonstrate excitement of L  
the convention and bring the
student body closer together‘

Byceleste Cruz-carandang
STAFF wamza

Work hard, play hard~—the mantra of all W&L students.
From the most diligent state chairs to the mysteriously absent

A delegates, all have felt the stress of Mock Convention. Thus,
it goes without saying that the celebrations of this year‘s cau- _

cus were perhaps just as memorable as the eventitself.

In the past few‘ days, states have been throwing inter?del-
egation mixers. The entire Western Region hosted a party at
Pole One on the Monday before Mock Convention. Wednes-
day evening, several of the smaller delegations, including
Delaware, Ohio, West Virginia, Kansas, Indiana, /‘Utah and
Guam, put‘ aside their time differences and celebrated under
one flag at Old House. That same night, Pole Three was home
to delegations such as Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and
the Democrats Abroad. '

Interestingly enough, the settings of such mixers portend-_ I

ed the normal Washington and Lee revelry. Each locale was

familiar, as was the enjoyable pandenioniurn that ensued. Yet, O

those in attendance made each event different from the run-
of-the-mill gatherings. California State Chair, Kathryn Allen,

° commented, “The atmosphere was very similar to other W&L

parties--the setting was familiar, the drinks and games were

“The only.distz'nguishing factor was the
sort of atypical groups of students who -

were hanging out together... ”

familiar, the dancing was familiarly The oiilydistinguishing

factor was the sort of atypical groups of students who were
hanging out together, which made it a good opportunity to
meet some new people and step out of the social bubble in

which a lot of us get stuck...Mock Con. parties just allow us 7

to meet some new people, which is always fun.”
Despite the sense of community that the parties encour-
aged, the stress concerning the actual affair took its toll on the

students. For three weeks, those involved in Mock Conven- «

tion have lived and breathed research, contacts, predictions
and ﬂoat construction. It is no surprise, then, that a few hours
of carefree merriment should be awarded to them. “There
was a lot more heavy drinldng,” observed Valaree Tang, who
attended a few of Saturday night’s Mock Convention parties.
“I guess a bunch of people were just blowing off some steam.
They all worked so hard to pull together the parade and the

speakers and their predictions, that they justneeded some I

outlet when all their work was over.” _

D Unfortunately, some students crossed the line when it
came to alcohol and their own limits. Security guards report-
ed a student passed out in front of Grahan1~Lees,.who had to
go to the inﬁrmary. They warned students to considertheir.
decisions carefully and to take care of their friends. Anutnber

of students made visits to the health center, although the par- A

ties ended much earlier than most weekends.
Although there was bad news to report with the good,
Mocks Convention was an enormous success. Washington

and Lee did not only gain an enormous amount of prestige.

and notability, but was able to bring its students together: Al-
though ninety percent of the student body was under" more
than ﬁfty ﬂags, we were brought together under one cause,

’ under one event. So, whether we were right or wrong about

Hillary, I would say that we did Mock Convention right.

Cloverfield a good thrill

Monster ﬁlm a fan and exciting new twist on genre

By Grace Andrews
smrr WRITER

“What is that?” “Something
terrible.” “What is that?” “Some-
thing else, also terrible.” These
two quotes from the new J.J.

Abrams ﬁlm “Cloverﬁeld” semi—-

embody the reactions that this
ﬁlm elicits. The movie begins
with ofﬁcial government style
messages-that inform the viewer
that the tape is from what was
once Central Park. Soon after
that unfolds the story of Rob, his
brother Jason, Jason’s girlfriend
Lily, his best-friend Hud and
Hud’s mysterious crush Marlena.
Prior to the surprise party be-
ginning, Hud gets charged with
«manning the camera and captur-
ing “farewell” messages for Rob,
as he celebrates a job promotion
to Japan. During the party they
hear a thunderous noise from the
streets and run out to see what ap-
pears to be asteroids falling, as a
strange mist ﬁlls the city. What
ensues from there must be seen to
be believed, as a skyscraper-sized
creature destroys New York,
Manhattan in particular.
However, instead of escap-
ing when they have a chance, the
crew runs back into the city to
rescue a distressed Beth, who is
Rob’s best friend and love inter-
est. Our home-boy, Rob, gets hit
with a bout of knight-in-shining
armor syndrome and feels obliged
to save the lovely brunette, espe-
cially since his last words to Beth

. [were anything but well wishes.

Parade down Main Street a great success C

Marlena, the voice of reason,
expresses her reluctance to walk
into danger, especially since Beth
says something about being stuck
and bleeding, which means she
could be dead by the time they
get to her. Does anyone listen to
her? OF COURSE NOT, because
that would have actually made
sense! As this rag-tag gang make
their way into the heart of the city

that the movie unfolds from the
vantage point of the cameraman,
so think Blair Witch Project, but
better quality. This limits the au-
dience in the sense that we can’t
see everything, but the strong
sense of uncertainty adds to the
suspense and makes us feel like
we’re running through the streets
of New York, right along with the
crew.

Cloverﬁeld is as realistic as a mon-

ster movie can be.

The occurrences

within the ﬁlm are sudden, knee-jerk
and terrzfyingly confusing at times.

to rescue Beth, the U.S. military
works to evacuate the city, while
also attempting to annihilate the
monster.

Hud, the loveable idiot, seems
to be the movie’s comic relief,
mastering the art of ridiculous
lines at the most inopportune
time, while still maintaining his
job as cameraman. The audience
could not help but laugh during
the more intense scenes because
of Hud’s incredible talent for
saying the wrong thing. He was
deﬁnitely my favorite character.

What I liked most about the
ﬁlm is that you never really get a
clear view of the monster, further
adding to the terror of the ﬁlm.
It’s also important to remember

Now, if you are one of those
people who requires a plot that
tells the entire story from begin-
ning to end, then Cloverﬁeld is
not for you. I repeat, it’s not for
you. This ﬁlm starts suddenly in
the middle of a story, of which we
are never given the full details.
However, I argue that this “Insta-
movie,” add actors, monsters and
ﬁlm, has a little more meat than
some people give it credit for. For
instance, when Lily and Marlena
are running through the streets in
high heels and looking slightly
disheveled, but still beautiful,
I thought about how phony that
was, but my movie buddy, Aisha
Davis, explained to me the perks
of movie magic, a.k.a. make-up

and the impossibility of them
actually removing their shoes be-
cause of the debris. Nonetheless,
there is one scene where Lily
removes her three-inch stilettos
in order to properly climb stairs,
while huﬂing and pufﬁng like a
runaway train. Now, if that’s not
realistic, I don’t know what is.
Prior to writing this review, I
read some other reviews online,
and the biggest complaint seems
to be the abruptness of the end-
ing. However, I must contend
that Cloverﬁeld is as realistic as
a monster movie can be. The oc-
currences within the ﬁlm are sud-
den, knee-jerking and terrifying-
ly confusing at times, because if
a giant monster were to storm the

_streets today, almost everyone I

know would react as the charac-
ters in this movie did. Now, take
my statements for what they are
-opinion. If you wish to expe-
rience a ﬁlm like never before,
watch the movie. Is it worth
eight dollars? Maybe not, espe-
cially because of the abruptness
with which the movie ends. It
seemed to leave many in the the-
ater wanting more than what the
ﬁlm could give. So, if you don’t
like realism in ﬁlm, I recommend
you wait until it comes out on
DVD, pitch in with a bunch of
friends, and rent a night full of
fun! That way, you’ll only have
to pay about a dollar or so for the
latest twist on the monster genre.
So overall, I give this movie 7.75
out of 10 stars.

Mock Con is parade was a thrill for participants and spectators alike

By Klmber Wlggs
STAFF WRITER

The centennial Mock Con-
vention began Friday morning,
as men, women and children of
Lexington and beyond lined Main
Street to watch the long-awaited
Mock Con. parade. Though not
quite as long as I expected, the
parade was a once in a collegiate
lifetime experience, one that late-
risers were unfortunate to miss.

Wandering around Brewbaker
Field before the trailers began to
disembark, I saw the results of
all the hard work that went into
this parade. Some delegations
truly made their states proud with
sculptures, costuming and care-
fully applied coats of paint. Ha-
waii built a volcano; Washington,
the Space Needle; and Georgia,
a giant bottle of everyone’s fa-
vorite Classic soda. Other states
led me to wonder if they had as-
sembled their ﬂoats that very
morning. Even so, the mood was
upbeat,and it warmed my heart in

the freezing air.

In addition to the delegation
ﬂoats, three student bands played
on ﬂat beds during the parade.
Amid the roar of generators and
the fumes of gasoline, these mu-
sicians played their hearts out and

play an instrument.

I had the privilege of walking
beside West Virginia’s ﬂoat for
the event. Though not a native
West Virginian, I was neverthe-
less inspired by the outpouring
of WV pride from my fellow

I felt a surge of excitement every time some-

one recognized the New River Gorge Bridge

or the Mountaineer that were part of our
ﬂoat. I imagine other ﬂoat riders felt the

some pride when they, too, were ﬁnally recog-

nized for their hard work.

spilled their musical guts all over
Main Street. One band member
described his experience as “the
most dangerous gig I’ve ‘ever
played.” Not surprising, consid-
ering how easily one can fall off
a moving ﬂoat, even when he or
she is not also trying to sing and

delegates. Thanks to a CD with
the same track copied 22 times,
“Country Roads” was constantly
playing and I was faithfully sing-
ing along. To add to the joy of
the occasion, members of the del-
egation passed out candy to pa-
rade-goers. Shiny-eyed children

thanked them profusely as their
out-stretched hands received giﬁs
of chocolaty goodness.

Without a doubt, the best part
of the parade was watching the
on-lookers. Though shivering
in the 30—degree morning, the at-
tendees were happy to be present
and returned our greetings with
waves and smiles. I felt a surge

of excitement every time some-.

one recognized the New River
Gorge Bridge or the Mountain-
eer that were part of our ﬂoat. I
imagine other ﬂoat-riders felt the
same pride when they, too, were
ﬁnally recognized for their hard
work.

In the end, the big prize went
to the Texas delegation. The an-
nouncement was met with some
disappointment by states who
seemed to think they deserved the
win. But to Texas’ credit, that Al-
amo replica was pretty cool. And
even if only one ﬂoat could be the
best in the land, that doesn’t make
the process any less special or the
clowns any less creepy.

' Despite long sessions, students enjoy A-list speakers

Jesse Jackson and Charlie Wilson draw the biggest hype, but Cleland is surprising performance wins him some new fans

Henderson
smrr wrmsns

The long-awaited weekend
of Washington and Lee’s centen-
nial Mock Convention brought
diverse student responses to the
festivities and results.

A parade of ﬂoats built

by the delegations kicked off the

convention on Friday morning.
The parade participants as well as
the onlookers enjoyed themselves
as the ﬂoats rolled down Main
Street, though many complained
about the cold weather.

“Being on the ﬂoat was a lot
of fun,” said freshman Victoria
Taylor, delegate for the territory
of Guam. “There were only ﬁve
people on our delegation, and
three of us got to ride on the ﬂoat.
We were in between Florida and

Hawaii so we blended in because
we all had a tropical theme.”

“It’s a tie between Mississippi
and Maine,” freshman and New
York delegate Anne Parlato said,
speaking of her favorite ﬂoats.
“Maine had sword-ﬁghting lob-
sters, but I liked Mississippi with
the camo and guns.”

Delaware Attorney General
Joseph R. “Beau” Biden com-
manded the room with a direct,
clear delivery, giving the session’s
second address. “He certainly had
a presence,” said sophomore Nev-
ille Foggarty.

Geraldine A. Ferraro, Former
New York U.S. Representative
and Vice Presidential candidate,
spoke later that afternoon, to the
joy of many New York residents
and delegates.

“I love her. She’s fabulous,”
sophomore Jessie Wang of New

York said. “I’ve worked with a lot
of politicians in New York, and
she’s someone I’ve always ad-
mired. She’s a role model.”

Senior Katelyn Finley of the
Puerto Rico delegation, however,
felt there was a “generational dis-
connect” between Ferraro, who
spoke of equality for women, and
the audience of college students.
“Her generation has had to ﬁght
for their equality while my gen-
eration doesn’t have to ﬁght so
much,” Finley said.

Arguably, the two most an-
ticipated speakers were Rever-
end Jesse L. Jackson and for-
mer U.S. Texas Representative
Charles Wilson. As the subject
of the recent movie “Charlie Wil-
son’s War” starring Tom Hanks,
Wilson’s celebrity status clearly
made him a popular speaker. But
Hanks himself could not do jus-

tice to the ready humor, reassur-
ing demeanor; and sheer charm
that won audience members over
on Friday afternoon.

Wilson delivered the last ad-
dress of the ﬁrst session, sharing
stories of his call to politics and
experience in the Cold War. “I
thought it was really interesting,”
said junior Tara Hildenbrand,
native and delegate of Texas, in
response. “I never knew who he
was before. It was an inspiring
story.” I

Other students were disap-
pointed that Wilson did not “com-
ment on our convention and the
youth involvement,” as freshman
Hannah Muther, delegate of Illi-
nois, said.

Former US. Senator Max Cle-
land, who lost both legs and one
arm in the Vietnam War, gave a
stirring speech during the sec-

ond session on Saturday punctu-
ated with Methodist jokes. The
audience found this segment of
the convention highly entertain-
ing. “Best speech ever! That was
brilliant!” said junior Michael
Gretchen, chair of the Louisiana
delegation.

Reverend Jesse L. Jackson’s
speech on Saturday night met
with applause but also with mixed
reactions from the student del-
egates. “I might think he’s crazy,
but I found it entertaining,” said
freshman Greg Franke, delegate
and native of Maryland.

With a sense of raw power,
Jackson invoked audience mem-
bers to take action against inequal-
ity. As senior Nicole Morello put
it, “he was really able to move the
emotions of the crowd.”

Senior Dan Harris said of
Jackson’s speech, “it was really

the highlight of the convention.”
The convention served as a
learning opportunity for many.
Freshman Nay Lin, an intema-
tional student from Burma, at-
tendedrthe Mock Convention to
learn more about the American
political system. He said it is
much more difﬁcult to be politi-

I cally active in Burma where de-

mocracy is limited. In America,
Lin said, “you can do anything if
you put effort into it.”

Midwest regional chair Shane
Wilson spoke of the purpose of
Mock Convention and its suc-
cess in involving youth. “If noth-
ing else, this is going to spark an
interest, spark a passion,” Wilson
said. “This brings the most impor-
tant issues of our time to the stu-
dents to combat the widespread
apathy in our generation.”

Giants not second best

The Neil(l)s break down the Super Bowl between the Patriots and Giants

By Nelll Thuparl and Nell
Sheaffer «
coLu M msrs

First oﬂ are these the two
best teams in the NFL?

NS: Nope. The Patriots are
by far the best team in the NFL.
and probably the best team ever,
so they are a no-brainer at the
number one spot. Do I even need
to try and provide an explanation

for that? I hope not. Are the Gi-V

ants the second best team in the
NFL? No, I don’tthin.k so. Now,
I think that most people are going
to throw everything I’m about to
write out the window because the
Giants really have been playing
well recently, but I’ve got to stick
to my opinions and the season
as a whole. I think the Chargers
are the second best team«'in the
league. The Chargers gave the
Patriots a legitimate run for their
money, and I really believe that
a healthy LT would have gotten
them touchdowns in the red zone.
I could also make an argument
for the Colts as the best team
other than the Patriots, but a very
beat-up Chargers team took out
a reasonably beat-up Colts team
in Indianapolis, so I have to give
the edge to the Chargers. So ba-
sically it comes down to this: The
AFC is the best conference, and is
home to the top three teams in the
league, the Patriots, Chargers and
Colts. As far as the NFC goes,
I still think that the Packers and
Cowboys are the better teams.

NT: It’s tough for me to say
this because the Giants have been
playing so spectacularly in these
past few weeks, but I don’t think

there’s any  that these aren’t:
tlib two best teams in the NFL. ‘'

First, there are the New England
Patriots. A record breaking 18-
0 during the regular season and
playoffs so far while shattering
numerous records, both individ-
ual and team, along the way. No
one can argue with their being the
absolute best team in the league,
and if you’re Chris Collinsworth,
they’re the best team ever to
grace a football ﬁeld. However,
looking at the overall body of
work, strength of schedule and,
more importantly, strength of
conference, I think that both
the San Diego Chargers and In-
dianapolis Colts are better teams
than this year’s Giants. Don’t
get me wrong; I am not taking

anything away from New York’s
great victories over Dallas and
Green Bay, two teams that beat
them handily earlier this season,
but if you examine the overall
body of work of the Giants juxta-
posed to that of the Chargers and

l Colts, it’s hard for me to say they

are better. One could even argue,
as Neil has done, that even the
Cowboys and Packers are better
than the Giants, and I wouldn’t
be totally opposed to that idea ei-
ther, but I’m going to give them
the beneﬁt of the doubt because
of their playoff wins. Nonethe-
«less, they are the hottest team in

_jthe NFL, and momentum is ab-
solutely vital to winning in this

league, so you can’t count them
out just yet.

and I realized that there are an
innumerable amount of veter-
ans, any of whom are capable of
providing a game-changing per-
formance for this New England
squad. So, the fact of the matter
is, there are literally dozens upon
dozens of reasons that the Patriots

will win the Super Bowl. In fact, '

you could have an entire column
dedicated to completely viable
reasons the Patriots will win the
Superbowl and it may be three or
four times longer than this piece
Neil and I are writing. With that
being said, I’m going to say that
because of New England’s third
ranked rushing defense being
able to stop the Giants running
back combination of Ahmad
Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs,
thereby putting the entire weight

Tell us why the Patriots will

I could start with their incred-
ible perfect record or their NFL

Tom Brady or the fact that they
have already beaten the New

§York Giant§ barely a month be-
"fore thag Siiperlibwl. fcould even

talk about their NFL Coach of the
Year, Bill Belichick, the domi-

'nance of their unheralded offen-

sive line, and the inability for any
team in the league to cover and
stop each and every single one of
their weapons on offense, from
Wes Welker to Randy Moss to
Laurence “Lo’Mo” Maroney to
Mike Vrabel and the list goes on.
Combine each of the aforemen-
tioned things with the fact that
New England’s defense is led by
a number of seasoned veterans
such as Junior Seau, Tedy Brus-
chi, Richard Seymour, Adalius
Thomas, Asante Samuel and, oh
my goodness, while looking up
names to list in this section Neil

of the game on Quarterback Eli
Manning’s shoulders and having
him self—destruct with a few care-
less interceptions, the New Eng-
land Patriots will win Superbowl
XLII.

NS: The Patriots are the best
team and won’t lose. Instead I’ll
write about Tom Brady. THE

‘._B_.OOT:— Igoeswnobody in the
whole media world realize that’

Tom Brady is not hurt at all? The
Patriots are toying with the me-
dia and everyone else that fell for
it. He doesn’t show up during the
first ﬁfteen minutes of practice,
and they say that he’s not prac-
ticing? Reporters can only watch
the ﬁrst ﬁfteen minutes. Antonio
Pierce says that he’s not hurt, so
they aren’t fooling the Giants.
Why is such a big deal made out
of this? I’m tired of it.

NT: Real great analysislthere,
Neil. Ground-breaking stuff.

this Sunday in Glendale, AZ...

NS: Not happening. Didn’t
they already lose to the Patriots‘?

NT: Okay, unlike my com-
patriot here, I’m actually going

to have a stab at this one. Since.

losing on opening weekend in
Dallas, the New York Giants
have won 10 consecutive games
on the road, including at Dallas
and at Lambeau Field in subzero
temperatures. This makes them
the hands-down most dangerous
team to play anywhere at any-
time. Fourth year Quarterback
Eli Manning is blossoming into
a big-garne superstar, much like
he was at Ole Miss. In the play-
offs he has shown a maturity
reminiscent of his older brother
Peyton, and he has demonstrated
an uncanny ability to manage the
game properly when the ball is
in his hands. Behind the rush-
ing tandem of Ahmad Bradshaw,
who did not play in their week 17
matchup, and Brandon Jacobs,

Manning has been able to ﬁnd

his comfort zone in the offense
and continue to play at a higher
level that Giants fans have been
praying for. However, New York
is most certainly not‘ a one—di-
mensional team. Their defense
is anchored by arguably the best
defensive line in the league led
by DE’s Michael Strahan and Osi
Umenyiora. This terrorizing two-
some will be putting pressure on
Brady all game, forcing him to
step outside of the box and make
tight passes to beat them. Along
those same lines, gritty Defen-
sive backs Aaron Ross and Sam
Madison have, as of late, been
styrnieing opposing wide receiv-

ll

ers to no end. As long as they.

continue their physical, fearless
coverage on the Patriots’ Moss,
Welker, Gaffney, and whoever
else New England may throw out
there, the Giants have a very real
chance at forcing turnovers, and
leaving Glendale, AZ with the
Lombardi Trophy.
i

We hope that this sheds some
light on this year’s Super Bowl
for you, and as always special
thanks to Neil Sheaffer for help-
ing us out. Don’t forget to join us
again next week as we wrap up
the NFL Season and take a look
back at the moments that made
this year such a memorable one
in NFL history.

“But mom, why does Peyton
get to go? I never get to do any-
thing!”

“Now son, he’s a lot older
than you. More mature. You’re
simply not ready.”

“But. . .but. . .I am ready!
Look! I’m dressed in blue too,
with plenty of padding! Plus,
I’m almost as tall as Peyton. I
promise I’ll keep up.

“A ‘no’ is a ‘no,’ end of dis-
cussion.”

“But, .but. . .”

“But nothing. You’ll have
your chance to go soon enough.”

And just like that, young Pey-
ton Manning went off to his ﬁrst
amusement park, leaving little
brother Eli behind. And while Eli
slumped away in jealousy and re-
sentment towards his older broth-
er, he knew deep down that one
day, he too would get a chance to
go to the theme park. He just had
to wait until he was ready.

Fifteen or so years later, noth-
ing changed. At this time last
year, Olivia Manning still had to
remind her youngest son that he
was “simply not ready.” Peyton
was an older, more mature and
more complete quarterback. He
was ready to ride to the top of
football’s largest roller coaster——
the Super Bowl.

Now, one year after Peyton’s
remarkable ride, it’s Eli’s turn.
No one can say he’s not good
enough. No one can say he’s not

experienced enough. No one can
say he’s not ready. ‘

Having faced arguably the
most scrutiny in the last ﬁve
years of any New York athlete
not named Alex Rodriguez, Eli
Manning has made his way from
Peyton’s under-achieving young-
er brother to the quarterback
leading the NFC Champions into
Super Bowl XLII. And though
he may look as old as he is in the
above conversation, he sure as
hell isn’t playing like it.

First, he marched through
Tampa Bay and Jeff Garcia, who

of Manning’s mistake—free foot-
ball, a strong running game and a
solid defense led the Giants past
Brett Favre and the Packers. And,
despite the below-zero weather,
Manning looked even more com-
fortable than F avre. Who knows,
maybe he was wearing Favre’s
Wrangler jeans.

I know what you’re think-
ing. Eli is the Trent Dilfer of this
year’s playoffs—sneaking into
the roller coaster that is the Su-
per Bowl by merely limiting his
mistakes and praying for dear life
that he doesn’t slip through his

had beaten the Giants twice be-
fore in the playoffs.

Next, he went into Dallas
to take on Tony Romo, Jessica
Simpson and the highly favored
Cowboys. And with a 132.4
passer rating, Manning powered
the Giants to victory, while si-
multaneously preparing some
popcorn for T.O.

Then, on the frozen tundra of
Lambeau Field, the combination

~ seat belt and fall off because he

was never ready in the ﬁrst place.
Well, the answer is no, and here’s
why.

Eli is one of four quarterbacks
to lead his team to the playoffs
in each of the past three seasons.
His company? Peyton Manning,
Tom Brady, and Matt Hassel-
beck. I hear those guys are pretty
good. Not convinced?

Okay, Eli is one of ﬁve quar-

touchdowns in each of the past
three years. His company? Car-
son Palmer, Peyton Manning,
Tom Brady, and Drew Brees.
Not too shabby, huh?

I could continue, but if you’re
not on the Eli bandwagon yet,
then no statistic will serve to cor-
rect the very little sports knowl-
edge that you have. Plus, let’s
face it, actions speak louder than
words, and the action of getting
to the Super Bowl says enough.

Speaking of words versus ac-
tions, let’s reexamine the com-
ments of former teammate turned
journalistic traitor Tiki Barber
back in August. Tiki bashed Eli
for his on- and off—ﬁeld leader-
ship, stating, “Sometimes it was
almost comical the way he would
say things.” To me, the only
thing that is comical about Eli’s
most recent on-ﬁeld actions is the
fact that he did them without Tiki
(and Jeremy Shockey, for that
matter).

As the Super Bowl approach-
es, it is only a matter of time be-
fore we see how ready Eli Man-
ning actually is. And while some
may say that a poor performance
on the part of Eli would halt the
roller coaster mid-track, I say
that Eli can put his hands in the
air and wave jokingly to Peyton
as he experiences the rush of
football’s greatest ride, because
win or lose, Eli is most deﬁnitely
ready.

Generals on second four game streak, win eight of nine

By Hank Nathan
smrr warran-

The Washington & Lee
Men’s Basketball team won all
three of its games this past week

' en route to the second four-game .

winning streak of the season. 1

The Generals traveled to
Emory & Henry College on
Wednesday, a place where the
team had not won a game in
10 years. However, this year’s
team is different and seems to
have the propensity to pull out
the close games.

Coach Adam Hutchinson
attributed the ability to win
the close ones to growing as a
team. _ ‘ ‘

“The maturity of our se-
niors and juniors is the foremost
thing in my mind [that enables
the team to come through in
the close games],” said Coach
Hutchinson. “Those guys have
played a lot ofclose games over
the course of their careers, so
pretty much any situation that
arises, we have been in before.”

The game against Emory &
Hemy mirrored the progression
of the team ‘over the past few
years“.

In the ﬁrst half, the two teams
played even at the Wasps’ fast
paced run-and-shoot style with
ﬁve ties and four lead changes.
The score was 52-54 at half, fa-

Women drop ODAC

By Russweems
STAFF WRITER I

' ~ The women’s basketball team
continued their ODAC schedule
this week with games against
Randolph-Macon and Bridge-
water. They came into the week
3-6 in the conference.

W&L started the week
Tuesday against 20th ranked
Randolph Macon. The Yellow
Jackets came into the game one
of the top teams in the ODAC
with only one loss. The Gener-
als kept it close in the ﬁrst half,’
which featured 8 lead changes
and 3 ties. Near the end of the

voting E&H.

The Generals, right on cue,
opened up the second half on an
8-0 run and never looked back.
The team was only up by six
points withslightly less than 19
minutes to play, but that didn’t
matter. W&L controlled the
game the rest of the way, con-
tent to beat the Wasps at their
own rapid up-and-down game.

W&L broke Emory & Hen-

,ry’s press with ‘ease, resulting

in layup aﬂer layup. The ﬁnal
score was 116-105. Sophomore
Zac White had three dunks in
the effort, a rarity in Division

-Illibasketball, as he compiled a

career-high 26 points.

Senior captain Greg Bi-
enneman also notched his ca-
reer-high with 36 points. Fellow
captain Femi Kusimo added in
22 of his own.

Junior captain Isaiah Good-
man reiterated Coach Hutchin-
son’s sentiments about how far
the team has come.

“We played much more con-
ﬁdent and relaxed this year than
we have in years past,” said
Goodman. “We have learned
a lot from those close games,
and we are ﬁnally putting it all
together. When we get in those
tough situations, we realize that
we have all been through it to-
gether.” ,. '

The Generals then traveled

ﬁrst half, the Yellow Jackets
went on a run and closed with
a seven point advantage, 30-23.
After the half, W&L came out
energized and went on a 9-4 run
led by the play of Amanda Kane.
Thisjeut the lead to a mere two
points (34-32). However this
was a back a forth game. Ran-
dolph Macon outscored the Gen-
erals 12-3 in the next 7 minutes
and led by a score of 46-35 with
6:46 remaining. W&L_got as
close a seven on two occasions,
but could not get any closer.
Randolph Macon went 8-9 from

. the line in the ﬁnal 1:30 to seal

the deal, leaving the ﬁnal score

to Lynchburg College. W&L
continued its strong shooting
performance from the previous
game, hitting 60 percent of its
shots in the ﬁrst half. The team
went into the locker room with a
15 point advantage, 37-22.

The Hofnets came out ﬁr-
ing from behind the~arc in the
second half, hitting ﬁve three-
pointers in the ﬁrst six minutes
of the half. I

A relentless Lynchburg team
went on a 23-9 run to cut the
score to three with less than 11
minutes to play, but that was as
close as they would get.

Bienneman, as he has“done,i V

all year long, put out the ﬁre
with a 17-foot jump shot as the
shot clock expired. On the next
possession, Bienneman knocked
down a layup oﬁ‘ of a pass from

junior Chris McHugh while be-.

ing fouled.

Bienneman did the exact
same thing moments later, this
time the pass came from Kusi-
mo. -The two and-one’s ignited
the Generals the rest of the way.
The conversion on the free throw
put the team back up by more
than 10. In fact, W&L hit all 13
of their foul‘ shots in the game in
uncharacteristic fashion.

The Generals continued to
increase their lead from then on

and ﬁnished the game with the‘

same 15 point margin that they

On Sunday, the Generals
downed the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers 66-51. The Generals
jumped out to an early lead in a
low scoring contest.

They held a 32-17 advantage
at. halftime and maintained a
double-digit advantage through-
out most of the second half. A
late charge allowed the Tigers to
close to within ﬁve points with
ﬁve minutes remaining. but two

quick baskets for the Generals
put the game out of reach.

A three point play by Bi-
enneman pushed the lead into
double digits and the Generals
were able to run out the clock
for their fourth win in a row.

Washington & Lee is now 10-
5 overall and 6-2 in conference.
The Generals had an identical

10-5 record last year before los-

ing nine of their last 10 games
down the stretch. Goodman says
the team will have to stay sharp

in order to reverse the bad for-
tune of last year. i
“The team is doing well [this
year]; we started the year 10-5
last year, but did not ﬁnish well,”
said Goodman. “We have to stay
more disciplined and focused
than ever before to accomplis
what we want to do.” '

games against R-M and Bridgewater

Women rally late against Bridgewater but come up short as Timberlake s free throw wins the game for the Eagles

68-57. W&L played good de-
fense, holding the Yellow Jack-
ets to a mere 38.1 percent, but

. they were killed by 24 turnovers.

W&L had some players step
up with strong games. Senior
forward Kristen Krouchick led
W&L with a» big performance,
providing 18 points and seven
rebounds. Amanda _Kane had
13 of her 14 points in the sec-
ond half. Junior guard Bethany
Ridenhour also was in double
ﬁgures with 10 points.

The Generals returned to ac-

Bridgewater. The beginning of
the game was closely contested‘

with nine lead changes and two
ties. Bridgewater started to pull
away near the end of the ﬁrst
half. The Eagles built a 7 point
lead with 3:20 to play in the first
half. W&L battled back to close
the half, scoring the ﬁnal ﬁve
points of the half in the last 7
seconds. Bridgewater came out
strong after the half and jumped
out to an eight point lead. The
Hornets maintained this advan-
tage for much of the half and
led by nine twice within the ﬁ-

_ nal six minutes of the contest.

The Generals were not going

stopped the bleeding with a

extend the lead to ﬁve. W&L
countered with threes on back-
to-back possessions to tie the,
game up. However, on the last
possession Bridgewater’s Jes-
sica Timberlake was fouled with
2.7 seconds left. The pressure
may have gotten to her as she
missed the ﬁrst, but she coolly

Love Your
Body Week to
kick off today

Organizations address women is
health and body image issues

By Grace Wang
ASSISTANT. NEWS EDITOR

It will not be long before eerie mannequins appear around cam-
pus holding large signs with statistics and bold statements. Maga-
zine cut-outs of supennodels will adorn mirrors in the Commons,
and normally put—together female students will forgo make-up,
traveling to class in their pajamas.

Surprisingly, these odd occurrences share a common theme,
serving as in-your-face reminders to W&L women to respect and
cherish their God-given bodies. They are merely a sample of
events to educate and shock W&L students during the ﬁrst-ever
celebration of Love Your Body Week.

Love Your Body Day is a campaign started by the National
Organization for Women (NOW), which aims to shed light on cru-
cial issues plaguing young women such as eating disorders, body
loathing, sexual health, and addiction to drugs and alcohol. By us-
ing real statistics, images, and videos, Love Your Body Day hopes
to educate women and men and convey that self-esteem is critical
to those living in a society of unrealistic expectations fueled by
Hollywood and the fashion, cosmetics and diet industries. W&L
chose to expand Love Your Body Day into a week-long event.

As a high school student, Jackie Burns, current treasurer of
Knowledge Empowering Women Leaders (KEWL), experienced
an event broadcasting similar themes of female empowerment.
She was moved and inspired. Upon learning that body image
problems affect a greater percentage of women on the W&L cam-
pus than on other college campuses in the nation, Burns suggested
that W&L start acknowledging this sobering statistic.

She said, “It doesn’t take long for a new student on campus
to realize W&L has a culture all its own — dressing up for classes
and football games, etc. Not that tradition or presentation is a bad
thing, but when W&L has signiﬁcantly higher rates of eating dis-
orders than the average college campus, then I believe the issue
deserves closer attention.”

She broached the idea during a KEWL meeting, suggesting
that W&L celebrate natural femininity in an entire week of events
and activities.

In December 2007, initial planning for Love Your Body Week
event began. Enthusiasm was abundant among KEWL members,
leading to numerous ideas about how best to spread the message
at W&L. '

Prepared to address issues ranging from reproductive health to
eating disorders, KEWL enlisted additional help from Lifestyle
Information for Everyone (LIFE), and W&L Students for Choice.
Love Your Body Week is now a collaborative effort among the
three organizations.

Love Your Body Week will kick off today with a fundraising
drive of cosmetic and personal hygiene items to beneﬁt women re-
ceiving aid and shelter from Project Horizon, a local organization
for victims of domestic, dating, and sexual violence. Organized
by sophomore Brooke Reidy, the drive will take place all week
in the Commons. In addition, a table with information regarding
NOW, the Love Your Body campaign, and other related topics

ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR

Saturday’s “Day of Dialogue,”
presented by the Panhellenic
Council and the Interfratemity
Council, gave students a chance
to voice their opinions and create
steps of action to improve an is-
sue pertinent to the student body:
gender relations.

New sorority and fraternity
members were present at the
event, as were several upperclass-
men. Incoming Panhellenic pres-
ident Jackie DiBiasie opened the
day with a speech in Lee Chapel.
She said that the topic was chosen
based on surveys from last year’s
Day of Dialogue. “It’s easy to see
that gender relations, at least on
our campus, is a problem,” DiBi-
asie informed students gathered
in Lee Chapel.

Dr. Jennifer Sayre of Univer-
sity Counseling also addressed
the students, initiating a open dis-
cussion on the subject of “hook-
ing up.” While some students

did not take the discussion seri-
ously.

“I think Dr. Sayre was really
brave to put up with the people
yelling out comments,” said
Yinghao Long, a senior member
of Pi Beta Phi. “Some of the stu-
dents were less respectful than
they should have been.”

Senior Nelson Bunn also ad-
dressed the crowd. He believes
that gender relations constitute
the day-to—day life of every col-
lege student across the nation.
Thus, more attention should be
dedicated to forming healthy rela-
tions. “We have come a long way,
but we have a very long way to
go,” Bunn said.

“I thought he was direct,” said
senior Bryant Fulk, a member
of Pi Kappa Phi, in response to
Bunn’s speech. “[What he said]
is something both genders should
be concerned about.”

The speeches were followed
by small group discussions, in
which students discussed various

dents also brainstormed to create
potential action plans to improve
the status of gender relations at
W&L in the future.

“I thought the dialogue in the
discussions was very good. A lot
of good ideas came from it,” said

with each other, such as Friday

Others, however, disagreed
and feel that further changes will
need to be made. “It doesn’t have
to do with where people eat and

Robert Wason, a freshman and
new member of Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon.

Still, other students believe the
problem lies even deeper. Some
believe that the problem rests in
the structure of the Greek system
and the social pressures it entails.

“The fraternities are more in
control of the social scene than I
realized,” said freshman Michele
Farquharson, a new member of
Kappa Alpha Theta. “I didn’t
even think about the fact that we
only go to parties hosted by guys.
The guys don’t want to leave their
comfort zone, but they ask the
girls to do that every weekend.”

The issues caused by alcohol
only seem to exacerbate the prob-
lem. “Real relationships can’t be
based on people you only talk to
when you’re drunk,” said fresh-
man Katie Blackburn, a new
member of Chi Omega.

Unfortunately, although some
students believe the Day of Dia-
logue carried a noble message,

will be motivated enough to
make changes. “People are get-
ting worked up and passionate
about this cause, but tonight they
will go out and perpetuate the
cycle by refusing to interact [with
the opposite sex] unless they’re
drunk,” said Wason.

Olszewski pointed out that the
issue rests on the shoulders of
both genders. “I hear girls saying
they want to go out and hook up
with someone as much as I hear
guys say it,” he said.

Another male student said,
“All white males are accused of
being predators, and that’s unfair
to guys.”

Most students seem to recog-
nize that the students themselves
are at the heart of this issue.

“I don’t think it’s just the re-
sponsibility of the Greek commu-
nity,” said sophomore Chi Omega
Clara McClenon. “It is up to indi-
viduals to create more respectful
friendships.”

The future look of the University is beginning to take hold at Wilson Field. As students are
well aware, over the last few months Wilson Field, the University’s cherished football stadium,
has started to receive a major faceliﬁ. Beginning at the end of the 2007 football season, Wilson
Field is undergoing a three phase redevelopment.

Phase I of the project includes new horne stands for roughly 3,000 spectators and a new
press box. Phase 11 includes the installation of ﬁeld turf, lights and a new track. Phase III will
include landscaping and visitor seating for 500 spectators.

The ﬁeld is expected to reopen by the 2008 football season.

Initially consisting of a main athletic ﬁeld and a small set of bleachers, Wilson Field was
later renovated in 1924 to include a 3,000 seat stadium. Expanded in 1929, Wilson Field is one

of the largest stadiums in Division III football.

The renovations are just the ﬁrst part of the University’s Strategic Plan. Unveiled last year,
the Strategic Plan’s goal is to prepare Washington and Lee University for the 21st century by
improving academics,‘ student life, and the buildings on campus. The work on Wilson Field is
the ﬁrst among many renovations planned for the physical plan of the university. Other im-
provements and refurbishments planned include:

- Renovation of the Colonnade, including DuPont Hall

- Reconﬁguration of Lewis Hall (law school)

- Transformation of Leyburn Library

- . Expansion and rebuilding of underclassmen housing

- Building of a center for Jewish Life
- Renovation of Doremus Gym

Students have had to cope with the closing of the Cadaver Bridge, but with construction oc-
curring around the frequently walked pathway to the sorority houses, safety was an issue. With
the planned construction, this will likely be the ﬁrst of many adjustments made to students’

daily lives.

ed around campus. Phrases such as “super
skinny” used merely to advertise a bottle of
shampoo will be emphasized in order to il-
lustrate our society’s obsession with weight
and the “ideal body.” Magazine cut-outs of
the “ideal woman” will cover mirrors around
the Commons to receive maximum viewer-
ship. Lastly, a screen in the Commons will
play videos such as the Dove commercial,
“Transformation,” which shows the alarming
degree to which Photoshop is used to reduce
women to their body parts and ﬂaws. The

commercial offers food for thought, saying,.
“No wonder our perception of beauty is dis-
torted.”

“Hump” Day, scheduled for Wednesday,
will focus on sexual health and well-being.

W&L Students for Choice, Hump Day will

taking care of your reproductive health. With
that in mind Students for Choice will be cc-
hosting Wednesday of Love Your Body Week
and focusing on safe sex — including contra-
ceptive access, sexual assault prevention and
more.” .

The other days of Love Your Body Week
include “Indulgence Day,” chaired by senior
Georgia Gilroy, during which female students
are encouraged to enjoy ice cream sundaes
in the Commons without counting calories
or worrying about dieting. In addition, fe-
male students can help to make a statement
by going to class without.their usual layers
of make-up.

Overall, Regina Mills, President of
KEWL, believes Love Your Body Week will
be a great success. She is particularly proud
of the enthusiastic and generous involvement
of KEWL, LIFE, and W&L Students for
Choice.

She said, “I think Love Your Body Week
could be an annual event that can focus on
more than just the topics that we have chosen
for this year. At the very least, it will open‘
peoples’ eyes to the pressure that women are
under [at W&L] and around the country.”

Burns agrees. “Bottom line, enjoy your-
self and treat your body well. Size, aﬁer
all, is trivial in the grand scheme of things.
There are much more important and fulﬁlling
things to occupy yourself with -- your waist
is a terrible thing to mind.”

Blame the Y chromosome

Girls, don ’t get your hopes too high for Valentine s Day, we ’re not Noah Calhoun

By Crlghton Allen
s TA F r w R IT E R

. Ladies, as you are all doubtlessly aware,
we are less than a week from the BIG DAY,
yes, Valentine’s Day.

If you have a signiﬁcant other and are anx-
iously waiting for that special something from
the special someone, I’ll get back to you in a
minute.

For those of you who have no one special
to take you out that night, give me a call. Seri-
ously.

For the last two months, I have been on
the phone every day with my life coach, the
world’s foremost love and relationship expert,
the lovely Tila Tequila. Tila and I have made

ig plans for the 14th, and the lucky one who
calls me ﬁrst will be treated to una belle nota.

That’s right, girls, I do speak Italian.

And in case you were wondering, Tila told
me that if she could do it all over again, she
would have picked Dani.

But for you ladies who do have a boyfriend,
I have a quick history lesson for you.

The guy who got the whole Valentine’s
Day ball rolling was a Roman Bishop during
the later part of the third century who was sav-
agely beaten and beheaded in 269 for giving
aid and comfort to early Christians during per-
secutions of the Emperor Claudius II.

 

editorial

Take that into consideration before you
default to the patented “nothing’s the matter”
pout when your boyfriend drops the ball and
shatters the dreamy fantasies you concoct in
your Notebook-polluted minds.

Let’s face it: most guys aren’t Noah Cal-
houn.

We aren’t going to restore an old house and

For those of you who
have no one special to
take you out that night,
give me a call. Seriously.

paint it white with blue shutters and set aside a
special room with a view for your painting.

Heck, we are lucky if on Feb. 13, we man-
age to ﬁnd something, anything that can score
us enough brownie points to make up for our
“totally ruining your night” with our refusal to
dress up like Barney the Dinosaur for Famous
Lovers.

Since you took the history lesson so pa-
tiently, I’ll let you in on a secret: If we kill

your Valentine’s Day buzz, it’s not our fault.
No, really.

It’s our darn Y chromosome; just when we
have mustered enough effort to care and put
forth a real effort for you, our genes kick in
and make us revert to a store-bought card and
a pack of chocolates.

So please, show a little sympathy; very few
guys can win the ﬁght against biology.

Fellas, the key to a successful Valentine’s
Day is not making your lady happy; oh no, it’s
preserving your dignity. ,

I’ve had buddies pull out ideas for Valen-
tine’s Day that would make Allie Hamilton
gag (yes, I know, another Notebook refer-
ence.) Things like a teddy bear sprayed in their
cologne or rose petals scattered on her bed.

My advice, boys, don’t be those guys.

I’d rather endure a lifetime of Playfair (re-
member that nugget of joy from freshman 0-
Week?) than pull out something like the teddy
bear. But after all, I did hire Tila Tequila to
help me get the girl I’m after, so what do I
know?

Guys, just make sure you at least buy the
girl dinner when you take her to the Bistro, and
ladies, even if the guy buys you milk chocolate
when he knows well and good you’re lactose
intolerant, at least try to smile, please.

Remember, it’s not his fault.

  Dialogue on bizarre relations

Get serious about date rape and sexual assualt to keep the Greek system alive

. Members of Washington and Lee’s Greek
community got together Saturdayfor Day of

Dialogue, and talked , about gender. Jielations. *

Panhellenic and the Interfratemity Council
picked a timely topic, but are most W&L stu-
dents even listening? We’re going to step out
on a limb and assume that the student who
showed up drunk missed most of the mes-
sage.

During the past year, the increasing gap be-
tween Greek leadership and normal members
has been growing, especially in fraternity life.

.:s Panhel and the IFC begin designing an am-
itious Greek vision plan, that gap may grow
into a complete rupture.

The Greek vision plan lays out a host of
problems that student leaders — and admin-
istrators — think are holding back the Greek
system. It’s no secret that W&L continues to
struggle with high levels of dangerous drink-
ing and sexual assault rates that are in some
cases nearly double the national average.

So gender relations were an appropriate
topic this week. But are most students inter-
ested in change?

The apathy in W&L’s Greek system is
downright alarming. Most students are con-

Qent to complain about the student leaders and
the administration without ever attempting to

get involved.
There is also a nagging suspicion in the
minds of many members that student leaders

. still take most of their marching orders from

the administration. That’s not the case, but
many students still seem to have little faith in
the administration.

Its time that the average
student got oﬁ’ his (or her)
lazy butt and stopped let-
ting IF C and Panhel do all

the heavy lifting.

The sad thing is that these unwarranted sus-
picions hinder the real conversations that need
to be taking place on this campus. Anyone can
see how bizarre our gender relations — or lack
thereof — really are.

After freshman year, few students hang out
with people of the opposite sex outside of class
and frat dance ﬂoors. If a guy and girl try to
go have lunch, people immediately assume

they’re on a date. -

This campus’s odd relations come from a
combination of factors. Until 23 years ago,
this was an all male institution where the so-
cial scene revolved around fraternities. In
many ways, that hasn’t changed.

The university didn’t make things any bet-
ter when they decided to build the ﬁve sorori-
ties on a back corner of campus while turning
Davidson Park into an all-male neighborhood.

Unfortunately, we can’t change the hand
we’ve been dealt. The houses aren’t going to
be moved, and life — for the time being — will
continue to revolve around fraternity parties.

Inside this system, however, it’s time for
serious change. It’s time that W&L students
stop treating date rape and sexual assault like
they were irrelevant or unimportant.

It’s time that the average student got off
his (or her) lazy butt and stopped letting IFC
and Panhel do all of the heavy lifting. Change
come by decree, even it it’s a group of other
students working for change.

If W&L’s Greek scene wants to continue
its tradition as one of the nation’s strongest,
change is a necessity. It’s time the Greek com-
munity gets on board.

Stop faking, eat real food already

Enough with pretending a salad is a burger; go ahead and eat a second helping

By Grace Andrews
c o L u M N I s 7

One of my favorite topics is perception, or
‘wetter yet, realistic self-perceptions. I was talk-
ing with my roommate the other day about the
growing epidemic that plagues this campus~
people being unrealistic/pretending when it
comes to their eating habits and body types.

Let me give an example of what I am talk-
ing about. For those of you familiar with the
Marketplace or the Co-op, you’ve probably‘
overheard a conversation that usually went
something like this:

Person 1 : Oh my gosh, I’m so hungry. I feel
like such a pig. I ’m going to eat my whole body
weight in food. (This would not be much, es-
pecially since the young woman looks like she

.4/lay be the distant cousin of a scrawny Kansas
scarecrow.)

Person 2: Really, what are you going to
get?

Person 1: I’m not sure...something fatten-
ing and full of calories. You know how I LOVE
to eat. I just can ’t believe how ravenous I am. I
can't wait to pile my plate up with food.

Person 2: Ok, well that sounds great!

So that wasn’t necessarily a conversation
that you would hear verbatim, but you get the
idea. Especially if the individuals speaking
look like a strong wind could carry them to
Buena Vista!

. The pair, usually young ladies then walk

away with a colossal plate (insert sarcasm
here) consisting of a ginormous piece of let-
tuce, a slice of deli meat, half a piece of whole
wheat, low carb, unreﬁned long-grain bread,
and a lone baby carrot. The plate is so pathetic
that it makes any self-respecting food lover

_ want to cry.

Usually, the pair will have what I call the
“hungry look” in their eye. When I see them, I
usually daydream of throwing chicken at them
in hopes that they’ll catch it with their mouth.

These hungry types seem to always be the
ones talking about how ravished they are, but
they never seem to be eating any thing of sus-
tenance.

Now, I’m going to need people on this cam-
pus to unapologetically participate in the won-
derful life process that some of us call eating!
I’m not advising that everyone eat junk all the
time or commit my favorite deadly sinwglut-
tony—but I do advise that people stop obsess-
ing over everything they eat or how they look.

If you know you’re hungry, eat, and do so
shamelessly. Or, for those of you who are not
huge eaters, STOP pretending that all you do
is eat.

Since I’m not blind, and have two function-
ing eyeballs, I can tell that you may not eat as
much as you pretend. '

This does not actually bother me; I just
need people to not talk about eating a lot when
they do not. It vexes my spirit because it seems
as if the individuals who do so are only doing

it because they feel they need to prove to oth-
ers that they do eat.

If you’re thin and you know you are healthy,
don’t worry about it. I, myself am a lover of
food and will tell anyone within a 50 mile
radius about how I eat, but then again when
people look at me, they don’t question my eat-
ing habits (insert smiley face here).

Another pretending issue that I’ve noticed
that some students, especially women, in the
student body consists ofipretending that they
are “overweight.” If I hear one more young
woman talk about how fat she is, knowing
good darn well that she wears single digit siz-
es, I may have to force feed someone.

I think that many of us have our bad days
when we do not see exactly how fabulous we
may look or be, but I think that it’s time for us
to get our lives together and be honest.

There is nothing wrong with going back
for seconds or even staring in the mirror and
admiring how good your reﬂection looks. Just
don’t get so wrapped up in yourself that you
begin reciting a little ditty called “mirror, mir-
ror, on the wall. . .”

If you ask me, life is far too short to keep
bothering everyone with an unrealistic ideal of
who you are or ought to be.

I sincerely hope that if you’re reading this,
you aren’t one of these “unrealistic” people
I’m talking about. If you are, I suggest that you
get your life together and start being real with
yourself and those around you!

Inspiring Art

Bill White exhibit brings Italy to Lexington

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
3 TA F F W R [T E R

Truth be told, I have an unexplainable infatuation with Italy. Under-
standably, I love its food, but I ﬁnd that my obsession goes somewhat .
deeper than culinary appreciation. I ﬁnd its culture and history fascinating
and its landscapes incredible. However, the art is, in my opinion, the most
exquisite and poignant aspect of Italian culture. Taking this into consid-
eration, one can only imagine my excitement when I discovered that an
exhibit entitled “In the Light of Italy,” by Bill White, was being shown in
Holekamp Gallery.

White is a professor of painting, drawing and contemporary art history
at Hollins University. Always conscious of his artistic ambitions, ‘

He attended the Philadelphia College of Art for his undergraduate
study and earned his M.F.A.i from the Tyler School of Art at Temple Uni-
versity. As his work makes evident, White adores color and utilizes it in
unexpected ways. His paintings can be found in both private and public
collections.

His art has been shown in upwards of twenty solo exhibits and has
been selected for over seventy-ﬁve juried shows. One of his oil paintings,
“Studio Light Suite,” is owned by the Art Museum of Western Virginia.

As the title of the exhibition reveals, the works were done in Italy.
White, the artist, ventured there in 2006. While on sabbatical from his
position at Hollins University, White traveled to explore the Umbrian re-
gion of Italy. Here, he found the inspiration for the collection of works
currently on display. During August 2006, White painted scenes from the
small towns of Todi and Monte Castello de Vibio.

The exhibit consists of wash drawings and casein paintings. The eight
drawings in the gallery were done with a black roller ball pen. White
added washes of color with walnut ink.

The four paintings were done with casein, a milk-based paint that can
be buffed to look like oils or left to dry with a matte ﬁnish. All of the
works were done plain air, or alfresco as the Italians say.

Each of the White’s works depicts a different part of Italian architec-
ture. He paints everything from piazzas to courtyards, churches to tree
lines, and schools to houses.

His interpretation of the culture is present in every stroke of his brush
and every line of his pen. He pays special attention to capturing the inten-
sity of the summer light in Italy. '

White found that the atmosphere in Europe provided a startling con-
trast to the hazy light of Virginia. He chose to portray this intensity in the
shadows and patterns of the architecture depicted in his work.

As I left the gallery, I took a glance at the guestbook. Besides the usual
space for names, there was an entire column devoted to thoughts. Page
after page of compliments and enthusiasm for, this exhibit. Words such as _
“moving',”; i‘exiiberant,’7=arnd~even “snazzy” wereused. I'tho_ught'for'a-mo—i. i_ _
ment, wondering how snazzy could be used to describe a piece ;a1'.t,:.ar:1_d pj ff _
then came to a realization. I understood that White achieved whatevcry -   I
artists seeks to achieve: for his work to inspire people who ?see it. .

Rough road trip for men’s bball

Team plays some close games but goes 1-3 _against s top teams; they ’ll look to bounce back at home on Wednesday

By Hank Nathan
surr warren

After defeating arch-rival Roa-
noke College in overtime, the Gen-
erals traveled to face No. 16 Guil-
ford in a battle for supremacy of the
ODAC. This was the second of four
road games against the four best
teams in the conference, not includ-
ing Washington and Lee. Ben Strong

. of Guilford, the defending Division

III player of the year, and Greg Bi-
enneman are the two leading scorers
in the conference respectively. Strong
averages 25.4 and Bienneman aver-
ages 23.2 points per game. The Blue
and White lead the conference in ﬁeld
goal shooting at 50.1 percent while
the Quakers lead the conference in
ﬁeld goal defense at 36.1 percent.
This game had all the markings of a

game. With 16 minutes left to play,
junior Chris McHugh sank a three to
cut the deﬁcit to 10. One minute later,
Bienneman scored his ﬁrst two points
of the game on two free throws. Bi-
enneman then hit his ﬁrst shot from
the ﬂoor on the next possession, but
W&L remained down by 10.

With 12:10 remaining, freshman
point guard Jason Cimino drilled a 3
pointer on the offensive end and then
drew a charge on the defensive end to
give W&L some momentum in an ef-
fort to come back. Guilford was called
for a technical foul after arguing the
call and Cimino netted a foul shot to
bring the team within 4, 44-40.

Junior captain Isaiah Goodman
credited the ability to come back to
the maturity of the team.

“We knew we were going to come

“Everyone in the country knows that the ODAC

means business, and to be one of those teams that

everyone is talking about is cool. I think the past few

games show that we are serious contenders not only

in the ODAC, but in the region, and country. ”

Isaiah Goodman, junlor guard

close contest.

Both teams started out of rhythm,
missing their ﬁrst three attempts until
Guildford hit a shot nearly two and
a half minutes into the game. W&L

.. continued its cold streak when junior
.. {Kirk Jones nailed a three-pointer a
irninute and a half later. The Quakers

then proceeded on a 9-0 run to make
the score 11-3. Jones sank his second
three of the game to thwart the run
with more than 13 minutes left in the
half, but the Generals remained out of
sync.

W&L was plagued by uncharacter-
istically poor shooting and foul trou-
ble in the ﬁrst half. Both Bienneman
and co-captain Femi Kusimo got two
early fouls and were forced to sit on
the bench. Because of the foul trou-
ble, Bienneman did not score a single
point in the ﬁrst 20 minutes while
Strong had eight. The score at half
was 30-20 in favor of the Quakers.

Guilford came out hot in the sec-
ond half, knocking down two three-
pointers to give the team a 16-point
advantage. Jones, undeterred, opened
up the second stanza the same as the
ﬁrst by hitting his third three of the

back,” said Goodman. “It just shows
how much we’ve grown. We weren’t
worried about the deﬁcit, and we
found a way to come back. The tough
part is that they [Guilford] were No.
16, so they were good enough to hold
us off.”

McHugh narrowed the score to
tvvoon another three-pointer with
seven minutes to play. Strong subse-
quently hit a layup and received a foul
call a few trips later, but Bienneman
countered with a two to cut the lead to
threer. However, on the next posses-
sion, Strong, matched up against Bi-
enneman, drew a foul on Bienneman
which was his ﬁfth and he was out of
the game with 5:48 leﬁ.

The teams traded baskets until
Kusimo scored three of the next four
points from the foul line to decrease
Guilford’s lead to one. After a de-
fensive stop by the Generals, Jones
cashed in his ﬁfth three-pointer of
the game with 2:51 remaining, giving
W&L its ﬁrst lead since the early por-
tion of the game, 58-56. Guilford an-
swered immediately to knot the game
and then scored again to regain a two
point advantage. This time, McHugh

responded by converting on two shots
from the charity stripe to deadlock

. the game at 60-60. The comeback ul-

timately ended as Strong scored the
next four points in the game from the
foul line to give the Quakers a 64-60
victory.

This lost snapped W&L’s six game
winning streak, but showed that the
team is ready to compete with any-
one, said Goodman.

“It’s like were playing in the ACC
or the Big East of Division III,’’ said
Goodman. “Everyone in the country
knows that the ODAC means busi-
ness, and to be one of those teams
that everyone is talking about is cool.
I think the past few games show that
we are serious contenders not only
in the ODAC, but in the region, and
country.”

Coach Adam Hutchinson said the
schedule down the stretch will show
how good this team is and the Guil-
ford game exempliﬁes how far this
team has come.

“We have a chance over the re-
mainder of the schedule to mea-
sure ourselves against the rest of
the ODAC,” said Hutchinson. “Our
ability to erase such a deﬁcit on the
road speaks to how much this team
has matured and how much poise we
have when facing adversity.”

The Generals rough times con-
tinued this weekend when the lost to
Randolph-Macon on Saturday and
were easily defeated by Virginia Wes-
leyan on Sunday.

Randolph-Macon came out on ﬁre
from behind the arc, shooting 66.7
percent from three point range in the
ﬁrst half en route to a 41-32 lead at
the break. The Generals failed to chip
away at the lead in the second half,
getting no closer than nine with four
minutes to go as the Yellow Jackets
cruised to a 78-66 victory. Bienemann
led the Generals with 22 points.

On Sunday, it was the Generals
who jumped out to an early lead, scor-
ing the ﬁrst six points of the game at
Virginia Wesleyan. However, that was
the last time the Generals would have
a lead as the Marlins took control and
extended their lead to 14 at the half.
In the second half, the Marlins used
a 13-0 run to go up by 25 with seven
minutes to play. Bienemann was the
only General in double ﬁgures with
16 points. '

The Generals will look to rebound
when they host Emory and Henry on
Wednesday night.

Golfers bug Tiger
at their own peril

Talking trash about the best golfer in the
worldjs a safe way tomake him mad

By Adam Lewis  I
COLUMNIST

Would you ever be quoted saying that Albert Einstein’s accomplish-
ments in the ﬁeld of physics were “just alright”? That given the right
circumstances, you could have come up with ideas comparable or better
than his Theory of Relativity? That hisintelligence is beatable? That
his awards, “you lcriow the ones ‘he Wonfor making earth-shattering dis-'
coveries, don’t really mean anything? Probably not, right?

Well let’s liken physics to golf, awards to tournaments, intelligence
to athletic prowess, and ﬁnally, Albert Einstein to Tiger Woods. See
where I’m going with this?

It seems preposterous to challenge the intelligence of arguably the
smartest man ever, so why do golfers constantly call into question the
skill of the best golfer in the world? Of course,I am referring to the
recent remarks of Ian Poulter, and the ensuing results on the golf course.
But before I get to "‘Cou1ter,’Irn'can Poulter (sorry, I oﬁen COI1ﬁlS6 idiots),
let’s look at some other highly intelligent individuals who have called
out Tiger.

_ Stephen Ames. In 2006, just prior to the World Golf Championships-
Accenture Match Play Championship, Ames, who only made it into the
64-person tournament because of another player’s withdrawal, decided
to call.out Tiger, his ﬁrst round opponent: “Anything can happen, es-
pecialfy where he’s hitting the ball.” He then went on to tell the Golf
Channel, “As bad as he [Tiger] hits it, he still manages to win golf
tourn ents.”

Oh Stephen. Tisk, tisk, tisk. You want to know why this was a bad
idea? Well, Tiger went on to win the matches nine and eight, which
means he was up nine strokes with eight holes to play, the earliest a
player can declare victory in match play. Further, aware of the down-
side to ignorantly running your mouth, Tiger‘ responded simply by‘ stat-
ipg his reaction to Ames’ comments in three words: “nine and eight.”

_« Rory Sabbatini. This past spring, Sabbatini drew media attention
when he took ; lead at the Wachovia Championship into the ﬁnal round,
only to lose by four strokes to Woods. Subsequently, this South African
brainiac decided to speak out aﬁer getting destroyed by Tiger, stating
that “he [Tiger] is more beatable than ever.”’ ‘

What happened next? Well, just a few tournaments later, Tiger
trailed Sabbatini by one stroke after three rounds at the Bridgestone
Invitational, then.«.sh9t,a;_ﬁnal round .65 to beat Sabbatini by eight. Not
exactly beatable’, huh Rory? Comments like this make John Daly seem
like an obese Stephen Hawking.

Now, we come to Ian Poulter. With zero PGA victories under his

belt, this Englishman thought it intelligent to preface his play at the
Dubai Classic with comments directed toward the ﬁeld and Woods. W

Conﬁdent in his improving play, Poulter asserted that “I haVen’t played
to my full potential yet. And when that happens it will just be me and
Tiger.” He even predicted a victory at the US Open. I bet you can all
guess what happened next.

Tiger toolc/‘,t_l1_e'V.to'\.1rnam‘er,il2 with,’_a "masterful Sunday round, birdying
ﬁve of his last seven holes to ﬁnish at 14 under par. But, like Poulter
said, it was just him and Tiger at the top of the scoreboard. The only
problem was that there were 38 players between them, as Poulter ﬁn-
ished one under.

Now, don’t get me wrong. I am not saying that the aforementioned
remarks by Ames, Sabbatini and Poulter were all that harsh. In fact,
they were relatively subtle. And let’s«;‘face‘ it, trash talking is a very big
part of sports nowadays. But there isa trend when it comes to talking

Tiger Woods has won rriorethan eight times as many~PGA
tournaments as Ames, Sabbatini, and Poulter combined. He has 13 ma-
jor titles, as compared to zero between the three other players. In other
words, he’s hotter than his wife and her twin doing a swim suit adver-
tisement in the Caribbean. He is not only the best current player, but he
may very well be the best player of all time.

This being said, if people refuse to challenge Einstein’s theo-
ries, then there is no reason why players should challenge Tiger’s game.
The only possible difference I can ﬁnd is that Einstein dealt with theo-
ries of physics, while challenging and beating Tiger is against the laws
of physics. »

Berry sets 5k record
at Va. Tech elite meet

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The men’s and women’s
indoor track teams traveled to
Virginia Beach Saturday for
the Vince Brown Invitational
hosted by Christopher Newport
University. 0 There, the teams
competed against teams from
D-I, D-II and D-III schools.
Despite the stiff competition,
the Generals pulled off strong
performances.

Leading the women was
sophomore Dorothy Todd, who
ﬁnished lst among D-III com-
petitors in the 800 meters in a
time of 2:28.69 and 2nd of D-
III runners in the mile. In fact,
Todd set a personal record in
the mile after crossing the ﬁn-
ish line with a time of5:26.l9.

Also leading the women was
junior Stacy Doombos who ﬁn-
ished 2nd among D-III com-
petitors in the 400 meters with
a time of 60.92, and whose time
of 7.66 in the 55 meters was
good enough for 4th in D-III.

Freshman Summer Lol-
lie also had a strong showing,
ﬁnishing 3rd among D-III com-
petitors after landing a distance
of 34’ 14.1” in the triple jump.

“It was a great experience
to be part of such a big meet,
because there were a lot of D-
I schools there as well,’’ said
Doombos. “I think it really
pushed runners on the team

_ to compete with them. I got a

chance to really focus on some

events that I have not been run-
ning for a while.”

On the men’s side, it was
junior Michael Welsh who led
the team when he ﬁnished 4th
among D-III participants in the
mile with a person best time of
4:33.31. Junior Alex Jackson
was not far behind, running the
mile in a time of4:34.44 — good
enough for 5th place.

Junior Sean Hurdiss and
freshman Jeff Giordano also

had great ﬁnishes. Both re- -

corded personal bests. Hurdiss
crossed the ﬁnish line in a time
of 23.79 in the 200 meters.
Meanwhile, Giordano ﬁnished
the 55 meters in a time of 6.67.

When asked about his ﬁn-
ish, Giordano responded, “It
feels good. But ODAC is all
that matters.” He added, “We
need to work together and stay
healthy and injury-free. Noth-
ing waschanged for this meet.
We just continue to improve as
we compete”.

“Several of the teams that
we will see in a few weeks at
ODACs were at the meet, so it
was a great opportunity to see
where everyone stands in the
weeks leading up to the confer-
ence meet.” said Todd. “I was
really excited to pass a couple
of girls from Roanoke right at
the ﬁnish of the 800. The dis-
tance crew is coming off a se-
ries of really good workouts,
and I know that everyone is
looking forward to our meet

800 by 0.01 seconds (top).

Friday night was also a
huge night for the teams. Junior
Vance Berry and junior Eliza-
beth Webb both competed at
Virginia Tech in the 5K race.
Berry ﬁnished in a time of
15:30.19, a new school record
and a time fast enough to ﬁnish
6th overall. Meanwhile, Webb
completed the race in 18:05.92
to capture 5th.

“Breaking the indoor 5k re-
cord was one of the highlights
of my career,” said Berry.

Berry’s race was full of
excitement as he was the only
non-D-I runner in the race. He
started out in last, but by main-
taining his technique, he began

to knock off the runners in the
pack. With a mile left, he had
passed two University of Mi-
ami runners and was closing in
on both the record and a runner
from Georgia Tech. V

“As the going got tough in
the ﬁnal mile, I focused hard on
each lap, trying to maintain my
form and squeeze out every-
thing I had.” commented Berry.
“Crossing the line, I passed the
Georgia Tech runner to ﬁnish
6th of nine runners, better than
I ever could have hoped in such
a strong ﬁeld.”

Both track teams will spend
the ﬁrst weekend of their Feb-
ruary breaks running at the
Armory in New York. Indoor
ODACS occur Feb. 29.

Women defeat Wasps and Wildcats

T hree-game win streak ends after 60-44 loss to Roanoke on Sunday

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

The women’s basketball
team had another full week
of ODAC play. The Generals
took on Emory & Henry Uni-
versity, Randolph College and
Roanoke College.

Washington and Lee started
the week against the Wasps of
Emory & Henry Tuesday. The
Generals started the game off
strong, scoring 50 points and
shooting 60 percent in the ﬁrst
half. Fifty points is the Gener-
als’ highest ﬁrst-half output for
the Generals since the 2000-
2001 season when they scored
59 against Lesley. W&L main-
tained a large lead for most of
the second half. Near the end
of the game, the Wasps cut
the lead to 11, but the Gener-
als stayed focused and made

late free throws to seal the vic-
tory. When the ﬁnal whistle
sounded, the Generals were on
top 82-69. W&L dominated in
nearly every aspect of the game.
It shot a high percentage, out-
rebounding the Wasps by 10
and had a season—high of 26 as-
sists. The Generals were paced
by sophomore center Kaitlyn
Kamp. She had career highs in
points (19) and rebounds (17).
She went 8-10 from the ﬁeld
and 3-4 from the line. Other
W&L players also played a role
in the victory. Junior guard
Bethany Ridenhour tied a sea-
son—high with 19 points and
tied her career-high with six
assists. Senior forward Kristen
Krouchick had 15 points along
with ﬁve assists. Senior Aman-
da Kane supplied 14 points and
a career-high of eight assists.
The Generals won two in a row

and were building momentum.
On Friday evening, W&L
took on the Wildcats of Ran-
dolph. The Generals again had
a strong ﬁrst half, jumping out
to a 32-26 advantage. The ef-
fort was led by 11 points from
senior guard Emily Wolff. The
Wildcats made a push as the
second half started and cut the
lead to two points with 10 min-
utes to play. The Generals re-
sponded with an 8-0 run. W&L
held the advantage for the re-
mainder of the contest and came
away with an 11-point victory,
62-51. W&L again controlled
the glass with 21 offensive
boards and an 11 rebound’ ad-
vantage in total. The Gener-
als also clamped down on the
defensive end, forcing 22 tum-
overs and holding the Wildcats
to just 27 percent shooting.
Several Generals stepped up in

the victory. Freshman center
Felice Herman tied her career-
high with 12 points and added
eight boards. Bethany Riden-
hour had 10 points and four as-
sists. Kristen Krouchick tallied
11 rebounds, ﬁve assists and
ﬁve steals. The Generals had a
three-game winning streak go-
ing into a big game Saturday.
On Saturday, the Generals
faced the Roanoke Maroons.
The Maroons are one of the top
teams in the ODAC with a 10-5
conference record. This game
was special, because it was part
of the WBCA’s Think Pink Ini-
tiative to help raise money in
the ﬁght against breast cancer.
W&L and Roanoke played a
hotly-contested ﬁrst half that
consisted of four ties and ﬁve-
lead changes. Roanoke pulled

heat in ongoing
investigation

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

A candidate for the prestigious Johnson Schol-
arship was hospitalized Tuesday night after at-
tending an oﬁlcampus party hosted by Phi Kappa
Psi at Fallout, a house some of their members rent
on Washington Street.

The student was staying with a freshman new
member of the fraternity.

Erin Hutchinson, the senior assistant director
of admissions and the coordinator of the Johnson
Scholarship program, refused to comment on what
she said was an ongoing investigation. Before the

V candidates arrived on campus, Hutchinson had
told current students that candidates could lose_

their offers of admission if they got into trouble
while in Lexington. She would not say whether
or not this particular student would be admitted.

The high school senior was considering swim-
ming for Washington and Lee. Men’s swimming
coach Joel Shinoﬁeld conﬁrmed that the student
was staying with a freshman member of the s /lI1'1
team during his visit.

According to one team member, Shinoﬁeld
—- a W&L alumnus who graduated in 1994 — has
told members of his team that they are allowed
to take recruits out to parties during their Visits.
However, Shinoﬁeld has told his team that it is
unacceptable for students to give the recruits the
impression that they are allowed to drink while
visiting campus. ‘

The party, billed by one member as the frater-
nity’s annual honor scholar tequila party, has been
occurring during scholarship visits for several
years.’ _

Chris Womom, President of the Interfratemity
Council, said he and other members of the group
would be looking into the party in the near future.
He said that off-campus parties lie on the border
of the council’s jurisdiction.

“lt’s outside our jurisdiction if we want it to
be, but we can take action,” Wornom said. “We
could do it or someone else will.”

Womom said it was too early to tell if the in-
vestigation would center on individual members
or the entire fraternity.

After years of research, plan-
ning and discussion, Washington
and Lee will ﬁnally welcome a
sixth sorority, Alpha Delta Pi, to
campus. Receiving the greatest
number of votes from current so-
rority women, ADPi trumped Phi
Mu and Delta Delta Delta, two
other candidate sororities chosen
by W&L for their solid national
reputations and strong values.

The first sorority extension in
2005 was unsuccessful. It is now
being implemented as part of the
W&L Strategic Plan, which was
approved with the inclusion of a
sixth sorority house, the previous
cause for contention.

Dana Smith, the assistant direc-
tor of student activities'and Greek
life, said, “ADPi showed values
congruent with W&L: a commit-
ment to compliment the current
sorority community, local alumni
and collegiate support and, a thor-
ough plan for colonization.”

Starting this fall, ADPi will
make a presence at major Greek
events in hopes of building a suc-
cessful new member class come
recruitment time. Smith said
ADPi will have a leadership con-
sultant visit the campus throughout
the fall to ensure that information
about the organization is present
at all major Greek Life events in-
cluding Meet the Greeks events,
Homecoming and philanthropy
events.

Tiffany Eisenbise, the Cam-
pus Services Manager of ADPi’s
Nationals, said, “We are eager
to start the colonization process,
where a supportive combination

*0 W&L

Alpha Delta Pi wins over Greek community,
will begin recruitment next January

of dedicated alumnae, collegians
and Alpha Delta Pi staff will edu-
cate students about the unique op-
portunity to be a founding member
of a well-respected international
organization and recruit female
students who exemplify our core
values of excellence in scholar-
ship, leadership, service to others
and sisterhood.” ’

In January 2009, ADPi will join

“We are all very excited
and hopeful that ADPi
will be successful and
have a good recruit-

ment. ”

LAUREN OTTAWAY, former Panhellenlc
Extension chair

the existing ﬁve sororities during
formal recruitment.

_ Smith added, “Representatives
from [ADPi’s] national organiza-
tion and potentially local colle-
gians will host recruitment events
in the same manner as the chapters
on campus. They will work with
Panhellenic to determine the most
suitable location for hosting these
events — a space on campus com-
parable to the size of the rooms in
the chapter houses.”

During formal recruitment
ADPi will have the opportunity to
offer up to 70 bids to establish its
colony on campus. As a result, the
other chapters’ quotas will be de-
creased from previous years in an
effort to support ADPi. Of course,
this is appropriate since the driving
force behind extension has been to

create smaller, more cohesive new
member classes and chapter bod-
ies.

The University is committed to
building a sorority house of simi-
lar design and square footage for
ADPi, which will be located to the
left of Kappa Kappa. Gamma on
sorority row. This construction is
anticipated for completion no lat-
ter than Fall 2011, although a deﬁ-
nite construction time line has yet
to be established.

While identical on the outside,
ADPi’s house will feature slight
changes to the layout of the third
floor, which will accommodate a
more strategically-located laun-
dry room and provide residential
space for 20 women. In addition,
the projected completion date will
allow the founding members to
personalize the interior space and
experience life in the house before
graduation.

Until then, new members of
ADPi will work with the Panhel-
lenic Council and the University
in ﬁnding a suitable solution for
meetings, meal plan administra-
tion and housing. It has been pro-
posed that new members could
meet regularly in one of the rooms
in the Commons and live in groups
in either Gaines Hall or the Woods
Creek Apartments.

Smith emphasized that the
playing ﬁeld for recruitment will
be equalized as much as possible.

“Panhellenic will continue to
work closely with ADPi and the
sororities on campus throughout
the spring and fall to ensure fair-
ness and understanding of the ex-
tension process,” Smith said.

Lauren Ottaway, former exten-
sion chair of the Panhellenic Coun-

oil, was responsible for sending
out the notice to all National Pan-
hellenic organizations advertising
that W&L was open for extension
in July 2007. She also worked
with the three candidate sororities
throughout their presentations to
the University and facilitated the
voting process.

“Panhellenic is very pleased
with the results,” she said. “We
had three strong sororities and
three strong choices, so the result
could not have been problematic.
We are all very excited and hope-
ful that ADPi will be successful
and have a good recruitment.”

Moreover, Ottaway believes
the addition of ADPi will ben-
eﬁt W&L’s Greek community im-
mensely. She said, “The new so-
rority will provide another option
for women who did not feel that
any of the existing sororities ﬁt ex-
actly what they were looking for.
Also, it will reduce the sizes of the
chapters, which is crucial.”

Currently, the average chapter
size is greater than 100 women.
This puts stress on dining and
meeting spaces within the soror-
ity houses, which were built for
80-90 members. In addition, the
large chapter sizes are also not re-
ﬂective of the small, community
atmosphere that many students en-
joy at W&L. It is hoped that the
addition of ADPi will ameliorate
this situation.

Smith is similarly optimistic.
She said, “This is a very exciting
opportunity for the sorority com-
munity to expand and grow. We
look forward to welcoming Alpha
Delta Pi to Washington and Lee.”

conflicts in
Middle East

Anthony Zinni will share his

experience dealingwith foreign
policy in Lee Chapel Thursday

By Wes O’DelI
STAFF WRITER

Former four-Star Marine General and
CENTCOM Commander Anthony Zinni
will speak in Lee Chapel on Thursday,
March 6 at 7:30.

Zinni, a decorated ofﬁcer who at one
time commanded all US. forces in the
Persian Gulf, was invited by the Con-
tact Committee to be the fourth and ﬁnal
speaker in their Spotlight on the Middle
East series.

According to Contact Co-Chair Neil
Sheaffer, “At the beginning of the year,
the committee decided to put together a
series of speakers about the Middle East,
which is obviously a very relevant topic
these days, and has been for a number of
years now. We have had speakers about
diplomacy, culture, and religion»-and we
wanted to touch upon the current military
issues in the region as well.”

General Zinni’s career has taken him
to over 70 different countries, including
combat service in Vietnam, Somalia and
Iraq.

The general has received a great deal
of media attention for his early opposi-

tion to the Iraq War, particularly the post-
battle occupation strategy. Said Sheaffer:
“He should also bring an interesting per-
spective as he has been a vocal critic of
the Bush administration and the decision
to invade Iraq.”

Logan Gibson, Contact’s other Co-
Chair, said Zinni has also been mentioned
as a possible Vice Presidential candidate
for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama.

“There are few topics that are more
relevant to all Americans right now than
the war,” he added. A

Zinni also has ‘a Lexington connec-
tion: he has lectured at over 50 universi-
ties, including a period as a professor of
International Studies at VMI.

Sheaffer believes Zinni will be a “per—
fect speaker...he is very knowledgeable
about the topic and the region.”

The general will also address the
Weapons of Mass Destruction class at 4
p.m. Thursday. The talk will be in Com-
mons room 345.

The Lee Chapel talk will be followed
by a reception at the Alumni House.

W&L gathers to ‘Take Back the Night”  

Sexual assault victim shares her experience in hopes of spreading awareness

By Dane Davls
surr wmrrn

In order to raise awareness
about sexual assault victimizing
women on campus and through-
out the world, W&L held a ‘Take
Back the Night’ rally last Thurs-
day in Cohen Amphitheater. The
vigil, organized by SPEAK and
Dr. Jennifer Sayre of University
Counseling Service, included a
speaker in Stackhouse Theater
and personal testimonies of sex-
ual violence.

The night began with a talk
by Dr. Michael Kimmel in
Stackhouse Theater, entitled
‘“Mars and Venus,’ or Planet
Earth: Women and Men on
Campus in a New Millennium.”
As an expert on masculinity, Dr.
Kimmel explained the complex
social interactions that charac-
terize college campuses across
the country. Highlighting the
rapidly—changing state of gen-
der relations around the world,
Dr. Kimmel described how nu-
merous problems and issues
facing the sexes can be resolved
through dialogue and coopera-
tion.

The event then moved out-

side to the Cohen Amphitheater,
where a candlelight vigil was
held to shed light on sexual as-

sault. Dr. Jennifer Sayre, one
of the main event organizers,
opened with statistics about sex-
ual assault on college campuses
nationally. The facts alone,
however, were unable to con-
vey the immense personal and
psychological effects resulting
from sexual victimization.

One W&L student gave her
account of being sexual assault-

ress.”

‘Take Back the Night’ is a
nationally-recognized event,
originating in 1977. The term
“Take Back the Night” began as
a memorial read by Anne Pride
at an anti-violence rally. Since
then, thousands of marches
and vigils have been held in
the United States and across
the world. While each rally is

ing...Being a part of such a moving event

with students and faculty gives me hope

that change will come. ’

ed, forcing attendees to reﬂect
on the grave state of gender re-
lations at the university. Attend-
ees then lit candles and marched
through campus as a visible sign
of support for victims of sexual
assault.

“It is important for our cam-
pus,” said senior Paten Hughes,
president of SPEAK. “It used to
be that you couldn’t talk about
sexual assault in a safe way...
but now we are making prog-

 
 

unique to the community host-
ing it, most share accounts by
individuals who have been vic-
tims of sexual violence. Accord-
ing to the organization that initi-
ated ‘Take Back the Night,’ the
common theme is “the assertion
that all human" beings have the
right to be free from violence,
the right to be heard, and the
right to reclaim those rights if
they are violated.

With the Washington and

‘»._.r~_i ‘ 3 '. »~ ‘ .2

Lee’s above-average rankings
in sexual assault and rape, the
rally was especially relevant.
The rally brought diverse el-
ements of the community to
together in order to break the
silence’ on the problems facing
women here on campus. As the
school engages in frank discus-
sions about its culture and the
interactions between men and
women on campus, ‘Take Back
the Night’ helped students and
faculty explore and understand
the complex and troubling issue
of sexual assault.

Charles Heaps III, a sopho-
more and attendee said, ‘‘I found
the event moving and eye-open-
ing on the trouble and problems
that plague our campus. As a
student, the speaker brought
into focus the disheartening re-
ality of sexual assault on this
campus. However, being a part
of such a moving event with stu-
dents and faculty gives me hope
that change will come.”

“I was excited about how it
went,” said Hughes. “I was im-
pressed with the turnout.”

likely be one event among many

as the university continues to '

ﬁnd solutions for the problems

on campus.

. Castro as the ultimate puppeteer

ACastro by any other name is still a Castro; out of sight but not out of mind

 

 

 

By Abel Delgado
STAFF WRITER

It wasn’t supposed to end this
way. The cruel dictator who out-
lasted nine U.S. presidents was
supposed to'be deposed, rot in a
Hague prison, or._at least die in
power, leaving his hypocrisy of a
revolution in shambles.

Instead, Fidel Castro once
again outwitted us all, resigning
as President of the Cold War relic
and tropical gulag we call Cuba
and paving the way for his brother
and others to cement their power
before his death.

No one thought Castro would
ever voluntarily give up power.
Few realize he still hasn’t.

Castro fooled the entire world
yet again. His resignation as the
Cuban Head of State is seen as
a chance for change in a country
that has been under his control for

nearly 50 years.

World leaders expressed hope
that Raul Castro, Fidel’s pur-
portedly more practical and less
adored younger brother, would
loosen up the archaic economic
policies that have left Cuba in
poverty.

While some on the left made
sure to compliment the older Cas-
tro’s rule, leaders from all over the
political spectrum suggested now
would be a good time for Cuba
to release its political prisoners.
Many Cubans on the island were
expecting a new generation of
government leaders to take over.

All wondered what a Raul
Castro Regime would mean. We
won’t ﬁnd out soon. _

While Fidel Castro did resign
from two of his three posts, the
one he didn’t resign from, Head
of the Communist Party, is the
most powerful and inﬂuential, ac-

cording to the Communist Consti-
tution.

Raul Castro’s ﬁrst act as the
nation’s “leader” was to ask the
rubber stamp of a parliament per-
mission to consult with his older

los Lague Davila, a prominent
younger politician who was part-
ly responsible for the economic
reforms that saved the Cuban
economy from utter obliteration
once the Soviet Union fell, Raul

brother on all decisions involv-
ing “defense, foreign policy, and
socioeconomic development,”
meaning basically anything that
matters. Of course, the parlia-
ment agreed.

Instead of choosing Car-

and Parliament chose J osé Ramon
Machado Ventura, a 76-year-old
member of the old guard known
as “Communist Hardliner” to be
First Vice President.

The decision even dismayed
young Castro supporters who

were told their generation would
begin to have a say.

The vice presidential choice
discredits any hope of economic
reform on the island, and those
who think Human Rights would
begin to be respected under Raul
Castro are either grossly unaware
of his record as Defense Minister
or just plain fooling themselves.

Just ask the men, women and
children of the Cambio Movement
(Spanish for change) who have
been arrested, interrogated and
beaten simply for wearing white
wristbands that say “change” on
them.

In Raul Castro’s Cuba a wrist-
band is reason enough to be beat
by state police while in a local
church. So what’s the change
between Raul and Fidel’s Cuba?
Nothing. '

There is no change because it
is still F idel’s Cuba. Raul is unbe-

lievably loyal to his brother and
knows full well that he is nothing
without him.

The Communist Party knows
that without F ide1’s charisma and
appeal to ignorant “cappuccino-
communists,” they have no stand-
ing both abroad and at home.

And we all should have been
wise enough to know the Fidel
Castro’s ego is much too large to
be hampered by a life-threatening
disease.

So they played a game with
us.

They led us to believe some-
one else was pulling the strings.

Meanwhile, the puppet master
lies in bed, in pain but with a smile
on his face, knowing full well he
has tricked the world into think-
ing his reign is over, and knowing
full ‘well that couldn’t be further
from the truth.

Secret to sucess: whatever it takes

Nabor is Alternative Feb Break trip to a prep school focuses on minority students entering college

By Jess Stelnmetz
STAFF WRITER

While most Washington and
Lee students were going to Flori-
da or hanging out with high school
friends at home over February
break, 12 students volunteered at
YES Prep in Houston.

We had the opportunity to
work with students in three dif-
ferent campuses and see why so
many in Houston rave about YES
Prep.

YES Prep is a charter school
that primarily serves minority 6-
12 grade students from economi-
cally disadvantaged backgrounds.
Eighty-eight of the students are
ﬁrst-generation college—bound
and nearly all are at least one
grade level behind.

The typical YES Prep student
is one that most public schools

fail to properly educate.

The success of YES Prep is as-
tounding. YES Prep’s goal is for
all graduating seniors to be ac-
cepted to a four-year college.

The statistics of their alumni
show that YES Prep is clearly on
the right track: 90 percent of YES
alumni have either graduated or
are still enrolled in college.

This can be compared to the
national average of 50 percent for
all ethnic groups and a discour-
aging 22 percent for low-income
students.

How is YES Prep so success-
ful? After a week at one of the
campuses, my best summary is
their motto: “Whatever It Takes.”

At the beginning of each year,
all teachers, parents and staff sign
a contract that they will do what-
ever it takes to meet the YES mis-

sion of collegiate success.

The staff holds high expecta-
tions for their students and gives
them every opportunity to be suc-
cessful.

Not only is the school day
longer than normal, but there is

‘ who need help with homework.

The entire YES experience fo-
cuses on college.

All homerooms are named af-
ter colleges attended by the teach-
ers. Teachers regularly discuss
college life in their classrooms

Every day I volunteered at YES Prep ,

at least a dozen middle school students

would come up to me, shake my hand and

introduce themselves.

Saturday school every month that
focuses on service.

Teachers stay at school for long
hours and are required to be avail-
able for phone calls from students

and students are clearly energized
by the thought of selecting a col-
lege.

long trips to visit colleges in dif-

Evi root of steroid abuse? $ Money $

Baseball is a business; fans wanting a cleaner sport can boycott for changes

By crlghton Allen
STAFF WRITER

I have read, discussed, and
heard far more about steroids in
baseball in the last few weeks of
my sports writing class than is
reasonable. It is my hope that this,
my ﬁnal opinion on the subject
for quite a while, will be cathartic,
purging me of the sick taste this
scandal has left in my mouth.

The crux of this discussion
rests on the question: why do
Roger Clemens and company risk
their careers and reputations by
cheating?

On a superficial level, it is
because they thought they would
never be found out. This belief is
a chief reason most people com-
mit illegal or unethical acts.

Do you think Bill Clinton
would have spent half his political
career playing footsie (and other
games) with interns if he knew it
would all blow up in his face and
land him on Capitol Hill in front
of a hostile Congressional Com-
mittee?

Of course not, and the same
is true with professional athletes
who use steroids.

Caught up in a desperate race
to make it in the league and pro-
long playing careers that their
bodies tell them are past their
prime, players turn to steroids and
HGH to give them a leg up on the
competition. ‘

Make no mistake about it, for
the 25 roster spots on every Major
League Baseball team, there are

literally hundreds of players ca-
pable of ﬁlling them out.

Think sorority rush is competi-
tive? That’s a Girl Scout meet-
ing compared to making it to the
show; several miles an hour dif-
ference on a fastball or ten feet
traveling distance on a long ﬂy-
ball can mean the difference be-
tween strikeouts and homeruns
and a roster spot, or meatballs and
flyouts and posting your resume
on Monster.com.

But blind arrogance and sheer
stupidity in thinking they won’t

hard to pass up if you knew a way
to bridge that gap? Yeah, I thought
so.

Really, isn’t this same sce-
nario why some college students
use prescription drugs such as
Adderal (without prescription)
to help them study during exam
time? It is really an easy conclu-
sion to reach: good grades=nice
job offer=fat salary.

Regardless of how many ball
players are dragged before Con-
gress to testify or players sus-
pended or how many times a for-

get caught can’t be the ultimate
reason athletes use steroids.

The main culprit behind the
cheating is the almighty dollar.

The last several generations
of young Americans have been
taught by mass media to worship
money and glorify its accumula-
tion.

The MLB league minimum
for a player on a roster for 2008
is $390,000. In comparison, the
average American worker makes
only $46,201.

Would the difference between
the two salaries, $343,799, be

lom-looking Commissioner Bud
Selig appears before the press and
reafﬁrms MLB’s commitment to
reform, baseball will not come
clean from steroids.

No, the game will not clean
itself up because baseball, when
played at the professional level, is
no longer the quaint Great Ameri-
can Pastime; it is a business and
everything that goes with it.

Owners of professional base-
ball clubs are not ﬁnancing a team
to provide the fans with entertain-
ment out of generosity; they treat
it as another business venture from

which to make a proﬁt. Owners
make most of their money from
ticket sales and there lies the key
to cleaning up the game.

Fans, by their refusal to go
watch baseball games in protest of
steroid abuse, can be an effective
force of change. We can effec-
tively hold MLB hostage. With-
out butts in seats, baseball can
generate little revenue and will be
forced to bow to our demands and
clean itself up.

It pains me to say,, so, but as
effective as a fan boycott can be,
fans are not going to totally clean
up an institution as massive as
MLB baseball.

Ultimately, every man must
make the choice of whether or not
to cheat in his own heart and live
the consequences. We can, how-
ever, play a large part in restoring
some of the lost luster to a game
that once helped give America its
national identity.

My little brother is ten years
old and plays baseball for a youth
team in our hometown and idol-
izes the Atlanta Braves’ players,
especially Chipper Jones. Yet,
maybe it should be the other way
around.

For baseball in its purest form,
the way it was meant to be played,
is found nowhere near any profes-
sional stadium; it is found on rec
league ball ﬁelds in Thomasville,
GA and other small towns across
America, in the hearts of kids like
my brother, the future and hope of
professional baseball.

ferent parts of the country. The
typical YES Prep graduate visits
colleges in California, Washing-
ton, D.C., West Texas and the
Midwest.

The students at YES Prep are
very privileged in that they are
given countless opportunities that
they would never otherwise even
dream of if they attended their
districted school.

Every day I volunteered at
YES Prep East End, at least a
dozen middle school students
would come up to me, shake my
hand and introduce themselves.

While I love my 6th graders
that I teach here in Lexington and
think the world of them, I would
be completely shocked if this hap-
pened to our volunteers.

YES Prep not only focuses on
academics but also on building

positive relationships and achiev-
ing social justice.

YES stands for “Youth En-
gaged in Service”. YES students
complete monthly service projects
and log hundreds of service hours
throughout their seven years.

In a country where schools
have continually failed minority
and economically disadvantaged
students, YES Prep is diminish-
ing the achievement gap and giv-
ing its students an opportunity to
be truly successful.

As the staff members continu-
ously remind their students, any
student, regardless of the color
of his or her skin or his or her
family’s educational or economic
background, can be successful
and graduate not only high school
but also college.

Wake-up call

Lecture discusses youth drinking

By Queenle Wong
STAFF WRITER

Young drinkers are more vulnerable to the effects of al-

I , A cohol and drugs than adults, a Duke University neuropsy-

chologist said to a packed Stackhouse Theater Tuesday.

Dr. Scott Swartzwelder, who wrote more than 100 sci-
entiﬁc papers and four books on the topic, discussed re-
search ﬁndings in rats and humans that showed alcohol
causes more damage to the developing brains of adoles-
cents.

“Our behavior has a lot to do with those critical ﬁnal
years of brain development,” Swartzwelder said in a Pow-
erpoint presentation.

Young drinkers are more sensitive to memory impair-
ment but less sensitive to the sedative effects of alcohol,
he said. This makes it easier for adolescents to drink ex-
cessively to the point of harm.

Swartzwelder’s study compared how alcohol consump-
tion affected the hippocampus of adolescent and adult rats,
a structure in the brain critical for learning and memoriza-
tion.

Alcohol damages the brain by disrupting synaptic plas-
ticity, the ability of two neurons to change in strength,
largely in the hippocampus, he said.

Researchers found that alcohol, which Swartzwelder
characterized as a “powerful drug,” impaired the ability
of younger rats to memorize maze patterns more severely
than adult rats.

Submerged in a tub of water, the rats were required to
locate a platform and swim to it. Researchers found that
adolescent rats under the inﬂuence of alcohol had more
trouble locating the platform than adult rats.

In another experiment at Duke University, Swartzweld-
er studied the effect of alcohol on 20 to 29-year-old stu-
dents. With a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08, students
in their early 20s had more difficulty memorizing patterns
than students in their late 20s.

Researchers found similar results in marijuana use, but
Swartzwelder did not discuss drug use as thoroughly be-
cause of the limited time of the lecture.

The audience also watched video clips from the com-
edy “Dude, Where’s my car?” and a commercial for Span-
ish sparkling water, which showed a man waking up with
multiple piercings after a blackout.

“We make a joke out of a very serious neurological
event” he said.

Despite lecturing to a college campus for the ﬁfth time
known for its heavy alcohol use, Swartzwelder empha-
sized at the beginning of the presentation that he was a _
scientist not a motivational speaker.

The point of the lecture was to provide students with
the information they need to make informed decisions
about alcohol and drug use, he said.

Residential Assistant Aaron Albert said that he thought
the speaker’s method was effective.

“I like that he presented the facts, as he said he was
a man of science not a man of agenda, which is good. If
[students] hear someone say don’t do drugs, drugs are bad,
[students] are not going to want to hear that message.”

Junior Erika Rost, a neuroscience major, agreed. She
said that the information was presented in a way that the
average student could understand.

“The lecture gave people more information that they
typically wouldn’t come across and it was deﬁnitely more

Battle of the Bands brings W&L musicians into the spotlight

By Michael Morella
surr wansn

F unk-rock band, the Lalai
Damas, beat out four other stu-
dent bands to win Washington
and Lee’s annual Battle of the
Bands in Doremus Gymnasium
Friday night. i

The winning group, composed
of juniors Keith Friend and Spen-
cer McElroy, sophomore Mal-
colm Hines, and freshman Robert
Wason, took home the $1,000 top
prize for this year’s event.

“I think everyone did an awe-
some job,” McElroy, the band’s
guitarist, said of all the evening’s
performers. “Quality over quan-
tity.”

He was particularly impressed
by the original songs each band
brought to their sets and that the

musicians were “bold enough” to

perform them.

“I think there should be more
stuff like this on campus,” he
said.

Hard rockers Agent Flynn
and folk-rock band Velva Bar
Lights each left with the second
and third place prizes, $500 and
$250, respectively. The other two
groups, the Southem-rockinfused
Two Dirt Road and six-piece folk
troop Rikki Tikki Tavi, complete
with mandolin and harmonica,
gave strong performances.

“It was just really great to be
singing in front of a crowd,” said
Julie Slonecki, singer, guitarist,
and pianist for Rikki Tikki Tavi.
“It was probably my biggest per-

formance.” Slonecki was the
lone woman amidst a host of
' male performers at the battle.
Bands performed sets of three
songs each, covering a vast array
of music from the more recent
Red Hot Chili Peppers and Out-
kast to classic rock standards by
the Rolling Stones and the Jimi
Hendrix Experience.

Performers were split onto“
stages at either end of the gym,
alternating their sets as fans shuf-
ﬂed back and forth to get the best
stage—side spots. ‘

“It’s really impressive that we

difference  the quality of this
year’s battle. Fans were treated
to a wealth of jokes, epic gui-
tar solos, and even a little bit

of cowbell. An elaborately de-.

signed banner reading “Two Dirt
Road” fell as the band struck their
ﬁrst guitar chord. But the Lalai
Damas had their own key to suc-
cess: matching outﬁts.

Bands were judged on their
on-stage charisma, as well as a
combination of musicianship,
originality, and the overall im-
pression they left on the crowd.

like the energy that the performers

said junior Briana Gapsis, who

The event was co-sponsored
by the General Activities Board
and the Office of Student Activi-
ties and Greek Life. Dana Smith,
Assistant Director of Student
Activities and Greek Life, said
that despite fewer contenders this
year, she was excited about the
experience each group brought to
the event.

Fans responded with home-
made signs, occasional singing
and dancing along, and plenty of
skyward cell phones during the
slower numbers. Several fans
said that despite sound issues and
a relatively low turnout, the bands
spared no expense with their per-
forrnances.

Professor Timothy Lu-
bin, Associate Professor of Re-
ligion and one of the evening’s
judges, was also pleased with the
level of competition at this year’s
event.

“If they’re all going to be pret-
ty good, it’s really hard,” Lubin
said. “It was really close.” Com-
pared to past battles he has seen
.atthe high school level, accord-
ing to Lubin, judges can typically
eliminate one or more bands be-
fore deciding on the ﬁnal winner.

“I don’t think that was really
possible tonight.”

The evening’s other judges in-
cluded Kelli Austin, Assistant Di-
rector for Engagement in Alunmi
Affairs, and Jenny Ratzel, Ad-
missions Counselor, both alunmi
of the university.

As for Professor Lubin’s fa-
vorite moment of the evening:
“Well, that was a pretty fabulous
drum display,” he said of fresh-
man Luke Ellis’ performance dur-
ing runner-up Agent Flynn’s set.
Ellis took command of the stage
with an extended drum solo be-
fore the band launched into their
ﬁnal song, an original composi-
tion that left the crowd calling for
more. .

“Regardless of placing, I’m
just happy that everyone seemed

to have a great time,” said Jamie-

Goodin, lead guitarist for Agent
F lynn. He called the event a suc-
cess in terms of the stiff competi-
tion and musicianship, as well as
its bringing together members of
the Washington and Lee campus
and community in attendance.

“I feel like it just builds the
event once again for next year.”

W&L dancers impress

Student group full of passion and talent

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
STA F F W R IT E R

The Washington and Lee Rep-
ertory Dance Company put on a
glittering performance last Friday
night. Full of unique choreography
and daring artistic risks, the entire
program was a prime sample of
several different dancing styles.
The audience enthusiastically ap‘-
plauded each segment of the per-
formance and expressed its delight
in the playful surprises of the com-
pany. Even under the pressure of
opening night, the Repertory Dance
Company successfully put together
a reﬁned and moving recital.

During the course of two years,
the Repertory Dance Company has
ﬂourished and thrived.

Through the nurturing attitudes
of both the administration and the
artists, the company now boasts
a company of 35 highly talented
members. i

Since its founding, the program
has expanded to include classes in
ballet, modern dance, dance com-
position and the analysis and his-
tory of dance.

The variety of classes facilitated
the creation of a versatile dance
company. Partnered with the clas-
sically trained dancers is a myriad
of modern, tap and praise dancers.
Each company member lends his or
her own talent and refreshing point
of view to the program.

The performance consisted
of 15 individual segments. The
students of the company choreo-
graphed several of these acts . Ni-
cole Carter,A’rese Emokpae, Molly
Harrington, Hannah ‘Kate Mitchell,

Julia Pleasants, Emily Wallace and

S Sophie Xiong acted as the student

choreographers for the recital.

A collection of faculty and guest
artists also afforded their talents for
dance composition. Assistant Pro-
fessor, Jenefer Davies, and dance
instructor, Sandra Meythaler, both
choreographed dances which made
their respective viewpoints con-
cerning the arts evident.

The " artistic contributions of
ShaLeigh Comerford, Liza Deck,
Robin Harris, Plasticmusik, Kevin
Remingotn and Claire Tunkel add-
ed a refreshing interpretation of the
music choices.

The skills of the dancers were as-
tonishing. The youth of the program
did not take away from the profes-
sional attitudes of the performers.
However, it seems that the jitters of
opening night did take their toll on
some aspects of the show. Although
obviously talented, some dancers
were not completely synchronized
with the rest of their company. The
pieces never seemed unorganized,
merely unpolished. The technical
difficulties also took away from
the audience’s experience of the
concert itself. At several points, the
lights turned on when they were not
meant to. Music also cued at the

wrong times and threw off some i

dancers for a few seconds.

Despite some minor mishaps,
the show was a success because of
the talent of the dancers, as well
as their evident passion for their
art. The performers were eager to
take risks and were fully commit-
ted to their characters. At one point,
beach balls with smiley faces were

thrown into the crowd as the danc-
ers yelled and screamed.

A screen and photographer was
the only prop for Claire Tunkel as
she danced an evocative piece.

As she danced, she was photo-
graphed and the pictures were pro-
jected to the audience by an over-
head screen.

Sophie Xiong demonstrated her
own meticulous and beautiful inter-
pretation of a peacock in a dance
named after the bird itself.

Guest artists ShaLeigh Com-
erford and Claire Tunkel danced
to excerps from “The History of

“Love.” Their striking choreography
and genuine commitment to such a a

raw piece elicited both sadness and
inspiration from the audience.

The favorites of the night includ-
ed PlasticOrganics which included
contributions from the Plasticmusik
percussion group, Some Kind of
Ship, a quirky piece involving a
colorful array of ladies’ shoes, and
Phobias, which featured the smil-
ing beach balls being thrown into
the audience.

The Repertory Dance Com-
pany performed a stunning recital.
Although hindered by a few dif-
ﬁculties, the audience was moved
and fascinated by the talents of the
dancers as well as the unexpected
artistic direction.

As the curtain fell on the stage of
Keller Theatre, the audience rose in
appreciation for the lucky opportu-
nity to watch their peers transform.

For the men, sophomore Billy Billington set a school
record and a meet record, and his throw was also good
enough for a NCAA provisional qualifying mark in the
weight toss. As a result, he took 1st in the event with his
ﬁnal throw being 16.75 meters. Billington also took sec-
ond in the shot put with a throw of 47 feet, 6 inches.

“I was happy with my 1st place ﬁnish in the weight
throw and 2nd place ﬁnish in the shot put,’,’ said Bill-
ington. “It’s always a great meet when you set personal
records in all of your events.”

Sophomore Ryan Castle was ﬁrst in the high jump
with a leap of 1.93 meters despite the meet being his ﬁrst
in weeks after recovering from an injury.

Freshman Jeff Giordano took home the bronze after ‘
ﬁnishing the 55 meters in a time of 6.55, and set a school
record after completing the 200 meters in a time of 22.89.
Giordano was also named ODAC Rookie of the Year.

“We have a great team with a ton of potential and

mented Castle on the teams ﬁnish. “I think in the future,
as our young team develops more, actually winning these
meets will be a viable goal.”

Hildenbrand continued, “I was really happy with the
way that we ran. All our training has paid off and every-
one peaked at the right time,” she said. “We are in a great
position to make a serious run at the outdoor title.”

One thing that both teams attribute their success to
is the closeness of their teams and the support of their
coaches. With these qualities, they are looking forward

Five and a half minutes later, after the Generals went down
by ﬁve, Bienemann wound up on a fast break and converted
on a layup while being fouled which could have cut the lead
to two. However, one ofﬁcial signaled it was an intentional
foul while the other foul while the other called it a travel; the
controversial ruling was a travel and resulted in the turning
point of the game. W&L was never able to decease the 5-point
deﬁcit from then on and ultimately lost 76-66.

The Blue and White ﬁnished the game with four players in
double ﬁgures. McHugh tallied a career high l7 points, 14 of
which came in the second half. White chipped in 10 points off
of the bench. Goodman added in 11. Bienemann ﬁnished by
tying the game high with 17 points which was a ﬁtting ending
to his tremendous career. Additionally, Bienemann became the
Generals’ sixth all-time leading scorer. Kusimo was saddled
with foul trouble the entire game, but still managed 13 re-
bounds, a testament to the perseverance that exempliﬁed his
career. ‘

In Bienemann and Kusimo’s four years, the Generals have
gone from 2 and 23 overall and O and 18 in the conference to
15 and 11 overall and 11 and 8 in the conference, a remarkable
turn around. Coach Hutchinson reafﬁrrned their importance to
the program by saying how far the program has come with
them at the helm.

“I feel a tremendous sense of connection with this en-
tire team, but with Greg and Femi in particular,” said Coach
Hutchinson. “We struggled together through that 2-23 season,
and we have been growing together ever since. Their tenacity
is really what made all of the improvement possible.”

Even though the team did not reach its goal of an ODAC
title, the season was still a success and another step in the right
direction.

“I think that I share with the guys a real sense of accom-
plishment about this season,” said Coach Hutchinson. “To
have a winning record in basketball in this league is no easy
thing. My hope is that we can continue to build on this sea-
son.”

Goodman said the goal for next year is not only to ascend
to the next level and bring home an ODAC championship, but
also to make Washington & Lee Men’s Basketball history.

“Our goal for next year is to win the ODAC champion-
ship,” said Goodman. “Another big goal is to have the best
all-time record at W&L. We know that those goals will take a
lot of effort, but double digit wins was supposed to be hard to
get, and we got that. A plus .500 season was supposed to be
hard to get, and we got that too.”

among the team’s starters, also has
hit three home runs while hitting in
the lead—off spot. Madden, a senior,

lead the team with 13 RBIs.

One lingering question coming
into this year was the team’s start-
ing rotation. Clayton Edwards, who
led the team in wins and innings
pitched over the last two years,
graduated last May. But Livings-
ton, who spent his ﬁrst two years
in the rotation before splitting time
last year between the outﬁeld and
pitching mound, has helped provide
stability byiopening the year 3-0

The Indoor Men’s and
Women’s Track Teams ﬁn-
ished a solid season with
strong performances Friday at
their ODAC Championships.
The women comfortably took
2nd, while the men ﬁnished
3rd—their highest placement in
10 years. Overall, the Generals
left the meet with :10 All-Con-
ference citations, three school
records and ﬁve conference
championship meet records.

The women started off strong
with the Distance Medley Re-
lay of freshman Katherine Fen-
wick, junior Tara Hildenbrand,
freshman Christine Baliseri
and sophomore Kat Telfeyan.
The women broke apart from
the pack on the ﬁrst leg. By the
second leg, there was no ques-
tion who would be winning. In
the end, the relay ﬁnished 1st in
a time of 13519.36.

In the women’s mile, the
Generals took all three med-

als, led by junior Elizabeth
Webb, who took 1st in a time
of 5:11.51. Junior Becca Tay-
lor took 2nd with a time of
5:22.85, and sophomore Doro-

man, year, I have truly

ELIZABETH WEBB, Junior captain
 

thy Todd rounded out the three
with a time of 5:27.85.

“The mile was a great race
this year,” commented Todd.
“Sweeping 1st , through 3rd
place was really exciting, and
I was so happy to be a part of
that team effort.”

“I was thrilled to win both
the mile and the 800,” said
Webb. “Ever since my fresh-

man year, I have truly longed
for the indoor 800 meter title.
I watched it slip from my grasp
on the ﬁnal straight-away in
both 2006 and 2007, but this
year, as I came down the home
stretch, I knew I ﬁnally had it,
and I could barely contain my

- excitement.” '

Webb took 1st in the ‘800
with a time of 2:21.54. Both
her 800 meter and mile ﬁnish
were good enough for meet re-
cords. Afterwards, the ODAC
named her Scholar-Athlete of
the year.

Junior Grace Andrews took
3rd in the weight throw with a
toss of 13.33 meters. Sopho-
more Maggie Sutherland set a
school record in the 55 meters
with a time of 8.91. Junior Sta-
cy Doombos jumped a distance
of 17 feet, 9 inches to ﬁnish
2nd in the long jump, while she
took 3rd in the 400 meters with
at time of 60.80.

Andrews commented that it
felt great to ﬁnish 3rd.

“Prior to last year, I had nev-
er competed in track, so to do so
well was an awesome feeling,”
she said. “I am so blessed to be
able to do a sport that I have no
background in, but totally love,
and geta medal out of it.”

Another notable event of the
night came when junior Jess
Shaw set a conference meet
record in the 5000 meters with
a comfortable 1st place ﬁnish
in a time of 17:45.85 — just 5
seconds off of a national pro-
visional time standard. Shaw’s
lead was so comfortable, in
fact, she lapped the entire ﬁeld
twice. I

“I am so blessed to have
wonderful teammates who
were supporting me around
every turn,” commented Shaw.
“There are moments when you
want to give up, but their sup-
port and encouraging words
kept me going.”

Maroons strand Generals

Roanoke is hot shooting keys 76-66 victory over men in ODAC quaterﬁnal

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
Men’s Basketball renaissance
season ended Friday after the
team fell to arch-rival Roanoke
College in the ﬁrst round of the
ODAC tournament.

The two teams split the sea-
son series with the‘Generals
winning on the road in over-
time in the second matchup.
Both teams had identical 11-7
records in conference, but the
Maroons won the tie-breaker,
making them the 4 seed and
the Generals the 5 seed. This
is the highest seed for the Blue
and White since the 1990-91
season.

The night before the game,
at the annual ODAC banquet,
W&L came away with three
prestigious conference awards.
Senior captain Greg Biene-
mann was ﬁrst team all-con-
ference for the second straight
year, the ﬁrst W&L player
to accomplish this feat in 25
years. Bienemann is also a ﬁ-
nalist for the Jostens Trophy,
the award for the Division III
Player of the Year. Junior cap-
tain Isaiah Goodman was se-
lected to the 10-player ODAC
Sportsmanship Team. Lastly,
Coach Adam Hutchinson was
named the ODAC Coach of the
Year, the ﬁrst Generals coach
to achieve this accolade since
the 1988-89 season.

“The Coach of the Year
award is actually a team hon-
or,” said Coach Hutchinson.
“It is recognition of the com-
mitment and effort this team
displayed and the success that
resulted. I am honored to have
been a part of it with this spe-
cial group of people.”

After the six-day layoff

minutes later, both teams found
their rhythm on offense as Ju-
nior Ryan Owens fed a slash-
ing sophomore, Zac White, for
the easy layup.

Roanoke then went on
a mini run to open up an 8-
point advantage, 20-12. Fresh-
man Jason Cimino ended the
run as he knifed through the

the team started out slowly in
the ODAC tournament game
against Roanoke. AJ Dowell
of the Maroons sunk the ﬁrst
two shots of the contest to give
Roanoke a 4-0 lead. Good-
man opened up the scoring for
W&L with a 3-point shot two
minutes into the game. Biene-

basket on an up-and-under
layup while being fouled, just
as he has done all year. A few

handed layup. Subsequently,
after Roanoke turned the ball
over, -White slammed the ball
home on the fast break. The
teams then traded baskets until
Goodman knocked down two
3-pointers to knot the game at
22-22 with roughly 10 minutes
left in the half.

The Maroons immediately
re-gained the lead and extend-
ed it to nine. With 3.6 seconds
remaining in the half, Biene-

mann muscled up another and-
one to give the team some mo-
mentum right before the half.
The score was 39-32 in favor
of Roanoke at the break.

That momentum at the end
of the half did not last as the
Maroons opened up the second
stanza by pushing the lead out
to nine points. Senior captain
F emi Kusimo answered with a
two from the foul line. Junior
Chris McHugh then caught ﬁre
from behind the are by sinking
three 3-pointers to deadlock
the score at 43-43.

With 11:31 left in the game,
Goodman dished to Biene-
mann for a reverse layup while
being fouled. Bienemann sank
in the free throw attempt and
gave the Generals its ﬁrst lead
in the game, 51-49. Dowell
countered with the next four
points of the game for Roa-
noke to make the score 53-51.
McHugh answered that with
his ﬁfth 3—pointer of the game
to give W&L the one-point
advantage, but the advantage
quickly evaporated and Roa-
noke re-took the lead once and
for all.

“We came back in the sec-
ond half by making some cru-

cial plays,” said Goodman.‘

“We got some stops and hit

“some big shots, but Roanoke

found a way to pull it off.”

‘The Bracket’
infuriates campus

President Ruscio implores
editor, authors to step down

By Queenie Wong
snxrr wmmz

Students, faculty and administrators are up in arms
over an annual series published Thursday by The Trident,
an independent student newspaper, that some readers say
is offensive and breaches the community’s trust.

The column in The ‘Trident, titled “The Bracket,” la-
bels speciﬁc students as “Pretentious Sluts,” “Trapped in
the Closet,” “Terrible Drunks” and “Overall Suck.” Ac-
cording to the column, the point of “The Bracket” is to
name the university’s most terrible person.

Last Friday, the university president, the student body
president and the student judicial council chair sent a let-
ter to the college community, asking for a formal apology
and the resignation of the column’s editor and authors.

“As embarrassing as the article may have been for the
individuals involved, this is even more of an embarrass-
ment to the university, our values and our traditions,” the
e-mail said.

But The Trident’s Editor-in-Chief Christina Pratt said
that the paper defends its decision to publish the column
and will not issue a formal apology.

“This article is not meant to offend anyone. It’s just a
joke. I think people need to understand that,” she said.

Pratt also said that if people are offended by the paper
they should just stop reading it.

"I believe that doing any such thing
and trying to pass it 0/?’ as journalism

is wrong and, frankly, it disgusts me. ”

 a2&___

Senior Tim Livingston, the co-author of the column
along with senior Myke Mulhern, said that he stands by
everything they wrote.

“There’s a lot of ignorance, it seems, between the
freshmen to understand that the tradition of the Raging
Intellectuals is to write this thing every year. It’s sup-
posed to be demeaning. It’s supposed to tell people who’s

terrible, and the truth is, Myke and I didn’t mean this to .

be insidious,” said Livingston.

Livingston also said that with the exception of one
joke, everything published in “The Bracket” is true.

“There are people who in my four years I’ve seen just
do terrible thing after terrible thing that deserve to be on
it. I really don’t have any guilt for putting them on,” he
said.

But sophomore Neville Fogarty disagrees.

“It offends me that these two writers think that they
are entertaining anyone in the community or providing a
service by really talking about things that have no place
in print media. . .I believe that doing any such thing and
trying to pass it off as journalism is wrong and, frankly, it
disgusts me,” said F ogarty.

Last Friday, Fogarty and eight students discussed the
column with Dean of Freshman David Leonard. At the
discussion, Leonard said that he has never seen such a
strong student response.

Although Leonard called the column “offensive,
harmful and immature,” he also urged students to think
before they act.

“It’s really easy to ﬂy off the handle and make some
errors in judgment...I think cooler heads should prevail
in terms of what can be done,” he said.

But Pratt and Livingston said that they’re not worried
about the consequences.

“I think a week, two weeks down the road, this is go-
ing to fade away,” Livingston said.

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity house (above), which commands a central location in Davidson Park, will
be empty next year. Placed on critical probation last year for hazing violations, the fraternity has now been convict-

ed for the second time and suspended for one year by the Student Affairs Committee (SAC).

SAE suspended one year for hazing violations

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

Davidson Park will be a little quieter next
year as Sigma Alpha Epsilon serves a one-year
suspension after being found guilty of hazing
violations.

The decision was handed down by the
Student Affairs Committee (SAC), a group of
faculty, administrators and students, after the
Inter-fraternity Council found SAE guilty of
hazing violations.

Half of the SAC members are students, and
the other half are administrators and faculty.

SAE’s dismissal comes nine months after
Kappa Sigma’s national ofﬁce pulled the char-
ter of the fratemity’s Washington and Lee’s
chapter after a hazing investigation. Kappa
Alpha has also been investigated by the IFC
and its national ofﬁce after the fraternity was
accused of hazing.

IFC President Chris Womom said there
were two investigations involving SAE. The
ﬁrst investigation found no substantial evi-
dence of hazing. After receiving new com-
plaints, however, the IFC launched a new in-
vestigation.

“We had an investigation based on those
complaints, and the IFC found evidence that
hazing activities had occurred, so we turned
the case over to SAC,” Wornom said.

SAE President Jim Tartaglia declined to
comment.

Womom said the hazing complaints came
from several different sources but said he
could not reveal who those sources are.

SAE was placed on critical ‘probation last
year after the IFC and SAC found evidence
of hazing violations. The W&L student hand-
book states fraternities that violate the uni-
versity’s hazing guidelines are automatically
considered for suspension or dismissal.

The handbook also states that the impact of
violations can be lessened if the leadership of
a fraternity takes immediate action to address
the violations.

Womom said the IFC urged SAE to take
this sort of action and develop a plan that
could be presented to SAC. -

Executive Committee President Josh
Payne, who is a member of SAC, said that
while SAC’s decision was a sound one based
on the information presented, he did not sup-
port suspending the fraternity.

“I think it’s too harsh. I don’t like the idea
of kicking a fraternity off that’s moving to-
wards progress,” Payne said. “I think this sets
us back because they were moving forward.”

SAE has 10 days to appeal the suspension
to W&L President Ken Ruscio, who said he
would work to make a prompt decision if the
case is appealed.

While declining to discuss the SAE case
because of the possibility of appeal, Ruscio
discussed hazing and the fraternity system.

“The university has certain standards in
place. The Greek system has standards in
place. Those are meaningless if violations
have no consequence,” Ruscio said.

Though SAE’s suspension begins im-
mediately, Dean of Students and SAC Chair
Dawn Watkins said, “as long as nothing goes
wrong,” fraternity members will be allowed to
live in the house until the end of the year and
that upperclassmen will be allowed to contin-
ue taking meals at the chapter house.

The suspension may also mean that junior
Garrett Clark, a member of SAE, loses his seat
on the IFC. Clark, who is currently a junior
justice on the council and was scheduled to
become the council’s senior justice this spring,
declined to comment.

Womom said the IFC had not discussed
Clark’s situation yet, but he did say there was
a precedent in the matter after Josh Prell, a
member of Kappa Sigma, stepped down after
his fraternity was suspended by the national
ofﬁce.

According to Wornom, there has been no
discussion of taking legal action against the
fraternity members.

“There is no precedent of legal action be-
ing pursued,” Womom said. “Rather, there’s a
focus on education and making sure the indi-
viduals and organizations understand that haz-
ing is wrong and not tolerated by the IFC, the
university or the State of Virginia.”

Fraternity fate to be
decided by SAC trial on
March I 9

By Queenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

The Kappa Alpha Order National
Administrative Office (NAO) sus-
pended some members of the campus
chapter after a non-student reported al-
legations of hazing, Director of Chapter
Services Michael Wilson said in an e-
mail Wednesday to The Ring-Tum Phi.

“Kappa Alpha Order as an organiza-
tion has a zero tolerance for hazing,”
Wilson said.

After conducting a thorough inves-

- tigation, the fratemity’s national ofﬁce

said that it veriﬁed the allegations. The
period of suspension depends on how
involved “each individual was in the
hazing, Wilson said. Suspended mem-
bers are prohibited from participating in
fraternity activities on and off campus.

The national ofﬁce would not com-
ment on how many members were sus-
pended, when the suspension oﬂicially
occurred or on the type of charges made
against the chapter.

The chapter’s president, junior Will
Porter, and KA members would also

not comment. Porter said in an e-mail
to The Ring-Tum Phi that members are
still in the ﬁnal stages of the suspension
process.

“I would say hazing is no
more of a focus now than
in the past...this year we
seem to have many re-
ported incidents, so we ’ve

had more investigations. ’

CHRIS WORNOM, IFC President
V 

The national ofﬁce conﬁrmed that
chapter members were advised not to
comment about the case.

Last month, the university’s Interfra-

temity Council (IFC) also conducted a
separate investigation of KA for similar
charges, IFC President Chris Womom
said.

Womom said that the council’s in-
vestigation conﬁrmed that the hazing vi-
olations were true. The IF C will make a
recommendation for dismissal, suspen-
sion or critical probation to the Student
Affairs Committee (SAC) March 19.

But KA, a fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee, is not the only
Greek organization at W&L accused of
hazing pledges this year.

Last week, the SAC suspended the
campus chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon for one year after hazing allegations
surfaced.

Hazing has always been a concern of
the university, Womom said.

“I would say hazing is no more of a
focus now than in the past. It’s always
been considered wrong under the IFC,
university and Virginia state law,” Wor-
nom said. “This year, we seem to have

many reported incidents, so we’ve had
more investigations.”

Although hazing is considered a
Class 1 misdemeanor under Virginia
law—an offense punishable by jail time
and a ﬁne up to $2,500—Wornom said
that the IFC’s recommendation will not
set any legal precedent.

The national ofﬁce and local alumni
will begin working more closely with
the campus chapter to make sure that
the chapter complies with the policies
of the university and the Kappa Alpha
Order, the national ofﬁce said Wednes-
day.

This increased involvement will take
many forms including more oversight
into the initiation of new members and
chapter meetings, KA’s Executive Di-
rector Larry Wiese said in an e-mail to
The Ring-Tum Phi.

“The NAO will continue to work...
to create a positive fraternal experience
for all members moving forward,” the
national ofﬁce said.

African-American art
featured in Chavis series

W&L professors oﬂer their interpretations,
explore themes of emancipation and patriarchy

Bywes O’DeIl
surr wmsn

The head of Washington and Lee’s art
department, Dr. Pamela Simpson, spoke
Wednesday on African-American art. The
speech was titled “Breaking the Chains:
African American Women and Images of
Emancipation.”

In her speech, Simpson analyzed sev-
eral pieces of African-American art, in-
cluding both sculpture and print works.

Along the way, she provided historical
commentary on the background of each
piece and the artist who created it.

She frequently invited audience mem-

bers—including philosophy professor ‘

James Mahon, history professor Ted DeL-
aney and Dean Tammy Futrell—to give
their personal “read” on the messages the
artwork conveys.

Simpson particularly highlighted re-
cent works relevant to emancipation, in-
cluding those of Mary Edmonia Lewis, a
female sculptor of both African-American
and Native American descent.

Lewis, who studied classical sculpture
in Rome, employed the neoclassical style
to create her famous “Forever Free,” an
1867 sculpture celebrating the passage
of the 13"‘ Amendment, which abolished
slavery.

“Forever Free” depicts a freed slaved
holding up his shackles in triumph while a
female companion kneels in prayer at his
right.

The audience speculated on the ﬁgures’
lack of overt African-American features
and the position of the male hand on the
female’s shoulder.

They questioned whether it was mere-
ly affectionate or could be seen as oppres-
sive.

Patriarchal themes were also identiﬁed
in Washington, D.C.’s “Emancipation”
statue, which ‘ depicts Abraham Lincoln
reading the Emancipation Proclamation to
a kneeling slave.

The model for the slave was Archer Al-
exander, the last slave captured under the
Fugitive Slave Act.

Throughout the lecture, Simpson em-
phasized the various ways in which eman-
cipation art “interacts with the audience.”

“Sculpture is a ‘high language’ of cul-
ture,” she said. W

Above all, the contemporary nature of
the works revealed the hopes and dreams
of a generation taking its ﬁrst steps away
from a history of oppression and into an
uncertain future.

Said Simpson: “We get strong ideas of
agency. . .of [the subjects] being partici-
pants in their emancipation.”

The talk was the latest in the Chavis
lecture series on African-American stud-
ies named after John Chavis, the ﬁrst Afri-
can- American student at W&L.

Phi Psi awaits punishment

Future Johnson scholars may enjoy a restricted three-day agenda

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING eonon

Two weeks after a tequila party at
a Phi Kappa Psi off-campus house left
a Johnson Scholarship candidate in the
hospital, the fraternity is waiting to
hear the disciplinary consequences it
will face from the university.

The party occurred Tuesday, Feb.
26, just hours after nearly 160 high
school seniors had arrived on campus
for the three-day, tvvo-night competi-
tion.

Erin Hutchinson, the senior assistant
director of admissions and the scholar-
ship program’s coordinator, said the
last scheduled activity for the ﬁnalists
was a panel discussion with current
students that ended at 9 p.m.

Inter-fratemity Council President
Chris Womom said the council has
completed its investigation of the party
and handed recommendations on pun-
ishment over to the Student Affairs
Committee, a group of students, faculty
and administrators that hears all frater-
nity disciplinary cases that involve the
possibility of critical probation, sus-
pension or dismissal of a fraternity.

Womom would not say what pun-
ishment the IFC suggested.

The SAC hearing is scheduled for
Wednesday, March 19.

Phi Psi President Carson Bruno
said he would not be able to comment
on the case until the SAC hearing has
been completed. -

The fraternity suspended pledgeship
almost immediately after the incident
and quickly initiated the freshmen.

President Ken Ruscio said he had
just arrived in Atlanta for an alumni

meeting and Omicron Delta Kappa
convention when he got a message
from Dean of Students Dawn Watkins
about the incident.

‘‘I was on the verge of coming back
to Lexington,” Ruscio said. _

“It was very disheartening and
disappointing, because it seemed like
the action was so clearly out of align-
ment with the [scholarship] program’s
goals.”

Ruscio said the incident may force
the university to be more explicit about
what activities prospective students
and their hosts are allowed to partici-
pate in.

He said he regretted that additional
regulations might be a necessity but
noted the importance of the Johnson
Scholarship program.

“This is destined to be the signature
program for W&L in the admissions
area,” Ruscio said.

The program brought about 160
ﬁnalists to campus to compete for 44
scholarships that cover tuition, room
and board during a student’s time at
W&L.

The program, in its ﬁrst year, was
created after alumnus Rupert Johnson
donated $100 million to the school last
spring.

Hutchinson said the Admissions
Ofﬁce has not yet started its annual re-
view of the scholarship program.

She said the department will begin
the review after its spring busy season
settles down.

Offers of admission are about to go
out to all regular decision students on

April 1, and March is always a popu-
lar month for high school students on
spring break to tour the university.

Both Ruscio and Hutchinson said
they were disappointed that the hospi-
talization had overshadowed the other
candidates and the otherwise succes.
ful weekend.

Ruscio said he hopes the incident
will help current students address risky
or dangerous party behavior.

“What this incident did was open
our eyes to the risks we sometimes
don’t see on a day-to-day basis,” Rus-
cio said.

“What we accept as routine is some-
times based on bad. judgments.”

C
A note on last week’s article

The March 3 article noted that
the scholarship candidate was
staying with a member of the swim
team and offered a confusing ex-
planation of the swim team’s re-
cruiting policy.

The candidate was not on an of-
ﬁcial swim team visit.

He was staying with a mem-
ber of the swim team, because the
Admissions Ofﬁce was short of
hosts. .

When swimming recruits are
on official visits, each one signs a
contract that states the recruit will
not consume alcohol during the
visit.

By Joel Poelhuls
STAFF WRITER

This Spring Term, freshmen will be able
to explore different disciplines and depart-
ments through 12 new seminars offered by
the university. Open only to ﬁrst-year stu-
dents, these courses will be “reading and
discussion-based with an emphasis on pa-
pers, projects, studio work, or hands-on ﬁeld
experience rather than exams,” according to
the University Registrar’s website. Most of

“Instead of being in a class of

25-3 0, you can be in a class
of 15. ”

ERIC HAMSCHERI Class of 2011

the classes have a 12-15 student limit, though
a philosophy class on the concept of honor
currently has 26 students enrolled.

Freshman-only seminars were ﬁrst of-
fered last Spring Term and again in the fall
of 2007.

Sophomore Kimber Wiggs took the ﬁrst-
year seminar Music 180: The Human Voice
last spring. She said Professor Gerald Myers
mixed lectures with student—taught classes
and interactive activities, such as measuring
the resonance of students’ voices.

“It was easy to do the exercises with a
few people in the class,” Wiggs said.

Wiggs was interested in taking the course
because of her involvement in University
Chorus. She said the class focused as much
on anatomy as on music, offering an interdis-
ciplinary approach to the topic of singing.

Professor Allison Bell is offering An-
thropology 180: Oral History as a freshman
seminar this spring. She said the course
grew out of research she has been pursuing

into rural communities, and the way their so- _

cial interactions change with modernization.
Students in her class will be assigned in pairs
to interview a local farmer about the changes
through social and agricultural history in
Rockbridge and Augusta Counties.

Bell, a Washington and Lee alumnus, said
she ﬁrst became interested in Anthropology
during an Anthropology course she took
spring term of her freshman year.

“It was the ﬁrst time it [the class] took
the academic experience outside the class-
room.”

Bell said upperclassmen interested in the
seminar topic could possibly explore it as an
independent study or audit, and should speak
to the University Registrar or the Dean of the
College.

Freshman Eric Hamscher plans to take
ﬁrst-year seminars for both of his spring
term classes. He voiced his interest in the
smaller class size provided by the seminars
and increased one-on-one time with the pro-
fessors.

“Instead of being in a class of 25-30, you
can be in a class of 15,” he said.

Hamscher said small class size is harder
to find in the entry-level classes, which most
freshmen take, than in the upper-level class-
es later on.

Texas, Ohio results topsy-turvy

Results, with the chance to end agony, extended most inconclusive primary ever

By Cody Beauchamp
co LUM msr

On March 4, Texas and Ohio
had their turn in the national spot-
light.

A huge win in either state or
a pair of small wins and Obama
would be destined to be the Dem-
ocratic nominee.

What did the two states do?

They went for Hillary Clinton,
and in doing so prolonged what
will surely go down as one of the
longest, most indecisive primaries
ever for the Democrats’ presiden-
tial nod.

Obama went into the prima-
ries (which included primaries in
Rhode Island, Vermont and, con-
fusingly, a caucus in Texas) on an
ll-contest winning streak.

But these wins were relatively
unimportant; none of them were
delegate-rich states.

Virginia and Maryland were
the big prizes of the collection
(200 delegates combined).

But even together they barely
put more delegates up for grabs
than Texas alone (193 delegates).

Still, Obama’s wins had
chipped away at Clinton’s del-
egate lead -- so much so that by

the time Ohio and Texas arrived,
it was do or die time for Hillary.

In Texas and Ohio, where she
had previously commanded dou-
ble—digit leads in the polls, Clin-
ton had to fend off Obama.

She did, and the Democratic
race remains undecided.

So what’s a Democrat to do?

It depends. Which candidate
are you rooting for?

If you actually support Clin-
ton, which I suppose is possible,
theoretically, you’ve got a few
things to hope for.

[Disclosurez If it’s not already
obvious, the author voted for
Obama in the Texas elections.]

The ﬁrst thing to hope for is
that the super-delegates don’t
jump ship and support Obama in
an effort to end the ﬁght quickly.

This is an increasing concern
for Clinton. The reasoning is that
the super-delegates tied to states
may decide to vote in step with
their states.

This might happen because no
attractive rationale exists for su-
per-delegates deciding whom to
vote for.

Neither Clinton nor Obama
are deﬁnitively left of the other.

They are both running, whether
by design or accident, on ideas
about themselves.

Obama is the “hope” candi-
date; Clinton is the “experienced”
candidate.

Neither platitude gives a su-
per-delegate more than a gut feel-
ing to go on, and after eight years

wins than Clinton has had in her
15 states.

The numbers as they stand
now, plus Obama’s ability to at-
tract record numbers. of voters in
red states, may be all most super-
delegates need.

Clinton has two more things
to hope for. First, a huge win

Neither [candidate] gives a super—delgate

more than a gut feelilng to go on, and after

eight years out of the White House, Democrats

are uncomfortable determing their candidate

based on gut feelings.

out of the White House, Demo-
crats are uncomfortable deterrnin-
ing their candidate based on gut
feelings.

Obama can make the argument
that if the super-delegates care
about what they have said—and
keep in mind the Democrats have
always been big on listening to
the people’s voice—then he is the
clear best pick.

He has won 28 states and had
more double—digit wins in those

in Pennsylvania and then North
Carolina and Kentucky would be
enough to get her back in it.

The next contest, Mississippi,
is already likely Obama’s, so her
best strategy looks a lot like her
recent stands in Texas and Ohio.

She needs to dig in her heels in
the delegate-rich states and chip
away at Obama’s lead.

If she makes it to the conven-
tion like this, then she has as good
a chance as ever at winning over

the deciding super-delegates.
Remember that the Clintons

‘have made a lot of careers in pub-

lic life and the Democratic Party.

A brokered convention is
quickly turning into an ideal sce-
nario for Clinton.

For Obama, momentum is key.
Thanks to the maddening pro-
portional allotment scheme the
Democratic Party uses to assign
delegates, Obama can still lose in
upcoming states and be ﬁne.

For instance, as long as he
doesn’t lose big he can theoreti-
cally pick up just as many dele-
gates as Hillary in Pennsylvania.

He would not have to cam-
paign as hard as she for the same
number of delegates, something
that is a decided advantage for
him.

Given that she is forced to
stand her ground in the must-win
states, Obama can expand his lead
by picking up a wide majority of
delegates in the “less important”
contests.

He has the luxury. of cam-
paigning where he wants.

There are other X-factors that
could bring a swift end to the
nomination battle.

The ever ﬁckle super-delegates
are certainly one of these.

But even more interesting is
John Edwards.

Edwards has been out of the
race for what seems like an eter-
nity. And, he has not endorsed a
candidate.

He never had a shot at winning
the nomination.

But now, he could determine
who does by endorsing either
Clinton or Obama.

He was a consistently strong
third-place ﬁnisher.

Now, Edwards could be what
sways the nomination.

As of now, no Democratic
leader has a more potent endorse-
ment in their pocket than Ed-
wards.

Welcome to the Democratic
nomination ﬁght of 2008——a
topsy-turvy world where you can
lose but effectively win, where
white men don’t have a shot at
the White House, where guessing
is as good as the facts, and losers
could decide the winners.

Consequences for what we say

Gauge meanness by possiblizy for school punishments such as time outs, spankings

By Grace Andrews
STAFF WRITER

Today’s topic is one that I feel
needs to be discussed, and that’s
unnecessariness. Let me explain:
unnecessariness is the an of do-
ing or saying something that is of
little importance, based on specu-
lations or unnecessary to life and
its vital processes.

Recently, a bracket containing
some mean and hurtful comments
was published. Sadly, many peo-
ple were named in the article and
had their feelings hurt deeply by
the information. The administra-
tion quickly admonished those
responsible and publicly con-
demned such behavior.

However, I think the entire sit-
uation speaks to another issue we‘
have on campus : the lack of com-
mon courtesy. What we need is
an overhaul of attitudes. I myself
don’t live in a dream world full of
Teletubbies, rainbows, unicoms

or dancing ﬂowers frolicking
through a ﬁeld, but I do believe
that being unnecessarily harsh
toward others constitutes a gross
waste of time and energy.

Seriously, we are all supposed-
ly adults here and should conduct
ourselves as such. The bracket
shows to what extent people can
and will go to hurt others. This
is what I like to call unnecessari-
ness. Not only do neither 1 nor
the rest of our student body need
to read salacious items in the pa-
pers or magazines that we cur-
rently have, but it misrepresents
us to other readers such as par-
ents, professors and fellow citi-
zens of Lexington.

More troubling is the fact that
this unnecessariness perpetuates
itself into our daily lives. For in-
stance is it really necessary to ask
people that you do not know well
things such as ﬁnancial status, ra-
cial make-up, romantic life, party

habits or anything remotely per-
sonal? Honestly, we know when
our comments do not add to con-
versations or help make others
feel better, so why say it? Fine,
tell your best friend, but why
publish something that will make

your body language and expres-
sions too!

For some people reading this,
that may require you to super glue
your mouth shut and/or put your-
self on speech probation for the
rest of your natural life.

Luckily our lives are not soap operas or an-

other episode of Gossip Girl, so don ’t treat it

as such. There will be no dress rehearsals or

director is cuts; this is real-life.

others feel uncomfortable on their
own campus?

The two golden rules are deﬁ-
nitely applicable in every situ-
ation: treat others as you would
like to be treated, and if you don’t
have anything nice to say, don’t
say anything at all. That goes for

That may be necessary for
people to stop partaking in unnec-
essariness. I’ve decided after the
situation on our campus that life
is too short for anyone to keep do-
ing so. Luckily, our lives are not
soap operas or another episode
of Gossip Girl, so don’t treat it

Death of traditions

By Abel Delgado
STAFF WRITER

There’s a part of me that
wants to defend the right of col-
umnists, of anybody really, to
write whatever they wish.

I strongly believe in freedom
of speech and think government
or institutional censorship ends
up hurting society more than it
does it any good. A part of me
wants to defend “The Bracket”
as an exercise in free, albeit
gross and insensitive, protected
speech but then I remember
where I am.

Both the writers of the Tri-
dent who came up with the dis-
tasteful attempt at comedy and
I write for the Washington and
Lee community.

Last I checked, this was a
community where honor and
civility still meant something if
not everything. President Rus-
cio and the heads of the EC and
SJC did an exemplary job in the
letter to the school explaining

I Honor, civility, decency used to mean something here

as such. There will be no dress
rehearsals or direc_tor’s cuts; this
is real-life and there are conse-
quences for what we say.

Now, I’m not saying don’t
vent to your best friend about that
archnemesis of yours or complain
about who has been ‘bothering
you and why, but don’t tell ev-
eryone. The entire student body
is not your best friend nor are the

‘people on your Facebook list.

It’s time people stopped be-
littling others and then feigning
ignorance. If you have something
to say to someone, take them
aside and enter into discourse
like big boys and girls. This isn’t
preschool and you won’t make
friends on the playground by talk-
ing about their mamas, pulling
hair and then pushingathem out
of the swing. I may be wrong,‘ but
doing that now may just get you
assault charges.

However, the point of my rant

is this: life is short, and you’re not
going to love everyone you meet.
That’s ﬁne, but don’t be ugly and
speak terribly of people you dis-
like to everything that breathes;
control yourself and watch what
you say. Just don’t partake in un-
necessariness; if you think that
what you are about to do or say
is going to hurt the feelings of
someone you don’t really know,
let it go.

I think you should use grade
school punishments as the ulti-
mate gauge for unnecessariness.
For instance, if something you
said would result in a) having
a time out, b) being spanked by
the principal or your parent, or
c) being jumped after school by
the other kids, then you probably
shouldn’t say or do it.

Employ these methods, and
let’s see if life for everyone, you
included, doesn’t improve!

that this community deserves
and demands better than what
this article gave. Sure, things
have changed but have they re-
ally gotten that bad?

Not only was the “The
Bracket” blatantly misogynistic
and homophobic, it called out
members of the community in
ways no one really deserves. It
was also a lame and lazy attempt
of humor, hashing out old gos-
sip that had died months ago.

I have to question the judg-
ment of any editor that would
let this appear on his or her
newspaper as much as I’d ques-
tion the “columnists” who came
up with it. A

I always considered The
Trident more of a tabloid or a
gossip magazine than a newspa-
per. That’s not to say they don’t
serve a necessary, purpose.

A lot of their articles are
especially entertaining and I
always pick one up to read the
latest “Lex in the City” or “Best

Week Ever.” Entertainment is
what The Trident does best, and
it’s sad to say a lot of people
probably found the “The Brack-
et” entertaining.

But at what cost? The public
humiliation of fellow students
in writing and on record that can
be used against them years from
now (maybe sooner than later,
like when they are applying for
jobs)?

The Raging Intelleetuals
usually seem bitter about some-
thing, but who knew they were
bitter enough to throw slime
around the school with no re-
gard for the consequences?

The article didn’t just cross
the line,'it completely ignored
the fact that the line exists. I
would never equate spreading
gossip to an honor violation,
but wasn’t it Robert E. Lee who
said the sole requirement was to
act “gentlemanly”? If that be the
case, then I know a couple of
guys the former General would

have loved to show the door to.

No, the writers should not be
kicked out or even punished by
the school for this. In the end,
unless someone sees this as
a case of libel, colunmists al-
ways have the right to write in
poor taste. We as a community,
though, have a right and an obli-
gation to call them out on it.

Everyone has to recognize
whoever could come up with
this Bracket is a jerk, and I’m
censoring myself from using a
more ﬁtting word.

If they want to add me as
a late entry to The Bracket or
ridicule me for criticizing them,
so be it. It’d be fun to see if the
people who hate on everybody
can handle a little criticism.

A lot has changed in this
school the past few years; a lot
of old traditions have died. But
decency is not something we
should ever let go of, not even
for a cheap laugh.

Harmful to all

Writers abuse First Amendment freedom

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

By now, many of you are prob-
ably tired of reading the denuncia-
tions of The Trident and the bracket
column written by Tim Livings-
ton and Myke Mulhem. But as a
newspaper editor who’s dealt with
controversial articles before, I

wanted to add my thoughts on the _

column, the president’s response
and student reaction.

College newspapers, of course,
are fundamentally different than

off-campus houses.

Past versions of the bracket
have highlighted some of the dou-
ble standards that are so common
at W&L, providing valuable and
necessary social commentary.

In this year’s version, however,
any useful commentary is lost in
a sea of mean, bitter and personal
attacks. Tim and Myke turned in
an appallingly unethical article.
As newspaper columnists, they
should remember that we have a
duty to avoid unnecessary harm.

“Normally, ‘I ’m an ardent defender of free

normal newspapers. We have the
opportunity to write about things
that would never appear in a regu-
lar paper. The Trident, with its
slate of columnists, offers some
hilarious — but often quite accurate
— social commentary about Wash-
ington and Lee.

Let’s be honest; we’re a school
with our share of problems. We’re
also a school that likes to sweep
those problems — unacceptably
high rape rates, hazing, alcohol
abuse, sexism and homophobia
~ under the rug.

Students would really prefer to
pretend that the idealistic academ-
ic setting, where everyone works
and studies. together, extends into

 

Writing a column that leaves
people insulted, upset and offend-
ed certainly fails to meet that stan-
dard. Writing about someone’s
sexual habits or sexuality doesn’t
do anything other than expose you
as a jerk.

This is not the ﬁrst year the
bracket has run. It’s been an an-
nual occurrence, and it has often
left people upset. .

But none of the previous brack-
ets have necessitated a letter from
the president or special meetings
hosted by the dean of freshmen.
None of the previous brackets
have caused people to threaten a
lawsuit against The Trident.

Again, it’s possible to provide

reditorial

readers with humor and social
commentary without insulting and
denigrating fellow students.

That column fails that standard.
Normally, I’m an ardent defender
of free speech, but I can’t see how
publishing those attacks served
any real purpose. This wasn’t
speech or even really satire; it was
an attack on 65 people.

The president has called on
Tim, Myke and editor Christina
Pratt to resign. I don’t think that’s
going to give everyone the answers
they want. If people in the bracket
want their grievances addressed,
there are a host of legal options
available to them. Use real judges
and juries, not the student-faculty
hearing board. A W&L-sponsored
trial is not going to give anyone a
fair shake.

This has been a difficult few
weeks for W&L. Sadly, this col-
umn is yet another situation where
nobody comes out looking good.
Nobody wins in this situation.

The people in the bracket have
been ridiculed in front of their
peers, not to mention the parents
that subscribe to this publication.

The other writers in the Trident
have seen all of their work — much
of it funny and highly relevant
— eclipsed by this one issue. And
the writers have shown that they
enjoy humiliating other people.
That’s the real problem here.
Good writers don’t humiliate and
needlessly embarrass people.

‘We’re supposed to be focused
on avoiding harm, but Tim and
Myke apparently set out to cause
harm rather than avoid it.

Where have all Lee’s
gentlemen gone?

Series taints tradition of honor; destroys
morals, values that deﬁne the university

Where have all the gentlemen
gone?

General Lee reputedly said
that “we have but one rule here,
and it is that every student must
be a gentleman.” This has stood
as the foundation on which ev-
erything else at_ this institution is
based.

The Honor of this school ex-
tends far past the classroom and
simple academic integrity; it be-
comes a part of who we are. There
is a culture present here at Wash-
ington and Lee that is absent in
most other institutions in the na-
tion.

And that is the unspoken
pledge by all members of W&L
community to treat each other
with respect and dignity.

Opening The Trident last
Thursday, it would be hard to
believe that we are in any way a
community or that there is any-
thing special about a W&L gradu-
ate.

The image of Lee’s gentle-
man was entirely thrown out the
window, and his legacy has been
trampled upon.

Last week represented the ﬁrst
round of the annual bracket to de-
termine who the worst person on
this campus is.

i The entire concept of holding
a “competition” to determine the
worst person in our small com-
munity is repulsive.

But this was far worse than
just that. This series of articles
has empowered a few very petty

people with a bully pulpit from
which to make fun of people they
simply do not like.

Let’s be honest. This is col-
lege. We all make mistakes and
do things that in retrospect, we
wish we never had done. This
is the last time in the rest of our
lives that we are free from major
responsibility.

But, there is absolutely no need
to humiliate your peers. Some of

The idea that something of
this nature would be printed in a
“newspaper” that at least operates
under the pretext of providing
news is ridiculous.

A list such as the one pub-
lished would have been much less
out-of-place being passed around
by middle school girls then in one
of the “newspapers” at one of the
finest schools in the country.

The students who wrote this

“The idea that somehow the series of ar-

ticles represented news or any form of an

educated opinion is ridiculous  Clearly,

there was no value to the article, and it had

1

no communal value. ’

the remarks may even have been
libelous.

The idea that somehow the se-
ries of articles represented news
or any form of an educated opin-
ion is ridiculous.

The students who wrote the ar-
ticle will surely shield themselves
from any fault by claiming free-
dom of the press.

J oumalists make choices about
what is news and what they are
free to print.

Clearly, there was no value to
the article, and it had no commu-
nal Value.

article represent everything that
W&L gentlemen should not do.
While they are the faces of this
debacle, they are not the only
ones guilty.

Every editor or writer that con-
tributed to it is just as responsible
and should be ashamed. .

The article may have been
tremendously ﬁinny, if you were
not in it. But it was mean. It was
two “men” picking on peers they
didn’t like.

They just did it under the guise
of news and with a larger audi-
ence.

THE RING-TUM PHI - 6

opinions

 

 

Last week’s bracket in The Trident caused lots
of readers to write in and share their thoughts

To the Phi:

This letter states my personal opinion and is not intended to represent anyone
else is views. I do not frequently read the student newspapers. However, I saw
"The Bracket" article in last week 3 Trident, and] was shaken by nausea and
-anger: The aforementioned article so egregiously and inappropriately demeaned
so many students that I feel compelled to write. While no member of the W&L
community deserves such nasty treatment, this was especially personal to me,
because many individuals who were demeaned are my former students, current
students, former‘ research group members, advisees, and younger siblings of
former advisees. I help teach Chem 111, and the principal joy of the course is
getting to know so many extraordinary young people, regardless of their science
proﬁciency. I have had so much support ﬂom so many former studentsfor so
long that my debt of gratitude simply cannot be repaid It would be criminal of
me not to return that loyalty and support now. Clearly, given the scope of the
article and the numerous friends and colleagues of the victims, every member of
the W&L community has been adversely impacted. That is simply, totally, and
completely unacceptable. Finally, to all of the students who were demeaned
(those I know and those I do not) and their friends and families, a heartfelt thank
you for contributing so much to our school and for helping make W&L such a
special place. Never forget’ that you are truly appreciated and valued.

Sincerely,
Di: Erich Uffelman

NOW ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR THE 2008 SUMMER AND FALL TERM

editor

To the editor.‘
As the campus authorities rise up together in outrage at The
Trident is “Bracket, ” I ’d like to remind everyone about the First
Amendment.

Ruscio suggested, in his broadcast e—mail, that The Trident
would hide behind the First as a shield, and said they don ’t
understand the freedom of the press.

I suggest the opposite ~ maybe none of the voices of outcry
understand the freedom of the press.

Here s how the freedom of the press works: anyone, not only
newspaper publishers, can say or print whatever they want.

T he forefathers were particular on this point, especially in the
criticism of governmental authority. Later, the freedom would be
expanded by the Supreme Court.

Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., in a dissenting opinion on a First
Amendment case, implied that the purpose of the amendment is
to create a marketplace of ideas, in which all ideas are present:
ed and then compete for truth.

It s Wikipedia, folks. If you read something that is not true, sign
in and ﬁx it.

If you read something you don ’t like, vote with your feet, or in
this case, your eyes. Censorship is never the answer — this isn’t
China. It is always The Trident is right to say whatever they
want. Its yours to decide whether what they print is okay.

To punish The Trident, discredit their ideas in the marketplace.
If you disagree with what they wrote, don ’t pick up another is-
sue. '
Tell Tim Livingston to his face you don ’t like what he wrote. Its
a little ridiculous that, on a campus this small, we're calling for
his head via broadcast mail. I heard some ﬁeshmen assembled
(in another use of the First Amendment) to demonstrate their
anger at The Trident. T hats certainly one way to go about it,
but some 20 kids aren ’t going to make a difference in the grand
scheme of our values. I

We, as a society of W&L students, need to decide together, col-
lectively, how we feel about “The Bracket. ” We need to decide
what our values are: is it okay for people to be terrible, and

not follow the “W&L values, " but not okay for someone else to
print it?

In 2003, the Dixie Chicks came forward and criticized President
Bush just before the invasion of Iraq. What followed is a beauti-
ful example of the people is control over the marketplace: people
decided they weren ’t interested in Natalie Maines ’opinion in
politics and asked their radio stations to stop playing Dixie
Chicks songs. Dixie Chicks concerts were poorly attended.
Their CDs didn ’t sell.

None of this was done through censorship. It was done through
the American people collectively deciding what they did and did
not want to hear.

T hats the American way to deal with the press. If you don ’t like
what The Trident dia', tell ‘em. Stop reading it. Write something
better.

The Chi Omega chili cook-off was a
spectacular success, raising over $12,000
for the Make a Wish Foundation, an orga-
nization that grants wishes to children with
life-threatening medical issues. Consider-
ing both the satisfaction of the students and
the amount of money raised, the chili cook-
off was a_ culinary and altruistic triumph.

The event was seemingly effortless.
However, the smooth and professional na-
ture of the cook-off was the result of weeks
of meticulous planning on the part of the
sorority. Melissa Caron, one of the event’s
planners, spoke about the efforts of Chi
Omega.

“We have a lot of different girls in our
sorority, and it was really a ﬁill-sorority ef-
fort. From decorating to invites, to adver-
tisement...all the girls contributed to the
success of the cook-off.”

Yet, the accomplishment of the affair
could not only be measured in epicurean
approval.

“The goal of it is to raise money for
the Make a Wish foundation,” Caron said.
“Hopefully we raise a lot of money for
them.” The donation was a collection of the
teams’ $50. entry fees, the price of admis-
sion and the money that went toward drinks
and activities such as the amusing cactus
throw game. -

In a competitive culinary spirit, several
teams paid the entrance fee and contributed
their take on the classic dish.

“We have 17 different teams participat-
ing, and I got a few e-mails last night saying
that a couple other organizations wanted to
enter. The enthusiasm of this community
has been incredible,” said Caron.

Indeed, several of W&L’s organizations
came out to support the event. The philan-
thropy chair of Chi Psi remarked, “It’s a
wonderful charity event for a great cause.
It’s a fun way to raise some money for a
very important charity. Chi 0 does a great
job with this every year and we got to be a
part of it.”

Indeed, the experience of the cook-off
enriched this small community in a variety
of ways. Hila Yashar, a member of Pi Beta
Phi, said, “It was a great bonding experi-
ence through a cooking extravaganza.” ‘Al-
though each organization was somewhat
partial to its own chili, they all consented
to try the dishes contributed by their com-
petitors. Evans Dining Hall was full of
mingling students, relaxing as they enjoyed
each others’ chili and listened to music.

Although the event was philanthrop-
ic, the chili was the main attraction. The

The Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse team
fought a tough game against the 11th ranked Shore-
men of Washington College but came up just short
as the Shoremen prevailed 12-11 in overtime. The
Generals were led by senior attackman Harry St.
John’s four-goal performance while Washington
College was led by Chris Read’s ﬁve goals and two

assists.

The Generals jumped out to a three goal lead in
the first quarter but saw their lead evaporate as the
the Shoremen responded by ending the half on a 4-
0 run to take a 6-5 lead at the break. The second
half was close throughout, with neither team gain-
ing more than a two goal advantage. The Generals
led 10-9 and 11-10 late in the game but Washington
College continued to rally. With just under three
minutes to play, Read scored an unassisted goal to
tie the game at l 1. Neither team was able to score in
the extra period until Washington College senior at-
tackman Kolyn Kirby found the back of the net with
under a minute to play to win the game.

their ranking. The Generals ﬁnally
got on the board when Kelsi Robin-
son scored with 10:19 left, assisted
by Emily Matthews. The Diplo-
mats then added another score to
make the game 6-1 going into the
half. After the break, the Generals
came out strong. They scored the
ﬁrst three goals of the half. This
cut the margin to 6-4. However, the
Diplomats scored with 7:29 to play

The golf team spent Monday
and Tuesday away from campus;
instead, the team was in Pine
Mountain, Georgia, at Callaway

giate Invitational. Out of a total
of sixteen teams, the Generals
ﬁnished tied for seventh.

The team was led by Senior
Nathaniel James who shot 76’s
both days for a grand total of
152.

‘‘I managed to control the

damage on what could have
been two pretty bad rounds,”
commented James on his perfor-
mance. “I know what I need to
work on and felt like I’ll be ready
to compete at full speed at our
next event.” _

Senior Steven Spivey shot a
79 the ﬁrst day but came back
the next day four strokes better
with a 75 for a two-day total of
154. Sophomores Matt Langan

and Joe Gibson shot a 155 (80 on
the ﬁrst day, 75 on the second),
and 161 (83 the ﬁrst day, 78 on

remarked James. “I look forward

Overall, the team can be very
happy with their performance in
southern Georgia. '

“We were up against some
really good competition,” said
James. “I think ﬁve of the top ten
teams in the nation were there,
as well as plenty more in the
top twenty ﬁve.” He continued,
“Our seventh place ﬁnish didn’t
hurt us any for the rest of the sea-

Team 3-] in ODAC after winning sixteen—inning game

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The men’s baseball team
won an epic 6-5 battle in 16
innings Sunday afternoon to
defeat Virginia Wesleyan, the
team picked to ﬁnish ﬁrst in the
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence this season. The Marlins
stonned back to win game two
of the doubleheader 11-1. That
game was called after eight in-
nings due to darkness.

The extra innings of game

one were ﬁlled with back and _

forth action before sophomore
First Baseman Hunter Seren-
betz drove home senior Right
Fielder James Madden with a
single to provide the winning
run. Serenbetz ﬁnished game
one 4-7 and was also hit by a
pitch.

Sophomore Jim Plantholt
nailed down the victory by get-
ting three outs in the bottom of
the 16th. Senior John Parker
ﬁnished the twelfth inning and
pitched innings 13, 14 and 15
to earn the win.

The split means that the
Generals have won nine of
their last ten games as they
came into the weekend with an
eight-game winning streak.

“We’ve won eight in a row
just by playing hard and ex-_
pecting to win every time we
step on the ﬁeld,” said captain
Steve Marcott before the week-
end’s games. “If we keep that
attitude this team has a chance
to do some things this year.

After defeating Southern
Vermont College by a combined

score of 28-2 in a double-head-
er last Sunday, the Generals
stepped back, into conference
play on Wednesday against the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers. In
the past three years, the Blue
and White are 1-7 against the
Tigers, but this year’s baseball
team returns a strong nucleus
of players and boasted a 9-2 re-
cord heading into the game.
Hampden-Sydney jumped
out to a fast start right from the
gate, scoring in the top of the
ﬁrst. The Tigers’ lcadoff hitter,
Alnor Rodriguez, reached ﬁrst

vancing the score to 3-1.

In the third consecutive in-
ning, the Generals notched an-
other run. This time though, Ju-
nior Byron Peyster hit a shot to
left ﬁeld that cleared the fence
for a home run. The long ball
was Peyster’s ﬁrst on the year
and also the ﬁrst homer of his
three-year career. While W&L
continued to build a lead, the
Tigers went cold, failing to
score another run until the ﬁfth
inning when they cut the lead
to 4-2 in favor of the Blue and
White.

base on an error and eventually
came around to score. The Gen-
erals responded in the bottom
half of the inning on a double
by sophomore Will Lewis that
drove in two runners and gave
the team a 2-1 lead.

W&L added to that lead in
the second inning on another
RBI by Lewis. Sophomore John
Ditore led off the inning with a
single and scored the run, ad-

Hampden-Sydney narrowed
the lead to one in the top of
the sixth inning when Brendan
Clark loaded the bases with no-
body out, but the Tigers failed
to really capitalize, stranding
three runners on base as the
Generals got two outs at the
plate.

The Generals answered in
the second half of the frame on
back-to—back doubles by Lewis

and sophomore Hunter Seren-
betz to stretch the lead to 5-3.

The Tigers countered with
another run in the seventh,
but the surge was thwarted
by W&L, scoring two runs in
the eighth and shutting down
Hampden-Sydney the rest of
the way. The ﬁnal score was
7-4.

Lewis was 4-5 on the day
with four RBIs in the effort. He
was complemented by fellow
sophomores Ditore and Seren-
betz, who combined for six
hits and an RBI. Marcott won
his ﬁrst game of the year as the
starting pitcher, allowing only
one earned run in ﬁve innings.
The team is now ll-3 overall
and 4-1 in conference.

Serenbetz, Peyster and Di-
tore are part of a Generals in-
ﬁeld that graduated three start-
ers from last year’s team and
lost returning ﬁrst baseman
Andrew Henderson to a knee
injury during the opening road
trip to Georgia.

Peyster has especially big
shoes to ﬁll as he replaces sec-
ond baseman David Miller, who
during his career established
himself as one of the program’s
all-time leaders in hits and on-
base percentage.

Marcott said after the game
that the team wants to bring
home an ODAC title.

“The team’s goals this year
are the same as they are every
year: Get to the ODAC touma-
ment and win it,” said Marcott.

Organizations work to eradicate racist, homophobic language

 

By Allison chopln and Wes
0’Dell

ASSISTANT NEWS EDITOR AND STAFF
WRITER

A law school student organization
is asking the university to ban ‘hate
speech.’

The group, Outlaw, works to pro-
mote awareness and acceptance of
Gay-Lesbian-Bigendered-Transsexu-
al (GLBT) individuals.

Executive Chair John Martin re-
cently went before the Student Af-
fairs Committee>(SAC), an organiza-
tion of students, administrators and
faculty, to lay out his plan.

Said Martin in a prepared state-
ment: “Basically, I have asked SAC
to create a policy that would prohibit
a narrow class of extremely degrad-
ing and dangerous verbal conduct at
the University.”

Martin calls these terms “hate
speech,” and his proposal would ban
“the use of slurs, epithets, and clearly
derogatory and degrading language”
that can be considered harassment on
the basis of race, religion, gender, or
sexual orientation.

His proposal as it stands would

include a ban on using “the n-word
for African-Americans or the c-word
in reference to women, among other
things,” he said, calling this only “a
working deﬁnition.”

Martin added that he and the SAC
will likely “tighten up” the deﬁnition
to specify what exactly qualiﬁes as
hate speech.

sual” use of homophobic and racial
slurs on campus.

“[The common use of slurs] has
created an environment at W&L
where in the past harassment and
even violence have taken place,” said
Martin.

According to Martin, “an envi-
ronment pervaded by hate speech”

“People don ’t understand the connotations of [ cer-

tain ‘hate speech ’] words...we live in a very conser-

vative and homophobic campus. ’

THERESA DOUGHERTY, Gay-Stralght Alllance Treasurer

“The ﬁnal policy will probably
implicitly take context into account
as well,” he said.

Martin characterizes his proposal
as a way to “close the gap” in W&L’s
harassment policy by “prohibiting
hate speech even if it is not directed
at a particular individual.”

The genesis for the plan was what
Martin describes as the “almost ca-

1

has cultivated a mindset that sees no
problem with this type of derogatory
language.

He would like to show “in a very
public way” that this behavior is not
acceptable.

While Martin’s has only had in-
formal discussions with Outlaw’s
undergraduate counterpart, the Gay-
Straight Alliance, the GSA promises

to support the policy should SAC
adopt it.

“People don’t understand the con-
notations of [certain ‘hate speech’]
words,” said GSA Treasurer Theresa
Dougherty. “We live in a very conser-
vative and homophobic campus.”

Martin agrees: “There may be
some students who oppose the policy
because they often use hate speech...
The policy aims to end this kind of
behavior, and these students will have
to face the reality that hate speech is
not acceptable here.”

While he concedes student reac-
tion is hard to predict, Martin is con-
ﬁdent his plan will garner the support
of the campus.

He also warns against inaction,
stating that the refusal to create such a
policy “could set the stage for a slow
erosion of existing policies that could
set the ‘University back ten years in
terms of public image, recruiting, and
campus climate.”

Martin predicts that nothing will
change unless a rule is enacted. Sim-
ply educating students with the tra-
ditions of honor and civility has not
been effective.

“We must address this issue

through policy because students are
not ending this behavior on their own,
and education is valuable but has be-
gun to reach the limits of its audience
and its efﬁcacy,” he said.

Dougherty, however, believes that
the students themselves are capable
of making a difference, with or with-
out a policy in place.

While SAC ’s deliberations contin-
ue, she encourages students to make
hate speech socially unacceptable.

“You can discourage your friends
from using homophobic speech. If
someone makes a joke about some-
one else being a ‘fag’ or something
being ‘gay’...the association is that
‘gay’ is bad. That’s something we’re
working to eliminate,” she said.

Dougherty also encourages stu-
dent to participate in GSA’s upcom-
ing “Gay? Fine by me” campaign.
The GSA will be handing out free t-
shirts bearing the slogan in late April
to promote tolerance on campus.

Said Dougherty: “That’s kind of
putting yourself out there as a sup-
porter of the GLBT community—and
showing that ‘gay’ is not a derogatory
word.”

teresting web strategies” will be vital
for the success of modern news pro-
grams.

Because of the convergence of print
and broadcast media with the Internet,
websites often incorporate writing, au-
dio, and video segments, and the role
of the journalist has become much
more complex.

Duffy suggested that above all, it
is important for journalists to “think

news industry.

_Duffy began his lecture by address-
ing the “changes that have been wreak-
ing havoc in newsrooms.”

While denying the widespread be-
lief that today’s younger generation
“just does not read,” Duffy explained
that the age group “is reading in dif-
ferent ways.”

The Internet, which has had a tre-
mendous impact on the process of
mass communication, is forcing ma-

- jor news programs to re-examine their
strategies ‘for producing high quality
material that is also engaging.

Duffy reassured the audience in
saying, “We shouldn’t despair. There presents many p0sSjbj[j[jes_ ”
is an interest; we just need to be more
creative.”

Although admitting that “[the in-
dustry] does not know what is going
to happen next,” Duffy emphasized
his belief that the fate of the news will story require,” and then “tell the story

pletely electronic in ﬁve years” as an ardson, head of the journalism de-
exaggeration, Duffy asserted that “in— partment, the rise of the Internet has

had a profound effect on the process
of journalism education. He shared
that Washington and. Lee developed a
“fully multimedia” program ten years
ago in order to meet the demands of
the changing ﬁeld.

Richardson emphasized the inﬂu-
ence that the Intemet has on the cur-
rent state of the news. “A fair number
of [W&L] grads are headed to news
programs with websites,” he said.

journalism students will work in the
future.

However, Duffy expressed mixed
feelings about the lntemet, calling it
“the social media genie [that] is out of
the bottle.”

'He ultimately suggested that, if
properly monitored, the web could
become the dominant source for news
information that is both accurate and
entertaining. He lamented that most of
the content found on the lntemet is in-
ferior and unreliable when compared
to that of a “good newspaper.” He said
that the public, however, is willing to
sacriﬁce quality in favor of a free, fast,
and interactive media experience.

Although Duffy stated that there
are no good examples of news orga-
nizations that are currently “getting it
right,” he did express optimism. “All
the industries are trying to go to the
same place,” he said.

According to Duffy, while the fu-
ture of news is uncertain, creative ex-
perimentation and dedication to the re-
sponsibilities of journalism will yield
the best results.

. While journalists around the coun-
try are despairing over the future of
journalism,’ National Public Radio
Managing Editor Brian Duffy isn’t
buying into the doom and gloom. _

If Duffy is correct, the comments
will surely come as a relief to the stu-
dent journalists who spend each spring
fretting over whether they’ll be able to
ﬁnd a job after graduation.

tute of Ethics in Journalism on Friday.

He spoke to students, professors,
and media professionals about “Divin—
ing a Brighter Future for News.”

Duffy, who took over at NPR in
October, spent nearly 20 years at U.S.
News and World Report. He was the
magazine’s editor from 2000 until
October. He has also worked at the
Washington Post and Wall Street Jour-
nal as investigations editor.

Following a humorous introduc-
tion from Professor Edward Wasser-

Don’t force apology

Forgive the “Bracket” writers but don ’z‘ forget

To the university community,

I write in response to “The Bracket,” a
recent column in the Distractions section of
The Trident, and the community’s response
to it.

First, I applaud the response, by senior
administrators to the column. While they
justly excoriated the authors and their edi-
tor, they do not call for external control or
sanction of The Trident. In refraining from
doing so, they recognize the necessity for a
free, vigorous and unfettered press in any
community, even when its practitioners in-
dulge in wretched excess and pointlessly
hurtful behavior.

If ever there were an occasion for senior_
administrators to be tempted to exert exter-
nal control over student media, it would be
in the face of a column that, at the least,
ﬂirts with the legal torts of libel, invasion
of privacy and intentional inﬁiction of emo-
tional distress. That our president, provost
and deans have responded by appealing to
conscience rather than control is laudable.

Second, while a free press and free ex-
pression are the cornerstones of democracy
both nationally and on an intensely local
level, whether what happened is either le-
gally defensible by those who wrote and
edited, or legally actionable by those they
harmed, are both beside the point. There is
a difference, recognized by practically all
working journalists, between what we can
do and what we ought to do. That is a ﬁrst

principle of our teaching in the Department
of Journalism and Mass Communications;
like others in this community, we live in
hope that Washington and Lee’s indepen-
dent student media will honor it.

From the First Amendment arises a pro-
fessional obligation for journalists to moni-
tor our institutions of power, to provide a
forum for those who speak truth to power
and to provide the truthful information that
is the lifeblood of democratic self-deterrni-
nation.

In doing so, journalists frequently cause
harm to those they monitor. In the service of
their audiences, journalists employ a calcu-
lus that measures the harm they do against
the necessary information they provide. In
their obligation to those about whom they
write, they attempt to determine how vital

‘information can be published and harm

minimized. Such reasoning presupposes
the freedom to exercise judgment as moral
actors rather than constraint by powerful
external forces.

As journalists we are not in the business
of defending the indefensible. It is easy to
defend the sanctity of free expression; it is
impossible to defend The Trident column.

By any measure of public necessity, it
fails. By the calculus of harm versus bene-
ﬁt, it fails. By the moral obligation to mini-
mize damage, it fails. As careful reporting,
it fails. As satire, it fails. (That its few de-
fenders have variously tried to argue that it
is both factual reporting and satire negates

either claim.)

It clearly is not journalism. But, un-
fortunately, to say that such work sprang
parentless from some fertile sophomoric
imagination is inaccurate. Our airwaves
and the intemet are full of so-called pro-
fessionals indulging in politically polar-
ized food ﬁghts passed off as journalism;
sadly, the authors of The Trident piece can
readily ﬁnd a kind of role model among
those grown-up practitioners. That does
not excuse their behavior; they should have
known better than to emulate such dreck.

Finally, I offer an observation on the
heart and soul of this wonderful but bruised
community. In response to the column,
many have cited President Lee’s values of
civility and honor, and wonder where in this
incident those values can be recognized.

I submit that honor lies in our belief as
a community that those who caused the
hurt should be trusted now to do the right
thing, rather than be forced to. I submit that
civility lies in our embracing the value of
redemption.

I believe President Lee would agree;
he was allowed to set our course as a com-
munity only because those who sat in judg-
ment of him believed that redemption was
appropriate.

Sincerely,
Brian Richardson, Department Head
Journalism and Mass Communications

To the Washington and Lee
community,

We would like to support
the recent statement made by
the Student Executive Com-
mittee regarding the adjudica-
tion of sexual assault on the
Washington and Lee campus.

We are encouraged that
this statement indicates sig-
niﬁcant progress on the issue
of sexual assault and that it re-
iterates there is zero tolerance
for perpetrators of sexual vio-
lence within our community
of honor and trust,

We hope that the student
body knows the range of re-
sources available on our cam-
pus for victims of sexual as-
sault.

Numerous women and men
have been sexually assaulted
over the past few years, but no
survivors have brought cases
to the EC or SFHB (Student-
Faculty Hearing Board) for
adjudication.

Students who wish to move
forward to a formal proceed-
ing should know that both the
EC and SFHB have jurisdic-
tion over sexual assault cases,
and both bodies hold the pow-
er to dismiss a student found
guilty of committing sexual

Speak, fight rape

assault.

The decision to go to a for-
mal proceeding is an incredi-
bly diﬂicult one, and there are
other ways to achieve infor-
mal resolution (i.e., speaking
with a CAIR).

It is our sincere wish that
we continue to move forward
and grow into a community
where women and men do not
feel silenced on speaking out
about sexual assault.

The values of honor and
civility that our community
holds dear should apply to all
arenas of life as a student at
W&L: all students within this
community of trust deserve
to feel as if they can speak
out against a sexual assault
without risk of social conse-
quences.

May this step encourage
discussion and awareness in
our community so that one
day there is an end to sexual
assault at W&L.

Please email us with any
questions or concerns (lar-
sonw@wlu.edu and hughes1@

. Beware the company

People assume your friends (or political advisors) represent your feelings, ideas

By Grace Andrews
STAFF WRITER

For those of you who do not
know, it was recently revealed
that Sen. Barack Obama’s preach-
er, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, gave a
questionable sermon the Sun-
day after Sept. 11 that suggested
Americas had brought terrorist
attacks upon themselves by act-
ing as terrorists in other nations
and supporting injustice (i.e. Hi-
roshima and apartheid South Af-
rica.)

Wright has also given other
sermons in which he has con-
demned the U.S. for treating
minorities as second-class citi-
zens. More recently, he compared
Obama to Jesus and criticized
Sen. Hillary Clinton.

As a result of the public out-
cry concerning these teachings,
Obama has openly criticized
Wright’s statements and removed
him from his presidential cam-
paign.

Despite the fact that Wright is
no longer a part of Obama’s cam-
paign, Obama states that Wright

remains a close family friend
whose opinions aren’t represen-
tative of how he [Obama] feels.
He stressed Wright’s champion-
ing against homophobia and sex-
ism in the black community and
focus on community service.

Sadly, this same situation has
occurred before. Geraldine Fer-
raro, a speaker at this year’s Mock
Con, was criticized for making a
statement that said Obama would
not be ahead in the race for the
White House if he were not
black. As a result, she stepped
down and is no longer an aide to
Clinton because of a fear that she
would bring bad publicity to the
campaign trail.

The fact the Ferraro herself
was a trailblazer and advocate
for minorities in politics has been
quickly forgotten and replaced
with a new “racist” image, re-
gardless of her attempts to dispel
such ideas. Ferraro’s dismissal
was requested by many in the
party and came after Obama ex-
pelled unpaid foreign policy ad-
visor Samantha Power after she
was quoted by Scotland’s nation-

editorial
University cannot force-feed tolerance

Students should engage in dialogue to change campus values on hate speech

John Martin, president of the
Washington and Lee Law School
group, Outlaw, wants the Student
Affairs Committee to ban what he
calls hate speech.

The proposed.ban would make
it illegal for students to use racial
or sexist slurs.

The words are certainly offen-
sive in the extreme. No student
should ever be on the receiving
end of such hateful language.

The words are also protected
under the First Amendment.

W&L, as a private university,
is not obligated to extend free
speech rights to students, but if
the university wishes to be taken
seriously in the academic world,
this proposed ban will never be-
come law on our campus.

Martin should remember
that the Supreme Court has long
frowned upon laws that restrict
unpleasant or unpopular speech
and actions. In National Socialist

. Party of America v. Skokie (1 9 7 8),

the court ruled that a small Illinois
village could not ban the Ameri-

can Nazi Party from holding a
march through the town.

Texas v. Johnson (1989) said
that flag burning, an act most of
us find repugnant, is a protected
form of speech.

Unfortunately for Martin, ra-
cial and ethnic slurs ~ unless they
directly incite violent action — are
also protected speech.

al newspaper, calling Clinton “a
monster”.

To be quite fair, I’m almost
sure that every single one of the
statements I’ve discussed has to
be heard in its proper context to
accurately understand what the
speaker was trying to say.

While that is not a luxury af-
forded to those who play the

the candidates at all, it’s impor-
tant to see the roles that friends,
advisors and aides can play. Now,
the question is, “Do they truly
represent the ideas and feelings
of the presidential candidates?”
Let’s put it into practice here
at W&L. How many of us have
that friend who is always saying
the wrong things to anything and

ford each other in our daily lives?

The proposal ignores a valuable lesson: you

can ’t dictate morality to college students.

That 3 why curfews, single—sex dorms and

other old-fashioned traditions have died out.

 

Again, W&L does not have to
grant students full First Amend-
ment protection. But the univer-
sity should realize that an outright
prohibition, even on obscene and
offensive words, will not create
the change in attitude that Martin

can be offended? Do these indi-

Let me take you back a few
years. Imagine a Baby Grace, just

Few students are willing to con-
front a peer and say that some-
thing is offensive.

W&L likes to portray itself
as a school that’s in the business
of developing well-rounded stu-
dents, people who do well in the
classroom but also embody vir-
tues like tolerance, honesty and
courtesy.

That’s a ﬁne goal, but the uni-
versity should realize that those

values cannot be force-fed to.

students. The values can only
emerge if the entire community
stands behind them.

Martin’s right. We do have a
culture of homophobia and intol-
erance on this campus. We salute
his efforts to change that culture.

We cannot, however, support a
regulation that will stiﬂe student
speech, no matter how offensive
the speech.

Change will come through
honest and open discourse, not
another restriction that the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee sends

you keep

delightfully small grade school
desks that elementary schools
have. Now, imagine some other
Baby (insert the name of grade
school here) talking to Baby
Grace (BG), instead of doing his/
her work. A

All of a sudden, the teacher
asks Baby Grace to go to time-out
for talking. The only problem is
that BG wasn’t talking, only sit-
ting close to ‘O1 Baby Big Mouth
(BBM) and slightly listening.

Is it really fair for BG to get
punished for what BBM did?
I think not. Maybe BG should
have told BBM to shut the heck
up before she pushed him off of
the monkey bars during recess.

To be quite honest, I have a
few friends that I may need to
“dismiss” from the campaign
known as my life or even ﬁre them
as social advisors and keep them
as personal advisors. Doesn’t that
sound a bit laughable?

Honestly, I’m not quite sure
what my stance on the issue is,
but I think that we may want to
scrutinize our own lives as closely

as we do the lives of the presiden-
tial candidates. If it’s unaccept-
able for them to have individuals
around them making question-
able comments, then maybe the
same should apply to us.

I completely recognize that
politicians operate in a bigger
forum and have a greater range
of inﬂuence, but are such double
standards fair?

We’re all humans and make
mistakes, but maybe the saying
“birds of a feather ﬂock together”
is true, and, then again, maybe it
should be “birds of different and
similar feathers sometimes ﬂock
together but aren’t actually rep-
resentative of individual birds in
the ﬂock or even the ﬂock as a
collective unit.”

So maybe that would be too
long to actually become a saying,
but I implore all of my readers to
ponder the questions that I have
raised.

Maybe the old adage of “be-
ware the company you keep” is
still applicable in today’s world;
then again, maybe it needs a
modern interpretation.

 Umpires are heroes amidst corruption

Though negativity pervades sports and politics, baseball referees provide glimmer of hope for disadvantaged children

By Adam Lewis
c 0 L u M N I s T
As good as the Daytona 500
and the Kentucky Derby are, they
don’t come close to matching the
race that has taken over American
news in the past several months:
T “Sports ﬁgures vs. Politicians:

. §Who can cheat more?” Recently,

ithese two American realms have
{boasted the most corrupt people
; since Enron’s last board meet-
f ing. Between Roger Clemens,

I’m going to be honest, we cut
 it extremely close to ‘press time

paragraphs I hope to give you a
: brief glimpse of what to expect in

* that year-in and year-out proves

V itself as one of the most captivat-

. the pure passion, raw excitement,

_ tion that are annually exhibited

iot Spitzer sex scandal’ technique
coming around the turn, but sports
is right on its tail, just waiting for
the ﬁnal-stretch push of a future
Congress investigation. It could
be a photo-ﬁnish!”

Anyway, what I’m driving at
is that sports and politics (particu-
larly sports, being that this is a
sports article) have been poisoned
with negative media to the point
where the “good” stories, when
they exist, are overshadowed by
the aforementioned corruption-
centered ones. It is for this reason
that I am taking the opportunity
to acknowledge the efforts of a
group of people who make a liv-
ing by arbitrating cheating, and
who have painted the concept of

reason. Each team won its confer-
ence tournament and possesses
the talent and depth to make a
legitimate run for the National
Championship. Taking a look
at the bracket, East No. 1 UNC
shouldn’t have trouble until at
least the Elite Eight with either
Louisville or Tennessee, but ei-
ther -way the Heels should have
more than enough ﬁrepower
to win. In the South, Memphis
should quickly run through
teams, including a weaker than
normal, but always Izzo-prepared
Michigan State squad. Texas, in
a “neutral” location of Houston,
poses a big threat, but Memphis
has beaten big time opponents be-
fore. Ben Howland’s UCLA team
looks prime for a third consecu-
tive Final Four coming from the
West bracket, and I’m not so sure
Duke, Xavier, Drake, or any other
team can match the Bruins on
both ends of the ﬂoor. Big 12 win-

purity with a “BLUE” stroke.

Last Wednesday, “BLUE for
Kids,” a charity organization
founded by Major League Base-
ball umpires, hosted the 2008
World Series of Bowling in Tam-
pa, Fla. This event featured vari-
ous celebrities, umpires and other
baseball people as bowlers, in an
effort to provide 1,000 at-risk or
seriously ill children with a once-
in—a-lifetime baseball experience,
in which they would have the
opportunity to attend a baseball
game, meet players, take pictures
and receive autographs.

In general, BLUE, which
stands for “Big League Umpir-
ing Experience,” operates as an
experience-based charity orga-
nization, much like a “Make-A-

During the season, participating
umpires host groups of typically
ill, underprivileged or orphaned
children for a behind-the-scenes
look at the job of an umpire (ob-
viously neglecting the occasional
spit or profane action). And for
kids who may be unable to enjoy
a game ﬁrst-hand, these umpires
travel to nearby hospitals visiting
children, often providing them
with specially-made gifts. Over-
all, BLUE combines the help of.
numerous umpires and baseball-
afﬁliated people to enhance the
lives of kids in need, if just for
one day, through baseball.

when athletes are making more
money than ever, it is the umpires
who step into the forefront to sup-

And in an age when athletes are

C, notches ﬁrst non-conference win
By Michael Keenan * g

The Washington and Lee men’s tennis team had its best
week of the season, maintaining its undefeated record in the
ODAC by defeating Lynchburg College on Wednesday and
recording its ﬁrst non-conference victory over Denison Uni-
versity on Friday before seeing its four-match winning streal‘
snapped on Saturday by 8th-ranked Mary Washington Univer-

On Wednesday, the Generals cruised past the Hornets 9-0.
After the duos of seniors Tim Ross and Stuart Sanford, seniors
Nat Estes and Seth Feibelman and senior Nelson Bunn and
sophomore Alex Brooke swept the doubles portion, the under-
classmen got their chance during the singles competition.

Freshman Morgan Hopson won the No. 1 singles match
without dropping a game to Kristian Richardson. Sophomore
Brent Meyers only dropped two games en route to his two-set
victory over Daniel Civis. Junior Jamie McCardell won No. 3
singles by default. Sophomore Cliff Gaddy and freshmen Tim
Watson and Will Hall rounded out the sweep for the Generals.

On Friday, the Generals knocked off Denison 6-2. The
Generals took a commanding 3-0 lead after sweeping the dou-
bles competition. Ross and McCardell teamed up to win No.
doubles 6-2, Feibelman and Estes took No. 2 doubles 8-3 and
Brooke and Sanford completed the sweep winning 8-5.

In the singles competition, Ross won convincingly in No. 1
singles, defeating Jordan Buehler 6-1, 6-4. The other matches
were much closer. Estes and Sanford both lost in third, set tie-
breakers which allowed Denison to get on the board. How-
ever, Fiebelman and McCardell won third and fourth singles
by scores of 6-4, 6-4 and 6-4, 7-6, to secure the 6-2 victory.

Saturday was a different story. The Eagles of Mary Wash-
ington came in ranked 8“‘ in the country and lived up to their
rating. The Eagles took two of three in the doubles competi-
tion and ﬁve of six in the singles competition. The Generals
didn’t go down without a ﬁght, though. The duo of F eibelman
and Estes won second doubles, defeating Evan Goff and Bryc‘
Parrish 8-4 and Meyers recorded the only singles victory by
defeating Kaz Murata 6-3, 6-2. Three of the singles match-
es went to a third set and the other two were decided by two
games or less in each set.

The Generals return to action Tuesday when they travel to-

Randolph College to take on the Wildcats at 4 p.m.

Women crush No. 9 Denison,

sweep ODAC opponents

By Michael Keenan
sponrs EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s tennis team im-

proved to 8-0 this week with victories over ODAC oppo-
nents Hollins University and Lynchburg College as well
as 9th-ranked Denison University, its ﬁrst non-conference
foe of the spring season.

The Generals posted two victories on Wednesday, de-
feating Hollins, who is currently tied for 2nd in the ODAC
and Lynchburg. Neither team posed much of a threat as
the Generals swept both matches 9-0.

Four seniors — Kelly Will, Leah Weston, Rebecca Tim-
mis and Katie Duncan — and two juniors — Katie Tabb and
Meg Spalitta — traveled to Roanoke to down Hollins. All
won in straight sets, with four winning 6-0, 6-0.

Back in Lexington, seniors Rhodes Proctor and Lau-
ren Cook, sophomore Lyndsey Johansson, and freshmen
Virginia Dickinson, Catherine Reed, Crystal Spencer and
Lauren Dorsey blanked the Hornets for the team’s second
win of the day. The Generals surrendered only two games
in the nine matches.

On Friday, the Generals faced a top 10 team for the ﬁrst
time this spring when they took on Denison. The Generals
were more than up to the challenge, sweeping the doubles
competition and then taking ﬁve of six in the singles com-
petition.

In doubles play, the No. 1 and No. 2 matches were very
close. Tabb teamed with sophomore Lauren Caire to defeat
Denison’s top duo of Marta Drane and Kristin Cobb, 8-6.
Weston and Reed played extra to defeat Meghan Damico
and Kendra Murray in a tiebreak, 9-8.

In No. 3 doubles, Will and Dickinson cruised to an 8-
2 win over Erin Gorsich and Kristina Beilinson. On the
singles side, Tabb won the ﬁrst set convincingly before
dropping the second set 6-1 but came back to take the
third set 6-4, winning the match. Tabb’s win was followed
by straight set wins from Will, Caire, Weston and Spalitta,

leading to the General’s 8-1 win.

The women return to action Wednesday when they take
on Mary Washington University at home and then travel
to Randolph College to take on the Wildcats.

Men stomp Hood but drops second game to ranked opponent in overtime

By Russ Weems
STAFF wnmzn

Another week, another heartbreaker for
the men’s lacrosse team.

The team travelled to Hood College
Monday and took on Franklin and Mar-
shall on Saturday at a neutral site.

On Monday, the Generals blew out
Hood College. The game was overwhelm-
ing one siding from start to ﬁnish, with the
Generals dominating nearly every facet of
the game. The Generals got out to a quick
5-0 lead in the ﬁrst quarter, never relin-
quished and ended up with a 15-1 victory.
The Generals nearly completed a shutout.
Hood didn’t get on the scoreboard until
there was 41 seconds remaining in the
contest. 10 W&L players scored and three
had multiple goals. »

The Generals dominance was lead by a
balanced attack. Will Englehart and Ned
Rider paced the team with 3 goals. Seth

Fishman recorded two. Harry St. John,
Drew Koeneman, Kevin Feeney, Deets
Hoffman, Justin Donati, Mark Wachtmeis-
ter, and Tyler Lenczuk also found the back
of the net for the Generals. Four Gener-
als had multiple assists. Connor Locke
played the ﬁrst three quarters in goal in
the victory, saving 10 shots and allowing 0
goals. The ﬁnal period was split between
Jason Lumpkin and Ned Lundvall.‘

The Generals faced the Diplomats on
Franklin and Marshall Saturday in what
turned out to be a thrilling game. The Gen-
erals started the game strong, opening up a
2-0 lead by ﬁrst quarter goals by Will Kei-
gler and Kevin Feeney. F&M responded
strongly, scored 4 of the ﬁve goals in the
second and third quarters, giving them a
4-3 lead going into the ﬁnal period. The

fourth quarter was hotly contested and‘

exciting, featuring four ties and one lead
change. Neither team led by more than
one goal. For the ﬁrst part of the quar-

ter, the two teams traded goals, leaving the
score at 6-5 with 7:30 to play. W&L then
had a big stretch, outscoring the Diplomats
2-0 in the next four minutes, leaving The
Generals with a one goal advantage with
3:16 remaining in the fourth. Diplomats’
attackman Mark Hild responded with a
goal with 2:31 to play, sending the game
to overtime. At the end of the ﬁrst over-_ _
time, Hild scored again leaving the Gener-
als with a tough 8-7 loss.

The Generals were led by some strong
individual performances in the loss. Ned
Rider and Will Englehart both recorded
two goals. Tim Skeen and Will Keigler
each had one goal and one assist, while_
Harry St. John added two assists. Con-
nor Locke played the duration in goal for
W&L, stopping nine shots.

W&L returns to action on Wednesday
when they take on the College of Wooster
at 7:00 p.m. at St. Anne’s-Belﬁeld in Char-
lottesville, Va.

Administration :9 master plan

ﬁnally complete; incoming class
ready to kill fun at W&L

By Hadley Burgoyne
surr wnnrn

They may be prone to bouts
of excessive drinking and pos-
sible drug use while visiting, but
the Washington and Lee Class of
2012 is already making a name
for itself.

The entering class announced
on its Facebook group yesterday
that it had successfully created a
cure for most common cancers.

The project is expected to gen-
erate enormous revenue, and the
entering class says it plans to use
the money to buy Davidson Park
and Red Square away from the
school and the fratemities.

“We think that the Greek sys-
tem is outdated,” one member
of the incoming class said. “We
would instead like to make Red
Square a sober activity center
where everyone goes home by
midnight, so they can get plenty
of rest for class the next day.”

Plans for Davidson Park are
still a bit shaky, but the class will
probably demolish the fraternity
houses and build a scientiﬁc re-
search center where the houses

once stood.

“I mean, what’s the point of
Davidson Park anymore?” the
student asked. You’ve already
got the Kappa Sig house empty,
and SAE is going to be empty
next year. Building a center for
global warming research and let-
ting Al Gore move in to Lexing-
ton just makes more sense. Come
on, we all know that the most im-
portant thing here is making lots
of money and giving the school
another excuse to raise tuition
prices again.”

Dean of Admissions William
Hartog said he was proud of the
accomplishments of the incoming
class.

“As you know, Washington
and Lee received a record num-
ber of applications, and this is the
most competitive class yet. So
what I’m basically trying to say
is that all the people we’ve let in
before are stupid idiots who drink
too much and can’t hold a candle
to the new class.”

When asked for his reaction to
Hartog’s comments, history pro-
fessor H.P. Porter, Jr. just shook
his head and walked away with-

This once beautiful fraternity house will be destroyed to make way for a sober activiy location sponsored
by the Class of 2012.

out saying anything. His actions
spoke far louder than words.
Greek residents of Davidson
Park refused to comment about
the hostile takeover, but several
fraternities were being surround-

tory. There was speculation,
however, that the fraternity was
already trying to end that streak
last month when it hosted a tequi-
la party for the 17- and 18-year-
old Johnson Scholars who were

ed by sandbags, signaling that
the Class of 2012 may be resisted
by force. All members contacted
said they wanted to talk but would
be kicked out of their fraternity by
the school/nationals/the housing
corps if they dared to break the
vow of silence around the latest
hazing investigation.

The destruction of Phi Kappa
Psi’s Davidson Park house will
leave the fraternity, Washington
and Lee’s oldest, off campus for
the ﬁrst time in its 152 year his-

visiting campus.

Faculty members of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee is ecstatic
about the new plan.

“It’s no secret that we hate the
Greek scene,” one faculty mem-
ber said. “All you students do is
get drunk and go hook up with
each other. Then you skip my 9
a.m. class or show up so hung-
over that you have to put your
head down on the desk or run out
every 10 minutes to puke. I’m
happy that I’ll ﬁnally have stu-

dents who are more interested in
having deep, philosophical dis-
cussions with me.”

The SAC has also been busy

punishing fraternities, so the end.

of the Greek system will relieve
their workload.

“With Davidson Park out of
the way, the only fraternities left
are FIJI and Chi Psi,” said SAC
chair and Dean of Students Dawn
Watkins. “It’s just a matter of
time before the FIJIS do some-
thing that we can frame them for,
and I’m sure we can build a case
against Chi Psi by arguing that
dancing on the bar at late night is
highly dangerous. This should be
a piece of cake.”

Alumni could not be reached
for comment, mainly because all
of them dropped dead of a heart
attack when they heard the news.
A loud humming noise was also
heard in the basement of Lee Cha-
pel. The source of the noise could
not be immediately veriﬁed, but
paranormal experts think it was
probably Robert E. Lee spinning
in his grave.‘

  Is something in the campus water?

Ruscio goes crazy and ﬂees after the Bracket and DT F list make him hate his new job

By Dan Thomas Farragut
surr wrmzn

Two years after Lexington’s
water treatment plant failed its
annual health inspection, city
and university oﬂicials are
worried that the water is un-
safe once again.

The concerns came after a
strange wave of mental prob-
lems swept over the Wash-
ington and Lee campus this
winter. The normal cries of ci-

vility, diversity and honorabil-

ity have been replaced by the
screaming catty girls arguing
over who really are Down To
F***'

Dana Smith, the normally
placid director of sorority life,
was seen wandering around
muttering, “I thought this sort
of stuff only happened in fra-
ternities. I don’t understand
what happened.”

It is" currently unknown if
the list’s author drank bottled
water or had been using the

city water supply. Since she
has left town, health depart-
ment officials are struggling
to complete the necessary test-
ing.
President and chief broad-
cast mail writer Ken Ruscio
was unavailable for comment.
There were unsubstantiated ru-

As he left his ofﬁce, Ruscio
had the following statement
for a Phi reporter who was
on the scene: “I came to Lex-
ington to run a college, not a
P“**ing middle school. This is
absurd.”

Provost June Aprille was
reported to have ﬂed as well,

“I came to Lexington to run a col-
lege, not a ]‘***ing middle school.

This is absurd ”

 

mors that he had read the list,
thrown his hands up in disgust
and simply ﬂed for Richmond.
Students on the University
of Richmond campus report
that an unshaven man with a
rumpled suit had been seen
wandering the campus over
the weekend, but it was not
immediately clear if this was
Ruscio.

following Ruscio back to
Richmond just nine months
after she followed him to Lex-
ington.

During Ruscio’s absence,
the school is under the leader-
ship of history professor Jef-
ferson Davis Futch.

“I think there’s a simple
solution to this,” Futch told a
group of male history majors.

“If we went back to being all
male, we could send these lists
out about Sweet Briar and H01-
lins girls without anyone ever
knowing. I’m telling you, all
these problems started when
we let in those girls.”

Phi Kap members said they
had been bewildered to receive
the list.

“I don’t get it,” said one
Phi Kap senior. “Did this girl
think we were really too stupid
to ﬁgure out which girls want
to hang out with us?”

The Geology department
reported that there was a 4.2
magnitude earthquake last
week. The seismic activity
was attributed to the force of
1700 jaws hitting the ground
as students read the infamous
list. ‘

W&L doctor Jane Horton
urged students to use caution

until tests of the city’s water
supply are ﬁnished.

“Obviously something is
in the water, so please just
drink bottled products over the
next few days,” Horton said.
“We’re very committed to the
health and safety of students,
so please be assured that we’ll
get this bizarre illness ﬁgured
out. Of course, there is one so-
lution to this whole issue. You
all could quit being mean ba-
bies and learn to get along with
one another.”

Faced with Horton’s sug-
gestion, students shrugged
their shoulders.

“Why shouldn’t we know
who’s DTF,” one junior male
asked. “It makes things easier
when I go out. Besides, guys
like seeing girls ﬁght with each
other. It’s fun to watch.”

Have you seen this man? he may have fled to Rich-
mond after W&L students continued to act like
12-year-olds on a daily basis.

Baner quits W&L to take job   '

as new Lexington police ofﬁcer

By Davld Van Patten
STAFF WRITER

Tired of having to jump the
dead batteries of fancy student
cars, long-time Washington and
Lee security guard Thomas “Ba-
ner” Bane announced yesterday
that he is resigning from the
W&L security force and taking an
immediate job as a patrol officer
with the Lexington Police Depart-
ment.

“The decision was really
simple,” Baner said. “As a Lex-
ington officer, I can carry a gun,
which Mike [Young, Director of
Public Safety] would never let me

I’m quitting

By PauIA|len
surr wanna

A senior member of the
powerful Student Recruitment
Committee resigned from the
committee Monday, creating a
media ﬂurry outside the Admis-
sions Ofﬁce House.

The former SRC member,
Skip Hockenpayne (R-Ala-
bama), cited the recent wave of
scandals that have been rocking
Washington & Lee as his rea-
son for stepping down.

“After Bracketgate, I was
determined to push on and
continue the important job of
recruiting students to this ex-
tremely prestigious institution,”
said a teary-eyed Hockensmith,
his Sweet Briar import-girl-
friend standing next to him.

“But after the recent events
of DTFgate, I’ve lost faith in
the legitimacy of this commit-
tee and being a W&L student
in general,” said Hockensmith.
“I mean, how can we as SRC
members allow ourselves to
perpetuate this lie that Wash-
ington and Lee is a place of
civility? I can’t bring myself to
lie to another high school pros-

 

do around campus. I’m going to
have a great time ﬁring warning
shots when I get a noise complaint
down in Red Square.”

Baner said he was also excited
to stop driving around a silly, grey
SUV.

“I mean, the security jeeps
weren’t terrible, but they don’t
have any sirens. How on Earth
can I zoom around the parking
garage when I don’t even have
lights or a siren on top of my
W&L security vehicle?”

Baner, a long-time student
favorite, faces an uncertain re-
ception when he comes back

onto campus wearing the blue
uniforms of Lexington’s (not-so)
ﬁnest. Some students say they’ll
be happy to have a familiar face
on the police force, while others
worry that he’ll be corrupted by
the mean members of the police
force.

“I don’t know what to think,”
one senior said. “On the one
hand, it’s hard to see Baner ﬂip-
ping out and charging everyone
who talks back to him with as-
sault on a police officer. But on
the other hand, something about

makes people go crazy.”

Members of Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity have such a close re-
lationship with Baner that they
made him an honorary member
several years ago. Now, the fra-
ternity is unsure of what to do
with the man they thought of as
almost a father ﬁgure.

“He sold out, no question
about it,” one Phi Kap told the
Phi. “We are just totally blown

. away by this move; we never saw

it coming.” '

Police Chief Steve Crowder
said he was excited by the newest
addition to his staff.

“Baner has been around this

town forever,” Crowder said. “He
knows where all the parties are,
where all the drugs are hidden on
campus. You name it, he knows
about it. I’m hoping that this will
really help us increase our arrests

of students, and that revenue will '

help us get more shiny equipment
like the tasers we got to shoot
W&L students wit .”

The tasers, purchased last year,
were given to ofﬁcers so they
could shock drunk and unruly
students around town. Crowder
told his oﬁicers that tasers are
preferable to real guns because
they “aren’t as messy, and prob-

ably lead to fewer lawsuits.”

Baner said that even though
he’s wearing a new uniform, driv-
ing a new car and finally carrying
a gun, he’ll be the same security-
minded person he always is.

“I think I’ll keep my old W&L
ticket book,” he said. “That way,
if I see you parked in the wrong
W&L parking lot, I can give you

a city ticket and a W&L ticket at I

the same time. And because I’ve
got a gun on my hip, students are
probably going to argue a lot less
with me about the extra charges.”

pect, and I won’t.”

Hockensmith said that in the
wake of his resignation, he in-
tends to spend some more time
with his family, frat brothers,
and keg-a-rator.

Hockensmith’s resignation
is the only the latest in a recent
wave of trouble for Washington
& Lee students.

In recent months there have
been numerous calls for the res-
ignations of various students by
the pundits and public alike.

The student body has also
seen its approval ratings plum-
met, meanwhile, while only one
or two of the scandal-plagued
student body members have
stepped down.

Among the student com-
mittees hit the most hard by
the wave of scandals are the
Trident, fraternities, and so-
rorities. There have also been
rumblings of an independent
counsel investigation into the
drinkers, smokers, and tokers.

“I think there is deﬁnitely
a sentiment right now that the
student body isn’t being very
responsible,” said student
Hannah-Elizabeth-Sarah-Jes-

sica Albridge (R — Mississippi).

“I’ll admit that if you look
at what we’ve accomplished
this last term, and it’s not very
promising.”

Albridge cited the recent
100th Mock Convention as the
key achievement of the 259th
Student Body so far this year.

“But even that seemed like
a temporary ﬁx to our college’s
sliding reputation,” said Al-
bridge, pointing out that the
student body still hasn’t shown
any of the promised leader-
ship it gained admission on in
the areas of academic achieve-
ment, character development,
or athletic prowess.

“And I think a lot of my
peers across the Hill will agree
that you don’t want to begin the
discussion on how badly we’re
doing on the diversity issue,”
said Albridge.

With sliding approval num-
bers for the more senior mem-
bers of the Student Body, many
analysts are predicting nearly
a fourth of the current student
body won’t return to the Hill in
the fall.

“There’s deﬁnitely a strong
crop of challengers looking to
knock the incumbent seniors

Student says he can ’t save W&L ’s reputation

out of their seats,” said Admis-
sions Dean William Hartog.
Hartog predicted that only a
few of the incumbent seniors

‘would be able to retain their
seats going into the new year,

but that even these would have
little chance of doing much
more than serving out the year
in obscurity.

“It’s a culture of corruption,”
said one urmamed-student body
insider. -

“You hear all the time about
people going to the Hill with
all these ambitions and dreams.
But it doesn’t last. I’d say that
almost all of them are into
drinking and drugs and God-
knows what else by the time
they leave.”

“I think that’s why you see
the public losing faith in the
people up on the Hill. When
you’ve got so many alcoholics
it’s bad enough. But throw in
stuff like Bracketgate and DT-
F gate? It’s too much.”

The latest Gallup poll shows
public approval of Student
Body behavior is at 23%, with
no margin of error.

This past weekend the members of
the Washington and Lee Rowing team
traveled for their ﬁrst duel race in 50
years. Quietly under thecover of night
they departed on Friday morning with
their dilapidated boat strapped down to
their rusting hulk of a truck. The des-
tination was Cambridge, Mass. They
arrived at‘ the Harvard’s Newell Boat
House, late Friday, where two weeks
before the coach Harry Parker dis-
patched a challenge.

Defending National Champion
Harvard ranked number one in the na-
tion preseason, has already disposed
of Princeton, Cal and Wisconsin, this
season, presented a huge opponent for
the generals. The men of the Washing-
ton and Lee team have been practicing
constantly on the Maury since early
December, in hopes of this being their
break out year. ‘ ‘

For Harvard this race was seen as a
joke, a tune up before gearing up for a
ﬁnal push to Olympic preparation. Ac-
cording to Harvard stroke, Smithe Mos-

ingly Doosheington VI, “we wanted to
race the little sisters of the poor for
once. Occasionally we like to see how
the other 99.99% of the nation lives. I
expect this will be quite the show, and
I will be sitting in my ascot at the Fly
Club before they even ﬁnish.”

The Harvard Coach said, “Occa-
sionally I like to just beat up little kids
in order to feel superior about myself.
That is why Iinvited them this week-
end, we just want to beat up on some
hillbillies and rednecks."

This View was surely not enhanced
by Generals puling up to the boathouse
in their rusted truck, which promptly
died in the parking lot. »

Lacking money to stay in a hotel,
the W&L menslept on the ﬂoor of the
boathouse. Yesterday morning the two
teams took to the water is what was
supposed to be a one sided drubbing.
But off the start the Harvard Men were
shocked.

Over the 2000 meter course,,the.

W&L team surged out to an incredible
lead. By the halfway point of the race
the W&L team held a commanding
lead of over 10 boat lengths and a lead

of over a minute. Coming into the last
400m of the race the W&L men did not
even raise their game for a sprint since
they had lostsight of Harvard.*The ﬁnal
margin of victory for the Generals was
2:32 and a margin of 30 lengths, as a
desponded Harvard Coach announced
was , “the curvature of the earth”.

Not even stopping to celebrate of
rest the W&L men rowed back to the
boathouse and in true W&L fashion
changed into their blazers and went
down to the dock to greet their oppo-
nents. A
According to one former Olympian
who watched the race, it was “perhaps
one of the greatest upsets in the history
of sports!” ‘

The team returned to Lexington qui-
etly last night to begin preparation for
their next big test, the Olympics. Last
week the team received notice from the
International Olympic Committee that
they would not be allowed to represent
the Confederate States of America in
the next Olympiad. The team is now
weighing their option of whether to
represent the United States or not. Tri»
als are scheduled to begin this Friday.

SAC issues
frat verdicts

Phi Psi and KA placed on
critical probation for Johnson
Scholar controversy and hazing

By Robert Wason
STAFF WRITER

The Student Affairs Committee recently concluded its
investigations of Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Alpha Order and
.sued its verdicts in a hearing last Wednesday. These pun-
ishments were handed out in response‘ to hazing violations
committed by KA and for the Johnson scholar candidate
controversy surrounding Phi Psi.

"According to the Washington and Lee University web-
site, which enables students to view the ﬁnal decisions of
the SAC, Phi Psi has been placed on “Critical Social Proba-
tion” for one calendar year. This is a punishment that nor-
mally coincides with “a second offense under the University
initiatives of alcohol and other drugs.”

Phi Psi has also been asked to provide the SAC with a
“revised organization reform proposal” by Thursday.

KA, which was recently found guilty of hazing viola-
tions, is now on “Critical Probation,” meaning that the fra-
ternity will be considered for suspension if any other major
violations are committed before the end of the next calendar
year.

“The proactive responses by KA and
fhi Psi leadership exempliﬁz the ide-
als of student self—governance at
W&L. It is an indication that students
are willing to take responsibility for
their actions and learn from their

mistakes. ”
CHRIS WORNOM, IFC Presldent

During this time, KA will be closely monitored by both
the Interfratemity Council (IFC) and the SAC to ensure its
compliance with the rules and policies of Kappa Alpha Or-
der’s National Administrative Ofﬁcc, the standards of W&L
and Virginia state laws. ’

SAC members were unable to divulge further informa-
tion concerning the proceedings of their hearing.

The university website speaks highly of KA’s coopera-
tion, commending it as an ideal model of “collaboration
between the national organization, the local chapter, the In-
terfratemity Council and the University.”

IFC President and SAC member Chris Womom empha-
sized the importance of this productive group effort.

“The proactive responses by KA and Phi Psi leadership

’xemplify the ideals of student self-govcmance at W&L,”
he said. He added, ‘‘It is an indication that students are will-
ing to take responsibility for their actions and learn from
their mistakes.”

Phi Psi President Carson Brunoresponded to the SAC
decision in an e-mail statement.

“The SAC’s decision to uphold the IFC’s recommenda-
tion of Critical Social Probation was fair and understand-
able,” Bruno said in his e-mail. “This was not what I had
expected to have to deal with when I became president, but
now, I think this will help us become a stronger house as we
make changes.”

Dean of Freshman David Leonard also emphasized the '

' portance of creating a hazing-free model of New Member
Education. When asked to comment on the current state of
Greek Life, he said that “the ‘beyond-the—classroom’ experi-
ence is improving at Washington and Lee.”

Although he expressed satisfaction concerning the effi-
ciency of student self-govemance that was demonstrated by
the SAC trials of Phi Psi and KA, Leonard offered a word of
caution to the Greek Community.

“Washington and Lee University is very serious about
ensuring the health and safety of its students, and when in-
dividuals and organizations do things that are not congruent
with University standards, they will be held accountable,”
he said.

As students are ﬁnalizing their

living arrangements for next year ‘

and, in some cases, lamenting the
results of V the lottery for on-cam-
pus housing, there has been a lot
of buzz surrounding the recent
changes that have been made to the
housing scene.

David Leonard, Associate Dean
of Student Affairs and Dean of
Freshmen, explained in detail the
speciﬁc adjustments students can
expect in the coming academic
year. He made it clear that while
there have been several shifts in
the housing plans, there is no rea-
son to worry.

‘”l‘here’s not a shortage,” Leon-
ard said. “It’s not as if we have to
triple [roommates]” or ﬁnd over-
ﬂow housing. -

Due to upcoming renovations
to buildings on the Colonnade,

Baker Hall, currently a freshman
residence hall, will be transformed
into offices for displaced faculty
members. Consequently, the en-
tire ground ﬂoor of Gaines Hall
and some additional space on the
second ﬂoor will be devoted to
ﬁrst—year student housing. Leonard
predicts that about one ﬁfth of next
year’s freshman class will live in
Gaines. A

To combat the stress that these
changes could cause in providing
housing for upper~division stu-
dents, a “small scattering of suites”
in Woods Creek East, formerly
reserved entirely for law students,
has been opened to undergradu-
ates. The building will still, how-
ever, be predominantly assigned to
law students.

“Some students had less of
a chance to live in their No. 1
choice,” said Leonard, explaining
that there has been “a little bit of
dissatisfaction” following the re-

...L

1 Baker Dorm ‘to house faculty oﬁices, additional housing oﬂered in“Gaines and Woods Creek East

sults of the recent housing lottery.
Also to be noted is the fact that
several students who would other-
wise be living in a fraternity house
next year have had to seek housing

, elsewhere.

Residential life “will be a little
more snug this academic year,”
said Leonard. He explained that
there will be much less opportunity
to make room changes after mov-
ing in and advised that students
will have to solve any roommate
problems on their own.

“When there’s not a lot of space
to {switch rooms], it’s amazing
how people learn to get along,” he
said.

Leonard also shared his opti-
mistic plans for greatly improving
residential life in other areas, par-
ticularly for freshmen.

“Twenty to 30 freshmen stu-
dents are typically housed in
Gaines, and most of them feel
rather lonely,” he said. Next year

the residence hall will be home to
80-90 freshmen, and this will help
to “create more of a ﬁrst—year com-
munity in Gaines.”

He noted enthusiastically that
plans are being made to renovate
Gaines, including the Gatehouse,
which will create a refurbished
common area for residents and vis-
itors. The weight room will also be
improved, and Leonard hopes this
will become “one of the primary
social spaces” for residents. Input
for these upcoming projects was
sought from the Residential Life
staff and the Freshman Leadership
Council.

Leonard said he would also like
to facilitate the creation of better
programming and planned activi-
ties for all aspects of on-campus
housing. This would create a better
“feel of community” across resi-
dential life, he said.

Suspected mumps case isolated

Health care professionals urge W&L community to monitor personal health, practice good hygiene

By Grace Wang
NEWS EDITOR

The Student Health Center
warned the W&L community Friday
by e-mail to be wary of a possible
case of mumps after an undergradu-
ate began experiencing symptoms.
Although the Health Center imme-
diately isolated the student, campus
physician Jane Horton said they
did not test for the disease. She
attributes this to the inaccuracy of
mumps testing in Lexington.

Dr. John Sheridan, a physician in
the Emergency Department at Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital, said that he
has not encountered a mumps case
since the 19805.

Dr. Horton conﬁrmed that the
student has now left campus and no
longer poses a threat. She said it is
unlikely that additional cases will
emerge.

According to the Health Center,
the student adhered to university
policy and was fully vaccinated for
mumps, measles and rubella (MMR)
prior to experiencing symptoms.
However, Dr. Horton said that the
MMR vaccination does not always
provide full coverage.

“There’s something about this
strain that has emerged in the past
couple years... Two to ﬁvc percent
[of those vaccinated] may still be

susceptible.”

Dr. Sheridan hypothesized that
this individual was unable to pro-
duce the correct antibodies in re-
sponse to the MMR vaccination.

Similar mumps cases surfaced
about two years ago and resulted
in outbreaks lat several colleges,
including nearby University of Vir-
ginia and the University of Iowa.

The Health Center immediately
notiﬁed close contacts of the symp-
tomatic student, advising them to
monitor their own health in upcom-
ing weeks. Typical symptoms of
the illness include fever, headache,
muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of
appetite.

According to Dr. Horton’s e-mail,
the infected individual can transmit
mumps to an uninfected person from
three days before symptoms appear
to about ﬁve days after symptoms
begin. A person who is exposed to
the virus may not exhibit symptoms
until 16 to 18 days later. However,
this incubation time could be as long
as three weeks.

MMR documentation was then
veriﬁed for these high-risk individu-
als as well as for those lacking both
doses of the vaccine.

Mumps is a viral infection trans-
mitted through shared respiratory
secretions. This can occur readily
when people share food and drink.

Moreover, it is airborne and spread
through skin contact, said Dr. Sheri-
dan.

“The best thing to do is to prac-
tice good hand washing,” he said.
Dr. Horton also recommends cover-
ing coughs and sneezes.

The infection is often character-
ized by swelling of one or more of
the salivary glands, usually of the
parotid glands located within the
cheek and near the jaw line. This
gives infected individuals an ap-
pearance of “chipmunk cheeks.”

However, one third of infections
do not cause apparent salivary gland
swelling and appear as respiratory
tract infections. Severe complica-

      

tions of the illness are also pos-
sible but rare. Dr. Sheridan cited
an important example. “Lymphatic
involvement can spread over the
entire body and cause orchitis, or
swollenness of the testes, in young
men.”

Because mumps is a viral infec-
tion, antibiotic treatment is not use-
ful. Thus, prevention and good hy-
giene are of the utmost importance.

Dr. Horton advises individuals
experiencing any suspicious symp-
toms to seek medical help immedi-
ately. Booster shots for the MMR
vaccination are available through
the Lexington—Rockbridgc Health
Department

‘Reporting back’ to
journa1ism’s roots

W&L hosts spring regional Society of
Professional Journalists conference

By Joel Poelhuls
STAFF WRITER

Journalists from Virginia, Maryland, Delaware
and Washington DC. descended on campus Friday
and Saturday for the Society of Professional Journal-
ists (SPJ) Region II Conference.

SPJ was founded at founded at DePauw Univer-
sity in 1909. It works to advocate free speech and
public information laws as well as to promote dia-
logue about relevant issues within the profession.

The conference included panel discussions, the
Region II Mark of Excellence awards luncheon
and a speech by Democracy Now! journalist Amy
Goodman. Washington and Lee won two Mark of
Excellence Awards, one for the Rockbridge Report
website, and one for inGeneral magazine.

The theme of the conference was “Report Back,”
emphasizing the history of Washington and Lee and
journalism. In 1869, Robert E. Lee decided to offer
50 scholarships to students interested in the profes-
sion of printing and journalism. This is cited as the
ﬁrst journalism program in higher education in the
world.

According to junior Melissa Caron, the treasurer
for the W&L SPJ chapter, it is unusual for a student
chapter to host a regional conference.

“We started planning for it about a year ago,”
Caron said.

At the conference, W&L journalism professor
Edward Wasserrnan unveiled OnPoverty.org, a web-
site created by students and faculty of the journalism
department to provide resources for journalists who
cover issues of poverty, class and economic justice.

Goodman’s speech, which was open to the pub-
lic, covered the failure of mainstream, corporate-
ly-owned media to challenge the powers that be.
Goodman criticized the major news networks for
complicity in the build-up to the war in Iraq. She
also related a story from her own past in which she
and a colleague were beaten by the Indonesian mili-
tary during a protest in East Timor as an example
of how journalists are treated in other parts of the
world. _

A silent auction held during the conference raised
about $450 for the society’s Legal Defense Fund,
which provides ﬁnancial assistance to journalists
facing legal action. Shops in town, area media, and
the W&L bookstore all donated items to the auc-
tron.

Next year’s SPJ conference will be organized by
the professional chapters of Washington, D.C. and
Maryland.

Surviving the aftermath of rape '

Two women share emotional stories, discuss resources available for recovery

By Vlctorla Taylor
smrr wnmzn

Two speakers visited Washington
and Lee last week to address the topic
of sexual assault, speciﬁcally rape, and
its consequences.

Andrea Cooper gave her presen-
tation on Tuesday entitled “Kristin’s
Story” in which she spoke about her
20-year-old daughter who committed
suicide in 1995 after being victimized
by acquaintance rape.

On Wednesday night, Joyce Mc-
Cauley-Benner presented “Victory
Over Violence” as part of the Femi-
nists for Life College Outreach Pro-
gram. McCauley-Benner became
pregnant at the age of 20 and, although
she did not know whether the unborn
child was the result of rape or of her
loving relationship, she decided not to
have an abortion.

Cooper believed that her daughter
suffered from childhood depression
but said that Kristin was happy dur-
ing her teenage years, earning her high
school’s performing arts award. She
began at Baker University, a liberal arts
school in Baldwin City, Kansas with
fewer than 1,000 students in the fall of
1994, where she became a a member
the sorority Alpha Chi Omega.

Kristin once again started showing
signs of depression after her boyfriend
of about a year broke up with her the
following September. According to
Cooper, her daughter seemed to be
back to normal, “almost euphoric,”

> when she came home for Christmas

break. She made plans for New Years
Eve but when Cooper and her husband
returned home at two in the morning,
they saw that all of the lights were on
and that Kristin’s car was still in the
driveway. Once inside, they found
their daughter lying on the ﬂoor with

I a gun in her hand.

“I didn’t see any blood,” said Coo-
per, “and I thank God for that every
day.”

It was only after reading her
daughter’s diary two weeks later that
she learned the cause of her daugh-
ter’s suicide: Kristin had been raped
by a fellow lifeguard at a party that
summer. Upon calling the Alpha Chi
house at Baker, she found out that all
of Kristin’s sorority sisters knew what
had happened, as did her best friend
from high school. Because of these
circumstances, Cooper stressed the
importance of helping friends who are
showing signs of depression.

“My goal is to get people to go to
counseling and get professional help,”
said Cooper, who added that “exten-
sive grief counseling and [her] faith”
are what pulled her through. “Take ad-
vantage of the free services at Wash-
ington and Lee.”

Before she began, Cooper prom-
ised the audience that her talk would
not be a “total downer.”

“I feel that the message I have is
the legacy that Kristin left behind,”
said Cooper.

This was Cooper’s second visit to
W&L’s campus. She also spoke four
years ago and, according to Assistant
Director of Student Activities and
Greek Life Dana Smith, she was “well
received by the student body.”

“It is important for students to hear
a different perspective about rape, de-
pression and suicide to increase un-
derstanding of these complex topics,”
said Smith. “These issues affect so
many college students directly or in-
directly. It is, hopefully, reassuring to
know they are not alone in their reac-
tions, questions and emotions.”

Cooper was a member of Delta
Delta Delta at Florida State University
andjremains an active member of the

Greek community. “Kristin’s Story”
was sponsored by SPEAK, One in
Four, Kappa Kappa Gamma, the Pan-
hellenic Council and the Oﬁice of
Health Promotions.

Students for Life sponsored “Vic-
tory Over Violence,” a talk given
by Feminists For Life of America’s
speaker Joyce McCauley-Benner.
At the age of 20, McCauley-Benner
was raped by a cook at the restaurant
where she was waiting tables. She be-
came pregnant, but until the child was
born, she would not know whether the

I father of the child was her boyfriend

or the rapist.

Living on her own and trying to
support herself through college, she
felt helpless. McCauley-Benner made
what she called a “desperate phone
call home to a friend” who gave Mc-
Cauley-Benner the advice that she
said helped her make up her mind to
keep the baby: “No one emotion will
last forever; an abortion will.”

“That comment hit me like a ton
of bricks,” said McCauley-Benner.
“While I didn’t know who the father
was, I did know who the mother was.
It was me.”

She moved back home and gave
birth to a baby boy, whom she named
Joshua McCauley. He is now eight
years old.

After sharing her story, McCauley-
Benner explained the beliefs of Femi-
nists for Life. Contrary to the common
belief that all feminists must be pro-
choice, FFL is based on the teachings
of the “ﬁrst wave” of feminists like
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady
Stanton who celebrated “motherhood
as womanhood” and were against
abortion.

She also spoke about the Elizabeth

Cady Stanton Pregnant and Parenting I
Students Act which would provide on- A _

campus support for pregnant and par-
enting students. McCauley-Benner,
who is a college graduate, said she had
a difficult time going back to school
after she gave birth.

“People stared at me like ‘why are
you putting a damper on the party at-
mosphere?”’ she said.

She told the audience that they had
the power to “revolutionize this cam-
pus to empower women” and then
take those skills into the work place
because that’s what is going to “revo-
lutionize America.” She stressed the
importance of providing resources to
college women who experience an un-
planned pregnancy so that they do not
have to choose abortion.

Sophomore Students for Life sec-
retary Sarah Keckler was responsible
for organizing the event, which in-
cluded contacting FFL and sending
out ﬁmdraising letters to local church-
es. She said that there were a number
of speakers that they could choose.

“[McCauley-Benner’s story] was
the one that really stood out,” said Ke-
ckler, “because sexual assault is such
a problem on W&L’s campus. We

China’s atrocities
warrant protests

Athletes should speak out at Olympics

By Abel Delgado

§.COLUMNlST

Far too often we equate athletic feats with heroism. We idolize those
who just happen to have the skills we wished we were born with, those
who entertain us with the art of humane competition. Too often we pay

J little attention to the actual heroes.

1 Don’t expect to ﬁnd any heroes at the Beijing Olympics this sum-
mer. The host nation has a policy of silencing the people I like to call
heroes that includes everything from torture to execution. In all its
glory and wisdom, the International Olympic Committee chose China

i to host the world’s most prestigious athletic and cultural gathering de-
- spite the complete lack of respect for human dignity the government

has shown.
The IOC apparently wants us to forget the heroes, to forget the

Buddhist Monks in Tibet who continue to be brutalized by Chinese

occupiers, forget the Darfur rebels who have to watch their children
starve and their women raped by Sudanese forces supported by China,
to forget the reportedly 10,000 Chinese that the Beijing government
executes yearly. The Olympics are no time for politics they say. Appar-
ently they are just the time to glorify a brutal, murderous regime.
Does no one remember 1936? Any person who loves sports has to
cringe when shown the pictures of Hitler’s propaganda machine using
the Berlin Olympics to stir up Nazi Nationalism. It’s no secret that the
2008 Olympics are meant to be a coming out party for China, a country

» that wants to take an even greater place in the world. This was the exact

intention of 1936 and we seem doomed to repeat history. This century,
after all, is supposed to be the “Chinese Century,” and no doubt the
Chinese see their Olympic bid as a legitimization or at least an accep-
tance of their vicious practices by the rest of the world.

And now the heroes, those who ﬁght for human rights and
dignity, some who sacriﬁce their own rights in order to ﬁght
for the freedom of others, are being lambasted and scold-
ed, told they should not dare protest during the Olympics, be-
cause as IOC Chairman Jacques Rogge so pompously puts it,
“It is always sad to see such a ceremony disrupted.”

We are talking about a country that uses execution buses, which
according to Sky News are “ﬁtted with lethal injection equipment, [so]
they can deliver on-the-spot executions.” We are talking about a coun-
try which, according to its own official ﬁgures, executes more people
than the rest of the world put together. We are talking about a country
that gives their full support to the genocide-committing government of
Sudan and to oppressive regimes in Burma, Cuba, and Zimbabwe.

And IOC Chairman says he ﬁnds a little protesting disturbing?
How holding up signs and making a political statement is worse than a
butchering bus is a beyond me.

This is not a call for a total boycott. It would do us little good to
have athletes and nations with a social conscience have a medal count
of zero while those who lack the fortitude to stand by the beaten, down-
trodden and executed get all the glory of Olympic gold. No, we should
all be there and protest.

Forget what China, the IOC and the major corporate sponsors be-

hind the Beijing Olympics want you to believe. Athletes should speak
up against China every time they have microphone in front of them. I
wish we had a Jesse Owens, who just by winning medals heroically
deﬁed the Nazi propaganda of 1936, but we don’t. Instead we need all
who participate to take a stand.
‘ Before the Olympic torch arrives in Beijing, it will pass through
Tibet. It would symbolically ﬁtting if the ﬂame were somehow extin-
guished there, to prove the Olympic spirit and ideals has no doubt been
diminished.

  Outlawirig the slurs

Hate speech proposal pushes for equality, dignity

I am writing in response
to the Ring Tum Phi’s recent
editorial regarding my organi-
zation’s hate speech proposal.
The editors and authors of that
piece have offered a sincere ob-
jection to this proposal based on
student freedom of expression.
However, our proposed policy
leaves student expression fully
intact and works to combat one
of the greatest challenges to our
institution. I admit that I am
largely responsible for some of
the misconceptions because I
did not provide the paper with
a full copy of my proposal that
includes an 18 page memo, and
oral commentary and revision.

The editors also provided
me with a copy of the news
article, though I did not re-
ceive the editorial in advance.
The editors’ understandably
less than complete knowledge
of the proposed policy has led
them to mischaracterize it in a
number of ways, which I now
seek to correct. [Author’s note,
this version is severely abridged
to comply with the Phi’s word
limits. For a full version, please
contact the author: martinjb@
wlu.edu.

The editors discuss at some
length what I “should know”
about the law, freedom of ex-
pression and policy. I wish to
reassure them that I will re-dou-
ble my efforts to ﬁll in the ap-
parent gaps in my knowledge.
Although I am unable to com-
ment on what I should know, I
am able to expose to the reader
a little bit of what I do know:
1) the First Amendment is not
binding upon this university (as
the editors concede) and 2) the
First Amendment does not pro-
vide the range of protection that
the editors assert. As to the ﬁrst
point, ss long as freedom of
expression is conscientiously
preserved and everpresent in
the minds of university deci-
sion-makers, the university is

free to set policy that does not
perfectly ﬁt every contour of
First Amendment law.

Regarding the second point,
the editors give one the im-
pression that the First Amend-
ment always protects certain
words, including racist, sexist,
or homophobic slurs. This is
not true. The First Amendment
does not universally protect or
proscribe particular words. The
Constitution and traditional no-
tions of free speech present a
balance of fundamental rights,
context, and certain compelling
interests of the state. Freedom
of expression does not contem-
plate absolutes, nor does our
policy proposal.

“[n]othing in this section shall
be construed to limit, prevent,
or prohibit free and open class-
room discussion, or the full and
free expression of moral, social,
philosophical, religious, and po-
litical views.” In other words, if
an individual can demonstrate
that the use of hate speech is a
substantial and important part
of their expressive message or
views, she can still escape the
reach of the policy.

The First Amendment al-
lows policy-makers to respond
to compelling harms, as long
as they carefully tailor the re-
sponse to those harms. Our
policy proposal comports with
this principle because there are

How have  people calling the f-word (in

reference to gay people) across the room

enlightened our student population or con-

tributed some new idea to our discourse?

The editors cite multiple im-
portant legal cases to support
their argument, yet the policy
will comply with content neu-
trality principles. In addition,
the editors ignore many cases
that allow the government to
prescribe verbal conduct that is
“no essential part of any expo-
sition of ideas, and are of such
slight social value as a step to
truth that any beneﬁt that may
be derived from them is clearly
outweighed by the social in-
terest in order and morality.”
Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942). See
also Wrginia v. Black, 538
U.S. 343 (1996) (allowing the
government to prohibit cross-
burning despite its expressive
content).

The proposal further pro-
tects student expression saying

countless documented harms
of hate speech ranging from
violence, to the creation of a
hostile environment, to public
image consequences, to men-
tal health effects. The policy
responds to the great need to
prevent this harm to university
students. The policy follows the
least restrictive means of doing
so by preserving the content
of message, and as the policy
progresses, it will undoubtedly
feature the tightest possible
deﬁnition of hate speech in its
ﬁnal iteration.

Above all, the editors have
not explained speciﬁcally what
hate speech, in reality, adds to
our discourse. How have the
crowds of people calling the f—
word (in reference to gay peo-
ple) across the room enlight-
ened our student population or

contributed some new idea to
our discourse?

The Ring Tum Phi’s editori-
al insists that our policy would
“force morality” upon univer-
sity students. Nothing could be
further from the truth. The pro-
posed policy does not address
the morality of hate speech,
nor does it require students to
accept that it is immoral. The
policy recognizes the objective
harms to our campus climate
and to our students resulting
from hate speech and addresses
them. This policy, like any oth-
er university policy, does not
impose some sort of “punish-
ment” out of a sense of moral
blameworthiness or character
judgment.

The editors conjure up a
plethora of troubling images
including curfews and single-
sex dorms. These images may
be powerful, but they simply
have nothing to do with our
proposal. To state the obvious,
we have not proposed a single
sex dorm or a curfew. More
fundamentally, those images
reﬂect enforcement of tradi-
tional gender’ norms or views
of late-night activity that bear,
at best, a tangential relation-
ship to some objective danger
to student safety or welfare. By
contrast, our policy directly at-
tacks an identiﬁed, documented
harm. Our proposal has noth-
ing to do with enforcing gen-
der norms or a particular social
viewpoint.

Before we can talk about free
speech, we must have equality
and personal dignity that al-
low all students to contribute to
our community and discourse.
Therefore, my parting image to
the readers is "the image of the
Supreme Court Justices who
decided Brown v. Board of Ed-
ucation. Broadly speaking, this
historic case represents the fun-

See “EQUALITY" on page 6

True diversity needed

Fight hate speech by learning about others, not banning exchange

After reading the Phi’s cov-
erage of all these campus is-
sues over the past two months, I
have felt compelled to share my
disappointment in the way we
have been trying to solve them.
Rather than looking at why our
problems exist and creating an
environment to facilitate health-
ier behavior, we say “Hey, that’s
bad. Don’t do that... or else!”

But this is approach is al-
ways bound to fail. As the edi-
torial piece said last week, “you
can’t teach college students mo-
rality.” We seem to be caught
in a neverending game of
“Whack-a-Mole,” but we need
to think about how to inhibit the
moles from surfacing in the ﬁrst
place.

The recently proposed hate
speech policy sent a shiver down
my spine. The main reason I
came to Washington and Lee is
precisely because we are one of
the few colleges left that does
not have any unconstitutional
speech codes limiting what a
student can and cannot say. I
loathe political correctness and
ﬁrmly believe it prohibits intel-
lectual development. How can
we learn about each other and
the world if we are afraid to say
what is on our minds because
of fear it will offend someone?
When something offends us, it
is because it challenges our be-
liefs—that, to me, is the essence
of learning. V

While I do laud the limiting
of the proposed policy to nar-

rowly deﬁned “hate speech,"
and not “anything found of-
fensive to other students" as
is common in other schools, it
is still impractical. Applying
speech codes without actually
letting students learn about oth-
ers for themselves doesn’t ac-
complish anything. It’s only a
band-aid, not a solution.

We need to have an envi-
ronment that naturally fosters
contact between people of dif-
ferent sex, race, religion, sexual
orientation, etc. Any claims of

graduating devoid of the inter-
cultural exchange essential to
success in today’s globalized
business world.

What better way to under-
stand different types of people
than by living with them? Un-
fortunately, our Greek system
is a natural dividing factor.
The astronomically high cost
of fraternity membership is an
immediate barrier to many stu-
dents here on full scholarship.
With notable exceptions, the
international students are segre-

ers down my spine. When something offends

us, it is because it challenges our beliefs

diversity will be conﬁned only
to numbers seen on paper until
such an environment is created,
and it is simply irresponsible for
the university to advertise and
promote “diversity” without
providing the appropriate forum
for its realization.

If we are truly an institution
that “produces leaders” through
a “liberal arts education for the
21*‘ century,” then we need to
get into the 215‘ century. The fact
that the hate speech policy even
had to be brought up is a clear
indication that our students are

gated from day one, and it only
gets worse from year to year as
they are lumped all together in
university housing while the
wealthy white American popu-
lation lives amongst themselves
in the fraternity scene, deprived
of the potentially wonderful
beneﬁts of intercultural ex-
change.

But it’s not just a “Greek
versus non-Greek” barrier. In-
tegration between fraternities
is even a huge problem. The
sororities, however, are a good
example of how we can have a

Greek system without fewer of
the problems inherent amongst
fraternities in their current in-
carnation. The close physical
proximity is a factor, but what’s
more important is that there are
few enough of them that they
are not in cutthroat competition
all fall term. We have nearly
the same amount of fratemi-
ties as we did when we were
all male, but we have only half
of the number of males to draw
from! As such, there is an in-
credibly unhealthy divisiveness
between houses of males who
would in normal circumstances
be friendly with each other.If
we were somehow able to have
around seven fraternities, this
unnecessary hostility would
disappear and would encourage
more inter-fratemal interaction,
helping to build a stronger over-
all community.

Unfortunately I see no fea-
sible way of going about that
change, but even if it were to
somehow happen, gender rela-
tions would remain an issue.
Let’s face it—this environment
is not at all conducive to the
formation of co-ed groups of
friends. If recent Phi articles
on this topic are any indication,
students overwhelmingly want
more everyday gender interac-
tion.

Well, here’s a solution that
would substantially improve the
predicament: build more dorms,

Vision of equality

-damental notion that, when certain limited expressive values collide
with our society’s dedication to equality, equality must prevail in a
civil and democratic society. Those who opposed integration in Brown
pointed out that they had the right to associate and disassociate with
whomever they wished in order to express their views and their op-
position to desegregation. They asserted their fundamental expressive
rights in opposition to those who worked to end segregation.

Yet the unanimous Court barely made note of these fundamental ex-
pressive concerns because ‘it believed that the paramount value of our
government and our society is equality. The Court endorsed a vision
of equality for all that was not just formal or nominal but substantive,
and it did so in the face of serious expressive concerns. The university
must have the courage to do the same. There are obvious differences
between legally enforced segregation and the tacitly enforced inequali-
ties of this campus, but one cannot help but notice the similarities as
well. On our campus, there are victims of hate speech who cannot ex-
press their views or take full advantage of educational opportunities,
and there are those who, whether intentionally or not, use hate speech
to oppress others while still being free to express their own views.

The university can and should act to end this divide, or “segrega-
tion” if you will, between different groups of students. The university
may have to respect speech, but it also has the highest possible obliga-
tion to provide equal protection and equal opportunity for its students.
We urge all university students to join us in the effort to pass this cru-
cial policy initiative.

More time together

Proposal cure: Two years on campus

and have students live on campus for two years before moving into
their Greek houses. It’s simply unfair to have one semester to make
your static friendships for all four years of college.

I, for one, wish I had a lot more time to interact and discover before
having everything set in stone by the time pledgeship season rolled
around. Having that one extra year of living with people not in the
same Greek organization will provide a necessary period of interaction
that can only serve to bring the community closer together and contrib-
ute to the true intellectual development of all students.

Living together forces people to gain a deeper understand-
ing of each others’ backgrounds. If we are exposed every day to
different genders, races, religions, sexual orientations, etc. then
it will severely hamper our tendency to engage in hate speech,
rendering the ratiﬁcation of any official policy a moot point.
I’ve spoken to a lot of people who agree with what I’ve said, and I’m
curious to see if more people feel the same way. Whether you share
these sentiments not, I’d like to see what you think. Feel free to email
me, or better yet, send another letter to the editor.

of the Rising Senior and Junior Classes

Members of the Classes of 2009 and 2010 are invited to apply for the S. Cullum Owings, Jr. Fellowship for
the Academic Year 2008-2009. The holder of this fellowship will receive a credit of $1250 toward each term’s
tuition and will be expected to make several visits to secondary schools around the country to promote the
Initiative for Academic Integrity under the guidance of the Washington and Lee Institute for Honor. Together
with most such visits, the Owings Fellow will also visit the local chapter of the Washington and Lee Alumni
Association to discuss the state of the University from a student’s point of view, with particular regard to the

Honor System.

Cullum Owings was a member of the Class of 2003, an exceptional individual from Atlanta, Georgia, who

died tragically in an automobile accident during his senior year. ‘

The Fellowship is administered by the Campus Committee of the Washington and Lee Institute for Honor.
Criteria for selection of Owings Fellows are, ﬁrst of all, that the applicants should possess outstanding per-
sonal integrity. They should be good scholars, but the fellowship is not limited to students with exceptional
grade-point averages. They should be articulate, with some grace and poise in demeanor, while at the same
time being sensitive to the values and opinions of others. They should be students who show promise of de-

veloping into community leaders of high standards.

Applicants may submit their applications to Professor Emeritus Lewis G. John, Department of Politics,
through campus mail. There is no application form, but the application should include:

(1) A copy of the student’s transcript
(2) A resume of activities and special talents

(3) An essay of approximately 250 words with the heading, “How my personal values_and experience
qualify me to represent Washington and Lee as a Cullum Owings ’03 Fellow”

(4) A statement of willingness to make the off-campus visits as described above

(5) Names of two or more members of the faculty from whom the selection committee may seek recom-

mendations

Applications are due by Friday, April 11, 2008. The selection process will include interviews early in the
spring term with those applicants judged most worthy on the basis of their written applications. Questions
may be addressed to Professor Lewis John at (johnl@wlu.edu) or to Professor John Gunn at gunnj@wlu.

Forgive and forget '

Politicians ’mistakes don ’t aﬂect job performance

By crlghton Allen
STAFF WRITER

On March 17, 2008, David
Paterson was sworn in as the
55th governor of New York fol-
lowing the resignation of the
disgraced Elliot Spitzer after his
involvement with a “high-class”
prostitute ring.

David Paterson is a highly
accomplished man. He holds
degrees from Columbia Uni-
versity and Hofstra University
School of Law. He served with
distinction for many years as a
member of the state Senate and

. served four terms as the Senate

Minority Leader.

Yet, Paterson has many a
skeleton lurking in his closet.
He has engaged in many extra-
marital affairs. For one tryst,
he billed his hotel room for the
night to his campaign reelection
fund. Paterson, in his youth was
also a heavy user of marijuana
and tried cocaine “a few times.”

How do I know all this?
Sadly, it is not because I am
the second coming of the great
investigative
Woodward. No, I know all this
for a far simpler reason. One day
after his swearing in, Paterson
publicly acknowledged his inﬁ-
delity and a few days after, his
drug use.

I applaud Mr. Paterson for his
disclosure, yet I wonder: Should
he really have had to? The only
people he needs to reconcile his
past with are himself and his
family. It is not the business of

journalist Bob .

anyone else in the whole wide
world that Paterson has a past
like he does.

Just because Paterson is a
politician, it does not put him
under any obligation to publicly
come clean.

Before Jimmy the plumber
ﬁxes your leaky pipe, he doesn’t
give you full disclosure of his
past transgressions. Why? Be-
cause you don’t care. You just
want him to do his job well and
get out. So then why should you
care what a politician did if he
can do his job well in the pres-
ent?

Does it really matter that Pa-
terson slept with a woman not
his wife or smoked a few joints
or blew a few lines in his 20s?
The man is now 53 years old.
There is no reason why actions
committed 30 years ago should

be wielded as political weapons’

against Paterson as if they can
affect his ability to run a state
right now.

Let me be clear: I do not
condone his adultery or drug
use, but I am realistic enough
to know that plenty more for-
mer occupants of the govemor’s
mansion were no better than Pa-
terson, yet they ran New York
free from molestation. Why
should Paterson not get the same
treatment?

All actions have conse-
quences, and I am sure that
Paterson has suffered plenty in
his relationship with his fam-
ily, especially his wife, when he
was ﬁnally forced to confront

his actions. This is punishment,
enough; the man came out and
acknowledged his transgres-
sions in the past and asked for
forgiveness and cooperation in
the future as he works to make
New York a better state. Any
New Yorker who cannot forgive,
forget and agree to work with
Paterson now is a far greater
hindrance to the future success
of New York than anything Pat-
erson could have ever done.

I think now would be an ap-
propriate time for all of us to
turn the accusatory ﬁgure we
like to jab at public ﬁgures who
are caught doing wrong back on
ourselves. By way of example,
people love to roast Bill Clinton
for his actions with Monica Le-
winsky. But let’s think about this
seriously for second.

Did Clinton getting a little
somethin’ somethin’ on the side
really affect his ability to carry
out his duties as president?
Sure, he may have had sex with
Monica in the Oval Ofﬁce, but
did that affect his ability to sign
a good bill into law in that very
same room a few hours later?
The answer is no.

On the other hand, how about
a Washington and Lee student
who gets drunk on Saturday
night and wakes up on Sunday
morning to write a paper? The
nasty hangover he has the next
morning is going to make star-
ing at a computer screen for sev-
eral hours about as much fun as
a root canal without anesthesia.

Now think about it rationally.

Which of the two, Bill Clinton
or the student, has his current

action aﬁfected more by his past ,

behavior?

All I am trying to say is that .

we all have done things that we
regret and that have had conse-
quences. Most of us have had

our errors forgiven and are now ..

living our lives with the grace of
the forgiveness of others.
If people made a mistake in

the past, regretted their actions, 
made amends as best they could, '

and tried their utmost to live

their lives in the future in a way -

that shows they learned from

their mistakes, they deserve ev- ,

ery right to a second chance.

Paterson and every other C
public ﬁgure has just as much of .
a right to that second chance as =

you or me. That he is the gov-
ernor of New York makes no
difference; he still deserves the
chance to give his best shot at
doing his job. Despite popular

belief, politicians are people too, .

even the most debauched among
them.

So let’s all dismount from the
high horses that we so hypocriti-
cally ride and follow the (I can’t
believe I am about to write this,

but it’s true) sage advice of the _

Youngbloods when they sing,
“C’mon people now, smile on
your brother. Ev’rybody get to-
gether, try and love one another
right now.”

Why can the EC punish the papers?

Student government oversight kin to censorship; self-governance better option

As we start to ﬁnally put “The
Bracket,” behind us, last week’s
Media Board hearing about the
issue made one thing clear: it’s
time for the Executive Commit-
tee to remove itself from run-
ning the Media Board.

The editor of each campus
publication has a seat on the
Media Board, and the board has
the power to hear complaints
against publications and then,
if it chooses to, sanction those
publications.

In this case the board recom-
mended that there be no sanc-
tions.

Instead, we urged the Trident
— and all publications — to devel-
op a mission statement and code
of ethics. Incidentally, you can
read the Phi’s mission statement
in our staff box.

Despite the board’s deci-
sion, it wasn’t the ﬁnal word.
The EC met and voted whether

they wanted to accept the Media
Board recommendations.

This week, they did.

But it is unacceptable for an
institution of government — stu-
dent government in this case ~ to
have censorial control over the
press.

If the EC doesn’t like aggres-
sive coverage of its actions, can
the Phi or Trident expect to be
punished for their reporting?

Beyond the walls of Wash-
ington and Lee, the First Amend-
ment protects the press’s ability
to report on — and criticize ~ the
government.

In fact, the press has a duty to
be a watchdog over institutions
of power.

Journalists at W&L don’t en-
joy those same protections. Re-
moving the EC from the Media
Board process would go a long
way towards returning those
protections to students.

The best solution, in our
minds, would be the total demo-
lition of the Media Board. No
board would leave no room for
EC interference.

Sanctions are so rarely ap-
propriate or necessary that the
board really serves no purpose
(trust us, if you’ve been to ear-
lier Media Board meetings you
know what a snoozefest they
usually are).

Student publications, how-
ever, do use university oﬂice
space (the Phi and the Trident
included).

And some student publica-
tions receive money from the
EC during the annual appropria-
tions process (though the Phi
and Trident do not).

So unless the publications
are all willing to move out of
their Commons ofﬁce space, the
Media Board may have a role to
ﬁll.

Because of the money being
handed out, we understand the
EC’s desire to see some super-
vision.

That’s a role the Media Board
can ﬁll, serving as an advisor to
student publications and a place
where editors can come together
to share ideas and suggestions.

The EC, however, needs to
totally remove itself from any
disciplinary process adminis-
tered by the Media Board.

As long as the EC has the
power to’ hear complaints and
issue punishments, the student
press on this campus will be un-
able to cover the community in a
truly open and effective manner.

Outside the walls of campus,
the press can operate without
the government looking over its
shoulder.

The same should hold true
at a school that prides itself on
self-govemance.

‘ Concert to enlighten

A.C. T Guns and Dolls week Supports Uganda

By Michael Morella
STAFF WRITER

On any given night in Ugan-
da, -dozens of children could be
abducted and forced to serve as
soldiers in the nation’s continued
civil strife. For 20 years, as many
as 66,000 children have been in-
volved in the war and victims
of violent, sometimes inhuman,
crimes.

On Tuesday night in the Bak-
er-Davis-Gilliam Quad, dozens
of Washington and Lee students,
faculty and community members
will try and do something to stop
it.

W&L will host the ﬁrst ever
Guns and Dolls Concert, a free
event, to promote awareness of
the situation in Uganda. Three
student bands — Two Dirt Road,
Agent Flynn and the Lalai Damas
— will perform from 6 to 8 p.m.
to kick off Guns and Dolls Week,
which will raise money to aid‘
prevention of human rights viola-
tions against the children of war-
tom Uganda.

“[It’s] very hard for these kids
to go back home,” said sopho-
more Kushal Harjani, president of
A.C.T. (Action. Change. Tomor-
row), the student group sponsor-
ing the event. “[They] are often
forced to commit atrocities against
their own family members.”

According to Resolve Uganda,

' a Washington, D.C.-based orga-

nization dedicated to helping the
situation in central Africa, the
Lord’s Resistance Army continues
to ﬁght rival political and military
organizations and to terrorize the
Ugandan population.

The army was formed in the

1980s under the leadership of Jo-
seph Kony. Harjani said that over
80 percent of the LRA’s troops are
composed of children.

Many other children, called
“night commuters,” ﬂee their
homes to safe towns each night to
avoid abduction by the LRA.

Harjani says that proceeds
from the concert, as well as all
donations to A.C.T., will beneﬁt
both Resolve Uganda and World
Vision, a nonproﬁt organization
focused on aiding the plight of
children refugees.

“With a simple amount of $30,
we can sponsor a kid. . .and make
sure the child is safe for a month,”
Harjani said.

A.C.T. is one of W&L’s new-
est campus organizations with the
goal of spreading awareness of
global human rights issues. The
group also conducts fundraisers
to donate money to national and
international nonproﬁt organiza-
tions that work on these issues.

The response to Guns and
Dolls Week from university ofﬁ-
cials and organizations has been
encouraging, according to Har-
jani.

Eleven university organiza-
tions, including MSA, SAIL,
the General Activities Board,
the Oﬂice of Student Activities
and Greek Life, Nabors Service
League, Amnesty lntemational
and ﬁve fraternities are co-spon-
sors of the concert.

A.C.T. also sponsored W&L’s
observation of the international
initiative Burma Day in October
to promote awareness of the mili-
tary action against peaceful pro-
testers in Southeast Asia.

A.C.T. will be selling T-shirts

and holding a rafﬂe, in addition
to collecting donations, Monday
through Thursday. Guns and
Dolls Week will culminate Thurs-
day evening with the screening of
a documentary entitled “Invisible
Children,” created by three South-
ern California college students af-
ter a visit to Uganda in 2003.

“It’s something that I think
is obviously a big service to the
university,” said Professor Tyler
Dickovick, assistant professor of
politics at W&L. “It’s great that
we have organizations like this on
campus that are raising awareness
about areas of the world that we
don’t hear much about.”

Dickovick will introduce the
ﬁlm, which will be followed by
a question and answer session led
by Ugandan citizen and W&L ju-
nior Allan Kisoma.

“We just thought it’d be a
great opportunity to get people to
listen to our music and also sup-
port a really good cause,” said
sophomore Joel Poelhuis, bassist
for the band Agent Flynn.

“I just think that not a lot of
people know where Uganda is on
a map,” Poelhuis said. “I know I
don’t. This event will be great for
raising awareness.”

Harjani echoed Poelhuis’ sen-
timents, saying that he looks for-
ward to getting the W&L commu-
nity involved with future A.C.T.
events.

“We don’t only want to fund-
raise, we want people to realize
what the problem is,” Harjani said.
“We wanted to do something that
could make a difference.”

Fire on the stage

One acts provide some excitement, fun

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
STA F F W R I TE R

The One Acts were, quite liter-
ally, a ﬂaming success.

From the full house to the suc-
cessfully-handled ﬁre incident
caused by yours truly, the three
nights of performances were el-
egantly and artfully produced.

However, the appreciative au-
dience only saw the fruit of our
labors. What went on behind the
scenes, despite the lack of pyro-
technics, grants audiences a new
perspective.

Due to the shortened nature of
the plays themselves, we did not
have to endure the arduous sched-
ules characteristic of the theater.

Furthermore, the casts were
much smaller, sometimes boast-
ing as few as two actors. Saman-
tha Copping, who played the char-
acter of Alice in Rothko Room,
commented that “One Acts was
such a completely different the-
ater experience for me.

It was so much more intimate.
With only one other actor, a di-
rector and a stage manager pres-
ent at rehearsal and then the audi-
ence only a few feet away during
shows, you can’t help but feel
more connected with the entire
process.”

Indeed, with the small John-‘

son Theater as their stage, we
were able to speak to an audience
much like our cast, small and in-
timate. Kimber Wiggs, who acted
in the part of Mrs. Ballone in the
pithily titled play Mosquito, Diri-
gible, Aerosol Deodorant, echoed
Copping’s sentiments. As a new-
comer to the theater scene, Wiggs
felt that One Acts was a perfect

way to transition into the depart-
ment. “This was my ﬁrst experi-
ence with the theater department,
and I loved it, “ said Wiggs. “One
Acts were so much fun and laid
back that I didn’t mind the hours
and hours of practice. Plus, hav-
ing such a small cast meant we all
go to bond really quickly. It was
so much fun, and I loved getting
positive feedback from everyone
who came.”

Although we were able to note
the unique nature of the brief
plays, the One Acts present an-
other distinguishing feature to
the Washington and Lee com_-

kind of support can make amaz-
ing things happen.”

During all the performances,
it was evident that the combined
efforts of the directors, actors
and crew truly did make amazing
things happen. Opening night was
met with laughter and applause
while Friday night’s performance
yielded a packed house. Students
came to see their peers perform
on the Johnson Stage in droves on
that second night of performanc-
es. In addition to the full house,
friends and family were sitting in
the aisles and in any extra space
to be found.

“I knew that if I needed an opinon, an extra set

of hands, or even a shoulder to lean on, I had

four people therefor me. ’

munity. That is to say, the plays
were all student directed by the
majors of the department. The
student directors included Lauren
Sapikowski, Gabrielle de’Courcy,
Helen Coupe, Tabitha King and
Lisa Reppell.

Although their respective
works differed greatly in content,
the directors were bonded under
the banner of their artistic en-
deavors. Sapikowski, the director
of Rothko Room, said, “I think
that this year was a really strong
year for the One Acts in part be-
casue the directors worked well
together. I knew that if I needed
an opinon, an extra set of hands,
or even a shoulder to lean on, I
had four people there for me. That

They also endured an un-
planned yet hilarious accident in
the shape of a ﬂaming garbage
can. It seems that I, as Ms. Netty
of Mosquito, became a bit too
lighter friendly. I also did not pre-
dict that the garbage can, which
is usually free of all ﬂammable
objects, was packed with paper.
However, the stunt, for lack of
a better word, was greeted with
overwhelming ovation and laugh-
ter. Saturday night proved to be a
much safer success. Despite the
lack of Backdraft-esque special
effects, the audience was still in-
credibly receptive the humors and
emotions of each performance.

What a Win!

Women beat No. 3 Middlebury

By Russ Weems
smrr wmren

The eighth-ranked Generals played two games
this week against the third-ranked Middlebury Pan-
thers and the Catholic University Cardinals. The
Generals came into the week 8-1, winners of their
last four.

The Generals ‘started the week off against Mid-
dlebury. The Generals have only taken on one team
ranked as high as Middlebury and lost 4-7. When
the game began, the Panthers jumped out to a quick
lead, scoring the first two goals. W&L was not
fazed, however, and tied the score at 2-2. The game
stayed close for the rest of the ﬁrst half, with the
Generals scoring the last two goals to go in half with
a 4-3 lead.

After half, W&L came out strong. They domi-
nated the beginning of the second half, scoring the
ﬁrst four goals to take an 8-3 lead. This run, capped
off by Kat Michaels, put the Generals out of reach
for the Panthers. Even though the Panthers scored
three of the next four goals, they could come no
closer than three. The Generals had completed the
upset, 14-8.

This upset was led by some key individual per-
forrnances. The Generals were paced by senior at-
tacker Christine Bender’s career-high ﬁve goals.
Sophomore attacker Britten Mathews tallied three
goals and two assists, while junior midﬁelder Col-
leen Evans addedanother three goals. Junior attack-
er Kelsi Robinson contributed one goal and dished
out two assists. Senior Sarah Tilbor made 13 saves
in goal for W&L.

After their bring win to start off the week, the
Generals took on the Catholic University Cardinals.
The Generals started off quickly, taking the lead a
mere 10 seconds into the game when midﬁelder Col-
leen Evans scored off an assist from Kelsi Robinson.
However, Catholic responded quickly by scoring
with 25:04 left in the half. The ﬁrst half was closely
contested and featured three ties. When Catholic
tied it up with 3:33 to go, the Generals responded
with back-to-back goals from Christine Bender go-
ing into the half. At the break, the Generals led by
two, 7-5.

The second half started like the ﬁrst with the Gen-
erals getting a quick goal and the Cardinals respond-
ing with a goal of their own. This brought the score
to 8-6. The Generals then went on a run, scoring the
next three goals. Catholic again responded, scoring
3 of the next 4 to bring the score to 12-9. At this
point, W&L made a run that would put the Cardinals
away and decide the contest. The Generals scored
the next 4 goals capped off by a free position shot
by Katie Flippen with 8:47 left. Catholic scored a
couple of goals with a few minutes to go, but it was
too little too late. The game was capped off by a
goal with one second left from Megan Slosson, giv-
ing W&L a 17-11 victory.

The Generals had some strong individual perfor-
mances in the victory. They were led by junior at-
tacker Kelsi Robinson who scored 3 goals and added
5 assists in the win. Sophomore attacker Britten
Matthews scored a game high 4 goals. Colleen Ev-
ans, Christine Bender, and Megan Slosson also had
multiple goals. Senior. Sarah Tilbor played the entire
game in goal and recorded 10 saves.

W&L returns to action on Sunday when it travels
to Randolph-Macon for a 3 p.m. ODAC contest.

Doornbos sets top D-III mark

Billington and Sutherland set new marks in hammer throw and I 00 meter hurdles

By Kevln corn
STAFF WRITER

The track team spent the week-
end at Liberty University breaking
records and qualifying for the NCAA
tournament.

While at the two day, Asics Lib-
erty Invitational, junior Stacy Door-
nbos, sophomore Maggie Sutherland,
and sophomore Sallie Armstrong
completed the Heptathlon. Armstrong
took eighth, right behind sophomore.
Maggie Sutherland. Doornbos ﬁn-
ished third, only behind two competi-
tors from North Carolina. Doornbos’
score of 4,562 was the top score of
DIII competitors at the meet, as well
as a new school record, and astound-
ingly the top score now in the nation
for DIII. Needless to say, Doombos
easily qualiﬁed for NCAAS.

' “I was really excited about how
the meet went,” commented Door-
nbos. “Maggie Sutherland, Sallie
Armstrong and I all competed in the
Helptathlon (100 hurdles, high jump,

shot put, 200m, long jump, javalin,
and 800m) and were all able to im-

- prove our scores by a lot from what

we were scoring last year.” She con-
tinued, “it is really encouraging to see
that all the work we have been doing
in the various events is paying off. I
was also really excited because I was
able to qualify for nationals in the
Hep again this year.”

Junior Alysen Kuck also showed a
strong showing in the javelin and high
jump where she notched ﬁrst place in

both events by throwing 115’1” and .

jumping 1.53 meters. Meanwhile,
sophomore Dorothy Todd was a top
DIII ﬁnisher in the 1,500 meter run
after crossing the ﬁnish line in a time
of 5:01.48. Junior Elizabeth Webb
also had a great run in the 5000 after
ﬁnishing in a time of 17:55. Close be-
hind her was sophomore Kat Telfey-

. an who notched second among DIII

competitors in the same event with a
time of 18:31.

Webb described the emotions of
her run on Saturday. “I was extremely

pleased with my performance. I have
been trying to break 18 minutes in the
5k all season and I knew that this was
the meet where I needed to do it.”

Moreover, Webb expressed the
difﬁculty of the race: “The race was
one of the hardest I’ve ever run in my
life. I led wire to wire, so I was es-
sentially by myself, running into the
wind. But my teammates, coaches
and family kept me motivated for the
full 12 and half laps. I could not have
done it without them.”

The men also had a strong week-
end as junior Michael Welsh captured
ﬁrst place in the 5000 meter run with
a time of 15:47.62. Meanwhile, ju-
nior Vance Berry ﬁnished third in
the 1500 meter run with a time of
4:l2.52.Sophomore Ben Goetsch
was able to clear a height of 6’5” in
the high jump ~ good enough for a
ﬁrst place ﬁnish.

“I was very happy with my per-
formance,” commented Goetsch. He
shared: “6’5” was a personal best for
me and I got the opportunity to com-

pete with some very good division
one jumpers (including W&L assis-
tant coach Garrett Brickner, who also
jumped 6’5”).”

Junior Chip McCoy took ﬁfth in
the 400 meter hurdles after crossing
the ﬁnish line in a time of 4:12.52.
Then, sophomore Billy Billington
had an exceptional weekend after ﬁn-

ishing second in the discus throw with

a distance of l37’1” and then taking
third in the hammer throw while set-
ting a new school record of 143’11’.’.

Billington was all business when
asked about his performance. “I was
satisﬁed with my throws, but I know
I have a lot to improve on before
ODACs” he, said. “This weekend
gave me a good idea on where I stand
compared to other throwers in the
conference.”

The Generals will be back in ac-
tion at the beginning of Spring Break
when they travel to Lynchburg to
compete in the Lynchburg Track
Classic

Homestand not so sweet for baseball

Team goes I -3 durirzgfour-game homestand, drops to 7-6 in conference play

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington & Lee Men’s
Baseball team went 1-3 in the four-
game home stand this week.

The Generals came off of a tough
ﬁve-game road trip in which the team
ﬁnished 3-2, before coming back
home for four consecutive games.

W&L faced Bridgewater College
on Tuesday. The Eagles cracked the
scoreboard ﬁrst in the top of the ﬁrst
inning and added another run in the
second. The score was 2-0.

The Generals started off cold in
the contest, failing to score in the ﬁrst
three innings and only amassing one
hit. However, the Blue and White
broke out of the slump in the bottom
of the fourth. Senior captain James

Madden doubled to right ﬁeld and he .

eventually came around to score on a
Bridgewater error, making the score
2-1.

After the Eagles scored in the
ﬁrst two innings, they were unable to
score in the next three, but W&L con-
tinued to struggle offensively.

In the sixth inning, BC scored an-
other run on a string of singles and a
hit batsman. The Generals responded
in the second half of the inning with
two runs to tie the game at 3-3. Mad-
den led of the inning with another
double, Will Lewis singled and drove
in Madden, then Hunter Serenbetz
singled, and Tim Livingston drove in
Lewis to knot the game.

The tie game was short lived as
Bridgewater blew the game open in
the eighth inning with four runs on

four hits and an error. They added an
insurance run in the ninth, but W&L
could not answer and the game ended
9-3.

The next day, the Generals stepped
out of conference to play Southern
Virginia University.

This time, the Blue and White
opened up the scoring. W&L com-
piled ﬁve hits en route to a three run
ﬁrst inning, highlighted by a lead-
off triple to deep center by Terrence
McKelvey. The Knights answered in
the second with their ﬁrst run of the
game making the score 3-1.

The Generals followed the three
run inning in the ﬁrst with a ﬁve run
inning in the second. With the bases
loaded, sophomore Jim Plantholt
launched a shot that cleared the left-
ﬁeld fence for a grand slam.

“I was just looking for a good
pitch to drive,” said Plantholt. “In my
ﬁrst at bat, I was a little out in front of
the ball so I was trying to stay back
and hit it hard. The pitcher threw me
a fast ball and I put a good swing on
the ball.”

W&L had a commanding 8-1 lead
through two innings.

The Generals continued their hot
streak in the third inning by add-
ing two more runs on back-to-back
doubles by Dan Harris and Anthony
Cardona.

The Blue and White subsequently
exploded in the fourth inning. The
team scored a staggering nine runs,
while batting through the lineup. The
inning was capped off with another
homerun to leftﬁeld by Plantholt.

“Before my second homerun, I
was looking for the pitcher to throw
mostly curveballs, but instead he
gave me a fast ball and again I just
wanted to put a good swing on the
ball,” said Plantholt. “I was seeing
the ball reallyjwell and was able to
pick up his pitches early - just look-
ing to hit a good pitch.”

The score was 19-1 and the game
was out of reach though it ended with
a 19-8 win by the Generals.

In the contest, Plantholt batted 3 A

for 6 with two homeruns and seven
RBIs. The two homeruns tie the
W&L record for homeruns in a game
and the seven RBIs tie the second
best RBI performance in a game.

“I’ve never been a power hit-
ter, just always looking to hit a line
drive,” said Plantholt after the record-
tying game. “It’s pretty awesome
having that [homerun] record. Now
until someone beats it, I’ll have my
name up there on the website which
is pretty cool.”

The Generals stepped back in con-
ference on Saturday to play a double-
header against Guilford College.

The game was scoreless through
the ﬁrst three and a half innings.
Neither team was able to capitalize
on their opportunities. In the bottom
of the fourth, W&L ﬁnally took ad-
vantage. Serenbetz led off the inning
with a single, followed by a single
from Plantholt, Livingston moved the
runners over to third and second base,
and Byron Peyster hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy
to centerﬁeld that drove in Serenbetz
to give the Generals the 1-0 lead.

Guilford answered in the sixth inning
with a lead off homerun to center to
deadlock the game at 1-1.

Both teams broke out in the sev-
enth inning. Guildford started out
with three runs on two hits and an er-
ror, giving them the 4-1 lead. W&L
countered with two runs on three
hits in the bottom half, but it wasn’t
enough in the shortened game be-
cause of the doubleheader. The ﬁnal
score was 4-3. ~

Guilford and W&L continued
their hot streak from the seventh in-
ning to the start of the second game
of the day.

The Quakers had a fast start
right from the gate, scoring ﬁve runs
in the top of the ﬁrst on four hits and
two costly errors. This put the Gener-
als in a quick 5-0 hole. W&L chipped
away at the lead in the bottom of the
ﬁrst, narrowing the score to 5-2.

Guilford added another run in the
third. In the fourth, Serenbetz added
in some heroics with a solo homerun
to right-centerﬁeld. The score was
6-3. W&L continued to crawl back
in the next inning by adding another
run. However, the Quakers widened
the margin in the sixth with two runs,
pushing the score out to 8-4.

The Generals rallied in the sev-
enth on three singles by Peyster,
McKelvey, John Ditore and a double
by Madden. The score was cut to 8-6,
but that was as close as it would get
as neither team scored the rest of the
way.

The W&L Baseball team is now
16-8 overall and 7-6 in conference.

G Fab Five competition no match for Women’s tennis

Team goes 6-0 on the week, defeating ﬁve nationally-ranked teams and running its undefeated record to 1 8-0

By Mlchael Keenan
sponrs EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team remained
perfect for the season by tallying
six wins this week, ﬁve coming
at the Fab Five Tournament. The
General’s defended their number
one ranking by defeating their op-
ponents by a combined score of
49-5, blanking four of them 9-0.

. The Generals started off the

week by knocking off ﬁfteenth-
ranked Wellesley College, 8-1.
The Generals swept the double
competition and then took ﬁve of
six in the singles portion. Sopho-

more Lauren Caire teamed with
junior Katie Tabb to win no. one
doubles 8-2 over Jenna Mezin and
Hali Walther and then knocked
off Meghan Stubblebine to win
no. three singles 6-4, 6-3.

Other double winners includ-
ed senior Leah Weston in No. 2
doubles and no. four singles and
senior Kelly Will at No. 3 doubles
and no. two singles.

On Wednesday, the Generals
took on thirteenth-ranked Gusta-
vus Adolphus and ODAC oppo-
nent Guilford.

The split squad made no dif-
ference as both teams were de-
feated 9-0. Tabb, Will, Caire, and

Weston were victorious in both
singles and doubles against Gus-
tavus Adolphus.

Seniors Katie Duncan, Rhodes
Proctor, and Lauren Cook as well
as sophomores Blair Brzeski, Ka-
tie Harris, and Lauren Dorsey all
recorded two wins against Guil-
ford as the Generals only dropped
three games the entire match.

On Thursday, third-ranked
Williams provided the stiffest
competition of the season for
the Generals. All three doubles
matches were tight. In No. 1
doubles, Tabb and Caire pulled
out an 8-6 victory over Alllison
Rottkamp and Grace Baljon. In

No. 2 doubles, Weston and fresh-
man Catherine Reed dropped the
tiebreak to lose 9-8 (7-5) to Cary
Gibson and Annie Schniedman,
but Will and freshman Virginia
Dickinson pulled out an 8-5 vic-
tory at No. 3 doubles to give the
Generals a 2-1 lead heading into
the singles competition.

Gibson and Baljon won ﬁrst
and second singles for the Ephs
and Lucry Marchese added a
victory at No. 3 singles to bring
Williams within one match of the
upset.

However, Spalitta knocked off
Rottkamp 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 at no. six
singles, Timmis rallied after los-

ing the ﬁrst set to defeat Reich 3-
6, 6-1, 6-3 at No. 5 singles, and
Weston sealed the win by knock-
ing off Ashley Parsons in a third
set tiebreak to win No. 4 singles
6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4).

On Friday, the General’s
blanked 25th-ranked Claremont.
Tabb and Caire teamed up to best
Lisa Steckmest and Stephanie
Hammond 8-4 in No. 1 doubles
and then Tabb knocked off Ham-
mond 6-4, 1-2, retired, in No.
1 doubles and Caire defeated
Steckrnest 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in No.
2 doubles. Will and Weston were
also double winners against Cla-
remont.

The Generals concluded the
Fab Five Tournament with an-
other 9-0 victory, this time against
30th-ranked Skidmore College.

Tabb and Caire again domi-
nated the top of the doubles and
singles competitions, teaming up
to win ﬁrst doubles and then tak-
ing ﬁrst and second singles.

Will, Dickinson, and Reed
also notched two victories on the
day for the Generals.

With the win, the Generals im-
proved to 18-0. The women will
put their undefeated record on the
line when they travel to Atlanta to
take on archrival Emory on April
16th. .

Sweet sets 50 freestyle record at NCAA championship

Team places eighth, tying highest ﬁnish ever, six swimmers win ﬁrst team All-American accolades

By Mlchael Keenan

0 SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee
men’s swimming team equaled its
highest ever ﬁnish of eighth place
and had its ﬁrst national cham-
pion since 1995 at the NCAA
Division III championships from
March 20-22.

On day one, senior Alex Sweet
broke twenty seconds for the ﬁrst
time by swimming 19.99 in the 50
freestyle prelims, edging out rival
Brad Test of Johns Hrmkins hv

0.04 seconds going into the ﬁnal
in the evening. Senior Tim Mc-
Glaston also made the champion-
ship heat in the event, swimming
a 20.58, the seventh best prelim
time. In the ﬁnals, Sweet dropped
his time by 0.14 seconds to 19.85,
the fastest ever in the Division
III NCAA championships. Mc-
Glaston also improved by swim-
ming 20.51, good enough for sev-
enth place. Sweet is W&L’s ﬁrst
swimming national champion
since Nathan Hottle won the 200

breast in 1995.

Also on day one was the 200
free relay. McGlaston and Sweet
teamed with junior Brett Tatman
and sophomore Brandon Bamds
to set a school record of 1:21.55
in the prelims. In the ﬁnals, Mc-
Glaston led off with a 20.48 to put
the Generals into third at the ﬁrst
exchange. However, the Generals
had fallen into last when Sweet
started his anchor leg. Sweet’s
split of 19.12 was fast enough to
catch four other teams and move

the Generals into fourth place.

On day two, Sweet led the way
with a ninth place ﬁnish in the
200 free in a school-record time
ofll 239.10. Junior Paul Crook ﬁn-
ished 11th in the same event in a
time of 1:40.82.

In "the nightcap, Sweet and
Crook teamed with McGlaston
and junior Chris Diebold to place
eighth in the 800 free relay. Swim-
ming the anchor leg, Sweet played
the hero again, making up a two
second deﬁcit to pass Emory and

ﬁnish in a time of 6:45.44.

Sweet completed his incred-
ible championship swims on day
three with a fourth place ﬁnish in
the 100 free.

Sweet ﬁnished the prelim in
44.51 to set a new school record
and then came back in the evening
with a time of 44.83, out-touching
Johns Hopkins’ Brad Test by six
hundredths of a second for fourth
place. McGlaston also competed
in the event, ﬁnishing 15th in a
time of 45.96.

The Generals concluded their
championship with a sixth place
ﬁnish in the 400 free relay. Sweet,
McGlaston, Crook, and Barnds
improved their preliminary time
by over a second and a half to
set a school record in a time of
3:02.53, two tenths of a second
ahead of New York University.

The ﬁnal relay was enough
to move W&L ahead of NYU to
ﬁnish alone in eighth place, tying
their highest ﬁnish ever.

Rugby loses elite eight
heartbreaker 13-9

The club rugby went on an unprecedented run
this spring, falling just a few yards short of the
rugby ﬁnal four in a 13-9 loss Sunday to Wid-
ener. Captain Sean McKinley said he and other
veterans never expected the team to go so deep
in the tournament, but he said the team caught
ﬁre behind the golden leg of Josh Prell, who went
4 of 5 on kicks in the ‘Sweet Sixteed, scoring 12
points and helping W&L pull out a 17-15 vic-
tory.

Prell provided all nine points in Sunday’s
loss, but the team was ultimately done in by its

son. See the full story on page 9.

Work vs. play

Groups spend spring break serving

and learning around the world

By Alllson chopln
N EWS EDITOR

In addition to the chance to relax in the sun and visit friends and family, this
past spring break also provided several unique opportunities for W&L students
to live and work with communities in need.

Members of Project Nicaragua, a student-run organization that aims to ed-
ucate American students about Nicaragua and create a bond between the two
cultures, traveled to the small community of Amparo, outside of Siuna in Nica-
ragua.

The trip was made possible by Bridges to Community, a national non-proﬁt
organization.

Junior Mallory Ruymann, who led the trip, explained that the students worked
alongside members of the community, completing activities such as cooking,
clearing ﬁelds and building latrines.

“Typically, we live with a family for a week in a remote location, usually on
the Atlantic coast, the poorest area of Nicaragua. We work with the family and
their community engaging in building projects, farming and learning about sus-
tainable development,” she said.

In living and working with the Nicaraguans, a primary goal of the trip was
to develop a cultural perspective. “The main idea is to meet the Nicaraguans and
understand what their lives are like,” said senior Keri Klein.

Ruymann also emphasized these “cross-cultural exchange activities.”

“Basically, it was a complete cultural immersion from which we were able to
learn things about Nicaragua not found in textbooks,” she said.

The students also spent time interacting with students from URRACAN, a
local university, so that they could “leam from people our own age about Nica-
ragua’s various economic and social problems,” explained Ruymann.

Members of the group plan—to4;se—their new cultural knowledge in order to
educate their fellow students. Ruymann said she would like to see more partici-
pation in the trip in future years. A slide show of the trip will be presented later
in the term.

“Project Nicaragua attempts to educate the campus in some way about the
importance of global citizenship,” Ruymann said.

Another group of students, representing Generals’ Christian Fellowship
(GCF), an inter-denominational Christian organization on campus, also partici-
pated in a service trip. They traveled to Bequia, a small Caribbean island that is
part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

Members of the group helped to build an apartment for a church so that the
church will be able to hire a pastor. The students were able to complete the walls
of the apartment during their trip. ‘

“It was really exciting because Bequia is still very old-fashioned in their
building methods. The only tools we had were trowels, shovels, and buckets.
[There was] no concrete mixer,” freshman Sarah Warsco said. ,

Like the members of Project Nicaragua, GCF members also had the opportu-
nity to learn about the unique culture of the community they visited.

“We were able to watch the ﬁshermen coming in with boats ﬁlled with ﬁsh
and even sharks,” said Warsco. “We were able to watch the whaling ship go out
everyday, and we even saw a game of cricket on TV.”

For Warsco, the cultural interaction was just as fulﬁlling as the physical labor
that the group completed.

“It was amazing to spend so much time with the locals and to learn about their
culture,” she summarized.

New restaurant on its way to Lex

New restaurant plans to open this summer in historic Wilson— Walker house

By Jordan Mcconnel
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students and Lexington resi-
dents will soon have a new place
to dine from early in the mom-
ing to late into the night. Better
yet, the new restaurant, which is
planned to offer a contemporary
feel and menu, will also reflect
the historic roots and culture‘ of
Lexington.

At least that’s the hope of
Roanoke restaurateur Richard
Macher, who plans to open a
Macado’s restaurant in the for-
mer Wilson-Walker House, 30
N. Main St., late this summer.

The space has been empty
since Wilson-Walker house
closed its doors more than two
years ago.

Macher says that this restau-
rant, like the other 14 Macado’s
he owns and operates, will offer
a modern ﬂair while also draw-
ing on local culture. He calls this

unique feel “funky metro.”

“We’re going for a little bit
more of a modern look,” Macher
said. “We want people to feel the
energy of it.” Chris Lumpkin, the
decorator of the new Macado’s,
said they are going for the “old
feel with the new thing.”

Macher plans to maintain the
integrity of the Wilson-Walker
House, which was built in 1820
and is included in the Historic
American Buildings Survey.

Macher said he has been ap-
proved by the Virginia Depart-
ment of Historic Resources,
which grants federal and state
tax credits for rehabilitated his-
torical buildings.

“We’ve hired a historical ar-
chitect,” he said. Macher said
he also plans to “eBay anything
‘Lexingtonish”’ to enhance the
local ﬂavor of the restaurant.

So far, Macher has already
torn down a wall on the main
ﬂoor that was added in the
1980s. He said the wall broke up

the space of the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

“One of the challenges was
the rooms were too small,” Ma-
cher said. “I want it to be fun, not
cubbyholeish.”

In the space where the wall
was removed, Macher plans
to put an L-shaped bar with a

sandwiches, Macado’s will also
serve appetizers, soups, salads,
entrees and desserts.

“We cater to everybody,” Ma-
cher said. “We have kids’ night,
quick lunch and localized deliv-
ery.”

In addition to its assorted

“We ’re going for a little bit more of a
modern look. We want people to feel the

energy of it. ”

back-lit glass display case. On
the main ﬂoor, there will also be
a retail area, and both high- and
low-topped tables. Seating will
also be available upstairs and on
the two front porches.

Macado’s will offer a varied
menu that will suit all types of
people. Although famous for its

menu, Macado’s hours are
unique. It will open at 8 a.m. all
days of the week and close at 12
am. Sunday through Thursday
and 2 a.m. on Friday and Satur-
day, providing the perfect place
for both early-risers and students
with late night munchies.
Despite these competitive

hours and varied menu, local
business owners and managers
don’t seem to be concerned about
the opening of a new restaurant.
Mike Gregg, who owns and op-
erates the Blue Sky Bakery with
his wife Brenda, doesn’t think
the opening of Macado’s will af-
fect his business.

“People come here because
of the speed,” Gregg said. “Peo-
ple that go somewhere like that
expect table service.”

Kelly Pate, a manager at the
Palms, said their business may
be affected initially, but in the
long run, the Palms will be ﬁne.

“With any new business, in
the beginning, everyone’s going
to go, but we’ve been here since
’75,” Pate said.

Macher, who lives in Roa-
noke, is planning on coming up
every couple of weeks to check
on the restaurant. He also plans
to have a general manager from
another Macado’s come and look
over the new restaurant.

Fellowships roll in

Although Washington and
Lee is notorious for its thriv-
ing Greek scene and party
atmosphere, recent student
achievements prove that W&L
students also know how to
work as hard as they play.

Need proof? Look no far-
ther than the list of fellowships
that students are piling up. This
year, a Watson fellowship was
awarded to Mary Childs, a se-
nior business journalism ma-
jor, for her project titled “The
Eye of the Beholder: The Car-
tography of Faces,” a study of
the inﬂuence of environment
on human facial structure.

The Watson Fellowship is
a very competitive research
grant of $25,000 that is given
annually to 50 students from
private liberal arts schools
nationwide. As a Watson fel-
low, Childs will travel abroad
to work in France, the United
Arab Emirates, Japan, China,
Brazil and Morocco.

W&L has now won four
fellowships in the last three

years. Ben Long is currently
abroad studying cattle_ fann-
ing on the Watson Fellow-
ship. Wheeler Sparks studied
music around the world after
his graduation in 2006. He
travelled to several different
countries to study different
music styles and write his own
songs. That same year, Adam
Jarzyk traveled throughout
southeast Asia studying the
region’s cuisine.

According to the Watson
fellowship website, the pro-
gram is designed to “to offer
college graduates of unusual
promise a year of indepen-
dent, purposeful exploration
and travel outside of the Unit-
ed States in order to enhance
their capacity for resourceful-
ness, imagination, openness,
and leadership and to foster
their humane and effective
participation in the world
community.”

Childs won’t be the only
graduate heading abroad. Se-
nior Emma Axt won a Ful-
bright Scholarship to teach
English in France.

Recently, senior Drew Mc-
Way was also awarded a grant
from 100 Projects for Peace,
an organization that, accord-
ing to the W&L website, “in-
vites undergraduate students
to submit [project propos-
als that enhance] the idea of
world peace.” '

Mcway, an accounting and
business administration major
from the class of 2008, plans
to travel to Northern Peru,
where he will work with a
small microﬁnance group
called Sinergia, an organiza-
tion that “loans money to fe-
males who dream of owning
their own business” and has
“successfully issued loans to
over 100 women in the pov-
erty-stricken Wachanzao bar-
rio in northern Peru.”

Although many national
academic awards are given
to undergraduate juniors and
seniors, the hard work of un-
derclassmen does not go un-
noticed. This year, for his ac-
complishments in the study of
physics, sophomore Joseph
McDonald was awarded the

prestigious Goldwater Schol-
arship, an honor given to only
321 students nationwide.

Goldwater Scholarships
are awarded to students who
excel in mathematics, engi-
neering and natural sciences.
They were created to encour-
age American students to
study these subjects.

Not to be outdone, a pair
of freshmen also got into the
act by being named Kemper
Scholars. W&L has had one
Kemper Scholar each of the
last three years, but this year
the committee chose both
Eric Hamscher and Cheng-
peng Mou. Kemper Scholars
receive ﬁnancial aid for the
rest of their college career and
participate in two internships.
The foundation awards schol-
arships to students at liberal
arts institutions nationwide.

More information about
recent academic awards, as
well as instructions on how
to apply for scholarships and
grants, can be found online at
the W&L website.

Who is Barack Obama?

Please use your ace orator skills to answer questions

By Abel Delgado
c 0 Lu M N l sr

Dear Senator and Future Crowned Presi-
dent Obama,

I like your words. As a college student and
young ﬁrst-time voter, I have learned that I am
required to vote for_you according to the laws
established by polls, punditry, and physics. I

«certainly cannot protest.

After all, I like the idea of being “an agent
of change,” and the word change appears just
about everywhere you go. I’m beginning to
think the word should be part of your oﬂicial
name. Barack “Change” Obama has a nice
ring to it, doesn’t it? -

I’m surprised we haven’t skipped this
whole messy primary and general election
process and just made you president already
because everyone I know is pro—change. And
what type of change-agent will I be if I don’t
blindly follow the hordes of people ﬂocking to
your campaign and voting for you? Not a very
good one, I presume.

But before I give you my vote, I’d like to
humbly ask you a few questions.

We all know you were born to be presi-
dent. As even the Republican Senator Mitch
McConnell is willing to admit, your current
opponent is a New York Senator born in 11-
linois and you are an Illinois Senator born in
a manger. So my question is, what took you
so long? Shouldn’t you have come to promi-
nence in your early 30s?

You say your time living abroad during
childhood gives you the experience needed to
make sound foreign policy decisions. I will be
studying abroad this year. By your reasoning,
do you think if I win a seat in the House of
Representatives at 25, I can chair the Foreign
Relations Committee based on the deep expe-
riences I gained while abroad?

You have been called a post-partisan re-
former but I have been unable to ﬁnd much, if
any, reform bills you sponsored or supported
either in the Illinois Senate or the U.S. Senate.

I’m sure you wouldn’t dare promote yourself
as a reformer without actually reforming any-
thing. I’m guessing there is a vast right wing
conspiracy led by Hillary Clinton to erase all
records of you taking down the special in-
terests and promoting government reform,
right?

As for the post-partisan title, you surely
cannot mean moving beyond the Democratic
Party as well as the Republican Party. Your

of the past two presidential

our Country to.

publicans, as you have with measures promot-
ed by the bi-partisan “Gang of l4.”

Your voting record this past year ranks to
the left of every other senator, so I’m guessing
by post-partisan, you just mean you want to do
away with the two party system and move to
a post-partisan one party system where every-
one agrees with you. Clearly, Republican par-
tisanship or bi-partisanship efforts from either
party do not suit you, so why not do away with
it? Now that would be change!

You have said you’re willing to meet other

foreign leaders, even those who are homi-
cidal dictators. Very brave of you! You say by
speaking to them we can solve the problems
that isolating them cannot solve.

Obviously this must be due to your stellar
speaking skills. Do you think you could have
used those speaking skills to convince Stalin
not to kill millions of people? If so, I’ll get
working on my Obama time machine right
away.

I truly believe you offer a level of hope to
this country that cannot be found elsewhere.
Telling our generals and soldiers we’re in a
war that we already lost and telling consumers
and investors that we are in a deep recession
is exactly the positive message that will move
our country forward.

Hearing you speak is almost a religious
experience, but, as you so artfully stated, re-
ligion is what bitter people cling to. Should I
completely stop ﬁnding hope in religion and
just cling to your campaign instead? I don’t
want to end up bitter.

Last, I have a few questions regarding
your concept of change. Change from what
is pretty obvious. We all know you intend to
be a welcome change from the mistakes and
divisiveness of the past two presidential ad-
ministrations. Considering the unpopularity
of the current Bush administration, running as
change from it would do much to explain your
poll numbers.

What is not explained, however, is what
exactly you intend to change our country to.
Your voting record is rather anemic, consider-
ing your brevity of stay in Congress and your
long absences to hit the campaign trail. You
speak in beautiful generalities and when you
are pushed for speciﬁcs you offer the same ri-
diculous, statist plans that the left has offered
for decades. Surely you don’t mean this is
change, and surely you are too smart to believe
these plans will actually work. If I’m confused
about what change you offer, I guess I’m con-
fused about you. I guess my ﬁnal question is,
who are you?

Neighborly support

Hanging out with homeless people over Spring Break

     

Did you hear?

What the newsletters didn ’t mention

Alumni, welcome back to campus! President Ruscio, the faculty and the alumni office will
tell everyone how smoothly life is going on campus.

In all likelihood, the administration won’t mention the exciting winter term we just en-
joyed. ‘

One fraternity was suspended for hazing pledges, and another put a high school senior in
the hospital after a special tequila party for honors scholar candidates. A Trident colunm led
to special Media Board and EC hearings. A female student sent out a list of sorority members
who were supposedly “DTF” (ask a student if you want to know what that stands for).

Yes, this winter was not exactly W&L’s ﬁnest hour. But these incidents did more than
prove that college students are occasionally guilty of bad judgment. They illustrated some
deeper problems on this campus.

The last few years have hardly been banner times for the fraternity system. Two houses
have been suspended from campus for hazing. Kappa Sig was sent packing by its national
organization, while the W&L Student Affairs Committee gave SAE the boot.

Beyond these suspensions, several more houses have faced hazing investigations from
either the school or national organizations in the last two years.

Tear night was such a mess that the Interfratemity Council and Panhellenic Council, in
cooperation with the student affairs staff, decided to form a Greek Vision council to look at
the problems in our Greek system.

Those problems extend beyond hazing to high rates of sexual assault, high use of Plan
B emergency contraceptive after major party weekends along with violent and belligerent
behavior towards Traveller drivers.

The “bracket” column in the Trident has also raised a host of problems. Everyone agrees
that the colunm was crude, offensive and inappropriate. But the aftermath has been equally
disturbing.

Before this incident, few people realized that the Executive Committee has the power to
discipline student press organizations by removing funding, oﬂice space or even the right to
use the words “Washington and Lee” on the masthead.

Essentially, the government is allowed to punish the organizations charged with covering
it. The First Amendment is an idea that faculty and the student government love to talk about
in the classroom, but it’s not an idea they endorse in practice. Some professors were furious
that the writers and editor weren’t forced to resign or severely punished by the school.

And, last but not least, the list. Leaving aside the fact that a student actually thought it was
a good idea to send out a list of sorority sisters who she thought would be willing to perform
certain sexual acts, the oﬁicial response was equally ham-handed.

The school went after students who received and forwarded the e-mail, accusing them of
participating in sexual harassment.

That’s simply ridiculous. The person guilty of harassment is the list’s author. Yes, it would
have been nice if students didn’t forward the e-mail, but threatening suspensions for students
who saw the e-mail is way out of line.

Yep, things are just great here at W&L these days, at least on the days when students,
faculty and administrators manage not to act crazy.

Enjoy your visit, and just nod along when someone tells you everything is going great.

Everyone has encountered the
homeless. Whether it was hand-
ing out food in a soup kitchen or
walking down the street in a city,
we have all seen the faces of the
homeless.

My guess is that few Wash-
ington and Lee students have
truly known the homeless. In
other words, few have had genu-
ine relationships with the home-
less. Knowing someone who is
homeless completely changes
one’s outlook on our society and
how we confront the problem of
homelessness.

Ten other W&L students and
I spent the week at Urban Min-
istry Center, which serves people
facing homelessness and poverty
for the Alternative Spring Break.
UMC’s mission is to address peo-
ple’s needs with love, compas-
sion and tangible help. The ﬁrst
day we arrived, we were told how
much UMC values relationships.
The staff believes that relation-
ship building is key to moving in-
dividuals out of homelessness.

This really was reﬂected in the
activities the staff organized for

us over the week. We did a few
things to help the center—serving
drinks, sorting the mail, helping
in the kitchen, etc— but.most of
the time, we just hung out and got
to know the neighbors, the people
whom the UMC serves.

We ate lunch, watched a movie,
went on a walk, painted, just sat
around talking and my personal
favorite -- played soccer with the
neighbors. They were fabulous.
The neighbors welcomed us with
open arms and we quickly made
unforgettable friends that we are
still in contact with today.

I was shocked at the pure joy
and cheerfulness that many of
them possessed in their everyday
demeanor. In spite of their current
situation, Patrick and Eddie, for
example, always had on smiles
that would light up anyone’s day.

We discovered how much pure
talent there was at the center. The
choir was absolutely amazing, the
art program featured artists whose
work could easily sell at any fan-
cy art gallery and the soccer team
had many talented players.

While the programs at UMC
may seem to be unusual for a cen-
ter dedicated to helping the home-

less, the innovative programs are
truly effective in engaging the
neighbors, rekindling motivation,
providing them with a productive
outlet and developing life skills
needed to help them transition to
the next step in life.

To date, sales from the art
shows have grossed almost
$50,000. Part of this money goes
to the artists themselves and part
goes back into the art program.
For the past three years, the Street
Soccer 945 team has represented
the U.S. at the Homeless World
Cup. Seventy-ﬁve percent of
team members have moved off
the streets, a clear indication of
success.

As I am sure my ﬁ'iends who
went on the trip will also attest,
our experiences in Charlotte were
amazing. I can only hope that
more W&L students will be able to
visit the UMC and similar places
in the future so they too can build
relationships with the homeless. I
only wish our policymakers could
have the same experience we had.
If they did, homelessness would
certainly become a priority for
our nation.

While many students stocked
up on sunscreen and packed car-
ry—on luggage to celebrate spring
beark at the beach, sophomore
Kimber Wiggs had a different
destination in mind: Turkey.

This year, Wiggs joined 26
other Washington and Lee upper-
classmen as part of the University
Chamber Singers’ biennial spring
concert tour.

“It was really cool because
we got to meet Turkish college
students and hang out with them a
little bit,” said Wiggs. The group
performed all across the country
— which straddles the border be-
tween Eastern Europe and Asia
— including a major television
performance and stints at two
major university concert halls.

Since 1974, the Chamber Sing-
ers has traveled across the globe

. to perform under the direction of

its conductor, Professor Gordon
Spice of the Music Department.
After 18 concert tours outside the
United States, this trip marked
the last for Spice, who will step
down as conductor for the group
at the end of the academic year.

This spring’s trip began in An-
kara, Turkey’s capital, where the
group appeared on what Wiggs
called “the Turkish equivalent of
‘Good Morning America. ’”

After a successful television
performance, the Chamber Sing-
ers participated in a music work-
shop with students from Gazi
University, exchanging sheet
music and breaking the language
barrier through song.

In addition to traditional jazz
and spiritual American songs, the
Chamber Singers’ repertoire also
included pieces from the Czech
Republic, Latvia, and Zambia,
among others.

“We knew this one Turkish

song,” Wiggs said of a piece en-
titled “Suda Balik Oynuyor,” that
was very well received by all the
individuals the group sang for.
The group even received requests
for an encore of the song after an
impromptu performance at a res-
taurant.

“I don’t think, when we were
learning it, werealized how big a
success it would be,” Wiggs said.
“To have a foreign group learn
a song in their language really
meant a lot to them.”

Spice shared the student’s sen-
timent and appreciated the warm
reception that Turkey gave this
group of W&L performers.

“It just felt really good to be
an American in Turkey,” Spice
added. He admired the country’s
outstanding music venues, large
enthusiastic audiences, not to
mention the particular “delights
of Turkish cuisine.”

The Chamber Singers is an en-

semble of W&L upperclassmen
that must audition for the group ’s
select spots and frequently partic-
ipate in University Chorus during
their freshman year.

Spice described the group as
one that performs a different kind
of repertoire, often blending chal-
lenging pieces from a variety of
eras.

The group spent the week
touring several major cities in
Turkey, ultimately winding up in
Istanbul for a performance at the
city’s Caddebostan Cultural Cen-
ter, a professional music hall that
seats 775.

“The city has so much to offer
in terms of history and culture,”
senior Nikki Conkling said of Is-
tanbul. Turkey’s ‘culturally rich
city has earned it recognition
from the European Union as the
European Capital of Culture for
2010. i

This trip marked Conkling’s

 
  
 

second trip abroad with the
Chamber Singers. During her
sophomore year, she traveled
with the group to South America,
performing at various locales in
Uruguay and Argentina. Conk-
ling, who graduates this June, has
fond memories from her intema-
tional experiences at W&L.

“[The school] has given me
the opportunity to go places I
wouldn’t really think of visiting,”
she said.

In addition to the concert
tours, Conkling also spent the
Spring Term of her junior year
studying and producing art for six
weeks in Italy.

Conkling said that one of the
most rewarding things about her
experience this year in Turkey
was the cultural exchange that
took place between her fellow
Americans and the many citizens
and students of T urkey.

She even came away with

Spice’s last tour with the
Chamber Singers ended with a
moonlit performance on the roof-
top of a restaurant overlooking
the Bosporus, the strait that forms
the boundary between Turkey’s
Asian and European regions.

“It was just a great closing
moment to this particular tour,
and for me, for a part of my life,”
Spice said.

Spice said that while the
Chamber Singers will look ahead
to other trips in the future, he will
look back on his years as conduc-
tor with an appreciation for be-
ing able to lead a group of young
people as representatives of the
university, as well as the entire
United States.

Despite the bittersweet tone of
this particular tour, Spice was all
smiles.

The members of the Washington and
Lee University Wind Ensemble spent their
spring break in Egypt, earning the title of
Musical Ambassadors. Indeed, spending
time in the surreal setting allowed these
students to see the world from a differ-
ent perspective. A musician who toured
in Egypt, Hannah Muther said, “I really
appreciated the opportunity to visit a less
popular American tourist country and to
share the talents of the W&L Wind En-
semble with people from a very different
cultural background.”

They observed how music unites peo-
ple. Each culture has a unique way to ap-
preciate all forms of art. The similarities
assured the Wind Ensemble that their tal-
ent did not go wasted. Muther observed,
“Playing our last concert at a park in Cairo
showed the group how music can bring
people together, as cliche’ as that may
sound. Everyone seemed joyful to hear us,
especially the children, and even though
we couldn’t communicate very well, many
of the audience members came up to us af-
terwards and said thanks and even tried to
practice their English.”

Yet music was not the only thing on
their minds. Obviously, their eyes could
not help but wander off the music and

onto the spectacular sights. While visiting
the Nile and the ancient pyramids, these
musicians discovered a gem quite hidden
to members of the Western culture and the
privileged microcosm of our school.

Clark Simcoe, a freshman who went
on the trip, commented, “To ﬁnally see the
sights of Egypt in person and not through
a television screen or textbook gave me a
unique feeling of awe and amazement.”

Fowler Martens, another freshman
member of the Ensemble, echoes Sim-
coe’s sentiments: “It’s one of those things
that, no matter how many times you see
the temples and pyramids in pictures, they
still take your breath away when you see
them!” Thus, it seems that Wind Ensemble
did not only enrich the culture, but learned
from it as well.

In between concerts, the students were
able to tour these marvelous attractions.
“My favorite part of the trip was our three
day cruise down the Nile. And my most
memorable experience was getting lost
in an Egyptian bazaar”, shares Simcoe.
Closer to land, the Wind Ensemble toured
several of the remnants of ancient culture.
Muther admitted, “Seeing the ancient won-
ders like the pyramids and the Valley of
the Kings and riding a camel were all un-
forgettable experiences, and I was amazed
by the [number] of  temples remaining

from over two—thousand years ago.”

Martens also commented on the sur-
prisingly well-preserved sights: “It’s so
overwhelming to realize how sophisticated
the architecture must be to have survived
this long.”

By traveling to such an exotic loca-
tion, the members of the University Wind
Ensemble began to lend thought to study-
ing abroad. Some felt that they could
learn more outside of the Western culture.
Muther revealed her own opinions regard-
ing the international learning programs in
saying, “Visiting Egypt opened my eyes to
the merits of studying abroad in countries
outside of Europe, although I was sur-
prised by how accessible the country was
for tourists.”

While the students were denied the
pleasures of Destin, the luxury of Europe
or even the familiarity of home, they were
rewarded with a once in a lifetime oppor-
tunity.

They saw this tour as a gift and as a
chance to explore a world only known in
movies and books.

Simcoe said it best: “The only down-
side of the trip was the amount of ﬂying,
but even with that, I can say without res-
ervation I am glad I went. I could not have
wished for anything more out of the my
ﬁrst spring break at W&L.”

Team breaks 8 team and meet
marks at ODAC championship

By Kevln Corn
smrr wrmen

Washington and Lee’s track and
ﬁeld teams kept quite busy over Spring
Break with ODACs on the last weekend
of the break. The men’s team ﬁnished
3"‘ of six teams, while the women cap-
tured 2”“ out of six teams. The Gener-
als set ﬁve school records, three cham-
pionship meet records, and had four
ODAC champions. The teams captured
twelve All-ODAC citations with junior
Stacy Doornbos being awarded Track
and Field Athlete of the Year, junior
Elizabeth Webb being named Scholar-
Athlete of the Year, and Head Coach
Nate Hoey being named Coach of the
Year for the Women’s team.

The women were led to their great
ﬁnish with help from Doombos who
won the high jump with a leap of 5’3”,
ﬁnishing second in both the long jump
with a distance of 17’1l.75” and sec-
ond in the 100 meters hurdles with a
time of 15.75, and taking third in the
400 meters race with a time of 59.30.

“1 was really happy with how the
ODAC meet went,” commented Door-
nbos. “I was chosen as Athlete of the
Meet for the ODAC which was a huge
honor and was very exciting.”

Junior Becca Taylor set a school
record in the steeple chase after cross-
ing the ﬁnish line in a time of 11:59,
good for second, and then proceeded
to take third in the l500meters with
a time of 4:53.49. Junior Grace An-
drews placed in three events including
third in shot put with a throw of 10.79
and a ﬁfth place ﬁnish in the hammer
throw where her toss of 33.02 set a new
school record.

Sophomores Kat Telfeyan and Dor-

othy Todd all had strong ﬁnishes in the

top ﬁve of their events, while junior
Alysen Kuck took third in the javelin
after a throw of 33.92 meters. Junior
Stephanie Stelter took third in the 400
hurdles with a time of 67.17, while
sophomore Sallie Armstrong ﬁnished
fourth in the same event with a time of
68.36. Sophomore Maggie Sutherland
took second in the high jump with a
height of 1.57‘and third in 100 hurdles
with a time of 15.95.

Lastly, Webb captured the gold
in both the 1500 meters with a time
of 4:44.90 and in the 800 with a time
2:18.15. Junior Jess Shaw was ﬁrst to
cross the ﬁnish line in the 5K with a
time of 17.29, setting a school record, a

the 5K with a time of 15:33.54.

Jackson commented, “Coming in

third in the steeplechase was a great
way to cap the season.” He continued,
“Being able to make a difference in the
newest event in the conference was
huge when it came down to how the
team did as a whole.”

Sophomore Billy Billington threw
13.87 in the shot put for second place.

In the discuss throw, Billington threw a

41.33 - good enough for second, and
took third in the hammer throw with
a distance of 47.68 which also set a
school record in the event. Senior Mi-
chael Keenan ﬁnished second in the
javelin after throwing a distance of
51.87, setting a new school record.

Todd offered a comment on the
team’s overall success at ODACs, say-
ing, “Our ODAC meet was a wonder-
ful way to wrap up a great season. We
have been working toward the ODAC
meet all season.” She continued, “All
of the girls on the team stepped it up
and really rose to the occasion. We
had so many PR performances at the
ODAC meet! I think we surprised
everyone with how close we were to
Roanoke!”

Sophomore Brian Bondurant
agreed, “The team’s performance was
exactly what we had hoped for and I
was very excited for us to escape with
the 3rd place overall position as a team,
beating Roanoke by just a few points.”

Andrews commented, “I was so
proud of both the teams. It was great to
do so well overall, as a team. The best
part of the team this year was the new
additions. The new blood was refresh-
ing; they all greatly added to the team,
both athletically and personally.”

Last Saturday, Shaw, Webb, and
Berry all ran in Hillsdale, Michigan.
Berry ran the 5000 meters in a ‘time
of 15.42, while Webb ran a personal
best time of 17:48.41 in the 5000 me-
ters, which placed her 20"‘ overall in
the event. Shaw ran the same event
and crossed the ﬁnish line with a new
school record and National Qualify-
ing time of 17:15.57. This time makes
Shaw the sixth fastest in the nation for
DIII.

“It was an insane experience,” re-
ported Shaw. “I have never competed
in a more exciting race. Running un-
der the lights was exhilarating, and
my adrenaline was full force the entire
time.”

Webb added, “I’m pleased with my

Golf shoots for NCAAs

James captures individual title; team wins ODAC championship
for ﬁrst time since 1999 andﬁrst trip to NCAAS since 1991

By Michael Keenan
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee University
men’s golf team claimed its ﬁrst ODAC
Championship of the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury and its eleventh all-time at the league
championship held April 19-21 at the Pop-
lar Grove Golf Club in Amherst, Va. The
Generals jumped out to a lead on day one
and never looked back en route to the title
and automatic birth to the NCAA touma-
ment. Senior Nathaniel James led the way
for the Generals, ﬁnishing as the individual
medalist.

Coming into the tournament, the Gen-
erals were seeded second with an average
of 302.4, 2.6 shots behind tvvelfth-ranked
Guildford, and 2 shots ahead of third seed
Hampden-Sydney. James’s 72.2 stroke per
average was the best in the conference,
more than two shots ahead of Bridewater’s
Colton Ray and Guilford’s Peter Latimore.

The Generals were the dominant team
from day one. On opening day, the Generals
shot a 302 to open an eight shot lead over
second place Hampden-Sydney. Guilford
sat in fourth after shooting 321 in the open-

ing round; James and teammate sophomore
Matt Langan led the way, shooting rounds
of 75, which put them in a three-way tie
for second with Hampden-Sydney’s Bob
Boykin, just three strokes back of Ran-
dolph-Macon’s Ralston King. Sophomores
Brad Watts and Joe Gibson each shot a 76
and freshman Tim Gavrich ﬁnished with a
79.

W&L continued its superb play in the
second round, ﬁring a 294 to extend its lead.
Pre-toumament favorite Guilford found its
groove, shooting a 303 to move into second
place, but still remained 28 shots behind
the Generals with only one round to play.
James again led the way with a tournament
low round of 70 to take the individual lead
by one stroke over King. Watts shot a 72
to move into third place and Langan’s 76
moved him into a tie for ﬁfth. Gibson was
just one stroke behind Langan after shoot-
ing a second round of 76.

Though day three was plagued with poor
conditions, the Generals held of a strong
charge by Guilford to win the tournament
by ten strokes. The Generals shot a round
of 313, which brought their three day total
to 909. Guildford’s 295 closed the gap by

eighteen strokes but was not enough for
the Quakers to defend their title. Hampden-
Sydney ﬁnished in third with 929 strokes.
Watt’s ﬁnal round score of 76 led the way
for the Generals and moved him into a tie
for second place overall. James shot a 77 to
ﬁnish with a toumament-best score of 222,
just six shots over par.

The Generals returned home with nu-
merous pieces of hardware in addition to
the championship trophy. In addition to
being the individual medalists, James was

The women’s lacrosse team played in
the ODAC championship this week. The
Generals came into the contest having
won the last ﬁve ODAC titles. The Gen-
erals are undefeated in the conference this
year. W&L beat its opponent Roanoke
handily earlier in the season. The Gen-
erals were also the ﬁrst seed in the tour-
nament and currently ranked sixth place
in the country. The Generals would have
to overcome the pressure of being the fa-
vorite to capture their sixth straight title.
With the win, the Generals would receive
an automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA Tour-
nament and set a new program record for
wins in a season.

The Generals started the game looking
like champions. W&L opened the ﬁrst
half with seven unanswered goals, includ-
ing three from freshman midﬁelder Emily
Mathews. This initial barrage left Roa-

and Field Championships en route to being named Athlete of the Year.

Washington and Lee’s Women’s Ten-
nis Team has been quite busy the last few
weeks including the ODAC Tournament
and a very important match against Emory
University in Atlanta. However, despite
this busy and competitive schedule, the
Generals showed no fatigue. They remain
undefeated and number one in the country,
thus favored to win another NCAA title.
At Emory, the girls had a real battle with
the meet coming down to the last match
between junior Meg Splaitta and Emory’s
Sara Vrabec. Fortunately, Spalitta took the
match in two sets, 6-2, 7-6, with a 7-2 vic-
tory in the tie-breaker.

Junior Katie Tabb led the team with a
victory against Emory’s Tshema Nash in
two sets: 6-2, 7-5. She also teamed up with
sophomore Lauren Caire for an 8-4 victory
in their doubles match.

Splaitta’s victory tipped the meet in fa-
vor of W&L, 5-4.

Kelly Will, who defeated Emory’s Sa-
bra Rogers, explained what the team’s vic-
tory meant, “Beating a good team always
feels good and our wins over Williams and
Emory show that we are deﬁnitely in that
top 4 group. 5-4 is not a big margin and it
also shows how close all the top teams are.
We have a lot of close matches ahead.” She
added, “It gives us a sense of what we’ll

for the 2008 NCAA Tournament on Sun.,
May 4.

face and what we need to work on.”
Overall, Tabb commented, “The Emory
win was a big boost not only for us as a
team, but also for a lot of us as individu-
als. I think the wins gave us conﬁdence be-
cause we had to ﬁght for each of our wins,
and we ended up pulling out a lot of tough
matches.” She continued, “That kind of
win gives you a different mentality going
into your next match because it makes you
feel like anything is possible if you want it

Tabb explained that though the win may
appear to fans as a walk in the park, acute
concentration is needed to pull off a deci-
sive win.

“ODACS, even though they aren’t.the
best competition we face all year, are still
a good way for us to’ compete and make
sure that we’re ready for the upcoming
NCAA tournament,” said Tabb. “Despite
what people may think, it actually takes a
lot of focus to win an ODAC match 6-0,

“The Emory win was a big boost not only for us as a team,
but also for a lot of us as individuals. I think the wins gave
us conﬁdence because we had to ﬁght for each of our wins,

and we ended up pulling out a lot of tough matches. ”

bad enough.”

The Generals more recently completed
ODACS without losing a game throughout
the entire tournament. The ladies took down
Guilford 7-0 in the quarterﬁnals without
losing a set, then Virginia Wesleyan 5-0,
again without dropping a set. In the ﬁnals,
the Generals took a 9-0 win over Bridge-
water without dropping one set. In most of
the matches, the ladies lost no more than
one or two games.

6-0, so it’s nice preparation for the focus
we’ll need to have at nationals.”

Will agreed, saying, “Playing ODACS
is a mental game because you can’t get
distracted or think you’re going to auto-
matically win. Our history of winning can
make it seem like it should be easy, but the
quality of players in ODACS increases ev-
ery year and you have to be mentally in the
match to win.”

1897

VOLUME CXI,

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

In a secret hearing held by the
Student-Faculty Hearing Board
last week, Trident authors Tim
Livingston and Mychael Mul-
hem were found guilty of “con-
duct unbecoming Washington
and Lee students” and placed on
probation for the rest of their col-
lege careers.

Livingston and Mulhem, both
seniors, have been subjected to a
ﬁrestorm of criticism since an ar-
ticle they wrote in March labeled
students as “pretentious sluts”
and trapped in the closet.

“I don’t think [the verdict]
was too harsh,” Mulhem said.
“I think it was fair for what hap-

pened.”

Livingston did not return calls
seeking comment on Sunday.

After the article was pub-
lished, students and members of
the faculty demanded the resig-
nation of Livingston, Mulhem
and Christina Pratt,'the Trident’s
editor-in-chief. President Ken
Ruscio sent out a campus-wide
e-mail. attacking the publication
and demanding that the writers
apologize and resign.

The three resisted the calls for
their resignation, but Mulhem
and Livingston reversed course
last week and formally resigned
from the paper.

After the Media Board, a
group comprised of the editors of
all campus publications, includ-

“It would have made more sense for conduct

unbecoming to go before SJC, which is, in my

feeling, the way it was supposed to happen.

But there was not a lot we could do about it. ”

MYCHAEL MULHERN, former Trident columnist

ing the Phi, originally declined
to issue sanctions against the Tri-
dent, an anonymous complain-
tant recently ﬁled charges with
the SF HB.

The SFHB is a board com-
prised of eight students and eight
faculty members. Four students
and four faculty members heard

the case against Livingston and
Mulhem. The students are ap-
pointed by the Executive Com-
mittee and the faculty members
are appointed by the provost.
The board was originally
formed to hear cases of sexual
misconduct and has the power
to punish or even expel students

through conﬁdential hearings
that are not open to the public.

Livingston and Mulhem were
originally charged with “conduct
unbecoming  and of acts of
prohibited sexual harassment.”

Since the accuser wished to
remain anonymous, no evidence
was presented about what effect
publication of the article actu-
ally had. The lack of evidence
led the board to ﬁnd Livingston
and Mulhem not guilty on sexual
harrasment charge.

According to Mulhem, the
identity of his accuser is still a
secret.

“We have no idea [who it
was],” Mulhem said. “My un-
derstanding is that only two peo-
ple know: the person who made

0 Trident “bracket” writers receive probation following anonymous complaint

the complaint and the person
who ﬁled it with the school.”

The complaint was originally
sent to Dean Brandon Dotson,
the associate dean of students
and the administration’s liason to
judicial bodies like the SJC.

Professor Brian Richardson,
chair of the Journalism Depart-
ment, criticized the board for
letting the accuser remain anony-
mous. He said he understands
why complaintants in sexual
misconduct or rape cases are al-
lowed to remain anonymous but
disagrees with letting speech be
prosecuted by anonymous com-
plaintants.

“R-E-S-P—E-C-T” forum addresses campus climate

Students meet to discuss respect, gender relations, and hurtful language in aftermath of “the bracket” and “the list”

By Michael Morella
STAFF WRITER

A mixed group of faces ﬁlled
room 345 of the Elrod Commons
last Tuesday night.

There were students and
faculty, freshmen and seniors,
Greeks and independents, chem-
istry majors and English pro-
fessors, men and women, dorm
counselors and residents, varsity
athletes and a university presi-
dent — not to mention at least one
other journalist ﬁiriously scrib-
bling notes. Even Larry Stuart,
one of Washington and Lee’s
beloved public safety ofﬁcers
made an appearance — watch-
ing the doors from his post in
the event that he might be called
upon.

A diverse array of perspec-
tives and backgrounds were rep-
resented at the forum. But what
brought this varied group of stu-
dents, faculty and administrators
together was a common desire to
discuss the concept of respect at
Washington and Lee.

The discussion, entitled “R-
E—S—P—E-C-T: Do students re-
ally respect each other?” was
billed as a chance to address
recent campus publications such
as “the bracket” and “the list.”
The event was organized inde-
pendently by two seniors, Paten
Hughes and Bill Larson.

Larson, who is a member of
sexual assault prevention group
1 in 4, said that he and Hughes
had not intended to tie the event
to any particular organization or
group but rather offer the chance

for all voices to speak and be
heard about important issues.

Junior Micaela Coffey was
one such voice. Coffey, a peer
counselor who has been actively
involved with issues regarding
gender relations at W&L, felt
the discussion addressed a lot of
the concerns that her work has
brought to light.

“[It was a] healthy way for
people to get out some really
strong feelings they had in a safe
environment,” she said. She was

Keen dismissed the simple adage
about “sticks and stones” after
the discussion and reﬂected on
the power of hailing as a means
of inﬂuencing another.

“Name-calling, I think, can
be extremely profound and can
be very hurtful if you’re on the
receiving end of it,” Keen said.
“There is a huge amount of so-
cial power with calling people
names.”

Keen also spoke highly of
student initiative in taking own-

“[It was a] healthy way for people to get out

some really strong feelings they had in a safe

environment...in general, change is going

to have to come from discussion among stu-

dents. ”

MICAELA COFFEY, junlor peer counselor

impressed by the attendance and
the thoughtful consideration of
the variety of issues the audi-
ence brought to light.

“People were there because
they cared about this topic and
they wanted to talk about it,”
Coffey said. “In general, change
is going to have to come from
discussion among students.”

Much of Tuesday’s discus-
sion centered on language is-
sues, particularly with regard
to individuals being conscious
about the particular words they
say. English Professor Suzanne

ership of the issues that are vital
to the entire community’s expe-
rience at W&L. I

“Now there’s a much clearer
message about what the com-
munity thinks about labeling,”
she said. Less clear, according
to Keen, is how the community
must grapple with ﬁiture issues
that seem to pit freedom of the
press against protection of a civ-
il community.

Yet, in her over 12 years on
the Washington and Lee faculty,
Keen was pleased to announce
that with many of the abstract

“big picture things” students
have confronted over the years,
she has seen remarkable im-
provement.

President Ken Ruscio was
also in attendance and remained
silent throughout Tuesday’s dis-
cussion.

“I continue to be impressed
by the students at Washington
and Lee,” Ruscio said afterward.
“They care about this com-
munity.” He commended the
organizers and all the students
involved for helping to craft the
Washington and Lee community
as they see it.

Amidst the talk of commu-
nity and gender relations, stu-
dents also raised concerns about
personal responsibility among
themselves and in interactions
with their peers. ,

‘At one point in the conver- '
sation, the idea was raised that
talking about the higher ideals
of honor and ‘dignity at Wash-

-ington and Lee does not neces-

sarily guarantee that the com-
munity members embody them.
Students and faculty responded
with an engaging and open dis-
cussion of this proposition.

The group debated for
nearly an hour and a half and
many emerged from the room
still buzzing about what was or
wasn’t said.

Freshman Catherine Kruse
acknowledged that some of the
gender issues brought up during
the discussion are true but was

TOP: The historic
Rockbrldge court-
house, built in 1896,
will be empty once
the new courthouse
is completed later
‘this year. The city and
county are currently
requesting propos-
als for how the space,
should be used.
RIGHT: The new court-
house, located at the
corner of Nelson and
Randolph, was start-
ed after a judge ruled
that the old building
did not adequately
meet the county's
judicial needs.

 

SF HB decision

continued from page 1

prosecuting someone for offensive speech,
which I have problems with in the ﬁrst place,
telling them  they’re not allowed to know
who complained violates basic fairness,”
Richardson said.

Richardson also said that allowing a com-
plainant to remain anonymous seemed con-
trary to the ideas of legal due process.

In the 2007-2008 Student Handbook, “con-
duct unbecoming” is only mentioned under the
section concerning the Student Judicial Coun-
cil, a group of elected students that hear cases
involving disciplinary matters.

“There are some problems in the student
handbook. That’s one thing the entire situa-
tion has brought out,” Mulhem said. “The
way I read it, it would have made more sense
for conduct unbecoming to go before SIC,
which is, in my feeling, the way it was sup-
posed to happen. But there was not a lot we
could do about it.”

David Bruck, a law professor and chairman
of the SFHB, defended the board’s ability to
hear “conduct unbecoming” charges.

“There was a complaint of conduct unbe-
coming and a complaint of sexual harassment,”
Bruck said. “[Conduct unbecoming] wouldn’t
be in our jurisdiction if it was the only charge
brought, but if two charges are brought we can
hear them both. If a harassment charge was
brought, we could return a conduct unbecom-
ing verdict, but the reverse isn’t true.”

Richardson said he thinks conduct un-
becoming is a vague charge to bring against
students whose speech might be considered
offensive.

“When somebody who writes something
can be accused of conduct unbecoming, we’re
conﬂating speech with conduct, and that
troubles me,” Richardson said. “The fact that
somebody, anybody in the community can
anonymously decide that ‘something some-

body expressed constitutes conduct unbecom-
ing and can haul them before a body that was

originally constituted to hear sexual miscon- ”

duct and sexual harassment cases troubles me
in a lot of respects.” '

Bruck said an eight person panel com-
prised of four faculty and four student mem-
bers heard the case. An earlier case heard with
eight members had to be re-heard in front of
the full sixteen-person board after the defen-
dant appealed the decision.

The appeal occurred because a student ar-
gued that the Student Handbook did not con-
tain provisions permitting the hearing to be
held before the smaller panel instead of the
entire board.

During the new hearing, the board stuck
with its original decision, suspending the stu-
dent for spring term and placing the student on
probation for one year.

In the case against Livingston and Mul-
hem, Richardson questioned whether or not

the ruling would serve the purpose of reduc- .

ing patently offensive speech. He said that he
worries the case will instead inhibit speech be-
cause students simply won’t know what is or
is not acceptable.

He also said that the case should never have
gone to the SFHB.

“I don’t fault the SFHB itself for the de-
cision,” Richardson said. I think they had an
awful task, because in my opinion, this case
was a mess procedurally. They acted honor-
ably under terrible circumstances, as far as I’m
concerned.” I

Meanwhile, Livingston and Mulhem both
hope the furor over theirarticle is ﬁnally dy-
ing down.

“I think the whole school needs to move on
and look at issues that were brought up with
this,” Mulhern said. “This is done, and it’s
nice to ﬁnally have it done.”

Respect forum

continued from page 1

concerned that Tuesday’s conversation fo-
cused too often on ideas that had already been
recognized.

Kruse, who is involved with student group
KEWL, felt the conversation wasn’t as much
about respect as it was about language issues
and gender relations.

“We can delve deeper,” Kruse said.

Hughes was proud of the way that those
present handled the talk but reminded the
audience at the discussion’s conclusion that
this was just the first step toward real action.

Hughes, who will graduate in just under a
month, urged the underclassmen to carry for-
ward with a more concrete plan toward ac-
tion.

“When people have breached our commu-
nity’s values of honor and respect, the com-
munity needs to talk about it,” Hughes wrote
in response to the discussion. “I’m looking
forward to continued dialogue among my
peers to ﬁgure out what they want the next
[step] to be.”

As construction rolls along at the new court-
house site near Davidson Park, the city and coun-
ty are struggling to decide what will happen to the
historic old courthouse.

The new building will sit on the corner of Nel-
son and Randolph Streets, while the old build-
ing — along with lawyers row — occupies a prime
stretch of downtown real estate at the corner of
Washington and Main Streets.

The Board of Supervisors will put out a re-
quest for proposals (RFP) for the development or
sale of the old courthouse in newspapers around
the state within the next week.

The proposals must come in by May 29, 2008,
and the county will select a developer within 30
to 60 days.

The Architectural Review Board has the abil-
ity to approve or deny plans for development.

The courthouse committee, a group of com-
munity members who have brainstormed the
problems and potential uses of the courthouse,
hopes developers will maintainthe historic value
of the courthouse while serving the public with
the new design.

Last year the old courthouse was surrounded
in controversy after the city and county looked
at trying to lure the Museum of the Confederacy
to the site. '

Proponents of the museum said it would have
been an economic boon to the downtown area,
drawing in thousands of tourists and pumping $1
million annually into the local economy.

Opponents, however, argmed that the court-
house would heighten racial tensions in the area
and fail to deliver the promised economic ben-
eﬁts.

The city and county were willing to give the
museum the $2 million building, but the museum
eventually decided to remain in Richmond.

That decision left the city and county back at
square one in their search to ﬁll the building.

The courthouse, built in 1896 and currently
owned by the county, is an important part of the

community, said Lexington Council Member
Mimi Elrod, a member of the committee.

“We hope to ﬁnd a way to save the architec-
tural features both inside and outside and ﬁnd a
way for the community use.it,” said Elrod.

Jerry Nay, another member of the committee,
said he is hopeful that developers will be able to
restore it “pretty much as it is.”

In a ﬁnal report issued August 9, the commit-

_tee said saving the old courthouse needed to help

make the area a better place to live, strengthen
the sense of community and make money for the
area.

Some ideas the committee brainstormed for
potential uses include:

- A community multi-purpose room/place.

- A place for not-for-proﬁt organizations.

- A centralized location for local schools to con-
duct off-campus programs.

- A place for local and guest artists to use for
educational/class purposes.

County Administrator Don Austin says there
has already been some expressed interest, but
nothing is ofﬁcial or formal until the proposals
are submitted.

Although Austin imagines most of the propos-

was also the need for adequate security, parking,

Trident precursor
worse than Bracket

Even in 1921, rebels exalted their own
intelligence, mocked embarrasing
habits, laughed at chronically drunk

 

To the editor:

In my collection of W&L memorabilia, I have an original copy of
a student newspaper called “The Rebel Yell.” My edition is volume 1
and was published in the spring of 1921. On either side of the banner
the publishers declared, “The Mighty are slow to anger and only the
Mighty have been considered here,” and “If you amount to nothing at
W&L don’t look for your name in the Rebel Yell.”

This paper is an obvious precursor to the Trident. The articles and
editorials are disrespectful of authority, i.e. the administration, and in-
sulting and scomful of many of their fellow students. The publishers
declared, “The staff of this ﬁrst effort represents genius drawn from
every element of the student body. And the members have combined
to point out, in the best of spirits, the foibles and idiosyncrasies or our
fellow students and faculty.” 

The paper mocked the faculty and compared the secrecy and results
of faculty meetings to those of the Ku Klux Klan. The Calyx was de-
scribed as “four hundred pages of drivel  with pictures of girls we
never saw dancing with campus roughnecks in evening clothes.”

Most importantly to the current uproar over the Trident’s “Worst
Person Ever,” The Rebel Yell had an entire page titled “People We
Can Get Along Without.” Here is a taste: “Jimmy Crawford, a strange
mixture of democracy and snobbery, has a penchant for undressing in
front of the windows  ‘Crit’ Currie continues to hold himself out
as a world champion ‘petter.’ If ‘they’ can stomach it, we shouldn’t
complain.”

One more: “If you are feeling blue or depressed just walk by Mc-
Grum’s (Drug Store) and perhaps Charlie Wright will speak to you.
When he is in unusually high spirits he will speak to every tenth man
that passes. Possibly his extreme cordiality may be attributed to the fact
that he is an SAE.”

There were many more students that were lampooned in the article.
The Rushton Brothers were “twin arguments for Racial Suicide,” etc.,
etc. The stories could have come right out of the Trident except these
snobs, drunks and peculiar types were written about 87 years ago!
Both the writers and the scorned walked the same stately campus all
of you share today.

Here’s my point: Like most of you, I cringed when I tread the Tri-
dent Bracket issue. I agreed that apologies were required from the Two
Raging Intellectuals. Then I remembered and retrieved the Rebel Yell
and changed my mind. There is a place in every vibrant community
for those who make us cringe. I would hasten to add that the Trident
should steer well clear of cruelty. Finally, let me state that I find it
amazing that the SAEs have always been the same.

Sunbathers on the Colonnade asking for ogling

By Grace Andrews
0 0 L U M N I ST

The issue of sunbathing, or better yet,
where you can and if you should sunbathe
is near and dear to my heart.

As many of you may or may not know, I
was born with a wonderful natural tan that
allows me to only sun worship for fun in-
stead of necessity or desire.

However, I realize that there are some
people who may require a bit of sun.

Yet, my problem is not that people need
sun but instead the places that people de-
cide to get this sun. For instance, I always
see people out on the BDG quad, the grassy
knoll by Gaines and the Colonnade. Al-
though I have my reservations about the
former, my problems arise with the latter.

You see, I am more understanding of
worshiping de la sol in the quad because
it’s a freshmen haven and it’s a little bit off
from academic buildings. However, it does
sit right next to a street that many non-W&L
individuals frequent, but I’ll let that go.

I just want to say that I have witnessed
cars almost lose control because the driver
couldn’t keep his or her eyeballs in their
face from straining so hard to watch the
young women in the quad.

But, like I said, I’ll let that go.

Now, I think that it is perfectly ﬁne to sit
out in a shirt and shorts, maybe even a hal-
ter top or any other shirt that allows maxi-
mum sun, minimum tan lines.

But I have trouble understanding why
people wear their skimpiest, most revealing
swimsuit to sit in the grass in front of the
Colonnade and Lee Chapel.

Seriously, the other day when I walked
by I thought Sports Illustrated was doing

the college swimsuit addition.

I was also a bit shocked since not only
does Lexington not have a beach, but also
we don’t always have sunbathing weather.

If it’s 60-75 degrees, you probably
shouldn’t be outside in a swimsuit that con-
sists of triangles that cover up your naughty
bits and string that barely holds it together.
That’s not enough clothing to keep a squir-
rel warm, let alone a full-grown human be-
ing.

If you want to do all that, I advise a trip

one wants to see all that, and by no one I
mean especially me.

I say save that for a more swimsuit-
friendly area.

Now, please don’t interpret my words to
be harsher than they are meant to be.

I just want to bring it to everyone’s atten-
tion that wearing swimsuits in places with
no water is interesting, to say the least.

When I approached my friends about
writing this article, many of them were sup-
portive and giggly at the idea of this topic.

You probably shouldn’t be outside in a swimsuit that con-

sists of triangles that cover up your naughty bits and string

that barely holds it together. That is not enough clothing to

keep a squirrel warm, let along a full-grown human being.

up to Goshen or even Virginia Beach.

Now, I know some of you may think I’m
being a hater, but that’s not my purpose.

I honestly would not mind if I didn’t
think that it is not kosher to run around or
sit about half naked where your professors,
families, prospective students and current
students have to walk by everyday.

I don’t want to see people tripping over
historical bricks because instead of looking
to see where they are going, they’re visually
harassing the people on the Colonnade.

I don’t want to see anyone wearing a
cast because they “accidentally” lost bal-
ance and “fell down” on the Colonnade.

Now matter how wonderful you look, no

I heard choruses of hallelujahs and
amens; I think the heavens openedup and
angels sang.

Seriously, next time that you decided to
sunbathe in public, please be considerate of
those who have to see you sunbathing.

Don’t just wear invisible clothing and
wonder why people are staring or judging
you.

Or if you do decided to wear a skimp
suit, please don’t be offended if someone
says something that isn’t as nice as it could
be.

My recommendation is to sunbathe on
the Colonnade if you’re wearing real clothes
and the quad or grassy knoll for swimsuits!

Fitting with the kangaroo court pro-
ceedings that prevail at W&L, there is no
deﬁnition of what “conduct unbecoming”
actually means. In fact, the SFHB isn’t
even supposed to be able to hear cases in-
volving “conduct unbecoming.” That job
falls to the"Student Judicial Council.

Amazingly enough, the faculty and
students on the SFHB have appointed
themselves judge and jury over Livings-
ton and Mulhern even though the students
are appointed by the Executive Commit-

provost. Wonderful! An appointed group,

Memorializing Lee

Lee Chapel museum re-opens with new features

ByJamle Klm
sun wmnsn

. Lee Chapel — completed in

1867 when Robert E. Lee was
president of what was then

Washington College — is the

central shrine of Washington

and Lee University.
Recently, the Lee Chapel
museum re-opened after a $1-

million renovation that had it
closed for about a year. It is
now fully installed with new
exhibitions and an improved

museum shop.
“It was a very extensive in-
stallation,” said Linda Donald,

manager of Lee Chapel and

Museum. The installation last-
. ed from January 2007 to "Octo-

ber 2007, but the planning took

about two years before actually
getting started on the installa-
tion process.

With the renovation of the
main exhibition, the Lee Of-
ﬁce, and the museum shop,
three projects were going on
simultaneously, said Donald.
Additional interpretive pan-
els, which provide the visitors
with information about the ex-
hibitions, were also installed
upstairs in the Lee Chapel, in-

cluding the statue chamber of

Robert E. Lee.

From 1865 until his death
in 1870, Lee served as presi-
dent of Washington College.
The Lee Office was an actual
ofﬁce in which Lee conducted
his business, and it was also a
social hall where students came
in and out while Lee was in his
office. “It would be as if the
President of the school had his
oﬂice in the living room of the

Commons,” said Donald.

One of the biggest changes
from the renovation includes
this oﬂice, said Patricia Hobbs,
curator of Lee Chapel and Mu-
seum. Information panels were
added on the rail, and the rail-

‘ way has been extended more

into the office so that visitors
could have more access to view
the room.

For the preservation of the
office, ﬁber-optic lighting that
causes the least harm on the dis-
plays is now used, and the win-
dows are covered with blinds to

would understand what Robert
E. Lee’s role and responsibility
were.”

Moreover, 2007 was a year
of the 400th anniversary of the
settlement of Virginia, so the
renovation of the museum was
a part of a statewide celebra-
tion. It was also the 250th anni-
versary of the birth of Marquis
de Lafayette, a French mili-
tary ofﬁcer who supported the
American Revolution.

“The University felt strongly
that it was good to share our ob-
jects with the rest of the coun-

“To some, [Lee Chapel] is the most sig-

mﬁcant place on campus...it was kept as a

shrine or a memorial to [Lee]. ”

LINDA DONALD, Lee Chapel and Museum manager

block the natural light.

“To some, it is the most sig-
niﬁcant place on campus,” said
Donald. After Lee’s death, the
board of trustees decided that
the ofﬁce was not to be used by
other presidents. “It was kept
as a shrine or a memorial to
him,” she said.

The extensive renovation of
the museum was an expensive
but a necessary initiative, ac-
cording to Hobbs.

The year 2007 was the
200th anniversary of Robert E.
Lee’s birth, and the University
wanted to do something special
for the celebration. “My sug-
gestion was to add text panels
to Lee’s Oﬁice so that [visitors]

try,” said Hobbs. “We decided
we would take the opportunity
to add some more interpreta-
tions.”

She explained the process
of receiving several grants and
consulting special history schol-
ars to talk about the new exhibi-
tion. “It was very rewarding to
ﬁnd out that it was a fairly sim-
ple thing to do,” said Hobbs.
“The older exhibition was very
tightly designed...Now it can
be easily moved around.”

Every year, many different
types of visitors come to the
Lee Chapel and Museum, and
75 percent of them visit starting
in late April until the end of Oc-
tober. Some are strictly focused

on Robert E. Lee, some simply
stumble upon the area off an in-
terstate, and some come for the
natural beauty of the area, said
Donald.

In addition to handling the
museum staff members, Don-
ald also deals with weddings in
the Lee Chapel.

Anyone can have a wedding
in the chapel, but people affili-
ated with Washington and Lee
receive preference. The chapel
has about 20-35 weddings per
year, operated under a three-
tiered system.

The priority ﬁrst goes to
alumni, students‘ and faculty,
then to people from the neigh-
boring Virginia Military Insti-
tute and local citizens. Other re-
quests have the lowest priority.
This policy began three years
ago. Before that, people from
outside Lexington could not
have a Lee Chapel wedding.

Washington and Lee is a
unique institution, the history
of which coincides with much
of American history, during the
American Revolution and later.

Through Lee Chapel and
Museum, the University has
tried to inform not only the
students but also visitors from
all over the country about the
history of the institution and
its indirect, and in some ways
symbolic, correlation with the
American history.

It is a resource for the entire
community and an ambassador
to the public for the University,
said Hobbs. “lt’s important for
students of local history,” she
said. “That’s what the museum
is all about.”

Biology receives grant

$1.3 million grant to enrich curriculum, provide technology

By Brett Holton
STAFF WRITER

This coming fall, Washing-
ton and Lee science students
will have even more tools at
their ﬁngertips to give them a
leg up upon graduation.

The Howard Hughes Medi-
cal Institute (HHMI) awarded
W&L a $1.3 million grant to
help students acquire the nec-
essary skills for today’s career
ﬁeld in biological sciences.

The programs provided by
the grant will be put into place
in September.

“The grant...will be used to
enrich the science curriculum
by including more integration
across different courses and
departments, and especially in-
cluding more quantitative and
computational work to give
students the skills they need to
understand today’s world of sci-

ence,” said W&L provost, Dr.
June Aprille.

Aprille said that to achieve
this goal, the university will hire
new faculty who have expertise

ology and prospective pre-med
student. “Medical school is be-
coming more of a technology-
based education, and this will

allow me to be exposed to that
sooner.”

The HHMI grant will also
be used to facilitate commu-
nity outreach. According to the

grant proposal summary, new
service-learning courses will be
added that will enable students
to teach science in local K-5
classrooms.

“The HHMI grants are quite
prestigious, and it is a national
feather in W&L’s cap to have
won the award,” said Aprille.

Aprille also hopes that the
grant will attract future prospec-
tive students interested in the
biological sciences.

HHMI is a nonproﬁt medi-
cal research organization. It was
founded in 1953 by Howard R.
Hughes, the aviator and indus-
trialist. HHMI headquarters are
located in Chevy Chase, Md.
The organization employs more
than 2,600 individuals across
the U.S. and has an endowment
of$16.3 billion.

The grant was awarded to
only 48 of the 192 applicants.

W&L attracts new leaders

Johnson program also responsible for huge jump in admissions applications

By Alllson Chopln
STAFF WRITER

Leadership programs may
help Washington and Lee gain
national and international recog-
nition as a top-notch liberal-arts
college. At least, that’s what
Professor Rob Strong hopes the
Johnson Program will do.

Last May, a $100 million do-
nation was made to W&L to sup-
port leadership programs. The
unprecedented gift was made
by Henry Johnson ’62, the Vice
Chairman of Franklin Templeton
Investments.

$85 million will go towards
the Johnson Scholarship, allow-
ing talented high school students
without the ﬁnances to attend
W&L. There will be 44 Johnson

Scholars in next year’s freshman
class.

The program was heavily ad-
vertised and total of applications
jumped to over 6,000, up almost
50 percent from last year.

The remaining $15 million
will be used toward the Johnson
Program, providing for two new
faculty positions, internships
for W&L juniors, and an annual
symposium. Strong was named
director of the Johnson Program
two weeks ago.

“This is a huge new oppor-
tunity for the whole campus,”
Strong said. He believes the new
leadership programs will not
only enhance W&L’s reputation
as a strong liberal-arts college,
but bring it to the attention of a

greater number of households in
the United States and around the
world.

That is because the Johnson
Program has been heavily adver-
tised with an emphasis on “lead-
ership and integrity,” Provost
June Aprille said. The incoming
Johnson Scholars will be at the
forefront of this initiative.

But leadership programs are
not new at Washington and Lee.
Burr Datz, the director of Lead-
ership Development and coordi-
nator of Religious life, has been
leading seminars on leadership
and the high ropes course near
the pavilion since 2001.

“We believe you as students
are to govern yourselves be-
cause you assume responsibility

and tend to thrive with it,” he
said. Datz challenges students
to work with their peers on the
ropes course and he gives weekly
classes on leadership skills.

Last week the Ofﬁce of Lead-
ership Development sponsored
“Lessons in Leadership,” a talk
given by Bobby Ross, a former
football coach. The program will
continue with William Johnson
’6l, who is speaking on Tues-
day from his experience as the
former President and CEO of the
New York Stock Exchange.

Aprille said the Oﬂice of
Leadership Development will re-
ceive no direct funding from the
Johnson Program, but “the two
programs will no doubt comple-
ment one another.”

After 60 years Harw Lee is back

Albert Sidney and Harry Lee crew rivalry restarts with Maury River showdown

MICHAEL KEENAN/ Sports Editor

TOP: The Harry Lee Boat Club of (L to R) Caitlin
Foster, Parker Sheppard, Julie Mancini, Jarret
Brotzman and Denis O’Leary, takes part in the
Albert Sidney-Harry Lee Boat Race on the Maury
above the dam, for the first time in 60 years. The
race began in 1875 and was a huge campus event
for decades. The last race was in 1948 with the
Albert Sidney Club as the winner.

LEFl': Caitlin Foster celebrates and Parker Shep-
pard stares toward shore with a sense of satisfac-
tion after the Harry Lee Club won by a decisive
margin.

BOTTOM LEFT: The Harry Lee Club powers its way
through the last 400 meters of the race, as the
Albert Sidney Club trys to make its way out of the
trees on the bank of the river after being forced into
shore by agressive steering that surely is represena-
tive of the fierce rivalry between the two clubs.
BOTTOM RIGHT: Members of both clubs pose in
front of their new Wintech bow-coxed four man
boat, which they bought as a result of their fund-
raising efforts. The members of the clubs are from

drew Rubin, three-seat Jamie Boldrick and stoke
Grant Russell and The Harry Lee Club of bow Denis
O’Leary Ill, two-seat Jarret Brotzman, three-seat Ju-
lie Mancini and coxswain. Following the race, there
was a reception at Pole 6 for the team, members

of the university community, and alumni where the

The women’s lacrosse team’s run in the NCAA tour-
nament continued this week as they took on Amherst
College. The match would mean quarterﬁnal meeting
__ with Franklin and Marshall for the winner and an end
to the season for the loser. W&L came into the game
ranked sixth; Amherst was ranked eleventh.

The game started out close and was hotly contested
 throughout. Amherst opened up the scoring as Amy

' Craig tallied unassisted with 26:52 left in the ﬁrst half.
W&L responded quickly when Kelsi Robinson scored
off of an assist from Laura Henson, tying the contest 
at 1-1. After another goal from Amherst, the Generals
scored two in a row to take the lead 3-2. However, this
lead didn’t last for long. About a minute later, the game
was tied up at 3-3, and, at the end of the half, the Lord
Jeffs of Amherst led 6-4.

W&L started the second half strong, getting a quick
goal from Laura Henson of off an assist from Chris-
tine Bender. This brought the Generals within one goal
with 29:13 to go in the second half. In the next ﬁve
minutes the teams traded goals to make the game 7-6.
Amherst then went on a deﬁnitive three goal run with
under seven minutes left to put the score at 10-6. W&L
added a couple of late goals, but it was too little and too
late as the Generals fell 10-8, ending their season. .

W&L did end the season with some strong individual
performances. Kelsi Robinson and Laura Henson both
scored two goals for the Generals. Christine Bender,
Emily Mathews, Megan Slosson, and Britten Mathews
also found the back of the net for the Generals. Sarah
Tilbor played all 60 minutes in goal for W&L saving
ﬁve shots.

The team ends their year with a 17-3 (8-0 ODAC)
record and a sixth straight ODAC championship.

W&L’s own
“Secret Garden”

Produce grown on campus
to beneﬁt Campus Kitchens
Project and Dining Hall

By Rosemary Kelley
STAFF w RITER

The Biology department has created a community
garden to be used for the Campus Kitchens Project
(CKP) and Dining Services.

The garden is located at the back of campus, past
the baseball ﬁelds. The land was previously dedicat-
ed to biological studies and composting. For the last
week, the land has undergone a transformation into a
garden. _

Biology professor Bill Hamilton and Enviromnen-
tal Management coordinator Chris Wise are spear-
heading the transformation. Through their dedication
and with the help of several student and faculty vol-
unteers, the plot now has a variety of vegetables and
herbs in the ground. There are several species of to-
matoes, peppers, beans, squash, okra, cucumbers, and
herbs.

The garden uses the compost pile created by stu-
dents to enhance nutrients in the soil. In doing so,
this project will potentially inspire more student in-
volvement in environmental problems and spark new
solutions.

Volunteer planter Sarah Thomsberry said, “It was
a really fun experience to plant tomatoes in the com-
munity garden and to think that the vegetables har-
vested next year from the garden will be consumed on
campus in the Marketplace and around the community
through Campus Kitchens.”

Thomsberry added, “As a CKP volunteer, I am
really looking forward to using the basically organic
garden produce in the Campus Kitchens’ meals. The
fresh vegetables are not only going to offer a lot of
nutrition but will also add variation for the different
components of the meals.”

CKP will have the opportunity to use these garden-

grown vegetables and herbs. Instead of using canned
vegetables, students can creat bean salads from scratch.
Professor Hamilton sees the garden as a way to teach
meal recipients about nutrition and health. Student
volunteers will teach about the ways to create healthy
meals from vegetables and meats.

CKP Coordinator Robbie Turner sees the garden as
a way to move toward new options for CKP clients.
Herbs will be incorporated into sauces to put on meat
and other prepared dishes. CKP is extremely excited
about this way to expand the types of meals prepared.

Dining Services will incorporate the local herbs
into dishes next. year. In using local products, the uni-
versity will support Rockbridge County. This increas-
es the environmental sustainability of the campus as
the Marketplace chooses fresh, home-grown products.
Dining Services already incorporates local products
into its meals.

The upkeep of the garden will be accomplished
through student volunteer work. There will be a CKP
shift devoted to the produce.

Professor Hamilton spoke about designing a course
incorporating the study of biology and working with
the produce. This is a great opportunity for the school
to work with students, the community and beyond.
Professor Hamilton has started a project that will tan-
gibly beneﬁt everyone involved: students, faculty and
clients.

Hundreds of Washington and
Lee ‘students, faculty and com-
munity members ﬁlled an area in
front of the Stackhouse Theater
last Thursday, anxiously awaiting
the arrival of Bill Nye, popular
television host and science educa-
tor.

Everyone was packed in like
sardines as they waited for the
door of the theater to be opened.
When it ﬁnally opened around
7:10 p.m., the hopeful attendees
pushed themselves forward excit-
edly, swarming into the theater to
claim one of about 200 coveted
seats.

As soon as the introducer ap-
peared on stage, the audience
loudly chanted, “Bill! Bill! Bill!”

Many fans of Bill Nye the Sci-
ence Guy remember him as the
goofy scientist with neverend-
ing experiments on lighthearted
science topics. This time how-
ever, Nye was prepared to discuss
something more serious — global
warming.

But even with this serious top-
ic, Nye did not forget to exercise
his sense of humor, which drew
appreciative laughter from the au-
‘dience.

“Mercury is too close to the
Sun and Mars is too far from the

Sun in order for life to exist,” said
Nye. He added, “Venus is way
too hot because of its thick atmo-
sphere. We used to call it venereal
atmosphere instead of venusian
atmosphere, but that adjective got
used somewhere else.”

“The Earth here is just right.
And this, my friend, is the joy
of discovery,” said Nye. “That is
what science is all about.”

Freshman Catherine Anderson
said that Nye’s speech was engag-
ing even for people who are not
very knowledgeable in science.

“Bill Nye did a good job of
weaving humor into his presenta-
tion in order to make it more in-

' teresting,” she said. “Even the fact
that his slideshow was peppered
with little jokes here and there
made you really want to keep
watching.” '

Nye attacked the issue of global
warming from several angles, ex-
amining everything from Argen-
tina’s Upsala Glacier, which has
completely melted in the past 80
years, to environemntally-friendly
vehicles such as the Prius.

“Everywhere in the world ex-
cept the United States, people
talk about climate change all the
time,” he said. “The key to our
future is not having people to do
less. We’ve got to ﬁnd ways to do
more with less. That is what I want

you to do.”

According to Nye, many
households in China use a solar
hot water system because it is free
heat. Nye’s own house is equipped
with solar panels on the roof. “My
electric bills are $7 a month,” he
said. “This is a huge unexploited
resource in the United States.”

Nye also discussed the pos-
sibility of getting ﬁve times as
much energy as we need from the
turbines on a wind farm. He joked
about investing in this area. “You
would get rich! You would change
the world!”

“Global warming and going
green are obviously really big is-
sues right now, and I often hear
people talking about them,” said
Anderson. “A lot of the times,
though, it seems like people are
just talking about it because it’s

‘the fashionable thing to talk about

right now, so it continues to be
really vague to a lot of people. I
think Bill Nye did a good job of
actually talking about speciﬁcs
and giving us reasonable ideas of
how we can ‘change the world.”
Freshman Lauren Miller was a
bit disappointed with Nye’s talk;
she did not expect Nye to talk
about environmental issues. Rath-
er, she thought he would perform
some science experiments that he
had done during his TV career.

COURTESY OF BECKY GUYNN

“I thought his message about
global warming was interesting
even though I was aware of this
issue previously. I also felt like
he was saying a lot of things that I ~
hear emphasized in the media on a
regular basis and didn’t necessar-
ily need to hear again.”

“I don’t need to wait an hour
and a half to hear someone talk
about an issue I can hear about ev-
ery single day if I just turn on the
TV or get on the Internet,” Miller
said. “Global warming is an issue
I often get tired of hearing about
because it’s emphasized so much
in the media already. Most of us
know ways we can be taking care
of the enviromnent; it’s still up to
us to decide whether or not we’re
going to implement them, regard-
less of how often we hear about
them.”

Some might have been im-
pressed and some might have been
disappointed by Bill Nye, but it is
clear that he delivered an obvious
but important message to the com-
ing generation about global warm-
ing.
“There is no cavalry com-
ing over the hill. This is where
we make our stand,” Nye said.
“Shouldn’t we be taking better
care of our world?”

Johnston shares his experience as President of the NY Stock Exchange during 9/I1 tragedy

By John Henderson
STAFF WRITER

On September ll, 2001, when the
streets of Manhattan were ﬂooded
with people heading north, the Presi-
dent of the New York Stock Exchange
was ﬁghting to go south—William
R. Johnston ‘6l wanted to get back
to the World Trade Center to lend a
hand.

Going east, then south, then west,
Johnston arrived at Ground Zero
shortly after the ﬁrst of the two World
Trade Towers came crashing to the
ground. “It’s a sound I will never
forget in my life,” Johnston said to
a small audience of W&L students,
professors and administrators last
Tuesday. “I thought it was an earth-
quake.”

With the ﬁrst tower in ruins and
the second on the verge of collapse,
Johnston helped form a triage sys-
tem to get medical attention for the
wounded as they came out of the
World Trade Center. At the time,
Johnston was 62 years old and a

grandfather.

Although Johnston might be bet-
ter remembered for his nearly 50-
year career in the New York Stock
Exchange as a trader and later its
President, his actions in the days fol-
lowing the September llth attacks

“It is a sound] will
never forget in my life. I
thought it was an earth-

quake. ”

WILLIAM R. JOHNSTON, former
Presldent of the New York Stock
Exchange and W&L alumnus

deﬁne him as a leader.

Johnston was the second of two
speakers in the “Lessons on Leader-
ship” series sponsored by the Office
of Leadership Development.

The attacks left New York City in
a state of disarray. On the west side

of Broadway, a “grayout” was caus-

mg power outages and disrupting
intemet and cell phone connections.
The east side, on the other hand,
was relatively functional. The Stock
Exchange had to make a choice—
whether to keep Wall Street running
during those hectic days or stop it.

“What do you do when 50 per-
cent of your players can’t come to
the game?” Johnston asked. “We felt
the better part of valor was to shut it
down.”

Instead of letting one half of Wall
Street proﬁt while the other half was
incapacitated, Johnston allowed ev-
eryone time to get back on their feet.
“You’ve got to do what’s right for the
public,” he said.

Johnston said he is grateful for
the honor system, which helped him
make good decisions during his long
career as a trader, business owner and
executive.

He offered two pieces of advice
for graduating Washington and Lee
students: “Find a job that you can be
passionate about, that every day you

can enjoy... Find a partner that you
can be passionate with.”

J ohnston’s talk was attended by 15
people in the Outing Club Resource
room, including Burr Datz, the direc-
tor of Leadership Development and
coordinator of Religious Life. When
asked what makes Johnston a great
leader, Datz replied, “His enthusi-
asm. .. and the twinkle in his eye.”

Students and faculty chatted with
Johnston after a question and answer
session. “I think the key word for
this talk is real,” said junior Yan Yan,
a Philosophy major. “Real life expe-
rience.”

Johnston is retired from Wall
Street and says he is in the “give-
back” stage of life, investing time
and money in foundations for cancer
research and holistic learning, his
church in New Jersey, his alma mater,
Washington and Lee, and his wife’s
alma mater, Hollins University. They
have been married for 46 years.

Gates addresses VMI :9 graduating class, relays importance of public service

By Jacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

For the fourth year in a row,
the number of Virginia Military
Institute (VMI) students joining
the military has increased. One
hundred and twenty-nine mem-
bers — or about 52 percent — of
the Class of 2008 became ofﬁcers
in the Army, Navy, Air Force or
Marine Corps last weekend dur-
ing VMI’s graduation ceremo-
nies. In 2005, about 40-percent
of VMI graduates joined the
military.

And for the second time in
three years, the graduates heard
from the U.S. Secretary of De-
fense.

“One of the strengths of the
United States is institutions like
VMI,” Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates told the graduates
and their guests. “From Kabul
to Kirkuk, former VMI cadets
are serving throughout the armed
forces and the U.S. government
in many roles.” '

But not all VMI students are
waiting until graduation to start
their service. Gates said that 75
cadets have been called to active
duty since 2001; and 41 of those
cadets have been deployed over-
seas. There are currently 10 VMI
students serving in either Iraq or
Afghanistan.

Gates, who was Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency
from 1991-1993 and was presi-
dent of Texas A&M University
before replacing Donald Rums-
feld as secretary in December
2006, told the crowd that his

uation speeches brief.

United States in more than just
military life.

“We believe we can make
the lives of others better and can
make a difference and a contri-
bution to the greatest country on
Earth,” Gates said.

Gates drew heavily on the
imagery of America’s citizen sol-
diers, speaking at length about a
1980 VMI graduate and member
of the Army Reserves who is
currently serving in Northeastern
Afghanistan.

Col. Jonathan Ives, who com-
mands about 1,000 troops, named
his unit Task Force Cincinnatus,
a tribute to the Roman general
who laid down his weapons and
returned to farming after leading
the Roman legions to victory.

“The citizen soldier is no
myth,” Gates said. “He is real.”

Gates said that Ives has been

Washington was president of
the society from its formation in
1783 until his death in 1799.
Gates continued his discussion
of the citizen soldier by invok-
ing the words of General George
Marshall, a 1901 VMI graduate
who served as Chief of Staff dur-

ing World War II and Secretary
of State under President Harry
Truman. Gates reminded the
graduates that they are trained to
be more than just soldiers.

“Our graduates seldom amass

' great wealth,” Marshall said in

1940, “but just as seldom do they
display weakness or indifference
to their duties as citizens. They
are trained to be soldiers, if there
be need for soldiers.... But what
is far more important, they are
trained to be good citizens.”
Being a good citizen often
leads to criticism, Gates warned.
He reminded the graduates that
Marshall had been ridiculed by

“Our country faces many

Gates said. “We live in a time
of ‘great necessities’ ~ a time
in which we cannot avoid the
burdens of global leadership.
The stakes are too high. And it
is precisely during these times
that America needs its best and

Correction: Last week’s article said the forum was titled “Do students really
respect each other?” The forum’s actual title was “R-E-S—P—E-C—T: What does it
really mean to you?”

. Article inaccurate,
  missed the point

“Hide ” article needs to check its facts;
does the weight of freedom of the press

equal honor, respect among students?

To the Editor:

I am responding to last week’s “What’s there to hide?” article.
The article raised many questions in my mind. Who is the au-
thor? Why is no author listed? Who are the sources? Why were
the people involved not given a chance to comment? Why was
the article not fact checked (at least not very well)? The article
asserts that Larry and the administration turned a NPR reporter
away at the front door. Larry and the administration did not turn
her away at the door. She did not even try to come to the event.
The article is also critical of the administration’s refusal to an-
swer questions about the punishment of the bracket’s authors.
They could not have answered the questions because the hearing
did not take place until the following night. Furthermore, Dean
Watkins and the administration are bound by law from disclosing
information about student conduct matters.

The Phi interviewed me about the conversation, but I do not
recall being asked for a comment about reporters’ ability to at-
tend the conversation. Had I been given the chance to comment,
this is what I would have said. You correctly reported that the R-
E-S-P-E-C-T discussion was “a chance for students, faculty and
administrators to talk about whether or not students and faculty
respect each other.” You will notice that reporters were not part
of that list. The campus conversation was intended to be produc-
tive and allow for anyone with a view to express it in a safe envi-
ronment. Having a reporter from NPR at the conversation would
have allowed students’ comments to be aired on the radio and
would have likely inhibited frank and productive conversation.
Once Iwas made aware of outside reporters’ desire to attend the
conversation, I wanted to make sure they would not be permitted
in the room. This was not the unilateral action of the administra-
tion as the article suggests.

Looking back at the events of the last couple of months, I
hope we can move past the question of whether newspapers have
the right to publish offensive material. Instead, let us consider
whether they should publish it. Do we as students, do we as a
university support the publishing of these verbal assaults? Do we
think this stuff should be in the public discourse at a university
that prides itself on honor and respect? Are we living up to our
ideals, that include developing harmonious relationships among
students (university mission statement)? I hope that the R-E-S-
P-E-C-T conversation shifted the discussion away from the list
and the bracket and toward the way we should treat each other. I
hope that conversation will continue on the hill, in the dorms and
in the fraternity and sorority houses. If you were not able to at-
tend the conversation, talk to someone who did. There were lots
of great ideas expressed about what we can do moving forward.
Let’s start thinking a little more before we write or say something
and ponder the effect of those words.

Joys of Spring Term

Homework, allure of sunbathing create a balancing act

By Celeste Cruz-Carandang
and Joan Oguntlmlen
co L u M N I s r s

It’s Spring Terrn—one of the
best opportunities this school
offers. It provides the chance
to study abroad, take interest-
ing courses or simply take some
time off. And though it sucks that
friends at other schools have al-
ready started their summer vaca-
tion, students here can still enjoy
something close to a spring vaca-
tion.

Upon registration, I knew that
this institution would be academi-
cally challenging. For one of the
very ﬁrst times in my life, I had to
do all the reading and homework
and actually study for ﬁnals. My
very ﬁrst 8 a.m. class made it
clear that I was not in high school
anymore.

Yet as the terms progressed my
friends began telling me how great
Spring Term was. They ﬁlled my
mind with stories of Goshen, the
Maury River and Panther Falls.
Even the inner tubes in the book-
store portended six weeks full of
slipping and sliding. .

Now I realize that Spring Term
is not simply about fun and games.
That is the mythical Spring Term.
No one can just party every night
and still make the grade. Behind
that hedonistic facade of Monday
through Friday parties is a student
hurrying to ﬁnish her reading.

who fail to recognize the dual
facets of this rare opportunity.
Although I am sure there are
students who are too studious,
it seems that the majority would
spend all of their time, including
class time, partying. They trade
Spring Term for spring vacation

My friends began telling me how great Spring

Term was. T hey ﬁlled my mind with stories of
Goshen, the Maury River and Panther Falls...

That is the mystical Spring Term.

At the same time, it is not a
solely academic experience. After
24 weeks of intense academics,
albeit peppered with more than
a few parties, it would be impos-
sible for anyone to spend another
six weeks cooped up in their room
with an open textbook. Instead,
the real Spring Term is about bal-
ance.

three times a week? When there
are only about 12 classes in the
term, missing half of your classes
is an appeal for failure. But we
guess those who get less than av-
erage grades during Spring Term
can always look back and say,

“Hey, I might have failed that
class, but at least I made good
memories.”

Though there is a lot of reading
involved for most of the Spring
Term courses, the course material
tends to be appealing. Because
it’s so relaxed and stress-free,
Spring Term actually provides a
better learning environment. Af-
ter spending two or more hours
reading and then attending class
for two or three more hours, it’s
due reward to spend the evening
partying, sleeping, hanging out or
doing absolutely nothing at all.
There’s time to do it all.

Yet, I must still concede that
this term has been extremely en-
joyable. It is true that I am not
tubing or tanning everyday. To my
great surprise, I do spend some
days studying and writing papers
like it’s Winter Term rather than
four weeks into the last term of
my freshman experience. W&L is
truly a unique place. That much is
obvious. It seems that our brand
of student is not only intelligent
and studious, but can also pull off
a 20-page term paper after a trip
to Panther Falls.

Act against dictatorship

We need to intervene in Burma, ﬁght evil, stop fooling around

By Abel Delgado
C 0 L U M N I ST

The numbers are enough to
make anyone with a conscience
cringe, despair and resolve to
act. Anywhere from 130,000 to
400,000 dead, while many more
are starving, homeless and with-
ering away in the most unsanitary
conditions imaginable. They are
left defenseless iii the aftermath
of Cyclone Nargis.

Unfortunately, the brutal mili-
tary junta in control of Burma has
no conscience and is not only fail-
ing to act but is also doing its best
to prevent others from doing so,
ensuring the deaths of hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, more.

“Cruel” doesn’t begin to de-
scribe the inhumanity of these
thugs. The word “savagery” does
not do their actions justice. Now,
two million of their citizens are
at risk due to hunger and disease
not because of the cyclone but be-
cause these sad excuses for men
block international aid workers
from crossing their borders.

The military leaders may be
brutal, but they aren’t foolish.
They know if the international
community is allowed to save
their people in ways they cannot,
then they will be discredited and
their grip on power will be loos-
ened if not dissolved completely.
So they would rather turn their
back on their dying citizens so
they can guard against “foreign
intervention.” Apparently the
worst of men can do far more
harm than the worst of nature.

So what are we going to do
about it? _

The argument that a humani-
tarian intervention would violate
their sovereignty was null and
void the moment the junta was
unwilling to help or accept that
others help their citizens. French
Foreign Minister and world-re-
nowned humanitarian Bernard
Kouchner raised the prospect of a
“forced” intervention by invoking
the U.N. doctrine of the “respon-
sibility to protect.” Not only does
the civilized world, the world that
cannot see innocent people perish

without reason, have a right to in-
tervene, but we have a responsi-
bility to do so.

If we can drop bombs, then we
can drop food. If we can build a
“Coalition of the Willing” to de-
pose a dictator, we can build one
to save a people.

The situation in Burma right
now is a stronger case for imme-
diate intervention than was Iraq
in 2003, Afghanistan in 2001 and
Kosovo in 1999. In the aftermath
of September llth, we warned
rogue dictators that they were ei-
ther with us or with the terrorists.
There is no middle ground. If we
fail to save the Burmese, then we
are against them and with their
rogue dictators.

The critics and cynics argue
that the junta is rightfully para-
noid that Western aid is a cover-
up for a Western takeover of their
country. We intervene and depose
dictators too much, and we have
a record of creating chaos when
doing so.

So they too would rather turn
their backs and watch people

die instead of saving them. They
criticize their governments be-
cause, unlike the Burmese, they
can. Regardless of whether or
not their governments intervene,
these cynics will continue to live
comfortably in the West while the
Burmese suffer endlessly.

If saving people causes dic-
tators to fall, where’s the harm?
Granted, there can be unforseen
consequences and chaos, but this
pales in comparison to the harm
caused by letting these people
die. _

The greater evil is not what the
junta has done but what we are
currently failing to do. Instead of
sitting back and waiting for these
vile rulers to give us “permission”
to enter the ravaged areas, we
should stand up and not wait for
the catastrophe to get worse.

Two million people are on the
verge of dying. The time for the
free people and democratic gov-
ernments of the world to save the
oppressed and ravaged people of
Burma is now.

Make honor into a lifestyle

Sexual assault should not mean less than other honor violations, especially here

By Catherine Kruse
C 0 L U M N I S T

Once upon a time, I thought
that “honor” meant holding your-
self to a higher level of integrity
because of a certain duty that you
felt towards your fellow human.
However, upon coming to Wash-
ington and Lee, I learned that
honor means withholding from
“lying, cheating and stealing” be-
cause it is in the rules. We vehe-
mently disclaim being part of an
honor “code” because a long time
ago, we believed that we were
above relying on speciﬁc coded
rules to tell us how to behave cor-
rectly.

However, the treatment that
I have observed, read about and
experienced tells me that our cur-
rent deﬁnition must only follow
the rules. While there are many
infractions on what I would call
a true honor system, the discon-
tinuities which bother me the
most are the real honor violations
against the women on this campus
(which are not in the books).

On an everyday level, wom-
en at W&L have to watch their
backs. We must lock our doors
every night, not because we are
scared of strangers getting into

the building, but because we are
scared of our own classmates
getting drunk and breaking into
our rooms. At parties, we have
to travel in groups and monitor
who we talk to, for how long we
talk, and exactly how we do it so
as not to give anyone the wrong
idea. The sad thing is that on this
campus, the wrong idea can lead
to a life-shattering experience.
What is even sadder is that it hap-
pens more often than anyone will
admit.

I realize that these instances
occur everywhere” However, I
once thought that we held our-
selves at a standard above ev-
eryone else. Furthermore, our
sexual assault statistics and gener-
ally sexist practices show that we
aren’t even par with “everyone”
else. Many times, we are below
them. Yes, a school which prides
itself on its high “unenforced”
honorability does not treat its
women well enough to even be
considered average.

Recently, many students have
expressed wary feelings toward
the Student-Faculty-Hearing
Board, which is the only deﬁni-
tive place on campus in which
people can be expelled for sexual
misconduct. Students have called
it secretive even though the ano-

nymity with which it associates
itself helps to ensure a safer envi-
ronment for victims of sexual mis-
conduct. Other people have cried
out against its “unlawfulness,”
and “refusal” to have witnesses,
cross-examinations, or evidence.
These claims are all false. The
SFHB allows and encourages all
of the above. However, very few
of us know anything about that
because we do not know anything
about the SFHB. This greatly con-
cerns me because it means that we
do not know anything about how
to prosecute sexual misconduct
on campus even though it hap-
pens here twice as often as it does
nationally. What does that tell
you about the respect that we dis-
play for women? It tells me that
we do not care enough about their
welfare to bother knowing the
ways to assure that they are given
justice after having been incred-
ibly violated.

The fact that people were out-
raged at the SFHB’s ability to
expel people tells me that sexual
assault doesn’t mean as much to
us as a “normal” honor violation.
It is ﬁne to expel people for cheat-
ing, but it is unacceptable to ex-
pel people for violating others in
the most personal ways possible?
Where is the honor in that?

Women at W&L are left out of
any type of honor system that pro-
tects their personal safety, which
is the type that we need. Frankly,
I am tired of having to lock my
door and monitor how I act be-
cause the students around me
only care about offenders who lie,
cheat or steal. I am tired of people
defending the words “pretentious
slut” because it “wasn’t meant” to
be sexist or to threaten anyone.

I am really tired of listening
to people outrage about “unjust
tribunals” when they should be
outraged that we need a board
speciﬁcally to deal with sexual
misconduct towards women. Ev-
ery time we, the students, redeﬁne
the honor system into a smaller
realm which ﬁts our needs and
does not hold us accountable for
anything, we are hurting our-
selves. But usually, we are hurt-
ing women on campus the most.

It is time for us to realize that
there is more to honor than what
is in the rules. Honor should be
more than that. It should be a
lifestyle, rather than a Monday
through Friday obligation. It
should be something that we are
proud of; it should be a distin-
guishing factor of our lives, in-
stead of a distinguishing aspect of
our school work.

Musical promises flair

Cast and crew bring twists to familiar production

By Celeste Cruz-carandang
surr WRITER

Washington and Lee theater
promises “Murder, intrigue and
famel” in its own production of
Little Shop of Horrors. From
May 22 until May 25, the show
will be running in Keller The-
atre.

Although a well-known mu-
sical, the play promises to be a
unique and thrilling experience.
This will not be the average high
school production.

Little Shop tells the story of
Seymour Krelbom. Krelborn is
an overly studious orphan who
ﬁnds a unique opportunity in
Skid Row: Mushnik’s ﬂower
shop.

He meets adventure and
mystery in the form of a man-
eating plant that he names aﬂer
his crush and co-worker Audrey
Fulquard. I

This ironically named Au-
drey II has an odd penchant
for both human ﬂesh and show
tunes. He begins to sing for his
supper and consume various
characters in the play. Krelborn
begins to lose control of Audrey
II and himself.

Audiences will be on the edge
of their seats as they wait to see
who gets Audrey ﬁrst: Audrey II
or Krelbom.

Despite the familiar play, the
cast and crew ensure that this
will be quite an exceptional ex-
perience. Kimber Wiggs, a cast

member, revealed, “The costum-
ing is fantastic. And musically,
everyone can look forward to
that Josh Harvey ﬂair‘ as he
leads our band.” Harvey seems
to be adding a lot of musical
ﬂair by updating the songs and
the score. Another cast member,
Sarah Warsco, said, “We have
done a lot to make this produc-
tion unique. In particular, we
have really put our own twist
on the ﬁnale. Also, the band has

describing another unique twist.

Although the addition of new
elements made the schedule
hectic, all members of the show
seemed to have worked well to-
gether. The cast, the stage and
technical crew and the dance
ensemble were able to integrate
their parts in a harmonious and
intriguing fashion.

According to Francisco, the
extensive rehearsals were an
important part of integrating the

vey ﬂair as he leads our band. ”

 _

really updated the music and in-
corporated more modern styles
into the musical.”

The director, Professor
Kimberly Jew, also helped to
encourage a revolutionary in-
terpretation of all parts. Samara
Francisco, a member of the en-
semble, said, “All of the actors
have brought something unique
to their characters. They em-
braced the stories of their char-
acters and deliver very convinc-
ing performances.

“Unlike other productions,
the director wanted to incorpo-
rate more elements into animat-
ing the plant,” Francisco added,

elements of the show: “Perhaps
the hardest part of the musical is
how many elements make up the
production. But that is why re-
hearsals with all the performers
and crew members are so essen-
tial:They let you see any glitches
that may not have been notice-
able when only one element of
the production was present.”
Surprisingly enough, the play
has been in rehearsal since Win-
ter term. Wiggs, who has been
featured in both Little Shop and
the One Acts, contrasts the two
shows. “For one thing, the pro-
cess has been much longer. . .we
started learning music Winter

term. It has also been much

. more intense. One Acts was sort

of laid back, and there were only
four people in our cast. But it’s
also really exciting to be work-
ing on the big stage.”

Francisco comments on the
difference in schedules for the
actors and the dancers. “People
who sing, dance and act...have
been working nonstop for the
past four weeks.”

As one of those fortimate
singers, dancers and actors,
Warsco admits that “as an en-
semble member, the rehearsal
schedule has been fun, frustrat-
ing and a challenge. There are
times when it seems that you
will never get all of your work
done and the musical is taking
over half your life, but at other
times you cannot believe how
much fun you’re having. It’s
hard work, but it’s deﬁnitely
worth it.”

With such an exciting plot
and the hard work of the cast
and crew, Little Shop of Hor-
rors is worth seeing. Any previ-
ous familiarity with the musical
should not keep audiences away.
The directors have strived to en-
courage new interpretations in
all aspects of the show. Even for
those who cringe at the sound
of a Broadway show tune, the
music includes enjoyable rock
elements. All in all, Little Shop
promises a little something for
everyone.

Sophomore Lauren Caire’s _
stellar performance in the
NCAA tournament led the
team to a runner-up fin-
ish. Caire dropped only one

partner junior Katie Tabb.

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

For the fourth consecutive
year, the women’s tennis team
found itself playing for a na-
tional title. For the ﬁrst time,
however, the Generals were
the defending champions.

The team had gone unde-
feated all year and held the
No. 1 ranking throughout
the season. Friday, however,
Williams College ended the
perfect year and captured the
crown in a 5-4 match.

The women started off
strong in the first round with
a win against Hunter, 5-0, in
Monroeville, Pennsylvania.
They went on to compete
against Carnegie Mellon, who
was ranked No. 7.

Fighting against Carnegie
Mellon, the Generals came
away with a fairly simple
win of 5-2. The Generals won
two out of their three doubles
matches, while dropping only

one singles match. Among
the stellar performancers was
sophomore Lauren Caire, who
defeated Carnegie Mellon’s
Kelly Hart 6-0, 6-0. After this
win, the Generals advanced to
the quarterﬁnals in Saint Peter,
Minnesota.

During the quarterﬁnals,
the Generals took down Gus-
tavus Adolphus 5-3 with wins
from Lauren Caire, Leah
Weston and Rebecca Tim-
mis in the singles matches.
In doubles, the Generals were
led to victory with wins from
the teams of Katie Tabb and
Caire, and Virginia Dickinson
and Kelly Will. With this win,
it was on to the semiﬁnals
against Denison.

While up against Deni-
son, the Generals took yet
another victory 5-4. Victories
in this match came from Will,
Weston and Meg Splaitta, in
the singles while in doubles,
the teams of Caire and Tabb,
and freshman Catherine Reed

and Weston defeated Denison
to lead the Generals to their ﬁ-
nal victory in the match.

In the ﬁnal match against
Williams, the Generals nar-
rowly missed repeating their
title, 5-4. Wins came from
Timmis and Splaitta in the sin-
gles games, while the teams of
Tabb and Caire, and Dickin-
son and Will took victories in
the doubles competition.

And so it was on to the in-
dividual singles and doubles
tournament with Tabb and
Caire representing the Gen-
erals. In doubles, the team of
Tabb and Caire defeated Sal-
lie Katter and Kasey Kuenzli
of Linﬁeld College. In singles,
Tabb and Will both were
defeated in the ﬁrst round.
Meanwhile, Caire defeated
Chapman University’s Eliza-
beth Lewis to advance to the
second round. There, Caire
topped Leslie Hansen of MIT
easily 6-3, 6-0.

Saturday afternoon, Caire

played Grace Baljon of Wil-
liams in the quarterﬁnals.
Afterwards, Caire and Tabb
played Amy Staloch and Jen-
nifer Chui of Carnegie Mellon
and lost 5-7, 6-3, 4-6.

Despite being unable to
repeat their national title, the
Generals still ﬁnished with
a 28-1 record — one. that no
other team in the country had
this year.

 

James 3rd at nationals

ODAC champion leads W&L to 16th place in ﬁrst NCAA trip since 199]

By Russ Weems
STAFF WRITER

Nathaniel James has built
a name for himself as one of
the best golfers in Division
III. This week, he got to bring
his Washington and Lee team-
mates along to join in the fun.

W&L competed in the
NCAA Division III Golf
Championships held at the
Chateau Elan Resort in Bra-
selton, Ga. The tournament
went from Tuesday to Friday
and featured 35 teams with
180 golfers in total.

Though James, a senior,
has played in the national
tournament before as an indi-
vidual, the entire team quali-
ﬁed this year after capturing
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title.

That title was W&L’s
ﬁrst conference win since
1999, and this was W&L’s
ﬁrst NCAA tournament since
1991.

James took home ODAC
Player of the Year honors and
was also named the confer-
ence’s scholar-athlete of the
year in golf. .

W&L started the ﬁrst round
with a score of 323, or 39 over
par. This was good enough for
22nd out of the 35 teams com-
peting. The Generals trailed
leader La Verne by 33 strokes.
James led the Generals with a
2-over-par 73. This was good
enough for ninth place out
of the 180 competitors. He
trailed leader Scott Harris of
St. John Fisher by 5 strokes.
Sophomore Joe Gibson was
the second best Generals with
a score of 82.

The second round produced
similar results to the ﬁrst for
the Generals. Although they
improved their score by 8
shots, they remained in 22nd
place. James booked another
solid round of 74, moving him
into 6th place overall, trailing

the leader by 8 strokes. Gib-
son recorded the second best
score with a 79.

The Generals had a big
round in the third day of the
tournament. They recorded
the third bestscore of the day
with a 294, just three strokes
back of the best round of the
day, posted by Methodist.

The score was good enough
to move the Generals up to
15th. James again posted the
leading round for the Generals
with a l-over 72, moving him
into 3rd place overall.

Even though James had his
best round of the tournament,
the difference for the Generals
was the rest of the team, who
matched James’ impressive
round.

The rest of the team all
scored between 73 and 77, a
big improvement over the pre-
vious two days, when several
members of the team recorded
scores in the 805.

Every member of the team
had his best round of the tour-
nament that day.

The Generals could not
continue the momentum into
the ﬁnal round on Friday and
remained relatively unchanged
in the team standings.

They dropped one place
and ﬁnished the tournament
16th of the 35 teams after re-
cording a ﬁnal round score of
308. W&L ﬁnished with a to-
tal team score of 1240 (+104)
which left them 48 strokes
back of 1st place St. John’s. A

James again showed con-
sistency with a ﬁnal round
score of 73. His 4-day total of
292 tied him for 3rd place out
of the 180 individual competi-
tors.

Brad Watts ﬁnished 70th,
Gibson 87th, Tim Gavr-
ich 106th, and Matt Langan
110th.

Giving back: a W&L tradition

From community tutoring to Derby Days to Volunteer Venture, students are involved

By Rosemary Kelley
8 TA F F W R IT E R

The year has ended and the
Washington and Lee commu-
nity has once again excelled in
reaching out and giving back.

Ghandi’s message inspires
our student service leaders to
“be the change they wish to see
for the future.”

Dana Smith, the assistant di-
rector of Student Activities and
Greek Life, said “While we are
a small community, we come
together to support each other
to make a difference in our local
community.”

Student involvement in com-
munity service is pervasive and
ranges across every discipline.

Upon entry to W&L, stu-
dents are immediately given the
opportunity to immerse them-
selves in meaningful service.

The Volunteer Venture pro-
gram, for example, allows
participants to learn about the
needs of some of the poorest
Southeastern communities.

Upperclassmen students
who want to enrich the experi-
ence for others lead these trips
for entering freshmen. These
trips work to enhance the char-
acter of the involved students,
providing a hands-on way to
help others.

Traveling to Roanoke,
Greensboro, Washington D.C.
and eastern rural Kentucky and
staying in Lexington provide
each new student the oppor-
tunity to sacriﬁce time to help
others.

Tutoring students of Rock-
bridge County schools in sub-
jects from English to math-
ematics is another way W&L
students~activcly participate in
the community.

The incoming Rockbridge
County tutoring volunteer co-
ordinator, Celeste Cruz-Caran-
dang believes that we are role
models for those involved.

She said, “In mentoring, we
create a sense of focus and re-
sponsibility among the students

hclpcd. By providing this ser-
vice in all areas of study at all
age levels, we inspire those
helped to provide the same ef-
forts for the future.”

The Greek organizations also
provide ample opportunities to
give back.

Phi Epsilon and Kappa Alpha
Theta partnered to host a bas-
ketball tournament, and Pi Beta
Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma
hosted a carwash beneﬁting the
Rockbridge Area Transportation
System (RATS).

Sororities and fraternities

“While we are a small community, we come

together to support each other to make a dif-

ference in our local community. ”

DANA SMITH, Assistant Dlrector of Student Actlvltles and

Greek Llfe

Just this semester, large
sums of money were raised by
Greek organizations in the name
of charity.

Sigma Chi’s Derby Days was
a week-long philanthropic ﬁeld
day involving all ﬁve sororities.
Kappa Kappa Gamma threw a
volleyball tournament, Sigma

also provide hundreds of hours
of service throughout the rest of
the school year. For example, a
carnival is hosted in the fall for
local children.

National service organiza-
tions have also achieved im-
mcnse success at W&L. Several
local efforts include Habitat for

Humanity, First Book, Up ‘Til
Dawn and the Campus Kitchens
Project.

Our First Book chapter held
a speed read for an entire week
to raise money to buy books
for Natural Bridge Elementary
School.

Habitat for Humanity has
raised thousands of dollars and
volunteered hundreds of labor
hours to build houses for Rock-
bridge County.

The local Up ‘Til Dawn
chapter raised over $20,000 this
year for St. Jude’s Children’s
Research Hospital.

Begun in 2006, W&L’s Cam-
pus Kitchens Project provides
nutritious meals to local agen-
cies, non-proﬁts and individual
homes throughout the commu-
nity.

On a philanthropic level, our
students raise thousands of dol-
lars for charity.

The organization, Students
Against Rockbridge Area Hun-
ger hosts a Lip ‘Sync event ev-

ery winter term.

W&L also has groups that
provide service to the intema-
tional community.

Several religious organiza-
tions take service trips to im-
povcrished countries. Last year,
RUF went to Peru to build a
community center that would
house a church, a school, an
after—school program, and
clinic. -

This year, GCF went to Be-
quia to build _a house for the pas-
tor of a church for the village.
CCM hosted an acoustic eve-
ning to raise funds for the sister

parish of St. Patrick’s Catholic.

Church in Haiti.

Moreover, Project Nicaragua
travels every spring break to as-
sist in the poorest village com-
munitics on the east coast of the
country.

tion for International Learning,

Tragedy, trauma, and denial Faculty debate free SPGGCH, Sex

Campus controversy encourages meaningful discussion

Davis shares, discusses introspection into WWII atomic bombings

By Jamle Klm
srmr wmran

Trauma aﬁbrds us the valuable
opportunity to learn something
about ourselves, said Walter Davis,
visiting professor from Ohio State
University.

In a speech held in the Science
Center last Thursday, Davis began
his speech by describing a picture
that he saw when he was in the sev-
enth grade. The picture featured a
baby with a deformed face and dis-
torted limbs.

He said, “I was so arrested by
that image. There was something
between image and word that was
incompatible.”

Davis went on to discuss the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki during World War II. He
argued that while the official rea-
sons for dropping atomic bombs
on Japan was to end- the war and
save lives, the real reasons were
disguised.

According to Davis, the real
motivations were “to avenge Pearl
Harbor, to create a laboratory to
study the aﬁer-elfect of the bomb,
to justify the amount of money
spent on the bomb and to impress
the Russians during the Cold War.”

Davis believes this truth has
been repressed for a long time,
and many people still do not know
about it. ‘

“You can disprove a myth, but
that doesn’t mean it won’t live on
because myth serves an ideological
function,” he said.

After a few moments of silence,
Davis threw rhetorical questions
to the audience: “What was the
bomb? What did it signify as a hu-
man event? What did that mean?”

“The use of the bomb was im-
plicit in its invention,” he said,
quoting Robert Oppenheimer, a

physicist who was the science di-
rector of the Manhattan Project.
“The human mind had been able
to unlock the secrets of nature and
turn them into the human expres-
sion of power.”

After the war, many people suf-

fered from trauma and believed
that closure was necessary in order
to overcome that trauma, said Da-
vis.
He argued that those individu-
als have ill will toward tragic ex-
periences and think that they are
always abhorrent.

“That usually is a ﬂight from
those experiences. You can blind
yourself to reality in willful ways,”
he said. “We run away from our-
selves.”

Freshman Granvil George ex-
pressed a different opinion abou
Davis’s statement. '

“I think Davis made a valid
point that modern society avoids
confronting trauma,” he said, “but
his statements that closure is not
important were contradicted‘ by his
position that we must acknowledge
and use trauma — that is ‘actual-
ly probably the most effective form
of closure.”

Freshman Diane Tran agreed
that closure doesn’t necessarily
mean that trauma is being avoided.

“Closure, to me, simply is the
deﬁnitive moment where you make
the decision that the trauma is no
longer going to overtake your life,”
she said.

“I do agree, however, that
trauma should be confronted with
boldness and it most certainly pro-
vides an opportunity to learn about
ourselves, even though trauma is
not something I would wish on
anyone.”

Davis then opened the ﬂoor to
discussion. ‘

One audience member rebutted
Davis’s previous mention of the
reasons for dropping the atomic
bombs. He acknowledged Davis’s
four “real” reasons, but he also
supported the “official” reasons of
ending the war and saving lives.

“We should never use a weap-
onry that we don’t know what its
consequence is going to be,” he
said, “but I think you should walk
around the whole thing.”

He explained that being too
extreme on one side is not very
helpful to convince many people.
“There is some middle ground that
we have to walk upon,” he said.

Davis agreed but drove his own
point further.

“Any time you deny something,
you’re going to do it again,” he
said.

“Perception is learned. The
more you let those perceptions into
your consciousness, the less likely
it’s going to happen again in the
future.” _.

Freshman Victor Jackson said
that he was able to grapple with the
opinions and thoughts that Davis
was giving in a more casual discus-
sion format. « '

“While my views haven’t
changed much — I’ve always

thought the atomic bombing of

Japan was an atrocity — I feel like
I understand my views better, and
understand the overall point better,
that we as a nation are tragically
overlooking moral issues we have
faced in the past and are slowly
buckling under the strain of hav-
ing these things on our conscious-
ness.”

contlnued from page 1

“How can the community learn acceptable and
unacceptable behaviors if big, scandalous events
are always covered by half-bits of information,
innuendo, behind-the-scenes measures, and a
lack of consistent, public information?” Mayock
asked in her post.

Students as well as faculty have been allowed
to contribute to the forum, and many have ap-
plauded this opportunity.

“Just because the governing bodies on campus
have heard their cases doesn’t mean that the prob-
lem is solved,” Regina Mills said. “In this forum,
people can express their full opinions without
fear of misrepresentation or having their argu-
ments weakened or misunderstood by editing.”

Like many contributors to the forum, Mills
contrasts “Speaking Freely” with the arena of
discussion provided by campus newspapers.

“It extends past the limited circulation of stu-
dent publications,” she said. “Its more focused
goal allows for more nuanced discussion. A
newspaper has to go on to new things; it can’t
be peddling the same news about the Bracket in
December.” <

Going beyond the issue of free speech, Mills
would like to see the forum facilitate change
on campus. “The real goal is to see this passion
about changing our campus, whether it is the hor-
rendous gender issues in everyday campus life or
the anti-intellectualism outside of the classroom,
put into action.”

several international efforts. This past week they
fundraised for Burmese cyclone victims and the
Chinese Red Cross.

Another student group, Action.Change.To-
morrow (ACT) hosted the Guns ‘N Dolls con-
cert. The concert was aimed at raising awareness
about the use of children as soldiers in Uganda’s
civil war.

A cornerstone of the community service effort‘

on campus is Nabors Service League.

The organization was founded in honor of J on-
athan Nabors, a W&L student who was killed in a
car crash on I-81 in January 1999. His classmates
established the service league after his death.

NSL is the service organization that not only
performs service on campus and in the commu-
nity, but also aims to connect the W&L student
population to a variety of community service and
philanthropic events.

Jenna Walls, a member ofNSL, believes com-
munity service is immensely. powerful and. af-

fords the volunteer personal satisfaction like no
other. I

She said, “As students of Washington and Lee,
we are all given opportunities and experiences
that others do not receive at other schools and in
other communities. I think it is extremely impor-
tant to give back to the community of Rockbridge
County. We have the ability to get involved at so
many levels, any interest you have, you can ﬁnd
others within our university who share the same
interest.”

She added, “In working with other students
on community service efforts, I receive so much
pleasure out of helping others, viewing their hap-
piness, and uniting my fellow students to partici-
pate in the community.”

General connection:
ubiquitous alumni

You can ’t escape alumni once you enter the real world

By Grace Andrews
c 0 L u M N I s T

Just the other day, I was talk-
ing to a ﬁiend who went to New
York City on a trip. While there,
he ran into another person who
happened to have graduated

, from here a few years ago.

Now wait, before you disre-
gard my delightfully little anec-
dotal story, this episode exempli-
ﬁes my point. My friend ran into
this alum in an elevator in some
random apartment complex in
New York City. Now in a city
full of millions of people, what
are the chances that he would
run into a former student of our
prestigious institution?

My friend Jamila has a simi-
lar story, except hers takes place
in North Carolina at the doctor’s
ofﬁce. Apparently, she was
wearing a W&L sweatshirt dur-
ing her visit and when the doctor
saw it, he commented on how he
also went to W&L.

Now this wasn’t some rinky
dink doctor with a stethoscope
and Clark Kent glasses. No,
this doctor was the head sur-
geon and he insisted that Jamila
contact him if she were to ever
need anything. Doesn’t that just
sound too good to be true?

I can’t help but wonder how
many times I tell people that I at-
tend W&L and then get a blank
stare in response. Alter telling
them about W&L, they usually
ask if it’s in Washington, D.C.,
then they ask if it’s William &

Mary. So, how is it that alums
seem to come out of the wood-
work at the randomest moments,
when most people don’t even
know we exist?

I would bet my beloved right
foot that you, the reader, have
encountered similar situations.
I promise,‘ it feels like the other
day I was walking by a tree and
it told me that it was a W&L
alum. . .Ok, so maybe trees can’t
talk or go to school, but if they

attempt to get her attention,
throws a few leaves in her direc-
tion. Graciella, thinking it’s the
wind, keeps moving.

Suddenly, the tree feels as if
an opportunity to share a mo-
ment with a current student is
passing by, so it commences to
beat Graciella with its branches.
Graciella, in a state of terror,
runs far, far away. In her mind,
a tree tried to physically assault
her. She may now develop a

In a city full of million of people, what are

the chances he would run into a former stu-

dent? I feel that after graduating from here,
I ’ll be more connected than Cingular/AT&T

could, they would be here.

My friend and future alum,
the tree, would probably sit in
the back of the class in order to
not obscure anyone’s line of vi-
sion. Upon graduating, said tree
would return to his-or-her (what
sex is a tree?) its home, in a for-

est or nicely wooded area. Once '

home, it would spread the word
of the greatness that is W&L to
any shrub, bush or blade of grass
that would be willing to listen.
One day, an individual, let’s
name her Graciella, happens to
walk by wearing a lovely W&L
zip-up hoodie. The tree, in an

phobia about trees.

However, in the tree’s mind,
it shared a special instant with a
Dubyaneller. Surely, that young
woman must have understood
the bond that they share. Clear-
ly, W&L creates all sorts of great
people and plants. These people
go on to do various things in
their lives, such as running into
current students.

Not only are our alums plen-
tiful, but most of them are gener-
ous and enthusiastic about giving
current students opportunities.

Now I don’t know about you, ,

but I’m not much for having

connections and networks, but
I feel that after graduating from
here, I’ll be more connected then
Cingular/AT&T and more “in”
then Verizon.

It’s for this reason that ahnost
every time I travel, I wear'some-
thing with the school’s crest, let-
ters, etc. Just in case I run into
any alum, they already know
what school I attend as a result
of my luscious W&L parapher-
nalial

It’s even gotten to the point
where I believe that if extra-
terrestrial life were to be dis-
covered, we would soon ﬁnd
out they had W&L diplomas.
They would probably even be
c—school graduates; maybe busi-
ness or economics majors since
there seem to be a lot of them.

I Scientists say that if a nuclear
war occurred, only cockroaches
and Cher would survive. I am
now amending that statement to
include alums from our school.
If they can’t make it and come
out on top, nothing or no one
can: '

So here’s my point. As the
school year comes to an end, I
encourage everyone, especially
the seniors, to look back on the
year you’ve had and smile.

Congratulations, you’re one
step closer to being an all-pow-
erful W&L alum. Soon, you shall
join those elite ranks, amongst
great women, interesting men

and the occasionally exceptional

tree !

Mark of excellence

Treasure W&L for more than academic opportunities

By crlghton Allen
c o LU M N I s T

I would love a chance to end
the year on a positive note and
take stock, for just a second, of
the wonderful thing we all share
here at W&L.

I love that I can use the word
share there and not be trite. Be-
cause really, we all bear the mark
of a member of W&L.

Everything that happened this
year, good and ill, has all swirled
together inside each one of us
and left an indelible impression,
one that I am sure will make us
better people than the ones who
came here on September I.

I myself have just gone
"through my freshman year, and
what a year it has been! I have
learned more about myself than
I could have ever thought I had
left to ﬁnd out.

Along the way I met some
characters whose impact will
stay with me throughout the rest
of my life. Characters like Jeffer-
son Davis Futch III and Chuckie
Fleischmann who have made me

think and laugh, respectively,

more deeply than I have ever
known; if you have yet to. met
either of these men, I urge you in
the strongest terms to do so with
all possible haste. It will be well
worth your time.

There is a Facebook group
called “You Know you go to
W&L if...” It has a lot of funny
lines in it such as “You have at
least one ridiculous story from
Tear Night” or “You know your
way around town based on loca-
tion relative to Davidson Park,
Red Square, or Dominoes.”

Both of these may be, and quite
possibly are, very true, but I do
not think that they are what best
identiﬁes a W&L student.

No, what makes the time here
worth the while and most makes
a W&L student a W&L student
is the rich plethora of interac-
tions everyone is privileged to
enjoy every day with the people
of our school.

Before he was martyred in

sight of what makes this school
unique.

At the end of the day, a W&L
student may have a perfect GPA,
earn an All-ODAC First-Team
Award, and be president of every
club they join; all those things
are good and desirable, but they
don’t make a W&L student.

To “know you go to W&L”
takes much more than all these
things.

To know you go to W&L... takes knowing a

professor who inspires you to ﬁnd your life s

calling, ﬁnding a friend who will lay it all on

the line for you, and meeting a personable

security guard with whom you have profound

conversations at 2.'45a.m.

the third century, St. Lawrence
declared that the people of the
Church were its greatest trea-
sures, not the jewels in the trea-
sury.

Nowhere can these wise
words be more applicable than
right here.

This is a place where, all too

oﬁen, most of us, myself in-

cluded, spend far too much time
prizing our jewels rather ouritrue
treasures.

Whether it be up-striving
for a higher ranking in the US.
News & World Report or stu-

‘ dents burning themselves out for

a higher GPA, people here lose

It takes ‘knowing a professor
who inspires you to ﬁnd your
life’s calling, ﬁnding a friend
who will lay it all on the line for
you, discovering that one guy or
gal you just can’t get out of your
mind, and meeting a personable
security ofﬁcer with whom you
have profound conversations at
2:45 a.m.

The community we share
here is made by the people who
live together within a fabric of
honor knitted together by none
other than Robert Edward Lee.

How lucky we are to be the
great benefactors of his vision!
Let us then cast aside all ill will

that we may bear towards each
other for offences great and
small.

Wounds inﬂicted by things
like the bracket and list may take
a long time toheal, but nolone
does hirri or herself or W&L at
large any good by letting them
take control the school’s focus.

Instead, let us come together
in recognition of what we all
have going for us by being mem-
bers of a community with such
truly priceless treasures.

This year, and every. year,
we lose some of these treasures

-- the seniors -- in the form of -

graduation.

To them I tip my hat for a
job remarkably well done. It is
my sincerest hope that no matter
what they go on to do with their
lives, the treasures they have
found here remain to them as
bright as the day they were ﬁrst
discovered. _

In writing all this, I do not
mean to sound like an admis-
sions ofﬁce pledge whose task
it is to compose pamphlet-grade
literature—far from it.

But if you take a long min-
ute and think back on your time
here, I think that you will come
to agree with me.

When we all go our separate
ways this summer, let us not tell
others of our strife and discord
but rather of the people here who
have touched us.

Only by embracing and ap-
preciating them can we all here
at W&L come intolthe rich in-
heritance we were all meant to
share in together.

lime for the Phi to turn over new leaf

Top editor leaves, bids new editors to look deeper, hold leaders accountable

Bylacob Geiger
MANAGING EDITOR

l’ve spent the last three years
chasing stories. It’s really as sim-
ple as that.

Some of the stories have been
a blast to write and report. Others
have left plenty of people pretty
mad at me.

The Staff Editorial I wrote on
May 12 was the latest in a long
line of bylines that have led to
angry e-mails.

I hope that the new crop of
editors will let me keep stirring
things up on occasion.

For now, however, it’s time
for me to let new writers and edi-
tors chase the stories that matter

with many talented journalists
during my time at the Phi.

I was lucky to learn from
Emily Hulen and Kat Greene,
my two predecessors. Those

‘teachers at W&L, showing me

how to run a paper and chase a

For the last I8 months, l’ve
enjoyed working with some of
the most talented editors this pa-
per has seen in a long time. Peo-
ple like Stacey Grijalva, Michael

been the real heart of this paper,

stories, columns and pictures
to put on the pages each week.
They’ve done most of the nitty—
gritty work in the last two years,
and I am deeply in their debt.

Jess served as the editor for
every single section before even-

tually ﬁnishing her term as the
Assistant Managing Editor. I
couldn’t have done this job with-
out her help and support.

Stacey has been an editor al-
most as long as I have, turning
the Opinions section into her

turned him into the sports editor.

Hate speech proposal rewritten to explain restricted slurs

Other changes involve banning speech only on W&L facilities, deterring accidental and future violations

By John B. Martin
Joseph M. Yahr

We, the authors of this letter,
are writing to inform students,
faculty and staff of an updated
proposal to address serious con-
duct issues at Washington and
Lee University.

Mr. Martin, one of the au-
thors, submitted a proposal to
the Student Affairs Committee
at the beginning of this semester
to implement a policy to address
deeply harmful verbal conduct
known as hate speech.

The original proposal pro-
motes the adoption of a com-
plete prohibition of hate speech
among all members of the uni-
versity community; in the same
manner as current prohibitions
of harassment, assault and other
forms of misconduct.

This proposal, while already
sensitive to issues of speech,
process, and other policies, has
been supported by some but op-
posed among others.

The other author of this piece,
Mr. Yahr, was among those who
expressed his opposition to the
initial proposal by writing an
editorial in the Law News and
encouraging others to join him
in opposition.

One of us has felt that racist,
sexist, and homophobic slurs,
epithets, and other hate speech
ﬁnd virtually no protection un-
der the rubric of free speech and
are freely proscribable, at any
rate, because of the university’s
compelling need to prevent ha-
rassment, violence and the other
documented harms that hate
speech brings to our community.

The other has asserted that no
regulation of hate speech should
be permitted because it would
unduly burden the expression
of student and faculty views and
possibly duplicate an implied
prohibition of this conduct found
in existing policies.

Yet even as our disagreement
continued, nothing has been done
to bring about the diminution
and eventual end of hate speech
at W&L. This, we agree, will not
do. Given the considerable dis-
agreement this matter has engen-
dered, we recognize that neither
absolute view can provide a way
forward.

Therefore, we-put forth a new

proposal to address the continu- ,

ing and pervasive use of hate
speech in our community.

The proposal can be found
online at http://www.wluoutlaw.
blogspot.com/ (before continuing
further, we strongly recommend
that the reader view the proposal
in its entirety as reproduced on
the site). We offer our unquali-
ﬁed support to this proposal and
urge the SAC to adopt the same
immediately.

We now call all members of
our university together, includ-
ing those of opposing views, to
a resolution rooted in the truest
form of our institutional prin-
ciples.

Rather than detail every pro-
vision of the policy, which again
we urge the reader to do, we will
highlight some major changes
from the previously existing pro-
posal. The ﬁrst is the creation of
restrictions upon the place and
manner of the conduct at issue,
rather than a complete ban on

hate speech. The proposal for-
bids students, faculty and staff
to .write or utter hate speech in a
facility owned or operated by the
university. The provision arises
from the need of the university
to prevent harassment, violence,
declines in academic perfor-
mance, declines in on-campus
employment performance and
the diminution of the bonds of
trust that our community holds.
clear, all of which have been

are likely to face consistent deg-
radation, lowered academic per-
formance and emotional harm as
a condition of completing their
education.

At the same time, our re-
spect for the preservation of
free expression has caused us to
preserve the ability to use hate
speech among students outside
the bounds of university facili-
ties. Students, faculty, and staff
would be essentially free to use

The overall purpose is to conﬁne the reach of

the policy to the “worst of the worse ” of ver-

bal conduct which are also those mostly likely

to subtract from educational discource.

 

shown, through social science,
to be effects of hate speech.

The university’s interest in
preventing these effects is strong
at all times and places, but this
interest is undoubtedly at its
apex when the university seeks
to guarantee the safety, health
and well—being of students on
the properties that the univer-
sity controls and within which it
carries out its chief educational
mission.

Indeed, one would be hard
pressed to conclude that the uni-
versity can fulﬁll its guarantee of
non-discrimination on the basis
of race, gender, ethnicity or sex-
ual orientation if it effectively
requires its minority students to
enter into facilities in which they

slurs, epithets and clearly de-
rogatory words and phrases on
the basis of the listed categories
when they are not at school, even
in the presence of other members
of the university community.

Thus, even if the narrow
deﬁnitions and procedural safe-
guards in the proposal would
not otherwise exempt a student’s
conduct from the policy’s reach,
the student may still engage in
conduct constituting hate speech
as long as he or she does so on
non-university property.

Our respect for speech values
also explains the second major
aspect of the new proposal: a nar-
rower deﬁnition of hate speech.

Whereas some individuals
found the previous policy to lack

sufﬁcient boundaries to prevent
the capture of valuable expres-
sion, the new version has more
carefully delineated what con-
stitutes hate speech. The overall
purpose of these reﬁned deﬁni-
tions is to conﬁne the reach of
the policy to the “worst of the
worst” of verbal conduct, which
are also those most likely to
subtract from, inﬁnitely more
than they add to, educational
discourse and the civility of the
community. This ensures that the
policy contains a vast zone of
protection for free expression by
limiting the reach of the policy.
The ﬁnal major innovation of
the proposal is the ﬁne balance
of deterrence and process that it
provides invregards to violations
of the policy. Upon a student’s
second violation of the policy,
a conduct body may address the
student’s behavior as it sees ﬁt
to deter future violations by that
student and by other members of
the community. The notice issued
to students for an initial violation
also deters further misconduct by
shining a spotlight, so to speak,
on the continued and harmful in-
cidence of hate speech.
However, the policy also con-
tains more layers of procedural
protection for students than any
other university policy. A student
who has allegedly violated the
policy for the ﬁrst time would re-
ceive only anotice of the report-
ed violation and the chance to
contest the notibe and the report
of the violation, including the op-
portunity for a full hearing. Even
if the notice still stands after
the hearing, the student cannot
face any consequences from a

conduct body. Furthermore, any
student, faculty or staff member
can argue that their conduct does
not fall within the policy’s deﬁ-
nition of hate speech because the
language used has a reasonable,
non-derogatory meaning.

Finally, the proposal urges
conduct bodies and decision-
makers to consider various cir-
cumstances surrounding an in-
cident in determining whether
an individual has violated the
policy. The goal of these proce-
dural protections is to guarantee
fair treatment for all involved.

We wish to conclude by
drawing attention to the connec-
tion between the new proposal
and our institutional values. The
proposal allows for a vigorous
educational environment of open
debate, and it also creates a com-
munity deﬁned by civility, trust
and honor.

Hate speech is inherently dis-
honorable, and it breaks down
the bonds of trust and civility.

While some may believe that
it is essential to the expression
of their views, the most severe
forms of hate speech prevent
others from participating in any
meaningful dialogue, whether
civil or otherwise. The univer-
sity environment upon which we
pride ourselves cannot endure
long under the inﬂuence of such
behavior..

We ask the SAC to pass this
policy, set an effective date for
the policy and begin a large scale
educational program to inform
students about the policy and the
issues surrounding it to begin no
less than one month prior to the
policy’s effective date.

Student government, not SF HB, should decide conduct cases

Also, W&L has done more than enough to encourage, protect women; fears of aggressive drunks not limited to Lex«

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to
an editorial by Catherine Kruse
in last week’s Ring-Tum Phi.
Though the Phi has always rep-
resented some extreme view-
points, I found Catherine Kruse’s
editorial particularly ridiculous.
In her piece, “Make honor into a
lifestyle,” Ms. Kruse argues that
W&L “does not treat its women
well enough to be considered
average [in comparison to other
college campuses].” Kruse goes
on to explain that the recent
complaints against the Student
Faculty Hearing Board’s “Tri-
dent Bracket” trial are complete-
ly unsound because “very few of

us know anything about that [the
SFHB]. . .” Maybe it’s Ms. Kruse
who doesn’t know anything
about student government.

The complaints that Kruse
dismisses regard the SFHB’s
ability to prosecute students in
secret tribunals on ﬂimsy charg-
es ﬁled by anonymous plaintiffs
who aren’t even required to tes-
tify even in such cases where the
verdict could mean expulsion for
the accused.

Perhaps Kruse, a freshman,
is unaware that thissort of thing
used to be considered an assault
on traditional W&L student gov-
ernment. That a secret panel of
appointed faculty members and
indirectly elected students can

expel W&L students on “conduct
unbecoming of a gentleman”
is an abomination. Such cases

that constitutes “conduct unbe-
coming...” In my opinion we
didn’t even need the politically

The university has a number of judicial bodies

whose sole purpose is the protection of W&L

women. How can one conclude that W&L does

not treat its women well enough to be considered

average?

 

should be heard by the directly
elected, student—run Executive
Committee who already has the
power to expel students convict-
ed of sexual assault/harassment

motivated sexual assault addi-
tion to the White Book.

Besides the fact that W&L
has a female athletic director, a
female dean of students (who’s

also now “vice president for stu-
dent affairs”), as well as numer-
ous women in various positions
of power, women make up 51
percent of the undergraduate stu-
dent body. The university has a
number of extracurricular activi-
ties and judicial bodies whose
sole purpose is the protection of
W&L women. How can one con-
clude that W&L “does not treat
its women well enough to be
considered average”?

Regarding the rest of Kruse’s
remarks about how W&L wom-
en “have to watch their backs”
from aggressive drunks, how is
that any different from anywhere
else on this planet? Lexington
being an earthly, imperfect place,

there will always be unfortunate,
unacceptable things that hap-
pen when bad people drink too
much. That’s why we have a jus-
tice system.

Maybe something Kruse
should consider is that W&L men
also live in fear of their black-out
drunken coeds. Sometimes a girl
will arrive at a fraternity party
ﬂagrantly intoxicated, proceed to
vomit all over the place, pass out
in a place of residence, and then
wake up in the morning wildly
throwing around malicious accu-

‘sations. To borrow Ms. Kruse’s,

words, “it happens more often
than anyone will admit.”

KEVIN REMINGTON FOR W&L

-Cast of Little Shop of A Horrors shines in a disturbingly hilarious performance

By Celeste Cruz-carandang
STA F F W R I T E R

Washington and Lee theater
put on a glittering performance of
Little Shop of Horrors last Thurs-
day evening, followed by three
more shows.

Full of unexpected and clever
twists, Little Shop delivered all
the “Murder, intrigue, glamour
and fame” it promised.

The entire program was an im-
pressive example of elegant act-
ing, energetic choreography and
ﬂawless voices, with a technical
crew that rivals the most experi-
enced of backstage staffs. Even
under the pressure of opening
night, the cast of Little Shop put
together an exciting and moving
performance.

The performance consisted of
ﬁfteen musical numbers. A band,
led by Josh Harvey, accompanied
the cast. These songs told the
dynamic story of Seymour Krel-
born.

While working in Mushnik’s
Flower Shop, Krelbom, an awk-
ward and shy orphan, cultivates
another plant species. Krelbom
ﬁnds out that his new plant, has
a dangerous penchant for human
ﬂesh. Ironically, he names the
plant after his co-worker and se-
cret crush, Audrey.

Audrey II, puppeteered by

Tim Kirby and with the voice of
Markheavens Tshuma, tempts
Krelbom into feeding it murdered
bodies. Orin Scrivello, Audrey’s
dangerous dentist boyfriend, was
the ﬁrst of Audrey II’s and Krel-
bom’s victims. Mr. Mushnik, and
Audrey follow Scrivello soon af-
ter. It was not until the death of
the woman he loved that Krelbom
fully realizes the gravity of his ac-
tions and the depth of his greed.
Under the direction of Profes-
sor Kimberly Jew and the musical
direction of Josh Harvey and Pro-
fessor Jerry Myers, the musical
went beyond the ﬂashy numbers
and cheery dance sequences char-
acteristic of Broadway musicals.
Instead, the cast and company
performed the rock numbers with
a deﬁnite edge and unique ﬂair.
Johnny Coyle, as always, de-
livered a poignant and clever per-
formance as Seymour Krelbom.
The perfect blend of sweetness,
shyness and quirkiness, Coyle
portrayed a lovable character put

‘under the worst of circumstances.

Coyle made an interesting
choice in conveying the transfor-
mation of his character. Rather
than portraying Krelbom as a
good man turning into an avari-
cious monster, Coyle allowed the
reticence and confusion of his
character to shine through. His
voice, although not as strong as

some of his fellow actors, capti-
vated the audience with its genu-
ine emotion.

Nicole Conkling played Au-
drey, Seymour’s na'1've yet big-
hearted crush. Her portrayal of
the female lead went beyond the
superﬁcial characteristics of her
character.

Like Coyle, Conkling gave
Audrey more depth then some of
the songs allowed her. Conkling’s
ﬂawless soprano transformed the
character from an irrational ﬂake
to a woman whose dreams have
been stolen by the dangers of
Skid Row.

Mr. Mushnik, played by Rob
Mish, was a surprisingly dynamic
character. Thanks to the wit and
ﬁnesse of Mish, Mushnik was a
villain the audience could love.
At times, Mish made the ﬂower
shop owner to be almost father-
ly. In other numbers, Mushnik
became a scheming tyrant. Yet.
Mish made sure to always deliver
a solid and extraordinary perfor-
mance.

Matt Amling lent his voice to
the slightly sadistic Orin Scriv-
ello. His rendition of “Dentist!”
was both fun and disturbing.
Indeed, his entire performance
maintained this.alarming balance.
While his voice was idyllic and
almost angelic, his performance
successfully conveyed an evil and

mysonginistic ﬁgure.

The members of the Trio, Kim-
ber Wiggs, Marquita Robinson,
and A’rese Emokpae lent their
strong voices to the background
and narration of the show.

While their voices were strong
and blended well, the chaos ofthe
ﬁrst performance may have taken
some toll on their choreography.
Although obviously talented, their
dancing was not always synchro-
nized. Despite some differences

  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 

with the choreography, the Trio
delivered a strong, performance.
They did not only hchieve coher-
ence as a group, but were also
able to create individual charac-
ters.

Finally, Audrey II was the
voice of temptation. Both Kirby
and Tshuma created a true charac-
ter from a puppet. Sassy, dark and
hungry, Audrey II came alive with
the skills of both of these talented

young men.

The cast and crew of Little
Shop of Horrors performed a
stunning rendition of the classic
Broadway hit. Although hindered
by a few difﬁculties, the majority
of which may be attributed to the
jitters of opening night, the audi-

, ence was both moved and excited

by the performance. With all the
hard work of the actors and stage
crew, they all deserved a standing
ovation.

J ammin’ at the Creek  

 

MORGAN HARRIS / saff hotographer

Outdoors at Zo|lman’s Pavilion, Buffalo Creek attendees dance and groove to the tunes of the bands. Bands
played on Friday evening and all day on Saturday. Students and Lexington residents came and went throughout
the weekend, some choosing to camp on the grounds.

Crowds relax to music and more at Buﬂalo Creek

By Eric Hamscher
STAFF WRITER

This past weekend at Buﬁialo Creek
served as the ﬁnal opportunity for Washing-
ton and Lee students to forget about school.

In the midst of blaring music, the Creek
reminded visitors that W&L continues to
fulﬁll its renowned ‘work hard, play hard’
mentality.

Buffalo Creek Music Festival is held an-
nually at Zollman’s Pavilion.

The barn was jam-packed for perfor-
mances by The Bridge, the Hackensaw
Boys, BlueGround UnderGrass, Outfor-
mation, Big Sam’s Funky Nation, Nathan
Moore, the Benevento Russo Duo, Gary
Ruley and Mule Train, and Farm Vegas.

Judging by the rest of the activities going
on, some people probably did not even real-
ize there were bands.

Outside, a mix of out-of-towners and stu-
dents enjoyed each other’s company around
over a dozen bonﬁres. Others stumbled
across the open ﬁelds, obviously in search
of better company.

People migrated from camp to camp, try-
ing to take in the best of what Buffalo Creek
had to offer. Many tried new things and had
unprecedented experiences in an environ-
ment like the Country, multiplied by ten.

By the end of Friday night, most every-
one had found what they were looking for.
Many had collapsed in a tent, on top of an
Audi, or even in the ﬁelds ~ seeing stars be-
fore waking up Saturday for two more days
of the weekend’s events.

One W&L student, sophomore Jamie
Goodin, described the festivities as “total
freedom that made for a weekend where
everyone could run around having a great
time.”

And total freedom it was in a secluded
country location where Lexington police ﬁ-
nally seemed to be absent from busting up
the fun.

Campus security officer Baner did an ex-
cellent job insuring that any and all pitbulls
were banned from entrance to the Creek.

The only likely victims from this spring’s
festivities were brain cells — but not enough

to keep most rising seniors from acing the
LSAT. Overall, the event was a great way
for graduating seniors to begin wrapping up
their ﬁnal year at W&L until later returning
to parties as respected alums.

Late Saturday night, for those too worn
out to spend another night camping out at
the Creek, students crowded the street en-
trance in high hopes of boarding Traveller.

For an event as important as Buffalo
Creek, W&L stepped it up to provide stu-
dents with coach buses back to the Quad.
Although many of the drivers were less than
thrilled about Buffalo Creek, they were able
to get most students back to campus by ear-
ly Sunday morning.

Unfortunately, there are always those
few stragglers who get left behind. They are
either not yet accustomed to the Darwinist
mentality of Traveller lines or they just were
not in the right mentality to ﬁnd the bus. Ei-
ther way, some got home and some did not.

Nevertheless, next year’s festival will
hopefully deliver as much craziness and ex-
citement as this year’s.

Barbacoa promises ﬂavor

Caribbean Society to host barbecue with island ﬂair

By John Henderson
sun warren

Ever eaten fried plantains, done the limbo
and performed Bob Marley music all in one
day? Probably not, unless you have already
been to the Caribbean Society’s “Barba-
coa.”

The barbacoa is an event of food, games
and music taking place at Cannan Green
from 4:30 to 7:30 this afternoon. It is free
and open to the public, but the newly formed
Caribbean Society hopes to raise money for
future events with donations. A

Barbacoa was brought to the United
States and became barbeque It is tradition-
ally spicy meat cooked over an open ﬁre.
The Caribbean Society will offer a taste of
jerk chicken, curried shrimp, and meat pies,
as well as fried plantains, sweet potato balls
and ice cream.

There will also be karaoke, cards, domi-
noes, hula hoops and of course, the limbo.
Prizes are being awarded to the best singer
and winner of the most games.

The Caribbean Society was formed this
year by sophomore Kristen-Kaye Goul-
boume and junior Tabitha King. Goul-
boume, who is from Jamaica, wanted to
raise awareness of a part of the world that is
often overlooked or misrepresented.

“I want people to think beyond entertain-
ment and beaches,” she said, adding that
Jamaica and the United States have always
had close political ties. “There is a saying:
if the United States sneezes, Jamaica catches
a cold.”

“The ﬁrst step is to let people know that

the Caribbean is there,” said sophomore and
club secretary Yasmine Espert.

This year, the Caribbean Society raised
money for an orphanage in Barbados at
the Calypso dinner in February and held a
book drive for Caribbean school children in
April.

The Caribbean Society holds regular
meetings and encourages W&L students of
any background to attend.

discussing its politics. Keeling believes Ca-
ribbean ecology has great potential in the
pharmaceutical industry—of the 200 most
commonly used drugs derived from plants,
127 of them grow in Jamaica.

“Jamaica is an extremely rich land,” he
said, citing a study by the Nature Conservan-
cy that showed Jamaica, Cuba and Hispan-
iola to have the highest biodiversity in the
western hemisphere.

“I want people to think beyond entertainment and beaches...

there is a saying: if the United States sneezes, Jamaica

catches a cold ”

The Program in Latin American and
Caribbean Studies, W&L’s newest inter-
disciplinary program, is helping to bring
historical, political and cultural ideas from
the Caribbean to this campus. This spring,
LACS Professors Carey, DeLaney, Dickov-
ick and Eastwood are leading students on a
four-week trip to Barbados and St. Vincent
to study slavery and race relations.

Alumnus David Keeling ’73 is an artist,
writer and Jamaican citizen who comes back
to Lexington once a year to renew his visa.
Keeling is enthusiastic that the W&L com-
munity is taking notice of the Caribbean.

“I like the idea very much because it
builds friendship, it builds understanding,”
he said.

Keeling studied history at W&L and now
enjoys writing about Caribbean history and

Still, there are a great many problems that
the Caribbean nations need to overcome to
move forward, Keeling said. Crime, heavy
drug trafﬁcking, political corruption, vio-
lence and a lack of education are some of the
biggest.

Keeling believes it will take integrity on
the part of Caribbean leaders and economic
development to ﬁx these problems. With
the development of CARICOM, a free trade
zone in the Caribbean, the islands of the Ca-
ribbean will have a chance to do that.

Goulboume and other Caribbean Society
members hope to bring these issues to light
as their club is established. For now, they of-
fer the W&L community music, games, and
a “taste of the Caribbean.”

Shaw and Doornbos place at N CA/ls, break school records

By Kevin Corn
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s track
and ﬁeld team had an outstanding showing
with only two competitors at the Division
III NCAA Championships this past week-
end at the University of Wisconsin Osh-
kosh.

With top 5 ﬁnishes from both juniors
Jess Shaw and Stacy Doombos, the ladies
posted personal bests and even school re-
cords.

In the women’s heptathlon, Doombos
ﬁnished in a stunning third place with a
grand total of 4737 points, less than 400
points behind the winner, a senior from
Messiah College.

On the ﬁrst day, Doombos started off
well with a 15.18 in the 100 meter hur-
dles, tying the school record. In the high
jump, she leapt to a height of 5’2.50” while
throwing a personal record of 33’3.25” in
the shot put. In the last event of the ﬁrst
day, Doornbosmaintained her excellence
by running a time of 25.60 in the 200 meter
dash. ‘

Doombos continued towards her third
place ﬁnish with excellent performances
on the second day, as well. In the long
jump, Doombos leapt l7’4.75” and then
threw the javelin 87’3”. In the last event of
the heptathlon, the 800 meter race, Doom-
bos ran a time of 2:24. 1 6 to secure her third
place ﬁnish.

Doombos’ ﬁnish qualiﬁed her for All-
American Honors as well as a school re-
cord in the heptathlon with her point total.

Shaw competed in the 5,000 meter race
Saturday. Entering the event in 11"‘ place,

Shaw ran a fantastic race to overtake sever-
al runners. With a time of 16:56.78, Shaw
took 5"‘ place, as well as blowing away a
twelve-year-old school record set by Jose-
phine Schaeffer in 1996. Schaeffer’s record
was 17:46.04, meaning Shaw blew it away
by a full ﬁfty seconds.

The Generals wrapped up their season,
and what a season it has been. Countless
records have been broken — from a swim-
mer who decided to run track this year and

broke the 5K record to new school records
in javelin, hammer throw and more. The
track teams have also built up their stand-
ing in the ODACs with a second place ﬁn-
ish from the women and a third place ﬁnish
from the men. Overall, the season has been
very positive for the teams and hints of still
greater prospects in future years.

finished third in the heptathlon.

Graduating Keenan bids farewell  

Michael Keenan looks back at his time as the Phi is sports editor

By Michael Keenan
sPoRrs armor:

It was just a simple request for a few

,pictures. The sports editor of the school

paper asked to use a few shots I had taken
at a cross country meet. I never thought it
would turn into this. Now, almost 50,000
clicks on the camera, 50 articles written
and countless articles assigned as sports
editor later, my dive into journalism has
come to an end.

Division 111 sports offers a unique atmo-
sphere where everyone — coaches, athletes,
fans ~ are involved because they love the
game. College sports provide a palpable
urgency not found in professional sports,
and even more so in Division III. Most D-
I players are going pro in something other
than sports, and this is even more true of
D-III athletes. For most of us, this is our
last chance to compete. For most of us, it
doesn’t matter if we study tonight or to-
morrow night, but if we don’t bring it AND
leave it on the ﬁeld on game day, we’ve
missed our chance. Sports give the four
years of college a here-and-now adrenaline
rush not found in the lecture halls.

Even athletes who know they’re going
pro know there’s something special about
college sports that they can never reclaim.
In a recent interview, Larry Bird said

Magic Johnson beating him in college hurt
more than in the pros and that he’d trade an
NBA championship for a college title. On
the surface, it appears crazy that someone
would give up an NBA championship, the
sign of being on the best team in the world,
for a college title. Yet he still wishes for the
NCAA championship.

One of the perks of taking pictures is
getting the best seats in the house to see that

atmosphere up close ~ for free. I’ve been
run over by Chris McHugh and soaked by
numerous steeplechasers clearing the wa-
ter jump. I ’ve had front row seats to the
revitalization of the football and basketball
teams. I can remember second halves of
football games and the entirety of basket-
ball games where I might be the only one
there. This year, the bleachers stayed full

and, on a few occasions, I could feel the
ﬂoor or the Warner Center tremble. While
W&L hasn’t quite blossomed into a foun-
tain gushing with school spirit, the water’s
been turned on.

Through a camera lens, I’ve seen some
pretty cool events. John Christopher fall-
ing on his back at the ﬁnal horn, exhausted
from grappling with Ursinus’ Matt Wil-
liams but shaking his ﬁsts because his 6-5
victory snapped Ursinus’ 27—match confer-
ence winning streak. I was on the sidelines

when the football team went to the national .

playoffs. Granted, we got beat like the
play-in game winner in the NCAA tour-
nament, but we were still there. I watched
from behind the bench when the team went
on fourth down and one with a minute left
in the ﬁnal game at old Wilson Stadium
against Bridgewater — and got it to run
out the clock. I saw Jessica Shaw, just two
weeks removed from the swim season, run
her ﬁrst collegiate 5,000m at the ODAC
indoor championships and lap the entire
ﬁeld — twice. I've even seen Burr Datz get
kicked out of a basketball game for yelling

at the refs when he thought the fouls were

getting out of hand.

To all the athletes, coaches, teammates
and fans who have made my time cover-
ing W&L sports so special, thanks for the
memories.
