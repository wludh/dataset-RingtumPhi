NUMBER 1

 

 

A former Washington
and Lee student who was
asked to leave school last
spring because of an
honor offense has been
granted a second closed
trial, apparently in re-
sponse to a federal suit
asking for the proceed-
ing, according to a story
which appeared in the
Roanoke Times and
World News yesterday.

Peter Engel of Oakhurst,
N.J., was found guilty of an
honor code violation last May,
four weeks before he was to
graduate, according to the suit
filed last spring in Lynchburg
Federal District Court. The suit
contended Engel’s  constitu-
tional rights of due process had
been violated and asked that he
be reinstated as a student and

 

| given another trial in order to

Student Granted Second
Private Honor Trial

present additional evidence.

Engel confirmed to Roanoke
Times reporter Richard
Lovegrove that University of-
ficials have granted another
private hearing to be conducted
later this month, an almost un-
precedented occurrence in the
history of the school’s honor
system.

Washington and Lee’s honor
system is run by the students.
Members of the student body
Executive Committee are
charged with the duty of hear-
ing reported honor code viola-
tions and generally upholding
the honor system. Honor hear-
ings are closed to the press and
school officials are forbidden to
comment on cases either pen-
ding or resolved.

According to the suit, Engel
was accused of an honor viola-
tion on May 1 and received his
closed trial on May 2. After the
trial, the senior was given a
five-day extension to uncover

further evidence to prove his
innocence—also an_ un-
precedented move. Engel did
not produce the new evidence
until May 8, or later than the ex-
tension allowed for, according
to the suit.

As could be expected in such a
circumstance, University
President Robert E.R. Huntley
and W&L attorney Eric Sisler
declined to comment on the
case, Engel’s attorney, William
O. Roberts, and student body
president Steve Abraham also
refused to comment on the
honor trial.

The Ring-tum Phi has learned
that Engel’s federal suit against
the school has been withdrawn.

The student body Executive
Committee meets Monday at
6:30 p.m. in their room in the
University Center building and
is expected to be questioned
about the status of the case at
that time.

 

 

by John Billmyre

Strict enforcement by police
of Lexington’s noise ordinance
for amplified music seems to
have driven a wedge between
Interfraternity Council
representatives and members
of the Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board.

During the Tuesday evening
meeting many IFC represen-
tatives complained that the IFC
lacks unity and purpose in fac-
ing the city on the noise or-
dinance question.

Six fraternities, Lambda Chi,
Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa
Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi
Kappa Phi and Sigma Nu, have
been served summonses to
court for violating the noise or-
dinance.

Under a rule passed by the
IFC Judicial Board, the elected
body which handles fraternity
discipline, fraternities receiv-
ing summonses will not go
before the IFC Judicial Board
until the fraternity has been to
court.

* Lambda Chi, which received
its summons earlier in the year
than the other houses, has
already been to court and fined
$63.
The Judicial Board decided
not to act on the Lambda Chi
noise violation because it in-
volved individuals living in the
house and making repairs and
not a party. Those individuals

were ordered by the board to
pay the fine.

‘We have no jurisdiction over
the case because it was not a
fraternity function,’ said Syd
Farrar, IFC President.

A special meeting between
Chief of Police James A. Kirby,
City Manager John Doane and
several W&L officials was
scheduled for yesterday.

But it was earlier in the
meeting that tempers flared
and discussion was loud.

Dave Meyers, President of
Phi Kappa Psi, suggested the
IFC hire a local attorney to de-
fend the fraternities in court.

Meyers was arrested on Sept.
8 on a noise ordinance violation.

Delta Tau Delta President
Andy DeMuth suggested to
representatives that noise per-
mits be taken out in the name of
individuals instead of frater-
nities.

“Then the individual and not
the fraternity will lose the
privilege to take out a permit
because of a violation,’”’ said
DeMuth.

Without permits, fraternities
making excessive noise are sub-
ject to larger fines and general-
ly harsher punishment.

IFC Vice President Charles
Terry told representatives to
hold their suggestions until IFC
President Syd Farrar arrived.

When Farrar arrived several
minutes later a heated discus-

IF C Discusses Noise

sion began.
Split Body

Most representatives com-
plained that the IFC lacked
cohesion on the noise issue and
some representatives even
blamed the Judicial Board for
the problem.

Break In

No Prosecution

For Intruder

An Evans Dining Hall con-
struction worker who apparent-
ly tried to enter through the
window the room of a female
law student, Sept. 3, has been
expelled from campus, but will
not be prosecuted.

‘In order to press charges
and prosecute,’ said Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. Read, ‘‘an intent to commit
crimes prior to the offense of
break-in must be established.”

Read cited a lack of evidence
and peculiarities in Virginia’s
law dealing with trespassing as
major factors contributing to
the decision not to prosecute.

“My duties as prosecutor are
governed by Virginia law,”’ said
Read. ‘‘And if a technicality of
the law prevents a man from
being charged, then it would be
improper to have a man ar-
rested without sufficient
evidence.”

Read explained that trespass-
ing can only be prevented by
prior notice.

The worker has been notified
by the University and is no
longer allowed on the W&L
campus, subsequently causing
him to lose his job.

According to the student, she
first noticed the man staring in
the window while she combed
her hair, looking ina mirror.

On the following day, Thurs-
day, the worker came to the stu-
dent’s door and apologized for

staring through the window.

Later that night the man
returned and knocked on the
student’s door.

Recognizing the voice as
belonging to the worker whom
she had seen staring in her win-
dow, the student locked her
door, told the man to leave and
ran through an adjoining
bathroom and into another stu-
dent’s room.

Apparently, the man ran out-
side and tried to climb through
the window.

Lexington police arrived and
found a crushed window screen,
and a muddied footprint on the
window sill.

According to Lexington Chief
of Police James A. Kirby, the
police picked up a_ suspect
shortly before 8:00 A.M. Fri-
day.

Kirby attributes the decision
not to prosecute to Read while
Read claims both men had a
hand in the decision.

Read said he and two law
clerks investigated the case and
could not find grounds for pro-
secution.

“Often actions take place that
may be crimes, but if there is
not sufficient evidence, charges
cannot be placed.

School Proctor Bob Murray
said patrolling of the area has
been stepped up, but no other
changes have been planned.

Five Fraternities Cited

For Noise Violations

by David Greer

Once again, the Lexington
noise ordinance is on the minds
of the fraternity members.
Already, five fraternities have
been issued summons for
violating the city code.

Lambda Chi Alpha was found
guilty of violating the noise or-
dinace and of havigg amplified
sound without a_ permit.
Substitute Judge Robert S.
Culpepper fined the fraternity
$25 and costs for each offense.

Phi Kappa Sigma and Sigma
Nu were each issued summons
for violations at 2 a.m. on
September 7. Pi Kappa Alpha
was issued a summons at 4a.m.

on September 9 andPhi Kappa
Psi at 2:30 a.m. the same day.
Those cases have not appeared
in court.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said he will not issue
amplified sound permits to
fraternities for weeknights.
“Any music that’s amplified
must have a permit,” Kirby
said.

Interfraternity Council presi-
dent Syd Farrar said University
Proctor Charles F’. Murray will
try to keep an eye on the frater-
nities and warn them when the
music is too loud.

Wednesday afternoon Farrar,
IFC Vice-president Charles V.
Terry, Assistant Dean of

Students Danny Murphy, Kirby,
and Lexington City Manager
John B. Doane met in Doane’s
office to discuss the noise or-
dinance and its relation to
fraternities.

The group agreed to have all
amplified sound permits for
houses that have been issued
summons first approved by
Farrar and then by Kirby.
“This is to make the IFC aware
that a house has had trouble,”’
Terry said. The IFC Judicial
Board cannot act until after a
house has been tried by the city.

“The meeting was to help us
understand each other’s posi-
tions and get on good footing for
the rest of the year,” Terry
said.

State Chairmen Gear Up
For Mock Convention

Intensive work toward the
1980 Mock Convention has
been underway since the
spring of 1977, under the
leadership of co-chairman
Craig Cornett, Dick
Schoenfeld amd _ Sidney
Simmons. As the 17th W&L
Mock Convention draws
near, every possible means
to carry on the traditions of
authenticity and accuracy
are being used. The Con-
vention staff and _ state
delegation chairmen have
been named, and_ their
work is already well under-

way.
State delegation
chairmen and_ research

directors have perhaps the
greatest responsibility for
assuring the accuracy of
the Mock Convention; their
diligent, conscientious ef-
forts are crucial to success.
The Washington and Lee
Mock Convention will take
place three months before
the actual Republican con-
vention and prior to many

state primaries. In feature
articles to appear every
week we will be addressing
various aspects of the con-
vention from _ candidate
profiles to updating the
progress of the committees
and state delegations in-
volved in the planning and
coordination of the Mock
Convention.

by Guy Stewart

When embarking on a
political exercise such as the
Mock Convention, problems
arise which can only be
alleviated through cooperation
and diligience by everyone in-
volved. From the Convention
Chairmen down to members of
each state delegation, a total
commitment is. required in
order for the Mock Convention
to succeed. —

Vital to the Convention’s suc-
cess and continuation of the
reputation for accuracy is the
State Chairman and his delega-
tion. The selection of the State
Chairman is undertaken with
great care for a_ state
represented by an irresponsible

 

Parents

ever

  

 

and unorganized State Chair-
man results in a state delega-
tion which cannot contribute
significantly to the nominating
process at the Convention.

The fundamental assignment
of a State Chairman os to
organize his delegation and try
to infect its members with a
dedication towards making
their delegation the best coor-
dinated at the Convention.

There are an abundance of
duties for which each state
delegation is responsible;
however the most important
tasks are fund raising and
political research. State Chair-
man solicit contributions from
donors in their states. The
money raised is budgeted for
expenses which include a fixed
fee to the Steering Committee,
postage, stationary, phone ex-
penses, and accomodations for
visiting dignitaries. There are
also expenses for parties and
the state float which each
delegation is committed to
entering in the parade.

The main obstacle to be
hurdled for a State Chairman
and his delegation is their defi-
ciency of knowledge about their
state’s political process. This
situation is remedied through

the establishment of political
contacts within the actual state
delegation and by researching
as detailed as possible, each
state’s political affairs.

It is the duty of the State
Chairman to know how the state
he represents feels about cer-
tain issues and how each can-
didate reacts towards these
issues. By maintaining cor-
respondence with state leaders,
party chairmen, Convention
delegates and by reading the
state’s major newspapers, a
state chairman will be able to
capture the political mood of his
state and generate that same
feeling within his Mock Conven-
tion state delegation.

The true indicator of the
Mock Convention’s excellence
is the ability of the student
delegates to accurately repre-
sent the many diverse sectors of
the national political scene.
Although the students who con-
stitute the 1980 Mock. Conven-
tion delegations are not as
geographically varied as the
American citizens, their at-
tempt to emulate the diverse
society will be successful if they
can correctly predict the 1980
Republican Presidential can-
didate in May.

 

 

Students

Arrested
For

Playing
In Street

by David Greer

Three Washington and Lee
students were issued sum-
monses Sunday for throwing a
football in the street.

Lexington Police Officer Jack
Purvis issued summonses to
Ham Davis, Hall Vetterlein and
Scott Graham. Purvis con-
fisoated the football, which
belonged to another student.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said the three were
violating a city ordinance which
prohibits playing in the street,
throwing objects in or across
the street, or “running things
across the street, like a water
hose.”

Kirby said the police had the
football and the owner had not
claimed it. He said it will be
held until the court decides
what to do with it.

“We tried to get.it back and
he (Purvis) wouldn’t give it to
us,” Davis said. ‘‘They’ve
played catch in front of the Delt
house before and no one has
ever been hurt.”

The case will be tried Oct. 2.

to write home once a week from college

is in for more of an education than the son.

Changes In

by David Greer

Freshmen will not be allowed
to pledge fraternities until after
the fourth rush-date on Sept. 21,
according to new Interfraterni-
ty Council rulés.

IFC Vice-president Charles
V. Terry said this measure was
enacted to ‘take the pressure
and confusion of Rush off the
shoulders of the freshmen.”’

According to the new rules,
freshmen will return to the
dorms after the fourth rush-
date. At 11 p.m. the freshmen
will go to the houses they have
received bids from and wish to
join.

All fraternity members must
be inside their houses at 11
p.m., and no fraternity can pro-

vide transportation to the
house.
Freshmen will turn in

preference cards on Monday,
Oct. 1, stating which fraternity,
if any, they wish to join.
Freshmen can also pledge
anytime after the fourth Rush-
date.

No contact rules this year
prohibit fraternities from giv-
ing freshmen rides to girls’
schools during no contact and
limited contact periods.

Fraternities can give
freshmen rides on Saturdays
and Sundays and can _ lend

Rush Rules

treshmen cars. Fraternities are
also not allowed to give rides to
freshmen to parties outside of
Lexington during the no contact
or limited contact periods.

IFC president Syd Farrar
said the no transportation rul-
ing was made to prevent situa-
tions where freshmen would be
obligated to stay with one
fraternity. With independent
transportation, they would not
be trapped down the road and
would have a chance to attend
other parties.

Only two fraternity-
sponsored parties during the
week will be allowed, and they
must be held on the Wedsnes-
day nights of September. In-
formal parties not sponsored by
fraternity funds may be held,
but the no-transportation rule
applies.

During no contact periods,
fraternity members cannot
associate with freshmen
anywhere, including the dorms,
the Dining Hall, the Co-op, or
the Collonade.

‘“‘No contact’”’ means no con-
tact. Any violations will be left
up to the Judicial Board”’ of the
IFC, Farrar said.

Farrar said that about 340 of
the 368 freshmen are _par-
ticipating in Rush. “It’s been
pretty much free of controver-
sy. There haven’t been as many
conflicts as last year,’”’ Farrar
said.

New Wave Speads Over Summer

by Mark Kinniburg

This summer’s album crop
was more than enough to put a
dent in summer earnings, and if
one desired to limit his choice to
a few selections, there would
have been considerable trouble
in determining which one
deserved purchase. In every
phase of the wide musical boun-
daries of rock, jazz and folk,
there were very respectable en-
tries into the summer album
buyers spree.

Among my favorite rock en-
tries are a varied collection of
new wave, older style R’n’B and
a nice dose of standard
quasiheavy-metal-shake-the-
room-rock. Although very much
a matter of personal choice,
music can be thought of as an
ambiguous entertainment.

Two people may enjoy the
same music for different
reasons, or dislike it for the
same,

Rock’s new wave was kicked
off this summer by the B-52’s
from Athens, Ga., with “Rock
Lobster” A favorite of East
Coast beach bums, the once
obscure tune has become a
focal point for Warner Brothers
Records’ new wave sales pitch,
calling to retailers that new
wave can make money. A more
“traditional’’ approach to new
wave was the Talking Heads
“Fear of Music” album with its
songs about life during war,
drugs, cities, (‘Did I forget to
mention Memohis, home of the
ancient Greeks and Elvis?”)
and other concerns of the day.
The excellent reception of the
album by critics and record
buyers alike proved that the
success of ‘“‘Take Me to the
River” in 1977 was no fluke of
talent.

Calendar

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will again offer free
subscriptions to its “Weekly
Calendar’ for the 1979-80
academic year.

The Calendar is published
each Friday except during the
Christmas vacation, and lists
every public event scheduled at
W&L for the following two
weeks, with details about loca-
tion, lecture topics, and admis-
sion fees if they are charged.

Almost every event at W&L is
open to the public. All speeches,
art exhibits, most athletic
events, and many musical and
dramatic offerings are free,
and admission costs are
minimal for the relatively few
events on which a charge must
be placed, the university said.

The free subscriptions are
available through the W&L
News Office, and those in-
terested in receiving the Calen-
dar may write or they may
telephone 463-9111, ext. 317.

If a person has a post-office
box, postal regulations require
W&L to use that instead of a
street address. In addition, a
complete route and box number
are required by the Postal Ser-
vice for rural patrons.

Another new album that rais-
ed the questions of why it takes
so long to get such a great
album out of the studio was
Robert Fripp’s “Exposure.”

most recently for The Roches,
Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno.
His solo album has all the
touches which make his work so
unique and enjoyable on the
albums of others.

Exposure is a concept album

The B-52s

which draws on slow melodic
tunes to hard driving rock ‘n’
roll, and then again back to ex-
perimental tape manipulation
and studio magic. One of the
best points of the album,
however, is the impression that

 

the album fits so well together,
not as if the songs were record-
ed haphazardly and one song at
a time, but as if they were,
rather, recorded with a single
take in a very fluid mix.

In another excellent summer-
released album, Led Zepplin
proved that they are still the
kings of loud rock in the English
tradition. Adding a few years of
experience into the standard
form, however, Led Zepplin has
turned almost every selection ,
on the album into an accessible
song in the same manner that
made ‘Stairway to Heaven” a
prom theme classic. Touching
into funk and disco at times,
and mocking rockability at
others, the album is bound to be
the top seller of 1979.

Be on the lookout for...Bruce
Springsteen’s new albumn the
first part of October...A new
collection of Beatle greats at a

Muppet Movie Revives ‘Old Hollywood’

Jefferson Robert Coufal
Remember ‘*Old
Hollywood?’’ Remember

polished studio productions,
good vs. evil, a man with a
dream, romance, and happy en-
dings?

The Muppet Movie is ‘Old
Hollywood.’’ Kermit the Frog is
almost the reincarnation of
Bing Crosby just as Henson’s
studio seems to be Disney’s
studio of the 30’s born again,
with its impeccable production
and craft.

The plot is simple enough:
Kermit the Frog sets out to
answer an open audition for
frogs in Hollywood in order to
become rich and famous and
more importantly to make
millions of people happy.

On the way, he befriends Foz-
zie Bear (with a Studebaker, no
less), Gonzo the plumber with
his girlfriend (a chicken, forc-
ing us to ask yet again: what is
Gonzo?), Miss Piggy (the love
interest), Rolf, the piano play-
ing dog, and Dr. Teeth and the
Electric Mayhem.

The villan is a Colonel
Sanders type who is trying to
get Kermit to promote his
french fried frogs legs.
Needless to say, Kermit wins
and signs the ‘Standard rich
and famous contract’ with
World Wide Studios. A plot not
only like old Hollywood, but
about it as well.

The movie sags only during
the cameos by human. Mel
Brooks blows some terribly fun-
ny dialogue and Dom DeLouise
is pathetically un-funny while

the considerable talents of Or-

son Welles, Milton Berle, and

Richard Pryor have almost no

lines to go with them. Having
the late Edgar Bergen and
Charlie McCarthy do a scene
was a nice touch of nostalgia.

As it was directed by James
Frawley, The Muppet Movie
doesn’t have the fast paced,
almost manic speed that Jim
Henson’s projects normally do.
‘This is perhaps for the best as a
high energy level would be both
hard to maintain and difficult to
endure for two hours.

The jokes are funny, and the
running gags are underdone

rather than overdone. The
music by Paul Williams is
benign, which makes one
wonder what ever happened to
the genius who composed the
muppet classics ‘‘Rubber
Duckie,” “It’s Not Easy Being
Green,” and “Gone With the
Wind?”

Some of the special effects,
like Kermit riding a bicycle, are
fairly amusing, and I only saw
puppet wires once.

Most of the Muppets are in the
movie, but few new ones ap-

pear. There is no sign of Burt
and Ernie, Floyd (and his:
boomerang fish) has only one
line, and Big Bird makes a
cameo appearance. (Big Bird is
met on the road going East to
New York to become rich and
famous in public television. )

On the whole it’s an in-
credibly bright, funny film. It’s
entertaining in the ‘Old
Hollywood’’ tradition—
unpretentious, and fun. And if
you see it, stay through the end
credits for one last laugh.

Bookstore: Fighting Inflation

, Overheard in the Textbook
Dept: “What a rip-off!’’ “That
book has gone up $2.00 since last
year!” “I’m going to change
courses, the books for this class
are too expensive.’ ‘Mrs.

- Munger, what are the cheapest
course books you have here?”’

These and many more
remarks are ringing in our ears
(with the expletives deleted).
We heartily agree with you.
Textbooks are out of sight, man.
But the students here can be
assured that every book is pric-
ed at the publishers’ suggested
list price. The Bookstore’s
margin of profit is small—
barely enough to cover the cost
of shipping the books to Lex-
ington (enormous!), salaries
(modest) for the staff and our
overhead.

As a glimmer of comfort for
the future, the Bookstore is em-
barked on an expanding used-
book program. Next spring we
will buy back textbooks which
will be used the following fall.
We will pay % price for texts in
good condition. Emphasis on

good condition! So if students
want to recover some of the

they must treat their texts with

One other serious reminder:
We will accept books for return

W&L Receives Gift

A series of personal letters
and records spanning 80 years
in the history of an important
industry in southwest Virginia
has been added to the special
collections of Washington and
Lee’s undergraduate library.

The documents, which record

the growth of a Botetourt Coun- .

ty limestone industry founded
in 1869 by Confederate Col. Ed-

ward Dillon, were presented to
Washington and Lee by three of
his grandchildren, who are still
frequent visitors to the area.

Donors of the collection are
Miss Mary Unity Dillon, Miss
Susan Pendleton Dillon of
Washington, D.C., and Frank C,
Dillon Jr. of Roanoke.

Born in Salem, Va., in 1835,

a prominent Valley family. His
grandfather was the owner of
Botetourt Springs, now the site
of Hollins College. Dillon’s
career in the U.S. Army began
in 1857, but he resigned his com-
mission in 1861 when Virginia
seceded from the Union. Before
the fall of the Confederacy, he
had reached the rank of colonel
in the 2nd Mississippi Cavalry—
but found himself destitute at
the close of the war.

To support his family, Dillon
accepted the position of traffic
agent and manager of the
James River and Kanawha
Canal, and it was then that he
discovered the tremendous in-
dustrial potential in the
limestone of the upper James
River Valley. Several years
were spent investigating the
area, as Dillon continued with
his duties for the canal—the
same company whose stock,
donated in 1796 by George
Washington, saved W&L’s
predecessor institution, Liberty
Hall, from financial ruin.

In 1869 Dillon signed the first
lease for a quarry, lime kiln and
other facilities and within three
years the family was firmly
established at Indian Rock, a
bluff overlooking the river. The
Indian Rock estate remained
the Dillon home for more than a
century, until the last residents

closed the house in 1976.
Col. Dillon moved to Lex-
ington in 1890, living at

Mulberry Hill, near the site of
Liberty Hall, until his death in
1897. During his lifetime, the
limestone company’s success
led to the opening of railroad
lines, post offices and entire
residential communities.

Sweet Briar College in
Amherst, Virginia

This is the most closely
guarded bastion of the Southern
female gentry in the area, pro-
bably in the entire South.
Security is the tightest here and
a few of W&L’s fraternities are
even banned from the premises.

You hit the main guardhouse
at the front gate where a securi-
ty cop will check your license
and take down your name. Then
he (or she) will ask you who you
are visiting and which dorm she
lives in. He’ll probably record
your car’s license plate number
and may take down the names
of the passengers with you.

They come looking for you at
midnight or whenever the wit-
ching hour comes—when all the
little girls turn into pumpkins,
or whatever happens to them. If
you’re lucky and don’t hassle
the rent-a-cops too much,
they’ll let you go.

The security guards do not,
however, like it if you play
games with them, give them
alot of lip, or take a swing in

their general direction. No
sense of humor those rent-a-cop
types. Sometimes, if you’re real
nasty, they’ll call in the
Amherst police. Those who
have slept there don’t recom-
mend the accommodations at
the Amherst jail.

Perhaps you’ll have occasion
to attend a boat house party,
which you will find hot, smoky,
and too crowded, with, surpris-
ingly, not enough girls. Well,
girls study hard at Sweet Bush.

Needless to say, with all the
obstacles involved in
establishing a meaningful rela-
tionship with a Sweet Briar girl,
W&L students don’t go down the
road to the Bush with the same
frequency as they used to. (And
I haven’t even told you about
the ride over the mountains to
Amherst on Route 60.)

Reliable sources report that
some Sweet Briar girls are
beginning to feel a bit isolated
because of what the strick
security measures have done to
their social life. But the solitude
gives them more time to ride
their horses.

Generals Lose Opener
Travel to Emory and Henry Saturday

by Bill Whalen

The 1979 version of
Washington and Lee football
took their act on the road last
Saturday. Considering the way
the game went, the Generals
should be happy that the contest
was played in the anonymity of
Delaware Valley College.

W&L fumbled the opening
kickoff, turned the ball over a
total of eight times and lost to
Delaware Valley by the score of
30-0.

Despite the lopsided score
and the plethora of mistakes,
second year coach Gary Fallon
was not too disturbed by his
team’s performance. ‘You
have to remember we're a
young team and we have a shot
at every game we play,”’ said
the coach. ‘“‘How well we play
depends upon how well we ex-
ecute.”’

Last Saturday, the Generals
did not execute. The offense
fumbled a total of eight times,
losing all but two. Two passes
were also- intercepted, as the
Generals continue to be plagued
by the miscues of last vear’s
team.

In last year’s opener at
Madison (a 49-7 loss), the
Generals fumbled a total of four

times and were likewise in-
tercepted twice.

Offensively, the Generals had
many problems. Besides losing
the ball eight times, the offense
could not establish a running
game. Senior tailback and tri-
captain Stewart Atkinson ran 17
times for 48 yards. Junior
fullback Lee Minetree rushed
five times for 15 yards while
sophomore quarterback Rich
Hachenburg was sacked for a
total of minus 38 yards. On the
day, the Generals gained only
39 net yards while Delaware
Valley controlled the ball, and
ran nearly twice as many plays
(80 to W&L’s 46) to roll up 278
net yards on the ground.

Defensively, the Generals did
not play a bad game. The
defense allowed two first half
touchdowns (one in each
quarter) and a third quarter
field goal as the score was only

16-0 going into the final fifteen
minutes. Delaware Valley add-
ed two late touchdowns to end
the scoring at 30-0.

Hachenburg enjoyed more
success in the air than on the
ground. The quarterback who
hit on 50.5% of his passes in
1978, hit on 7 of 10 passes for 68
yards. The longest completion
was a 21-yard strike to tight end

Mike Fogarty. In his last two
games, Hachenburg has com-
pleted 23 of 34 passes, good for
316 yards.

This Saturday, the Generals
travel to Emory & Henry for a
1:30 ODAC contest. The Wasps
scored an 18-17 comeback vic-
tory last year and Fallon ex-
pects another ‘‘tough contest.’
“Their team is well-coached
and is a scrappy outfit,”’ said
the coach. “‘We don’t expect to
run over them but we don’t
want to beat ourselves.”’

Though stalled on offense last
week, W&L will once again use
their I-slot running formation.
Said Fallon: ‘‘We’ll take
whatever is available and we’ll
stay with whatever is  suc-
cessful.”

The Generals will be at home
on Wilson Field on Saturday,
September 22. The opponent is
Centre College of Danville, Ky.

Anyone interested in playing
J.V. football, please come to

Doremus Gym in the upper

Reis Takes Over
as New S.LD.

LEXINGTON, VA.—Ken
Reis, assistant sports informa-
tion director at Furman Univer-
sity and a _ recent honor
graduate of the Greenville,
S.C., school, was named sports
information director at
Washington and Lee University
early this summer.

“Our staff was impressed
when meeting Ken for an inter-
view and feels that, in spite of
his youth, he will bring vigor
and enthusiasm to the fine pro-
gram developed by Bill
Schnier,”’ W&L Athletic Direc-
tor and Physical Education
Department Chairman William
McHenry commented when an-
nouncing the appointment.

Schnier, W&L’s sports in-
formation director since
August, 1976, resigned in April
to become SID at Old Dominion
University in Norfolk, Va.
While at W&L, Schnier won na-

tional recognition for 13 of his
sports publications.

Reis graduated cum laude in
June from Furman, where he
majored in communica-
tions/public relations and serv-
ed as assistant sports informa-
tion director for three years.
During spring, 1978, he was the
schools interim -SID. His
primary sports information
responsibility was coordinating
publicity for eight of Furman’s
12 varsity men’s sports.

In addition to his sports in-
formation duties, Reis served
two years as sports editor of the
The Paladin, Furman’s stu-
dent newspaper, and one year
as sports department assistant
at The Greenville News.

“Ken has had extensive ex-
perience in the Furman pro-
gram and promises to continue
his fine work here,’’ McHenry
concluded.

Powell Jones, Junior Class
President and Sigma Nu
representative, accused the ad-
ministration of cooperating
with the city to “crack down”
on fraternities.

“It looks like there is some
cohoots between the town and
the faculty,” said Jones.

University Representative
Dan Murphy denied the accusa-
tion, but not before several
other representatives vocally
supported and applauded
Jones.

When the meeting finally got
down to business, the existence
of another problem was con-
firmed.

Farrar announced that Chief
Kirby will no longer grant noise
permits during the week.

He also told representatives
that the outcome of the meeting
with city officials will be reveal-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Ph:

 

The Fraternities’ Situation

Let's not kid ourselves. Underneath the candy
coating of the hectic, almost dizzying pace of Rush
lies the reality that not all is well with Washington and
Lee's fraternity system. As the year begins, the
fraternities seems to be backed into a corner, with no
room for bargaining or even negotiation.

A sizeable number of college students were shocked
and wounded last year when the city fathers sent a
third-year law student/student body president pack-
ing home with his ‘‘reasonable and fair’’ solution to
the ‘‘noise problems”’ dragging on the ground behind
him. The city council didn’t buy the argument that
they should compromise Lexington’s noise ordinance
in return for some ‘concessions’ on fraternity
rowdiness. What the fraternities’ ‘‘concessions”’
amounted to were promises that they would try not to
break the law as much as they had in the past. But
fraternity men still do not seem to have figured out
that the city does not want the law broken at all.

 

We may not agree with your point of view. We may even think

your criticisms and opinions are misplaced or downright wrong.
But we will always print the letters you send into us. After all, if you
can't voice your sentiments in your student newspaper, then
what good are we?

After not even coming up to bat with city hall, some
bitter fraternity members talked about a boycott of
the city’s businesses. The idea was to “‘pressure’’ the
city council to bend to the fraternities’ will. But the
idea was scrapped when they realized that the loss of
fraternity business, even if possible, would probably
not shut down the city of Lexington, or even cripple it
into submission.

‘hen when the fraternities started talking about
fighting city hall with the aid of the faculty and alum-
ni, they discovered that alumni and faculty support
had been eroding for years. Oh, the indicators had
been around for a number of years, but fraternity
men hadn’t noticed them until several faculty
members publicly expressed their unfavorable opi-
nions of the fraternities. In fact, many members of
W&L’s faculty are among the fraternities’ strongest
critics. The alumni lost their enthusiasm for the
fraternities’ plight in this matter when they saw the
shape that their old houses had deteriorated into.

With no substantial support from the faculty and
alumni forthcoming, the fraternities found
_ themselves in their present situation—with little or no
clout or bargaining leverage. The next chapter in this
story was the claim that this ‘‘sudden’’ enforcement
of the law was ‘‘unfair.”’ But the timeless fraternity
man’s tactic of blaming the members who were there
before him for causing his predicament is not selling
well anymore. The faculty, alumni, and the towns-
people want the whole show cleaned up now. All they
really want is for fraternity members to act respon-
sibly according to the laws of society and in ac-
cordance with their role as members of the communi-
ty. And they seem to be serious about wanting that
responsible behavior to begin immediately.

_ The irony of it all is that the students who have
realized the fraternities are backed into a no-
compromise situation and are trying to work within
the system have been denounced as traitors to the
cause. If Syd Farrar and the Interfraternity Council’s
Judicial Board act as they know they have to, they
will be among the most hated members of the student
body. But if they don’t fine heavily for infractions of
the rules, self-government for fraternities might be
lost and a few fraternities may be disbanded to make
the point clearer. As it is, the whole fraternity system
is under review by what is now a majority of the facul-
ty. The faculty has made it it very clear that they hold
the future of W&L’s fraternities within their collective
hands, but it is up to the fraternities to demonstrate to
the University and to the town their intentions to
behave in a more responsible manner in the im-

mediate future.

Parker Potter

Here we are, ready for the kickoff of yet
another season of W&L’s biggest fall sport—
not football, fraternity rush.

Many freshmen are probably full of ner-
vous anticipation. Sophmores are excited to
be playing it from the other side of the hand-
shake for the first time. Juniors, who’ve been
there before are busy trying to see that things
are done right. And those seniors involved,
those grizzled veterans, could probably live
without the hustle and bustle of their fourth
Rush—but there’s no stopping it.

 

Parker Potter, a 1979 graduate of Washington
and Lee, is currently studying at the University
under a Liberty Hall Fellowship

 

It seems to me, that of all the aspects of
what must be called an artificial social situa-
tion at W&L, the four weeks of Rush are the
most artificial. I mean, you can be charming
and attentive to only so many housefuls of
strangers in the course of one evening. And on
the other side, best behavior is hard to main-
tain through 10 car rides, five Mr. Pibbs, 150
handshakes and hundreds of new faces.

There is no denying that Rush is, if nothing
else, a strange and difficult way to spend four
weeks. But alas, it does its job better than any
conceivable alternative. Strange as it may be,
this particular system survives because it
does its job.

This is not to suggest that there aren’t ways
to make the system work more smoothly or
more happily. To the end of making this hec-
tic, anxious month of Rush as easy as possible
on everyone involved, I offer a few sugges-
tions:

To you upperclassmen:

Remember your first few weeks at W&L.
Absolutely everything about your life was
brand new. The place you lived, the people
around you, the things you were doing.
Remember that you weren’t always the stud
you are today; that you were at times confus-
ed, didn’t know exactly what to wear, what to
say. Most of all, realize that a freshman’s
first real introduction to W&L is through
Rush.

I’m not saying be best buddies with every
freshman who passes through your house. |
am saying, be friendly or at least civil, be
helpful, be honest, at least give everyone a
chance. Just because a guy doesn’t fit into
your house doesn’t mean that he is a leper or a
dolt or has nothing to offer. It takes more than
just Delts or just Phi Kaps or just Lamb-
chops to make a University.

To you freshmen:

Try to understand the attitude of the up-
perclassmen. They’ve all been through this
before, shaken a million hands. There are
many things which may be more fun or press-
ing than Rush: girls, Goshen, booking, or ap-
plications to law school; but they’re there,
drinking the beers, shaking the hands.

Many houses have a pretty good idea of
what kind of man they’re looking for before
you even hit campus. This makes things
easier for them, harder for you.

In spite of that, the key is to be yourself, and
to a degree, to remember your place. You’re
no longer the King of the Hill in your high
school; you’re the new kid on the block. The
point is nobody likes loud, obnoxious
freshmen. They get blackballed quickest of
all.

But nobody likes a ‘‘bump on a log,’’ either.
You’re tossed into this whirlpool both to sell
yourself and to let the houses sell themselves
to you. You’re not in any one house long, so
make the most of it. Answer questions when
asked and ask your own.

And one other thing. If you don’t get a bid
from a particular house, it isn’t the end of the
world. If they don’t want you, you probably
wouldn’t be happy with them. In those mat-
ters the house is probably the best judge. Put-
ting all your money on one house can be a
quick ticket to unhappiness. With our 16 dif-
ferent houses there is someplace for
everyone. Bo open—be yourself and you can
find that place.

From all my exhortations it sounds like
Rush is the next best thing to an all expense
paid vacation to Dachau. It really isn’t. It is a
hectic, exciting time which requires a great
deal of effort. For all its strangeness, though,
Rush can be fun, and with a little considera-
tion on both sides, it can be a very construc-
tive four weeks.

 

 
 

In Focus
Is Time Running Out On W&L’s Fraternity System?

 

Syd Farrar

 

Although the fraternity system at
Washington and Lee has been through many
conflicts and changes in the past two years,
including increased pressures from the alum-
ni, faculty and administration to mend our
ways, I feel that the fraternity system will
weather the storm and remain an important
part of student life at Washington and Lee.

The key for the fraternities to remain a
strong part of student life lies in the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The alumni, administra-
tion and especially the faculty, because they
stated such in their resolution passed last
spring, are looking for a fraternity system
which can govern itself within the rules and
regulations set forth in the Student Handbook.
The ability of the IFC and specifically the
Judicial Board to justly interpret and enforce
these rules while receiving the support of all
the fraternities will be very important in
the months to come.

 

Syd Farrar, a senior at Washington and Lee, is
president of the Interfraternity Council

 

The Faculty Motion passed in the spring left
the outcome of fraternity affairs in the hands
of the IFC and the fraternities. The faculty
does not want to directly administrate the
functions of each fraternity. The decision was
left up to the fraternities to govern
themselves.

I agree that the faculty established some
guidelines which all fraternities do not agree
with, but I do not see that we have any choice
but to try to honestly live within these
guidelines. The Faculty is very concerned
about the conflicts between academics and
social life within a fraternity and especially
the way in which a freshman, in the beginning
of the year during Rush, is hit with a party
system which he may construe is the norm in-
stead of the exception. Along these lines, the
Faculty is looking for a decrease in the size
and number if the weeknight parties.

The IFC has banned all house sponsored
weeknight parties as a result of this faculty
preference, but it has maintained the right of
a group of individuals to hold a party within a
fraternity house. A house is allowed to have a
house sponsored party two of the three weeks
of September to coincide with Rush. But after
this there will be no house sponsored
weeknight parties.

Another problem arising from the
weeknight parties is that the Lexington police
are denying any noise permits during the
week, reserving the right to issue them only
on weekends. A meeting with Chief of Police
Kirby and City Manager Doane this Wednes-
day will hopefully clear the air as to the
reason for this change along with letting the
fraternities know what the City of Lexington
will expect of fraternities this fall.

Last Spring I was worried that everyone
concerned with the University was against
the fraternity system. Fortunately, I was told
that this is not the case. The Faculty and Ad-
ministration, especially Dean John, Danny
Murphy and President Huntley were especial-
ly interested in our problems and in finding
solutions to them.

Perhaps the greatest amount of support
came from the Alumni Board and the Board
of Trustees. Through the years they have
given the fraternities a large amount of sup-
port through physical means in the approval
of low interest loans for for the upkeep of the
houses. Again in the spring they reiterated

Faculty Resolution of May, 1979

To the IFC, SAC, and the University Council:

The Faculty appreciates the constructive action toward more ef-
fective self-control of fraternities taken by the IFC and endorsed by
SAC and the University Council.

The Faculty concurs with the IFC’s position that self-regulation
by fraternities is preferable to rules the faculty might impose. And
it urges you to bear in mind the following observations.

Fraternities and fraternity members are to govern themselves in
accord with the following catalogue statement:

“Fundamental to all other aspirations of Washington and Lee
University are two basic purposes :

—the dedication of all its resources to the development of man’s
capacity and desire to learn, to understand, and to pass on to others
the varied benefits of this intellectual growth.

—the pursuit of its educational purpose in a climate of learning
that stresses the importance of the individual, his harmonious rela-
tionship with his fellow-man and his responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his training and talent.

Fraternities undeniably add a dimension to student social life at
W&L; that dimension should complement the educational purposes
of the University. Mid-week party activities on fraternity premises
conflict with, rather than complement, academic life. The Faculty
feels confident you will, in the months to come, eliminate such con-
flicts. .

All initiation and pledge activities classifiable as hazing violate
the ‘importance of the individual, his personal honor and integri-
ty.” Inrecent years student reports to faculty about hazing have in-
creased in number and frequency; many of these reports describe
abhorrent actions degrading to the participants, actives as well as
pledges. You can, by open discussion and inquiry, bring your own
forms of pressure to bear upon those whose behavior disgraces the
entire fraternal system.

Excessive noise, ear-splitting live or recorded music, obscene
comments, and lewd or destructive conduct, whether in Lexington
or on neighboring campuses, violate a “‘harmonious relationship”’
with one’s fellow-man. Fraternities enjoy a generous compromise
in the matter of noise since fraternity neighbors generally tolerate
loud party music during weekend evening hours. Fraternities
must, however, respect their neighbors’ right to rest undisturbed in
the privacy of their homes during late night and early morning
hours.

The Faculty also anticipates your re-analysis of both the present
rushing system and the entire question of fraternities’ interference
with the freshman’s adjustment to academic demands. In the
months to come, faculty representatives on the University Council
and SAC will discuss these subjects with you.

The Faculty requests the University Council to submit before
January 7, 1980, a written report on the implementation of its policy
of May, 1979, and of its disciplinary actions taken to enforce that
policy. The Dean of Students should include in that report a list of
fraternity-related complaints including their general source,
nature, and disposition. The University Council is also to share with
the Faculty all results of the SAC investigations of fraternities’ role
in academic life and any steps the Council takes pursuant to that
report.

Reluctant but not unwilling to legislate directly upon any of these
matters, the Washington and Lee Faculty expresses its faith in this
institution’s students and in their desire to cooperate in achieving
the exalted goals common tous all.

their support, but said that they hoped that

The question is raised: has time run vut on
fraternities at Washington and Lee? The
question has a grisly side. It invites a worst-
case scenario: imagine all the seamy
episodes of the recent past associated with
fraternity men and lump them together.

The picture that results is enough to make
any serious student look for fresh air—public
drunkenness ; obscene language and gestures
and public urination at sporting events;
malicious and insulting remarks directed at
faculty members from house windows, doors
and balconies; loud weekend and week-night
parties disrupting academic purpose and
violating community sensibilities, if not the
law as well; lapses into physical violence and
grossly undignified behavior during fraterni-
ty initiations; house faculty advisors resign-
ing in disgust and despair, destruction of
fraternity house property and property at
near-by women’s colleges. Not so good, huh?

 

Dr. Edward L. Pinney is professor of politics at
Washington and Lee University

 

This scenario is, of course, not unavoidable.
Most of the things mentioned above have not
been typical of all fraternities, or more than a
small handfull of individuals within any
single house.

It is puzzling to me why house officers have
so often been reluctant (unable?) to impose a
code of acceptable behavior and to enforce
house rules and some degree of discipline
within the brotherhood. Since the faculty
delegated self-government to the fraternities
in 1970, the machinery has been there. It is
probably only a short step to the point
wherein fraternities can meet a felt social
need and yet still meet their obligations as
organized groups within the university com-
munity. A fraternity need not be a roving
gang of rowdies. The time need not have run
out.

A new beginning will be for every present
and prospective fraternity man to read
carefully the faculty resolution enacted last
May 28th, rather than the curious misinter-
pretation that appeared in last year’s final
issue of the Ring-tum Phi. That resolution is
reprinted on this page, and attention is
directed particularly to those paragraphs
stating the university’s mission and stating
that fraternities are to govern themselves in
accordance. If the reader will then reconsider
the illustrations of fraternity un-, mal-, and
misbehavior described above, the contrast is
too vivid to ignore.

Between now and next January 7th much
can be done and much can be stopped. These
changes are best managed, in my view, by the
IFC and the fraternity houses themselves;
but the faculty has stated that it is ‘“‘not un-
willing” to do so if need be. There is still time.
At least I hope so.

certain improvements would be made, in- .

cluding increased improvement in the
physical appearance of the houses, the doing
away with any instances of hazing, and the
move for fraternities from being just a social
center to that of one which promotes
academic excellence as well.

With this solid support from those con-
nected with the University and with the in-
creased strength of the IFC through fraterni-
ty support I hope to see the fraternity system
noticeably strengthened as a result of the
events of the past year. After Rush the IFC,
with the help of all the fraternities and the
Student Affairs Committee, will conduct an
intensive self-study, which I also hope will
demonstrate to everyone the value of the

fraternity system at Washington and Lee
University.

Persiflage

This is it. This is my year.

I’m really going to settle down and work. Yes sir, I’m going to be
a studying fool, a veritable tome groupie.

Why, as soon as Rush ends I’ll be over at the library every night. I
figure that between the end of Star Trekand the beginning of the il-
legal mid-week parties I can really get some work done. .

My trouble last year was that I got too distracted. But after the
lecture my parents laid on me I’ve really reformed. I’ve set down
guidelines that I’m really going to stick to. No matter what, I’m
limiting myself to only two beers before dinner. I’m only going
down the road once a week, unless something really special comes
up. As for drugs, hey, only every once and awhile and then only if
its good stuff.

You see, it’s only a matter of discipline. If you tell yourself that
you only need a pint when you feel like a fifth you'll be able to cut
down. I just thank Bacchus that I was born with enough determina-
tion to fight off the desires of the flesh.

Renovations

Walking along Lee Street to

Few people realize that the
huge building is being con-

by W&L’s smallest fraternity,
Chi Psi.

Alumni from the national
chapter of Chi Psi are donating
money to pay for the renovation
and maintenance of the old

WLUR Workshop

A month long summer pro-
gram for Lexington High School
students interested in the
management and operation of a
radio station was held last July
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

The program, sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s Jour-
nalism Department, was under
the direction of Robert J.
DeMaria, assistant professor of
journalism at W&L and
manager of WLUR, the Univer-
Sity’s radio station. DeMaria,
supervised the students who
learned techniques and pro-

blems of broadcasting manage-
ment while operating the sta-
tion.

“It was a great success. The
kids learned so much,” said
DeMaria. Now they are going to
see if they can form a radio club
at the high school which will
hopefully run WLUR during
vacations.

“This year,”’ said DeMaria,
“we will be doing regular
surveys:to poll the entire listen-
ing area. In 1967 the station was
conceived with a community
oriented philosophy. We are try-
ing to get back to that.”

Mull Sells College Inn

The College Inn, for ten years
a traditional haunt- of
Washington and Lee students,
was Closed over the summer by
its proprietor, Clyde Mull.

Mull, who closed the Inn
because “it was just too much
work,” has leased the building
at 16 N. Main St. to Michael and
Sue Anne Brooks, who have
opened Brooks Metalware,
which sells primarily pewter
items. The Brooks’ expect most
of their business through the
tourist trade.

EC Explains
Second Closed

Honor Trial

by Randy Smith

The student body Executive
Committee attempted to clarify
its stance on the recent granting
of a second closed honor trial to
a former Washington and Lee
student at Monday night’s EC
meeting.

The situation involved a W&L
senior who was found guilty of
an honor code violation last
May, four weeks before he was
to graduate. The situation came
into the public’s view when the
student filed suit in Lynchburg
Federal District Court contend-
ing that his rights of due pro-
cess had been violated and ask-
ed that he be reinstated as a stu-
dent and given another trial in
order to present additional
evidence.

Normally, all honor trial pro-
ceedings are secret.

Steve Abraham, Student
Body President, reading from a
prepared statement, cited a
provision in the White Book
(which explains the honor
system) providing for the
reopening of an honor case:

‘“‘A hearing may be reopened
upon the production of new evi-
dence directly bearing on the
question of guilt or innocence or
to prevent injustices.”’ (Article
L, p. 8)

Abraham then went on to say
that ‘‘the granting of extensions
to the 24 hour time period an ac-
cused student has to request a

public trial is not unprece-
dented but commonplace.”

He went on to quote again
from the White Book: ‘‘the time
for making such a request (for a
public trial) may be extended in
particular cases at the discre-
tion of the Executive Commit-
tee.”’ (Article J, p. 7)

However, the student involv-
ed, Peter Engel of Oakhurst,
N.J., was granted a private
trial, not a “‘public’’ trial as
Abraham stated, leaving the
situation of granting a second
private honor trial still unclear.

Abraham continued:

“At no time did any ad-
ministrative official of this
university bring on pressure to
bear on any member of the E.C.
to conclude an agreement with
the accused. The agreement
was made by last year’s E.C.
and was found to be binding on
this year’s E.C.

“Finding ourselves in this
position, we sought to clarify
the situation for ourselves, the
accused, and the Honor System
by adding one item to the agree-
ment: a reopening of the case,
to be reheard in its entirety, ac-
cording to procedure of the
White Book.”’

Abraham also said _ that
Engel’s federal suit against the
school has not been withdrawn,
as had been reported in the
Ring-tum Phi last week. The
Ring-tum Phi has learned, how-

Big Rock Concerts
Are Dead At W&L

 

by Stuart W. Snyder

There will be no more big rock concerts at
Washington and Lee, according to Michael
Cappeto, Director of the University Center
and Assistant Dean of Students. Cappeto,
faculty advisor for the Student Activities
Board and signer of any major concert con-
tracts, cited a landslide of problems over the
past several years that led to the decision.

Last year the SAB’s Spring Concert was
supposed to be Firefall. According to William
Ridge, one of the SAB Chairmen, the group
was selected from a list of possible acts.

The standard procedure in selecting a
group according to Cappeto is to first select
an agent. Then the agent locates possible acts
based on: music type, an estimated budget
and the proximity to Washington and Lee.

Once the agent has obtained. a list of bet-

ween 2 and 20 acts, then he sends the list to the
university. Next, the SAB selects a group and
notifies the agent.

The agent then contacts the group’s agent
and obtains from the group a ‘‘rider”’ or a list
of items that the university must provide
above and beyond the contract price.

Firefall’s concert would have cost the
university approximately $12,000. Their ten
page rider included such things as ‘‘a local
piano tuner, who is a registered member of
the Piano Technicians Guild,...(to be)
available six hours prior to show time’ and
300 amps of power, according to Cappeto,

enough power to supply all of Lexington with
electricity.

Other features of the rider included: one-
fifth of Jack Daniels Whiskey, three cases of

No More Big Concerts

(continued from page 1)

Heineken Beer, Remy Martin
Cognac, Cuervo Gold Tequila,
specially carpeted rooms for
the Artists crew, furnished
throughout the day with beer,
coffee, juice, soft drinks and
sandwiches and finally a
special diabetic meal that had
to be provided or ‘‘there would
be a breach of contract.”

Next, the university

acknowledges all that it can
provide and the rest of the
negotiations are left to the
agents.

However, according to Ridge,

apparently last Spring there

had been a break down in com-
munications and _ Firefall’s
manager arrived here expec-
ting more than W&L could give.

In the winter of 1977 The
Atlanta Rhythm Section ap-
peared before a crowd of about
1,000 people at a cost of $3,000 to
the university. ‘‘We had hired
them before they became
popular. They were just releas-
ing a new album when we con-
tracted them,’’ Cappeto ex-
plained.

Earlier that year the SAB had
booked Orleans for a Fall Con-
cert. That concert, according to
Cappeto, ‘‘fell apart because of
back stage problems.”

In 1976 The Spinners played
W&L to the tune of $18,000
before a crowd of 1600-1700 peo-
ple. “It was successful...but
there were student complaints
because it was a soul band,”

Cappeto said.

undertaking, said Cappeto.
Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
which has one of the largest
concert schedules, has six or
seven concerts a year. By the
time an underclassman is a
senior, he has a lot of ex-
perience behind him.

“Our university is too small

for a big concert population. All
other schools our size gave up
years ago. We just can’t do
them any more,” Cappeto
stated. He added, “There are
many other benefits that our
university provides that other
schools our size don’t
have...There are sacrifices that
one must make in order to at-

tend a smaller university.
Large concerts are one of
them.”

“There are sacrifices that one must make

in order to attend a smaller university.

Large concerts are one of them.” -Michael Cappeto

 

The biggest complaint of
Firefall’s manager was there
was not enough power, Ridge
said. (200 amps were provided)

According to Ridge, at the
time of the concert it was
agreed that both sides had
“messed-up’’. Since there
would be no concert both par-
ties agreed to let it drop.
However, in July Firefall’s
lawyer sent word to the univer-
sity demanding their ‘‘guaran-
teed’’ pay for the concert or
they would take legal action.

According to Cappeto, he has

“not heard from them since.

“But who can tell about the
legal process,” Cappeto added.

In the past four years, W&L
has booked Harry Chapin, Or-
leans, The Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion and the Spinners. Cappeto
has only termed one of these
concerts as very successful—
The Atlanta Rythm Section.

In 1978 Harry Chapin per-
formed. “‘It was good music,
but only 500 people showed up.
The people who balked at the
Spinners were satisfied but
other people were dissatisfied,”’
Cappeto said. According to Cap-
peto the concert cost $6,000 to
$7,000. Ridge said the people
who went thought it was an ex-
cellent concert.

“As far as a future for ‘big
concerts at W&L, I don’t see
any...The cost is not justifiable.
The money could be put to bet-
ter use,’’ stated Cappeto.

According to Cappeto W&L
just does not have enough ex-
perienced people to handle
large concerts. There is a lot of
work involved,” he added.

James Madison University
has two full-time faculty
members to supervise such an

According to Cappeto, one of
the biggest problems is getting
a group to even come. ‘Then
you have to face what can go
wrong such as: the group
doesn’t like the location or food,
they dislike the drive and
hotels, no convenient airport,
not enough power, stage size is
not big enough and no equip-
ment. There’s just so much that
can go wrong,” Cappeto said.

“Before, the groups would
come here and would try to
work things out,’ he added,
“but recently they have just
come, looked at the place and
said NO!”

The university is planning to
build a pavilion in the future,
but not for the purposes of con-
certs. ‘“The gym is a good place
for it,”’ Cappeto said.

Pi Kappa Alpha, through the
services of an attorney, had its

All penalties imposed by the
IFC are subject to review and
possible revision by the Student
Affairs Committee, a joint
student-faculty body.

While on social probation no
fraternity is allowed to have
women in the house, hold par-
ties or have members con-
gregate in groups consisting of
more than five persons.

Sigma Chi was charged $25 by
Sweet Briar College for
damages done to a carpet dur-
ing a recent impromptu party.

The fraternity was also warn-
ed not to take kegs into the
dorms again.

During the regular IFC
meeting which preceded the
Judicial Board hearing Syd
Farrar, IFC President, discuss-
ed his recent meeting with Lex-
ington Officials and explained
pledging as it will be handled
this year.

“Not much came out of the
meeting with City Manager
Doane and Police Chief Kirby
that we didn’t already know,”
Farrar said.

One change was made in the
issuance of noise permits.

“Originally the police were
not going to issue noise permits
on weeknights, but they have
changed their stance and will
issue them now for big occa-
sions like Fancy Dress,” ex-
plained Farrar.

However, Farrar told repre-
sentatives that summonses will ,
still be issued at the officer’s
discretion.

Farrar also reminded
representatives that freshmen
can attend parties after rush
dates 3 and 4, even if they do not
pledge.

Fraternity members were
warned not to go after freshmen
when it comes time to pledge.

“No fraternity members are
to go and pick up freshmen at
the dorms or to be in the vicinity
of the dorm after rush dates 3
and 4,” warned Farrar.

Representatives were also
reminded that ‘‘no-contact”’
rules do not apply after a
freshman has ‘“‘torn”’ (pledged)
with a house.

Fraternity inspection lists
were handed out and are due
October 1.

The next IFC meeting will be

What The Hell’s A Ring Tum Phi

(Reprinted from the Ring-tum
Phi of Tuesday, Dec. 5, 1967)

Back in the days when
telephones (all 68 of them in
Lexington, an advertisement
boasted) were known as “‘up-to-
date electric call bells,’ back
when stealing a_bell-clapper
was called “a naughty-one’s
frolic,” in the same year that
the New York Post conferred on
this city (really) the title
“Athens of the South’’—there
came into being a little
newspaper published weekly,
“by the students for the
Washington and Lee University
community,’’ and named after
the most popular of that Univer-
sity’s football cheers: ‘‘Ring-
tum Phi.”

“Coincident with the ad-
ministration of President
Wilson begins the career of a
new publication at Washington
and Lee, the Ring-tum Phi. The
Ring-tum Phi is a weekly jour-
nal and presents a pleasing ap-

pearance. it meets a distinct
need in the University and
relieves the Collegian of what
formerly has tended only to clog
and retard.”

Literary Magazine

“The Collegian is primarily a
literary magazine, and when
the editors heretofore were
forced to cram in a limitless
number of locals, they always
bewailed the dismal incongrui-
ty. Henceforth, we rejoice to
say, the Collegian is freed from
matters of this kind, and will
not be compelled to try to serve
two ends at once...”’

“Gentlemen of the Ring-tum
Phi, you have our best wishes.
Gentlemen of the Ring-tum Phi,
we give you our sincerest
thanks. Students of W. and L.,
we congratulate you on the ad-
vent of the long needed week-
ly!”

The year was 1897. The
Southern Collegian was still a
high-quality magazine, being

published by the Graham
Literary Society. The Ring-tum
Phi was designed to be a
somewhat lighter, perhaps even
ribald, complement to the Col-
legian.

Eighteen and _ ninety-seven.
The year the football coach had
to send away for a special
noseguard ‘‘to protect the col-
ossal proboscis which ac-
companies Mr. Fitzhugh’s
countenance.”” (‘‘Mr.”’ Fitz-
hugh was a student; everybody
then was Mister or Doctor or
Professor or Reverend.)

Scandalous Verse

Eighteen and ninety-seven.
The year of the Great Hell Scan-

editor-in-chief, George
Houston, in the fourth issue of
the neophyte newspaper,
published a column of ‘Foot-

cluded with this verse:

‘Each other’s back, boys,

“Has got a knack, boys,

An extensive search cam-
paign is underway throughout
the Valley of Virginia, in order
to locate original photographic
prints by Michael Miley—
‘*General Lee’s
photographer’’—for a major ex-
hibition next January at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.
The four-week show, schedul-
ed to appear in duPont Gallery,
is being researched by Mame
Warren of Rockbridge County,
and supervised by Pamela H.
Simpson of the Washington and
Lee art department.

Preliminary research has
already begun for the exhibi-
tion, according to Ms. Warren.
“We have found a number of
unique items,’’ she commented,
“but it is absolutely essential
that we encourage area
residents to dig in their attics
and drawers if the show is to be
composed entirely of original
Miley prints.”

Miley was the most noted
photographer in this area of
Virginia for some 50 years. He
first arrived in Lexington in
1866—shortly after Lee assum-
ed the presidency of
Washington College—and con-
tinued making prints almost un-
til his death in 1918.

Original prints are easily
recognized—on most of them,
‘““M. Miley” may be seen on a
front corner or the back side.
Extremely early works may be
distinguished by the words
“Boude and Miley,”’ referring
to the photographer’s partner-

ship with a local financier in the
period 1866-1870. And still others
may be marked ‘Miley and
Son,”’ dating from the 1890s,
when Miley’s son Henry entered
the family business.

An oral history by Henry
Miley, transcribed in 1941 and
now in W&L’s_ University
Library, provided a ‘‘wealth of
dates, inside family (stories),
and valuable technical informa-
tion,’’ according to Ms. Warren.
The document tells of the ad-
vanced carbon process Miley
used regularly in his work—a
technique used by no more than
a half-dozen photographers in
the entire country at that time.

Also noteworthy are Miley’s
pioneering efforts in color
photography. His color work
dates from the 1890s, and in-
cludes 100 subjects, from the
painting of the Battle of New
Market in Jackson Hall at
V.M.I. to still life photos of
flowers and bowls of peaches.
Several of these prints have
already been collected, as well
as the bowl used for the still life
photos, now owned by John
Whitesell of Brownsburg, Va.
(Whitesell, a _ relative of
Miley’s, has also uncovered a
number of fine family pic-
tures.)

“All the color prints are ex-
traordinarily well preserved,”
Ms. Warren noted. ‘‘They don’t
fade, and may not even be
recognized as photographs, soa
careful examination is
necessary.’’ She added that
scenic prints and bridal por-

traits are of particular interest
for the exhibition.

Other items already located
include Miley’s large view
camera, to be displayed with
his prints; prints of V.M.I.
historical figures Scott Shipp
and Francis Smith; and George
Marshall’s football team por-
trait from the V.M.I. class of
1901. Many other original prints
are known to exist—such as the
scenes of Lee’s funeral—but
locating the works will be near-
ly impossible without the help of
area residents.

Ms. Warren concluded that
items loaned to the university
for the exhibition would be held
about 2 months, including
several weeks necessary for the
prints to be matted, mounted
and framed. But those with
Miley originals should call in
their information as soon as
possible—either to Mame War-
ren at 703-348-5036, or to Dr.
Simpson at the W&L art depart-
ment, 463-9111, ext. 228 or 351.

New Faces In Admissions

Two men—a new Washington
and Lee University graduate
and the assistant director of ad-
missions at a college in
Alabama—were appointed ad-
missions counselors at
Washington and Lee during the
summer.

They are Peter M. Williams
of Cincinnati, who received his
B.A. degree with honors in
history last spring from
Washington and Lee, and W.
Michael Hallman, formerly
assistant admissions director at
Southern Benedictine College, a
small, Catholic liberal arts in-
stitution in Cullman, Ala.

Williams, 21, and Hallman,
24, will have substantial respon-
sibility for student recruitment
of W&L’s behalf, including
visits to secondary schools, on-
campus interviewing, and
reviewing applications for ad-
mission to Washington and Lee.

Williams was president of his
class at W&L in both his
freshman and junior years. He
was elected to Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national honorary
leadership society, in his junior
year. He was a member of
W&L’s Student Recruitment
Committee throughout his
undergraduate career and
played on the General’s tennis
team as well.

Hallman is a B.S. graduate of
the University of Alabama and
earned his master’s degree in

   

 
       
   

 
 

 

 

counselor education from the
University of Virginia last year.
He joined the admissions staff
of Southern Benedictine a year
ago as an admissions counselor
and was named assistant direc-
tor this past January.

W&L Concert Guild Announces Season

The Washington and Lee
University Concert Guild has
announced a five-concert series
for the 1979-80 season—
including the first symphony or-

chestra to be heard on the -

campus—according to Robert
Stewart, professor of music and
head of the music department
at Washington and Lee.

Opening the season on Tues-
day, Oct. 2, at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel will be the Richmond
Sinfonia, the nucleus of the
Richmond Symphony. Estab-
lished in 1973, the Sinfonia is the
only fully professional, full-time
orchestra in Virginia.

Led by French conductor Jac-
ques Houtmann, the group is
comprised of outstanding musi-
cians from conservatories and
orchestras across the country,
and has been described as a
“tightly knit, well-disciplined
ensemble, flexible in technique
and musicianship, and respon-
sive to the interpretive aims of
its conductor.”

The Sinfonia has appeared in
all areas of Virginia, and is
especially noted for its educa-
tional concerts, which have
been attended by more than
50,000 school children.

The program at Washington
and Lee will feature Clark Sut-
tle, virtuoso bassist, in the per-
formance of ‘‘Concerto for Dou-
ble Bass” by Johann Sperger.
Suttle is the assistant conductor
of the Richmond Symphony. In
addition, the orchestra will pre-
sent music by Handel, Stravin-
sky, and Tchaikovsky.

Other performers scheduled
to appear during the year in-
clude two piano soloists and

both a brass and a wind quintet.

Leon Bates, pianist, will be
seen at the Concert Guild’s se-
cond presentation on Nov. 13.

Movement Toward
Regional Music

by Mark Kinniburgh

Recently, you may have pur-
chased a record album on a
record label such as Warner
Bros., Elektra or Columbia, but
you probably didn’t even see an
album or 45 on the LIMP
records label. That is probably
because of the limited distribu-
tion of these records, but also
for another major reason, the
talent which each label offers.

What is happening all over
the music world is a move away
from the major record pro-
ducers and management, and a
move toward more regional
oriented success formulas. A
band with the appeal of the Cars
on Elektra records is an exam-
ple of a local success made good
on a national market.

The Cars were bums around
Boston, Mass. for a good while
before the backing from a ma-
jor label surfaced. In the in-
terim, however, they were very

well known on regional radio
and interested outsiders
through their practically
homemade, home _ pressed
records and demonstration
tapes.

Major record companies are
now more than ever backing
down on their search for new,
untried talent. They are going
behind successes in regional
markets, such as The
Nighthawks from_ the
Washington, D.C. area, or Exile
from Lousiville, Ky. or
Facedancer from Northern
Virginia. (Each of the above
had several albums on a small,
local label before signing with a
major label.)

Billboard magazine reports
that to produce a new band
from the street, into the recor-
ding studio, and into the record
stores can cost a minimum of
$500,000. A quality demonstra-
tion tape to use as an audition

The members of the quintet are

on Jan. 15. A graduate of the
Manhattan School of Music, he
is perhaps best known for his

“Sonatas and Interludes for

ed a Grammy Award nomina-

Lye and Ear from the Bookstore

Between the ages of 12 and 24 I kept, for

* some earnest reason, a list of every book I

read. Today, I find those notebook listings

with their varied colored inks (even purple),
appalling...

First off, I read far too fast. It was almost
as if I had a master list of Culture. So that a
classic was swallowed whole, checked off and
never opened again. Too, how much time I
had! Books were a window on the world: ac-
tual living offered very few diversions.
Reading was both retreat and recreation.
However, by far the most absurd aspect of
that long list of books is my narrow—almost
minute—range of experience within which to
place the powerful human emotions and
dread crises that I was reading about. How
could I know of murder and soul-searching
guilt when I read Crime and Punishment at
16? The self-destructive passion in Wuthering
Heights at 15? These and similar books told it
with greatness but I had no frame of
reference except a tendency to cry (secretly)

over lost love-affairs.

A marked change appears in the list after I
entered college. A high majority of the books
are out-and-out relaxation types: mystery
stories, romances and humor. The only real
carryover from the earlier years is poetry—
an addiction which I have never lost. Obvious-
ly, in college, especially as I was a science
major with long hours of lab work, textbooks
were the solid reading; lovely trash was for
pleasure.

This message from the past is an important
guide post for me in the Bookstore today. We
must offer a wide variety of recreation
reading. There must be pure delight and ex-
citing excape. But even here there are limits:
a certain level of dignity; a respect for the
= of the English language, and above all
olerance and understanding. P
healthy dash of nonsense. oe

Local Emphasis

for a major recording contract
will invariably run $10,000 after
pre-production costs, actual
studio time, engineering, mix-
ing, remixing and final pressing
or dubbing onto the final
cassette.

It appears that most of to-
day’s working bands are con-
tent to be local favorites as op-
posed to trying to make a dent
in the iron market of nationally
established rock acts. Simon
Kirke of Bad Company reveals
the secret of the hugh success of
the English rock quartet in the
same manner.

“We were wary of the big
record deals at first because
they (the record company ex-
ecutives) had no idea if we’d
last even one more gig. Actual-
ly, we all preferred to play
small clubs and halls until we
were sure that Bad Company as
a band could achieve what
would be called ‘‘commercially
successful’’ status.

Along these same guidelines,
there is a year-old rock band out
of Washington, D.C. by the
name of D. Ceats (pronounced
“deceits”). D. Ceats are the
hottest new wave band in the
metropolitan area, if not the
East coast. They are a band full
of personality and what could
be called ‘‘star-quality”’
because of the amount of
energy which they can develop
onstage backing larger draws
such as theClash on their first
U.S. tour.

D. Ceats record on Washing-

ton’s LIMP records, a label
which is very sympathetic to
the new talent in the area, and
more specifically, rock acts.
LIMP puts out 7” extended play
records which contain two
songs per side, and D. Ceats has
titled their e.p. ‘Monumental’.

Although the production is
very poor due to a limited re-
cording studio, there is an
energy and urgency that ac-
companies live performances
clearly audible on “Monumen-
tal’’.

D. Ceats put the formula to-
gether of: 1. a good, solid base
of local fans, providing an im-
mediate response to new mate-
rial; 2. a local record label will-
ing to press e.p.’s or 45’s ata
risk, and 3. talent enough to ex-
press the musical feelings that
they have to offer.

Consequently, a major re-
cording contract would be very
little risk for both the company
and the band, because each has
a type of insurance. D. Ceats
could continue making Wash-
ington fans happy for years,
even without expanding to a na-
tional level, while Warner or
Polydor could count on at least
a regional market with good
possibilities of semi- or national
acceptance.

A final note. These 7’’ extend-
ed play records are available at
most reputable record stores
for about $2.00, and they are an
excellent way to hear good local
talent while helping to support a
struggling band that someday
could be million sellers.

North

Dallas
Forty

by Dash Coufal

 

The weird part is that while
having a petty narrative
NORTH DALLAS FORTY
leaves a powerful impression:
the movie both fails and suc-
ceeds.

It fails in its attempt to to be
covertly artistic. What is meant
to be a deep and profound rela-
tionship between Nolte and his
girlfriend is hopelessly shallow
and enigmatic.

The movie’s attempts at sym-
bolism (e.g. NORTH DALLAS
FORTY: the football team is
the NORTH DALLAS BULLS,
there are forty men on the foot-
ball squad, and Nolte owns forty
acres of ranch land north of
Dallas) are clever but lack
meaning. Someone _ involved
was pushing hard for art and
failed.

The narrative is spotty. The
characters are there right from
the start rather than being in-
troduced and emerging. Much
of the first quarter of the movie
is spent in confusion trying to
figure out who’s who, with even
strong characters becoming en-
mired in confusion. In order to
catch what’s going on at first
one has to see the beginning
twice.

The movie succeeds in leav-
ing a powerful image. While the
narrative is spotty the charac-
ters are strong and resilient.
Nolte plays an aging football
receiver who is rife with con-
trasts.

On one hand he is the old pro
whose body is bent and torn,
whose hands are the best in the
business, and who risks further
injury just to give one hundred
percent. Yet he is also the cocky
youth who is overconfident, who
thinks he can buck the system,
and who plays for what he can
get out of the game.

While Nolte is the best man on
the team he is also the disrup-
tive element who first sits on
the bench, and later is purged
from the team. In the end he is
wholly the old hand who, losing
his youthful enthusiasm for the

Mock Convention Report

 

Presidential Hopeful Phil Crane Profiled

by Kevin Dwyer

Presidential campaigns have
been starting earlier every four
years than they did before. The
1980 Republican contest kicked
off in August 1978 with a very
early announcement from Rep.
Phil Crane of Northwestern
Chicago, Illinois. Crane figured
that only a start some 27 months
before the election could offset
his terminally low name recog-
nition among voters, even in II-
linois. Carter started early,
Crane figured, so I will too.

What kind of man is Phil
Crane? He and his wife Arlene,
Methodists, have eight
children. He considers himself
a born-again Christian. Crane’s
brother Dan is also a Con-
gressman from downstate.
What about Crane’s politics, the
central issue for a Presidential
candidate? Crane is more ccn-
servative than the undisputed
front runner, former California
Governor Ronald Reagan. On
most issues he has staked out
positions to the right of Reagan.
Crane honestly thinks that the
electorate’s shift to the right
since Reagan’s loss in 1976 is
enough to elect him in 1980.

For an unknown, the Crane
candidacy was achieving a
remarkable success until May
of this year, when a series of
mishaps beset the campaign.
First, Crane fired his campaign
manager, Rich Williamson.
Williamson said Crane lacked
“the commitment or capacity
to wage the sort of campaign
necessary to win.”’ At the same
time, it was revealed that New
Right direct-mail fundraiser
Richard A. Viguerie had raised
an admirable $2.3 million for
the Crane campaign, at the cost
oi over $1.8 million. Crane’s
campaign was acknowledged to
be in debt to Viguerie to the tune
of $500,000.

Following Williamson’s fir-
ing, the entire senior staff

4-

resigned. Several days '~

  

Phone 463-5985

the $2 million Viguerie mailing
list was misplaced by the cam-
paign staff. After the FBI had
been called in, the list was
discovered in the desk drawer it
was supposed to be in. Crane’s
new campaign manager, Iowan
Jerry Harkins, was revealed to
have been an unindicted co-
conspirator in one of the largest
stock frauds in Iowa history.

Enough! you say. But there is
more—and the most serious
problem Crane seems to have is
his strong-willed wife Arlene.
Reports concerning the staff fir-
ings and_ resignations
unanimously place the blame
on Arlene. “I’m even gutsier
than Betty Ford,’’ says Arlene
and her statements and actions
support her claim.

Despite the traditional
backseat role of a candidate’s
wife, this one seems determined
to run the campaign herself.
Her terming the top three aides
“the devil’s triangle’ led to
their firings and resignations.
Personal gossip about the
Cranes goes to lengths seldom
seen in politics. A vituperative
Manchester (N.H.) Union-
Leader article in March, 1979
accused the Cranes of being
sexually promiscuous, heavy
drinkers, power-mad and _in-
veterate partyers. The New
Hampshire legislature roundly
denounced the newspaper. Yet
Arlene, on politics: ‘I love it. . .
love the scheming, the power
grabs, the ego of it all.’’ Of
Williamson and the campaign
organizers, she says, ‘“‘Those
punks weren’t capable of runn-
ing a notions counter much less
a presidential campaign.’ To
quote the Washington Star:
“She is, they say, one tough
customer. In fact, Crane herself
may have gone too far with one
woman who once worked for
Crane, and a slander suit is in
preparation. Believe it or not
she calls he ‘sand “‘Philsie-
poo.”

  

Will Mrs. Crane be Mr.
Crane’s ultimate downfall?
Time will tell, but at least she
has remained in the back-
ground for sometime now.
Crane is back out on the cam-
paign trail, stressing issues like
SALT II, abortion, gun control
and taxes. And the crowds love
it. Most of them haven’t heard
the Arlene Crane horror stories.
They just know the handsome

candidate and like what he
says. And a few primary wins
on the issues can offset a lot of
gossip and maliciousness.

To quote John Connally cam-

Abraham said that no’ new
trial date had been set as of
Tuesday evening and would not
answer any further questions
about the case.

Cold Check

In other business during Mon-
day night’s first EC meeting of
the academic year, the Cold
Check Committee was allowed
to raise its fining power from $5
to $10 for the first bad check, $10
to $20 for the second bad check,
and from $25 to $30 for the third
bad check.

Jim Vines, chairman of the
Cold Check Committee, made it
clear that he and his committee
would take a_ hard-line ap-
proach this year toward stu-
dents who write bad checks.

“The people who bounce a lot
of checks are 50 percent of our
business, which was about
$4,000 last year,”’ Vines told the
EC.

“In the past, in my opinion,
the Cold Check Committee has
been too lax”’ in fining repeat of-
fenders, Vines said

The purpose of the increased
fine, Vines said, ‘‘is to keep it
from being a discount fine for
the students’? who know the
Cold Check Committee will
cover their checks for a smaller
fine than the banks or many
businesses in town would im-
pose.

Vines said that he especially
hoped the increased fines would
stop ‘“‘people from floating
checks hoping to get a deposit
from their parents before the
check bounces. That’s a really
bad habit,”’ he said.

Not voted on by the EC was
another request by Vines that
he be given permission to
distribute lists to merchants in
town of those students barred
from obtaining credit because
they had a history of bouncing
checks.

Vines also requested that the
statute of limitations for first,
second, and third offenders be
raised from one year to two. (If
a student does not bounce
another check within that
period, his record would be
wiped clean.) But the EC dead-
locked 5-5 on the: proposal and
the motion failed.

Cockpit Bands

The University Center Com-
mittee was advanced $500 to
finalize its plans for booking the
All-Stars band in the Cockpit
the night of Thursday, Oct. 4.

To help pay for the band, a $1
cover charge will probably be
charged either at the door or
through advanced ticket sales.
It was also not clear whether
the All-Stars would play one
show or two.

During his request for the
money for the All-Stars Jamie
Small, chairman of the Univer-
sity Center Committee, lashed
into Jerry Darrell, director of
university food services (which
includes the Cockpit), for not
having given ‘“‘any money in the
past for bands in the Cockpit.”’

‘‘He made $1,000 in beer sales
the night the Nighthawks
played (last year),’’ Small said.

“He (Darrell) makes more
money in cne night with a band
than he would make in a week
without one,”’ Small continued.

He said he felt the Cockpit
should ‘‘kick in”’ to help pay for
the band.

But Burr Datz, former assis-
tant manager of W&L food ser-
vices and the man who helped
put most of the bands in the
Cockpit last year, refuted much
of what Small said.

“IT remember in the case of
the Jack Skinner Band from
California that the Cockpit paid
$70 to help make up for the
guaranteed price not met in
cover charge collections,’’ Datz
said when asked about Small’s
statements.

He said he also- recalled
another instance where the

Cockpit threw in $40-$50 to a
band to make up the difference
between the guaranteed pay-
ment and the cover charge
take.

Datz also cited food and
refreshments provided to band
members by the Cockpit.

“Jamie is under a misconcep-
tion,” he said. “To say that
Jerry Darrell makes money in
there (the Cockpit) hand over
fist is wrong. He does a lot that
just can’t be measured in
dollars and cents.”’

S.A.B.

Also at the EC meeting
Abraham verbally spanked the
Student Activities Board for not
having given notice of their
meeting last Sunday night.

SAB chairman Bill Ridge said
that it had just been “an in-
troductory meeting,’’ strictly
for the SAB members to get ac-
quainted with each other, and
that nothing important happen-
ed.

Ridge and his co-chairman
David Harpole then went on to
report about the Homecoming
weekend activities for Friday,
Oct. 5. The bands Sandcastle
and The Catalinas will play
beginning at 8 p.m. in Doremus
Gym. They were reportedly
booked last year because
Homecoming comes so early
this year.

The EC also adopted the
following statement:

“The Honor System applies
fully to the University Library,
Evans Dining Hall, and the Law
School Library. Students are
advised to become familiar
with the procedures of each and
abide by them.”’

Price War In Lexington?
No, Just Lower Beer Prices

by Dick Moss

While everyone’s denying it,
there does seem to be a beer keg
price war going on in Lex-
ington.

Of the five major stores in-

volved in the beer keg business: -

East Lexington Grocery: Red
Front; Central Lunch; Lee’s
Corner; and the Paramount
Inn, at least three have lowered
either some or all of their prices
for the duration of Rush.

Jim Bowen, manager of the
East Lexington Grocery, said
that while he has lowered his
prices on Old Milwaukee and
Black Label kegs, he does not
think that a price war, as such,
is occuring. He did admit.
however, that ‘‘everyone’s
scrounging around to get the

business” that has suddenly
grown with the closing of Clyde
Mull’s College Inn.

Jim Greene of Lee’s Corner
Restaurant also denied that
there was a price war, but he
too stated that things were “‘up
in the air’’ as far as the fraterni-
ty keg business went.

The Paramount Inn, which
purchased Clyde Mull’s conces-
sion and records, according to
Wayne Hartless had to lower
their prices to compete with ‘‘a
certain place” (which he would
not name), which is “‘selling its
kegs at only one to two dollars
profit, rather than the usual
five’.

Elizabeth McKemy of the Red
Front Grocery Store, said
merely, ‘‘I don’t think we’re ina
price war.”

Mr. Duck of Central Lunch
said, ‘“‘ I haven’t changed my
prices since last year, and I
don’t intend to. I just don’t do
business that way.”’

One of the cheaper beer keg
buys in town last year was Old
Milwaukee at the College Inn
for thirty dollars.. When this
figure is taken into account,
along with the 13% inflation
rate of the economy over the

summer, and the prices givenin ©

the price chart below, the

results are interesting.

At any rate, if you start doing

keg business this Rush, be

prepared, because after Rush,
after exactly who is doing
business with whom has been
settled, prices may very well go
up.

Randolph--Macon
Women’s College
in Lynchburg, Virginia.

Over the mountain in Lynch-
burg, Randolph Macon
Women’s College looms in the
distance complete with pines
house parties, Smith Hall mix-
ers, The Dell and about 750
women.

Those who brave this 40-mile
drive on Route 501, also will find
off-campus night spots, Lynch-
burg College, ‘‘The Texas
Tavern’’, in addition to ‘‘Randy
Mac’’, or ‘“‘Macon Bacon’’, as
known to those blessed with suc-
cess there.

Security at RMWC has
noticeably increased. New
alarms now guard dormitory
doors traditionally known as
easy entrances and a larger, all
new, beefed-up security force
makes its presence known
throughout the campus.

Parietal violators will be
dealt harsher punishments, so
they say, with automatic pro-
secution for  tresspassing.
Father Time advises sneeking
up the fire escapes. ‘‘Just don’t
park in the fire lanes.”’

Parking is frequently your
first problem. The best bet is to
get there early and to look for a
space in the main lot. You will
be ticketed if you park on the
Main front drive as well as on
surrounding streets.

Once on campus, the next
‘wall of defense comes when you
enter one of the dormitories and
are met by a quiet, sometimes
annoyed, ‘‘guard’’ who watches
the sign-book, listens to your
phone calls and forbids you to
walk past her until your escort
arrives. Once properly signed
in, you are free to go.

Your date, according to the

A Freshman’s

Guide To The

Surrounding
Women’s Colleges

 

rules, should be at your side at
all times. She’s the one who gets
to yell ‘man in the hall”
everytime you-round a corner
Hallmates upon such_notioe
then usually peek through thei:
doors and giggle.

Visiting hours are posted al
all dormitory entrances. Week
end parietals are longer. Then
you can stay until one or two.
During the week though, it’s out
by 11:00. These hours ensure
that no hanky-panky goes on.
After all, everyone knows that
“that activity’’ only goes on in
the wee hours of the morning.

Pine House parties are usual-
ly free. Mixers are not. Three
dollars per person is standard
plus a quarter per beer.

Sometimes you will get the
feeling that you are paying for
everything. How ludicrous!
Fraternities bring free beer for
all at the ‘‘pines’’. Mixers are
different though. The entrance
fee and extra charge for beer
surely must go to pay clean-up
costs and the price of getting
your hand stamped at the door.

Macon offers a diverse crowd
of ‘intellectual’? women. Con-
versations range from sugges-
tively stimulating to rather
amusing. Dress is varied but
undoubtedly someone will com-
ment on your outfit whether in
front of you or behind your
back. An entertaining evening
certainly can be had by all.

After the party, well it’s back
to beautiful Lexington, over the
mountain where many have lost
their lunch as well as hub caps
at Horseshoe Bend. Many ques-
tion why we go down the road.
After all, we are located in the
beautiful Shenandoah Valley
where Washington and Lee
gentlemen have little problem
finding dates.

The History Of Beer— In The Beginning

According to Chinese legend,
its creation was decreed by
heaven. Egyptian mythology
credits the gods Iris and Osiris
as having been the first to make
it. An Assyrian tablet of 2000
B.C. relates that it was one of
the provisions taken aboard the
Ark. And in the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, a slen-
der golden straw on display is
said to have been used by Queen
Shubad of Mesopotamia to sip it
in royal celebration.

The subject, of course, is
beer—one of mankind’s oldest
occupations and enjoyments.

But what is this mysterious
brew? What had Isis wrought?

that despite the popularity of
this ancient beverage—more
than 160 million barrels of beer
were consumed in the United
States in 1978—few beer buffs
know much about its origins or
the art of brewing.

It is believed that contrary to
the usual course of cultural
migration, the consumption of
beer and the knowledge of
brewing were not transmitted
from one race or nation to
another. Brewing developed in-

donia to the world, brewing had
developed among most peoples
on the continents of Europe,
Asia and Africa. Brewing ex-
panded even further through
the Middle Ages, but beers of
ancient times and even of the
Middle Ages were not like beers
of today. Generally a sweetish
beverage then, beer was often
mixed with pungent spices to
make it more palatable.

But perhaps the biggest ad-
vance in the brewing process
was the introduction into the

brew of hops, an ingredient that
added aroma to beer and also
served as a preservative. Hops
were used first in brewing by
the Finns of ancient times, but
were not used again until the
ninth century inGermany.

Lagered or aged beer, which
originated in Germany in the
eighth century, was a brew that
was allowed to ferment and
ripen at low temperatures,
brought to a mellow maturity
and enlivened with natural car-
bonation. Originally, because of
the cold temperatures needed,
it had to be brewed in the winter
and stored in caves.

While Germans brewed with
hops seven centuries before

most other nations, England
followed suit in the 1500s. Enor-
mous quantities of hopped
English beer were exported to

the continent, especially
France.
Ale, however, which was

believed to have originated in
England, was still brewed
without hops. This was at a time
when approximately 13 million
barrels of beer were consumed
annually in England, which had
a population of just over five
million.

The colonization of America
developed new markets and
gave a marked increase to the
production of beer in England.

Winning Soccer?

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

This could be the year. After five years of mediocri-
ty, it looks like the soccer Generals have come alive.

While the W&L football team was down at Emory &
Henry losing its second game of the year, the 1979 ver-
sion of the W&L soccer team opened its regular
season Saturday with an impressive 2-1 victory over
the Hampden-Sydney Tigers on Wilson Field. The
Generals were led by junior forward Mark Turner
who scored both W&L goals and by tri-captains Doug
Seitz, Dana Samuelson and Doug Dorsey (who each
played an outstanding two-way game. )

But individual praise seems unimportant to this
year’s soccer team. Saturday’s win was a total team
effort. Team play is emphasized and has become an
effective weapon used by Coach Rolf Piranian.

“This is a much more balanced team than I’ve had
in the past. We have a very cohesive group and the
captains have done an outstanding job,’”’ explained
Piranian after the game.

Piranian attributes much of the improvement of
this year’s squad to the development of the upper-
class players, the leadership of the tri-captains and
the addition of several good freshman players. “We
have some talented freshmen who are playing well,”’
said the General coach, adding, ‘‘this has been a big
plus for us.”’

And there has been improvement—vast improve-
ment. Improvement in team offense. Improvement in
team defense. Improvement in all-around team hus-
ile. The passing game was crisp and accurate while
the stubborn General defense stymied the Sydney at-
tack. Except for one short lapse in the second half,
W&L dominated every facet of the game and played
almost flawless soccer.

Another improvement has been in their goalkeep-
ing. Junior Kevin Carney has developed into a
capable and dependable goalkeeper for W&L. He is
presently chasing the school record for most career
saves.

Although soccer is not my favorite spectator sport
(I’ve always preferred football and hockey), it was a
pleasure to watch the Generals play Saturday. They
were explosive and exciting. And from the cheers I
heard in the bleachers, I would assume the other 150
or so fans who watched the game would agree. It’s a
shame more of you weren't out there...but that’s
another story altogether.

Anyway, Washington and Lee University has a good
soccer team this year. They played a superb game
against Sydney and hopefully they played just as well

 

Tailback Stewart Atkinson will be in action this Saturday as the Generals entertain Centre College.
Atkinson is the Generals’ leading ground gainer.

Generals Lose 12-6;
Atkinson Gains 164

by Bill Whalen
Asst. Sports Editor

Leo Durocher, the elder
statesman of baseball
managers, once said, ‘‘nice
guys finish last.’’ Leo Durocher
cbviously had W&L football in
mind when he uttered those in-
famous words.

Head coach Gary Fallon is a
nice guy—too nice to have a
career record of 2-10 after last
Saturday’s 12-6 loss to Emory &
Henry. Let Woody Hayes or Bo
Schembechler lose’ every
Saturday—they‘re poor enough
sports to deserve so.

The General’s record slipped
to 0-2 after last week’s game, a
loss in which the Generals made
only a handful of mistakes and
shut out the Wasps for three
quarters of the game. The
Generals led in every offensive
category except one—the score.

‘“‘We got ourselves in an early
hole,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘Our drives
were Stalled and we couldn’t get
those needed inches. We domi-
nated the game,’ added the
coach, ‘‘except for twice when
Jimmy Wenke was stopped in-

 

ches short of a first down and
Stewie Atkinson was stopped
short ‘‘.

The Generals started the
game with the same mistake-
prone football that resulted in
last week’s 30-0 rout. On the se-
cond play of the game, starting
qui ick Rich Hachenburg
fumoled on the W&L 27 to set up
the first E&H touchdown.
Wenke replaced Hachenburg
later in the quarter.

On their second possession of
the game, the Wasps moved 99
yards in 15 plays to boost their
lead to 12-0. That ended the
scoring in the first half as the
Generals found themselves shut
out for the fifth and sixth
straight quarters.

The second half was a dif-
ferent story. Atkinson, who had
picked up 63 yards rushing in
the first half, exploded for 101 in
the second half to put W&L back
in the game.

“It was Stewie’s best per-
formance,” said Fallon of
Atkinson, who carried the ball

38 times without fumbling. Not
only did Atkinson not fumble,
but the entire team committed
only three turnovers—a far cry
from the week before. °

Still, the Generals could only
produce six points despite roll-
ing up 266 yards on offense. The
reason was simple—W&L could
not move the ball for short yard-
age on fourth down.

In the fourth quarter, Atkin-
son was stopped short on fourth
and two with the ball on the
E&H 26. Another drive was
stopped deep in Wasp territory
after a Wenke interception.

One of the standouts was
backup quarterback Wenke,
who probably earned the star-
ting slot for this Saturday’s
game against Centre College.

Fallon described Centre as
being ‘‘a physical team, quick
and aggressive. They have a
breakaway threat on offense
and two standout performers in
their defensive secondary,”
said the coach.

Kickoff time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Now, I’m not promising that the soccer team will go
undefeated—or even that they will win the ODAC. But
they will win more games than they have during the
past five years. That may be more than we can say
about a certain other W&L athletic team.

Dove Hunting
In Rockbridge

by Jim Feinman

The first half of a split dove
season opened in Virginia on
September 8, with the. Rock-
bridge County area offering
good dove hunting for
Washington and Lee students.

The season will run through
November 3, at which time it
will close and re-open Decem-
ber 22-January 3. Shooting is
allowed after 12 noon and the
daily limit is 12 birds.

In Rockbridge, the dairy
country to the north and the
James and Maury River basins
are choice areas. Many hunters
who were able to find harvested
corn fields during the first week
of the season reported plenty of
birds and quick limits. Other
hunters, however, were frus-
trated in finding a field to hunt
as a late growing season has left
standing corn in more than one
nimrod’s favorite field.

All hunters should be sure to
secure the landowner’s permis-
sion before taking to the field.
Most landowners are receptive
if approached in a polite and
considerate manner. Outdoors-
men, especially W&L students,
should treat hunting property

by Bill Whalen

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer Generals played a good first
half in yesterday’s match on
Wilson Field. The second half
was a different story.

The Generals, who had
played well enough to earn a 1-1
first half deadlock with Division
II West Virginia Wesleyan,
were outscored 4-1 in the final
period to end up on the short
side of a 5-2 decision.

‘‘We made some defensive er-
rors,” said a very disappointed
coach Rolf Piranian. ‘‘We show-
ed we could play with those
guys and we never quit,”’ com-
mented the coach.

‘he contest was started be-
fore only 20 spectators, half of
which were other athletes
waiting for their own practice to
begin. The crowd later ‘‘swell-
ed”’ to over 50 but the game was
decided by then.

Wesleyan started the scoring
with the game not quite five
minutes old. Martin Woodstock
blasted a 20-yard shot that bare-
ly eluded W&L goalie Kevin
Carney by landing in the lower

right hand corner of the net.

The Generals retaliated five
minutes later on a penalty kick
by Brian Williams. Williams
was given a free shot when a
Wesleyan defender was called
on a hand ball penalty in front of
his net.

W&L was able to keep the
game deadlocked thanks to
some strong defense by Carney
and his teammates. On one se-
quence, Carney was caught out
of the net but stopped a point-
blank shot whose rebound was
headed away from the goal by
the ever-present Williams.

Unfortunately for the
Generals, no such luck prevail-
ed in the second half. It took the
visitors only two minutes to net
their second goal, a 10-yard chip
shot by Matt Engle that crossed
the goal diagonally.

Three minutes later, Engle
netted his second goal of the
game by scoring in almost the
same way. Wesleyan now had a
3-1 lead and was seemingly in
control of the game.

“That third goal broke our

backs,”’ said Piranian. ‘‘It look-
ed like the man (Engle) was off-
sides, but you can’t rely on that
as an excuse.”

Not content with only two
goals, Engle picked his way
through the Generals’ weaken-
ing defense for his third and
fourth goals of the afternoon.
Wesleyan moved ahead 4-1 at
the 10-minute mark and added
their fifth goal at the 15-minute
mark.

W&L was able to make the
score look semi-respectable by
adding one more goal less than
a minute later. Ben Muskin
scored on a deflection of Tad
Renner’s shot to end the scoring
at 5-2.

Despite a _ losing _ per-
formance, Piranian still has
faith in his team’s ability. “I
believe that we can win as long
as we play a good game against
every team,” stated the coach.

The Generals’ next game is
Wednesday, September 26,
against the University of Rich-
mond. The match will be held at
Richmond and game time is
3:00 p.m.

Water Polo Begins

by Dave Johnson

The 1979 W&L water polo
team opens its season next
weekend with the Johns Hop-
kins Invitational Tournament.
The two-day tournament, which
will be held at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Sept.
28-29, is one of six tournaments
in which the water polo
Generals will compete this fall.

Unlike most W&L varsity
teams, the water polo squad
plays only in tournaments, with
no dual matches on the sched-
ule. This is due to the large
distances between collegiate
water polo teams here on the
East Coast.

The team enters this season
with a new coach and a lot of op-
timism and desire. The new
coach, Page Remillard, comes
to W&L from California, which
is the water polo capital of the
world. Last season, as coach at
Claremont Men’s College in
Claremont, CA, Remillard com-
piled a 20-8 record against top

national competition, while tak-
ing the conference champion-
ship.

Remillard is outspoken and
extremely positive concerning
his views on water polo and on
the way it should be coached.
He feels that his time is best
spent on the pool deck coaching
his players, and not in the office
dealing with the administrative
duties that plague coaches of
every sport. To this end, he is
engaging several students who
are interested in taking over
some of this administrative
work, including recruiting,
keeping statistics and manag-
ing finances.

W&L has consistently finish-
ed second to Richmond in the
Virginia State Championships
over the past several years.
Last year the team posted an
impressive 15-9 record in the
highly competitive Southern
Water Polo Conference. Led by
senior co-captains Mike Foley

Hoke Wins
Scholarship

 

Harry Franklin ‘‘Chip”’ Hoke,
III, a four-year All-American
swimmer at Washington & Lee
and a June honor graduate of
the University, was awarded a
$1,500 NCAA _ Post-Graduate
Scholarship this summer.

Hoke, a resident of Rich-
mond, Va., and 1975 graduate of
St. Christopher’s High,
becomes the sixth Washington
& Lee student-athlete since 1970
to receive the coveted award.
He joins Bill Brotherton (W&L
‘75) as the only W&L swimmers
to win the scholarship.

“Chip had an_ outstanding
career at W&L, academically
and athletically, and is most
deserving of this prestigious
scholarship,” said W&L athletic
director and physical education
chairman William D. McHenry.
“As an All-American swimmer
and straight-A student, Chip
represented the University in a
manner with which we are all

- proud and pleased.”’

Hoke: won six varsity letters

at W&L, four in swimming and
two in water polo. He received
All-American swimming honors
in the 1650-yard freestyle event
(senior year), and 800 freestyle
relay (freshman, sophomore,
and junior years), and the 500
freestyle (sophomore year).
Hoke helped the Generals attain
three top-ten national rankings
in swi ing and a pair of second-
place state finishes in water
polo.

Hoke graduated second in a
class of 305 this past June, earn-
ing summa cum laude honors
for his 3.95 grade point average.
At W&L’s’ commencement
ceremonies, Hoke received the
Algernon Sydney Sullivan
Medallion, awarded by the
faculty to the graduate who ex-
cels in high living ideals,
‘spiritual qualities, and
generous service to others.

Hoke, 22, is included in Who’s
Who in American Colleges and
Universities, and was inducted
into Phi Beta Kappa, the na-
tional scholarship fraternity,
and Omicron Delta Kappa, the
national honorary leadership
fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914. In
addition, he served as vice-
president of the W&L chapter of
Lambda Chi Alpha.

A mathematics/physics ma-
jor, Hoke will use his scholar-
ship at the University of North
Carolina, where he plans to ob-
tain his doctorate in
mathematics.

Lax Team Opens Fall Practice

by Kip Gordon

Although the season opener is
still many months away, pre-
paration for W&L’s number one
spectator sport is already well
under way.

On September 12, the lacrosse
Generals commenced a four-
week practice session in which
new talent is being evaluated
and fundamentals reviewed, as
recruitment and fall practice
are vital steps toward the final
product which is showcased in
the spring.

Seventy-five players are com-
peting for positions on the 1980
W&L lacrosse team. Thirty-five
freshmen, about a dozen. of
whom were recruited, reported
to fall practice. Of the 35, Em-
mer expects about 10 to make
the varsity squad.

The first week of fall practice
was devoted entirely to the
freshmen for a period of evalua-
tion which one freshman
described as ‘‘vigorous and in-
tense.’’ Lacrosse fans can get
their first look at the rookies on
October 14 in a game against

Under Remillard

( continued from page 11);

‘and Biff Martin, along with

fellow senior Drew Pillsbury,
the team and its coach have
high hopes for this season.
Although he falls short of
making any actual predictions,
it is obvious from talking with
Remillard that he is very confi-
dent in his players and is op-
timistic about W&L’s chances
of capturing the conference
championship in his first year
here. The key to this goal will be
to defeat Richmond, the peren-
nial powerhouse in this area.
East Carolina is also expected
to present the Generals stiff

competition.

Remillard is convinced that
water polo is on the rise in the
Bast as a major intercollegiate
sport. He is insistent that he and
the W&L water polo team will
play a large part in that rise.

There is a long road to be
traveled before reaching the
Southern Water Polo Con-
ference Championships, which
will be held here at W&L,
November 2-3. Considering the
attitude, talent and energy ex-
hibited by the coach and
players alike, that road could
quite possibly be a bright and
pleasant one.

the Roanoke College freshmen
which will be played on Wilson
Field. The game will provide
the coaching staff with a view of
the new talent under game

situations before the squad is .

trimmed to 45 for pre-season
practice which begins in
February.

The annual Alumni game,
always the highlight of fall
lacrosse, is scheduled for Oc-
tober 7. It will feature the 24
returning veterans of last

year’s varsity as well as a
number of. highly-talented

 

alumni. The game will be
played, as it is every year, on
Wilson Field.

In spite Of the large fall tur-
nout this year, the familiar
question remains: Can
Washington and Lee lacrosse

continue to compete against the
larger schools without the aid of
athletic scholarships? Coach
Emmer himself is uncertain
about the future and said, ‘‘As’
long as we can stay com-
petitive, we’ll keep playing
Division I lacrosse.”

Basketball Team Travelling To Europe

by Bill Whalen
Asst. Sports Editor

Last Spring we reported on a
certain W&L sports team’s
plans to travel to Europe. We
were not joking.

The basketball Generals are
definitely going to Europe over
Christmas vacation. Following
the tour of Europe, the team
will rest in Nassau for a few
days and then return to the
mainland for a tournament in
Florida.

There is only one problem
with a trip of this magnitude—
money. To get the players,
coaches and the rest of the en-
tourage through the tour, the
cost will be approximately
$25,000.

“We're about 70 percent of
the way there” said assistant
coach Jim Casciano. If this is
true, that would give the team a
total of between $17,000 and
$18,000 leaving them almost
$8,000 short of their goal.

To earn the extra money, the
team has several projects set
up. Among the top three possi-
bilities are a raffle for a vaca-
tion in Myrtle Beach, S.C., a
raffle for a ‘“‘basket of cheer’

(full of beer and liquors) and
possibly a raffle for a chance to
travel with the team.

Casciano also mentioned two
other gimmicks. The team
might hold a ‘‘24-hour running

marathon’’ or sponsor a
“eoncert out at Zollman’s
Pavillion.”

The entire touring group will
consist of 20 players, three
coaches, one trainer and 12
other people making a total of

38. The players, who each had to
raise $625 this summer (plus
$200 out of their own pockets),
will be selling raffle tickets at
this Saturday’s football game.

As of this writing, 12 seats
were still available to anyone
who wants to travel to Europe
with the Generals. The cost of
the trip would be approximately

$900 and does not cover the trip
to the Bahamas and Florida.
Anyone interested should get in
touch with Casciano or Head
Coach Verne Canfield.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Miscarriage of Justice

Several weeks ago now, an Evans Dining Hall con-
struction worker made an apparent attempt to break
into a female law student’s room. That’s good jour-
nalistic form for saying that the guy broke down the
woman’s window screen and may have actually en-
tered her room through the window. We will never
know for sure because the frightened student fled her
room to take refuge elsewhere with a friend. She had
been bothered before by the workman and did not
want to take her chances again.

What is important about this case is that today,
over two weeks after the incident, the man has not
been prosecuted and no charges are even pending
against him. ‘In order to press charges and pro-
secute,’’ Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. Read
told our reporter John Billmyre, ‘‘an intent to commit
crimes prior to the offense of break-in must be

established.”’

What legalese is this? There are a number of nag-
ging questions in this most bizarre case. Perhaps
there is not enough evidence to prosecute the intruder
on charges of attempted rape, but could he not have
been prosecuted for destruction of private property?
Why were no finger or footprints taken by the Lex-
ington police when they arrived on the scene? The
most nagging question of all is why is this man still
roaming the streets as if he had done nothing wrong?

The Commonwealth’s Attorney claims that ‘‘a
pecularity”’ in Virginia law prevented him from pro-
secuting the worker for the break-in and he hinted
that the reason the Lexington police department was
unable to positively identify the man for destruction
of property was their gross ineptitude. But, in the true
tradition of bureaucratic buck passing, Chief of
Police James A. Kirby says that it was Read’s deci-
sion not to prosecute, while Read claims that both
men had a hand in deciding to do nothing.

Meanwhile, the only group to take any decisive ac-
tion was the University, which told the worker that he
would no longer be allowed on school property—a
move that had the effect of firing him from his job.

We find this whole situation very disturbing. A
potentially dangerous man is still prowling the streets
of Lexington while the police and Commonwealth’s
Attorney sit idly by. And we cannot help wondering if
this city’s law enforcement officials wouldn’t be bet-
ter occupied if they devoted more time to criminals
than parking tickets and noise violations.

Getting Dumped

Persiflage

It’s amazing how insensitive some people can be. Here I sit, emo-
tionally crushed, and the only thing these journalists can think of is
their deadlines. These alleged human beings expect me to crank
out the words after having gone through a devastating and
traumatic experience. Evidently, a broken heart isn’t a good
enough excuse to get out of writing for this rag sheet.

Look, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t talk this way. It’s just that I’m very
distraught.

She was everything to me. Although she had the intelligence of a
toaster, she made up for it in other ways. Her acrobatic body and
rabbit-like inclinations might not have been enough for some peo-
ple, but I’ve never been a snob.

We used to go everywhere together. My room, her room, a motel,
a car—it didn’t matter to us. Ours was a love that seemed capable
of enduring the strain of time.

Alas, it was not to be. While we were apart this summer she
began to change. On my return to school she told me that she had to
be alone for awhile, that she had to find herself. Maybe it was the
way that I laughed in her face that made her suspect that I wasn’t
very sympathetic to her emotional needs.

Anyway, it ended just a few days ago. She’s going on to major in
dance while touring Europe with Daddy’s American Express card.
Me? Well, I’m just sitting here with a six-pack, a naive young
freshman girl and a lot of imagination, trying to kill the pain.

Has Social Security Become The
Nation’s Largest Welfare System

Donald Lambro

With all the pious rhetoric swirling about the social
security system, no one seems able to summon forth
the courage to say out loud what a few economists
have now realized, namely, that for many young,
middle- and upper income Americans just entering
the labor force, social security’s retirement program
is arotten investment.

Certainly, for retired workers and those ap-
proaching retirement, social security remains a
bargain. These workers have been taxed at the
substantially lower rates of the past while their total
future benefits have been raised far out of proportion
to what they have contributed into the fund.

For example, a 25-year-old man who began work in
1937, when the program began, upon retirement in
1978 had paid in a maximum employee share of only
$8,728. Today, this worker is receiving a monthly
benefit check: of $459.80, or $5517.60 per year. At this
rate he will recover his payments in less than 32
months—assuming they earned interest at the time
they were taxed, at 5 percent per year compounded
annually. If the worker is married with a spouse age
65 or older, his monthly check is $689.70, and it will
take only twenty-one months to recoup his share of
the social security tax plus the interest his money
would have earned over forty years.

increases to 6 percent, the couple’s annual social
security taxes in three years will climb to $2,803. By
1981, their total employer-employee tax will be $5,506.

Each year the social security fund receives nearly
$112 billion from 110 million workers. And each month
it sends out almost $5 billion in checks to 21.5 million

But the option of staying out of social security is
available only to people who work for the govern-
ment—like members of Congress and federal civilian
workers—and for those who are privileged enough to
work for nonprofit organizations.

State and local governments also are able to

But most workers live considerably longer than
these payments would allow. Today the rest of the
retired worker’s benefits come out of the earnings of
the nation’s current work force. This is why social
security is anything but an insurance or pension
scheme: It is the nation’s largest welfare program.

The story is considerably different, however, for
those just beginning their working lives. These
workers—people who have been working for several
years and those just getting started—will be paying

vastly more in social security taxes than they can
ever expect to recoup in pension benefits during their
retirement years.

When social security’s retirement provisions are
examined it is clear the plan is an abysmal invest-
-ment for young workers. They are finding, par-
ticularly this year, that sharply rising payroll taxes
are expropriating bigger chunks of their weekly in-
come. Under the tax rate hikes enacted by Congress
in 1977, social security levies will eat up nearly 14 per-
cent of all payrolls by 1987, compared with less than
two percent in 1940. It is no wonder that today, among
all federal, state, and local taxes, the bite of social
security is second in size to that of the federal income
tax.

On January 1, 1979, workers found that the max-
imum tax had shot up from $1.070.85 to $1,403.77. That
is because the payroll tax rose this year from 6.05
percent to 6.15 percent and total wages subject to
social security taxes went up from $17,000 to $22,900.

This sharp escalation, however, is only the beginn-
ing. Social security taxes as set by Congress are due
to rise dramatically in the years ahead in order to
finance expanded benefits for an ever increasing
number of beneficiaries. By 1981 the maximum
employee share of the tax will be $1975.05, compared
to the $374.40 maximum that workers paid in 1970,
and taxes for workers earning the maximum taxable
income will nearly triple in the next decade.

Married working couples will be among the hardest
hit‘in terms of their total tax bite. For a couple, each
earning $17,700, the combined social security tax last
year was $2,141. Their employers’ matching tax
payments, which after all are paid on their behalf,
pushed their annual total to $4,283. Allowing salary

As this table illustrates, the percentage of
both the employee and employer contribu-
tions to Social Security has increased
dramatically over the past several years with

the percentage of contribution and the tax-
able earnings limit being pushed ever higher
each year. Social Security levies will eat up
nearly 14 percent of all payrolls by 1987.

 

retirees, $1.5 billion for 7.6 million widows and
children, and $900 million for 4.8 million disabled. It
also pays out an average of $1.4 billion per month in
medicare payments to 9.6 million recipients.

Best To Get Out

A relatively small number of economists have
finally begun to question the program’s true value as
a retirement plan for moderate- and upper-income
Americans in the years ahead. Is social security a
good buy for these and other Americans? Jodie Allen,
once an analyst for a Washington economic research
firm and now a top assistant to Labor Secretary Ray
Marshall, is one of the few to have spoken frankly
about it: “Social Security is no longer as good a buy
as it once was for the average, relatively well-paid
worker,” she said. ‘Anyone who can legally do so,’’
she added, ‘‘will do well to opt for his own private
system of retirement benefits.”

withdraw from social security, and since 1970 more
than 477 separate groups have taken themselves out
of the system. Another 284 muneipalities have given
notice of their intention to withdraw.

San Jose, Calif., is one community that has with-
drawn and had added benefits to its own pension plan
which, a city official siad, ‘‘provides better benefits
than by continuing in social security.”’

Employer’s Share

Figuring out whether the social security retirement
component is a good buy in and of itself, depends
largely upon whether an employee counts his employ-
er’s matching tax share when computing the overall
return on his or her “investment.”

Robert Myers, formerly chief actuary for the
Social Security Administration, believes strongly

Social Security Has Become A Rotten Investment

even proposition.

that it is ‘dead wrong”’ to include the employer’s
share because, he says, that money “should be con-
sidered as being pooled for the general benefit of all
covered workers in the system.”

Most economists, however, disagree. Rudolph Pen-
ner, director of tax policy studies at the American
Enterprise Institute, correctly argues that the em-
ployer’s matching share is paid on the worker’s
behalf and that some share of it, if not all, must be
considered payment in lieu of wages. In other words,

If this worker, at age 65, were to take just his own
investment payments and buy a life insurance annui-

a yearly income of $90,030 for life, $15,522 per year

bearing account during his working years. The pre-
sent value of his benefits-to-taxes figures out to 94.4
percent, however, als close to a break-even point. If
this worker bought the same type of annuity with his
invested payments, at retirement he would receive
an annual income of $104,714, or $21,854 more per
year than social security would pay.

Even figures compiled by the social security
system’s own actuaries indicate that the program is
not a good buy for a single male worker, age 22, who
always earns at least the maximum wage base on
which the payroll tax is levied. Using their figures,
the present value of that individual’s benefits upon
retirement as projected for the year 2022—will only
be 35 percent of the present value of the social securi-

generation would find that its initial net Social Securi-
ty wealth was negative....Each generaltion would
pay taxes with a greater present value than the
benefits it received.”’

The Harvard economists said that of 150 million
Americans 18 years of age or older, about 50 million
have negative net social security wealth. Older peo-
ple have a positive net social security wealth
‘because they are closer to receiving benefits and
have fewer taxpaying years left.”

In another study, June O’Neill, a Congressional
Budget Office economist, sets the real rate of return,
adjusted for inflation, for those now entering the
system at between 1 percent and 2.2 percent for mar-
ried couples, with a negative return for single men.

In a paper presented to the American Economic
Association O'Neill said the rate of return on social
security investment over the long haul “is expected
to fall below 2 percent in real terms for workers retir-
ing over the next 75 years.” Her figures are based
solely on the retirement tax plus survivors’ benefits.

Publishing prices’ for
Washington and Lee’s yearbook
have gone up $1,200, Calyx’s
business manager, John
Hamilton, said at Monday’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

The new price, set at
$10,219.70 was blamed on higher
paper prices, a cover costing
$100 more and a_ larger
allowance for corrections now
set at $1,000.

Failure to continue a three-
year contract with the Hunter
Publishing Co. would force the
Calyx to rebate a two percent
discount savings for the past
two years.

The E.C. voted unanimously

SAB Spanked

Verbally spanking the S.A.B.
again, the E.C. continued its
discussion on lack of publicity
for their past meeting.

“I was a little bit mad that no
signs were up for the Sunday
night meeting,’’ said Senior
E.C. Representative Jay
Blumberg. ‘I registered my
complaint with Harpole and
Ridge. It happened that there

Washington and Lee University

was a very important deci-
sion.”’

The decision discussed was
the feasibility of celebrating
Fancy Dress with the alumni.

Suspect Held;
Goods Recovered

by Sam Campbell

A laborer from Lexington,
and an undetermined number of
juveniles have been arrested in
connection with a robbery over
the summer at the Pi Kappa
Alpha house.

According to Lexington
Police Chief James .A. Kirby,
Anthony Wayne Higgins, 19, has
been charged with two counts of
receiving stolen goods and four
counts of contributing to the
delinquency of a minor. The
robbery occurred in June, but
the losses weren’t determined
until the occupants of the house
returned this fall.

Charles Murray does a real
good job watching the frater-
nities during the summer, and

he did report the burglary, but
we had no way of knowing what
was missing until the students
began showing up again, ‘‘ Kir-
by said.

Investigating Officer John
Colbert said that one speaker
and two amplifiers had been
recovered, and the investiga-
tion is continuing. When asked
if this was part of a contracting
operation, with the defendant
paying the juveniles to break in-
to the house and steal the stereo
equipment, Colbert replied,
“That’s exactly what’s happen-
ing.”’

Higgins has been released on
$2,000 bond, with trial set for
October 16 in Rockbridge Coun-
ty General District Court. Trial
has been set in Juvenile Court
for October 19.

imately 5,000 attended Fancy
Dress.

Three alternatives were con-
sidered. One would bar alumni
invitations, another would limit
the amount of alumni tickets on
a first-come, first-serve basis,
or moving the party to the
Warner Center.

Exclusion of the alumni
would not satisfy the fire code
capacity. Undergraduate and
law school students with dates
would still overload the building
with a possible 3,400. This also
does not include faculty invita-
tions.

Considers

Barring

by David Greer
W&L Alumni will not be in-
vited to attend Fancy Dress
Ball this year, the SAB ten-
tatively decided Sunday. The
Ball will be held in the Student
Center.

The decision to allow only
students, faculty, and _ staff
came after 5,000 persons attend-
ed last year’s ball. The capacity
of the Student Center, including
the dining hall is 2,139.

The fear of a fire is the major
factor in deciding to limit the at-
tendance.

See Letter to the Editor
on page 10.

 

The Student Activities Board
first voted to hold the ball in the
gymnasiums and to allow alum-
ni to attend. This decision was
revoked after the SAB discuss-
ed the logistics of having the
ball there.

Problems lay in the immense
area to decorate, the locating of
several activities in two gyms
and a classroom, and the at-
mosphere. “‘It’ll look like your
high-school prom,’’ said Jamie
Small.

Last year, 600 to 650 alumni
and their dates attended Fancy
Dress. This year, one ticket per
student will be printed. A stu-
dent can sell his ticket to
whomever he pleases.

The Student Activities Board
will meet at 7 p.m. on Sunday in
Room 208 in the University

Center building to discuss fur-

ther plans for this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball. All students are in-
vited to attend.

Fancy Dress will be held this
‘ year on February 29.

 

 

Homecoming Weekend

 

Allstars To Play

Final arrangements are be-
ing made to bring the Allstars,
from Charlottesville, back to
the Cockpit on Thursday, Oc-
tober 4th, for a show that should
really help kick off the
Homecoming weekend. The
Allstars, one of the most
popular bands in this region,
have no trouble delighting pack-
ed houses every time they play
here.

The University Center Com-
mittee received $500 from the

Executive Committee last week
to book the band, and UCC
chairman Jamie Small said
that the contract has _ been
delivered, and only the last
details remain to be worked out.
Small forsees no problems.

At this time, only one show
has been planned, with a limit
of 200 people allowed. Tickets
will be sold at the door for $1.00
to W&L students and $2.00 to
others. Watch for the time of the
show to be announced.

Letter From S.A.B.

(continued from page 10)

And there is the most difficult
aspect of putting off a Fancy
Dress, that of putting the theme
to work, so to speak, by making
all of the ideas pertaining to a
theme blend together. This is
what makes Fancy Dress what
it is, and not a high school prom.
This is what will be missed.

The second part of my argu-
ment concerns alumni.
Although Fancy Dress is un-
doubtedly the big weekend At
W&L, it certainly is not the only
weekend alumni attend. There
is, of course, Homecoming,
which is especially designed for
alumni, and the annual Spring
Reunion, which promises to get
bigger in years ahead.

As I’m sure many alumni will
agree, the priority lies with the
students of W&L. I’m also sure
that alumni would sacrifice
their privilege to attend Fancy
Dress if it meant preserving the
most prestigious collegiate
social event in the South. Not
even alumni want to go to a
Fancy Dress that smells of
socks and jocks. As an alumnus
to be, I would subscribe to these
views.

The initial motion to have
Fancy Dress in the gym passed
8-3. But after further discus-

Wenke
Arrives
In Korea

Michael F. Wenke, a 1979
graduate of Washington and
Lee, arrives in Korea this week
to begin a ten-month internship
as a Luce Scholar assigned to
the Korean Amateur Basketball
Association in Seoul.

Wenke is one of fifteen Luce
Scholars for 1979-80 who com-
prise the sixth group chosen in a
national competition for par-
ticipation in this program
operated by the Henry Luce
Foundation.

‘he Luce Scholars Program
was established by the founda-
tion in 1973 to give outstanding
young Americans an exposure
to Asia at an early stage in their
careers.

The 15 winners of Luce
Scholar awards in 1979 average
25 years-of-age and include 10
men and five women. The pro-
fessional fields they represent
range from medicine to music
and include philosophy, law,
finance, film-making, jour-
nalism, psychology, and social
work.

The competition for 1980-81
Luce Scholars is already under-
way. Nominating institutions
have been asked to present
their candidates to the Henry
Luce Foundation no later than
December 3.

Interested seniors, graduate
or professional school students,
or recent alumni under age 30
are asked to contact the local
Luce Scholar liaison, Dr. Edwin

Fancy Dress Problems

(continued from page 1)

Last year, the S.A.B. used too
many flammable materials,
added Student Body President
Steve Abraham. “If they had it
in the gym, everybody could
come,’’ he said.

“T think everyone should hold
their opinions until next week,”’
said Dee Keesler, Senior
Representative to the E.C.

SAB co-chairman David Har-
pole left with the E.C.’s wishes
that the communication situa-
tion improve significantly.

Gerald Darrell, director of
the University Dining and Food
Services, addressed the E.C. on
relations between the Universi-
ty Center Committee and the
Cockpit, and also on current
financial structure. Saying an
understanding had been reach-
ed between himself and U.C.C.
chairman Jamie Small, Darrell
went on to say that beer sales
during concerts are the only

way to offset losses on low sales

shutting down at times,”’ sai:
Darrell, refering to the Cockp
hours between 2 and 9 p.m.

“We don’t have a stead
business that we can rely on,
said Darrell. ‘‘The advantage ¢
that restaurant is that we don
have to make a profit. All w
have is to is operate in th
black.”’

A Rugby Club request for .
$600 loan was approved. Th
Club promised to return th
money in two weeks.

The loan, given because of <
C.0.D. uniform delivery ex
pected later this week, was em
phasized as just a loan. The
Rugby Club stated that in
dividuals will pay for their owr
uniforms.

Instead of a Freshman’s Guide—

Senator Howard Baker

 

The Ring-tum Phi, Sept. 27, 1979, Page 3

 

Howard Baker Profiled

Tennessee Senator Howard
Baker all but formally announc-
ed his bid for the 1980
Republican _ presidential
nomination in a TV appearance
May 6. Responding to inquiries
about his possible candidacy on
“Face the Nation,’’ Baker
replied, ‘‘ You know I am a can-
didate...I!’m running hard, I
have a good organization and I
plan to win.”’

This announcement by the 55-
year-old Senate Minority
Leader casts him into an
already cluttered field of GOP
presidential hopefuls, among

| them John Connally, George

Bush, Philip Crane, Bob Dole
and, although he has yet to
declare his candidacy, Ronald
Reagan.

In recent polls, though, Baker
has emerged reasonably well,
often placing behind Reagan,
Ford and Connally as the most
desirable Republican presiden-

tial candidate.

No stranger to Washington,
Baker first served as a Senator
in 1966, winning handily over
longtime Tennessee governor
Frank Clement.

In 1972, he won re-election
with an impressive 62% of the
vote, carrying all eight of the
Sstate:s congressional districts,
and his '78 election was equally
decisive. Baker's struggle to
grasp Senate Minority Leader
was just that. He managed to
pull one more vote than Robert
Griffin, his opponent in a heated
contest. Baker had tried for the
position two times before
without success.

The Senator first received na-
tional exposure as the ranking
Republican on the Senate
Watergate Committee, and his
name was brought frequently
as Ford’s most probable runn-
ing mate on the ’76 GOP ticket
(although, of course, Robert
Dole was eventually chosen).

A Reporter’s Probing Investigation

I was sure the moment I saw
her, although she seemed
uncertain at first and perhaps
was originally only charmed by
my matching watchband and
belt—anyway I was_ positive
that she was the one.

Perhaps you noticed her too”
It was last Friday night at that
Frat House with the white
pillars—I can never remember
its name—anyhow you know the
one I mean.

I first saw her standing there
at the entrance to the dining
room, where tapes were playing
and people were dancing. She
looked so unlike all the other
girls as she stood there in her
kelly green monogramed
sweater, navy blue (except for
those little green grogs, whales
or whatever) skirt and
topsiders—I knew she was dif-
ferent from the word go.

I slowly made my way toward
her speaking casual greetings
to friends (and anyone else I
passed) hoping that she would
notice my popularity and
charm. When our eyes first met
she sort of smiled (naturally
she was shy) so I decided the
first line would have to come
from me.

‘‘Hi—can I get you a beer?”

What?" she replied. It oc-
curred to me at first that she
might not have heard me over
the blarring music, but more
than likely she was probably
trying to play hard to get so I
decided that I would go along
with her game.

“WOULD YOU LIKE A
BEER,” I repeated. This time
she had to admit she heard me
and she nodded in approval. As
we walked to the patio we in-
troduced ourselves and ex-
changed vital statistics such as
hometown, year in school and
major.

There was a slight line as we
reached the keg so I explained
to her that this frat had the best
beer on campus. She looked a
little puzzled so I went on to
clarify my statement by admit-
ting that although it was the
same brand served by other
Frats, it was their specially
designed aluminum kegs that
made all the _ difference.
Needless to say, this really im-
pressed her.

As we drank our beers we
chatted about many things such
as her recent trip to Europe and
her Daddy’s business, and when
we were finished we decided to
dance.

During the next hour or two
we spent equal time between
the dance floor and the beer keg
and finally ended up on the
couch engaged in stimulating
conversation. Before we cculd
go further I felt that she should
know my true motive for trying
to get to know her. I confessed

that I was the Ring-tum Phi’s
star investigative reporter and
that I must have her
(figuratively speaking) for an
in depth interview,

She was of course, over-

whelmed that she should be the
one chosen for my probing arti-
cle, and then meekly blushed
and said she only hoped she
would be able to satisfy my
needs. I quickly assured her
that the pleasure was indeed
mine.

She smiled and I slipped my
arm around her waist (merely
to reassure her), and then led
her off to my posh Woods Creek
apartment where I traditionally
conduct such nocturnal in-
vestigations. | dare say you
would scarcely believe all I un-
covered in this extensive and
prevailing interview (which on-
ly proves that Mom was right
about beauty being more than
skin deep), and although we

were both exhausted by Sunday
afternoon when we bid adieu,
we were nevertheless complete-
ly satisfied with our endeavor.

But now dear readers comes
the sad part of my story upon
your sympathy and understan-
ding toward the cruel trick
which fate has played on me. On
returning from the Cockpit Sun-
day night, I found that the tape
on which I had recorded my en-
tire interview had been (ex-
pletives deleted) erased. Alas
my friends I have no record of
my deepest and most satisfying
probe, but all is not lost—I still
have some great photos—
perhaps they can be arranged
into a pictorial for next week’s

As Congress considers SALT
II, Baker's positions on the
Foreign Relations Committee
and the Arms Control Subcom-
mittee will offer him added na-
tional recognition.

Ideologically, Baker is hard
to define. He has opposed many
of the traditionally held conser
vative views during his career
his most recent defection being
support of the Panama Canal
Treaties—a position which
many Republicans claim will
seriously damage his nomina
tion chances. During the great

Baker was one of the few
southern politicians who chose
not to exploit the situation,
although he could have preach-

It is expected that much of
Baker’s support will come trom
moderate Republicans, par
ticularly Ford’s old supporters
He has few enemies in the party
and in the case of a deadlocked
convention, he might be ad-
vanced as a compromise can

Higgins Chairs DuPont Showing ,¢ p,;,

Doug Higgins has an exhibit
of paintings and drawings in the
DuPont Gallery through Oct. 5.

The exhibit is made of three
groupings of material. The
most prominent is a series of oil
paintings of chairs. There is a
selection of pencil drawings.
Plus there is a series of mixed
media ensembles.

The large, colorfilled oils of
chairs have twisted and exag-
gerated parts of the object. The
parts of the chair patch in even-
ly applied color. Higgins tries to
“flatten out the painting.’’ He
said that he aims only to paint.
He tries not to create an “‘illu-
sion on paper representing a
three dimensional object.’’ The
oils are of two sets, one using oil
and gaouch and the other only
oil.

The oil and gaouch are snap-
pier and are more preplanned.
They remind me of the packag-
ing for a Matchbox car, or
Saturday cartoons on color TV.
The words help present the pic-
ture as a literal work. Higgins
describes it as a dialogue bet-
ween himself and the paper.

‘‘CAFE-CHAIR-
NANTUCKET” has purple and
green strips making up the
backing and seat of the chair.
The white armrests spread
across the paper. There are
touches of pink amost on a
horizon that are distinctive.
There are no shadows. Shadows
are real, he’s painting a picture.

The second set of chair oils
are bigger, cruder. The frames
are wooden strips even with the
surface of the painting. Their
are swiped on bands of color for
a frame. These paintings have
the quick, forceful look of con-
struction work. ‘NANTUCKET
STREET CHAIR” has the
startling colors webbed across
black for tar.

The sketches are squiggles
from the color pencils and thin
black outlines. The sketches are
exercises with color and form.
They are a held lysergerized vi-
sion, almost a flash-back. He
gives typical touristy pictures
of seascapes, landscapes, and
museum foyers. He overex-
poses color groupings to form a
scene. With his drawings Hig-
gins says he “represent a quick
record of my concept.”

These paintings are a sample of Doug Higgins’ works, ranging from oils and pencils to mixed media

ensembles.

Signal flags are waving all over the place.
Washington and Lee alumnus, Tom Wolfe,
‘51, has just published what looks to be a top-
notch, solid best seller. In The Right Stuff
Wolfe has turned his keen eye and kinetic pro-
se to a history of the first seven American
astronauts, a’ la the New (now read middle-
aged?) Journalism.

Tom Wolfe’s prose fires off like a capsule on
top of a 13-story pencil loaded with compress-
ed explosive. His story of the selection, train-
ing and exploitation of the early space ex-
plorers is worthy of his razzle-dazzle style.

According to remembrances of Tom
Wolfe’s days at Washington and Lee there
were no hints of the flamboyance to come.
Charles McDowell, in an article in the Alumni
Magazine, Spring 1965, says Wolfe was “a
good student, good influence and a promising
writer,” with an ‘tambition to be the world’s
greatest pitcher’. He did succeed in manag-
ing the baseball team. He also was sports
editor of the Ring-tum Phi, and contributed to
Shenandoah, W&L’'s literary magazine. After

 

ye and Ear: from the Bookstore

graudation in 1951 he went to Yale getting a
PhD. in Sociology, which he has called ‘‘the
social side of political activity among
writers.”

His subsequent career as an enfant terrible
in New York journalism is being retold these
days in Time; Saturday Review; and lead ar-
ticles in the New York Times Book Review
and Chronicle of Higher Education. No word,
however, is in the New Yorker, a magazine
that Wolfe has written about with less than
reverence.

His two most recent appearances at W&L
were both colorful. In the dead of winter, 1967,
he spoke in Lee Chapel dressed in his
customary white suit with a chartreuse chif-
fon handerchief cascading from his pocket.
Then in May, 1974 while wearing a black gown
over his white suit, a blue and white hood was
placed on his shoulders: an Honorary Doctor
of Letters from his Alma Mater.

Today, the frustrated pitcher has become a
wide receiver of praise and attention for his
latest blast-off. Terrific, as he would say.

sional pictures is conceptualiz-
ed with his mixed media. They
are collages of magazine cutups
of bits of chairs, patches of pen-

represent a real chair as much
as an accountant’s graph
represents what happens in the
selling place.

A friend said ‘‘some of it is
really good, some of it is really
absurd. Like the prices.”

work I’d have to show you the

the W&L team on the proposi-
tion that “America is governed
not by policies but by public

The visitors will argue
against the assertion. The
Washington and Lee men—
junior Steve Bigler and senior
Sam Perkins—will take the af-
firmative side. All community
members are invited to witness
the showdown, which is
scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. in

Ireland. The two young men,
Donal O'Donnell and Conor
Gearty, have formidable
debating credentials—they
have never been defeated as a

three years ago, and their time
together has been marked by

In last year’s encounter, a
team from Cambridge Univer-
sity brought down the house as
it took the affirmative side on
the topic ‘‘Resolved: That This
House Would Re-Elect Jimmy
Carter.’’ Washington and Lee's
team, as might be expected, felt
quite at home with the negative
side, and aided by the fact that
the winners are always decided
by audience vote, triumphed in
the end. Time will tell whether
the luck of the Irish will be bet-
ter than that of their English
predecessors.

mittee, under chairman Jamie
Small, has been formed this
year to provide a consistent
schedule of good bands in the
Cockpit for W&L_ students.
Already, the UCC has made
plans to bring the Allstars here
on Oct. 4th.

In the past year or so, under
the guidance of Burr Datz,
more and more bands have
been brought to the Cockpit to
provide a variety of live enter-
tainment to students.

According to Small, Datz and
others originally had to actively
seek out bands to play here, but
now the bands are beginning to
call the Cockpit. ‘‘The Cockpit
is beginning to get on the map
And hopefully we’ll be able to
draw even more bands from
Atlanta, D.C., New York, and
other big cities,’ said Small.

Small also reported that he
had spoken with Mr. Gerry Dar-
rell, Director of University Din-
ing and Food Service, and found
Mr. Darrell receptive to having
more bands in the Cockpit. The
Cockpit staff also wants to see
more bands play here.

On a few occassions last year,
a band was booked on the spur
of the moment, and the staff
was caught short of help, but
the UCC plans to work with the
staff this year and notify them
of all shows well in advance.

Small commented, ‘I want to
see the independents get a bet-
ter deal for social life, and the
freshmen, being so close to the
Cockpit, also stand to benefit.
The entertainment brought
here will provide everyone with
a good alternative to the usual
fraternity parties. By providing
a steady place for entertain-
ment, we can afford to go down
the road less by bringing the
road here.”’

Small added that because
students are not compelled to

come to Cockpit attractions, as
they are to their own prepaid
fraternity parties, the faculty
would probably have no objec-
tions to weeknight bands.

A large variety of bands was
provided last year, and Small
said this year would be even
better. ‘We will get everything
from punk rock to jazz,
southern, and blue grass. If
anyone wants to see a certain
type of music, we'll try to get it
in here.”’

Small added, ‘‘I hope students
are as psyched as I am about
getting good live entertainment
this year. It’s your Cockpit and
we want to help you get the
most out of it.”’

Meatballs: Bill Murray

Meatballs has no plot, three
b-plots, and Bill Murray. The
ovie is obviously designed to

a vehicle for Murray and
rhaps as a consequence
ows like an endless series of
ort Saturday Night Live skits.
1e could enter the movie in the
iddle and still understand all
ree sub-plots with no difficul-

Murray plays the head of the
nior counselors, there is a
valry going on between Camp
me Star (Murray’s) and
imp Mohawk (an exclusive
ch kid’s camp), there is a boy
amed Rudy (Chris
akepeace) who needs to find
‘ceptance among his peers,
id Murray is after one of the
rl’s counselors named Rox-
1e. Murray’s camp wins the
ter-camp olympics, Rudy
nds friendship with Bill and
sceptance with his peers, and
(urray and Roxane decide to

The bits and scenes are about
1 par with Saturday Night. The

humor is cleaner though, it’s
less profound, the sex is rude
rather than sick, and on the
whole the tone of Meatballs is
more enthusiastic and less
cynical.

Ivan Reitman’s direction is
mediocre. Rife with uninspired
camera angles and editing, the
movie works chiefly because of
the strength of the humor and
skill of Murray. Reitman did a
far better job as Co-producer of
Animal House.

Meatballs is pale compared to
Animal House. Without a
stronger plot the humor of
Meatballs, while funny, can
never achieve the moments of
Animal House. While I saw
Animal House three times, I
doubt I will see Meatballs
again.

No, I have no idea what
“‘Meatballs”’ refers to.

Having now seen the
previews to both North Dallas
Forty and Meatballs I am
amazed at how poor they (the
previews) are. Neither preview
tells one much about the move,
and both take disparate scenes
and re-edit them to create new
punch lines.

The preview to North Dalls
Forty has a tone completely op-
posite that of the movie and is
downright misleading. The
Meatballs preview gave away a
good number of punch lines, so
that during the movie I found
myself saying, ‘Oh, this must

be where he says....” thus
wrecking the joke.
Both of these previews

manage to mislead the viewer,

and don’t flatter the picture. So
who came up with these things?

Now, get out of here you
maniacs.

From the Pressbox:

Only JV. ?

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Junior varsity sports are alive and well at W&L.

Despite a lack of emphasis, W&L’s six JV teams
continue to serve as both a ‘‘feeder”’ program for the
varsity squads and an avenue for student participa-
tion in intercollegiate athletics. The six JV
programs—soccer, basketball, tennis, lacrosse,
water polo and this year, football—are all considered
integral parts of their respective varsity programs.
Almost all of the varsity coaches whose programs in-
clude a JV team said the JV has been a big plus for
their program.

Several of the coaches feel that the JV teams allow
them to develop future players for the varsity squads.
They said they could accomplish this by letting

 

freshmen get actual game experience on the JV level ,

before letting them play for the varsity. However,
each coach has his own philosophy about the role the
JV program should play.

JV basketball coach Jim Casciano, who also assists
varsity coach Verne Canfield, described the JV pro-
gram as ‘“‘a feeder program to the varsity.” ““We hope
to get a couple of players out of each freshman class,”’
explained Casciano, ‘“‘It also provides the opportunity
for freshman members of the varsity squad to get
some playing time on the JV level.” This philosophy
has proved successful for Canfield'as three members
of the varsity team—Tom Jeffries, Pete Farrell and
R.J. Scaggs— are graduates of the JV program.

Varsity soccer coach Rolf Piranian also considers
the JV to be a feeder program to the varsity. Piranian
considers the JV to be a vital part of the varsity pro-
gram and said he has done ‘“‘a lot of work” to upgrade
it. The coach said he likes to consider the JV as a “B-
team” and treats the players on both squads in the
same manner. Contrary to the philosophy of the other
coaches, Piranian likes to bring several JV players up
to the varsity team at the end of the JV season. One of
this year’s captains of the varsity, Doug Seitz, is just
one of several players on the varsity roster who spent
time on the JV level.

Probably the strongest of the JV programs is the JV
lacrosse team. Every year the varsity squad includes
at least one former JV player. Former JVers on last
year’s team were captain Sandy McDonald, Art
Caltrider, Mark Ottinger and Bart Peaslee. A few
years back, Doug Fuge worked his way up from the
JV level and was rewarded his senior year when he
was selected as an honorable mention All-American.

Varsity coach Jack Emmer tries to limit the JV
program to freshman and sophomore players who
have aspirations of making the varsity. ‘I think the
JV has allowed us to keep people involved in the
lacrosse program and at the same time allowed
younger players to develop their skills before moving
up to the varsity level,” said Emmer. He added that
“the JV program has also helped stimulate interest in
lacrosse on campus.”

Despite the popularity of the JV lacrosse program,
Emmer finds himself without a JV coach. Former JV
coach Rolf Piranian will become a full-time trainer at
the end of the fall season and will not coach the JV this
year. Emmer said he is still uncertain about the situa-

tion.

Just Call Him ‘Hoops’

by Dave Murray

"I; came here for the
challenge of playing the best
lacrosse in the country,” says
W&L midfielder John Hooper.
He thinks about it-and then
adds, ‘‘but don’t make it look
like the only reason I came here
was to play lacrosse.” He
laughs.

Hooper arrived at the Co-op
wearing a white cowboy hat. He
has just come from his home in
the country, a silver trailer
named the ‘Submarine.’ He
has also brought along his two
dogs. When asked about
himself, he would rather talk
about the team.

“The big names are all
gone,’”’ he said, “I don’t mean
that we don’t still have some ex-
cellent players, but the Fritzes
and the Blacks—they’re gone.
What’s left is a nucleus of team
players, very close
players...instead of relying on a
couple of guys, everybody’s
gonna have to contribute.”’

Last spring, Hooper was
elected by his teammates to
serve as a co-captain along with
second-team All—American
goalie Bob Clements. Coach
Jack Emmer said of ‘Hooper,
“He sets a fine example and I

think his teammates appreciate '

that.”

Hooper spent his freshman
year at the Univresity of Ver-
mont. He had been a three-sport
star in high school in
Maplewood, N.J. He played
guard and linebacker on the
football team, midfield on the
lacrosse team and also played
hockey. He decided after his
freshman year to transfer to
W&L and concentrate on
lacrosse.

It was never easy. His
sophomore year, before the
season started, Hooper suffered
from bursitis in his hips. Em-
mer stuck with him even though
he could not run for a while.
Finally, the doctors were able
to help and Hooper says now
that he has only occasional
pain.

But Emmer’s faith paid off.
“He never lost his enthusiasm
when he got hurt,’’ said the
coach. Hooper soon developed
into a fine midfielder and a key
player for the Generals.

Junior midfielder George
Santos remembered his first
impression of Hooper: ‘When I
first came here I thought he was
nuts.’’ He continued, ‘‘Here’s
this guy who has just transfer-
red, running around with a
marine haircut and growling on
face-offs. But after you get to
know him...he’s different.”

Hooper shared the face-off
duties with Clements and others
during his first season. He also
saw action as a defensive mid-
die Hooper made a lasting im-
pression on the W&L fans with
his hard hitting.

Hooper has never been a
flashy offensive player,
although he moves well without
the ball. He is a cutter. Emmer
notes, “John’s a hard worker
who gets the most out of his
ability.”

The NCAA changed the face-
off rule before the start of last
season to speed up the game. In-

 

Co-Captain John Hooper —

stead of a face-off after each
goal, the ball was brought into
play at midfield by the team
that was scored on. This promp-
ted the use of defensive
midfielders—specialists—and
Hooper was one of them. He
also contributed at the other

_end of the field with eight goals.

This year, the face-off rule
has been changed back to the
way it was. Hooper will share
the duty with Joe Olive and
others. Again he hesitates to
talk about himself.

“On any given day, our face--
off guys can stay with
anybody...everybody’s got their
own tricks. Between all of us,
we'll get our share. The face-off
is supposed to be individual, but
here it doesn’t have to be,”’ said
Hooper.

So how does a defensive mid-
die get to be a captain?
Manager Palmore Clark ex-
plains, ‘‘People really respect

Hoops. He’s just so intense. He
knows when to let loose at prac-
tice and at games ...that’s what
he’s there for.”

Emmer says of his captain,
“John’s his own man. He won’t
be afraid to speak up and tell
someone he’s out of line. He’s
more outspoken than captains
of the past.” |

One teammate called Hooper
the most physical player on the
team. Last season on the spring
trip, he broke W&L attackman
Pere Robert’s collarbone dur-
ing a collision at practice. ‘“‘He
popped me like he _ usually
does,”’ said Roberts.

Hooper’s ‘‘play hard-practice
hard” philosophy is simple.
“Well, you know,” he said,
“there’s an old saying—
Saturday is wash
day...whatever you’ve done
during the week comes out on
Saturday.” And Hoops seems to
Sparkle on Saturdays.

We Won!

Leiser Return Gives W&L 14-10 Win

by Dale Park

Last Saturday when Centre
College won the toss and elected ,
to receive the ball, head coach
Gary Fallon also allowed the
Colonels to pick which goal they
wanted to defend. ‘‘The kids —
were flat before the game”,
said Fallon, “‘and I thought that
letting the Colonels have their
own choice might get our
players excited.”

This philosophy obviously
paid off. Led by a superb defen-
sive effort, the Generals upend-
ed Centre College 14-10.

On the Cononel’s very first
play from scrimmage, Centre’s '
running back, Jim-Bob Green,
fumbled and an alert defensive
back Gene Newton recovered
for the Generals on the Col-
onel’s 38 yard line.

W&L quickly capitalized.
Sophomore Jim Wenke, making
his deubt as W&L’s starting
quarterback, lead the Generals
to the one yard line in seven
plays, setting up tail-back
Stewart Atkinson’s touchdown
plunge. The conversion was
good, making the score 7-0
W&L.

This proved to be the only
scoring drive the Generals had

all afternoon. But if the offense
had its problems, the defense
surely did not.

The Colonel’s only touchdown
drive came as a result of an in-
tercepted Wenke pass which
was taken to the General’s 13
yard line. Behind the running of
Mike Shannon, the Colonels
scored what proved to be their
only touchdown of the day.
After a successful two-point
conversion, Centre had the lead
8-7; but only for the moment.

On the subsequent kickoff,
Leiser took the ball at his own
seven yard line. Slicing up the
middle behind a well-formed
wedge, the junior slot-back rac-
ed 93 yards for a touchdown.

“Leiser’s run was a big lift”
said Fallon, ‘Because he im-
mediately countered Centre’s
previous scoring drive.”

For the day, Leiser gained 110
yards on two kickoff returns. He
gained an additional 15 yards on
two carries from scrimmage
and 10 yards on two pass recep-
tions.

With the conversion suc-
cessful, the Generals took the
lead 14-8 never to trail again.

The only other scoring that
took place in the first half oc-

cured as a result of a W&L
mistake. Late in the second
quarter, while attempting to
punt from their own endzone, an
errant W&L snap flew over Syd
Farrar’s head, crossing the
endzone backline. The safety
left the score at 14-10 as the half
came toan end.

Both teams lost the ball
through fumbles three times,
yet the Generals actually threw
more interceptions (two) than
Centre (one).

Despite an offense which
stagnated due to missed op-
portunities, the defense pulled
through. Defensive standouts
were sophomore noseguard
Mike Pressler, who recovered a
fumble, and Newton, who in-
tercepted a pass to go along
with his earlier fumble
recovery.

Next week the Generals
travel to Ashland to face
Randolph-Macon College.
Macon, 1978 ODAC Champions,
are favored to repeat as
champs again this year. Both
offensive and defensive units
have seven starters returning.

Game time is 2:00 p.m. at
Day Field.

W&L To Host North-South

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will be the site of the 39th
annual North-South Lacrosse
All-Star game, the United
States Intercollegiate Lacrosse
Association has announced. The
event, which features the na-
tion’s top seniors, is scheduled
for 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, June
14, 1980 and will take place at
W&L’s 7,000 seat Wilson Field.

‘Washington & Lee Universi-
ty is delighted to have been
chosen host for the North-South
game,”” commented Generals’
lacrosse coach Jack Emmer.
“This game has traditionally
been the showcase for the best

players in_ intercollegiate
lacrosse, and the W&L com-
munity is exicted about bring-
ing the game and its associated
festivities back to Lexington.”

The announcement of the
selection came from USILA
president Dick Clower, Athletic
Director at Western Maryland
College, and North-South Com-
mittee Chairman Richie Moran,
lacrosse coach at. Cornell
University. 1980 will mark the
second time Washington & Lee
has hosted the event, the first
being in 1970.

Festivities for the event begin
on Friday, June 13, with the All-

American Banquet. Saturday’s
game will involve approximate-
ly 54 players, who will be
selected prior to the NCAA
Championship in May. Coaches
will also be announced at that
time.

The South leads the 38-game
series 19-17-1 (the 1964 game
was called the ‘All-American
Classic’ and teams were
chosen using a different for-
mat). The North has won the
past five contests, including last
year’s 21-15 win at the Universi-
ty of Maryland at Baltimore
County.

Hero For a Day

by Bill Whalen
Asst. Sports Editor

The final score: Washington & Lee 14, Centre 10.
Yes, make no mistake about it, the Generals actually
won their first game of the season and in a most
unlikely way—beating a team no one had given them
a chance against.

Last Saturday, W&L was outrushed, outpassed,
fumbled the same amount as their opponents and
even received more penalties. But what the hell, a win
is a win.

When a football team wins, the entire squad gets
congratulated. But let’s be honest, only twelve men
deserve an ovation—the 11 players on defense and
Chris Leiser.

The Generals’ defense should have been paid time-
and-a-half for last Saturday’s performance. The
defense caused four turnovers, including one fumble
which resulted in one of W&L’s two scores.

More importantly, the defense caused that turnover
on Centre’s first offensive play of the game, giving the
Generals enough momentum to score twice. Still, the
defensive heroics might have gone unnoticed had it
not been for another player—Chris Leiser.

His height is listed at 5-8, he weighs 170 pounds and
stands taller than only three other men on the squad.
Chris Leiser would not be your first choice in a pick-
up basketball game.

If you’re starting a football team, however, it’s
hard to overlook this guy. How many other players
can be used at quarterback, running back, wide
receiver and even return kicks?

At the first three positions, Leiser can do an ade-
quate job. Last Saturday, Leiser earned his keep by
returning kicks—an art he perfected against Centre.

Having taken a quick 7--0 lead only to fall behind
8-7, the Generals had to be emotionally in the dumps.
To pick up a team in this type of situation, you need a
big play—which is where Leiser fits in.

All Leiser did was take a kickoff from his seven
yard line and race 93 yards untouched for the
Generals’ final touchdown. Had Leiser not scored or
had the defense not played as well as they did, the
Generals would have probably lost because their of-
fense was practically negligible after the first
quarter.

Of course, anyone can run from one end of the foot-
ball field to the other, but try it returning a punt or a
kickoff with 11 angry players running towards you at
full speed. It can be a fatal experience.

What made Leiser’s run so special was the com-
bination of three factors: good running, good blocking
and a little luck. Leiser’s teammates formed a solid
wedge up the middle of the field, allowing the
speedster to go relatively untouched for most of the
jaunt.

By the time he reached the 30 yard line, Leiser
made a quick cut that left him only one more oppo-
nent away from the goal line. That man was Centre’s
kicker, who fortunately did not seem too thrilled with
the idea of trying to tackle Mr. Leiser.

In contrast to almost every other position on the
field (excepting the two kicker Spots), kick returning
is a lonely job. With the ever-present danger of fumbl-
ing, it’s not too big 4 leap from hero to goat in one
afternoon.

He might fumble everytime he gets the ball this
Saturday, but for the moment, Chris Leiser is a hero.

From the Pressbox

(continued from page 6)

Because of his late arrival at W&L, water polo
coach Page Remillard was unable to recruit and is
presently without a formal JV program. ‘“‘I did my
first recruiting during the freshman swimming test.
From that alone I recruited seven freshmen who I’m
very pleased with,’’ said Remillard. He explained
that because of a lack of numbers, there will be no for-
mal JV squad this year but there will be one next
year. Remillard is presently using his water polo
physical education class as an informal JV program.
The coach added, ‘‘The JV program will be developed
as numbers dictate.”

Although varsity tennis coach Gary Franke
believes the JV program should act as a feeder in an
idealistic sense, he said that realistically it often
doesn’t happen that way. “The JV team is
idealistically for freshmen and sophomores who have
aspirations of making the varsity,” said Franke add-
ing, ‘‘it allows them to develop their tennis skills and
gain experience to help them.”’ Realistically, Franke
said, many of the JVers may not make the team, but
will still have the opportunity to participate in inter-
collegiate athletics.

The newest addition to the JV family is the JV foot-
ball team. The concept of a JV football program has
been reborn under the leadership of varsity coach
Gary Fallon. Fallon feels there is a definite need for a
JV program at W&L. ‘‘We have 72 players on the var-
sity team, including 38 freshmen. It isn’t possible to
get everyone into the game,” explained Fallon.

Fallon said the JV program will allow those on the
varsity squad who are not playing to work on their in-
dividual skills and keep interested in the program. In
addition to the second and third stringers on the varsi-
ty, the JV team includes 15 W&L students who were
not playing football before. In all, about 50 players
will comprise the JV football team. Pallon said that
he hopes to make the varsity a junior and senior
oriented team and let the freshmen work their way up
through the system. The JV schedule already in-
cludes three games in October and Fallon hopes to
add two or three more games. The games will be
played on Monday afternoons so the varsity coaches
can observe the younger players and so those varsity
players also playing for the JV will have four days to
prepare for the following week’s varsity game.

Not only are the JV teams beneficial to their varsity
programs, buy they are also beneficial to the W&L
student body. They allow for increased participation
in intercollegiate sports. More students can get in-
volved in these sports and gain experience in playing
a sport they’re not familiar with such as soccer,
lacrosse or water polo.

JV sports also fit in very well with W&L’s
philosophy on athletics. Athletics are here for the
students. Not everyone is good enough to play on a
varsity team. And not everyone wants to participate
in sports on the competitive level of a varsity pro-
gram. |

Although each coach has his own philosophy of what
a JV program should be and include, the programs
are here for the students. Intercollegiate athletics can
be a very enjoyable and fulfilling experience. So if
you can squeeze it in between homework and frat par-
ties, a JV sport could be for you. Remember, many a
star athlete started out on a JV team.

First year W&L swimming
and water polo coach Page
Remillard has recently been ap-
pointed to the NCAA Swimming
Committee. This committee is
responsible for overseeing rule
changes, validating records,
and developing policy for na-
tional championship meets.
Remillard becomes one of three
Division III representatives on
the twelve man committee. .

The NCAA sponsors an an-
nual meeting of this committee
each spring. During the two-
and-a-half day meeting, the
committee discusses the rules
of swimming and of the cham-
pionships. The three Division
III members also attend the
division championships each
year.

‘I was very pleased and sur-
prised at being appointed,”
commented Remillard, ‘‘and I

. am looking forward to working.

with the national body of swim-
ming.” Remillard is impressed
with the high caliber of coaches
and swimming experts with
whom he will be working on the
committee.

Remillard’s qualifications for
the appointment are extensive.
His administrative experience
includes service on the NCAA
Games Committee for the Na-
tional Water Polo Champion-
ships in 1977 and service on the
NCAA Division III National

Championship Meet Committee
for swimming in 1978.
Remillard’s coaching record
was no doubt partially responsi-
ble for his appointment. In
three years cf coaching at
Claremont Men’s-Harvey Mudd
Colleges, he coached 21 All-
American swimmers, and twice
finished in the national ‘‘top 10”’
in Division III. In his last year
at the California school, his
swimming team was fifth in the

Fishing
For Bass

by Jim Feinman
Barring another tropical
depression, some of the best

smallmouth bass fishing of the

year will be available to anglers
in the area.

The James River around
Natural Bridge yielded some
excellent catches at the end of
the past week. The water level
was low and clear and the
cooler weather made the bass
eager to strike. Some of the hot
baits were Mepps spinners and
balsawood minnow imitations.

By the middle of this week,
the streams should have reced-
ed to a fishable level following
the weekend’s deluge. The
Maury River will be a good spot
from Goshen all the way to
Buena Vista. The Maury is easi-
ly wadeable in low water as
compared to the James, which
is best fished from a canoe. The
James is a large river with deep
holes and strong currents. Only
experienced boaters should
voyage out on it.

Some of the smaller streams
in the area, such as Buffalo
Creek, will also provide good
fishing for bass. in the next cou-
ple of weeks. These streams are
perfect for the solo angler who
desires an hour or two of fishing
in the afternoon.

Light spinning tackle with 4-6
test line is adequate for the
Maury and the smaller
streams. Anglers on the James
might need 6-12 test line as
several large muskies are taken
from the river each year in the
fall.

Spinners and medium depth
lures will provide good action in
most areas. Live bait, especial-
ly sculpins and _ hellgramites,
can be deadly at times on the
smallmouth.

kk

George Irvine reports little
success on the doves during the
past week. ‘‘I was out there all
day Saturday and didn’t see a
bird. I even shucked corn for
‘em but they wouldn’t come in,”
said Irvine.

Edward Morrison, an avid
amateur ornithologist, reports
that the fall migration of many
species of birds will begin soon.
Morrison is on the lookout for
ospreys, great blue herons,
green herons, and many species
of hawks. Morrison made at
least one siting of all these
migratory birds last fall in the
vicinity of his Buffalo Creek
home.

ming Committee

nation and his water polo teams
won their conference champion-
ship.

An appointment to the NCAA
Swimming Committee is an
honor for any swimming coach,
but it is especially impressive in
Remillard’s case. To have
achieved this level of national
recognition in only his fourth
year of coaching at the college
level speaks highly of
Remillard’s coaching talents.
 

Netmen To Play
in Navy Tourney

by Frank Jackman

If past performances are any
indication of things to come,
Washington & Lee tennis fans
have a great deal to look for-
ward to this spring. The tennis
team has started fall practice
and the entire squad has return-
ed from last year’s highly suc-
cessful season.

Last spring, the Generals
totally dominated the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference
finishing fourth nationally in
the NCAA Division III national
tournament.

Leading the team this year
are co-captains Dave Constine
and All-American Stewart
Jackson. Also returning from
last year’s squad are Robert
Schuler, Wes Yonge, Pat Nor-
ris, Doug Gaker and Sumner
Bouldin.

Fall tennis is designed
primarily as a team tryout for
spring. Over the next few weeks
there will be challenge matches
to decide positions on the roster.
Among those challenging are
eight promising freshmen who
hope to give the upperclass
players a tough time.

In addition to the practice
calendar, the team plays a
rigorous fall tournament
schedule. During the fall, the
Generals travel to Annapolis to
compete in the Navy tourna-
ment against seven other
schools from this part of the

country.

Following that, the Generals
play in the Quadrangular
James Madison Tournament
against James Madison, Rich-
mond and George Mason
University. But without a doubt,
the highlight of the fall schedule
will be the annual Washington &
Lee Invitational Tournament
scheduled for October 14-15.

When the Generals open
camp in the spring, they will
face what is reputed to be one of
the most difficult Division Il
schedules.

With 24 matches during the
regular season, the stiffest com-
petition should come from the
University of North Carolina.
Also, during the spring break,
the Generals will head south to
Florida to face some of the stif-
fest competition in that area.

Even at this early stage,
Coach Franke has set forth
three objectives: first ‘to im-
prove on last year’s fourth
place finish at the NCAA na-
tional tournament; secondly, to
defeat the toughest competition
possible; and finally, to again
dominate the ODAC for the
fourth consecutive year.

Coach Franke appears confi-
dent about both the fall and spr-
ing seasons. With the quality of
players on the squad this year,

it could prove to be the
Generals’ most successful
season yet.

CC Team Wins

by Greg Branan

Despite running on an im-
provised five-mile course, the
Washington and Lee cross coun-
try team opened its 1979 season
with victories over Davis and
Elkins and Mary Washington in
last Saturday's tri-meet. Parts
of W&L’s regular course were
impassable due to the rain.

Coach Dick Miller was ‘‘very
pleased” with the team's show-
ing at this point in the season.
The final score was W&L-30,
D&E-33, and Mary
Washington-73.

Football,

Tennis
Begin
In IMs

by Chris Sisto

Intramural sports for the
1979-80 season began this past
week as both football and tennis
kicked off their schedules with a
full slate of games Monday.
Both sports will run until Oc-
tober 11 with the finals con-
cluding October 18.

The entire intramural pro-
gram at Washington and Lee is
under the direction of Verne
Canfield and senior Joe Olive.
Accorto Olive, “I do the
organizing and the busy work
while Coach Canfield makes
sure the job gets done. He is full
control and has the final say in
all matters.”’

Olive expressed that he had
only minimal problems in get-
ting the season underway. The
only two problems that exist are
in football.

First, there is not enough
space to play the games. Olive
explained, ‘‘We have two teams
more than we had last year and
the use of two less fields, which
is making the organizing a little
more hectic.’’ The second pro-
blem is a lack of referees. Olive
urges anyone who is interested
in being a referee and earning
some extra money to contact
him at the IM office, ext. 154.

Other than those two pro-
blems, Olive said the rest of the
program is running smoothly.
There are no rule changes in
either sport this season nor are
there any major organizational
differences. Both sports have
three divisions with 17 teams
competing in football and 19
playing tennis. Eight teams will
make the playoffs in each sport.

In football, last year's cham-
pion SAE has already lost its
opener to Beta, 8-6. In tennis,
the defending champion is Law
3.

“REVIEW and OUTLOOK Letters

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Pr:

Economics 101

Although we have not received any official com-

plaints from the faculty or administration, we have

heard distant rumblings from the direction of The Hill
about an advertisement we ran last week for
‘Research Papers.’’ Now, everyone knows that
‘Research Papers”’ can be purchased and submitted
by a deceitful student as his own work—that’s called
plagiarism, and plagiarism is a violation of the honor
code.

So why did we run an ad advertising plagiarism?
Well, for the money of course. Unfortunately, for all
the high-minded, idealistic purposes behind
publishing a newspaper, it takes money to ‘‘serve the
interests of a free and democratic society.”

We were hit by a hefty increase in our publishing
costs this year which will necessarily expand our
budget by $7,000 if we want to put out a newspaper of
any size and quality. Since the Executive Committee
has not yet held its budget hearings and since we are
not at all sure the student government will be willing
to help us make up this awesome amount, we have to
rely on advertising to make up our increased printing
costs. Our advertising lineage for the first two issues
is actually lower than last year, however.

Besides, we put a disclaimer above the ad advising
interested students that use of the advertised
material would be at their own risk. If Washington
and Lee’s Honor System is as strong as we are told it
is, all of the University’s students will ignore the ad
while we still collect our money. We are also remind-
ed of the story about the student who bought such a

paper and turned it in as his own: the professor com- .

mented, ‘‘This is an excellent paper; it was also an
excellent paper when I wrote it 20 years ago.”’ Of
course if some generous benefactor were to give us
the money to make up for our increased costs, then we
would be in a position to turn away such ‘‘dirty
revenue’’ in the future.

Creative Writing

Our campus is one of the most beautiful in the coun-
try and we believe this can be attributed to the pride
the students take in the school’s appearance. Many of
the larger State schools and less respected private in-
stitutions cannot make this claim as they enroll an
element of undesirables who express themselves in
socially unacceptable forms—we’re referring to
spray-painted graffiti.

In the past four years there has never been an inci-
dent we’ve seen of spray-painted graffiti written with
the intent of communicating disparaging sentiments
toward another fraternity. Such communiques can be
seen on the footbridge and on many of the steps of the
State school to the northeast. W&L gentlemen have
always been above such sophomoric pranks, at least
until Saturday night.

We doubt the student body will tolerate such
behavior. It is unfortunate that an element exists
among us who can only communicate with such a
base form of expression. We have only seen a small
incident, but we hope that unlike so many of the
behaviorisms admired by the lemmings among us
who can only function by conforming to the pack, this
one act of social irresponsibility will be the last of its
kind. We'd hate to see the Colonnade look like a sub-
way station.

Editor:

There is a movement afoot in
the SAB to move the Fancy
Dress Ball from the Student
Center to the gymnasium. As
advisor to’ the SAB Michael
Cappeto stated, the crowds at
Fancy Dress have become so
big that we are facing a poten-
tial fire hazard. The crowd last
year was nearly twice the legal
limit.

From a fatalist’s point of
view, whether 3,500 or 5,500 go
to the Ball, everyone will go up
in smoke should there be a fire.
Suppose all 3,500 manage to
squeeze in the Dining Hall to
watch an encore performance
by Beau Dudley. Hypothetical, |
realize, but so is a fire. Never-
theless, we face a tough deci-
sion,

What the issue boils down to is
the privilege of alumni to attend
Fancy Dress. Of the 5,000 who
came last year, alumni ac-
counted for 1,200 (including
dates). Thus, the alternatives
seem to be, as stated in the last
SAB meeting, either to
eliminate the carte blanche
privilege of allowing alumni to
come to Fancy Dress or to hold
Fancy Dress in a place that
would accomodate everyone,
like the gymnasium or even
Zollman’s for that matter.

First of all, the notion of put-
ting a first class gala event in
the gym would be an anomaly.
No matter how extensive the

To The Editor

Fancy Dress Complications

decorations are, the gym is still
going to look like a gym. The
idea of walking down a flight of
stairs to the training room, a la
Studio 54, strikes me as
distasteful.

There is no way the gym can
undergo the total and complete
transformation that we have
come to expect in recent years

in the Student Center. As a
veteran of Fancy Dress Work
Week and former chairman of
the Paper Cutting Committee, |
can tell you that the easiest
thing to do in the world is to cut
paper and tack it on a wall. But
there’s more to Fancy Dress
decorations than that. There is
the special attention to detail.

(continued on page 2)

Persiflage
Success With Women

Let's face it. To be ‘‘successful’’ with women, while at W&L, re-
quires more than a clean button-down shirt or massive quantities of
alcohol. The old ‘‘get ‘em wasted” scheme might get you a few
blurry experiences with some pock-marked blimps, but it is hardly
going to earn you that desired ‘‘stud” label. _

To really rack up the notches on your belt you have to be utterly
unscrupulous. Forget that you are dealing with people. Your air is
to maximize pleasure while minimizing the subtle effects of the
warped female mentality.

Too many guys make the mistake of chasing the whole field at
once. This strategy might pay off in the short run, but even future
homemakers of America can figure out that they are being two-
timed. A much better approach, one that has consistently scored
high marks on the long term pleasure scale, is lying.

Now lots of people lie to get what they want, but they go about it
haphazardly. I’m advocating a calculated scheme of organized
deception.

First, you supply your target with enough sentiment so that it
becomes easy for her to rationalize her future downfall. Then, you
set out endearing yourself with her friends. Impress them with
your loyalty and sincerity.

After a carefully orchestrated break-up, in which the “callous
vamp” throws you to the wayside, these friends supply vou witha
new base from which to work. They'll be glad to connive against
their ex-friend in their attempts to avoid becoming secretaries with
a good background in art history.

Now is that difficult?

Taking Issue With John Warner

Prominent alumni can play a
large part in enhancing the
reputation of a _ school.
However, after reaching
former Secretary of the Navy
John Warner’s little torpedo in
the premier issue of Shenan-
doah Valley Magazine entitled
‘“‘My College Days at
Washington and Lee,’’ one
almost wonders if the Senator,
presently a member of the
Board of Trustees, is a friend or
foe of his alma mater.

Half of Warner’s article is
dedicated to prasing ‘‘The spirit
of W&L.”’ Washington and Lee’s
code of gentlemen’ and
‘‘Washington and Lee, its cam-
pus and principles.” The rest of
the article is a_ self-serving
tribute to Warner's derelec-
titude as a W&L student, his
subsequent generosity, and his
grave misunderstanding of
what W&L is and what it can be.

Says Warner, ‘‘Washington
and Lee's code of gentlemen the
honor code, and the heritage otf
the school have guided me all
my adult life.”’ Let's deal with
these three issues one at a time.

Warner claims allegience to
the “Code of Gentlemen,” yet
he finds it curious that he has
been invited back to Hollins,
Sweet Briar, Mary Baldwin,
and Lynchburg College on
speaking engagements, He at-
tributes these invites to the fact
that these schools have either
“forgotton or forgiven. (his)
deportment as a W&L student.
Great recruiting tool, that state
ment. Anything that needs to be

forgotten or forgiven couldn't
have been too gentlemanly.

Warner claims to be big on
the Honor Code, yet he boasts of
making 50 cents a night ‘‘sleep-
ing in’ at VMI, filling the beds
of wayward Cadets. Though this
isn't exactly lying, cheating or
stealing, it ain’t real above
board either. But perhaps the
Honor Code stops at the proper-
ty line.

More disturbing, though, than
these triffles, more disturbing
than Warner's espousal, the
work hard-play hard myth, and
even more disturbing than a
prose style which suggests that
Warner never saw the inside of
Payne Hall, is his utter
misunderstnading of the great
potential of Washington and
Lee, a potential based upon its
rich heritage.

Warner's sole mention of
academics is a_ passing
reference to the well-worn work
hard-play hard fantasy. He
could have mentioned a few of
W&L’s truly great men, nor like
James Leyburn who emphasiz-
ed their commitment to the in-
tellect, to honor, and to the
gentlemanly ideal by quietly
living it.

Instead, using the voice that
he and only a few others can at
ford, Warner proposes a tradi
tion rich in heros like “jabbo

I'm sure the prospeets of tin-

know a man a home, a promi-
nent law professor, who, when
he discovered that I went to
W&L, couldn't wait to tell me
about one of his fondest
memories of the school.

Every homecoming and Fan-
cy Dress his fraternity would
buy an old piano, hoist it three
stories with a rope and pully on-
ly to drop it, to listen to the ping
of the breaking strings. Then, of
course, to make sure that all the
strings pinged, they would set
the piano ablaze.

And lest we forget, these
masters of the framing were
around during the hey day of
big time W&L football. Gator
Bowl and all that. And now
these fellows are all reformed
piano torchers looking tor tax
deductions to deserve to be (ex-
pect to be?) entertained on
alumni Saturday afternoons at
old Wilson Field, scene of their
former glory. If W&L’s_ big
budget football program isn't

aestretaully pleasing it is at
least cost effective in the long
run

With alumni like that as
salesmen tor the school can we
honestly wonder why a few
fraternities have a little trouble
with late night noise

What Is Wrong With The Ring-tum Phi?

I Man Committee Assails Phi

EC Pres Blasts Newspaper

Dear Students,

Every year I have anxiously awaited the
printing of the Ring-tum Phi in hopes that
the new year will provide accurate repor-
ting of the important events on campus. I
have been disillusioned each year, and
alas, this year is no exception.

After reading the Phi’s article on the
new honor trial, I was disappointed to find
it misleading and frankly incorrect in
parts. If the Ring-tum Phi is to be the
Washington and Lee community’s paper,
then_it should concentrate on accuracy
rather than controversy.

First, Randy Smith, this year’s editor,
misconstrued my statement concerning
the extension of a request for a public trial.
The statement in no way attempts to com-
ment on a student’s ability to receive a se-
cond honor hearing as Mr. Smith implied. I
merely attempted to clear up an earlier
problem the Phi had in understanding the
situation.

Previously, the Phi had claimed that the
granting of an extension of the 24 hour time
period was unprecedented. This is simply
not true. I quoted from the White Book in
an effort to inform the student body that
last year’s E.C. had not overstepped its
bounds in this matter. Last year’s E.C.
gave the accused an extension of the 24
hour time period, which is in perfect ac-
cordance with White Book procedure. My
statement in no way attempted to com-
ment on our granting the accused a private
trial, as Mr. Smith stated.

Secondly, Mr. Smith said, ‘‘the situation
for granting a second private honor trial
was still unclear.”” Mr. Smith seemingly
did not digest the entire statement issued
because the initial paragraph dealt with

t ) Ring 7um Phi

 

 

 

 

 

the granting of the second honor trial. As I

‘quoted from the White Book: ‘‘A hearing

may be reopened upon the production of
new evidence directly bearing on the ques-
tion of guilt or innocence or to prevent in-
justices.” (Article L, p. 8).

Thirdly, the Ring-tum Phi claimed that

“the non-suit papers had been drawn up
for several weeks.”’ Although this is cor-
rect, Mr. Smith’s use of the word
‘“however’’ cast doubt onto my statement
that the suit was still pending. As of the
printing of the article, the suit was still ac-
tive.
- Finally, Mr. Smith stated that I ‘“‘would
not answer any further questions about the
case.”’ This is a total misrepresentation of
the facts, as anyone who was there will at-
test. I answered each and every question
directed to me. When no further questions
were asked, the meeting was adjourned.
Obviously, what actually occured is quite
different from what was reported.

I write this not to instigate a Phi-E.C.
conflict, but to inform the Washington and
Lee community about the actions of its
elected officials so that they will see this
situation in the proper light.

Sincerely,
Stephen H. Abraham
Student Body President

Editor's Note: The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
implication in last week’s EC story that no
further questions were answered when, in
fact, no other questions were asked.

We otherwise stand behind the story as
written.

Student Upset With EC

Dear Editor:

An incident occurred at the Executive
Committee meeting Monday night that
distressed me considerably.

Steve Abraham disclosed that Nor-
thcross High School in Roanoke had re-
quested a member of the E.C. to speak to
its student body on the importance of the
Honor Code. At this Abraham began to
laugh, prompting laughter from one end of
the table to the other, and commented,
“Bag that.”

After the laughter had died down,
Abraham asked if any member of the com-
mittee did not have class before 10:30 a.m.
on Friday, as Northcross was going to hold
its assembly at 8:45 that morning. Mr.
Fraser, the third year law school represen-
tative replied that he did not. Abraham
asked if he would like to give the talk to
which Fraser replied, ‘‘No.’’ As an after
thought Fraser added, ‘‘I don’t think I’m

Dear Editor:

In my opinion, your second editorial of
the year had useful insight into the break-
in case. Likewise, many of the Phi’s new
articles have been clear and thorough.
However, so far, at least part of the Phi’s
content has been harmful, in bad taste, or
at least trivial A newspaperman’s
freedom to print what he likes, especially
in a student-owned paper, does not justify
uninhibited or unthoughtful _ self-
expression.

First, it is reprehensible for the Phi to
advertise for the sale of a ready-made
term papers (page 8, September 20). The
advertisement encourages violations of
the Honor Code, plain and simple. Respect
for the Honor Code is the thread of unity
which runs through, or should run through,
every aspect of Washington and Lee.

Second, there is no justification for
slandering local women’s colleges (‘‘A

 

Freshman’s Guide’). The Phi represents
all W&L students to the public, and should
consider the effect of articles on students’
reputations, especially when the articles
are unsigned.

Third, triviality makes poor reading.
Please reduce the number of pages in the
Phi, rather than ‘“‘filling’’ with trivia.
Photos with “‘isn’t-that-cute”’ captions and
the extraordinarily limp ‘‘Persiflage”’
would be grateful candidates for omission.

These opinions come from a committee
of one and are certainly subjective.
However, I think most students would
agree that the Phi must continually recon-
sider the content of the paper, in light of its
responsibility to the W&L community.
Then the editors can confidently begin to
sign their articles.

Sincerely
Andrew Trotter

 

 

Sweet Briar Student Blasts Phi

Dear Editor

I have more than a few words to say in
response to “A Freshmans’ Guide to sur-
rounding Girl’s Schools’’—a profile of
Sweet Briar College (Sept. 13) written by
some (naturally) anonymous journalist.

To begin with, in any type of profile, I
feel that it is necessary to have an UN-
BIASED opinion in the mind of the author.
It seems to me that this particular writer
has had some out-of-the-ordinary en-
counters with our security force, as that is
what he spent two-thirds of his article talk-
ing about.

Granted, our security system has
become stricter since last year, but did the
author ever stop to wonder why? Obvious-
ly some need for additional control must
have presented itself. This need stems
from the amount of unwanted trespassers
(hence, the reason you are questioned at
the gate) invading our grounds, and even
more so, from the perpetual damage in-
curred last year from too many unacciden-
tal ‘“‘accidents”’ (such as throwing a 30 lb.
cement receptacle through dorm win-
dows). Personally, I agree with the addi-
tional control, as the money to cover such
damages comes out of my _ pocket
whenever the so-called ‘‘man’’ fails to
report himself and own up to his respon-
sibility.

Furthermore, the writer also seemed
somewhat insulted that the security of-
ficers (which, by the way, are no longer

“rent-a-cops,”’ if you don’t mind) did not
take to ‘‘a lot of lip, or a swing in their
general direction.”’ This to me is appall-
ing. The least favorite aspect of a security
officer’s duties is the role of a
disciplinarian. Why ‘must the writer and
others further burden this duty hy harass-
ing the officers and generally making a
fool of themselves? Does this habit prove
one’s manliness or something? I’ve yet to
figure it out.

Moreover, the writer mentions that
there is a lack of women at Boathouse par-
ties. Did he ever stop to think the reason
behind it may be that there are few girls
who would want to attend the same party
as a guy with his kind of attitude? Most of
the guys I know at W&L do not share his at-
titude, but of the ones I know that do, I, too,
find my books more interesting.

Another point: I found it rather peculiar
that the author feels a ‘‘meaningful rela-
tionship” can only be established after
‘“‘pumpkin-time.”’

I happened to show a copy of the
aforementioned article to a freshman at
W&L on his first visit to SBC—which, by
the way, he had not previously read. He
stated that he had no problems with securi-
ty and found the women here to be quite
nice. After reading the article he said he
probably would not have visited our school
if he had read the article beforehand. Isn’t

Article Criticized

Warner

(continued from page 10)

One might suggest that a part
of this dilemma is due to the
fact that many of the men who
are now becoming successful
are significant alumni are men
who attended W&L in the late
40’s and early 50’s as veterans
of WW II and were thus a little
wilder than your basic 18-year-
old freshman. There even is a
precedent for this phenomonen.

Quoting Henry Ruffner, a pro-
fessor and _ president of
Washington College, from the
recently published history of
Liberty Hall Academy, speak-
ing about Revolutionary War
veterans who enrolled in the
academy:

‘Many of these young men of
the fields and woods had been
taken away to camps and towns
where depraved manners grew
familiar to their eyes and cor-
rupted their hearts. They on
their return home too easily
communicated their acquired
knowledge of evil to their young

contemporaries... The number
of those who studied amuse-
ment and roguery was so great
as to make the teachers office
exceedingly irksome _ and
discouraging.”

But the number of men who
recognized and seized the in-
tellectual opportunities offered
by W&L suggests that an inflex
of veterans is far too simplistic
an explanation for the problems
illustrated by a perception of
W&L such as that articulated by
Warner.

A large measure of what
could be termed an identity
crisis stems from an imperfect
understanding of W&L’s
heritage and tradition.

Senator Warner and many
others trumpet the honor code
and the ideal of the gentleman
while bragging about exploits
which run counter to both.
Though their lip service seems
to be their only service to these
high ideals, they feel that they
have somehow topped into the

W&L tradition.

Thus connected in some
mythical way to the school, they
vow to maintain the great tradi-
tions of which they are a past.
Warner’s goal as a Trustee is
“to preserve Washington and
Lee as (he) knew it and as (his)
father knew it.”

A key aspect of his preserva-
tion effort is a commitment to
keep W&L all male. Other in-
stances of ‘‘traditionalism”’ at
W&L are numerous and ob-
vious.

But the maintenance of these
aspects, these superficial
“‘traditions,”’ the work hard-
play hard myth, the exagerated
role of fraternities and other
social indicators are not at the
heart of the Washington & Lee
tradition.

“Strict constructionalists”’
like Warner are too busy mak-
ing sure the buildings stay red
and white and the student body
stays all male, to understand
the heritage of men like William
Graham and Robert E. Lee.

The five years of Lee’s
presidency are five of the most
vibrant years in the school’s
history. Lee established the
first school of journalism in the
country, one of the first
business departments in the
country, and generally turned
the curriculum upside down—
reshaping it to serve the needs
of the day.

The tradition of Lee is one of
experimentation and innova-
tion, one of excitement and
change. Based upon the legacy
of Lee, W&L should have been
one of the first schools in the
country to become co- educa-
tional, not doomed to be one of
the last. Old Robert E. is pro-
bably in his crypt, in his chapel,
spinning like a dervish over
what the school named after
him has done in the name of
tradition.

It is said that Lee’s father,
Light Horse Harry, was pro-
bably influential in helping

George Washington decide to
donote his 100 shares in the
James River Company to the
then Liberty Hall Academy in

1796. Just think what W&L

would be like today if Lee had
thought like John Warner and
had tried to preserve the school
his father knew.

We’d all be out of Mulberry
Hill and the triuium and the
quadrivium would seem like a
major educational break
through.

What I’m trying to say is that
W&L is far too good a school to
be trivialized and misinter-
preted by Mr. Warner’s drivel.
And it has far too much poten-
tial as an educational institution
to be encyained by a limited no-
tion of tradition which im-
mortalizes piano stoked bon
fires and Jabbo the beer man
while it makes ‘‘honor’’,
“education’’, and ‘‘gentleman”’
to pass’’ words to mouth, but
not ideals to live by.

qualified.’ Abraham ended the discussion
by saying, ‘‘We’ll call ‘em back and tell
them we can’t make it this time.”

My complaint is threefold. First, I think
Mr. Abraham’s conduct was inexcusable.
His attitude will set the tone for every
issue the E.C. addresses itself to this year.
I realize that an E.C. meeting need not be a
strictly formal affair, but I hope Abraham
will use better judgment in the future in
deciding what is serious and what is not.

My second complaint concerns Mr.
Fraser’s after thought. I am assuming that
as a third year law student Mr. Fraser is
an adequate public speaker, therefore, he
meant he was not qualified to speak on the
particular subject. In the course of the
year, if not already, Fraser will be respon-
sible to pass judgment in many honor
trials. If Fraser is not familiar with the im-
portance of the Honor Code, is he then
qualified to judge an honor trial?

Third, I think the Executive Committee
is responsible to represent the student
body in all respects. Failing to send a
speaker was not only rude but stupid. The
E.C. missed an excellent opportunity to
enhance Washington and Lee’s image out-
side of the community. Opportunities such

as this do not occur often. If the opportuni-

ty arises again I strongly urge the Ex-
ecutive Committee to take advantage of it.
Sincerely

it a shame that the misrepresentation of
Sweet Briar College in your newspaper
may cut out one-fifth of the area’s women
from your other freshman?

I am very proud to attend this college
and to see it so grotesquely portrayed
hurts me deeply. Especially when this por-
trayal was written by a student from a
school I admire. Sweet Briar College has a
great deal more to offer than an effective
security force and crowded parties. I feel
that if the editor cannot choose a journalist
who will report an assignment of this sort
without bias then he should eliminate the
article altogether. Thank you for the op-

portunity to air my views.

Washington and Lee’s Homecoming
will see a weekend of sports, music, and
revelery as the school greets returning
alumni and friends.

The Allstars, the ever-popular rock
band from Charlottesville, get the week-
end off to an early start tonight with a
concert in the Cockpit. The Allstars will
play two shows, at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets, which are limited to 200 per
show, are available at the door for $1.00

for students and $2.00 for others.

The festivities begin again Friday at 4
o’clock with a Student Activities Board
party on the law school field. The SAB
will provide 25 kegs and tapes.

 

E A double concert is slated for Friday

night in the old gym. The rock band Sand-
castle will start at 8:00 p.m. and will be
followed by the Catalinas, who play fif-
ties, beach, and rock music. Both the
concert and the law school party are free
to students and guests.

Saturday’s activities will be kicked off
by a rugby game at 1:00 o’clock on the
Alumni field. The football team will play
Fordham at 1:30 0n Wilson Field.

During halftime the Homecoming
Queen will be selected from one of the
talented beauties nominated by the fra-
ternities, the law school, and the Student
Association for Black Unity. As tradition
mandates, Dr. James Shillington will
crown the queen.

s Homecoming Weekend Events Begin Tonight

The Homecoming activities continue
after the game with a sophomore class
grain party at Zollman’s Pavilion fea-
turing the Bruce Hornsby Band. Class
passes are required for admission. Satur-
day night will see many fraternity par-
ties.

Rounding up the festivities will be the
annual alumni-varsity lacrosse game on
Sunday at 11a.m. on Wilson Field.

More than 250 alumni guests and their
families are expected at Washington and
Lee University for Homecoming
Weekend.

The number of alumni visitors for the
fall weekend will be somewhat smaller
than in previous years because of recent

)

changes which have placed all class re-
unions in the spring, W&L’s alumni
secretary, William C. Washburn, said.
Even so, Homecoming will be the setting
for a special alumni conference, to which
some 65 of the visiting alumni have been
invited as delegates.

“These delegates represent various
alumni chapters across the country,’’
Washburn said. ‘‘The theory is to bring
back special friends of the university for
a three-day intensive review which-will
make them better informed—alumni,
who also, in turn, will bring a great deal
of expertise to us at Washington and
Lee.’’ Special alumni conferences have
been a regular feature on the campus for
many years. J

EC Distributes
Student Funds

by Joe Scott
Working with $1,000 less
than last year, the Executive
Committee divided $73,170 of
student funds between 10 com-
mittees at Tuesday’s budget
hearings.

The recommended amounts
are still tentative with possible
future fund shuffling.

‘“‘We have less money to work
with and a lot more money was
requested,”’ said EC President
Steve Abraham. With approx-
imately 35 less students this
year, we are already at a disad-
vantage, he said.

Committee requests totalled
$97,969 or $24,799 over what was
collected from student fees and
taxes.

SAB Requests

Emphasizing fiscal tightness,
the EC cut the Student Ac-
tivities Board request by $13,020
to a level just under the $30,850
they received last year. The
figure, set at $28,430, was divid-
ed between the University
Center Committee and the re-
maining SAB expenses.

UCC Representative Jamie
Small, receiving $7,130, said
that his reason for the increase
over last year ($4,600) was
maintaining or increasing the
quality of the bands for the
Cockpit. ‘‘I would like to expand
the number of bands to around
35,’’ said Small,’’and have
bands of a little more higher
quality.’’ Small added that he
wished to put the Cockpit on “‘a
tour like circuit.’’ ‘We are
becoming a known spot on the
map,’’Small said.

‘A lot of what Jamie is trying
to do is pick up the slack,”’ said
Bill Ridge, co-chairman of the
SAB. He was refering to the
lack of on campus parties on
Wednesday nights. ‘‘I’d like to
keep the road up here,”’ Small
said, adding that the lack of
weeknight entertainment would

force many to other colleges.

Law Representative John
Fraser then moved to reduce
the ban allocation to $6,000
because ‘‘I don’t think we are
being realistic. The amount re-
mained $7,000.

The remaining $21,400 was
divided between the film com-
mittee ($3,400) with the rest
funneled to entertainment.
General office expenses and
publicity costs were budgeted
at $2,000.

Notable changes in entertain-
ment were the scratching of a
Winter Weekend and a serious
reduction in funding for the Spr-
ing Weekend. These funds were
channeled to the mixers
category with the explanation
that large rock concerts were
no longer feasible and that

_more top bar bands would be

playing at Zollman’s Pavillion.

Alumni exclusion from Fancy
Dress was discussed with Ridge
and co-chairman David Har-
pole agreeing that substantial
money would be lost with the
new ticket limit and forecast a
probable increase in this year’s
prices.

The film committee noted
that they were absorbing the
Student Bar Association films
and the EC granted an addi-
tional $100 to the SAB to be
atken from the Film society.

The Mock Convention, which
technically receives no EC
funds, was budgeted at $33,000.
The money was raised in part
by a $5 increase in student tax,
approved by the Board of
Trustees. The increase put the
tax at $50 per person and was
directly put into the Conven-
tion’s account. This procedure
is standard every convention
year.

SBA

The SBA was given $12,581.
Requested was $13,527 for this
body who governs 334 law

SAC Fines SAE

by David Greer

Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater-
nity was fined $300 by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee and the
Interfraternity Council when
some of its members misbe-
haved at Howard Johnson’s
restaurant early this year.

The IFC fined the fraternity
$50 for restitution and levied a
$50 fine for punishment. When
the case reached SAC for re-
view, as all IFC Judicial Board
cases do, SAC added a $300 fine
and placed SAE on conduct pro-

bation for the rest of the term.

Conduct probation is a warn-
ing and if the fraternity comes
before the board again it could
be in serious trouble.

Dave Constine, president of
SAE, said he appealed the SAC
fine and it was reduced to $200,
so that the total in fines was
$300. He said he wrote Howard
Johnson’s a letter of apology.

The action stemmed from an
incident at the Howard John-
son’s restaurant earlier this

Alumni

Barred

From
- Fancy
Dress

The Student Activities Board
made final its decision to stop
selling Fancy Dress tickets to
alumni and to hold the ball in
the student center.

The SAB made its decision
after holding a meeting to
discuss the issue with the stu-
dent body Sunday night. Very
few students attended the

meeting.
The decision to allow only
students, faculty, and_ staff

came after 5,000 persons attend-
ed last year’s ball. The capacity
of the Student Center, including
the dining hall is 2,139.

The fear of a fire is the major
factor in deciding to limit the at-
tendance.

The Student Activities Board
first voted Sept. 23 to hold the
ball in the gymnasium and to
allow alumni to attend. The
decision was reversed after the
SAB discussed the logistics of
having the ball there.

Problems lay in the immense
area to decorate, the locating of
several activities in two gyms
and a classroom, and the at-
mosphere. “‘It’ll look like your
high-school prom,”’ said Jamie
Small.

Last year, 600 to 650 alumni
and their dates attended Fancy
Dress. This year, one ticket per
student will be printed. A stu-
dent can sell his ticket to
whomever he pleases.

The SAB suggested that the
Alumni Ball, held in the spring,
be open to all alumni. Present-
ly, the Alumni Ball is open only
to alumni holding reunions that
weekend,

EC Apologizes To Pub Board

by Joe Scott

Personal apologies were
given to the Publications Board
resulting from an unauthorized
withdrawal from their reserve
fund of $2,000 at Monday night’s
Executive Committee meeting.

“Tt turns out it was improper
advice,” said EC vice-president
Les Cotter. ‘‘An oversight was
made. It was a mistake made
out of ignorance,’’ he added.

The discrepency surfaced
when the Pub. Board was told of
the EC withdrawal after it had
already occurred. The money,
added to $3,000 from the Student
Body Reserve Fund, was used
as an advance payment to the
Calyx in order to take ad-
vantage of a two percent dis-
count publishing rate. The Pub
Board’s money is independent
of EC funding. (See letter to the editor,
page 14.) ‘

The financial advice was
given to Cotter by Louis V.
Synder, Business Manager and
Assistant Treasurer, who also
offered his apologies. The
dispersement has already been
put back in the account.

Ben Keesee, President of the
Pub Board who submitted a

statement questioning the ac-
tion, said he had no objection to
the procedure itself. ‘“The over-
sight” he said, ‘‘was not notify-

ing the Pub Board.”’
Research Ad
“I think it’s potentially

dangerous,”’ said Senior EC
Representative Dee Keesler
referring to the Ring-tum Phi
research paper ad. “It is a
potential object of abuse.”

The EC discussion emerged
when the committee’s general
opinion on the ad’s effect on the
honor code was sought by Ran-
dy Smith, Editor-in-Chief of the
Ring-tum Phi.

”T would like to see it out of
the paper,”’ said Sophomore EC
Representative Nelson Ould.
EC President Steve Abraham
agreed saying that it should be
withdrawn.

“I see no problem with runn-
ing the ad itself,’’ said Senior
EC Rep. Jay Blumberg. “By
taking it out we are saying that
we don’t trust the students,” he
added. ‘‘I don’t think it offends
anyone who has confidence in
the honor system.”’

Later a point was made by EC
senior Law Rep. John Fraser

that a better procedure would
be to ask the Pub Board’s ad-
vice.

Junior EC Rep. Rob Willis
disagreed. ‘I think we shouldn’t
sjuff this off on the Pub Board.”’
Further comments by Fraser
still contended that it was im-
proper for the EC to comment.

The motion to delete the ad
failed with a tying vote of 5-5.
Willis then recommended that
the Phi discontinue the ad until
the payment for the advertise-
ment had been received and un-
til the Pub Board had met to
discuss the matter. Keesee then
said the Pub Board could ac-
tually accomplish nothing on
the matter.

Monthly Reports

Monthly reports by the Stu-
dent Activities Board, the Cold
Check Committee, and _ the
Ring-tum Phiwere reviewed by
the EC.

Jim Vines, chairman of the
Cold Check Committee, paid
back $400 to the EC from a
previous loan to cover bad
check offenders. Adding that
money still has not been receiv-
ed from some students, one of
whom is no longer at
Washington and Lee, Vines sug-
gested that the lawyer on re-
tainer by the EC, Thomas
Spencer, be authorized to of-
ficially send letter to habitual
offenders.

Keesler asked if any other
measures were being taken by
the committee to which Vines
‘replied that ‘other transcripts
are being held.”

The EC cited a serious com-
munications problem that ex-
isted in the SAB showing of Pat-

explained that an experienced

from the Board was able to han-
dle the scheduled showings
because of the conflicting SAB’s

Ring-tum Phi Business

an informal report outlining an
$800 deficit for the first three
issues of the newspaper. Addi-
tional comments citing costs
and savings were noted.

“IT hope we don’t step on any
toes tomorrow night,” said
Abraham, speaking about Tues-
day evening’s budget hearings.

to be as equitable with the
money as we can,”’ he said. ‘‘We

by the EC is still in effect with
the SBA supplying an additional

Mock Convention Report

 

by Jim Vines

The most widely known
aspect of Gerald R. Ford’s can-
didacy these days, is the uncer-
tainty of its existence. Mr. Ford
seems to be the Republican
Party’s counterpart to Sen. Ed-
ward Kennedy, playing the
waiting game to the hilt.

Though Mr. Ford is con-
sidered to be among the
strongest choices for the
Republican nomination, there is
sentiment that he will not even
choose to run. At best, he con-
siders himself ‘‘available for
the campaign, only if invited.”

Close associates feel several
‘improbable things will have to
happen in an improbable se-
quence before Mr. Ford’s name
will be seen on any ballot in the
state primaries.”

In the event he decides to run,
Mr. Ford will probably skip the
first few primaries and wait un-
til some of the secondary con-
tenders are dropped from the
ballots. This is due to a visible
trace of self-confidence on Mr.
Ford’s part. He is reasonably
sure that he is seen as the only
anti-Reagan savoir, besides be-
ing certain the population is
aware of its mistake in 1976.

His strength against Mr.
Reagan has been affirmed in
several unofficial, unpublished
polls taken by the National
Republican Party, which shows
the former president as the only
man within reach of the ex-
actor.

Hopefuls like Sen. Howard
Baker and former Texas Gov.
John Connally fall behind Mr.
Ford despite the certainity of
their participation in the race.

Regardless of the fact that
President Jimmy Carter’s
volatile two and one half years
in office are making Mr. Ford’s
two and one half years of firm
leadership look rather attrac-
tive, Mr. Ford is up against
some formidable personal bar-
riers to his candidacy.

Betty Ford’s health has been
known to be aggravated by
public life and it appears that
two years out of the limelight
have been beneficial to her well-
being. There is little doubt this

will weigh heavily in Mr. Ford’s
decision, not only because of
consideration for his wife but
through memory of _ her
outspoken candor during his
term in the White House.

Besides his wife, there is the
obstacle of a pleasant retire-
ment to overcome. For the past
30 months Mr. Ford has been
living what has been sar-
castically described as a
“rough’”’ life.

At his well-known retreat at
Vail, Colo., close to his favorite
pipe and his beloved ski slopes,
Mr. Ford is understandably
hesitant to resume the rigors of
a politician’s career.

He has been able to satisfy his
appetite for the political game
through his writing—A Time To
Heal—and the frequent and
lucrative public appearances he
claims to enjoy, though it is
rumored that he considers these
functions a despised duty.

Last week, Mr. Ford took his
predicted stand against SALT II
in a lengthy essay appearing in
the Washington Post.In the
event that he does elect to enter
the race, he will likely need his
opposition to the SALT II treaty

_ to offset the nagging memory in
the minds of many conservative
Republicans of his support for
the controversial Panama
Canal Treaty.

Mr. Ford has also been spend-
ing some time trying to explain
the validity of the Nixon pardon
with the expectation it would

Ford Candidacy Uncertain

not be used against him in a
future campaign.

A final indication that he is
definitely considering abstain-
ing from the action, is the go-
ahead he has granted to some of
his most important financial
supporters, who have displayed
a desire to back other can-
didates in the event Mr. Ford
does not run.

For a candidate who is not in-
dependently wealthy, though he
would have a difficult time in
qualifying for food stamps,
missing such major support
with very little time left to ac-
quire new resources would be
dangerous in this day when
cash flow is as vital in the pur-
suit of a primary victory as are
the issues,

Theater Group Performs Soon

Roadside Theater, a traveling
troupe from the mountains of
Kentucky, will present its most
recent show on the Washington
and Lee University campus
next Wednesday (Oct. 10). En-
titled ‘Brother Jack,” the pro-
duction will begin at 8 p.m. in
the Troubadour Theatre at the
corner of Main and Henry

Review

Streets.
Roadside’s style evolved
from the storytelling its

members grew up watching and
hearing — southern Ap-
palachian “‘tall tales,’’ remem-
brances, and both original and
traditional songs aecompanied
by guitar, banjo and fiddle.

Americathon

 

Directed by Neil Israel, Written
by Phillip Proctor and Peter
Bergman, With Harvey Kor-

 

man, Fred Willard, and
Richard Sehall
by Dash Coufal Korman is uninspired as the

Americathon is full of clever
lines; proving once again that
cleverness, while amusing, has
no substance.

In Americathon America
owes some 400 billion to a
manufacturer of clown-feet
(trust me). The treasury is flat
broke, there are no fossil fuels,
people live in cars, bicycles are
the major form of transporta-
tion, and Vietnam is the Rivera
of the future (I didn’t invent
this). After rejecting such ideas
as raffeling off the tomb of the
unknown soldier (‘‘T.V. Raffels
don’t work’’), the President, a
graduate of EST, decides to
have a thirty day telethon to
bail America out, the
Americathon.

The only strength of the
movie is in its cleverness. Say-
ing that dinosaurs died out
because they were all teeth and
no brains, and then showing
Jimmy Carter, is funny, but
hundreds of these cleverisms
are hardly enough to propel a
movie. The movie has a unify-
ing plot, but the plot itself is not
funny and can’t be saved by one
liners.

Fred Willard, the genius who |

played Gerry Hubbard on
America 2-nite, is wasted in the
role of the movie’s villian. His
great gift, acting dumb with
sidesplitting irony, is nowhere
to be seen in this part. Harvey

television host, having but one
funny moment.

Richard Schall, who played
Boon in Aminal House, is lost in
chaos as the central character,
a media specialist, and seems
to be there only to add a sense of
the first person. He hasn’t even
been given straight lines that
are played upon. Things are fur-
ther complicated since Schall’s
first-person voice-overs have
been given to George Carlin,
who sounds more like Willard
than Schall.

The authors, Proctor and
Bergman, are masters of the
fifteen-minute sketch but not
two-hour movies. Having seen
them live, I can say that by and
large they and their material
are funny. They a 2, alas,

Americathon is, however,

funnier than Jerry Lewis on -

If you’re still thinking of go-
ing, then do, because

Americathon is preceded by a
short called Doubletalk that is a
small masterpiece. In
Doubletalk a boy comes to pick
up his date and we hear not only
the dialogue, but also the peo-
ple’s thoughts. The situation is
laced with prejudice and
hypocrisy. If only Doubletalk
could have been the feature,

minute Proctor and Bergman

of Roadside’s home by the
W.P.A. Writers’ Project in the
1930s. With this blend of actual
history and original material,
the players weave a sense of the
flow of time in the mountains
from the turn of the century to
today.

The group is a “road” com-
pany in the strictest sense of the
word. Roadside has no resident
theater, but performs continu-
ally throughout the southern
and mid-Atlantic states. Its cur-
rent tour includes stops at Lin-
coln Center in New York and at
Washington’s Kennedy Center.

In addition to its performance
in Lexington, the three mem-
bers of the troupe — Ron Short,
Angie DeBord, and Tommy
Bledsoe — will conduct a
workshop Thursday morning
(Oct. 11) in the Troubadour
Theatre. Both events are free,
and the public is welcome.

W&L Grads Present Art

Two Washington and Lee |

University graduates will re-
turn to the campus this fall to
exhibit some of their recent art-
works in the campus bookstore.
The first, Stephen K. Roberts,
has already opened his show,
which continues until Nov. 8. He
will be followed by Drayton N.
Smith, whose drawings will be
on display until the start of
W&L’s Christmas vacation.

Roberts is diligent in his pur-
suit of art as a full-time career,
and acknowledges ‘‘varied
amounts of success.’’ Most of
his projects are in silk-screen,
and are being exhibited this
year in five galleries, most of
which are in the Washington
area.

His style — dominated by
black lines and vibrant colors —
is an offshoot of techniques he
developed as a student at W&L
in the early 1970s. Roberts gives
much of the credit for his ar-
tistic development to I-Hsiung
Ju, W&L’s artist-in-residence,
who “has kept me in the art
scene until the present,” he
said.

Roberts was a student of Ju’s
when the Art Farm was estab-
lished — a local haven for bud-
ding artists to work and exhibit
— and he also accompanied the
teacher to Taiwan for further
study. ‘Prof. Ju paid for my
airplane ticket in return for my
work at the Art Farm in its in-
itial summer,’’ he said.

A 1976 graduate of W&L,
Roberts’ recent commissions
include the official poster, ex-
ecuted in silk-screen, for
Children’s Day at the National
Collection of Fine Arts of the:
Smithsonian Institution last
summer. For his bookstore ex-
hibition, he has prepared a suite
of W&L campus scenes, ‘‘the

first time I’ve tried this style

with outdoor subjects.”’
Drayton Smith’s exhibition,
which will immediately follow

Roberts’ collection, is compos-
ed primarily of drawings and
etchings of human figures. Con-
sidered a realist in the technical
sense, he comments that he
“tries not to overlook the ob-
vious. In essence, I guess you
could call me a ‘day-to-day’
realist ‘

Smith also cites Prof. Ju as a
guiding force — along with such
diverse figures as Dr. James
Leyburn, emeritus professor of
sociology and former dean of
the university, Dr. W. Barlow
Newbolt of the physics depart-
ment, emeritus professor of
journalism O. W. Riegel, and
John Gunn of W&L’s economics
department. Gerard M. Doyon,
also of the W&L art depart-
ment, ‘“‘has been a great help to
me even after graduation,”
Smith added.

The 1974 graduate taught for

four years at the Porter-Gaud
School in Charleston, S.C.
(Coaching the football team
was the best part, the artist
laughingly adds.) He spent the
summer of 1977 studying at the
Sorbonne in Paris, and the next
summer saw him at the Medical
College of South Carolina, ex-
ecuting detailed studies of
human anatomy.

Among Smith’s most inter-
esting projects was a series of
sculptures for the blind, com-
missioned by the Gibbes Art
Gallery in Charleston, where
W&L’s collection of Louise
Herreshoff paintings was ex-
hibited last spring. Another
noteworthy project was carried
out this summer when he
designed sets for the Henry
Street Playhouse production of
“The Contrast,’’ in Lexington’s
Troubadour Theater. One of
Smith’s drawings — a scene of
Washington Hall — was fea-
tured on the cover of W&L’s
alumni magazine last October.

WLUR Plays Ball

And to think it all started with
a game of touch football...

Such is the story from WLUR-
FM station manager Robert J.
deMaria, assistant journalism
professor, about the part to be
played by Washington and Lee
University in the founding of a
student-operated radio station
at Sweet Briar College.

According to deMaria,
students involved in W&L’s
radio station — _ primarily
Junior Ben Keesee, Public Af-
fairs Director, and Junior Cur-
ran Snipes, Music Director —
called Sweet Briar to challenge
their female counterparts to a
game. Instead, they received
their own challenge — to aid the

girls in the debut broadcasts of
WSBC, as -the new station is
called.

Today the WLUR staff will
drive to Sweet Briar for a three-
hour training session concern-
ing the behind-the-scenes world
of radio production. Supervis-
ing this and other programs for
the emerging 10-watt station is
student manager Stephanie
Stitts. Her staff has said WSBC
is in dire need of records and
tapes, and donations will be
greatly appreciated.

Another case of W&L gallan-
try to the rescue? To be sure.
But never fear — the football
game is also going on as
scheduled, and the post-game
drinks are on the girls.
“Fidelio” Airs Monday

The Chicago Symphony’s
fourth season of radio broad-
casts opens this year with a con-
cert performance of Beetho-
ven'’s only opera, ‘‘Fidelio,”
Monday (Oct. 8) at 6 p.m. on
WLUR-FM, Washington and
Lee University’s radio station.
WLUR is at 91.5 0n the FM dial.

Performed under music di-
rector Sir Georg Solti, the
presentation will feature
soprano Hildegard Behrens and
tenor Peter Hofmann as the
principals, Leonore’ and
Florestan, with bass Theo
Adam as the evil Don Pizarro.

“High minded” is the most
common phrase used_ to
describe Beethoven's
‘Fidelio.”’ Its themes are the
celebration of married love,
and the triumph of freedom
over tyranny.

Beethoven disapproved of the
more frivolous type of operatic
subjects in fashion — the year
was 1805, and works in the style
of Mozart were the rage — and
never sueceeded in finding a se-
cond suitable libretto. However,
into ‘‘Fidelio’ he poured
enough energy to have compos-

Rock

by Mark Kinniburgh

Modern rock and roll, dating
from the mid-sixties, has taken
many different paths which
have established currents of
popular music. A_ rough
schematic would feature, say,
Fats Domino or Elvis at the lub
of a wheel, and the ever-
growing spokes would be the
many classifications of today’s
rock. In very rough terms,
there is Country Rock, Hard
Rock, New Wave, Soft Rock and
Traditional Rock.

New Wave would appear to be
the junior member of this set,
and maybe even an unabashed
fluke or incorrect choice. The
fact is however, that the old
Beatles when they were star-
ting, wore leather jackets and
were about as punk as today’s
Romones.

New Wave has always been a
factor in rock, although never
really labeled as such. I tend. to
call my driving force in rock
**New Wave” because of the im-
plication that it is, in reality
leading the rest of its contem-
poraries through a “wave” of a
new style or feeling in music.

But back into the discussion
of where the music world on its
wheel of ‘‘genve"’, and to begin
with Country Rock, there is a
real problem. Bands like the

ed several others. He revised
the work completely twice, and
as for overtures — the case is
unique in music history — he
composed no less than four: the
three well-known ‘‘Leonore’”’
overtures, and finally the
“Fidelio” overture that is
generally acoepted as the most
suitable to his operatic purpose.

The story of ‘Fidelio’ starts
before the action of the opera
begins. Florestan, the idealistic
victim of political oppression,
has been imprisoned for two
years by Don Pizarro, governor
of a Spanish state prison.
Florestan’s devoted wife,
Leonore, suspecting the truth
behind her husband’s mysteri-
ous disappearance, has manag-
ed to enter the service of Rocco,
the jailer — hoping to win his
confidence and find her hus-
band. To obtain the post, how-
ever, she has had to disguise
herself as a young man, Fidelio.
The action of the opera deals
with the gradual unfolding of
Leonore-Fidelio’s successful
ploy and the last-minute rescue
of Florestan.

Musical highlights include, in

Music Classification

Allman Brothers have been
kicking around since 1969 with
various personel changes and
internal troubles, and now, with
the fall of the South’s Capricorn
records, it’s difficult to say
where the future of country is to
be.

One suggestion is the quintet
of Molly Hatchet, who some
contend is the reincarnation of
Lynrd Skynyrd. On their latest
album entitled ‘‘Flirtia -With
Disaster’’ they show the pro-
mise of an early Lynyrd with a
new twist of power.

The new sound also is com-
plemented by the superior
musicianship of the band, and
although they lack an anthem
such as *‘Freebird’’, be on the
lookout for some more albums
from Molly Hatchet.

Hard Rock is always difficult
to rationalize and even worse to
pick what will be trend setting
and commercially successful
even 2 months in advance. Most
major record companies are
skeptical about hard rock
releases because of the high

 

Act. I, Don Pizarro’s aria ex-
plaining his hatred of
Florestan, a showpiece for a
bass, and the famous
‘‘Prisoner’s Chorus’? which
closes the act, and in Act II,
‘“Florestan’s Aria,” in which
the tenor laments his state and
dreams ecstatically of Leonore.
Currently in his 11th year as
music director of the Chicago
Symphony, Sir Georg Solti has
led the orchestra to a position
perhaps unmatched since the
days of Toscanini and the NBC
Orchestra. He made _ his
American debut in San Fran-
cisco in 1953, and assumed
directorship of the Royal Opera
House at Covent Garden in 1959.
His reign lasted 10 years and
culminated in his knighthood,
bestowed by Queen Elizabeth
II. Last month, Solti assumed
the additional post of principal
conductor and artistic director
of the London Philharmonic.
The symphony’s second pro-
gram, on Monday, Oct. 15, in-

burn-out rate.

For example, the Kiss album
“Dynasty” had a great deal of
publicity and was expected to
be a huge commercial success.
It failed miserably.

My favorite hard rock album
of late is the Queen double
album “‘Live Killers’’, recorded
on an early 1979 tour of Europe.
Critics may pan this album as a
typical Queen album with what
they deserve, an audience.
Now, if I can be convinced that

Library Obtains Letter Collection

An important collection of
ante-bellum letters written by
Dr. Alfred Leyburn, native of
Lexington and a student at
Washington College in the early
1820s, has been added to the
special collections of the
undergraduate library at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.
The letters, primarily per-
sonal in nature, discuss many of
the leading families of the col-
lege community from the 1820s
through the 1840s. Donors of the
collection are Mrs. Marion
Junkin and Margo Junkin,
descendants of Dr. Leyburn.

Born in 1803, Alfred Leyburn
was the son of Capt. John and
Jane McDowell Leyburn. He at-
tended Washington College for
two years before transferring to
Princeton University. After
medical school, he set up prac-
tice in Lexington and began a
long period of closs association
with Washington College, as
Washington and Lee was called
until 1871. In 1840 he was elected
to the school’s Board of
Trustees, a position he held for
several decades.

Perhaps the most noteworthy
contribution made by Dr.
Leyburn in these years was in

1865 when, as secretary of the
Board of Washington College,
he drafted the letter inviting
Robert E. Lee to become the
president of the war-torn
school.

Leyburn became the rector of
the board in 1872. During all
these years, and up to his death
in 1878, Leyburn was an active
force in the affairs of the
Presbyterian church.

W&L Head _ Librarian
Maurice D. Leach Jr., com-
mented that the group of letters
and genealogies ‘‘complement
superbly our  Lexington-
Rockbridge manuscript
resources such as_ the
Zachariah Johnson and William

A. Anderson papers, the
University archives, and the
Rockbridge Historical Society
manuscripts which are housed
here. Historians studying the
area will find these items of ex-
ceptional interest.”’

Alfred Leyburn’s  great-
grandson is Dr. James Graham
Leyburn, the eminent
sociologist and social historian
who taught at Washington and
Lee for a quarter-century until
his retirement in 1972. James
Leyburn was dean of the univer-

. Sity at W&L from 1947 until 1955.

The author of “The Scotch
Irish” and the award-winning
‘Haitian People” among many
volumes, Dr. Leyburn now lives

Major casting has been an-
nounced for the Drama Depart-
ment’s production of William
Shakespeare’s Hamlet which
will be presented at the
Troubadour Theatre from Oct.
29 until Nov. 3. Rehearsals for
the tragedy have begun.

Cast in the title role of the
play is sophomore Grant
Kunkowski, a drama major who
has previously appeared in
Ghost Sonata and played the ti-
tle role in The Guardsman.

Hamlet’s friend Horatio will
be portrayed by Kurt Kam-
merrer, a junior, who is also a
drama major. He played the
lead role last year in Otherwise

Engaged.

Rob Davis, a sophomore, will
play Polonius. A drama major,
he was featured last year in The
Guardsman and Otherwise
Engaged.

Frank Billingsly has been
chosen to play Polonius’ son,
Laertes.

Also cast have been Terry
Frankenberger, a senior drama
major, as the King, Claudius,
and Betty Kahn as his wife,
Gertrude. The part of Ophelia

will be played by Sherry Moore.
The play is being directed by

designed by faculty designer
Tom Ziegler. He told the Ring-
tum Phi that the play is “‘being
done in the traditional style”’
with Medieval period settings.

Ziegler also said the play
would be a challenging one in
that the ‘‘logistics of getting (a
hugh cast) together learning
their lines’’ is difficult, and it is
hard to make a_classic—
especially a Shakespearian
tragedy—interesting to modern
audiences. He feels that they
are lucky to have a good pro-
duction and a strong cast.

Hamlet will play from Mon-
day, Oct. 29 until Saturday,

We are aware of the financial
constraints, said SBA President
William L. Garrett. ‘‘We are in
the same position you are in,”’
he added, ‘‘and our padding is
minimal.”

“This is one example of how
costs are going up and they are
asking for the same thing,”’ said
Law Representative John
Fraser. ‘‘Even though we have
eight students fewer, we're get-
ting screwed out of $1,000-that’s
the bottom line.”

The EC’s reason for granting
less funds was attributed to
fewer law school students. Of
the student tax that the law
students paid, 86.2 percent went
to the SBA.

“We are faced with more
awesome costs then ever
before,” said Ring-tum Phi
Editor-in-Chief Randy Smith.‘
It is now going to cost $6,000 to
$7,000 more to put out the
paper,” he said. ‘‘Our printing
costs are up about than 20 per-
cent.”’

The Phi requested $13,367 to
offset the increases and keep
the paper at or slightly above
last year’s size. ‘“This year we
are going 16 per week,” said
Business Manager’ Kevin
McGowan. A 14 page issue was
the previous average.

“We are cutting costs every
way we can,”’ Smith said and
added that this year’s issues
would have. anational flavor
that directly affects W&L
students. Also hoped was an in-
crease in investigative pieces.

Senior EC Representative
Jay Blumberg motioned ten-
tatively to give them $8,500 with
Senior EC Rep. Dee Keesler ad-

ding that additional money
could come from the Contact
budget.

EC Secretary Cove Geary ad-
ded that Mock Convention copy
every week gave the paper less
room to work with.

A total of $500 was withdrawn
from Contact and the Phi was
awarded $9,000.

Additional discussion  con-

cerned the selection procedure

noted that several houses had

Film Society
Representative Jay Diesing
received $600 for the W&L Film
Society, $100 of which was taken
from the SAB budget. The socie-
ty hopes to sponsor nine films
this year and that any addi-
tional sponsorship would be
helpful. Diesing said though
that the SAB was “‘going for a

English Club
The EC gave $300 to the W&L
English Club, a $200 increase
over last year. The money will
help pay for three visiting lec-
turers, their meals and
refreshments after the club’s
events.
Rugby Club

‘“There’s a good possibility
that we may cease to operate,”
said Alex Richards during the
Rugby Club budget request.
The EC considered cancelling
the request due to past
mismangement of the team.
‘“That’s in the past now,”’ said
Richards.

Asking for $670 for the
semester, Richards placed
most of the expense on gas.
Richards said that the club
members already were paying
for their own uniforms and for
$15 in club dues.

There are 43 people on the
team this year and we have an
eight game schedule. Fan sup-
port has also increased tremen-
dously. Our club is definitely
improving, said Richards.
Awarded was half the amount
of $330.

Keesler submitted the first
Squash Club budget request and
was given $50. Reasons given
for social expenses were that it
“goes alone with the squash

“people would shy away from

The EC noted that if litigation
between the rock group

more money would be available

to all. They cautioned though
that the matter might not be

pense account, approximately
$1,700 remain.

Students Convicted, Fined
For Playing In Street

Three members of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were found
guilty of ‘‘playing in the street”’
in Lexington General District
Court Tuesday by Judge Joseph
Hess.

The three students, Hall Vet-
terlein, Ham Davis, and Scott
Graham, were issued sum-
monses by Sgt. Jack Purvis of
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment on September 9 for throw-
ing a football in the street in
front of the fraternity house.

Judge Hess said that he was
concerned that someone would
get hit by a car. He told the
three students to pass the word
on to others, especially
members of fraternities with
small yards, that the city has
several designated recreation
areas, which, though not always
conveneint to the students, are
necessary so people are not all
over the place.

  

y

€

Velterlein stated that the
three were not involved ina full-
fledged game, and therefore the
chance of getting hit by a car
was diminished. Hess ruled that
no fine would be imposed, but
that the students must pay $13
court costs. The football, which
was conficatea at the time of ar-
rest, was returned.

Today’s Lesson:

Winning!

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

O.K. class, now I’m sure of it. After watching the
lowly Green Bay Packers humiliate the mighty New
England Patriots on national television Monday
night, I’m convinced that all it takes to be a winner in
sports is the desire to outplay your opponent, a little
luck and an extreme amount of pride.

The Packers went into the game with several
starters injured, the second worst offense and defense
in the league, and a 1-3 record. The Patriots went into
the game with a 3-l record and the NFL’s number-one
offense and number-two defense.

But the Pack came to play. Playing at home and on
national TV, the Packers looked like the Packers of
the Lombardi era. Lombardi’s philosophy was
simple—the team that blocks and tackles better is the

team that will win. And who can argue with Lom-

bardi’s record?

Monday night, the Packers out-blocked, out-tackled
and simply out-hustled the Patriots. Playing with the
same pride and enthusiasm that has been the
trademark of football in Green Bay since 1919, the
Pack earned a 27-14 victory.

The Packers were not supposed to win Monday
nightThey were 10 point underdogs. But point spreads
didn’t mean much to the fellas from Wisconsin. New
England may have had the statistics on their side, but
the Packers had their pride—and pride can go an
awful long way.

Even when they were down and it looked like it
would be an easy New England victory, the Pack
didn’t quit. The Patriots jumped out to an early 7-0
lead in the first quarter, but the Pack came back.
Scoring three unanswered touchdowns and stifling
the Patriots’ usually-potent offense, Green Bay took a
commanding 20-7 lead. They even surprised Howie.

The Patriots did manage to score again, but a com-
bination of some hard running, timely passing and
tenacious defense enabled the Pack to hold on for a 13-
point win.

Pride, hustle and desire are the elements for any
winning formula. Of course, there is the element of
luck—but everyone needs a little luck once in a while.
With these four ingredients, any obstacle can be
overcome—even having less talent than your op-
ponents. This was proven Monday night in Green Bay.

End of lesson.

Generals Lose

Late TD Downs W&L 15-8

by Dale Park
If last week’s game against

. Randolph-Macon could be sum-

med up in one word, the word
would be frustration.

The Generals showed the
same tenacious defense as they
did the week before against
Centre and included an improv-
ed offensive effort. Yet this was
not enough as W&L lost in the
final minutes of the game, 15-8.

The Yellow Jackets were held
scoreless for almost the entire
first half. Senior defensive back
Mark Lewis led the effort,
breaking up a crucial pass in
Macon’s first offensive series
and intercepting a pass to stop a
subsequent series of downs.

The W&L offense began to
move the ball early in the se-
cond period as quarterback Jim
Wenke hit slotback Chris Leiser
with a pass to move the ball to
the Yellow Jacket 26 yard line.
The drive was stalled, however,
as a W&L fumble was
recovered by Macon’s Sam
Larsen.

This was the only fumble
recovered by Macon all day. In
all, W&L fumbled three times
yet lost the ball only once. The
General defense caused four
Yellow Jacket fumbles, three of
which were recovered by W&L.

The General defense
countered immediately. A
Macon sloppy snap was im-

mediately recovered by senior
defensive tackle Mike Mrlik on
the Macon 26 yard line.

This time the Generals
capitalized. Although the offen-
sive drive stalled, freshman
kicker Bill Devine booted a 40-
yard field goal to give the
Generals a 3-0 lead.

“Devine did a super job for
us,’’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘‘Bill has a lot of en-
thusiasm, yet was’ very
relaxed—he showed a lot of
poise.”

Yet two defensive lapses were
to cost the Generals the game,
lapses that become more
frustrating when compared to
the overall defensive effort.

The first occurred with time
running out in the first half.
Macon drove to the Generals’ 20
yard line, but a defensive surge
led by sophomore defensive
ends John Winans and Tom No-
ble pushed the Yellow Jackets
back to the W&L 33.

Faced with a tough fourth and
25, Macon quarterback Sean
Shull threw a desperate pass to
wide receiver Roger Casseum.
Barely in bounds, Casseum
caught the pass for a touchdown
with only 1:34 left in the second
quarter. The conversion was
successful and the half ended
with the Generals trailing 7-3.

Passing and_ defending
against the pass proved to be
the key to the Generals’ loss.
While Macon was able to gain
111 yards through the air, the
General managed to connect for
only 46 yards.

On the ground, the situation
was different. W&L outrushed
the Yellow Jackets 127 to 95
yards, and were penalized for
only 25 yards as compared to
Macon’s 70 yards.

In the third quarter, the
Generals defense quickly cut
Macon’s lead to 7-5 as defensive
end Noble sacked Yellow
Jacket quarterback John
Lysher in the endzone for a
safety.

Receiving the ball on the free
kick, W&L moved to the Macon
36 before being stopped.
Randolph-Macon took over
after a Syd Farrar punt, but im-
mediately fumbled. Again, the
ever-present Mike Mrlik
recovered on the Macon 16.

Four plays later, Devine was
called on to boot his second field
goal of the game, this time from

W&L, VMI Golfers

Begin Invitational

Golf teams from Washington
& Lee University and the
Virginia Military Institute will
pool their resources this
weekend to host the first annual
VMI/W&L University Invita-
tional. The 36-hole event is
scheduled for Saturday, and
Sunday, October 6 & 7, and will
take place on the 6444-yard Lex-
ington Golf and Country Club
course,

“This tournament is a first
for our area of the state, looking
at the response we received
from the schools invited, I’d say
we’ve got a strong annual
event,”” commented Generals’
coach Buck Leslie, referring to
the fact that 13 Virginia schools
will participate in the Invita-
tional.

Play on both days begins at
8:00 a.m, A practice round is
scheduled for Friday, October
5.

All of the state’s Division I
schools are lined up (Rich-

mond, Virginia, Old Dominion,
Virginia Tech, VMI, and
William & Mary) along with
five schools from the Division
III, Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference (W&L, Lynchburg,
Roanoke, Hampden-Sydney,
and_ Bridgewater).
Madison and Virginia Com-
monwealth round out the field.
Captain Gerry Barousse will
top the Generals’ line-up in the
tourney. The senior from New
Orleans, La., earned All-
American honors last year and
won the ODAC inidividual title.
Lettermen Bill Alfano, Tom
Wall, and Jim Kaplan will man

W&L’s second, third, and fourth '

positions, respectively. Titus
Harris will round out the team.

28 yards. With 14:15 left in the
game, the Generals had an 8-7
lead.

It was not to remain so,
however, as Macon began to
move the ball late in the final
period. Yellow Jacket quarter-
back Shull took his team to the
W&L 35 yard line.

Under a fierce General pass
rush, Shull threw up a wobbly,
last chance pass and what ap-
peared to be an easy intercep-
tion.

For just a moment, the
General defense again lapsed,
allowing the ball to find its way
through three W&L defenders to
Macon’s Chuck Gupton at the
W&L 8 yard line. Three plays
later, Macon running back
David Beatty scooted in for the
score. The two-point conversion
was successful, and with 2:32
left in the game, Randolph-
Macon took the lead, 15-8.

A last-chance drive by the
Generals ended in the arms of
Yellow Jacket defensive back
Ted Koepsel who intercepted a
W&L desperation pass. °

“‘We have to put 60 minutes of
good football together,” said
Fallon after the game. ‘‘At this
point, the team is still highly ag-
gressive and very com-
petitive.”

Other defensive standouts
were defensive tackle Dave
Nickels who recovered an early
fumble, and defensive back
Gene Newton who broke up
several Macon passing at-
tempts. .

The Generals take on the
Rams of Fordham at next
Saturday’s Homecoming game.
Fallon describes Fordham as
“a big, explosive football team
with an especially good
defense.’’ The Rams have 13 out
of last year’s 22 starters return-
ing and have a present record of
1-2.

Commentary:

WE&L Football:
Young & Eager

by Bill Whalen
Last Saturday was Youth Day at Randolph-Macon.
No, it was not a promotional gimmick, the youths
were out on the field playing for the Generals.

 

Of the 22 players who started for W&L last Satur-
day, 17 were underclassmen. Of more importance is
_the fact that nine of the 17 started on defense.

In football, individual games are decided by the of-
fense. A good defense does not win games, it wins
championships. If you don’t believe me, look at the
teams which make the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh has
won it the last three years thanks mainly to its “Steel
Curtain” defense. Dallas has won because of its
‘“Doomsday”’ defense and who can forget Denver and

its “Orange Crush” or Miami and the “No-Name”’
defense?

After only four games this year, a trend has already
set in. The W&L defense, anchored by a front line of
four sophomores and a senior, has been able to hold
its opponent to either one or two’ touchdowns a game.
With a defense capable of allowing only two scores
every four quarters, the Generals can stay close in
every game.

Last Saturday, the front line of sophomores John
Winans, Tom Noble, Dave Nickels, Mike Pressler and
senior Mike Mrlik combined for a total of three fum-
ble recoveries and made life miserable for Macon
running backs all day long. Noble even scored a safe-
ty by tackling the Macon quarterback in his endzone.

But these weren’t the only underclassmen to play a
big part in the game. Freshman kicker Bill Devine
provided W&L’s other six points by booting field goals
of 40 and 28 yards. And in the closing moments of the
game, sophomore quarterback Jim Wenke was taken
out in favor of—you guessed it—another sophomore
quarterback, Rich Hachenburg.

Having a lot of underclassmen starters is nothing
new to a W&L football team. Traditionally, football at
this school has been a sport in which two-year par-
ticipation is normal. Juniors and seniors are hard to
find. But this too seems to be changing.

The reason is simple: Gary Fallon has incorporated
a positive attitude and has also developed a system to
place quality players on the varisty team.

This year, Fallon has started a J.V. football team to
complement the varsity program. The cause of this is
numbers. With an increasing number of freshmen
coming in each year, there simply are not enough
spots for everyone on the varsity.

Instead, Fallon will take those players who would
not see much playing time with the varsity and give
them plenty of game experience with the J.V. team.
After a year or two of J.V. ball, the players will
theoretically be able to play on the varsity level.

Fallon is not the first to use this idea. Verne Can-
field develops his basketball players in the same way.
Freshmen basketball players typically spend a year
or two on the J.V. team in order to learn the Canfield
system of basketball.

Hopefully, Fallon will meet with the same amount
of success as has Canfield. In his first year at W&L,
Fallon went 2-8. In his first year at W&L, Canfield also
won two games (his record that year was 2-17). Two
years later, Canfield’s team was 20-5.

If Gary Fallon’s program matches the success of
Verne Canfield’s, beware of the Generals next year.

Homecoming Highlight:
Lax Alumni Game

 

by Kip Gordon

The fifth annual Alumni-
Varsity lacrosse game is
scheduled for Sunday, October
7, at 11:00 a.m. on Wilson Field.
A popular event among lacrosse
fans, the game provides an en-
joyable look at former W&L
stars, as well as a preview of
the General’s 1980 team.

Head Coach Jack Emmer ex-
pects his squad to perform well
against the alumni, and said,
“‘we’d like to think we can beat
them this year; they’re starting
to get a little too cocky.”’ In-
deed, the veterans have every
reason to be confident, having
won the last three contests in-
cluding last year’s game, 14-13.
The varsity has won only once,
in 1975, taking the series opener
7-4,

The alumni squad this year is
as strong as ever, and features
recent first-team All-
Americans Sam _ Englehart
(’73), Skip Lichtfuss (’74), and
Tom Keigler (’77).

Englehart is best
remembered for his potent
shot—as well as his ability and
desire to use it. He tops the
record books with career totals
in most goals (180) and most
shots (457). He will be joined by
W&L’s all-time leading scorer

Don Carroll (’76), who amassed
229 points.

Dave Warfield (75) will also
be on hand. He was a second-
team All-American and is se-
cond on the W&L scoring list
with 207 points. Rounding out
the attack will be two of last
year’s tri-captains, John Black
and Jeff Fritz, who respectively
occupy the fourth and fifth
places on the scoring list. To
say the least, these five scoring
threats should provide an offen-
sive powerhouse.

Defensively, the alumni are
again more than solid. Keigler,
a skilled stick-handler who was
most notable for his tenacity on
ground balls, will be supporting
Charlie Brown (’78), a second-
team All-American goalie. Jim
Farrar (’74), another defensive
standout, was a third-team All-
American.

Ted Bauer (’74), a three time
first team All-American mid-
die, is unsure about playing. He
currently holds the W&L record
for most assists in a game with
seven, and if he shows he will
join mid-fielders Jack Dudley
(77), Doug Fuge (’78), Charlie
Steiff (78), and ’79 tri-captain
Sandy McDonald.

Also playing will be a fair
number of vintage talent. Bill

Clements (50), W&L’s first
first-team All-American at
goalie, will be opposing his son,
Bob Clements, himself a
second-team All-American
goalie and co-captain of this
year’s team. It is the only
father-son confrontation in the
game’s history.

Jim Lewis (58), another first
team All-American, completes
the list of netminders. It is said
that Jim played without a chest
protector in order to quicken his
reflexes. But it is more than
likely that Jim will don one for
the upcoming contest.

Jim Perryman (’54) is still
active in lacrosse, playing for a
club team in Texas. His son is
currently a freshman lacrosse
player at W&L.

The amount of talent and ex-
perience which the varsity
Generals will face must certain-
ly offer a bleak outlook for the
game. Yet the fact remains that
the Generals have lost only
three players to graduation,
and thus have an experienced
roster. Nevertheless, the 24 var-
sity members returning from
last year’s squad will be, in
fact, pitted against veritable
legends who will certainly hold
a psychological, if not physical,
edge in the upcoming contest.

 

Tennis

The W&L fall tennis team
opened up its 1979 fall campaign
by taking sixth place in the
Navy Fall Invitational played
last weekend. Despite the sixth-
place finish (host Navy swept
the top team honors), Coach
Gary Franke termed it ‘‘a good
tournament for us,” noting that
W&L was competing with five
Division I schools and Division
III power, Swarthmore.

Freshman Steve Denny from

 

Team Takes 6th

Bethesda, Md. turned in the top
individual performance as he
won two matches in the ‘“‘C”’
division before bowing 6-0, 6-1 to
his Navy foe. Winning first-
round matches were All-
American Steward Jackson,
Peter Lovell, and the doubles
team of Lovell and Doug Gaker.

Franke explains that the fall
season gives the freshman
players a chance to establish
themselves in the program and

all players an opportunity to
win positions by playing
“challenge matches.” Six to
eight Generals will earn varsity
berths while the remainder of
the 21-man squad will play on
the JV team.

The W&L netmen will again
be in action this weekend at the
James Madison Tournament in
Harrisonburg. Other _ partic-
cipating teams are James
Madison, George Mason, and
Richmond.

General Mark Turner injured his leg, but it did not stop W&L. A
late second half goal enabled the Generals to upset Eastern

Mennonite.

Booters Win 1-0

by Chris Sisto

The varsity soccer team
evened its overall record at 2-2
last Saturday with a 1-0 win
over Eastern Mennonite.

Late in the second half,
W&L’s Mark Turner was il-
legally taken out of the play by
a Mennonite player within 18
feet of the opposing goal. This
gave the Generals a penalty
kick with 20 minutes left in the
contest. Brian Williams
capatilized on the opportunity
to score the only goal of the
game.

W&L coach Rolf Piranian
praised everyone on the team
for the win, but gave special
notice to the defense. He ex-
plained, ‘‘It was a total team ef-
fort, but the defense really
sparked us. Our defenders beat
Mennonite to the ball
throughout the entire game.”’

This strong defensive effort
accounted for the offense hav-
ing several opportunities to
score. In the first half, the

Generals outshot their op-
ponents 13-7. Scoring chances
by Mark Turner and Bill Brown
were stopped by the Mennonite
defense.

In the second half, the
Generals continued their
physical style of play and solid
defense until they scored their
goal. Following the goal, the
Generals played conservatively
as Piranian used his ‘‘prevent
defense” to stall for the win.
Goalie Kevin Carney saved the
win in the last few minutes
when he stopped several scor-
ing bids by Mennonite.

Piranian was happy about the
win and said, ‘I am very pleas-
ed with the way we played to-
day. The team is starting to put
things together now. Also, this
gives us our second ODAC con-
ference victory against no
defeats.”’

W&L tri-captain, Doug Seitz,
played superbly on defense and
was named W&L’s player of the
game,

The W&L water polo team got
off to an extremely successful
start of their 1979 season last
weekend, coming up with three
wins in three games at the
Johns Hopkins Invitational
Tournament.

Coach Page Remillard was
very pleased with his team’s
performance, citing excellent
defensive play by the entire
squad as instrumental in the
wins.

The Generals started off slow-
ly in their first game, falling
behind 3-1 against Johns
Hopkins at the half. But W&L
stuck to its game plan, and
came back to score six goals in
the second half whild holding
the Blue Jays scoreless. The
final score of the initial game
was W&L7, Johns Hopkins 3.

In their second game, W&L
was matched against the Naval
Academy. On the previous day,
Navy had played Johns
Hopkins, giving the Generals a
fine opportunity to scout the op-
position.

Relying on a ‘“‘tight, ag-
gressive man-to-man defense,”
the Generals were able to stifle
Navy’s superior outside
shooting and take an im-
pressive 12-3 victory.

W&L’s third and final game of
the tournament was a rematch
against the Johns Hopkins team
they had defeated on the
previous day. The Generals
again won the game, but in
what Remillard called ‘‘a slug-
gish, anticlimactic victory.”

Part of the reason for the ap-
parent lackluster play during
the contest was that the game
was played only one half hour
after the victory over Navy.
The final 7-4 win gave the
Generals first place in the tour-
nament.

Commenting on the tourna-
ment, Remillard made it very

23 South Main Street

 

The Ring-tum Phi, October 4, 1979, Page 11

Undefeated

clear that he was pleased.
‘“We’re right about where I
would have hoped we would
be,”’ said the coach.

He also noted that there is
much improvement to be made
if the team is to become a con-
tender for the Southern League
championship. Specifically, he
said, improvement must come
in being able to ‘‘read’’ op-
ponents and identify what they
are attempting to do.

Another area which demands
improvement is that of “‘man
advantage”’ situations, which
are the equivalent of power
plays in hockey. The Generals
scored on only three of 11 such
opportunities. This figure
should be closer to 50 or 60 per-
cent.

Standout individuals in the
tournament included co-captain
Biff Martin who led the
Generals in scoring with 11 of
their 26 goals, and Bob
Newcomb, who played
“outstanding defense’ and had
four goals. Both were praised
by their coach.

But the player who was the
key to all three W&L victories
was goalie Will Hodges. Says
Remillard: ‘“‘That was the key
to our success—tough defense
in the field and Will’s closing off
everything else that they shot.”

Hodges had 23 blocks, and he
allowed ten goals for a .696
block percentage. According to
Remillard, anything over .500 is
respectable for a water polo
goalie.

Hodges prefers to credit his
defense with his success.
“When the defense plays as
tight as our defense played, it’s
much easier to make the
saves,” said the goalie.

The W&L water polo team
travels to Richmond for their
first conference competition
this weekend, with their first
game Friday night against East
Carolina.

Duck

Season
Opens

by Jim Feinman

Area hunters have a chance
to cash in on early migrations of
wood ducks and teal this week
with the early duck season in
Virginia which opened Wednes-
day. The October 3-6 season is
specifically designed to give
waterfowlers an opportunity to
bag certain species of birds that
will normally have passed
through the area when the
regular season begins
November 20.

The daily limit for ducks is
based on a 100-point system that
assigns specific values to dif-
ferent species of birds. A hunter
must keep a tally on the com-
bined point value of the ducks
he bags. When the last duck
bagged equals or exceeds 100
points, the hunter has reached
his limit.

 

Ducks that have a 70-point
value are black ducks, hen
mallards, mottled ducks and
hooded megansers. Twenty-
five-point birds are wood ducks
and drake mallards. Blue and
green winged teal, pintail, gad-
wall and widgeon have a 10-
point value.

The James and Maury rivers
should have large populations
of wood ducks and perhaps a
few mallards and_ blacks.
However, high water from the
heavier-than-usual rains will
hamper much of the gunning on
these rivers. Smaller streams
in the area might be the best bet
for local hunters. Careful stalk-
ing along the banks could pro-
vide good jump-shooting with a
more than reasonable chance of
retrieving fallen game.

A special duck stamp is need-
ed in addition to a Virginia hun-
ting license to hunt waterfowl.
Stamps are available at the post
office.

Squirrel season opened in
Rockbridge County on October
1 and will run through October
13. The season will open again
on November 12 and continue
through January 31. The limit
will be six squirrels per day.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK T otters To The Editor

Alumni Banished From Fancy Dress

kditorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Pr.

The Budget Hearings

The blood is on the floor after the Executive Com-
mittee’s record five and a half hour budget hearing
Tuesday night. Although last year’s budget meeting
lasted just under four and a half hours, most student
committee’s got amounts close to the sums they ask-
ed for. This year the deadly combination punch of in-
flation and fewer student bodies (and, hense, less
money) resulted in a smaller pie for all the student
organizations to share.

The process was in many ways similar to cutting
the head and feet off a person to make him fit a
smaller bed. The Student Activities Board took it on
the chin, with their budget being slashed by $10,000.
The law school walked away with close to a $1,000 less
this year than last year’s take. Actually, we came out
of the hearing in pretty good shape and we’re very
greatful. The whole process made it very evident that
the student tax will have to be raised at least $5 next
year just to keep up with inflation.

But that’s enough about the budget hearing for now.
We'll tell you what we really thought about it next
week—after we’ve gotten our money.

Enough Is Enough

First there was Hurricane David. Then we were hit
by Hurricane Frederick. The two combined to bring
us one of the wettest Septembers in the history of the
region, and October has not shown much promise for
letting us dry out.

So we urge the powers that be to end this damp
weather. The sun hasn’t been out for so long that
we’ ve almost forgotten what it is like to be warmed by
the sun’s rays. And these hurricane-flash-flood
downpours have simply got to stop—before the entire
town washes away.

And as long as we are on this subject, why is it hur-
ricanes are now named after men? The unpredictable
nature of hurricanes makes it more appropriate that
they be named after women.

Taking Issue

I really must take issue with
myself concerning last week’s
article. I just don’t know what
got into me. Imagine, referring
to females as objects solely of
desire and lust. Surely, such a
point of view is both warped and
somewhat fearful to behold.

Because we exist in an all-
male environment, with in-
creasingly shrinking social op-
portunities, it is difficult to
understand the female _per-
sonality. Misconceptions arise
from the lack of both com-
munication and sympathetic in-
terpretaton. Too often, it is easy
to draw a_ depreciating
generalization concerning the
opposite sex.

Alleged ‘‘free’’ parties at
neighboring girls’ schools
which deteriorate into expen-
sive displays of affectionate in-
terest might be viewed as
unreasonable stinginess on the

part of people with enough
plastic credit to buy all of
Rockbridge County. Lime green
or pink ensembles with mat-
ching hair bands, skirts, shoes,
and purse might be seen as ex-
cessive bad taste, or vanity,
depending on one’s degree of
color sensitivity. Total devotion
to soul music while harboring
deep-seated unacknowledged
prejudices could be
misconstrued as shallowness.

The opportunities for
misconception, then, are many
and varied. Only by constantly
realizing that we are dealing
with very nice people with very.
nice parents can the urge for
dehumanizing stereotyping, of
which the “piece of meat”’ view-
point might be one of the more
flattering, be avoided.

Of course, someone, certainly
not me, might point out that
some of the same things could
be said about us.

Vepco Has Bad Nuclear Safety Record

A. Robert Smith

Norfolk—If Virginia Electric and
Power Company, the most heavily fined
utility in the nation for nuclear safety
violations, were in traffic court with its
record, it would have its license suspend-
ed for recklessness, be sent to driver-
education school, and be tested for com-
petence before being reinstated.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has repeatedly cited Vepco for with-
holding information or providing mis-
leading information, for weakensses in
its security system, for design and con-
struction inadequacies as its Surry and
North Anna nuclear plants, and for fail-
ing to follow required procedures for
guarding workers against radiation.

Mr. Smith is associate editor of the Nor-
folk Virginia Pilot.

 

Fines against the Virginia utility have
been levied on five occasions since 1973,
most recently a $15,000 penalty in
August, for a_ not-so-grand total of
$127,400. Only Consolidated Edison of
New York, with seven fines totaling
$105,000, is in the same league as a per-
sistent offender of federal nuclear safety
regualtions.

When questioned about this dubious
distinction, Vepco President Stanely
Ragone claimed that ‘anti-nuclear
forces and disgruntled employees have
probably caused Surry to be inspected
more than any other plant in the country.
It’s like an audit. The more you audit, the
more you find.”’

That’s rather like saying Virginia’s
auto inspectors find many safety viola-
tions because they inspect autos too
often.

If it isn’t the freaks and inspectors, it’s
the bureaucrats. In 1976 when the NRC
fined Vepco $32,500 for making false
statements about its North Anna plant,
Ragone claims that a high NRC official
‘told me they had to start showing they
were cracking down on people, and they
needed an appropriation. That was the
reason (that Vepco was punished).”’

If such bureaucratic gamesmanship
was a factor in penalizing the utility, it
reveals something about the govern-
ment’s past permissiveness with nuclear
power development rather than an un-
warranted crackdown on Vepco.

Growing public concern about nuclear
safety induced President Ford and Con-
gress in 1974 to abolish the Atomic
Energy Commission because it was both
promoting and trying to regulate nuclear
expansion. If the NRC felt compelled to
show that it was putting safety first, it
was only because the public and Cngress
thought a tough appraoch was overdue.
Whether the NRC has in fact been strict
enough is a question for the president’s
Three Mile Island Commission to con-
sider.

Federal inspectors fault nuclear plants
for all sorts of infractions, but only the
most severe or repeated violations result
in fines. Of the 48 public and privately
owned utilities licensed to operate nu-
clear plants, only 18 have ever been fin-

No Prosecution

ed. Either the other 30 have relatively
clean records or the NRC is still not a
tough cop.

But do utility fines have a useful ef-

 

fect? As a practical matter, such sums
can be paid from a giant utility’s petty
cash fund. And in Vepco’s case, company
officials seem more intent on justifying
infranctions than promising safer prac-
tices.

If there is any way of scolding a utility
into doing better, it is to force it to shut
down an unsafe plant. Most of Vepco’s re-
actors are currently shut down for modi-
fications required by the NRC, causing
the company to buy more expensive elec-
tricity from other sources. It has, of
course, applied for stiff rate increases, so
it is the consumers—not management or
the stockholders—who get stuck with
paying for its mistakes.

Instead of levying fines, the NRC

More Letters To

might do better with a point system. Like
moving violations by motorists, serious
and repeated violations can be assumed
to indicate careless, if not reckless,
management that threatens public safe-
ty. Upon receiving a dozen points, the
utility would have to shut down all its
nuclear plants until it has persuaded the
NRC that its management is_trust-
worthy.

Moreover, any extra expenses incur-
red by such an order should be absorbed
by the company and its stockholders, not
passed onto ratepayers. If dividends are
cut because management fails to obey
safety rules, stockholders will have an in-
centive to insist on safe, not just pro-
fitable, management practices.

Utilities became used to being coddled
by the AEC when nuclear plants were
considered costly and experimental. To-
day Vepco justifies its tilt toward nuclear
plants by saying they are less expensive
than oil or coal plants to operate. That
means that rising fossil-fuel costs give
the utilities greater incentive to keep
their reactors on line.

But the mechanism for forcing the in-
dustry to observe public-safety rules is
faulty. Modest fines for violations are
easily paid, and expensive shutdowns for
safety-inspired modifications are charg-
ed to rate-payers. A point system carry-
ing the risk of loss of operating permits
would strengthen the NRC’s hand.

It that seems drastic, consider the
alternatives. Better a shutdown than a
meltdown.

Really Now, Who Cares?

Dear Editor,

Student apathy on campus is
at an all-time high in my opi-
nion. This assertion is sup-
ported by the lack of student
participation at Sunday’s Stu-
dent Activities Board meeting.
The decision to ban alumni
from the Fancy Dress Ball is

obviously a controversial issue,
but fewer than 15 students
bothered to attend.

I could carry on a lengthy
dissertation concerning — this
matter but I don’t feel like it
right now.

Sincerely,
Who Cares?

Sing-A-Longs On Sundays

I'd like very much to make a
suggestion. I guess everyone
has their own causes that they
would like to further. Mine is
singing—traditional, old-
fashioned ‘‘sing-a-longs’’.

When I grew up (I’m now 50)
we had our “‘now’”’ songs just as
today—but
somehow, we were taught songs
of former days as well. We all
knew World War I songs as well
as songs of the West, Civil War
songs, World War II songs,
“gay ninety” songs.

Music, I think everyone will
agree, is a very important,
vital, and representative ex-
pression of the times.
Nowadays, no effort is being
made to keep the old songs
alive. Every year they are be-
ing buried a little deeper. The
beautiful songs of Stephen
Foster!! Those heart breaking
songs of the Civil War...such
songs as “There’ll be Blue
Birds over the White Cliffs of
Dover’’...They are, in essence,
ballads telling of current
events.

My suggestion is this! — Why
not have—on a regular basis a
“‘sing-a-long”’ of traditional old
songs on Sunday evenings in
front of Lee Chapel? Students
could lounge around on the
campus under the trees—

listening and singing. The lights
from the Colonnade and Lee’s
Chapel (which are on anyway)
would be ample light. Music
students could perform! Solo
violin or flute!! How perfectly
hauntingly beautiful it would be
to have such music in that set-
ting!

V.M.I. offers its parade for
public entertainment. These
evenings of informal, tradi-
tional music could be W&L’s
counterpart—and most ap-
propriate for an educational in-
stitution.

It could be so easily started,
too. Just get as few as ten peo-
ple together who like to sing and
put a notice on the bulletin

board announcing the time. The
just couple of times it might be
poorly attended—but so what?
The sessions could end with a
lovely old hymn such as ‘‘Now
The Day Is Over.”’ (Even the
old hymns are not being sung
like they used to. It seems to me
that whenever I go to church,
they rarely sing the ‘‘old
faithfuls” any more).

It would just take a little in-
itiative on the part of one person
who reads this letter to get this
idea started. I hope that ‘‘one
person”’ reads this letter.

Whither The Gentlemen

Sir:

I have one question. Where
are the gentlemen of
Washington and Lee? It certain-
ly was not a gentleman who
broke my Baker dormitory win-
dow Friday afternoon without a
note of apology. It could not
have been.

A gentleman would have had
the intelligence to read the
regulations concerning games
in the quad (they are pro-
hibited), the sense to follow the

regulations, and the courtesy to
at least leave a note of apology
for the damage and inconven-
ience caused.

This letter is not meant to in-
sult the gentlemen who must be
on campus somewhere, only the
cowards who, by their in-
considerate and_ infantile
behavior, disgrace the reputa-
tion of the University and the
student body.

Sincerely,
Lucinda Harrison

Even More Letters To The Editor

Prof. Decries ‘Murky Moralism’ EC Rep Defends Newspaper

Dear Sir:

I was shocked and sadly disappointed
in reading your most recent issue of the
Ring-tum Phi. It started out okay with a
pleasant (but meaningless) photograph
of the Colonnade and four solid news
stories on the front page, but then
noticeably disintegrated throughout the
next twelve pages.

Page two had one more news story,
another photograph with no accompany-
ing article and a letter that was con-
tinued from page 10—hardly consecutive
and logical reading. I realize layout pro-
blems and deadlines are hard to deal
with, buy my real concern was with the
quality of material and writing that I
found in the rest of the paper.

Page three had a cynical story of boy

conquers girl in the guise of a
‘“‘Reporter’s Probing Investigation.’’ The
least that can be said is that it was fairly
well written, but I found myself wonder-
ing why it had been written at all. There
seems to be a policy in your paper this
year of introducing humor in the form of
sexually exploitive articles. The one on
page three was fairly mild compared to
the unsigned article ‘Success with
Women” on the editorial page. Was it on-
ly my perception or was there some sub-
conscious motivation in placing this
sophomoric hymn to the double standard
next to Parker Potter’s thoughtful piece
on Sen. John Warner’s article in Shenan-
doah Magazine.

Mr. Potter’s essay made the point that,
with all his lip service to the W&L ideals
of the code of gentlemen, the honor
system and the great history of this in-
stitution, Sen. Warner had negated these
ideals by the trivial behavior he recalled
as part of his conduct as a W&L student.

EC Vice-President Apologies For‘Inconsiderations

Dear Members of the Publications Board
and Students,

At Monday night’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting a letter was filed by the
Publicatons Board President, Ben
Keese, concerning the financing of a cash
advancement to the ‘‘Calyx’’ which I
would like to take the opportunity to ex-
plain to the Student Body.

On Sept. 24, John Hamilton, Business
Manager of the Calyx, requested and
received by a unanimous vote of the E.C.
a $5,000 advancement in order to take ad-
vantage of a 2 percent discount offered
by the contracted publisher of the Calyx.

Realizing the urgency of this request,
as Vice-President I contacted the proper
University official in the Business Office
to seek his advice on the advancement of
this amount in light of the fact that the
Central Student Body Funds had not been
channeled into the various accounts of
student body committees.

It is only after the E.C. has received,
studied, and approved the individual
committees’ budget requests and subse-
quent allocations that the Student Ac-
tivities fees are transferred into the
separate committee accounts.

Since the Vice-President is the
manager of the ‘‘disbursements of stu-
dent body funds, subject to the approval
of the Executive Committee,” I discuss-
ed this advancement, as I had with
previous advancements, with the Univer-
sity official who oversees the accounts of
the Student Body.

After discussing several alternatives,
the advice I received was to divide the
$5,000 advancement two ways: $3,000
coming from the Student Body Reserve
Fund and $2,000 from the Publications
Board Reserve Fund (so as not to deplete

either account below the minimum) with

Where do gentlemen’s codes, the honor '
system and our heritage fit in with an ar-

ticle advocating lying as a best means to
achieve the desired ‘notches on the
belt?”

This murky moralism was even more
graphically demonstrated in your
editorial defending the publication of an
ad for research papers that could be pur-
chased by students and, in violation of all
our ideals, presented as their own work.

You defend yourself by claiming that
you needed the money and commented
that students used this service at their
own risk. Come now. You choose to
publish that ad; you could have refused,
and you certainly could have sought
advertising alternatives to make up the
money you so sorely need. There is no ex-
cuse for offering such a service in the
newspaper published by the students of a
school dedicated to academic excellence
and high ideals of living.

If Mr. Potter pictures General Lee as
spinning like a dervish as a result of
alumni triviality, what is the poor
General doing in response to your asser-
tion that anything is fit to be published—
even articles advocating lying and
cheating—as long as they bring in the re-
quired rewards.

One final comment. The few articles
worth reading in the September 27th,
issue were marred by slopping editing
and proofreading.

I have in the past come to respect the
Ring-tum Phi and the hard working
students who put it together. I find it very
sad to see what it has disintegrated to
this year.

Sincerely,
Pamela H. Simpson

the understanding that the accounting
procedure would reverse itself once the
1979-80 budgeted funds for the Calyx
were properly channeled.

After informing John Hamilton of the
disbursement voucher written on
September 25 deriving the funds as
stated above, it became clear to me as a
theretofore unrealized point of informa-
tion ‘‘that the funds of the Publications
Board are not student funds in the sense
that they are not derived from student
activities fees.”’

In short, by virtue of the advice I
received I was misinformed, not inten-
tionally to be sure but rather, as Mr.
Keese states in his letter, in a matter of
‘“‘a simple oversight’ on the part of the
University official.

However, Mr. Keese’s strongest objec-
tion was of the “Executive Committee’s
failure to notify the Board of its inten-
tions; a failure which is, to say the least,
inconsiderate.”’

This also became quite clear to me
once I was educated to the fact that the
Publications Board Reserve Fund is
totally independent of other student body
funds and does not come under the Vice-
President’s managing of disbursements
of Student Body funds.

Therefore, on the next day, Sept. 26, I
authorized a voucher and transferred the
$2,000 back into the Publications Board
Reserve Fund to correct this oversight.
The Reserve Fund thus returned to its
original balance of September 25.

The Calyx did not receive its entire
$5,000 allocation which will be carried as
a temporary deficit in its account until
the 1979-80 budget is finalized on October
9th.

= es Let me reiterate that the Publications

 

Dear Prof. Simpson:

At last Monday night’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting the editor of this
newspaper came before the E.C. to ask
our feelings about the research paper
advertisement in the Ring-tum Phi.

I am very flattered that the editor

came and inquired as to the students’ opi-
nion on this matter, but the real question

is whether this ad abused the honor
system in anyway. Specifically, he refer-
red to your ‘“‘letter to the editor.”’

You, sharply criticize the newspaper
for many of its articles, and in your letter
you do focus on the research paper
advertisement.

There are two sentences in your letter
which I would like to address. These
sentences are: “This murky moralism
was even more. graphically
demonstrated in your editorial defending
the publication of an ad for research
papers that could be purchased by the
students of a school dedicated to
academic excellence and high ideals of
living.”

These two sentences bother me quite a
bit. Implied in both of these thoughts is
the fact that given the opportunity,
Washington and Lee students will buy a
research paper and try to hand it in as
their own work.

Are you saying, Professor Simpson,
that you do not trust the students at
Washington and Lee? I think you are.

You believe that students are inherent-
ly dishonorable and should not be subject
to such tempting ideas as paying for a
research paper. I believe you are way off
base and should be set straight.

First of all, there are many other uses

Board’s major point of objection—that of
the E.C.’s failure to notify the Board of
its intentions— and the point of informa-
tion concerning the nature of the Publica-
tions Board Reserve Fund are now
unbelievably clear and, moreover, ap-
preciated by me.

I offer my sincerest apologies for any

of this service rather than handing in a
paper as one’s own work. Why can’t
these research papers be used for their
bibliographies?

It is perfectly alright to read an article
in a journal and pick up on its sources to
write a paper. What makes a research
paper from this service so different, or
maybe we shouldn’t read the articles in
journals? Is that what you are saying Dr.
Simpson?

Secondly, why can’t a student just be
interested in a subject and want to read
about it. Is that so hard to believe?

Lastly, what makes you so sure that
sutdents will do as you say? In the Sept.
27 issue of the Ring-tum Phi there was
never any mention of using these
research papers in a fraudulent manner
in the ad itself.

It seems to me that the Ring-tim Phi is
not degrading or immoralizing our com-
munity by running these ads, but rather
you are with your allegations.

What you are saying is that if a student
can buy a research paper and hand it in
as his own, he will. You are dead wrong
Prof. Simpson.

In a community such as ours where
honor is regarded as very important, a
great deal of trust is needed to keep this
atmosphere sustaining.

I do feel sorry for you if you can’t trust
the students more than you say.

Trust is a very great thing to have in
people; you should try it Prof. Simpson, I
guarantee you'll like it.

Freya Members Explain Role

To the editor:

During our traditional walk around the
Hollins campus on September 10th in
honor of the opening of the College, it
became evident that many of the
students visiting Hollins for the evening
did not understand who or what we were.
We realize the disruptive behavior of
many people was due to this lack of
understanding. Therefore, we are
writing you in the hopes that in the future
you can accord us enough respect to let
us walk unhindered.

The name of our organization is Freya,
founded by a group of Hollins women in
1903. It has had varying roles over the
years, but it is now a functional organiza-
tion that deals with the particular pro-
blems and needs within the Hollins com-
munity. The members of Freya remain
anonymous in order to preserve a unified
character. We serve the community
through two funds: the Freya Scholar-
ship Fund and the Freya Emergency
Relief Fund.

Much of what we do for the Hollins
community is behind the scenes and
without any desire for recognition. But to
retain a tangible contact, we walk on
significant occasions, or in order to call

_ attention to an issue or event. When we

walk, we wear black hooded robes to
preserve our anonymity and to promote
the symbol of unity. We also carry
candles as a symbol of hope and faith.
This is a very cursory description of
Freya, but it is sufficient to illustrate to
you how much we are a part of the heart
of Hollins. We welcome you as our guests
and ask only for you to respect our
motives enough to allow us to walk in
peace.
Sincerely,
The Members of Freya,
Hollins College

Health Complaints

Dear Students,

Therefore, I would like the cooperation
of the W&L student body in this matter.
Anyone who has had similar experiences
at the infirmary should contact me at
463-7478, Your cooperation in this matter
will be appreciated. Thank You,

Dean Kalamaras

IFC Pledges *350 To Fund

by John Billmyre

The Interfraternity Council
voted unanimously to donate
$350 to the local United Way
Campaign and decided not to
donate kegs for a_ basketball
benefit concert, during a short
meeting Tuesday evening.

While every representative
voted in favor of donating the
$350 collected by the IFC for
rush violations, not one repre-
sentative supported the basket-
ball team’s effort to get free
kegs from the IFC.

The kegs would have been us-
ed at a fund raising concert fea-
turing the Charlottesville
Allstars and Catfish Hodge.

Sentiment was strong against
supporting the basketball team.

“Canfield doesn’t want
basketball players to pledge
fraternities and has threatened
to blacklist those who do,”’ said
one fraternity president, “‘I
don’t see why we should give
him money.”

The fraternity president ask-
ed not to be named because his
fraternity is rushing a potential
basketball player.

Friday beginning at C hour.

While no noise ordinance vio-
lations were brought up, Farrar
reported that three professors
living in the faculty apartments
had complained about the noise
following parties.

Farrar advised Phi Kappa

and Sigma Alpha Epsilon to
make less noise after parties.

Representatives were also
urged to contact any interested

faculty members about serving
as a faculty adviser to the IFC.

Nominations for the represen-
tative position will be taken at
the next IFC meeting on Oct. 16.

The judicial board heard two
cases following the regular
meeting.

Pi Kappa Alpha was fined $25
for returning pledges to the
freshman quad late after the
first rush date.

Phi Gamma Delta was fined
$25 for parking a car loaded
with freshmen in the quad be-
tween rush dates three and four
and for ungentlemanly conduct.

Surveys
Hungarian

Film

O. W. Riegel, professor
emeritus of journalism at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, is the author of a major
survey of Hungarian film
history, “The Reflective Eye:
Hungarian Cinema,” published
in the recent edition of Osiris, a
magazine which includes both
French and English works in
poetry and prose.

 

A W&L teacher since 1930,
Riegel was head of the depart-
ment of journalism and com-
munications for 34 years. He
came to Washington and Lee
after working for newspapers in
Wisconsin, New York and
Paris.

During his 43 years at the
university he remained a prin-
cipal authority in the field of
propaganda and the media. His
classic work, ‘Mobilizing for
Chaos: The Story of the New
Propaganda,”’ was originally
published in 1934, but its
significance was lasting enough
for it to be called back into print
in 1972 by the New York Times’
book-publishing division.

Party Ban
Leads To

Violence

Plymouth, N.H.—A ban on
keg beer parties at Plymouth
State College prompted a
violent outburst Sunday in
which about 750 students and
visitors threw rocks and bottles
at police before they were sub-
dued by the spray from
firehoses.

A lamp post was torn down
and a number of windows were
broken in buildings near the
campus in the small central
New Hampshire town during
the five-hour long confrontation
while the students chanted,
‘“‘We want kegs! We Want kegs!

Six persons were arrested as
a result of the demonstration
which sent one fireman to the
hospital and injured several
others.

“This is the most destructive
thing I have ever seen,” said
the college’s president, Casper
Marking. Marking said the col-
lege had initiated the ban
against keg beer parties after
New Hampshire raised the
legal drinking age for all
alcoholic beverages from 18 to
20 earlier this year.

year. About 15 members of SAE
and some other students were
throwing sugar packets and be-
ing rowdy.

Although Constine said he has
no complaints with the final
decisions of the boards, some
members of the fraternity feel
they were dealt with too harsh-
ly, pointing out that the incident
occurred before school started
and was in no way a fraternity
function,-and that there were
also members of other frater-
nities present.

‘It should have gone before
Student Control,’ said one
member.

The IFC passes judgment on
all cases involving complaints
against fraternities. Its decision
is subject to automatic review
by SAC, a committee made up
of five students and five faculty
members.

Presently, the members of
SAC are: Syd Farrar, president
of the IFC; Steve Abraham,
president of the student body;
Tim Brooks, head of the Student
Control Committee; Danny
Carucci, head dorm counselor;
and Bill Garrett, president of
the Student Bar Association.
The faculty members are:
Dean of Students Lewis John,
who is chairman of SAC; Assis-
tant Dean of Students H. Robert
Huntley; and professors Gary
Dobbs, Nancy Margand, and
John Merchant. Assistant Dean
of Students Dan Murphy sits on
the board in cases of absence of
a faculty member.

Student Control cases can be
reviewed by SAC either at a stu-
dent’s appeal or when there are
two or more dissenting votes.

A SAC decision can be appeal-
ed to the University Council,
who will set up a seven member
appeal board to hear the case.

On Social Probation

The Interfraternity Council’s

Phi Kappa Psi was convicted
in court earlier this week and
fined $15 for breaking Lexing-

having an amplified sound per-

Canfield said that what he has

freshman should consider care-
fully when joining a fraternity.

He also said he warns fresh-
men about being too impressed
by upperclassmen in a fraterni-
ty.

“Half of them they’ll never
see again, except for parties,”
said Canfield of some upper-
classmen participating in rush.

“TI certainly would not lump
all fraternities together, there
are going to pe good ones and
bad ones when you have 17 or so
on campus,” said Canfield.

Canfield said he gives his
freshmen more counseling than
they get in other sports because
he is “interested in all aspects
of players’ lives.”’

“I don’t think all fraternities
are as interested in the fresh-
men as I am,” said Canfield.

Canfield pointed to Rob
Smitherman as a good example
of a fraternity member who
plays basketball; Smitherman
is a member of Sigma Phi Ep-
Silon. (See Smitherman’s Letter to
the Editor)

 

 
 
    

No More Money

by Joe Scott

After lengthy discussion, the
Executive Committee refused
to allocate additional money to
the Rugby Club, setting their
limit at $250 Monday night.

“We are struggling for our se-
cond generation,’ said Rugby
Club advisor and coach James
W. Worth, referring to the new
freshmen on the team. ‘‘Prices
keep going up all the time,” he
added. ‘Literally every cent we
get determines the future of the
team.”

“Tt’s a question of
economics,’’ said EC Senior
Representative Jay Blumberg.
“It is not a question of
legitimacy.’’ Other EC
members agreed saying that
the money situation this year
was the main factor in their
decision. A motion allocating
$250 from the Student Body
Reserve Fund passed 7-3.

Monthly reports by the Calyx,
Contact and Mock Convention
subcommittees outlined finan-
cial expenditures incurred.

Contact reported few new
transactions and stated their
balance at $1,228.14. Co-
Chairman Channing Hall, when
asked about the nature of the
balance, said he was unsure as
to its origin. The question arose
when EC Vice President Les
Cotter asked the exact amount
in the balance which should
have reverted back to the
Reserve Fund. A portion of the
amount was student body funds.

The Calyx reported expen-
ditures of $10,210 resulting from
three checks, one, a check for
$10,000, going to the Hunter
Publishing Company. Yearbook
collections to date total $6,079
with a current deficit of $4,201.

Calyx Business Manager
John Hamilton said this year’s
book would cost $17.14 per copy,
$6.70 of which comes from the
student tax. Self-generated
funds account for the rest.

Rugby Club Refused

Yearbook Editor John Cole
said only 683 underclassmen
pictures had been taken and
that a make-up day was being
discussed.

Rich Corrigan from the Mock
Convention reported a lone ex-
pense of $50 for copying costs.
He said that the major em-
phasis of their work was being
devoted to fund raising.

‘“‘We have no plans but are
open to suggestions,’’ said Cor-
rigan responding to questioning
concerning a Contact/Mock
Convention joint speaker. ‘‘In
general, we are not looking for
their help.”’

Concerning the Ring-tum
Phi’s attempt to cut costs, EC
President Steve Abraham said
that he talked to William -C.
Washburn, Executive Secre-
tary of Alumni Association,
about possible compensation
for newspaper issues sent to
alumni. Washburn said $250
would stretch his budget to the
limit and he foresaw no possi-
bility to pay more. Washburn
added he was sympathetic to
the paper’s needs.

Abraham noted that Wash-
burn had bought 300 extra
issues Homecoming weekend
for a total expense of $39.

Abraham opened discussion
on a student health box which
would be placed in the in-
firmary for student comments
on their treatment.

The EC unanimously recom-
mended that the suggestion be
given to the Student Health
Committee.

Tuesday’s EC meeting for-
mally approved the budget as
proposed. It was noted that this
year’s SBA amount was based
on a two percent attrition rate
and that last year’s budget did
not take that into account. Also
an attrition rate of three per-
cent was applied to the
undergraduate body.

 

Petitions for four freshmen
class positions and a First Year
Law EC Representative were
filed for the Oct. 15 elections.
Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
until 4 p.m. in the freshmen
dorm area and in Lewis Hall.

The President Speaks Out On Fraternities

University President Robert E.
R. Huntley was interviewed by
Ring-tum Phi News Editor David
Greer about his views on the
fraternity situation at Washinton
and Lee.

This is the first part of an exten-
sive interview. The second part
will appear next week in the Ring-
tum Phi.

Ring-tum Phi: What do you
see as the administration’s role
in fraternity management?

President Huntley: I would
prefer that the University’s role
be largely advisory. By the
“University’’ I would include
the administration and faculty.
That’s traditionally been the
case. I think we should stand
ready and offer and urge the
fraternities to utilize techniques
of management, property con-
trol, and other forms of controll-
ing activities in the fraternities,
by offering, as a backup, techni-
ques in which the university be
helpful.

My own hope would be that
the University does not find it
necessary to engage in an ac-
tive role in management. A
main advantage of the frater-
nities is that they provide
students an opportunity for self-
government, self-management,
self-discipline. That is what the
school stands for and that would
be my preference.

On the other hand, the
University does have an obliga-
tion to see to it that students
have an opportunity for an ef-
fective and helpful living and
social life on campus. Therefore
it is not impossible to imagine a
situation where, should frater-
nities fail to fulfill that function,
the University would have to
fact the question of whether it
should exert some _ stronger
measure of control. Obviously,
the difficulty with that is the
techniques—how does one go
about exerting stronger. control

over fraternities and more im-
portant than that, if you have to
do what in any great degree, it
would, to some extent, under-
mine one of the purposes of hav-
ing fraternities in the first
place?

RtP: Do you think the frater-
nities are governing themselves
in a proper manner now?

Huntley: I think there have
been many times in the recent
past when they have not. Last
year, I undertook to talk with as
many of the then and upcoming
fraternity leaders as I could
find. I hope to do that again this
year, with the view of trying to
implement the thoughts I’ve
just expressed: letting them
know the University’s interest
in how well they are managed,
giving them advice when they
want it about the needs they
might have, and generally urg-
ing them to exercise as high a
degree of responsibility as they
are capable of doing.

I don’t know whether the
period of somewhat sloppy
fraternity management as
characterized in some of the
fraternity houses has _ been
reversed or not.

RtP: In your speech to the
IFC last spring you expressed a
need for greater fraternity-
administration communication,
and asked for responses from
the fraternities. What was the
response? How many respond-
ed?

Huntley: All of the frater-
nities came by to see me follow-
ing that IFC meeting. The
response was generally very
favorable; favorable in terms
of the fraternities wishing to im-
prove both their image in this
community and the actual
operation of the houses. I was
encouraged by the response.
Whether there will be any
follow-through remains to be
seen.

Rtp: What is the faculty’s role
in fraternity management?

Huntley: The university’s by-
laws entrust to the faculty
ultimate authority over all mat-
ters involving student conduct
and student organizations with
the sole exception of the honor
system. That’s a somewhat
legalistic point of view, certain-
ly. Another way of looking at it
is: What role does the faculty
actually play in such gover-
nance? Again, I think the facul-
ty’s attitude over the past has
been that it is best if fraternity
activities are governed effec-
tively by student organizations.
I think that continues to be the
faculty’s hope—that the
organizations will want and be
able to govern the fraternities
effectively. But the faculty cer-
tainly has the power, if it choses
to exercise it, to order the ad-
ministration to take closer
supervision of fraternity life.
They have not really done so at
this point.

 

 

RtP: What do you see as the
purpose of fraternities at
Washington and Lee?

Huntley: They obviously
serve a social purpose. In a
small community like this, they
provide another dimension to
the social life of the students
and the living experiences that
are available to them. They pro-
vide an alternative that would
not otherwise exist on this cam-
pus.

Another thing to be noted
there is that whether or not one
had fraternities, it’s likely that
there would be, as I guess there
are, other groups within the stu-
dent body who would band
together for social activities
and for fellowship.

Fraternities, therefore, are
probably a natural outgrowth of
any group of people that is as
large even as our student body.
In that sense, you might think of
them as essentailly a necessary
growth of any student body.

Apart from that, fraternities

have served purposes beyond
merely providing young men
here with a level of fellowship
and friendship of a smaller
group than our student body
would represent. There have
been many occasions in the past
when fraternities have
stimulated the students who are
in them to achieve in a higher
level, both in curricular and
non-curricular matters, than
they otherwise would have
done. That’s what they ought to
be able todo.

It would be a sad thing if all of
one’s friends were simply folks
who were only interested in
drinking bouts on Saturday
night. That would be a sunder
substitute for friendship. If
fraternities are supposed to pro-
ffer the opportunity for close
friendships to the members, the
fraternities should render the
kind of friendship that has a
deeper dimension. And I think
often they have done that, and
sometimes they have not.

Society Returns —

by John Wells

The Washington and Lee Film
Society, again under the leader-
ship of faculty advisor Carren
Kaston, begins its second year
with a showing of Francois
Truffaut’s color film The Man
Who Loved Women on Friday
and Saturday.

The organization has ten-
tatively been granted $600 from
the Executive Committee. The
Society offers recent films free
of charge to campus and local
communities, and is especially
interested in obtaining films
available to patrons in larger
cities, but which don’t often

reach Lexington.

Following both of the 8 p.m.
showings of The Man Who Lov-
ed Women, a 1977 French com-
edy, there will be an open recep-
tion at the Washington and Lee
law school. At the reception, the
Society’s members will give in-
formation concerning this
year’s program and seek sug-
gestions for the series. They
will also be seeking student,
faculty, and community spon-
sorship to help pay for the films.

Also slated for the Fall Term
are French director Louis
Malle’s Kaspar Hauser (1975),
filmed by German director

Werner Herzog, on Dec. 7-8. All
movies will be shown in class-
room ‘‘C’’ of Lewis Hall.

Last year’s program included
Bergman’s Cries and Whispers,
Fassbinder’s Chinese Roulette,
Welles’ Falstaff, and a double
bill of Running Fence and
Memories of the Under-
developed.

Ms. Kaston is assisted by Jay
Diesing, president, and Mario
Pellicciaro, who is faculty co-
sponsor. She advises that any
comments or _ suggestions
should be directed to her at
W&L ext. 367, or Mr. Diesing at
463-2750, or to either of them at
the receptions.

(Mime )

The acclaimed Mime Theatre
of the Warsaw Chamber Opera
Company returns to Washing-
ton and Lee University’ this
Saturday evening (Oct. 13) for a
new series of pantomime pro-
ductions. Curtain time is 8 p.m.
for the show, which will take
place in the Troubadour
Theatre. There is no admission
charge. .

This marks the third visit by
the mimes to Washington and
Lee since their debut on the
campus in October 1976. Lee
Kahn, director of the University
Theatre, made the initial con-
tact with the group during a trip
to Poland — resulting in their
first American tour. The troupe
then returned to W&L early in
1977 as resident artists for
several weeks, under a visiting
scholars program established
by the late Arthur Graham
Glasgow in 1959 to promote the
creative arts at the university.

(Opera)

Leontyne Price, the world-
famous soprano of the
Metropolitan Opera, will be the
featured soloist with the New
York Philharmonic in its next
broadcast over WLUR-FM,
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s radio station, at 91.5 on the
dial. The performance is
scheduled for Sunday (Oct. 14)

 

at6p.m..

The broadcast will feature
Price in arias from a number of
famous operas, including Ver-
di’s “Il Trovatore,’’ Barber’s
“Antony and Cleopatra,’’ and
Puccini’s ‘‘Tosca.’’ In addition,
the orchestra — under the
direction of Zubin Mehta — will
play Mozart’s Symphony No. 40.

(Exhibition)

An exhibition exploring the
theories of color interaction as
espoused by artist Josef Albers
will be on view at Washington
and Lee University beginning
Monday (Oct. 8) and continuing
through Oct. 26. The exhibition
is sponsored jointly by the
Virginia Museum and W&L’s
Department of Fine Arts, and
may be seen in duPont Gallery
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
weekdays.

The film is full of truisms and

amusing but by no means pro-
found. A fun film.

 

This Tuesday, the sixteenth,
in Reid 203 the Journalism De-

Buster Keaton’s classic 1927
film The General. It’s the story
of a southern railroad engineer
who loves both his southern
belle and his locomotive. In the

Evaluation

L by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Once again the W&L football team lost. It was a
valiant effort—but unfortunately—in vain.

Despite losing their fourth game of the year, the
Generals did show signs of improvement. There were
even flashes of offensive punch.

The highlight of the afternoon for W&L was provid-
ed by none other than slotback Chris Leiser—who has
been the Generals’ major (only?) offensive weapon
this season. Leiser scored W&L’s first touchdown on
an 84-yard kick-off return. Two weeks ago against
Centre, Leiser won the game with a 93-yard kickoff
return. Against Fordham, the junior speedster caught
five passes for 144 yards and one TD, He also rushed
six times for 21 yards and returned two punts and four
kick-offs for a total of 103 yards. In all, Leiser ac-
counted for 268 yards—over 50 percent of the team’s
total for the afternoon.

However, Leiser had some help. W&L sophomore
quarterback Jim Wenke played his best game of the
season, completing 12 of 18 passes for 185 yards and
one TD. What’s amazing is that Wenke did not play
the entire game. He switched in and out with
freshman Chris Cavalline, depending on the situation.
Cavalline came in on running downs and Wenke came
in on passing situations. This same concept was used
a few years ago by Bear Bryant down at Alabama
with Jeff Rutledge and Richard Todd running the
wishbone.

Speaking of the wishbone, W&L tried using it
against Fordham—and that’s probably not a bad
idea. The Generals have had offensive problems this
year and a change to the wishbone could be just what
they need. With Stew Atkinson and Leiser at the
halfback positions, they would have enough speed to
go to the outside. The difficult tasks would be training
a quarterback to run the option with precision. But all
of W&L’s quarterbacks are underclassmen and there
is plenty of time for them to learn.

Despite W&L’s improved offense, offense alone
does not win football games. The defense—which has
played spectacularly all season long—once again
played well. Unfortunately, not well enough. Ford-
ham scored two touchdowns in the second quarter to
take a 14-0 halftime lead. Their first score was on a 64-
yard screen pass and their second on an eight-play 47-
yard drive with two minutes left in the half. Also, For-
dham rushed for 229 yards, including a 102-yard effort

Still, the Generals must be commended for their'ef-

fort. Down 14-0 at the half, they did not quit. Scoring
two touchdowns on their first two possessions of the
second half, the Generals battled back to cut Ford-
ham’s lead to 14-12. Leiser’s stunning run and a five-
yard dash by Atkinson kept them in the game, only to
fall behind again and eventually lose 27-15.

What seems to be the Generals’ problem is that they
cannot put 60 minutes of solid football together. When
the defense is playing well, the offense is making
mistakes. And when the offense is moving the ball,
the defense isn’t up to par.

True, as we said last week, the team is young and
still learning. They will make mistakes. But it is also
true that the team under coach Gary Fallon seems
more inspired than in past years. The team never
seems to quit and always seems to come back. We can
only wait and hope for the day when there will be no
need to come back—only to stay ahead.

Fordham Dumps W&L;
Record Falls To 1-4

by Dale Park
The W&L football team’s
record dropped to 1-4 last Satur-
day after losing a tough game to
the Fordham Rams, 27-15.
A Homecoming crowd of 4,751
watched the most impressive

offensive effort the Generals .

have shown this season.

“Early in the first half, the
defense did a good job of stop-
ping the Fordham offense,”’
said Head Coach Gary Fallon.
But with 3:53 left in the half,
Ram quarterback Vince Con-
nolly hit his wide receiver
Roger McGloin with a screen
pass that appeared to be going
nowhere. McGloin was able to
break free however, going 64
yards to score Fordham’s first
touchdown. ‘‘We had the screen
well contained but were unable
to bring McGloin down,”’ said
Fallon. The conversion was
good and Fordham led 7-0.

The Rams _ scored again
before the half ended. Ford-
ham’s quarterback Connolly
brought his team 50 yards in
seven plays before connecting
with Jim Pacheco from six
yards out. The conversion was
good and, with only :31 left in
the half, the Rams led 14-0.

In the first half W&L could
manage only 78 yards total of-
fense to Fordham’s 230 yards.
Yet the second half prove ‘to be
different.

Taking the ball on his own 16-

yard line, the Generals’ '
sophomore quarterback Jim
Wenke threw a screen pass to
junior slotback Chris Leiser.
This screen play also appeared
to be dead. Yet Leiser slipped
away from the Ram’s defense,
racing 84 yards for the score.

“‘Leiser made an outstanding
run on the play, the key to which
was some good down field
blocking,’ said Fallon. An
aborted point-after try turned
into an attempted two-point
conversion scramble which fail-
ed, and the score stood at 14-6
early in the third quarter.

Having stopped Fordham,
W&L took over on their own 6
yard line. Behind some deft
misdirection plays engineered
by Wenke, the Generals moved
the ball 94 yards, capped off by
senior tailback Stewart Atkin-
son’s five-yard touchdown run.
Yet the two-point conversion
again failed, and W&L trailed
14-12.

This was as close as the
Generals were to come. The
W&L defense has had a tenden-
cy this season to be scored on in
the closing minutes of a period
after playing solid defense
beforehand.

This became evident as the
Rams immediately countered
the Generals’ score, going 64
yards in nine plays. Fordham’s
Pacheco carried the ball the
final six yards for the

‘touchdown with only :12 left in

the third period.

In the fourth quarter,
freshman Bill Devine, Offen-
sive Player of the Game last
week against Macon, again hit
on a field goal attempt, this
time from 25 yards out as a
W&L drive stalled on the Rams
seven-yard line.

For the moment, the Ramzy
led 21-15. Controlling the ball for
5:34, Fordham marched steadi-
ly down to the W&L two-yard
line. Ram running back Craig
Miller plunger in for the score
with only :18 left in the game;
the point-after failed, for a final
score of 27-15.

The Generals gained 304
yards on the day, led by Wenke
who completed 12 of 18 passes
for 185 yards and a touchdown.

Again this week, the defense
was led by the play of defensive
end Tom Noble. Noble re-
covered a Fordham fumble ear-
ly in the game to go along with
his fine play in the previous
games.

Next week the Generals play
away against Hampden-
Sydney. Fallon described
Sydney as a ‘‘quick team that
plays together well on defense
and that throws a lot of different
alignments at its opponents.”’
Sydney finished second in the
ODAC last season and has 14 of

_ last year’s 22 starters _re-

turning.

Varsity Beats Alums 19-10

by Bill Whalen

The past and present of
Washington & Lee lacrosse met
last Sunday and for the first
time since 1975, the present
came out on top. Aided by seven
first quarter goals, the varsity
lacrosse team rolled to a 19-10
win over the lacrosse alumni.

The victory—the varsity’s se-
cond in the five year series—
was a_ hard-played, well-
enjoyed game for the players on
both sides. ‘“‘We had a lot of fun
and that’s what this game is
about,”’ said varsity coach Jack
Emmer.

The varsity opened the scor-
ing less than a minute into the
game and soon controlled the
contest for the rest of the after-
noon. Lightning-quick goals by
midfielders John Kemp and
Scott McLam and another by at-
tackman Mike Schuler posted
the varsity to an early 3-0 lead.

Another goal by midfielder
and co-captain John Hooper and
Kemp’s second tally of the
period increased the lead to 5-0.
The alumni were able to score
twice in the first quarter, but
goals by attackmen Pere
Roberts and Stu Rienhoff kept
the varsity five goals up.

Jim Lewis, who played on the
varsity team 21 years ago, was
replaced by Charlie Brown in
the alumni goal for the second
quarter. Brown fared better
than his teammate, allowing on-
ly three shots to get by him.

Attackman Jay Foster sand-
wiched two goals around
another goal by Roberts to give
the varsity an insurmountable

10-2 lead. Sam Englehart (class
of 73) later scored for the alum-
ni, cutting the margin to 10-3 at
halftime.

At this point, the game
became a chance for the varsity
to experiment with different

lines while the alumni could ~

showcase their talents.

The third quarter was
highlighted by the opposing
goalies. In goal for the varsity
was Bob Clements, All-
American goalie 1979. Tending
the nets for the alumni was Bill
Clements, All-American goalie
1950—Bob’s father.

The elder Clements was given
a rude welcome from varsity
middie George Santos. Santos
pumped in three goals within
three minutes to widen the gap
to 13-3.

Goals by Schuler, Foster and

middie Steve Herold further in-
creased the margin to 16-3. The
alumni were able to cut the lead
to 1646 before the end of the
third quarter, on goals by Jeff
Fritz, Brown (who was an All-

- American goalie in 1978) and

Charlie Stieff (class of ‘78).

The alumni outscored the var-
sity in the fourth quarter. Goals
by Roberts, Reinhoff and mid-
die Chris Cahill closed out the
varsity scoring attack.

Though the opposition was not
the same as a regular season
opponent, Emmer found much
to be pleased with. “We were
very competitive,” said “Em-
mer. “It’s obvious that we'll
have 32 solid players on our
roster when the season starts.”

The varsity will be stacked
with plenty of. midfielders.

Water Polo 8-0

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
continued its winning ways last
weekend with five victories
over conference competition to
boost their season record to 8-0.

The wins came in the first
half of the Southern Water Polo
League Tournament held at the
University of Richmond. The
second half of the tournament
will be played at W&L October
19-20 when the Generals will
meet defending champs, Rich-
mond, for the first time this
season.

In their first game of the tour-
nament, the Generals faced
East Carolina University, one
of the teams Coach Page
Remillard had tagged as this
season’s ‘‘tough competition.”
W&L won the contest 14-10.

The following game _ was
something of a breather for the
W&L squad as they defeated
Lynchburg handily, 21-3, to
complete Friday evening’s
games.

Saturday morning, the
Generals began by knocking off
Georgia Southern, 9-6, and then
doing away with George
Washington University by a 9-5
score.

The W&L team rounded out
the weekend with an easy win
over James Madison. The final
score of that game was W&L 15,
JMU5.

Despite the apparent success
of the water polo team in the
tournament, Remillard was not
pleased with his team’s per-
formance. ‘‘I was disappointed
in our lack of execution, lack of
aggressiveness, and our lack of
ability to put teams away. We
need to develop a killer in-
stinct,’’ said the coach.

Remillard feels that to con-
tinue winning, his team must be
able to handle the ball better
and react better to game situa-
tions. The team must improve
in these areas if they are to
have a shot at the Southern
League championship.

Individual standouts of the
tournament were Biff Martin—
who led W&L with 19 goals—and
Drew Pillsbury, whose constant
movement made him a
dangerous offensive threat,
while his tough defense was
responsible for several steals
and turnovers.

This weekend, the water polo
Generals will have another op-
portunity to test their skills at
the Brown University Invita-

tional in Providence, RI. W&L
will be competing against
Brown, Chicago Loyola, and
MIT. The first two of these
teams are among the top 10 in
the nation and are serious con-
tenders for the national cham-
pionships.

In Remillard’s words, the
Generals will be playing ‘‘out of
our class,’’ but he still has hopes
of a good showing. In practice
this week, the team is concen-
trating on game situations ‘‘in
an attempt to reinstitute the ag-
gressive style of play which was
lacking this past weekend,”’
said Remillard.

If this aggressiveness can be
regained and combined with a
disciplined offense, W&L should
perform well this weekend.
Remillard feels that, consider-
ing the quality of the competi-
tion, one win would be ‘‘ex-
cellent,” and two wins would
prove that the Generals are
ready to take on arch-rival
Richmond. “If we win three,”
said Remillard, “they better
batten down the hatches and put
out small-craft warnings,
because. we have arrived.”
That, however, is a very big
sof”.

Booted, Booted... Tied

by Chris Sisto

The varsity soccer team fell
upon hard times last week as
they dropped two games and
saw their record drop to 2-4. The
Generals lost a close 2-1 game
last Wednesday to Davidson
College and a 5-0 Homecoming
defeat to Averett College last
Sunday.

Against Davidson, the
Generals could not hold on to an
early 1-0 lead. The goal came in
the first half on a shot by Bill
Brown. Davidson came back
with two goals, one in each half,
to finish off the Generals.

Coach Rolf Piranian was not
totally displeased with his
team’s play, however, ‘‘We
were very competitive with a
team of Davidson’s caliber.’’
Davidson is a Division I team.

Talking about Sunday's loss,
Piranian expressed more disap-
pointment. ‘‘The loss to Averett
was a combination of them hav-

‘ing a few superior players (four
from Finland) and our not ex-
ecuting very well,” said Pira-
nian.

The offense could not pose
any strong scoring threats and
did not get on track all day. The
-Generals had only nine shots on
goal, compared to Averett’s 19.
Piranian went through three
goalies but still could not stop
the blowout.

The Washington & Lee soccer
team travelled to Radford Col-
lege and battled to a scoreless
tie in a game played Tuesday
afternoon.

The Generals were led by a
stingy defense and freshman
goalie, Rudy Halcomb, who
turned in the shutout. Halcomb
has apparently replaced Kevin
Carney as the Generals’
number-one goaltender. When
asked if Halcomb would con-
tinue to start in the W&L goal,
Coach Rolf Piranian said, ‘He

Ht

played well against Radford
and we have to judge by per-
formance.”’

Piranian said that his game-
plan called for a “‘rope-a-dope”’
tactic of laying back on defense
and waiting for just the right

moment to explode offensively.

Piranian was apparently
pleased with his team’s defer.
sive effort after being blown out

5-0 by Averett on Sunday. This

strong defensive effort

precedes a three-game homes-
tand in which the Generals will
face Navy, Mary Washington
' and Roanoke.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Pr:

Pass-Fail

The Pass-Fail grading system at Washington and
Lee is a productive and viable option. It encourages
students to choose a course or examine an academic
discipline that might not otherwise be considered if a
grade were involved. Pass-fail may be one of the few
incentives left for an increasingly vocation-minded
student body to experience a true liberal arts educa-
tion.

But we feel that pass-fail should be a private alter-
native. There is simply no reason for a professor to
know which of his students have elected to take his
course on a pass-fail basis. We are not calling into
question the objectivity of W&L’s professors. We
merely feel that it would be an improvement for pass-
fail to be a matter only between the registrar and the
student—as it is at many other academic institutions
across the country.

Wilson Bridge Rip-Off

Were you one of the lucky few who made it to the
football game without losing your life’s savings? I
tried to make it across Wilson Bridge without spend-
ing a cent, but I couldn’t. Coming down the steps from
the gym parking lot, I was confronted by several
husky lacrosse players—each trying to unload their
ballcaps at $5 a piece. How could I say no—especially
when it’s a 30-foot drop off the bridge.

And speaking of your ‘‘Catch-22” situations, there
were all those high schools girls selling programs at a
dollar each. If I had played my cards right, I could
have escaped only $1 poorer. But since I had just
spent five bucks, it was obvious that I could afford a
measly program. So how could I say no?

By this time I thought I was home free. But nooo....
I ran into the basketball team and one of their raffles.
I ended up spending several dollars. Even though
each ticket was $1, I had to buy several to stand a
chance of winning. Once again, how could I say no? I
couldn’t pretend to be a cheapskate—especially with
a program in my hand anda balleap on my head.

Now I had only 20 yards to go, but not without
dishing out more money. First, some frat-rat was
hawking these silly posters of some fool who is sup-
posed to be a “‘preppie.” I personally find these
humorless because I have to see 1,000 guys just like
him on the Colonnade every morning.

Only 10 yards from the stadium, I had to buy
several grain cups. I think I finally made it to my seat
by the second-half kickoff.

I wish I could have bought a hot dog and a coke, but
I was wiped out after crossing the bridge.

I live in a stacked deck.

Persiflage

An Outlet For Aggression

There are few more exciting activities on
campus than I.M. football.

Although most people might not understand
the exultation one-can feel in accumulating
bruises, ‘‘tough”’ football is more than just a
masochist’s utopia. It provides an outlet for
aggression and enables we Walter Mittys of
ex-high school jockdom to really believe that
NFL films should send a camera crew up to
the practice fields.

First comes the pre-game ritual. You must
prepare to willingly slam your body into other
human beings, at full speed, without the
benefit of pads.

Unless you are some kind of simian psycho-
path this process calls for some very serious
mind alteration. I personally find that
Budweiser and Ted Nugent do the trick.

Letter To Editor

Then there is the actual playing of the
game. Here is your chance to show that pro-
fessor how you feel about that little paper he
assigned you over Homecoming, to let that
girl know how foolish she was in preferring
The Last Convertible to your company, or just
to prove to yourself that a 1.9 grade-point
average is not the sum worth of your college
experience.

It really doesn’t matter if you play well, or
if you win or lose. A few beers and a fertile
imagination can always correct any deficien-
cies.

What is important is that you’ve been able
to clear out all those nasty, evil feelings
without going to jail, or please note, breaking
the Honor Code.

No Basketball Blacklist

Dear Editor,

I was shocked to read of the
accusation a certain fraternity
president made against Coach

sons for

Canfield in last week’s Ring- one.
For a decade there have
always been basketball players

‘tum Phi: “Canfield doesn’t
want basketball players to
pledge fraternities, and has
threatened to blacklist those
who do,’’ said this uninformed
person.

This statement could not be
further from the truth.

This is my third year in the
basketball program.

As a freshman I pledged and
subsequently joined a fraterni-
ty. At no time was I told not to
join a frat or threatened to be
“‘blacklisted’”” by Coach Can-
field.

I have obviously not been
‘“‘blacklisted,’’ for I have
started for the team much of
my first two seasons.

Coach Canfield does suggest
that the freshman prospects
‘‘look over the situation’”’ during
rush, not get caught up in rush
and join the first house they see.

The IFC seems to agree with
this philosophy, having imposed
the rule of pledging until after
the fourth rush date. Coach
Canfield is just trying to help
the freshman clear up some of
the chaos of rush.

While I understand the IFC’s
opposition to donating kegs for
a fundraising concert, I see cost

and precedent as the major rea-
opposition.
‘‘blacklisting’’ as a reason is not
just a poor excuse, it is a wrong

(Outdoors:
Fall Colors

by Jim Feinman

The Blue Ridge Mountains
will be ablaze with color this
week as the peak of the fall col-
oration approaches. Area out-
doorsmen will be able to enjoy
hiking, camping, fishing and
hunting amidst the brilliant red
and yellow of autumn.

Blue Ridge Parkway rangers
predict that the color peak will
occur around October 16 if
seasonal winds and rain co-
operate. Rangers report that
the above average rainfall this
year has brought out thicker
foliage than usual and, combin-
ed with the recent cool weather,
should provide a spectacular
season for fall color.

The Blue Ridge Parkway will
be a good choice for students
who wish to spend an afternoon
driving through the mountains
to enjoy the scenery. The park-
way is easily accessible by
following. Route 60 east from
Lexington. It is recommended
that students attempt to visit
the parkway during the week if
possible as it is a popular—and
crowded—spot on weekends.

Students interested in hiking
and camping will find the Ap-
palachian Trail a good choice
this weekend and next. The trail
can be reached from the Route
60-Blue Ridge Parkway in-
tersection and where Route 501
crosses the James River. Both
of these segments of the trail
are interesting and clearly
marked.

If the recent (two days!) dry
spell will hold up the streams
and rivers should recede to pro-
vide some good fall fishing.
Bass will be hitting on small
streams and on the Maury and
James Rivers. Look for a few
large (10-20 lbs.) muskies to be
taken from the James in the
vicinity of Buchanan.

Squirrel season is open in
Rockbridge until October 13.

There were 18 middies on last
Sunday's roster and Emmer
mentioned that there are 15
more in the freshmen class.

In Sunday's contest, the mid-
dies provided i1 of the
Generals’ 19 scores. Santos led
the seven scoring midfielders
with a hat-trick. On the day, 10
different players scored for the
varsity.

The goalie position also look-
ed strong. Sophomore Ware
Palmer started the game and
allowed only three goals in the
first half. Clements played the
second half and despite allow-
ing seven goals, made several
sharp passes downfield to
breaking middies.

Clubs and Organizations

Please check one of the following; you are:
A) Anti-nuke

B) Illiterate

C) Impotent

D) Stoned

If you picked A), then you should definitely
read on. If you picked B), C), or D), then
you're obviously a typical Washington and
Lee student. If you picked none of the above,
then read on anyway. This is to announce, as
you may have guessed by now, STAND, or
Students Totally Against Nuclear Develop-
ment.

The name is interchangable, but the pur-
pose behind the formation of W&L’s first Anti-
Nuclear group is clear: Phase ’em out, shut
’em down, and let’s get on with the solar age.

Many universities have active student
groups who have investigated the issues, the
alternatives, and the consequences of nuclear
energy, and have decided to work against the
further development of nukes.

Student groups and the grass roots com-
munity movement have proven that united
citizen action can make a difference.

Our group will focus on projects such as let-
ter campaigns, learning the art of non-violent
civil disobedience, participating in local

 

rallies, raising funds for national and local
lobbying efforts, and most importantly edu-
cating ourselves about the real potentials of
solar energy and conservation, and the
economic international, and medical pitfalls
(to put it lightly) associated with our present
proposed reliance upon nuclear energy.

Our first meeting will be held Monday at 8
p.m. in room 203 of Reid Hall.

An eight minute film made by two W&L stu-
dents who went to the recent anti-nuke rally
sponsored by the Musicians Union for Safe
Energy in New York City will be shown to
help launch the group with purpose. And
remember what Captain Radiation says:

“Better active today than radioactive
tomorrow!”’

Student Convicted Sat. In
Open Honor Hearing

by Randy Smith

A former Washington and Lee
senior was found guilty of an
honor offense last Saturday
after a lengthy student body
hearing in Lee Chapel.

After deliberating for over
two hours, a jury of 12 students
found the defendant guilty of
cheating on a pop quiz last spr-
ing.

The penalty for committing a
violation of W&L’s_ honor
system is expulsion.

An open student body hearing
is the appealate process after
the defendant has been found
guilty of an honor infraction ina

private hearing before the stu-
dent body Executive Co ittee.
Student body hearings are
open only to members of the
W&L community. Because .the
results of public honor hearings
are omitted from the student’s
record, and because the circula-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi ex-
tends beyond the boundaries of
the campus, the names of the

participants in the trial will not

be reported.

The defendant was accused of
cheating on a pop quiz worth
less than two percent of his final
grade in the course, according
to the testimony. Two students
were eyewitnesses to the alleg-
ed cheating incident. The

In Apparent Suicide

A Washington and Lee

Hiland Newton Moore, 20, of
Lynchburg, was the son of Mrs.
George H. Fralin Jr., 600 Trents
Ferry Rd., and of the late H.N.

Rockbridge County Medical
Examiner Dr. F. A. Fedderman
ruled the death as suicide. The
time of death was tentatively
thought to have been between 10
p.m. and midnight Tuesday.
The body was ‘found shortly
before noon yesterday.

fraternity,) according to
figures supplied by Lewis G.
John, Dean of Students at the
university. In addition, 15 up-
perclassmen joined fraternity

ranks this month, bringing the

total figure up to 240 pledges.

Dean John noted that the
“rush yield” was down slightly
from last year’s figure of 65 per-
cent. No official reason has
been given for the decline;
however, several fraternity
spokesmen have pointed to a
new Interfraternity Council
rule as a possible source. Under
the new rushing procedure,
freshmen may not affiliate with
a fraternity until the third week
of the program. Previously,
pledging was allowed after one
week’s time. With the new
system in force, freshmen ap-
peared to move with greater
caution into the fraternity fold,
said a number of student
observers.

 

defense rested on the testimony
of the accused and a polygraph
expert.

The EC prosecuted the
former student, having already
found him guilty of cheating ina
private honor hearing. The pro-
secution presented ‘‘expert
testimony”’ to cast doubt on the
accuracy of polygraphs to
detect lies; the expert
documented a number of ways
to ‘‘beat the machine’’ and said
polygraphs are 65-75 percent ac-
curate in criminal detection.

In contrast, the defense
presented the defendant’s hired
polygraph examiner who said
that the machines are 90-98 per-
cent accurate in detection.

(Polygraph examinations are
admissible in Virginia courts if
both the prosecution and
defense agree to enter it into the
record before the test is ad-
ministered. )

There were great discrepen-
cies between the testimony of
the two eyewitnesses and the
defendant’s account of the inci-
dent. Both eyewitnesses were

Car, Other Items
Reported Stolen

by Sam Campbell

A student’s automobile,
stolen Oct. 8 from in front of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house, has been recovered.

The car, belonging to junior
Andy Pick, was returned to
Lexington from a spot east of
Lexington on US Route 60,
where it was recovered. The
keys had been left in the car at
the time of the theft but were
missing when the car was
found.

Pick said he felt the police
handled the case well, but warn-
ed students to be careful.

‘“‘Burglars are getting more
aggressive,” he said. ‘“‘So much
stuff is getting stolen now, and
this was the biggest. I know now
that people should lock up their
cars.”’

Other robberies

Arobbery was reported at the
Sigma Phi Epsilon house.
Robert H. Forsyth told police
that his wallet, containing a
driver’s license, voter registra-
tion card, several ID cards,
meal tickets, and a small sum
of money was taken from his
room on the third floor of the
fraternity house on the after
noon of Oct. 22 while he was
sleeping.

No arrests have been made in
the case.

Another student had his car
battery stolen Thursday night
in the university parking lots in
front of Red Square.

The car, a 1966 Volkswagon
owned by senior Paul Nathan
lost the six volt battery at 2:15
a.m., the time shown on the
car’s electric clock. Replace-
ment costs total $40.45.

 

Survey Reveals Where Grades Are

 

by David Greer

Chemistry a gut course? You've got to be kid-

ding!

But more A’s are given in chemistry than
any other grade— 35 percent, to be exact.

According to a fact book compiled by the
university for the Fall Alumni Conference,
the most frequently received grade at W&L is
B. Of all the grades received last fall and
winter terms, 35 percent were B’s.

The Ring-tum Phi surveyed 16 depart-
ment’s grades for last year and found what
each department’s most frequently received
grade was. This guide will not be useful to
students looking for easy courses, though, as
grade frequency is not a measure of how
much work is required to get that grade. Ask
any pre-med.

The department that gave A’s most fre-
quently was Military Science, with 60 percent
of its grades being A’s. This was followed by
Drama at 57 percent, Music winter term at 46
percent, Chemistry at 35 percent, and Math
fall term at 26 percent.

Most of the courses were B courses. 47 per-

cent of the Music department’s grades fall
term were B’s, with the following courses in
decending frequency: Philosophy 45 percent,
Sociology 43 percent, History 41 percent, Art
40 percent, Journalism 39 percent,
Psychology 38 percent, Politics winter term
37 percent, Religion 36 percent, Accounting
winter term 36 percent and Math winter term
34 percent.

Of the courses giving C’s most frequently,
Politics winter term was the leader, with 38
percent of its grades: being C. The other
courses which had as their most frequently
bestowed grade the letter that starts the word
‘“Commerce”’:: Administration—36 percent,
Economics—34 percent, Accounting—fall
term—31 percent, and English—25 percent.

Only one department, Accounting (winter
term), had more F’s than A’s; 13 percent of
the total grades given in that department
were F’s while 8 percent were A's.

During Spring Term, B was still the most
frequently received grade at 35 percent of the
total, but A’s were received 31 percent of the
time while during the fall and winter A’s were
received 20 and 23 percent respectively.

Pres. Huntley On Fraternities

This is the last of a series of inter-
views with W&L President Robert
E.R. Huntley. Ring-tum) Phi
News Editor David Greer inter-
viewed Huntley in September
about the fraternity system at
W&L. This article focuses on the
fraternities’ problems with noise,
conduct, and house maintenance.

RtP: What is the relative
shape of traternities today com-
pared to tive years ago?

Huntley: That's a very short
time span, and I am not sure
there has been any significant
change in the fraternity system
in a five-year term. I'm not
aware of any major deteriora-
tion in that time period or any
major improvement in it. Over
a longer time period, I'd say
there's been a_ deterioration
that probably began ten or so
years ago.

1 don't Know all the causes of
it. But I think whatever the
causes, - the changes” or
deterioration are manifested in
attitudes of less responsibility
for fraternity property. fre-
quently lack of concern for the
kind of conduct that occurs in
fraternities, and about the im-
pact of the conduct on the sen-
sibilities and the rights of those
who live near fraternities.

More important, more basic
than any of these, it seems to
me that many fraternities, not
all of them, I'm sure, but many
of them do not pay much atten-
tion to the deeper dimensions of
fellowship or friendship.

Now, that’s not to imply that
fraternities were ever perfect —
they certainly never were. No
human institution ever is. There
always were, examples and
episodes of fraternity
mismanagement and miscon-

duct and irresponsibilty that
came to the attention of the ad-
ministration.

The issue is not new. The oc-
casion for discussion of it is not
new. But I'm inclined to think
that there have been in the last
ten years less of the kind of
qualitively desirable fraternity

There have also been dif-
ficulties that fraternities in the
past might not have had. The
financing of the food service in
fraternities is more difficult
than it has ever been. It seems
to me that’s an area the Univer-
sity ought to try to help them in
any way we can.

‘““,.many fraternities do not pay much
attention to the deeper dimensions
of fellowship and friendship.”’

 

fellowship on the campus than
there was in a period, say, 25
years ago.

RtP: Have the efforts of the
IFC and students improved the
shape of the fraternities?

Huntley: It does appear to me
that there have been im-
provements. There are varying
views about that, depending on
whom you ask. I certainly have
made no personal inspection of
them so | am relying largely on
views that others have express-
ed.

An alumni committee that
was asked by the Alumni Board
of Directors to look into the
fraternity plant situation
reported last year that it has
seen definite improvement over
the last two years. The Alumni
still express great concern
about the condition of some of
the fraternities, but they did
note they have seen some
significant improvements.

I'm aware that some of the
houses are very old and have
not seen significant renovation
in a long time. Nevertheless,
that’s no excuse; for the house
that's the oldest and the least
renovated is probably the one
that requires the greatest care.
I doubt if lack of major renova-
tion is the basic problem.

After all that is said, there
has been a deterioration in the
houses, in the plant, that is not
merely explained by the houses
being old, or that the {66d ser-
vice is hard to come by. But I do
believe there has been'some im-
provement. When you'te living
in the middle of a trend it’s hard
to know you are.

RtP: Last year the frater-
nities made massive efforts to
cooperate with the town in
regards to the noise ordinance,
which, granted, is a law and is
being violated but is considered
unreasonable.

Huntley: There certainly
were efforts to cooperate; how
massive they were might be a
difference in perspective be-
tween the fraternity members
and the people who live in town.
I don't know if the ordinance is
unreasonable, but there cer-
tainly is more than one side to
the question.

The constant noise level that
has eminated from fraternities
for a number of years has
reached a point where it has ex-
hausted the toleration level of
Lexington citizens. Whenever
that occurs, you can expect
some reaction. This is a small
community, which is largely
very tolerant of the activities of
students.

Lacrosse Team

Pushing A Bed To

Most veterans of the Road
Trip know that the dreary drive
home is a task no one likes to
face but usually must. Hotels
are too expensive and overnight
lodging at girl's schools is often
difficult to arrange.

I think what you're really
dealing with is the desire of peo-
ple who live in close juxtaposi-
tion to each other to get along
together. That requires some
give and take on both sides.

RtP: Do you think frater-
nities have made enough effort?

Huntley: I think some made
that effort last year. Of course,
I'm aware that even if a frater-
nity makes an effort there may
be some who may not, and those
who don't tend to be the ones
who are thought of as being all
fraternities. One fraternity can
affect the image of them all.
That's just a fact of life. It’s just
as unfortunate fact that one or
two fraternities, behaving in a
way that as seen by those living
around it as_ being
unreasonably, will affect the
images and hence the privileges
of all the others. Just as
students will tend to associate
with the community of Lex-
ington its most unreasonable
members so the community will

But nobody has looked into

tend to see fraternities in terms
of its least responsible
members.

Rtp: Do you perceive that the
town’s tolerance is running out?

Huntley: Yes, I think it is,
again speaking in a ten-year
time span. That's one of the
messages I tried to pass on to
the IFC, that the time for frater-
nities to improve both the fact
and image of their existence
was at hand.

I am also aware of the fact
that the students here are not
the ones primarily responsible
for tarnishing the image of
fraternities. That may strike
some as unfair, but if it’s unfair
it’s not an unfairness to anyone
who can't do anything about it.

by the fraternities have been

Huntley: I think by some. And
I think it's important that it con-

Hollins

Actually the project is a fund-
raising effort to help pay for the
team's proposed training trip to
Bermuda this spring.

The lacrosse team will at-
tempt to push a bed on wheels
from Lexington to Hollins along
US Route tH on Sunday, Nov. 4.

John Hooper, co-captain of
the lacrosse team, said the
team will work in shifts on the
trip, estimated to take 10-12
hours. The bed-push will start
at5a.m.

Hooper said the bed-push will
be attempted rain or shine. He
said he is not sure yet who may
be invited to ride in the bed.

The team is asking students
to pledge money to the team for
every mile it pushes the bed.
Pledges can be made to any
member of the lacrosse team.

Hooper said the team will
plan a party at Hollins to
celebrate the feat.

When asked why the team
picked pushing a bed to Hollins,
Hooper said, ‘‘What else are
you going to push?”’

How W&L’s Professors Are Granted Tenure

by Mike Perry

The following article is the first
in a series evaluating the pro-
cedure under which tenure is
granted at Washington and Lee.
This initial story provides a
description of and background
surrounding the tenure proce-
dure. Upcoming articles will in-
clude interviews with instructors
and administrators and an
analysis of tenure at W&L—its
successes and failures.

Tenure has had a widespread
influence in the contemporary
American educational scene.
Virtually all instructors from
kindergarten teachers to uni-
versity department chairmen
work under a contract that in-
cludes some provision for
tenure.

Whether seen as a safeguard
of academic freedom or simply
compensation for a relatively
low pay scale, tenure means job
security.

Although the attainment of
tenure generally means that
faculty members cannot be
removed from their teaching
positions without due cause,
there are likely to be as many
definitions of due cause and
practical applications of the
tenure principle as there are
tenure clauses in teachers’ con-
tracts across the nation.

For an overview of the role
tenure plays in the hiring and
firing practices here at
Washington and Lee, we con-
sulted the September 1979 edi-
tion of the Faculty Handbook.

New Faculty

New faculty member con-
tracts are awarded as term ap-
pointments, or ‘‘an appoint-
ment for a specified period of
time (one or more years), or an
appointment which
automatically renews -from
year to year until further
notice,”’ according to the Facul-
ty Handbook,

After serving on the faculty
for seven years, generally in the
form of one or more term ap-
pointments, those faculty mem-
bers initially appointed as In-
structor or Assistant Professor
will be considered for a tenure
appointment.

Exceptions to this policy in-
clude appointees who have
served on the faculty of another
institution for more than three
years; their term appointments
may only be for as long as four
years, and those faculty mem-
bers appointed initially to the
rank of Associate Professor or
Professor need only two years
of service before receiving
tenure consideration.

Promotion to the rank ot
Associate Professor or Pro-
fessor following an initial term
appointment to a lesser rank is
also ‘deemed to confer tenure
unless accompanied by an ex-
plicit written agreement to the
contrary.” Faculty members
may also be hired with tenure.

   

What It Means
All faculty members, as
stated in the Faculty Handbook,

“upon receiving a tenure ap-
pointment...shall have perma-
nent and continuous tenure,
which is defined as meaning
that his service shall not be ter-
minated or his academic rank
reduced except for adequate
cause, or because of attainment
of the established retirement
age, or under extraordinary cir-
cumstances because of finan-
cial exigencies.”’

This provision is not ap-
plicable to administrative posi-
tions and a_ teaching ad-
ministrator may be removed
from his administrative posi-
tion, but not from his teaching
position subject to policy re-
garding academic tenure.

Faculty members holding
tenure appointments may only
be removed with the approval
of the Board of Trustees of the
University who have recognized
the functional purpose of tenure
as “‘to create an atmosphere of
mutual goodwill and dedication
in achieving a stimulating in-
tellectual exchange between
members of the University
Community,” according to the
Faculty Handbook.

Decision Process

One measure of the im-
portance accorded tenure at
W&L is the involved decision
process used as a basis in grant-
ing tenure appointments.

The Department Head and
the tenured members of the de-
partment all voice their input to
the President’s Advisory Com-
mittee, consisting of three

elected faculty members and
the three academic deans, who,
in turn, issue a recommenda-
tion to the President of the
University. The President then
formulates a recommendation
which he submits to the Board
of Trustees for their approval.

If it seems that a great deal of
time and consideration is given
a candidate for tenure it is done
with good reason: dismissal of a
tenured faculty member is a
very difficult and involved
process.

“Adequate cause for a dis-
missal will be related, directly
and substantially, to the fitness
of the faculty member in his

professional capacity as a
teacher and researcher,” ac-
cording to the Faculty Hand-
book.

 

Dismissal of a tenured faculty
member must follow a discus-
sion ‘with appropriate ad-
ministrative officers looking
toward a mutual settlement and
an informal inquiry by the
President’s Advisory Commit-
tee whose opinion is not binding
upon the President.’’

Actual dismissal comes from
the President in a statement of
charges.

The accused faculty member
can dispute the President’s
dismissal decision in a hearing
before an Ad Hoc Committee
comprised of five elected facul-
ty members.

The faculty members also has

the option of waiving such a the P

hearing and presenting his case
to a hearing tribunal for their
recommendation.

Like A Trial

Should the faculty member
opt for a hearing, a procedure
not unlike that used in an open
student honor trial is followed
with the hearing committee de-
ciding whether the hearing
should be public or private.

Both the accused faculty
member and the President are
permitted to have legal counsel
present as well as provide
witnesses and forms of
evidence.

Any decision by the hearing
committee, whether to sustain
ident’ mmenda-

    

tion, overturn it or lessen the
penalty is passed on to the
President of the University.

The committee’s findings are
subject to the approval of the
Executive Committee of the
Board of Trustees. The Ex-
ecutive Committee will review
the hearing taking into account

any specific objections or new
evidence. The Executive Com-
mittee also has the option of
returning the case to the hear-
ing committee with specific ob-
jections and new evidence.

The Executive Committee’s
action is presented to the Board
of Trustees for ratification.

W&L To Host Italian Sculpture

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s duPont Gallery will pre-
sent sculptures by Bruno Luc-
chesi beginning Monday, Oct.
29, and continuing through Fri-
day, Nov. 23, in duPont Hall on
the north edge of the college
campus.

The exhibition is composed of
“genre sculptures,’’ which are
story-telling groups dealing
with everyday people and situa-
tions. The majority of the
figures are in bronze, and treat
a variety of subjects, from
Italian housewives on a balcony
to a collection of weary
travelers waiting at a transit
station.

The noted art crrtic Thomas
S. Buechner commented recent-
ly that Lucchesi’s ‘‘attitudes,
influences and skills are both

natural and contemporary,”’ .

although he was raised in the
classical traditions of
Renaissance art. As a result of
this fortunate blend, Buechner
says Lucchesi and his craft
reach a level of competence
‘seldom achieved — or even
sought — in these days. This
craft is all-embracing in a
Renaissance sense — not only
does it include the intricacies of

High Prices And Radio
Play Hurt Album Sales

by Mark Kinniburgh

The fall selection of record
releases are now veryavailable
with the notable exception of
Bruce Springsteen, and even
without an addition from
Ashbury Park, there are plenty
of nice music buys in the store
racks.

Along with the normal record
promotion hype that is going on,
radio is an integral part of
whether an album becomes a
“success” or not. A major pro-
blem has surfaced this year
particularly, and it involves
these new releases and the
radio stations.

To explain through example,
take Led Zeppelin’s latest
album on Swan Song records.
As soon as the album was
released on August 20th, 1979,
every major radio station in the
country bombarded the album
with airplay and attention. On
that evening, almost everyone
in the country could have heard
the entire album, _uninter-
rupted, as it was presented in a
feature spot from coast to coast.

Here’s the problem. A record
company makes money through
record sales revenue, and the
$8.98 list price has made it dif-
ficult to insure mass sales of
even a popular album. To add to
the sales difficulty, a radio sta-
tion plays the entire album one
evening, and a listener with a
good FM radio and cassette
deck gets a copy of the album
for the price of a cassette.

Chris Pool of Fantasia
Records and Tapes in Arl-
ington, Texas complains this
way “I wish I knew how many
record sales are lost in this area

 

 

Movie Review

Monty Python’s Latest

Is A Disappointment
by Dash Coufal

 

MONTY PYTHON’S THE LIFE
OF BRYAN

Written and performed by
Grahm Chapman, John Cleese,
Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry
Jones, and Michael Palin.
Directed by Terry Jones.
Animations by Terry Gilliam.

Funny and sacriligious! The
Life of Bryanis the story of a
Jew named Bryan who was
born on the same day as Christ.

Bryan grows up to join the
Hebrew underground and
become entangled with the
Romans. Quite as a fluke he is
taken as the Messiah and ac-
quires a following.

In the end he is crucified
despite numerous attempts to
save him. Which all goes to
show that the Romans can’t
take a joke.

Funny as it is, Bryan can’t
hold a candle to Monty Python’s
earlier work. The problem is ob-

vious: The Life of Bryan tries to
have a coherent story (unlike
anything they’ve done before)
and thus misses out on the
sillyness, insanity, and hillarity
of their previous disjointed
works.

The only totally extraneous
sequence is one with some
aliens, one of the funniest
scenes in the film, whereas The
Holy Grail was rife with mean-
ingless bits that failed to tie in
with the mainstream of the
movie.

Gilliam’s animations are us-
ed only in the credits, and while
they are more polished and air-
brushed than before, they
aren't half as funny. One of the
funniest parts of the TV show
and The Holy Grail was the con-
stant interruption by the
animated sequences.

The funniest thing Monty
Python’s ever done was the TV
series, which dealt with the pre-
sent rather than with quasi-

historical material. Who do
their movies depart from this
format to indulge in less funny
costume dramas? Why cant’t
they make a movie about
modern day London, an easier
target for lampooning?

As actors, once again the
Python crew is impeccable.
Each of them plays many roles,
and each role is clearly
characterised.

Some of the roles are
hilarious in themselves: such as
the lisping Roman counsel and
his “‘fwend Biggious Dickious,”’
the mad jailer, the man who
picks his nose, and the man who
contends that the Romans can’t
take a joke.

Also, I should mention that
Carol Cleveland, one of the few
real women in the cast, must be
ranked with Margret Dumont
(who played opposite the Marx
Brothers) as one of the most
tolerant and long suffering
women in history.

from the local radio stations
playing both sides of new LP
releases...d.j’s really don’t
have to tell people to get their
tape recorders ready.”’ Record
retailers at this level are really
hurting because of radio
overplay, and it sends shock
waves up to the company ex-
ecutives themselves.

The company cannot function
if the album doesn’t get any
airplay, so there is a trade-off
point. I would recommend
lowering the price of the albums
themselves, to make them
economically feasible for the
majority of record consumers.
If the list price of an album
were $4.98, and discount con-
sumer outlets sold the album
for, say, $3.99, there would pro-
bably be double the album sales
than at a list price of $8.98.

Another advantage of the
lower list price would be that
lesser-known artists would get a
better chance in the retail
market, where it is now certain
death for a young artist, if the
“hit” on the album does not sell
the entire album.

In the past, the major labels
found out that an unknown is not
going to make it at an $8.98 list
price, because the consumer
won’t risk the money. Now, for
the test — will the new Fleet-
wood Mack album ‘‘Tusk”’ sell
at a $15.98 list price?

There are some labels which
are trying to get around the
high-cost barrier to albums by
lesser knowns. Atco for one is
the pioneer in the $5.98 list price
field. Sire records, on the other
hand, seems to take beatings
financially on every venture,
the latest of which is a release
by the Alda Reserve Band.

This is the kind of band that is
good, but not really an attention
grabber like a Ramones or
Blondie. They are destimed to
be FM radio children and not
much more, especially to the
Sire folks. Notes: The reason
Springsteen’s album is being
held up until the new year is
that the record label doesn’t
want to compete with the
Eagles and Fleetwood
Mack...Gary Numan will be
touring this February, ac-
cording to Atco records, concur-
rent with the new release in
January of ‘Passion Play’’...

Enjoying Our
Little Game

By Ray McNulty
Sports Editor
Dear Readers,

It has come to our attention that there are some
students who are dissatisfied with the sports section
of the Ring-tum Phi. The criticism have ranged from
our ‘monumental waste of space’’ — our Grid Picks
— to our lack of school spirit.

First, let me entertain the complaint that our Grid
Picks column is a waste of space. This year at the
Ring-tum Phi, especially in the sports department,
we are trying to make the school paper more appeal-
ing than it has been in the past. For that reason, we
have decided to try new and different ideas, i.e. Grid
Picks, This Week In Sports, a wider range of sports
coverage and better layout.

Contrary to minority opinion, these additions to the
section have met with at least some degree of suc-
cess. Students have found the sports calendar helpful,
they are enjoying our wider range of coverage and —
believe it or not — they are reading our Grid Picks.
(Whether or not they agree with our picks is irrele-
vant.)

As for our success at picking winners, both Mr.
Whalen and I have been correct just less than 60 per-
cent of the time. Compared to the records of the pro-
fessionals, we are not doing too badly. (We also
choose only games that are expected to be a close con-
test.) And for our being informed, both Mr. Whalen
and I are ardent football fans and try to keep abreast
of the latest sports news.

The letter to the editor in last week’s edition of the
Phi accused Mr. Whalen and I of having no school
spirit. The author of that letter was obviously a mis-
informed babbler with an urge to publicize his ig-
norance.

Had he first researched his claim, he would have
found out that Mr. Whalen and I are both firm sup-
porters of W&L athletics. He would have found that
Mr. Whalen has attended every athletic event he was
capable of attending, rooting for the Generals. As for
myself, I have worked at the Sports Information Of-
fice for four years turning out PR material about
W&L sports. In addition, I have also played on the
varsity and JV lacrosse teams. Had he looked even
further, he would have seen that in most of our com-
mentaries, we are very supportive of W&L sports.

Also, if we did not have any school spirit, it is doubt-
ful that Mr. Whalen and I would bother to take the
time (and it takes up a lot of it) to put together an in-
formative and interesting sports section for the
students to read every week.

We have been attacked for criticizing W&L athletic
teams and for picking the football team to lose in our
Grid Picks column. We have been criticized for not
saying nice things about the teams even when they
lose or play poorly. These attacks are accurate — but
so are our criticisms.

The Ring-tum Phi is not a public relations sheet for
W&L sports. Mr. Whalen and I both consider
ourselves journalists — objective journalists. We can-
not let our biases for W&L affect our stories. If there
are students out there who disagree with this
philosophy and just want to read positive things about
W&L, they can stop by the sports information office

Water polo coach Page Remillard discusses strategy during a short break in weekend action. The
Generals went unbeaten in Southern Conference play to boost their season record to 13-2.

Tourney Sweep Gives

Water Polo 13-2 Mark

by Dave Johnson

If you enjoy sports and you
were on the W&L campus Satur-
day afternoon, then you should
have been at the Cy Twombly
pool watching the Generals tak-
ing on Richmond in water polo.
For the first time in nine years,
W&L beat Richmond 6-5 in over-
time.

The victory over Richmond
was W&L’s fourth win of the
weekend, the others coming
against VMI, Duke, and UNC
(Chapel Hill), bringing the
General’s record to an im-
pressive 13-2. The team has
received votes for the NCAA
Top Ten for the past two weeks
and after the weekend’s games,
they are sure to be awarded
that distinction once again,

The games were played Fri-
day and Saturday in the second
half of the Southern Water Polo
League Tournament: a
qualification tournament for
the Southern League Champion-
ships — to be played at W&L
Nov. 2-3. Last weekend’s
games, along with five wins two
weeks earlier at Richmond,
earned the Generals the top
seed in the Championships.

W&L’s first game was against
VMI Friday afternoon. The
Generals totally dominated the
game and won it by a 16-1 score.

Despite the easy victory,
W&L coach Page Remillard
had good things to say about the
VMI team. ‘‘They have some
skilled athletes, and with a little
more time they could put
together a_ seriously com-
petitive team,’’ said the coach.

The W&L’s second game of
the tournament was much
closer and exciting as the
Generals battled to a 10-9 vic-
tory over Duke University.
W&L trailed for most of the
game due to what Remillard
called ‘forced’ play and a
“failure to execute’.

Throughout the game, W&L
was plagued by offensive tur-

novers which kept them from
generating any offense. The last
two minutes of the game saw
the Generals turn around and
show the way that they are
capable of playing, however.

W&L’s next victim was the
UNC team, which was polished
off 15-1. One reason for the lop-
sided score was the absence of
several key players from the
UNC lineup. Another reason
was the fine offensive play of
Drew Pillsbury, who scored a
total of seven goals, four of
which came on assists from co-
captain Biff Martin.

Also having an impressive
game was goalie Will Hodges,
who held UNC scoreless
through almost three full
periods. The defensive effort
was led by the squad’s other
captain, Mike Foley.

Then came the big game:
W&L versus Richmond. The
Generals jumped out to an early
4-1 lead on the strength of a very
mobile offense. This aggressive
offensive play was also respon-
sible for getting the Richmond
team into deep foul trouble.
Good defense by Richmond
allowed them to come back
strong and tie the game at the
end of regulation play, 4-4.

The game was still tied at the
close of the first overtime
period, as each team scored
once. W&L scored the winning
goal with about a minute left in
the second overtime period to
end this exciting game.

The standout player of the
game was Bob Newcomb whose
defensive efforts, along with
those of Foley and Trip
Johnstone, were, in Remillard’s
words, ‘‘the key to the victory’’.

Remillard was extremely
pleased with the victory and
points to this game as ‘‘the one
that makes W&L a true con-
tender in water polo.” He also
was very happy with the fan
support for the big games of the
weekend, during which the 500
seat gallery was filled almost to
capacity with very vocal fans.

He called the support
“motivational”, saying: ‘We:
really appreciated the support
by the faculty and the frater-
nities, and we hope that support
will continue.”

The water polo Generals will
face Richmond again this
weekend, in the Virginia State
Championships at Richmond,

Generals Beat Roanoke As
Halcomb Gets 3rd Shutout

by Bill Whalen

The Washington & Lee soccer
team made it two in a row
yesterday with a 1-0 victory
over Roanoke College. The win
moved the Generals to within
one game under .500 with three
games remaining in the season.

‘People have written us off,”’
said coach Rolf Piranian, ‘‘but
we're 4-5-1 and going after
Lynchburg.’’ The Generals play
Lynchburg, a 9-2-1 team, this
Saturday.

From the beginning of the
game, it appeared to be all
W&L. The Generals controlled
the ball deep in Maroon ter-
ritory and rarely let Roanoke
get past midfield.

Throughout the first part of
this period, however, the
Generals missed several scor-

 

ing opportunities. The constant ing the shutout fell on freshman

    
 

pressure from corner and in-
direct kicks soon payed off,
however.

With 20:30 left in the first half,
W&L scored the game’s only
goal off one such opportunity.
Freshman forward Brad Poor-
man lofted a shot from the cor-
ner and into the goal crease,
where junior forward Mark
Turner took charge and headed
the ball into the right corner of

the net.
While the Generals had a

relatively easy first half, the se-
cond half proved to be a more
harrowing experience. All the
close calls which were going
W&L’s way in the first half were
now going against them.

The result of this was alot of
pressure put on the General’s
defense. The chore of preserv-

goalie Rody Halcomb.

Halcomb, who recorded his
third shutout in his fourth start
in goal, resonded by stopping all
of Roanoke’s 13 second half
shots. On the day, the Generals
were outshot 18-17.

‘Rody Halcomb played
another outstanding game for
us,”’ said Piranian, ‘‘We’re also
getting better defense — which
always helps.”’

Still, Piranian expressed
some worry over his team’s of-
fensive performance. ‘‘We’re
still not getting our goals,”’ add-
ed the coach,” and we'll have to
work on that.”’

The Generals’ last three
opponents are Lynchburg,
Virginian Wesleyan and VMI.
The VMI game is also the last
home game of the season.

Booters Dump MWC
On Brown’s Late Goal

by Chris Sisto

Last Saturday, the varsity
soccer team executed its third
shutout of the season in a 1-0
victory over Mary Washington
College. The win improved the
Generals’ overall record to
3-5-1.

Against Mary Washington the
team had several opportunities
to score but tallied only once
when Bill Brown, assisted by
Chris Daniel, put in a shot with
only 5:10 remaining in the
game.

W&L Coach Rolf: Piranian
was pleased by his team’s
superb defensive effort. ‘‘Our
defense played great,’ Pira-
nian said.

“They didn’t allow Mary
Washington any significant
scoring opportunities,” added
the coach. They had sixteen

shots on goal and none of them

really threatened.”

The only exception to this was
a penalty kick by Mary
Washington following a ques-
tionable call late in the second
half.

With about ten minutes re-
maining in the game several
players from both teams went
scrambling for the ball in front
of the Generals’ net.

A Generals’ defenseman was
penalized for taking an oppo-
nent off the ball and Mary
Washington was awarded a
penalty kick.

This kick was beautifully
stopped by Generals’ goalie
Rody Halcomb. Preserving the
shutout seemed to spark the of-
fense. Several minutes later,
Brown put in his winning goal.

Piranian, was still not

satisfied with his team’s offen-

sive output, however. Several

times early in the game,
General forwards Ben Muskin
and Mark Turner could not
capitalize on chances to score.

Piranian stated about his of-
fense: “It is definitely not a
lack of effort from our offensive
players; it is just that they are
inexperienced.”

The Generals hope to improve
this situation by Wednesday
when they face rival Roanoke
College. This is the 40th meeting
between the two teams and is
also an ODAC match. Piranian
feels confident his team can win
if the Generals can get more of-
fensive output.

In other soccer notes the
Generals’ ‘‘B’’ soccer team tied
Valley United College, 2-2,
Saturday, running their record
to 2-4-1. Their next opponent is
Eastern Mennonite, in a match
to be played today.

Commentary:

T.V. Torture

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

Last Saturday was one of those rare occasions at
W&L it-was a sports smorgasbord day. In the period
of one day, there was too many things going on at the
same time for the avid sports fan to keep up with.

 

After a leisurely noon lunch, the sports freak could
have marched out to Wilson Field where the J.V. soc-
cer team was playing. If he found this to be too boring,
he might find the nearest T.V. set and park himself on
the sofa, to be entertained by an afternoon of college
football, which started at 12:30 p.m.

But all this bliss ended at 3 p.m., when complica-
tions began to set in. ‘Should I stay with Notre Dame-
USC or should I listen to the W&L game?”’ he asked
himself.

At this point, a major commitment had to be made.
Take it from the voice of experience, it’s impossible to
watch a game on T.V. while listening to another on the
radio. Eventually, you’ll find yourself too wrapped up
in one game to understand what’s happening in the
other.

I opted for the W&L game and, as it happened, I
made the right choice. While USC was putting the
screws to Notre Dame, I was listening to W&L losing
a true heartbreaker, 15-14.

Of course, my motives were not purely instinctive.
The Fighting Irish was one of my least favorite teams
and I was deathly afraid that they would upset USC -
the school with my favorite fight song and the best
looking group of cheerleaders.

(Editor’s Note - Princess Margaret of England
recently said that the Irish were ‘‘pigs.’’ How about
that! Princess Margaret is a USC fan?)

The W&L game left me depressed but not for long
when I remembered that the second half of ABC’s
football doubleheader was Texas-Arkansas. So I rush-
ed to the tube and did I see the Longhorns and the
Razorbacks? Nope, UNC - N.C. State.

But Saturday was not the first time this has happen-
ed to me. Other past disappointments include NBC’s
replacement of the Steelers-Browns game with the
Jets and the Colts matchup. And who can forget last
year’s gem when ABC cancelled USC-UCLA in favor
of that annual fall classic — Furman vs. Appalachian
State.

Moves like these make me wander about the in-
telligence of television programmers. These last
minute substitutions are not caused by popular de-
mand, but are the result of trying to get better ratings
through ‘‘regional’’ broadcasts.

A reasonable argument can be made that we are in
the same broadcast region as Appy State and UNC.
But how can the networks claim that Baltimore and
Roanoke support the same teams? Look at a map.
Baltimore, not even the closest NFL city, is almost
275 miles from the nearest Roanoke stations.

At least some sort of justice prevailed in the
Baltimore case. While the Colts were playing in one of
the dullest games of the season (which usually hap-
pens when an 0-5 team plays a 2-3 team), the Steelers
and the Browns had the highest scoring game of the
year.

Say goodbye to the principle of providing the public
with the best available entertainment. Profits, not
performance, are what control television sports-
viewing today.

Who suffers the most in this conflict of interests?
The viewers, of course.

as possible scouting terrain
before the opening day. Com-
petition will be keen that first
week but the well-prepared
hunter will have a distinct ad-
vantage over those whose first
step in the woods this year are
on opening day.

For Washington & Lee
hunters, the first problem en-
countered, when scouting for
game, is finding some land to
scout on. The federal and state
governments maintain
thousands of acres of prime
hunting land for public use.

These lands, though often
miserably overcrowded on
opening day, are usually
deserted after the first week of
the season. Much of this land is
in easy reach of Lexington. The
Goshen-North Mountain
Wildlife Area is controlled by
The Va. Game Commission and
has 16,000 acres open to public
hunting. Turkey, grouse and
deer are abundant in this area
which has several convenient
access trails. Maps of the public
land are available from the
Pedlar River Ranger District
Office in Buena Vista. The
state-owned Lake Robertson
Area has 500 acres open to
public hunting. Deer and
turkeys can be found in this
area as well as several coveys
of quail. Maps may be obtained
in Buena Vista. Perhaps the
largest tract of public hunting
land in this area is found on the
George Washington National
Forest. This immense area is
located on either side of the
Blue Ridge Parkway north of
the James River.

Game of all species abound in
this area, including some of the
state’s best bear hunting land.
Maps are available at the
Buena Vista Ranger’s Office.

The Jefferson National
Forest is found on the southeast
side of the James River in the
Arnold’s Valley area. This land
is similar to the Washington Na-
tional Forest in that it is very
large and has excellent hunting.
Maps can be obtained at the
Glenwood Ranger District Of-
fice in Natural Bridge.

Sewanee Edges W&L
As Defense Falters

By Dale Park

For W&L football, it has been
a season of ups and downs. The
Generals came off with a spec-
tacular win against Hampden-
Sydney two weeks ago, only to
be tripped up in the final
minutes by Sewanee, 15-14.

Sewanee, the University of
the South, avenged its loss last
year at the hands of the
Generals and dropped W&l’s
overall record to 2-5.

The Generals played an un-
characteristically sub-par
game defensively. “We were
not ready to play,” said Head
Coach Gary Fallon. ‘We may
have been overconfident — we
tackled poorly, allowing their
running backs to pick up yar-
dage on second and third ef-
forts.”

Yet if the defense had its pro-
blems, the offense continued to
show signs of improvement. By
alternating quarterbacks Jim
Wenke and Chris Cavalline, the
Generals improved their pass-
ing and option attack.

Freshman Cavalline also ran
the bootleg effectively several
times, picking up 30 yards in six
carries. ‘‘Cavalline has the
speed to make the option plays
go,”’ said Fallon. ‘“‘We’re gain-
ing more confidence in him all
the time.”

Kicking proved to be an im-
portant factor in the General’s
joss. While being pinned in their
own territory by deadly punts,
W&L game Sewanee good field
position through poor kicks.

The game started on a good
defensive note. Late in the first
quarter the Generals’ goal-line
stand held Sewanee for three
plays, finally forcing and
recovering a fourth and goal
fumble on the two-yard line.

The’ field position was less
than opportune however.
Several plays later, junior slot-
back Chris Leiser was nailed
for a safety, making the score
2-0 Sewanee. The safety proved
to be the deciding two points in
the game.

Two possessions later,
Sewanee engineered a six-play,
42-yard drive ending in an eight
yard touchdown scramble by
Sewanee quarterback Holland.
The successful point-after
boosted the score to 9-0
Sewanee.

Although allowing 244 yards
rushing, the Generals
themselves compiled 198 yards
on the ground, due mostly to
senior tailback Stu Atkinson.
Atkinson gained 161 yards on 31
carries and was the major

figure in two impressive W&L
scoring drives.

Starting late in the first half,
Cavalline took the Generals
from mid-field to the Sewanee
five, depending heavily on the
running of Atkinson. The drive
was capped off by a five-yard
Cavalline touchdown pass to
tight end Syd Farrar with 2:05
left in the half. The successful
conversion cut the Tiger’s lead
to 9-7.

At this point and for most of
the second half, the W&L
defense stiffened. Led by a pair
of freshmen, linebacker Phil
Alletto .and defensive back
Barry Thompson, Sewanee net-
ted zero yards through the air
all afternoon.

Midway through the third
quarter the Generals were on
the move again. Cavalline took
his team to the Sewanee 39 yard
line in six plays. The drive was
completed when Atkinson raced
the remainder of the field for
the touchdown. The Generals
now lead, 14-9.

Once again what seemed to be
the perfect scenario for a come-
from-behind W&L victory was
ruined by the Generals’ inabili-
ty to stop its opponents final and
decisive drive.

In a long, 14-play series,
Sewanee plodded downfield to
score a one-yard run. The two
point conversion attempt failed,
leaving the score 15-14 in favor
of the Tigers with 4:35 left in the
game. “The Sewanee backs
were very tough and converted
several fourth down situa-
tions,” said Fallon.

Trying to come back, the
Generals were able to drive to
the Sewanee 36 yard line. Faced
with a fourth and eleven situa-

tion, W&L opted to go for the
first down, with Sophomore
Rich Hachenburg now at
quarterback.

‘‘A field goal would have been
50 yards-plus into the wind,”
said Fallon. ‘Instead we opted
for a first down try. Hachen-
burg is particularly familiar
with the pass play we ran,
which is why he came into the
game.”

The pass, and with it the
Generals’ hopes for victory, fell
just short.

Next week the Generals face
Bridgewater College at home.
Fallon said, ‘the game should
be interesting in that
Bridgewater is number-one
against the rush in the 0.C.A.C.
while we are the top rushing
team in the conference.’’
Bridgewater was relatively
unhurt by graduation, with 15 of
last year’s 22 starters return-
ing.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. at
Wilson Field.

EC Investigates
Campus Security

by Joe Scott

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed three of its members to
a new subcommittee dealing
with campus security at Mon-
day’s short session.

The decision was reached
after lengthy debate over the
Ring-tum Phi’s Oct. 18 security
editorial.

“It kind of blasted us,’’ said
Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould about the editorial.
He added that a response from
the EC might be considered.

“‘We are not a police force,”’
said EC President Steve
Abraham. “‘I would be willing to
talk to Huntley about it,” he
added but we can’t deal with
these student problems unless

_ they come to us. The EC’s job

though is ‘“‘to cover any pro-
blems of the students.’’

“T think the Phi’s assumption
(security problem) is just that
— an assumption,” said Third
Year Law Rep. John Fraser. “‘I
would be willing to work on a
subcommittee to look into this,”’
he added.

Fraser will head the commit-
tee. Ould and Junior Rep. Bruce
Poole are also looking into the
matter. They will report back to
the EC on Nov. 12. (See letter to
the editor, page 10).

Run-off elections for two

freshman class positions ended
in victory for Edmund

Schenecker and James Averett.

 

Schenecker won the EC
Representative race with a
total of 101 votes and Averett,
now Freshman Class President,
won with 126 votes cast.

In other EC business, appoint-
ments for the Student Health
Committee and the University
Athletic Committee were ap-
proved with the newly opened
positions going to David
Williamson, who assured the
EC that he had time to devote to
health matters, and Thomas
Wall, who said it would be good
for the school if we looked into
the possibility of athletically
competing with Ivy League Col-
leges. Being the only students to
apply for the positions the EC
unanimously voted them in.

Bill Ridge, co-chairman of the
Students Activities Board,
reported on the SAB’s past
meeting. Ridge said they had
talked about the problem of get-
ting a projectionist for-Sunday
films and have postponed
discussion of Fancy Dress until
next week.

Ridge said that 26 students
had applied for SAB positions
but only five or six would be ac-
cepted. The final decision will
be given at a future meeting of
the SAB.

Thomas Spencer, the EC’s
lawyer, was reported to have
drafted a letter to all bad check
offenders specifying that legal
action will be taken if replies
are not received in ten days.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Notes On The Trial

After last spring’s carnival-like open honor hear-
ing, the serious approach taken by all concerned in
Saturday’s proceeding was a reassuring affirmation
of the strength of Washington and Lee’s honor
system. There are no doubts here that justice was ful-
ly rendered during the 13-hour-long hearing.

The proceeding was ably run by Bill Garrett, presi-
dent of the Student Bar Association, who correctly
allowed both sides the necessary time to present all
their evidence and supporting testimony.

Most importantly, it was obvious that the jury of
student peers took their responsibility with the ap-
propriate seriousness; their questions were often
tougher than those posed by the student attorneys
during cross-examination.

Both eyewitnesses to the cheating attended the
hearing with great reservation and at a substantial in-
convenience. Yet both came long distances on rather
short notice to spend their Saturday at W&L. They
both expressed a strong sense of duty to their role in
upholding the honor system; they attended to “‘see
justice done,”’ as one of the eyewitnesses so aptly put
it.

The hearing had a certain dignity to it, if one can
say that of a proceeding for an honor offense with ex-
pulsion the penalty.

The hearing was of some significance because the
controversial polygraph machine was also on trial.
The defense, which apparently invested heavily in the
machine’s results, was allowed to admit the lie detec-
tor test as evidence for the first time in a W&L honor
hearing, to our knowledge.

It is doubtful if the hearing erased any misgivings
about the accuracy of polygraphs as admissible
evidence. But is is imp important to note that the stu-
dent jury was apparently unswayed by the test
results, judging from the conviction handed down
which conflicted with those results.

A major drawback in the hearing was the con-
spicuous lack of students attending to watch their
honor system at work. Part of the problem was the
scheduling of the trial—few students were sufficiently
interested in spending most of an otherwise very plea-
sant Saturday inside Lee Chapel. More importantly,
however, many interested students never got the
word because notice of the hearing was posted less
than 48 hours before the proceeding began.

We should reiterate here our impression that the
hearing was fairly administered and justice was
rendered. But we must end this analysis with some
questions.

In the past six months there have been two appeals
of honor convictions to the student body—more ap-
peals than in the preceding five years. A finding of
guilty in an open hearing is no longer recorded on the
student’s transcript. Does this mean that we may see
more honor offense convictions appealed to the stu-
dent body in the future simply because the accused
has nothing more to lose? And if so, is this necessarily
bad for W&L’s honor system?

Letters To The Editor

Report Security Problems To EC

Dear Editor:

It has come to the attention of
the Executive Committee that
there may be a need for improv-
ed campus security. In order to
determine whether there is in-
deed a need the Executive Com-
mittee has appointed a subcom-

mittee to investigate the mat-
ter.

I feel that I can speak for the
E.C. in stating that we are un-
willing to assume that there is a
new or expanded problem with
vandalism or _ violence.
However, the role of the E.C. is

 

 

 

 

Persiflage

 

not to sit back and cope with
problems only when they reach
crisis proportion.

‘The members of the Campus
Security Subcommittee are
Nelson Ould, Bruce Poole and
John Fraser. Any member of
the student body, or any person
associated with the University
should feel welcome to address
comments to these people. Writ-
ten comments can be sent to the
Executive Committee offices in
the University Center. The com-
ments will be particularly
useful if they are received
before November 9.

The subcommittee will also
try to schedule opportunities for
students, faculty, staff and
others to comment at open
meetings scheduled during the
next two weeks. Interested per-
sons should watch the campus
bulletin boards for an-
nouncements of the time and
place of these meetings.

The subcommittee requests
that all comments, written or
oral, include a suggestion as to
how problems can_ be
alleviated. We hope that the
result of all this will be an im-
proved University.

Sincerely,

John Fraser

The Advantages Of A Gut

 

A lot of people have pointed out to me that I
am developing a gut. Despite many long
hours of viewing sports on the tube, my flesh
seems to be continuously expanding over my
once quite comfortable pants.

Even my practice of religiously doing a few
12 oz. curls everyday seems to be of no avail.
But as I look toward the ground in search of
my feet I have to ask myself, ‘‘so what?”’

Even though the physical-fitness freaks
might disagree, being portly has some ad-
vantages. With the coming of winter, my ex-
tra layer of skin can help keep me warm and
thus conserve energy, in accordance with the

Graffiti

Dear Editor ;

As a vistor to W&L recently, I
was encouraged at the many
positive changes that have oc-
curred since I graduated.

I believe the renovations and
new construction will allow the

President’s energy guidelines.

Portly people also get invited to a lot of par-
ties because: a.) people automatically
assume that you are funny, and b.) your cor-
pulence makes them feel better in com-
parison.

You even get to find out if girls like you for
yourself. For if we must be reminded that
beauty is only skin deep, only those who really
care will take the effort to go through those
extra layers of flesh.

Now, some people might say that I’m just
rationalizing, that no one could really enjoy
having a spare tire at such an early age. But I
say to them that by not worrying about such a
trivial matter as girth, I am more capable of
considering truly substantive and weighty
matters.

an atmosphere that I have
found unparalleled in any other
institution in Virginia.

The new library is especially
nice, as I had occasion to study
this past week. I was, however,
discouraged to see the graffiti,
in the bathrooms on every floor,
carved into the new wood doors,
and inked on the marble and
masonry.

These buildings belong to all
of us — students, faculty, and
alumni. Your tuition gives you
the privilege of learning here,
not a license to destroy school
property.

Let us stay proud of our
school and learn to behave as
adults.

‘In Response:

Ed Falkowski

Nuclear Power: Not Morally Acceptable

I take issue with the premises upon which
Earnest B. Ferguson bases his ‘‘reform-the-
industry’’ pro-nuclear opinion. (Ring-tum
Phi, ‘‘In Focus,”’ Oct. 18)

‘Without nuclear power we cannot do,” Mr.
Ferguson says. But authorities (including
those in the Department of Energy) agree
that 45 percent of U.S. energy is sheer waste.
This has nothing to to do with our allegedly
‘materialistic,’ life-style. The 45 percent
waste is simply a measure of the inefficiency
with which we use energy to satisfy our life-
style.

 

Mr. Falkowski is a first year law student at
Washington and Lee.

 

Efficiency alone would allow us to double
our effective energy supply. In several
Western Eupean countries our standard of
living is achieved with about half the per
capita consumption of energy.

As John Gofman (Professor Emeritus of
Medical Physics, the University of California
at Berkley—co-discoverer of Uranium 233)
points out, the choice is not between ‘‘clean
nukes” and ‘‘dirty coal,’’ but is rather “‘filthy
nukes” vs. “‘clean nuclear efficiency’’ (with
clean solar power coming along well in spite
of pitifully feeble government support). Gof-
man, ‘‘Nuclear Power: The Need For a Fog
Cutter,” National Forum, Fall, 1979.

By the statement, ‘‘without such reforms
we cannot continue to have nuclear power,”
Mr. Ferguson is implying that nuclear power
can be made acceptable. That is false.

Nuclear power cannot exist without routine
emissions of radioactivity. This is fully

recognized by the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission and the nuclear industry. The NRC
published a table estimating the number of
cancer deaths between 1975 and 2000 caused
by the use of nuclear power in the USS.
Assuming all goes well, there would be 1,100
deaths (26 in foreign countries ).

Direct evidence shows that the NRC has
underestimated this factor by a very large
margin. Studies by Ernest J. Sternglass,
Director of Radiological Physics, University
of Pittsburg, have correlated in a number of
instances the introduction of a nuclear reac-
tor in an area, with a sharp increase in cancer
death rates (these do not involve dramatic
“lapses” for which Mr. Ferguson would
punish violators.

As Dr. Sternglass testified in the trial of a
Federal court case (Honicker v. Hendrie, 465
F. Supp. 414 (M.D. Tenn., 1979)):

‘“‘We rely solely upon a comparison between
a city which has suddenly had nuclear power
operating in it...and suddenly, for no other ex-
plainable reason that has yet been advanced
by anyone in the industry or the Atomic
Energy Commission or the NRC, there was a
sudden and unexplainable rise in infant
deaths, in leukemia, and many years later in
various types of cancers.”’

(Testimony detailing some of these studies is
reprinted in Shutdown: Nuclear Power on
Trial, The Book Publishing Company, Sum-
mertown, TN. (1979).)

The use of nuclear energy will create vast
amounts of highly radioactive wastes. A re-
cent report by the U.8. General Accounting
Office criticized the Department of Energy

and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for

“understating the problems that exist with pro-

posals for waste disposal, and for claiming
the problems can be solved (GAO Report
“Major Unresolved Issues Preventing a
Timely Resolution to Radioactive Waste
Disposal,” July 13, 1978).

“Nuclear power cannot
exist without routine
emissions of radioactivity.
This is fully recognized by
the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission...”

 

After thirty years and millions of dollars
spent on research, the federal government
has not yet developed and adequately tested a
safe, permanent means of storing radioactive
wastes.

These wastes will remain dangerous for
hundreds of centuries. To submit future
generations to the risk of a breach of contain-
ment, for the sake of a few decades of electric
power, is an act of irresponsibility that is un-
precedented in human history.

Thus, Mr. Ferguson is skirting the real
issues when he calls for a “rolling of heads
among those responsible for lapses.’’ Lapses
or no, nuclear power is not a morally accep-
table alternative.

Lambda Chi Fined
For Kidnapping

by John Billmyre

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council fined
Lambda Chi Alpha $150 Tues-
day night for- kidnapping a
freshman from the Graham-
Lees dormitory on Friday, Oct.
26.

Members of Lambda Chi
waited almost an hour before
the Judicial Board reached a
decision, issued a statement on
kidnapping and fined the frater-
nity.

“The IFC Judicial Board does
in no way condone kidnapping.
Kidnapping that causes mental
and/or physical harm or in-
terferes with school work will
not be considered a legitimate
activity and will be dealt with
on an individual basis,”’ read
Secretary Sam Perkins when
Lambda Chi representatives
returned to the room.

Syd Farrar, IFC President,
noted that the kidnapping did
not harm the freshman or keep
him from doing work, but said
that freshmen are not to be
removed from the dorms.

After being removed from the
dorm, the freshman was driven
around town, given beer to
drink and left on a university
playing field.

During the Judicial Board
hearing representatives of
Lambda Chi, including IFC
Treasurer Hunt Shuford, stress-
ed that Lambda Chi’s house
policy prohibits kidnapping and

Vandalism And

Many recent acts of burglary
and vandalism have been at-
tributed to Lexington area
juveniles.
A juvenile has been arrested
- in the theft of a student’s

that the kidnapping was an in-
dividual effort.

Shuford said the policy was
posted in a two-page letter in
the house. .

Representatives indicated the
three individuals responsible
for the kidnapping will pay the
fine.

A precedent for the case was
set last year when Sigma Chi
was fined $150 for leaving a
freshman on the Blue Ridge
Parkway in his underwear.

Farrar said that the Judicial
Board will not tolerate kidnapp-
ing or hazing.

Hazing
Dorm counselors’ were
recently issued letters requir-
ing them to report any possible
cases of hazing, broadly defined
as physical and/or mental
abuse.

Farrar said paddling, hosing
with water, kidnapping, ‘‘dum-
ping on,’’ forced drinking bouts
and forced sitting in ice water
are considered hazing and will
not be tolerated.

He added, ‘“‘the Student Af-
fairs Committee might view
hazing differently than the IFC.

“If you do haze, it is more
than likely that someone will
come down hard on you,”’ Far-
rar said to IFC representatives
during the regular meeting.

Bands To Play

Both bands offer high energy
Southern rock and country
rock. Stillwater, who opened for
C-Level this summer, has two
albums on the market and has
been receiving a lot of air play
and attention.

Boot Hill Express, who was
on the W&L campus during
Rush, hails from Virginia
Beach, where it has played to
packed houses in the more
popular bars there. The band
features a female vocalist who
sings many Linda Ronstadt
songs and a peddle steel guitar.

EC Changes Cold Check Rule

by Joe Scott
The Executive Committee
authorized the Cold Check Com-
mittee to extend its bad check
stautute of limitations to two

meeting.

The move could substantially

offenders with a graduated fine
scale rising with the number of
offenses.

Three juveniles were ar-
rested on charges of robbery at
the Phi Gamma Delta fraterni-
ty house of Oct. 23. Whiskey,
money, billfolds and a watch
were stolen. The watch and
billfold have been recovered in
the incident.

On Oct. 24, a student reported
thata pong key had been stolen
from his front porch.

Bill Brock, a resident of the
East Nelson Street Apartments,
told police that someone had set
fire to his pumpkin on the back

porch. While Brock was putting ©

the fire, thieves removed the
keg from his front porch.

Brock was hosting. a small
gathering at the time of the
theft. The invesitgating officer
said that the only thing left was
“the ice around the keg.”’

Another student saw a keg be-
ing transferred to a car near the
place of robbery. The invesitga-
tion is continuing.

people think more about
floating checks,’’ said CCC
Treasurer Mike Malesardi, ad-
ding that a student’s third of-
fense would bring him before
the Student Control Committee.

Jim Vines, CCC Chairman,
said he was opposed to the two
year limit and in favor of rais-
ing the time limit to four years.

The 9-2 vote legalizes the new
rule which will go into effect
Nov. 1.

The CCC was also given per-
mission to withdraw up to $100
from the EC Reserve Fund at
any time during the week.
Previously the loan request had
to be submitted at the EC’s
regular Monday meeting.

“The $100 is a_ safety
cushion,”’ said Vines. “It would
keep the money_from coming
out of my pocket.” The reason
for the money, Vines said, was
to act as a safeguard against
checks bouncing that were writ-
ten to the CCC by bad check of-
fenders.

During the normal course of
operations checks sometimes
come pouring in, said Vines. He
added that “for the first two
months of school, we have had
$700 worth of bad checks,” a
figure much higher than before.

The motion, receiving
unanimous EC _ approval,
stipulated that the money tran-
saction could only be made bet-
ween Vines and EC Vice Presi-
dent Les Cotter and that the
loan would only be given if the
committee’s checking account
ran below $100. The loan must
be repaid within a month.

During the CCC’s monthly

report, Vines said they have
already received responses
from students, now out of Lex-
ington, about the letter EC at-
torney Thomas Spencer wrote
asking that bad checks be reim-
bursed within 10 days. Spencer
will receive one-third of the
recovered revenue for his ser-
vices.

The Student Activities Board
gave its monthly report outlin-
ing all entertainment expen-
ditures and noted that film
receipts hovered $434 over ex-
penses for October. SAB Co-
Chairman David Harpole added
that they will pick out some
more expensive films for the
winter.

EC President Steve Abraham
questioned the $44 projectionist
charge saying that his impres-
sion was that the service was
free. SAB Co-Chairman Bill
Ridge noted the Sunday night
showings conflicted with SAB
meetings and that the projec-
tionist was being paid $3.00 per
hour. Harpole said the SAB had
discussed the projectionist pro-
blem, had a ‘‘scolding session,”’
and now seemed to have all
under control.

Plans for Sunday’s Pavillion
party were detailed by the SAB.
Tickets for the party—featuring
Stillwater and_ Boothill
Express—will be sold at the
door and the Co-op. The party
runs from 2-6 p.m. and includes
30 kegs of Budweiser.

statement during their monthly
report showed higher subscrip-
tion revenues. “I think it’s

Cockpit To Get Giant TV

by Jim Feinman

Whether you are looking for a
nice place to take a date or just
want to watch the ball game
with the boys, the Cockpit is an
ideal choice.

The Cockpit, located on the
first floor of the University
Center, has always been a good
spot to take a date and soon, it
will be an even nicer place to
watch the game. Gerald Dar-
rell, manager of the Cockpit,
announced this week that a five-
and-a-half foot wide screen
television will be installed by
the beginning of next week. The
television will be used to watch
sporting events and movies.
This new addition should be
well-received by the student
community.

With the addition of the wide
screen T.V., the Cockpit will be
one of the nicest entertainment
rooms in town. The spacious
facility is well-equipped with
tables, booths and a bar. Hot
and cold sandwiches are served
along with a variety of
beverages, including beer. A
soup and salad bar is often
featured as a luncheon special.

Darrell, who has been respon-
sible for the Cockpit for the past
three years, has strived to
create an alternative to frater-
nity membership as_ the
primary source of student
entertainment at W&L. It is
well known that the social op-

portunities for a student who
does not wish to join a fraternity
are rather limited on campus as
well as in Lexington. Darrell
has tried to fill this void. Bands
appear frequently and feature
length movies are scheduled
often in the Cockpit.

Darrell feels that his efforts
are beginning to appeal to
students. He explains: ‘‘For
years there was a certain
stigma attached to the Cockpit.
For whatever reason, people
didn’t think anything was done
down there. Now, we're trying
to build up the business as a stu-
dent tavern. This would be an
alternative to fraternity parties
or going down the road. We
want to bring the road here.”

When Darrell says he wants
to bring the road here he means
it. Beer was half-priced for any
girl fron an area college for the
first month of school.

Greg Dyer, a senior accoun-
ting major from Bethesda, Md.,
Speaks well of the Cockpit. “‘It’s
a convenient place to relax
after studying. The beer is cold
and the burgers are hot. It was
a lot of fun watching the Series
in there, until the Birds started
losing.”

Darrell stresses the fact that
the Cockpit is managed for
students and relies heavily on
them for business. ‘‘Because
Washington and Lee is a non-
profit organization, and we are

a university facility, we do not
compete with the restaurants or
bars in town. Our only advertis-
ing is in the student newspaper
or on campus. Without the stu-
dent business we couldn’t func-
tion,”’ he explains.

If cold beer and good music is
the key to attracting students,
the Cockpit should not have
much trouble. Several _per-
formers have appeared in the
Cockpit already this year. The
All-Stars, a rock group from
Charlottesville, entertained a
packed house two weeks ago
and are expected to return in
the future.

Some of the bands that ap-
pear in the Cockpit are funded
by the tavern. However,
because the Cockpit is primari-
ly for students, the University
Center Committee also spon-
sors bands in the Cockpit. This
helps to make an active enter-
tainment calendar for the
tavern

Jamie Small, chairman of the
U.C.C. explains how his com-
mittee functions. ‘“‘We have
about $2,300 a semester in our
budget that goes for entertain-
ment in the Cockpit. The way it
usually works is a student will
approach us with a band that is
available for a certain date and
we have to make a decision on
whether the band is good
enough. We have an open
meeting at 7:00 p.m. every
Monday night in the Cockpit
and we urge students to attend.
We desire student input.’’

As the percent of freshmen
that join fraternities drops
across the nation and at
Washington and Lee, the
Cockpit will be looked to as a
source of entertainment in-
creasingly more in the future.
The way Darrell is running the
Cockpit, it doesn’t look as if
students should have much
trouble finding something to do.

SAC Imbalance Discussec

by Alan Kendrick

A proposal to correct an im-
balance of votes on the Student
Affairs Committee was brought
before the University Council
meeting yesterday afternoon.

Tim Brooks, one of the five
student members of SAC,
declared that the administra-
tion had had a 5-4 advantage in
SAC, voting when Dean Huntley
could not attend, while no stu-
dent voted for head dormatory
counselor Dan Carrucci, who
has been unable to attend a
single meeting this term due to
a schedule conflict.

Brooks proposed that a per-
manent student alternative be
selected from vice-presidents of
the represented committees.

After some debate, an alter-'

native motion was _ intoduce:
and passed to bar any voting i
place of regular members of th
SAC.

Changes in the academi:
calendar to be acted on at th:
next Faculty EC meeting wer
endorsed by the UC. Thre
changes were effected in th
new calendar:

(Freshmen orientation wil
start six days later, or Tuesday
of the week following Labo:
Day, and extend six days in
stead of the present seven)
Classes will begin on Monday
two weeks after Labor Day
This will hopefully relieve pro
fessors of the inconvenient
basis for making weekly plans
The examination schedule wil.
return to the normal plan
beginning on Saturday after
noon.

In Memoriam

Hiland

Newton
Moore

1959-1979

Society is a recurring topic in many of Hike’s
literary efforts. He questioned the sanctity of society
and dared to cut across its grain. The following poem
was written by Hike in December of 1978.

Hike Moore was raised in Lynchburg, Va. He
graduated from E.C. Glass High School, and in the
fall of 1977 he enrolled in Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. He loved to play frisbee in the street and soccer
in the hall. He enjoyed golf and was a member of
Oakwood Country Club. He was a Parkway driver
who toured the Blue Ridge with his friends on sunny
afternoons and starry nights.

Society

Downstairs there is no music

No voice of sweet pleasure.

But there is society, as silent as hell;
[hear it, yet physically it is not there.

Hike was a persistent person, whether studying or

at a party, he gave it his all. He had a nucleus of close:
friends, whome he cared a great deal for. One of’
Hike’s most outstanding qualities was his literary
ability. He was an avid reader and spent a large por-
tion of his time composing poetry and writing short
stories. In his writing he displayed a great sense of
perception and a high degree of sensitivity for the
world he lived in. He forced himself to see, feel and
articulate the inconsistencies and failures of our
society.

Now give mea bottle, a joint or a toot.

Let me imagine a solitude in this house,

No sunshine seeps through my window,

Like its acquaintance, it has crossed the
street.

Do I dare kill a relative, or spill my wine;
Shall I get arrested, or attend church without
a tie?

No one will hear me, but society will tell.

That wicked gossip, as silent as hell.

 

Hike Moore’s poetry will be
featured in the fall edition of
Ariel in December.

 

 

 

The rumor will fly, wetting many a tongue,

So wretched an act—I knew his parents well,
He came from such a fine family—stocks and
bonds you know,

But of course they’re not members here, they
belong to the public club.

Two weeks ago Hike wrote a poem entitled ‘‘Chang-
ing Leaves.’’ This poem describes a late-night trip he
and a companion took to the Parkway.

Changing Leaves

Society ran its trap, caught the news before
the press,

No one said a word, the buzz went away.
There was no solitude that society refused to
accept.

So I shot myself, alone, while all of society
slept.

Stand on a mountain peak

dawn rising up on one corner
darkness fading down the other
We stood, just we

mothers wailed as their calfs fed.

Empty streets fill

up with laughter in darkness
Casually we stroll,

One hand in your pocket,

the other catching Stars!

The city dissipates.

The trees laughed to see it gone.
Then turned a piercing glance
Toward Katherine’s Knob.

We stood, We embraced and stood
And casually smiled,

Then laughed at the rising sun.
One hand ina pocket

The other catching stars.

The death of Hike Moore should force us all to stop
and examine the world we live in. Should we redefine
our values, are we searching for whatever it is in life
that is truly important? Can we learn to love and to be
loved—for human’s sake alone? The following poem
was written by a member of Hike’s family.

Dear Hike

You saw society
at tea
at cocktail buffet.
You chose not to join
should we?
Words for the living
the surviving herd
Society can as we will
Society will as we allow
We—Society
Dear Hike

Sinister cat-eyes took out
The laughter. We stopped.
But laughed at the darkness.
We took out the dullness.
You and I.

Laughter.

Vincents’ red night

Fired out.

Vincents’ final plight

cast down in laughter.

One was scared

One was cas’

It’s time to put the capsules out,

Hold me warm and make the morning sprout.

Till the time capsules sprout
Hold me in darkness

See the topaz

Be blinded by

The Technicolor rainbow
And laugh!

Mock Convention Report

Republican Director Addresses State Chairmen

Hold me warm

Hold me in darkness
Blind me.

Know the laughter

in my Technicolor eyes!

 

 

The director of Local Elec-
tions for the Republican Na-
tional Committee addressed a
group of State Chairmen for
W&L’s Mock Republican Con-
vention Oct. 25.

Joe Gaylord, head of the divi-
sion of the Republican Party
responsible for targeting impor-
tant state and local election con-
tests, spoke on procedures for
the Republican National Con-
vention, the relative im-
portance of primaries and state
caucuses, and national conven-
tion psychology.

Mr. Gaylord shared his wide
experience and knowledge of
Conventions with the state
chairmen. He held important
positions at the 1968, 1972, and
1976 Republican National Con-
ventions. In 1976 he served as
executive director for the Rules
Committee, one of most power-
ful and prestigious committees,
and is expected to be named to a
similar position for the 1980
Convention.

Mr. Gaylord told the group

how a convention is organized,
beginning with the naming of
committees on arrangements,
contests, and credentials, rules,
resolutions (platform), and per-
manent organization.

He explained why the
Republicans chose Detroit as
the convention city over other
contenders, which included
Dallas and New Orleans
(Detroit and its recently com-
pleted Renaissance Center pro-
vided the the best facilities and
demonstrated that’ the
Republican Party wasn’t aban-
doning Northern urban areas).

About two-thirds of the states
will hold presidentail primaries
in 1980 while the remainder will
have state-wide caucuses and
conventions. The latter group
proves more difficult to
research. Mr. Gaylord in-
dicated that governors and
other state-wide officeholders
usually wield the power in these
non-primary states.

Discussion of changes in par-
ty rules and election laws pro-

vided the state chairmen with a
great deal of information. For
example, Mr. Gaylord main-
tained that in the Illinois
primary, delegate slates will
not be listed with the name of
the candidate they intend to
support. This means that II-
linois voters will not know
which dandidate they are
casting their vote for unless
they know the persons running
for delegate positions. The ef-
fect: people will vote for the
names they recognize, meaning
state-wide elected officials
most of whom are supporting
John Connally.

An issue Mr. Gaylord believes
will return to the forefront in
1980 is the so-called ‘‘16-C ques-
tion” where a presidential can-
didate would be forced to name
his running mate before the
convention balloting begins.

It was precisely this issue
that Ronald Reagan used to
challenge Gerald Ford in 1976
after Reagan had named Penn-
sylvania Senator Richard

Schweiker as his running mate.
Reagan is thought to be par-
ticularly interested in the “‘16-C
question’ because of the belief
that he is too old to be president.
But on the other hand, Mr.
Gaylord pointed out the dilem-
na a candidate might face if he
is asked to abandon his cam-
paign and become a vice
presidential candidate before
the convention.

The Illinois primary, the
ninth primary in 1980, will be
held on March 18 and Mr.
Gaylord said he believes that
this will be the last primary for
several contenders. The can-
didates worth particular atten-
tion, according to Mr. Gaylord:
Reagan, Connally Baker, Bush,
and Dole.

Mr. Gaylord said that Philip
Crane is more interested in the
1984 election and Congressman
John Anderson was simply try-
ing to prevent the Republican
Party from excluding its
moderate and liberal wings.

Hamlet Triumphs In Troubadour

by Parker Potter

Lee Kahn’s Hamlet, playing
in the Troubadour Theater
through Saturday, is a triumph
beyond all possible expecta-
tions. The entire cast and crew
of this sumptuous production
cannot be praised too highly.

Shakespeare is always a dif-
ficult assignment and Hamlet is
one of Shakespeare’s longest
and most complex plays. Given
these difficulties as well as the
limitations one should expect in
a small school drama depart-
ment, the prospect of Hamlet in
the Troub was a frightening
one.

And I’m here to say that
Kahn’s Hamlet isn’t just good
by W&L standards, it is a fine
production by any standards

The key to the success of the
play is Kahn’s direction. The
degree to which the entire cast
has integrated language and
meaning, words and actions, is
breathtaking. Kahn’s
characters, and in particular
Grant Kunkowski’s Hamlet,
don’t recite lines; rather they
live and breath the poetry of
passionately living people.

Perhaps the real hallmark of
this production is the seeming
ease with which the whole thing
is carried off. Everyone who ap-

Benefit Concert

pears on stage, from the prin-
ciples down through the
messengers, looks and sounds
comfortable in the
Elizabethean idiom. Which br-
ings me to the next point.

The decision to do Hamlet in
traditional dress with
Shakespeare’s language was a
sound one indeed. The cast’s
mastery of the language
meshes with the impeccable
costuming both of which in turn
work along with Tom Eiegier’s
intelligently and imaginatively
conceived set to make the
Troubador stage truly and com-
pletely the world of
Shakespeare’s Hamlet. And
that world is well peopled.
Grant Kunkowski’s Hamlet is a
performance of which any actor
could be proud. So complete is
his command of the language
that we don’t ever see the strug-
gle of an actor in a difficult
part—we see the torments of
Hamlet writ on Kunkowski’s
face. Kunkowski’s movements
on the stage, the way he gives
over every fiber of himself to
Hamlet is superb.

However, we are prepared for
Kunkowski’s masterful Hamlet
by Stan Nolan and Kurt Kam-
merer as Bernardo and Horatio
in the opening moments of the
play. These two, in the early go-

ing, don’t shout chunks of
Shakespeare at each other,
rather they make of
Shakespeare’s poetry the con-
versation it was always meant
to be.

Terry Frankenberger and
Beth Kahn as the King and
Queen of Denmark work well.
Frankenberger in particular br-
ings a certain needed loud
flashiness to the regal, but
greasy Claudius. His pomposity
is exactly that of a man at the
head of a train of such crazed
courting as his.

David Jones and Nelson Ould
as Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern a.k.a. Chip and
Dale, along with Rob Davis’
Polonius are both diverting and
informative. Most importantly,
these three actors have con-
structed complete and unified
characters, not the usual light
figures who wilt after a suc-
cessful bit of mugging.

Sherry Moore distinguishes
herself as Ophelia. She handles
with ease the range of emotions
required of her and really.
shines at the end when she is
deranged by the death of her
father. As her brother Laertes,
Frank Billingsly turns in a
solid, sincere performance.

Richard Boaz, as the Ghost of
Hamlet’s father is absolutely

together over the past three
years (there was. one
memorable night in a Holiday
Inn in Cleveland, as well...).

Their acoustical guitar ex-
changes and harmonies are
rooted deeply in traditional folk
music, and when revived by
their personal interpreations,
prove most entertaining.

Rohr’s original songs possess
unique story-telling ability
coupled with his rich warm
voice, and Datz’s_ tasty
background licks offer many
listening delights. And when
these boys play an instrumen-
tal, it goes through the wash
and comes out spanking clean!

riviting. His expressions, his
erie appearances and disap-
pearances and especially his
speeches make him nothing
short of mesmerizing, as a
ghost should be.

A word must be said about the
close of the play. One of
Shakespeare’s most monumen-
tal bloodbaths, this scene
couldn’t have been played bet-
ter by this cast, and I suspect,
rarely has been played better

by any cast. .

At the outset of the play I was
tremendously impressed with
the way it came out of the
blocks. Its fine start made me
wonder when the wheels would
come off. They never did. The
mood was a harmonious >* the
end of the play as it was at the
beginning.

Lee Kahn and his cast have
achieved a stunning dramatic
achievement. Period.

 

Record Review

 

by Mark Kinniburgh

A strange new sound has
begun to settle in the U.S. Some
call it a combination of David
Bowie, Brian Eno, Kraftweck
and Ultravox, but those who
know call it Gary Norman and
the Tubeway Army.

The band consists of Gary
Norman and various other folks
who happen to suit the music
mood of the hour. Gary Norman
does all the pre-production
work, all engineering coordina-
tion and plays guitars,
keyboards and all modes of syn-
thesizer.

The current U.S. exposure of
Gary Norman is_ the
albumReplicas with the song
“Are Friends Electric?’ The
entire album was _ recorded
while Norman was involved in
the production of blue-hean
commercials in England, and it
is in England that he is an un-
qualified star.

In the middle of July of this
year, the albumReplicas and the
single ‘‘Are Friends Electric?’’
were at the top of the British
album and single charts. Only
10 weeks later, he repeated his
feat with the albumPleasure
Principle and single ‘‘Cars.”’

The music is the big draw
with Gary Norman, as he is only
now beginning to tour the U.K.
in anticipation of an early 1980
tour of the United States. The
music then, is future rock-

 

synthesizer oriented with a

Gary Norman’s Sound

good does of paranoid lyrics
about robots, clones,
dehumanization and the aspects
of a gloomy high tech future.

The music of Gary Norman is
easily misunderstood, as is his
own personal manner which
borders on schizophrenic. All
this contributes to a rise in
public interest toward him, and
in translation, record sales.

At 21, Gary Norman is very
young to have been the holder of
two gold albums and singles,
but he is not a novice at the
record business. After signing
his first contract, he said “‘If I’d
started playing the stuff I do
now, I’d never got anywhere.
Get signed, and then you’re in
and can do what you want.”’
Replicas is currently number
124 on the Billboard chart, and
has been rising since its entry in
the middle of September.

Notes: The MUSE concert
film which was made at the
September shows in Madison
Square Garden will be released
in late spring, 1980. Although a
writer has yet to be procured
for the film, swift production
has been promised through a
$400,000 budget and a volunteer
staff of no-nuke radicals. The
major problem with the whole
deal-record and film, is the
balance between music and ac-
tivism, as some sides want
more political content as oppos-
ed to a musical good time which
might hold up the release of the

Ibum!

Film Society To Present Comedy

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film Society will pre-
sent its second feature of the season, Louis
Malle’s French comedyThe Murmur of the
Heart, this Friday and Saturday. The movie will
be screened at 8 p.m. in classroom ‘‘A’’ (note
change of room) of the Law School, free of
charge, and everyone is cordially invited to at-
tend.

Louis Malle, who is also the director of the
recently distributed Pretty Baby, has a history
of making movies on taboo subjects. Through his
de-sensationalized treatment potentially unsettl-
ing subjects are humanized and made moving.
For instance, his early movie The Lovers (1958),
with Jeanne Moreau, helped break the ground
for a frank presentation of sexuality in serious
film.

Malle’s The Murmur of the Heat (1971) is one
‘of the gems of cinema history. It is what would

appear at first to be an unpromising paradox: a
comedy about incest.

The plot concerns a young adolescent boy
whose “‘heart murmur” forces him to drop out of
school for a year. He spends the year at home in
increasingly greater closeness with his mother,
who is played by the ravishingly beautiful Lea
Massari.

With typically French deftness and drollery.
Malle shows the boy having his first sexual ex-
perience, with his mother, and then getting up
and finding himself a girlfriend of his own age.
This is one of a very few works of art that have
the wit and the courage to imagine a way out of
the oedipal triangle.

The Film Society’s next movie is Werner Her
zog’s treatment of the myth of the wild or feral
child, The Mystery of Kasper Hauser, set out
December 7 and 8. The next meeting of the Socie-
ty will take place November 13 at 7:30 p.m. in
Payne 3. We will be selecting winter films. and
all members are invited to attend

 

 

Film Notes

Soylent Green (MGM, 1973) Charlton Heston stars as a New York
cop in this futuristic drama about the struggles of man after a
. nuclear holocaust. There is no plant life, people live in automobiles
and even worse. Presented by the SAB, Friday, Saturday and Sun-
day, at 7 and 9 p.m. in classroom ‘‘C’’ of Lewis Hall. Admission is
$1.00.

The Murmur of the Heart (French, 1972) A comedy of incest and
adolescence, directed by Louis (Pretty Baby) Malle. A further
discussion appears in this issue of the Ring-tum Phi. Presented by
the Film Society, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. in classroom ‘‘A”’
of Lewis Hall. No admission will be charged.

The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (British, 1962) An ear-
ly film by Tony Richardson, adapted from Alan Sillitoe’s highly
class-conscious, anti-establishment novel. Faithful to the original,
and brilliantly acted by a cast which includes Tom Courtenay, it
lacks the staginess so common in Richardson’s early works. To be
shown in Reid 203 on Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m. Admission if free.

Movie Review

Concorde ‘79 Is One
Airport Too Many

by Dash Coufal

 

The Concorde Airport ’79
Directed by David Lowel Rich
Written by Eric Roth

With George Kennedy, Alain
Delon, Susan Blakely and
Robert Wagner

Another jaunt into the world
of the rich, famous and power-
ful that once again comes off as
tacky.

Remember the thirties when
Hollywood set the styles of the
nation? Well, that era is long
past, as this movie so blatantly
shows.

The plot, tenuous at best, goes
something like this: Robert
Wagner is trying to shoot down
the Concorde, en route from
Washington to Paris to the
Moscow Olympics, because a
woman reporter on_ board,
Susan Blakely, has papers that
prove Wagner authorized il-
legal arms sales by his corpora-
tion.

First Wagner tries a cruise
missle, then a private Phanton
jet, then an internal device. Stir
into this numerous sub-plots,
and cameos with sub-sub-plots
such as: a Russian gymnastics
team on board, a human heart
on ice, the crews’ private lives,
and the fact that almost

Now you know what’s going to
happen: everything turns out
OK. Every sub-plot and sub-
sub-plot turns out for the best.
This is a complete lack of hones-
ty on the part of the movie.

With so much going on at
least some of it could go sour,
just to give the movie honesty,
not to mention that there is no
real danger to the plane. Let’s
make an Airport movie where
the plane goes down just to give
the series some honesty.

The sets, lines, and women
are equally cheap. Most of the
scenes not filmed on the plane
or on location look like they
were filmed in a Howard
Johnson's. The hotel rooms look
cheap with polyester carpeting
on the floor.

The lines are too dumb to
even remember; not once does

anyone, not even Robert
Wagner, have a snappy line.
And the women all look to be
rich chippies. Why is it that only
Harold Robins’ movies have
that touch of class?

The movie isn’t even thrilling.
Since we know that the plane
couldn't go down, it ceases to be
at all exciting. For thrills go see
Dawn Of The Dead.

A temptingly tasteful
comedy for adults

If you buy the old paper-chase
idea that America’s law
students are all work and no
play, stick around this
weekend.

A pair of them at Washington
and Lee University will become
“‘players”’ in the literal sense on
Saturday (Nov. 3) when they of-
fer a review of the American
popular song, from ragtime to
swing. Their extravaganza,
‘Jackie and Phil: Words and
Music,”’ will be presented free
in duPont Auditorium on the
W&L front campus at 8 p.m.

Jackie Boyden, soprano, and
Phil Calderone, pianist, will
begin their tour through the na-
tion’s musical memories with
the Nashville rags of the 1890s,
‘‘a school characterized by a
mix of black folk sources and
white Tennessee hill music,”
according to Calderone.

From there, the program will
cover many of the high spots of
American pop and show music
— from the Gershwins (‘‘Em-
braceable You”’ and ‘‘Our Love
is Here To Stay’) through Cole
Porter (‘I’ve Got You Under
My Skin” and ‘‘I Get a Kick Out
of You’’) to Rogers and Hart
(‘‘Where or When’’ and ‘‘Bewit-
ched’’) and the swing-era sound
of Duke Ellington and Billy
Strayhorn (‘‘I Got It Bad and
That Ain’t Good’ and ‘Take
The A Train’’).

Both weekend showmen are
third-year law students at W&L.
Boyden, an honors graduate of
the University of Michigan, is
from Grand Rapids. Calderone,
from Merrick, N.Y., is a magna
cum laude graduate of the
University of Virginia.

Their production is sponsored
by Phi Delta Phi legal fraterni-
ty. The public is invited to at-
tend.

everybody knows each other
(’’Ah, yes, that plane crash out-
side Salt Lake City in ’75...’’)

Babe Was Wrong?

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Willie Mays said he was bewildered. Frank Sinatra
called it an outrage. And W&L’s Chuck Strome billed
it as his ‘‘Boo of the Week.”’

In a seemingly unreasonable and unfair decision,
Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered Hall of
Famer Willie Mays to sever all connections with
baseball. Kuhn’s verdict was made in light of Mays’
decision to sign a multi-million-dollar contract with
the Park Place Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.

Because Mays will be connected with a gambling
firm—although Mays will in no way be directly af-
filiated with the gambling operations—Kuhn told
Mays to relinquish his working ‘‘sweet-heart’’ agree-
ment with the New York Mets.

Mays said he made his decision to work for the hotel
in consideration of what would be better for his fami-
ly. His contract with the Mets called for $50,000 a year

for 10 years after his retirement. The Park Place con-
tract is for $100,000 a year for three years with a pro-
vision for an additional seven years at an escalating
salary that could go as high as $150,000.

Why has the commissioner forced the greatest
centerfielder to ever put on a pair of spiked shoes to
disassociate himself from the game he loved and
served so dearly? I guess because the commissioner
feels that Mays’ duties with the hotel would conflict
with his duties with the Mets. He felt Willie’s connec-
tion with the hotel would give baseball a bad name.

But do not several baseball owners also own and
race thoroughbred horses? Did not Dick Allen own
and train race horses while still a part-time player?
Isn’t this considered to be an affiliation with gambl-
ing? Is the casino less respectable than Belmont Park
or Churchill Downs?

What is really distressing is that Atlantic City is not
off limits to other baseball people, only Willie Mays.
Other players have access to both casinos and race
tracks across the country. And Willie Mays doesn’t
even gamble!

Mays’ duties for the hotel will range from shaking
hands with celebrities to visiting children in hospitals
and serving as master of ceremonies at the annual
hotel picnic.

Also, Mays is no longer an active player and is not
that close to the game anymore. It is doubtful that a
part-time coach and a good-will ambassador for the
Mets could throw a ballgame. The Mets don’t need
any help throwing games—they throw away 100
games a year without Willie’s help.

Mays made a smart decision in signing with the
hotel. It is an all-around sound offer which should
benefit Willie, his family and the hotel.

Kuhn made a not-so-smart decision. I cannot
understand how he could think that Willie Mays could
embarrass baseball. Many fans across the country
are outraged with the commissioner’s decision.

He has told Willie Mays—the same Willie Mays who
thrilled baseball fans with his amazing fielding and
his potent hitting for 22 years—that he must
disassociate himself from the game. Mays has pro-
bably done more for baseball than all of the commis-
sioners put together.

Willie Mays devoted his life to baseball—as a
player, as a coach and as a good-will ambassador. Is
this how baseball repays him? Is his goodwill no
longer good enough?

Babe Ruth once said, “Baseball is a great game.
Give it all you have all the time. Be good to
baseball and baseball will be good to you.’’ Willie
Mays was good to baseball—he gave it all he had.

Maybe the Babe was wrong.

 

 

Generals Dunked 7-4;
Richmond State Champs

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
travelled to Richmond last
weekend to compete in the
Virginia State Championships.
Despite winning four games
against only one loss, they
finished the tournament second
to the University of Richmond.

The Generals defeated
Hampden-Sydney, Richmond’s
JV, and Virginia twice.
However, they lost to arch-rival
Richmond, who ended up the
tournament winners.

The weekend’s games
brought W&L’s record to 17-3
going into the Southern League
Championships which will be
played this weekend at W&L.
The General water polo team
holds the number-one seed for
the tournament.

W&L Coach Page Remillard
had ‘‘mixed feelings’’ about last
weekend’s tournament. He feels
that some of the other teams in
the state, and Virginia water
polo in general, would benefit
more from what he calls a
“developmental tournament.’’
He feels that the obvious
dominance over the rest of the
teams in the state by W&L and
Richmond necessitates a tour-
nament in which these teams
are not allowed to play. Instead
he feels that the two schools
should send only their JV teams
to this tournament in the in-
terest of “developing water polo
in the state of Virginia.”

Against Richmond last
weekend, the Generals played
well despite coming out on the
short end of a 7-4 score. In the
words of Coach Remillard, ‘‘We
got all the bad _ breaks.”
However, he was pleased with
his team’s overall performance
for the game and the tourna-
ment.

Commenting on the team’s of-
fense, Remillard praised the
play of Trip Johnson, who show-
ed great improvement as an of-
fensive threat and who was one

of the team’s most consistent
scorers. Remillard also men-
tioned the defensive play of
senior standout Mike Foley,
who held Richmond’s key offen-
sive player to one point.

The Generals, although they
would have like to win last
weekend, put the main im-
portance for the season on the
upcoming league tournament.
Teams competing in the tourna-

ment are: Georgia Southern,
Duke, Richmond, and W&L.

~ nament.

Remillard expects to get by
GSU in their match Saturday at
10 a.m. after which they should
take on the winner of the Duke-
Richmond game at 4 p.m.

As usual, beating Richmond
is the key to victory in the tour-
Remillard believes
that the Generals can and will
do it. He encourages fan sup-
port and promises quality water
polo, saying, ‘“We have momen-
tum, confidence, and the talent
to do the job.”’

Pushing For Bermuda

by Bill Hogan

While most of the W&L com-
munity will be going home dur-
ing the upcoming February
break, the 1980 varsity lacrosse
team will be flying south to Ber-
muda for a nine-day ‘‘vaca-
tion.”

According to. senior
defenseman Steve Johnson, the
trip will not be all fun and
games as head coach Jack Em-
mer has scheduled two-a-day
practice sessions for each day.
The agenda calls for the team to
leave for Bermuda on February
16th from Roanoke Airport.
They will return home on
February 24 in time to resume
classes.

While in Bermuda, the
Generals will stay in a
dormitory-type facility set up
by the Ministry of Sports in an
attempt to keep housing costs
down. The team will bring
enough food with them to last

 

the entire vacation. This will
also help keep costs at a
minimum.

“I think the trip will definitely
help the team get ready for the
season,’’ said senior co-captain
Bob Clements. ‘‘The warm
weather will allow us to prac-
tice outdoors whereas here we
spend a lot of time indoors
because of snow.’’ The players
generally agree that the trip
certainly compensates for prac-

ticing during the vacation.

Coach Emmer estimates the
trip to cost around $7,500, which
the lacrosse team is raising at
present. The Generals have
been selling lacrosse hats and
are planning a marathon ‘‘bed-
push” from Hollins College to
Zollman’s Pavillion on Sunday,
where the team will celebrate
their feat with a party. The
“bed-push” is scheduled to
begin at 5 a.m. Sunday.

Bridgewater Stomps W&L;
Generals Last In ODAC

by Dale Park
The Bridgewater Eagles foot-
ball team ended a nine-game
dry spell against the Generals,
handing W&L a 19-3 loss on
Wilson Field and dropping the
Generals’ ODAC record to 1-4.

The Eagles had not beaten the
Generals in the first nine
meetings between these two
teams. But the 1,733 W&L fans
watched a W&L team that was
plagued by untimely errors and
missed opportunities.

“Last week we lost our con-
centration at key times,” said
head coach Gary Fallon. “We
let them have a few big plays on
offense and gave them the ball
on defense.”

The Generals’ problem was
two-fold. First, they coughed up
the ball twice and both fumbles
were costly.

W&L fumbled the ball on its
own 19-yard line during its very
first offensive series. Eagles’
kicker Dan Callaghan quickly
put Bridgewater on top 3-0 with
a 30-yard field goal. Callaghan
later added a 25-yarder in the
opening seconds of the second
period, giving the Eagles a 6-0
lead.

A second W&L fumble was to
prove even more costly. Early
in the fourth quarter, the
Generals had driven to the
Bridgewater one yard line only
to furnble the ball out of the
Eagles’ endzone. The ensuing
touchback moved the ball out to
the Bridgewater 20-yard line,
giving the Eagles the ball and
killing a golden scoring op-
portunity for the Generals.

The second of W&L’s pro-
blems was interceptions. Three
W&L passes were picked off due
largely to the tenacious Eagles’
front four which put pressure on
W&L’s quarterbacks all after-
noon.

Bridgewater defensive back
Kevin Wholey had a field day,
picking off two W&L passes and
running the first back 56 yards
for a touchdown. Callaghan’s
conversion gave the Eagles a
13-0 lead with 12:26 left in the
first half.

 

Harriers

Beat H-S

The Washington & Lee cross
country team managed a close
22-33 win over rival Hampden-
Sydney in a dual meet last
Saturday at W&L.

The Generals were led by
their captain, senior Rich Bird,
who paced the team with a
second-place finish.

The Generals will face
Hampden-Sydney again this
weekend when they travel to
Farmville to run in the fourth
annual ODAC Championship.
Saturday’s meet, which starts
at 11 a.m., will feature seven
schools on a five-mile course.

 

 

 

 

Tight end Syd Farrar hauls in a pass against Bridgewater. W&L is
at home Saturday against Maryville.

Four General quarterbacks
saw action during the after-
noon; sophomores Jim Wenke
and Rich Hachenburg, and
freshmen Chris Cavalline and
Jeff Snyder. In all, they combin-
ed for 131 yards through the air.

Equally impressive was
W&L’s 207 yards rushing
spearheaded by senior tailback
Stewart Atkinson. Atkinson
gained 108 yards on 20 carries,
upping his season’s rushing
total to 760 yards.

Freshman kicker Bill Devine
remained flawless for the
Generals, giving W&L its only
points of the afternoon by con-
verting on a 30-yard field goal
attempt as the first half ran out.
His boot cut the Eagles’ lead to
13-3.

Although the Generals
outgained the Eagles in total of-
fense, 273 to 258 yards, W&L
was beaten by the big play.

The Eagles drove to midfield
in the opening minutes of the se-
cond half, where Bridgewater
quarterback Duanne Harrison
threw a a pass to his wide
receiver Joe Kunlo.

The General defensive back
made a good play on the ball,
batting it with his hands. Yet
the ball struck Kunlo sharply in
the chest, and bounced into his
hands. After juggling the ball
for several yards, the Eagle
receiver somehow maintained
possession and raced the re-
mainder of the field to complete
a 50-yard touchdown pass play.
Callaghan’s conversion was
blocked, and the score remain-
ed 19-3 for the rest of the game.

“We can’t have these slip-ups
if we’re to give Maryville a
challenge next week,’ said
Fallon. ‘‘Maryville runs from a
wing and I-slot on offense and
has two fine running backs in
Ken Adair and Alvin Nance.
They are impressive on film
and will be as tough as last
year.”

One of the reasons the Scots
will remain tough is that 15 of
last years 22 starters are retur-
ning. Maryville was a big win-
ner last week, beating
Southwestern Tennessee 294.

As I See It ..
What Happened?

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

What happened last Saturday on Wilson Field is
almost beyond belief. Washington & Lee lost to
Bridgewater. That’s right, Bridgewater — the same
team the Generals had not lost to in nine previous
meetings on the gridiron. But all good things must
come to an end, which happened last Saturday.

Before I analyze last Saturday’s results, let me tell
you a little bit about Bridgewater. The Eagles were a
2-4 team that had lost 18-6 to Emory & Henry (a team
W&L lost to by six) and 27-10 to Hampden-Sydney (a
team W&L beat 20-0). In other words, Bridgewater is
one of those teams you want to schedule for
Homecoming weekend. Bridgewater is also one of
those teams you look at before the season and count
on as being a guaranteed win. At least, this is what
most of us in the pressbox were thinking before the
game started. Two hours later, we didn’t know what
to think.

Last Saturday, the Generals ran more offensive
plays, gained more first downs, outrushed and out-
passed the opposition and even held the ball longer.
But when the final gun went off, the Generals had lost,
19-3.

The only apparent reason for this loss was that
W&L was a flat football team on Saturday. Perhaps it
was an underestimation of the opposition or perhaps
it was a continuing state of depression from the
Sewanee game, but the Generals simply did not have
their act together against Bridgewater.

Offensively, W&L played a statistically good game.
But sometimes statistics don’t tell the real story.
Along with an advantage in plays and yardage, the
Generals also had three big turnovers — three ugly
plays which changed the game’s outcome.

The first turnover came with the ball on W&L’s 38.
The ensuing fumble gave Bridgewater the ball on the
18. Four plays later, it was 3-0.

The second mistake occurred with the score 6-0 and
the ball on W&L’s 44. A poorly thrown sideline pass
was converted into a 47-yard interception return and
a 13-0 Bridgewater lead.

The final mishap was the one which killed any
hopes of a W&L comeback. With the ball on the
Bridgewater five, the Generals ran the ball down to
the one and fumbled it out of the endzone. This hap-
pened early in the fourth quarter and kept W&L a
comfortable 16 points away.

Without these three turnovers, a 19-3 disadvantage
could, instead, have been a 10-10 deadlock.

Besides the turnovers, one other statistic tells why
the Generals lost. W&L used four quarterbacks while
Bridgewater stayed with one signal-caller. Last
Saturday, it was clear that W&L could not find one
player to effectively run the offense.

Candidate number one, Jim Wenke, completed four
of ten passes for 75 yards and two interceptions. Can-
didate number two, Chris Cavalline, completed three
of seven for 33 yards and one interception. Candidate
number three, Rich Hachenburg, two for two, gaining
28 yards. Candidate number four, Jeff Snyder, com-
pleted three of four passes for twenty-five yards.

Overall, the four quarterbacks completed 12 of 21
passes for 131 yards and a lot of confusion. What the
offense needed was one quarterback, not four, who
could do it all.

Bridgewater had one quarterback who could do it
all — which is why they came out on top. Duane Har-
rison threw the long ball (a 50 yard TD pass), he
threw short passes and was quick enough to escape
big losses. He also was a lot luckier than the W&L
signal-callers.

Jim Wenke is a good veer quarterback who can also
throw an occasional short pass. Chris Cavalline is a
good wishbone quarterback who is more of a runner

by Kip Gordon

About this time last year,
W&L freshman Bill Devine was
a high school place-kicker who
could be generously described
as average. Yet one year later,
he is a college level place-
kicker whose performance has
been flawless. The adjustment
which Devine made during that
year made him a blue-chip foot-
ball player and brought the
Generals their first barefoot
kicker.

Devine explained: ‘‘I figured
if Tony Franklin could set the
NCAA record for the longest
field goal kicking barefoot, then
it was worthatry.”’

He did most of his work on the
new style over the summer,
receiving the coaching of VMI
All-American _ place-kicker
Craig Jones. Jones was able to
instruct him on the technical
aspects of placekicking as
Devine, in fact, knows little
about the mechanics of booting
a football.

 

The results of his work speak
for themselves. Devine has yet
to miss a field goal or extra
point in six attempts for each.
His longest field goal was 40
yards (four yards short of the

school record) and he_ has
booted a 55-yarder in practice.

Devine attributes some of his.
success to the fact that, unlike
his high school program, he can
now devote all the time he needs
to his place-kicking. This prac-
tice time usually involves about
forty-five minutes each day,

In ODAC

conference. This was good
enough for a second place finish
while Lynchburg won the con-

ference title, which the
Generals captured in 1978.
Against Lynchburg, the

Generals were plagued by the
same problems which have
haunted them all season long.
Their offense simply could not
get untracked. The Generals
could only muster six shots on
goal while Lynchburg wore
down W&L,s defense with 20
shots.

The Generals went through
three goalkeepers in giving up
the three goals. Player of the
game for the Generals was
defender Homer Bliss.

The varsity’s next opponent
will be VMI in a match to be
played this Sunday on Wilson
Field. Game time for the
General's final home game is 2
p.m.

alone on Wilson field, before
joining the rest of the team for
regular practice.

Most of the improvement, of
course, seems to be due to the
switch to the barefoot style,
which Devine claims has
drastically improved his ac-
curacy.

There are, however, a
number of problems that can
accompany this unique kicking
style. Striking the wrong part of
the ball or getting stepped on
can each produce disabling ef-

fects.

Outdoors:

Kicking Up A Storm

' But one of Devine’s main con-
cerns is the weather. ‘‘So far
I’ve been lucky...I’m not really
sure what it would belike to kick
in cold weather.”

He is certain, however, that
without the switch to barefoot
kicking he would not be playing
for the football Generals. Of
course, there was the case of an
NFL barefoot kicker who tried:
to remedy the effects of cold
weather during a game played
in Minnesota, numbing his foot
with ice water. Said Devine, ‘‘I
don’t think I’d like that.”

Maryland Geese

by Ross Newell
Guest Columnist

Arriving in Chestertown,
Maryland before daybreak, the
magical sound of goose music
combined with the lapping of
waves on the shoreline to con-
vince me that I had indeed
found a goose hunter’s heaven.

Fifteen minutes passed
before I could pull myself away
from the shore of the Chester
River where the symphony of
thousands of honking geese fill-
ed me with a sense of exhilara-
tion which I usually lack at 5
a.m. Climbing out of bed an
hour later, I was again greeted
by the honking of geese, but now
the symphony was occasionally
accented by distant shotgun
blasts; opening day of the
Maryland goose hunting season
was in full swing.

The goose blind, on the shore
of a cove bordered on two sides
by cut corn fields, had a stand of
about 60 goose decoys bobbing
in front of it. Still 200 yards from
the blind, I watched, trying to
take in the scene before me. It
was a beautiful fall day and the
blue sky, whitened by whisps of
clouds, was filled by huge flocks
of geese that resembled swarm-
ing gnats more than waterfowl.

Once in the blind, I barely had
time to load my gun before my
buddy uttered several pro-

fanities that caused me to look

up. Wings cupped, necks stret-
ched forward, feet extended,
four huge but graceful Cana-
dian geese were gliding over the
decoys.

You might have heard about
deer hunters getting buck
fever; I’d like to tell you about
goose fever. Looking one of
those big geese square in the
eye, knees shaking, palms
sweating, eyes watering, breath
short and irregular, I stood and

_ missed not one, but three of the

easiest shots I’ve ever had.

However, there was no time
for excuses. Of the thousands of
geese in the air, two had made
up their minds to retest my
nerves. Low on the river in front
of the blind, they came in an un-
wavering path towards the
decoys. At the last minute the
pair of geese gained altitude
and sailed past the decoys and
over the blind.

I knew before I pulled the
trigger that my first shot would
miss. Pressing cheek to the
stock of the gun I looked down
the barrel at the goose grabbing
with powerful wings for
altitude. Swinging in front of
him I pulled the trigger a se-
cond time and my first goose of
the day dropped with a splash in
front of the blind.

For the next two hours the sky
remained filled with geese and
action was nonstop. Accepting
the fact that we were not in a
dream that might at any minute
be ended, my friend and I
assumed the arrogant attitude
of seasoned Maryland goose
hunters. We no longer even
picked up our guns unless the
goose in question presented a
perfect shot at less than 30
yards.

-Perhaps the spirit and ex-
cellence of Maryland goose hun-
ting, and this hunt in particular,
was captured in a single mo-
ment late in the hunt. A lone
goose, typically demonstrating
his species’ aerobatic
gracefulness, sailed into the
decoys. As I stood to shoot, my
buddy said, “Why don’t we let
that one go; he’s mighty
small.”’ Putting my gun down
as the goose landed in the
decoys, I turned to my friend
with a smile and said, ‘“‘Nobody
is ever going to believe us.”’

 

Four QBs Too Many?

(continued from page 7)
than a passer. Rich Hachenburg is a good runner with
better passing skills than Wenke or Cavalline. Jeff
Snyder is potentially the best passer of the four but
needs more playing experience. All four men also
have at least two years of eligibility left after this

season.

What Gary Fallon and his coaching staff must now
do is choose one these quarterbacks and develop a
team around him. Last Saturday, the Generals could
not stick to one offensive style and it hurt them.

Playing one quarterback would eventually produce
a team leader; a take-charge player who could be the
difference between winning and losing. Last Satur-

day, this was the case.

The Ring-tum Phi, November 1, 1979, Page 9

by Todd Smith

Despite flying words and
tempers, the Washington and
Lee Debate Union reconvened
for the year without resolving
the question of whether or not to
recognize the Palestine Libera-
tion Organization.

The only point of agreement
at last Thursday night’s debate
was on the next debate’s topic:
‘‘Resolved, Nuclear Power
should be banned.”’

Arguing for the proposition
that the United States should
recognize the P.L.O., James
Rodriguez briefly traced the
history of the recognition con-
troversy. He cited the P.L.O.’s
recognition by the United Na-
tions and by over a hundred
foreign nations, a number even
greater than those recognizing
Israel.

Todd Smith led the opposi-
tion, questioning whether
P.L.O. leader Yassir Arafat
could retain power if he made
any conciliations to Israel.
Smith claimed recognition of

IPLO Tackled In Debate

the P.L.O. would cause a
resurgence of turmoil in the
Middle East and undo all

previous diplomatic progress.

Then teammate Danny Eins-
tein took the floor to remind the
affirmative side of Henry Kiss-
inger’s promise as Secretary of
State in 1975 that the United
States would not recognize the
’.L0. wet: we F.4.0.
recognized Israel by accepting
U.N. Resolution 242.

Scott Van Dyke rose to defend
the P.L.O. ‘Israel is an
economic drain on the U.S.,”
claimed Van Dyke, and not
worth the trouble it has caused
us among oil-producing nations.
The argument broke into a
heated discussion of Israel’s ex-
panionist policies and the ter-
rorism associated with the
P.L.O.

The debate was chaired by
Sam Perkins, who was forced to
call an end to the proceedings
as the argument strayed fur-
ther from the topic.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

You Can Wear Jeans
To Our Party

Hollins has distributed flyers at Washington and
Lee advertising their Sunday party—and it looks like
the same old song. Janice is playing, and those in-
terested are advised by the posters that one must pay
$4 a person, 40‘ a beer, no BYOB, and no jeans.

NO JEANS! Can you believe it? One can stomach
only so much of a certain attitude. Granted, it’s their
party (we wonder how many Hollins students would
prefer to wear jeans, if they had a say in the deci-
sion). Granted, the party is part of their big weekend.
But when it comes time to stand in line for beer and
tickets, many of us will be footing the bill—just as we
do when we have free (for girls) live bands and free
(for girls) drinks at our fraternity parties and class-
pass parties.

For those who would like a change of pace, the SAB
is sponsoring at the same time what looks like a really
great party at the ‘‘nasty ‘o’ Pavillion.”’ For $2 a per-
son gets two bands, all the beer he wants, and no dress
code. Stillwater and the Boot Hill Express will play
some fine country rock tunes perfect for a Fall Sun-
day afternoon. This is a rare chance for most of us to
take our dates to see something different.

W&L students are a complaining breed, and nothing
receives more complaints than the music here. The
SAB is offering an alternative; those of you who want
more of these types of bands and parties must support
this one. But if you get roped into a situation of double
jeopardy, this is the ‘“‘pay twice syndrome,”’ and come
out feeling like you’ve seen it all before, all we can say
is, ‘“Told you, I told you so...”’

Pass-Fail, Again

We don’t want to repeat ourselves, but we just
thought before the next faculty meeting that we’d put
in another plug for making the pass-fail option
private. We hope the faculty will give serious thought
to relinquishing its control over pass-fail so that just
the student and the registrar have to worry about it.

We’ve heard the arguments extolling the dangers of
students not taking a pass-fail course as seriously as
his other subjects. Surely the faculty realized when
pass-fail was instituted at W&L, limited as it is, that it
was helping to promote experiments in a liberal arts
education by reducing the risks. We think the incen-
tive for choosing a course or examining a different
academic discipline would be further incieased if it
) a matter only between the registrar and the stu-

ent.

More EC Minutia

The student body Executive Committee debate
Monday night over two changes in last week’s EC
minutes resulted in a 6-5 victory for those backing the
corrections. Freshman EC Rep. Edmund Schenecker
was the Edmund Schenecker gave the deciding vote,
which deleted a ‘‘p”’ floating in the left hand margin,
and reworded ‘‘There being no further business to
discuss, the meeting adjourned at 7:35 p.m.” to “Be-
ing that there was no further business to discuss, the
Committee adjourned the meeting at 7:35 p.m.”

Should we consider the EC’s protracted discus-
sion as merely a concentration on the minutia?

 

Letter

To The Editor
More
Grafitti

Dear Editor,

During the past week there
have been at least three in-
stances of grafitti on the cam-
pus academic buildings. It was,
to say the least, sickening.
While I have great respect for
this institution and its tradi-
tions, I have to wonder about
the type of students we now
have here (Yes, I believe
students were responsible for
the acts).

It was no accident, I am sure,
that the grafitti appeared the
same weekend that the Board of
Trustees were meeting. What I
fail to understand are 1) what
the writer was trying to ac-
complish and 2) why some peo-
ple have a need to deface
private property. There is ab-
solutely no justification for such
an act, and this weekend’s ex-
ample could not have been in
poorer taste.

, . Last weekend’s incident br-
oe ings me to another point, not
totally unrelated. There are
many clubs and organizations
on campus that put up posters
advertising meetings and other

Both Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Kappa Alpha fraternities held

ing. By all accounts, both fraternity parties were a big Success and

Congratulations go to both fraternities for their civil-minded spirit.

 

events, and almost each group,
at one time, has had their
posters torn down or written on,
many times within hours of be-
ing posted. Certainly this could
be a technical honor violation.

Persiflage

A Wednesday Night

It’s 6:30 in the evening on a
late October day and already
it’s cold and dark outside. Stark
classical music is on WLUR and
its sound echoes through the
shack that my _ landlord
somehow deems worth more
than $60 a month.

Cars are prowling ominously
outside.

I put down my copy of The
Painted Bird and venture
over to the refrigerator. The
harsh light inside reveals only a
lump of cheese and a rotted
piece of fruit.

I pass by the pictures of
Dostoevski and Solzhenitsyn
hanging in the hallway and
enter my room. The light is out
but I can hear mice scurrying
about as they sense my
presence.

I reach for the bag of goods I
purchased earlier in the day. I
am prepared for the inevitable.

As I head back down the
hallway I hear footsteps on the
gravel outside. I stop in my
tracks. It’s too late to reach the
light in the kitchen to turn it out.
They know I’m here.

I trudge toward the door
reconciling myself to my fate. I
had hoped that somehow I
might be spared, that I
somehow might not be noticed.
No more time for pity — the
pounding on the door is getting

In the current essays marking the 50th an-
niversary of the Crash of ’29, the question, stated
or not, inevitably pops out at the reader: ‘‘Can it
happen now?” The mood of the day might en-
courage such a somber connection of past and
present, even though the raw economic facts
bear little resemblance.

The nation is seen these days to be heading into
a recession, inspiring concern about how deep it
will be. Federal Reserve policy seeks to fight in-
flation by significantly tightening money and
credit, at the expense of a more pronounced
downturn.

 

Both this editorial and Mr. Olipant’s cartoon are
reprinted from The Washington Star, where they
originally appeared on Monday, October 29.

 

Wall Street in the last month has had days of
extreme nervousness, if not panic, with prices
dropping in huge volumes of sales. Strange
clouds are on the horizon: a bruising presidential
contest, an energy crisis that could lead
anywhere, dangers of international confronta-
tion. Economists, formerly confident in their
recommendations, offer humble and divided
counsel.

So there is some coincidence of atmosphere
between now and then, when the boom of the ’20s
started coming apart. It can be dismissed at
that. No one has to treat seriously the resuscita-
tion (in The Wall Street Journal) of a Russian
economist’s theory about economic events hap-
pening in 50-year cycles. The differences bet-
ween 1929 and 1979 are more telling than any ap-
parent similarities.

Take the stock market, whose collapse herald-
ed and in some histories was seen as a cause of
the Great Depression. It’s a different place now,
in part because of government efforts to end
speculative abuses that helped bring on the
Crash. People can no longer buy stock with only
10 percent down. The Securities and Exchange
Commission polices against fraud. Institutional
investors—professionals charged with the care
of funds for the millions—have come to dominate
the buying and selling of securities.

Today’s economic dangers
are plentiful. We hardly

need to revive any from
half a century ago.

 

American society is much changed, and the
economy has many built-in safeguards it didn’t
have to soften violent fluctuations. Economic
policy-makers, whatever their limitations, did
learn from the bitter experiences of 40 or 50
years ago. At least they understand what actions
will tend to make hard times harder.

Does that mean Black Tuesday (October 29,
1929) and its aftermath cannot be repeated? It
takes a brave optimist to make that claim. John
Kenneth Galbraith sees the possibility of another
“cycle of speculation and collapse,”’ despite laws

i.
eee
. ieee

 

against ‘‘the more egregious behavior’ of the
1920s. ‘‘Nothing has been done about the seminal
lunacy that possesses people who see a chance of
becoming rich,” Dr. Galbraith concluded in a re-
cent commemorative piece in THE NEW
REPUBLIC.

Provided we get safely past this anniversary
(one analyst actually blames articles like this for
Wall Street’s recent jitters), other economic
dangers are more deserving of the attention of
professional worriers. Severe inflation is behind
the Federal Reserve's tightening of money and
credit. International oil supplies are subject to
disruption. OPEC’s prices could damage the
world monetary system, not to speak of many
national economies. Some experts fear a col-
lapse of the Eurocurrency market, posing dif-
ficulties for international trade. Today’s
economic dangers are plentiful. We hardly need
to revive any from half a century ago.

 

To avoid a preachy sermonette, (if you
don’t know the term “‘social responsibility’’
by now you deserve the world’s pity) let me
tell you about other schools. Oh, let me see,
how about... Princeton. (Please let one of
those nasty boys from Thursday read this! )

The eating clubs at Princeton such as Ivy
and Cottage are similar to fraternities.
Similar in that some boys live there and other
boys are members. That’s as far as it goes.
The houses are something your mothers
would love. They are well taken care of. The
boys are too, in their jackets and ties.

When you enter the club, oriental rugs,
gilted mirrors, polished staircases and silver
fountains bubbling of various beverages greet
you. If you haven’t seen a real powder room in
a while check out the third floor of Ivy. (The
entire third floor is devoted to the needs and

This sermonette appeared last week in the Sweet
Briar News under the column heading, “From
the Rock.”

 

comforts of female guests). A clean powder
room, not bathroom, with matching chairs
and couches, all of you. That may be a bit
much but I wouldn:t mind going in one now
and then.

What really floors you is the presence of ash
trays. Being overwhelmed by the sight of an
ashtray in a fraternity is a sign of previous
primitive living. Just knowing that we stomp
cigarettes on the floor of someone’s house is
so disgusting. I feel sorry for the guys who
have to wake up to all of that sloshed beer,
sticky floors, and wet cigarette butts.

So Princeton provides ash trays, powder
rooms and the treatment distinct to that of a
lady. I’m not sure we are ready for that. If we
want to be treated like ladies, we had better
start acting like them. Getting drunk is fine.
Most of us do it. But, I think psychologists
have something to say about the future of
those to whom vandalism accompanies in-
ebriation.

Monthly Reports At EC Meeting

(continued from page 1)

Manager Kevin McGowan. ‘‘We
did budget only $1,000 for
subscription fees,” he added,
“but we might end up with
$2,000." The amount currently
stands at $1,887.

Abraham said that he had
talked with Bill Washburn, Ex-
ecutive Secretary of the Alumni
Association, and came to a
mutual agreement that
Washburn will contribute
another $200 to the Ring-tum
Phi, bringing his total to $450 for
issues sent to alumni. McGowan
thanked Abraham for his ef-
forts.

The Ariel’s monthly report
noted that all work to date has
been preparatory. The Ariel is
narrowing the choices for works
to be printed in the magazine.

Ariel Editor Chris Faye
pointed out that deadlines for
submitted materials are Oct. 31
and that as of yet the only ex-
pense incurred was one dollar.

Discussion on

had two suggestions.

The first involved providing

aspects — such as cost of room,
board, social dues — of dif-

The second suggestions in-

that could save fraternities

Action on both suggestion is

all academic buildings.’’
Abraham added he ‘“‘would like
to see it be a_whitebook
change.”’

Third Year Law Rep. John
Fraser said the Security Com-
mittee had met and decided to
draft a letter to various
students and townspeople ques-
tioning the security problem at
Washington and Lee. Written
comments, said Fraser, should
be submitted to the EC room.

The Committee will hold two
meetings dealing with campus
security on Monday at 4 p.m. in
the EC room and Tuesday at 4
p.m. in Classroom D of Lewis
Hall.

The EC approved a $33.70 bill
for flowers sent to Hiland
Moore’s funeral last Friday.

 

 

Vandalism

(continued from page 1)

Chief Kirby also said that a
stolen tape player has been
recovered from a car in the
parking lot of the Stonewall
Jackson Hospital. Several
juveniles have been charged
with stealing the tape deck.

Kirby said that “‘tape players
are the hottest item of larceny
right now, because they’re
worth more than they used to
be.” Also, they seem to be an

grants, loans, or scholarships,”
Ju said. In this way financial
problems would be overcome.

Visiting artists could come
here to teach or demonstrate
their skills in Oriental art.
Graduate students could come
to continue their research and
teach. Performances like the
one held last Fall on the steps of
Lee Chapel by Normal Univer-
sity of Taiwan students could be
held. DuPont Gallery could be
used to exhibit oriental art.

Presently, the University has
a collection of originals and
replicas of classic oriental art
that it cannot exhibit because of
a lack of space. “‘There is an
over-emphasis on books and
magazines for the program,”
Jusaid.

The best way to improve the
program would be to make the
teaching more graphic. ‘“‘Not
every place has an Asian art

collection or Asian _ per-
formances,’’ he said.

Of course money for W&L’s
program is needed. Sung-
hsiung Hung, who has helped
W&L students studying in
Taiwan, has proposed a plan
that will raise some money. He
is willing to set up an export
company dealing in fine
porcelain and artworks. The
profit from this program would
be turned over to the Asian
studies program. A catalog of
the wares offered could be
distributed to the extended
W&L family. This might be a
constant supply of money, but it
probably wouldn’t be enough.
Initiatives like this would be a
help, however.

It is programs like Asian
Studies that distinguish a
liberal arts college from the
others. W&L could be a center
of study of what will be an in-
creasingly important field, Ju
said.

More than 1,000 parents and guests are
expected to attend Washington and Lee
University’s 25th annual Parents’
Weekend, Friday through Sunday (Nov.
9-11).

The three-day event offers parents an
opportunity to meet W&L faculty
members, attend classes, tour the cam-
pus, view departmental displays and
witness several sporting events. Of par-

will be Washington and Lee’s new
undergraduate library, opened in
January 1979 and in its first full year of
round-the-clock operation.

Also scheduled for the parents are a
number of social events and other in-
formal activities, many staged by W&L’s
16 national fraternities.

Among the highlights of the weekend is
a public concert scheduled for 8:15 p.m.

Sponsored by the W&L music depart-
ment, it features the student Brass and
Percussion Ensembles, under the direc-
tion of Dr.. Robert Stewart, and the
Washington and Lee Glee Club, led by
Dr. Gordon Spice.
Parents and guests have also been in-
vited to attend a reception given by
University President Robert E. R.
Huntley and Mrs. Huntley in Evans Din-

‘25th Annual Parents Weekend Begins Tomorrow

The Student Activities Board
reported a $3,500 loss from Sun-
day’s Stillwater concert during
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

The loss was blamed on lack
of attendance and a conflict
with other parties also held on
the weekend.

“The weather was beautiful.
The bands were good, but the
attendance was horrible,”’ said
SAB co-chairman David Har-
pole. ‘‘We knew about Hollins
(Civic Center party) but didn’t
know about Janice being book-
ed,” he added.

In other SAB business, co-
chairman Bill Ridge reported
that Dave Meyers, SAB
member at large, would have to
resign due to fraternity,
academic and Muscular
Dystrophy conflicts.

The Contact Committee
report given by Channing Hall
revealed that no speakers to
date had been booked for the
Fall. Hall said that within the
next three weeks their speaker
agenda should be finalized.

“I’m a little disappointed we
didn’t get one (speaker) for the
Fall,’’ said senior EC Rep. Jay
Blumberg. EC President Steve
Abraham said he wished to echo
Jay’s sentiments and added he
wanted a ‘‘more cohesive set-
up” in their next report for their

winter program speaker line-
up.

That program, said Hall, will
be a “concentrated speaker
line-up in January = and
February.’ The reason, said
Hall, was ‘‘so students will have
an active interest and to show
some continuity.”’

Calyx treasurer John
Hamilton said that ‘‘things are
going pretty well,’’ for the year-
book. He added _ that
underclassmen pictures total
690 and senior photos stand at
180 with 120 scheduled.

‘The patron response is going
over very well,’’ said Hamilton,
adding that they might go over
projected figures. Currently
they have received about 100
replies. He added that the

IFC Fines Beta For Hazing

by Charles Tucker

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council Tuesday
night fined Beta Theta Pi $150
and placed the fraternity on one
year conduct probation for haz-
ing pledges.

The probation stipulates that
a second hazing offense by Beta
will result in a two-week social
probation for the fraternity.

The board levied the penalties
as a result of a fraternity func-
tion last Thursday in which
Beta pledges were’ reportedly

each required to bring two six-
packs of beer to the fraternity
house for consdmption by
pledges and actives after din-
ner.

IFC President Syd Farrar
said the board’s decision was
based on findings that all the
pledges were required to be at
the activity and were required
to drink the beer, and that some
of the pledges got sick as a
result of the drinking.

The activities constitute haz-
ing, said Farrar, and as such

are forbidden by the IFC.

In defense, Beta President
Dickie Finney argued that the
drinking was not restricted to
pledges, but was a house func-
tion which active members
were required to attend as well.

“It was not meant to offend
anybody, there was no physical
abuse,’’ Finney said. “It was

supposed to be fun.”
“It was a _ relaxed at-
mosphere.”’
Finney added that he did not

The Married Life At W&L

Goldwater
To Deliver

Keynote
Address

The 1980 Washington and Lee
University Mock Convention
Committee announced today
that Sen. Barry M. Goldwater,
R-Ariz. four-term Senate
veteran and patriarch of the
Republican party, will deliver
the keynote address at the con-
vention next May 9-10.

The announcement was made
by convention co-chairmen
Craig Cornett, Dick Schoenfeld
and Sidney Simmons.

Washington and Lee’s name
is nothing new to Goldwater—it
goes back to 1964, when the 13th
Mock Convention correctly
predicted that the Senator from
Arizona would be selected as
the Republican nominee for the
presidency. He was personally
on hand in 1968 as part of a Con-
tact symposium on the future of
the Republican party, and he
visited again in 1977 for an ad-
dress sponsored by the W&L
College Republicans.

First elected to the Senate
from the Grand Canyon State in
1952, Goldwater’s bid for the
Oval Office came at a time of
popular sympathy for the
Democratic party and the
challenge of upsetting a power-
ful incumbent in Lyndon
Johnson. As a result, he suf-
fered what was then the worst
margin of defeat in presidential
election history—16 million
votes. Still, his Arizona con-
stitutency sent him back to the
Senate with enthusiasm in 1968,
and in that office he has remain-

It’s a life of frequent frustration, of dif-
ficulty, of isolation, and yet, in the words
of Penny Norfleet, although, ‘‘it’s not a
bed of roses, it’s not all thorns, either.”’
It’s the life of married undergraduate
students at Washington and Lee.

There are currently nine
undergraduate couples at W&L, a
number greater than most students
would probably guess. They are not a
particularly visible group, their married
status tending to set them somewhat
apart from the mainstream, which they
occasionally seem to resent slightly. In
general, though, they are satisfied with
the decision they made, a decision unor-
thodox in this college community.

Sam and Debbie Perkins are a good ex-
ample of this feeling. “Home town
Honeys,”’ in Debbie’s words, they came
from the same Michigan high school.
They married after Sam’s freshman
year here, Debbie leaving her college to
do so, although now, as Sam works
toward law school acceptance, Debbie is
studying nursing at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital.

‘‘Marriage doesn’t make you feel more
mature, really, but it gives you more
responsibility,’ says Sam, an observa-
tion echoed by others of the married
students. In Sam’s and Debbie’s case, the
responsibility is compounded by their
daughter Elizabeth, who will be two in

ed the prominent figure within
the Grand Old Party.

As the Mock Convention
keynoter, Goldwater joina a
distinguished list that includes
Sen. (and former Vice Presi-
dent) Allen Barkley, then-Gov.
Jimmy Carter, Harry S,
Truman and the 1976 speaker,
Sen. William Proxmire. Tradi-
tionally, the keynote speaker is
a prominent leader of the party
out of executive power. His
speech is designed to spark the
crowd of delegates, press and
gallery observers with a spirit
of convention exhilaration and
political pride.

Dirty Words

A British novelist is claiming
a new world record that is even
more usual than most of the
items to be found in the Guin-
ness Book of World Records.

The author claims that her
racy new novel, ‘Lovers and
Gamblers,’’ uses a_ certain
familiar four-letter word 718
times in 503 pages of text. She
also says the word is not an
obscenity ; the novel is about the
rock music scene and ‘“‘in that
millieu, it’s polite conversa-
tion.”’

 

The News In Brief

Big Daddy

Deposed Ugandan dictator
and “president for life” Idi
Amin may have lost his country
and may have a bounty on his
head, but he’s still up to his
same old outrageous tricks.

He admitted killing former
political enemies and other
citizens in torture chambers at
his palace during his reign in an
interview last week with a
French reporter in Libya.

Amin also said that the only
way to achieve world peace is to
make low-priced nuclear

weapons available to all in-
terested countries. ‘‘Only when
one nation fears another can
mutual respect between nations
be truly attained,’ reasoned
“Big Daddy.”

Amin promised to regain
power in Uganda and said he
considers the frequent com-
parisons between himself and
Adolph Hitler ‘‘a compliment,
in the sense that Hitler
dominated the world despite his
difficult start and a physical
handicap. I have nothing
against Hitler because he wish-
ed to fight the war to unify
Europe.”

In the interview, published in
Le Figaro, the former Ugandan
dictator also chided newspaper

editors for the photographs
they’ve printed of him. ‘‘They
always selected the worst
photos which made me look like
an overfed monkey,” Amin
said.

Kennedy 7-4

Ladbrokes, a London agency
which runs hundreds of street-
corner betting parlors, lists
Sen. Edward Kennedy a 7-4
favorite for the Democratic
Party’s presidential nomination
over President Jimmy Carter in
1980. But if Carter beats those
odds, the gamblers give him a
2-1 chance of keeping his job.

The London gambling agency
said that it began taking bets on

the U.S. presidential race in
response to ‘‘public demand.”

Disco Bombing

A 22-year-old Virginia man
was arrested last week in con-
nection with the tear-gassing of
a popular Fairfax City disco-
teque.

Patrick William Samson was
charged with maliciously
releasing a tear gas cannister in
The Library disco, according to
police. Nearly 200 customers
were evacuated from the
nightclub when the tear gas
grenade was thrown through
the front door.

Twenty people were treated
for tear gas inhalation.

 

 
 

 

 

Isaac N. Smith Jr.

 

by Dave Dudka

Isaac N. Smith Jr., of
Charleston, W. Va., has been
elected to serve a six-year term
on the Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees.

Smith, who is executive vice-
president of Kanawha Banking
and Trust Co. of Charleston,
told the Ring-tum Phi in a re-
cent telephone interview that he
is “‘very flattered’ at being
elected to the Board and that he
hopes to ‘‘preserve the fine
standards of Washington and
Lee.”’

Prior to his election, Smith
worked actively with the West
Virginia alumni association and
said that he hopes to be able to
continue his work with them in
the future.

Smith said that he considers
“maintaining the quality of the

Mock Convention Report

The Ring-tum Phi, November 8, 1979, Page 3

W&L Appoints Trustee

University’’ as his principle
goal. This, according to the new
trustee, refers not only to
academia, activities, and social
affairs, but more importantly to
“train the student for leader-
ship roles.”’ Smith views this as
one of W&L’s greatest
heritages.

Three of the University’s
most important aspects, as seen
by Smith, are the honor code,
the size of the school, and the
student-teacher ratio. Students
at W&L are not only taught by
professors (unlike most larger
institutions where graduate
students often teach many
classes), but also the small
class size allows students to talk
to and get to know their
teachers, who Smith sees as
always ‘‘willing to help.”

These features of intimacy
could be lost in a larger college,
and Smith strongly believes
“the size of W&L should be
maintained if at all possible *

One of the University’s most

positive forces, according to the
new trustee, is in the person of
President Robert E.R. Huntley.
Smith is an enthusiastic sup-
porter of Huntley’s many
achievements and has been im-
pressed with him not only as a
particularly able ad-
ministrator, but also as a fine
teacher and leader.

Before going to W&L, Smith,
a native of Charleston, attended
the Mercersburg Academy and
Charleston High School. At
W&L he was co-captain of the
football team, received his B.A.
in 1957 and graduated from law
school here in 1960.

Since graduation he has been
associated with Kanawha Bank-
ing and has’ undertaken
graduate studies at North-
western’ University (in 1962)
and Rutgers (in 1972).

Other business affiliations in-
clude the presidencies of
Kanawha City Co., West
Virginia Land Co., and
Kanawha _ Co.

George Bush: “A Former Almost Everything”

by Carlo Carlozzi, Jr.

After having been considered
three times for the vice
presidency by Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, George Bush
announced in early May of this
year: his Presidential can-
didacy. His announcement was
somewhat overdue. No
Republican aspirant started
earlier than Bush. In 1978 alone,
he toured 42 states laying down
his grass roots organization
which he claims will get him the
nomination in 1980.

George Herbert Walker Bush,
54, is a man with a deep sense of
noblesse oblige. However,
unlike most of his predecessors
of the old Eastern establish-
ment of the Republican party,
George Bush is no liberal, not
even a moderate. Rather, Bush
is running pretty much as a
standard conservative.

His credentials are im-
pressive: Greenwich County
Day School, Andover, youngest

pilot in the Navy and graduated

Phi Beta Kappa in 2% years
from Yale. While at Yale, he
was also a member of Skull and
Bones, captain of the baseball
team and President of the
Senior Class,

Mr. Bush is the former-
almost-everything. He served
two terms as a member of Con-
gress, from Texas, former en-
voy to Peking, former CIA
Director, former Republican

National Chairman in the
darkest Watergate days. He
performed all of these jobs with
ability, if not always brilliance.

In his declaration of can-
didacy, on May 1, 1979, Mr. Bush
said he wasn’t promising ‘‘a
new deal’’ or ‘“‘a new Founda-
tion’’, but rather, he was offer-
ing ‘‘a new candor.”’ Mostly due
to his background, Mr. Bush
has been speaking almost en-
tirely about foreign policy.
What he says about foreign
policy is generally tough and
conservative.

Bush opposed the Panama
-Canal treaties, and now re-
mains cautious on the Salt II
treaty. Bush contends that his
CIA assignment fortified his
that the Russian
challenge is dangerous. On the
Salt II treaty, Bush stated that
“the fact is that under this trea-
ty we are virtually unable to
monitor whether the Soviets
comply with its terms.... when
it comes to vertification of Salt
II, Jimmy Carter will ask us to
trust the Soviets as he once ask-
ed us to trust him... But I say...
that a treaty that can not be
verified tomorrow shouldn’t be
ratified today.”’

George Bush favors the ERA,

thinks that the CIA has been
undercut and opposes a tax cut
without a cut in federal spen-
ding. He favors nuclear
development, favors a shared
reduction in government
regulation of business, a phase-
out of some of the social pro-
grams dating to the Kennedy-
Johnson years. Bush favors a
supply-oriented energy pro-
gram including oil-price decon-
trol and a “‘windfall profits’’ tax
with a strong ‘‘plowback’’ pro-
vision to encourage oil develop-

ment, and sharp tax cut to move
the economy forward.

A big problem for George
Bush is the fact that he is not a
household name. This, though,
can be rectified as the elections
of 1976 showed us with the
nomination and eventual elec-
tion of Jimmy Carter to the
White House.

Depending on the poll read,
George Bush’s name can go
from non-existent to leading the
field of names. A June
Washington Post poll of 1,976
Republican delegates showed
Bush running third, at ll per-
cent, following former Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan and John
Connally. Ina survey conducted
by the Christian Science

Monitor in late July of 1979, of
Republican leaders, George
Bush led the field as their
nominee for president, with 27
percent, over 24 percent for
Reagan and 22 for Conally.

Most recently Bush scored a
campaign coup in Iowa, site of
the nation’s first delegate-
selection caucuses in January
and the state where Jimmy
Carter first made his mark in
1976. Bush can hardly hope to
defeat Reagan, whose Iowa ties
date from his days as a Des
Moines sportscaster. However,
a strong second-place finish in
Iowa would give Bush an early
advantage over other
Republican candidates. Bush is
hoping Iowa will be for him
what it was for Carter in 1976.

Halloween Night

 

Local Youths Attack Fraternity

by Alan Kenrick

Some teenage Lexington
youths apparently damaged the
Sigma Phi Epsilon house and in-
jured two of its members during
activities Halloween night.

In a night described by police
as historically low in van-
dalism, teenagers broke a
number of windows in the SPE
house, hit one pledge with a bot-
tle, and beat up a member.

Four girls, who apparently
planned to hit the house with
eggs, had come to the door
repeatedly during the evening,
while more friends waited at
the street, talked to members at
the front door, then left. They
showed up again, this time with
eggs in their pockets and in-
dicated their intentions,

whereupon two house members
smashed the eggs in the girls’
pockets, frustrating their plans.
The girls returned later with
four more friends, two of them
male, and burst inside the
house. One of the original group
announced, “This house is
dead!’’ Seconds later, before
members had time to react, a
number of French windows
were broken by cans of
chestnuts hurled from outside.
A Boone’s Farm Apple Wine
bottle, similar to one seen
earlier in the possession of one
of the teenagers, broke a storm
window
bedroom.
Members ran outside at this
point, whereupon one pledge
was hit in the face with a bottle

in a_ second floor -

which glanced off his cheek,
broke, and cut his lip. None of
the offending youths were
caught, and members in the
house attributed the damage to
another fraternity.

License plates on_ the
teenagers’ cars were traced
and some children of W&L pro-
fessors were found to be involv-
ed. The names of most of the
vandals have been uncovered
and many are students at Lex-
ington High School.

A member of SPE, Glen
Koontz, stated that SPE does
not wish to press charges if they
can only be reinbursed for the
damages. Charges of van-
dalism and assault will be
pressed if they receive no more
cooperation, said Koontz.

Student Charged With Hit And

Run, Driving Under Influence

A Washington and Lee senior
was arrested Friday morning
and charged with one count of

_ driving under the influence of
alcohol and one count of hit and

Sgt. Marvin Hamilton, who
made the arrest at 1:50 a.m.,
said the accident occurred at
approximately 1:24a.m.

Several freshmen rushed out
of the Gilliam and Grahme-Lee
dormatories after hearing the
accident.

“I thought two cars had col-
lided head-on,”’ said one dorm
resident who was reading in bed
when the accident occurred.

The collision was the second
hit and run accident involving a
W&L student this year.

Student Jumped

The final assault came, in a
related incident, when SPE
member Bob Forsyth was at-
tacked by ten of a predominate-
ly black group of youths.

Forsyth related to the Ring-
tum Phi that he was returning
home just as the violence
erupted and pursued one of the
teenagers to the vicinity of the
Presbyterian church at Main &
Nelson streets where he lost
sight of him.

Walking back to the house,
Forsyth saw a group of about 30
youths standing across the
street near the Lyric Theater.
Crossing the street down by the
Methodist church, he was ap-
proached by about ten youths.

One asked, ‘‘Did you find the
guy who trashed your house?’’

Forsyth replied, ‘‘No, but I
know what he looks like.”’

Youth: “Do you see him here
(with us)?”

Forsyth: ‘‘No.”’

Youth: “Well, he’s probably
one of our friends, and we’d
hate to see one of our friends get
in trouble.”

At this point, several youths
surrounded Forsyth and pum-
melled him. Forsyth managed
to escape and ran down an alley
by the church but was
trapped at the other end by ad-
ditional youths who tripped him
and kicked him repeatedly on
the ground until he got to his
feet and fled, returning home.
Forsyth finished his statement
by saying he did wish to trace
and prosecute his attackers.

Student Files For
Assault And Battery

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent has filed charges against a
Hampden-Sydney student for
assault and battery, stemming
from an incident at Sweet Briar
College.

Timothy Reid Harris, a W&L
sophomore, filed charges this
week against Billy Harrison of
Hampden-Sydney with the
Amherst County  sheriff,s
department.

Harris said he was in the dor-
mitories at Sweet Briar around
midnight on Oct. 18. Harrison
was allegedly spraying a fire

extinguisher, and when Harris
ran to him to try to make him
stop, Harrison hit him in the
mouth with the fire  ex-
tinguisher.

Harris said one of his teeth
was knocked out, four more
shattered, and he required
many stitches inside and out-
side his mouth. Harris said he
spent about three and a half
hours in the emergency room in
Lynchburg and four hours in the
dentist’s chair in Richmond, his
home town.

Married Life At W&L

(continued from page 1)

December. The Perkins find they have to
schedule their already limited time
around her.

Debbie handles all the cooking and
cleaning, which Sam says is an ad-
vantage, as it “frees up a certain amount
of time” for him. ‘I’m taking more than
giving right now,” he admits, ‘but that’ll
change. It’s a two-way street.”

In the case of Jay and Penny Norfleet,
who were married in June, Penny also
does the majority of the housework, as
well as doing volunteer work at the Lex-
ington branch of the ASPCA. They feel,
as do the other couples, that the hus-
band’s studies must take precedence
over other activities. Jay is carrying a

stiff Commerce school workload, in the |

interest of ultimately owning and
operating a classics and art film theater,
with Penny’s assistance, in their home
town of Memphis.

None of the husbands cited any real
academic difficulty as a result of mar-
riage. On the contrary, grades have tend-
ed to rise. Joe Olive, also a senior Com-
merce major, says he experienced a
period of adjustment following his
August, 1977, marriage to his wife, Bar-
bara, and their subsequent move to Lex-
ington, during which his grades fell. This
was only a temporary problem, however,
and since then, his grades have improv-
ed, a result, he thinks, of his greater
responsibility and better time-budgeting
ability.

Irregular daily schedules and a lack of
time spent together are problems cited
by all the couples. Most of the wives, like
Kathy McNulty, whose husband, Ray, is
a senior double-majoring in Sociology
and Journalism, work, often contributing
a great deal to the family’s support.
Kathy works at a variety of jobs,
waitressing at Pizza Hut and (as does
Barbara Olive) The Cockpit, doing typ-
ing and babysitting. A trained secretary,
she, like some of the other wives, is
discouraged at the lack of good job op-
portunities available in Lexington. Pen-
ny Norfleet noted that Lexington
employers seem particularly reluctant to
give jobs to out-of-town people who do not
plan to be year-round residents, or to

allow much time off during college vaca-
tions. Consequently, most of the married
students, to accommodate job schedules,
spend the majority of their vacation time
in Lexington.

The amount of time spent apart, plus
the difficulty of making trips hone even
during holidays, tends to make the lives
of married undergrads, and particularly
of their wives, rather lonely. The transi-
tion from family life in locations as
diverse as Long Island, Michigan, and
Tennessee to an all-male school in rural
Virginia was, in most cases, not an easy
one. Barbara Olive, for instance, came
from a Long Island family of four sisters
and, after only a few weeks of marriage,
was thrown into the W&L scene—a scene
offering almost no female companion-
ship, and where, as Joe Olive remarked,
a major problem ‘‘is getting guys to keep
their hands off my wife.”’

In a similar vein, Debbie Perkins
notes, partygoers from the nearby
women’s colleges are occasionally
shocked to find the object of their atten-
tions is married. At fraternity parties

‘ (Sam is president of Chi Psi), ‘girls will

come up to me and say, ‘Who’s that guy?’
I say, ‘That’s my husband,’ and get some
pretty strange looks.” Pledges also are
frequently surprised to find that a
member of a “‘wild’’ college fraternity is
married, although the husbands who are
or were frat members maintain that
marriage hasn’t really strained those
relationships. Jay and Penny Norfleet
are called ‘“‘Mom and Dad’’ by his Sigma
Phi Epsilon brothers, and Ray and Kathy
McNulty are referred to as Mr. and Mrs.
MeNulty when they drop by parties at Fi-
ji, his former fraternity.

Joe Olive and Ray McNulty maintain,
however, that their social lives have
changed considerably since marriage,
though Joe, at least, did not expect quite
such a radical change. Having lived in a
house with three other guys his
sophomore year, he had established sort
of a pattern of late nights of drinking and
playing cards. Following his marriage,
however, “‘one night of staying out till six
playing cards and that was that!”’

They have also found that married
couples tend to associate primarily with

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other married, or at least engaged,
couples, and while the men still have
single friends, the women usually don’t.

Joe Olive also remarks that Staunton
and Roanoke are ‘‘fine for entertainment
if you’re married,” although not
especially recommended for the single
guy looking for kicks.”

All agree that a real benefit of mar-

riage, from both a social and financial ©

point of view, is the elimination of con-
stant phone calls and visits back and
forth. During the year Ray and Kathy
McNulty were engaged, for example,
“the phone bills were incredible—we
were writing each other every day, too.”
During that year, Kathy came to W&L
for the big social weekends, with Ray
returning to their hometown of Brent-
wood, Long Island on many of the in-
tervening weekends. All things con-
sidered, however, they find they aren’t
really seeing that much more of each
other, between his studying and part-
time sports information office job and
her working. “I have weekends free,”’
complains Ray, ‘‘and that’s when she’s
working double shifts!”

Five of the nine undergraduate couples
live in Davidson Park, the university-
owned “‘barracks” apartments located
between Washington and Nelson Streets,
where most of their neighbors are law

Ray and Kathy McNulty

students and their husbands and wives.
Most of the couples feel that the
reasonably-priced apartments are the
main concession the university makes to
married students, although Ray McNulty
and Sam Perkins both cited the ex-
cellence and helpfulness of the Financial
Aid program here, especially useful to
self-supporting couples subsisting
primarily on loans, grants and part-time
jobs.

Several of the couples noted, however,
that they did not feel particularly a part
of the law-oriented Davidson Park Com-
munity, where the existence of the mar-
ried undergrad faction occasionally
seems forgotten.

In general, though, the undergrad
couples seem pretty content with their
current status. Early marriage is not an
easy thing to do—parental resistance has
to be overcome, responsibility has to be
assumed and, as Penny Norfleet says,
“you have to make certain decisions—if
they fail, it’s our fault only.’’ Still, the
benefits are there, and, if he felt he’d
missed anything by being married when
he did, Sam Perkins quickly replied,
“From a single student’s point of view,
yes; from my view, no.”’ That statement
seems to capture the state of affairs
among married undergraduates at
Washington and Lee.

 

Couple Establishes Unitrust To Benefit W&L

A “‘‘Unitrust’’ valued at
$305,000 has been established to
benefit Washington and Lee
University by a Gloucsster, Va.
couple, Mr. and Mrs. James
Bland Martin.

A Unitrust is an irrevocable
arrangement that provides the
donor with a lifetime income
and an immediate, substantial

income-tax deduction. Under -

certain circumstances it results
in no capital-gains taxes, and

estate taxes on the value of the
trust will be eliminated or
reduced.

When the Unitrust terminates
on the deaths of the donor-
beneficiaries, the charitable re-
mainder comes to Washington
and Lee for a purpose chosen by
the donors.

Mrs. Martin is a member of
Washington and Lee’s Board of
Trustees. Her husband, a 1931
W&L law graduate, is the

retired founding partner of the
Gloucester law firm of Martin,
Hicks & Ingles.

The Martins’ Unitrust con-
sisted of 12,265 shares of stock
in United Virginia
Bankoucester. That bank grew
from the Bank of Gloucester,
founded by Mr. Martin’s father
before World War I.

When the Martin Unitrust
comes to Washington and Lee,
the Martins have designated the
funds to establish an endow-
ment in honor of the late Frank
and Louise Gilliam, Mr.
Gilliam, who died in 1976, was
dean of students and director of
admissions at W&L for more
than 30 years. Mrs. Gilliam was
extremely active in The Garden
Club of Virginia, as Mrs. Martin

 

has also been, and it was
through that association that
the Gilliams and the Martins
became lifelong friends.

Because of the terms of the
Martin Unitrust, the donors will
receive a greater annual in-
come from the trust assets than
before the creation of the
Unitrust.

In addition, an immediate
income-tax deduction of more
than $100,000 resulted from the
gift. And because of the
Unitrust’s irrevocable

charitable nature, they will in-
cur no capital-gains tax liabili-
ty.

Glasgow Endowment
To Present One-Man Show

“Exit Burbage,’ a title deriv-
ed from the epitaph on
Shakespearian actor Richard
Burbage's tombstone in Lon-
don, is a one-man show, an
Elizabethan entertainment
starring Peter Whitbread,
renowned Shakespearean actor
in his own right. The play will
be presented at Washington and
Lee University for one night on-
ly, next Wednesday (Nov. 14) at
8 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre. Admission is free and
the public-is invited.

Sponsors for the performance
are W&L's Glasgow Endow-
ment Committee and the
Department ot English and
Fine Arts.

As the greatest
Shakespeare's age,
Burbage was the original
Hamlet, Othello, Lear and
Richard III. But he was only
one star in a family that has
been called ‘'the first first fami-
ly of the English theatre.”’ The
family saga began in 1576, when

actor of
Richard

James Burbage built ‘The
Theatre’ — the first permanent
Playhouse and the first resting
place for the wandering actors
of English drama. James’ older
son, Cuthbert, used the timbers
of The Theatre to build the
legendary Globe in 1599. And
there the younger son, Richard,
acted out most of Shakespeare's
tragic heroes.

In the role of Burbage, Whit-
bread combines a series of anc-
cdotes, readings from contem-
porary writers, and excerpts
from the plays of Marlowe, Jon-
son and Shakespeare. The in-
tention of the play, according to
Whitbread, is to ‘show
Shakespeare as a man, rather
than piece of bookish history —
and the period in all its vivid
reality.”

The selections in “Exit Bur-
bage’’ illustrate a variety of
dramatic styles, ranging from
Marlowe's ‘‘Tamburlaine’’ to
Shakespeare's ‘“‘Richard III.”

Whitbread dons female clothing
to portray the Nurse in ‘“‘Romeo
and Juliet,’ pointing out that all
female parts were enacted by
men at the time.

A section featuring the fat,
cowardly Falstaff
demonstrates the use of
character make-up. And on hs
goes through the cycle — from
tragic heroes Antony and
Othello to the ‘‘wise fools.’’ All
the parts are presented with
changes of costume and props.

Born in England, Whitbread’s
first professional role was
Romeo at the Old Castle
Theatre, Farnham, in 1951.
Since then, he played leading
roles in most major repertory
houses. He toured with Sir John
Gielgud in Africa in ‘‘Richard
II’ and ‘Much Ado About
Nothing,’’ then to Moscow in
Paul Schofield’s ‘‘Hamlet,’’ the
first English company to play
that country since World War I.

Movie Review

More American

Graffiti

By Dash Coufal

 

MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI

Written and Directed by B.W.L. Norton
With Paul LeMat, Ron Howard, Cindy
Williams, Candy Clark & Macenzie Phillips

At the end of American Graffiti they told us
how things turned out, thus giving away the
ending of any sequel.

Another handicap of More American Graf-
fiti is that the end of the original was the last
time the characters would all be living in the
valley.

Add to that the absence of two stars
(Susanne Sommers and Robert Dreyfus) and
the writer/director of the original, and one
can easily understand why the sequel fails.

The brilliance of American Graffiti was
that it captured an age. It was a cross section
of a Southern California valley. It gave one
the flavor of the early sixties. The sequel
repeats that flavor in one episode, but fails to
capture anything of the late sixties.

The unity of American Graffiti was one of
its strengths. Though there were several
stories being told, they all affected each other
and all share a deadline on their resolution.

The stories were indeed intertwined. The
sequel tells four stories on four different New
Year's Eves. The stories are only intertwined
by being told simultaniously through cross-
cutting. None of the stories affect each other
and only once does anybody make reference
to another story: Toad tells us that LeMat
died a year previous (gee, Toad, you gave it
away.) To make it more annoying each story
has a different screen size.

The first story is by far the best. Paul
LeMat is the drag racer who we were told at
the end of the original, was killed by a drunk
driver. They save the story by choosing not to
concentrate on this; rather they show him
winning a race on New Year’s Eve Day
(remember, it doesn’t snow in Southern
California). He also meets and establishes a
rapport, of sorts, with an Icelandic girl who
can’t speak English. It’s a very human se-
quence that perhaps has the most in common
with the first movie. But he gets it.

Toad goes to Viet Nam and is filmed with a

screen size that’s like looking through a peep-

hole, very annoying. This just isn’t the Toad
of the first movie, it’s only the same actor.

The character of Toad is violated and the plot

is only fair up to the real un-Toad-like ending.

Yes, Ron Howard marries Cindy Williams,
but at first not all is happy. Cindy wants a job
and Ron says she had to take care of the kids.
Cindy runs off to talk to her brother and ends
up in a grossly brutal police riot and Ron
saves the day’ My only question is what ever
happened to the party they were supposed to
throw that evening? It’s about as foamy as it
sounds.

Cindy Clark is in Height-Ashbury, but
where is the plot? She had a very nice hat, and
seems to be having trouble with her old man
(hip lingo for a paramour), but really I can’t
sympathize with this vaporous plot. The
screen size, that is screen sizes, are annoy-
ingly psychedelic. Some kind of bad trip,
man.

One last word on Ron Howard: even if he
can grow a natty red moustache I still can’t
accept him as being a day over fourteen.

writing, Whitbread returned to
the stage in ‘Exit Burbage,”’
which he devised and produced.

of the Warsaw Autumn Festival
in 1977, and has been received

Record Rewiew

Root Boy Slim’s Latest

by Mark Kinniburgh

Root Boy Slim has just releas-
ed his second album on Illegal
Records, and be advised the
record stores may not have any
Root Boy Slim and the Sex
Change Band in its racks for
sale.

The new album is called
“ZOOM”, and it features all the
attributes that made the first
release by Root Boy great, and
even more new _ production
twists from Donald Fagen and
Gary Katz (of Steely Dan fame)
make this a must for fans and
those who can get into bizarre
music.

Let me explain ‘‘bizarre™
Root Boy Slim and the Sex
Change Band come from the
Washington, D.C., area, and
have been local favorites for
many years. As the name of
these strange art-rockers
spread and as they became
more accepted by cult ‘Root
Boy Rooters,’ the tales of the
band with the ‘‘great lyrics”
and ‘‘funny’’ stage show
preceeded them all over the
country and, of late, England.
The music is supplied by an ex-
tremely tight musical back-up
group and a chorus of female
vocalists dubbed the ‘‘Rootlet-
tes."

I mentioned lyrics, and lyrics
they are in the greatest sense of
the word, as Root Boy has given
a fine representation of his ex-
periences throughout his event-
ful life. (Including prep schools

In his song ‘‘Do the Gator,”
he observes quite casually
“There’s a dance you can
do/Ifyou’re drunk like me/Get

down and Boogie/Horizontal-
ly!’’ In another tune ‘Dare to
be Fat’’ we are told of a 202 lb.
sweetheart that Root Boy drools
over, and how to “‘have a ball
with cholesterol.”

On to the stage shows that ac-
company The Sex Change Band
in concert, just a look at the
album cover will suggest what
this band is capable of and more
so, what to expect from Root
Boy in his next U.S. tour to ac-

* company ‘‘ZOOM.”’

The ‘“Root’’ glasses and
“Stoned’’ headgear are
trademarks of Rootboy from
wayback. Cut from styrofoam
and glued together in various
alphabetical configurations,
these glasses are then placed on
the head to resemble sun-
glasses. Where the motivation
lies for the music, glasses or
general Root boy Slim and the
Sex Change Band attitude is not
really important, but I really
wonder if Root Boy has
anything on his mind besides a
good time.

“ZOOM” will be a national
success and one can even ex-

pect to see some preferred
selections on AM radio by next
summer. I give it an “A” with
honors for crazy. But please, be
patient with local record con-
cerns as it is difficult to obtain
copies at this early date, and
those receiving a few albums
will probably already have sold

Roadside Theater Relates
Appalachian History

by John Wells

‘‘T love stories,’’ says Don Baker.

For the past five years he has helped make
folk stories, so strongly evocative of mountain
lore and tradition, into an art form. His
traveling group, the Roadside Theater, has,
since 1974, taken a collection of stories and
music indigenous to the Southern Ap-
palachian area and developed them into a
program that looks as far removed from for-
mal theater as listening to tales on Aunt Min-
nie’s porch. But it is theater, and on a level
that can be understood and related to back in
the hollows and coal camps where conven-
tional theater is unheard of.

The scripts used by Roadside are derived
from the oral history of the area, and many
stories and songs were originally gathered as
part of the W.P.A.’s Writer’s Project in the
middle 1930’s. Its style may be attributed to
the traditional story-telling associated with
southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky.

The Theater’s program, Brother Jack, was
presented at the Troubadour on October 10 by
the Glasgow Endowment Committee.

Don Baker graduated from Washington and
Lee in 1968, a drama major. He un-
characteristically began the show here by
personally telling the tale which provides the
show's title, “‘Pretty Polly.’’ The only real
prop used in the entire show is a rocking chair
set in the middle of the stage. Baker agrees
that there is ‘something special about a live
performance.” His credits include Waiting
For Godot and the title role in Richard I.

He thinks it is important for home folks to
be exposed to the regional theater. ‘They
have the tube,” he says, ‘‘and they can watch
the tube comfortably.:’ But, your average
resident of Drift, Ky., is not likely to sit inona
performance of Shakespeare or Beckett and
receive any great amount of edification.
Roadside Theater, with its stories and music,
is familiar to them.

Much of the charm of the program may be
attributed to the players, three of them: Ron
Short, from Dickinson County, N.C., who,
with Baker, wrote the script; Tom Bledsoe,
who, like Baker, is from the Wise County
area; and Angelyn DeBord, a South Carolina
girl who supplies the spark of feminine wiles
to the show.

The stories are accompanied by songs
which run parallel in theme, and which repre-

sent a reservoir of traditional music, ac-
cording to Short. As a reaffirmation that the
process goes on, Short is able to compose
music that is compatible with other songs in
Brother Jack that are generations, even cen-
turies, old. This, he says, gives the music a
‘new identity.”

Tom Bledsoe provides much of the humor in
the show, as the glint in his sharp eyes would
indicate. Long, straw-colored hair, and a
beard—the type normally associated with a
Confederate renegade or Gabby Hayes—add
a physical dimension to the proceedings
which, along with superb timing and rapport
with the other players, make up for the
absence of props.

To Bledsoe, the ideal theater is Fuller’s
General Store in Snowflake, Virginia. It is
essential to strive for this effect, he says, to
“get the closest you can get to that at-
mosphere.”’

It is hard to imagine what the show would
be like without Angelyn DeBord. She wears a
simple brown print dress, the ruffled
shoulders of which she raises or lowers,
depending upon the age and nature of the
character she plays. Her hair is used to
marvelous effect: pulled back tight as Gran-
ny, tale tellin’ from her rocker; loose and
seductive as the Devil’s Daughter; complete-
ly wild-looking in the hilarious ‘Hairy
Woman” sketch. Unlike some of the others,
offstage, Ms. DeBord’s country accent
doesn’t change.

“What I love,”’ she says, ‘‘is goin’ back to
the hollers, and seein: the reaction of the peo-
ple back there to what we do. They love it!
And if they think you didn’t tell that story just
right, now, they ain’t a bit afraid to grab you
by the arm and say ‘Now listen here...’ ”’.

The populace of the Southern Appalachians
are grateful for having theater brought to
them by Roadside, but it is important that this
fascinating, restricted element of our culture
can be dramatized for others to appreciate as
well.

Roadside travels all over the south, has per-
formed Off Broadway in New York, and was
featured at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival
in Washington, D.C.

Don Baker’s love for stories and his native
heritage have become an entertaining pro-
gram that is an important mirror of the dis-
tant, and not-so-distant, past.

agree with that type of fraterni-
ty activity, and said ‘‘I don’t
forsee it happening again.”

Phi Kappa Sigma was also
placed on one year hazing con-
duct probation for ‘‘kidnapp-
ing” a pledge and tying him toa
Wilson Field goalpost last Tues-
day.

According to Farrar, the IFC
received a report last week that
a Phi Kap pledge involved in a
raid on the fraternity house had
been “grabbed actives, taken
into the house, had mustard
dumped in his mouth, and was
generally trashed.”

The pledge was then
reportedly taken to Wilson
Field, stripped, and tied to one
of the goalposts. It was reported
that girls had been present dur-
ing the kidnapping, said Far-
rar.

Phi Kap member Andy Wiley
said the report was ‘‘greatly ex-
aggerated.’’ According to
Wiley, who was present at the
incident, the pledge hit and ac-
tive member with two eggs dur-
ing the raid at dinner last Tues-
day. He was then grabbed by
fraternity members and
‘mustard was put on him” said
Wiley. ‘‘No mustard was put in
his mouth.”’

After taking a shower, the
pledge was found to a goalpost
on Wilson Field, from which he
“easily freed himself,” ac-
cording to Phi Kap President
Ab Boxley.

Boxley added that the pledge
was not completely stripped of
his clothes, and that there was
no girls present.

“It’s not like we went up to
the dorms and kidnapped so-
meone,’’ Boxley commented.

When asked if he condoned
raids, Boxley said, ‘“yes—
probably everyone in this room
has done it, particularly the
seniors. Nobody ever minded.
And there’s no way now that we
could do what was done to us
when we were freshmen.”

“I just can’t see getting riled
up about this penny-ante stuff.”’

Phi Kap was not fined
because the pledge provoked
the action and was at the house
on his own free will, said IFC
Secretary Sam Perkins.

Both decisions by the IFC
Judicial Board are subject to
approval by the Student Affairs
Committee, which will ‘review
the cases at a meeting Thurs-
day night.

The Judicial Board also
agreed Tuesday to investigate
allegations by Sigma Phi Ep-
silon Pres. Chris O’Connor, that
his fraternity house was
damaged last Saturday by
members of Phi Gamma Delta.

EARN OVER $
WITH ARMY ROTC.

Before you ee from college! Because now, you can com-
e Army Reserve or National Guard with ye

ROTC. It’s called the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP).
And, depending on your academic year when you enter, SMP
can help you earn over $6,500.

Here’s how it works. If you qualify and a vacancy is available,
you become a member of an Army Reserve or National Guard unit
as an officer trainee and, at the same time, enroll in the Army
ROTC advanced course at your college. Your Reserve or Guard
membership will pay you at the minimum level of Sergeant E-5, and
you'll receive $100 a month during the regular school year as an
ay | ROTC advanced course cadet.

t the end of your second year of advanced ROTC, you'll be

6,500

 

commissioned a second lieutenant and, assuming there’s a vacancy,
serve with a Guard or Reserve unit while you complete the require-
ments for your college degree. Upon graduation, you may con-
tinue service with a Guard or Reserve unit while rears your
civilian career, or you can, if you prefer, compete for active duty as
an Army officer.

So if you’d like to earn over $6,500 while you're still in college,
get into SMP. Because SMP can help you do it. You can bank on it!

Liberty Hall Excavations: Artif

by Parker Potter
The Liberty Hall ar-
chaeological excavation,
directed for seven years by Dr.
John McDaniel, is a project of
which the University can
rightfully be proud.

It is a fine example of how the
resources of a small teaching
university have been mobilized
to support a research project
the equal of any in the state of
Virginia.

A great point of pride with
McDaniel and others associated

with Liberty Hall is the fact that
our work is a valid and produc-

Close-up view of the uncovered structure.

tive academic exercise, and at
the same time a project of great
significance to the ar-
chaeological community in
Virginia and beyond.

Archaeology first. Liberty
Hall is a unique site in many
respects. Washington and Lee is
one of the very few schools that
can archaeologically examine
its early history. W&L’s

predecessors hopscotched their
way down the valley, arriving
here, in the town of Lexington,
in 1803-after 54 years of moving
around. (Most colleges seem to

disturbing the remains of
earlier structures. )

Ours is not only the first pro-
ject to investigate the Scotch-
Irish west of the Blue Ridge in
Virginia, but it is one of the very
first applications of historic ar-
chaeology in the western part of
the state.

Even the brand of historical
archaeology being practiced at
Liberty Hall is exciting. Much
of the work at Williamsburg and
other Tidewater areas is
directed toward stocking period
room displays and fleshing out
established and documented
histories.

However, at Liberty Hall we
are using a cultural approach to
historic archaeology to
challenge a number of deeply
rooted historical misconcep-
tions concerning the early years
of Rockbridge County.

Many local histories and
popular stories (now being
challenged by historians too)
paint a picture of cultural isola-
tion and great peril in
Rockbridge County well into the
late eighteenth century. Indian
massacres seem to receive par-
ticular attention in these ac-
counts, accounts accepted by a
large segment of the local
population.

Armed with these, the only
available historical concepts at
the time, McDaniel and his first
crews expected to find evidence
of a frontier existence at Liber-
ty Hall. But the artifacts could
not have contrasted more vivid-
ly with the local historical tradi-
tion.

Among the 25,000 artifacts ex-
cavated at Liberty Hall are a
wide range of British ceramics,
Chinese porcelain, English but-
tons, French gunflints and
Dutch and English pipes.

This wide range of imported
commodities, which reached
Rockbridge with amazing
speed, as well as the general
paucity of arms-related ar-

 

tifacts, underlines the fact that
Rockbridge in the last decades
of the eighteenth century was
hardly a perilous frontier area.

But the truly exciting aspect
of the findings at Liberty Hall is
the fact that ours isn’t a project
carried out in the name of the
University by a group of
graduate students and profes-
sionals, as is the case at many
institutions.

Students Do Survey Project

by Jim Feinman

Seventeen Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students are currently involved in an
intensive archaeological survey project
under the auspices of Dr. John M.
MeManiel, advisor to Washington and
Lee’s Regional Office of the Virginia
Research Center for Archaeology in
Williamsburg.

The students are responsible for ex-
cavating several sites that are suspected
to have been occupied by settlers during
the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
The sites are located in the western half
of Rockbridge County in the vicinity of
Big House Mountain.

The long-range goal of the project is to
provide insights into the culture and lives
of the predominantly Scotch-Irish people
who were the first colonists to occupy the
area.

The W&L students are supported in

this educational program through a
grant from V.R.C.A. The grant provides
annual funding for the Washington and
Lee Regional Office. The grant is used to
hire a full-time archaeologist and to
cover expenses incurred by the regional
office.

W&L was chosen as one of five regional
offices by the Virginia Commission of Ar-
chaeology in 1978. The selection was in
recognition of W&L’s intensive ar-
chaeological project at Liberty Hall.

The major responsibility of the
regional office is to assess the impact of
proposed construction projects on poten-
tial archaeological sites. Another role is
to place sites on the National Register of
Historic places. The Historic Preserva-
tion Act of 1966 provided for the

Any site that is placed on tnis National
Register is immune from any construc-
tion or other disturbance that may
damage or destroy it.

Other responsibilities of the regional
office include education and research in
the field of archaeology. It is in this
aspect that most of the students are in-
volved. The students, most of whom are
enrolled in an upper level archaeological
survey course, are conducting research
on several sites that could be of im-
portance in determining the cultural,
commercial and industrial activities of
the earliest settlers in the area.

The research the students are involved
in consists ofthe intensive excavation of
the area in which the site is located. Ar-
tifacts are collected, cleaned and stored.

After the area is sufficiently excavated
the students will offer interpretations of
the site. These interpretations will help
to educate the students and others on the
lives and culture of the colonial ancestors
of Rockbridge County.

Dr. McDaniel offers an explanation of
the importance of these studies: ‘“‘We are
confident our focus will provide valuable
insights concerning the first settlers in
Rockbridge County. We are proud of the

credit toW&L.

Over the course of five sum-

ferent outside groups have been
brought in to work with us at
Liberty Hall, two of them for
four years each.

In addition to exposing people

McDaniel has attracted for
Liberty Hall grant money total-
ing over $43,000, most notably
from the Greenbaum Founda-
tion, the Virginia Bicentennial

It should be noted, though,
that none of our work at Liberty

without the tremendous support
offered by Washington and Lee

Speaking Of
Sports...

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

After four years of fan apathy at W&L, wasn’t it
nice to see a packed house at the gym last weekend?
And at a water polo match yet?

And isn’t it a shame that after an outstanding four-
year career at W&L, Stew Atkinson couldn’t go out a
winner?

 

Speaking of W&L football, if anyone can explain
what happened last Saturday on Wilson Field, I’ll give
you a nickel.

Wasn't it nice to see cheerleaders at a W&L football
game the past two weekends? Wouldn’t it be nicer if
W&L had their own cheerleaders again?

While we’re on the topic of cheerleaders, aren’t
those pro cheerleaders great during a boring N.F.L.
game?

Speaking of pro football, aren’t you tired of watch-
ing the Deadskins every Sunday? Especially when the
Cowboys and the Giants were playing a thriller last
weekend up in New Jersey while the Skins were get-
ting clobbered by Pittsburgh in the Dull Bowl?

It doesn’t look like anyone is going to beat Pitts-
burgh again this season, does it?

Getting back to T.V. football coverage, when will
sportscasters learn to speak English properly?

Changing sports, it’s free-agent time again in
baseball. Isn’t it amazing what some of these guys are
going to get paid for playing a game they enjoy?

Back to W&L, isn’t it nice that the basketball
Generals will travel to Europe to share the great
American dream? And don’t forget the goodwill tour
of the Bahamas?

And isn’t it amazing that over 40 college-educated
lacrosse players would push a bed 50 miles along a
highway? Doesn’t it seem more logical to raise
money by doing something constructive for the com-
munity?

Will Bill Devine still be able to kick barefoot as cold-
er weather approaches Lexington?

Has Rich Hachenburg won the starting job as
W&L’s QB? Or will we still play musical quarter-
backs?

Moving on to the Olympics, will N.B.C. be able to
cut through the Soviet Union’s ‘‘red”’ tape and provide
unregulated coverage of the 1980 summer Olympics?

And back to the pros, can Larry Bird lead the
Boston Celtics back the the N.B.A. playoffs?

Finally to boxing, isn’t boxing dead without the
shenanigans of Muhammed Ali?

And despite winning his first professional bout,
wouldn’t it be wiser for Ed ‘“‘Too Tall”’ Jones to return
to football while he still has control of his senses? And
if he does decide to stick to the ring, maybe he should
get Billy “‘Sucker-Punch”’ Martin to manage him.

Oh yeah, did you know that Arizona State Universi-
ty’s controversial recently-fired football coach,
Frank Kush, played a year of freshman football at
W&L? He never completed a semester.

Generals Embarassed;
Down 41-0, Lose 55-21

By Dale Park

The W&L football team drop-
ped its third game in a row last
Saturday in a 55-21 rout at the
hands of the Maryville Scots.
The loss lowered the Generals’
overall season record to 2-7.

Maryville combined an ex-
plosive offensive and im-
pressive special teams effort,
scoring touchdowns in all but
one of their first six posses-
sions.

“We are a young team,” said
Head Coach Gary Fallon. ‘“‘We
started off poorly against
Bridgewater two weeks ago and
against Maryville last week.
The team is still looking for a
leader.”

While Scots’ running backs
Ken Adair and Alvin Nance
combined for 205 yards on the
ground, the Maryville defense
held Generals’ tailback Stewart
Atkinson to only 47 yards on 21
carries.

Maryville beat W&L in a
variety of ways: running, pass-
ing blocking and _ returning
punts.

Midway through the first
quarter, the Scots took over at
the W&L 27 yard line after a
General fumble. Three plays
later, Maryville quarterback
Dave Kibben scored on a kep-
per to put his team in the lead
7-0.

Yet the glaring weakness in
the Generals’ defense was its in-
ability to stop the screen pass.

The Scots scored on their next
two possessions using screen
passes of 44 and 36 yards. Both
plays were run to the left and
caught the Generals out of posi-
tion.

Fallon explained, “We fell
behind early and the tendency

is to press too hard to try to get
back in the game. Some of our
young players still lack the
discipline to stay in their areas
and as a result, Maryville beat
us on the screen plays.”

The second quarter
highlighted Maryville’s special-
ty teams.

Seconds into the period,
Scots’ linebacker Keith Martin
blocked a W&L punt which
teammate Larry ~ Wright
recovered in the Generals’ end-
zone for a touchdown. Kick
Cary Starnes added his fourth
point-after as Maryville rolled
to a 28-0 lead.

Unable to move the ball on its
next offensive series, W&L
punted to Scot return man Steve
Moffett. Moffett took the ball at
his own 47 yard line and spurted
53 yards for another Maryville
touchdown. The point-after at-
tempt failed, and the Scots took
a 34-0 halftime lead.

The second half saw the
return of sophomore Rich
Hachenburg at quarterback for
the Generals and an offensive
recovery.

“Hachenburg: came into a
tough situation and did a fine
job for us,”’ said Fallon.

Hachenburg completed 11
passes for 166 yards — all in the
second half — and helped im-
prove the Generals’ offensive
output from 26 total yards at the
half to 283 yards at the end of
the game.

Scots’ running back Adair
opened the third quarter by go-
ing 65 yards on a trap play for a
touchdown and gave Maryville
a staggering 41-0 lead.

Hachenburg’s passing lead to
the Generals’ two scoring
drives in the third quarter, the
first culminating in a pass from

Hachenburg to tight end Syd
Farrar and the second ending
with a one yard plunge by
freshman tailback Pat
McGuire.

The touchdowns put W&L on
the scoreboard and cut an insur-
mountable Maryville lead to
41-14. “For most of the fourth
period,” said Fallon, ‘we
substituted freely, trying to
give our younger players a feel
for real game action.”

Yet Maryville continued to
pour on the offensive pressure.
Scots’ -running back Melvin
Douglas plunged in from the
one yard line early in the fourth
quarter to up the score to 48-14.

Hachenburg responded
several minutes later with a 19-
yard touchdown pass to Atkin-
son making the score 48-2] in
favor of the Scots.

Maryville was not content,
however, as Scots’ quarterback
Mike Wortman set up a third
and final screen pass to
Douglas, who raced 30 yards for
the score with only 4:28 left in
the game. The successful con-
version iced the 55-21 Maryville
victory.

On the afternoon, the Scots’
wishbone offense rolled up 383
total offensive yards, gaining
an incredible 6.5 yards per play.

The Generals will faee
Georgetown University in their
final game of the season next
Saturday. “The Hoyas, like the
Scots, run out of a wishbone on
offense,’’ said Fallon.
“Georgetown also has a tough
experienced defense.”

Georgetown was ranked
seventh in Division III East last
season and has half of last
year’s 22 starters returning.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.
 

Richmond Wins Again |As / See It:

As W&L Takes Second

In Conference Tourney

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
took second place in the
Southern Water Polo Con-
ference Championships held at
W&L last weekend. The Rich-
mond Spiders ended up as the
Conference Champs.

W&L played four games,
defeating Georgia Southern and
Duke, and losing to Richmond
twice. The Generals first game
was against Georgia Southern,
with W&L winding up on top by
a 15-8 margin.

W&L’s main objective in the
game was to contain the con-
ference’s leading scorer,
sophomore Eric Peterson, who
is respectfully known around
the league as “‘Rocket-arm”’.
This job was delegated to
seniors Mike Foley and Bob
Newcomb, who handled it well
enough to come up with the win.

The next game the Generals
played was against Richmond,
who had earlier defeated Duke.
Richmond won the game bya
score of 9-5.

The first half of the contest
was a display of water polo at
its best, with effective offense
and successful defense played
by both teams before a capacity
crowd.

W&L entered the second half
down by one point, but their
failure to execute properly in
“man advantage’’ situations
prevented their taking the lead.

In the fourth quarter, Rich-
mond was able to capitalize on
errors made by the W&L
defense in their last minute ef-
forts to come from behind.

The third game for the
Generals was a must win game
with Duke University, a team
which W&L had played three

times earlier in the season, with
each game being decided by a
one point margin. The winner of
the game would go to Easterns
in Chicago, and also get a shot
at Richmond the next day.

An improved man advantage
game, a fine team effort, and
superior conditioning on the
part of W&L gave them the vic-
tory, 17-7. W&L’s coach Page
Remillard cited the game as
‘‘an indication of the improve-
ment our team has made since
beating Duke by one here two
weeks ago.”’

The final game was played
between W&L and Richmond. A
W&L victory meant that the two
teams would play a third time
to decide the championships.
Richmond won the game 10-6,
ending the Generals’ hopes for
their first conference cham-
pionship.

Kichmond opened the game
with a fast break offense which
allowed them to jump out to an
early 3-0 lead. But after a time
out and some offensive
changes, the Generals came
back with two quick goals of
their own, and the first half end-
ed with W&L down by one, 5-4.

There are times when
everything goes right for a
team, and the third quarter was
that time for Richmond. Every
slightly errant pass was picked
off by the Spiders and turned
back on W&L.

It seemed as if every time
they touched the ball, the Rich-
mond players could find some
strange way to get a score. The
Spiders scored several ‘‘fluke”’
goals but Remillard stressed
the fact that it was Richmond’s
athletic ability which created
those flukes.

Despite the fact that the
Generals lost the final game,
Remillard was pleased with
their play, and praised it as
‘much improved’’ over their
previous Richmond game.

By virtue of their second
place finish, the Generals have
earned the right to compete in
the Basterns to be held at
Chicago Circle this weekend.
Competition at Easterns will be
extremely tough, and as
Remillard put it, “Should we
win a game at the Easterns, it
will be W&L’s biggest water
polo victory.”

Remillard commented on the
tournament play of Drew
Pillsbury, who played extreme-
ly well and with “a total
disregard for pain.” The coach
also praised the play of Mike
Foley, whose defensive game is
good enough that he “could
have played on any team on the
East Coast’.

The water polo Generals now
hold an impressive 19-5 record,
with three of the five losses
coming at the hands of Rich-
mond.

There is always a tendency to
judge an entire season by the
team’s performance against its
main rival, but this should not
be the case. Despite the fact
that.W&L lost three to Rich-
mond, they beat them once, and
that was something that had
never been done before.

And a record of 19-5 is
something that is not to com-
mon to W&L athletics. Says
Remillard: “I just hope people
realize the tremendous growth
that the water polo program has
experienced this year.

Last Chance

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

Before I commence with this week’s column, let me
make one thing perfectly clear. I am not trying to add
injury to insult. W&L lost, last Saturday, 55-21. The
score just about says it all.

I thought I would mention this for two reasons.
First, trying to cut down a team after it has been
beaten by 34 points is similar to rubbing dirt in the
face of someone who has already been knocked down.
Second (and most importantly), I don’t want my face
rearranged by anyone holding a grudge against me.

But what happened against Maryville cannot go
without any mention. The Generals lost to a team that
was better in almost every facet of the game. W&L
was not defeated by the Scots — they were thoroughly
beaten. es

Look at the ways Maryville scored. They did it in
almost every possible way. The Scots scored on two
short runs, one long run, three long passes, a blocked
punt and a punt return.

But by humiliating W&L, Maryville was actually
doing the Generals a favor. The W&L coaching staff
got to see a welltuned offensive machine and, hopeful-
ly, they were able to see just how much their own of-
fense must be realigned in order to become as potent
as Maryville’s.

Maryville rolled up 55 points because their offense
is diverse. Diversity — remember that word. The
Generals did not start playing with a diverse offense
until the second half. Unfortunately, they were five
touchdowns behind at the time.

The staple of Maryville’s offense are two
breakaway runners — Alvin Nance and Ken Adair.
But did these running backs hurt the Generals with
their running? No, they were much more effective
with their pass receiving. It was the combination of
Adair and Nance on long screen passes which did the
most damage.

And while Maryville was moving the ball with a
combination of runs and passes, the Generals stuck to
their original game plan — no matter how far they fell
behind in the first half. As Maryville went further and
further ahead, the W&L coaches stuck with their
time-consuming, ‘‘three yards and a cloud of dust’’-
style football. Fortunately, they finally saw the light
and loosened up the offense in the second half. Had
they not, it is very likely W&L could have been shut
out.

Here is the big question. Why did the coaches wait
until the second half to change their strategy? Why
did the coaches wait until it was too late before they
varied the offense?

In the second half, the Generals threw more to the
tight-end and set up more screen passes. One tight-
end pass was good for a touchdown while another set
up a short run. The Generals’ other touchdown was
the result of a screen pass. Just why the coaches do
not use this type of offense for four quarters is beyond
me.

If the Generals want to beat Georgetown, they
should do the following. First, start Rich Hachenburg
and give him a chance to make things happen. None
of the other signal-callers seem to be able to generate
as much offense as does Hachenburg.

Also, why not throw on first down? Too many times,
the Generals will run up the middle on first and se-
cond downs, leaving them with third and impossible
situations. In other words, the Generals should say
the hell with being conservative. There is only one
game left in the season; there is no tomorrow.

Please, gentlemen, stop running plays straight out
of ‘‘The Knute Rockne Story.’’ You may win or you
may get run off the field, but when you’re 2-7, you
can’t be choosy. If for lack of any better reason, then
do it for the Gipper.

Dougal: A Jack Of All Trades

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Who is that friendly elderly gent taping ankles in the training
room? It’s W&L’s newest trainer Tony Dougal.

Dougal — a member of the National Training Hall of Fame, a
former professional football and baseball player and the former
coach of six different intercollegiate sports — has been assisting
W&L head trainer Tom Jones with his duties in the training room
and on the sidelines. Most of Dougal’s work has been with the soc-
cer team.

And the soccer team seems to be more than pleased with the
training staff's newest addition. ‘Not only is he a very good trainer,
but he’s such a nice guy. He’s great,”’ said one member of the soc-
cer Generals.

Dougal, an energetic man in his 70s, is a 1933 graduate of Temple
University in Philadelphia. There he lettered in football, basket-
ball, boxing and baseball while majoring in business and physical
education. At Temple, he played football under the legendary coa
Pop Warner.

After graduating from Temple, Dougal played professional foot-
ball as a guard with the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL. A four-
year pro, he also pitched for the Boston Red Sox.

During his stint as a professional athlete, Douglas also served as
athletic director, physical education teacher and coach of also
sports at Smithport High School in Pennsylvania. In 1937, Dougal
went on to coach basketball, boxing and wrestling at West Texas
College.

For the next eight years, he coached football, lacrosse and ice
hockey at the University of New Hampshire. In 1942, his football
team was undefeated. While at New Hampshire, he received his
master’s degree in anatomy and rehabilitation from Columbia
University in New York.

Dougal moved to Dartmouth College in 1947. There he served as
head trainer and assistant coach of football, lacrosse and ice
hockey. After 15 years at Dartmouth, Dougal moved to Boston
University where he was the school’s head trainer and instructor
and supervisor of corrective therapy classes.

Upon retiring from B.U. in 1976, Dougal and his wife, Lucile,
moved to Tampa, Florida. Shortly following this move south, he
became director of aquatics at Eckerd College.

During the spring, Dougal worked with the St. Louis Cardinals
baseball team helping pitchers with sore arm muscles. He also
worked as a part-time scout for the Detroit Tigers.

While in Florida, Douglas became associated with a new sport —
jai-alai. In addition to working at the jai-alai fronton in Ocala, Fla.,
he also worked as the trainer at the Tampa Jai-Alai Fronton—one

 

 

Dougal, a 50-year veteran of physical training. has also worked
with Olympic teams, war veterans, paraplegics and polio victims.
During his career as an athletic trainer, he has attended to athletic
stars such as Pele.

Dougal believes strongly in the preventive and therapeutic

aspects of physical conditioning. ‘I always felt that conditioning
was very important. Each muscle has a job to do and if it isn't
strong enough, it gets sore or injured. The idea is to build up those
muscles so that injuries are prevented,’ he explains.

It is this philosophy that Dougal has brought to W&L. Wishing to
stay in contact with training and still keep his retired status,
Dougal sent an inquiry to W&L with the intention of working as an
assistant trainer.

With W&L needing an extra hand in the training room, this prov-
ed to be a convenient opportunity. ‘We've needed another trainer
around here for the last couple of years... especially in the fall. One
trainer is not enough. There's football, soccer, cross country, water
polo, fall tennis, fall lacrosse, fall baseball and basketball practice.
We havea graduate assistant (Peggy Hogan), but she’s in class two
days a week," explained head trainer Jones.

Enter Tony Dougal.

The arrangement between Dougal and W&L seems to be an ideal
situation for all parties concerned. W&L is getting Dougal’s expert
service which it needed, and Dougal—an assistant trainer but not
considered part of the W&L faculty—can maintain his retired
Status and still stay involved with athletic training on the college
level.

And how have Dougal's services been appreciated at W&L?

oe s doing a great job for us,” said Jones, ‘and the kids love

of the top jai-alai locations in the United States.

Lax Team Completes Bed-Push

by Mare Birenbaum

The Washington and Lee
‘acrosse team had a workout
Sunday they may never forget,
although some of them might
‘want to.

Strangely enough, it involved
t bed, several policemen, and,
after a 10-and-a-half-hour trek,
alot of soreness.

But then, not every workout
‘Will yield between $2,000-$2,500
‘n donations to the team.

That's the amount of money
“o-captain John Hooper
‘astimates the team earned Sun-
‘ay in pledges from people who
sponsored lacrosse team
members to push a bed from
Hollins College to Zollman’s
Pavilion. The marathon bed-
push was the lacrosse team’s
datest episode in their quest to
finance their planned nine-day
nid-winter trip to Bermuda.

Head Coach Jack Emmer
astimates the cost of the trip,
‘which is scheduled for Feb.
16-24 during W&L’s mid-winter
preak, as being about $7,500.
rhe team is scheduled for two-
a-day practice sessions each
day there, something they say
they cannot effectively have in
Lexington because of the
weather.

Prior to last weekend, the
team’s major fund-raising ac-
tivity, had been, selling ‘|acrosse
hats.

It all started at 4a.m. Sunday
when. 17 members of the
lacrosse squad gathered at the
University Center for the ride to
Hollins. Once at Hollins, the fun
began. Two people pushed the
bed while two others acted as
flagmen to keep traffic away
from the rolling bed.

Soon, though, one of the axles
supporting the frame of the roll-
ing bed began to crack, ac-
cording to team manager
Palmore Clarke. The problem
was soon rectified by ad-
ministering athletic tape to the
axle and then conductor tape.

But that was the least of their
problems. After the first four
hours of the push, the team had
pushed the bed only three miles.

A policeman soon visited the
expedition and informed the
team that the permit they were
issued was for hiking on the side
of the road, not for pushing a
bed. Furthermore, according to
Clarke, the officer said that the
permit was from W&L to
Hollins—not the other way
around.

The frame was then dismantl-
ed and two pieces of wood were
inserted on each side of the mat-
tress. Soon the team began jog-
ging, the pace picked up and it
was said to resemble a relay
race. Reinforcements came
about 11 a.m. when the bed mat-
tress, which was now being car-
ried like a stretcher, was out-

- «side of Buchanan, Virginia:

“After about 35 miles,’ said

co-captain John Hooper, ‘‘some
of the kids were losing faith.”
He said it was not overly en-
couraging when he saw a sign
that said Lexington was 15
miles away and then further up
Route 11 a sign said Lexington
was 16 miles away.

Around 3:30 p.m., after the
bed frame was reassembled, a
lacrosse player's girlfriend was
put on the bed, and, clearing the
identification check asked of
them by some policemen near

the pavilion, the marathon end-
ed to cheers of those attending
the S.A.B. party at Zollman’s.

Monday, members of the
lacrosse team said that they
were sore and tired. Roman
Kupecky said, “My legs hurt—
not as much as after a game—
but they ache.”

“It was a long day, an ex-
asperating day,’ said Hooper
about Sunday's activity. ‘But
we made it as a team,” he said,
‘and it will help us.’

Law Ill

Wins IM
Grid Crown

by Marc Birenbaum

Law II built up a 1946
halftime lead and held off Pi
Kappa Phi 19-13 to capture the
Washington and Lee intramural
football championship last
Thursday.

Law II quarterback William
Jeffrey teamed up with
Buckner Wellford and threw
three first-half touchdown
passes. Pi Phi scored in the first
half on an 80-yard kickoff return
by freshman John Buttaruzzi.
The frat’s final score came with
moments left in the game. After
making the extra point, a Pi Phi
onside kick failed and Law II
held on for the win.

In addition to Edwards and
Wellford, another key player
for the winners was lineman
Dave Weaver, said Joe Olive,
student director of W&L's in-
tramural program and head of-
ficial at the championship
game.

With three playoff wins, the
law team—which also won the
Division II crown—finished the
season undefeated with a
record of 8-0. In the semifinals,
second-seeded Law II beat Phi
Kappa Sigma 25-19. Pi Phi beat
number one seeded Delta Tau
Delta in the semifinals, handing
the Division I champs their first
defeat of the season and ousting
them from the playoffs.

Both semifinal games were
decided in overtime.

Reflecting on the intramural
football season, Olive expressed
his concern over the “ongoing
problem” of fraternities not
always supplying referees. “'l
got most of my referees from
Coach Lord’s refereeing class,’
said Olive. He also said he
thought there was a decrease in
blatant roughness in the foot-
ball games this year.

“Football worked out very
well despite the lack of fields
and the rain,”’ he added. This
year the intramural football
program was restricted to only
two fields instead of the four
allowed in previous years, he
said.

Outdoors:

It is still not too late to get into
the field for pre-season scouting
before the opening of hunting
season. Quail, grouse, rabbit
and turkey become legal game
cn Monday and deer season will
commence the following week
on Nov. 19.

The single, most important
element to pre-season scouting
is time. The hunter should
spend as much of it as possible
in field or forest. Since most
hunters do not enjoy the luxury
of ample time to devote to
scouting (not to mention actual
hunting!) It is necessary to
utilize whatever time is
available in the most produc-
tive manner possible. Just one
or two afternoons of intelligent
scouting will greatly enhance
the possibility of a heavy game
bag on opening day.

Intelligent scouting, over-
simplified, is to locate suitable
terrain with ample food and
cover for the desired species.
Quail, for example, will often be
found in heavy cover adjacent
to a pine wood or in areas that
have been clearcut in the past
two or three years and have a
high density of primary growth.
Quail will often feed in
harvested grain fields which
are accessible from deep cover
of any kind. The birds will ven-
ture into the fringes of the field
in the early morning and late
afternoon for a usually short

Game Scouting

feeding period.

Grouse are generally found at
higher elevations than quail,
although in Rockbridge they
will often be found in the same
cover. A typical grouse covert
would be the thickest cover in
the area that is often en-
compassed by an impenetrable
tangle of grape vines.
Overgrown orchards and fringe
areas such as an abandoned log-
ging road or a dilapidated fence
line are also likely spots.

Turkeys forage on a variety
of food, ranging from grasshop-
pers to acorns. A good way to
locate turkeys is to search for
scratchings. A turkey scrat-
ching is an area that the bird
has pawed clear of leaves while
searching for food. The scratch-
ings are quite obvious and spur
prints can often be seen in the
‘disturbed dirt. A flock of
turkeys will greatly disrupt the
forest floor and it is occasional-
ly possible to determine the
direction of their path by close-
ly examining the scratchings.

Keep an eye out for roosting
areas that turkeys will often use
habitually. A roost is identified
by the large amount of dropp-
ings found underneath it. A
single large evergreen tree ina
predominantly hardwood forest
is worth hiking to as turkeys
will occasionally pick this tree
out for a roosting site.

Booters

Last Sunday, the varsity soc-
cer team completed their
season with a disappointing 2-1
loss to rival VMI. Despite the
defeat the Generals improved
over last season and showed
some promising signs for the
future.

The Generals’ overall record
for 1979 was 5-7-1, as compared
to last year’s mark of 3-8-2.
Head coach Rolf Piranian was
pleased with his team’s im-
provement despite missing the
chance for a .500 record with a
win over the Keydets.

As Piranian stated, ‘I’m
sorry about missing the even
record but we went out as win-
ners. We had several op-
portunities to win and fought to
the end.”

The winning goal for VMI was
scored with about five minutes
remaining in the game. This
came after W&L freshman
Brad Poorman tied the score
early in the second half.

The game was very close
throughout as there was no
score at halftime and the shots
on goal were also fairly even.
The Generals had 15 shots to
VMI’s 11. W&L’s player of the
game was midfielder Dana
Samuelson.

In last Tuesday’s game
against Virginia Wesleyan, the
importance of team play was.
demonstrated as the Generals
won 1-0 and denied Wesleyan an
NCAA tournament bid for the
second year in a row.

The player of the game was
given to the entire team. Pira-

nian explained by _ saying,
‘Everyone on the team con-
tributed an equal and important
factor in the victory.”

Looking back at the season,
Piranian was pleased with his
team’s play, saying that toward
the end of the year the squad
was playing the best soccer he
had seen at Washington & Lee
in the past four years.

“After the Radford game
(seventh of the season), the
team Jost many of its in-
consistencies,’’ said Piranian.
We have no regrets about what
happened this year. The team
played good soccer and improv-
ed a lot over last season,’’ add-
ed the coach.

This is especially true of the
defense, which allowed eight
fewer goals than last year and
tied the school record of five
shutouts in one season. The
goals against average for the

year was 1.76.

The offense did not show
much of an_ improvement,
however. They scored only one
goal more than last year and
had a .846 goals a game
average.

Piranian explained this by
saying, “Our problem on of-
fense was not a lack of talent
but a lack of cohesiveness.
Overall, | am proud of the team
this season.”’

The outlook looks optimistic
for next season. The Generals
will lose only four seniors, two
of whom started.

Five freshmen who started
this year, should also return
and play better with a year of
experience behind them. The
new captains for the 1980 team
are Brian Williams and Mark
Turner.

In other soccer notes W&L’s
“B”’ team finished out their
season with a 2-6-1 record.

Sobering Thoughts

The hit-and-run accident involving a Washington
and Lee student driving under the influence of alcohol
(page 4) brings to mind some disturbing thoughts
about our liquor comsumption and the rising in-
cidence of alcoholism throughout the nation.

Our society has practically sanctified the use of
alcohol as an acceptable recreational drug. No one is
very concerned in this country with the mass general
use and abuse of alcohol. When a number of leading
senators, congressmen, and other influential citizens
are forced to endure the painful ordeal of alcoholism,
we can summon only feelings of sympathy, smug in
our self-assurance that it can never happen to us.

But this national lackadaisical attitude rings false,
and we know it. Some 200,000 deaths a year are at-
tributed to excessive drinking. The federal govern-
ment estimates that seven percent of the adult
population in the United States suffer from alcohol-
related problems—that’s about 10 million Americans.
For college age citizens, the estimates hover even
higher—around 19 percent.

The costs of supporting our national alcohol habit
are staggering, too. An estimated $43 billion is lost
each year in lost job time, decreased productivity,
and health care. Is it any wonder that we have an
alcohol problem in this country when the liquor in-
dustry spends $310 million a year on advertising to
promote our habit with the aid of generous tax deduc-
tions? By comparison, the federal government spent
$313 million in 1976 to combat alcoholism through
various programs.

We bring all this up not in advocacy of abstinence
and teetotalism, but as a _ recognition that
alcohol abuse is a serious problem in this country.
The W&L campus is not immune. You probably know
someone who is becoming an alcoholic right now; it is
a process that takes a number of years to evolve. But
you will probably ignore the signs until it is too late—
we havea tendency to close our minds to the problem.

We can only echo the thoughts of others on this pro-
blem: ‘‘The sad fact is that those who challenge the
drinking habits of Americans and the pervasive use of
alcohol as a social crutch—the climate in which
alcohol flourishes—are too often ignored or, worse
yet, attacked for calling attention to this insidious
phenomenon.”’

Editor’s Judgement Questioned

To the Editor:

As a former college
newspaper editor and as a spec-
tator at the Oct. 20 Honor Trial,
I was satisfied with your
coverage of the event. I must
object, however, to the story,
“Phi Editor Ejected,” which
appeared beneath the piece on
the trial.

The story consisted of several
quotes from the editor, attack-
ing the note-taking ban at the
trial. I have three major com-
plaints about the article.

In the first place, an editor
who prints an exclusive story
about himself does so in poor
taste. Such an effort is an
egobuilding puff which at-
tempts to prove what a macho
crusader for freedom the writer
is.

A good editor is a newsman,
not a news-maker bent on giv-
ing himself free publicity. Your
story casts a shadow of doubt on
your ability to understand your
role on this campus.

Secondly, your piece painted
an inaccurate picture. You fan-
cied yourself the hero, battling
the oppressive Executive Com-
mittee and Student Bar
Association. In truth, you were
the abusive culprit.

You failed to mention that you

Persiflage

were warned before the trial not
to take notes. A sign outside Lee
Chapel boldly stated that no
note-taking was permitted, and
the Chairman repeated this
caveat before the trial began.

I agree that an accurate ac-
counting of the facts was impor-
tant, but this does not justify
your violation of an established
policy.

Responsible newspersons
play by the rules even if they do
not agree with them. You acted
improperly in taking notes and
thus have no excuse to attack
the rule you knowingly violated.

Finally, a front page news
story should never contain the
editor’s opinions. If you must
complain about the treatment
you received at the trial, do so
on your editorial page. To at-
tempt to pass your views off ina
news piece is, to say the least,
unprofessional.

The ‘“‘story”’ of your ejection

was an abuse of your editorial
powers. You were not reporting
news; you were grinding a per-
sonal axe on page one.
_ Cheap shots such as this force
me to nod in accord when I hear
others refer to your paper as
“The Rag-tum Phi’’ and other
unprintable epithets.

Parents Weekend

Dear Editor,

Why can’t we drink in the
library?

A child must be about 13 mon-
ths old before it is mature
enough to hold a cup. I don’t
think there are very many pro-
digies this young at Washington
and Lee. Last Friday night, I
did see some fraternity
members spill their drinks. I
doubt this was due to lack of
practice at holding a cup.

Smoking is offensive to a
large number of people. No one
has ever complained about the
smell of my coffee. There aren’t
even special rooms for drinkers
in the library.

There are a large number of
garbage cans in the library. I
can hit two from my carrel with
a crumpled first draft. I don’t
believe the addition of coffee
cups and coke cans to the
general debris and tobacco

juice will overload them.
While I hate to belabor the
point, I study better with

something to drink; be it coffee,
tea, coke, or water. Don’t tell
me about the water fountain; I
have to interrupt my train of
thought to get up and get a
drink. As far as library coffee
goes, if I’m still awake from two
to six in the morning, I’m not in
the library studying. |
If drinking in the library
helps us study more effectively
and adds relatively few pro-
blems to the administration of
the building, why is it pro-
hibited?
George Irvine ’8]

Thanks

Dear Editor,

On behalf of the United Way,
we would like to thank Pres
Henderson, Cockpit night
manager, for his help and
cooperation during the benefit
show we put on last Saturday
night.

Thanks are also extended to
the students who came and
donated their dollars to support
this year’s fund drive. Forty-
five dollars was collected at the
door and has been handed over
to Penny Henneman, a United
Way worker.

We are encouraged by the
response to charity in the face
of other entertainment in the
area last weekend, and plan to
make next year’s benefit bigger
and better.

Sincerely,
Burr Datz
Chris Rohrs

My parents arrival this wekend has in-
troduced a little added pressure into my life.
It’s not that I don’t like seeing my parents, I
mean, sometimes they actually are fun to
have around. It’s just that their immediate
presence seems to interfere with what I see to
be one of main purposes of college.

I came to school, at least partly, to learn
how to handle my own affairs. For the first
time I was making my own decision and liv-
ing with the resulting consequences. Obvious-
ly, over the years I’ve developed my own set
of values on which to base my actions. This is
how it should be for any responsible young
man.

But this process of developing values and
recognizing responsibility is interrupted
when my parents visit and review my actions.
Suddenly, events that I can accept as a nor-
mal part of life require precise and logical ex-
planations. Occassionally, we differ in inter-

preting the results of some of these actions.
For example, I was pretty happy when that
paternity suit was dropped. But all my

. parents could say was that I had been pretty

lucky that the girl had been lost in that freak
boating accident.

Another time, I felt I was pretty clever in
turning state’s evidence when they caught me
with those few pounds of reefer. Yet, instead
of congratulating me on my sharpness, my
parents chose to emphasize the fact that I was
doing something illegal.

With reactions like that is it any wonder
that I haven’t told them that I’ve been runn-
ing numbers to help pay for that small three
car accident I had after the grain party?

It just seems to me that I’m never going to
learn responsibility if they don’t let me
develop my own set of morals. I mean, it
worked for the prodigal son, so why not me?

Letters To The Editor

Coeducation Would Make W&L A Better School

Dear Editor,

I have to agree with one of
Randy Talley’s statements in
his letter to the editor last week.
Randy told us he had to
“wonder about the type of
students we now have.” Our
student body is, as the catalog
states, quite diversified, as soon
as we disqualify half the human
species. We talk about honoring
tradition, avoiding distractions,
and fostering a unique at-
mosphere. I think we should try
to restrict our discussion to
this: would coeducation make
Washington and Lee a better
school?

Traditions are, admittedly,
often a valuable addition to
campus life; the honor system,
for example, makes a positive
contribution to a student’s ex-
perience here. But we should
not cling to traditions under the
assumption that traditions are
intrinsically good. Times do
change, and change renders
some traditions obsolete. We
are living in a world that re-
quires more and more coopera-
tion between the sexes, and the
skills learned at parties are not
the skills that are going to be
most valuable in a few years.
We are going to have to learn to
work with women rather than
concern ourselves solely with
drinking and dancing with those
women.

It is a nice escape to be able to
see a date on the weekend and
then forget her during the week.
But college years should teach
us that we cannot avoid our pro-
blems and_ responsibilities
simply by watching those pro-
blems come and go when we
please. If there are problems
with girls on the weekend, we
should learn to deal with those
problems during the week, too,
rather than be able to avoid
those dealings by sending dates
forty miles away after the
weekend. Learning to face pro-
blems is part of the maturation
process.

We do form firm friendships
on this campus. But we also
learn that friendship is for
males, and it is difficult to have
friends who are girls;
girlfriends are-the only alter-
native. The result is a stifling
social system that pressures
students to find beautiful dates
to show off to other students. It
is nearly impossible, subse-
quently, to avoid thinking of
women as mere objects for
weekend amusement. We con-
struct codes concerning the ac-
ceptability of talking to a
friend’s date: we cannot seem
to be “moving in” on the
friend’s ‘‘catch,” and again we
fail to make friends with a
female. Friendships between
males are an important part of
our social relationships, but
without friendships between
males and females, we get only
a one-sided view of life.

Some students say the single-
sex aspect is a unique feature
that sets us apart from three
thousand other colleges in the
country. I certainly agree that
characteristic sets us apart, but
I wonder if that is the trait we

want to distinguish us. Why
can’t we be unique in the quality
of education we offer, rather
than in our status as one of the
few remaining all-male col-
leges? There is no inherent
value in remaining all-male;
there are some advantages in
being in a top-flight school. We
should direct our attention to
improving the diversity and
talents of the students, thus
distinguishing Washington and
Lee among the nation’s col-
leges.

Proponents of the single-sex
system point out that social life
is quite active—there are often
more girls than guys at frat par-
ties, and the girls’ schools are
nearby if the guys get anxious.
That sounds terrific, but there
are a couple of problems. First,
I find it difficult to classify a
sixty-minute ride over moun-
tain roads as a quick trip to a
“nearby” girls’ school. That is
the smaller problem, however.
Now, the bigger problem. We
might have a great school here
if the social life were as good as
many contend and if social life
were the only facet of college
life. But those who support the
single-sex concept because the
social life is adequate fail to
note the importance of other
facets of college life, notably
academics. Coeducation offers
the chance to hear the woman’s
side of issues—in and out of the
classroom. Especially in
literature and history courses,
this perspective would be a
valuable addition to the class
discussion. With no women in
the classroom, it is almost in-
evitable that male students will
stereotype women as partiers
who have no interest in
academics.

Another strong anti-coed
argument is that W&L offers an
alternative to coeducation. At
first glance, that is a puzzler.
But should we offer that alter-
native when there is so little de-
mand for an all-male school?
Did our 1400 undergraduates
apply here because this is an
all-male school? I hardly think
so; I know I didn’t. Then did
half the students apply for that
reason? Again, I think not. Then
how many of our students are
here because they wanted to at-
tend an all-male school? A
fourth? A seventh? a tenth? I
only know that in my three-and-
a-half years here, I can’t
remember meeting anyone who
said he came here for that
reason. Then do we remain
single-sex to benefit a tenth or
less of the student body?

Back to the main question:
would coeducation make
Washington and Lee a better
school? Because our applicant
pool would double, enhancing
the possibility of our getting
better students; because
students would learn to com-
municate effectively with both
sexes in social academic, and
extra-curricular areas;
because there would be
decreased tension as a result of
the ‘“‘normalized’’ social at-
mosphere. I think our school

would be a better school with
coeducation.

A closing point. Transferring
is not an easy solution for
students who are dissatisfied
with the all-male aspect. There
are many factors to consider in
choosing a_ college, and
coeducation is one of those fac-
tors. But other considerations,
including cost, distance from
home, size, course offerings,
and academic quality are also
important, and the mixture of
those factors may be enough to

prevent a student from leaving
school.

Even without mass transfers,
we should note that there is
much dissatisfaction with the
present single-sex aspect.
Whether that dissatisfaction is
a majority opinion is a hotly
debated question. In any event,
I think the bottom line in this
argument is that a shift to
coeducation here would im-
prove the quality of education
our school offers.

Cold Check Procedures Clarified

To the editor:

The purpose of this letter is to
clear up some ambiguities that
have possibly caused some
hostility and resentment toward
the Cold Check Committee. The
committee also wishes to make
public some _ procedural
changes made this year which

_ have not yet been entered into

the ‘‘Handbook.”’

Let me begin by stating the
purpose of the Cold Check Com-
mittee: To safeguard the
privilege of Washington and
Lee students to write checks in
the Lexington area. This is done
by going around to area mer-
chants, picking up student bad
checks and then bringing the
student before our committee to
present an explanation.

The Committee exists under
the auspices of the Honor
System, one of whose purposes
is to maintain an air of reason in
the activities of the school com-
munity. One of these activities
is the use of checking in the
area and it was deemed to be of
sufficient importance to have
an E.C. sub-committee created
for its control. To give an idea of
the scope of businesS we carry
on, the volume of bounced
checks handled by the commit-
tee during the °’78-’79 school
year was over $4,000 and the
amount already dealt with in
the first two months of this year
is approaching $800.

At the request of the E.C.,
after passage of some rather
controversial policy changes, I
present below the major
guidelines followed by Cold
Check:

1) When a student is found
guilty of bouncing a check, he is
subjected to maximum fines of
$10 for the first offense, $20 for
the second offense and $30 for
the third offense. These fines
may be appealed before the
E.C. within 72 hours.

We carry a full line of Cuisinart accessories plus
gift items, jewelry, gourmet foods and candies.

 

2) After the third offense, the
committee has the option of
referring the case to student
control.

3) A students ‘‘slate’’ is wiped
clean after two years. This has
been raised from a period of one
year to increase the penalties
incurred by students who ap-
pear beforethe committee
repeatedly in their 4 years at
W&L and manage to stay within
the 3 offense range due to spac-
ing of their offenses.

4) The Committee will not
convene unless there is a
quorum present made up of five
members. These five members
must include the three officers
plus two members at large.
This is to erase the possibility of
arbitrary decisions made by the
Committee.

5) Failure to appear
before the committee on the re-
quested date constitutes an ad-
ditional offense.

6) Decisions made by Cold
Check are not based on blanket
policies, rather they are made
after consideration of the rele-
vant racts in each case.

7) There are, however, some
common practices which are
the most frequent causes for a
decision to fine the individual.
These are:

—‘‘Floating’’ a check—

writing checks with the expec-
tation of money coming in from

an outside source.

—Math errors resulting from
the lack of proper control a good
running balance affords.

—Closing an account with
checks outstanding.

—Other math errors such as
not accounting for service
charges and those caused by
slackness.

In the event of a bounced
check, the merchant involved is
the one who suffers and the stu-
dent involved must be made to
bear the consequences. I ask for
your careful consideration of
these matters and truly ap-
preciate your co-operation in
making the actions of the Cold
Check Committee flow as
smoothly and as painlessly as
possible for everyone involved.

President’s Commission On Three Mile

The President's blue-ribbon
panel investigating the Three
Mile Island nuclear accident,
known as the Kemeny Commis-
sion, submitted its report to the
nation last Tuesday. The 179-
page report and foot-high stack
of supporting documents detail-
ed many of the human problems
associated with the accident
and the government’s response
to it.

The Commission had several
findings, among them:
—Abolishing the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
—Creating a new. nuclear
regulatory agency, directed by
a single administrator rather
than a panel of commissioners,
oriented toward solving in-
dustrywide safety problems.
—Empaneling a_ separate,
presidentially appointed com-
mission to oversee agency

blems related to nuclear plants.
—Establishing federally ac-
credited training schools for
nuclear plant operators.
—Conditioning the approval of
new licenses on the adoption of
emergency plans by state and
local government.
—Siting of nuclear plants fur-
ther away from major popula-
tion centers

For the benefit of our readers,
we offer excerpts from a 25-
page ‘‘Overview”’ of the report
by the President’s Commission
on the Three Mile Island acci-
dent:

Overall Conclusion

Our findings do not, standing
alone, require the conclusion that
nuclear power is inherently too
dangerous to permit it to continue
and expand as a form of power
generation. Neither do they sug-
vest that the nation should move

forward aggressively to develop

additional commercial nuclear
power, They simply state that if
the country. wishes, for larger
reasons, to confront the risks that
with
fundamental

are inherently associated
nuclear — power,
changes are necessary if those
kept

risks are to be within

tolerable limits...
Attitudes and Practices

looked, we
found problems with the human

. wherever we

the management that runs the key
organization, and with the agency
that is charged with assuring the
saf safety of
plants...

nuclear power

ifter many years of operation
of nuclear power plants, with no
evidence that any member of the
general public has been hurt, the

therefore, one must continually

We note a preoccupation with
regulations. It is, of course, the
responsibility of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to issue
regulations to assure the safety of,
nuclear power plants. However,
we are convinced that regulations
alone cannot assure safety. In-
deed, once regulations become as
tolumninous and complex as
those regulations now in place,
they can serve as a negative factor
in nuclear safety...

Causes of the Accident

failure of organizations to learn
the proper lessons from previous
incidents, and deficiencies in the
design of the control room. These
shortcomings are attributable to
the utility, to suppliers of the
equipment, and tothe federal
commission that regulates nuclear
power, Therefore—whether or not

Reflecting
On The NRC

“We kept asking: What do these
guys do? But we couldn't find out.”
— A member of the Kemeny com-
mission, reflecting on the NRC.

by Robert Ruby

Washington — When the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission conducts a hear-
ing to license a new plant, the people best
equipped to offer expert views — those on
the NRC’s panel of independent con-
sultants — are now allowed to testify.

If, before the hearing, the staff
discovers a safety problem affecting not
only the new facility but some already
built, the agency takes the seemingly
logical step of classifying the problem as
““generic.’’ But once the problem is so
labeled, the plant can be licensed without
resolving the problem.

Mr. Ruby is a staff correspondent of the
Baltimore Sun, from which this article is
reprinted with permission.

Such procedures are among many ex-
amples by which the Kemeny commis-
sion laconically set forth last week just
how scary business-as-usual at the NRC
can be.

In releasing a stack of carefully word-
ed reports last week, the President’s
Commission on the Accident at Three
Mile Island documented not the physics
but the troubling sociology and politics of
nuclear energy.

The Kemeny commission—so named
after its chairman, John G. Kemeny, the
president of Dartmouth College—made
nearly four dozen recommendations for
lessening the dangers of the NRC’s and
the industry’s methods, but the 12
members wrapped their suggestions in a
gloomy caveat:

“We do not claim that our proposed
recommendations are sufficient to
assure the safety of nuclear power...,’’
the commissioners wrote. ‘‘We must not
assume that an accident of this or
greater seriousness cannot happen
again, even if the changes we recom-
mend are made.”’

 

Instead of finding what it called a
“magic formula’’ for peace of mind, the
commission directed attention back to an
old and often criticized study of the NRC
and the agency it replaced in 1975, the
Atomic Energy Commission.

That report was the product of 60
specialists working three years and re-
mains the basic study of reactor safety, a
report an NRC review committee this
year also admitted to be “‘inscrutable.”’

If it only could have been more easily
understood, the study would have warn-
ed the regulators that the course of
events last March at Three Mile Island
not only was possible but was more pro-
bable than that to which the AEC and the
NRC committed most of their research
funds.

“So much effort has been expended in
criticism of the report,’’ the Kemeny
commission staff said, ‘‘that little atten-
tion has been paid to the messages it con-
tains.”

The messages for the future include
these: During the 1980’s, a 40 percent
chance exists of at least one accident in-
volving a radioactive release. In the
1990’s, the chance rises to 50 percent. The
Kemeny commission staff concluded
that while those risks are smaller than
many others faced by society, ‘‘accidents

similar to Three Mile Island should be
expected.’’

Joseph M. Hendrie, the NRC’s chair-
man, acknowledged much the same in an
interview last week. ‘The aim in regula-
tion here is to recognize that we’re just
not going to be able to achieve absolute
guarantees,’ Mr. Hendrie said. ‘‘What
you try to do then is identify the high risk
points,”

In the case of $1 billion plants, each
capable of generating electricity for a ci-
ty of 500,000 people; it is hard to decide
where to look first. But the Kemeny com-
mission noted that the NRC has hardly
tried; until a month ago, the agency had
never systematically reviewed the acci-
dent reports accumulated since the first
commercial nuclear plant opened in 1957.

Even at the design stage, many
systems are exempt from review. There
is a type of valve, for example, called a
pressurized relief valve, that played a
major role during events at Three Mile
Island because it stuck open—as similar
valves at other plants had done many

times before.

Reactor manufacturers had _ never
been required to test that particular
design because it was protected by a
backup valve. The Kemeny commission
found that the backup valve never had to
be tested either, since the NRC reasoned
that it was backed up by the first valve.

“If you want to know about airplane
crashes, there’s no great mystery—you
look it up in the almanac,”’ observed Vic-
tor Gilinsky, one of the five NRC com-
missioners. “There’s an uncertainty
about the state of safety of nuclear
power. There aren’t statistics. You can’t
look it up.”’

The problem is not only the regulators.
At Three Mile Island, the Metropolitan
Edison Company (the operator and part-
owner) assigned “technical analysts’’ to
study accidents at other plants. But there
was no requirement that the analysts
have a nuclear background; they were
offered no training, nor any instructions
as to ‘‘what kind of analysis they were
expected to do.”’

evitable, the evidence suggests
that the NRC has sometimes erred
on the side of the industry's con-
venience rather than carrying out
its primary mission of assuring
safety.

Two of the most important ac-
tivities of the NRC are its licens-
ing function and its inspection
and enforcement activities. We
found serious inadequacies in
both...

NRC's primary focus is on
licensing, and insufficient atten-
tion has been paid to the on-going
process of assuring nuclear safe-
ty. An important example of this

is the case of “generic problems,”
that is, problems that apply to a
number of different nuclear
power plants. Once an issue is
labeled “generic,” the individual
plant being licensed is not respon-
sible for resolving the issue prior
to licensing. That, in itself, would
be acceptable, if there were a
strict’ procedure within NRC to
assure the timely resolution of
generic problems, either by its
own research staff, or by the utili-
ty and its suppliers. However, the
evidence indicates that labeling of
a problem as “generic” may pro-
vide a convient way of postponing

decisions on a difficult ques-
tion...

The existence of a vast body of
regulations by NRC tends to focus
industry attention narrowly on the
meeting of regulations rather than
on a systematic concern for safe-
ty. Furthermore, the nature of
some of the regulations, in com-
bination with the way rate bases
are established for utilities, may
in some instances have served as a
deterrent for utilities or their sup-
pliers to take the initiative in pro-
posing measures for improved
safety.

... We found serious managerial

talized with insufficient com-
munication among the major of-
fices. We do not see evidence of

‘portions of the industry and its

regulatory agency undergo fun-
damental changes, they will over
time totally destroy public con-
fidence and, hence, they will be
responsible for the elimination of

of energy.

 

Commission Outlines Inadequacies In The NRC

The Kemeny commission noted that
even if the analysts read every report,
their work could not have been good
enough, because the regulators had
never taken into account the entire world
of problems connected with people
rather than machines.

It was the ‘‘people problem,”’ in fact,
that created many of the equipment pro-
blems at the Pennsylvania plant: Control

accident.”

Some of the confusion may have been
due to human failings embodied in the
design of the control room, where more
than 100 alarms lit up in the first minutes
of the accident.

A year earlier, an engineer had com-
plained about the design in a letter to his
supervisor. The Kemeny commission
would later learn that the room’s lighting

“It’s naive to think you can insure the

room engineers were trained to follow
written procedures religiously, pro-
cedures since found to be unclear.

The procedures also were most ap-
propriate for a sudden loss of cooling, re-
quiring extremely fast reactions best
performed automatically by mechanical
means. A slower-moving accident, like
the one that occurred, is more dependent
on the actions of the engineers—who
were not adequately trained to respond.

“This was the tragedy of Three Mile
Island,’ The Kemeny commission
reported, ‘“‘where the equipment failures
in the accident were significantly less
dramatic than those that had been
thoroughly analyzed, but where the
results confused those who managed the

when they were on, and when bulbs burn-

tell where the alarm was coming from.
The operator’s letter was never followed
up.
“The utility industry is by nature a
very conservative industry, particularly
where operation of the plant is concern-
ed...,"” Howard Stevens, one of the con-
trol room designers, told the commission
in explaining the layout.

Metropolitan Edison accepted the
design, he said, ‘‘simply because that it
is the way it was done before, and it
worked, and with no motivation to
change it and a risk involved in chang-
ing, they tend to stay with it.”

Thinking like that caused at least three
members of the Kemeny commission to
reconsider whether utilities should be in
the business of running nuclear plants.
Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona sug-
gested it might be better for utilities to
retain ownership of the plants but turn
over their operation to specialized ser-
vice organizations whose sole business
would be to sell nuclear expertise.

“It’s naive to think you can insure the
safety of nuclear power through regula-
tion, regulation, regulation,” Mr. Babbitt

said. “We miss the point if we don’t
recognize that utilities are the center of
gravity of the whole thing.

“T think to date there has been an
underlying assumption that any utility
that wants a license will ultimately get it.
It’s been tacitly understand that they’re
not going to be shut down. You get it and
then say good-bye.”’

Mr. Babbitt had at least limited sup-
port from fellow commissioners
Theodore B. Taylor, a physicist, and
Patrick E. Haggerty, the general direc-
tor of Texas Instruments, Inc., but the
full membership never voted on the idea
as a former recommendation.

Mr. Hendrie of the NRC would assure
commissioners that things, at least
among the regulators, are much improv-
ed. “‘It’s a different shop,” he said, com-
paring it now to March 28. Congress and
the public have ‘‘sort of been booting us
along.”’

“We should have found Three Mile
Island before it happened,’’ Mr. Hendrie
admitted. ‘“‘No question. No question. It’s
a serious failure.”

But as for the future, the NRC chair-
man, like the Kemeny commission itself,
can Say only this:

“Could I guarantee we’ll never miss
another one?

“Well,’’ he said, ‘‘I don’t like to make
guarantees.”

EC Considers Coeducation

by Joe Scott

A subcommittee studying
coeducation at Washington and
Lee was created by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night.

Members will consist of two
EC representatives, Senior Jay
Blumberg and Vice President
Les Cotter, and an additional
four subcommittee members
will be drawn from the student
body.

Blumberg, who brought up
the motion, said a student body
survey will be conducted to ac-
curately poll opinion on the
question of coeducation. “This
one would be completely ac-
curate,’ said Blumberg who
complained that last year’s
Ring-tum Phi survey could
have been misrepresentative.
“The Ring-tum Phi survey only
took those who wanted to vote,”’
said Blumberg. “By computer
random sampling we could be
sure of accuracy,” he said.

Michael Cappeto, Associate
Dean of Students, has offered to
be the faculty advisor because
of his experience in conducting
other public opinion surveys.

       

 

Other EC representatives
questioned the survey’s ac-
curacy noting students could
give their “gut reaction’ and
not a carefully thought out. opi-
nion. ‘The survey is really pret-
ty worthless unless the students
are aware of the pros and
cons,” said Senior EC Rep. Dee
Kessler. Blumberg responded
by saying it was “impossible to
know all the pros and cons of
coeducation.”

The subcommittee will report
back to the EC when the ques-
tionnaire is completed.

subcommittee member should

Up For

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby made several sugges-
tions for students who are leav-
ing for Thanksgiving vacation
this weekend. ‘‘Holidays are
when (thieves) hit us pretty
hard. The more precautions the
students take, the better off we
will be.”’

Kirby said the following
things should be done to ensure
the safety of your possessions

release occurred in December,
he should retain some of the 400
copies for a January distribu-
tion.

Discussion on the Commerce
School exam distribution ended
in an EC recommendation that
“they should divide it up.”’

Vice President Les Cotter
said he talked to Dean Edward
C. Atwood about the problem
but Atwood responded by claim-
ing the problem was not as
severe as thought.

“It’s definitely a zoo situa-
tion,’’ said Cotter. EC President
Steve Abraham agreed saying
that he “‘sees it as a strain on
the honor system.”’ Abraham
suggested exams be handed out
in the same manner as the
history department. There, said
Abraham, individual teachers
call out the names and hand
each student an exam.

EC Third Year Law Rep.
John Fraser said the Campus
Security Committee’s formal
report will be delayed until
after Thanksgiving vacation
“because of the generally poor
response.’’ He cited lack of at-
tendance at the two security
committee open hearings as one
example.

Fraser said approximately 30
letters sent out had _ been
answered by students, mostly
female law students, and that
the subcommittee was still talk-
ing to those people.

The possibility of offering ex-
tracurricular courses during
the winter term was brought up
by EC Rep. Bruce Poole. The
courses, said Poole, would
range from self-defense to
bartending. EC First Year Law
Rep. Sam Allen, who with Poole
will study the possibility this
winter, said a similar program
he backed at University of
Mississippi was very successful
and well attended.

Colvin Speaks On
SALT II Treaty

by David Greer
The SALT II treaty “is an
issue about which honest men
and women can honestly dis-
agree,”’ said Dr. Milton Colvin
in a lecture on the treaty Tues-
day night.

Colvin, professor of politics at
Washington and Lee, said SALT

ternational documents ever.”’
Colvin said his remarks would
try to ‘get at the sense and
spirit of SALT.”

Colvin favors ratification of
SALT, and suggests that one
read the document or at least
familiarize oneself with the
facts of the document before
forming an opinion. Colvin said
it is a matter of co-existence or

IFC Endorses New Fraternity

by John Billmyre

A group of 15 students is try-
ing to re-establish the local
chapter of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity, which folded under
financial pressure in 1970.

The group took an important
first step Tuesday night when
the Interfraternity Council
unanimously approved a mo-
tion to endorse re-establish-
ment,

According to the IFC Con-
stitution, fraternities that want
a charter at the university must
receive approval from the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee as well
as the IFC.

All social fraternities are re-
quired to be members of the
IFC.

If the group receives SAC’s
approval, it will approach its
National Chapter to establish a

“colony” at Washington and
Lee.

The group will become a
member of the IFC upon receiv-
ing colony status from Kappa
Sigma National.

Tony Weiss, a local represen-
tative of the National Fraterni-
ty, explained to IFC represen-
tatives that the group, if
granted colony status, will have
to prove itself worthy of receiv-
ing a charter.

He said the colony will need 30
charter members who are in-
itiates before it can become an
active chapter.

“No colony can become a
chapter in less than 90 days or
more than two years,” said
Weiss.

Weiss added that the national
fraternity is particularly in-
terested in re-establishing the

chapter at Washington and Lee
because it is the fraternity’s
third oldest chapter.

Kappa Sigma was established
at W&L in 1873.

Several IFC representatives,
noting that the original Kappa
Sigma went into debt so deeply
it had to sell its house to pay
debts, asked Weiss how Kappa
Sigma National plans to help
the local group.

“Harvey Allen, President of
Washington and Lee’s Alumni
Association, has pledged his
moral and financial support,”’
said Weiss.

He said that 900 alumni have
graduated from the Washington
and Lee chapter of Kappa
Sigma and that he anticipated a
great deal of support from those

graduates.

ty,” areas follows:

A ceiling of 2,250 launch
vehicles for each country; the
US will have to build more to
reach this ceiling, the USSR
would have to scrap some. Col-
vin noted that only 400 missiles
could destroy the Soviet Union
and 300 could destroy the United
States.

Of the 2,250, only 1,320 could
be MERV missiles (MERV
missiles carry several smaller
missiles launched from the
main missile much the same
way a shotgun shell works com-
pared toa rifle bullet.)

Each country will be allowed
820 ICBMs to be MERVed.

The Soviets will be limited to
300 heavy missiles (which they
already have). The US will not
be allowed any heavy missiles,
but the US has not developed
any and has instead based its
defense program on _ light
missiles. The United States
negotiators made the decision
to include this clause.

There are no limits on mobile
ICBM systems such as the pro-
posed MX system.

Aircraft that can carry cruise
missiles will be limited to a
2,500 mile cruising range.

Prior notification must be
given of testing.

Neither country may in-
terfere with the other’s verifica-
tion processes.

The Backfire bomber is not
under the treaty, but the USSR
agreed to limit production to 30
per year. Colvin pointed out
that the Backfire bomber has a
range of 5,000 miles and
therefore could not strike the
US and return to Russia.

‘“‘Nuclear war is not much of a
threat.’’ Colvin said. adding

SPE Case Goes To SAC

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council turned a
discipline case over to the Stu-
dent Control Committee Tues-
day night.

“We are not really getting
anywhere with this case, so we
are turning it over to Student
Control,’’ said IFC Presidnet
Syd Farrar.

It was the second time in as
many weeks that the IFC heard
information about the case.

The case involves a raid on
the Sigma Phi Epsilon house by
another fraternity or a group of
students.

IFC Secretary Sam Perkins
conducted an investigation into
the raid and estimated $800
worth of damage to Sig Ep pro-
perty.

Perkins mentioned that no
one was willing to talk about the

incident and Farrar said he
believed Student Control might
be able to gather more
evidence.

According to Judicial Board
members, all evidence
presented thus far was second
and third hand.

From what the Judicial
Board was able to establish, at
11:30 on Halloween night, about
a dozen people ran through the
Sig Ep house, breaking a com-
posite photograph, a television
set and two speakers and ruin-
ing a stereo cabinet.

An antique photo, a banner
and a composite photograph
were listed as missing after a
second raid, which occurred at
midnight.

Perkins said the bill for
damages could be even higher
because the television has not
been checked yet.

before the vote and several
representatives expressed
doubt that W&L needs another
fraternity.

But IFC President Syd Far-
rar spoke in favor of the motion.

“T really don’t think there is
any reason to be paranoid about
having another house on cam-
pus,” said Farrar. He added
that fraternities worried about

_ increased competition should

probably examine their house.

Junior justice Monte Briscoe
asked Assistant Dean of
Students Dan Murphy if the IFC
would be responsible if Kappa
Sigma got into financial trou-
ble.

Murphy explained that the
fraternity is responsible for its
debts and financial affairs.

Law Students Win
Moot Court Debates

A team of law students from
the School of Law at
Washington and Lee University
won first place in a four-state
regional round of the National
Moot Court Competition in
Richmond last week, Nov. 3-4.

Members of the three-man
team were second-year law
students William J. Milani,
Buckner P. Wellford and Kerry
M. Wilson. Law professor
Samuel W. Calhoun served as
the team’s advisor.

The group was judged on the
basis of a written brief and an
oral argument, counting 40 and
60 percent of the score, respec-
tively. As in previous years, the
problem was devised by
members of the New York Bar
Association and was used in all
14 Moot Court regions.

The argument this year dealt
with the Seventh Amendment
“right to jury” in civil actions
that are so complex or technical
that a jury cannot comprehend
the details of the case. Each
team was required to argue
both sides of the question and,
as in the written portion of the
competition, was judged by a
group of Richmond attorneys.

The regional tournament
drew 24 teams from a total of 14
law schools in Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina and
Kentucky. A second W&L team
— composed of students Clara
Smith, John Sullivan, and Neal
Brickman — won against a

team from the University of
Northern Kentucky, but drop-
ped out of play after losing to
the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill by a tenth
of a point.

 

 

Student
Convicted
For Accident

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent has been found guilty of
one count each of hit and run
and reckless driving following
his arrest Halloween night.

Murry G. McClintock, a
senior, answered the charges in
Lexington General District
Court on Nov. 13. He pleaded
guilty to both offenses.

Early on the morning of Nov.
1, McClintock hit a parked Dat-
sun on Washington Street in
front of Davis dormitory and
fled the scene. He was stopped
on Rt. 11 North and charged
with driving under the influence
of alcohol and hit and run. Blood
tests showed a 0.22 percent con-
centration of alcohol in his
blood stream. (0.1 percent con-
stitutes legal intoxication in
Virginia.

McClintock was fined $100 for
reckless driving, $50 for hit and
run, and court costs. In addi-
tion, his privilege to drive in
Virginia was suspended for six
months.

 

 

Thwarting Thieves

tinued during the holiday ;
—also, if you own expensive
sound equipment, which is in
great demand by thieves, write
down the serial numbers and
store them ina safe place.

If you live in town or in the
country, it would be a good idea
to notify your neighbors that
you are leaving and how long
you will be gone.

Another precaution is to
notify the police or sheriff's
department and they will make
periodic checks on your proper-

ty.

Kirby’s advise for fraternity
members living in the chapter
house is to make sure the house

is locked.
‘“‘We have no way of knowing

who’s going or coming from
fraternity houses. A lot of times
we can see a person in a house
and we don’t know whether he’s
a fraternity member or not,”
the police chief said.

Several recent robberies of
students during the current
school year should provide the
incentive to lock up houses and
protect possessions during the
upcoming holiday.

Stolen Camera Found

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent’s camera, worth $400, has
been located after two weeks of
searching by the student and
Lexington police.

The camera was reported
missing from the student’s se-
cond floor library carrel on Oct.
6...

It turned up a week later in
the Jefferson Street Second
Hand Shop. A student who had
used the camera once recogniz-
ed the camera and noticed the

owner’s name engraved on the
camera.

The owner was notified and
went to the store with a police
officer.

But the camera had already
been sold to a W&L faculty
member who gave it to his son.

The owner of the store iden-
tified the man who sold him the
camera and notified police.

Police have been _ in-
vestigating the incident but
have not made an arrest yet.

Students Attend Conference

Wade Forsman and Thomas
Lisk, both seniors at

academic conference on the
Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty at Hampden-Sydney

Nationally-known experts on
arms control and defense
policies had gathered at the Col-
lege to speak out about their
views on the proposed SALT II

fifty students from mid-Atlantic
colleges and universities.
 

Eye & Ear:From

It all begins with a Sunday morning trek to the
Hop-In store. The New York Times and the
Washington Post weigh over five pounds and cost
$2.29. Cheap by printed-work prices today.

There is a certain ritual to be followed in dealing
with this accumulated mass of news, opinions, and
advertisement. A broad expanse of living room
floor is essential, none of which will be visable by
evening.

First comes the sorting out. All colored inserts of
drug store mart sales, all apartments and houses
for rent and sale in New York suburbs are pulled out
for direct delivery to the fireplace. The remaining
sections of both papers are then divided into two
sprawling piles. One contains the comics, Parade,
Outlook, the sports news. These get read with the
support of a large glass of sherry before lunch.

Then the serious gnawing on the solid stack of the
second pile begins. ‘“‘What have you done with the
Post Book World?”’ ‘‘No, I haven’t read the News In
Review yet, so don’t put it with the throw-aways.”’
‘‘Where is Miss Manners and Art Buchwald?”’ ‘‘The
continued part of the article I’m reading is in the
section you’ve got!”’

For business reasons the book reviews get a
careful going over. Someone is sure to turn up
tomorrow saying that he can’t remember the name
of the book but it was in the New York Times Book

The Bookstore

Review on Sunday. Barbara Tuchman has a long
review—depressing—on Henry Kissinger’s White
House Years. She wonders if he has his eye on
elected office and I wonder how many more copies I
should order.

There’s a fascinating book about an unusual
plant, Amaranth, which has a very high protein con-
tent and could help the growing starvation in our
over-populated planet. This is balanced by the arti-
cle about the Thai doctor who pedals around the
country peddling birth control materials along with
ice cream cones and tee shirts which say ‘‘Not So
Many Children.”’

By evening, it’s time to try the New York Times
crossword puzzle. ‘‘Afghan City” ‘Rain forest
plant”’ and “Song hit of 1934’. Fiends must make up
these tortures. Only thing to do is give up on the
lower right hand corner.

Finally, the news itself in all its far-flung
coverage. These Sunday summaries put a perspec-
tive on the week’s piecemeal information. Perhaps
one’s understanding becomes a bit broader; cer-
tainly one’s feelings are heavier. At day’s end,
awash in newsprint, surfeited of words and awed by
the mere logistic of producing such weekly tomes,
the prospect of going back to work next morning
seems simplicity itself.

Rewiew

Independent Record Company
Enters S.F.’s Record Industry

by Mark Kinniburgh
I have determined that the
difference between large record
companies and small, indepen-
dent record companies can be
measured by their enthusiasm
and personal attention.

Enter 415 Records of San
Francisco and another indepen-
dent label with lessons to still be
learned by Warner, Columbia,
and Capitol. 415 began on the
philosophy that the new wave
musie of San Francisco was
good, and the time was right to
start producing records for the
energetic public of San Fran-
cisco’s new wave underground.

To begin, 415 Records does
not sign artists who only have
studio releases or previous ef-
forts on other labels. They opt,
instead for working bands with
local followings and firm roots
in the music they are playing.

Day to day business at 415
Records is not as fast paced as
would be a day at Warner Bros.,
but then again, the money of big
business hype is not present at
415.

When I called San Francisco
for information on 415, I was
treated very kindly on the
phone, and less than a week
later I received all the material
I had asked for and more. Ma-

jor labels with a whole staff
devoted to correspondence can-
not match that figure under any
circumstances.

Howard Klein of the founding
duo at 415 also puts emphasis on
college radio and young record
buyers: ‘Colleges are much
more open to new music, things
that aren’t on major labels.”’
Klein also cites the outrageous
album pricing scale as a real
deterrent to the would-be album
buyer, and explains that opera-

. tions at 415 are geared for ex-

posure rather than sales.

When a major label decides to
print thousands of copies of a
particular single, ‘‘that’s when
the money comes in.” In the in-
terest of exposure, prices of 45’s
and 7’ EP’s are lower than
most commercial singles on the
415 label, and the investment of
a buck is low to hear some of the
trend-setting music around to-
day. Here is a rough sampling
of 415 artists:

ed “‘too aggressive for an open-
ing band”’ by the Rolling Stone,

Sports

From the Pressbox
Exit, Atkinson

by Ray MeNulty
Sports Editor

Thank you Stewart Atkinson.

Thank you for four years of thrilling and exciting
football. Four years—it went by so quickly.

I can still remember 1976—our freshman year at
W&L. I remember watching you cut through defenses
for 469 yards, averaging 3.2 yards per carry. And
don't forget your average of 13.3 yards per catch and
four touchdowns. It might not have been a fantastic
year, but it was a start.

And what a start it was.

In 1977 as a sophomore—despite playing in only
eight games—you rushed for a total of 767 yards, a 4.6
yards-per-carry average and an average of 95.9 yards
a game. This includes two 200-yard efforts. In addi-
tion, you scored six touchdowns—a feat you would
repeat as a junior and senior. At the end of the season
you were a second-team AIl-ODAC selection at run-
ning back—not bad for a sophomore.

1978 may have been your finest year. Only a junior,
you started all of (the team’s) 10 games, set a school
rushing record for most yards gained in one season
(928) and became W&L’s all-time leading rusher with
2,164 yards. You scored six touchdowns averaging 4.7
yards per carry, 92.8 yards per game and 10 yards per.
catch. You were chosen as W&L’s “offensive player
of the game”’ three times and led the team in rushing,
scoring and total offense. Again you were a second-
team All-ODAC selection. What a year!

And your senior year was no disappointment.
Rushing for another 908 yards in 1979, you ended your
W&L career with a school-record 3,072 yards rushing.
Despite the team’s dismal 3-7 record, you went out a
winner.

In your final game, you gained 103 yards on 24 car-
ries and scored two touchdowns to lead W&L to vic-
tory. Your 103 yards enabled you to go over 900 yards
for the season and 3,000 yards for your career. Had it
not been for that shoulder injury in the fourth quarter,
you were a sure bet to break your own single-season
rushing record—you only needed another 20 yards.

The injury was unfortunate, but the ovation you
received was touching. As you walked off the field;
the standing ovation you received was the W&L fans’
way of saying, ‘“Thank you, Stew—you were great!

And great you were.

In 38 games at W&L you: set the school’s career
rushing record with 3,072 yards; averaged over 4.5
yards per carry; averaged over 80 yards per game;
averaged over 11 yards per catch; scored a school-
record 22 touchdowns; set the school’s single-season
rushing record with 928 yards in 1978; had two 200-
yard games (215 against Bridgewater and 213 against
Georgetown) in 1977—both single-game records; and
had the second-longest run from scrimmage in W&L’s
history (82 yards) in 1977.

At W&L, you were the best. You’ve done everthing
the football program could ask of you—and then
some. And W&L has tried to show its appreciation.
You were a second-team all-conference selection in
1977 and 1978, you won the Dan Ray Justice Memorial
Award as W&L’s offensive player of the year in both
1977 and 1978, you were selected as team captain in
1979,.and of course, that wonderful ovation you receiv-
ed when you left Wilson Field for the final time in a
W&L uniform. Each time, someone was saying thank
you.

And so with your brilliant college career now com-
plete, we must say it once again. From myself, the
Ring-tum Phi and the rest of the W&L student body,

‘Thank you Stewart Atkinson—you were great.”

 

Generals Upset Hoyas;
Final Record Is 3-7

by Dale Park

Take two running backs who
gain over one hundred yards
each, add a quarterback who
throws for one hundred more,
toss in a solid performance by
the defense in crucial situations
and what do you get — W&L's
stunning 28-20 victory over the
Georgetown Hoyas last. Satur-
day.

The victory gave the
Generals a 3-7 final record for
the season. Yet more im-
portantly, the win offered the
3,182 fans the chance to see an
entirely new offensive look for
W&L.

Quarterback Rich Hachen-
burg played virtually the entire
game, completing 11 of 20
passes for 115 yards, and led a
much more daring and diver-
sified Generals’ offense.

‘“‘Hachenburg did a fine job,”
said Head Coach Gary Fallon.
‘Rich lost his job earlier in the
season and it would have been
easy for him to become disillu-

sioned, but he struck with it and

came back.”’

After falling behind 7-0 early
in the first quarter, the
Generals engineered a brilliant
16-play, 80-yard scoring drive.
Led by Hackenburg, W&L held
the ball for over six minutes,
running and passing eight times
each during the series. Hachen-
burg took the ball ir in himself
from two yards out, and
Freshman kicker Bill Devine
added the conversion to tie the
score at 7-7.

“We've got the offensive
weapons,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘We
kept them guessing with the
pass and then we would throw a
delay draw at them with Stew
(Atkinson) or Lee (Minetree).”’

The defense play superbly in
the final stages of the game, yet
had trouble’ containing
Georgetown quarterback Bob
Gerard. Gerard, who broke a
41-yard run to set up the Hoyas’
first score, finished the after-
noon with 81 yards.

 

Stewart Atkinson leaves the
game with a 4th quarter injury.

Georgetown immediately
countered with a 12 play, 59
yard scoring drive, culminating
with a six-yard Gerard-to-tight
end Keith Speidel touchdown
pass that resulted in a 14-7
Georgetown lead.

At this point the Generals’
defense stiffened. Holding the
Hoyas on some crucial short
yardage situations, the defense
gave Hachenburg the ball.
Hackenburg in turn gave the
Generals a 14-14 halftime score,
taking his team 55 yards in
eight plays.

The drive was completed as
Senior tailback Stewart Atkin-
son plunged in from one yard
out. Said Fallon, ‘‘the defense
seemed to be taken aback at
first, yet quickly established
itself as the offense came to
life.”’

The stars of the offensive
rebirth, especially in the third
quarter, were Atkinson and
junior fullback Lee Minetree.
Atkinson gained 104 gards on 24
carries, while Minetree picked
up 124 yards on 11 carries.

Atkinson gave W&L the lead
for the first time on his two yard
touchdown run in the third
quarter. Devine missed his first

 

extra point of the season,
however, and the Generals took
a 20-14 lead.

Yet it was Minetree who
“really ignited the offensive ef-
fort’’ in Fallon’s words. On
W&L’s very next posssssion the
junior fullback raced 71 yards
for a touchdown on a brilliant
piece of running.

Freshman Chris Cavalline
made up for the missed extra
point by scampering in for the
two point conversion with a fine
second effort, giving the

_ Generals a 28-14 lead.

Yet a tough Hoyas team came
right back. Return man Jim
Corcoran took the ball all the
way to the W&L yard line.
Three plays later, Georgetown
running back John Federico
scored on a ten yard run. But

the Hoyas’ two point conversion
attempt failed and the score re-
mained 28-20, W&L.

For the enitre fourth quarter
the defense held the Hoyas at
bay. ‘Seeing another wishbone
offense for the second straight
week helped us,”’ said Fallon.

Outstanding defensive
players were senior defensive
back Gene Newtown,
sophomore linebacker Bob
Shaver and freshman
linebacker Bob Boyle, who each
had one interception. Shaver
was especially crucial in stop-
ping a final Georgetown scoring
threat by breaking up a Hoyas’
asss that might have tied the
score. .

The victory was marred by
Stewart Atkinson’s shoulder in-
jury in the fourth quarter.
W&L’s all-time leading ground-
gainer had to be helped from
the field after having his right
shoulder separated during a
scramble for a loose ball.

Atkinson finished the season
with 908 yards, bringing his
career total to a record 3072
yards. Yet more importantly
for Atkinson and the Generals,
they finished the season as win-
ners.

Cagers Out To Regain ODAC
With Deep, Talented Squad

Ass’t. Sports Editor

On Saturday, Nov. 24, while
most of us will be home eating

whose career record at W&L is
242-136, for a winning percen-
tage of .640.

This year’s squad enters the
new season with plenty of bad
memories from last year’s 17-10
season—disappointing only by
W&L’S standards. “Our goals
this year are to reach our fullest
potential as a team, win the

ODAC Championship and go to
the NCAA Tournament,” said
Canfield.

In trying to reach these goal,
the Generals will be a squad
which is more inexperienced
than in past seasons. This
year’s team consists of six
freshmen, four sophomores,
three juniors and only two
seniors.

“Our experience level is not
as high as in the past,’’ said
Canfield, ‘‘but we can become a
good basketball team if we gain
experience. It’s a daily process
we're going through,’’ added
the coach, ‘‘but it will pay off as
the season progresses.”’

One reason for Canfield’s op-
timism is the team’s incredible
depth at each position. In
almost every case, there are at
least two men who can come in-
to the game and do something

Water Polo Ends Year
By Upsetting Richmond

by Dave Johnson

The 1979 W&L Water Polo
team wrapped up their most
successful season ever with one
win and two losses at the NCAA
Eastern Regionals last
weekend. The Generals flew to
Chicago for the tournament, in
which they were defeated by
Bucknell and Indiana before
demolishing rival Richmond in
their final game. The weekend’s
results bring the team’s season
record to an impressive 20-7.

In the Generals’ first game,
played against Bucknell, W&L

lost 19-8 in what Coach Page -

Remillard described as ‘‘the
best team we played all year.”’
Bucknell went on to take the
tournament championship by
defeating Chicago Circle.
Despite the score, the Generals
played well, improving greatly
in an area that has been a
weakness the entire season—
the man advantage situation.

The offensive punch for W&L
was supplied by senior co-
captain Biff Martin, who scored
four of the Generals’ eight
goals. Freshman Bob Marshall
and sophomore Steve LaPrade
drew praises from Remillard
for their play coming off the
bench.

W&L’s next game was a 13-9
defeat at the hands of Indiana.
The game was close throughout

and could have been won by
either team.

The reason that the victory
went to Indiana, according to
Remillard, .is that W&L
“underestimated our potential
for improvement.” In other
words, if they had known a
month or even a week ago how
well they were capable of play-
ing, then they would have had
the necessary confidence to
win.

Once again, W&L’s leading
scorer was Biff Martin, who put
in six goals. Aside from Mar-
tin’s play, the most pleasing
aspect of the game, from
Remillard’s point of view, was
that Indiana, a highly touted
swimming school, was unable
to ‘‘out swim”’ the Generals.

In their final game of both the
tournament and the season,
W&L defeated their biggest
water polo rival, the University
of Richmond, by a score of 14-7.
Richmond got off to an early 3-1
lead but the Generals came
back strong to take a com-
manding 7-3 halftime edge.

Unlike the last two games be-
tween these teams, W&L was
able to put together two good
halves instead of one, and they
continued to dominate until the
final gun.

The key to the defeat of Rich-
mond was, once again, W&L’s

ability to capitalize on man ad-
vantage situations. Against
Richmond, the Generals scored
on 9 of 11 of these six and five
situations.

Drew Pillsbury had six goals
to lead the offensive attack,
while Biff Martin added another
three to the W&L score. Martin
was the Generals’ leading
scorer in the tournament with
thirteen goals. The W&L
defense was led, as usual, by
the fine play of seniors Mike
Foley and Bob Newcomb.

Looking forward to next
year’s water polo season, Coach
Remillard can only lament over
the graduation of four seniors
whose play was instrumental in
the success of the team: Foley,
Martin, Pillsbury and
Newcomb. All four of these
seniors were awarded All-
Southern Conference honors
and Pillsbury was also honored
as an All-East Honorable Men-
tion recipient.

Commenting on the fine per-
formance of his first team at
W&L, Remillard had high
praise for his team, saying:
“Considering personalities, at-
titudes and talent, I will con-
sider myself very fortunate if I
ever coach another team like
this.”’

With a 20-7 record, that’s not a
difficult statement to believe.

Burger King
Is Back Again

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

Welcome back, Burger King man — we certainly
missed you. Burger King man, otherwise known as
Rich Hachenburg, returned to Lexington last Satur-
day and threw his magical football all over the field
as the Generals rolled to a 28-20 win.

Now surely you remember B.K. He was last year’s
darling who started eight of W&L’s ten games and
won many a fan’s heart with his rah-rah, go get ’em
spirit.

Early this year, however, the Burger King was
playing more like a Burger Commoner, and Hachen-
burg soon found himself standing on the sidelines as
the Generals’ third-string quarterback.

But as the season progressed, the Generals degress-
ed. Suddenly, the Burger King was in the running
again and, in a scene seemingly straight out of
Grimm’s Fairy Tales, our hero was able to vanquish
his rivals and once again rule over the offense.

It almost seemed anti-climactic that Hachenburg
would complete 11 of 15 passes for 115 yards. But, then
again, who’s ever heard of a fairy tale without a hap-
py ending?

Realistically, of course, Hachenburg (and the en-
tire Generals’ offense for that matter) did not succeed
due to a magical football. The bearded signal-caller
was able to produce four touchdowns out of a little ex-
tra effort and a lot of old-fashioned, common sense.

Instead of playing three yards and a cloud of dust
football (although three yards and a bucket of mud
seemed more appropriate last Saturday), the
Generals came at Georgetown with a balanced run-
ning and passing attack. The Hoyas seemed so con-
fused-after W&L’s first two drives that the Generals’
predictable Power-I formation must have looked
more like a Power-Questionmark formation.

The big switch was so simple, yet so effective. In-
stead of plugging it up the middle on first down,
Hachenburg took to the air, usually finding his
receivers open on short slant-in or down and out pat-
terns. On the Generals’ first scoring drive, for exam-
ple, Hachenburg threw eight times while handing off

 

 

. eight times, covering 80 yards in over six and a half

minutes.

Hachenburg’s short passes had another effect on
Georgetown’s defense. The Hoyas’ linebackers, a
group that likes to blitz on first and second down
situations, had to play off the line, giving W&L’s run-
ning backs the unique experience of having some run-
ning room.

In these instances, Hachenburg would drop back to
pass, pushing the Georgetown linebackers deep, and
then hand off to Steward Atkinson or Lee Minetree.
Atkinson, who gained 103 yards in less than three and
a half quarters, had runs of 17 and 10 yards courtesy
of the delayed draw. And Minetree, used mostly in
short yardage situations, raced for a 71-yard
touchdown run because Georgetown was guessing
pass, instead of run, on first down.

Hachenburg was the leader of an offense that was
exciting, unpredictable and, most importantly, effec-
tive. For the first time this year, the Generals’ offense
played with the wide-openness that is the trademark
of college football. Last Saturday’s effort may have
been a bit madcap at times, but it worked.

And, as the Burger King would gladly admit, there
is something magical about that.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Kick The Habit

The American Cancer Society has proclaimed to-
day a national non-smoking day. We lend our support
to this day of common restraint from smoking
cigarettes and other forms of tobacco and urge the en-
tire university community to join with smokers
across the country in their abstinence.

Scientific studies have shown, with little room for
doubt, that smoking can lead to cancer and is
dangerous to the nation’s general health. There is
strong evidence that Americans and people living in
some of the other advanced industrial nations are
smoking less because of high taxes and health warn-
ings about the harmful effects of cigarettes.

But despite the advances of this country in kicking
the cigarette habit, the United States is manufactur-
ing more cigarettes than ever before and we are ex-
porting nearly 67 billion cigarettes — twice as many
as we exported in the early years of this decade.
Among other industrial nations, West Germany ex-
ported 24 billion cigarettes in 1977, or about four times
more than it had sent abroad six years earlier. Bri-
tain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland also showed
important export increases in the late 1970’s. The
Soviet Union and China are eager to jump in to the
cigarette export business.

In fact, world consumption of tobacco reached a
new record: 4.69 million tons last year (that’s 4.2
trillion cigarettes, 100 billion more than were smoked
in 1977). But if the industrial countries are consuming
less and exporting more, where are the increases
coming from? Japon accounts for some of the in-
crease in tobacco consumption, despite the efforts of
an antismoking drive that includes educational pro-
grams, health warnings on packages, and advertising
limits. Rapidly-developing Venezuela also has an in-
creased demand for cigarettes.

Most significantly, however, the smoking increases
have come primarily from the world’s emerging third
world countries. The industrial nations are sending
the poorer countries the cigarettes they discourage
their own citizens from smoking. The Worldwatch In-
stitute, a nonprofit research organization supported
by the Environmental Program of the United Na-
tions, describes the situation in part of the Third
World this way:

“Throughout most of Africa, venders must break
open packs and sell cigarettes one by one...In isolated
Sudanese towns, tor example, one sees young men
with annual incomes equivalent to only a few hundred
dollars buying Benson and Hedges cigarettes at 10
cents apiece.’’ In 1977, the Sudan made about 700
million cigarettes and imported an additional 900
million. Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest coun-
tries, produced 11.65 billion cigarettes in 1977, and the
pattern is similar throughout Asia and Latin
America.

The United States government is actively par-
ticipating in the moral contradiction between warn-
ing its own citizens against an American product
which is exported for other people to consume. And
cigarettes are big business, too, bringing in as much
as $66 million annually because they are exported
under the easy terms of the Food for Peace program.

As we nervously bite our fingernails today while
trying to refrain from lighting up a cigarette, we
should consider the moral implications of shipping
out dangerous products for others to consume and the
irony of making them easy to purchase under the
Food for Peace program.

More On Coeducation

dear editor 2

once again that commie radical palmore clarke
has had the audacity to suggest that we abandon our
time honored tradition of the single sex system does
he not realize that when one tradition falls by the
wayside no other sacred tradition is safe from the
mad liberals let single sexism fall and every other
cherished aspect of our dear school will fall like
dominoes is the man blind our school is quite
diverse we have students from choate, andover;
westminster, woodbury forest, students from those
public high schools too clarke has admitted the
value of tradition yet he sarcastically mentions the
honor system academic excellence and campus size

s not be ridiculous everyone knows that the majori-

refusal to allow the inferior sex admission shall we

Wednesday
Nights

Dear Editor:

I read with great interest
your article about the assault on
the SPE house last Wednesday
night.

Ah yes, Wednesday nights,
weren’t we just told by the
faculty last year that it was to
be a night of study? :

Yet some faculty members
saw fit to let their children loose
on the town for a night of riotous
fun at the expense of the poor,
studious SPE’s. Didn’t the
faculty’s proposal on frater-
nities cite weeknight parties as
disruptive to the academic en-
vironment at W&L?

As any Ayatollah knows, loud
music is a much more disrup-
tive force than a little harmless
violence.

Additionally, | was wondering
whether the fraternity inspec-
tion committee will be willing to

overlook this latest bit of Photographers
shameless destruction of frater-
nity property?

Obviously, the above- Illustrator

mentioned incident is no way
mitigates the well-documented
faults of the fraternity system.
Yet it does place them in an in-
teresting perspective.

different. Moreover, several
players can play at more than
one spot.

The point guard situation is
“stronger than ever,’ ac-
cording to Canfield. Captain
Pete Farrel (6’0’’) is the ob-
vious starter and is backed up
by at least two other team-
mates.

George Spears, a_ 6’0”’
sophomore, has been converted
from shooting guard fo the point
but can play either position in a
pinch. The other point guard is
Rob McDevitt, a 5’10”’
freshman, who is straight out of
the Mike Wenke mold.

The point guard position
should be the most point-
productive area on the court.
Starting there will be Carby
Hoy, a 6’1’’ junior, who could be
an All-American by the time he
graduates. Hoy was the team’s
leading scorer last season.

Backing up Hoy will be a pair
of sophomores. One of them, 6
6’2”’ Clark New, ‘“‘has to come
off the bench and score” ac-
cording to Canfield. The third
guard, Chris Schrauth, can play
either guard position but is still
recuperating from a severely

sprained ankle.

The small forward position
will also be strong, as Tom Jef-
fries, a 6’3” senior and last
year’s leading rebounder will
pe the starter. ‘“‘We’re looking
for more consistency from T.J.
this year,’’ said Canfield.

The strong forward position is
also deep. R. J. Scaggs, a 6’2”
junior who took over the posi-
tion last year, is the likely
starter. “I wouldn’t hesitate at
putting ‘“Rags’’ anywhere on
the court,’’ commented Can-
field.

Backing up Scaggs is Travis
Patterson, a 6’5’’ sophomore
who saw limited playing time
with the varsity last year. Jay
Fecktal, a 6’5”’ freshman, gives
the ‘four’ position three-man
depth.

Rob Smitherman, a 6’7”
junior, will be the starting
center.. In Canfield’s words:
“Rob has improved more than
the other players. He plays as
good a team defense as any
center I have had.”

If he gets into foul trouble,
Smitherman will be replaced by
one of three freshmen, all of
‘whom stand at least 6’6’’. Bri22
Hanson, a 6’6”’ freshman, ap-
pears to be the second center.

Three other freshmen, Rick,
Melvin, Frank Epps and Steve
Jones, will also play in the
pivot. All three players stand at
vy.

The Generals start the season
with what Canfield calls ‘‘five
tough games.” The Generals
open with Southeastern and
Bowie State, two black schools
from Washington, D.C., and
then travel to Maryville (a
team they lost to last year.)

The W&L will then play three
games at home against
Roanoke, Hampden-Sydney and
Shenandoah. The H-S game will
also serve as a good indicator of
the OCAC’s strength this year.

“Lynchburg is the conference
favorite,’ said Canfield, ‘‘but
we are the team to beat for
anyone to win the champion-
ship.’”’ Both Sydney and Lynch-
burg return All-Conference
players in Ed Owens and E.D.
Schecterly, respectively.

This preseason, Canfield has
been more demanding than
ever before. ‘I want to carry
this toughness into game situa-
tions,’’ said the coach. ‘Any
team that beats us will have to
do it by playing better. We will
not beat ourselves.”

SALT No Threat To US Security

(continued from page 1)

that conventional war poses a
more realistic threat.

Colvin said that missile
superiority has not worked as a
deterrent in the past from keep-
ing the USSR from doing
anything it wants to. Russia has
been “‘fighting wars by proxy”’
with the US even when the US
had missile superiority to the
Soviet Union; Colvin pointed to
incidents in Korea, Vietnam
and the Mid-east as examples.

Colvin said the Senate is
basically divided into four
groups on the SALT issue,
being:

The McGovern group, which
is lukewarm or hostile toward
SALT, saying it keeps the same
race going rather than stopping
i:

The Jackson group; which
says the treaty is adequate and
a step in the right direction and
that ratification is not in-
compatible with US arms build-
up and development; and

The Administation, which
feels the treaty is not all it wish-
ed but is all that is negotiable
and is a step on the road to
meaningful arms control;

The Goldwater group, which
feels any negotiations with the
Soviets are bad.

Colvin said no NATO nations
officially object to SALT, but
“total commitment of our Allies
is suspect”’ since the US is “‘the
dog of NATO and the other
countries are the tail.”’

“At every level, both civilian
and military, you have people
on both sides of the issue,”’ Col-
vin said.

In answering audience ques-
tions, Colvin said any cheating
on verification would not give
either nation a decisive edge, as
any cheating that might would

be detected by intelligence
forces. Colvin added that ac-
cusations of Soviet violations of
agreements of the Nixon and
Ford administrations have been
denied by US intelligence and
military sources.

Colvin does not feel the SALT
agreement will endanger fur-
ther development of defense
techniques, saying “‘the US has
all the alternatives it needs,”’
such as the MX system and
other proposals.

As for the question of using
SALT for leverage on other in-
ternational issues, Colvin said,
“It is childish to believe we can
deter the Soviet Union from do-
ing what it wants to do,
especially within its own
borders and in countries it con-
tols. They will not behave any

differently because Senator
Jackson says. to on the Senate
floor.”’

Several students were han-
ding out literature condemning
SALT at the lecture.

The literature was printed by
the young Americans for
Freedom. According to
member David Tyson, a
freshman at W&L, the organiza-
tion is the largest conservative
political group, with 80,000
members and supporters.

Tyson said the group is non-
partisan and purely conser-

‘vative. An essay in the pam-

phlets encouraged not ratifying
SALT as it would give the
Soviets too great a military
edge and that the Soviets and
International Communism is a
viable threat to the United
States.

How The Rally Was Reported

by David Greer

The Associated Press
reported in a news summary
yesterday ‘“‘a crowd of scream-
ing anti-Iranian demonstrators
in Lexington last night tried to
take over a radio station on the
campus of Washington and Lee
before it dispersed.”’

A later report said that a
crowd of about 50 ‘‘went to the
school radio station, WLUR”
and left after it was read a
report on the demonstration.

Despite the way it appears,
the WLUR staff did not have to
contend with two groups of peo-
ple in their facilities. Each of
the above reports describes the
same event.

Many students were amazed
to read that they had been part
of a ‘‘screaming, torch-bearing
mob as hundreds marched
through city streets.’’ Ac-

EC Takes Firm Stand
Qn Security

by Joe Scott

An Executive Committee
report studying the security
problem at Washington and Lee
suggests that persons acting
suspiciously who are not con-
nected with the University be
arrested for trespassing.

The subcommittee report was
approved at the Dec. 3 EC
meeting, Monday night.

“All in all, the report was a
good report, especially the law
section,’’ said
Sophomore EC Rep. Jim
Wenke. (The report is reprinted
in its entirety at the end of this
story. )

“It is a very broad topic,”
said Junior EC Rep. Bruce
Poole. ‘‘The real sore spot was
the no trespassing policy. What
it comes down to,” he added,
“is that any time you have a law
to enforce, it is up to the discre-
tion of those who enforce it. You
can carry any law to the ex-
treme.”’

“T just wanted to say that the
wording could have been bet-
ter,’”’ said first-year Law Rep.
Sam Allen. He was referring to
the deleted word ‘‘juveniles’’
which was replaced by “any
member not involved or con-
nected with the W&L communi-

ty.” Allen added that it could
create problems between the
town and the University.

“Students aren’t taken very

seriously in this town,” said
Ring-tum Phi Editor Randy
Smith. ‘“My own opinion is that
the Commonwealth’s Attorney
and police should vigorously
prosecute vandals.”’

Anti-lranian Rally
Marches On Lex

by Dick Moss

What began as a peaceful, if
somewhat rowdy, anti-Iranian
rally of about 400 Washington
and Lee students in the Law
School field last Tuesday night
ended in a mob march on Lex-
ington and the Virginia Military
Institute.

The flag-waving, torch-
bearing, banner-swinging
crowd repeatedly sang patriotic
songs amidst chants such as
“‘Nuke ‘em till they glow’, “‘It
worked in Japan, do it in Iran”
and ‘‘Test the Neutron bomb.”’

The mob wound its way from
the law school field to Main
Street in Lexington, where it
then moved to the police station
behind the R.E. Lee Hotel to
rescue one of its brethren who
had been picked up by police.
They then marched on the
Virginia Military Institute, and
returned to the Washington and
Lee campus after about an
hour.

It all began with an anti-
Iranian rally on the Law School
field, where the Ayatollah Kho-
meini was burned in effigy
three times. A speech was also
given on the field by freshman
Jim Gerrard which was pretty
well drowned out by the crowd.

 

The rally was organized by
Gerrard and a_ group of
freshmen students here at
Washington and Lee, to ‘‘show
that we aren’t going to stand for
letting anybody push this coun-

try around.”
After the crowd tired of this,
shouts of ‘‘March on Lex-

ington!”’ rang through the air.
The organizers of the rally had
not planned on this occurrence.

The mob then marched up
past the gym and down
Washington Street, singing and
disrupting traffic, until they ar-
rived at Main Street, where
they turned south. At the in-
tersection of Washington and
Main streets, two Lexington
policemen attempted to stop the
demonstrators, with little suc-
cess.

As the crowd began to near
the intersection- of Main and
Preston streets, another patrol
car stopped, and picked up one
of the demonstrators, Steve
Johnson, a W&L student, for
carrying a torch on the street,
and he was taken to the Lex-
ington Police Station.

The mob followed them there,
and stood outside of the station
chanting ‘‘Free the hostage!”

Johnson was released after

The awarding of tenure ap-
pointments, an accepted faculty
hiring practice here at
Washington and Lee, affords
tenured instructors a _ large
degree of job security; this
same practice can also make
the jobs and careers of
untenured instructors very in-
secure.

“I will be on the job market
this year,”’ relates Assistant
English Professor Carren
Kaston. Like two of her English
Department colleagues, Assis-
tant Professors Robert Fure

English Department’s Tenure Dilemma

that she would probably not
receive tenure.

The English Department’s
dilemma stems from what John
Swift calls the Department’s
decision ‘‘not to be tenured up.”’
Most of the instructors in the
English Department have
tenure, including Associate
Dean of Students Robert
Huntley and Associate Dean of
the College Edwin Craun, who
temporarily left their teaching
duties to assume ad-
ministrative positions. These
instructors plan to return to
their teaching positions even-
tually and the English Depart-
ment cannot confer tenure upon
any of the instructors presently

occupying those vacancies.

There is presently no pros-
pect for any instructor in the
English Department who has
not already received tenure to
obtain a tenure appointment.
Rather than contract any or all
of these three instructors for an
additional term appointment
that may extend their careers
at Washington and Lee beyond
seven years, at which time
tenure is automatically confer-
red, these instructors must be
discharged.

Dr. Sidney Coulling explains
that shrinking enrollments in

Mock Convention Report

Alumni
Accept
Convention
Invitations

Two alumni of Washington
and Lee University who are now
prominent in Republican party
politics — William Brock III,
national GOP chairman, and
U.S. Sen. John W. Warner of
Virginia — have accepted in-
vitations to take part in the
W&L student body’s 17th Mock
Convention next May.

Brock, a 1953 W&L graduate
and former U.S. Senator from
Tennessee, will deliver the
Mock Convention’s opening ad-
dress, and Warner, a 1949
engineering graduate, will be
parade marshall.

The Mock Convention will
take place May 9 and 10.

GOP Chairman
Brock

Brock has been national party
chairman for two years and is
credited with impressive suc-
cess in rebuilding the party’s
grass-roots strength. His open-
ing address May 9, defining the
Republican National Commit-
tee’s view of the 1980 Presiden-
tial race, ‘‘will be the capstone
to our three years of prepara-
tion,” according to student of-
ficials of the Mock Convention.

As grand marshall of the
lavish parade through Lex-
ington that traditionally kicks it
off, Warner will be the Mock
Convention’s principal good-
will ambassador, the students
said. The parade, which is ex-
pected to have more than 60
floats and a_ considerable
number of marching bands, not
to mention an actual elephant of
certified Republican lineage, is

  

WILLIAM BROCK

tentatively scheduled for 11
a.m., alsoon May 9.

Both Brock and Warner have
been active in GOP politics
since the early 1960s. Brock
began his series of upset vic-
tories over Tennessee
Democrats in 1962, when he was
first electsd to the U.S. House.
He was elected to the Senate in
1970, and in 1974 his party col-
leagues there chose him to head
the Republican Senatorial Cam-
paign Committee.

Senator
Warner

After he assumed the chair-
manship of the national com-
mittee in 1977, he sought to re-
establish its strsngth after the
declines associated with
Watergate and Richard Nixon.
In his initial test, the by-
elections in 1978, Republicans
gained almost 300 seats in state
legislatures across the nation,

Warner, who has been a
member of the W&L board of
trustees since 1968, became in-
volved in Republican politics as
a participant in several cam-
paigns, also in the ‘60s. He was

Late Story

 

Vandals Hit W&L,

Damage Boxwoods

by David Greer
Vandals damaged several
boxwoods on the Washington
and Lee University campus last
night. University spokesmen
say the damage could be as high
as several thousand dollars.
According to a university of-
ficial, extensive damage was
done to about two dozen English
boxwoods outside Newcomb
Hall, Tucker Hall, Howe Hall,
and the Dean of Students office.
No reason could be found for
the destruction and there are no

suspects. It is not known
whether the vandals were
students or local youths.

Apparently the vandals
jumped in the bushes or ripped
out the center branches.

Most of the plants can be sav-
ed, said a university
spokesman, but there will be
problems, as the plants grow
very slowly. For example, the
plants outside the Dean’s office]
are over 50 years old.

University Proctor Bob Mur-
ray is investigating the inci-
dent.

 

 

devotes particular attention to
efforts to keep down federal
spending and to limit the expan-
sion of federal powers.

Brock and Warner join
another Republican dignitary in
the 1980 Mock Convent.ion
lineup — keynote speaker
Barry Goldwater, whose ap-
pearance was announced
earlier this month.

Over Thanksgiving Break

Students’ Stereos Stolen

by Sam Campbell

Several robberies of
Washington and Lee student
property occurred during the
Thanksgiving vacation.

Scott Crawford, a member of
Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
reported that a padlock on his
door was ripped off its hinges in
the fraternity house. He listed a
Kenwood receiver, two Ken-
wood speakers, a_ leather

Several instances of van-
dalism occurred on Washington
and Lee’s campus over the
Thanksgiving break.

reported a glass door off one of
the bulletin boards in front of
Payne Hall was torn off and
broken, as were several win-
downs windows in the building
itself.

Damage was done to the com-
puter system by a vandal on the
last Saturday night of break. An
adolescent reportedly threw
eggs through the wire protec-
tive cage at the central process-
ing unit after he had been using
a terminal.

value of the missing goods was
estimated at $650.

member of Delta Tau Delta,
reported that a Sansui tape
deck and two Fisher speakers
were missing, along with 50
record albums. Total value ex-
ceeded $700.

permanent and was limited to
external cabinets, the egging
could have been costly if they
had reached the electronics.

The vandal apparently was
not a member of the W&L com-
munity, but had gained access
to the computer through a stu-
dent who had given him his user
number. The student who
divulged his number acted in
violation of the pledge signed at
the beginning of the term by all
users to protect their numbers
and access to the computer,
university officials said. He was
easily traced by the work areas
opened in areas opened at the
time of the incident.

Student Hits Centel

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent has been charged with
Driving While Intoxicated after
he drove his jeep into the Centel
building downtown, early Satur-
day morning.

Mark Turner, a student from
Gainesville, Ga., was arrested
at 12:35 a.m. on Dec. 1. The in-
vestigating officer estimated
the damage to his 1978 Jeep
CJ-5 at $500. Centel has not yet

provided a damage estimate.

According to the police
report, Turner made a left turn
from Randolph Street onto
Washington Street and lost con-
trol of his vehicle. He then
struck the Lexington Telephone
Company office.

A passenger in the Jeep, Alice
Porterfield, was injured in the
incident.

Bob Campbell reported a
small amount of money missing
from the same fraternity house.

upstairs rooms. Chairs and
tables were overturned, broken
or scattered. Nothing was
reported missing from the
house.

 

News Brief

Pigs In
Uniform

The Army used pigs in the
1950’s to test for radiation when
the effects of atomic blasts
were being investigated, a book
slated for release next summer
discloses. ’

The book, ‘‘Atomic Soldiers’”’
by columnist Jack Anderson’s
associate Howard Rosenberg,
details how the Porcine Platoon
was shaved, showered, and
neatly tailored in little U.S. Ar-
my uniforms—corporal pigs
had strips, officer pigs had
bars. All of the pig brigade were
quartered in the Pork Hilton,
near the atomic blasts.

There were really two groups
of test hogs. The First Pig Bat-
talion, fed downers and left out-
side all night, died from their
exposure. The Second Pig Bat-
talion had to wait so long for

 

their tests that they all grew out
of their uniforms and had to
have new outfits tailored, at
taxpayer expense, of course.

Finalizes
Dance

Plans

Plans are being finalized for
Washington and Lee’s Second
Annual Muscular Dystrophy
Dance Marathon to kick off its
fund-raising effort on the
weekend of Jan. 25-26.

The grand prize, for the
dancer who raises the largest
total of pledged contributions, is
an all-expense paid trip for two
to Nassau for three days and
two nights. In addition, there
will be a number of door prizes
and other special events.

Scheduled to wind up the
festivities are the Vandales, a
popular soul band from the
past, who will play for the
dancers from 10 p.m. until 2
a.m. Saturday night.

The Dance Marathon ex-
travaganza is officially titled
“Fighting M.D. for 30 Hours,”
and will have a boxing motif
with the participants dancing 30
rounds in their fight against

muscular dystrophy, a crippl-,

ing and fatal disease that at-
tacks the victim’s muscle
tissue.

Co-chairmen Jay Blumberg
and Jay Hemby told the Ring-
tum Phi that they have at least
50 Sweet Briar and Mary
Baldwin College girls already
signed up to dance. ‘‘Last year
we had more girls than guys.
This year we want at least
enough W&L guys to occupy all
the girls,’ Blumberg said.

The goal for this year’s Dance
Marathon is to raise $15,000. Ap-
proximately $13,000 was raised
last year.

After that episode, the crowd

Iranian Cadets FromVMI

 

 

but toward the 50,000 Iranian
students in this country as well.

There are currently no Ira-
nian students here at
Washington and Lee, and there
have not been any since 1974.

There are however, eight Ira-
nians currently attending the
Virginia Military Institute near-
by. Fortunately, they have not
yet suffered any hardships from
Americans due to the crisis in
their homeland.

The eight students are all
seniors, expecting to graduate
in May of this year.

That expectation received a
jolt last week when Governor
Dalton announced at a press
conference in Alexandria that
he is considering a request by a
member of the Virginia

Tehran are released. This
would apply to the cadets at
VMI

When Major J.L. Adams,
publicity officer at VMI, was

station in Reid Hall, dispersed.

asked about the possibility of
suspension for the Iranian
students, he replied, ‘‘We can-
not comment on that now. We
would probably have to comply,
but we’ll face that situation
when we come to it.”

Adams added that the Iranian
cadets “came here for an
education, and we are giving
them that. Our policy is to treat
them as any other student, and
we intend to stand by that.”’

The eight Iranians are all
members of the Iranian Navy,
and are at VMI in that capacity.
When asked if he thought this
presented a conflict of interest,
Adams repeated, ‘We do not

plan to treat them differently.”
It must be remembered
however, that all of these cadets
were members of the Shah’s
navy when they came to VMI.
For the time being, the Ira-
nian cadets at VMI, like the rest
of the world, can do nothing but
sit and wait, and observe what
happens in their homeland.

Rush To Be Shorter Next Year

by John Billmyre

Interfraternity Council
members learned Tuesday
evening that Rush will undergo
at least one major change next
year.

Fraternity members will not
be allowed to personally rush a
freshman before orientation.

The rule is the result of a Stu-
dent Affairs Committee recom-
mendation which was adopted
by the University Council Nov.
27.

SAC. made the _ proposal
because of complaints by facul-
ty members. The professors
feared that early contact and
other factors made fraternities
seem more important than
academics to freshmen.

The committee also con-
sidered the possibility of
holding Rush during the second
semester, but decided a delayed
formal Rush would not stop the
actual rushing process.

According to IFC President
Syd Farrar, many parents and
several students complained
about fraternity members
hounding them the moment
they set foot on campus.

The representatives’ reaction
to the change was mixed. Most
representatives did not com-
ment at all, but four of the reps
complained about the change
for several minutes.

Atwood
Elected To

Business
Association

The dean of Washington and
Lee University’s School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics,
Edward C. Atwood Jr., has been
elected to the executive com-
mittee of the Southern Business
Administration Association
(SBAA).

The organization is closely af-
filiated with the American
Assembly of Collegiate Schools
of Business, the agency that ac-
credited Washington and Lee’s
commerce program in 1927.
W&L is one of 200 colleges
whose program is accredited by
the national organization, of
some 1,000 business schools in
the nation. Atwood is a member
of the American Assembly’s
initial-accreditation commit-
tee.

He has been dean of the W&L
commerce school since 1969.
Prior to that, he was W&L’s
dean of students. Atwood is also
professor of economics. He
received his undergraduate,
master’s and Ph.D. degrees
from Princeton University.

   

‘“‘How can we get to know the

' freshmen very well if we are not

allowed to contact them im-
mediately?” said one represen-
tative. ‘‘The faculty tells us to
get to know these guys and then
tells us to stay away from them,
keeping us from really getting
to know them.”

But the overall sentiment was
against the change.

Fraternity members were
also pleased with one section of
a SAC report on fraternities
that said, ‘fraternities at W&L
will continue to be the primary
source of social contacts for the
students.”

Earlier in the meeting, Jay
Blumberg and Jay Hemby, co-
chairmen of the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon,
approached the IFC asking for
help with the event.

“‘As you know, there is a lot
the IFC can do for us,”
Blumberg said. He went on to
ask that fraternities not
schedule activities for the

Dance Marathon weekend, Jan.
25-26.

He also asked the IF€ to
donate kegs and encourage
pledges to participate in the
marathon dance.

The fraternity which raises
the most money will receive two
kegs of beer. The fraternity
with the best participation will

get its name ona plaque. The in-
‘dividual dancer who raises the

most money will win a trip to
Nassau.

The response to Blumberg’s
appeal was strongly in favor of
helping the Dance Marathon.

In other IFC business, Farrar
announced that Kappa Sigma
has been granted colony status
by its national fraternity,
located in Charlottesville.

The new members of Kappa
Sigma, which is trying to
restart at W&L, did not attend
the meeting Tuesday because
they were being initiated in
Charlottesville.

The IFC will meet again after
Christmas break on Jan. 14.

SBC Votes Out A+

The faculty of Sweet Briar
College has cracked down on
grade inflation. The A plus, or a
4.3 on a 4.0 scale, was voted out
of the grading system with little
discussion at a recent faculty
meeting.

Some faculty members felt
the A plus had been misused by
a few teachers who had given
the grade many times. Not sur-
prisingly, a dean of the college
was quoted as saying that a C is

a ‘‘perfectly respectable
grade.”

Noted Journalists To
Speak At Ethics Seminar

Clifford G. Christians, com-
munications professor at the
University of Illinois, will give a
lecture Thursday (Dec. 6) at
Washington and Lee University
as part of W&L’s annual pro-
gram in journalism ethics.

Christians will speak in the
Mary Moody Northen
Auditorium of W&L’s new
undergraduate library at 8 p.m.
on ‘Golden Means and
Penultimate Ends in Media
Ethics.” The public is invited to
attend.

Educated at Calvin College
and Calvin Theological
Seminary in Grand Rapids,
Mich., Christians developed an
early interest in journalism
ethics and philosophy. For
several years he was director of
communications for the educa-
tion division of the Christian
Reformed Church, with exten-
sive responsibility in magazine

editing, book publishing and
development of adult education
curricula. After going to the
University of Illinois in 1970, he
attained his Ph.D. degree—
again on the subject of the
social philosophy of com-
munications.

Christians is the author of
numerous monographs and ar-
ticles, and a book, ‘‘Respon-
sibility in Mass Communica-
tions,’ the third edition of
which is scheduled for publica-
tion next spring.

The Christians lecture will
begin the four-day weekend
conference for the visiting jour-
nalists, scheduled to continue
through Sunday, Dec. 9. In
Washington and Lee’s
academic setting, the visitors
will make use of the universi-
ty’s recently expanded library
resources and hold a number of
formal and informal workshops
with journalism students.

Review By Parker Potter

Ziegler Comedy In Theatre

Tom Ziegler’s new comedy
Weeds, playing through Satur-
day in the Troubadour Theatre,
is a fine way to spend an even-
ing. This opportunity to watch a
new play coming to terms with
itself shouldn’t be passed up.

Let me state at the outset that
the play and the production
don’t just have potential. They
are genuinely good. Certain tru-
ly inspired moments, though,
lead one to believe that Weeds
will be even better before all is
said and done.

Very briefly, the play is about
Clare (Pam Simpson) a widow
of 48 who is feeling her age. She
suspects the onset of “the
change”’ and longs for a grand-
child.

Living with Clare are
Henrietta and Harvey (Champe
Leary and Jay Blumburg) her
daughter and Leary and Jay
Blumburg) her daughter and
son-in-law. Harvey, a yet to be
discovered filmmaker, and
Henrietta are thirtyish veterans
of the sit-ins, lay-ins, and love-
ins of the late 60’s and early
70’s. They are hippies gone to
seed.

The play rolls through one
comic loop-d-loop after another
to show how Clare, thought to be
frigid and prudish, is not ex-
periencing menopause but
rather, pregnancy. And the plot
takes off from there.

As I said, Weeds is a good
play and this production,
directed by Ziegler and Lee
Kahn seems to do it justice.

Pam Simpson does quite well
as Clare. Particularly appeal-
ing is her ability to capture the
range of emotions of a woman
suddenly jolted from what she
sees as the end of womanhood
right back to the beginning.

And Simpson’s act III is just
marvelous. Her Clare is at the
center of all the action and
delightfully in control. Winsome

but not cloying, she can’t help
but be lovable here as she turns
her problem into probably the
best thing that ever happened to
her.

Champe Leary as Henrietta,
is blessed with excellent comic
timing. She knows how to
deliver a line without overplay-
ing it, and does particularly
well in the first two acts.
However, she loses some of her
range of expression in Act III,
when the strength of Simpson’s
performance makes Leary’s
whining just a bit monotonous
and annoying.

My largest complaint with the
play is Jay Blumburg’s Harvey.
Blumburg is full of energy, as
he must be, but even budding
young Canine
cinamatographers have a tone
of voice other than shrill. I
suspect that an infusion of
Zonker Harris cool might make
Harvey more able to connect
with his genuinely funny lines.

A real gem is Bill Rough’s
Leo. Leo is the father of Clare’s
child, a wheel chair bound
garden columnist who lives two
flights up. His voice and facial
expressions absolutely light up
the stage and his proposal scene
with Clare supurbly affecting.

The rest of the characters, in
particular Clare’s banker,
Howard (Chris Schram) and his
gay wrestler boyfriend (Mark
Suber) are played broadly and
quite fortuitously, not to the
detriment of the play. All these
agents of comic relief are suffi-
ciently far outside the main ac-
tion of the play that they do not
intrude on it.

Which brings us back to the
play itself. Weedsis not just a
promising play, it is a good
play. But it still has some grow-
ing todo.

Certain bits of it are pure
magic. Clare’s discription of
her husband and its wordplay is
amazingly witty and Leo’s pro-
posal is tender and touching.

All of Ziegler’s comic twists -
are original and well carried
out. Even more impressive than
the deft plot is the way in which
Ziegler plays with the audience
and shares things with it (Leo’s
plant stories) that not all the
characters are able to ap-
preciate.

For all the originality and wit,
though, mixed in with all the
marvelous lines (you either get
an abortion or get married, but
you did both!) there are some
gags that you can spot a mile
away.

There is a minor problem
with tone; comedy and life can
go together — as they do here —
but sometime Ziegler’s
preparation for their co-
existence here just ins’t enough.
On occasion the play almost
seems to want to make a social
statement on abortion, but then
backs off. Finally, we may not
be quite prepared for Clare’s
dramatic metamorphosis in Act
Il.

But the play and the produc-
tion both work. Ziegler is on the
right track, impressively so. So
is the cast. Weedshas some

What better gift than the gift
of music? If you’re stumped on
what to get your sister for
Christmas or you can’t face
picking out yet another tie for
dad, here are some suggestions.
The Record Store has
something to satisfy all tastes
and ages.

1) For your sometimes
girlfriend who can’t decide if
you’re really her type or not,
but doesn’t want to talk about it
in case she decides you are:
Fickle Heart, Sniff ‘n’ the

Tears; Head Games,
Foreigner; Blue Valentine,
Tom Waitts.

2) For your little sister who
has just taken her first dance
course at Myrtle’s Academy of
Dance and is pirouetting around

an imaginary Nureyev: Arabes-
que, John Klemmer; Morning
Dance, Spyrogyra; Feets Don’t
Fail Me Now, Merbie Mancok.

3) For your father who keeps
harping on the awful music kids
listen to these days and why
your grades keep dropping:
Best of Nat King Cole;
Schoolboy on Disgrace, Kinks;
Thick As A Brick, Jethro Tull.

4) For your mother who is
always complaining about the

cold and in whose eyes you can

do no wrong: Dirt Band, An
American Dream; To Drive the
Cold Winter Away — a fireside
presentation of music for mer-
rymaking down the ages.

Eye & Ear:From The Bookstore

Panic is rampant. Term papers overdue; com-
puter terminals unavailable; equations, both
mathematical and personal, unbalanced. And
ahead loom exams.

Beyond—on the far horizon—lies Christmas.
When to find time to shop? What to give to whom?
Where to buy the perfect present for the perfect
person? In the interests of student sanity I’ll take
on the unlikely role of Christmas angel.

Books are, of course, the delightful solution to
the Christmas-gift panic. They do not disappear in
quick gulps; they do not go out of style; they come
in all sizes and prices. They are not made of
plastic and their bearings do not wear out. Books
are gifts that last!

To turn Christmas chores into joys:

1) For younger brothers, sisters, nieces and
nephews: Jack Tales; The Chronicles of Narnia:
Reptiles Do The Strangest Things.

2) For the grandmother who always remembers
your birthday with generosity: The American Im-

age; The Last Enchantment; The Simon &
Schuster Crosswood Puzzle Book.

3) For the father who is always wondering what
the hell you are doing with all that money he has
sent you—show him with: White House Years;
Sylvia Porter’s New Money Book; Fix-It- Yourself
Manual.

4) For the mother who doesn’t ask the wrong
questions and who laughs at the right time; Habit
of Being: 60 Minute Gourmet Cookbook; Medusa
And The Snail.

5) For the one-and-only girl of the moment, A
Flight Of Butterflies; A Tolkien Bestiary; Les
Tres Riches Heures.

For the roommate who has everything: General
Lee’s College; The Joy Of Sex; Complete Sherlock
Holmes.

7) For the roommate who doesn’t have
anything: General Lee’s College; The Joy Of Sex;

Society Presents Kasper Houser

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film Society will pr-
sent its third feature of the season, Werner Her-
zog’s The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser, on Friday
and Saturday, December 7 and 8, at 8 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘C’’ of the Law School. The movie is
free and open to all members of the campus and
local communities,

Werner Herzog is one of the two most important
directors to emerge in the West German film
renaissance of the 70’s, perhaps the most vigorous
national cinema in Europe during that time, and
Kaspar Hauser is probably his best film. Herzog is
the director of the ski short we showed here last
winter, The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner,
and this movie, like that one, consists of
breathtakingly beautiful images.

The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser (1975) is a varia-
tion on the myth of the wild or feral child, the child
brought up in isolation from human society and
civilization. Perhaps the best known version of

this myth is the classical story of Romulus and
Remus, the legendary founders of Rome, who are
said to have been raised by a she-wolf. In the film,
Herzog’s treatment of the myth is preceded by
Truffaut’s remarkable meditation on the virtues
and limits of civilization. The Wild Child (1970).

Like Truffaut's film, Herzog’s Kaspar Hauser is
based on a true story. Herzog’s movie shows a
young man raised in almost total darkness and
isolation from human contact who in 1820, when he
is nearly twenty, is deposited at dawn in the
square of a small German town. (The fact that the
actor who plays the lead has had a life similar in
certain respects to Hauser’s gives his per-
formance added intensity. )

With great wit and charm, and not a few reser-
vations, Herzog documents the townpeople’s ef-
forts to introduce Kaspar to the virtues of civilized
life — walking upright, eating with utensils, talk-
ing, reading, writing, appreciating music, reason-
ing logically, and so forth. The movie constitutes a

Movie Review

APOCALYPSE NOWIn Technovision.

Directed by Francis Coppola.

Written by John Milius and Francis Coppola.
Narration by Michael Herr.

With Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Marlon Bran-
do, and Dennis Hopper.

It’s a spectacle. It has more powerful scenes,
more sustained tension, more awesome visions,
and just more amazing footage than any other re-
cent film. It’s visually overwhelming.

The plot is taken from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of
Darkness with Michel Herr (who wrote Dispatches)
overseeing the change of scene to Vietnam. At its
core, the plot is simple: a journey up river to an in-
tensely evil place, both the source of the river and
of the evil.

Colonel Kurtz (Brando) has broken off his ties
with the army and his unites are operating (with
great success) in Cambodia beyond army control.
The top brass realize he is insane (shades of Dr.
Tarr and Professor Fether!) and sends Captain
Willard (Sheen) to assassinate him, after a first
assassin has joined Kurtz’s forces.

Willard is given a Navy boat, and after Lt. Col-
onel Kilgore (Duval) secures its mouth, they move
right river after Kurtz. Through Kilgore is under
orders to aid Willard, he also wants to secure the
mouth of the river because the waves there are
great for surfing. Kilgore surfs during the battle,
after his air-cavalry charges to Wagner’s ‘‘Ride of
the Valkyries.”’

The journey up river is much like that in Hert-
Z0g’S Aggire the Wrath of God, where the crew
perishes one by one to an unseen foe. Along the
way they encounter a USO show in the middle of a
jungle, and a bridge built everyday only to be
destroyed every night by the Viet Cong. The in-
sane ineffectiveness of the American effort
becomes obvious.

The only one winning is Kurtz. He has abandon-
ed the army and set up base in Cambodia (neutral

Home For The Holidays:

Dash Reviews Coppola’s
Apocalypse Now

It’s an old story: the Mafia beat out the Cammora
for control of the NY mobs because while the Cam-
mora would slit the tongues of squealers before
killing them, the Mafia would castrate them
before killing them. The ruthless, calculated in-
vocation of horror. What makes Kurtz the very in-
carnation of evil is not his deadly efficiency, but
his amoral attitude and his purposelessness.

This is where the movie fails: how can one show
evilness that is so conceptual? What makes Kurtz
worse than the V.C. or the Americans is that they
were fighting for ideologies whereas Kurtz was
just fighting. The movie only hints at the dif-
ference.

The most successful image is when Kurtz talks
about how he came to be the way he is. He says
that one his first tour in Vietnam he was sent to in-
oculate the children of a village against polio.
When his company returned to the village later
they found that the V.C. had chopped off all the lit-
tle inoculated arms and had thrown them into a
huge pile both to show their hatred for the
Americans and to terrorize the villagers. Kurtz
then realizes that the soldier who would win was
the morally strong soldier who was nonetheless
barbarically ruthless. A vision not unlike
Cromwell’s, except Kurtz’s is amoral in outlook.

This movie is another failure to represent Viet-
nam. Coming Home, the Deer Hunter, and
Apocalypse Now have all missed the basic
message of the war that was captured so brilliant-
ly in Hearts and Minds: that we lost the war not
through a lack of military resolve (though that
was a factor) but because we failed to win over the
Vietnamese people.

Even with its faults the movie is brilliant spec-
tacle — awesome, flamboyant, and breathtaking.
If you can, you should see it on a wide screen with
Dolby Sound (i.e., not in Big Lex.).

(Movie Quiz: In Apocalypse Now what does

This week’s tragedy in Cinn-
cinati, Ohio, at theWho concert
brings to mind some other im-
portant disasters which were
associated with musical groups.
The most recent disaster,
however, has left 11 dead and
eight injured, but investigations
as to why such an occurance
was permitted to happen will
not explain the human motiva-
tion to trample another human
being.

As close as the wire services
will let me construct, this is
what happened. At a festival-
seating arrangement concert of
the Who, an extremely popular
English rock act, a crowd had
been gathered most of the after-
noon in order to have a chance
at a good seat.

Not long before the concert
was to begin, while the band
was making a sound check, a
door was inadvertantly opened
by an employee of the arena for
ventilation. The sound check by
the band was misconstrued by
the waiting crowds outside to be
the concert starting without
them, whereupon they rushed to
the entrance.

What becomes obvious is that
the people in front of the crowd
knew that the doors were not
really open, and those in the
rear thought they were.

The concert went on as plann-
ed because the Who were not
told of the problems at the door,
and when finally told right after
the show they were, as all
around them attested,
devastated.

Immediate repercussions of

city
manager of Cinncinati as to
why the concert was not
assigned-seat instead of festival
or ‘‘first come” seating.
Although no formal investiga-
tion will be completed in the
near future, I’m sure a major

finding will be that any pro- ©

moter given the opportunity to
stage a Who concert will want to
capitalize on the tremendous
draw power of a band of such
superstar status, and that, as
any promoter will attest, many
bodies can fit in a concert hall,
if there are no seats on the floor.

The trampling of 11 innocents
in Cinncinati is not at all a
remote occurance in the world
or rock.

It is regrettable, but at times
rock gets out of hand in a con-
cert environment, either by
deliberate provocation or acci-
dent, as the Who _ incident
seems to have been.

Anyone that has seen the
movie “‘Gimme Shelter’’ about
the Rolling Stones free concert
held at the Altamont Speedway
in California in 1969 will
remember the black youth be-
ing stabbed to death by a biker.
From the same film, there was
also a beating of a naked man
with puol cues by the same
bikers for another unknown
reason.

Another incident that makes
a case for the continued
violence associated with rock
‘n’ roll would be the Alice
Cooper concerts in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, during a_ three-night
engagement which saw the

largest-ever indoor audience.

Each night after the three
shows, mobs of youths roamed
the streets in gangs of hun-
dreds, looking for other gangs
with which to fight.

Police estimate that over a
thousand were injured as a
direct result of these provoked
gang wars, and-over 200 were
actually killed during street
brawls.

Aerosmith has been a victim
of violence, not only from fans
in an arena, but outside in daily

if not hostile audiences,
Aerosmith’s Joe Perry suffered
severe damage to his right hand
from an explosive device
thrown on stage, while lead

singer Steve Tyler received a
gash above his eye from a
similar explosive.
Firecrackers and _ other
pyrotechnics are an increasing
phenomena at concerts today,
and someone, either spectator
or performer is hurt by in-
discriminate ‘‘practical jok-
ing.”

Text Of EC
Security Report

This committee accepts the fact that there will be some damage
to the University physical plant in any given time period. However,
there is ample evidence of a growing lack of respect for all property
located on the campus. The Athletic Department reports that
vehicles have been driven onto the athletic fields. In other in-
cidents, spray paint has been used to write on the Colonnade, wind-
shields of student automobiles have been broken, and books have
disappeared from the new library and Lewis Hall.

There is some evidence pointing to students as the perpetrators
of these and other acts. The Student Control Committee and the Ex-
ecutive Committee adequately handle cases brought before them
involving Washington and Lee students who steal or damage pro-
perty on campus. Many cases of student misconduct go unreported.
The function of the Student Control Committee may not be well
known to the Student body. Also, many students who do know of the
Committee are apathetic toward reporting cases. The Student Con-
trol Committee has jurisdiction over Student misbehavior which is
not covered by the Honor Code. Students who know of vandalism or
other campus security problems should report the facts to Student
Control. The current chairman is Tim Brooks.

Several steps should be taken in order to make the function of the
Student Control Committee better known to students. The Commit-
tee will place notices around campus describing the types of of-
fenses it deals with, maintaining the confidentiality of the accused,
or those receiving penalties from the Student Control Committee.
The charter of the Student Control Committee shall be posted in the
EC bulletin board.

The Executive Committee can help publicize the role of the Stu-
dent Control Committee. It should request that all incidents of theft
or vandalism which may involve students be reported immediately
to Student Control.

Students involved in theft of property cai be deait with by the Ex-
ecutive Committee under the Honor Code. It bears repeating that
each student has a moral obligation to uphold the Honor System
against thieves.

2. The Law School

There are some problems which this committee has identified
which are peculiar to the Law School. These arise from its physical
isolation and the presence of female students. Otherwise, the pro-
blems of the Law School are treated in the general discussion
above.

Lewis Hall is isolated from the main part of the campus. The
bridge over Woods Creek has some lighting, but the fixtures are of
a variety which leaves the bulbs exposed to vandalism. The Ex-
ecutive Committee has been informed by President Huntley that
permanent light fixtures of a more secure type were ordered six
months ago.

The Law School has a substantial number of female students. The
women live in the Woods Creek apartments, Baker Dormitory and
in town. This committee received some complaints about the ade-

EC Discusses Campus Security

(continued from page 1)

Stealing in Student Center

Focus next turned to the
University Center and the pro-
blems of stealing and general
rowdiness. University Food
Service Director Gerald Darrell
said, ‘I’m very disturbed about
it. I’m thinking about keeping a
log of complaints.”’

“If you come in at lunch (in
the dining hall), set something
of value down, it will be gone by
the time you leave,” said Dar-
rell, ‘‘A vear or two age it got so
bad that we were going to set a
trap.” They were advised
against it, he added.

“I don’t know where the stuff
is going but it’s going,” he said.
“People, though, seem to be
wising up.”

Problems in the Cockpit

Concerning the Cockpit, Dar-
rell said, “If a student is drunk,
it seems like a license for him to
do anything. I had an incident

-earlier this year when people

almost got in a fight. I’m look-
ing for advice,’ Darrell said,
asking how to handle students
who get out of hand.

“I still think the best thing to
do is to take their name,”’ said
third-year Law Rep. John
Fraser. ‘‘Avoid physical force,”’
he added. ‘‘It may sound like a
limp-wristed approach — to
things,’’ but someone could get
hurt or bring a lawsuit.

“Some people have said to me
that under-aged juveniles are
being served beer in the
Cockpit,’’ said Poole. ‘‘I think it
definitely should be tightened
up,” he added.

“This is the first time
anybody has mentioned that to
me,” said Darrell. ‘I haven’t
heard of it.’’ He said he would
definitely takesome action.

and Vice President of the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

The move now puts a total of
four law school members on the
SCC. Each member is the presi-
dent of his respective class. The
change takes effect in January.

SBA President Bill Garrett
said the move would better
represent all the law classes.
He added that currently
undergraduate SCC members
represent 130 students while the
law school has a 160 to one ra-
tion. The change will give each
law student 110 ) students.

“T talked to Dean John about
it and we do have the authority
to change it,’’ said EC Presi-
dent Steve Abraham. “The
reasons are pretty good for a
change.”

The unanimous EC vote was
labeled “heartwarming” by
Garrett.

Cold Check

The Cold Check Committee
returned its last $100 loan to the
EC.

CCC Chairman James Vines
also reported that the commit-
tee’s short term bad check

_ figure of $49.69 was ‘‘the lowest

it has been as far as I can
remember. The new rules are a
success,’’ Vines added.

Discussion followed, resulting
in two defeated motions con-
cerning the CCC’s policy for
first bad-check offenders. A
proposal for a $2 uniform fine
with the option of paying Carole
Chappell was defeated and
resulted in Vines stating ‘‘we
are not just some discount
house.”’

The move, said Poole, was to
cut time from CCC meetings.
EC Secretary Cove Geary
disagreed, saying, ‘‘The fact
that they have to go before the
CCC should say something.”’

Calyx

Calyx Business Manager
John Hamilton reported’ that
they had spent $13,431.26 to date
and had collected $18,995.18.

Sitting fees collected totaled
$6,115, said Hamilton, a figure
$36 higher than last month.

Hamilton added that the patron
contributions total $3,000
“‘which helps.”’

said Hamilton, will be on Jan.
29.

Mock Convention

Mock Convention Secretary
Rick Corrigan reported that
things are going well and they
are “definitely working at it,”
to get speakers for January.

Poole asked if any speakers
were being booked who gave an
“overall view,’’ such as jour-
nalists. Corrigan replied that
they were focusing on political
speakers.

Ariel

Ariel editor Chris Faye said
no expenditures were incurred
for the month. He added that
the expected cost of this year’s
first 48-page publication would
be $1,5000.

The Ariel will be ready on
Dec. 14 with Faye adding that

4 the majority of the copies would
‘be held until after Christmas
vacation.

No Time for MD

A petition asking for five
minutes in Tuesday’s Honor
Code speech in Lee Chapel to
explain the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon
was voted down.

MD Rep. Palmore Clarke ex-
plained that the talk was only to ©
make people aware of the
marathon.

“This is W&L’s big charity. I
don’t think it’s too ridiculous to
give five minutes of our time,”
said Poole. Wenke agreed, say-
ing ‘it was a good time to hit
them.”

Abraham disagreed, saying
that the talk should be devoted
solely to the honor system
because of the seriousness of
the topic. Allen added he
“agreed with Steve 100 per-
cent.”

Members of the committee
studying extra-curricular ac-
tivity courses to be offered in
the spring term said they had
seven courses, two of which are
bartending and _ self-defense.
Subcommittee Rep. Sam Allen
added that they will be taking
suggestions for other activities.

“The present plan,’ said
Allen, ‘‘is to get people to do it
for free.”’

relationship between
academics and fraternity life.

The report, which was five
pages in length, was a draft of
recommended rules governing
fraternities to be amended or
added to existing rules by the
Faculty Executive Committee.
The SAC addressed the question
of whether fraternities con-
tribute to academic life by em-
phasizing that no generalization
could be made in this meeting.

The SAC report, which was
augmented by two tables com-
paring grade-point averages,
stated that some fraternities
promote academic achieve-
ment and others do not and con-
cluded by saying that academic
performance should remain
primarily the responsibility of
the individual.

Five suggestions that frater-
nities might follow are to imple-
ment “‘upperclass tutors, study
halls, a chapter library as a
resource and quiet area, quiet
hours, and assignment of rooms
by grade point average.’’ The
recommended rules are that all
pledges be required to have a
1.9 cumulative G.P.A. before in-
itiation; that each fraternity ap-
point a Scholarship Chairman
to perform specific duties and
“promote an environment in
which academic achievement is
respected within the chapter’’;
that the IFC publish in the Rush
Book. each year the fraternity
GPA’s in comparison with the
all-men’s average.

The question of continuing
fraternity rush in the fall was
discussed at length, and had
been included in the SAC report.
Feelings against fall Rush in-
cluded an opinion that so much
pressure is placed on freshmen
to join fraternities upon their
arrival at W&L that they
overemphasize the priority that
fraternities should take in their
first term of college.

A recommendation was sup-
ported that freshmen not be
rushed until after Orientation.

quacy of security in Baker. Two suggestions have been made for
remedying the problems in Baker. First, the women themselves
should keep all of the outside entrances to Baker locked after dark.
Second, the women should be assigned to the second floor of the
dormitory to deny access to their rooms through ground level win-
dows. Both of these are or will shortly be initiated.

Another problem that the University should deal with is the use eof
the student directory to harass feamle students. Law School women
have been subjected to harassing phone calls several times in re-
cent years. Some of the calls have been of a type that reveal the
caller’s source of the phone number. Some system that uses initials
for first and middle names for the law students in the student direc-
tory would probably cut down on this.

3. Juvenile Offenses on and off campus.

It is the opinion of this committee that Lexington is enduring an
outbreak of juvenile vandalism, theft, rudeness and violence. The
problem has spilled over onto the Washington and Lee campus.

Automobiles have been stolen from the campus parking lots.
Fraternities and dormatories have been pilfered. University pro-
perty has been damaged. Locked bicycles have been stolen.
Students have been assaulted on Main Street by juvenile gangs. Car
windows have been broken and tires slashed in almost every cam-
pus parking lot.

It is not enough to say that some vandalism is inevitable. This .

committee feels that the current level of theft, damage and assault
is not acceptable in a town as small as Lexington. The problems i in
the town spill over onto the campus because there is no clear
dividing line.

This committee suggests that any person not connected with the
Washington and Lee community and conducting themselves in a
suspicious manner be arrested for trespassing. We realize that a
minor may have to be warned before the police can take action. If
the standard law enforcement avenues will not deter unwanted
juveniles from entering the campus, the University may wish to
consider civil suits against their parents.

This committee also suggests that the Executive Committee
discuss the problem of juvenile gangs with University and city of-
ficials. Chief Kirby of the Lexington police department and Com-
monwealth’s attorney Beverly Read have stated that they are will-
ing to discuss the problem. The groups of juveniles who harass peo-
ple on the sidewalks are easily identified, and should be prosecuted.

The Ring-tum Phi’s Annual Exec

by Joe Scott

This year’s student body Executive Com-
mittee has been busy debating and in most
cases acting on issue of current interest to
Washington and Lee’s student body. The ap-
parent surge of vandalism and theft against
students throughout town resulted in a sub-
committee report advocating prosecution for
trespassers. A renewed effort to insure the
confidentiality of pass-fail procedures ended
in a recommendation to the faculty Commit-
tee on Courses and Degrees. Even the ques-
tion of coeducation is being studied by an EC
subcommittee. This is just part of a record to
be proud of.

In most cases, committee budgets were
slashed to the bone by an EC critically short
of student body funds. Many complained,
some with reason, but in the final tally, the
slimmer budgets showed signs of fairness. It
was an unfortunately year for the fencing
club.

Perhaps the real test of EC awareness will
come when revisions to the White Book
(honor code) are debated in the future. Many
feel the honor system needs major restructur-
ing and point to the increase in theft and the
senseless vandalism as just two examples.
Some feel it is irretrievable and un-
salvagable. Certainly their progess on this
matter will be watched closely.

 

Steve Abraham

EC President Steve Abraham is one of three
returning committee members. He knows by
experience EC procedures, obscure by impor-
tant details and runs the meetings fairly and
objectively. Rarely do meetings get out of
hand.

Some have complained that Abraham tries
to control everything. Though occasionally
correct, the point must be made that a weak
president would do an ineffective job.

His comments are researched, open and
consistent. His record shows he had done a
good job.

 

Les Cotter

Vice-president Les Cotter is well versed as
to the rules and procedures of the EC. When
debate bogs down, he usually cites a specific

 

rule and subsequent discussion seems more to
the point. His other comments, mostly conser-
vative, are well worth listening to.

Perhaps Cotter’s finest achievement is the
unenviable task of putting together the EC’s
budget. Juggling hundreds of figures takes
long hours of dedication. Unfortunately, few
persons realize the amount of work this en-
tails.

Though not one of the EC’s most outspoken
members, he obviously is doing a more than
adequate job.

 

Cove Geary

Geary is facing a formidable task in fulfill-
ing his duties as well as his predecessor, Tom
McCarthy. McCarthy did an outstanding job
and was probably one of the best secretaries
the EC has ever had.

Geary is prompt in typing and distributing
the EC minutes and takes long and adequate
notes.

His comments, though restricted by his
secretarial duties, are objective and in-
teresting. He usually agrees with the majori-
ty opinion.

 

John Fraser

Third year Law Representative John
Fraser is emerging as one of the leaders of
the EC. His frank, open and concerned at-
titudes are starting to cut through red tape.
He deals with the heart of an issue and does
not worry about knowing every single detail.

The students he represents sould be proud
of their official. He rallies for SAB films to be
shown in Lewis Hall and gives needed input of
law school opinions.

Volunteering for numerous committees
Shows that he is interested in the student
government process. He rarely fails to in-
cisively discuss the issue under consideration
and consistently maintains a ‘hands off
policy” when dealing with other student com-
mittees and organizations.

His carefully measured arguments should
carry more weight with the committee than
they have thus far. He is one to watch at
future EC meetings.

 

Sam Allen

First year Law Representative Sam Allen
is a recent addition to the committee and is
still familiarizing himself with EC procedure.
The few comments he makes show a sincere
interest in current policies and procedures.
He is now looking into a law school policy
which enables professors to personally
change grades through a fractional fluxua-
tion.

He presently sits on a subcommittee study-
ing the possibility of extracurricular ac-
tivities in the spring term and showed con-
cern for the ‘harsh wording” of the security
committee proposal. ‘

The old cliche of getting your feet wet ap-
plies here and can only be concluded by say-

 

ing that we will hear a lot more input from

Allen. He appears to be outspoken on many
issues.

 

  

wi lla
Jay Blumberg

Junior EC representative Jay Blumberg of-
fers a unique down-to-earth approach in EC
meetings—a welcome change in student
government. He constantly offers frank opi-

nions and advice, but more importantly, ques-
tions subcommittees when they give their

 

“

monthly reports.

His record speaks for itself: he currently
heads the Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon and heads the subcommittee con-
sidering coeducation. Determination is the
word that best describes him. He also has
deep concern for current Student problems
and is not afraid to fight tradition. It is un-
fortunate that he has served only one year on
the committee.

  

Dee Keesler

Frankly, we have not heard enough from
Dee Keesler, a returning member of the EC.
The senior representative has rallied for
squash club funding and a coffee lounge in the
library (personal interests), but is growing
progressively quieter. Keesler generally sup-

ports the majority but he fights strongly for
what he believes. His opinions aie well worth
listening to and lean toward the conservative
side.

He is aware of student opinion and is
knowledgable of EC procedures. Keesler’s
voice is sorely missed but will hopefully
return in the next semester.

 

Bob Willis

Junior representative Bob Willis is definite-
ly one of the powers sitting on the committee.

Bob Willis
Junior representative Bob Willis is definite-
ly one of the powers sitting on the committee.

He understands the issues, realizes the pro-
blems, if any, and always has something to
say.

Being a perfectionist in grammar and
sentence structure, though, sometimes works
in a negative fashion—it occasionally leads
the EC off the subject or hopelessly entangles
it on a minor point.

Willis also comments on most issues
brought up and usually brings out an in-
teresting twist on a topic. From time to time
his opinions solve debates by offering com-
promises which appeal to all the parites in-
volved.

His role appear to be that of a peace-maker,
the one who satisfies all sides. It is apparent,
though, that the decision reached is usually
the one he endorsed all along.

 

Bruce Poole

Junior representative Bruce Poole is
bright, eager and always ready to tackle a
new issue. His membership on various sub-
committees shows his enthusiasm to par-
ticipate and his comments are frequent as
well as spontaneous.

Always receptive to other points of view, he
argues effectively and sides mostly with the
majority. He is not afraid to question the
judgment of another EC member.

 

Jim Wenke

Sophomore representative Jim Wenke
seems to have a similar down-to-earth at-
titude, like Blumburg, and is quick to question
a point he does not understand. He speaks oc-
casionally and usually comments on the
broad overall picture. He thinks things out
and does not comment off the top of his head.

He views seem short, concise and to the
point. Wenke also appears to hate
bureaucratic red tape.

Nelson Ould

Interest and concern for current issues are
reflected in sophomore representative Nelson
Ould’s record this year. He always volunteers
for subcommittee posts and devotes a lot of
energy to his job.

Occasional overreaction to criticism makes
Ould seem defensive of his performance, but
his frequent comments are a welcome addi-
tion. He will probably return on next year’s
EC.

 
   

Bill Scheneker

The freshman representative seems in-
terested in the EC but has had little to say or
do, probably because he is the newest
member on the committee. His questions ap-
pear more for his personal enlightenment, but
his comments until now appear conservative.
It will be interesting to see how quickly he
opens up and gives his true opinions.

While anybody can assess a committee’s
successes and failures just by attending its
meetings and hearing each member’s views,
there is another side to the EC—the closed ex-
ecutive session for honor trials and private
conferences which the public does not see.
The time devoted to this hidden aspect is stag-
gering and probably takes a toll on many
members’ stamina.

We gratefully thank the EC for putting in so
much time and effort in working to make our
student government run smoothly.

 

EC Issues Pass-Fail

Recommendation

by Joe Scott

An Executive Committee
recommendation to make pass-
fail courses confidential be-
tween the student and the
registrar was unanimously
passed at the Nov. 26 EC
meeting.

The recommendation also
States that courses not offered
with a pass-fail grade should be
specified in the Washington and
Lee catalog.

This proposal was submitted
at the faculty EC’s meeting last
week, but must first go to the
Committee on Courses and
Degrees before it can be con-
sidered by the faculty EC.

“There is no legitimate pur-
pose in the teacher’s knowing
the student is taking (the
course) pass-fail,”” said EC
Third Year Law Rep. John
Fraser. “I think the pass-fail
option is a good one.”’

“T think the thing that worries
everybody is the influence of
the grade,”’ said EC Sophomore
Rep. Nelson Ould. He added
that the reason why he brought
up the motion was because a
student had complained to him.

The Student Activities Board
reported that it had collected
$282 in receipts from the Glen
Phillips band concert held in the
Cockpit but it had lost money on
its film showing of Soylent
Green.

“It probably wasn’t the most
popular film in the world,” said
SAB Co-chairman David Har-
pole. ‘‘People didn’t quite make
it over there.” (Lewis Hall)

When asked about Fancy
Dress progress, Harpole said
that the SAB had “started
ordering things and are getting

 

rough figures together.’’ Pro-

gress is going smoothly, he add-
ed.

The Ring-tum Phi reported ..
was running $800 over budget
and that the paper would print
27 issues this year.

“For Parent’s Weekend we
got $260 all together,” said R-t P
Business Manager Kevin
McGowan. “‘This puts us $1,200
over the subscription ceiling we
budgeted for,’’ he added.

Concerning the problem of
newspapers not being mailed on
time, McGowan replied that it
was the first time he had heard
about it. ‘They should have
been sent home.”

Changes in the Commerce
School exam distribution
system now require that
authorized persons will per-
sonally distribute the exams.
The Commerce School library
will also be off limits to those
taking tests.

EC President Steve Abraham
and Vice President Les Cotter
said they spoke with Commerce
Dean Edward C. Atwood and
worked out the agreement.

The procedure of alphabetical
distribution will remain the
same but students receiving
their exams will now have their
names checked. Names will
also be crossed-off once
students hand their tests in.

The University Infirmary’s
complaint box, reported
Abraham, has been installed
but as of yet no forms have been
made up. “‘It’s hard to tell what
it’s there for,” said Abraham,
who also volunteered to per-
sonally type up the question-
naires.

Discussion of the submitted
Security Committee report
from this meeting was held for
the Dec. 3 EC meeting.

From the Pressbox

A Final Look
At Football

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

 

 

With exams nearing and the Holiday season filling
the air, let’s take just a minute to look back on the 1979

W&L football season.

The football Generals once again improved on its.
record from the previous year. After a dismal 2-8
season in 1978, the 1979 team upped its record to 3-7
and there were signs of improvement.

With youngsters like Rich Hachenburg, Steve Cor-
beille, Chris Cavalline and kicker Bill Devine, the
Generals’ offense can hope for great improvements
on this year’s output. The Generals’ young and eager
defense also has to give coach Gary Fallon something
to smile about for next year. The play of
underclassmen like Mike Pressler, Phil Alletto, Gene
Newton, Dave Nichels, Tom Noble like Mike Pressler,
Phil Alletto, Gene Newton, Dave Nichels, Tom Noble
and John Winans was more than impressive and pro-
vides a solid foundation for next year’s squad.

As in the past, the Generals will not lose many
players through graduation. Only five seniors—
Stewart Atkinson, Syd Farrar, Mike Mrlik, Scott
Smith and Joe Wallace—will not return in 1980.
Although this small number should prove beneficial
to next year’s football team, it brings up a problem
that has played the football probram in the past. Out
of God knows how many freshmen players in 1976, on-
ly five stuck with the program the entire four years.
This is a problem that Coach Fallon has hopefully
solved—keeping students interested in the program.

As far as post-season honors go, the Generals plac-
ed three players on the 1979 all-ODAC team: tailback
Stew Atkinson (W&L’s all-time leading rusher and a
three-time all-conference selection), tackle Chip
Nunley (who did an outstanding job of leading the
way on many of Atkinson’s rushes), and senior offen-
sive guard Scott Smith (a repeat all-conference selec-
tion and W&L’s best offensive lineman).

So, with the fall season now complete, Fallon must
look ahead to next year—and what he sees has to im-
press him. He has a storng nucleus of young players
to build upon and enough experienced and talented
upperclassmen to produce a winning season. Of
course, he will need the leadership of tri-captains
Chris Leiser, Lee Minetree and John McKee to hold
the young team together.

With this enthusiastic nucleus coming back in 1980
and another year of experience under their belts, the
outlook for next year’s football team is optimistic.

Have fun during exams and enjoy the holidays!

Analysis:

 

Generals Show Trend As

Early Season Concludes

by Dale Park

“We played extremely well
together—there were many
positive things happening on the
court.” These are the thoughts
of Head Coach Verne Canfield
on the basketball Generals’
77-47 loss to Roanoke College
last Monday night.

The defeat was the second in
a row for W&L, following an
98-77 loss at Maryville last
Saturday.

As the early part of the season
comes to an end, several
themes in the Generals’ play
have become apparent.

W&L has played four good
games offensively, scoring 88,
91,77, and 67 points.

The offense has been an-
chored by its starting five, or
“blues” as Canfield refers to
them.

“The blues have done a good
job of holding the fort while our
bench matures,”’ said Canfield.

The key to the offensive
punch has been Junior guard
Carby Hoy. Hoy has averaged
22.3 points per game. The

Generals have received an of-
fensive bonus in the overall play
of Junior forward R.J. Scaggs.
Scaggs’ output of 9.5 points and
5 rebounds per game is signifi-
cant in that Scaggs has also
played tough defense against
opponents much bigger than
himself.

 

MAC N

Senior forward Tom Jeffries
has averaged 15.8 points per
game and has played solid
defense as well, his improved
jumping ability a testament to
the team’s off-season weight-
training program.

Senior guard Pete Farrell has
developed into a good floor
leader. The Generals’ captain
has chipped in an average of
15.0 points per game and leads
the team in assists.

Rob Smitherman, the ‘‘blues”’
final man, has averaged 6.5
points per game. The Junior
center is second on his team in
rebounds, averaging 9 per
game to Jeffries’ 11.

“The team is right where we
expected development-wise,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘As the season
develops our depth will im-
prove.”

Some signs of improvement
were evident in the Roanoke
game. Freshman forward
Brian Hansen entered the game
in only the first five minutes.
Hansen finished with four
points, but more importantly
played tenacious defense and
showed good court awareness.

Another force off the bench
was sophomore guard Clark
New. New socred eight points in
two spurts and gave the team
an offensive lift from the out-
side.

 

xe

The Generais’ R.J. Scaggs (left) goes up for a jump shot against Roanoke College. Later, junior guard

Carby Hoy (right) hits for two points in the losing effort.

“Now we're waiting for
Travis (Patterson, sophomore
forward) and George (Spears,
sophomore guard) to join New
as a unit to supplement the
starting five,’’ said Canfield.

The first four games of the
season have given the Generals
the opportunity to see where
their strengths and weakensses
are.

The season now moves to the
ODAC, and the Generals’
defense will need to tighten up.
W&L gave up an un-
characteristically high 75 and
76 points in its opening wins
over Southeastern and Bowie
State, as well as 89 and 77 points
in the ensuing losses.

The basic problem for the
Generals has been stopping the
big men inside. Bowie State’s
Charles Jackson scored 38
points almost entirely from
within ten feet, and three
Roanoke big men, all over 6’4’’,
scored a combined 49 points.

“By the time we play
Roanoke again the depth will be
there,” said Canfield. ‘The
team has lots of pride and we’ve
been guarding against any let-
downs by practicing on the day
of the game.”’

Far from the time to panic,
the Roanoke loss showed a W&L
team that was poised and
should keep on improving as the
season progresses.

In Overtime Thriller

“We shot horrendously, but
one our good sustained defense
pulled us through,” said W&L
basketball Coach Verne Can-
field. Canfield’s Generals over-
came a poor shooting night and
physical fatigue to defeat
Hampden-Sydney, 56-55 last
night in an overtime contest in
Warner Center.

The win was important as it
was the Generals’ first ODAC
conference game of the season
and raised the team’s overall
record to 3-2.

The ‘‘blues”, the Generals’
starting five, looked sluggish i;
the opening minutes of the
game, as W&L fell behind 10-5.
But the Generals got a short-
lived lift from their bench.

Sophomore guard-forward
Clark New and freshman center
Brian Hanson checked into the
game and each popped in a
quick basket. On the night,
xowever, the W&L bench con-
tributed only five points, a fact
which became more significant
as the starting five became
more fatigued.

Yet the Generals’ offense
ame back to life with almost
eight and a half minutes left in
the first half. ‘“‘When we play
well, five men are moving on
the court and we’re freeing Car-
by (Hoy) to shoot,” said Can-
field.

For almost thirteen straight
minutes of the first half, the
Generals did just that. Led by
Hoy, a junior guard, W&L
outscored the Tigers 21-6 to
open up a 27-16 lead with 3:30
left in the half.

The Generals played good
transition ball for the remainer
of the half. Combined with
tough defense and rebcunding,
the Generals took a 30-22
halftime lead.

Although the Generals had
the lead, missed opportunities
would later come back to haunt
them. W&L shot only 58% from
the free-throw line, a factor that
was especially evident as the
game went into overtime.

   

the second half belonged almost
exclusively to Sydney. Led by
Senior center Ed owens, Sydney
outscored the Generals 20-8 and
pulled into a 43-43 tie with seven
minutes left.

Each team committed a
series of turnovers, including
one stretch of four in a row.

Again, it was Hoy who kept
the Generals close. Hoy scored
six points in the closing seven
minutes, including an _ im-
pressive three point play at 5:50
that brought W&L into a 47-47
tie.

“Everyone contributed to

some extent,” said Canfield.
“Pete (Farrell) and R.J.
(Scaggs) were good floor
leaders for us.”’

Led by two timely baskets by
Farrell and one by Scaggs,
regulation play ended in a 53-53

W&L’s leading scorer, Carby Hoy, looks to pass off in overtime

deadlock.

For the third time in the
game, it was Carby Hoy who
rose to the occasion. Hoy scored
four key points in overtime and
finished the game with a total of
24.

Yet down the’ stretch, the
Generals missed two one-and-
one free throw opportunities
with only a minute and a half
left in the game. The victory
was nailed down until Tom Jef-
fries stole the ball with seconds

left.

This Saturday, the Generals
will take on Shenandoah Col-
lege. Canfield described
Shenandoah as ‘a team with
good individual talent, good
speed, and that plays a physical
game.”

Season’s Greetings

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t Sports Editor

“Tis is the season to be jolly.’’ But in the world of
sports, it is also the season to be humble. Here are
some thoughts I’ve collected during this period of
good tidings. So enjoy them and please pass the hum-
ble pie.

— Yes, Virginia, there is life after Woody Hayes. Earl
Bruce gets my vote for Coach of the Year for making
it possible to watch Ohio State without being bored to.
tears. In that same line of thinking, wasn’t it fun to
see Bo Schembechler fall flat on his fact three times
on national T.V. The Buckeyes, scoffed at by most of
the media folk in preseason reports, will go to
Pasedena. Meanwhile, the Wolverines get to play ina
second rate bowl. At least Bo can watch O.S.U. on
New Year’s Day.

—Speaking of Sports Illustrated, how in the name of
Adolph Rupp can they rank Kentucky 18th and
Brigham Young in the top ten? B.Y.U. plays in the
Western Athletic Conference, which is the same as
playing with a bunch of mountain goats. U.K. plays in
the S.E.C., probably the third toughest conference in
the nation.

—Looking at the bowl games, can you believe they’re
allowing Florida State on the same field with
Oklahoma. Somebody might get hurt — and it won’t
be the Sooners. But seriously, the game should be
close — until Billy Sims gets the ball. The Seminoles’
defense would stand a better chance wrestling an
Alligator.

—Also of collegiate interest, Bo Rein of N.C. State is
the latest man to try to turn around the fortunes of
L.S.U. Poor Charlie McClendon; his only fault was he
couldn’t be ‘“‘Bama.”’ Unfortunately, Rein will soon
find himself in the same boat — unless the Bear
decides to go into a hibernation from football. By the
way, I’ll give you a nickel for all the teams Alabama
played this year that are going to a bowl.

—In pro hoops, wha has happened to the once mighty
Washington Bullets? For one thing, they’re in the
same division as Larry Bird. If the Celtics make the

playoffs, Mr. Bird gets my vote for Rookie of the
Year. Sorry, Magic.

—Would somebody please send a Fleet’s Enema to
Mr. Thomas Henderson. c/o Dallas, Texas. Let me
tell you, the guy has diarrhea of the mouth. I can’t
help but laugh when Hollywood says he ‘“used’’ the
Cowboys. Henderson has lost the chance to make
megabucks for playing football. And besides, he’ll be
of no interest in a couple of years. If you still don’t
believe me, look at the awesome careers Jim Brown
and Joe Namath.

—In pro-hockey, where did the Islanders go? Maybe
they burned themselves out last year against the
Rangers. And how about those Flyers. By the way,
you get another nickel if you can name the last time
Marcel Dionne was shut out.

—When will Dick Miller or whoever is in charge of the
gym realize that we need more racquetball courts?
One solution is to convert one (maybe two) of the
handball courts. Let’s face it, people aren’t exactly
knocking down the walls to play handball.

—One last thought. By logic of association, the
basketball Generals have played two teams in the top
20 of Division I. Remember Bowie State? They played
Georgetown 19th in the AP Poll) and lost by 41.
Randolph-Macon, a team we play on February 14,
plays Virginia (No. 13 by the AP vote).

Grapplers Lose To VMI | Remillard Gets
In Season Opener 39-14

by Chris Sisto
Last Saturday, the varsity
wrestling squad opened its dual
meet season with losses to VMI
(39-14) and Carson Newman
(43-3).

Against VMI, the Generals
were stopped in the first four
matches until captain Ray
Gross won at the 142 weight
pound class. Other winners
against VMI _ included
sophomore Mike McFadden at
158 and junior Les Heart at 177.
The only winner against Carson
Newman was Gross who won on

points.

I gave them that changed the
whole tone,’’ said Dashiell.

The first story to come over

the wires — the one Dashiell
first called in — read:
About 300 people, most of them believed
to be Washington and Lee University
students, marched through Lexington
streets tonight in an anti-Iran
demonstration.

The demonstrators met on the W&L
campus, burned an Iranian flag and
several effigies of the Ayatollah Kho-
meini, the Moslem religious leader and
ruler of Iran. The demonstrators then
moved through the streets, chanting
anti-Iranian slogans

They gathered in front of the
Rockbridge County jail about 10:30
p.m., demanding the release of a
demonstrator who had been arrested.

This report came out at 10:49!
p.m.

Later, more reports were

called in to the wire service, but
not all by Dashiell. The later
story read:

Washington and Lee students have ex
pressed their disgust with the situation
in Iran, About 300 demonstrators turn
ed into a screaming, angry torch
bearing mob last night as they marched
through Lexington and onto — the
neighboring VMI campus. They burned
an Iranian flag and effigies of the
Ayatollah Khomeini. They waited and
chanted outside the Rockbridge County
jail until an arrested protester was
released. The protesters tried to take
over W&L’s radio station WLUR bul
were pacified after the news director
read them an Associated Press report

on their protest

A later report said, ‘Four sta-
tion staffers barricaded
themselves in the studio.”’

‘All they did was lock the
door,’’ said Dashiell. He said he
told the AP the same thing;
they chose to use the word “‘bar-
ricade.”’

This season the Generals are
under the direction of six year
Head Coach Gary Franke. He
has had a winning season in
each of his years at W&L. His
teams have also not lost an
ODAC dual meet and have cap-
tured the league crown the last
four years.

Returning from last year’s
team aside from Gross, Heart,
and McFadden are Elbert
Umila, sophomore at 118, and
senior Joe Wallace, who

wrestles in the unlimited weight
class. New freshmen on the

W&L Fencing Club in action against James Madison last Saturday. The W&L Generals defeated JM

Dan Weiss, who was at the
station at the time of the ‘‘take-
over,’’ said the crowd was
spirited, wanted recognition,
and wanted to hear ‘The Star-
Spangled Banner.”’ Both he and
Bill Parks, who was also at the
station at the time, said they
never felt they were in any
danger.

One reporter said the crowd
was yelling and screaming.
Another, from Roanoke, said he
thought the crowd behaved like
what he would call a mob. Ac-
cording to AP reports Wednes-
day afternoon, Dashiell called it
‘‘a group of concerned people”’
and officials at W&L and VMI
said the demonstration “made
a lot of noise but wasn’t a
serious happening.”’

Lexington Chief of Police
James A. Kirby said it could
have been serious if it had got-
ten out of hand, according to AP
reports.

Accounts of the same event
vary with each reporter. One
man’s screaming mob becomes
another's group of concerned
people

Witness acounts of the torch-
bearing mob cites the mob as
bearing three to ten torches.

Wire reports vary the number
of participants from several
hundred to a few hundred, from
200 to 300 to 400.

Whether the group was
screaming or shouting, spirited
or angry, a mob or a crowd may
not seem to make much dif-
ference, but when the terms are
put together, a _ shouting,

This Wednesday, the
Generals had a dual meet at
Longwood and this Saturday
host the Washington and Lee In-
vitational Tournament. There
are eight teams in the tourna-
ment, which last year was won
by James Madison University.
The Generals finished in third
place. Competition lasts all day,
with the finals beginning at
seven o'clock.

 

 

spirited crowd is not an angry,
screaming mob. But who is to
say which is more accurate?

Most students at W&L have
their own conceptions of what
occurred Tuesday night. Com-
ments about the crowd range
from calling it “students show-
ing loyalty” to “misdirected
Christmas carollers.”’

Nobody’s perceptions will
ever agree exactly. But by see-
ing how an event one is familiar
with is perceived by others, and
how that perception can
become the reality for those
who were not involved but who
must rely on other’s reports,
one can see the problems in
reporting events accurately and
the danger of relying on one
source of information.

 

 

 

Chairmanship

Page Remillard, Washington
and Lee University aquatics
director, has been appointed
Southeastern Area Chairman
for the U.S.A. Water Polo Cor-
poration (USAWPC), governing
body for amateur water polo
and organizer of the 1980 U.S.
Olympic squad. The appoint-
ment was made at the USAWPC
convention, held in Las Vegas
this past weekend.

“The appointment is ex-
tremely satisfying since a per-
sonal goal has been to help the
growth of water polo in the
eastern half of the country,”
Remillard stated. ‘This is an
indication that the USAWPC
recognized the sport’s growth in
the East.”

As Area Chairman for the 10-
state Southeastern region,
Remillard and a staff of four
are charged with selecting eight
play players and a pair of
coaches to attend the Junior Na-
tional Team Trials, scheduled
for June, 1980 in Colorado
Springs. Players selected will
come from high schools and col-

leges located in the region and
must have been born after
January 1, 1961.

“The USAWPC has designed
the Junior Nationals to be the
starting ground for future
Olympic teams,” Remillard ex-
plained. “If an athlete is in-
terested in Olympic competi-
tion, the trials are the place to
begin.

“We'll be canvassing the
Southeast for the top players
and swimmers,” Remillard
continued. ‘“‘Specifically, we’ll
be looking for excellent swim-
mers. Speed and condition are
key requirements, with cutoffs
at 23.5 for the 50 free and 52.5 for
the 100 free.’’

Remillard, 32, recently
returned from the NCAA Water
Polo Championships of Nov.
24-25. His 1979 W&L team com-
peted at the NCAA Eastern
Regionals in Chicago and finish-
ed the season with a 20-7 reocrd,
In addition to his W&L duties,
he serves on the NCAA Swimm-
ing Rules Committee.

a decline in the number of stu-
dent majors over the past few
years make it necessary for the
English Department to contract
rather than expand at this time.

Coulling believes the tenure
system is a ‘double-edged
sword,” adding that ‘‘it protects
and hurts”’ instructors. Coulling
maintains that the academic
freedom afforded by tenure is a
necessity, judging that there ‘‘is
no full and systematic alter-
native,” but recognizes that
there are ‘‘exceptionally able
people (presently teaching at
W&L) and we cannot per-
manently retain them; if I hada
future position open I would be
delighted to vote for tenure.”

Citing rapid expansion in the
1960’s, Coulling blames
graduate schools as_ the
“villains”’ for. turning out too
many Ph.D’s and creating a
glut of qualified instructors on

the teaching job market.

Ms. Kaston explains that
while her situation is “regret-
ful,’ she believes that the
Department has handled it in
the best way ‘by making us
aware of the situation from the
start.”” John Swift adds that
tenure is “more complicated
than it looks,’’ because the
faculty must continually
“balance a variety of in-
terests.”’

Swift believes that any pro-
blems associated with tenure
are aggravated by the fact that
‘humanities divisions are not
growing,” for which he says the
current teaching job market
and declining college job
markets are to blame. These
problems are “not unique to
Washington and Lee and will
not be alleviated for a good long
time,’”’ explains Swift, adding
that to the best of his knowledge
only one instructor has received
tenure in the English Depart-

ment at the University of
Virginia, where he taught for
three years as a graduate in-
structor, since 1975.

Associate Professor Robert
Fure is not as supportive in his
evaluation of the tenure system.

-Fure finds his experiences with

Problems With Tenure At Washington

tenure to be ‘‘frustrating to the
young professional’ and a
“threat to his career.” Fure ex-
plains that other universities
will be less inclined to hire him
knowing that they will have less
time to decide whether to award
him tenure. ‘I cannot stay here
because I must find another
position at a university where I
will have enough time to
demonstrate my competance as
a teacher and a scholar.”’

Fure is very familar with the
working of the tenure system,
having brought a suit against

Northern Michigan University
as an undergraduate student on
behalf of a professor who was
“capriciously denied tenure”’
by the University’s president.
With the aid of the American
Civil Liberties Union, Fure won
his case and the university
president resigned.

In contrast, Fure points out
that he has been “happy with

teaching climate has _ been
wonderful, but the tenure
system has interferred with our
relationship.’’ Fure adds that
teaching unions could provide
solutions to many of the pro-
blems posed by the tenure
system. Teaching unions, Fure
believes, would ‘‘offer all
teachers protection, assure de-
cent salaries and_ protect
younger faculty members,’’
adding that under the present
tenure system junior faculty
members have ‘‘nothing to pro-
tect their interests other than
the beneficence of the Ad-
ministration.”

While the three faculty
members concerned offer dif-:

ferent evaluations of the tenure.

system, they will all continue to

‘

seek a tenure appointments if

not at Washington and Lee, then
somewhere else. As Robert:
Fure puts it, ‘we can stay here
but it’s not in our best interest.” -

Discrimination
Charged At

Princeton

A number of Princeton University’s female
professors are charging discrimination in the
manner in which tenure is granted there.
Tenure virtually assures job security because
the procedure involved in firing a tenured
professor is complicated and rarely suc-
cessfully implemented.

Of Princeton’s 390 tenured professors, only
10, or 2.5 percent, are women. But Princeton
is not alone among prestigious private univer-
sities with few tenured women professors.
Twelve (three percent) of Harvard Universi-
ty’s 364-member tenured faculty are women.
At the University of Pennsylvania, 81 of the
school’s 965 tenured professors, or 8.5 per-
cent, are women, according to a report in the
Washington Post.

Comparatively, all-male Washington and
Lee University has granted tenure to two of
its five female professors. In all, 115 of the
155-member faculty at W&L have tenure.

Throughout the country, almost 70 percent
of all male professors have tenure, while less
than half of the female professors in the U.S.
have been given job security, according to a
1978-79 report by the American Association of
University Professors.

‘‘We suspect that women are being held to a
stricter performance level in the tenure pro-
cess,’’ says Dr. Lilli Hornig, director of the
Higher Education Resource Services at
Wellesley College in Massachusetts. ‘‘Their
right to be in the university at all is still being
challenged.”

“There is evidence that women who have a
research commitment to women’s studies are
taken very lightly in the tenure process,”
Hornig told the Post.

At Princeton, associate professor of
classics Janet Martin resigned her position as
chairman of the soman’s studies committee
“because it became clear to me _ that
Princeton had no commitment to women’s
studies or the tenuring of women except in
token numbers.”’

Martin and several of her colleagues have

compiled statistics that they say demonstrate
that Princeton discriminates against female
professors :

Faculty Dean Aaron Lemonick said that
Princeton is not sexist in its tenure decisions.
“To say that we discriminate is ridiculous,”
he said. ‘‘It is simply very difficult for anyone
to get tenure in a time when our
demographics show that the university will
not be expanding very much in the near
future. Women and minorities entered the
academic fields after the expansion period of
the 1960s,’’ Lemonick said.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Security, Again

Frankly, there isn’t much more that we can do.
We’ve reported on crimes against students, documen-
ting that vandalism and burglary in Lexington are in-
deed on the increase. We’ve published articles on
what you can do to protect your property. We’ve prod-
ded the student body Executive Committee to look in-
to the problems of providing security for Washington
and Lee students. But it hasn’t seemed to have done
much good.

The two main problems here are that W&L students
are vulnerable — we leave our valuable possessions
behind when we go home for vacation — and that pet-
ty crimes by youngsters in rural areas are increasing
all over the country.

Property theft in rural areas like Lexington have
gone up 916 percent in the last 20 years, according to
statistics compiled by the National Rural Crime
Prevention Center at Ohio State University. When the
Center studied youngsters in rural Ohio last year,
they were surprised to find that more than half the
teenagers admitted to committing some type of van-
dalism.

Until a better solution can be found, we can only
urge our our student readers to exercise common
sense precaution: hide or take home all valuables ;
lock everything; and note all serial numbers on
stereos, cameras, etc. left behind over vacation.

Fraternity houses are routinely ransacked during
the holidays. University dormitory rooms are also not
immune. Weare easy prey for would-be burglars.

On The Rally

At a time when the student body Executive Com-
mittee is working to get both the townspeople and the
faculty to take Washington and Lee’s students more
seriously, Tuesday night’s rally against Iran could
not have been more inopportune. Besides doing
nothing to solve American Foreign policy problems,
the rally and its subsequent march on the town only
demonstrated once again how immature many
students at this university really are.

Let’s face it. The rally was just a good chance to
‘get drunk and have a good time raising hell,’’ as one
participant so articulately put it.

The actions of the ralliers really deserve no further
space here except to say that Tuesday night was a
stupid and inane outburst of misdirected emotions
and energies.

Letters To The Editor
Disagreeing With Colvin’s SALT Stance

Dear Sir:

I regret that I was unable to
attend Dr. Colvin’s presentation
on the SALT II treaty. While I
do not agree with his position on
ratification and can comment
only on the points set forth in
the 15 November RTP, it is
gratifying to know that there is
interest in a treaty which will
shape the future relations bet-
ween the United States and the
Soviet Union regardless of the
final Senate action.

Dr. Colvin makes a good case,
but there are two points which I
take issue with. First, the
Backfire bomber. It would be a
mistake to ignore this weapon
system even though according
to Dr. Colvin it “has a range of
5,000 miles and therefore could
not strike the United States and
return to Russia.”

I question the 5,000 mile range
because it has been placed at
6,500 by several authorities. No
matter. It has an_ in-flight

Ambulance

Call
Unheeded

Dear Editor:

I would like to make you
aware of a discouraging inci-
dent I witnessed last Saturday
night.

Some friends of mine and I
were walking along Jefferson
Street with our dates when one
of the girls stepped off a curb
and apparently broke her ankle
or her leg. After we discovered
that she was in too much pain to
be moved, someone phoned in a
request for an ambulance.

During the substantial wait
which followed we did all we
could to comfort her, keeping
her warm, for she showed some
symptoms of being in shock,
and trying to calm her, for she
was writhing in pain. Another
call was placed for an am-
bulance and then another.

Only after the fourth phone
call and an estimated wait of

refueling capability and could
return to a Soviet base after
delivering nuclear weapons on
targets in the United States.

Further, in case of war, it is
not at all unreasonable to ex-
pect assignments of one way
missions by the Soviet military
leaders if the situation so
demanded. I have friends who
were naval aviators and would
have volunteered for such a
mission if the call had gone out.
It is most likely the Soviets have
aviators who would do the
same.

Second, U. S._ missile

the outcome of two confronta-
tions would have been quite dif-
ferent had the United States not
had strategic superiority. I cite
the Cuban missile crisis when
the Russina ships, enroute to
Cuba, reversed course on the
high seas when confronted by
the U.S. Navy.

The October 1973 crisis inci-
dent to the Yom Kippur War
was defused when President
Nixon ordered the world-wide
alert of U.S. armed forces when
the Russians gave indications of
deploying airborne troops to the
Middle East. While conven-
tional forces played a large role
in these crises, it was superior

Opinion :

The Rights Of Others

Boy, it’s good to see that Washington and Lee men have got what
it takes. We’ve shown that we can sink as low as any other students
in the country.

The holding of an anti-Iran ‘‘rally,” and the submerged concepts
that lie behind it, show how easily we forget the supposed dif-
ferences between the United States and nations like Iran.

The cries of ‘‘Kill Khomeini”’ and ‘‘Nuke Iran”’ should not be seen
as a positive reflection of unity among the student body. The
mindless call for military force is not an encouraging sign coming
from the students of one of the finer liberal arts institutions in the
country.

While it probably would make us all feel better to torch a few tur-
bans, there should be a recognition, by those of us lucky enough to
be exposed to higher education in an open society, of the differences
between responsible action and simply satisfying action.

An open society allows the voicing of all opinions. At the same
time, however, there must be a recognition and securing of the
right for each opinion to exist. When, in times of stress, the call
goes out for the suppression of these rights, it must be resisted even
at the cost of allowing one’s opponents a voice.

An anti-Iranian “rally’’ might well be in most Americans’ in-
terst, but it also serves a more insidious function—it is a sign to
Washington that even the allegedly most tolerant and educated seg-
ment of society supports repressive measures within its borders.
The selective enforcement of deportation laws against a specific
part of society is a dangerous precedent that supposedly was
regretted after the harsh treatment of Japanese-American citizens
during World War II. While Iranian students obviously are not U.S.
citizens, the principles against selective enforcement of laws still
holds true.

A better way to show our concern about the present situation
would be to show our support for United Nations action and the safe
return of the hostages. Until such time as the captives are secured,
or all diplomatic attempts are exhausted, in which case a virtual if
unannounced state of war would exist, the call for military action
should be resisted. In any case, the protection of the rights of those
within our borders should never be subjected to the currents of pas-
sion. :

 
 

 

Coeducation: Debate Before Vote |

Dear Editor:

This year’s agenda to sweep the coeducation
question back under the rug looks like that of
years past. A pop quiz or poll is taken, without
much announcement, asking whether or not
students would favor having women at W&L. As I
can remember, the results are usually pretty
much split down the middle with some years
favoring it and some not, but only by a small
margin.

What the usual process of evaluating student
opinion on coeducation lacks is having a more
open debate on campus of the issue before a poll is
taken instead of afterwards.

When the question of coeducation was mention-
ed in the last Phi, the E.C. said a poll would be
taken to determine whether a study is warranted.
It seems, however, that in the face of good ‘ole
Washington and Lee apathy, not only will the poll
be poorly attended, it will also reflect the general
ignorance of the students as to what the positive
effects of coeducation could be.

The result is the same old stalemate which in
my mind is another example of how this communi-
ty seems to skillfully ignore most questions of
social importance. I find this kind of removal not
only stifling but also detrimental to a person’s
growth. I do see this as a problem, but not
necessarily isolated to Washington and Lee.

The more I think about the ‘‘apathy”’ problem
the more it perplexes me. Anyone who has spent
time at this school is perfectly aware of how dif-

Mocking The Choice

ficult it is to spark interest in people for anything
besides partying.

I feel Washington and Lee is a most unique
school, though not because it is single sex, but that
it could be so much better. Someone said to me
‘Look, many people here have a simple mind and
they don’t want to be confused with anything out-
side of just functioning day-to-day. It would con-
fuse their lives.’’ I can’t believe that this has to be
the rule. Must people always simply accept the
situation they’re set into even though they can ef-
fect a change which would expand and improve
their lives?

This again brings me to the issue of coeducation,
a change which I think could do just that for this
school and the students and faculty here.

People say ‘‘but it would change this school so
much it wouldn’t be the same.”’ For reasons I will
not go into here, I feel that the change would not be
detrimental at all.

Instead, of destroying the unique character of
the school it would enhance it.

If it is so important that W&L preserve its role
as a single sex institution, or maintain its tradition
as such, I would like to hear some good arguments
that present this as being positive and healthy.

But I emphasize that this type of public debate
should reach a healthy level before the E.C. takes
a poll so that people might be aware of the possible
effects (and I grant that you can argue them good
or bad) that coeducation may have at W&L.

Thank you for reading this.

Letters To The Editor

Manipulation

Dear Editor,

I should like to address this to
any rational minds at W&L who
care to listen. A private White
House memo from President
Carter’s chief domestic ad-
visor, Stuart Eizenstat, recent-
ly leaked to the Washington
Post. This memo eloquently
reveals the true nature of that
government which we: created
to protect individual rights to
“life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness’? more clearly than
anything since Nixon recorded
his criminal plots.

“With strong steps we can
mobilize the nation around a
real crisis and with a clear
enemy-OPEC,”’ read the memo.
It went on to say, ‘‘We have a
better opportunity than ever
before to assert leadership over
an apparently insoluble pro-
blem, to shift the cause for in-
flation and energy problems to
OPEC to gain credibility with
American people,...to regain
political losses.’’ The purpose of
such actions? ‘‘To buy us a
week or so before the public will
expect more specifics.”’

 

“To shift the cause’? Wishful
thinking, but the true cause of
any state of affairs is an objec-
tive reality; one may shift it in
writing, but not in fact. And the
fact is that the mind-boggling
(and economy-wrecking)
system of state planning,
regulation, and manipulation is
simply breaking down. ‘‘To buy
us a week or so ?”’ It seems that
the individuals who constitute
‘the public’ are viewed by our
government as foes to be out-
witted, rather than masters to
be served. And the politicians,
helpless in the face of a self-
created crisis, are desperately
trying to protect themselves by
clouding the facts and real
issues in the minds of
Americans with a flurry of false
accusations, public displays of
“concern,” and, of course,
more massive government pro-
grams to prove that they are
“taking action.”’

But that is only the Ad-
ministration, some argue, there
is always Congress. Well, as
Eizenstat points out, ‘‘Congress
is growing more nervous by the
day over the energy problem.

government intervention into

Of Sen. Goldwater

For The Convention

Dear Editor:

Regarding the lead article to
the November 1979 Mock Con-
vention Report: In no way do I
intend to criticize the tri-
chairmen of the Mock Conven-
tion. I believe that their choice
of Sen. Barry Goldwater as
keynote speaker is excellent,
for the Senator is indeed
representative of the
Republican Party. That
Goldwater is patriarch of the
GOP reveals the depths to
which the party has sunk since
the resignation of its “fallen
hero’’, Dick Nixon.

Yes, Washington and Lee is
familiar territory to the Arizona
Senator. I hope W&L will be just
as familiar to Gov. Reagan
when he comes as the keynote
speaker to the 1996 Republican
Mock Convention. I also hope
that our student delegates cor-
rectly predict that the Governor
be selected as his party’s
nominee, No doubt, he will be
able to fill Goldwater’s shoes
and follow the same path to
defeat in November.

Isn’t it amazing how ‘“‘sym-
pathy for the Democratic party
and its fallen hero, John Ken-
nedy, as well as the challenge of
upsetting a powerful incumbent
in Lyndon Johnson”’ is to blame
for the Senator’s defeat. None
dare think that Goldwater’s ad-
vocating “basic and extremely
conservative — themes time
and time again’ led to his
political defeat.

How _ interesting that the
Senator predicted during the
1964 campaign the immorality

that would ‘run rampant in the
government”’ of Richard Nix-
on! How did Sen. Goldwater
ever guess that Nixon’s federal
government would meddle in
the “private affairs’ of the
Democratic party —
Watergate, and in those of
many anti-war activists? The
Senator even foretold Nixon’s
appeasement of the COM-
MUNISTS in Vietnam and the
failure of ‘peace with honor’.
What a brilliant man!

If only the Blacks in the
South, Indians on the reserva-
tions, and Hispanics in the
Southwest had realized to what
extent the Senator was
dedicated to ‘‘individual
freedoms”, the GOP might
have gone on to victory in 1964,
Alas! — his “honesty” and ‘‘un-
popular stands’ have allowed
him to become ‘‘patriarch of the
Republican party”, America’s
minority party. Is it any reason
why?

One can “‘sagely reflect’’ that
this “popular” politician of
THE elitist GOP mades a great
choice for keynote speaker to
join the ranks of those honored
men who have spoken here
before him. I can only add that
we liberal Democrats, although

we be very few, will not extend.

the rude welcome to Sen.
Goldwater that conservative
Republicans extended to our
keynote speaker, Sen. William
Proxmire, in 1976. Finally, may
all future Washington and Lee

Mock Conventions be
Republican! !

Mary Baldwin Responds

To the Editor:

The following letter is aimed specifically at the
author of the article entitled ‘Regardless of
Scorn: A Freshman’s Guide to Surrounding Girl's
Schools,” which appeared in the Ring-tum Phi on
October 18, 1979, and those who may share his
point of view.

We have read the unsigned comments about
Mary Baldwin College and the young women here,
We could respond with counter charges and name
calling ;-we could point out the inconsistencies and
contradictions in statement of fact; we could la-
ment the ignorance of the author of the article who
apparently does not know that the parietals at
Mary Baldwin are in accordance with state law:
or, we could object to being called “‘targets.”’ A
more appropriate response however, can be found
in the real issue which underlies the article. And
the issue is not Mary Baldwin College. The issue,
as we see it, is the author’s assumption that the

world is (or should be) created for his own per-
sonal convenience, additionally, the notion that
personal gratification is the sole object of his
social interests.

The author states that our security needs to be
“beefed up,’’ yet at the same time he finds many
security procedures to be too much trouble and un-
comfortable for him. How confusing! “Even the
landscape is deficient’’? We suspect it is when one
is traveling through it at 3:00 a.m. So, what we
have to say, we will ask Robert E. Lee to say in
this sentence from a letter to his wife dated Oc-
tober 1867, Lexington, Virginia. ‘‘We have nearly
400 students at W. College and they all seem to be
ardently pursuing their studies.’’ We might add,
‘Regardless of Scorn.”

Kim Sawyer

 

The issue of the draft is an issue of
rights. Philosophically, rights are condi-
tions of existence required by man’s
nature for his survival qua man. If man
is to live; then it is right that he must use
his mind, it is right that he must work to
produce his chosen values and dispose of
them as he sees fit in order to sustain his
life. A man and his life are identical, thus
man’s life is his by right-by his nature.
The single fundamental right, the right to
life, is the source of all others rights; and
their only implementation is the right to
one’s property, without which no rights
are possible. For man must sustain his
life by his effort; the man who has no
right to the product of his effort has no
means to sustain his life. Note that rights
pertain only to action, and only in-
divuduals act. Therefore rights pertain
only to individuals.

 

Kim Sawyer is a sophmore at
Washington and is a member of
Students for a Libertarian Society.

Should Selective Service Be

The Draft Is A Violation Of Human Rights

Others offer the ‘“‘public welfare’’ or
the “good of society” in support of the
draft (or some form of compulsory civil
service). There is no such entity as
“‘society,’’ since society is only a number
of individuals. Thus the ‘‘good of society”’
is simply the good of each individual. But
the good of an individual is a matter of

called ‘‘public welfare;’’ yet 4-10 billion
dollars is too much to spend on saving
American youths from the mangling,
brutalizing psychological — if not
physical — torture of war.

The practical question of the country’s
protection is not the real issue at hand.

 

As long as our government has the power to force
us to do anything except to refrain from violating

the rights of others, then the idea of a government

of the people is an empty myth.

 

 

Politically, a right is a moral premise
— a recognition of a fact of nature —
which defines and sanctions a man’s
freedom of action in a social context.
Rights, as such, impose no obligation on
others except not to violate those rights.
A crime is the violation of an individual’s
rights. Rights deal with action; human
action presupposes choice; and only
physical force and fraud are capable of
nullifying human choices. Therefore, to
violate a man’s rights is to use coersion
or fraud to compel him to act against his
judgement or to expropriate his proper-
ty. The only fundamental premise of a
moral political philosophy is that no man
or group of men may initiate such ag-
gression against the person or property
of another.

Individual rights supercede any
‘‘public’”’ or ‘‘social’’ concerns because
these rights are essential to the existence
of individual men, without whom neither
public nor society would exist. Since
rights pertain only to individuals, socie-
ty, a such, can have no rights; therefore,
the only moral justification for any law
or government is to protect individual
rights.

Our government, created solely to pro-
tect each individual’s right to live his life
as he so chooses, has today become the
biggest single violator of that right this
nation has ever known. The paradigm ex-
ample of this fact is the draft. Of all the
criminal acts perpetrated by our govern-
ments, the most evil is the draft. It
negates all of man’s rights at their very
source — his right to life — and eloquent-
ly illustrates the fundamental premise of
statism: that man’s life belongs to the
state and is simply leased out to him until
such time as. the state decides to con-
sume it. There is a name for ‘“‘an animal
which devours its own kind’’ — cannibal
(Webster’s).

A volunteer army is the only proper,
moral, and constitutional way to defend a
country. This is also most practical. No
one will fight better than those men and
women who have willfully ‘chosen
soldiering as their career. But some
argue, ‘‘what if we cannot find enough
volunteers?’’ If a government under-
takes to fight a war for other than self-
defense, then, true, it will not find many
volunteers — fortunately and rightfully
so. Moreover, there are not many men
(or women) who would not fight willingly
to protect their lives, property, and loved
ones from invaders. (Why, then, will they
not fight to protect the same from the
state?)

choice. Therefore no act which violates
individual rights can claim as a justifica-
tion “the good of society.” Another
variant of this argument is the use of
“national defense’’ to justify conscrip-
tion. True, the only justifiable use of
force is in self-defense (against the
criminal), but the idea of a government

When a principle such as that behind the
draft is accepted, even implicitly, it does
not take long to become explicit. The
government is always quick to find other
advantages in its logical implications.
For instance, during World War II, the
military draft was used as a justification
for proposals to establish compulsory

Americans. But the statists are struggl-
ing not to give up the power it gives them
in the form of an unnamed principle (and
precedent) — that man’s life is the pro-
perty of the government.

U.S. mobilization plans call for im-
mediate resumption of conscription upon
the outbreak of any hostilities involving
the U.S. — anywhere in the world. The
Selective Service Act of 1967 is still in ef-
fect and gives the president the power to
force young Americans away from their
lives and into the armed forces whenever
he so commands. The Selective Service
System stands ready with $8 billion and
plans designed to deliver up to 650,000
American lives to the war machine
within three months of the command.
Thus conscription is very much alive
within our present system, despite the
fact that the government failed in one at-
tempt to reinact the draft this past
September (only after massive
resistance and threats of organized civil
disobedience).

 

 

 

 

 

violating the lives and expropriating the
property of its citizens under the guise ot
protecting those citizens is such a brazen
contradition as to be hardly worth ra-
tional consideration.

Another proffered justification is not
even military, but financial in nature.
The volunteer army would be too costly

labor conscription for the entire’ U.S.
population. If men can be drafted to die,
it was argued, then why can’t they be
drafted to work?: Such totalitarian
powers aS mass slavery are the real
issue. To quote from Lieutenant General
Lewis B. Ramsey, director of the Selec-
tive Service System (June 24, 1966): “‘I
am not concerned with the uncertainty

 

The single principle of libertarianism is that no

man or group of men has the right to agress

against the person or property of another.

 

— $4-10 billion — it is argued. Therefore,
in order that the state gain money, we
are to pay with our lives, not just our ear-
nings. And, even accepting these figures,
compare 4-10 billion dollars to an annual
federal budget of (circa) $459.4 billion
(1978). Note, also, that the government
spends, by far, the largest portion of its
budget on programs directed at the so-

involved in keeping our citizenry believ-
ing that they owe something to their
country. There are too many, too many
people that think that individualism must
be completely recognized, even if group
rights (emphasis mine) go to the devil.”
The motivation behind all of this is glar-
ingly obvious. The draft is not needed for
the protection of the lives and property of

As long as our government has the
power to force us to do a anything except
to refrain from violating the rights of
others, then the idea of a government of
the people is an empty myth, and the
reality is that we are slaves of the state
(fully in principle and nearly so in fact).
We no longer own our lives, and our
“‘freedom”’ has become no more than a
mountain of political rhetoric. As
regards the draft, the issue at stake is
central — our very lives. If you hold
human life (your life) as a value, then
there can be only one moral response.
Abolish the Selective Service System; if
not, the price is high — your life.

Note: I would like to make the follow-
ing statement in order to dispel many
common misconceptions: Liber-
tarianism is a political movement which
has its philosophical roots in the men who
liberated this nation and framed the Con-
stitution. The single principle of this
movement is that no man or group of

Reinstated In The U.S. ?

Buddy Bowie

The United States Army currently
faces a crisis of such magnitude that its
future as an effective fighting force is in
grave doubt. That crisis is in manpower.
As serious and as pressing as the current
equipment and ammunition shortages
are, by almost universal consent the
single most serious threat to our national
security lies in the shortages and in-
creasingly low quality of our Army’s per-
sonnel.

 

Buddy Bowie is a senior at
Washington & Lee’s R.O.T.C.

program.

 

If current trends continue, the Army
will soon be able to field only a fraction of
the fighting forces deemed minimally ac-
ceptable. This is at a time when world
unrest places increasingly complex
demands on our defense establishment.
The root of these ills can be traced back
to one source — the abysmal failure of
the all volunteer army.

Since its inception in 1973, the all
volunteer army has proven increasingly
unable to meet either the quotas or stan-
dards required to adequately man our ar-
my. Recruiting for fiscal 1979 fell 15,000
men short of its goal, and recent in-
vestigations indicate that as many as
16,000 more recruits may have to be
released because of falsified records or
erroneous enlistments. Put into
managable figures, this is roughly one
and a half divisions out of a standing
force of only 13-14 divisions. An even
more dismal picture is projected by the
state of the Reserve forces, and this is
the area of of our greatest vulnerability.

In the event of war, the regular or stan-
ding army depends on the Reserve com-
ponents for most of its combat service
support and for individual replacement
of casualties. These Reserve components
are made up of both the authorized
reserve units and the IRR, or Individual
Ready Reserve.

Depending on whose figures one is will-
ing to accept, the estimates of the
Reserve’s strength shortage range from
72,000 to upwards of 300,000 men
understrength. Either figure makes our
Reserve forces woefully inadequate for
their task.

A report on the state of our army,
prepared for Sen. R. Beard (R-Tenn.) by
J.L. Reed in 1978, estimates that in event
of wartime mobilization, the army will
be deficient by at least 500,000 personnel
within the first 60 days of hostilities! This

sonnel have a high school diploma, and
the number of these who were passed
merely along for convenience sake is
unknown.

The army divides its personnel into
five categories of testable intelligence: I,
II, IITA, IIIB, and IV. The service does
not accept anyone in division IV and less
than one percent in division I. As of 1978,
the majority of recruits were in division
IIIB and that number is increasing year-

ly.

 

“What a society gets in its armed services is

exactly what it asks for, no more, no less. What

it asks for tends to be a reflection of what it is,’

Study Skills
Program Offered

As a service to Washington
and Lee students, the Universi-
ty has once again this year
engaged Baldridge Reading
and Study Skills, Inc. to offer on
campus a special program
designed to improve reading
and learning skills in academic
subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sustain con-
centration and to deepen
analysis.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
Jan. 14 through Feb. 8. Schedul-
ing will be flexible to ac-
commodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be
small to permit necessary stu-
dent attention. Each student
will attend a total of twenty ses-
sions, five per week. Tuition for
the program will be $65,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.

 

 

 

is close to two-thirds of our total standing
army.

The Beard report goes on to state: ‘‘All
of the deficiencies listed above are a
direct consequence of stopping the draft
and moving to the use of volunteer
labor.”’ All analysts agree that the next
war, due to its ferocity and rapid expen-
diture of highly sophisticated weaponry,
will necessarily be a short one. Obvious-
ly, the outset of hostilities is not the time
to go looking for men — by then it might
be too late.

Unfortunately, the manpower shortage
is not the end of the problem. The quality
of the average recuit is dropping yearly.
Currently, only 56 percent of enlisted per-

The Army Needs The Draft To Fight Effectively

Hispanics.

A draft would immediately alleviate
these problems by drawing from the
broad base of.the American public and
providing personnel of a diverse and
rounded nature that our army so
desperately needs.

My purpose in this article has not been
to elucidate the many Selective Service
schemes put forward by various
legislators — most of which have great
merit; rather, it has been to demonstrate
the desperate condition of our army and
the pressing need for some form of draft,
immediately.

General Sir John Hackett once wrote,
“What a society gets in its armed ser-
vices is exactly what it asks for, no more
no less. What it asks for tends to be a
reflection of what it is. When a country
looks at its fighting forces, it is looking in
a mirror; if the mirror is 4 true one, the
face that it sees will be its own.”’

The all volunteer army, noble as the
experiment was, has proven a failure. It
has had six years to redeem itself, yet
has only grown steadily worse. We can no
longer afford to gamble with our national
security and a return to some form of the
draft, regretable though it may be, is the
only realistic answer.

It is time we set about making the mir-
ror of our armed forces a ‘“‘true’’ reflec-
tion of American society and spirit. In
the words of George Washington: ‘‘It
may be laid down as a primary position,
and the basis of our system, that every
citizen who enjoys the protection of a free
government, owes not only a proportion
of his property, but even of his personal
services to the defense of it.

‘Sore At City Services

30-40 minutes did the am-

formed that Lexington has only
two volunteer rescue squad
workers on duty, though they
did not state whether that is the
case all the time or only on
Saturday nights.

The thing that makes this
such a sore spot with me is that
I also witnessed the arrest in
September of several students
for playing football on Lee
Avenue. The time spent on this
matter by the police officer in-

minutes.

Another crime I know about,
which occurred during
Thanksgiving vacation, was the

ried the day for us.

I oppose the ratification of the
SALT II treaty for reasons that
have been set forth often in the
media. They are quite involved
and only a listing of a few is
possible in this letter. They in-
clude (1) SALT II locks the
United States into a position of
strategic inferiority, (2) SALT
II makes our people hostages,
(3) SALT II is unverifiable, (4)
SALT II removes the nuclear
shield which used to protect our
allies. There is ample evidence
to support the above points and
others. However, even more
basic, I oppose ratification
because of the lack of trust in
theability of this administration
to negotiate an agreement with
the Soviet Union that enhances
the security of the United
States.

Make no mistake about the
significance of the SALT II trea-
ty. It may be one of the most
pivotal transactions in our na-
tion’s history. For that reason,
it seems important enough to
warrant a full discussion so that
those who will share in the
future of the United States may
hear both sides in the ongoing
debate.

What Really Happened
To The W&L 10?

by Randy Smith

Saturday, Dec. 8

Four members of Washington
and Lee’s varsity basketball
team are suspended by Coach
Verne Canfield for their role in
the damage to 37 of the school’s
English boxwood bushes.

Team captain Pete Farrell
and the Generals’ leading
scorer, Carby Hoy, are
suspended for ‘‘disciplinary
reasons” along with teammates
Rob McDevitt and Chris

Schrauth. The four sat in the
crowd for the game that night
graduated from the University
in 1962.

state-wide publicity.

That night, the Student Con-
trol Committee, an all-student
disciplinary body which has the
power to impose penalties and
can recommend expulsion,
meets for what will be a six-
hour session to hear the case of
the 10 W&L students involved in
the boxwood damage.

Also involved, they admit to
the committee, are Brad Lewis,
the basketball team’s manager,
Brian Murphy, a junior varsity
basketball player, Chris Cahill,
a member of the lacrosse team,
Ken Manganiello, a football
player, Tracy Hodge, an assis-
tant to the j.v. basketball team,
and Dave Leunig, an assistant
to the varsity team.

students were also involved in
the damage but were beyond
SCC’s jurisdiction. )

Basketball Season In Doubt

This Week

Players Fail In

Reinstatement Bid

University President Robert
E.R. Huntley has formally and
officially ruled out all
possibilities that any of the
students involved in damage to
37 of Washington and Lee’s
English boxwoods will be allow-
ed to participate on W&L
athletic teams this year.

(The University Athletic
Committee, in a meeting before
Christmas break, recommend-
ed to the president that all 10
W&L students involved in the
damage to the boxwoods not be
permitted to represent the
university in intercollegiate
athletic contests for one year.
President Huntley adopted the
committee’s recommenda-
tions. y

Varsity basketball team cap-
tain Pete Farrell and teammate
Carby Hoy went before the
Athletic Committee Tuesday
reportedly to see if they could
be reinstated on the team.

The committee reaffirmed its
earlier decision of suspension
Tuesday, a ruling that applies
regardless of the exact extent of
any individual student’s in-
volvement in the incident.

President Huntley backed the
Athletic Committee’s latest
decision on the case: “I agree
also that the athletic suspension
for the remainder of this
academic year should not be
lifted as to any student who was

involved in the incident.”’

The committee apparently
left the door open for an appeal
of the suspensions later this
year, possibly in April.

The meeting Tuesday be-
tween Farrell and Hoy and the
Athletic Committee is the latest
in a series of actions taken by
several of the students and their
families in an attempt to appeal
the suspensions and get the
students back on the team.

’ A number of parents had con-
versations with administration
officials over the vacation.

The original punishments
handed out by the Student Con-
trol Committee Dec. 10 found all
10 W&L students involved in the
incident to be equally guilty in
damaging the boxwoods. The
SCC is the only committee to
have reviewed all the facts and
evidence in the case.

The University Athletic Com-
mittee “uncritically’’ accepted
the SCC’s findings and recom-
mended adding thé one-year
suspensions to the list of
punishments for the students in-

volved.

One of the students involved
in the incident, Chris Cahill, has
taken a leave of absence from
the university.

Several of the other students
are said to be considering tak-
ing a leave of absence or
transferring to another school.

 

 

The Team’s Future

by Bill Whalen

The bulletin board outside of
W&L Basketball Coach Verne
Canfield’s office seems to best
reflect what has happened to his
squad in the past month. Gone
are the individual pictures of
his players and the plans for the
team’s ill-fated trip to Europe.
Tacked up in their place is a
simple piece of paper bearing a
message:

Life is 100 percent what
happens to you and 90 percent
how you react to what happens to
you. Positive thinking people
never quit or compromise. They
simply adjust and find a way.

This philosophy, undoubtedly
posted and probably written by

Canfield himself, is the
guideline for the rest of the
Generals’ season. With the loss
of four players, including both

face the hardest part of its

a makeshift team.

The four players who are off
the team, Captain Pete Farrell,
Carby Hoy, Chris Schrauth, and
Rob McDevitt, have left a huge
void in the squad’s backcourt
depth, as all of the players in-
volved were guards. Moreover,

Concert Pianist To Perform Tuesday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Concert Guild will present
its third program of the season
next Tuesday (Jan. 15) at8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel, with a_per-
formance by contemporary
pianist Joshua Pierce.

His W&L performance will in-
clude a _ broad variety of
musical styles and figures —
from Mozart and Beethoven
through Chopin and Liszt, ¢on-
cluding with pieces by Gott-
schalk and Persichetti.

A graduate of the Manhattan
School of Music, Pierce has per-
formed new compositions by

Josef Alexander, Giampaolo
Bracali, Doris Hays, and W&L
music professor Robert
Stewart.

Also a student of the well-
known music director Dorothy
Taubman, Pierce has assisted

her for the past three summers
as artist-in residence and facul-
ty member at the Taubman
School in Amherst, Mass. and
Rensselaerville, N.Y.

The artist’s touring career
dates from 1976, when he com-
pleted a highly successful visit
to southern Spain in solo and
chamber music recitals with
the American Festival Or-
chestra, part of cultural
festivities honoring America’s
bicentennial celebrations. Most
recently, Pierce performed in a
concert for Mrs. Joan Mondale,
wife of the Vice President and a
contemporary music enthusiast
in her own right.

A recording by Pierce of John
Cage’s ‘‘Sonatas and Interludes
for Prepared Piano’ was
nominated for a Grammy
Award in 1977 as best classical-

contemporary album. This
record, as well as a second,
received the highest rating
from the prestigious Downbeat
Magazine. Still to be released
on Serenus Records are works
by Josef Alexander in col-
laboration with soprano
Rosalyn Reese and the Paul
Price Percussion Ensemble.

Though the concert is free for
members of the W&L communi-
ty, admission is $3 for the
general public. Tickets will be
available at Lee Chapel on the
evening of the performance.

As the Concert Guild’s first
winter-term performer, Pierce
is the initial attraction in a busy
season. He will be followed by
two popular groups — the
Clarion Wind Quintet on Feb. 10
and the Annapolis Brass
Quintet on March 5.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Boxwood Incident

There can be no doubt that the so-called boxwood in-
cident was a disgrace and embarrassment to the var-
sity basketball team, to Washington and Lee’s
athletic program, and to the university as a whole.
The destructive acts of 10 W&L students and their
four Longwood College companions can never be con-
doned or justified.

We will not, however, cast judgment on the in-
dividuals involved. It seems unreasonable to us to
castigate and recommend punishment when all of the
facts about the incident are not available for our ex-
amination. (How, then, can we make an informed
judgment? )

We find it astonishing that so many members of the
W&L community jumped to impulsive, emotional and
uninformed judgments. As soon as the Student Con-
trol Committee’s punishments of the 10 students in-
volved became known, there was an outpouring of
grumbling throughout the campus that the penalties
weren't “‘harsh enough” and amounted to merely ‘‘a
Slap on the wrist.’’ All of this second-guessing was
done by those who had not attended the marathon six-
hour SCC session and, therefore, did not have access
to the evidence and circumstances upon which Stu-
dent Control had based its decision. And the SCC judg-
ment was reportedly a unanimous one.

Again, we cannot and will not condone the destruc-
tive acts of these 14 individuals. But it is also wrong
for those without access to all the facts to cast judg-
ment and recommend alternate penalties.

What we really lack is information. Although we
have done our best to fill in the gaps about what hap-
pened during a series of closed meetings on the box-
wood incident, our information is still sketchy and in-
complete. Rumors provided the only information
many people had—and the rumors proved to be
predictably unreliable.

One possible solution is to allow press access to im-
portant disciplinary hearings in which the university
community clearly has an interest—the boxwood inci-
dent would fall into such a category. This incident
demonstrates the dangers inherent when a society
lacks the vital information it needs to formulate in-
formed judgments. We recommend that in the future
a member of the campus press be granted access to
what have traditionally been closed hearings so that
the information needed by the community can be
disseminated.

We were shocked by the reactions of some, by the
bitter contempt several members of the W&L
community—faculty and students alike—expressed
toward the 10 students involved and toward Student
Control and what was preceived to be a lenient form
of punishment. Some of this hostile reaction might
possibly have been alleviated somewhat if the facts
had been available for the community to inspect. We
all have a right to know in what manner and why a
certain disciplinary action was taken in an incident
which has such a profound affect upon our entire com-
munity. *

The Ring-tum Phi views its role as a responsibility
to convey as much information as possible to the W&L
community about matters which directly affect it. We
will continue to disseminate information, when possi-
ble, and serve as a forum for the responsible views of
members of the W&L community.

Again, we feel duty-bound to warn against hastily
conceived judgments based only upon incomplete in-

formation.

 

 

Generals

Need Us

Dear Students,

As we all return to Lexington
to begin a new term and a new
decade, I would like to wish
everyone a happy New Year
and hopes that the holidays
were joyous for all.

I am sure that you are all
aware of the unforeseen prob-
lems and pressures which have
befallen the Basketball
Generals.

The team entered this season
with high hopes for an ODAC
Championship. Three of the five
original starting players re-
main on the team, and a strong
bench is now filling the
vacanies created by the un-
fortunate incident involving the
boxwoods.

However, no matter how
much talent this team
possesses, it cannot regain its
confidence and pride without
support. The Generals need us,
the STUDENT BODY, to show
them that we care and that w
are behind them.

Defense Reporter

To Speak On Monday

Charles Corddry, defense and
foreign policy reporter for the
Baltimore Sun and panelist on
the television series
‘‘Washington Week in Review,”
will speak at Washington and
Lee University next Monday
(Jan. 14) as part of a week-long
visit to the campus sponsored
by the Woodrow Wilson Visiting
Fellowship.

Team’s Future In Doubt

(continued from page 1)
leading scorers, respectively.

Before and after the boxwood
incident, W&L has played like
two entirely different teams.
Before the loss of the four
players, the Generals had a
record of three wins and two
losses and were outscoring their
opponents by an average of
eight points in each of their vic-
tories. In the last three games,
however, the Generals are 1-2,
including two losses at the Sun-
coast Classic in St. Petersburg,
Florida.

But the worse seems yet to
come. In a nine-day period, the
Generals will play five games.
The first two gdmes are at

home in the Washington and ~
Lee Tournament this weekend. ~

Then come the three most im-
portant games of the year.

The first of these three en-
counters is a rematch with
Hampden-Sydney on the Tigers’
home court. Two days later, the
Generals must play Eastern
Mennonite, a vastly improved
team, in another away game.

Finally, W&L will be at home
to take on the Lynchburg
Hornets, who at this moment
seem to be the best team in the
ODAC. It will be in these three
games that much of the pair-
ings for the ODAC Tournament
will be decided.

Replacing Farrell and Hoy in
the backcourt are a pair of
sophomores, George Spears
and Clark New. Both Spears
and New saw limited playing
time last year but have been im-
proving with each game. New
has already hit for 21 points in
one game and Spears has had
two 16-point efforts as a starter.

Where the Generals have
been hurt the most is on their
bench. With the movement of
New and Spears to the starting

five, W&L is left with only two
experienced players coming off
the bench—Brian Hanson and
Travis Patterson. However,
Hanson is a center and Patter-
son is a strong forward.

To at least have enough
guards to hold an inter-squad

' practice, Canfield called up Ken

Jaffe and Mark Shaver from the
junior varsity team. Neither
player had seen a minute of ac-
tion with the varsity before this
year.

As an indication of how bad

- things have gone for the

Generals, the team cannot hold
a decent practice when the j.v.
has a game. Of the thirteen
players now on Canfield’s team,
six also suit up for j.v. games.
This leaves only seven players
for Canfield to work with. And
of these seven, Smitherman,
Scaggs and Patterson have
each been hobbled with in-
juries.

Thus, it is apparent that the
outlook for the rest of the
basketball season is anything
but optimistic. All the Generals
can hope for is to find a consis-
tent offense and defense in the
remaining six weeks until the
conference tournament.

And the tournament may be a
blessing in disguise. As is the
case in the ACC and the SEC,
the ODAC uses its season-end
tournament to determine which
team will get an NCAA bid. If
the Generals do not fare too well
in the regular season, they
might possibly be playing their
best basketball by the time of
the tournament. If they are
peaking and if they get a good
seeding, then the Generals
might very well walk away with
a championship.

But until the tournament rolls
around, all the basketball team
can do is wait. Wait and hope.

Scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the
Northern Auditorium of W&L’s
undergraduate library, Cord-
dry’s lecture is entitled ‘Iran,

Afganistan, Pakistan: There
Goes the Whole’ Neigh-
borhood?”’

The confused state of Mideast
news events is a natural subject
for Corddry, who has nearly 40
years of reporting experience to
his credit. He joined the Sun’s
Washington Bureau in 1967,
after 25 years on the reporting
staff of United Press Interna-
tional. And he has appeared on
‘Washington Week in Review’’.
since that series began more
than 12 years ago.

Corddry specializes’ in
military and foreign affairs and
has reported on NATO for most
of its 30-year history. Other
assignments have taken him
from Berlin, including a visit
when ‘‘the wall”’ was erected, in
1961 to Cape Canaveral for the
early missile and space ac-
tivities.

He was sent to Korea upon the
outbreak of war there in 1950
and returned in 1977 to cover
U.S.-South Korean defense
negotiations during a reporting
trip through the Pacific. He
covered Senate debates over
SALT I and II in 1972 and 1979
and American responses to the
1973 Middle East war.

While at W&L, Corddry will
address selected classes in
history, journalism, politics and
military science. Informal
meetings with professors and
students will continue through
the week.

they were doing something

Members of the group told the
committee that they did not

four players prior to the
Shenandoah game.

In his testimony before the
SCC, Canfield emphasized that

according to Parsons, were
already numbered and catalog-

tatives.

their mistakes and asked that
the SCC not recommend expul-
sion for this ‘‘one mistake.”’ He
offered an alternative: a work
program of some kind; he even
offered to supervise the work.

“No one on the: committee
really wanted to kick them out
and nothing would have been
solved by it,” a participant in
the meeting, who asked not to
be named, told the Ring-tum
Phi.

The SCC places all 10 students
on social probation for the re-
mainder of the school year
(which forbids them to partake
in any fraternity function or to
use some of the university’s
recreational facilities), conduct
probation (a ‘‘severe warning’’
for misconduct) for the re-
mainder of their enrollment at
W&L, and that each must work
eight hours a week in the com-
munity for the remainder of the
school year under the supervi-
sion of the SCC.

The committee also recom-
mends that all ten make ar-
rangements with the university
to pay for the damages. (The
SCC does not have the power to
interfere with athletics. )

After the meeting, Tim
Brooks, chairman of the SCC,
told the Ring-tum Phi his com-
mittee ‘feels that this punish-
ment is one which is not merely
punitive but constructive. After

mittee decided that of those

Parsons. The six heirs to the
‘‘Weeks Estate”’ disagreed.

The question of ownership
eventually went to court. At one
time the litagation went to a

but was returned to the Virginia

case, Washington and Lee being

the defendant, settled the case,

not preclude any legal action by
the university nor any indepen-

by the athletic department.”

Student Body President Steve
Abraham said that, ‘‘the’
students shouldn’t be so quick to
prejudge the punishment in this
case without knowing the
facts.”

However, the facts of the case
are known only to those few who
had attended the SCC meeting.

The vote for suspension is
unanimous and the committee’s
concensus is that the 10 students
involved in the bush destruction
were not given sufficient
punishment by Student Control.

direct powers. )

The committee did not have
the opportunity to examine any
of the evidence considered by
the SCC.

After he has been informed of
the Athletic Committee’s rul-
ing, President Huntley then
reportedly calls Athletic Direc-
tor William McHenry and in-
structs him to implement the
committee’s instructions.

There the matter rests until
Christmas break.

Magazines Cost $4 Apiece

 

Ariel Attacked By EC

Ariel editor Chris Faye
reported Monday night to the
Executive Committee that he
spent approximately two-thirds
of his budget on the first 40-page
edition of the Ariel.

The 400 copies of the literary
magazine, initially estimated to
cost $1400, actually cost $1582.90
to print and averaged $4.00 a
copy.

Many EC members express-
ed their personal displeasure
with the latest edition of Ariel.

‘“‘As a student I would like to
express my disappointment in
the Ariel,’’ said Senior

Representative Jay Blumberg.
“I’m not a literary critic, but

some of these things don’t seem

worthwhile,”’ said Blumberg.

Blumberg criticized Faye’s
budgeting for the magazine.

Senior Law Representative
John Fraser was also displeas-
ed and voiced his opinion, ~

‘Just to say that Jay is not a
minority, I would like to voice
my displeasure,’’ said Fraser.

Fraser also said ‘‘a fairly
large portion of the Ariel was

*trash.”’

“By and large, I would have
to agree with Jay,” was

Fraser’s concluding comment.

Other members of the EC also
voiced their displeasure with
the Ariel, among them Les Cot-
ter, EC Vice President, and Ed-
mund Schenecker, Freshman
Representative, who said some
of the material in the Ariel was
‘‘offensive.””

Discussion on the matter
stopped when Dee Keesler said
“I think this is out of our
realm.”

The EC decided the matter
should first be discussed by the
Publications Board, which
meets tonight at 7:30 in the
Cockpit.

Students On Student-Faculty
Committees Have Little Effect

by John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
learned Monday night that two
student representatives on joint
student-faculty committees
have little or no effect on their
committees.

Channing Hall, a member of
the Lecturers Committee, told
the EC that his committee has
not met in over a year-and-a-
half, yet has _ presented

  

        

Richard Valeriane

speakers under the direction of
John McKenzie Gunn, associate
professor of economics.

Hall told the EC that only
Gunn can call a meeting.

Most EC members stared in
disbelief while Hall gave his
report, but Senior Law
Representative John Fraser
suggested that ‘If you have a
vote, I think there should be
meetings and you should go to

‘Carterization’ Of America

by John Billmyre

President Carter's foreign
policy has been fragmented and
ineffective thus far, possibly
leading to the recent crises in
Afghanistan and Iran, but the
President may turn his foreign
policy around as a result of the
crises, according to NBC cor-
respondent Richard Valeriane.

‘I’m not here to criticize the
President's foreign policy. You

could have invited Andy Young
to do that,’ said Valeriane last
night during the first Contact
program of the year.

Valeriane’s topic was the
“Carterization’” of American
foreign policy.

He is a 16-year veteran of the
Washington press corps and
covered Watergate and the Bay

the meetings.’’ Hall reminded
the EC that the cannot force
meetings but said he would talk
to Gunn.

Stuart Miller and Chris Burn-
ham, members of the Library
Committee, told the EC that
while they offer much informa-
tion during Library Committee
meetings, Maurice Leech Jr.,
the University’s head librarian,
often ‘‘shucks off”’ their sugges-
tions.

Miller told the EC that
Leech’s attitude is, ‘‘we’ve
heard them, (the students on
the committee), now what do
we want to do.”’

One major point of controver-
sy for the committee and the
library staff is the use of the
door on the library’s lower level
four.

Jay Blumberg, Senior Repre-
sentative, asked Burnham why
students should not be able to
use the door and _ said,
“realistically, it’s not difficult
to take a book out of the
library.”

Blumberg was referring to
arguments by some that leav-
ing the door open would allow
people to take books out on the
lower level without checking
them out.

Burnham said he brought up
the idea to head librarian
Leech, but that Leech discarded
the suggestion.

“Leech has said that in-
surance will not cover the door
being unlocked,” said Burn-
ham. He was not sure if Leech
meant the building’s insurance
or insurance on the books.

After hearing about three pro-
posed student motions which
were tabled, Blumberg had
several questions about the
students’ role on the committee.

At one point during Blum-
berg’s questioning of Miller and
Burnham, EC President Steve

Jay Blumberg who is again co-chairing this years Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon is shown here leading a train of
dancers in last years dance which netted over $12,000.

MD Dance Marathon
Slated For Jan. 25

Students at Washington and
Lee University will try to raise
$15,000 later this month for
muscular dystrophy research
during their second annual 30-
hour dance marathon.

The event, sponsored by
W&L’s Interfraternity Council,
begins at 8 p.m. Jan. 25 in the
university’s Evans Hall. Some
120 dancers have already
registered to participate, ac-
cording to the marathon
chairmen, Jay Blumberg and J.
Hemby.

This Saturday’s basketball
game against Lynchburg will
benefit M.D. Contributions will
be taken at the door and a free
throw contest at halftime will
give away shirts.

Southwest Virginia’s poster
child, Ronda Lee Adkins, will
also be there.

A year ago, when Blumberg
organized W&L’s first Muscular
Dystrophy benefit dance
marathon, he set his goal at
$5,000. But it captured the im-
agination of students and others
beyond anyone’s expectations,
and by the time it was over,
more than $12,000 had been rais-
ed for clinical research and

equipment.
Participants are expected to
secure pledges — a certain

amount to be donated per hour
danced. To take part in the

marathon this year, each
dancer has to start with at least
$45 committed. ‘

The marathon will open with
the music of ‘‘Apaloosa,”’ a
Baltimore rock band which will
play until 10 p.m. “Union
Pacific” will perform from 10
until 2 in the morning, featuring
a program of ‘‘beach music.”

Taped music will be provided
for the energetic dancers dur-
ing the wee hours on Saturday,
from 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 a.m. The
two intervening hours will pro-
vide a rest break for the
dancers.

At 8 a.m., the marathon will
pick full speed again with the
bluegrass sounds of ‘Wild-
grass,”’ which will conduct its
usual two-hour program heard
on WREL radio live from Evans
Hall. WLUR-FM, Washington
and Lee’s_ student-operated
radio station, will take over the
entertainment reins at 10 a.m.,
for a three-hour remote borad-
cast of music hits.

Live bands will play from 1
p.m. on Saturday through the
end of the 30-hour dance, begin-
ning with the 1950s rock-and-roll
sound of loca] favorite ‘‘Dodge
D’Art,”’ frequent visitors to the
W&L Cockpit. Following at 3
p.m. will be another local band,
‘“Albatross,’’ specializing in a

~ ODK To Honor Four
Distinguished Alumni

Four prominent Washington
and Lee University alumni will
be initiated as honorary
members of Omicron Delta
Kappa — the national honor
society for campus leaders,
founded at W&L 66 years ago —
during the  university’s
Founders’ Day convocation Fri-
day (Jan. 18).

Among honorary ODK _ in-
itiates will be Edward M.
Korry, former ambassador to
Ethiopia (1963-67) and Chile
(1967-71). Korry, now a writer
and consultant in the field of
foreign affairs, will also be the
principal speaker of the day,
lecturing on the current
hostilities in the Middle East.

Other honorary initiates will
be Stanley A. Kamen of Malibu,
Calif., co-owner of the William
Morris Agency, the world’s
largest talent agency; Daniel C.
Lewis Jr. of West Point, Va.,
vice president in charge of ad-
ministration for the Chesa-
peake Corp.; and Dr. James H.
Sammons of Chicago, IIl., pro-
fessor of medicine and ex-
ecutive vice president of the
American Medical Association.

All four honorary initiates
will attend the ceremony, which
begins at 12:30 p.m. in W&L’s
Evans Hall. Robert E.R.

Huntley, university president, -

will preside over the occasion.

Korry, who graduated from
W&L with a B.A. in 1942, work-
ed for the National Broad-
casting Corp. and as a foreign
correspondent for United Press
before entering the diplomatic
corps. From 1954 to 1962 he was
European editor and assistant
to the president of the Cowles
Magazine and Broadcasting Co.
During his tenure as am-
bassador to Ethiopia, he wrote
the Korry Report on African
Development for President
Johnson. Currently residing in
Stonington, Conn., he teaches at
Connecticut College in addition
to his other activities.

Kamen is a 1949 law graduate
of Washington and Lee, and for
many years has been involved
in the university’s Annual Fund
drives. As co-owner of William
Morris, he has been involved in
arranging talent packages for a
large number of successful film
productions, including ‘Love
Story,’’ The Summer of ’42,”
“The Day of the Jackal,” and
“The Sterile Cuckoo.”’

Lewis was another member

23 South Main Street

of W&L’s undergraduate class
of 1942, and continued his
studies at Harvard, where he
received his M.B.A. doctorate
in commercial science. For a

time, he was also a member of-

the Washington and Lee faculty
in the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics. A
naval officer in World War II,
Lewis has also been active for a
number of years in community
projects. Before joining the
Chesapeake Corp., he was

secretary and treasurer of the

Lynchburg Foundry Co.
Sammons is a 1947 W&L
graduate. After receiving his
M.D. degree from St. Louis
University in 1951, he became
very active in Texas medical
circles. He has been president
of the East Harris County

(Tex.) Medical Association,
chairman of the board of coun-
cilors of the Texas Medical
Association, and chairman of
the board of directors of the
American Medical Political Ac-
tion Committee. For several
years, he was president and
chairman of the Houston
Academy of Medicine. In addi-
tion to his ANA position, he is
professor of family medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston.

The four honorary ODK in-
itiates will be joined by six law
students and 20 undergraduates
at W&L who have also been
chosen for ‘‘tapping’’ this
Founder’s Day. By tradition,
the names of the on-campus in-
itiates are kept secret until the
ceremony itself.

Former Ambassador

Richard A. (‘Captain Dick’’) Smith

Scholarship Created
To Honor Longtime
Athletic Director

An honor scholarship endow-
ment in memory of the late
Richard A. (Captain Dick’’)
Smith, longtime athletic direc-
tor at Washington and Lee
University, has been created at
W&L through a $25,000 gift from
his son.

Richard W. Smith, a 1941
graduate of Washington and
Lee and a prominent lawyer in
Staunton, established the
scholarship program to
recognize outstanding student
leadership — _ including
character, competitive spirit,
scholarship and _ athletic
achievement.

“Captain Dick,’’ a member of
the Virginia Sports Hall of
Fame, was director of inter-
collegiate athletics at W&L for
23 years, baseball coach for 30,
and basketball coach for five.

More Burglaries
Over Break

by David Greer

Several Washington and Lee
students returned from
Christmas break to find their
farmhouses had been burglar-
ized.

At least five houses had
stereos and other valuables
stolen from them over the
break. One student’s car was
broken into while it was parked
on the campus over break.

Mark Turner found his turn-
table, amplifier and tapes miss-
ing when he returned, but the
thieves left his speakers. In a
farmhouse next door, also oc-
cupied by students, two tape
decks, an amplifier, a chair and
some pictures were stolen.
Again the thieves left speakers
behind as well as some other
equipment.

Two stereos were stolen from
Bruce Moore and _ Tobin
Cassells at their house in the
country. A_ television and
another stereo was not taken.

Richard Schoenfeld and
Marsh Dougherty each lost
stereo equipment from their
house. Here, speakers were
again left behind, as was some
other equipment.

Richard Wallerstein and
Bruce Poole had stereos and
guns stolen from their house.

All of the burglarized houses
are in the county and are
generally isolated from each
other and neighbors. In most
cases liquor and bulky equip-
ment was left behind.

Richard Essex had _photo-
graphic equipment stolen from
his car while it was parked
behind the Graham-Lees dorm-
itory over break.

Sweetbriar student Lori
Faust had clothes valued at
over $1,000 stolen from her car
Sunday night, Jan. 6. The car
was parked below the Gym-
nasium in a Woods Creek park-
ing lot.

 

 

Pub Board
Meeting

The publications Board will
hold a meeting Thursday night
at 7:30 p.m. in the Cockpit. At-
tendance is mandatory.

 

 

he was an outstanding athlete
himself throughout his under-
graduate years — in spite of a
chronic shoulder separation
which ended his chance to play
major league baseball. ‘“‘Cap-
tain Dick’’ died August 15, 1975,
at the age of 86, credited with a
legacy of having helped mold
the character of hundreds of
W&L men. Washington and
Lee’s baseball field is named
Smith Field in his honor.

Income from the new scholar-
ship endowment will be used to
award “Captain Dick’’ Smith
Honor Scholarships to students
with financial need who have
compiled academic and extra-
curricular records of unusual
distinction.

The university said its hope is
that friends of ‘“‘Captain Dick,”
including alumni he influenced,
will choose to honor his memory
by helping increase the size of
the special scholarship endow-
ment. The goal is eventually to
increase the endowment to at
least $50,000.

When “Captain Dick’’ died,
the sports editor of the
Richmond Times-Dispatch,
Chauncey Durden, recalled him
as a “Washington and Lee in-
stitution and a Lexington land-
mark ... a delightful compan-
ion.”” W&L President Robert
E.R. Huntley said: ‘‘ ‘Captain
Dick’ Smith has been an institu-
tion at Washington and Lee. It is
from persons like him that this
school has derived its strength
and its character over the cen-
turies. I shall miss him sorely,
as will his many friends, but he
will never be forgotten at
W&L.”

The university said it is
especially fitting that ‘‘Captain
Dick’’ should be memorialized
by an honor scholarship pro-
gram. ‘Captain Dick’’ himself
once recalled that he almost
went to another college because
tuition at Washington and Lee
when he arrived in 1909 was $85,
but his scholarship was for only
$50.
A friend talked him into stay-
ing ‘for another day”’ beforo he
left Lexington. ‘‘Well, they fix-
ed me up with another $50
scholarship,” he reminisced.
“They weren’t supposed to give
but one, but I got two. Then I
had $15 change, and that went
for six months’ rent.”
One Less Nightspot

 

Paramount Inn

by Ed Edge

The Paramount Inn on
Washington Street has closed,
leaving the Washington and Lee
students one less “night spot”
that they may frequent.

Students returned from their
Christmas holidays to find the
restaurant and bar closed.
Thursday night “‘happy hours”’
that the establishment had been
offering the public were no
longer available.

Thursday nights between 10
p.m. and midnight students and
townspeople alike used to crowd
the Paramount Inn to take ad-
vantage of the lower beer
prices, but now there are few
bars for them to pick from.

The Paramount Inn offered
an informal atmosphere that
was attractive to students who
wanted to be in a casual setting.
Every type of attire could be
seen on these Thursday nights—
everything from coats and ties
to ragged jeans. It was a ‘come
as you are”’ type of situation.

With the loss of this place, the
person who is looking for a
place where he may sit, relax
and have a beer now finds his
choices limited.

Other establishments, or
pubs, similar to the Paramount
Inn in Lexington are the White
Column Inn and Central Lunch,
both on Main Street,

The White Column Inn, also
known for its “happy hour”’ on

Thursday nights, offers the
public a place to go for a cheap
beer, but it is not quite as large
or informal a place as was the
Paramount.

The White Column Inn does
give the student a place to go
and have a beer in more of a
“sit down” situation and be
served by waitresses.

The White Column has been a
long-time favorite for many
local people. There are always
the ‘regulars’ to be seen
around the establishment.

These ‘“‘regulars’’, some who
appear to be Washington and
Lee graduates, add to the per-
sonality of the White Column
Inn.

Across the street from the
White Column Inn is Central
Lunch, better known as
“Ducks.”’ .

Central Lunch is an even
smaller place than the Para-
mount or White Column inns. It

In duPont

Closes

is more of a walk-in place where

you can come in, get what you

want, and get out ina hurry.
Owned and run by Mr. and

- Mrs. Duck, the place is fre-

quented by students on a
regular basis.

Central Lunch is a favorite
among a great number of
students and has been for a long
time.

These three gathering places
for the W&L students — Para-
mount Inn, White Column Inn
and Central Lunch — have
given the students a place to go
to relax and get away from the
academic atmosphere of
school. With the closing of one
of these places, choices on
where to go at night are limited
to two.

Perhaps some enterprising
businessman will recognize the
need for another social gather-
ing place and capitalize on that
need.

Photographer’s Prints Still On Exhibit

Michael Miley, who produced
what are believed to be the first
color photographic prints—but
who is best remembered as
‘‘General Lee’s_ photo-
grapher’’—is the subject of a
month-long exhibition at
Washington and Lee beginning
next week.

The exhibit, the fifth in an an-
nual series at W&L devoted to
artists and works of art of im-
portance in the area, opened
Jan. 8 in duPont Gallery. More
than 180 Miley photographs are
on display.

In the first years of the 20th
century, Miley perfected a pro-
cess of printing color photo-
graphs by superimposing
separate single-color images in
each of the primary colors. He
and his son, Henry, patented the
technique in 1902, and in 1905
were awarded a Medal of Merit
by the Franklin Institute.

Miley looked on his own pro-
cess as too time-consuming and
too costly for commercial

development, however, and for
those reasons he ‘‘made no ef-
fort to have it brought into
general use,

His principal success resulted
from the large number of photo-

graphs he took of Robert E. Lee
when Lee was president of
Washington College, now W&L,
between 1865 and Lee’s death in
1870.

Among those pictures was the
famed photo of Lee on his
favorite horse, Traveller, made
in 1868 near Rockbridge Baths.
It became Miley’s best-selling
print and remains perhaps the
most popular Lee picture today.
Last year alone, W&L answered
more than 4,500 requests for
copies of a poster with that pic-
ture on it.

In addition to Miley’s Lee
photographs, the W&L exhibit
includes a large number of
other portrait photographs
Miley took of notable and not-
so-notable figures, visitors to
the area and residents.

Most of the color prints in the
exhibit are of still lifes or paint-

ings, because fixed objects lent.

themselves more easily than
people to the lengthy picture-
taking process Miley used.

In addition to portrait
photography, which comprised
the largest part of Miley’s
business, and his experimental
color photographs, the W&L ex-
hibit has a large number of
landscapes, which Miley took

largely because he was
fascinated by unusual cloud and
sunlight effects.

Every photograph in the ex-
hibition is a print actually made
by Miley or his son, who
became a partner in 1895.

Miley was born in 1842 in
Rockingham County, but grew
up in Rockbridge, near Fair-
field. After Civil War service
with the Confederate army, he
began his career in _photo-
graphy in Staunton, but soon

moved to Lexington. Although
he suffered from ‘‘infirmities”’
for the last three years of his
life, he continued to take an ac-
tive part in the business, which
by then was operated by his son,
until his death on May 23, 1918.

“Michael Miley: American
Photographer and Pioneer in
Color’’ will continue in duPont
Gallery through Feb. 1. The
gallery is open weekdays from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m., and there is no
admission charge.

Youth Charged In

A young Rockbridge County
man was arrested by Lexington

and charged with 10 counts of
breaking and entering, eight
counts of grand larceny, and
three counts of petty larceny.

Abraham told Blumberg that
his best chance of having ques-
tions answered might be ‘‘to
take the matter up with Mr.
Leech personally.”’

“I wonder if it’s even worth
the EC’s time or the Library
Committee’s time,’’ said
Blumberg in
Abraham’s suggestion.

Vandalism is.a major pro-
blem according to the commit-
tee. Burnham reported that
over 3,500 volumes are missing.

He also said the library is
regularly defaced and told the
EC about an incident in which a
freshman cut an assignment out
of a book and returned the book.

But most of the vandalism
goes unnoticed until it’s too late,
said the committee.

‘*T don’t know how to stop peo-
ple from doing things if you
don’t catch them,” said Burn-
ham.

‘“‘Maybe it’s time to rebrief
the freshmen,” said Burnham,
in response to a question about
who the main offenders may be.

The Library Committee, did
have some encouraging news.

Members on the committee
are- checking on the possibility
of obtaining a computer to per-
form duties in finding volumes
available at other libraries.

Robert Neely, also a member
of the Library Committee,
reported the committee is going
to VMI to see its computer and

 

response to

observe its operation.

A computer would eliminate
calling other libraries and
writing letters when searching
for books not in the new library.

The Committee announced
that a formal dedication of the
library will be held on May 23
and will feature three speakers
who have not yet been selected.

The EC also heard reports
from other committees that in-
dicate students have been suc-
cessful in their endeavors to
voice opinions and get results.

Tony Carli, a member of the
Faculty Executive Committee,
said, ‘‘The faculty is responsive
to student suggestions.”’

‘“‘We’ve had no conflicts and
we usually agree with the facul-
ty or they agree with us,” said
Carli.

But Senior Representative
Dee Keesler had a question
about the effectiveness of
students on the committee.

“Is the lack of conflict
healthy?’’, asked Keesler.

Les Cotter, Executive Com-
mittee Vice President, said the
lack of conflict was not bad.

“It’s a good give and take
situation where each case is
decided on its individual
merits,’’ said Cotter.

The Faculty EC decides
whether a student can take an
under or overloaded schedule.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole asked Carli why school
starts and ends so late.

“It’s kind of a tradition, we
never start before Labor Day,”
said Carli.

But Les Cotter added, ‘‘We
start so late because of the
trimester system.”’ He explain-
ed ‘‘That is the price we have to
pay for the trimester.”’

Carli told the EC that the
Faculty EC only makes recom-
mendations about the schedule.
The University Council has a
greater say about the schedule
than the Faculty EC and the
faculty has the final word on the
schedule.

The EC also passed a motion
after it was told by John
Hamilton, The Calyx business
manager, that a graduate had
bought materials tax free,
under the university’s name,
and then repaid The Calyx.

Bob Willis, who said he was
greatly upset by the graduate’s
use of the tax-free status said,
‘‘T want to make a proposal that
this does not happen again.”’

Blumberg reprimanded
Hamilton, who did not find out
about the purchase until after it
had been made.

“It seems this is the second
time this has happened,” said
Blumberg.

He proposed, ‘I would recom-
mend that private purchasing
under the school’s tax-free
status not be allowed.”’

The vote passed 11-0, with one
member, Bruce Poole, absent.
Poole left the meeting early.

The University Athletic Com-
mittee also reported on its ac-
tions during the past few
months.

The Committee met three
times, once for a _ regular
meeting, once at the Presi-
dent’s request and once at the
request of two basketball

players who were suspended
from the varsity squad.

Tom Wall, a member of the
University Athletic Committee,
told the EC, ‘‘President Huntley
just told us to meet and discuss
the basketball players, he did
not recommend what’ action
should be taken.”’

Wall explained that since all
W&L students were found to be
equally guilty, they were all
given the same penalty.

The nine .athletes involved
will not be allowed to represent
W&L in any athletic contest for

 

one calendar year.

The penalty also applies to
the two assistants to the basket-
ball team.

_ And the W&L graduate who
was coaching will not be allow-
ed tocoach at W&L again.

Jack Norberg, also of the
University Athletic Committee,
said the basketball players felt
they had been judged too harsh-
ly and wanted their case to be
appealed.

The University Athletic Com-
mittee did not hear the case

again. ;

Dr. Merchant Named
New Advisor To IFC

The Washington and Lee
Inter-fraternity Council Tues-
day elected John Holt Merchant
Jr., assistant history professor,
as its faculty adviser.

Merchant was one of the four
faculty members considered for
the position, a position that the
IFC felt was needed in light of
faculty-fraternity strife which
came toa head last year.

Syd Farrar, IFC president,
said that the role of the faculty
adviser would be to attend IFC
meetings and help the IFC im-
prove the image of fraternities
in the faculty’s eyes. Also, Far-
rar said the adviser could give
the IFC a taste of faculty reac-
tion to its proposals before they
became policy. .

In other business, IFC
weekend has tentatively been
planned for the weekend of
March 22. Ab Boxley, social
chairman, suggested that. a

objected.

Also, Boxley said the IFC has
plenty of money to spend and
might work towards a party at

two bands after the home
lacrosse game against N.C.

Finally, the IFC passed a
recommendation that each

Farrar called a meeting of

Wednesday at 7:00. Besides
minor intra-fraternity disputes,
the board will investigate the
funding of several Wednesday
night parties that fraternities
had last week.

Last Week

City Charges Student Body $385

For Damage To Police Car

by John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
tabled action on restitution to
the city of Lexington for
damages done to a police car
and defined the role of ad hoc
members to EC subcommittees
during a short meeting last
week.

EC President Steve Abraham
read a letter to the EC which
Chief of Police James A. Kirby
sent to the university.

Dean of Students Louis G.
John received the letter and
gave it to the EC because “‘it in-
volved a student-matter.”’

Kirby’s letter charged that
Washington and Lee students
were responsible for $385 worth
of damage done to a police
cruiser during the anti-Iranian
rally before the Christmas
break.

Abraham suggested that the
committee not act on the matter
until it had information about
the department’s insurance on
the car. ;

‘‘We want to see if the city’s

‘insurance will pay for the
damage,” said Abraham.

- Junior Representative Bruce
Poole agreed with Abraham,
but Senior Law Representative
John Fraser said a greater
question had to be answered.

Fraser condemned W&L stu-
dent’s behavior on the night of
the rally, but the students’
behavior was not really the
question.

“The students showed
juvenile behavior to start with,
but I don’t want to start a prece-
dent where everytime a W&L
student goes downtown and
raises hell the University has to
pay for it,”’ said Fraser.

Fraser said the University
cannot be responsible for the

actions of all of its students and
asked the committee, “Are we
going to pay for the boxwoods?”’
Abraham stopped discussion
before the boxwoods were dis-
cussed at length and the EC
voted unanimously to table the
matter until it has more in-
formation about the incident.

The role of ad hoc members to
EC subcommittees was also
defined after several minutes of
debate.

“It has come to my attention
that some EC members have
been voting on their ad hoc com-
mittees,’’ said Abraham.

Senior academic represen-
tative Jay Blumberg criticized
that practice.

“It is not fair, as in the case of

Student Control, for an ad hoc °

member to vote on an elected
board,” said Blumberg.

Bruce Poole, who was a mem-
ber of the Student Control Com-
mittee last year and is an ad hoc
member this year agreed with
Blumberg but said that he has
voted on Student Control mat-
ters this year, a practice he said
he has stopped.

Dee Keesler, the second
senior representative, explain-
ed his view on the role of the ad
hoc member.

“I feel it is our duty to express
the EC point of view to the sub-
committees,”’ said Keesler.

Following discussion, Blum-
berg proposed that “EC mem-
bers act in an advisory capacity
and not vote in any decision.”’
The motion passed unanimous-
ly.
The EC also heard reports
from its subcommittees.

Members of the Student Ac-
tivities Board reported that
they are staying within their

budget, though they could not
file a complete budget since all
bills had not been received.

In response to a question from
Dee Keesler, SAB member
Danny Ruskin said attendance
at meetings has been good.

The University Center Com-
mittee, which is subordinate to
the SAB, reported that it has
two-thirds of its budget to spend
during the remainder of the
year.

Contact announced its
schedule for January and

February. The schedule in-

cludes three speakers: Richard
Valerini, a State Department
Correspondent with NBC news,
Gen. William Westmoreland,
and Robert Evans,

Blumberg and Keesler asked
Contact Co-chairman Scott Car-
doza if the platform for the
speakers could be more varied.

Cardoza explained that he is

working for a program that will -

have people attend the Contact
program on a regular basis.

Cardoza also said that Con-
tact has saved $300 this year by
using a different type of postal
permit than has been used in
the past.

Correspondent Is Grim
On Soviet Intentions

Washington correspondent
Charles Corddry painted a dim
picture of the Soviet Union’s
policies in the 1980’s and their
relationship to the United States
Monday evening in Lee Chapel.

Corddry, a Washington mili-

tary affairs correspondent for
the Baltimore Sun addressed
the audience with his talk
“Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan—
There Goes the Whole
Neighborhood.”’

In the course of his discus-
sion, Corddry speculated as to

| the Soviet Union’s intentions in

Afghanistan. The reason for the
invasion, Corddry said, ‘‘could
lay in the fact that the Soviet
Union does not wish any
political instability on its
borders, or possibly the Soviets
have long range plans.”’
Corddry explained the Soviets
must have felt that American
opinion was not important, par-
ticularly in light of the Senate’s
failure to ratify SALT II and the

recent buildup of NATO defense
forces.

With Soviet influence already
present in North Africa, Cord-
dry expressed concern over a
possible Soviet plan to take over
the Strait of Hormuz, in the Per-
sian Gulf. With 60 percent of the
world’s oil traveling through
the Strait, a Soviet takeover of
that area would be strongly felt.

In addition to outlining what
he viewed to be the aims of the
Soviets in the mid-East, Cord-
dry came to the aid of the
Carter Administration by say-
ing that they, ‘‘had been taking
a bum rap on defense.”’ Corddry
explained that even though
most people equate Carter and
defense with the cancellation of
the B-1 bomber and the neutron
bomb, the President recognized
a dangerous defensive situation
when he took office.

Corddry pointed out that
Carter has made strong moves

Opera On WLUR

WLUR-FM’s broadcasts of
Saturday matinee Metropolitan
Opera performances will con-
tinue this month with master-
pieces by Verdi, Puccini and
Beethoven. All programs may
be head on the Washington and
Lee University radio station at
91.5 on the dial.

Verdi’s popular three-act
opera ‘‘Rigoletto,’’ scheduled
for broadcast this Saturday
(Jan. 19) beginning at 1:30
p.m., will open the series. Tell-
ing the story of the hunchback-
ed buffoon Rigoletto, his
beautiful daughter Gilda, and
her death at the hands of the
evil Duke of Mantua and his
comrades, the opera was one of
Verdi’s first important suc-
cesses. With “La Traviata” and
“Tl Trovatore,” it forms part of
the so-called ‘‘golden trilogy”’ of
masterpieces that had their
premier performances during a
hectic 18-month period between
1851 and 1853.

Singing principal roles will be
soprano Gail Robinson as
Gilda; baritone Sherrill Milnes
in the title role; tenor Carlo Bini
as the Duke; mezzo-soprano
Isola Jones as Maddalena; and
bass Jerome Hines as
Sparafucile. David Stivender
will conduct.

During the first intermission,
musicologist Boris Goldovsky
will present a musical and
dramatic analysis of ‘‘Rigolet-
to’’ in “Opera News On the
Air,”’ and a panel of opera ex-
perts will face quizmaster Ed-
ward Downes during the second
intermission for another round
of Texaco’s Opera Quiz.

The following Saturday (Jan.
26) WLUR will broadcast Puc-
cini’s “‘Tosca’’ beginning at 2
p.m. First heard in 1900,
“Tosca’’ remains a triumph of
‘‘verismo’’ opera — a form that
deals with brutal passions in an
utterly realistic fashion.

Soprano Montserrat Caballe
will sing the role of Floria
Tosca, with tenor Giuseppe
Giacomini as her lover, the
painter Mario Cavaradossi.
Cornell MacNeil, a familiar
face at the Met for decades in
roles from Tonio in ‘‘Pagliacci”’
to Trinity Moses in this year’s
‘‘Mahagonny,’’ will be heard as
the villanious Baron Scarpia.

That performance will be
followed on Feb. 2. by
Beethoven’s only opera,
‘Fidelio,”’ scheduled to start at
2 p.m. A high-minded version of
the familiar ‘‘rescue opera’’ so
popular in the early 19th cen-
tury, ‘Fidelio’ deals with ex-
alted themes such as_ the
celebration of married love and

the triumph of freedom over

tyranny. It is perhaps best
known for the four overtures co
osed by Beethoven to introduce
it to eager audiences.

Verdi’s ‘‘Otello”’ will be heard
the following Saturday, Feb. 9,
also at 2 p.m. Composed after 16
years of retirement by Verdi,
“Otello” opened to madly en-
thusiastic audiences in 1887 and
has retained its. pre-eminent
position ever since. This lyrical
version of Shakespeare’s
tragedy of marital distrust and
murder was_ broadcasted
earlier this year, as the season
opener for PBS _ television’s
‘‘Live From the Met” series.

Videodiscs: Music’s Newest Wave

by Mark Kinniburgh

The advent of the 80’s promises a new decade of
musical advances, ranging from the new digital
mode of recording master tapes to videodisc
jukebox. One company that is leading the charge
into the new technical branches of music
reproduction is Paradise Records from Burbank,
California. Through their most illustrious artist,
Leon Russell, Paradise has the chance to test two
40-track recording studios, (a far cry from the 4
and 8 track studios of the Beatles and Rolling
Stones a few years back), audio-mobile units
capable of remote recording and mixing, and
television set-ups to record an artist on a video
cassette.

The relationship between Leon Russell and
Paradise Records unites two innovators with
great results. Leon Russell has been with Jerry
Lee Lewis, playing piano and arranging new
music.

His talent developed in early rock and blues
roots, as he did most of the Spector Records pro-
ductions of the Crystals and Rovettes, plus the
Righteous Brothers sessions. He was the pianist
for the Byrds classic ‘Mr. Tamborine Man”
recording and Ike and Tina Turner’s ‘‘River Deep,
Mountain High.”

After an experimental interlude with Marc Ben-
no, Russell contributed to Delaney and Bonnie’s
first album and worked with Joe Cocker, for whom
he wrote “Delta Lady.’’ Russell may have gained
his greatest fame for his song writing, with such
hits as ‘“‘Superstar”’ (recorded by the Carpenters)
and ‘“‘This Masquerade’’ (George Benson) and his
own “Lady Blue.”’ Currently, Russell has his
latest album ‘Life and Love” doing well in most
major radio markets.

Leon Russell is a very worthy candidate for the
many developments in recorded musical per-
formances, and he has invented and implemented
many of’ the experimental techniques of audio-

visual reproduction coming to light today. -

Especially with the new video disc concept which
entails using a highly advanced recording studio
in conjunction with a TV set-up and recording that
entire project on a video cassette which is used as
promotion or home entertainment. The latter, now
more than ever, has been the focus of a rather
large marketing push involving a ‘‘jukebox”’
mechanism whereby a patron at a bar or other
establishment could deposit his quarter and see
and hear someone like Todd Rundgren or Blondie
in concert.

In tests of this experiment,

Catfish Hodge

 

Dash Doesn't Like ‘Yanks’

Directed by John Schlesinger

Written by Colin Welland and Walter Bernstein
With Rich Gere, Vanessa Redgrave, Will Devane,
and Lisa Eichman

Spontaneous me is at work! Ah, what fun to be
an anglophobe reviewing an Anglaphilic movie!
What fun to launch into those inbred, syphilitic
sheep-buggers (with their decayed complexions)!
But, oh yes, the movie.

Here we have a trite melodrama, in the vein of
Summer of ‘42, trying to cash-in on all the
nostalgia we all must have for a better time when
things were cheap, especially human life. Our
story concerns three romances between British
lasses and our wholesome American boys who’ve
come to save their two-bit, fourth floor, cold-water
walk-up of an island while their own whimpy
manhood is off defending their Imperialistic col-
onies in Africa and Burma.

Romance number one is a fun romance.
Rachael Roberts, a conductor on an “omnibus,”
meets Chic Vennera, his unit’s token Italian, on
her bus. They go to the movies, fall in love, get
married, and say goodbye in a train station in that
order, She’s sultry, he’s easygoing, and that’s
that.

Rich Gere meets Lisa Eichman and all is not so
simple, Lisa it seems is at first unwilling to go out
with curly haired Rich because she has a fiance
fighting in Burma (and her family hates
‘“‘Yanks’’), But, on a companionate basis, they do
agree to go out. Her ‘lad’, however, is killed in
Burma and the predictable Summer of ‘42 things
tug on all your heartstrings in a vain attempt to

false sentiment cheaply earned. Oh, and her mom
dies too.

Will Devane, one of the ugliest actors to be work-
ing now, is having an affair with Vanessa
Redgrave, here playing an aristocratic navy of-
ficer’s wife (shame on you, Vanessa! What would
Arafat say?). Here the complications are many;
they are both married, her young son dislikes be-
ing buggered by the other sadistic waifs at his
boarding school (he’s not sporting!) and calls
home at all hours crying into the phone! Devane
has trouble getting passes, and she feels dirty
about the whole thing, It’s nice to know that
Devane, however, is an officer, so it’s not like
she’s being a tramp and forgetting her inbreeding.

Oh, and how those Limeys dislike us! You would
think that they would appreciate our bailing out
their exploitive mercantilist empire from a
menace that they, to a large part, had created, but
nooo! They seem to resent our presence and freely
pour urine on our boys in uniform! Gad, if only the
alternative to being allied with them hadn’t been
so wholly repugnant!

Ah, but all that nostalgia! This is a rather
faithful movie when it comes to portraying life in a
small British town in the 1940’s, and this is the
movie’s only strength. Of course, there are the
cliche’ genre movie things: a race riot ensuing
when a black soldier dances with a British girl and
a George Wallace look-alike intervenes, those cute
elfish Limey boys beating up on each other if
they’re lucky enough to go to prep school, bar-
racks life (the man’s life) etc., etc., and so on. Not
on par with most films of the genre.

Fassbinder’s ‘Fox

and His Friends’

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present its first film
of the winter season, Rainer
Werner Fassbinder’s Fox and
His Friends (also known as
Fist-Right of Freedom), on Fri-
day and Saturday, in Classroom
‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall, free of
charge. All members of the
campus and community are
cordially invited to attend.

The director of Fox and His
Friends (Germany, 1975), is one
of the two best-known and most
important film makers in the
West German film renaissance
of the past decade. Fass-
binder’s most recent. film, The
Marriage of Maria Braun, is
perhaps the most impressive
new film now playing in New
York. The other director is
Werner Herzog, who made the
last film we showed, The
Mystery of Kaspar Hauser. The
two directors create radically
different worlds.

While Herzog is interested in
transcendental experience and
metaphors of flight, Fassbinder
is a cinematic naturalist, with
some of the melodrama and all
of the power that term implies.

Herzog shows man escaping the
limits ordinarily associated
with social life and the human
condition; Fassbinder explores
the power of society, cir-
cumstance, and_ personality
itself to restrain and even
deform individual aspiration.

Fox is the story of a lower-
class carnival entertainer,
played by Fassbinder himself,
who wins the lottery and falls in
love with a man from the upper
classes. He enters a world of
money and new friends in which
he is ultimately stripped of
everything he owns and is.
Gauche, sloppy and educated,
he hopes that love will turn him
from an ugly duckling into a
swan, but he is finally left to die
in utter anonymity in the Ger-
man metro.

Fassbinder’s movie is a study
of outsiders caught in a society
which places immense value on
social legitimacy and ap-
pearances. As a homosexual
and a member of the lower
classes, Fox is the supreme out-
sider, although even the
wealthy gay world into which he

From the Pressbox

Of Stupor Bowls

by Bill Whalen

Come Jan. 21, I might be the happiest person alive.
The 21st is the day after the Super Bowl.

Here is my problem. My roommate is a Pittsburgh
Steelers fan, and since the beginning of the season,
almost four and a half months ago, all I have heard
about are the ‘‘Super”’ Steelers. Now I have nothing
personal against the city of Pittsburgh and I even
think Terry Bradshaw can spell ‘‘cat’’, but enough is
enough. Let’s just play the damn game and end all the
talk of how great the Steelers are.

This is not to say that the Steelers are not the best
team in football today. They are — and Super Bowl
XIV should prove this. The Los Angeles Rams are 10-
point underdogs. That amounts to a touchdown and a
field goal. But this is the key question: Can the Rams
score a touchdown and a field goal against the ‘‘Stee!
Curtain’? The answer: More than likely, but after the
game is out of hand — like 28-0 Pittsburgh.

Let’s face it, some things in life are simply unat-
tainable. No one will ever figure a way to beat the
Four-Corners offense; I will never get a date with
Cheryl Tiegs and the Los Angeles Rams will never be
the best team in pro football. The Rams have always
struck me as being a bunch of losers. For one, they
play in the worst diversion of the weaker conference.
The Rams also show as much emotion as Duke, the
semi-comatose houndog of ‘“‘The Beverly Hillbillies”’
fame.

Of course, it is not totally unlikely that the Rams
will lose this Sunday. But considering how both teams
match up on offense and defense, the coaching
abilities of Ray Malavasi and Chuck Noll and the way
the Rams played in the NFC Championship, it should
be a laughter for the Steelers.

The number ‘‘3”’ will play a big part in this game,
the Steelers winning for the third time in four years
by a score of 33-13.

And College Capers

On a more serious note, there seems to be some
type of cancer which is spreading through all types
and levels of college sports. It all started in the fall
with the antics of Frank Kush, the former football
coach at Arizona State. Only recently, the disease
spread to next-door neighbor New Mexico State,
where the transcripts of several basketball players
were found to have been doctored.

Now there is a problem in the ACC Heartland —
Tobacco Road. The issue at hand is how N.C. State
player Clyde ‘‘the Glide” Austin has managed to ob-
tain an M.G. and a Cadillac. But down the road at
Chapel Hill, there is the news that Mike Okoren and
Dave Colescott received brand-new Hondas last year.
Sounds like something is rotten in the state of
Carolina.

In 1980, the NCAA appears to be at the crossroads in
the battle against bribes and kickbacks. But are the
players at fault when they take cars from greedy
alumni or sell tickets to over-anxious fans?

No.

The original fault lies with the administrators who
have pushed collegiate athletics into its current state
of near-professionalism. When collegiate sports reach
this level, no one is a winner. Athletes may be
suspended or dismissed for being involved, schools
can be placed on probation and lives are ruined in the
process. And when the players, coaches and schools
are penalized, the fans themselves become the
ultimate victims.

 

 

 

The Generals in action in last weekend’s basketball tournament held at Washington and Lee.

Generals Lose To H-SC;
Record Now Below .500

Second-Half Drought Leads To 62-58 Loss

by Bill Whalen and Dale Park

It certainly is funny how the
shoe can be on the other foot at
times. Take Tuesday night’s
basketball game at Hampden-
Sydney, for example. The
Generals, who are gaining fame
around the O.D.A.C as_ the
‘‘Boxwood Five’’, found
themselves not to be the only
“‘bush’’ team.

That honor and many more go
to the Tigers and their ignorant,
classless supporters who have
the nerve to call themselves

basketball fans. Waving bran- -

ches and cheering ‘‘B-U-S-H’’,
the Sydney students seemed to
be more preoccupied with their
antics than their team’s per-
formance.

Nonetheless, the Generals
came out on the short end of a
62-58 decision. The loss, the
Generals’ second in a row, drop-
ped the team’s record to 1-1 in
conference play and 5-6 overall.

‘My players showed courage
and guts,’’ said Coach Verne
Canfield, ‘‘and I’m extremely
pleased with that.’”” What must
have especially pleased Can-
field was the fact that his young
squad (five of the eight players
who participated for W&L were
either freshmen or  sopho-
mores) seemed to handle the
pressure that accompanies an
important road game.

Led by the outside bombing of
Drew Payne, H-SC jumped to
an early 14-8 lead. But the
Generals stayed close thanks to
strong inside play by Rob
Smitherman and R.J. Scaggs,
and a tip-in by Brian Hanson
knotted the score at 20-all.

“We played well enough to
win,” commented Canfield,
“and I can honestly say that we
would not have done anything
differently.’’ Both teams traded
the lead four times in the last
two minutes of the period.
Another tip-in by Hanson, this
time at the buzzer, gave the
Generals a 34-33 lead going into
the lockerroom.

At the start of the second half,
it appeared to be all W&L. Clark
New scored six of the team’s
first eight and eight of his
team’s first 14 as the Generals
moved to a 50-43 lead with 13:23
left in the game.

It proved to be a lead they
Could not handle.

W&L’s 2-1-2 zone defense was
also taking its effect on the
Tigers’ game plan. The zone
was effective in keeping
Sydney’s Ed Owens off the
boards. The man who usually
burns the Generals for 20 re-
bounds only collected 12 on the
night.

But the Generals could not
Stay in front due to some timely
shooting by Bill Shelly. Shelly
connected on three 25-footers to
pull his team to within one
point, 54-53, with 6:13 remain-
ing.

After the Generals could not
score on three attempts, the
Tigers put together a three-
point play to go ahead for good
with only 5:30 to go. Sydney’s
comeback was also helped by
the Generals’ inability to score
for over three minutes.

By the time Tom Jeffries
scored two of his- team-high 12
points, there was only 3:13 left

and H-SC was ahead by four.
Neither team was then able to
score until only 0:29 remained
in the game. The Generals’ of-
fense, which had been master-
ful in building second-half leads
of seven and five points, could
muster only eight points in the
final 13 minutes.

Another W&L miss gave the
Tigers the ball and Jeff Kroll
sank both ends of a one-and-one
opportunity to seal the game at
60-56. Jeffries hit from the top of
the key with nine seconds left,
but Kroll hit two more free
throws with seven seconds left
to. end the scoring at 62-58,
H-SC.

Though the loss dropped the
Generals below .500 for the first
time this season, Canfield was
not about to admit any panic.
“We will use this game as a
foundations for others’’, said
the coach. “If we can build a
strong bench, we should do 0.K.
for the rest of the season.”’

Surprisingly, Canfield was
not too bothered by the hecklers
who threw branches at the
Generals throughout the game
amd placed some pieces of
shrubbery on the W&L bench
during halftime. ‘‘When I’m on
the court, I don’t let them
bother me,”’ said the coach. “I
concentrate on coaching.”’

With the threat of more
hecklers awaiting them on the
campuses of Lynchburg and
Roanoke, for example, at least
the Generals know what the ex-
perience is like.

Chalk this one up to ex-
perience, ;
Cagers Bow In Finals
Of W&L aicone

by Dale Park

“We're still working to get
our players adjusted to the new
starting line-up and to the new
systems on offense . and
defense.’’ So says W&L Head
Basketball Coach Verne Can-
field after his Generals split
their two games in last
weekend’s W&L_ Invitational
Basketball Tournament.

Friday night’s game, which
pitted W&L against York Col-
lege, gave General fans their
first look at a new starting five
or “‘blues” team.

Remaining from the old start-
ing unit were juniors Rob
Smitherman and R.J. Scaggs
and senior Tom Jeffries. The
new faces both Friday and

Saturday night for the Generals -

were sophomore George Spears
and freshman Brian Hansen.

Against York, W&L concen-
trated on patient ball handling
and a widespread offense that
keyed on looking for the good
shot.

The Generals raced to a quick
32-19 halftime lead behind the
good playmaking and passing of
Spears at guard. Spears’ 15
points on the night helped fill
the greatest void in the
Generals’ offense — the lack of
an experienced, playmaking
guard.

Jeffries, a forward, was the
big offensive weapon for W&L
— scoring 17 points and grabb-
ing seven rebounds. Yet ‘‘T.J.”’

has been equally important by ©

providing leadership and ex-
perience to a team during a
period of readjustment.

Smitherman, although
hampered with a leg injury,
proved tough defensively and
poured in 10 points to aid the of-
fensive effort. The 6’7”’ center
\ also allowed only seven total
points to be scored by the two
York centers he faced ‘that
evening.

Both Hansen (forward) and
Scaggs (guard) added five
points each to round out a
starting-five shooting average
of 45 percent from the field and
- 52 points total.

Wrestling Team Returns

by Chris Sisto

Since returning to school
from the holiday break the var-
sity wrestling team has lost two
dual meets and extended their
record to 1-4.

The losses came at the hands
of .Campbell College (32-18),
and Duke University (50-3).
Against Campbell, Captain Ray
Gross, sophomore Mike McFad-
den, and senior Ed Rogers were
the individual winners for the
Generals. They all won by
points. In the Duke matchup on-
ly Gross was a winner, also by
points.

Head coach Gary Franke is
somewhat disappointed by the
early season play of his team.
‘“‘We have not fielded the best
possible team yet,’’ Franke
said. He placed some of the
blame on injuries to Rodgers,
Mike Deighan, and freshman
Bill Hogan. Franke also said he
felt that some of the younger
players have come around

 

pre

 

Patterson, ‘“‘T’’ scored 10
points, including several key
baskets down the stretch. In ad-
dition, Patterson grabbed seven
rebounds and had _ several
assists that guaranteed the
Generals’s 65-55 victory.

Against York, the Generals
played a tough, primarily man-
to-man defense and rarely
allowed the Spartans more than
one shot on offense. W&L faced
a much quicker team in Ogle-
thorpe in Saturday night’s
championship game, however.

Several positive factors were
evident in the Generals’ 70-55
loss.

Scaggs scored four points and
grabbed four rebounds, while
Hansen had six points and two
rebounds, close to the equiva-
lent of their previous night’s
totals.

Jeffries continued to play in-
spired basketball, scoring 16
points and hauling in eight re-
bounds.

Smitherman, as well, increas-
ed his offensive output, shooting
7-for-13 for 14 points and nine re-
bounds. In the opening minutes
of the game Smitherman block-

slower than he expected. This
season there are four freshmen

was sophomore forward Travis

ed three shots, and, like the en-
tire team, played solid defense
and patient offense, enabling
the Generals to take a 31-29
halftime lead.

Yet the negative factors that
cost the Generals a poor second
half and the game become im-

portant as W&L moves into the
vital part of its O.D.A.C.
season.

Spears’ output as guard drop-
ped to four points total for the
night and the team shot a
dismal 38 percent from the field
in the second half. In addition,
an offense, which had been look-
ing for the good shot, seemed to
grow restless and force the ball
up.

Some consolation was given
by sophomore guard Clark
New’s nine points off the bench.
Yet New’s performance was not
enough to offset the poor overall
shooting of the team.

Experience and patience are
the key words as the Generals
prepare to face their rivals in
ODAC. “We’re short on depth,
especially at guard,” said Can-
field, ‘‘and it’s taking time to
develop some.”’

“But time is something we
don’t have much of at this point
in the season.”’

Skiing Report:

 

ocal Resorts Lack

(2m Necessary Snowfall

The ski season has started rather slowly this year, with milder
than normal temperatures delaying the planned openings of almost
all Eastern ski areas. The exception is at Killington in Vermont,
which had its annual publicity stunt with its Oct. 9 opening of two
slopes, earlier than any other ski resort in the nation with the ex-
ception of the year-round resort on Mount Hood. The skiing in the
East until the Christmas-New Year’s holidays was practically non-
existent, though, with ski areas such as Killington and Stowe open-
ing about 15 percent of their skiable terrain.

The best skiing in the East has been at nearby Srowshoe, West

_ Virginia, where they have been operating with extremely favorable

weather conditions since the first day of their season on Nov. 24. In
addition to the excellent snow condition at Snowshoe, there are also
to be found some of the best trails in the east, with Snowshoe’s best
being Cup Run, which is about one and one-fourth miles long with
excellent mogul runs.

Sugar Mountain in North Carolina was not able to ski above its
half-way point until last weekend and the large crowds that have
descended there have made it practically impossible to keep a good
snow surface,

In contrast, Beech Mountain, located only about seven miles
from Sugar, has been skiing from the top of the mountain for over a
month, with lift lines of less than 30 minutes, compared to Sugar’s
lines of over one hour on the weekends. The recent snowfalls have
given Beech, which has the highest skiing east of the Rockies, an
excellent base on which to made snow, which is very important
since snow making is the lifeblood of Eastern skiing.

Two areas close to Lexington that attract many W&L students
are Massanutten and Wintergreen. Massanutten has the most ver-
tical of any area in Virginia when it opened on Dec. 1. Massanutten
used to be the destination for W&L students enrolled in the skiing
P.E. class, but this year the P.E. skiers will travel to Wintergreen,
which has less vertical, but the same degree of challenge as
Massanutten. In addition, Wintergreen cut a new expert slope over
the summer and installed lights on the advanced and expert slopes
for much more challenging night skiing. So far, however, the lack
of consistently cold weather has hurt Wintergreen’s skiing with
there being very little snow on the expert slopes.

While the weather has not cooperated completely so far this ski
season, there is still good skiing to be found in the East, whether it
is in West Virginia, North Carolina, Vermont, or Virginia.

All it takes is a few phone calls to check out the present conditions
and a decision about at which area to spend a day, weekend, or holi-
day week.

Many Students Benefit From ROTC Experience

by Dave Dudka

If it is true that “‘Washington
and Lee men have little trouble
finding dates,’’ (and who would
admit it even if it weren’t), then
it may be asserted that
Washington and Lee men have
even less trouble finding jobs
after graduation.

For this reason it is notable

that over the past several years ~

an increasing number of
students have committed them-
selves to serve in the Army
after graduation, whether it be
on active duty or in the
Reserves.

What is more interesting is
that very few of these students
had any intentions of being in
the Army when they first came
to W&L.

Each year many freshmen
and sophomores enroll in those
R.O.T.C. courses, which are
both open and _ nonbinding,
mostly from a passive interest
in the military, and because
they are an unusual alternative
to most electives offered on the
“hill,” (not to mention that
these courses are generally
easier to do well in).

For interested students there
are a variety of ways to serve in
the Army. Cadets who consider
an Army career will often
receive a ‘‘Regular Army”
commission which has a
minimum four year active duty
and two year Army Reserves
commitment.

A Cadet repels from the footbridge.

Cadets with R.O.T.C. scholar-
ships are also required to serve
for four years on active duty
and two years in the Reserves,
no matter whether they are on
one, two, three or four year
scholarships. It is noteworthy
that most of the Washington and
Lee cadets on_ scholarships
received them after they had
entered college.

Many cadets not on scholar-
ships will receive ‘‘Reserve”’
commissions which also have a
six year obligation with three or
four years of active duty and
the rest spent in the Reserves.
Those cadets not interested in
active duty usually choose to go
ADT (Active Duty for Train-
ing), which consists of just 90
days active duty and-a six year
Reserves or National Guard
commitment.

Although some students will
receive two or three year
R.O.T.C. scholarships, most
students interested in the Army
will decide before the beginning
of their junior year whether or
not to ‘“‘contract,’’ which is a
formal commitment to duty.

Those who do ‘“‘contract’’ at
the beginning of their junior
year have obligatory military
service after graduation and
receive $100 a month for their
last two years while in school.

Although $100 each month is
admittingly an incentive, it is
rarely a major factor in a stu-
dent’s decision to ‘contract’

 

 

 

with the Army.

When Cadet Junior Doug
Shipman entered Washington
and Lee he was only mildly in-
terested in the R.O.T.C. pro-
gram and never thought that he
would ‘‘contract.”’ His decision
to go into the military had much
to do with the good job ex-
perience and leadership poten-
tial that he believes the Army
offers as well as benefits such
as travel and an opportunity for
“personal development.”

Although Shipman has receiv-
ed a two year scholarship, he is
certain that he would have
“contracted” anyway.

Like Shipman, Cadet Senior
Bill Hill said he was ‘‘confident
I would not join’’ when he first
came to college but by the end

of his sophomore year both the _

money and the opportunities
had changed his mind. Some of
the reasons he gives for his
decision to ‘‘contract’’ are the
leadership training, confidence
building, and good opportuni-
ties he feels he will get from the
Army.

Hill intends to spend only 90
days on active duty and then go
into the Reserves.

This will not only be an extra
$180 per month but also a good
“change of pace’ from law
school which he plans to enter
next fall.

Cadet Junior Alan Pryor con-
siders the challenge of the Ar-
my as a major reason for his
commitment, although a three
year scholarship certainly
helped. Pryor’s idea of

; challenge consists partly of
| receiving airborne training, (a

three week parachute school he
attended last summer), and go-

3 ing to Ranger Camp for 11

weeks this summer which will

* comprise tough combat train-

ing under severe physical and
mental conditions. Pryor plans

~ to take a three year defferment

before going on active duty in

' order to attend law school.

After law school he plans to

Germany as an Army lawyer.
Almost every cadet has dif-

ferent reasons for wanting to

serve in the Army. Junior Ed

%, Edge is going not only for the

challenge, but also ‘‘just for

Cadets receive instruction during a field training exercise.

fun.’”’ Cadet junior Tom Gillan
hopes that Army experience
will made him a marketable
commodity in the business
world.

And yet, even with all its op-
portunities and_ benefits,
R.O.T.C. cadets do see that
there are problems as well.
Some are bothered by the enor-
mous amount of “red tape”
they expect to find and ques-
tionable regulations that must
be followed.

A major concern among a few
is having to do petty projects
designed to keep a large peace-

time army busy, and almost all ~

are aware of difficulties that
they will probably encounter
with an all volunteer Army.
Most are not very disturbed
about these problems, however,
because they would expect to
find similar ones in any profes-
sion.

In recent years the R.O.T.C.
department at Washington and
Lee has successfully maintain-
ed a low profile in contrast with
military programs at other
schools.

Students here generally feel
that this is the best approach,
particularly with a_ strong
military school like VMI as a
neighbor.

Unlike VMI, there are no
drills, no uniforms or short hair-
cuts; instead, the R.O.T.C.
Department sponsors a large
number of activities open to the
student body such as rapelling,
spelunking, backpacking and
orienteering, which all cadets
consider one of the strong points
of the program here.

One criticism seen by
R.0.T.C. cadets is that the in-
structors normally only remain
for three year periods, and
many feel this effects the con-
tinuity of the overall program.

However, most say they are
more than satisfied with the ex-
isting program, and some
believe that the ‘‘low key’’ ap-

proach is the only way that the
R.O.T.C. could survive on a
campus like W&L. ~

Although all the R.O.T.C,
juniors and_ seniors. see
numerous benefits and ad-
vantages with military science
of some type, very few consider
mading the Army into a career.

For some, the money is just
not enough, and for others,
there are different careers
which they would rather pur-
sue. However, many believe
they would like to remain in the
Reserves indefinitely, like
Cadet Senior Doug Barton who
called it ‘‘the best part-time job
you can get.”

The Reserves offer many of
the same opportunities and
benefits of active duty except
that the time commitment is not
very demanding and W&L
R.O.T.C. cadets find this ar-
rangement particularly appeal-
ing.

But no matter how long they
plan to stay in the Army, or
what their career goals may be,
all seem to agree that the Army
offers challenge and leadership
prospects unusual for someone
just out of college.

of Pigs. Valeriane has also
traveled over 400,000 miles
covering Henry Kissinger.

Despite his opening vow not to
simply criticize the President’s
foreign policy, most of
Valeriane’s comments were
critical of the Carter Ad-
ministration’s policy, or the
lack thereof.

“The president has learned
how not to pull troops out of
South Korea. how not to pass a
strategic arms limitation trea-
ty, how to be nice to Cuba and
Viet Nam and get nothing in
return and the merits of in-

consistency,’’ Valeriani said.

According to Valeriane,
Carter’s early policy stressed
an international “good feeling.”’

Carter set out to change the
“lone ranger’”’ image of foreign
policy established by Henry
Kissinger during the Nixon
years.

Carter initially took a hard
stance in favor of human rights,
reduction of the sale of

weapons, and was_ against
nuclear proliferation, said
Valeriane.

But the realities of world
power have caused the Presi-
dent to back off from his hard
line on these issues. The result

 

The News

There’s a new twist to armed
robbery.

An armed man wearing a
black stocking mask entered a
Bakersfield, Calif., 7-Eleven
store and successfully tied up
the lone employee and left him
in the cold storage locker.

Then the robber pulled off his
mask and waited on customers
for 20 minutes. He even told in-
vestigating police officers that
the report of a robbery in pro-
gress was wrong. After the
commotion had died down and
the police had left, the robber
did too, with $86 — $29 of which
he had collected in sales while
manning the register.

Marriage

An ad in the Willamette, Ore.,
newspaper read: “I will pay $
for any avail. female willing to
marry me. No sex.”’ The box
number accompanying the ad
belongs to an inmate at Oregon
State Penitentiary. The inmate
is taking college courses inside
the prison and the Veterans Ad-
ministration will pay him an ex-
tra $59 a month if he’s married.

Swim Team
Hosts

Davidson

The Washington and Lee
swim team continues a five-
meet homestand this weekend
when the squad hosts Davidson
College on Friday and Towson
State on Saturday. Meet time is
4p.m. Friday, 2 p.m. Saturday.

The Generals will seek their
first dual meet win in the
events, having suffered an 82-29
set-back to George Washington
University last Friday to fall to
0-4 on the year.

Several W&L swimmers are
included in the American Swim-
ming Coaches Association col-
lege division national time
rankings released last week.

Sophomore Mike Bernot is
listed in two events: fourth in
the 100 freestyle event, in which
he has qualified for the NCAA
Division III nationals, and
seventh in the 200 free.
Classmate Herb Gresens is
ranked 10th in the 1000 free.

Senior and captain Bob
Newcomb is listed 10th in the
500 free. W&L’s 400 free relay
team, composed of Bernot,
Gresens, Newcomb, and Ken
Johnstone is 7th.

In Brief

(VA pays single students $311
a month and married students
$370.)

“We don’t question why a
man gets marreid,” said the
local VA director.

The inmate says he’s willing
to pay some woman up to $250
and a three-year contract. He’ll
even pay for the divorce.

Recruiting

Patrick A. Pitts has been get-
ting Marine Corps recruiting
brochures for the last six
months, which wouldn’t be so
unusual if he weren’t 14 months
old.

Not only has young Patrick
been on the mailing list since
last May, he even got a call a
while back from a man who
identified himself as a
recruiter.

The boy’s parents say they
didn’t sign their young son up
for the service. A Marine Corps
spokesman explained that
sometimes. practical jokers
mail in recruiting forms with
someone else’s name and ad-
‘dress.

Justice

Old-fashioned justice return-
ed to a North Carolina court-
room when two teenaged boys
were given a choice of whipp-
ings or five days in jail.

One boy got his belts from his
grandmother right there in
court. The other was sent home
with a promise from his parents
that he would get his, but in
more private surroundings.

They had pleaded guilty to
resisting arrest in a case involv-
ing throwing fireworks and
stealing $20 worth of gasoline.

has been the projection of
Carter as an inept leader.
“Carter has become the
Rodney Dangerfield of interna-
tional politics,” said Valeriane.
Valeriane believes that
Carter cannot project an image
of being in control of foreign
policy and sometimes his own
administration.

“Sometimes a_ perception
becomes a reality,” said
Valeriane.

People perceive Carter as
“inept, ineffective and _ in-
competent,” Valeriane said.
The best example, he said,
was Carter’s relations with
Iran.

At one point early in Carter’s |

‘term, the President embraced
the Shah in public.

Yet while the President was
supporting the Shah in public,
the White House sent am-
biguous notes to the monarch
about’ relations between
tion,” Valeriane said.

The Ring-tum Phi, January 17, 1980, Page 11

America and Iran.

The problem became worse
when the skeleton embassy
staff was taken hostage and the
President did not take im-
mediate action, according to
Valeriane.

Admitting the Shah into the
United States and then sending
him to another country com-
pounded the problem, said
Valeriane.

“The Administration made a
policy then changed its position
under political pressure,’’said
Valeriane.

“The result is that the pro-
blem is the same now as it was
the day the hostages were taken
captive.”’

The Soviet Union is taking a
verbal tongue lashing from the
world community, Valeriane
said, but the Soviets expected
the reaction and knew the
President would not take im-
mediate action.

“They knew what they were
doing and calculated the reac-

Afghanistan has jolted the
President and his advisers into
a more realistic view of world

politics, the reporter said.

“My view is that we should
move the olympic games,”
Valeriane said.’’That would hit
them where it hurts, it would be
a sign of international hostility
and would deny the Russians an
aura of respectability.”

Valeriane contends the pro-
blem with the United States’
foreign policy is a lack of direc-
tion from the top.

“President Carter has not
been convincing in his foreign
policy, we have no clear con-
cept of it and no vision of where
it is going to take us,’’ said
Valeriane.

The consensus in Washington
on Carter’s foreign policy is
that it is ‘amateurish and in-
ept,” he said.

Yet Valeriane predicted that
Carter’s foreign policy may be
reborn or clarified when the
President gives his State of the
Nation speech.

Valeriane concluded his for-
mal speech saying, ‘‘Domestic
policy can hurt a president,
foreign policy can kill him.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Cheap Shots

No matter what your opinions are about the so-
called boxwood incident, it is not difficult to let your
emotions rise in the matter of Tuesday night’s
rematch basketball game against Hampden-Sydney
College.

In case you haven't heard yet, the Generals lost the
game—by a four-point margin. But it’s what happen-
ed during the game that should really irk you, maybe
even stir your blood a little.

You see, the Hampden-Sydney supporters ap-
parently travelled all the way to their new gym just to
try to humiliate our team in the most base manner:
they wore branches from boxwood bushes in their
hair and threw them at our team during a time-out in
the second half as a not-so-subtle reminder of the un-
fortunate incident here before Christmas.

The H-SC boys also had banners up to heckle our
team: ‘‘Farrell and Hoy—Nice Boxwoods, Nice Cap-
tains, Nice Team, Nice Institution” and ‘‘Save Box-
woods, Kill Minks.”’ But despite it all, our team han-
dled all the pressure with a lot of poise.

They even had their own raunchy little cheer to go
with the bush waving—B-U-S-H. Now that cheer pret-
ty much sums up our sentiments and the feelings of a
number of people in our sports department. If their
ever was a classless act, the H-SC basketball fans
Tuesday night outperformed it hands down.

Hampden-Sydney’s athletic director was at the
game, but made no attempt to quiet or control the ac-
tions of the crowd, although he did apologize to Coach
Canfield after the game.

W&L fans can be just as ugly and debasing. But we
hope our fans will not try to underclass the ’necks
from southern Virginia. In that respect, W&L
students have a lot to be proud of. Our basketball
team handled the pressure with a lot of poise.

The H-SC boys don’t aim very high—they aim about
groin level—but they kick hard. So congratulations to
all the Hampden-Sydney boys who were there Tues-
day. You all get the Ring-tum Phi’s cheap shot of the
month award for Most Unsportsman-Like Behavior.
You won it with no dissenting votes.

If that’s what they learn in Farmville, then we’re
damn glad we came to Lexington.

Crisis For Freedom And Integrity

To The Editor:

After essentially two decades of waning
American respect internationally, we now find
ourselves at a trial point in which terrorists such
as the ayatollah and outlaws such as Soviet Russia
are measuring our integrity as U.S. citizens. With
the new decade ahead, I find myself wondering
whether we can possibly withstand the current
position our government maintains on avoiding, at
almost endless cost, rather than controlling
foreign crises.

The causes are evident. For over two months
America has been held hostage in Tehran, with
ever more irrational demands. New links are con-
tinually being added to the chain of Russian ag-
gession and oppression in Europe. What are the ef-
fects?

For the past few months the effects have been

. reviewed through the eyes of the Ayatollah Kho-

meini. Thus far he has not overstepped his image
of the United States as a nation too feeble to place
its own ideals as a free country over those of ter-
rorist and outlaw nations.

Our trial is not without end, however, and the
verdict of the jury is for we as Americans to
decide. We are in a position to determine our own
future, just as those were 204 years ago who wrote
down their ideals of freedom and integrity in the
form of a constitution. It is these two ideals which
are now on trial.

Are we to fulfill, as we recently have, our image
as a nation steeped with decadence and sheepish
leadership? I only hope and pray not.

Persiflage

Dear Sir,

I was shocked that your last issue did not include
the reaction from either myself or my brethern. I
though that it was standard journalistic practice
to get statements from all the principal actors par-

ty to an incident. Either this is a misconception on ,

my part or another example of shoddy reporting
on the bchalf of you and your staff.

Your last issue did not even try to present our
feelings on the past tragedy. Instead, all you had
were articles dealing with the administration, the
basketball team, and the disgruntled heirs to the
‘‘Weeks Estate.’’ At no time was there any effort
to explain our point of view.

We are the ones who have experienced the
greatest sense of loss in this incident. We are the
ones who have lost friends and neighbors to this
brutal slaughter. We are the ones who must stand
a lonely vigil over our fallen brothers. But did
anyone spare us sympathy? Did anyone come to
console the relatives of those who died defending

The Forgotten Fallen Brothers

- For the liberties which we now enjoy,
Americans have had to make decisions similar to

_ those which we now face; and they have lived up

to their heritage as a nation founded on individual
freedom and integrity. Our decisions are again
difficult but quite evident. If we continue to avoid
and accomplish nothing, as we have done, then the
decision has already been made. Our only other
choice is to act, not simply to react, to gain again
respect internationally and a new self respect na-
tionally. The risk is great in either option, and the
loss or gain is equally enormous.

As a nation, and as individuals, we must decide
if the risk in acting is worth the consequences of
the slow decay of our ancestral base. For me, they
are, and I grow more concerned daily that we may
have already decided on our former option.

Am I alone?

Reacting To ‘Foolish Rhetoric’

Dear Editor,

After reading Tony Carli’s
statements in ‘Mocking the
Choice of Senator Goldwater for
the Convention,” I must react to
some of his foolish rhetoric.

One of the major strengths of
the American two-party system
is the diversity of each respec-
tive party. Senator Goldwater is
a major exponent ‘of the
Republican conservative point
of view. Republican Senator
Javits of New York is more
liberal than many Democratic
politicians.

Surely to the dismay of Tony
Carli, the American populace is
everyday embracing a more
conservative attitude. Witness
the popularity of proposition 13
and the general rejection of
sixties-style big spending pro-
gram’s such as Kennedy’s
socialist health care program,
as evidence of such. The Tony
Carli ‘‘we can save the world”’
brand liberalism should have
died with the sixties. Former
President Richard M. Nixon’s
political views are on the re-
bound.

When one reads the opinion
polls, one finds Teddy’s
mindless utterings are beginn-
ing to affect his popularity.
Carter’s popularity is rising,
due to his firm conservative
handling of the tense Iranian

On The Rally

Mixing Emotional Reactions

Imagine, if you will, the
following dilemma. It is 1938. A
middle-aged German man who
has been a bartender in the
American embassy for many
years, and who has formed
many American friendships,
decides that he abhors the
direction his country is taking.
He leaves behind the familiar to
immigrate to America — the
land which he feels will offer
him freedom, hope, and an en-
vironment which nurtures
humanism, not hatred. Under-
standably, anti-German senti-
ment runs high in his newly-

situation. Ronald Reagan’s ap-
peal is holding. This country
must not make a_ similar
mistake to 1964.

The blind obedience to ex-
treme liberal doctrines will be
the downfall of Kennedy. This is
the factor most affecting his
slide in the polls. It’s amazing
how the blind lead the blind to
slaughter.

I refer Tony Carli to Victor
Laskey’s It Didn’t Start With
Watergate. As a matter of fact,
I'll loan him my copy. Nixon’s

policy of detente has allowed
some benefits, such as SALT I.
Appeasement, no; brilliant,
yes. SALT II is appeasement,
the bastardization of a fine
policy.

Tony admits that liberal
Democrats are fewer in
number. I hope I have
demonstrated a few reasons
why. As for the possible election
of Ted Kennedy, we’ll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

MD Dance-A-Thon

Dear Students:
Once again Washington and
Lee’s annual Muscular

Dystrophy Dance-A-Thon is
upon us. The plans and events
for this year are set to go. Un-
doubtedly we are much more
organized than we were last
year.

But we still have a problem.
We need guys to dance!! There
are a lot of registration forms
out that have not been returned.
If you plan to dance, these
registration forms (the white
sheets in the information
packet) must be returned to
Carole Chappell in the Universi-
ty Center by Wednesday the
23rd of January. We need to
know how many people are go-
ing to dance so that the final ar-
rangements can be made re-
garding food for the dancers.

We think that it is now time to
explain exactly where the
money goes that is donated to a
dancer. There has been some
debate on this issue and we
would like to clear up some
misunderstandings.

First of all, Muscular
Dystrophy Association is the se-
cond lowest (Red Cross is the
first) organization in terms of
salaries and management. Only
3.2 cents out of every dollar
goes towards someone’s salary.
That alone is a very impressive
figure.

Next, 13.3 cents of every

dollar goes towards what is
known as fund-raising. This
helps support dance-a-thons
such as ours all across the na-
tion. It takes a great deal of
money to start a dance-a-thon
which the Muscular Dystrophy
Association provides on a loan
basis.

The last chunk of the pie, a
phenomenal 83.5 cents goes
directly to patient services.
This includes research, medical
services, clinics, summer
camps, professional education
and public education (pam-
phiets etc. ).

There is no trying to hide
where each dollar goes; in fact
we are quite proud of it. If
anyone wants more detailed in-
formation contact Carole Chap-
pell in the University Center.

So that’s where it goes. Our
goal this year is $15,000, but it
will be very difficult to reach. It
can be reached but only with the
help of people like you; danc-
ing. We think enough has been
said about the material benefits
of dancing in the thirty-hour
event. If you are going to dance
it must be in your heart. So have
a heart, help us search for the
cure and please ‘‘dance for
those who can’t.”’

Thank you

Readers React To The Anti-Iranian Rally

Professor
Ashamed Of
‘Lynch Mob’

Dear Sirs:

This morning’s Roanoke
paper reports, ‘“‘Screaming mob
at W&L protests Iranian ac-
tions.”’ The headline is an
understatement, if anything,
for it is also reported, ‘Later,
about 200 students marched on
Virginia Military Institute,
where nine Iranians attend
classes.”’

If this is not the first instance,
surely it is the most serious
manifestation of Lynch Mob
Mentality, associated as always
with Cowardice, in the history
of the University. In striking
contrast, the students in atten-
dance in December of 1941 exer-
cised the restraint and acted
with the courage expected of de-
cent persons.

While it is to be hoped that the
newspaper account is exag-
gerated, it matters little. A
Lynch Mob is a Lynch Mob is a
Lynch Mob whether its objec-
tive is intimidation or a
stringing-up to a limb of the
nearest tree.

Was Key To The Rally

Sirs,

I was rather disappointed at
the predominantly deprecatory
attitude taken by the press con-
cerning the Anti-Iran rally held
December 4th and the march,
which occurred shortly there-
after, through the streets of
Lexington. I was especially
dismayed that the Ring-tum
Phi’s editorial staff was the
leading source of disapproval.
Evidently those who wrote the
“‘opinions’’ were not present at
the rally. Either that, or they
sadly misinterpreted the event.

The key word in interpreting
the affair is Nationalism. The
pervading atmosphere at both
the rally and the march was one
of pride and unity, the cause
and effect of Nationalism. Na-
tionalism has served a vital role
throughout history in strength-
ening nations in times of trou-
ble. The feeling of American
pride, the Nationalism, did
much to unite the students of
Washington and Lee on that
Tuesday evening. Joining in one
the epithets against Iran were
both Southern students and Nor-
thern students. Joining in on the
several renditions of ‘“The Star-
Spangled Banner” were both
Democratic students and
Republican students. Chanting
for the release of the American
hostages in Iran as well as for
the release of Steve Johnson in
the police station were both
liberal students and conser-
vative students. The collabora-
tion of rival fraternities was a
further manifestation of the
rampant Nationalism ex-
perienced by all that night. The
rally and parade dissolved, for
a while, the ancient, rigid divi-
sions that have long plagued
W&L student body unity.

Albeit, mob action often gets
out of hand and does more evil
than good. However, Tuesday’s
occurrence did no ‘‘tangible’’
destruction (nor was it ever in-

tended to do so). A definite
alternative to the possible
destruction that does often oc-
cur with the emergence of a
mob is the simultaneous rising
of a charismatic leader who can
grasp the situation and in-
stigate the actions it requires.
This idea makes it ever so clear
how important the the up-and-
coming election is.

One of the editorials voiced its
disappointment that “‘one of the
finer liberal arts institutions in
the country” could drop as low
as any other university. A
‘recognition’ of responsibility,
it was said, is necessary to
those “lucky enough to be ex-
posed to higher education.”
Another recognition, which the
editorial seemed to miss, is one
of utmost importance at this
time of American turmoil: a
recognition that this country is
on the verge (if it has not yet
fallen) of a crisis which can be
altered only by a united nation.
Tuesday’s rally, and others like
it, although minute and localiz-
ed in its and their effects, was a
step in that direction.

Sincerely,
Fred Welden Caudill III

6 2 3
Opinion
Dear Sir:

In your reporting of Washing-
ton and Lee’s anti-Iran rally,
your editorial on the same and
particularly your Opinion piece,
you seem to have confused two
issues: a rally designed to show
support for America ina time of
crisis and a march that was a
result of mob action, of emo-
tions easily sparked, rather
than a planned consequence of
the rally. This distinction must
be made, for I imagine that if
the organizers of the rally had
had a chance to finish their
speeches, you might have heard
what is being echoes at forums
across the nation and in the
halls of Congress: support for
America, endorsement of Presi-
dent Carter’s handling thus far
of the crisis, and the sentiment
that while this country stands
for peace, it stands for peace
with horor and peace through
strength, a challenge we are
willing and able to meet.

At first President Carter ask-
ed for restraint form the na-
tion’s leaders; now he is asking
for a show of unity. At no time
has he asked for a stifling of the
opinion of the American people,
and you are criticizing some of
your peers for trying to give
theirs.

There is a difference between
the expression of opinion and
rabble rousing. I suggest you
are too quick to judge those who
were not heard. What would you
be saying, I wonder, if the rally
had not degenerated under out-
side influences and speeches
had indeed been given and even
finished? What if, then, as a
symbolic gesture, an Iranian
flag had been burned? Remem-
ber, ours has recently been used
to carry out garbage. What is
wrong with students, so often
accused these days of selfish-
ness and lack of purpose, wan-
ting to speak out in defense of
our national honor and price?

I further submit that the
‘Rights of Others,”’ as you so
entitled Opinion, were not for a
moment a target of the rally’s
organizers. I wonder how you
ever got that idea, unless you
simply jumped to a conclusion.

More Letters To The Editor

Disputing Dash Review

Editor:

I usually do not write ‘‘Let-
ters to the Editor’ but the
movie review in the December 6
issue of the RTP was.....

I respect Dash Coufal and his
opinions (after all, we both sur-
vived the R.E. Lee Hotel last
year), but his assessment of
‘Apocalypse Now”’ was a little
off base, through no fault of his
own. He wasn’t there — how
lucky he is! Books and movies
can project but can compensate
for first hand experience.

“Apocalypse Now”’ was very
realistic in the Vietnam portion
of the movie—the attention to
detail was accurate. Yes, peo-
ple did go water skiing and have
beach parties. When you might
be dead tomorrow, why not
make the most of today? After a
hard (and hot!) conflict with
the enemy, what could be more
refreshing than a dip in the
river or a cold brew? This may
sound bizarre today, but in a
“live today, die tomorrow’’ at-
mosphere, it was a very ra-
tional philosophy. If only we
had had road trips and Duck’s
to boost our spirits...

The Cambodian portion of the
film was very surrealistic—
mind blowing—contrived, etc.
Coppola wanted to make a

definitive statement on the hor-
rors of war and he certainly
succeeded.

Having been attached to 173d
Airborne on numerous occa-
sions, and frequently stationed
at LZ English (remember the
scene in the mobile home?), I
can’t really take Dash to task
for his review. He wasn’t
there—and it would be great if
no other W&L students have
similar experiences in the
future.

Sincerely,
Flamer

Bookstore
Overcharge

Dear Sirs:

The Bookstore wants to
return an overcharge to a stu-
dent. We, wrongly, charged him
$3.00 too much for a copy of Cost
Accounting. He will remember
when I made the change in
price.

If he will come to see me I will
give him both the money and
our abject apologies.

Book Lists Summer

Employment Possibilities

Over 15 million students and
teachers will want summer jobs
in 1980. Many have started look-
ing already, but even those who
begin early may find jobs much
harder to come by this year
than last. Higher unemploy-
ment has made competition for
all jobs tighter than ever this
year.

If you’re looking for a sum-
mer job, there’s still a shortcut
way to find one. That’s with the
help of the 1980 Summer
Employment Directory of the
United States (Writer’s Digest
Books: $6.95), an annual hand-
book that lists employers with
over 57,000 job openings.

 

This year’s version of the an-
nual directory lists 900 summer
employers: amusement parks,
summer camps, national parks,
private resorts, summer
theaters, office temporaries,
marketing and sales organiza-
tions — literally everybody who
hires summer workers.

Foreign Policy Problems Discussed

to strengthen NATO forces and
has been behind increases in the
defense budget. Corddry con-
ceded that there will be time in
the upcoming years when the
United States will be militarily
inferior to the Soviet Union in
many respects. Corddry quoted
New York Senator Jacob Javits
saying that, “‘it looks like we’ve
been goofing off for the last ten
years.”’

Corddry said that for several
political reasons, a_ policy
change as fundamental as
reinstatement of the draft is not

imminent.

The armed forces, though
having difficulty recruiting per-
sons to fill the jobs most needed,
are still within three percent of
their overall recruitment goals.
Within a margin that close, the
draft is not a necessary
measure, Corddry said.

Also, with an election ap-
proaching, it is unlikely that
President Carter or the Con-
gress will want to initiate
anything as controversial as the
draft. “If Carter can’t get
together with the Congress on
something as ——— as gas ra-

tioning, how could he get them
to pass the draft?” Corddry
said.

The journalist noted,
however, that some work is go-
ing to have to be done to
strengthen the reserve forces.

Corddry concluded by saying
that the competition between
the United States and the Soviet
Union is more than a struggle
between two world powers.
“The competition,” Corddry
said, “is between values and

systems and cannot be treated
lightly.”

Team Uncovers

 

Ancient Indian

Hunting. Site

by John Hastings

The residents of Lebanon,
Va., will soon have a new water
filtration plant and they can
partially thank Washington and
Lee University.

During the last week in
December and the first week in
January over a dozen students,
alumni and faculty of Washing-
ton and Lee went to Lebanon to
excavate and authenticate what
appeared to be an Indian hun-
ting camp. The site is on Big
Cedar Creek in Russell County,
and is ideal both for hunting and
for a water treatment site, ac-
cording to Anthropology
Department intern Parker Pot-
ter.

In accordance with federal
law, any site or proposed con-
struction involving federal or
state funding must be ar-
chaeologically surveyed before
construction is allowed.
Lebanon solicited bids for the
project and received only one
other besides Washington and
Lee's. The bid came from the
Iroquois Research Institute
headquartered in Fairfax.

Although not officially disclos- 9
ed, Iroquios’s bid was
estimated at between eee

 

 

$30,000-$60,000. Washington and

EC Pres. Reprimands Poole

by John G. Billmyre

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Steve Abraham and Junior
Representitive Bruce Poole
argued during Monday night’s
EC meeting about the role
Poole has played this year as an
ad hoc member to the Student

Control Committee, the elected _

student self-discipline body.
The argument followed
Poole’s answer to one question
and before his response to a se-
cond one from a reporter.
In response to the first ques-

_ Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Alpha Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national
leadership society founded on
the campus in 1914, initiated 26
new student members in the an-
nual ‘‘tapping’’ ceremonies
held Friday. The group includes
six third-year law students, 14
undergraduate seniors and six
undergraduate juniors.

Students are elected to OD}
by a vote of the “circlef
(chapter’s) current memife
ship, composed of studen | i
itiated in previous years, fa
ty and administrators. Crit
for election include outstand
scholarship and _ extrac\y
ricular involvement in a varia

   

vices, student government and
journalism, and the creative
and performing arts.

ODK now has circles on more
than 160 college campuses
across the nation, and induction
to the oldest chapter is regard-
ed as one of the highest honore
Washington and Lee bestows

 

upon its student leaders. Among and track teams,

tion, Poole said that he stopped
voting on Student Control Com-
mittee cases after Abraham
told the SCC ‘I don’t think that
it is proper for any ad hoc
member to vote on student com-

mittees because the EC
members are there in an ad-
visory role.”’

* Abraham made the comment
to the SCC during a brief inter-
mission in the boxwoods case.
At that time he said Poole, who

sat on the SCC last year, agreed ~

with him.

that he mentioned the subject
only as a point of clarification;
Poole has said twice during the

after Abraham spoke to the
committee.

bring up the subject two weeks
ago.

The end result was a motion,
proposed by Jay Blumberg,
that, “‘EC members act in an
advisory capacity and not vote
in any decision.”

At that time Abraham said
there had not been any com-
plaints about EC members
voting on subcommittees, but
that the matter had come to his
attention.

Poole disagreed with
Abraham’s accusation and
said, ‘‘I’d like to see you find
somebody that would say I

_ voted after you talked to the

SCC.”

Abraham said that he would
find people to support his claim.

Poole criticized the SCC for
not notifying him about all
meetings.

“Tim Brooks has not notified
me of all meetings, but I got on
him about that,’’ said Poole.
Tim Brooks is President of the
SCC,

Poole also praised Brooks for
his leadership on the SCC say-
ing, ‘‘the meetings are well run
and the committee has handled
some tough cases.”’

Other ad hoc members to sub-
committees also _ leveled
criticism at their subcom-
mittees.

Jay Blumberg criticized the
Student Activities Board for the
way it runs its meetings.

“The meetings are run like a
circus, they are very unorganiz-
ed and there could be some im-
provement,’’ Blumberg said.

SAB Co-Chairman Bill Ridge
was on hand to defend his com-
mittee, but only seemed to
make matters worse for
himself.

Ariel Cost
Could Have
Been Halved

The Publications Board
learned last Thursday night
that the first edition of Ariel
which cost $1,450, and was
printed at the Lexington News-
Gazette, could have cost $700 if
it had been printed at the
Washington and Lee print shop.

The startling revelation was
made by former Ring-tum Phi
editor M. Gray Coleman, who
said it took him 20 minutes to
find a lower price than that
given by the News-Gazette.

“You got ripped off,”’ said
Coleman to Ariel Editor Chris
Faye.

As a result of the incident,
which was initiated by Jay
Blumberg, Senior Represen-
tative to the Executive Commit-
tee, during an EC meeting, the
Publications. Board voted to
find a business manager for the
Ariel.

Several members of the EC
who criticized the Ariel during
an EC meeting last week were
on hand to comment to the
Publications Board.

At the EC meeting earlier in
the week, Faye told that Com;
mittee the magazine was going
to cost $1,582.90, or nearly two-
thirds of the total Ariel budget.

But Faye later informed the
Publications Board and the EC
that the magazine was going to
cost $1,450.

He presented the EC with a
bill for $1,582.90, from which a
$132.90 credit had been sub-
tracted. Faye said the credit
came from the News-Gazette
because the final bill was larger
than the initial News-Gazette
estimation.

IFC News

Fijis Fined For Pledge

by Ross Newell

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council slapped
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
with over four weeks social pro-
bation for conducting fraternity
pledging activities in violation
of IFC rules.

During a meeting Monday
night, the IFC placed Fiji- on
two weeks social probation for
informal initiation rites which
violated the council’s definition
of hazing. Another two weeks
probation resulted from having
pledges at a fraternity after 8
p.m., which violates a rule
established by the IFC last
year. The incident occurred last
Thursday night, Jan. 17.

The IFC defines hazing as
“any possible activity that
might possibly cause physical
or emotional harm to pledges.’’
The rites included having the
pledges drink a mixture of
tomato juice and tabasco sauce
and asking them to climb a tree

 

General William Westmoreland

   

in front of the Fiji house to sing.
While the pledges were in the
tree, upperclassmen dumped
buckets of water on them from
the roof of the fraternity.

Syd Farrar, IFC president,
said that climbing the tree
violated hazing rules because of
the possiblility that a pledge
might fall and hurt himself.

However, Jerry L. Broccoli,
president of Fiji, emphasized to
the IFC that all of the initiation
activities were voluntary. He
said that upperclassmen ap-
plied no pressure to participate
and that some pledges decided
not to participate in certain ac-
tivities.

Under a rule implemented
last year, fraternities cannot re-
quire pledges to be at the frater-
nity house after 8 p.m. on a
school night.

Broccoli said that the
freshmen were not required to
be at the initiation ceremony
and were told to complete their

Westmoreland To Lecture
On Directions For

General William Westmore-
land will speak in Lee Chapel
Tuesday, Jan. 29 at 8 p.m. He is
the second speaker to be spon-
sored by the Contact committee
this year.

In conjunction with Contact’s
theme of “American Foreign
Policy Directions for the
1980’s,’” Gen. Westmoreland
will focus on U.S. defense
posture and the changes he sees
for the future.

A veteran of over 36 years of
military service, Gen. West-
moreland has played an active
role in every U.S. military in-
volvement from the invasion of
the Normandy beaches to Viet-

nam.

homework before they came.
He said that if he had known
about the rule, the activities
would have been scheduled to
end at 8 p.m.

The freshmen arrived at the
house about 9 p.m., Broccoli
said, and left at about 10:30.
that night.

The incident came to the
IFC’s attention when IFC
secretary Sam Perkins learned
that a freshman ‘“‘had to be at
the house” at 9 p.m. When he
arrived at the fraternity, the
pledges and upperclassmen
were leaving the front yard and
entering the house. As he was
talking to Broccoli the fresh-
men were returned to the dor-
mitories, Perkins said.

The social probation started
Tuesday and will end on Feb.
27.

Farrar also said that the Fi-
ji’s are required to participate
in a community service project.
For two Saturdays, he said,

He served as Commander of
the U.S. Military Forces in Viet-
nam as well as Army Chief of
Staff, the Army’s highest posi-
tion. He retired from military
service in 1972.

A reception for Gen. West-
moreland will be held at the
Sigma Chi fraternity house at 5
p.m. Tuesday. There will also
be a gathering following the
General’s speech in Fairfax

The ‘80s

Lounge for persons interested
in attending.

In the next few weeks, Con-
tact ‘80 will continue its sym-
posium on U.S. Foreign Rela-
tions with speeches by Robert

mittee.

civil-rights leader Stokely Car-
michael to the campus Monday
(Jan. 28) for a public lecture in
Lee Chapel beginning at 8 p.m.

Carmichael, a prominent
figure in the black activist

 

movements since the early
1960’s, will offer an assessment
of social change in America
during the past decade and a

In another matter, the
Judicial Board recommended
that two student involved in a
snowball fight between mem-
bers of Fiji and Pi Kappa Alpha
be dealt with by the Student
Control Committee.

The incident took place dur-
ing the first week of classes
after the Christmas holiday.
Two Fijis were throwing snow-
balls at the PiKa house, and
windows were broken.

The PiKas threw snowballs
back at them and one member,
Chris Greatwood, fired a BB
gun at the Fijis. One of the BB
pellets hit a member of Fiji in
the shoulder and he and another

2 Cars Vandalized

“I got in the car and saw
there was glass all over the
dash and the windshield was
bashed in.” Stewart Hinckley
was shocked when he came
back from a party at 4 p.m. Sun-
day to find that someone had
jumped on his 1978 Firebird and
kicked in the windshield.

The vandal struck Hinckley’s
car, parked along Lee Avenue
across from the Sigma Chi
house, at approximately 1 a.m.

water, parked on Washington

Hinckley said the culprit was
wearing about a size 10 tennis
shoe (possibly Nike brand) and
had left an imprint on the hood
of the car. The same person ap-
parently did damage to both
cars.

The repairs to Hinkley’s car
will cost $115. Hinckley said he
would not press charges if the
offender turns himself in.
Drinkwater said he would also
be willing to compromise.

‘With all those people

Police are investigating the
incidents.

UVa Student

Arrested For

SPE House
Damage

by Richard Moss
A University of Virginia stu-
dent has been arrested and
charged in connection with a
paint-throwing incident at the
Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity
house early Sunday morning.

' The student, John E. Thorn-
ton, of Charlottesville, Va., was
arrested at 2:20 p.m. on
January 20, and charged with
giving false information to a
police officer and destroying
private property.

According to Tom Gillen, a
SPE member, the incident
began when five students came
into the house claiming that
they were members of the Rich-
mond University and Virginia
Commonwealth University SPE
chapters.

After they left the house, ‘‘one
of them threw paint on the front
door,’’ Gillen said. It was then
that SPE members “got in a
scuffle” with the other students.
“The fight was broken up when
two police cars pulled up,”
Gillen stated.

The police then took the sup-
posed Richmond U. and VCU
students, along with four SPE
members, to the police station
and charged Thornton, ac-
cording to Gillen.

EC On SAB, Contact, The Pub Board

(continued from page 1)
Blumberg toid the EC that the

SAB gets things done despite its

disorganization.

‘‘The meetings are
disorganized, there are so many
reports and committees that
often a lot of things don’t
mesh,’’ said Ridge in defense of
the SAB meetings.

But Senior Representative
Dee Keesler suggested that the
size of the SAB demanded more
organization.

‘‘What we need to get done we
do get done,”’ said Ridge, who
promised to improve .the
meetings.

Ridge also said the Ad-
ministration ‘‘screwed us’’ by
barring alumni from Fancy
Dress.

‘‘Fancy Dress is going to cost
more and we are going to have
one-third less people without
the alumni,”’ explained Ridge.

Abraham asked Ridge how
much the SAB made on Fancy
Dress last year and EC
Secretary Cove Geary said, ‘‘I
remember during debate that it
was brought up that the Fancy
Dress budget is figured up
without the alumni.”

Ridge said he thought Geary
was mistaken and estimated
the cost of Fancy Dress to be
$24-25,000. He said tickets will
cost $20 and that the SAB ex-
pected to sell approximately
1,700 tickets.

Fraser pointed out that Fancy
Dress would raise about $34,000,
a surplus of $10,000.

Junior Representative Bob
Willis asked Ridge why the SAB
did not have a sheet of paper
budgeting cost for this year’s
Fancy Dress Ball.

“It seems like before you
went in you should have a
balance sheet of how much you
are going tospend,”’ Willis said.

Ridge said he would report
back to the EC next week when

he will have all the facts and .

figures on the Ball.

Contact was also criticized by
some members who requested
that the Contact Co-chairmen
appear before the EC next week
to investigate the selection pro-
cess for members of the Contact
Committee.

The EC is acting on a letter
from a student who applied to
the Contact co-chairmen and
never got a reply.

“I think we should ask them,
(the co-chairmen) about the

selection process for the com-
mittee.”

The EC also requests in a let-
ter to the Co-chairmen, Chann-
ing Hall and Scott Cardoza, that
the two tell them the structure,
name, class, fraternity affilia-
tion and selection process for all
committee members.

Nelson Ould, Junior
Representative and ad hoc
member to Contact, questioned
the EC’s motives in the in-
vestigation. ‘‘It is as if we are
accusing them of favoritism,”
said Ould

Ould also made a suggestion,
with Senior Representative Dee
Keesler, that ‘‘Contact take a
student poll before it contacted
speakers.”’

“It concerns me that maybe
the chairmen make too many
decisions about speakers,”’ said
Ould.

The EC also discussed Con-
tact’s scheduling of speakers.
Professor Gunn, according to
Sophomore Representative,
Jim Wenke, ‘‘was concerned
that Contact was booking peo-
ple before checking the calen-
dar.”

Wenke said Gunn gave the
glut of speakers appearing on
campus and speaking on the
same topic last week as an ex-
ample.

“T don’t think that it is
anybody’s fault but Mr. Gunn’s
because he doesn’t call
meetings,’’ Dee Keesler said.

Ould explained that affairs of
interest come up suddenly, such
as the Afghanistan and Iranian
crises, and that Contact is try-
ing to include these affairs in a
coherent program.

Before discussion of Contact
was over, Fraser suggested
that Contact should establish a
list of priorities for speakers,
selecting speakers as they go
down the list.

The Publications Board also
drew fire from the EC.
Blumberg, Fraser and Poole
accused Pub Board President
Ben Keesee of trying to close
the last meeting, which dealt
with Ariel, before discussion
from the public was heard.

“What really bothered me
was that Ben tried to close out
the meeting before people made
comments,”’ said Poole. He ad-
ded that Keesee made people
‘feel like outsiders and that
their opinion was not wanted.”’

|

Poole also criticized Keesee
for holding the meeting in the
Cockpit.

Cove Geary defended
Keesee’s holding the meeting in
the Cockpit.

“This was the first time since
the Gallagher Lampoon issue
there was a reason to hold a pub

board meeting outside the
Cocknit ”’

Vyeapae.
=

Keesee, who attended the
meeting after the accusations
were made said, ‘There was
not an attempt to hide anything
from anybody; I wanted to
close it so the Secretary would
not have to record the conversa-
tion.”

Blumberg suggested that
Keesee model his committee

after the EC.

SS ee ee oe a

“If there was ever a commit-
tee which you should model
your meeting, it is this commit-
tee,’ said Blumberg. “It is a
better procedure to leave a
meeting open to entertain mo-
tions.”

The EC commended Jim
Vines for the job he has done
this year on the Cold Check

Committee

Entertainment

Fleetwood Mac & Pink Floyd

Artists Cut Double Albums

by Mark Kinniburg
The new year brings many
new albums and artists, and
behind each and everyone there
is a record company with a
great financial investment.

Unfortunately for the record
companies, record sales are at
a low that has been witnessed
- for the past year with only
slight deviations for The
Eagles, Doobie Brothers, and
Led Zeppelin.

Some artists have actually
been forced out of the record
business because of poor sales,
including Ace, Jesse Colin
Young, Peter Frampton, and
many smaller, lesser known ar-
tists, not to mention the literally
thousands of artists signed for a
single 45 r.p.m. release.

There are those, outside of the
losers, who are selling records
at a breakneck pace, and prob-
ably would if their albums were
even more expensive that the
$8.98 list price.

Pink Floyd’s latest, ‘The
Wall” and Fleetwood Mac’s
“Tusk” are two examples of
double album sets which are
and have been at the top of
retail movers since before
Christmas.

Pink Floyd has been produc-
ing quality experimental rock
for nearly a decade, and besides
their well known ‘‘Money,”’ they
have yet to go commercial.
“The Wall” is obviously not
meant as a sell-out to their
many fans from their other cult
albums, but it seems that there
is a more accessable mix on this
effort. The killer on this album
set is “Another brick in the
wall” a trilogy spaced through-
out the four sides with the
recurring refrain—‘‘We don’t
need no education...all in all

you’re just another brick in the
wall.”’ Along with Roger
Water’s social commentary we
see a musical side of Pink Floyd
mixed with technical ad-
vancements usually avoided by
less adventuresome recording
artists. Actually, new techni-
ques of master disc alteration
which didn’t even exist two
years ago, such as analog
delay, parametric equalization,
and oral ring modulation, are
all present on ‘The Wall.’’ The
result of the advanced tech-
nology and excellent songwrit-
ing talent produces an album
which is listenable and bound to
be a classic. Although introduc-
ed at a steep list price of $14.98,
“The Wall” is available through
discount record stores for a few
dollars less, and I’ll add it’s
worth it.

Fleetwood Mac needed a
followup for ‘Rumours’ with
the same potential for platinum
sales and airplay. The - two
record set of ‘‘Tusk” has proven
to be a powerful followup in
every sense despite the $15.98
retail price. Since last year’s
release, ‘“‘Tusk’’ has produced
no fewer than four top 40 singles
including “Tusk” and “Sara,”
with many more on the way for
the spring, summer and fall.
‘‘Tusk’”’ lacks all the lyrical
sophistication of Pink Floyd
and the album could have been
the outtakes of the recording
sessions of their first two
albums.

I quess what bothers me the
most about “‘Tusk”’ is it seems
geared to sell and produce more
revenue through singles
releases, based largely on the
reputation of Fleetwood Mac.
Sure, there are some good tunes
and some possible killers, but
nothing that couldn’t have fit in-
to a single album package. Not
surprisingly, as Warner

Pub Board Meeting

(continued from page 1)

At the Publications Board
meeting EC President Steve
Abraham criticized Faye’s
handling of funds and said,
“This off-the-wall figure is ir-
responsible to the student
body.’’

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg attacked Faye’s
handling of the Ariel and said,
“When the Publications Board

picks an editor, he should use
his money wisely.”’

Blumberg recommended the
Publications Board select a new
editor for the Ariel.

During Monday night’s EC
meeting Abraham said, “‘It
flabbergasts me that you came
in here and gave us a wrong
figure.”’

Faye apologized for the
mistake and said that it will not
happen again.

IFC Discusses Fight

(continued from page 2)

Fiji went into the PiKa house to
find the person firing the gun.

A fight ensued involving the
two Fijis and six or eight PiKas.
The PiKas involved said they
were trying to make the Fijis
leave the house.

The two Fijis then returned to
their fraternity and recruited
approximately 20 brothers to go
with them to the PiKa house.

Shortly after the Fijis reach-
ed the PiKa house, the police ar-
rived, answering a call from
PiKa Tom Goss. He said he had
received word that a group of
Fijis were on their way to the
PiKa house.

The police were called to stop
a possible fight between the Fi-
jis and the PiKas, Goss said.

Tensions eased when the police
arrived.

Farrar said that a fight never
broke out between the two
groups and therefore the inci-
dent was not within the jurisdic-
tion of the IFC. The incident
primarily involved two in-
dividuals, Farrar said, and thus
it was a matter for Student Con-
trol to handle.

In other business, Farrar said
the Judicial Board is in-
vestigating the funding of
Wednesday. night parties that
have been held this semester.

“We are investigating the
funding in general and two
cases in particular,” Farrar
said. He would not say which
two cases were receiving closer
scrutiny.

Dash’s Picks For °79

Now that everybody else has come out with a
“Ten Best’ list of movies for 1979 (except for
Time magazine, which had a ‘‘Best of the Decade”’
list), I thought that I would list what I thought
were the ten best of the year.

My problem in listing them is that I haven’t seen
all the movies of the year that I’d like to have seen,
thus I thought I’d list five I wish I had seen, and
then five I have seen:

The Five Movies of 1979 I Wish I Had Seen:

Eraserhead by David Lynch—Lynch’s first
feature film is ‘“‘A dream of dark and troubling
things’’ and a punk-cult film already.

Despair by Ranier Werner Fassbinder—is a
decadent comedy adopted from Nabokov. I was in-
vited to the Chicago premier (Fassbinder was
there!) but I had to give my pass to a chum
because I was in Big Lex (GAAHHH!).

Rock and Roll High School by Allan Arkush—
stared Chuck Berry and The Ramones and has in-
cited people to yell, ‘I don’t wanna be a pin-head
no more!”’ Very punk (i.e. artistic).

Peppermint Soda by Diane Kurys—another
premier film for the director; Kurys is a protege
of Truffaut. The film is about an adolecent girl
making the transition into womanhood.

Escape From Alcatraz by Don Seigel—is not
just another Clint Eastwood film. It is, rather, a
low-key film noir; showing what a powerful genre
this is.

At last, The Five Best Films of 1979.

1) Dawn Of The Dead by George Romero—the
superior sequel to the classic Night Of The Living
Dead. This is both the most horrible film ever pro-

duced (more gore than ever before! ) anda serious
film asking questions about the nature of humani-
ty.

2) Saint Jack by Peter Bogdonavitch—a power-
fully subtle movie by a master craftsman. This is
about honor and decency in the demi-monde of
Singapore. Jack (Ben Gazara) is a pimp cor-
rupted by forces greater than himself. This movie
manipulates the audience like no other.

2) Fedora by Billy Wilder—is the artistic sequel
to Sunset Boulevard. This is the story of a
Garbo/Crawford-esque movie actress whose life
is shrouded in mystery. An excellent reflection on
the previous film and on the whole of Wilder’s
(and to a lesser extent his fellow German, Lang’s)
career.

3) The Marriage of Maria Brun by Ranier
Werner Fassbinder—is the second film of the year
by the prolific Fassbinder. This is a political
analogy between the war bride Maria and Ger-
many after the war. The film is incredibly rich on
all levels.

4) Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola—
the year’s spectacle. Flawed in many places, but
too powerful to be forgotten. (Oh, and thanks,
Flamer. )

5) Kramer vs. Kramer by Robert Benton—this
film belongs to its excellent cast. Someone will
probably re-write this inevitable film of the seven-
ties and put it on T.V., but the acting by Meryl
Streep, Dustin Hoffman, and Jane Alexander is
faultless. The intensity of the characters as they
portray them is astounding.

The No.1
Debate

 

 

Look out fans, but here we go again. Just as the
debate over who was No. 1 in college football seemed
to be dying down, the same question has popped up in
college basketball circles.

With a 16-0 record, DePaul has earned the top spot

in both polls for the second straight week. However,

DePaul is not the dominant team that a top ranking
implies.

Sure, they have a perfect record, a sentimental
favorite in Ray Meyer and an electrifying player in
Mark Aguirre, but they aren’t the best.

Let’s face it. No team in the country can claim to be
supreme over all others. A look at some of the top
challengers should prove my point.

Case No. 1: DePaul has the only perfect record, but
only on last Sunday did they play a team that has been
a legitimate national contender (LSU). A good per-
formance against Notre Dame would merit DePaul
the top spot.

Case No. 2: Oregon State will now claim it should be
No. 1. I have only two questions for the Beavers: (1)
where is Oregon State? and (2) who have they
played? (Besides U.C.L.A.).

' Case No. 3: Duke continues to be the season’s biggest
enigma. Sometimes the Blue Devils are unstoppable
and sometimes they look like a coach’s nightmare.
Take ro its ACC games and Duke has a perfect
record.

Case No; 4: Kentucky is likewise a team of mystery.
The Wildcats beat Notre Dame without three of their
best players and then got dumped by Alabama and
Tennessee. For the time being, UK will have to forget
about national prominence and try to win its con-
ference.

Case No. 5: Syracuse’s claim to fame was beating
Purdue at Purdue. Unfortunately for the Orangemen,
one game does not a ranking make. For every Purdue
on Syracuse’s schedule, you can find the likes of
Canisius, LeMoine and St. Francis.

Case No. 6: Notre Dame will be in serious trouble if it
has to face any more quick teams. Losses to Kentucky
and San Francisco prove this fact. If the Irish had
more team speed and more depth, they could win it
all. However, these are big “‘ifs’’.

Case No. 7: Louisville has been quietly closing in on
the top spot with each new poll. The team responsible
for “The Doctors of Dunk”’ and ‘Dr. Dunkenstein’’
has loads of talent, but it is hampered by playing a
nearly anonymous schedule. The Cardinals are

notorious for choking in the playoffs — and will pro- -

bably do the same this year.

So now you have seven of the best teams in the na-
tion. Instead of making a prediction as to who will win
it all, I’ll leave that thought with you. After the bids
have been passed out and the regional brackets have
been set up, then, maybe, a favorite can be establish-
ed.

Until that time, your guess is as good as mine.

Cagers Spend Week In
Midst Of Losing Skein

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee
basketball team continued to
struggle through the toughest
part of its season last week, as
the Generals dropped a pair of
games and watched their

_ record slip to 5-8.

The combined losing margin
for both games was only twelve
points, however.

Against Eastern Mennonite
last Thursday night, W&L fell
behind early due to hot shooting
by Mennonite. The Generals
trailed 30-40 at the half, yet
were able to cut the margin to
three midway through the sec-
ond half. That was as close as
the Generals were to come.

“Mennonite was really up for
us and we were not ready to
play,”’ said head coach Verne
Canfield. ‘‘We may still have
been emotionally spent from
the Hampden-Sydney game.”

Freshman forward Brian
Hanson had a big game against
Mennonite, scoring 17 points
and grabbing six rebounds.
Junior R.J. Seaggs added
eleven points and six rebounds,
and sophomore guard George
Spears chipped in eleven points.

Although the starting five’s
scoring was balanced, the out-
puts of both senior forward Tom
Jeffries and junior center Rob
Smitherman ‘fell to nine and
eight points, respectively.

The Generals got a big lift
from their bench as sophomore
Clark New scored 14 points and
snared seven rebounds. Sopho-
more forward Travis Patterson
tacked on the remaining seven
points from the bench, yet these
efforts were not enough as the
Generals ended up on the short
end of the score, 84-77.

The key to the Generals’ prob-
lems has been their inconsisten-
cy on defense. Against Men-
nonite, W&L allowed two
players to each score over twen-
ty points.

Similarly, in W&L’s 85-80 loss
to Lynchburg last Saturday, the
problem remained the same—
defense. After trailing by only
three points at the half, the
Generals were outscored 13-5 in

 

Clark New (above) and George
Spears are now the starting
guards;

 

a quick, three minute burst by
Lynchburg.

‘‘What we need to establish is
more overall consistency, stop-
ping the bad stretches that hurt
us in the end,” said Canfield.

Lynchburg maintained a dis-

tance of no more than thirteen

points but no less than ten,
stretching their lead to 76-66
with 6:30 left in the game. The
worst news for the Generals

was Lynchburg’s incredible
86% field goal shooting in the
second half.

Yet a W&L squad that could
have settled for trying to stay
close mounted an incredible
comeback in the last six
minutes of the game; a come-
back that fell just short.

New, who played a big part in
keeping the Generals close for
the better part of the second
half, scored five of his team-
high 18 points in the last six
minutes. Jeffries collected five
of his 16 points during this
stretch and the Lynchburg lead
melted to three points with just
:30 remaining.

As time ran down, W&L was
forced to foul Lynchburg’s
dead-eye guard Scott Huffman,
who‘canned all four free throw
opportunities to put the game
out of reach. Both Huffman and
the Hornet’s All-Conference
center E.D. Schechterly netted
27 points apiece.

Again, a two-man combina-
tion was able to hit for at least
40 points against the Generals.
W&L’s own scoring, in addition
to New and Jeffries, was very
well balanced; Spears had 13,
Smitherman collected 14 and
Patterson scored 10.

“Our bad stretches are
becoming less now, and the play
of Clark New and Travis Patter-
son are really positive signs,”
said Canfield. ‘“‘The kids musn’t
worry about past mistakes but
what is ahead of them.”’

In a game played last night,
the Generals faced Gettysburg,
a team which, according to Can-
field, ‘has been playing good
ball, winning their last five
games. Yet the point is not what
they will be able to do to us, but
what we can do to beat them.”

Grapplers Split In Tourney;
Host Invitational This Sat.

by Chris Sisto

Last week the Washington &
Lee wrestling team posted a 1-1
mark in dual meet play and had
a disappointing appearance in
the Citadel Tournament.

At the tournament the
Generals had only four victories
and a loss that could prove cost-
ly for the remainder of the
season. Two of the victories
came from team captain Ray
Gross, who finished second in
the 142 pound weight class. He
lost in the finals 8-5. The other
wins came from seniors Ed
Rogers at 167 lbs. and Mike
Deighan at 150 lbs.

What was more important
however, was the injury to
sophomore Mike McFadden. He
suffered a leg injury in his first
match at the tournament and
according to Head Coach Gary
Franke he could be out from one
week to the rest of the season.
Last year McFadden was
ODAC champion at 150 lbs. and

won the Generals’ Outstanding
Freshman Wrestler award.

Franke said about the tourna-
ment he felt his team didn’t do
as well as he had expected, say-
ing the team ‘‘had made some
mistakes.”

Earlier in the week the
Generals lost to Glassboro State
32-13, and successfully defend
their ODAC crown with a win
over Hampden-Sydney 30-25.

Winners against H-S were Scott
Lindsey (126), Gross (142),
Rogers (167) and Joe Wallace
(heavyweight). Against
Glassboro only Gross, McFad-
den, and Rogers were winners.
The team will try to improve
upon their 2-5 record with a
match against ODAC opponent
Lynchburg College tonight and
then hosts the Washington &
Lee Invitational Tournament

Saturday.

by Ed Brown

| As the candidates begin to put their campaigns
in high gear for the first round of caucuses and
primaries, the Republican Party as a whole is
beginning its assault on the Carter administration.
January 14th and 15th saw the first in a series of
Republican platform hearings held by the
Republican National Committee. The hearings,
described by R.N.C. Chairman Bill Brock as the
‘most comprehensive and open platform develop-
ment process ever attempted by’ either party,”
were held in Washington, D.C. A number of ex-
perts in a wide variety of fields testified as to their
recommendations for the Republican platform.
Nine more open hearings will be held in various
cities around the country over the next five
months. :

Chaired by Senator John Tower of Texas, the
Resolutions Committee included Washington and
Lee graduates Brock, a former Senator from Ten-
nessee, and Senator John Warner of Virginia. Both
Brock and Warner will be on hand for the May 9th
and 10th Mock Convention with Brock delivering
opening remarks and Senator Warner serving as
Parade Marshal.

Never far from the political scene, W&L’s Mock
Convention was well represented at the hearings.
Tri-Chairmen Dick Schoenfeld, Craig Cornett and
Sidney Simmons along with Platform Chairman
Ed Brown spent two days listening to the
testimony of the witnesses that included Senators
Jacob Javits of New York and Larry Pressler of
South Dakota, Carla Hills, former Secretary of
H.U.D., former Senator James Buckley, Con-
gressman Jack Kemp of New York and Governor
Pete du Pont of Delaware. ;

Javits led off the testimony with an explosive
call for an expanded NATO alliance. Echoed by
others throughout the two days, Javits urged the
Committee to adopt a platform plank increasing

the US. and western presence in the volital area

of the mid-east and south Asia. The plan would re-
quire an effort to securc the free passage of oil
through the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean and the
Persian Gulf. In addition, the NATO allies would
agree to bring the oil fields of the area within their
defense perimeter. In the same vein, numerous
witnesses saw a need for increasing the ability of
the intelligence community to perform their func-
tion by repealing what they feel to be overly
restrictive legislation and allowing the agencies to
conduct their affairs with a lesser amount of con-
gressional intervention, while mainting executive
oversight to protect against abuses of power.

The hearings saw the traditional Republican
values of more free enterprise and less govern-
ment. This concept, as stated by Hills of a “‘decen-
tralization of decision-making away from
Washington toward the people,” was a theme
often repeated. While most speakers seized the op-
portunity to take a preemptory potshot at the
Carter administration and the Democrats at
large, it was seen that this was not the sole func-
tion of the hearings. Representative Kemp was
adamant on this point. ‘‘We must first advance
positive solutions which repair the damage done
by the Democratic Party” were the words of the
New York Congressman.

As with the Republican Party, the Mock Conven-
tion has gotten off to an early start in forming the
1980 Mock Convention platform. It is the hope of
the Platform Committee to prepare drafts of the
platform prior to the convention and to hold open
hearings on campus as well as at other schools in
the area to allow input on the controversial issues
that will be taken up in this year platform.
Although often overlooked and ignored by the
nominee, it is the belief of Republicaneaders that
“The lines are clearly drawn between the two par-
ties’’ in the words of Chairman Brock, and that the
platform will gain new significance in the general

EC Will Not Pay

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously not to pay
the City of Lexington for
damages done to a_ police
cruiser on the night of the Ira-
nian rally.

Action on the matter was tabl-
ed during a meeting two weeks
ago when the EC decided not to
take action until it had more in-
formation about the city’s in-
surance on the automobile.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Steve Abraham talked
with Chief of Police James A.
Kirby, who notified the Univer-
sity that he wanted the school to
pay for the damages.

Kirby told Abraham that he
talked to Dean of Students Louis
G. John on the night of the rally
and quoted John as saying,
“We'll take care of any
damages done to the car.”’

Abraham said he did not
know that John had already told
Kirby that the University would
pay for repairs. The EC Presi-
dent said that he still did not
think that the EC should pay for
the damage and the EC then
voted unanimously not to pay

for the repairs.

However, the EC also left the
door open for restitution to the

For Damage To Car

city should there be any more
information indicating that it
should pay the city.

Junior Representative Jay
Blumberg restated the argu-
ment against paying the city
that John Fraser, Senior Law
Representative, made two
weeks ago.

Fraser said, ‘I don’t want to
start a precedent where
everytime a W&L student goes
downtown and raises hell the
University has to pay for it.’’

Korry Paints Grim
Picture For Future

by Alan Kendrick

‘“‘A generation symbolized by
three little words, ME, MORE,
and NOW. Americans did not
want to be drawn into messy
foreign situations. We wanted a
muting of idsological and par-
tisan passions, were far more
dedicated to consumption than
to savings and investment, far
more cynical about politicians
and parties, and far more
devoted to the exploration of
one’s self.’’ This is the descrip-
tion W&L alumnus Ambassador
Edward M. Korry gave of this
country as he outlined the re-
cent developments in Iran and
Afghanistan at the ODK
assembly Friday.

“So we have a government,”
said Korry, “which mirrored
this mood and these priorities.
The President announced that
the era of foreign policy built on
fear of the Soviet Union and
Communism had ended — the
U.S. would substitute moral ex-
ample and human rights for
overseas involvement. No one’s
lifestyle would be upset — there
would be no wrenching changes
to deal with the energy crunch
— no sacrifice to maintain the
dollar as the foundation of the

MMA

global economic system — no
annoying tax increases for
weapons and troops for the
perilous game of Balance of
Power. Instead, the Soviet
Union would play by our rules.”’

Of the Ethiopian crisis, Korry
said, ‘“‘We acted as if nothing
had changed.” Korry, former
ambassador to Ethiopia, said
that the all-out Soviet committ-
ment to that country in 1977
greatly explains the current in-
ternational developments:

“When the Afghan govern-
ment was overthrown in 1978,
for example, the State Depart-
ment and the New York Times
promptly emphasized to us that
there was no evidence of Soviet
involvement,. no basis for
believing the new regime in
Kabul would be aligned to
Moscow, no cause for concern.

“Again, when the Soviets
dumped Somalia for its larger
neighbor, Ethiopia, the White
House and the Times informed
us that the Somalis, in fact, had
dumped the Soviets; the Rus-
sians, we were told. would soon
find themselves mired in
Ethiopia, too.”

“The Carter  administation
changed no policy in response to
the Soviets actions in Ethiopia;
it avoided any alarm which
might jeopardize the SALT
treaty and the central dialogue

‘ the power

with the Russians. Instead, we

dispatched an ambassador to.

Addis and we renewed our ef-
forts to persuade the Arabs and
Isrealis to meet with the Rus-
sians and us to establish peace
in the Middle East.”

Korry stressed that decision-
making errors were often at
fault, “It is mot only in
authoritarian governments that
of decsion is
obscured, but also in the murky
processes of our divided
democracy,”’ as he quoted Sen.
Moynihan. Korry attributed
much of the problem with Iran
to these faults in decision-
making. “First, we tried to
reassure the Sheiks and the
Ayatollahs of our good inten-

* tions by opening an under-the-

table dialogue with the Palesti-
nian Liberation Organization.
Then, we reversed direction.
The White House ignored the
strongest warnings from our
top diplomat in Teheran not to
admit the Shah. And when we
did, Khomeni reacted as ex-
plosively as our Embassy had
forewarned. He applauded the
hostagetaking because it
dramatized his cultural
counterrevolution. The Shah

circumstances similar to the
overthrow of the Czars...a
period of rapid, belated in-
dustrialization...the whole tur-
bulent process called socializa-
tion.”’

Three goals of U.S. policy
coincided with the dethrowned

_ Shah’s objectives, according to

Korry, and these were:’’1)
Tokeep the Russians out of Iran
— and out of the entire Persian
Gulf area. 2) To keep oil flowing
to the West and to Japan. 3) To
keep Isreal independent and
secure. These three pillars of
U.S. policy in the Mid-east,”
said Korry, collapsed with the
Shah, yet they did not provoke
any major shift in our foreign
policy...nor did they halt the
politics-as-usual at home.”

In regard to Afghanistan,
Korry said, ‘“‘The Soviets don’t
like failures either, particularly
in a sensitive place such as a
neighboring country. The fiasco
of its own puppet would be
motive enough for the Kremlin

Korry gave six major reasons
for the Soviet invasion: ‘‘1)
There would be little effective

free the hostages in Iran...and
one argument we emphasized
was our determination to avoid
force if at all possible. 3) The
thrust gives Russia a weighty
influence over Iran’s future. 4)
The Soviets are now installed on
Afghan airfields only 350 miles
from the Persian Gulf — poised
to ‘protect Iran.” 5) The
Soviets can now lean more
heavily against China and its al-
ly Pakistan. These Asians are,
of course, very concerned. zbu
But only 72 hours ago, President
Zia of Pakistan stated the
lesson of Afghanistan plainly:

‘You cannot live in the sea
and creat the enmity of whales;
you have to be friendly with
them. The Soviet Union is on
our doorstep. The U.S. is 10,000
miles away...’

That’s the sort of prudence
many governments will share.
6) The Soviets are well-
positioned to profit in the most
critical area of all-the Middle
East...from the festering
cancer which sickens our rela-
tions with the Arab states...the
unsettled situation of Isreal and
the Palestinians.

“If the U.S, does not now app-
ly its full weight, election year
or not...if it does not risk, does
not expend, whatever is
necessary to push the parties
toward a final settlement, the
Kremlin will certainly add to its
ascendancy.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Dancing The Night Away

Last year at this time there were cynics among us
who felt that the W&L community was not conducive
to a massive fund-raising effort. Everyone knew that
the W&L student was self-centered and egotistical,
and would only cooperate in activities that would
enhance his hedonist seekings. Not enough people
seemed up for the event—it was just something to
drop by if nothing else was going on. How wrong we
were! Our first dance marathon netted about $10 per
student enrolled, the highest per capita yield in
Virginia. Our neighbors at Virginia Tech set for their
goal a dollar per student, and they had been having
dance marathons for quite some time. Everyone
deserved a slap on the back for the effort, from the
dancers to the drinkers to the administrators.

This year there are more than three times as many
students registered to dance as last year and more
are coming in. But we cannot be lured into false
security by last year’s success. We need particiaption
more than ever, in workers, dancers, and revelers.
This is one of our ‘Big Weekends” and we can only
make it work if we all contribute something. So often
charity efforts are merely the signing of a check or
the attending of some grueling sports event. Here’s a
chance to get something out of the giving—a damn
good party and a lot of fun.

Our Threatened
Traditions

Can the W&L gentleman survive the gas crisis?
Changes that occured over Christmas break have
made several of the more serious minded among us

Musings On Current Events

John Connaliy-believes that staying awake for 40
hours will show that he is the best man for the
presidency. The Carter Administration believes
that the best interests of our democratic republic
are served by throwing money at a bizarre-looking
politically unstable despot in Pakistan. Teddy
Kennedy is able to divert questions about his

 
 
 
 
 
 

swimming ability by having his ex-aiconolic wife
say that she believes his stories. °

Because of the mass media, and its ‘‘predic-
tions,”’ a candidate can lose a primary and still be
a winner. Tens of millions of people actually
believe that Jimmy the Greek, Jane Kennedy,
Brent Munsburger, and Irv Cross know their col-
lective digestive systems from a hole in the
ground. Some poor people are so desperate for
entertainment that they actually watch more than
the last five minutes of any basketball game.

Roone Arledge is the head of a national net-
work’s news department. Barbara Walters gets a
million dollars a year. Jane Fonda believes that

drive circle we are familiar with. Now we debate who

shall drive by considering the issue of who has the =

smallest car rather than the biggest; instead of roll-
ing-until the beer runs out we plan to go to the closest
school and no further. The infirmary is plagued with
an epidemic of fanny fatigue cases as six are piled in-
toa Toyota rather than a suburbanite ‘‘lead sled.”’

Now we wince at the sound of our own voices admit-
ting that gas at $1.06 isn’t bad. But the energy crisis
has now hit below the belt, beyond the gas tank and in-
to the fraternity social program. Reports are that
Virginia’s grain alchohol, which we all know is made
for drinking and not for burning, is now going into
gasahol and then automobiles rather than into big
jugs and then garbage cans. We may now be incited to
drive less so that perhaps our children can enjoy the
bliss of trudging to ‘“‘A’’-hour classes with their
mouths still red and their faces green. One of the
wealthier fraternities has started a ‘‘grain cellar”’
with the finest spirits bottled, labeled by vintage, and
stored securely away for future generations or ar-
cheologists. (What a find for The Dig in 200 years! )

Rush candidates will be judged, we suspect, by who
holds a gas credit card, and the popular girls will be
those who use ‘‘plastic Daddy”’ on the tank rather
than the clothes. The effects will be felt in the admis-
sions office and studied in the sociology department.
And when we are old and gray, with quivering voice
we can relate to our open-mouthed successors the stir
in the heart we felt at the cry of ‘‘Road trip to
Hollins !’’—a sound that will only be an echo of a by-
- gone culture.

Ariel. Different things to different people. Dif-
ferent things to different editors. Chris Fay’s Ariel
is nothing if not different.

Before I get to the meat of my argument, I
would like to applaud Fay for his inclusion of art-
work in Ariel. In particular the works of Drayton
Smith are a welcome addition to a magazine too
long dominated by photography.

Ariel, Vol. XVIII, No. 1 certainly has a different
feel than most Ariel’s I’ve read. Rather than a col-

 

Parker Potter is a 1979 graduate of Washington and
Lee University and a former editor of Ariel.

 

lection of specific pieces whose only commonality
is being printed between the same covers, Fay’s
Ariel presents a number of pieces which work
together to pose a number of interrelated ques-
tions.

Put simply, the magazine asks whether art is a
public or private act and whether the goal of art is
to entertain or to challenge its audience. My feel-
ing is that Ariel is indeed challenging if not enter-
taining, instructive if not delightful. And for me,
the challenge of Ariel is making my own some of
the intensely private or at least foreign expres-
sions in it. (By “‘making my own” I am referring
to the process by which we all come to understand
a work of art—in whatever way we need to. )

Perhaps what I’m trying to say (what I need to
say) is that Ariel is a totally honest attempt by
Fay and his staff to present one vision/version of
literature. And for the record, while some of what
happens in Ariel seems a bit on the fringe, there is
nothing going on in it that isn’t pretty old hat to
any moderately knowledgable reader of modern
poetry. But on to the heart of the issue, which is
the issue.

Like any literary magazine, Ariel has its high
points and low points, and in between, many points
to be made.

One high point is Hike Moore’s story “The
Orange-Tinted Window.” I admire its well-
craftedness. The dialogue is consistent and it
works. Even more noteworthy is Moore’s atten-
tion to detail and his ability to manipulate the
details of the actual world through the mind of the
oldman, .

Finally, though, it is Moore’s ability to translate
the old man’s thoughts into words and actions in

contemplation.

Jim Leva’s story (a fragment extracted from
another longer work) is pure Leva. It is notable for
his usual sophisticated wordplay and generally
provocative use of language. And the premise of
this little chunk of story is clever but not cute—
delightfully wry.

It is good to know that Palmore Clark is alive
and well. With his rather unusual style he is able to
pack together quite a few insightful moments and
even string them together but maybe just maybe
some of his keen observations and feelings might
do better each in its own pot with its own little soil
and not all brambled and bristled together but who
am I tosay to say to say...

Dash’’s story, ‘‘Lucid,” is another of Ariel’s fic-
tions. If we can untangle Dash’s fiction from the
fiction of Dash I think its a whole lot easier to deal
with ‘‘Lucid.’’ What Dash does he does well. He
needs few words to vividly splash colors onto the
surface of the weird little world of his story.

I feel compelled to speak up about the infamous
phone booth scene. Well—things like that do hap-
pen, I suppose. And the scene is certainly germain
to the story, and—strange though it may be—a
story which works. Enough moral mountains
made of artful ant hills.

Much of what is left of Ariel, for me at least,
doesn’t work. Tom Baker’s ‘6:00 P.M. at the
Local A&P” has a narration problem. Neither nar-
rative nor essay, this story struggles to find a tone
and in doing so deep-sixes everything but its easy
moralism.

As for ‘‘Maggie’’ by Kitt Donne—I’m not real
sure what it’s trying to do, so I’ve got no idea
whether or not it does it well.

And my problems with “Maggie” and ‘“A&P”’
are as good as gloss as any for the generally
perceived problems with the rest of Ariel. Obvious-
ly Baker and Donne have some clear idea of what
their stories do. They are no doubt successful as
private acts. They just haven’t become successful
public acts.

“The Vantage Point,” ‘“‘Anyone Home,” ‘‘Loch
Ness Likeness,”’ and Ed Bloomquist’s piece all
mean something to the person who put them in
Ariel. And to the person who made them. These
along with Katherine Reiche’s, Chip McFeeter’s,
and Geof Bain’s are all intensely personal works.

“If it is trash at four bucks a pop

it would be trash for a quarter.”

 

the real world which is most arresting and most
praiseworthy in the story.

I also like very much Dan Weeks’ “‘Improvisa-
tions in Cool.’’ These six small poems all use
their sound to underline their meaning. The slight-
ly muted, slippery twisting of ‘sensual smoke
rings” does what a saxophone does. And ‘‘the deep
darkness of night’’ has the measured beat of a
thumping bass line.

As well, Weeks’ deserves credit for the deft un-
forced way in which he uses so much visual im-
agery to make us hear the instruments in his jazz
club.

There is much to be admired in Phil Welch’s
long poem. Welch states the central dilemma of
the poem clearly, early on, then allows the poem
to go on about its business. And in doing that
business the poem repeatedly returns to its cen-
tral thesis—that war, while a creation of man, has
grown out of control, like some Frankenstein’s

monster, bigger than life, somehow no longer

comprehensible.

The tone and diction of the poem are generally
very well controlled. Welch can talk of something
“whose origin precedes history...beginning
beyond beginning and ending beyond end”’ and not
have the brittle, stilted sound of something written
by a horn-rimmed high school freshman who just
read his first philosophy book. Welch’s is a good
poem with many fine moments.

Among the other poetry, I find both Andrew
Trotter’s short pieces and Brett Lovejoy’s ‘‘Por-
trait: Hatteras Solitude’ to be unpretentious and
effective, in a word-appealing. They are
understated yet complete, suggesting to the
reader further avenues of interesting and pleasant

oeecerrese SEO CCC CeCe eC eee se 6

The question we face is whether poetry can be
anything other than personal, not whether is
should be or must be. These poems suggest that
the meaningfulness of a poem to a reader is pure
happenstance, a fortuitous accident.

Certainly these poems challenge the reader. Be-
ing faced by a blank page is an uncomfortable
thing. And being shown something like ‘Anyone
Home,”’ as personal as that poem is, can be pretty
unnerving. (Who can say whether or not it’s
trash—it’s somebody’s damn notebook—you
should see what I’ve got in mine—).

But is it the goal of art to be comfortable—to ex-
ist for the audience? I don’t know. Nobody knows.

There are things in Ariel I can’t write about.
Things I’ve not yet made my own. But that’s o.k.
And Fay’s certainly isn’t like any Ariel I’d put out.
But that’s o.k., too. There are some things in Ariel
I wouldn’t blow my nose on. Finally, that too is o.k.

Perhaps Fay hasn’t pleased his audience or
even been very conscious of it. His Ariel has been
much read and much discussed. That’s good. A
number of people are pretty damn sure they know
what they don’t like in Ariel. Good. That can help
them know all the better what they do like.

I’ve probably raised more questions than I’ve
answered here. Fay’s probably isn’t an Ariel very
many of us would put out ourselves. But not very
many of us were asked to put one out.

If it is trash at four bucks a pop it would be trash
for a quarter. And if we were ripped off or
mismanaged, the sin would be just as great if the
thing was to win a Pulitzer Prize.

Ariel: Different Things To Different People

 

ARIEL

Vol. XVIII, No. 1

Fall 1979

Letter To The Editor
EC Should Not Have

Criticized Magazine

Dear Sir,

In reference to the E.C. com-
ments on the Ariel, I think Dee
Keesler was on the right track
when he said discussion of the
matter was outside of their
realm. By now the members of
E.C. should have more tact
when they express public opi-
nions such as those criticisms
expressed.

Let me first address Mr.
Fraser who felt much of the
Ariel was trash. My first im-
pression was similar; however,
I did give the magazine more
than a fifteen-minute glance.
Closer inspection led me to ap-
preciate some of the accom-
plishments of the magazine.
First of all, this last issue was
one of the first attempts I have
recently seen to present the
material in a creative, modern,
and free-form style. Undoubted-
ly Mr. Fraser would call some
of E.E. Cummings poems,
which are scrawled and often
without titles, trash.

A few pages featured graffiti
which is finally coming to be
recognized as an art form.
Some very successful associa-
tions were made between the
drawings, photographs, and
poems. It was rather refreshing
that the book didn’t overdo the
typical appearance of sunrises,
forests, clouds, and beach
scenes that accompany equally
humdrum poems. Further-
more, Chris Faye has a limited
donation of creative works to
choose from. If they were lack-
ing in talent, then that would be
the fault of the students, not the
editor.

Jay Blumburg claims he is no
literary critic and should re-
main so. (He would also do well
to refrain from comments on
some financial matters.) The
E.C. has let more blatent ex-
amples of poor budgeting slide

!
'

in its recent dealings with the
Cold Check Committee, the
U.C.C. and the S.A.B. Remem-
ber the $3,000 lost when Levon
Helm canceled his concert? By
these standards $182 over the
estimated budget is a drop in
the bucket. Having investigated
the matter further the original
$1582 was negotiated down to
$1450 when Chris Faye disputed
the bill with The News-Gazette.
Going only $50 over his
estimated budget seems com-
mendable to me. I do agree,
however, that Chris Faye could
have shopped around for a bet-
ter bid. The University un-
doubtedly would have been
cheaper than The News-Gazette
by a long shot.

Most disappointing was Eddie
Schenecker’s comment that
some of the material was offen-
sive. Some material was shock-
ing. The response was the same
when Monet produced A Lunch-
eon on the Grass and Olympia.
DuChamps when he placed a
urinal on display and called his
sculpture The Fountain was
viciously attacked by an ig-
norant press. It was, however,
one of the most revolutionary
breakthroughs in modern art
and precipitated the Dadaist
Movement.

Casual analysis would reveal
that the Ariel’s editor is not
bound by the same code of jour-
nalism ethics which binds the
editor of the Ring-tum Phi. The
editor of the Ariel is not trying
to be objective nor is he an
honest broker of facts. Instead
he is reproducing creative
works of artistic merit. It is
often hard for those who are so
firmly rooted in a traditional
art form to accept this. The
Ariel was not printed for the
closed-minded or little old
ladies. Perhaps this can be best
summed up in a quote of

Letters To The Editor

 

‘Misunderstanding’ Resolved

Dear editor:

We are writing this letter in
an attempt to clear the muddy
waters which seem to have
developed as a result of a
misunderstanding at Monday's
Executive Committee meeting.
This controversy arose over
Bruce Poole’s role as an E.C. ad
hoc member to the Student Con-
trol Committee, and the fact
that he may have voted twice
during a proceeding. It is possi-
ble that he may have cast the
second vote after having agreed
that he should not continue this
practice.

Bruce was unable to recall
these facts, and Steve Abraham
acted to “clarify the situation
for the record."’ This occurred

only after a reporter at the .

meeting had opened discussion
on the topic.

Since the meeting Monday,
Bruce has reflected upon his
participation in the Student
Control meeting in question. He

realizes now that he indeed may |

have voted twice and makes his
sincerest apologies to the Stu-
dent Body for his wrong actions.

Steve in no way intended his
comments to Bruce to be view-
ed as if he was publicly attack-
ing Bruce, he merely sought to
clarify the situation. However,
he does realize that he should
have possibly done so when this
issue first discussed. Steve

STAND To Meet

Dear Editor,

As we begin the second
semester and enter the 1980's
STAND, Students and
Townspeople Against Nuclear
Development, will be expan-
ding its efforts to inform the
community of the unacceptable
dangers of nuclear energy.
Since we have been back, two
film presentations have been
made. No Act of God, an award
winning documentary by the
National Film Board of Canada,
and I Have Three Children of
My Own, an excellent slide
show prepared by Dr. Helen
Caldicott, a pediatrician who
has worked extensively with
children diseased by cancer,
were both well received by
students and local citizens.

This Monday at 8:00 in Reid
203 a lecture on the history of
the nuclear waste program in
this country and where it is go-
ing will be given by Chris
Tolleson. Following the presen-

Dear Sir,

After reading Bruce Whip-
ple’s letter, I would like to add a
few comments of my own. Aside
from a few typographical and
layout errors, I thought the
Ariel was quite creative and ex-
plorative. Coufal’s tale was
tasteless and perhaps reflected
an S/M mentality. I recognize
artistic license, but blatant porn
is offensive to me. Otherwise,
the Ariel was quite appealing.

tation we will try to organize an
action group whose duties will
be to keep an eye on reports in
the media and in government,
and to orchestrate petitioning
and letter campaigns, and to
keep us up on activities going on
across the nation and in the
State of Virginia.

Incidentally, Lightworks in
Lexington is the base of opera-
tions for a Renewable Energy
Legislative Proposal which is
now being considered in Rich-
mond. It includes a proposal for
a tax deduction of 25% on the
cost of any energy im-
provements made on homes
and businesses. More informa-
tion about the proposals and
what you can do to help can be
obtained directly by calling
Lightworks at 463-9445. Mostly,
however, they are in need of
envelope stuffers and the like.
Any time you can spare in this
way would be greatly ap-
preciated. The lobbying effort is
being spearheaded by a local,
John MacLeod, who will be
speaking on his experiences
with the legislation as well as
the potentials of renewable

energy resources for the’

economy at one of the STAND
meetings in the near future.

In the meantime a benefit for
STAND is being held in the
Cockpit tonight. The band’s new
name is the Surburban
Parasites, (once considered to
be the Space Rangers) and is
made up of local musicians and
one or two students. They
played in the pit just before
Christmas break and do ex-
cellent versions of the Allman
Brothers, Grateful Dead, as
well as a few originals. We'll
also be showing two short films.
One of which is of the student
demonstrations held here at
U.Va. after the Kent State kill-
ings. Because it is a benefit we
can’t charge a cover, but we ask
for a donation of a dollar or
more if you can give it. Your
support will be greatly ap-
preciated when the band starts

Bring Back The Hangings

To the Editor:

One afternoon before the be-
ginning of Christmas break, I
went to the Supply Store to find
out if I could purchase one of
those wall hangings stating:
‘When Better Women are
Made, W&L Men Will Make
Them.” To my chagrin, I was
told by one of the cashiers that
these particular hangings were
no longer sold due to objections
voiced by some women law stu-
dents. I was rather disap-
pointed and very much surpris-
ed.

I have two objections regard-
ing these hangings no longer be-
ing sold. The first of these is
that a few women law students
that make up a very small
minority of the student body
can, according to their whim,
elimate the sale of a certain
product that happens not to ap-
peal to them. This is obviously
unfair to the rest of the student
body (especially those of us who
want to buy one of these hang-
ings). Why should student de-
mand for these hangings (which
was obviously present because
they were being sold) go un-
fulfilled because of the ideas. of
what I assume to be a few
crusading zealots? I assert that
there is no reason why the sale
of these wall hangings should
have been stopped. Further-
more, the sale of the hangings
should resume immediately.

My second objection to this
occurrence concerns the ac-
tions of the women law students
who were successful in banning
the sale of the hangings. If these
women are truly interested in
pursuing women’s liberation, or
whatever they wish to call it,
why do they waste their time on
trivial matters such as this? It
seems to me that if they were
truly interested in their
“‘cause,’’ they would appeal, via
writing, to the various state
assemblies which have not ap-
proved the Equal Rights
Amendment, instead of spend-
ing their time seeing to it that a
certain wall hanging (which I
assume they perceive to be ex-
ploitative) is no longer sold at

I would like to express my
sincere thanks to the members
of of the band who have donated
their time, equipment and
talents to this event, as well as
the staff in the Cockpit,
especially Pres, for their pa-
tience and hard work to make
all Cockpit ventures a success.

Boycott The Olympics

President Carter has found himself in the center of controversy
because he has urged the United States Olympic Committee to
withdraw from the summer games in Moscow if the Soviets refuse
to withdraw from Afghanistan by Feb. 20. This is yet another issue
in which Americans must look beyond special interests if the in-
terests of our nation are to be safeguarded. When the President in-
itially suggested that a boycott by the American Olympic con-
tingent may be imminent, my initial reaction was that this
measure would be grossly unfair to the athletes who have trained
for years in pursuit of elusive Olymipic glory.

The sobering effect of more recent developments such as the
Soviet buildup on the Iranian border and the threatening Soviet
troop alert in Eastern Europe has led me to conclude that we must
deprive the Soviets of the policy legitimization and propaganda
benefits of hosting the Olympics. The Soviets clearly preceive these
as benefits of the Olympics and therefore desire American par-
ticipation in the world’s greatest spectacle.

It is true that our amateur athletes will bear the overwhelming
burden of an Olympic boycott. They will be no more adversely af-
fected than the farmers, however, because the future absense of
the Soviet market and the surplus grain intended for the Soviet
Union will surely depress the long term grain market. The value of
an Olympic boycott and a trade embargo lies in attempting to.deter
the expansionist Soviet policies without -resorting to military
responses. Should we fail to peacefully restrain these bearlike ag-
gressions on virtually defenseless nations, the sacrifices many of
our peers will be asked to undergo will make those of Olympic

athletes and farmers look paltry indeed.

Yesterday’s University Council Meeting

by David Greer

The University Council
yesterday rejected two por-
posals that would had banned
live bands at both the Cockpit
and fraternity houses during
the week.

The proposals came from the
Student Affairs Committee
after ‘‘consideration of the
January 2 Report to the Univer-
sity Faculty on Implementation

 

of the University Council Action
of May 3, 1979.”

The proposals postulated that
‘‘no paid, live music be permit-
ted on any such weeknight”’ at
fraternity houses and ‘“‘that the
prohibition against weeknight
social functions, including live

music, be extended to the
Cockpit and all University pro-
perty.”’

The first proposal was

defeated 13-8 and the second
17-2, with two abstentions. Pro-
fessors John Holt Merchant and
Edward L. Pinney voted for the

proposal and Dr. John M.
Evans and IFC President Syd
Farrar abstained.

Most of the discussion was on
the second issue. The SAC had
intended for the two to be con-
sidered together, but the UC

EC Lowers Fancy Dress Price

by John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
learned Monday night that
tickets to Fancy Dress will cost
five dollars less than the
original price given by the Stu-
dent Activities Board.

_ Tickets to the dance will cost
$15.

Bill Ridge and David Har-
pole, Co-Chairmen of the SAB,
were told last week to appear
before the EC and explain the
SAB’s Fancy Dress budget.

After making and examining
its Fancy Dress budget, the
SAB voted to drop the ticket
price $5 from the original
price—$20.

Ridge told the EC two weeks
ago he was not sure how much
the Ball was going to cost since
alumni were barred.

‘‘We were concerned that we
lost 650 tickets from the alum-
ni,’ said Harpole Monday
night.

‘The 1980's will see organized
rebellion and Africans in
America will be on the front
lines to destroy the capitalist
system,’’ said civil-rights
leader Stokley Carmichael in
his speech at Washington and
Lee University’s Lee Chapel
last night.

The prominent crusader for
equal rights was sponsored by
the University’s Student
Association for Black Unity.

Carmichael is a member of
the All-African Peoples’
Revolutionary Party, an
organization whose objective is
Pan-Africanism, ‘‘the total
liberation and unification of
Africa under scientific
socialism.”’

Carmichael blamed the capi-
talist system for the oppression
of blacks in this country, citing
the system as the reason for
originally bringing slaves out of
Africa.

Once the capitalist system
has been destroyed, Car-
michael said the goal is a

Several EC members still had
questions about the SAB’s
seeming carelessness with the
Fancy Dress budget.

“I’m concerned how you
came up with the figure twenty-
dollars,’ said EC President
Steve Abraham.

Ridge and Harpole said the
mistake was their fault and told
the EC that they held a meeting
at which SAB members voted to
sell the tickets for $15.

EC Secretary Cove Geary
noted that the SAB would pro-
bably not spend $7,000 of stu-
dent funds allotted by the EC
for Fancy Dress.

The SAB Co-Chairmen ex-
plained that Fancy Dress
should cost about $25,000. They
said 1600 tickets would probably
be sold, raising $24,000 or $1,000
less than the Ball will cost.

“I think this is ridiculous, are
you planning on making money
on Fancy Dress?” Jim Wenke,

stead of all the goods going toa

In order to reach this goal, he
places the responsibility on the
African students in the colleges
and universities, using the term
African to refer to all blacks.

Sophomore Representative,
asked Ridge and Harpole.

The two SAB members ex-
plained that they need the $7,000
in the SAB budget for cash flow
reasons.

They explained that SAB
Chairmen had always done it
this way in the past.

‘In a sense you deceived the
EC about the $7,000 in the fall,”’
said Geary.

The Co-Chairmen said they.

did not intend to deceive the EC,
but were working on precedent.

Wenke also asked the pair
why they cancelled a meeting
Sunday evening.

“We called off the meeting
because we had done
everything we needed to do,”’
said Ridge. Harpole added that
they are waiting for materials
to come in.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg also criticized the Co-
Chairmen for an incident this
weekend in which a SAB
member lost $140 collected
from the SAB movie.

You two .are the two Co-
Chairmen, it is your respon-
sibility to watch the money,”’
said Blumberg.

Ridge explained that a SAB
member, Dan Weiss, left the
money in the computer room,
where someone found and
returned it.

Dance Marathon

Raises $23,594

Students at Washington and
Lee University raised $23,594
this past weekend toward
muscular dystrophy research
and treatment by ‘‘rocking
around the clock”’ in the second
annual W&L MD _ dance
marathon.

Some 150 determined dancers
tripped the light fantastic for 30
hours beginning Friday night in
Washington and Lee’s Evans
Hall.

When they stopped, in the wee
hours of Sunday, they had sur-
passed their $15,000 goal by 60
percent.

To raise the money, each
dancer or couple had to obtain
pledges totaling at least $45
each from individuals and
businesses. Sponsors agreed to
pay either a certain amount for
every hour a dancer could stay
on the floor or a regular fee for
completing all 30 hours of the
marathon.

Jay J. Blumberg of Boonton,
N.J., two-year chairman of the
marathon and a senior at
Washington and Lee, led this
year’s steering committee with
the help of co-chairman James

B. Hemby, a junior from

Anheuser-Busch Co. was in

the forefront of business
supporters—donating $800 for
entertainment expenses. Many
of Washington and Lee’s 16
social fraternities supplied
copious amounts of beer as well
as cash donations. Even a
number of the bands that had
been scheduled to play by
regular contract gave back
large portions of their fees as
gifts.

In all, seven bands performed
for the students and guests,
keeping spirits high. A galaxy
of special events also served to
help the dancers through the
wee hours of the morning—

Gen. Westmoreland Discusses

Global Problems Facing U.S.

by Ed Edge

The United States in the 80s is
going to have to strengthen its
position on world issues and
regain some of the international
respect it had in earlier years,
former Army Chief of Staff
William C. Westmoreland said
in his speech Tuesday night in

Washington and Lee Universi- -

ty’s Lee Chapel.
“In the 70s, our nation
became tranquilized and

militarily weak,’’ the general
said.

Westmoreland pointed out
some shaking events that oc-
curred in the past decade that

include a break between China
and the Soviet Union, the over-
throw of the Shah in Iran, the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the establishment of cordial
relations between Israel and
Egypt.

He said that the Chinese-
Soviet break has only served to
make each more suspicious of
the other; the reason the Egyp-
tians and Israelis made peace
was to protect their borders
from outside forces. The over-
throw of the shah was encourag-
ed by our building him up
militarily, said Westmoreland.

‘The United States has got to

make itself more assertive on
international issues,”’ he said.

The Soviet Union is making
major moves in the world
toward expanding its power;
‘the Russians are imperialistic
and make no bones about it,’’ he
said.

Westmoreland said that the
Russians are skillful and alert
to any chance for gain and do
not care about world opinion-
that every move they make,
they provide an excuse for do-
ing it.

‘I feel that the likely targets
of the Soviets, after
Afghanistan, would be

3 W&L Students

Involved In
Texas Inn Scuffle

by Mike Perry

Students visiting the Texas
Inn in Lynchburg may have
more to fear than the possibility
of an upset stomach. Last Fri-
day evening three Washington
and Lee students were involved
in a Skirmish with two uniden-
tified locals and an employee of
the Texas Inn.

The incident began when Jim
Abeloff, a W&L junior, ac-
cidently nudged the elbow of an
unidentified restaurant patron
seated at the counter of the
Texas Inn. The man questioned
Abeloff’s action angrily, accus-
ing Abeloff of attempting to
start a fight. Abeloff apologized
and attempted to explain away
the matter.

Jeff Hamill, one of the W&L
students involved, explained
that the man then ‘‘stood up and
pushed Jim onto the floor,” at
which time Hamill and Will
Hodges, another W&L student,
tackled the man and wrestled
him to the floor.

Immediately after the scuffle
started the cook came out from
behind the counter and _ hit
Hamill in the face while another
unidentified man emptied a
Coke bottle and broke it over
Abeloff’s head.

The two men ran out of the
restaurant and drove off in a
pickup truck. Hamill claims the
Texas Inn cook knows the iden-
tity of the man who hit Abeloff
with the bottle and called him
by his first name.

David Proctor, another W&L
student who witnessed the inci-

-dent, said the cook ‘‘seemed to

know him” (the man who hit
Abeloff with the bottle). When
Proctor asked the cook, ‘‘Is this
the way you keep order in
here?’’ the cook showed Proctor
an automatic pistol he had tuck-
ed in his belt.

When the police arrived at the
scene, Hamill said, ‘‘they
weren't very much help.” Proc-
tor agreed and added that ‘‘the
police had to hear the story 15
times before they would even go
in and talk to the guy with the
gun.”’

When Proctor persisted in
questioning the police about the
cook’s gun, he was told to ‘shut
up or he’d throw me in jail.”’

Later, Cove Geary, another
W&L_ student, witnessed
another incident at the Texas
Inn which did not involve
Washington and Lee students.

Geary Says a group of ‘‘locals
started throwing plates and
glasses behind the counter,”
and in a matter of minutes three
police cars and a paddy wagon
arrived.

Mock Convention Report

 

Rep. John Anderson:
‘A Formidable Task Ahead’

by Mark Birenbaum

As the focus of the Republican presidential
primary process switches from Iowa to New
Hampshire, several things are clear. Among those
has to be the candidacy of John Anderson of Il-
linois.

Mind you, Anderson, the third-ranking
Republican in the House of Representatives, is by
no means a “‘front runner’’ in the horse-race con-
text in which we view the candidates today. And
he even admits that. But, how far behind can any
‘‘horse’’ be so near to the starting gate?

Anderson did not campaign in Iowa, but he did
receive 4.1 percent of the vote of Republican par-
ticipants, according to the New York Times.

Votes aside, perhaps the best thing Iowa, par-
ticularly the Des Moines debates, did for Anderson
was to establish a potential chain reaction. He’s
been noticed: he was the only Republican to state
a position in favor of the President’s grain em-
bargo. People are beginning to realize that Ander-
son is not as' ‘‘liberal’’ as they first thought. And
along with that, people are seeing that he is a
qualified candidate, if such a beast exists.

On social issues, Anderson does seem ‘‘liberal,”’
if professor Hughes will excuse the term. He was:
one of the first Republican representatives to urge
ratification of ERA; he opposes the development
of the B-1 bomber and the neutron bomb; he sup-
ported the Panama Canal treaties, he has co-.
sponsored a program to finance House general
election campaigns, and, along with Rep. Morris
Udall, he has co-sponsored the Alaska Lands Bill,
which will conserve blocs of that state while allow-
ing for responsible development of Alaskan
natural resources.

Anderson stands alone among Republican
Presidential candidates in that he has endorsed
ratification of the Salt II treaty.

Concerning energy, he has proposed a 50 cents
per gallon tax to reduce consumption and was one
of seven House Republicans to vote for President
Carter’s standby gasoline rationing plan.

Anderson’s campaign manager, William G.
Bradford, admits that he has a formidable task
ahead in making people aware of Anderson’s
fiscal conservatism, a record that shows support
for former president Nixon’s ‘‘New Federalism”’
plan.

A bill to limit government spending, authored by
Anderson, would constrain government spending
so that it corresponds only to the rate of national
economic growth, review tax levels annually to
assure that they do not impede economic growth
and require that the President present a balanced
budget to Congress by fiscal 1982.

“I do not believe in the quick fix, the $50 rebate,
the huge surge of spending as a way of suddenly
reversing the economy,’’ Anderson has said.

Bradford characterizes his candidate as a
‘‘Republican who dares to wear his wallet on the
right and his heart on the left.’ Perhaps that
description helps explain Anderson’s 1978 ratings
of 55 percent from Americans For Democratic Ac-
tion and 44 percent from Americans For Constitu-
tional Action.

Whatever, Anderson’s heart has not always
been in the political ventricle where it is today. He
came to Congress in 1961 as a “‘typical Midwestern
conservative,” reports the Congressional Quarter-
ly. He was elected on a platform opposed to ‘‘big
government”’ and communism.

During the 1960’s, ACA hailed Anderson’s record
as one of the most conservative in Congress. “He
stands firm against the liberal processes in Wash.-
ington, the wild spending schemes and the per-
missive society offered by proponents of the Great
Society,”’ was the rhetoric of a 1968 ACA release
endorsing Anderson for re-election.

Over the years, he’s also been loyal to his party.
He backed Nixon’s plan for a re-negotiated settle-
ment in Vietnam, although he publicly stated the
was was ‘“‘the most tragic error in diplomatic and
military policy in our nation’s history.” In 1964, he
supported Sen. Barry Goldwater for president,
and today he can still take ‘‘digs” at Carter and

“the greedy, parochial, self-interested,
democratic Congress.’’ Gerald Ford, Henry Kiss-

inger, Bill Brock and Jack F. Kemp all campaign-
ed for Anderson in his 1978 House campaign.

Anderson’s political chameleon act came in
1968, according to CQ. As a member of the House
Rules Committee, he cast the deciding vote that
sent an open-housing bill to the floor. There, he
was instrumental in swinging several Republican
votes for what eventually became Civil Rights
Law.

In his 1970 autobiography, Between Two
Worlds: A Congressman’s Choice, the first-
generation American of Swedish heritage, wrote
about that vote: ‘‘There came to bear in my think-
ing the realization that even to the point of subor-
dinating something as fundamental as the right of
contract to the even more fundamental principle
of human rights.”’

Religion plays a large role in Anderson’s life. In
1964, he was named the outstanding layman of the
year by the National Association of Evangelicals.
But his heroes, he has said, are Republican
figures. He admires Abe Lincoln for his compas-
sion, Teddy Roosevelt for his dynamism and
Dwight D. Eisenhouer for his tenets of fiscal
responsibility and decentralized government.

Watergate has had a refective effect on him. If
elected, goes the campaign promise, he would use
the presidency to re-establish what he describes
as the nation’s ‘‘vital center,’’ appealing to com-
peting interest groups to work together toward a
common national prupose.

If his deep religious beliefs and his campign
stomping sound similar to a dark-horse candidate
of 1976, another similarity could be the running of
“John who?” ads in New Hampshire. But any
comparison stops there. Anderson has had exten-
sive experience in national government.

He has been a member of the House for 20 years,
Chairman of the House Republican Conference for
11 years and a senior member of the House Rules
Committee. He also has some Foreign Service ex-
perience. As a member of the Ad Hoc House
Energy Committee, he has argued for creation of
an oil-purchasing cartel to deal with OPEC.

On the hill he has established a “reputation as
one of Congress’s best orators and finest minds,”’
according to CQ. The Washington Post has written
that he is ‘‘one of the most highly respected public
servants of any party.’ Even one of his opponents,
Sen. Robert Dole, has called him ‘probably the
brightest of the Republican candidates.” The Des
Moines Register described him as ‘‘a silver-haired
orator with a golden tongue, a 17-jewel mind and a
brass backbone. He is a man of charm, grace and
intellect...’’

Anderson is no stranger to sponsoring bills
either. Last year he was chief sponsor of the
Regulatory Reform Act, legislation which would
benefit both business and consumers by pro-
moting competition and reducing governmental
bureaucracy.

His strategy for the Oval Office in three-phased.

His first concern is to achieve name recognition.
A Gallup poll in September showed that only 20
percent of their respondents recognized his name.
Of course, finances limit his efforts. In September,
Anderson has only one-tenth as much money as
John Connally.

The second phase is to finish in the top two or
three in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, the
top two in Illinois and win in Wisconsin.

The final phase will be to develop a Midwestern
strategy; Anderson has noted that region will send
more delegate votes to the National Convention
than any other region.

‘‘Maybe he thinks in his own mind that he can be
elected President,”” Paul Weyrich, Director of the
Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress,
has said. ‘‘But if he does, he’s not as smart as I
think he is.”

Stranger things have happened in American
politics, according to Bradford. In November, he
commented: “‘If there were only two candidates in
next year’s Republican race, we wouldn’t do well.
But there are more than two. We will have our
whole slice of the pie. Others will have to cut
theirs.

State Chairmen Begin
Search For Delegates

by Sidney Simmons

Although the Mock Conven-
tion is over three months away
state chairmen have already
begun recruiting delegates for
their respective states.

At the real Republican Na-
tional Convention in July there
will be 1994 delegates. Because
of size limitations at Washing-
ton and Lee, delegations will be
‘scaled down to three-fourths of
their real size. This means that
the number of delegates to the
Mock Convention will be around
1495. Each state chairman is
responsible for filling his
delegation with students bet-
ween now and the weeks just
prior to the Convention.

For obvious reasons not every
student will get the opportunity
to be on the delegation of his
choice or on his home state's.
Many of the states from which
there are a large number of
students have rather small
delegations while some very
large delegations have only a
handful of natives.

Each delegate will be issued a
floor pass with his name on it
similar to the real convention,
only those people confirmed or
approved in advance by the
Credentials Committee can par-
ticipate in the convention pro-
cess.

At the Convention only dele-
gates, press, and officials will
be allowed on the floor, Spec-
tators will be confined to seats
at one end of the hall.

Because of students coming
from surrounding schools there
will probably be more people
who would like to participate
then there will be room to ac-
comodate them.

It is important for W&L
students to sign up as delegates
to insure they will be included in
a delegation. Nobody should
assume that because they know
a state chairman they will be
able to get on his delegation.
State Chiarmen are limited by
the size of their delegation and
unfortunately will not be allow-
ed alternate delegates.

To insure your position on a
delegation you should talk to a
state chairman. Lists of the
chairmen and their phone num-
bers are posted around campus.
In the next couple of weeks give
one a call. If his delegation is
closed you will have plenty of
time to look elsewhere. There is
no reason to be left out this May
9 and 10.

Preacher Jack Wows
Them In Cockpit

by Rob Walton

Preacher Jack started play-
ing dive bars in and around the
Boston area after his expulsion
from school in the ninth grade.
He remained in these dive bars
for 20 some-odd years until
George Thorogood
“discovered” him in Boston and
arranged for his singing with
Rounder Records. Rounder is
now promoting Preacher on a
general southern tour for addi-
tional exposure before he starts
his European tour in March.

Preacher’s first album on
Rounder will. also be released
sometime in March. Following
his return from Europe in May,
Preacher will be appearing on
Saturday Night Live.

Preacher Jack is_ finally
receiving the exposure and the
acclaim he has worked so hard
for SO many years.

Preacher's love for ‘Boogie
Woggie’’ rock and roll started in
the ’50’s while he listened to the
likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, now a
personal friend, Little Richard
and Elvis. Preacher claims to
have taken all these great rock
personalities and melted them
down to form his own personali-
ty.

Preacher says that he
depends on the electricity that
develops between himself and
his audience. He sees himself as
the Billy Graham of rock and
roll, bringing Jesus Christ to the
audience through the medium
of rock and roll.

While many members of his
audience may not relate to the
religious aspect of his  per-
formance, there is no denying
his great talent and love for
good old fashioned Rock and
Roll.

‘Menagerie’ Opens Season

“The Glass Menagerie,’ Ten-
nessee Williams’ haunting
memory play, will be
Washington and Lee University
Theatre's first production of the
winter season. The play opens
Monday and continues through
Saturday. The curtain is at 8
each evening for the show,
which will be presented in
W&L’s Boiler Room Theatre, in
the basement level of the Old
Main Street shopping mall in
the center of Lexington.

Leonel L. Kahn, associate
professor of drama _ at
Washington and Lee and head
of the University Theatre for 15
years, will direct the drama.
Scenic design is by Thomas J.
Ziegler.

“The Glass Menagerie’’.open-
ed on Broadway in March 1945,
and was the first major success
for the young Williams and a
brilliant comeback vehicle for
actress Laurette Taylor in the
lead role of Amanda Wingfield.
The play signaled the rise of a
new postwar school of
American drama, in which

Williams was soon joined by a
number of talented new writers
including Arthur Miller and
William Inge. For Williams
himself, the semi-
autobiographical play marked
the start of three decades of
success in the theatre.

In the spotlight for W&L’s
version of the four-character
play are Joellen Bland as
Amanda, the faded Southern
belle still living in a world of
‘gentleman callers’’ and coy
girlishness; Katherine Reiche
as her daughter Laura, a crip-
ple as fragile as the glass or-
naments she collects; John
Fort, a freshman at W&L, as
Amanda’s son Tom, a factory
worker yearning for a better
life; and Grant Kunkowski,
W&L sophomore who played
Hamlet in the successful pro-
duction of that tragedy earlier
this season, as the ‘‘gentleman
caller’’ who is eventually coax-
ed into visiting the Wingfield
home.

Kahn

acknowledges the

Dash’s Movie Review

‘In Search of Historic Jesus’

relative ease of directing such a
small company of actors, and
called the rehearsals for the
show ‘‘great fun.’’ He says that
‘‘like all of Williams’ plays of
the era—‘A Streetcar Named
Desire,’ ‘Summer and Smoke,’
and ‘The Rose Tattoo’—the
beauty of the play is in the
language. The writing is so im-
peccable, and characters so
alive.

“Still, there is a great danger
within that very virtue,’ Kahn
Says. “It is so good a script that
it’s easy to let the play simply
‘run itself’ and miss altogether
the intellectual power hovering
just beneath the surface.”’

The box-office for the produc-
tion is open all this week and
throughout the run of the play.
Tickets are free for all
members of the Washington
and Lee community, and seats
are available for guests at a
small charge. Reservations are
necessary in any case, and
should be made by calling the
theatre at 463-9111, ext. 371.

In Search of Historic Jesus
Directed by Henning Schllerup
Written by Marvin Walk and Jack Jacobs
With John Rubenstein and Bob Crandan

From Summ International, the people who
brought you In Search of Ancient Astronauts, and
In Search of Noah’s Ark, bring you another of their
exciting educational films! The tragedy of it all is
that this thing is sure to make money.

Basically the whole movie revolves around the
shroud of Turin, the linen cloth that Christ is said
to have been buried in that has the image of a man
of it.

What little structure there is to the movie is as
follows: first they try to prove the authenticity of
the Bible by proving the authenticity of the Old
Testament using leftover footage from Noah's
Ark, then they tell the story of Christ and go into
endless speculations as to the missing years of his

life, then some ‘‘experts’’ tell us why the Shroud of
Turin dumbfounds them (one of them actually
says, ’’Here we must leave science behind...!!!’’).

The narrater, Bob Crandan, both looks and talks
like Roger Whitaker. His voice is annoying, he is
constantly summing up what has gone before, he
is constantly making meaningless and moronic
gestures with his hands, and the phony interview
scenes are the worst.

The movie’s methods are, needless to say, less
than scientific. All the ‘‘experts’’ keep saying that
something could have happened one way and ig-
nore all other hypotheses.

And let’s fact it, it’s not history, and it’s not
spectacle. The special effects are poor, the sets
are cheap, and all the actors look like scrubbed-up
hippies. It’s hard to believe that the Roman em-
pire could have been so low-budget.

All I can say is that as far-as finding the historic
Jesus, Cecil B. DeMille came closer.

Intense Marathon Music

by Mark Kinniburgh

It’s always difficult to write after a big weekend,
but this last weekend and the second annual
Washington and Lée Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon was the ultimate killer. | really don’t
think I’ve ever seen a party so big or intense in my
four years here. The music was excellent and
varied all weekend from rock to disco to blue-
grass, each of which kept the dances interested
and moving. My thanks and congratulations go out
to all of the groups, but one in particular caught
my attention as probably the best band to visit
W&L was ‘‘Tracks.’’ Not only did they provide
Super dance tunes, they performed at a profes-
sional level which is rare for a band on the college
circuit. Be prepared to catch them the next time
they come to W&L or UVa, and listen to WLUR for
their tapes. Not to drag on, but these guys are
headed for much bigger things than anyone else
that has ever been here—stay tuned.

Onto a more national setting and new artists
who seem to be coming on very strong, let’s begin
with “The Romantics."’ The draw of this band lies
in the driving 60's rhythm in their songs, usually
accompanied by bright percussion, solid bass
lines, and acoustic guitar. Although their first

album entitled “The Romantics” has not been
released all over the country yet, a special four-
song record has become a very hot item in radio

and retail circles.

“The Pretenders’ are another‘band that has
become a reasonable success with their first
album of eight songs. Led by a female vocalist/
guitarist, The Pretenders play a heavy brand of

distorted music featuring urgent, piercing lyrics.

Although it would seem that the power-pop market

is packed full with less than acceptable sometimes
trashy talent, more bands like the Pretenders are
surfacing literally weekly. Besides the two I have
mentioned, there are Pear! Harbor and the Explo-
sions, The Starjets, The Specials, The Dukes, The
Babys, The Jam Off Broadway, The Rockets and
many more with releases in the last two weeks.
My real gripe abcut all this attention that is being
given to this type of band is that the record com-
panies begin to resemble the big car manufac-
turers in that they are all offering the same pro-
duct under different names. There are few labels
with the coverage to try something new for fear of
short-term economic penalty, but if they would on-
ly realize that the future is in something complete-
ly new, they could insure their companies success
for many years.

Notes: Coming from the Knack this week—their
second album...also this week, new stuff from
Nazareth, David Gates, Warren “Exitable Boy”’
Zevon, Chuck Mangione, Iggy Pop, The Ramones
and others believe me!...Remember the Cowsills?
They just signed with Columbia Records...Cheap
Trick is recording number five in the British West
Indies. ..The Who switched record companies from
MCA to Warner Brothers for an exchange sum of
12 million dollars...The Tom Robinson Band is
reforming in England now to head a “Rock

against Racism” tour...The New J. Giels Band

albumn “Love Stinks’ and the new quote of the
year ‘‘What you need Jim are the latest SEX
FACTS”’...Band name of the week “The Hotmud
Family.” Listen to WLUR-FM.

‘Nyet’ To Moscow

by Bill Whalen

And so it looks like the United States will not par-
ticipate in the 1980 Summer Olympics. What at the
moment seems to be a serious matter will be one day
be placed in the annals of history. For the moment,
let’s forget about the games and concentrate on
something more important—like saving civilization.

My writing on this subject is a sad indication of the
current state of international sports. Gone are the
days when the countries of the world could convene in
an internationally neutral site and play games for a
couple of weeks. Instead, welcome to the world of
“realpolitik” and its partner: ‘‘realsport.”’

Yes, “‘realsport’’: that wonderful game where per-
formances are secondary to political issues. But don’t
blame just the Communists for this problem; it’s a
crime that’s been committed by more than one party.

Remember the 68 Games in Mexico City? Before
the Games even started, there were bloody riots in the
streets. Of course, none of the problems were noticed
until the two American medalists gave the Panther
salute during the playing of our national anthemn.

The Munich Games continued the Olympic slide.
The terrorists’ attack will always come to mind first,
but how many of you still remember the controversy
involving Rhodesia and the possible withdrawl of 20
other African nations? Lord knows what would have
happened had not Rhodesia been expelled.

The ’76 Games did not pass without controversy
either. For one, Canada refused to recognize Taiwan
as the “‘real’’ China. Uganda was not present because
of the antics of ‘“‘Big Daddy”’ Amin, preventing the ap-
pearance of John Akii-Bua, winner of the 400-meter
hurdles race at Munich.

And now we have come to Moscow.

It’s the year 1980 and the Russians are on the move,
the United States is beefing up its forces and Ar-
magedon does not seem too far around the corner.

And all we can argue about is sports.

O.K,, let’s talk about it. For example, who’s to
blame? How about Jimmy Carter? Sure, why not, it
was his idea anyway.

What about the United States Olympic Committee?
After all, they went along with the President’s idea.

What about the Russians themselves? They started
the entire controversy by invading Afghanistan.

I personally like to question the International Olym-
pic Committee. First of all, they had the stupidity to
put the Games in Moscow. If the Games represent the
“spirit of universal friendship,’, they why place it in
an oppressive, tyrannical state?

Who are these senile gentlemen trying to fool? The
world as we know cannot simply stop everything and
jock around for two weeks.

To avoid anymore of these boycotts why not place
both the Winter and Summer Olympics in a neutral
place on a permanent basis, such as Geneva,
Switzerland?

' Of course, my solution will do no good. They Olym-
pics will almost always be marred by politics and con-
flicting ideologies. Perhaps the Olympics should be
stopped completely. Do we have such a “jock men-
tality” that we are only concerned with athletics at a
time when your future and mine are in doubt?

And when there is world-wide peace and the prac-
tice of ‘‘realpolitik’’ has been stopped, then we can ap-
preciate the Olympics.

But at the moment, both “‘peace”’ and the idea of the
Olympics are both myths from a world we no longer
live in.

There was a lesson to be
learned in Warner Center last
Tuesday night. The subject was
defense, and the instructor was
the W&L basketball squad.

The Generals did such a good
job of instructing that they held
Emory & Henry to 50 points (the
lowest allowed this season by
W&L), held the Wasp’s league
leading scorer Chuck Ogle to
nine points (his average is 22.0
points) and subdued Emory &
Henry, 66-50.

‘Tonight we played some ex-
cellent team defense, the best in
a couple of years,”’ said Coach
Verne Canfield.

The win was the second in a
row for the Generals, coming on
the heels of an 87-74 win over
Bridgewater last Saturday
night. Junior: center Rob
Smitherman. scored 17 points,
yet the big story was freshman
forward Brian Hansen’s 20
points and 11 rebounds.

Prior to the Bridgewater
game, W&L had lost to Gettys-
burg College, 66-59. Despite im-
pressive showings’ by
sophomore guards George
Spears and Clark New (who net-
ted 17 and 10 points, respective-
ly), a defensive lapse late in the
second half cost the Generals
the game.

Against Emory & Henry there
were no lapses.

‘We never let them get their
spots to shoot from,”’ said Can-
field. ‘‘We kept fresh men on
Ogle and R.J. (Scaggs, junior
forward) did an especially good
job on defense.”’

The pace of the entire game
was slow, as W&L’s defense
forced Emory & Henry away

two minutes separated some.

baskets, but W&L grabbed con-
trol of the game early and never
trailed.

 

tenacious man-to-man
os spurred on the offen-
sive effort. Said Canfield, ‘‘We
used our defense to help us
score.”

The leading scorer for the
Generals was senior forward
Tom Jeffries. Jeffries scored 19
points and grabbed several re-
bounds, coming alive for W&L
after several sub-par games.
Spears was the other big man
for the Generals with 12 points.

For the night, the Generals
shot 56% from the field and 83%
from the line.

will occur tonight when the
Generals face Roanoke.

The last time the Generals
faced Roanoke was _ last
December 3, with W&L winding
up on the short end of a 77-67
score.

Canfield comments’ on
Roanoke: ‘‘We must maintain
the same defensive intensity
and we must be especially
careful to box out on the
boards.”

Says Canfield, ‘‘We want to
show that we are still a part of
the ODAC race.. We want to
show that the rest of the league

Indoor Track Opens At VMI

The Washington and Lee in-
door track team open a four-
meet 1980 season on Saturday,
Feb. 2, when the Generals
travel across town to par-
ticipate in the VMI Relays.

W&L will join 30-35 colleges
and universities in the event,
which begins at 12:00 p.m. in
the VMI Field Houso.

Coach Norris Aldridge, in his
ninth year as track coach, and
second-year assistant Frank
Miriello will try to direct the
squad toward an improvement
over last year’s third-place
showing in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Champion-
ships.

Toward this goal, Aldridge
and Mireillo count on the per-
formance and leadership of tri-
captains Steward Atkinson,
Richard Bird and Paul Hendry.

Atkinson leads the W&L
sprint department, running the
60-yard dash and the 440 mile-
relay events. Bird, a four-year
letterman in cross country,
runs the mile and half-mile
races. Hendry specializes in the
high jump.

Although the graduation of
1979 standouts and_ school

 

record holders Jack Norberg,
Phil Dunlay, and Norville Scott
left holes in the W&L line-up,
the Generals have men ready to

step in.

Joining Atkinson in the
sprints will be juniors Chris
Leiser and Jeff Brown. Impor-

_ tant weight men should be

senior Mike Mrlik, juniors Chip
Nunley, Larry Davis, Tony
Walker, and sophomore Buz
Manning.

Seniors Bob Campbell and
Hamilton Davis will man the
pole-vault event. Junior Chris
Daniel will join Bird in the
middle-distance running.

This season’s ODAC meet, the
final event on the W&L
schedule, is set for Feb. 23 at
Lynchburg College.

Gross Earns Top Award | 7, door Soccer

In Wrestling Tourney

by Chris Sisto
Led by captain Ray Gross,
the Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team finished third in its
own tournament here last
Saturday.

The Generals completed the
day with 43.5 points while
Catawba of N.C. finished first
with 70.25 points. Lynchburg
College came in second with a
score of 68.25 points.

In the eight-team tourna-
ment, four Generals finished in
the top four spots, Three
players, Ed Rodgers, Joe
Wallace and Gross, made it to
the finals. Rodgers and Gross
came away with the top honors.

Gross finished the day with a
perfect 3-0 record, after a 14-4
win in the 142-pound final. He
was also named the tourna-
ment’s Most Valuable Wrestler.

Rodgers also capped off his
perfect day with a 10-7 win in
the 167-pound final.

In the unlimited weight class,
Joe Wallace finished second.

Another General, Mike
Deighan, finished in fourth
place in the 134 weight class.
The only other General that had
a win was Les Heart, who
finished 1-2 at 177.

Head Coach Gary Franke felt
his team finished about where
he had expected, saying, ‘‘Our

players did the best _per-
formance they possibly could
have done.”

Earlier in the week, the
Generals lost to their ODAC
rival, Lynchburg College, 33-19.
This is the first time the
Generals have lost to Lynch-
burg in the six years they have
wrestled them.

According to Franke, the
reason for the loss was. that
Lynchburg has a better balanc-
ed lineup and the Generals have
suffered so many __ injuries.
Perhpas not coincidentally, the
only Generals to have wins

against Lynchburg were the
Same ones who won in the tour-
nament.

Deighan and Gross won on
points while both Rodgers and
Wallace had pins. The team’s
current lineup has_ several
players that simply need more
experience.

Franke says, ‘“‘We have
several young players from
whom we can’t expect too many
big things right away.

The Generals next competi-
tion will be the Pembroke In-
vitational Tournament on
Saturday.

Westmoreland On Soviet Strategy

Yugoslavia after the death of
Tito, Pakistan and Iran,’’ he
speculated.

A 1921 treaty the Russians
have with Iran could be a good
excuse for a Soviet invasion of
the pretense on restoring order,
the general said.

“If the Russians continue to
move through that section of the
world, our oil supply could be
affected and that would be a
severe blow to us,’’ he said.

Westmoreland said that 40
percent of the world’s oil supply
flows through the strait of Hor-
muz and the Russians are only
“one country away’’ and have
military bases only 400 miles
from the strait.

“‘We should not be naive; we
should be aware of the moves
the Russians are making and
should develop a strategy to

face possible developments,
he said.

The former General said that
the attack on Pearl Harbor was
an event that helped pull our
country together and _ that
perhaps we should look upon the
events in Afghanistan and Iran
as a “new Pearl Harbor inci-
dent” and try to pull ourselves

~ back into national unity.

“Russia is seen international-
ly as an internally disciplined
country and the American
society is seen as being un-

disciplined,” he said and added
that, ‘‘there must be a change in
attitude in this country that
starts immediately ; we must be
persistent in the pursuit of in-
ternational respectability.”

‘As we look to the future, we
must recycle old ideals such as
those held by George
Washington and Robert E. Lee.
If we set our moral standards as
highly as those men, we can
regain the international respec-
tability that we once enjoyed,”
he said.

Finds Success

Soccer at Washington and Lee
is more than just a fair-weather

sport.

When the fall season ends and
the winter winds begin to blow,

head Coach Rolf Piranian and ~

the Generals simply pack up the
balls, trade cleats for tennis
shoes, shrink the goals and
move inside. The result: a
three-month indoor soccer
season which keeps everybody
kicking until pleasant weather
returns in the spring.

“It’s part of our concept of a
year-round soccer program,”
explains Piranian, now in his
fifth year at W&L. ‘‘We main-
tain winter and_ spring
schedules so our players cah
keep in touch with the game
while they’re at W&L.”’

The highlights for the 1980
“winter season”’ are a pair of
indoo!’ tournaments. The first,
which takes place on Saturday,
is the third annual W&L College
Indoor Soccer Classic. The sec-
ond, which is scheduled for
February 23, is the W&L High
School Classic.

This season’s college tourna-
ment will feature eight teams:
George Mason University,
Davidson College, Western
Maryland College, West
Virginia Wesleyan, two squads
from W&L, and the Roxborough
(Philadelphia, Pa. YMCA.

The teams, which will be
divided into four-team divi-
sions, will compete in a round-

AIRC EE
RAR Re ARPOEN rp

  

robin format for the champion-
ship.

“These tournaments are the
life of the indoor season,” Pira-
nian relates. “‘It’s nearly im-
possible to schedule regular
matches but we’ve found that
there’s plenty of interest for
tournaments on both the college
and high school levels.”’

Indoor soccer, of course, is
not simply the outdoor variety
moved under a roof. The goal
mouth is smaller (seven feet
high by ten feet wide)) the
“field” is smaller, (60 feet by
110 feet); each team has six
players (including the
goalkeeper) and’ substitutions
are made on the ‘“‘fly’’ (similar
to ice hockey). One game runs
30 minutes.

“The result is a quick, ex-
citing game,’’ says Piranian.
“Since the action is virtually
non-stop, it’s just as demanding
and just as intense as outdoor
soccer.”

Dance-a-thon Great Success;
Strong Student Involvement

(continued from page one)
including a bubble-gum blowing
contest, a ‘hairy legs’ contest,
a mini-concert by ‘Southern
Comfort,’ W&L’'s informal
singing group, and disco lessons
by a local dance instructress.

And there were the ever-
popular ‘‘pie throws,”’ in which
several W&L professors and
other notables volunteered to
act as targets for cream pies,
the honor to go to the highest
bidder. A new record was set
this year when Dan N. Murphy,
assistant dean of students and
coordinator of fraternity af-
fairs, fetched a price of $90.
Close behind were Dean of

‘Students Lewis G. John at $82,
journalism professor Hampden
H. Smith at $50, and politics pro-
fessor Edward L. Pinney at $45.

Another highlight of the
marathon was the appearance
of eight-year-old Rhonda Dee
Adkins of Lynchburg, this
year’s MD Poster Child from
southwest Virginia, who stayed
on the scene until the final
dollar figure was announced.
Also present was native Lex-
ingtonian Jim Fuller, a
muscular dystrophy patient
who supported the students
from their earliest planning ses-
sions last year, and designed

the logo that was used suc-
cessfully in publicizing last
year’s dance marathon.

W&L_ student involvement
was extended well beyond the
150 dancers on the floor; for
every one of them, there was at
least one student counterpart
adding up receipts, serving
refreshments or selling tickets.
And with an audience of nearly
750 people crowding Evans Din-
ing Hall at times, the marathon
rivaled W&L’s annual Dancy
Dress Ball in terms of wall-to-
wall people.

The close of this year’s
marathon was both a jubilant
and poignant moment for co-
chairman Blumberg, who saw
tho event through its earliest
Stages two years ago. He has
spent both years’ 30-hour ses-
sions as master of ceremonies
capering on the stage in full tux-
edo dress and urging the
dancers to stay awake, (In fact,
another college has already
asked him to perform the same
duties later this year at its
dance benefit. )

“The let-down is starting to
set in now,” he admitted on the
day after the dance, ‘‘and it’s
going to be incredibly tough to
leave this behind after two
years of work. At the risk of

Piranesi
Etchings
At duPont

Giovanni Battista Piranesi,
an 18th-century Venetian ar-
chitect whose professional
dreams were never materializ-
ed in a republic already in
decline, is the subject of a new
exhibition in Washington and
Lee University’s duPont
Gallery beginning Monday,
Feb. 4.

In all, 25 etchings are includ-
ed in the show, entitled ‘‘Prints
by Piranesi,’’ co-sponsored by
W&L’s fine arts department
and the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts.

Born in 1720, Piranest came
from a family of stonemasons
and architectural experts, and
as aresult, his education follow-
ed those lines.

The duPont exhibition
includes many of his most noted
projects, including a sketch of
the ‘‘Temple of Apollo’’ and the
“View of the Sepulchral Room
of Lazarus.”

Gallery hours are 9 to 4 each
weekday. There is no admission
charge for the show, which
follows the widely attended
showing of photography by Lex-
ington’s Michael Miley. The
Miley exhibit will close Satur-
day, Feb. 2.

Carmicheal Calls |

For Revolution

(continued from page 1)

He said the American capital-
ist system has reduced students
from having critical minds,
adding that a student needs a
critical outlook so he doesn’t
lose perspective in the world
around him.

‘African students must
understand that they have a
responsibility to organize their
people to fight the oppression,”’
Carmichael said.

In this fight, Carmichael told
them to, ‘‘never look for the
easiest road.”’

“The capitalist system has
taught us to take the road of
least resistance, but we must
look for the roughest road and
fight in any way that is
necessary,” he said.

He said, ‘“‘Those who don’t see
need for the cause have been
blinded by the capitalists.”

Evans

‘To Speak ©

Robert Evans, CBS News cor-
respondent and Moscow bureau
chief for the network, will ap-
pear at Washington and Lee
University next Thursday, Feb.
7, to speak on the topic ‘‘Oil Is
Power.”’ The address is part of
the W&L_ student . body’s
speakers’ series, ‘‘Contact,”
dealing this year with the
dangers and complexities of
current U.S. foreign policy.

In addition to his duties as a
newsman, Evans is well known
as a film and television pro-
ducer.

Evans’ speech will begin at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. It will be
preceded by a reception at 5
p.m. at Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, 205 E. Washington
St. The public is invited to at-
tend both events.

   
 
  

A contradicting factor to the
gaining of their freedom, ac-
cording to Carmichael, is the
Democratic Party.

“Ever since the 60’s_ the
Democratic Party has been
fooling African masses into see-
ing quantitative progress, but
no qualitative progress: our
legislative power in Washington
was almost nothing in the 60's—
now we have a greater repre-
sentation, but still not enough to
be strong at all,”’ he said.

He said the problems in the
1980’s_ must be solved by
qualitative change, a change he
sees as revolutionary.

“This revolutionary change
must be accomplished by the
masses; history is made by
masses of the people,” Car-
michael said.

“The capitalist sytem has
taught us and let it be thought
that history is made by indivi-
duals like George Washington.
George Washington didn’t beat
the British—it was the support
of the masses that did it,’’ he
said.

“Any people, under any con-
ditions, who are oppressed, will
fight to be free because freedom
is innate and_ instinctively
understood, but,’’ he added, ‘‘it
must be governed by reason.”’

The draft was done away with
by the black people, he said,
because it was they who were
the ones getting drafted
because they were the poorest.

“Johnson tried to maintain
the draft, but it fell apart in the
end because we united and
made it do so; now Carter
wants to bring the draft back
in—Carter’s crazy!’ Car-
michael heatedly said.

He asserted that every war in
American history the blacks
fought in, they got nothing in
return.

‘After the American Revolu-
tion, we were still slaves, and
even after Vietnam, we still
couldn’t find jobs,”’ he said.

‘In the 80's we must get the
masses together and fight and
remember that the secret of life
is to fear nothing,’ he said.

EC Hears Contact Com. Procedures|

(continued from page 1)

Blumberg asked Ridge and
Harpole if they could find so-
meone more responsible.

The EC also. voted
unanimously to have Weiss ap-
pear at the next EC meeting
and explain the incident.

During most of the SAB
report several EC members
pumped away at calculators.

Contact was also called
before the BC Monday night to
explain some of its procedures.
The central question posed by
the EC was the composition of
and role played by the Contact
Committee.

Contact Co-Chairmen Chan-
ning Hall and Scott Cardoza
were on hand to explain their
committee’s activities.

Cardoza said prospective
committee members submitted
applications. He told the EC 20
applications were received and

that he and Hall tried to pick ex- —

perienced upperclassmen and
some underclassmen.

‘We tried to get some people
who were underclassmen to
carry the program on,” said
Cardoza.

He added that a majority of
the people selected had been in-
volved with Contact last year or
spoke to him last spring.

Cardoza said he did not get in
touch with all applicants and
agreed with a suggestion from
Bob Willis, Junior Represen-
tative, that Contact Co-
Chairmen send a letter to all ap-
plicants, whether the applicants
get on the committee or not.

Hall told the EC that Commit-
tee members put up posters and
bulletins, make arrangements
for speakers, hand out bulletins
at Contact presentations and
help write preview articles
about speakers.

Abraham asked the Co-
Chairmen how they select
speakers.

“We kick around some
names,” said Hall. ‘“‘Then we
make a !ot of calls to various
agencies and ask them about
speakers on various topics.”’

The list of possible speakers
dwindles as price and
availability are investigated,
explained Cardoza.

Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould asked Hall and
Cardoza if they had considered

conducting a poll among the
students to determine areas of
interest.

‘Suggestions -+un from’
Playboy ‘Playmate of the
Year’ to Henry Kissinger,’’

said Cardoza. He explained that
Kissinger is too expensive.

‘“T guess what I had in mind
was a list of five people who you
could get an opinion about,”’
said Ould. .

Cardoza told the Committee
that most of this year’s
speakers have been booked, but
added that Ould’s suggestions
should be made to next year’s
Co-Chairmen.

Jay Blumberg asked Cardoza
if he thought Contact should
have greater variety.

“The complaints last year
were the opposite,’ Cardoza
said.

- “Contact was originally made
as a Symposium,”’ he explained.

Willis and Senior Represen-
tative Dee Keesler commended
Cardoza and Hall on their selec-
tion of topic, but expressed con-
cern over Contact’s scheduling.

‘‘T don’t think you could have
picked a better topic, but I think
the problem is the scheduling of
the program,”’ said Willis.

“IT must commend you on
your stretching the money and
making it go a long way,” said
Keesler.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole said Contact might be
able to generate more interest
in its program if it had a
speaker in the fall.

Willis suggested that Contact
and the Mock Convention get
together so they do not book
overlapping speakers. _

The EC also expressed in-
terest in Contact’s providing
more publicity for its program.

‘Jay mentioned putting up a
poster with the theme and
speakers sponsored by Con-
tact,” Ould said.

Hall and Cardoza said they
will get a poster made.

After hearing reports from
several clubs to which it gave
money in the fall, the EC

discussed revisions of the
pamphlet which explains
plagiarism.

When the EC finishes debate
on the pamphlet, it will
distrubute copies of the revision
around campus to see what

students think about the
changes.

Willis and Keesler, who have
worked with faculty members
on the revised pamphlet, said
the new one would be shorter
and more relevant than the pre-
sent edition, which is 15-years-
old.

The EC approved three ques-
tions for a questionnaire, to be
conducted on the phone, about
co-education at Washington and
Lee.

EC Vice President Les Cotter
and Blumberg said they think
the survey, which will be con-
ducted on 10 percent of W&L
students, should be accurate.

The Fencing Club reported to
the EC on the large expenses it
faces and the steps it is taking
to meet those expenses.

Colt Puryear, who spoke for
the club, said it is holding a raf-
fle to raise money and has also
received donations.

He said the Club will need
more money if it is going to con-
tinue.

The Fencing Club can apply
for intercollegiate competition
next year, but it cannot play
matches in the Warner Center.

“Dick Miller will not let us
use the gym for home meets,”
said Puryear.

Poole told Puryear that the
University Athletic Committee
might be able to help the team
get permission to play in the
sym.

Alex Richards gave a detailed
five-page report to the EC and
requested more money.

“IT would like to commend
Alex for getting the show on the
road,” said Abraham.

“The attitude and morale of
the team has improved ten-
fold,” said Richards.

The EC said it will consider
Richard's request at its next
meeting.

IFC Reminds Frats
To Get Act Together

by Ross Newell

Washington and Lee’s Inter-
fraternity Council, Tuesday
night, reminded fraternities
that it is time to get their act
together for the administration.

Inspection checklists are due
in Dean Danny N. Murphy’s of-
fice at 4p.m. today. Syd Farrar,
IFC President, said spot inspec-
tions are scheduled for this Fri-
day. Fraternities that fail the
inspection are usually placed on
social probation.

However, recently some
fraternities have appealed their
probation and won reversals
from the Student Affairs Com-
mittee because they claimed
that they were not aware that
the checklists were due. Farrar
said that the committee will no
longer consider appeals based
on this excuse.

Also, fraternities received
from the administration this
fall a list of projects designed to
improve the houses’ exterior
appearance. A letter detailing
the progress made on the top
priority project is due in Mur-
phy’s office at 4 p.m. Friday.
Farrar said that if no progress
has been made the letter should
detail the reasons for this lack
of progress.

In another matter, the IFC
repeated its stance on hazing of
fraternity pledges. Farrar said
that a second fraternity has
been questioned on pledging ac-
tivities and that all fraternties
should be aware of the IFC haz-
ing rules before they conduct in-
itiation rituals.

Finally, a spokesman for the
dance marathon committee
thanked fraternities for thier
help in making the event a suc-
cess. Kegs donated by frater-
nities were important in helping
to defray the costs of the

 

marathon, the spokesman said.
_ During the marathon, the
IFC, through Farrar, was the
highest bidder, $45. on a pie
thrown at Edward L. Pinney, a
politics professor. Farrar said
he got a good shot at Pinney ad-
ding that the professor fired
back at him and left a substan
tial portion of the pie in his hair

Four W&L
Seniors In

Competition

Four seniors in Washington
and Lee University’s School of
Commerce, Economics and
Politics—Robert Marshall Mer-
riman Jr., Raymond Charles
Nugent, Mark Grahame Walker
and David Walter West—will
form one of 24 collegiate teams
competing in the 15th annual
computer-simulation business

"REVIEW and OUTLOOK.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On Banning Bands

Yesterday’s Univereity Council meeting raised a
number of disturbing questions. The purpose of the
UC meeting was to consider two Student Affairs Com-
mittee proposals: the first, prohibiting live bands at
fraternity parties during weeknights; and the second,
banning live bands in the Cockpit on weeknights.
Members of SAC and the UC speaking in favor of the
proposals to ban live bands were clutching at straws
in an attempt to legislate a change in student at-
titudes at Washington and Lee.

There is a feeling among many faculty members of
the faculty that students at W&L do not believe in the
academic purposes of college life and those faculty
members are casting about in an attempt to locate the
possible sources where they think the problem
manifests itself. The primary attack has been on the
fraternities, of course. But when the students find
other diversions that are not deemed by the wise ones
as befitting their impression of what students should
be, those diversions are also attacked.

But mainly the fraternities are attacked, and their
chief assailant has been Dr. Merchant, a member of
the SAC, the UC, and now, faculty advisor to the Inter-
fraternity Council. Few faculty members have mat-
ched the zeal which Dr. Merchant has demonstrated
in attacking the fraternities—a circumstance which
brings to mind some important questions. Should Dr.
Merchant, who has proven himself opposed to frater-
nity social aotivities, be advisor to the body which
legislates and passes judgment on fraternity con-
duct? Did the fraternity representatives to the IFC
realize what they were doing when Dr. Merchant was
named IFC advisor? Is there a conflict of interest for

Dr. Merchant to represent the faculty position in SAC _

meetings and the fraternity position in IFC matters
when they are seemingly in conflict? It seems ironic
to us that a professor who has consistently taken a
hardline stand against W&L’s fraternities should be
named as the advisor to the entire fraternity system.

Even more disturbing, possibly embarrassing, was
the conduct of IFC President Syd Farrar. Earlier this
year Farrar’s IFC mishandled a discipline case in-
volving several members of the same fraternity. The
students should have been sent to the Student Control

Committee and not received additional punishment

from the SAC. But they did, and their fraternity
brothers were punished for the actions of a few
members who were not acting on the house’s behalf.

Just what is the position of the IFC President in this
matter of the bands ban? This is not easily answered.
In the SAC meeting Farrar voted in favor of the two
proposals; that is he voted against the fraternities he
supposedly represents. But in the open public meeting
yesterday Farrar opposed the fraternity bands ban
and abstained on the Cockpit bands ban—a very dif-
ferent reaction from his voting posture when alone
with administration and faculty members at the SAC
meeting.

Frankly, we don’t know what to make of Farrar’s
voting shifts, which seem motivated by the audience
he is playing to. We cannot ascertain to whom Farrar
owes his allegiance—the faculty and administration
or the students who elected him IFC President. He
told us last night that he voted in favor of the bands
ban at the SAC meeting because of ‘‘a bargain,’’ but
he would not elaborate. Unfortunately, this whole in-
cident has made Farrar look like a puppet of the ad-
ministration. We imagine that several IFC represen-
tatives will have some very pointed questions to ask
their President about his turnaround voting habits.

Letter To

The Editor

 

SAB Meetings Are Not ‘A Circus’

Dear Editor,

I found your article last week
on the conduct of SAB meetings
to be very interesting. The arti-
cle quoted Jay Blumberg as
saying “The (SAB) meetings
are run like a circus, they are
very unorganized and there
could be some improvement.”’

Although I am a freshmen
and probably can’t grasp all the
intricate workings of student

Persiflage

 

government, I fail to see how
the EC and more specifically
Jay Blumberg could possibly
know whether our meetings are
“‘unorganized”’ or not.

I make this statement to br-
ing to your attention the atten-
dance record of the EC repre-
sentative to the SAB, Jay
Blumberg. To the best of my
knowledge, Jay Blumberg nor
any EC representative has been
at an SAB meeting since the
first of November.

Unless Jay Blumberg has
some divine gift that permits
him to monitor our meetings
without his presence and that
we mere mortals know nothing
about, I believe that regular at-
tendance by the EC represen-
tative would reveal a method to
our madness.

I am neither confirming nor
denying the alleged ‘‘unorganiz-
ed’’ conduct of our meetings,
but I am saying that we get

A Sense Of Sacrifice

I’m amazed and shocked by
some of the reactions I have
heard from my fellow students
concerning Mr. Carter’s an-

nouncement of the possibility of’

registration for the draft.

No sooner does the President
hop off the tube that people
around here start planning
vacations to Canada, Old frac-
tures start to hurt again. Feet
that were fine for dancing just
last weekend suddenly seem
flat. Pre-meds become popular
as students want to know,
hypothetically of course, the
least damaging method of pass-
ing a bullet through one’s foot.

Even the surrounding girls’
schools are not immune to this
new spirit. The forces of pink
and green have, for the most
part, reaffirmed their desire to
spend a happy existence bring-
ing up baby and spending Dad-
dy’s and/or  husband’s
paycheck. The Equal Rights
Amendment, not so long ago a
popular battle-cry, seems to
have vanished with the know-
ledge that there is no
Papagallos section of the Army

Phi Needs

Writers
The Ring-tum Phi needs

writers in all departments: news,
sports, entertainment, and
features. If you are interested in
joining the staff, please come by
the office on the second floor of
the University Center, Rm. 205,
between 5-6 pom. Monday or Tues-
day of next week,

In short, no one seems willing
to pay the price of maintaining
freedom and democracy in our
society. There is no sense of
responsibility of sacrifice. Peo-
ple are just out after their own
self-interest.

Well, I’m sick of that sort of
attitude. I’m willing to do my
part. Why, if my asthma wasn’t
so bad, I’d probably enlist to-
day. As it is, however, I’ll do
what I can, Even though I can’t

serve actively, I can help out.

If a draftee’s wife or girl-
friend is lonely, I’ll comfort her.
If they need people to serve on
the draft boards, I’ll be there.
Bonds to finance the fight? I’ll
buy more than my share from
the wages I'll receive in the
opened-up job market.

I’m willing to do my part in
keeping this great country go-
ing, Isn’t it about time that you
make the same commitment?

To the Editor,

Who decides what a store
sells? The letter in the Ring-
tum Phi last week from J.
Cabell Acree highlighted the
primary problem and pleasure
of all store managers. Cabell
Acree is right that the customer
should have a say (with his
money) in what is sold. But
behind that lies the standard
and image which the manager
sets for the establishment
he/she runs. ;

Certainly, nobody can stock
everything, so from the beginn-
ing, choice and discrimination
set in. A gathering of college
store managers can talk—even
shout—round the clock about
what to place on sale in their
stores. What sells, yes, but

 

To Hangings Complaint

there is a point beyond which...
It is a matter of taste and quali-
ty.
In books, the crisis is over
obscenity. (Not that I think the
banner will upset Cabell Acree
is obscene, it seems to me just
tacky). Even the Supreme
Court has a crack at obscenity.
“Of no redeeming literary,
social or intellectual merit”’
was their guideline in the Miller
decision. So it is up to the
managers to’set their own stan-
dards of quality for the kind of
store they want to run. We keep
an eye on that bottom line, but
we won’t be trashy about it.

As so often, Oscar Wilde said
it best: “There is no such thing
as obscenity, there is only bad
taste.”’

Letters To The Editor

Bookstore Manager Responds

Is Syd Farrar ‘Passing The Buck’?

To The Editor,

I would like to comment on the IFC meeting of
Monday, Jan. 21. I was not at the meeting but I did
read the Ring-tum Phi account on Thursday of
that week. I am assuming that the Phi story is cor-
rect.

The Judicial Board of the IFC heard a case
where two Fiji’s threw snowballs at the Pika
house, resulting in some broken windows. The Fi-
ji’s then became the subject of return fire from the
Pika house, which consisted of snowballs and
pellets from a BB gun. The Fiji’s entered the Pika
house to find the person who was firing the BB gun
and a fight ensued. The Fiji’s were shown the door
and they proceeded to their house to round up
some ‘‘brothers,”’ at which time the mustered Fiji
group marched back to the Pika house. Police
were called to the scene to prevent a fight at the
Pika house.

Syd Farrar, president of the IFC, commented at
the Judicial Board meeting that since no fight ac-
tually broke out between the two groups, the case

was not within the jurisdiction of the IFC. He sug-
gested that it was a matter for the Student Control
Committee.

Is Syd Farrar serious or is he merely passing
the buck? Does the IFC need a couple of smashed
faces or a broken limb or two before it can pass
judgment on an altercation of this nature?
Regardless of whether blows were exchanged or
not, is this the type of conduct the IFC condones
for fraternity members (or for anybody )?

I would suggest that one would not need a J.D.
degree to understand that the behavior of these
people is not consistent with any code of conduct in
a civilized society. If the IFC continues to neglect
the responsibility of insuring at least civilized
behavior from fraternity members, then the
fraternity system is destined to continue in the
descending spiral it is now in. If Syd Farrar is
merely passing the buck, then why bother with
having an IFC at all?

 

 

“More On

Dear Sir:

I have delayed writing this
letter in the hope that someone
else would address the issue.
Seeing that no one else has, it is
my hope that you will print this
letter despite its anonymity.
Unfortunately, I am in a posi-
tion where it is best that no one
can identify this as my opinion.
I should note, however, that I do
not personally know any of the
people I am about to discuss.

I am writing in regard to the
‘‘Boxwood Incident.’’ I am not
writing about the severity of the
penalty, for I am not a party to
all the facts and cannot act as
judge and jury. I am writing to
express my displeasure with
the way the problem was handl-
ed by the University Communi-
ty.
Several W&L students (I use
the term ‘‘students’’ and not
“basketball players’’) were in-
volved in some vandalism on
campus. The Student Control
Committee handled the matter
in its usual manner, and punish-
ed the students. In addition, the
Athletic Committee also took
the matter into consideration,
and handed out an additional

penalty.

A quick glance at the Student

Handbook will evidence that the
Athletic Committee has only a
general power to offer advice.
On the other hand, the Student
Control Committee was specifi-
cally established to control stu-
dent conduct.

The SCC’s jurisdiction ex-
tends to any University related
activity, and it may impose any
one or more of an extensive list
of penalties. These penalties in-
clude prohibiting participation
in any athletic event. (See
Penalty (d), page nine of the
1979-1980 Student Handbook. )

It is clear that the SCC was
established to handle student
misconduct such as the ‘‘Box-
wood Incident.’”’ It is not so
clear that the Athletic Commit-
tee was intended to have juris-
diction over student misconduct
of this nature.

Admittedly, the Athletic Com-

ro mo Me Oe He Oe

‘ might be

1094 Wh Ow Oe Oe ee ee

The Handling Of The Boxwood

mittee has an interest in the out-
come, but the SCC is more
suited to finding the facts and
less likely to be influenced by
outside pressure. The Athletic
Committee should have yielded
to the SCC.

Although I believe this was a
matter for Student Control, the
Athletic Committee’s assump-
tion of jurisdiction would not
bother me as much if they were
the only committee involved.
Only one organization should
have retained jurisdiction, and
that organization should have
had exclusive power to dispose
of the matter.

The result of concurrent
jurisdiction over punishment is
that the students are placed in
the position of continually
defending their actions. Such
double jeopardy was outlawed
by the U.S. Constitution
because of the inherent pro-
bability of vengeful punish-
ment. I think it is obvious that
the additional penalty was no
more than an extra kick in the
behind to make sure the
students felt it.

What is there to stop the
Library Committee from ex-
cluding these students from
entering the library, or the
Mock Convention Steering Com-
mittee from excluding © these
students from its activities? If
the Athletic Committee can
have its turn at the students,
why can’t everyoneelse?. ..

I’m sure that the Athletic
Committee can make some sort
of argument that if the students
can’t behave at W&L, they they
won’t behave on the road, But
this reasoning is only, good
enough to suspend them from
away games. No matter how it
rationalized, the
Athletic Committee imposed an
additional punishment.

I keep referring to, the
Athletic Committee’s decision,
but it was really (at least
ultimately) President Huntley’s
decision. No one overruled the
SCC. The President did how-
ever, sidestep the SCC. This of
course enhances his image with

eter ae®

 

the Alumni and the faculty as a

stern administrator, but his ac-

tions are also a statement of no
confidence in the SCC.

President Huntley reacted to

, public opinion, and very neatly

avoided a confrontation with

students by using another com-

~ mittee as a cover. (It’s even

- questionable . whether’ the
- Athletic Committee had such
- broad power). He did overrule
G the SCG, although not express-
2 ly; his actions cut into the SCC’s
~ power, .

; If you do not see President
« Huntley’s action as a threat to
, your ‘student’ irights, you are
‘ probably not alone. The Presi-
dent has only taken away a tiny
little bit of the SCC’s power.
This loss may never hurt you,
but it has hurt your fellow
students. They have had to pay
for their actions—twice.

Incident

Has Justice Been Done?

Dear Sir:

Has justice been done in the
now infamous W&L boxwood in-
cident? Looking at the situation
from the view of the defendants,
I say ‘‘no.”’

Sure, what the students did
was wrong. But, it’s also wrong
that the school painted itself in-
to a corner by making the case
a media event. It’s wrong that
as we lose: to the likes of
Eastern Mennonite, Carby Hoy
and Pete Farrell (certainly not
a pair of hardened convicts) are
not representing us on the
basketball court. It’s wrong
that on the weekends Ken
Manganiello and Rob McDevitt
are condemned to walk the
streets of Lexington for enter-
tainment.

The ‘‘powers that be’’ may
contend that the punishment
was largely intended to serve as
a deterrent to any such future
incidents. I can agree that the
“‘sentence’’ had to be more than
just restitution for the
damages. But how much more?
And, in this case repayment is

no small matter. Student Con-
trol simply went overboard. A
“slap on the wrist,’’ some peo-
ple called it? I say it was more
like a shotgun blast in the face.

It seems to me that no one in
the administration has _ put
himself in the defendant’s
shoes. They are not malicious
rednecks—they must have
character or they wouldn’t be
here in the first place. And, they
do have feelings—how would
you feel having their punish-
ment?

If the Student Control was
afraid that showing leniency
would make the university look
weak and establish a bad prece-
dent, then let me ask this—if
tomorrow a student is found
guilty of breaking a window in
the same circumstances as the
“W&L 10,” am I correct in
assuming that he will re eive
the same punishment?

For his s?’ 2, I certainly hope
the answ, 10.”

Sincerely,
Jim Hess

UC Kills Bands Ban

(continued from page 1)

decided to them
separately.

Dr. Merchant said SAC was
striving for consistency by ban-
ning mid-week bands at both
fraternities and in the Cockpit.
“Once we decided to cut out live
music at fraternities, we decid-
ed to end discrimination,’ he
said.

University Center Committee
member David Blackwood said
the UC, to be consistent, would
have to cut out all diversions
during the week, such as Con-
tact speakers and classical
music performances. By not do-
ing so, the UC was only
demonstrating its prejudice
toward Cockpit entertainment.
Blackwood and Guy Steuart,
another UCC member, said the
Cockpit bands give many peo-
ple a form of cultural ex-
perience, providing a number of
diverse types of music.

Dr. Evans replied that it was
ridiculous to try to find a link
between classical concerts or
lectures and bands in the
Cockpit. ‘One cannot say a lec-
ture is the same educational
value as ‘bar music,“ he said.

When the accusation of
cultural bias came up again,
Dr. Merchant interupted with,
“Of course I’m culturally bias-
ed! That's why I'm here.”’

Student Control Chairman
Tim Brooks asked what pro-
blem would be corrected by
banning bands from the
Cockpit.

Dr. Merchant said, ‘*You're
here to put in five good days of
studying a week. I can't see the
need for entertainment during
the week.”

Dr. Pinney said he objected to
the use of University money for
Cockpit bands. But UCC chair-
man Jamie Small, who books
the bands, said that less than
$3,500 was psent on mid-week
bands during the first semester
and much of that was off-set by
funds collected from cover
charges. He later said he
figured about 40 cents per stu-
dent was used in University
funds to put the bands in the
cockpit.

Student Body President Steve
Abraham said he felt the large
scale diversion aspect was
false. He said the distinction
between restrictions on frater-
nity functions and restrictions
on Cockpit functions is that with
the latter, the attack is on the
student body, not just a small
part of it as when one attacks
the fraternities.

Howard L. Boetsch, a faculty
member on the UC, said, ‘We
sponsor basketball games dur-
ing the week. We are deceiving
ourselves if we say there is no
difference between fraternity
parties and Cockpit activities.”

Several people pointed out
that many of the students atten-
ding the Cockpit bands only
stay for a while for a ‘study
break,’ Blackwood said the
bands finish playing by 11:30
p.m. and the Cockpit closes at
midnight and that there is not
the lingering type of party at-
mosphere that exist at fraterni-
ty parties.

The UC conducted no further
business after voting down the
two proposals.

Contact
Publicity
Questioned

by John Billmyre

Two Executive Committee
members gave different ap-
praisals of the Contact’s Com-
mittee’s publicity for visiting
speakers during a short EC
meeting Monday night.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole asked Contact Co-
Chairmen Scott Cardoza and
Channing Hall why they had not
put up several large posters and

announcements about Contact’s -

program.

“It’s getting pretty late in the
ballgame,’’ said Poole in
reference to the symposium’s
schedule.

Poole told the Co-Chairmen
he thought they should put up
several large schedules of Con-
tact’s speakers.

‘We put up publicity all over
town,” Cardoza said.

He also told the EC that
several speakers are not
definitely set on a date and ex-
plained he did not think it would
be a good idea to post an in-
complete schedule.

Another EC member,
Secretary Cove Geary, differed
with Poole about Contact’s
publicity.

“I think your posters have
been more than adequate,”
Geary said.

He told the Contact Co-
Chairmen, ‘‘You can’t get away
from them.”’

Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould, who is also the EC
and hoc member to Contact,
told the EC Contact discussed
and rejected the idea of
scheduling several non-political
speakers.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg had suggested in an

earlier meeting the Co-
Chairmen look into getting non-
political speakers.

The Co-Chairmen announced
George McGovern will be
speaking on March 6.

Tuition and board for
Washington and Lee students
will rise next year as a result of
the expending inflation rate
that the entire nation is ex-
periencing.

Tuition will rise by $350 from
this year’s level of $3700 to
$4050, while board will climb to
$1250, a $200 increase from this
year’s price of $1050.

According to E. Stewart,
Washington and Lee’s
treasurer, the 9.5 percent in-
crease in tuition for the 1980-81
school year is the result of the
13.3 percent inflation rate cur-
rently afflicting the nation.

Because tuition is a major
source of income for the Univer-
sity, an increase is needed to
offset the costs of electricity,
labor and general maintenance
associated with the expansion
made in the past years at
Washington and Lee. Even with
the 9.5 percent increase,
however, a deficit of around
$600,000 is expected.

As a result of such a deficit,
the University must draw upon

Tuition To Rise $350

its surpluses from past years,
endowments and capital. Thus,
income that would have been
made through interest is used to
reduce the deficit.

Mr. Eply attributed the in-
crease in board as a result of
the increasing costs of food,
utilities and general
maintenance and repairs.

Of the $200 increase, $150 will
be used to pay the interest and
principle on the loan the Univer-
sity made for the construction
of the dining hall.

As a rule, though, the Univer-
sity refuses to use loans to
finance construction. In the
past, only Woods Creek apart-
ments and the apartments for
married students have been
financed by loans.

Because it is University
policy to raise housing costs
every other year, prices will re-
main the same in the 1980-81
school year for those living in
the dormitories. But those liv-
ing in Woods Creek next year
will see a 10 percent rise in
prices from this year’s cost.

Financial Condition Of |

by Ross Newell

An ad hoc advisory commit-
tee to study the financial condi-:
tion of the fraternities has been
established by W&L President
Robert E.R. Huntley, according
to an announcement by Dr.
Thomas C. Imeson to fraternity
treasurers at the _ Inter-
fraternity Council meeting
Tuesday night.

Imeson, a member of the
committee, said the purpose of
the study is to determine if the
university should change
itspolicy toward fraternities.
The school wants to know what
it can do to help fraternities

with regard to fiscal and
physical conditions, Imeson
said.

To assess the situation, the
committee needs an accurate
portrayal of each fraternity’s
current financial status. In the
past, fraternities were to have
worked with Mrs. Lowery to
prepare financialstatements at

the end of each month. —

However, Imeson said, seven
fraternities have not prepared
these statements for any month
of the year.

Only five fraternities are cur-
rent with Mrs. Lowery and at
least one has presented false in-
formation on its statement; it
listed all accounts payable as
current when, in fact, the ac-
counts were in arrears.

Imeson said it is in-
conceivable for a fraternity to
have an accounts payable
balance of zero. It would be
hard to find a fraternity that

Fraternities To Be Studied

does not owe a creditor, he said.

In an effort to assess the
financial status of the frater-
nities, each must present to the
committee a financial state-
ment current as of Dec. 31, 1979,
listing accounts payable and ac-
counts receivable.

If accounts payable has a zero
balance then the committee will
automatically hold a _ con-
fernence with the fraternity’s
treasurer. Before the con-
ference the committee will call
the common creditors of W&L
fraternities to see if the frater-
nity owed money on Dec. 31.

Imeson, who was a fraternity
treasurer while in college, said
he is well aware of the ‘‘finan-
cial wizardry” that can be in-
volved in preparing the
statements.

The investigative measures
are not punitive nor are they

dictatorial, Imeson repeated
several times during the
meeting.

“The committee must have
an accurate portrayal of the
fiscal condition of fraternities;
if we predicate a system based
on false knowlege its success
will be severely curtailed,’’ Im-
eson said.

Also, fraternities must pre-
sent the committee with an
estimate of their total expen-
ditures from Dec. 31, 1979
through Aug. 1, 1980.

The study is being conducted,
Imeson said, with the realiza-
tion that many fraternities are
in trouble regarding their

Journalist Robert Evans at SAE reception before his speech last

NUMBER 19

Journalist Assails
Soviet Invasion

by Ed Edge

The Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan could mark the
fateful corner of the beginning
of World War III, according to
former CBS Moscow Bureau
chief Robert Evans in his
speech at Washington and Lee
University’s Lee Chapel last
night.

“Ever since the revolution in
1917, the Russians have been
sensitive to the unrest within
the countries on their borders,
and they fear that any Moslem
restlessness may spread into its
population,” Evans said and
pointed out that, ‘The Soviet
Union has over 50 million
Moslems—more than any single
member state in the Arab
league.”

This Soviet fear of contagion
of unrest across its borders may
be what sparked the invasion of
Afghanistan, with the Russians
going in for what they term
‘defensive’? reasons, Evans
said, but added that there may
also be offensive reasons for the
military move.

“If the Soviets gain control of
Afghanistan, they will be able to
build airfields that will put
them within 300-350 miles from
the strait of Hormuz, where 60
percent of the free world’s oil
must pass en route to its
destination,’’ Evans said.

He pointed out that the 1'2
mile wide strait would be
susceptible to control by Soviet
tactical aircraft if the Soviets
do indeed move in and build the
airfields in Afghanistan.

“Hormuz is a geo-political
jugular that is the prime point
of Western vulnerability ; Soviet
control of the strait could hurt
us immensely,’’ Evans said.

Evans said the Russians are
getting stronger in Afghanistan
through the use of an American
innovation that arose in the
Vietnam conflict—the _heli-
copter gunship.

A single gunship can control a
valley or patrol a succession of
ridges and the tribal guerrillas

of Afghanistan cannot enjoy the
protection of a jungle canopy as
the Vietnamese did, Evans
said.

“The Soviets are effectively
keeping the Afghanis subdued
through the use of about 200
helicopter gunships and the
tribes are getting no super-
power flow of weapons to help
them knock the helicopters out
of the sky," Evans said.

The United States may even-
tually have to move forces into
Afghanistan to aid the
Afghanistan people in their
fight against the Russians; this
intervention could turn out to be
“Jimmy Carter’s Vietnam of

the 1980's,” Evans said in
speculation.

“The United States is a giant
on the world scene, a

bewildered Gulliver with its
future hobbled by a succession
of Lilliputian nations (Iran,
Afghanistan; Pakistan); it is
restrained to the point that it
cannot flex its muscles and
break the bonds,’’ Evans said.

Evans said, though, to look at
this period of time not as a time
of crisis, but one of opportunity.

Twice in the 20th century
when this country has been fac-
ed with an energy dilemma, a
revolution has arisen — in the
transition from wood to coal as
fuel, we moved into the In-
dustrial Revolution; when the
use of coal was beginning to be
replaced by the oil and
petroleum industry, a transpor-
tation revolution began,’’ he
said.

The increasing cost of oil puts
us on the threshold of a new
revolution, he said, and added
that we should pour our funds
into research that will offer us
another source of energy for the
80s.

“We in the United States
represent one-twentieth of the
world’s population, but we use
over one-third of the world’s
energy supply—we must find a
new way,’’ Evans said.

Mock Convention Report

 

Computer To Assist
Election Coverage

by Marc Birenbaum

An interesting thing occurred at the 1960 mock
convention; but, thanks to Washington and Lee in-
genuity, this year’s convention may run a bit
smoother.

Twenty years ago, candidate Adlai Stevenson
had accumulated enough votes to win that mock
convention on the fourth ballot but a shortage of
adding machines on the convention floor delayed
officials from ruling him a winner. In the interim,
several delegations switched their votes. By the
fifth ballot the Stevenson momentum had
dissipated, and the new front-runner was John F.
Kennedy.

This year, partly because of your friendly Har-
ris computer, such a delay could not happen.

The other part of that reason is that four W&L
students are building, as well as programming an
electronic scoreboard for the mock convention. As
votes are cast at the convention, one of the four—
Steve Biegler, Doug Swatski, Tom Hendricks or
Larry Wescott—will input the voting data into the
Harris system through the mock convention’s
remote terminal. After a complete ballot, prin-
touts of the breakdown of state-votings will be
available to regional coordinators and those on the
podium.

The scoreboard itself,.which wil be-hanging
from the press box in the Warner Center, will show
the totals for presidential candidates, vice
presidential candidates and yes/no votes on plat-
form issues, according to Biegler. for those who
may have a poor view of the scoreboard, five
airport-style monitors will be placed strategically
around the gym. A back-up system of two
microprocessors will be running simultaneously

with the Harris system for scoreboard operations.
The idea of using the computer for mock conven-
tion duties originated from former mock conven-

tion chairman, James MeNider. Since then, Jim

Hicks, director of computer operations has
developed programming for academic credit
under Professor Wilson, dealing mostly with ac-
counting.

A majority of that accounting deals with small
transactions, a real headache and a major factor
in past mock convention offices being cluttered
with many boxes of tally sheets and vouchers, ac-
cording to Hicks. ‘‘March and April will be when
we see how good the system is,” said Hicks. “‘I
think it’s really going to be appreciated when
things get hectic.”

The Harris system is being utilized in other
ways, according to facilities chairman, Goetz
Eaton. One function of his committee is to take
care of the convention’s telephone bills. That in-
cludes not only calls at the convention but also
those calls each chairman makes to their home
states for research purposes. The computer runs a
comparison with a telephone log sheet.

Another use of the computer will include securi-
ty. Lists of VIP’s, delegates and members of the
press are being stored as well as lists of mass
mailings. In addition, records of donations, atten-
dance and analyses of votes themselves can now
be recorded for future reference, according to
Eaton. ‘“‘The computer is very valuable to us
because all the information that was impractible
to retain last time, can now be retained,’’ said
Eaton.

“The computer really isn’t changing anything,”
said Hicks. “It’s a tool, an aid. It makes life
easier.”

 

  

Music F nae Established;

Initiates New Members

-by Rob Willis
Mu Beta Psi, a_ national
honorary music fraternity, of-
ficially re-restablished the
Washington and Lee University
chapter last week. The W&L
chapter, which was active bet-

‘ween 1965 and 1974, held a ban-

quet in December that was at-
tended by all of W&L’s Deans
and the chapter’s 32 new in-
itiates.

The president of the W&L
chapter, Eric Frey, said Mu
Beta Psi members’ would
recruit students for the various
music programs on_ the
Washington and Lee campus.
Frey also said Mu Beta Psi will
sponsor concerts on campus
and have parties for it’s
members.

The Washington and Lee
chapter is the fifth in the nation,
and will join chapters from N.C.
State, Clemson, Michigan Tech,

and St. Augustine’s College
each year at the Mu Beta Psi
National Convention, which is
being held at Clemson Universi-
ty this year. Next year the con-
vention will be held on the W&L
campus.

Eric Frey and Vice-president
Tom Lisk have been working
since the Fall of 1978 to re-
establish the Washington and
Lee chapter. They have gotten
support from Professor Robert
Stewart. (Professor Stewart
was the faculty advisor for Mu
Beta Psi at W&L when the
chapter was first established in
1965.) Frey also cited the con-
tribution which sophomore
secretary-treasurer Quinn
Peeper has made.

The 35-member fraternity
will be seeking financial sup-
port from the E.C. next year,
primarily to cover the costs of
the national convention.

Lewis Collection In duPont

Selections from the art collec-
tions of Sydney and Frances
Lewis of Richmond, will be on
exhibit in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery
starting next Monday. Gallery
hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
weekdays, and noon until 3 p.m.
on Saturdays.

A reception will take place
Tuesday, Feb. 26, from 5 to 7
p.m. in the gallery. The public
is cordially invited to attend.

More than a dozen paintings
owned by the Lewises — some
of monumental size — will be
shown in the W&L gallery. All
are from the period between
1973 and 1978, and the group in-
cludes a silkscreened canvas by
Andy Warhol of the late Golda
Meir (1975).

Sydney Lewis received his
B.A. degree from Washington
and Lee and studied law at
W&L. He has been a member of
the W&L board of trustees since
1972.

The Lewises are well-known

philanthropists whose benefac-
tions included a $9-million gift
to W&L toward consturction of
the new law building — Lewis
Hall — and to establish an en-
dowment named for Frances
Lewis to support research ‘‘at
the frontiers of the law.’’ They
have also been extremely
generous benefactors of other
colleges and of the Virginia
Museum.

In 1957, the husband-and-wife
team founded Best Products
Inc., now the nations’s largest
catalogue-showroom retail
chain. Sydney Lewis is chair-
man and chief executive of-
ficer, and Frances Lewis is ex-
ecutive vice president.

They are intensely interested
in contemporary art, especially
American works, and their col-
lections are considered to be
among the nation’s most impor-
tant.

Frances Lewis is a member
of the board of the Whitney
Museum in New York City, and

Sydney Lewis is a member of
the board of the Hirshhorn
Museum in Washington.

They have been recognized
repeatedly for their support of
the arts, and in 1978 when they
received the Thomas Jefferson
Award for Public Service in
Virginia, Gov. John Dalton,
commenting that their interest
in modern art traces back to a
time ‘‘when it was held up to
public ridicule,’ describing
them as a couple ‘‘not content to
wait”’ for an idea’s time to ar-
rive by itself.

In her response, Frances
Lewis said their ‘‘abundance of
good fortune and plain good
luck”? had given them ‘‘a suc-
cession of opportunities we
have been able to turn to our ad-
vantage — which we hope is not
entirely for ourselves.”’

There will be no admission
charge for the exhibition, which
will continue in duPont through
March 21.

Something that seems to be missed when
discussing new music these days is the era when
music was to a great extent the promoter of
human culture. Not only rock ’n roll of late, but the
twenties, forties and sixties each spawned a music
which in turn was a leader in the formation of the
sentiment of the day.

The twenties ushered in the carefree Charleston
dance and flappers, the forties and the Andrews
Sisters are analogous, and the sixties and counter-
culture movements of Woodstock and Haight-
Ashbury are all vivid examples of culture-based
music. The latter example is closer to us and thus
we cannot always be so objective about the oc-
currences, but it is clear that the advent of rock
and roll brought changes that pushed society
clearly into the ho-hum seventies. Nothing the
seventies could muster would ever be so dynamic
as the Beatles American tour or the Rolling
Stones’ rise to demagoguery.

What has happened, from my viewpoint at least,
is that the human factor has been subjugated to
the businessmen at lunch with record company ex-
ecutives. That is, that outside of the charismatic
performers of very high sales caliber, all other
acts are looked at on a coldly calculated scale of
profit vs. investment. It would take a total cretin
not to realize that the whole music industry has
grown senile and corrupt over the years, and that
truly original music has a dim future.

Not to be too pessimistic, however, I must give
credit to some premier artists like the Rolling

 

Music Predominates Our Culture

Stones, Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder and
Funkadelic, who are constantly getting better and
working to retain their status as supergroups.

There are also the commercial artists who are
facing a bit of a moral dilemma in that their
popularity will sell albums for a long while, but
they have to choose what to put on the record
itself. For example, the Eagles can continue to
play the same style of music as their debut, or lead
their audience into more progressive things. The
former is obviously the easier to do, but in reality,
how often can a band play ‘‘Take It Easy”’ and not
go tapioca?

Oh well, it seems that there will have to be a
definite consumer movement to get the industry
and the artists in question on the right track, but
maybe that’s asking for too much. Beware of the
independent record label in the eighties.

Notes: “Weird” Al Yankovic has cashed in
literally on his knack spoof ‘“‘My Bologna.”’ Capitol
Records has bought the rights for distribu-
tion...David Gates from the old ‘‘Bread’’ has a
new album out which is a real big ‘So
What?’’...“Ground Star,’’ a band from the
Washington, D.C., area was frat hopping this last
week and wowed all of the preps and rockers with
stunning Jimmy Hendrix covers and decent rock
tunes. They will be back in Lexington soon from
what I heard...Cchuck Mangione has a new
album...Todd Rundgren’s new album on
Bearsville records debuts at 26 on Billboard’s list

on all three of the major album rating charts...

More On ‘Apocalypse Now’

by Paul Hendry

It is difficult to write about a
film of which so much has been
written. All I can hope to offer
are a few quick observations
and impressions of what is
perhaps the most heralded and
talked about movie in our
lifetimes—‘‘Apocalypse Now.”’

Granted, comparatively little
has been said about
‘Apocalypse’ following its in-
itial extravagant marketing
and the first round of reviews
that accompanied its release.
This calm following the furor of
media-hype made me curious
enough to finally go out and ex-
perience this purported colossal
film achievement.

The film is consciously deriv-

ed from Conrad’s Heart of

Darkness, yet the director, Cop-
pola, uses the novel only as a
point of departure.

Martin Sheen does an ex-
cellent job in his portryal of the
film’s narrator and profoundly
disturbed protagonist.

The plot tells of his journey up
river into Cambodia during the
Viet Nam war to ‘‘terminate”’

Sheen’s Capt. Willard grap-
ples with his conscience and
large philosophical concerns as
he attempts to rationalize his

mission to assasinate the
nefarious Kurtz, played by
Brando.

The use of Conrad’s

character’s name in this in-
stance draws too much atten-
tion to the similarities in plots
and themes—an invitation for
comparison by which
‘‘Apocalypse”’ suffers.

The all-climactic encounter
between Willard and Kurtz is
far too loosely bound together
and inconclusive to act as a
significant punchline for the
long ardous journey up river.
The viewer is scarcely reward-
ed for anxiously sitting through

Sports

From the Pressbox
Heroes

by Bill Whalen
A popular fantasy of a sports writer is the one
where the victorious coach stands in the locker room
mements after winning the big game. The cameras

 

 

flash in on him and some reporter asks him a ques-

tion.

“Coach, where did you find the genius to stop the
Goons’ attack that way?”

‘“‘Well, Howard, as you know, we coaches spend the
entire week before a game waiting to see what the
papers say we should do. In fact, if it hadn’t been for
Joe Blah’s column in the Times. last Tuesday we
wouldn’t have stood a chance.”

Of all the columns I have done this year, only two
have given me reason to maybe think for a moment
that somebody out there reads this stuff.

The first time I got lucky was last fall, when I
predicted an “‘easy”’ way for the football team to beat
Georgetown. On that Saturday, the Generals played
the way I described and they actually won. For a few
moments, I had thought that it was my column that
had won the game, but when I didn’t get a game ball
and I had time to think it over, I knew it was only a
coincidence.

I had the same type of experience last Saturday
night, however. The W&L fans, whom I had criticized
in my last column, actually showed some spirit and
enthusiasm as the basketball team won one of the
most remarkable games I have seen in my two years
of following W&L basketball.

I know that I am not the real reason behind the good
feeling at the Warner Center.

If you’re looking for a hero, I have two candidates in
mind. Let’s give credit to the Unknown Fans. I don’t
know where you came from or how long it took you to
get here, but it certainly paid off. You helped spark
the Generals and you brought the crowd to life. If you
aren’t doing anything in the next few months, how
about returning for some lacrosse games?

But let’s also give credit to the basketball team
itself. When you’re in the midst of a losing season and
almost hopelessly behind in a game, it’s easy to give
up. But the Generals didn’t — making up eight points
in less than a minute-and-a-half.

Seeing the crowd mobbing the team after the game
will also be hard to forget for a while. It was one of
those special moments when the fans had been
rooting hard, the team had played well, and both par-
ties thanked each other.

It may also tell us something about the way basket-
ball is perceived at this school.

For some reason, the ‘‘everyone loves a winner’’
philosophy does not apply to W&L Basketball. The
crowds may have been larger when the teams would
go 22-6 or 23-5, but they did not show the feeling that
was present at Saturday night’s contest.

How that the basketball team is hovering around
the .550 mark, the fans are showing more interest and
this could be good or bad. Following the team because
they’re having a bad year is good—it shows a true in-
terest in the team and the sport in general. But follow-
ing the team because it’s fun to see them lose is
wrong—it is simply ill-conceived humor.

But what will happen next year? Will it take
another disappointing year to bring in the fans? If a
team has.to do poorly to draw a crowd, then
something is wrong.

And if you aren’t a real W&L fan after Saturday
night’s performance, then you can’t appreciate
basketball at its best.

Generals Edged 102-100

If you liked Saturday night's
overtime game _ against
Salisbury State, then you had to
love Tuesday night’s double-
overtime thriller against
Eastern Mennonite.

Leading by as many as 11
points in the second half, the
Generals were able to over-
come a three point deficit in the
27 seconds of regulation play to
send the game into overtime.
Rob Smitherman’s jumper with
two seconds left knotted the
game at 84-all.

The Generals trailed almost
the entire time in the second
overtime and found themselves
trailing 99-96 with 1:54 to play.
A Tom Jeffries jumper pulled
W&L within one and a Brian
Hanson followup put the
Generals ahead with only 1:03
to play. :

But Mennonite, led by the
play of guard Tim Crawford,

went ahead to stay when.

Crawford hit two of his game-
high 33 points with 0:53 left in
the game. Travis Sanders then
hit the front end of a one-and-
one free-throw opportunity to
put Mennonite ahead 102-100.
The Generals were unable to
connect on any of three shots in
the last 13 seconds, and the
game ended at the end of the se-
cond overtime, 102-100.

Oftensively, the Generals
played one of their finest games
of the season. Smitherman led
W&L with 23 points. “String”
was followed by Jeffries and
Hanson, who each tallied 18
points. Guards George Spears
and Clark New each had 13
points, while forward Travis
Patterson added 12 more.

From the way the second half
Started, it seemed as though
everyone at tht Warner Center
could have called it an early
evening. Two baskets each by
Patterson and Jeffries gave the
Generals a 57-47 lead with 14:57
to go.

Hanson then ripped off eight
points in a five minute span to
boost W&L to a seemingly in-
surmountable 74-63 lead with
only 6:29 to play.

Mennonite scored five
straight points to cut the lead to
only five. But in the last six
minutes of regulation play, the
Generals could muster only six
points. Meanwhile, Mennonite
was outscoring W&L, 20-6, to go
ahead 83-80 with only twenty
seconds left to play.

Clark New took the ensuing
inbounds pass and raced the
length of the court, hitting a 20-
foot jumper with only 21
seconds left to cut the deficit to

In Twin-Overtime Drama

one point. Pollard was then foul-
ed with 16 seconds lef but could
connect on only one of two free
throws.

The Generals then took the
ball past mid-court and called a
time-out to set up the last shot.
Smitherman’s. ten-foot jumper
from the left side evened the
score with only two ticks left on
the clock. Mennonite got off a
final shot, and a fifty-foot at-
tempt by Crawford came un-
comfortably close, hitting the
backiron.

Smitherman again appeared
to be the man-of-the-hour as his
lay-up gave the Generals an
88-86 lead with 1:35 to go in the
first O.T. Hanson then made a
lay-up to give W&L a 90-88 lead
with 36 seconds left, but
Crawford jumper with 21
seconds left sent the game into
a sceond overtime.

Actually, it appeared as
though neither team wanted to
win. Mennonite seemingly had
the game in control, holding a
three-point lead with less than
two minutes to go. Yet the
Generals had another chance at
pulling the game out. Clark
New missed fron underneath in
the closing seconds and seemed
to have been fouled, but no call
was made.

Grapplers Close Out Regular Season

by Chris Sisto

The varsity wrestling team
had a very uneventful week
recently as they had no dual
meets and did not appear in any
tournaments. Their one
scheduled dual meet against
Longwood College was cancell-
ed. This gives the team some
time to prepare fer the busy
week-and-a-half coming up.

The Generals will have three
dual meets this week. Then dur-
ing February Break, the team

will travel to Hampden-Sydney
for the ODAC Championships to
be held on Feb. 19.

The Generals can even their
dual meet record and finish the
season at 5-5 if they win all
three meets this week. Head
Coach Gary Franke is
somewhat skeptical, refusing to
make that long of a forecast.

He did say that the team’s
first opponent this week, James
Madison University, will be one
of the toughest teams that his

also said that at the moment,
the last team the Generals will
fact this week, George
Washington, has an advantage
due to several additions of
young wrestlers into the
Generals’ lineup.

In between these two mat-
ches, the Generals will also face
Davidson College.

As for the ODAC Champion-
ships, a tournament the
Generals have never lost, the
team will have its work cut out
this time around. They beat
Hampden-Sydney earlier in the
season but have also lost to Lyn-
chburg — the team that looks to
be the tournament favorite.

The only other wrestling news
of note after the ODAC Tourna-
ment is the NCAA Division III

Feb. 22-23. Wrestlers are chosen
through their performances

Lax Team Off To Bermuda

by Kip Gordon
With their season opener just
three weeks away, the lacrosse
Generals have begun final
preparations for the start of the
1980 season.

About sixty players reported
to Spring practice, which began
a week from last Monday.
Because of this large number,
practice time has been devoted
mainly to evaluation of talent so
that the varsity roster can be
completed by the winter break,
said Coach Jack Emmer.

Emmer intends to keep
thirty-two players at the varsity
level, and it is this squad which
will be taken to Bermuda for
practice over the Washington
Holiday break.

Virginia weather has been
less than suitable for outdoor
practices and the Bermuda
climate should provide a
welcome change in practice
field conditions. Emmer hopes
to get in around twelve
workouts, and thus expects the
trip to be a productive one.

The return of 6’8”’ attachman
Chris Kearney to the lacrosse
team has raised a_ few
eyebrows. Kearney, who led the
Generals in scoring his
sophomore year, has been away
from the game for two years,
having taken a year off from
lacrosse and spending another
away from school.

Said Emmer, ‘‘He’s a little
rusty after the two years off and

there are a number of other
talented attackmen, so it’s still
too early to tell how much he’ll
be able to help the team.

The Generals will first
display their talents in a two
day scrimmage with Bucknell
over Fancy Dress weekend, one
week after the Bermuda trip.
The following week they open
the season with a game against
Mt. Washington, a club team.

Just one week later the
Generals will face Syracuse, a
team which placed sixth in last

. year’s NCAA playoffs.

With the Syracuse game still
one month away, Emmer
believes his team will be ready.

| Apocalypse Reviewed

(continued from page 3)
watch a vague climax that suc-
ceeds only in making a long
movie longer.

If’ there is one thing
‘“‘Apocalypse”’ is, it is visually
compelling. The film is loaded
with exciting and powerful im-
ages. Coppola is very successful
in creating a bizarre nightmare
of war.

The difficulty for the viewer
is that the dreamlike quality—a
quality enhanced through the
photography, narration, and
Coppola-composed score—acts
as a barrier to entering the
world of the film.

It is all too easy to sit and
mumble ‘‘Weird.’’ The
Playboy-U.S.0. show scene
struck me as a particularly
strange and nightmarish in-
terlude.

Robert Duvall’s moments are
some of the finest in the film in

his Col. Kilgore role. The entire
Kilgore sequence from start to
finish is perhaps the finest in
the. film and the best
demonstration of Copola’s
power asia director.

Kilgore’s name makes one
mindful of Kubrick’s ‘‘Dr.
Strangelove,’’ and similarities
in the black comedy. and
nightmarish mood are overtly
recognizable in the two.
Kilgore, in one secen, a surfing
buff, makes a strategic decision
on the basis of the good waves
at one target — some of his men
surf during an attack.

‘‘Apocalypse’’ may be an in-
tellectual experience for some,
for others it may be a
memorable spectacle. Others
still may find its. esoteric quali-
ty difficult to digest and look
forward to catching “Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid”’
for the hundredth time.

Swimming Program On Rise

by Frank Jackman

What ever happened to the
W&L swim team?

There is a distinct possibility
that the team will finish no bet-
ter than 1-10 this year after hav-
ing only a 2-8 record last year. It
was not too long ago that the
Generals were considered one
of the best teams in the state.

Well, first year Coach Page
Remillard says that the student
body can expect the team to be
back at that high competitive
level in the very near future.

The team is in the midst of a
rebuilding year and, if all goes
according to plan, the swimm-
ing Generals should be at, or
above, the .500 level by next
season.

One of the greatest problems
faced by Remillard and his
team this year is. lack of
numbers. The average swim
team has 16-20 members. The
W&L team has only ten
members, eight swimmers and
two divers. It’s hard to compete
with such a small team.

To solve this problem, a full
scale recruiting program has
been initiated — something that
was not emphasized enough
before. And the recruiting has
paid off. Coach Remillard ex-
pects 10 to 12 new faces next
year. These should help the
team immensely.

Beside recruiting, an em-

phasis has also been placed on .

the development of a good pro-

gram for those swimmers
already here. With such a foun-
dation laid, the results are bet-
ter recruiting and a more com-
petitive team.

There is no doubt that the
team has worked hard to start

. that foundation. It practices

every morning at 6:30 for an
hour and a half, and every
afternoon for two more hours.
In addition to swimming, team
members also lift weights for
three hours a week.

Remillard sees a growing
trend toward swimming as an
intercollegiate sport in this part
of the country. In his opinion,
the W&L team has the potential
to be one of the more powerful
teams in this growing sport.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Small Bands...

If you were in the Cockpit Tuesday night you
already know that our tavern was host to another
“Small Band.” We refer, of course, to Jamie Small
and his University Center Committee which has con-
sistently placed top quality entertainment in the
Cockpit all year. But perhaps a brief history lesson
will put this in the proper perspective.

Three years ago, there were many more VMI
Keydets than W&L students in the Cockpit on most
nights. Then something called the Music Union was
born with the mission of bringing ‘‘bar music’”’ (as it
is called in some circles) to the tavern in an effort to
draw students back. The plan worked and has been
continued ever since.

Burr Datz, a W&L graduate and former Cockpit
employee, used his connections in the music world to
upgrade the quality of entertainment last year. Witha
little help from Datz, Small and company has in-
herited the chore and has done and exceptional job of
bringing high-grade live entertainment to the Cockpit
ona limited budget.

Tim Eyermann and East Coast Offering was the
latest in Smali’s series of successes. His committee
has often packed the Cockpit to capacity—to the ad-
vantage of both the management and the student
body. Maybe you thought bands just appear in the
W&L tavern? No, it takes the work of at least a few
students willing to go through the endless hassles of
dealing with agents and managers to get the sort of
entertainment Small and company has been pro-
viding us regularly in the comfortable atmosphere of
the Cockpit.

,.And Belated Thanks

A few weeks ago your student government did an
amazing thing: it lowered the price of your Fancy
Dress ticket—from $20 to $15.

The price reduction was the result of that sort of
diligent job the EC has done all year. EC members
added some figures together and found that the Stu-
dent Activities Board would make a $10,000 profit on
the dance at $20 a head. Some hard questions got $5 off
the ticket price.

We're glad to see the EC holding the line against in-
flation by keeping the price of Fancy Dress
reasonable.

Theft

Dear Editor,

In response to the Phi’s arti-
cle on stealing, I would like to
relate a recent experience of
mine.

About two weeks ago, I left
my watch in the gymnasium
weight room following a
workout. I noticed it was miss-
ing after a couple of hours and I
returned to recover it.

Lo and behold it was gone
(this didn’t shock me too much
since I had permanently “‘lost”’
two watches, a pair of running
shoes, and several other items
there on previous occasions).

I made the usual checks with
the equipment room, where lost
articles are collected with the
usual negative results. Anyway,
suffice it to say that I more or
less forgot about the loss.

However, the day before
yesterday, I recovered my
watch under unusual cir-
cumstances. I walked into the
weight room and spotted my
watch lying ona gym mat.

 

 

 

 

 

NU

“HEY. WHERE'S MY

BIOLOGY EXPERIMENT?”

 
   

 

 

I scooped it up and started to
put it on, but I quickly recon-
sidered and put it back down on
the mat and waited for the thief
to pick it up.

You can imagine my shock
when a faculty member picked
the watch up and started to
walk away with it. I confronted
him with the statement, ‘‘Hey, I

think that’s my watch,”’ to

which he responded, ‘‘Oh, is it?

I’ve had this for two weeks.”’

He gave me the watch and
walked away without any ex-
planation. I didn’t pursue the
subject with him nor do I plan
to.

Perhaps, though, I should
have taken a good look at his

shoes and asked him what pawn
shop he frequents.

Response To Carmichael Letter

Dear Editor,

I can tolerate ignorance; I can _ tolerate
ethnocentricism, I can even tolerate juvenile
behavior in an upperclassman, but J will not
tolerate an outright lie!

I sincerely hope that the majority of the W&L
community will not be misled by the inaccurate
statements of one misinformed young student!

The Student Association for Black Unity is ad-
vised by me and I approved of their choice to bring
Brother Kwame Toure to W&L. Bringing Brother
Toure here was intended to bring a new and dif-
ferent point of view to the W&L campus. Granted,
you may not agree with this position, but be adult
enough to attempt censorship of ideas you don’t
like ! Fortunately truth is independent of personal
Opinion.

David Mullin’s ‘‘lie’’ (Isn’t lying an honor viola-
tion!) hopefully won’t create a hostile environ-
ment between black and white students here.
Since David didn’t bother to check the accuracy of
his statements before he ran off at the mouth, I
would like to clarify the chief inaccuracy for the
record. Brother Toure, unlike Mr. Mullin, is a man
of principle, he came here for a small honorarium

Persi flage

and travel expenses. Kwame Toure was not paid
the enormous figure cited by Mr. Mullin. It is an
out-right lie ‘‘created’’ by Mr. Mullin that should
be apologized for publicly. The damaging conse-
quences for such irresponsibility should no go un-
punished! In his anxiety to get his “criticism’””’ off
his chest, Mr. Mullin could have created a situa-
tion imperiling the tranquility of the campus com-
munity.

In the charter of the Student Association for
Black Unity is the purpose of disseminating black
culture throughout the W&L community. The pro-
grams of SABU will not be dictated to by those
who want to bury their heads in the sand and go
back to the days when ‘‘negrohood’’ was in flower.
If that is allowed to happen, we will all lost
something valuable at W&L.

In the next few months SABU will sponsor black
speakers in business, the arts, and politics. Next
time David, rather than speculate and irrespon-
sibly criticize, why not come and simply par-
ticipate. Remember one thing, the ‘‘failure of a
revolutionary” said was “‘participation gives one
the right of observation!”’

John L. White
Director of Minority Affairs

Giving The Fancy Dress Bid

Obviously, you’re not worried about it now. I
mean, who could worry about such a thing the day
before vacation starts?

But let’s face it, deep down there’s that gnawing
doubt. Who the hell can you ask to Fancy Dress?

The key to the situation is remaining calm. Sure,
you don’t want a date who might be mistaken for
the Mock Convention’s logo, but that’s no reason to
jump after the first piece of candy coated fluff you
can find.

Those worshippers of plastic daddy don’t come
cheap, and they end up spending most of their
time in the bathroom with their girlfriends,
anyway. It’s like dating a mannikin that eats.

No, to get a really superior date for this night of
appearances and artificiality, you must realize
how coveted a prize is the golden bird.

To be able to tell her friends that she attended

one of the premier college social events of the
year, a normally discriminating debutante will
hop off her pedestal and grovel in the meat market
with everyone else. It is up to you to attend and
participate in the upcoming cattle shows if you ex-
pect to cut an acceptable heifer out of the herd.

But again, you must be patient. You won’t get a
good return on your investment if you panic and
surrender the bid without negotiations.

Perhaps she will be willing to experience a form
of intellectual inter-action with you. Maybe she’ll
agree to participate in a meaningful dialogue con-
cerning the creation of various life forms. Or, bet-
=e maybe she'll fix you dinner and make your

ed.

Whatever, you should remember that you are
not using coercion to achieve your ends. It’s only
because the carrot is so desired that rabbits take
the bait.
More Letters To The Editor
Student Calls For New IFC Charter

To the Editor:

I would like to express my appreciation to Syd
Farrar for responding to my letter which ap-
peared in the February 1 edition of the Phi. I
would also like to express my regret that Mr. Far-
rar did not choose to address the specific questions
that I raised. Well, let’s let bygones be bygones.
However, since we seem to have a public forum
going on here, I would like to focus on the fraterni-
ty problem as a whole, and then, offer a solution.

The fraternity problem is quite large and multi-
faceted. Therefore, I arbitrarily choose to begin
outlining this problem from the faculty point of
view. During my years here, there has been an in-
creasing effort on the part of the faculty and the
administration to interfere with the government
process of the fraternity system. There are some
who will abuse that. The faculty is most often
heard from through a vocal minority. However,
since I have not heard a dissenting view contrary
to that vocal segment, I assume the faculty is fair-
ly well-unified in its position. The administration
and faculty have tried to regulate social practices
ranging from party hours to housekeeping. As
well, those two bodies have expressed dismay at
the lack of constructive attitudes, goals and values
that seem to be rampant throughout the fraternity
system. I think it is fair to say, perhaps
simplistically, that the faculty feels impelled to in-
tervene because it does not think the fraternity
system is governing itself properly.

Also, during my years here, there has been in-
creasing rejection and resentment on the part of
the students toward any attempt by the faculty or
administration to interfere with the government of
the fraternity system. The students have made
some cosmetic concessions in the partying
schedule and there seems to be some improve-
ment in the appearances of the houses. However,
there has been no attempt by the students, as a
unit, to cure the real disease—the lack of construc-
tive attitudes, goals and values.

It is now necessary to focus on the mediator bet-
ween the faculty and the students— the fraternity
government, the Interfraternity Council. The IFC
has become the fulcrum of the community seesaw.
On one end of the board is an emotional faculty
calling for more control. On the other end of the
board is an emotional body of students rabidly op-
posed to faculty intervention. From my appraisal
of the situation, it is clear that the IFC is not satis-
fying either side of the controversy. To put it quite
clearly, the government of the fraternity system is
not governing. Why?

To answer question, ‘‘Why is the IFC not govern-
ing?’’, we must examine the Constitution of the
fraternity system and, keeping the word “‘govern’’
in mind, ascertain if that document is capable of
fulfilling the definition of that word in a manner
that is congruent to our needs today. So let’s take a
look at the Constitution. (See page 24 of the Stu-
dent Handbook. )

First, to govern anything, by definition, it is
necessary to set a goal, ideal or standard to
regulate and control by. Take a good look at the

preamble, that part which sets the tone for the
document. It reads as if it were a peace treaty bet-
ween warring tribes. It celarly does not set a stan-
dard, goal, or an ideal that is sufficient to fulfill
our needs of today. The rest of the constitution is
conspicuously void of any standards, goals or
ideals for the fraternities or the members to live
by. In fact, the only requirement that I can find is
that fraternity members conduct themselves as

Hanging

Dear Editor,

gentlemen during rush. (By-law 6, section 6a) No
doubt, gentlemanliness is an admirable quality,
but to survive in the future we face, we will have to
be considerably more than gentlemen. (And many
would argue that this one goal has yet to be realiz-
ed.)

In essence, the constitution merely defines the
powers of individual officers. How can these of-
ficers execute their powers if they don’t have a
relevant goal, ideal, or standard to lead them? I
believe there are few people in the fraternity com-
munity who, after reading the constitution, will
disagree with my assertion that the present
charter is insufficient for the purpose of governing
ourselves today.

Obviously, I am calling for the abolition of the
present constitution and the creation and ratifica-
tion of a new one. I am not suggesting the abolition
of the fraternity system. I am trying to strengthen
it. 1am fully aware of the magnitude of such a re-
quest and I do not suggest it lightly. So I shall pro-
ceed.

Before I get into the creation of a new constitu-
tion, allow me to make one qualifying statement.
Any new constitution should be conceived and
written entirely by students and without any input
from the faculty or administration. If we are not
capable of governing ourselves in a manner that is
constructive and beneficial to the society we live
in then we should not be here in the first place.

I would like to outline the general concept by
which I believe a new constitution should be
created. Any new constitution should set up a
fraternity system that is beneficial to our society
as a whole. To do this, we must look at the world
around us—the world which we must soon become
a part of.

Considering the many crises. we face now, and
the ever-growing complexity of the problems that
are bound to arise in the future, it is clear that the
next 30 years will present the toughest test of sur-
vival that our nation has ever had to endure. Since
it is our generation that will have to pass that test,
it is time to assess the qualities we will need to suc-
ceed.

The most important quality we will need, in a
general sense, is the ability to communicate with
other people in order to be able to grasp and to
understand their thoughts and ideas. We will then
have to be able to communicate our ideas and
thoughts so that other people can grasp and
understand them as well. To achieve this quality
we must possess the powers of analytical reason-
ing, and the mastery of the skills of writing and
oratorical rhetoric.

Therefore, any fraternity system should be con-
ducive to dispersion of thought and the goal of ac-
quiring and refining the skills of writing and
oratorical rhetoric. This is not to say that the new
system will force people to become involved in
areas that they might not wish to delve into. It is to
say that the new fraternity system will support
and encourage those who wish to attain those
goals.

I welcome any cirticism of the preceding
paragraph on the basis of merit. However, I can
sympathize with the people who will not suggest
that it is impossible to create a fraternity system
that could fulfill these goals. I ask you to wait until
the next issue when I will present the framework
of a new constitution that will outline how it will be
done. Meanwhile, read the present IFC constitu-
tion and think positively!

Thank you,

Notice

Because of mid-winter break
the next issue of the Ring-tum
Phi will be published Feb. 28.

How much longer must we en-
dure the irresponsible sports
commentaries from Mr.
Whalen? His latest attempt at
an analysis of the Super Bowl
was completely unfounded and
is an insult to the intelligence of
any semi-informed football fan.

Does Mr. Whalen possess
some prophetic ability which
enables him to pronounce that
the Rams will never be the best
team in pro football? Maybe he
can tell me what’s going to be
on my accounting final too. How
can Mr. Whalen refer to a con-
sistently winning team as ‘‘a

Furthermore, if he had ever
seen the Rams play, which I’m
sure he hasn’t, he would know
better than to compare them to
a, ‘“‘semi-comatose houndog.”’

I think anyone who saw the
Super Bowl observed a Ram
team playing with a great deal
of emotion, as they did for 18
consecutive weeks.

And finally, I watched the en-
tire game, maybe Mr. Whalen
missed it, and I failed to
observe any ‘“‘laughter’’ from
the Steelers during the contest.

Granted, Mr. Whalen certain-
ly has the right to an opinion,

Decisions About Energy

Dear Editor:

Washington and Lee is known
for producing men who will
recognize and overcome the
pressing problems. that
America faces, but presently I
see Washington and Lee
students flinching in the face of
these problems and running to
their secure little worlds which
they meticulously create.

How many times must our
present leaders announce the
monumental importance of the
energy issue before it is fully
addressed by the leaders of
tomorrow?

If one would give it some
thought, he would come to

realize that the means of con-
suming energy is a fundamen-
tal aspect of any society.

America, in the near future,
has to make some profound
decisions concerning the energy
issue and it is the responsibility
of all educated people to
become thoroughly
knowledgeable about this issue
and to voice their opinion.

I sincerely hope that
Washington and Lee students
will accept their responsibility
and take advantage of organiza-
tions such as S.T.A.N.D. in
order to meet the challenge.

Expression or Pollution?

Dear Editor,

Recently three W&L students
felt the necessity to pollute our
campus grounds with their per-
sonal political views. I suggest
that if every member of our
community chose this method
of expression, our campus
would be cheapened and lit-
tered. I personally have acted
to curtail the placing of ex-
cessive amounts of posters by
legitimate organizations which
I am involved.

If these ‘‘gentlemen”’ felt the
need to offend General West-
moreland, there are two other
more conventional and socially
acceptable means. They could
have passed out literature at
the entrance of Lee Chapel on
the evening of the general’s
speech. Or, alternatively, they
could have questioned the
general’s positions directly.

Yes, I personally found it of-
fensive that these students
cowardly posted a_ position
without identifying themselves

Swinging

Dear Sir:

The Kinniburg description of
Bob Crosby’s musicmasters
who will play at Fancy Dress
was well-written and quite com-
plete — save for one interesting
detail that he may not know
about.

During the late '30s, Crosby's
Bobcats did more than anyone
to bring to national attention the
Washington and Lee Swing. I
remember this clearly, and I
still own a scratched but belov-
ed and highly melodic 78 r.p.m.

issued way back when. Let’s

Call For More Freedom Of The Press

Dear Editor:

In response to IFC President
Syd Farrar’s questioning of the
allegations castigating his in-
volvement in several student
government committees.

I would like to commend and
hope that he will continue his ef-

forts to clear up the
misunderstandings that the
university community

sometimes entertains concern-
ing incidents such as the Fiji-
Pika altercation.

During the course of the cur-
rent school year, many in-
cidents have reduced the cam-
‘pus to a state of rumor because
of incomplete or inaccurate ac-
counts of controversial events.

This problem can be relieved
in many instances by the
governmental agency which
has jurisdiction over an issue.

In fact this problem primarily
exists because of the failure of
certain agencies to give a com-
plete and accurate account of
what actions they have taken
and THE REASONING FOR
WHICH THOSE ACTIONS ARE
DEEMED NECESSARY.

It is folly to criticize the
university community for opi-
nions which were derived from
the only sources of information
available to them.

Student government agencies
must be and are accountable to

the students which they repre-
sent. Therefore it is not un-
justified but necessary for stu-
dent journalists to inquire about
an apparent voting shift by a
representative of the students
and fraternities.

Moreover it is the duty of stu-
dent representatives to explain

the ‘‘facts or feelings surroun-
ding”’ particular votes.

Only then will the university
community be free of rumor
and controversey. Only then
will student government be just
and accountable.

Hangings Controversy Cont.

Dear Editor:

With regard to the “W&L
Hanging Controversy.” I want
to start off by saying that I think
it is unfair that just because Ms.
Gretchen C.F. Shappert, Esq. is
in the minority as a woman here-
at W&L, her article should be so
rudely placed on page 16 of the
Phi. I think she should have
been granted a full spread (with
picutres of the annual debu-
tante ball, etc.) on the front
page.

I do share her opinion about
the harsh, evil, vile, abusive
obscenity in the ‘‘infamous”’
sticker. It makes me sick to my
sensitive stomach.

I also plead with the supply
store to remove the sticker that
boldly asserts ‘‘Washington and
Lee IS THE University of
Virginia.”’ This is abusive and
violently demeaning to the
other Virginia college students,
who suffer an even more debas-

W&L Moot Court Team
Among Nation’s Best

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s moot court—legal debate
—team emerged as one of the
eight best in the nation in com-
petition in New York City
recently.

The W&L law school
representatives—William J.
Milani of Tappan, N.Y.,
Buckner P. Wellford of Mem-
phis and Kerry M. Wilson of
Lexington, all second-year
students—reached the quarter-
finals in the national contest by

defeating teams from the
University of Washington and
‘Vanderbilt University.

The W&L team qualified for
the national meet after winning
first place in a_ preliminary
four-state competition in
November.

In the quarterfinals, W&L’s
team was defeated by a team
from Boston University’s law
‘school.

About 250 teams representing

_ more than 160 law schools in the
nation participated in the moot
court competition in its initial
stages.

The debate this year centered
on the question of civil lawsuits
in instances where the facts of a
case are so complex that a jury

cannot be expected to unders-
tand them. Each team was re-
quired to argue both sides of the
question.

Samuel W. Calhoun, assistant
professor of law, was advisor to
the W&L team, and a third-year
student, Llewellyn Hedgbeth,
was student advisor and coach.

physical facilities with few, if
any, being maintained well
enough to last into the future.

J. Holt Merchant, IFC faculty
advisor, said if the university
waits any longer to take some
type of action then a house or
two will be lost to financial
hardship.

Imeson said the committee is
looking to see what alternatives
the university has to help
fraternities. Nothing will be
forced on fraternities, and any
programs implemented as a
result of the committee’s fin-
dings will be conducted on a
voluntary basis, he said.

Possible outcomes of the
study might be joint efforts bet-
ween fraternities and
university in such areas as
maintenance and food service.
Also, the committee’s findings
will be used to assess the
school’s fraternity loan pro-
gram.

Maintenance, for example,
might be provided by university
personel to fraternites for a
charge, Imeson said. The ser-
vices would cost the school
more than thefraternities would
be charged, he added.

After many treasurers ques-
tioned the committee’s motives,

the:

Imeson said if a_ traternity
perceives this action as a threat
then it is experiencing the latter
stages of paranoia. The com-
mittee is attempting to help
fraternities and to discover
what else the university can do
to help, he said.

In other business, IFC
presidentSyd Farrar said-
fraternity checklists are due on
Feb. 26. Spot inspections are
scheduled for the 27th. :

Greg McDonald, spokesman
of the Students for Community
Action group, said the organiza-
tion, in conjunction with a
federally funded group, Total
Action Against Poverty, needs
fraternity members _ topar-
ticipate in community service
projects arranged by TAP.

The work, to be done on Satur-
days, would include _ both
manual and _ skilled labor,
everything from shovelling
snow to doing carpentry work
and laying bricks. Fraternities
interested in participating can
leave word at the office in the
Student Center or contact
McDonald at 463-4916.

The IFC’s next meeting will
be the Tuesday after Fancy
Dress. The floor will be open to
nominations for IFC president
and vice-president at the
meeting.

EC Conducts Business

(continued from page 1)

The Calyx also reported to the
EC Monday night.

The Yearbook’s business
manager told the EC Studio
Costs were going to run higher

_ than allocated for in the budget.

Hamilton explained the Calyx
ran into additional expenses by
offering resale of pictures to
seniors.

Another expense, _ said
Hamilton, was the purchase of
equipment for color processing.

‘“‘We bought the equipment to
do our own color work,’’ said
Hamilton.

He said the Publications
Board also paid for the color
equipment.

In response to questions from
Poole, Hamilton told the EC
revenue will be coming in dur-

‘ing the next few months from

fraternities, advertising and the
University.

Hamilton said he expects to
collect $3,000 from fraternities
for house pictures.

The business manager added
money from the University will
not be collected before the year-
book is published, because the
library buys excess copies of
the Calyx.

Asked about the overall finan-
cial picture, Hamilton said the
Calyx should come out close to
budget.

Jim Vines, Chairman of the
Cold Check Committee,
reported to the EC that the CCC

-needs a law school represen-

tative.

“Law School attendance is
down now,” said Vines. He told
the EC that law students do not
show up as frequently when
there is no law representative.

Vines said he is going to put
posters up around the law
school to find a new law school
representative.

Senior Law Representative
John Fraser suggested the Cold
Check Committee might save
money and create better public
relations if it wrote its own let-
ters to persons with long-term
cold check violations.

These violations are usually
from students who have left the
university earlier. in the year,
said Vines.

Recently the CCC has relied
on the school’s lawyer to notify
the long-term violators.

“The lawyer gets better
results than the Committee,”

_ said Vines.

Vines told the EC last month
was Slow for the CCC, but added
next month should be busy
because of Fancy Dress.

The EC unanimously voted
that the University Atheletic
Committee investigate the
reservation system for racquet-
ball courts.

Bands Ban St cninntdonend |

by John Billmyre
The University Council recon-
sidered banning paid live music
during the week in fraternity
houses Wednesday nights and
once again voted the measure
down.

Banning live music from
fraternities is a measure which
has surfaced this year, but is
really the outgrowth of an issue
that came up last year.

At the heart of the matter is a
faculty resolution, passed last
year, aimed at stopping mid-

Basketball Team Wins ODAC

by Dale Park

“IT am extremely proud of
these young men. They have
weathered an adverse season
with great character and pride
and represented themselves
very well.”’

W&L head basketball coach
Verne Canfield said these words
for a very good reason — his
hoopsters were 0.D.A.C. cham-
pions again for the third time in
four years after winning the
conference tournament held at
Hampden-Sydney, February
21-23.

To top it all off, the Generals
defeated HampdenSydney in
the championship game on the
Tiger’s home court, 58-56, on an
18-foot jump shot at the buzzer
by W&L center Rob Smither-
man. ‘I have fonder feelings for
this squad than any other team
Ihave coached,”’ said Canfield.

The Generals began the tour-
nament by defeating the Emory
& Henry Wasps, 56-50 for W&L’s

week parties in fraternities.

During the UC meeting
Wednesday several faculty
members said the resolution is
being upheld in letter, but not in
spirit.

The issue came up Wednes-
day because the faculty is
displeased with the comti-
nuance of mid-week parties.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John said, “there should be an
end to mid-week parties, no
matter how they are financed.”

EC members study loan committee revisions during Monday
‘night’s meeting.

‘Loan Committee

Revamped by EC

by John Billmyre
The Executive Committee
discussed and debated the
operations of the Student
Emergency Loan Committee

-for nearly two hours Monday

night when the Committee’s

Chairman told the EC about ir-:

regularities in the Committee’s
operations.

Only a few of the EC
members knew about the
SELC, its funding or its opera-

When the smoke had cleared
and the dust had settled, the EC
had passed a series of motions
to correct problems in the
SELC’s operation.

While SELC Chairman Jim
Vines, who is also Chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, said

the EC motions might clear up
the problems experienced by
the SELC, he expressed doubts
about the EC discussion.

“I just question that the ef-
fects I really wanted to bring
about were not the major issues
of the discussion,”’ said Vines
after the EC meeting.

During the meeting Vines told
the EC the SELC has been run
by a few members of one frater-
nity during the past few years.

He said the SELC has loose,
unwritten rules which have
been made up as it gave out

Women Respond

John Hart has thousands of

he is 44.

Students Produce T.V. Show

Journalism students. at
Washington and Lee University
are producing a weekly news
program on public television in-
tended expressly to meet the in-
terests and needs of viewers in
far southwestern Virginia, the
‘“‘mountain empire,’’ who have
no local daily newspaper or
television news coverage and
little radio coverage.

‘‘Southwest Chronicle’’
presents a half-hour summary
of state news, news of the
southwest region, sports,
agriculture and_ business
reports, and newsmaker
features.

Joseph B. Dashiell, a senior
journalism major from Norfolk,
is producer and anchorman for
the program. Half-a-dozen
other W&L journalism majors
work directly on ‘Southwest
Chronicle” as well, and there
are 14 writers and two senior
reporters.

“Southwest Chronicle’ is
broadcast each Friday evening
on WSVN (channel 47), a public-
television station in Norton in
Wise County. WSVN is a
satellite of WBRA (channel 15),
the public TV_ station in
Roanoke, and WBRA also
broadcasts ‘Southwest Chron-

Annual

Condom Week

We're sorry but you've
already missed the officially
recognized date.

The week of Feb. 14-21 was
the state of Maine’s Second An-
nual Condom Week.

There was even a Condom
Week Committee whose job it
was ‘‘to dispel myths and misin-
formation about condoms and
to promote their use by the sex-
ually active population.”

A spokesman for the commit-
tee, Marjorie Love, cited the
importance of Condom Week:
‘In this day of supposed sexual
sophistication, the condom has
been joked about, maligned,
given a bad name and often
forgotten.”

We’re sure the W&L student
body will heed the words of Ms.
Love on the importance of Con-
dom Week and choose this
weekend to honor and promote
the lowly “rubbery sheath.”’

According to R. H. Mac-
Donald, the head of W&L’s jour-
nalism program and faculty
supervisor of ‘Southwest
Chronicle,’’ few daily
newspapers circulate at all in
far southwest Virginia,
although it encompasses 10
counties and a quarter-million
people — and those daily papers
are principally concerned with
coverage of their ‘“‘home’’ areas
in Tennessee, West Virginia and
Kentucky.

Weekly newspapers exist in
nine of the 10 counties, but their
coverage is strictly local, Mac-
Donald notes. Television sta-
tions which reach the area
operate in the same manner as
the daily press, focusing on
news of other areas, he says.

Male-Female Relations

Course

Fifteen Washington and Lee
students will live at Mary
Baldwin College this spring
when an_ interdisciplinary
course—‘‘Male-Female
Relations’ —will once again be
offered.

Interdepartmental 250, an ex-
amination of sex roles and role
relationships from the perspec-
tives of biology, law, literature,
philosophy, psychology,
sociology and theology, will be
taught by both W&L and MBC
faculties. Professor David
‘Novack and Professor James
Worth will be the main W&L
teachers with visiting lectures
from other W&L professors.

The 3-credit course, which
was born three years ago when
administrators at both schools
decided to encourage students

Offered

‘‘to get to know members of the
opposite sex as people—not just
potential dates,”’ will begin with

a week of supervised reading.
Then, the remaining four weeks

of the course will be at MBC.

Baker Spring, an alumnus of
the course two years ago, noted
that one of his favorite things
about the course that it was an
open seminar and covered
many disciplines.

But the course’s original con-
cept is still the same. ‘‘Let’s
face it,’’ said Professor Sue
Rosser, a founder and MBC’s
co-ordinator, in a national stu-
dent magazine feature on the
course. ‘‘Understanding
masculine and feminine roles is
useful in everything you do
from your personal relation-
ships to your success in the
business world.”

University Federation

Volunteers Are Helping In Many Ways

by Robert Massie

If you happen to be looking for
Paul Koehler on any given Fri-
day afternoon, chances are you
won't be able to find him. Paul,
a senior from El Paso, Texas,
gives his Friday afternoons to
the elderly men and women
housed in the Geriatric ward of
the Western State Hospital in
Staunton, Virginia.

Every Friday after classes,
he and four other volunteers
carpool to Staunton as part of
the Western State ‘‘outreach”
program, only one of the many
such programs co-ordinated
through the University Federa-
tion. There the volunteers may
play basketball with the kids in
Substance Abuse or sit and talk
with the elderly, or just listen to
what the patients have to say.

The students are there to give

the patients something they
rarely have, contact with life
outside Western State. Paul is
the co-ordinator of the pro-
gram, which at present has
about eight volunteers who
travel to Staunton several times
a week. But, all told, there are
over 200 students volunteering
their time to the various pro-
grams the University Federa-
tion offers.

The Federation is headed this
year by Mark Broughton, a
senior from Virginia Beach.
The Federation is strictly
volunteer and _ co-ordinates
several programs aimed at giv-
ing students practical ex-
perience in community aid;
while offering the community
various social services. Big

Conference Held On Library Resources

The function of the
undergraduate college library
and the kinds of conflicting
pressures it must face were the
focus of a two-day conference at
Washington and Lee University
last week involving more than
70 librarians, professors and ad-
ministrators from 15 private

program and a local tutoring
program are just some of the
social services now operating.

The Big Brother program is
co-ordinated by Brian
Ginsberg, a junior from
Narberth, Pennsylvania, and
provides fatherless boys with
students who take them to the
movies, or to a local basketball
game or bowling. The students
are requested to spend a
minimum of B hours a week
with the boys and are encourag-
ed to participate for the full
year. Last semester there were
about 20 Big Brothers and the
number has jumped to about 25
this term.

The community fix up pro-
gram, which has just been
organized, provides student
labor for lower income families
who wish to fix up their homes.
The students do odd jobs such
as painting or fixing the plumb-
ing in homes around the city,

But by far the most popular
program is the tutoring pro-
gram.

Last term about 70 students
visited area schools and helped
the teachers with students who
were having trouble in their
classes. This term the number
of tutors has dropped to about
35, but this is still 4 good turnout
for the program. The tutoring
program is run on a term by
termbasis by Carol Chappel
from her office in the Student
Center.

liberal-arts colleges in Virginia.

The conference, ‘Library
Resources for College
Scholars,’’ was sponsored by
the Washington and Lee
Library as the first in a series of
events leading to the formal
dedication of its new $9-million
building in May.

Maurice D. Leach Jr., head

University Federation y seen
a dramatic surge in student in-
volvement. This year almost
one-sixth of the student body
will be involved in one program
or another and Mark Broughton
attributes much of the increase
to the recent involvement of the
University’s Psychology
department.

‘About 70 percent of the
students involved, volunteer
due to the extra credit the
department offers,’’ says
Broughton. The psychology
department offers extra credit
in Many courses to students
who become involved in one or
more of the programs.

The key idea in the programs
is ‘‘volunteer’’. Whether a stu-
dent is receiving credit for his
work or participating simply
for the satisfaction of helping
someone who needs help, he is
giving up several hours a week
from a busy college schedule.

Whether he is acting as a big
brother to a fatherless child, or
giving an elderly person some-
one to talk to, the student is
helping those around him and
showing a sense of responsibili-
ty to the community in which
Washington and Lee exists, and
for this they should be com-
mended,

If you would like to become
involved in any of the programs
mentioned in the article above,
see Carol Chappell in the Stu-
dent Center or call Mark
Broughton at 463-2355.

W&L librarian, defined the

general topic of the conference

as an examination of the ques-
tion ‘‘what library resources—if
any—are needed to support
research on a small, private,
liberal-arts campus.”’

And in a summary review,
William J. Watt, dean of The
College at Washington and Lee,
described the ‘‘conflicts’’ the
conference had _identified—
‘‘students versus faculty; books
versus machines; shared
resources versus special collec-
tions; balance versus additional
support for new programs; a
directed development of collec-
tions versus meeting faculty
needs or demands.

“But unfortunately,” Watt
said, ‘‘there seems to be no ab-
solute right and no absolute
wrong. Its library is central to
the educational process at any
college or university, and
because the strength of our pro-
grams will determine whether
our institutions survive, these
are critically important ques-
tions for us to consider.

“Solutions will come out of
groups such as this—involving
faculty, students, ad-
ministrators and librarians.”’

Throughout the series of con-
ference sessions, lectures,
panels and small-group discus-
sions, the conference addressed
issues that included:

—Whether : library resources
should be centered solely on the
curriculum or whether _in-
dividuals’ research re-
quirements should also be met;

—Means beyond traditional
collections that might be
employed to support research;

—Whether a small college
should even attempt to promote
research.

—Which techniques for col-
lection development are the
most effective;

The W&L library plans to
publish the proceedings of the
conference later this year.

Ensemble To Appear In Chapel

A performance by the An-
napolis Brass Quintet will con-

clude the Washington and Lee .

University Concert Guild’s
season Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
W&L’s Lee Chapel.

Since its formation several
years ago, the Annapolis Brass
Quintet has become the busiest
and most respected ensemble of
its type both in Europe and in
North America. The group has
made three tours of European
countries in the past 18 months
— including an appearance in
Vienna’s magnificent
Brahmshaal. Its appearance in
that capital of musical tradi-
tionalism marked the first ma-
jor recital ever given in Vienna
by a brass quintet, and the per-
formers were allowed to leave
the stage only after several en-
cores and a standing ovation.

‘The

by Dash Coufal

This is as much a Car] Reiner
movie as it is a Steve Martin
movie. Whereas Martin’s style
as a comedian has been total in-
sincerity, the character he
plays in The Jerk is based on
total sincerity; Martin plays an
oaf, not a sharpie.

Martin plays a black share-
cropper’s son who finds out he is
adopted and so leaves his home
for St. Louis to find his fortune.
He first starts working at a gas
station (where there is a
tremendous scene with some
defective cans) and then at a
carnival where he works guess-
ing peoples weight, selling
pizza-in-a-cup, and running the

In addition to tours during the
concert season, the Quintet has
an impressive list of summer
music festivals to its credit, in-'
cluding the Carinthian Summer
Festival in Austria and the
Casals Festival in Spain. Its
members have recorded per-
formances on numerous com-
mercial labels.

Commenting on their role in
today’s music world, members
of the Quintet mention two
primary aims — rediscovery of
old masterpieces in the brass
repertoire and frequent per-
formances of new compositions
for brass ensembles. Many
famous American and Euro-
pean composers have written
works specially for the An-
napolis musicians, and group
members themselves have
spent years uncovering and

miniature choo-choo. There he
meets a woman stunt-rider who
takes him on as her lover. She is
sooo PUNK and everyone else
in the theatre thought she was
funny, but I didn’t get it;
doesn’t everyone’s girlfriend
dress in black leather?

While running the choo-choo
Martin meets Bernadette
Peters and falls in love with
her, but this S&M mistress
breaks it up. Martin leaves the
carnival to find fame and for-
tune and thus wins her back.

He does find fame and for-
tune, and wins back Ber-

nadette, but then loses it all.

There are some _ hilarious
scenes though of Martin spen-

 

rearranging compositions from
the Renaissance and Baroque
periods.

At Washington and Lee, the
Annapolis Quintet’s program
will include a composition by
W&L music professor Robert
Stewart, as well as pieces by a
host of old and new masters —
Bach, Pezel, Molineux,
deCabezon, Etler, Pauer,
Robert Washburn, Speer and
Susato.

Admission to the concert is by
season ticket or $3 individual
performance fee. In addition,
W&L will sponsor a preconcert
seminar to discuss the music to
be performed Tuesday at 7 p.m.
in the music rooms of the stu-
dent center building. The public
is invited to the seminar free of
charge also.

Jerk’ is Sincere

ding money on all sorts of kitch
things while he is rich: little
bamboo umbrellas for his
drinks, a clam shaped bath tub,
and a scene where he asks for
fresh wine in a French
restaurant.

Martin proves to be as compe-
tant a comedy actor as he is a
stand-up comic. There are no
double takes that plague other
comediens’ acting styles (e.g.
the ever self concious Jimmie
Durantie), nor does the movie
concentrate on Martin at the ex-
pense of other characters.

Bernadette Peters is at the
same time loveable and
moronicly funny. She almost

The Last Picture Show (1971).
Peter Bogdanovich directed
and helped write this powerful
study of sexual mores in a small
Texas town in the early 1950’s.
Ben Johnson and Cloris
Leachman are standouts in a
cast that includes Ellen Burn-
styn, Jeff Bridges, Cybill

tin; as in the restaurant where

‘her reaction to being served

escargots is priceless.

The directing by Reiner
shows that he is a master of
comedy. Each scene is fully
played-out . (unlike MEAT-
BALLS) yes is never over long
(as Woody Allen can be). His
directing is a paradigm.of com-
edy direction; it is clean and
uncluttered.

The Jerk is what Jerry Lewis
movies should have been. It is
missing the two annoying Lewis
elements: pathos and Jerry
himself. Lewis’ movies always
had some sort of a plot that in-
cluded both sympathy for
Lewis’ role, and a_ totally

straight girlfriend for Lewis;
both ruined the comedy by mak-
ing what was funny become em-
barassing for Lewis, and thus
for the audience. The
characters Martin and Peters
play in The Jerk are in the same
vein as the two crazy Czech
brothers on Saturday Night
Live, not the pathetic wretches
Lewis played.

One must remember that a
stand-up-comic can be funnier
than a movie because he doesn’t
have to sustain a plot and can

jump out of character to com-
ment; thus The Jerk isn’t as

funny as Martin’s stage per-
formances, yet it is a funny
movie.

Coppola’s Stallion:‘Well Worth Seeing’

by Paul Hendry

Adapted from Walter
Farley’s well known children’s
novel, “The Black Stallion’’ is
United Artists’ box office sur-
prise of the season. Although
not currently playing in Lex-
ington, ‘“The Black Stallion’ is
well worth seeing for a
refreshing change of pace. It is
not a children’s movie despits
its “G” rating—a label that
usually discourages the crowds.
Not that a child would not enjoy
the tender and often exciting
tale of a boy and his horse that

lies at the heart of the film, but
the deliberate pacing and artful
photography is best ap-
preciated by the more percep-
tive and frequent film-goer.
“The Black Stallion’ is not
artful in such a way that stifles
the entertaining quality of the
movie. The carefully
photographed sea and_land-
scapes, particularly in the first
half, lend a sense of beauty and
mystery to the simple plot that
is seldom seen in commercial
films. ‘‘The Black Stallion’’ was
produced by Francis Ford Cop-

pola. If one were to speculate on
his role in the film making, one
might suggest the influence of
‘Apocalypse Now’ is present in
the spectacular images along
with the creative use of the
score for maximum effect.
“The Black Stallion,”’ like Cop-
pola, seems to maximize der-
rive power from the essential
elements of the medium-sight
and sound-than any other
American filkmaker. _

The plot is streamlined. A boy
is shipwrecked on an island

Review Knocks The Knack

by Mark Kinniburgh

Currently on the record market list are two

noteworthy records that deserve closer inspection
than a look at the album cover. I am speaking of
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ latest release
“Damn the Torpedoes’’ and the Knack’s second
effort ‘“‘The Little Girls Understand.” The reason
for inspection here is to caution against a waste of
money for the Knack album and bring attention to
Petty’s fine work.

With record prices so high now, the purchase of
a new album is a risky task because we cannot
always be sure of the entire album from the basis
of a single played on the radio. The Knack really
does not deceive the public, though, as the song
getting AM radio airplay ‘‘Baby Talks Dirty”’ is
representative, almost to the note, of the rest of
the album. Actually, there is little difference bet-
ween the first and second album, and even then,
the only points of departure are the actual lyrics
themselves. What ‘‘My Sharona’’ did for the
Knack on the first effort is not even approached on
this second fiasco. For sure, the fresh sound of last
summer was a welcome addition to the dry
market of the time, but now all the songs sound the
same. It was as if the contents of ‘‘The Little Girls
Understand”’ was the second of a two record set
that contained ‘‘Get The Knack.”’

The Knack are a marketing wonder and a real
success on tour due to their faithful audience of ad-
ditive engorged eighth grade female types.
Something that does escape me is the appeal that
the absolutely stupid lyrics have to this audience,
because if not degrading, the lyrics are at least the
caliber of eleven year old bathroom jokes. The
cover art and accompanying liner photograph
show pretty much what the Knack is about. On
front, there is a picture of a very young girl look-

ing up knowingly at a street lamp and a group shot
on the back with self-indulgent banter printed with
the idea that the Knack are the future of rock. The
inner sleeve is a panorama of the backseat of a
limosine with the four members of the band wav-
ing to a mob of young girls on the outside. So much
for the Knack-this may be their last album.

Tom Petty provides an excellent example of a
quality product with an ‘A plus” rating all
around. At first, it is not hard to imagine that
‘‘Refugee”’ or ‘‘Don’t Do Me Like That”’ could be
the only stars on the album, because usually we
don’t find a record with more than one or two
great songs. Be prepared for both sides of Petty’s
latest ‘‘Damn The Torpedoes’’ because they are
non-stop rock at its pre-new wave best.

Petty is a veteran of the recording industry,
with several albums to his credit, including the
last one which sponsored ‘‘Breakdown,”’ a minor
AM radio hit. ‘‘Torpedoes”’ is proof the rock and
roll with the British roots of Dave Clark and the
American innovation of Chuck Berry is still alive
and rocking. Besides the two I have mentioned,
my other picks for hits on ‘‘Torpedoes’’ are ‘‘Even
the Losers” and ‘‘Century City’’ but all of them
are good. There will be many more albums from
Tom Petty, but this effort is well worth a listen.

Notes: Linda Lovelace is going to record an
erotic selection from her own poetry for sale to
discos as accompanyment for instrumentals, . . .
Linda Ronstadt’s new album is out and it is much
more rock then ever before. . . Graham Nash’s
new album lacks the direction of his other work
and wallows in lyrics of personal nature and inside
jokes not too enjoyable-so what?. . . Response to
Gary Numan’s performance on Saturday Night
was so great that added concert dates and an ex-
tension of the tour was planned.

friends with the horse. He is
rescued and returns home
where he meets up with an old
farmer, Mickey Rooney, who
just happens to have been a big
man in the world of horse rac-
ing. The plot doesn’t really
thicken much as the boy decides
to race “‘the Black’’ and trains
toward that end. The climatic
race that followsis admirable in
its resistance to follow the lines
of ‘Rocky.’ That climactic
scene is aS equally well show
and as evenly paced as the rest
of the film and completes a
technically well composed pic-
ture.

The only complaint I can
muster is in regard to a certain
looseness in the story and a
slight inconsistancy in em-
phasis. The scenes of the boy
and the horse castaway on the

idyllic island are enchanting in °

their power to evoke raw, inno-
cent emotions. The friendship
between the boy and horse is
carefully cultivated by the
director, and the result is
scense of uncompromising sen-
sitivity. Moments that could
easily become tear jerkers or
pure corn are masterfully

managed. One of the best
scenes is one which the boy
woos the horse into allowing to
be ridden is cleverly shot in the
form of an underwater waltz
with nothing but legs and ocean
floor.

But the second half of the
film, after the rescue, does not
follow through with the develop-
ment of the deep friendship bet-
ween boy and horse that was
established on the island. The
concern with training and rac-
ing seems to be in the way of the
fun of the island days. An old
farm hand, in a scene that
seems to pretend profundity,
suggests that the horse’s soul
suffers as long as he is not free.
Nothing comes of this unex-
pected indictment, because the
horse continues to train and
finally races. During the race
there are flash backs to the
island, perhaps suggesting
either that racing is a form of
play for the horse or that he
yearns for the days long gone.
After the race, the end of the
movie, the link is unclear and
troublesome, despite the open
ending to the story.

Business As Usual

by Bill Whalen

50 miles up I-81 sits University Hall, otherwise
known as ‘The House That Ralph Built.’’ Now surely
you’ve heard of this building. In December and early
January, it was a powerhouse as the Virginia
Cavaliers were ranked in the top ten.

The only problem was that the house rested on some
rather weak timbers and, the whole edifice came
crashing down recently, landing as low as fifth in the
ACC. ;

Meanwhile, there sat another house in the town of
Lexington. This house also supposedly had strong
support, but, as the season progressed, it too. almost
fell victim to a collapse.

But there the story ends. For as the Virginia
Cavaliers exit stage left, fighting and squabbling all
the way, their neighbors, the Washington & Lee
Generals, will remain on the stage for at least two en-
core performances.

If you haven’t heard by now, the Generals captured
the ODAC Tournament last weekend by defeating
three teams in three consecutive nights. Of course, all
of this is even more impressive when one realizes that
the Generals won the championship game by beating
Hampden-Sydney on Sydney’s home court.

In the meanwhile, the Cavaliers will travel to
Greensboro, where they too will probably have to beat
three teams in three straight nights to qualify for the
postseason playoffs.

The only difference between the two teams is that
the Cavaliers will probably fail where the Generals
have succeeded. And the reason for this is that U.Va.
and W&L have two entirely different philosophies
toward athletics.

Take the game of basketball, for example.

At W&L, the sport has been placed in the confines of
Division III regulations, where scholarships are
outlawed. While the players are good, there is more of
an emphasis on academics (at least ideally there is).

Virginia could also promote the ‘“‘academic’”’ aspect
of its program — at least until it started to be known
as “Ralph’s House.” If the Cavaliers are guilty
of anything, they are guilty of turning their basketball
program into a business.

And that is why the University of Virginia is having
such problems. Because of increased pressures from
its fans and financiers, Virginia has to go out and
stomp each of its business rivals (otherwise known as
the rest of the ACC). And so far, all the Cavaliers have
done is stub their toe, rather than stomp anybody.

Let’s face it, when sports become a business, they
just aren’t fun to play. Why else would so many pro-
fessional players be willing to retire at such young

Grapplers Place Second
In ODAC Tournament

by Chris Sisto
The varsity wrestling team
finished out the season last
week with the ODAC champion-
ships at Hampden-Sydney. The
Generals came in second place

with 40 3/4 points and had three

-weight class champions.

Lynchburg College came in
first place with 59 points.
Rouding out the rest of the
teams were Hampden-Sydney
in third with 38 3/4 points and
Maryville finishing last with
nine points.

This is the first time in the
four year tournament history
that the Generals did not come
in first place. The three first
place finishers for the Generals
were Captain Ray Gross at 142
Ibs., senior Ed Rodgers at 158
Ibs., and junior Les Heart at 167
Ibs.

Gross’ win in the final, which
was a 7-0 shutout, was the
fourth time in a row he has won
his weight class. He was also
named the tournament’s Most
Valuable Wrestler.

Said Franke, “The young
wrestlers just couldn’t pick up
the void left by the injuries to
Mike McFadden and Dave
Stoeffel.”” Franke did however

  

i

Ray Gross
have praise for his seniors this
year.

“Joe Wallace at unlimited
and Stoeffel at 167 lbs., did a
fine job for us here,’ said
Franke. And, of course, you
have Rodgers who was a great
leader and Gross who is the win-
ningest wrestler in Washington
& Lee history.”

Gross had a 19-3 overall
record this year and over eighty
wins in his four year career at
the school.

‘Rodger’s win, a 13-1 decision,
avenged a loss in the finals of
the tournament last year to the
current runner-up. Heart’s vic-
tory, a close 14-12 march, was
also the first ODAC title for
him.

 

The Generals finished out
their dual meet season with a
disappointing 3-7 record. They
closed out the year with losses
to George Washington (38-9)
and James Madison (39-12).
The team’s only win came
against Davidson College
(38-18).

The second place finish for
the Generals was not a surprise
for Head Coach Gary Franke,
however, ‘“The team did as well
as expected since there have
been so many injuries in the
lineup, I was, however, pleased

-and surprised by the first place

finish of Les Heart.”’

Franke feels that the main
reason for the team’s first los-
ing record in seven years was
the fact that of the wrestlers
called upon to replace those in-
—" many were inexperienc-

As for the future Franke is
somewhat skeptical about next
season, feeling that the team
has a lot of work to do because
of the graduation of four seniors
and the lack of experience of the
young wrestlers on the roster.

‘‘We have a ways to go, but
I'm fairly optimistic about next
year”

scouting as usual,’’ said Can-
field. ‘‘We stayed with our man-
to-man defense, yet were spur-
red on by _ individual _ per-
formances, such as Scaggs and
Hanson (freshman forward)
gave.”

W&L next faced Eastern
Mennonite’s Royals, a team
which had beaten the Generals
twice during the regular
season. This time it was dif-
ferent as the Generals received
incredible offensive  per-
formances from three ‘‘blues.”’

Smitherman did it all, scoring
22 points and collecting 14 re-
bounds. “‘Robbie’s shooting and
scoring potential has increased
dramatically this year,
especially in the latter part of
the season,” said Canfield.

Jeffries was close behind,
scoring 21 points and grabbing 6
rebounds. The game’s leading
scorer, however, was Clark
New. New scored 24 points,
halfof which came on foul shots,
a major reason why three of
Eastern Mennonite’s starters
fouled out.

Hanson and Scaggs con-
tributed six and eight points,
respectively, yet provided the
defense which, for example,
helped hold the Royal’s guard

Timmy Crawford to 17 points
(Crawford scored 33 points in
Mennonite’s previous win over
W&L).

Comments Canfield: ‘‘All
season long, Hanson and
especially Scaggs, have
sacrificed their offense in order
to concentrate to a greater ex-
tent on defense.’’ As a result,

W&L rolled to a 95-84 victory
over Mennonite and earned the
chance to play Hampden-
Sydney in the finals.

There was Sydney, the home
team, gaining the chance to
play in the O.D.A.C. finals
against W&L, a team it had split
with during the regular season
but had beaten previously at
home, 62-58, in an emotion-
packed game.

But the Generals, as Canfield
said, “believed.”” “The squad
believed in what they could ac-
complish together.”’

It showed.

Down 30-27 at halftime, the
Generals battled back to tie the
score at 56-all with half a
minute left. A missed H-S shot
gave W&L the ball as the clock
ran down to four seconds and
the Generals called time-out.

Comments Canfield, ‘‘Our
plan was to free Robbie
(Smitherman) at the top of the
key and let him shoot.” With 6-6
Ed Owens in his face, Smither-
man arched the 18-foot jumper
home and a stunned Hampden-
Sydney crowd watched their
team fall just short, 58-56, to the
Generals, the new champions.

Smitherman and Spears led
all scorers with 16 points each,
followed by Jeffries with 15.

Once again, W&L’s defense,
sparked by Scaggs and Hanson,
held two Tiger stars under their
season scoring averages. Drew
Payne was held to a team high
12 points (his average was 17)
and Ed Owens held to eight
points (his average was 14).

The Sydney victory gave
W&L a season record over .500
(14-13) for the first time since

Bernot Is Leader Of

Swim Team’s Hopes

by Kip Gordon

They have given up their
winter break in order to prac-
tice, and they will devote their
time this weekend not to the
festivities on campus, but
rather to competition in the
Virginia state meet in Norfolk.
They are the W&L swimmers,
and the amount of time which
they must sacrifice to their
sport is stunning.

Now consider the sport of
swimming itself. Weight train-
ing and countless laps in a pool
are the basic components for
improvement. In other words,
the only way to get better in this
sport is by inflicting pain and p
sical (as well as mental) fatigue
on one’s own body. Why do they
do it?

Sophomore Mike Bernot put it
this way, ‘‘For me the ultimate
goal is to find out just how fast I
can swim. Right now I really
don’t know what my limits are,
and unless I continue swimming
I’ll never find out.”

For Bernot more immediate
goals are presently within his
grasp as he has already
qualified for the Division III
NCAA meet in two events (the
50 and 100 yard freestyles), and
has a strong shot at All-
American honors. He is cur-
rently ranked among the top ten
Division III swimmers in these
events.

Freshman Ken Johnstone, a
sprint specialist, will swim the
50 and 100 yard freestyles and
the 100 yard breast stroke.
Remillard expects his best
showing to come in the 50 and
100 yard freestyles.

Senior captain Bob Newcomb
will be swimming the 50, 100
and 200 yard freestyle events,

and Remillard feels he is
strongest in the 50 and the 100.

Sophomore Herb Gresens will
swim the 100, 200 and 500 yard
freestyles. Remillard predicts
his qualifying threats will come
in the 100 and 200 yard events.

The four swimmers will also
swim three relay events, and,
accordmg to Remillard, the
four-man squad is all but
guaranteed to qualify for na-
tionals in the 400 yard freestyle,

and are strong contenders in the

800 yard freestyle.

But so far Bernot is the only
W&L swimmer to qualify for
the national meet. In order to
qualify for the nationals a
swimmer must beat a standard
time set for his event.

Three other swimmers still
have a chance to qualify and
have set their sights for this
weekend’s state meet. Of these
swimmers, Coach Page Re-
millard said, ‘‘They’re all
swimming very well right now
and I’m confident they’ll all
qualify for nationals. I’m not
sure how the other teams will do
at the state meet, so for our pur-
poses we will be competing
against the clock
weekend.”’

For Mike Bernot the meet will
decide whether he competes in
the NCAA’s in two or three
events. But, for the others, it is
now a matter of making it to the
national meet at all. As Coach
Remillard said, ‘‘Again, they
should all qualify — physically
they have what it takes so it
may be a matter of mental
preparation. But I’m confident
they’ll all be ready — they’ve
given up se much for the chance
to compete at the nationals.”

ages? And why are the Cavalier ball players com-
plaining? Because they’re not having any fun, either.
So when Terry Holland tries to find the culprit for
all his team’s woes, maybe he should look in his own
backyard instead of pointing his finger at his players
or the press. Holland should rightly blame the alumni,

fans and the university’s administration for turning

the UVA basketball program into a conglomerate.

And if you’re not having fun as a Wahoo, Ralph,
then maybe you’d prefer to play ball in Lexington
next year? I think you’d have a good time playing

basketball at W&L.

You can even leave you Snisdeetene’s suit at

home.

Student Control Committee
Chairman Tim Brooks question-
ed the reasoning behind the mo-
tion.

“If different faculty members
have different attitudes, I do not
see where there is unity in the
spirit of. the motion,’”’ said
Brooks.

Junior UC _ Representative
Jeff Bartlett said no one had hit
home on the problem.

Dr. Frednick L. Schwab said
there is a problem which the
students should solve.

Schwab said fraternities have
solved many of their own pro-
blems already, but added, ‘‘the
students should do a better job
in this area.”

Brooks said he still did not
think the area in which the pro-
blems exist had been defined.

He said the Student Affairs
Committee did a report on
academics and fraternities
which is conclusive.

Brooks did not say what the
report concludes, but he hinted

The Ring-tum Phi, February 28, 1980, Page 7

Mid-Week Parties, Bands Attacked

that fraternities are following
the no-weeknight-party rule in
letter.

“I don’t think the faculty
should disclaim the report
simply ‘because they don’t
agree with it,”’ Brooks said

Dr. John M. Evans said that
one house, whioh could not par-
ty for awhile because it was on
social probation, rose from fif-
teenth to fifth in overall
academic standing.

He added that attendance and
preparation is better on
Tuesdays than it is on
Thursdays, after parties,

Spontaneity of parties was
also discussed at length at the
UC meeting.

“I think there is a big dif-
ference between a fraternity
party and the getting together
on a free night of several peo-
ple,” said Evans.

Evans said he is not opposed

to fraternities, but that he is op-

posed to activities which go
counter. to the college. He told

the UC mid-week parties do not
accomplish any good.

At this point of the meeting
Dr. Philip L. Cline called the
question and made a motion to
ban live music from fraternities
during the the week.

The measure was defeated
13-5, with one abstention.

Before the meeting was over
however, Dr. Robert A.
Roberts made several com-
ments.

“The problem here is with
perception, you once found that
fraternities were actively sup-

porting their members in
becoming educated,’’ Roberts
said.

Roberts told the UC the
dissatisfaction is real, as is the
concern.

‘The faculty may be forced to
take some action they may be
reluctant to take,’ Roberts
said.

Roberts also said that dif-
ferent fraternities’ records are
mixed, yet that the perception
of fraternities and not their
records is the problem.

Actor To

Speak
Next Week

Ossie Davis — renowned as
an actor and playwright for
more than 30 years — will be the
guest of Washington and Lee
University next Wednesday,
Mar. 5, for a public lecture and
reception as part of the Student
Association for Black Unity’s
annual ‘‘Black Emphasis
Week.”’

His lecture, scheduled for 8
p.m. in the Warner Center of the
Washington and Lee gym-
nasium, will include dramatic
performances centering on the
development of black American
culture from slavery through
the present.

Davis is the author of three
plays — ‘‘Alice in Wonder,”
“Last Dance for Sybil’? and
‘‘Purlie Victorious,’’ his best-
known work, which opened on
Broadway in 1962.

He is most familiar to the
public, however, as an actor,
with dozens of roles to his
credit. He began his career with
the Rose McClendon Players or
Harlem, and after service with
the U.S. Army in World War II,
became a featured player on
Broadway in such plays as
Mare Connelly’s ‘‘Green
Pastures,’’ Lorraine
Hansbury’s ‘‘A Raisin in the
Sun,” ‘“‘The Wisteria Trees,”’ in
which he appeared with Helen
Hayes, and the musical

Ending the week’s activities
will be the traditional ball for
students and their guests in

ing, Mar. 8. Music for the dance
will be provided by ‘‘Standing
Room Only”’ of Richmond.

“Black Emphasis Week”’ is a
project of W&L’s Student
Association for Black Unity
(SABU), and friends of the
university as well as faculty,
students and staff are en-
couraged to participate in all
the events. Established in 1972,
the week of events is designed
‘to bring to the cemmunity’s at-
tention some of the many ac-
complishment’s, idiosyncrasies
and problems of blacks in
America today.”

said Vines to the EC.

In one incident Vines related
to the EC, a member of the ‘‘cli-
que’ which frequently uses the
SELC got a loan to buy a new
transmission for his car.

Vines said members of the
group still come to him fre-
quently and constitute 95 per-
cent of the SELC’s business.

After explaining .how one
group has monopolized the
SELC, Vines made several sug-
gestions to remedy the situa-
tion.

He told the EC that persons
who did not repay their loan
within 30 days should pay a
small daily interest on their
loan.

Vines also said he wanted the
power to grant $50 loans
himself, but that the power to
give loans greater that than $50
should rest with the four-
member committee.

The Committee is composed
of two members of the Cold

Check Committee and two
members of the Student Control
Committee.

Though all members of the
Committee are to be present at
emergency loan meetings, ac-
cording to the Committee’s
policies as stated in the student
handbook, Vines said when he
took over the Committee it was
policy for small loans to be
given out by the chairman.

Loans are not always paid
back within 30 days, as required
in the SELC’s statement of
policies, Vines said.

Vines also told the EC that the
emergency loans are not funded
through fines levied by the SCC,
as stated in the Committee’s
policy, but that loans come
from the EC’s reserve fund.

ed discussion and voting on the

parts.

Willis agreed and his first mo-
tion was that the Chairman be
allowed to grant $50 loans if he
reported the loans to the EC
once a month. The motion also
called for persons needing loans
larger than $50 to approach the
whole Committee.

The motion failed by a 9-2
margin, and Ould and Jay
Blumberg, Senior Represen-
tative, said the EC should con-
sider the SELC’s size and com-
position.

Junior Rrepresentative
Bruce Poole suggested the

clude six members, with four
members making a quorum.
Poole said the EC should select
the members at large from the

The motion passed 7-4, but
was replaced by a later vote
which charged the SELC to five
members, and eliminated the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Leiters

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Party Problem

Once again the faculty is dissatisfied with the
fraternities and their mid-week partying. And once
again the actual problems perceived by the faculty
are only vaguely defined—issues, when presented,
are not addressed but skirted.

The complaint this time is that while the “‘letter of
the law”’ is being obeyed, the ‘‘spirit”’ is not—or so the
faculty says. Parties are still being held during the
week at fraternity houses and the faculty is restive
about the situation. However, the problems the facul-
ty claimed it was trying to solve have been solved;
this further action only demonstrates that the pro-
blems the faculty said it was addressing were not the
real problems the faculty had in mind.

Consider the problems put forth last year:
—Noise during the week is no longer a problem;
—Police confrontations during the week are no longer
a problem (as evidenced by the decline in arrests and
complaints for noise violations);
—The feeling of compulsory attenda ce to protect
financial interests, which seemed a major concern of
those pushing for tbe party ban, has been eliminated
by changes in the financing of parties—now only those
students who wish to party pay.

The notion of enhancing the academic atmosphere
on campus by legislating conduct is as absurd as at-
tempting to legislate morality. A set of rules does not
change attitude.

Spontaneous parties are acceptable, says another,
and the planned party is not spontaneous. But a stu-
dent who is in control of his work load ean determine
whether he can budget his work and plan a night off,
or part of a night off, and which night it will be. Those
who cannot judge their schedules are going to get in
trouble no matter what the temptations.

The faculty apparently perceives a problem in
academic attitude but is focusing attempts to change
the attitude on the wrong issues. The problems caused
vy the mid-week parties as defined by the faculty last
year have been solved. Until other real problems can
be defined and addressed, and the causes of the pro-
blems determined, further attempts at legislating
student conduct is unjustified and can be likened to
the wild swingings of a man with a stick who hears a
noise in the dark.

The faculty is challenged, then, to present solid
arguments and justification for its actions that affect
student liberties. Let it define a specific problem,
justify its reasoning for selecting the focus of the pro-
blem, and explain just how the action will solve the
problem. This is the only way intelligent men make
decisions.

Students and faculty both must be constantly aware
of the problem of misperceptions surrounding the
‘ssues. All actions or considerations by the faculty
concerning fraternities are not an attempt to close
them down or destroy student freedoms. But not all
the problems of attitude and atmosphere on campus
are rooted in fraternity functions. If both sides would
keep these basic concepts in mind then perhaps the
problems that do exist can be solved in a proper man-
ner,

And yes, we know the faculty has the power and the
authority to rule over student life. But shouldn’t it at
least consider that students also have a legitimate
claim on the choices of their lives? Study halls might
be a solution to the problem, but should a college
become a prep school?

Faculty
Theft

Situation

Cleared Up

Dear Editor:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to lay to rest my re-
cent allegation that a faculty
member stole my watch.

I had originally wanted to
avoid pursuing the matter due
to personal reasons.

However, I felt there existed
a responsibility to the student
body and to the other segments
of the University to point out
what appeared to be an honor
violation — thus, I wrote to the
Phi concerning my experience.

My letter precipitated an in-
vestigation by the administra-
tion in which I agreed to take
part.

Let me state that the matter
has been looked into, both to my
satisfaction and to that of the
administration.

No honor violation did, in
fact, occur. Circumstances
were such that I honestly
believed a theft had occurred,
but this was definitely not the
case.

Mullins Replies To Charges

Dear Editor:

In his vitrolic letter, replying
to my charges, Mr. White called
me a liar, accused me of
violating the honor system, of
juvenile behavior and of
ethnocentricism. Since the only
point in my letter which he
disputed is the amount of the fee
paid Carmichael, this must be
the cause of my naughtiness.

I could be wrong as to the ex-
act dollar amount, but I was
told $2000 by a faculty member
and it will take the word of a
better man than Mr. White to
convince me that I am wrong.
Even if the fee were less than
$2000, the basic premise of Car-
michael the revolutionary
engaging in _ capitalist
endeavors still stands.

The other points were
unrefuted by Mr. White. Indeed,
when he insists on calling Car-
michael ‘‘Brother Kwame
Toure,’’ he shows the same sort
of attitude as Carmichael,
posturing as some keep while
enjoying all the advantages ac-
cruing to an American.

Mr. White was worried about
my letter ‘‘imperiling the tran-
quility of the campus communi-
ty,” presumably by causing
racial strife. We are fortunate
at W&L in having so few
negroes that there is no danger
of that.

Mr. White may write that
“SABU will not be dictated to’’
but, as an organization funded

by the University, it remains:

open to comments from Editor's Note: Mr. White is not a

students and faculty. And, any
faculty member who accuses a
student of creating an outright
lie should be able to prove his
claim. If, as is the case with Mr.
White, he cannot, he should be
dismissed from the faculty.

the language used was offensive
and inappropriate.

From The Editor’s Desk

Thoughts On Fancy Dress

The EC might have kept the price of Fancy Dress tickets for the
student body at last year’s prices, but if you’re dealing on the open
market you’re in trouble.

The latest report we’ve heard is that FD tickets are selling on the
black market for as much as $40. We’re not sure who would pay
such an outrageous price but one scalper explained that ‘‘when
some alumnus brings his wife all the way from Atlanta, he’ll pay
any price to go to the dance.”

We'll have to see...

At least two W&L seniors started the weekend early—on Monday.
One of them was admitted into law school and thought an ap-
propriate celebration would be to fly to Wyoming to visit a friend.

Of course no one believed they would actually do such a crazy and
expensive thing—until they phoned from Atlanta enroute.

The latest word is that Wyoming is even more boring than Lex-
ington and they will return in time for all the parties before tom-
morrow’s dance...

One of the unreported tidbits about the Big Dance is that W&L
didn’t get sued. You see, Parker Brothers has a copyright on their
Monopoly game which they invoke whenever they get wind of so-
meone using their game for other purposes. The object isn’t to get
more money but to stop the exploitation of their product.

Apparently, one of W&L’s distinguished lawyers told the SAB to
go ahead because they are a non-profit organization. Of course an
untimely suit would have ruined FD. Maybe it’s a good thing the
SAB isn’t making the $8,000 profit on the dance they had originally
planned for... othe nag gn

The Politics of Afghanistan

Public apathy as is illustrated by low voter tur-
nouts has characterized our electoral process
throughout the 70’s. In the past few months
however, international crises in Iran and
Afghanistan have sharply focused public attention
on the: 1980 Presidential race. Although it is
reassuring to see that the public has become more
willing to take an active role in our political pro-
cess, these international crises have diverted
public attention from the most significant issues
with which Americans have been preoccupied
since 1976, inflation and energy.

In fact, the inability of our nation to decrease its
dependence on foreign oil is precisely the reason
why the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan poses a
threat to our security. If the United States had laid
aside partisan interests and developed an energy
policy which could reduce our dependence on Per-
sian Gulf oil, the urgency and tension surrounding
the Afghanistan invasion would not be nearly as
great as is now evident. In President Carter’s own
terms, ‘‘world peace’ would not be so gravely en-
dangered.

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan indirectly
brings into focus the United States’ most pressing
domestic problem, double digit inflation. This con-
temporary round of inflation has two major com-
ponents — energy consumption and the federal
government’s deficit spending. Our dependence
on external sources of oil has forced the Ad-
ministration to greatly increase defense spending,
thereby expanding the federal deficit and adding
to the already great inflationary pressures.

Before the 1973 oil embargo, the United States
paid $6 Billion for imported oil. In 1980 it is
estimated that the U.S. will pay $100 Billion for im-
ported oil. Over the next five years, the U.S. will
pay $500 Billion to OPEC. The U.S. cannot even
hope to effectively combat inflation if we are to
continue to pay this excise tax to the OPEC na-
tions. Moreover, the military and foreign aid ex-
penditures that will be necessary to safeguard our
sources of oil will only increase deficit spending
and aggravate the inflationary spiral. Therefore,
the most significant way in which the United
States can guarantee its security and help reduce
inflationary pressures is by creating a serious
energy policy which can dramatically reduce U:S.
dependence on foreign oil.

Not only have the Iranian and Afghanistan
crises exposed our weak and dependent energy
situation, they have dramatically changed the for-
tunes of the Democratic presidential candidates.
The international crises havehad little discernible
effect on the Republican race. President Carter
has utilized these crises as a rallying point for his
campaign and has been quite effective in doing so.

The resurrection of the Carter campaign can be
directly attributed to what the public perceives as
skillful handling of the international situation by
the President. More specifically the President has
assumed a popular hard-line stance toward the
Russians after theinvasion of Afghanistan. The
President has denied the Russians American
grain, technology transfers, cultural exchanges
and has called for a boycott of the Summer Olym-
pics to be held in Moscow.

The Administration’s foreign policy has
transformed from a three year old policy of ac-
commodation to one which resembles the ‘‘Dulles
policy of containment,’’ as is manifest by the
strengthening of ties to China and offers of aid to
Pakistan, India and Turkey. These reactionary
Carter policies are a direct outgrowth of the

heightening frustration of the American public in —

an election year, a public frustrated by the im-
punity with which terrorists hold Americans
hostage in Iran, the inability of the U.S. to restrain
OPEC price increases, the declining value of the
working man’s wages and the blatant Soviet
disrespect for international laws.

The President’s recent show of strength against
the challenge posed by Senator Kennedy
demonstrates the effectiveness with which the
President has used the crises to deflect criticism
of the policies of his first three years in office.

This recent foreign policy shift starkly contrasts
with the President’s previous record and perhaps
his very essence as a man. The President has ask-
ed Congress for a substantial increase in defense
expenditures, has tabled consideration of Salt II
(temporarily), has proposed the development of a
rapid development force thereby increasing
American military presence abroad, and has call-
ed for reinstatement of draft registration for men.
He has also appealed to Congress to include
Women in draft registration.

No measure smacks of political maneuver as
does the reinstatement of draft registration. The
President claims that it is a gesture of American
resolve to restrain Soviet expansion. In essence it
is an astute political move to convey to the
American people that Carter is a firm and resolute
leader. Moreover, by recommending to Congress
that women be included in the draft, the President
has appealed to the sensibilities of ERA sup-
porters, while leaving the political hot potato in
the hands of Congress. Since passage of a Congres-
sional amendment to include women in draft
registration is unlikely, Carter will not lose sup-
port from either supporters or opponents of ERA.

Moreover, there appears to be little numerical
need for the draft at the present time. The army is

More On
Mullin Letter

Dear Editor:

About John L. White’s
response to David Mullin, I
have a few words.

I believe it’s a well known fact
that on this campus, lying is a
very serious offense. So much
so, that accuasations of lying
should never be made lightly.

For this reason, if White is go-
ing to charge Mullin with lying,
he had better be willing to
substantiate his claim. In his
letter he does not.

In fact, he himself seems to
be confused as to whether
Mullin is guilty of lying, or is
merely mistaken. There exists
a great difference between the
two.

Moreover, White’s con-
spicuous omission of the actual
cost of Carmichael’s speaking
engagement gives his whole
argument a rather insincere
ring.

I propose that we all learn
from White that irresponsible
criticism is never a very good
rebuttal of irresponsible
criticism.

KNO COULD §E VALUAB- ets Dear Editor:
I was greatly taken aback

when I read the letter of Mr.
Brian Ginsburg printed in the
Ring-tum Phi of February 14,
1980 (Vol. LXXIX, Number,19).
I publically ask Mr. Ginsburg
two questions. Firstly, who has
appointed you, above everyone,
to decide which posters on cam-
pus are garbage? Secondly,
what possible right do you have
to take down anybody’s
posters?

Mr. Ginsburg, you were of-
fended by the fact that the
posters were unsigned. Sir, this
pales into insignificance com-
pared to your conduct. You
have taken it upon yourself to
decide what views will be heard
and then deliberately suppress-
ed what you don’t like. If the YD
and CRs can post political
posters, then everyone can,
regardless of whatever you
think. Furthermore, I believe
that you owe a public apology to
those who authorized the
posters you removed and to the
University community as a
whole for disgracing this liberal
arts institution.

Unfortunately, conduct like
yours has happened before and
will probably happen again.
During the election of 1932, the
Nazis often would take down the
posters of the opposition.
Perhaps if the SA still existed,
you could do this professionally.

Gary Langan Goodenow, ’80

Dear Editor:

To Mr. Brian Ginsburg, who,

last issue, attempted so
presumptuously to detend nis

misdeeds with some anti-draft
posters. I have the following
things to say.

First, the attachment, in a
non-damaging manner, of
posters and notices on the walls
is presently the most effective
means of general inter-student
communication available on
campus. It makes possible a
whole host of necessary univer-
sity activities from private and
commercial transactions to
campus events and activity op-
tions to the broader field of in-
telectual and political issues
that have a bearing on the lives
of a significant number of W&L
students. Granted that this
function could be fulfilled more
efficiently (say by the strategic
placement of large covered sur-
faces specifically designated
for such communications);
nonetheless, it is a tool that has
become valuable to many in-
dividuals and student groups
alike as well as helping to
cultivate the active and con-
troversial intellectual environ-
ment which is cardinal to any
academic institution.

Second, and of greatest im-
port, is the fact that neither the
notices nor the walls were Mr.

See GINSBURG, page 12

International Affairs Are | Ginsburg Attacked
Key To Pres. Election

(continued from page 11)

not having trouble maintaining the number of new
recruits to fill the volunteer army. Rather the real
problem is that the reserve is greatly shorthanded
and not enough experienced and skilled soldiers
are choosing to re-enlist. Since 1972, the purchas-
ing power of military personnel has declined
dramatically. As a stop-gap measure, a bill is
before Congress which will increase the pay of
military personnel 3.41 percent in excess on the
annual increase which will be given to all federal
employees. This bill is indicative ofthe need to
make the pay of military personnel competitive
with private industry in order to help induce the
re-enlistment of skilled personnel. Reinstatement
of the draft or draft registration Will not solve this
problem.

Thus it seems that President Carter is allowing
political consideration to influence his responses
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Presi-
dent is using the crisis to shift attention from the
inflation rate which grew during his term from an
“unacceptable’’ 6 percent in 1976 to the highest
peacetime inflation rate since immediately after
WW ILat 13.3 percent in 1979.

Moreover, Carter’s hard line stance toward the
Soviets and increased defense spending stands in

contrast to his decisions to cancel the development

of the neutron bomb and the B-1 bomber and the
Administration’s original 1976 campaign goal of
total nuclear disarmament. The Carter Ad-
ministration’s failures in gaining a consensus on
the windfall profits tax or practically any energy
legislation now seem equally remote from the
public’s attention.

Thus the international situation has rallied the
nation behind the President much to the dismay of
Senator Kennedy and Governor Brown. The initial
stumbling and subsequent deflation of the Ken-
nedy campaign has forced the Senator to
definitively take a stand on the controversial
energy issue. Kennedy has stated that he endorses
the use of either gas rationing or a stiff excise tax
on gas in order to reduce consumption and
dependence on oil imports. This solution is
perhaps the only means of immediately reducing
the nation’s consumption of oil.

Either measure is harsh and likely to be un-
popular in an election year. An increase in the tax
on gasoline will provide money for development of
alternate sources of energy and will make other
fuels more competitive with gas. A high tax on
gas, however, will place an undue burden on the
poor, who have already been devastated by
unabated inflation. Gas rationing is a more
equitable means of reducing consumption but any
absolute restriction placed on the amount of fuel a
person can use is also likely to be unpopular.

Although Senator Kennedy appears to be grop-
ing for issues in which he can oppose the Presi-
dent, he has decided to remain in the race for the
duration. Even though Kennedy was beaten in
New Hampshire, the Senator realizes that the
volatile international situation could work to his
advantage as quickly and decisively as it has for
Carter.

All Jerry Brown can do is watch with anguish as
Carter rides this recent crest of his popularity.

 

Brown’s highly publicized flip-flop on the Proposi-
tion 13 issue following its passage has given the
Governor a credibility problem. Brown’s only
chance to become a serious challenger for the
Democratic nomination was to score heavily in a
public debate against Carter and Kennedy.

The nation’s mood seems to be shifting toward
the right — away from the progressive stance with
which Brown is usually associated. Since Carter
now finds it expedient to run a Rose Garden cam-
paign and avoid a public debate, Brown has little
hope of establishing himself as a candidate with a
serious chance to capture the nomination.

Hollins Replies

Dear Mr. Leachman:

I read with great interest your letter to the
Hollins Columns and feel a reply is definitely in
order.

In addition to the expense of gas for the trip
twice a week to and from Lexington, we also incur
other minor monetary setbacks, including board-
ing houses for weekend dates and coffee or No-
Doze to keep us awake on the trip back. But
seriously, we are not really concerned with the
petty point of who spends more money. .

Although most of the other schools in the area
have facilities capable of handling large crowds
with little or no danger of destruction to property,
we at Hollins do not. Our choices are either to have
private parties, outdoor parties, impossible until
later inthe spring, or parties in the Rathskeller.

Expenses incurred in Rathskeller parties in-
clude security, entertainment, and damage
deposits. For every 100 people attending a party
on the Hollins campus there must be one security
guard. Each officer is paid $22.50 for a three hour
period. In addition to the 1 per 100 ratio indoors,
there are a number of guards outdoors for traffic
control, also paid the same amount.

While most fraternities have a brother who pro-

’ vides music or a music system belonging to the

house, we have no such facilities; therefore we
must hire someone to serve us in this capacity. An
average charge for this service would be between
$25 and $50 per hour.

For any party on this campus, a damage deposit
must be paid. For parties over a certain number of
people or which are held in certain places, this
deposit is not wholly refundable.

Also, the Rathskeller, although on property own-
ed by the college, is maintained under separate
management and has the right to charge for the
beer they serve. Our cover charges, too, are paid
by everyone.

I resent the tone implied in your letter, but as
this is a factual rebuttal, I shall not breach this
subject. Suffice to say that your letter was not one
of the more pleasant things I have read.

In closing I wish to say that I hope I have helped
to clarify some of our reasons behind our cover
charge policy.

Ginsburg’s property. In addi-
tion, Mr. Ginsburg is no official
representative of the Universi-
ty. Therefore this makes Mr.
Ginsburg guilty of vandalism
and theft of private property,
which is an honor code violation
anda crime.

At such time as_ legal
representatives of Washington
and Lee University ownership
request that its property be kept
clear of all such literature (as is
and ought to be the perogative
of ownership) I, for one, will
cease this practice. But until
such time, I not-so-respectfully
request that Mr. Ginsburg and
associates discontinue their
criminal activities and allow
the free individuals of this
university to peacefully conduct
their affairs, unharrassed.

C. K. Sawyer ’83°

Dear Editor:

I am basically a tolerant per-
son about most things written or
spoken (i.e. I am usually too
shiftless to react to anything I
see, read, or hear). But the
repugnance of Brian Ginsburg’s
letter, written to the Editors

before vacation, extends
beyond my tolerance and com-
pels me to react.

First of all, his logic stinks.
Those signs were not an attack

~ on General Westmoreland but a

simple statement of political
principles. Those people behind
the signs were not cowards.
They identified themselves by
wearing black armbands on the

day of Westmoreland’s speech.

 

Finally the act itself, and the
Spasmotic sanctimony that
motivated it, repugns my sen-
sibilities as an American. In our
views, Ginsburg and I agree. I
want to see the economic,
political and military vigilance
of the United States restored to
the levels of the pre-Vietnam
sixties. But we conservatives
obviously have nor cornered the
market on brains. Other valid
views exist and ought to be ar-
ticulated. I, like Ginsburg, want
to see the sovereign integrity of
the republic maintained against
the external threat posed by the
U.S.S.R. But what is the use of
defending the republic from
without if we destroy her from
within—by denying the basic
democratic right of self-
expression from minoritarian
opinions?

After all, the freedom -of
speech, without fear of reprisal
is a fundamental inalienable,
and sacred right of every
American—that right that
makes us a democracy in fact,
not in appearance (remember
the Soviets’ government, on the

_surfact, is very democratic).

Ginsburg’s bogus sense of
aesthetics and his empty in-
tellectual arrogance in pulling
down the signs is tantamount to
unilateral censorship. I am
most distressed to see that the _
totalitarian psyche still lives in
late 20th century America.

tended),

Sunday Party Fie

Violation
Dismissed

by Ross Newell

The Interfraternity Council,
during its meeting Tuesday
night, investigated a Sunday
fraternity party in violation of
IFC rules and decided not to
take any action.

The party, held by Phi Kappa
Sigma, Delta Tau Delta, Beta
Theta Pi and Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, violated the rules because
it ran past 6 p.m. on Sunday.
IFC rules require that Sunday
parties end at 6 p.m. because
this is recognized as the time
when the coming school-week
begins.

A spokesman for the frater-
nities said a band that the
fraternities had signed was
scheduled to stop playing at
6:00; however, because of dif-
ficulties, they could not start
playing until 3 P.M. The party
continued until 7 p.m., the
spokesman said, because the
band had to be payed $700 and it
would not have been worth this
price if they had only played for
three hours.

Also, he said the Saturday
blizzard had prevented some of
the fraternities involved from
having bands Saturday night
and their houses wanted to have
at least one band during Fancy
Dress weekend.

Also, during the meeting, Rob
Brooke and Monty Briscoe were
nominated for IFC president.
For vice-president, Chip
Nunley, John Northington and
Hall Vetterlein were
nominated. All fraternity
members can vote in the elec-
tion which will be held Monday
in conjunction with the student
body elections.

Nominations are open until 8
a.m. Friday and additional
nominations are to be reported
to IFC president Syd Farrar or
to Carole Chappell in the
University Center.

 

IFC Weekend

Regarding IFC weekend, it is
scheduled for March 22. The
Good Humour Band has been
signed and another band is be-
ing sought. Approximately 40-50
kegs of beer will be provided at
the party and non-fraternity
members will be charged
around $10 per couple to attend
the party.

Return To
Communities,

Davis Urges

by Ed Edge

The responsibility of minority
students, as well as all other
black students, once they have
been educated, is to not turn
their back on their origin, but
return to their communities and
pass down the cultural riches to
younger generations, Ossie
Davis said last night in his
speech at Washington and Lee’s
Warner Athletic Center.

Davis was presented by the
university’s Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity as their
third speaker for this ninth an-
nual ‘‘Black Emphasis Week.”’

_He stated that a person who
belongs to a minority group can
only advance as far in life as the
others that are in his minority
group, adding that he must
have a ‘‘power base”’ of his peo-
ple under him to back him.

“We (blacks) never had the
same opportunities to get ahead

Untenured Teachers In Tough Job Competition

by Mike Perry
Declining enrollments, coupl-
ed with an increasingly com-
petitive teaching job market,
make the frustrations suffered
by untenured teachers here at
Washington and Lee typical of
the national situation.
Approximately 63.5 percent of
the nation’s full-time faculty
members’ have tenure.
Washington and Lee’s 75 per-
cent ranks well above this na-
tional average.

Petitions Filed With EC

Only one petition for each of
the Excutive Committee “Big
Three” positions was submitted
Monday night.

Filing petitions were Rob
Willis for president, Willie
Macke for Vice-president, and
Bud White for secretary.

Elections will be held Monday
from 9-4, Polls will be set up in
the quad, the law school, and in
front of the commerce school.

Candidates are limited to 30
campaign posters, two banners,
and a $20 spending limit. Write-
in candidates are subject to the
same rules.

This increase in the number
of tenured faculty members
serves only to increase the com-
petitive nature of the teaching
job market. ‘“‘The person who
loses out on tenure is angry,”
says Jordan Karland, national
associate secretary of the
American Association of
University Professors (AAUP).
“If he came along five or 10
years ago, he would have made
it ina breeze.”

everywhere,’ .Sheldon H.
Knorr, Maryland State Com-
missioner for Higher Educa-
tion, told the Baltimore Sun.
“Tenure is going to be much
more carefully granted now.”
Still, there are variations
from state to state. Public in-
stitutions tend to have a higher
tenure ratio (66.4 percent) than
private institutions (56.2 per-
cent) and some states such as
Washington (72.3 percent) have
a particularly high percentage
of tenured faculty members as
compared to a less tenured
areas such as the District of
Columbia with 27 percent.
University administrators

must continually concern
themselves with maintaining
their flexibility to deal with
‘changing enrollments in
various academic disciplines.
Currently, interest in such
liberal arts as history and
philosophy is on the wane while
enrollments climb in business
and engineering programs.
Educators say they must
carefully portion faculty spots
leading to tenure where enroll-
ment demands are greatest.
Those teachers competing for
the limited number of tenured
positions now must amass glow-
ing credentials in three areas:

Candidates For Secretary Square Off On Issues

by Joe Scott

Candidates for Washington
and Lee’s big three Executive
Committee positions discussed
and debated their views
Wednesday night in the Nor-
thern Undergraduate Library
auditorium.

Bob Willis is running unop-
posed for EC president while
Willy Mackie is the only entrant
tor the vice-presidential spot.
Three persons are entered for
secretary; Bud White, Robert
Neely and Dan Weiss. Neely
and Weiss are write-in can-
didates.

Elections for the positions
will be held Monday, March 10.
Differences in the secretary
candidates views are listed
below.

White Book changes

Weiss-‘‘Honor has not chang-
ed that much over the years’”’
Every year brings up its own
situations. Changes are impor-
tant. Regarding the honor code,
‘Re-education of classes could

be important. I also think that if
you put all the honor informa-
tion into one packet it would be
helpful.”

Neely-Freshmen orientation
is probably the most important
thing the EC does in the beginn-
ing. We are supposed to be
representatives of the student
body.’’ Honor is very important
tome.

White-‘‘Upperclassmen don’t
need to be reindoctrinated. I
don’t think it is necessary.”’
When a change is instituted it
should be adhered to. Freshmen
orientation could have more
emphasis placed on the honor
code.

Coeducation

White-‘‘The disadvantages
outweigh the advantages at this
time. It would hurt the system
more than it would help.

Weiss-‘‘The survey idea was a
good one. I agree with Bob
Willis’ idea of increasing the ex-
change program. It would ex-
pand discussion in classes.

$1.2 Million —
To Grow

Seaweed

Guess what you paid for. A
$1.2 million project to grow
seaweed on the Pacific Ocean
floor and try to use it for
energy.

General Electric Co. was
given the grant by the Energy
Department to transplant 100
kelp plants in the ocean even
though DOE scientists sug-
gested growing the seaweeds
“under well-controlled condi-
tions...on land-based aquatic
test sites.”

The kelp had all been washed
away within two months and the
project was a $1.2 million
failure.

The project and others were
disclosed in an internal DOE
report outlining millions of
dollars in worthless projects.

Record Review

Linda Ronstadt’s

By Mark Kinniburgh

Linda Ronstadt has a new album out on Asylum
Records, and if you liked the old Linda Ronstadt,
Mad Love is for you. Linda has been accused of
failing to live up to her debut solo album since
1970, partly because of the quality of Heart like a
Wheel, but even more so because of the early sup-
port she gained from her California Buddies, the
Eagles.

It seemed that when Linda departed from the
easy country feel of that first release she would be
charged with selling out to the popular side of the
music business. Time was when the The Eagles
and Linda Ronstadt were mentioned in the same
breath as being the same stylistically and of one
big musical family. Despite the constant
criticism, Linda has continued what could best be
described as a metamorphosis from one style of
musical expressions to the next, while never
forgetting the previous stage.

While some critics felt that the last album, Liv-
ing in the USA, was the definitive sell-out, (Look at
that!!! Roller Skating on the cover in a disco get-
up!!), there was a definite originality and identity
that was Ronstadt. Even more important about
Living is that it stands as a transition between the
Ronstadt of the East Coast and the Ronstadt of the
West Coast. Back in the West, the relaxed artist
comes through in the environs of Los Angeles
again with an album of the quality and consistence
of Heart Like A Wheel.

Mad Love is not many things, and that is what
makes it such a complete record. Number one, it
is not a highly polished, technically flawless album
thereby devoid of any personality. With someone
of the talent of Ronstadt there is a danger of mak-
ing a perfect record without feeling because
realistically, the caliber of musicians is high and

 

and reception that evening at 8 p.m., to mark the
opening of the exhibition in the library's Northen
Auditorium. The public is invited both to view the
exhibition and to attend the reception. The artist's
exhibition at Washington and Lee will continue
through April 12.

‘Mad Love’

rarely would make those little mistakes that re-
mind the listener that an artist is human be made.

Secondly, Mad Love is not a copy of any other
Ronstadt album, nor does it depart from being ob-
viously a Linda Ronstadt album. The feeling is
there, the vocal hook that sets Linda apart from
the rest in its sensual phrasing is there, and to put
all the pieces together, the music selection is
outstanding.

My favorites are the title cut Mad love and the
Elvis Costello tune Girls Talk, one of three
Costello songs on the album. Another favorite that
is getting a great deal of attention on the AM air-
waves is Hurts so Bad the old popular song which
Linda handles in her own soulful way.

Reading the liner notes one will notice the new
force behind the Ronstadt of the West in the person
of Mark Goldenberg who has replaced Andrew
Gold as Linda’s favorite writer and musical com-
panion. Goldenberg supplies several of the albums
songs and, according to Ronstadt, is the next best
writer in rock to Elvis Costello. The listener
should not be afraid of the criticism that this
album is the new wave Linda because even though
there is a Costello influence and it may seem at
first listen that there has been a real change, with
further spins the old Ronstadt will come through
and be just as strong as before.

Next week look for a review of the new Elvis
Costello by quest commentator John Cole...Heart
has a new album on CBS records and it’s called
Bebe Le Strange...Johnny Winter is back with
another one called Raisin’ Warren Zevon’s latest
on E/A is called Bad Luck Streak in Dancing
School...Pink Floyd is still at number one on all
major record rating charts...Queen is writing and
recording the complete soundtrack to Dino
Delaurentis’ production of Flash Gordon...

_—— Film Notes

The Front (1976) Martin Ritt’s look at the red scare of the 1950’s
as it affected a portion of the entertainment business in New York
during the McCarthy era. Woody Allen, starring in his first non-
directoral film, provides the movie’s comic highs as a small time
bookie who poses as the author of television scripts written by a
blacklisted friend. The story bogs down into pathos with Zero
Mostelas an aging comic who finds his career and life ruined by
communist witch-hunting. Not a comedy. Presented by the SAB,
March 7th, 8th, and 9th, at 7 and 9 p.m. in Dupont auditorium. Ad-
mission is $1. ;

 

The Passenger (1975) Starring Jack Nicholson and Marie
Schneider, presented by the Film Society. A discussion appears in
this issue of the Ring-tum Phi.

The Garden of the Finzi-Contini’s (Italy, 1971) Directed by Vit-
torio DeSica, one of the original Italian neorealists. One of his last

characeristically sentimental. To be shown in Reid 203, Tuesday

Film Society Presents

Antonioni’s “The Passenger’

by Jay Norfleet

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will screen
Michelangelo Antonioni’s The
Passenger (1975) on Friday and
Saturday, March 7 and 8, at 8
p.m. in classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis
Hall. Admission is free and
everyone is cordially invited.

Antonioni’s works before The
Passenger constitute some of
the landmarks in New Wave
cinema: L’Avventura (1960),
Red Desert (1964), and Blow Up
(1966). In these films, Antonioni
explores the uneasiness and
lack of meaning in the lives of
upper middle class people, and
the way they bring meaning in-
to their lives. ThePassenger is

-also in this vein.

The plot revolves around a
documentary news reporter
who seeks to change places with
a man whose death he
discovers. The man has been a
gunrunner for a group of
African revolutionaries and the

The. Nighthawks Return

by Ross Newell

The Nighthawks are schedul-
ed to appear in the Cockpit next
Friday night and the show pro-
mises to be so hot that it might
start the spring thaw early.

The Hawks played at the 1980
Winter Olympics and sources
close to the scene say that the
American hockey team used
energy from the band’s power-
ful brand of rock ’n roll to help
them pound the teams from
Russia and Finland.

If you get into blues and good
music, you too will get a charge
from the Nighthawks. Their
shows represent a nice change
of pace from the soul and beach
music that students at
Washington and Lee so often
see for live entertainment.

Campus entertainment is im-
proving and scheduling the
Hawks is a further step in the
right direction. The band has
been gaining national
acclaim—their tours now carry
them nationwide and few who
see them are disappointed.

Also, many nationally promi-
nent blues and rock artists have
played with the Nighthawks, in-
cluding Muddy Waters, John
Hammond, George Thorogood

and Gregg Allman.
The band has released five
albums and is said to be

negotiating the release of
another album, on a major
label.

The Hawks are most noted for
the guitar playing of their lead
Jim Thackery and the harp
wailing of Mark Wenner. Music
critics generally agree that
Thackery can blow most better-
known commercial guitarists
off the stage. During January,
in Washington, D.C., the
Hawks’ home base, Thackery
jammed with Thorogood in the

middle of M Street—stopping
traffic for several minutes. The
two bands were playing in bars
on opposite sides of the streets
and apparently the guitarists
couldn’t resist meeting midway
for an impromptu session.

Critics have also acclaimed
Wenner’s harp playing. They
say Wenner can leave most
harp players with their mouths
hanging open—including Magic
Dick of the J. Geils Band.

The Hawks’ music is hard-
driving and loud; however, it is

both tight and professional.

The University Center Com-
mittee has scheduled the
Nighthawks for two Cockpit
shows at 8:30 and 10:30 on
March 14. 200 tickets will be
available for each show at $4
per ticket. The tickets went on
sale today and will be sold until
the 14th during class hours C-G

in the Co-op and at Carole Chap- |

pell’s office in the Cockpit lob-
by. The Nighthawks played two
shows in the Cockpit last year
and both were well received.

ex-reporter runs into trouble in
keeping the appointments he
has inherited. While he is on his
journey, he is accompanied by a
girl he meets, the ‘‘passenger,”’

and is also sought by his wife -

whom he left in London when he
took on the African assignment.
In the end, his new life and his
old catch up with him.

Besides being a film about
identity, The Passenger also
poses other questions, primari-
ly through the use of striking
visual imagery. The ability to
know or be certain is called into
question, to the extent that even
the camera cannot fully know
the truth (for the camera is a
definite character in the film).

' Also, there are existential im-

plications in the search for
meaning the reporter under-
takes. Antonioni explores the
limitations of both man and his
invention, film.

The movie stars Jack
Nicholson, with Maria
Schneider as the passenger.

The Film Society will soon
hold a meeting to select
spring movie(s). Watch for an-
nouncements giving details of
date, time, and place, or call
Professor Kaston at 463-9111,
ext. 367, or Jay Diesing at
463-4532 or 463-2750.

The Film Society’s next
scheduled presentation will be
Franco Brusati’s “Bread and
Chocolate,”’ to be shown Mar.
28-29.

The Folly Of 48

By Bill Whalen

‘Good afternoon and welcome to the 1999 NCAA
basketball tournament! We’re glad you decided to
join us at NBC as we telecast each tournament game
from the original round of 128 all the way to the final
four round to be held sometime in September.”

This may seem a little far-fetched, but it probably
won’t be too different from what will eventually hap-
pen in the NCAA Tournament. With more and more
teams qualifying for postseason bids, the NCAA
tourney cannot help but turn into the same fiasco that
is otherwise called the NBA playoffs.

In the 1980 tournament, the NCAA is showing us
that they are trying to make their tournament more
evenly matched per each round. Unfortunately, the
tournament committee is taking the wrong approach.

The NCAA’s theory is that in order to guarantee
that an uncolossal amount of teams don’t get left out
of the postseason festivities, the field:should be ex-
panded by eight positions. If ever there were a case of
misconstrued logic, this is it.

Before this year, there seemed to enough positions,
seeing as the tournament went for a long time but
didn’t drag along like the NBA postseason does. What
the NCAA should have done (and didn’t) was to keep
the field at the same number but disregard the
automatic bid policy.

This seems to be the NCAA’s problem. First, the
selecting committee is straddled by having to admit
too many weak sisters, such as VCU and Furman,
through the automatic-qualifying policy. And more
importantly, the selecting committee should look a
little harder at seasonal performances before setting
up the regional brackets.

In the Eastern Regional selecting, the committee
must have been drawing names out of hats to deter-
mine who went where. Syracuse, losers in the Big
East final to Georgetown, are ranked first while the
Hoyas, who have won 16 of their last 17 contests, are
seeded third and will more than likely face Maryland
in the round of 16.

Kentucky, loser of two of three encounters with
Louisiana State, got to stay home (in Lexington, no
less) while the Tigers were placed in the Midwest.
Duke, winner of the ACC Tourney, was placed in the
Mideast, while two of its conference opponents got
places in the easier East.

Meanwhile, Depaul, arguably the best team in the
Midwest, was ranked first in the Western Regional.
And who’s got the top seeding in the Midwest? Why
LSU, of course. You try to figure it out.

The only explanation that I can make for all of this
is that, in the rush to get the bids out, the selection
commitee looked at records instead of judging such
relative factors as how hard a team’s conference was,
who its opponents were, and what the team’s recent
record is. In each case, the NCAA has shown a disdain
for these factors.

Nonetheless, the NCAA maysomeday read this and
will probably laugh. And laugh all the way to the
bank, I might add. For despite the mismatches, over-

Cagers Dropped Twice
In Tourney Appearance

By Dale Park

The Washington and Lee Var-
sity Basketball team, the new
O.D.A.C. champs, traveled to
Orange County, New Jersey
last weekend to take part in the
N.C.A.A. Division III Tourna-
ment held at Upsala College.

This marked the fourth time
that Head Coach Verne Can-
field’s hoopsters had gone to the
N.C.A.A.’s and for the fourth
time the Generals were unable
to advance past the first round,
this year losing a close one to
nationally-ranked host, Upsala,
75-70.

Behind by 49-40 at the half,
the Generals roared back to
take a_ two-point lead . with
roughly three minutes to go.

Yet an Upsala surge late in
the game ended W&L’s hope of
continuing in the tournament.
With Upsala’s Steve Keenan
leading the way with 22 points
and eleven rebounds, the
Generals fell behind for good
and were finally laid to rest.

Despite the loss, the Generals
had a well-balanced scoring at-
tack with four players in
double-figures. Sophomore
guard George Spears led all
scorers with 19 points, followed
by junior center Rob Smither-
man who poured in 15 points
and grabbed seven rebounds
and remained the Generals’
mainstay of consistence in the
latter part of the season.

In addition, freshmen for-
ward Brian Hansen, a good
asset for W&L’s future basket-
ball hopes, and junior forward
R. J. Scaggs, the key man on
the Generals’ defense all season

 

George Spears, starting point guard, was named to the all-

around jumper.

long, both netted 12 points
apiece.

Team-captain senior forward
Tom Jeffries, a member of this
year’s first team all-O.D.A.C.
squad, accounted for 10 points.

In the consolation game ver-
sus Alleghany, playing as
though drawn by the long and
emotional season, the Generals
were easily downed 103-80.

Having trouble containing
Alleghany’s Jim Wheeler and

 
       

tournament team in the NCAA Regionals.

     

ent

Rob Smitherman, the Generals’ starting center, goes for a turn-

Eric Lingburg, who scored 24
and 21 points respectively, W&L
fell behind 48-32 at halftime and
never lead during the contest.

Although the Generals’ scor-
ing was balanced, the team shot
only 40 percent from the field.

Jeffries led his team with an
impressive 22 points and 10 re-
bounds, followed by Hansen
with 14 points. Spears and
Smitherman picked up 13 points
apiece, while sophomore guard
Clark New chipped in eight.

For the season, Jeffries led
the Generals in rebounding (7.1
per game), and scoring (15
points per game), followed
closely by Smitherman who
averaged 7.0 rebounds and 11
points per game over the
Season. Spears led the team in
assists with 89 on the season and
averaged 10.4 points per game,

The season is over. Despite
everything, including a 14-15
final record, the Washington
and Lee Generals are the 1980
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Champions.

By Chris Sisto

“I’m very excited about the
enthusiasm from the players
this year; they’re working real-
ly well together and I’m sure
we’re going to have a different
look this year.” This flow of op-
timism came from Head Coach
Chuck Kroll about the 1980
Generals’ baseball team.

Kroll, in his second year as
head coach, is confident that
this year’s team can change the
record set last year when the
Generals didn’t win more than
six games and finished last in
the ODAC. His plan this year is
to have a smaller and younger
squad.

“I decided to make cuts this
year and get the team down toa
more workable 22 man roster,”’
said Kroll. ‘‘Of this, we have on-
ly five seniors, .one junior, and
the rest are sophomores and
freshmen (eight apiece).”’

Kroll feels that this young
talent could be an advantage as
they work toward a winning
season. Said Kroll, ‘“These guys
are quicker and more agressive
than last year. They really want
to win.”

To have a winning season this
year, the Generals must play
more consistently in all facets
of the game. What happened too
often last year was that the
team’s hitting would break
down while the pitching was

good or the Generals would lose
high scoring affairs when the
pitchers couldn’t get the timely
outs.

Kroll is positive that with both
the team’s depth and more sup-
port from the school during
home games, this year’s situa-
tion will be different.

The pitching staff is led by
five returning upperclassmen
and two freshmen. The big gun
for the Generals is Chip Chiles’
who posted a 0.00 earned run
average last year.

Chiles is somewhat of a ques-
tion mark, however, suffering a-
broken leg injury this past sum-
mer and having a steel plate in-
serted in his leg. Other return-
ing pitchers who had consistent
performances last year are
sophomores Mark McLaughlin
and Rick Hachenburg and
senior Vic Shepherd.

In the infield, the Generals
have two returning starters:
Sophomore Jeff Haggerty at
third base and senior John
Stagmaier at second. Rounding
out the rest of the infield will be
freshmen Mark Hough at first
base and Chris Cavalline at
shortstop. The catching chores
will be split up by junior Tom
Coates and sophomore Trip
Brower.

The outfield will be led by

Netmen Look Strong As Usual
With Combo Of Jackson, Norris

By Dale Park

The W&L VaristyTennis team
opens up its 1980 season this
Saturday, March 8, against the
visiting University of
Rochester.

The contest is the first of five
home matches for W&L’s
On Sunday, the
Generals will host Penn State,
with three more matches to be
held the following weekend.

W&L has been 0.D.A.C. ten-
nis champ for the past three
seasons, and has a strong trio of
seniors returning this year.

Co-captain Stewart Jackson,
from Lake Forest, IIl., will lead
the Generals’ attack. Jackson is
a three-time Division III All-
American as well as last year’s
0.D.A.C. Player of the Year.

The other captain, David Con-

stine from Richmond, Va., is
the defending fourth singles
champion in the O.D.A.C. Con-
stine will again play at the
fourth spot this year.

The third senior, Pat Norris
of Dallas,Texas, was one-half of
last years’ second doubles team
that finished second in the
0.D.A.C. Norris’ partner is

Robert Schuler, who as a junior
letterman, returns this year.
Two freshmen, Jackson Shar-
man (Tuscaloosa, Ala.) and
Steve Denny (Bethesda, Md.)
are among the remaining
singles starters for this Satur-
day’s match, playing at second
and sixth singles, respectively.

Fancy Dress Report

 

$10,000 Mink Recovered

by Mark Suber

A Hollins College freshman
returned to the coat room after
the Fancy Dress Ball Friday
night to find that her $10,000 full
length mink coat had been
taken.

Sarah Whitney Lindsey said
she returned to the coat room
with her date, W&L sophomore
Michael Collier, and could not
find her coat. After repeated ef-
forts to locate it, the two decid-
ed to wait until all the coats
were gone and then check
again. When the coat still did
not turn up they realized it had
been taken.

Lexington Police Chief J.A.
Kirby said at approximately
6:30 p.m. on Sunday he received
information from a W&L stu-
dent about who had taken the
coat. The student was able to
recover the coat and turned it
into the police department.

Miss Lindsey was notified of

Although the coat was returned,
Miss Linsey noted that a

pocket of the coat, was still
missing.

Kirby said the case is still
under investigation.

Police Violations Down
From Last Year

by Marc Birenbaum

The recent snow storm may
have helped the Lexington City
Policy as a low 57 complaints
were filed last weekend.

“On some weekends like Fan-
cy Dress, with good weather,
the complaints are over 70,”
said Police Chief J. A. Kirby.
“‘We found most students park-
ed their cars on Saturday night
and walked to their parties.”’

More than sixty percent of the
complaints filed dealt with
violations of parking in a
restricted zone of which
“probably a majority of those
involved are students,” said

Kirby.

One complaint, which Kirby
said did not involve a student,
charged an individual with
operating a snowmobile on
public streets without proper
equipment and a license.

On Friday, one Washington
and Lee student was charged
with possession of marijuana
when police stopped his car at
the intersection of Washington
and Jefferson streets for
allegedly running a light, said
the student.

The student, said Monday he

had some drug paraphanelia
with some resin on it in his car.

Party Rescheduled

I apologize to all those who
made plans to attend the
Freshman class party on Satur-
day, March 1. The cancellation
was made due to severe driving
conditions. However, the party
has been re-scheduled for Sun-
day, April 27, 1980 at the
Pavillion.

All class passes and tickets
purchased will be honored. Fur-
thermore, all those who bought
tickets and will not be able to at-
tend the April party will be
refunded in full.

Minority Affairs Office Busy
With Recruiting Activities

by David Greer

This week is Black Emphasis
Week and this function is keep-
ing one of the assistant deans
very busy.

John White is the coordinator
of minority affairs. Presently,
his office deals chiefly with the
interests of black students on
campus and those who are ap-
plying for admission to W&L.

White says he is trying to ex-
pand recruitment efforts to
other minorities, but most of his
recruiting efforts have been
focused on blacks. He spent
about six weeks this year on
recruiting trips.

While most of the activities
sponsored by White’s office
seem to focus on black students,
they are designed to include all
students.

“The big misconception is
that white students see the
black activities are for black
students only. They are open to
all students,’’ White says.

For example, the SABU Ball
this weekend is open to all
students free of charge. Only
those outside the W&L com-
munity will be charged.

White is the advisor for the
Student Association for Black
Unity. Of the 12 black
undergraduate students, 10 are
members of SABU. There is
another group for black law
students.

The minority affairs office
sponsors many functions during
the year. It is presently spon-
soring a Black Alumni Con-
ference in conjunction with
Black Emphasis Week.

Many of the functions are not
funded entirely by the minority
affairs office but are shared
with other organizations.

For example, poet Vernon
Turner’’s fee was split with the
Glasgow Endowment Fund,
each paying $300.

Stokely Carmichael’s speak-
ing fee was $350, Ossie Davis’
$2,000.

The office is co-sponsoring a
jazz group with the Va.
Historical Society. The group
will perform here later this
semester and admission will be
free to students. The office is
paying $300 so no cover will
have to be charged.

The office is paying $1,200 for
the SABU Ball. It will provide
hors d’oeuvres; the university
will sponsor a cash bar.

There are many misconcep-
tions about special privileges
for minority students on cam-
pus. For example, they are not
given special housing
preference in the dorms, seven
of the 12 are freshmen and
many of the others live in
Woods Creek.

The lounge in Davis dorm has
not been given to SABU either,
despite a popular notion. The
facility is open to all students
who would like to sign it out for
functions.

SABU does have an office in
the student center, which is also
used by the university for other
needs.

Lecture

Rescheduled

The first lecture as part
of Black Emphasis Week at
Washington and Lee has
been rescheduled.

William Syphax’s lecture
on the current status of
minority business develop-
ment will be held at 8 p.m.
Monday in Lee Chapel. He
had been expected to speak
this past Monday but was
unable to get here because
of weather conditions in the
Washington area.

pointed out.

“Instead of being slave labor,
we were converted to cheap
labor; we never perceived the
40 acres and a mule’ that we
were promised,”’ Davis said.

Even though the blacks were
supposedly ‘“‘free’” after the
Civil War they were still op-
pressed by the society that
freed them, Davis said and add-
ed that as long as the black peo-

Hooks will deliver the con-

Friday-evening banquet in-
Washington and Lee’s Evans

Admitted to the Tennessee
bar in 1948, Hooks engaged in
private practice for 16 years in
Memphis—at the same time
serving as an ordained Baptist
minister and as assistant public
defender in the Memphis court
system.

He was named to the FCC in
1972, and was a commissioner
for five years before assuming
his current position with the
NAACP in New York.

the bottom rung of the societal
ladder there was a place for
them.

“It is not bigotry that has held
us down for so long; we could
outrun the bigots—it is the in-
stitution of racism that has been
the barrier to us,”’ he said.

Davis went on to explain that
bigotry is purely related to in-
dividual beliefs, but racism is
an istitution that can affect
large segments of society, and
he cited the industrial shift of
the factories in the Northeast to
the South where there was little
or no unionization and there
was cheap black labor as an ex-
ample.

In his call for the students to
return to their communities to
help the less fortunate ones left
behind, he reminded us that
what works for one group
should, could and would work
for another group and pointed
out that all people are brothers
and should keep in mind as we
try to solve the race problems.

“As you prepared in these
walls to find your niche in socie-
ty, don’t forget those you left
behind, don’t turn your back on
them, for they are your base on
which to build,” Davis again
pointed out to the students.

‘*Responsibility—never
forget responsibility that you
have to your fellow people, and
keep in mind that you are the
exception to the rule, you are
the fortunate one—you are the
one that the people will look to
for advancement,’’ Davis
reminded the students.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Letters

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Monday’s Contest

In case you haven’t heard yet, there’s an election
Monday. It’s called the Big Three Election because it
will fill the three most important positions on our stu-
dent government. The Interfraternity Council is also
holding its elections for the president and vice-
president of that body.

Apathy reigns at W&L. The presidential candidate,
Bob Willis, and the vice-presidential candidate, Willy
Mackie, are running without opposition. We could rail
against the student body for its apathy and the lack of
competition for these two important posts, but that
would be useless—we’ve done it in the past without
success.

There is some choice when selecting the school’s
secretary. Bud White will be on the ballot and Robert
Neely and Dan Weiss are write-in candidates. Un-
fortunately, most of you don’t know the candidates’
views on various issues that will affect you next year.
The candidates gave speeches and stated their posi-
tions in a meeting last night, but only three students
bothered to show up—one of them a Phi reporter.

As usual there is more choice in the fraternity con-
test. Two students are running for the presidency of
the IFC, Rob Brooke (of Phi Kappa Sigma) and Mon-
ty Briscoe (of Pi Kappa Alpha). Three are in conten-
tion for the vice-presidency: Chip Nunley (of Phi Kap-
pa Psi), John Northington (of Kappa Alpha), and Hall
Vetterlein ( of Delta Tau Delta).

Perhaps fraternity members take their own
government more seriously than the students take
theirs. We don’t know, but we do detect a distinct
trend in the lack of competition every year for the
highest offices in the student government.

Frankly the choice is yours. It’s your government
which is supposed to represent your views. It’s also
your job to support our student government even if
you feel they are ineffective. They are your only ma-
jor outlet to express your ideas and concerns.

So if you didn’t run for an elective office, at least
give them a show of support by voting.

At least the candidates will know they weren’t the
only ones who knew there was an election.

Carmichael
Speech

Dear Editor:

Because of the allegations
contained in the exchange of let-
ters between Mr. David F.
Mullin and Mr. John L. White in
recent issues of the Ring-tum
Phi, I have investigated the
matter to determine the actual
amount paid to Stokely Car-
michael for his speech here at
Washington and Lee on January
28.

The total fee paid to Mr. Car-
michael was $345, which includ-
ed an honorarium of $300 and
travel expenses in the amount
of $45. Because the only figure
stated in print up to now has
been the highly inflated sum of
$2,000 given by Mr. Mullin, I
thought it was important for the
University community to be
aware of the actual amount. |
hope that this disclosure will
put the controversy to rest.

ideas and points of view. I fully
endorse and support the respon-
sible efforts of the Student

Association for Black Unity, as

well as all other campus
organizations, in sponsoring a
variety of speakers on campus.

I certainly do not agree with
all positions advocated by the
many speakers who appear at
Washington and Lee each year,
but I defend their right to be
here and to express their opi-
nions in public forums. All of us
can learn from them.

Dear Editor:

David Mullin has achieved
the dubious distinction of
writing a rebuttal that was even
more offensive than his original
comments.

I wish Washington and Lee
had more black students. It is
quite probable that if more
blacks applied to W&L they
would be accepted and persons
of Mr. Mullin’s ilk would be re-
jected. And the moral and
ethical character of the entire
student body would accordingly

‘Endless Paternal Attacks On Our Social Life’

Dear Editor:

I am disappointed with the seemingly endless
paternal attacks on fraternity social life by our
professors and administrators. These attacks are
based upon the belief that the rights and privileges
of students can be manipulated to create activities
which would ‘‘complement, rather than conflict
with, the academic environment” at Washington
and Lee.

Although I can sympathize with the faculty’s
concern about the tendency students have towards
attending fraternity functions instead of studying
or participating in extracurricular events, I see
the faculty’s attempt to control student life as
detrimental to the ‘‘liberal’”’ environment a liberal
arts college is supposed to provide.

One professor claims that mid-week parties ‘‘go
counter to college.”’ I am extremely puzzled by
this attitude. Isn’t there more to college than
academics? Maybe mid-week parties do conflict
with the academic environment. But who ever
said that academics is the sole concern of a col-
lege?

Isn’t it a function of this college, or any college
for that matter, to develop a student’s awareness
of his strengths and weaknesses in order that he
can carry on a responsible life after graduation?
How can this be achieved if a student is not allow-
ed to discover for himself what his capabilities are
and where his limits lie?

By coercing the students against their will, the
university will not only create unnecessary con-
troversy, but create an environment in which a
student is unable to mature. This, in my opinion, is
“counter to college.” :

Contrary to what this professor believes, the
fact that one fraternity’s G.P.A. rose ten places
because it was put on social probation doesn’t
necessarily indicate that the rise was due to the

*

two-three week probation. The top nine frater-
nities do not vary tremendously with regard to
grade point average (2.6-2.8).

I would be curious to know how many of the
other eight were put on social probation? I know of
one fraternity which finished in the top five
without being placed on social pro.

For the sake of argument though, let’s assume
that a fraternity’s G.P.A. can be raised as a result
of social probation or any other ban on partying.
Should every fraternity be told by a surrogate
parent when to have parties and when not to?
Granted, social probation, except when carried to
the absurd (as it sometimes is), is a necessary
deterrent against actions such as hazing and
destruction of property.

But social probation, which in effect is what the
university is attempting to impose, as a punish-
ment for socializing rather than studying? Are we
going to a college or a prep school? As was said in
the Phi last week, the next thing that the faculty
will desire is study halls!

It strikes me as slightly hypocritical that a
university which prides itself on its liberal educa-
tion is punishing its students by the coercive bann-
ing of Wednesday night parties. What kind of
liberal education can be achieved if students are
not allowed to discover for themselves the path to
maturity they should take?

The activities which best complement the
academic life at college are those outside the
“ivory tower’ which develop a person’s capability
to know his potentialities, thus becoming a respon-
sible member of society. This capability will be
impaired if the paternal protection the faculty ex-
hibits over its students continues.

War is the health of the state.

It stimulates the economy and shifts public at-
tention away from the economic destruction
wreaked by government intervention, thereby
saving countless totalitarian laws and political
careers. War also gives government contracts to
favored businesses, thus keeping them artificially
afloat in the marketplace.

All of this sounds dubious enough, if not for the
fact that, at the point of a very large gun, innocent
individual human beings are forced to foot the bill
at the expense of their lives and property. This is
outright crime and ought to be eliminated, not sup-
ported and protected in the name of defending
freedom and ‘‘vital interests.’ Whose freedom?
Whose interests? Obviously not those ofthe
citizens who merely constitute the cannon fodder
in this activity. The purpose of this, then, must be
to protect the interests of those. businesses and
politicians who stand to gain in power,
‘‘prestige:’’ and ill-gotten wealth from these sor-
did affairs.

All of this brings us, of course, to Afghanistan
and the present manufactured American war-
hysteria. The criminal Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan was not an act of world conquest: it
was not an attempt to take over the oilfields. It
was merely a costly resort of desperation, after a
twenty-year sequence of bumbling intervention by
Russia in the unstable and often bloody
politic/religious affairs of Afghanistan—much
like our fiascoes in Viet Nam and Korea.

The Afghan army has been entirely equipped by
the USSR since 1954; the country’s government
has received over a billion dollars in aid, and
Russia has always been Afghanistan’s major
trading partner. In 1978, the small, communist
People’s Democratic Party (PDP) overthrew and
killed President Mohammed Daoud, a royal fami-
ly member and long time Soviet puppet.

The PDP, whose entire base of support con-
sisted of about 5,000 urban intellectuals in a rural
nation of 27 million, quickly staged massive
purges, executions and jailings in order to
establish control. Afghanistan and Russia im-
mediately signed a 20-year Treaty of Friendship
and Cooperation, and several thousand Soviet
economic and military “‘advisors’’ (remember
Vietnam? ) appeared on the scene.

From the outset, the new Afghan government
was plagued with internal opposition between two
major factions, the Masses Party and the Banner
Party. Soon the Masses Party succeeded in
ousting nearly all members of the Banner Party,
which was the most closely tied to the Soviet
Union. Russia intervened, attempting to juggle op-
posing factions, being concerned with the ‘‘stabili-
ty’’ of its interests.

The new coalition government immediately
launched into a series of forced revolutionary
reforms which aroused considerable popular
resistance. The attempt to impose a new social
order from the top down necessitated a police
state which cost the regime much support.
Political repression, Islamic reaction, and fear of
being sold out to the Russians fueled rebellion in
nearly all the provinces. The regime's drafted ar-
L my suffered desertions and mutinies. Soviet ad-

 

: Backstage Afghanistan

visors were attacked and often killed. Russia at-
tempted to oust and replace President Amin, who,
apparently, was too totaliarian for even the
Soviets, but failed in a bloody shoot-out in the
Presidential Palace.

Angered, Amin rejected all Soviet pleas for
friendship, charted an independent, hard-line
Marxist course, and continued to generate popular
hostility. Threatened by a massive Moslem upris-
ing like the one in Iran (generated similarly by the
U.S.), the Russians moved in to save face and
clean up their mess. Within two weeks, there were
50,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, the U.S. hadbeen cultivating similar
client regimes (like the Shah’s) in Turkey, Oman,
Somalia, and Egypt; it has been shipping millions
of dollars of military aid to Pakistan; the U.S.
defence budget is up 5% plus inflation per year;
recent curbs on the CIA are being reconsidered;
and draft registration is about to be imposed. It
seems, hypocritically, that the American govern-
ment is so impressed with the Soviet operations, it
is planning to imitate them.

All ‘of these developments, begun prior to the
Soviet invasion, along with the creation of a Rapid
Deployment Global Strike Force, makes it temp-
ting to suspect that the desperate Soviet interven-
tion in Afghanistan is being used as a pretext to br-
ing the state’s agenda for similar action to public
awareness. What with an economy crumbling
under the ravages of inflation, taxation, and
regulation; many corporate ‘‘friends-of-the-state”’
floundering on the brink of bankruptcy; and in-
creasing numbers of growingly restless, angry
and bitter young Americans who are unable to find
work because of minimum wage and licensing
laws—it is logical that the government would
welcome, indeed cultivate, any opportunity to
stimulate the economy, to bail out its business
friends with massive ‘‘defense’’ contracts, and to
draft the politically dangerous masses of
unemployed young people.

All this, as well as to generate that infamous
political panacea, hearty war fever, nationalism
and collectivized pride and outrage. In other
words, here we go again—

‘Realistically all wars have
been fought for economic

reasons. To make’ them
politically and_ socially
palatable, ideological issues

will always have been invoked.
Any possible future war will,
undoubtedly, conform to
historical precedent.’’—U.S. Of-
fice of Naval  Intelligence-
report to the president, 1938.

When our government begins utilizing such
criminal and totalitarian methods of violating
human rights that would make even Russia proud,
what position are we then in to justify our-
militarism in the name of ‘‘defending freedom?”
The main threat to American freedom and
capitalism if from within our own borders—our
renagade and criminal government.

Persiflage

Foul Play And Mexican Vacations

The Ring-tum Phi regrets
that there is no Persiflage this
week.

Percy claims that he’s too
emotionally disraught to crank
out his usual filler.

It seems that his parents were
killed in an unfortunate plane
accident and there is some
question as to whether there

was any foul play involved.

Percy says he'll resume his
column as soon as the insurance
companies drop their investiga-
tions and pay off the various
hundred thousand dollar
policies that he just happened to
take out before the flight.

Until that time, however, he

can be reached at his newly pur-

Ginsburg Responds

Dear Editor:

In the February 28 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, Gary Goodenow,
C. Sawyer, and Ned McDonnell
felt compelled to ‘‘attack’’ me
on the issue of the removal of
unsigned posters. I would like to
clarify a few issues.

First, Goodenow claims the
degree of my having been of-
fended: ‘‘pales in in-
significance” in comparison to
my act. Announcements located
ina public place are a reflection
of this University community
and all its members. If the
views are not identified, they
may easily be mistaken for the
views of a larger segment of the
community then they, in reali-
ty, represent. These posters did
misrepresent a large number of
students, myself among them.
Had these views been signed, I
would have objected to their
content, but not necessarily
have removed them.

Secondly, I agree with Mr.
Sawyer’s assertion ‘‘posters at-
tached in a non-damaging man-
ner make possible a whole host
of necessary University func-

tions...’’ However, these posters
did not announce a forum to
discuss the issue, nor the forma-
tion of an organization to fur-
ther these views, nor did they
announce any type of Universi-
ty function. The authors of these
posters claimed they intended
to foster discussion of this
pressing issue within the com-
munity. They failed because the
only discussion is the exchange
in which I am currently par-
ticipating.

Thirdly, I would like to crush
the notion that these posters
were ripped down in any
organized group of hostile
students. The action was spon-
taneous.

Finally, I offer no apologies
because I owe no apologies. If
additional anonymous posters
appear in the future, if they
may be misconstrued to repre-
sent a disproportionate percen-

, tage of the community, I will

repeat my actions. Unsigned
posters of this nature are of no
more worth than unsigned graf-
fiti on bathroom walls.

Accolades For The
W&L Basketball Team

Dear Editor:

Although this sports year pro-
bably will be remembered na-
tionally as the year of the U.S.
Olympic hockey team, I will
remember it as the year of the
Washington and Lee basketball
team.

In my 18 years at the Univer-
sity, I have never been so proud
of an athletic team and its ef-
forts as I am of the players,
managers and coaches of this
year’s team.

I doubt seriously that any
other group of collegiate
athletes ever had to deal with so
severe a psychological blow as
that which befell this squad. I
am certain that no group has
ever accepted a challenge and
dealt with it more magnificent-
ly then did this one.

Winning the ODAC title was
frosting on the cake as far as I
am concerned since the team
had already proved to me that it
was comprised of winners.
Prior to the tournament, the
players had shown repeatedly
what they were made of as they

endured threats, taunts, and
poor home game attendance
while still battling every oppos-
ing team down to the last whis-
tle.

Of course, by winning the
tournament, the team was able
to exhibit to all who would take
notice that tremendous results
can be accomplished by dedica-
tion, hard work and excellent
coaching. How great it would be
if all those who graduate from
this institution could take away
the satisfaction of knowing
what inner resources they
poszess to the extent these fine
young men undoubtedly will.

Congratulations to the most
courageous basketball team in
the history of Washington and
Lee.

Proposal For A New Interfraternity

Jim Feinman

In my last column, I outlined the problem in the
present fraternity government with respect to the
IFC constitution. In summary, the present docu-
ment is meaningless because of the lack of any
valid goals, ideals or standards. Recognizing that
the largest problem at WAI. is the lack of a con-
structive and beneficial attitude among a large
number of fraternity members and other students,
I now present the outline for a new constitution.

Keep in mind that this is a general outline and is
not intended as a final draft.

PREAMBLE

We, the students of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, in order to form a fraternity system that is
constructive and beneficial to our society, that
promotes thought and the dispersion of ideas, and
that is conducive to the acquisition of the skills of
written and oral rhetoric, do establish this con-
stitution.

PROGRAMS

To realize the goals set forth in the preamble,
the following programs will be participated in by
all fraternity houses. POINT SYSTEM—This pro-
gram is to establish a competition between frater-
nities to see which house can accumulate the most
number of points in a semester. Points will be
tallied and recorded by a 16-man, one-man-from-
each-house, committee.

Points will be awarded for participation in ex-
tracurricular cultural, civic and athletic ac-
tivities. For example, for each member of a
iraternity that attends a Contact presentation, one
point will be awarded to his respective traternity.
Likewise for the Michael Miley photograph ex-

hibit, dance or drama productions, Republican
Club meetings, etc., etc.

Higher point values will be assignea tor par-
ticipation in activities that require more than a
one-night showing. For example, for each frater-
nity member that participates in the Rugby Club,
his fraternity will receive 10 points. Likewise for
actors in drama productions, officers of the
Republican Club, E.C. committee members, Ring-
tum Phi staff, etc., etc.

15 points will be awarded to a house for every :

member that participates in inter-collegiate
athletics as well as for each member that has a 2.5
average or better per semester. 20 points will be
assigned for members of a fraternity that par-
ticipaté in upper-level student government such as
E.C. members, Ring-tum Phi editor, Ariel editor,
Contact chairman, SAB chairman,etc., etc.

The purpose of this program is not to make peo-
ple involved in areas that they might not care to
participate in. The purpose is to encourage and
support people who participate and achieve in
areas that they are interested in.

The purpose of the tabloid is to promote thought
in the individual houses (which will be facillitated
by the pride involved when your house has its
turn) and to disperse ideas and _ thought
throughout the fraternity system and the com-
munity as well. Obviously, this program will also
be conducive to acquiring and strengthening the
skill of writing.

Substantial prizes will be awarded to the top
three houses in the point competition each
semester. However, to insure that each fraternity
actively participates, a minimum number of
points must be accumulated by each house per
semester. Several methods could be used to deter-
mine the minimum number of points. One way
would be to tabulate the total number of extracur-
ricular activities that occur on our campus. The
minimum point value each house must ac-
cumulate would be equal to the number of points a
house would receive if three members went to
each event. This does not mean that three

members of each house must attend each event.
The minimum point value can be reached by each
house by participating in whatever that house (or
its individual members) care to participate in.
For example, 40 points will be awarded to a house
if 40 members attend a Contact presentation, but
no members of that house will have to attend a
porcelain exhibit if they don’t care to.

Severe penalties will be in order for any house
that does not attain the minimum number of
points each semester. If a house fails to meet the
minimum, it will be required to do so for two suc-
cessive semesters. Failure to do this will result in
social probation for a semester.

A mathematical ratio will have to be assigned to
each house to determine the winners of the point
system for each semester. This is necessary
because each house does not have the same

number of members. an

 

~RT BET aes ease
TABLOID—The fraternity system will sponsor an
interfraternity tabloid consisting of one sheet of
paper folded to make four pages. The responsibili-
ty for editing, layout, printing and circulation will
be delegated to a 16-man, one-man-from-
eachhouse, committee. The responsibility for
writing the articles that will appear in the tabloid
will be rotated to each fraternity house. This
means that once every 32 weeks, your fraternity
will be responsible for writing the tabloid
material.

The format for the tabloid can be established in
any number of ways. One format could be totally
free style; the individual fraternity can write on
anything it chooses. Another format would be to
set a number of general topics and the articles
must address these topics in any manner the
fraternity chooses. For example, if Justice were a
general topic the articles could range from the
legalization of marijuana to the criminal code of
Lexington. If Energy were a general topic, the ar-
ticles could range from, well, the possibilities here
are limitless. If Politics were a topic, the articles
could range from serious support for a candidate
to satires of famous-or infamous-politicians.
INTERFRATERNITY DEBATE CIRCUIT—The
fraternity system will sponsor a debate tourna-
ment every semester. A 16-man, one-man-from-
each house, committee will be responsible for set-
ting the format, arranging the brackets and judg-
ing the competition.

There are several ways to set up the debate
competition. One way would be to require that

each fraternity field a three-man team. The first
round of debate would have no winners or losers.
Beginning the second round, a single-elimination
tournament would commence with substantial
prizes for the top four teams. Debate topics could
be extremely varied but should always be of con-
temporary concern and of general interest to the
student body. Attendance at the debates will be
awarded with one point under the point system.
INTERFRATERNITY COMMUNITY
COMMITTEE—The purpose of this committee
will be to initiate and carry out worthwhile com-
munity projects by the fraternity system as a
whole. Imagination and awareness on the part of
the 16-man, one-man-from-each-house, committee
will be necessary to facilitate this program. This
committee will make the initial plans for the
variety of community projects that are possible
and then delegate the responsibility for carry-out
the projects among all the fraternities.

‘ The diversity and number of community pro-
jects that can be performed by the fraternity
system as a whole is endless. Examples would be
blood drives, paper drives, book drives and
aluminum can drives. Many other projects are
possible. Fraternity members could be sent to the
area high schools to speak on the value of an
education, whether that education be high school
or college. This is an area that has been vastly ig-
nored in the past.

Again, the function of this committee will be to
look at our community to see what can and should
be done by the fraternity system to make a civic
contribution. This program will promote the
fraternities’ image in the community and will help
us all to be more civic-minded.

GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE—The purpose of this
16-man, one-man-from-each house committee will
be to provide a forum for fraternity members who
have a complaint aoout anything in our communi-
ty. The committee will hear complaints and
research the problem if it sees the need. After
researching and discussing the problem, the com-
mittee, if it chooses, will be able to present a state-
ment directed to the appropriate authority in an
effort to alleviate the problem. The statement will
be considered as representative of the fraternity
system as a whole.

This would be an example of how this committee
would work: Joe Student has a complaint so he
calls the committee to make an appointment for
the next committee meeting. Joe goes to the
meeting and addresses the committee. ‘“My com-
plaint is that while this school is named after Gen.
Washington and Gen. Lee, very few people here
know much about the beliefs, values or ideals of
these men—unless they learned it before they got
here. I think this is a shame because these men
were great leaders—renaissance men of their day.
I think an interdepartmental history-philosophy
course would be very interesting and of interest to
a large number of students. Can this committee
look into this?”’

The committee would decide whether or not to
pursue this problem. If they decided to, they would
research it and ascertain if a statement is
necessary. If this was determined, the committee
could present a suggestion (as strongly worded as
they saw fit) to the faculty requesting that such a
course be established.

This committee would give fraternities and
their members a forum for whatever grievance
they might have. It could conceivably make the
fraternity system an interest group of con-
siderable strength.

This is the end of the program section of the pro-
posed constitution, These programs are offered as
guidelines for the large number of possibilities in this

area. The following section will deal with many
diferent areas of concern,

DISCIPLINE

Preface—(The disciplinary bodies presently in
authority are extremely shackled in thead-
ministration of justice throughout the fraternity
system. This is due to the lack of a written code to
guide the judicial board. It is also due to an inter-
pretation that the judicial board can only
discipline fraternities as a whole and not in-
dividual members. I would like to note that I can-
not find the specific phrase in the existing con-
stitution that makes this interpretation possible.

Another. area of concern in relation to the pre-
sent disciplinary problem is the number of deci-
sions that are reviewed by the Student Affairs
Committee and deemed unacceptable. In effect,
this means that the present disciplinary body may
not have performed its function at times. )

The judicial branch of the new constitution will
be able and effective in disciplining fraternities as
a whole and individual members as well. There
will be a written code of conduct that all frater-
nities must adhere to. Also, there will be a written
code of conduct that all fraternity members must
adhere to. A code of conduct for individuals is
necessary because the new judicial board will not
consider fraternity membership a right. Fraterni-
ty membership will be considered a privilege,
therefore all members must conduct themselves
in a civilized and gentlemanly manner—and be
held accountable if they don’t.

The new judicial board will be made up of a 16-
man, one-man-from-each-house, committee. The
IFC president will serve as chairman of the com-
mittee. The function of this board will be to hear
all cases of alledged misconduct by fraternities or
members. Judgments made by this board will be
consistent with and guided by the written codes of
conduct. Penalties administered will rarely in-
volve monetary fines. Penalties will be based on
the assignment of constructive work projects con-
sistent with the severity of the misconduct of each
case.

In the case of disciplining individual members
of fraternities, the board will give the fraternity
involved the opportunity to discipline its own
members. All judgments made by individual
fraternities will be subject to review by the board.
If the judgment is deemed satisfactory by the
judicial board, that body will ensure that the guil-
ty party fulfills the requirements of the penalty .|If
the judgment is deemed unsatisfactory by the
judicial board, that body may overrule and ad-
minister justice in a manner consistent with the
written codes of conduct.

All cases handled by the judicial board will be
subject to review by the SAC. Cases where the
SAC intervenes should, ideally, be non-existent. In
reality, such cases will be extremely rare because
the fraternity system will be able to govern itself
in a manner that is constructive and beneficial to
society in accordance with the written codes of
conduct.

A sub-committee of the judicial board will be set
up to investigate cases of alledged misconduct in-
volving female visitors to our campus. This is
necessary due to the alarming number of women
at the surrounding colleges who will no longer visit
W&L because of incidents in the past where they
were abused, tormented or treated in an otherwise
ungentlemanly manner. The stance of this sub-
committee will be that such conduct is by a
minority of fraternity members and is in no way
condoned by the vast majority. This sub-
committee will give females the opportunity for
redress is they feel they have been mistreated;
publicity to that effect will be dispersed at each
campus. This committee will strengthen W&L’s
image at the surrounding colleges and will result
in an increase of female visitors to our campus.

RUSH
The new constitution will administer rush in the

== same way it is administered now with one excep-

tion. Rush will be held in the winter semester. This

Bis necessary due to the present misplacement of

priorities among the freshmen in the beginning of
the year. Rush in the winter will enable freshmen
to have a better opportunity to get off to a good
start in their academic careers. Rush in the winter
will also enable some upperclassmen to get off toa
better start in the beginning of the school year.

A 16-man, one-man-from-each-house, commit-
tee will be established to create opportunities for
freshmen to meet as many of the upperclassmen
as possible during the fall semester. There are
many ways to do this. One way would be to have
freshmen eat at different houses on a rotating
basis. Another way would be to start a car-pool
program. This program would allow freshmen to
sign up for rides going-down-the-road. Fraternity
members will notify the car-pool program as to
where and when they are going down the road and
how many freshmen they can take. Freshmen will
then be assigned rides on a first-come-first-served
basis.

Another function of this committee will be to
make sure that any activities that could be con-
strued as ‘“‘rushing’’ do not take place until the
winter semester.

HAZING

All forms of hazing that are physically or men-
tally abusive will be outlawed under the new con-
stitution. These forms of hazing will be replaced
by (an equally degrading, equally demeaning,
form of hazing—but one) activities serve a con-
structive and beneficial service to our community.

This new form of “‘hazing”’ will take place under
the auspices of a 16-man, one-man-from-each-
house, committee. The members of this commit-
tee should be of similar character and tempera-
ment as the current pledgemasters.

One of the responsibilities of this committee will
be to administer a ‘“‘What’s Happening”’ program.
This program will work in this manner: Any
organization in or around our community that
desires to have publicity on our campus will phone
or write the committee and give them the what,
where, when, who, etc. that it desires to be
publicized. The committee will then organize the
pledges to begin the creation, printing and circula-
tion of the necessary publicity material. For ex-
ample, if Sen. Warner is going to speak in Lee
Chapel on a given night, the pledges will create,
print, and distribute flyers and posters that con-
tain all the necessary information. In addition,
pledges will make sandwich signs with similar in-
formation and take turns wearing and parading
them along the collonade and in town on the day
the Senator will speak.

This program will single out pledges to do
something that no one else will have to do. It will
make them the subject of some good-natured teas-
ing and at times, it may even embarrass them.
But while the pledges are the subject of such
humiliation, they will be performing a valuable
service to our community and to themselves. The
pledges will have a much better idea of what is go-
ing on around our campus because they will have
to tell the rest of us; and we will have a better idea

The Ring-tum Phi, March 6, 1980, Page 15

of what is happening on campus because some for-
cibly ostentatious pledge will be telling us.

In addition to the ‘“‘What’s: Happening”’ pro-
gram, the upperclass committee will be responsi-
ble for creating and printing several pledge
manuals that all pledges will have to read. To in-

sure that the pledges master the material in these
manuals, tests will be administered and a passing
grade will have to be obtained or the pledge will be
subject to an oral review of the material. If a
pledge does not satisfy the reviewing committee,
he will be assigned extra duty on the ‘‘What’s Hap-
pening” program.

The content of the pledge manuals will be of con-
temporary concern and interest. Examples would
be the Honor Code, the qualities of a gentleman,
and the dangers of venereal diseases. Another
good example would be mental health. This
manual could cover everything from alcohol and
drug abuse to sexual problems to manic-
depression. Again, the possibilities for construc-
tive pledge manuals are limitless.

SOCIAL RESTRICTIONS

Social restrictions in the proposed constitution
will be limited to two requirements. Fraternities
and individual members will have to conduct
themselves in accordance to the written codes of
conduct and applicable Lexington ordinances will
have to be adhered to. Otherwise there will be no
social restrictions or regulations of any kind. The
reasoning behind this is that if this proposed con-
stitution is adopted, the fraternities and their
members will be conducting themselves in a man-
ner that is constructive and beneficial to our socie-
ty. When this occurs there will be no reason to, or
anyone who will be able to, dictate or control the
social habits of the fraternities or their members.

HOUSING RESTRICTIONS

Housing restriction or regulation will be limited
under the proposed constitution. A regular inspec-
tion by a team of students, with faculty and fire
marshall guidance, will be made to insure the
safety of the houses with respect to fire hazards
and other potential dangers. The appearance and
cleanliness of the houses will be left to the discre-
tion of the individual houses and members. The
reasoning behind this is the same as for the social
restrictions.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF HOUSE OFFICERS

Under the proposed constitution, house officers
will have considerably more responsibility than
they have now. House officers will have to adhere
to and support the constitution and will be respon-
sible for encouraging as many individuals as
possible to participate in the various programs. In
addition, officers will work closely with all the
representatives who serve on the constitutional
committees.

House officers will also be responsible for
leading the members of their houses in creating
and maintaining the type of constructive and
beneficial house atmosphere that is consistent
with the ideals and principles of the constitution.

This is the end of the guideline for the proposed
constitution. The many advantages that we would
reap by adopting such a constitution are too
numerous to name in the already generous
amount of space which I have been allotted. The
major disadvantage would be the establishment of
a rather large bureacracy. However, it can be
argued that the world is a huge bureacracy and
that is we create our owr, perhaps we will be
prepared to do a better job in the future than is
presently being done in this area.

What will it take to adopt the proposed constitu-
tion? Primarily, it will take a large effort by a
large number of people. Enough of us will have to
look at what we have now and decide that we can
have something better. Enough of us will have to
decide that it is time to concentrate our efforts and
energy towards things that are constructive and
beneficial to us all. It enough of us decide that we
can, then we will. If enough of us decide that we
can’t, then we won't.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Please feel free to call me if you have any ques-
tions, comments or ideas.

Vote For Amendment

Dear Editor:

An amendment to the Student
Body Constitution is to be voted
on Monday. The amendment
calls for the raising of the
minimum balance for the Stu-
dent Body Reserve Fund from
its present level of $2,500 to
$4,000.

Tenure
Problems
Nationwide

(continued from page 1)

teaching, research and service.

Teachers who have _ been
denied tenure are beginning to
take their grievances to court—
generally with little success.

Last September, two former
assistant professors of English
at the University of Maryland
at College Park lost a suit in
federal court in which they
charged they had been denied
tenure unfairly. -

In another court case, a
federal judge in July, 1977,
overruled a jury award of
$180,000 to a tenured associate
German professor at Goucher
College who had sued the school
for dismissing her.

Although most educators
staunchly defend tenure as a
proven system for developing
and rewarding top-notch
teachers, one school in Mary-
land recently scrapped the idea.
In 1971, St. Mary’s College, a
small liberal arts school, in-
stituted a system of five-year
contracts with review instead of
hiring new faculty members
under the tenure program.

But St. Mary’s is only one of a
few schools in the country that
have shelved tenure and the
College’s President J. Renwick
Jackson concedes that the
number is not likely to grow.

“‘T don’t think that most peo-
ple think they can eliminate
tenure. As a way of bonding
faculty members to an institu-
tion, it’s a fine system,”
Jackson said.

The Reserve Fund provides
the necessary financial security
for Student Body organizations.
If a group receiving Student
Body Funds ends its yearly
operations with a deficit, the
Reserve Fund is emploved to
eradicate this problem. This
has occurred in the past, and as
a result of spiralling inflation,
$2,500 is no longer a safe or
viable Reserve Fund.

The proposal to raise the
Reserve Fund would not cause
an increase in the Student Ac-
tivities Fee, by itself, nor would
it result in any organization
receiving less funding.

In order for this amendment

’ to pass half of the Student Body

must cast ballots with twe-
thirds of those favoring adop-
tion of the amendment.

The Executive Committee
unanimously supports this pro-
posed amendment and urges
the entire Student Body to vote
yes for the amendment on Mon-
day.

cGevern Speaks Out

Washington and Lee University

 

On Current Issues

By Marc Birenbaum
Speaking Thursday night as
the Contact symposium’s lec-
turer, Sen. George S. McGovern
related recent U.S. foreign
policy developments to the
following:

The Future of SALT — ‘‘We
should not fall into the trap of
thinking that the SALT treaty is
a reward for good behavior on
the part of the Soviet Union or
that withdrawing of it is
something of a punishment to
the Soviet Union. We should
have no interest in the SALT
treaty at all unless it is in dur in-
terest.”

On this year’s presidential
race — ‘‘Once again, two rather
small and minor countries,
judged by any standard of
military or economic power,
have come to dominate the
presidential debates.”

On Iran and Afghanistan — ‘‘I
would argue that there is very
little relevance between the
combat readiness of the
American army, the American
navy, the American air force
and in what took place either. in
Iran or Afghanistan. I would
also argue that it would be a
mistake to assume here tonight
that the Soviet troops in
Afghanistan are heading for the
oil in the Persian Gulf.”

Concerning America’s
military strength — ‘‘Does that
mean that because. they have
50,000, 60,000, or even 100,000

Soviet troops in Afghanistan
that the Soviet Union is stronger
tonight and that the United
States is weaker than we were
six months ago? I don’t believe
that. It may just be the opposite
They have stumbled into a can
of worms that has actually
weakened the Soviet Union.”
The South Dakota senator said
he has heard intelligence
reports the Soviets are receiv-
ing up to 250 casualties a day.

NUMBER 22

EC To Give Monthly Reports

Discusses Nationwide Grade Inflation

by John Billmyre

After deadlocking 6-6 on a mo-
tion that would have required it
to make a fourth report each
year summarizing its financial
transactions, the Executive
Committee passed another mo-
tion that requires it to report
monthly.

The first proposal came dur-
ing Monday’s meeting and was
brought up by Business
Manager John Hamilton and
Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Kevin McGowan.

Their proposal said the EC
should report four times a year,
in September, January, April
and May.

But EC President Steve
Abraham said the EC is already
required to make three of the
recommended reports, with the
April report being the only addi-
tion.

Abraham added that the EC
was supposed to make a finan-
cial report in January, but
neglected to do so. He said the
January report will be made at
the next EC meeting, Monday
night.

The EC President questioned
the intent behind the motion,
but said, “It would be a good
thing for the student body to
know what the EC is costing
them.”

EC Secretary Cove Geary
supported Abraham, but Senior
Law Representative John
Fraser asked Hamilton and
McGowan how the motion

would help them, since they
proposed it.

They replied that knowing the
EC’s printing costs would help
them gage their printing costs.

After the first motion stalled
and died, the second motion, for
monthly reports, was proposed.

Fraser supported the second
motion, ‘‘so people can check on
what we are doing.”’

He said the concept for mon-
thly reports is the same as open
meetings. ‘‘Once we get in the
habit of making monthly
reports, it will be easy,” said
Fraser.

Abraham also brought up
what he called a ‘‘nation-wide
problem of grade inflation.”

The average grade point
average at W&L is 2.65, but the
national average is between 3.0
and 3.2 said Abraham.

After discussing the situation,
the EC made a recommenda-
tion that students be given the
option of including their class
rank with transcripts.

To make the option obvious to
all students, the EC recom-
mended the registrar put a box
on all transcripts, which can be
filled in if students want their
class rank included with grades
and transcripts.

The recommendation was
unanimous.

The EC also chose three new
members for the Student
Emergency Loan Committee.

David Cook, Frank Eppes and
Eric Kolts were selected to sit

on the SELC, to replace the two
Student Control Represen-
tatives and fill the slot for one
student member from the stu-
dent body.

The EC heard reports from
subcommittees during the re-
mainder of Monday’s meeting.

Contact reported it has about
$4,500 left for this year.

Co-Chairman Channing Hall
said Contact plans to have Tom
Wolfe, a W&L alumnus and
author of several books, speak
on the Thursday of Mock Con-
vention.

Hall also said Contact might
sponsor one more speaker, who
has not yet been selected.

Senior EC Representative
Jay Blumberg asked Hall why it
cost $61 for Senator George
McGovern’s dinner.

Hall said three Contact
members and Dr. Barry
Machado took McGovern out to
dinner and added McGovern
ordered drinks.

The EC also wanted to know
why Machado went along for
the dinner.

Hall explained that faculty
members do not always go out
to dinner with the speaker, but
Machado is an “expert” in
American diplomacy.

The Mock Convention made
its monthly report and
answered questions from the
EC about funds and Jim Hicks’
status with the Steering Com-
mittee.

Big Three, IFC Elections Decided

Bob Willis will be the next
Student Body President and
Willy Mackie will be the next
Vice President.

Neither victory in elections
Monday came as a surprise
since both candidates ran unop-
posed.

Bud White won the Secretary
position over write-in can-
didates Robert Neely and Dan
Weiss. White received 397 votes
to Neely’s 163 and Weiss’s 109.

In the Interfraternity Council
elections, Pi Kappa Alpha
Monte Briscoe defeated Phi
Kappa Sigma Rob Brooke,
304-225.

Phi Kappa Psi Chip Nunley
won the Vice President spot,
defeating Kappa Alpha John
Northington and Delta Tau
Delta Hall Vetterlein.

The elections went smoothly,
but the Executive Committee

 

 

 

 

Bob Willis

 

 

discussed what did and did not
constitute a valid ballot.

After discussing the issue, the
EC passed a motion that only
ballots indicating a perference
for a student be counted as a
valid ballot.

The EC amendment that the
student body reserve fund be
raised to $4,000 from $2,500, was
defeated.

 

Petitions for rising
sophomore, junior and senior
EC representative are due Mon-
day. There will also be a rule-

    

Willy Mackie
setting session at that meeting
which all candidates must at-
tend.

Candidates who want to run
for EC positions should attend
the meeting and bring a

   

petititon with 50 signatures.

The election will be held on
March 24.

Petitions for Law School
Representatives are due March
24, when there will be a rule-
setting meeting.

Elections for the law school
will be held the following Mon-
day.

The Selling Of The Party 1980

by Marc Birenbaum

Believe or not, there was a
time when political commer-
cials were simple, cut and dry
advertisements — a speech to a
special interest group, an at-
tack on a supposed weakness of
an opponent or an ad depicting
your favorite candidate as the
All-American all supporters
truly knew him or her to be.

Then came the advent of the
presidential contender’s media
blitz, described so well in books
like The Selling of The Presi-
dent, 1968, The People Machine,
The Image Candidates and The
Political Persuaders.

Even this year’s campaign
showed brief glimpses of a good
candidate commercial. Sen.
Howard Baker produced one of

Student Offers
‘Alibi Service’

An enterprising college stu-
dent at the University of
Arizona has come up with a
unique way to make a living: an
“Alibi Service’ for those
female college students who
don’t want their parents to
know they have moved in with
their boyfriends.

Lisa, a 22-year-old student,
makes her service available for
$20 a month. For that sum, she
will take unexpected telephone
calls from unsuspecting
parents, receive mail and
deliver messages to her clients.
She will also play the part of
roommate in case the parents
pay an unexpected visit.

Defense Plans
For Laser Gun

The 2ist century may already
be upon us, in term of futuristic
warfare.

The Defense Department is
planning to issue a contract
next month for construction of
its High Energy Laser System
Test Facility at White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico.
The Pentagon has already spent
$2 billion in developing and
testing the application of laser
light for attacking tanks, air-
craft, missiles, and orbiting
satellites, the New York Times
reported this week.

A powerful beam of laser
light could destroy a target

partly by the heat it generates
and partly by the shock wave
the sudden heat would cause in
the target. A laser beam
demonstrated in 1978 by a
California technology company

 

the most effective and con-
troversial commercials, when
he responded to an Iranian’s
question while stumping in
Iowa. When George Bush was
interviewed on ‘‘Sixty
Minutes,” his campaign was
caught in an embarassing situa-
tion when the CBS crew filmed
Bush’s people re-enacting a
welcoming party at a New
England airport.

Now the Republican party
itself is sinking $5 million in an
ad campaign with the general
theme: ‘Vote Republican. For
a change.’’ — a theme reminis-
cient of the 1946 campaign in
which the GOP captured both
chambers of Congress.

What makes this campaign so
unique is that it seeks to provide

Briefs —

successful shot down a missile.

One drawback to the new
weapon might be the cost. One
estimate has placed the cost of
shooting down an _ incoming
ballistic missile with a single
pulse of energy at $1.5 million.
But the Pentagon is still moving
ahead with the project and is
considering placing the new
weapon in outer space, where
intercontinental missiles would
be easier to destroy.

More DOE
Waste Projects

Here are some more ex-
amples of how the Department
of Energy dispenses with the
$56 million available for energy
research grants, according to
an internal DOE memo on the
subject.

One million dollars went to a
Northwest Mississippi Junior
College for a ‘‘Total Solar Con-
version System.’’ That scien-
tific sounding project was real-
ly a wood-burning heating plant
for the college, but was not in-
vestigated before the grant was
given.

DOE investigators said the
system “‘is not intended to ad-
vance the state of the art’’ and
also found that no one at DOE
was overseeing how the money
was being spent.

The University of Missouri
was given $830,000 to study ex-

tracting gasses from wood. |

DOE asked eight scientists to
evaluate the project, but six of
the eight were recommended by
the university. You won’t be
surprised to learn that the
scientific panel approved the
gas from wood project.

Why doesn’t W&L get in on
some of the DOE gravy train?

an idealogical theme for the
Republican party as a whole,
and is very similar to the
British Conservative party’s
media campaign of last spring.

Perhaps you’ve seen one of
the Republican ads. In early
February, the first, entitled
‘‘Land of Hope,’ aired national-
ly on ABC. The five-minute
message was about present
problems facing the nation:
Laws that restrict productivity,
inflation, and overtaxation
caused by government spen-
ding. ‘‘What went wrong, what
went wrong...in the Congress of
the United States,’’ says the ad.
“But tomorrow can be dif-
ferent...We have the resources
to restore prosperity.”

Throughout February, five
other messages, varying in
time from 30 seconds to five
minutes, appeared nationally.

“Earlier, our test marketing
of the messages produced
favorable responses from the
previewers,’’ said Republican
National Committee chairman
Bill Brock. ‘‘We believe the
television messages will help
promote the growing feeling
among Americans that the
Republican party can do a bet-
ter job than the Democrats in

restoring stability to America
— in both domestic and interna-
tional areas.”

These commercials are only a
part of the first phase of a three-
part plan, which will culminate
in June.

Business Team Honored

In National Competition

A team of students from
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics finished
with first runnerup honors at
the 1980 Intercollegiate
Business Games in Atlanta. The
W&L team placed second in a
field of 21 competing groups
from across the nation.

Washington and Lee
members of the team, all
seniors, included Robert Mar-
shall Merriman, Jr. of Spencer,
Va.; Raymond Charles Nugent
of Virginia Beach; Mark
Grahame Walker of Bethesda,
Md.; and David Walter West of
Washington, D.C. Faculty ad-

‘visor for the W&L team was Dr.

Joseph Goldsten, associate pro-
fessor of business administra-
tion.

The games began in early
January and tested the business
skills and managerial expertise

of the participating students to
manage a hypothetical firm in

financial arrears, and _ the
team’s task was to restore it to
profitability.

Each team teletyped a series
of decisions to the central com-
puter at Emory University,
which analyzed the merits of
each choice against a simulated
business environment and rank-
ed each team according to per-
formance.

The schools were categorized
in four divisions, and a winner
was chosen for each.

Wake Forest and Washington
and Lee both won their respec-
tive divisions, while Loyola of
Baltimore, Md., and Simon
Fraser University of Burnaby,
British Columbia, were other
division winners. It was from
these four schools that Wake
Forest emerged as the competi-
tion’s best.

More Praise For ‘Kramer’

by Paul Hendry

Perhaps the most critically and publicly ac-
claimed film of the year has arrived at Lex-
ington’s “State”: KRAMER VS. KRAMER. Part
of the popularity no doubt comes from the film’s
subject matter, American marital dilemmas that
have come to the forefront in recent years:
separation, divorce and child custody.

One of the film’s attributes is that it succeeds in
provoking a broad range of responses from its
compelling portrayal of the trials of a family being
wrenched apart without straining to make
strenuous moral and social comments. The story
itself is tightly constructed and focuses on the
ordeal of divorce for the parents and child. Any
impact or message imparted is derived from the
story itself and the strong performances by the ac-
tors — not through didactic rhetoric.

The acting moves beyond the competent and
solid efforts found in the minor roles to the truly
outstanding work exhibited in the four major
characters. Dustin Hoffman is the Madison Ave.
huckster around whom the story revolves. It is the
shock of separation from his estranged wife that
alerts him to a new awareness of fatherhood. The
film’s plot is centered around the touching growth
of his relationship with his son. He proves both a
warm father and a fiery competitor in his fight for
his son.

Mery] Streep, the latest and greatest, according
to popular media critics, lives up to her reputation
as the hurt and confused mother. By design, her
character is not a likeable one, and she never
presents an honest claim to her child in the
viewer’s mind for this reason. What is the au-
dience meant to think of her character and claim
to the child after she deserts her home to go to
California to ‘‘find’’ herself and become ‘‘a com-
plete human being?”’

The movie is definitely a father-son story, and
Justin Henry steals the show as the son with one of
the most affecting performances by a child in re-

Record Review

cent memory (since Tatum O’Neal in PAPER
MOON? Justin plays a totally believable, real,
seven year old — which I’m sure he is — and it is to
the director’s credit that he coaxes so engaging a
performance from him.

Jane Alexander’s role of friendly divorced
neighbor and companion of Hoffman is equally
well done. This relationship adds depth to Hoff-
man’s character and serves as a fine complement
to his own marital situation. Alexander’s
character, like the viewer, becomes a witness to
Hoffman’s and his son’s growth and adjustment
and accentuates the transitional period which is
the film’s emphasis.

The movie is shot against the cold and bleak
New York landscape that appropriately appears
to be perpetually in winter to lend a grey mood to
the happenings. Short scenes of great emotional
impact are shot in near silence and then fade-out
to black before the plot continues. These brief
glimpses bring the audience even closer to the
characters’ lives — as if the camera were in-
truding into their homes to give a special look or
insight. These scenes likewise sustain mood.

Tears are sure to be shed by many viewers, yet
KRAMER VS. KRAMER — like Hoffman’s
character — does not wallow in emotion. The light
touches of comedy found in everyday life are pre-
sent throughout and are a source of great enter-
tainment.

The first breakfast scene, the child’s encounter
with his father’s overnight ‘‘friend,’’ and the son’s

‘mutiny by eating ice cream instead of dinner

stand out in my mind because of their ability to in-
voke such a broad range of sympathies and
laughter.

The subject matter of KRAMER VS. KRAMER
may not sound thrilling, but the performances and
plot acutely reveal so much about human nature
and popular institutions that the chance to enjoy it
at least once should be a virtually iresistable pro-
spect for all.

 

Blotto; The Mingus Dynasty

By Mark Kinniburgh

We devote space this week to
a rock and a jazz favorite, with
help in the jazz department
from Spencer Leffel.

My rock favorite for the week
is a band from Albany, New
York named ‘‘Blotto.”” The
force behind ‘‘Blotto’’ is not the
music, although it is ample, but
rather the lyrics. A selection of
4 songs was just released on
Blotto records, their record
company, and even though the
Blotto singles won’t be found on
a record shelf at a store, you’ll
be hearing a lot from Blotto on
the radio.

I first became acquainted
with Blotto through a postcard
which simply said ‘‘Blotto is
coming.’ No earlier than two
months later, I receiwed an
envelope with nothing but a but-
ton that said, ‘“‘Hello my name
is Blotto, what’s yours?”’ Very
much intrigued by this time, I
sent a letter to the return ad-
dress on the postcard asking
what was going on, and I receiv-
ed a notice that a record was on

the way. Blotto seems to have a
very imaginative marketing
staff, which in turn promotes
their imaginitive musical ef-
forts.

Blotto itself is a new brand
made up of refugees from other
successful and_ not-so-
successful rock bands in the
upstate New York area, the
most notable of which was the
Washboard Band. Members of
Blotto have appeared in one
form or another on the Mike
Douglas show, stages at
Washington’s Cellar Door and
Austin’s Admadillo World
Headquarters, among many
others.

The strategy for Blotto in past
months has been to sharpen up
a live show for a national tour,
but without a record company’s
financial support, the tour will
be a difficult endeavor. Along
with radio support and record
sales there is a definite possi-
bility of Blotto’s continued ex-
istence in the music world.
WLUR will be airing the Blotto
singles and we’ll gladly accept

requests. Our favorite at WLUR
is ‘‘I Wanna Be a Lifeguard,” so
give it a listen!

This week’s jazz favorite is
“Chair In The Sky” by the
Mingus Dynasty, a group com-
posed almost entirely of alumni
from past bands of Charles
Mingus. Organized by Susan
Grahom Mingus, the wife of the
late bassist and composer, the
group’s personnel is not always
the same, but it is always
strong.

On this date John Handy
plays alto sax while Jimmy
Knepper handles trombone.
This pair worked with Mingus
during the classic Jazz
Workshop years of the late
1950's and early ’60’s. From
more recent Mingus groups
come two fine, under-rated
musicians, pianist Don Pullen
and trumpeter Jimmy Owens.
Dannie Richmond, the only
drummer Mingus had during
the last 20 years of his life, pro-
vides his usual tasteful yet ex-

Film Notes

The African Queen (1951) Humphrey Bogart won the Academy
Award for his performance as gin-swilling Charlie Alnutt, who
rescues missionary Katharine Hepburn from the Germans during
World War I. Their adventure to safety on an African riverboat is
‘comedy of the highest order. John Huston — who had previously
collaborated with Bogart on The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure
of the Sierra Madre — directed and, with James Agee, wrote the
script. Hepburn’s performance is considered to be one of he ‘inest.
Filmed on location in the Belgian Congo. With Robert Morley.
Presented by the SAB March 14 — 16 at 7 and 9 p.m. in Dupont
Auditorium. Admission is $1.

claimed film by the Italian director Lina Wertmuller. To be shown

Outdoor Track
Opens At Home

Head coach Norris Aldridge
and 14 lettermen will lead the
1980 Washington & Lee track
team into its season opening
meet, which takes place Satur-
day, March 15 against David-
son.

Aldridge, beginning his 11th
year as head coach, reports that
W&L regularly fields a strong
track outfit, ‘mainly due to
depth in all areas. We can enter
two or three men in each event
and count on good per-
formances.”’

1980 appears as no exception
to this, with lettermen and a
host of newcomers blending to
give W&L strength across the
board.

In the distance events, three-
year letterman Richard Bird
and two-year letterman Chris
Daniel are the leaders. Bird is a
senior who holds school records
in the 800 and 1500 meter runs;
Daniel is a junior. Additional
distance men include senior
Ham Davis in the 880 and junior
Howard Herndon, sophomore
Greg Branan and freshman
John Kelafant in the three-mile
event.

In the springs, five lettermen
and two newcomers give W&L a
strong contingent. Senior and
co-captain Stewart Atkinson, a

three-year letterman, and
junior Jeff Brown, a two-year
letterman, compete in the 100,
200, and 440-yard = runs.
Freshman Pat McGuire joins
them in the 100 and 220. Junior
and two-year letterman Billy
Morris, sophomore and letter-
man Dave Cordell, junior and
letterman R. J. Scaggs and
senior Jimmy Parker all run
the 440.

In the weight department,
sophomore lettermen Buz Man-
ning, Bob Shaver and junior let-

Lacrosse Season Opener
Sat. Against Orangemen

by Dave Johnson

The W&L varsity lacrosse
team was defeated, 9-7, in an
exhibition game against a tough
Mt. Washington club team.

But despite the loss, Coach
Jack Emmer believes that his
team accomplished its objec-
tives in the tune-up match: ob-
taning valuable playing ex-
perience and executing well.

The came was very close, as
the Generals had tied it up in
the fourth quarter, but W&lI’s
difficulties in capitalizing on
scoring opportunities allowed
Mt. Washington to take the
game.

Both midfielder John Kemp
and freshman attackman Geoff
Wood scored two goals for the
Generals, but attackman Rob
Staugaitis came up with a goal
and five assists to earn himself
the ‘Cannon Award’’ for the
game. Emmer also praised the
play of defenseman Jim
Herbert and goalie Bob
Clements. Clements made 19
saves overall.

Emmer was also pleased with
his team's effort, citing their
hustle and determination as im-
portant strong points. He did
note, however, that his squad
did not Shoot as well as we
would have liked and that the
Generals must put more than
seven points on the board to win
games.

But considering the quality of
the Mt. Washington squad, an
opponent W&L_ has_ never
beaten, the Generals’ showing
was at least admirable.

Looking forward to the rest of
the season, the Generals will be

relying on the experience of
eighteen returning players who
have started at some time, in-
cluding midfielders George
Santos, John Hooper, Geoff
Brent and Kemp. On defense,
Clements and Herbert are the
key players to watch. Com-
plimenting these veterans will
be a strong corps of freshmen,
includind John Doub, John Tun-
ney and Joe Siefert at midfield
and Wood at attack.

Avoiding any predictions,or
even any showing of en-
thusiasm, Emmer looks for a
solid team which will be ‘‘very
competitive against a very
demanding schedule,’’ which is
a coach’s way of saying that
you'll have to wait and see.

The Generals begin the

regular season with their home
opener against the Syracuse
Orangemen this Saturday. Last
year’s Syracuse team ended the
season ranked sixth nationally
and defeated the 1979 Generals,
10-7.

Syracuse will be coming off a
victory against N.C. State and
Emmer expects ‘‘one hell of a
lacrosse game.” The Generals
look ready to take on the
Orangemen, who have been
ranked as high as sixth in
preseason polls.

This years looks to be another
in a long line of excellent
seasons for the W&L lacrosse
team and it is surely something
any sports fan would not want to
miss. Gametime on Wilson
Field this vee is 2:00 p.m.

 

Steve Johnson (29), Bob Clements (14) and Jim Herbert will read
the Generals on defense.

 

1980 Should Start New Lacrosse Decade

by Bill Whalen

1980 is the first year of a new
decade. And here at W&L, 1980
may also be the first year of a
new decade of lacrosse.

If one takes a close look at the
1980 lacrosse squad, much of
the future of this school’s
lacrosse program can be found.

Gone are the days when-a
W&L would enter the season
ranked in the nation’s top five.
Instead, in 1980, the W&L team
will not be found among the top
squads in consideration for the
national title.

On the contrary, this team
will have to pull a few upsets to
get both a good position in the
polls and consideration for the
postseason playoffs.

The reason is obvious. In a
time when money is being spent
generously to update and
popularize the sport of college
lacrosse, W&L has not been one
of the leading spenders.

Because of the school’s
‘laissez-faire’ attitude to
athletics in general and the idea
that the team does not have to
give scholarships to remain
among the nation’s elite, the

lacrosse program has_ been
equalled and/or surpassed in
several other universities.

But even though the program
has slipped, W&L still remains
as one of the most prestigious
teams in the country. If
anything, the Generals look like
the common man’s hero. When
the W&L lacrosse team takes
the field, it almost seems to be a
challenge between the big time
athletics and the wav college
sports used to be.

But being realistic, the little
man is almost always the first
to suffer in any type of squeeze
— hence the slip in the national
ratings. But don’t give up yet —
there still may be a turn-around
in the 1980’s — and this year in
particular.

If the Generals are entertain-
ing any thoughts of postseason
play, they will have to obtain a
good record. And considering
the 1980 schedule, the Generals
only have to play well at home
to earn a playoff berth.

W&L is scheduled to play 13
regular season games this year.
Of the thirteen games, eight are
at home and five are away. But

more importantly, almost each
team that the Generals will
compete against for a playoff
spot will be faced in Lexington.

Last year, Syracuse and N.C.
State occupied the seventh and
eighth spots, respectively in the
lacrosse tournament. Both
teams will take on the Generals
here in Lexington. And if the
Generals want a bid, they will
have to score convincing wins
over both of these teams.

From the
Pressbox

Of the five away opponents,
only Virginia is likely to make a
playoff appearance. Other op-
ponents such as Duke and
Hofstra don’t appear strong
enough to make a run.

But another interesting note
can be made about this year’s
schedule. If you look closely,
you will find Virginia Tech,
Baltimore University and Air
Force, all of which were not on
last year’s schedule.

 

 

None of these teams are con-
sidered among the nation’s
elite, although each is good
within its own rights. Each is in
a different class from the
Hopkins and Maryland teams,
however.

The Generals play them
because the good teams do not
want to play W&L anymore.
They figure that since the
Generals are not among the
highest rated, there is more to
risk than to gain from an en-
counter. The only way Johns
Hopkins could benefit from
playing W&L would be scoring a
total wipe-out. A close win or a
loss would only hurt its ranking.

So what is Jack Emmer to do
in this situation? Nothing, ex-
cept what he is doing right now
— which is trying to play the
best competition available and
hope for a good season. A good

season would guarantee some
attention and better recruits.
Which brings us back to our
original discussion of the im-
portance of the 1980 season. For
the program to keep up its suc-

cess, a good showing this season

is crucial.

With the rising cost of college
and the increasing amount of
scholarships at other schools, it
is imperative for this year’s
team to come out well. Such
strong finishes linger strongly
in the minds of impressionable
recruits.

So to this year’s team, I wish
plenty of luck. The schedule
seems to be in your favor and
everyone is rooting for you, so
good luck in your quest for the
playoffs.

Let’s make the 1980’s another
decade of successful lacrosse at
W&L.

Netmen Win Debut, 5-4

by Dale Park
Last Saturday, the
Washington & Lee Varsity
netmen faced a surprisingly
tough University of Rochester
tennis team. Unlike’ the
General’s easy 7-2 victory last
year, W&L squeezed to a 5-4 vic-

tory this time around.

“Eric Friedman, who played
first singles last year for
Rochester, was playing third
singles this year,”’ said head
tennis coach Gary Franke,
evidencing the new depth the
Yellowjackets have this year.

At first singles, W&L senior
co-captain Stewart Jackson fac-
ed young freshman Bob Swar-
tout. Swartout’s quickness
enabled him to take Jackson to

6-6 in the first set, yet the ex-
perienced senior prevailed 5-3
in the tie-breaker for a 7-6 win.
After the tie-breaker, it was
all Jackson as his powerful
serve and quick net play enabl-
ed him to breeze to a 6-2 victory
in the second set. W&L lost the

next two singles positions,
however.

Jackson Sharman, W&L’s
freshman second singles

player, fell to the other new
Rochester addition, freshman
Mike Mahoney, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. In
the meantime, W&L junior
Peter Lovell battled Friedman

at third singles.

Lovell lost the first set, 7-6, in
a close 5-2 tie-breaker, came
back to take the next set 7-5, but
succumbed in the third set, 6-3.
Yet the Generals rebounded by
taking the next two singles
flights.

Senior co-captain David Con-
stine, in a tough fourth singles

 

Dave Constine

match versus Yellowjacket
Alex Gaeta, prevailed 6-2, 2-6,
6-4, while W&L teammate Steve
Denny, a freshman at fifth
singles, downed Rochester’s
John Conlin by the nearly iden-
tical score of 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.

But the Yellowjackets forced
a 3-3 split in the six singles mat-
ches as Generals’ freshman

Mike Read, playing at sixth
singles, failed to get on track
versus Scott Semisch and fell
6-3, 6-4.

The outcome of the match
depended sntirely on the three
doubles matches.

The first doubles match
belonged to W&L as Jackson
teamed with senior Pat Norris
to defeat Rochester’s Swartout
and Mahoney 6-3, 7-6, (a 5-3 tie-
breaker). But in the third
singles it was all Rochester, as
Gaeta and Semisch swept past
Sharman and Denny of W&L
6-4, 6-3.

This left one match, the se-
cond doubles, in which W&L’s
Lovell and his teammate, junior
faced Yellow-
jackets Friedman and Conlin:
Although they lost the first set
6-2, Lovell and Gaker thundered
back to overwhelm their op-
ponents, 6-2, 6-1, and gave the
Generals an important opening

Doug Gaker,

match victory.

In all, five of the nine matches
played went to three sets.

‘“‘We didn’t anticipate
Rochester being as tough as
they were,’’ said Franke. ‘“‘We
let Gaker rest and just play
doubles, but it’s hard to tell how
much that effected the out-
come.”’

Joe Farrell, who has played

Charlie Haden fills the Mingus’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

“Told You So...”

Consider this fair warning. The Student Activities
Board is now making plans for Spring Weekend (May
2).

Will the Four Tops be the SAB’s spring band? Could
the sellout by Monday of 200 tickets for tommorow
night’s Nighthawks late show be an indication of the
student body’s preference in music? We don’t know
yet, but you can get in on the ground floor. Discussion
of the spring concert will resume this Sunday at 7:30
p.m. in the SAB’s second floor office in the University
Center building.

From The Editor’s Desk

Americans across the country should be outraged by the latest
example of broken promises and political cover-up to come out of
the Carter Administration’s Justice Department.

Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti told the Senate Banking
and Judiciary Committees Tuesday that a two-year Justice Depart-
ment investigation of questionable Textron and Bell Helicopter
payments ‘‘has not revealed evidence that Mr. Miller was informed
by anyone of improper payments.”’ Mr. Civiletti said that because
of this report and a technicality in the Ethics in Government Act, no
special prosecutor would be appointed to investigate the Security
and Exchange Commission’s charges against Treasury Secretary
G. William Miller.

‘None of the assertions that Secretary Miller has committed a
criminal violation have been substantiated by the investigation
conducted since early 1978,’’ the attorney general continued.

Yet the evidence against Mr. Miller was so strong that both
Democrats and Republicans called for the appointment of a special
prosecutor to investigate the charges. Among the SEC’s charges:
—That Textron Inc. wined and dined Pentagon officials out of a
$600,000 slush fund from 1971 to 1978 (a federal offense) and then
doctored the company’s books and records to conceal the entertain-
ment expenses ;

—That while Mr. Miller was chairman and chief executive of Tex-
tron, the company made 13 payments totaling $5.4 million to of-
ficials in 10 foreign countries over an eight-year period to convince
them to buy Bell Helicopters;

—That Mr. Miller had made “erroneous and misleading”’
statements to stockholders at Textron’s annual meetings in 1976
and 1977, when he assured them that the company had not made im-
proper payments to foreign officials;

—And that Mr. Miller and other top Textron officers ‘‘made false
and misleading representations”’ to the Senate Banking Committee
in 1978, during the Treasury Secretary’s confirmation hearings by
falsifying company records and doctoring or destroying documents
to hide the improper payments.

The SEC does not make such charges lightly. (It is important to
note that 11 top officers of Textron Inc. took the Fifth Amendment
when questioned about the payments. )

Mr. Miller has maintained his innocence in the payments matter,
although he told the Senate Banking Committee last month that he
knew of the $600,000 worth of ‘‘meals’’ for Defense Department
employees—a contradiction of his 1978 testimony before the same
committee—and called the illegal practice ‘‘not serious.”’

What is most disturbing is that the Carter Administration has
promoted Miller as being an excellent manager and administrator.
If he is, how could he not have known of $5.4 million in illegal
payments in his own company? How much can the American tax-
payers depend on this man to watch the nation’s money, where
there are many more millions of dollars to lose than there were at
Textron?

The Carter Administration has handled the Miller matter as bad-
ly as it handled the Lance affair. With a strong case made by the
impartial SEC that Mr. Miller has at least committed perjury, the
failure to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the charges
against the Treasury Secretary is yet another blemish on the
apolitical and pristine image the Administration has attempted to
project. Mr. Miller is known to be popular within the Administra-
tion (as Mr. Lance was), a factor which supports the notion that a
political fix has occurred in the Justice Department to help the
charges fade away.

Mr. Civiletti’s announcement Tuesday is, at least, an indication
that the Justice Department is as politically partial under Jimmy
Carter—who promised fairness—as it was under Richard Nixon,
making a mockery of the word ‘‘justice.”’

The only hope remaining is that Senators William Proxmire and
Bob Dole will continue their vigorous pursuit of the Miller case and
not allow these serious charges to fade into the background.

Letters To The Editor

Student Vandalized Second Time

Dear Editor:

For the second time in less
than a month, my car has been
vandalized while parked out-
side the University Center. The
first incident left my car
without an antennae, and a dent
in the hood. Following last
weekend’s rampage I will now
be driving minus one window.

Although owning a converti-
ble inevitably makes one a
more likely target for vandals,
college students should be
above such juvenile behavior.
Being an eternal optimist, I
would like to believe that the
destruction could be credited to
the ‘‘townies.”’

Unfortunately, I was foolish
enough to believe that the
‘‘bush-killing’’ incident was
committed by persons outside
the W&L community.

Vandalism is also very
prevalent within the confines of
the freshman dormitories. The
number of windows broken
each weekend is phenomenal.

Persiflage

Last weekend, for example,
trash was thrown throughout
the dorm, glass from broken
beer and liquor bottles littered
the floors, the stench of sulfur
smoke bombs wafted in the air,
and quite a few light bulbs were
knocked out.

Vandalism of a more serious
sort is also on the rise. Wallets,
records, and other valuables
are often reported missing from
dorm rooms. Once again the
‘‘townies”’ are blamed.

It is time the E.C. and the ad-
ministration recognized the
severity of this problem, and
dealt with it accordingly. Van-
dalism within the jurisdiction of
the University would not be too
particularly difficult to resolve.

Increased awareness of the
problems on the part of dorm
counselors would most likely
cut down on misdeeds within
the dorms. The counselors were
certainly not hired as
policemen, but at times a firm
hand is necessary.

Controlling delinquency in
areas surrounding immediate
University property is admit-

tedly more difficult to deter.
Ideally all students should
adhere to the principles of

gentlemenly conduct.
Then perhaps the W&L com-
munity would only have to con-

cern itself with the ‘‘townies.’’
Scott S. Bond ’83

Irony

Dear Editor:

The ironies of our little world
constantly amuse me. Each day
the faculty reiterates the opi-
nion that the student body needs
moral and social guidance.

Yet, I find that they have
scheduled the calendar so that
Easter Sunday lies in the midst
of final exams. This celebration
of the redemption of man is
usually set aside by believers as
a time of prayer and family
gatherings. Here it will be
forgotten among cold tests and
cafeteria beans.

God and our faculty works in
mysterious ways. They must
know what’s best for us.

Christopher DuRant

 

The Secret Of Success

Well, Mexico was just beautiful. I’d tell you all
about the enormous quantities of drugs and
beautiful women that are available south of the
border, but my editor continues to constrict the
space open to this grossly underappreciated col-
umn. Instead, I’ve decided to share with you the
secret of my success.

People are constantly coming up to me and ask-
ing, “Percy, how do you do it? How did you learn
to totally submerge all ethical and moral judg-
ment to the pursuit of wealth?”

Usually, I have to clear up some misconcep-
tions. Some guys have been so warped by all this
intellectual stuff that they automatically assume I
must have some kind of master philosophy to
justify my amorality. But that’s baby stuff,

Spencer, Carnegie, and the other Social Dar-
winists may make nice bedtime primers for the
kiddies, but they hardly help one actually reach
the pinnacle of material accumulation. I mean, if
you spend all your time trying to justify what
you've already done there’s no time left for fun,
right?

The same thing goes for all that stuff the C-
school tries to push off on people. Sure, they teach
you a bunch of neat little graphs and formulas, but
what help are those in showing you how to fore-
close on the local orphanage or how to quietly get

rid of the old widow in the tenement you’ve plann-
ed to turn into a condo?

For that sort of cold-hearted action you need the
type of experience that comes only from practice.
You could try to learn it on the job, but that sort of
lackadaisical attitude will condemn you to a life of
bitter drunken nights, a wife with a trailer for a
rear-end, and two weeks of Disneyland every
year. In short, you’ll end up a salesman or an of-
fice water cooler jockey.

Yet, if you plan ahead, you might be able to
avoid such a fate. A life of physical pleasure can
be yours as long as you learn early on to jettison
those unwieldy morals.

My own suggestion to this end, and it might seen
rather simple, is to play ‘Monopoly’ everyday.
What it lacks in realism it easily makes up in the
training it provides in becoming a real s.o.b.
(Take it from Percy.)

You learn to take pleasure in crushing your op-
ponents. You can feel the thrill of power and the in-
toxication of profit as you order some hapless vic-
tim to cough up the rent or clear out. The
adrenalin rush while counting one’s money is, by
itself, enough of a reason to play.

This ‘indoctrination into the vacuous world of
business ethics will always be valuable. Not only
will you feel better about yourself, you’ll also not
give a damn about what others think of you.

Free To Choose

“Hey Dad, I’ve been looking at one of your old Washington and
Lee catalogues that I found up in the attic but I’m having some
trouble understanding some of the words in it.”’

“Bring it here son and let’s have a look at it. Now, what’s giving
you trouble?”’

“‘Let’s see... what’s an ‘all male institution?’.”’

“Well son I know you'll find this hard to believe, but that’s
another name for a college or university in which you just have
men and no women.”’

“You're kidding Dad?!!! You went to a school for just men?
Where did all the women go?”’

‘In those days they went to all women’s schools; five of them
were located pretty close to W&L.”’

‘“‘What was W&L like without girls Dad?”’

“It’s funny son, but college life was great back then. You see,
classes were very small and the students all had a great time learn-
ing and socializing with the faculty. Most of our time was spent stu-
dying, but there were times for parties, too, and boy were they ever
good ones. In fact, the school was like one big college class;
everyone knew everyone else and we all enjoyed the friendship and
superb education the small size and single sex atmosphere W&L
provided.

It’s not that we were afraid of them son, it’s just that single sex
schools gave people the freedom to choose the type of atmosphere
they wanted. Co-ed schools did exist for those that wanted both boys
and girls on the same campus together, but for the most part, it was
tradition for boys and girls to go to separate schools in my day.”

“Dad, what’s this ‘tradition’ you’re talking about?”’

“Son, that’s where over the course of time a set way of doing
things is recognized as being the best and most enjoyable way anda
change would only be for the worst.”’

“Then why did W&L stop this ‘tradition?’”’

‘Because the people there didn’t appreciate a good thing when
they had it. They thought it would be fun to have girls around all the
time: on their athletic teams, in their classes, in their dorms, in
their showers, etc. They also thought it would be great not having to
fool with road-trips anymore.”’

‘Roadtrip, what’s that?”’

“That means we had to drive to the girl’s schools to see them. It
was nice because putting on a clean set of clothes and seeing the
girls became a special occasion and we looked forward to seeing
them when we wanted to, not because we had to, as in the case of a
co-ed school.”’

Fancy Dress Thanks

Dear Editor and Students of
Washington & Lee University:

I would just like to con-
gratulate you on the success of
your Fancy Dress Ball. Despite
the problems of the snow on
Saturday, Friday night seemed
like it was a success.

It is wonderful to see all the
students at your school getting

itiative is just what is needed to

along so well. Usually you are
divided up by fraternities — but
on this one night you seemed
united as a university. I think
that is one of the best things that
could come out of a weekend
like Fancy Dress.

So students of W&L you may
pat yourselves on the back. It is
nice to see unity in Lexington,
too bad it cannot happen more
often.

Sincerely,

Mountains,

Dear Editor:

In the natural progression of
molehills to mountains, found
only in the smallest enclaves of
frustrated sycophantics, lies
the latest example of Rossian
diplomacy. Kevin Ross, who
succeeded in turning an un-
conscious oversight on my part
into a major reprimand by the
Executive Committee of the
Ring-tum Phi and _ business
manager Kevin McGowan, suf-
fers from this syndrome. I call
it the Burt Lance syndrome

(because of his | stiking
resemblance to the former
Budget Director).

Plagued by the ever present
problem—lack of time—I did
not deliver 300 copies of the
newspaper to the law center on
the Thursday afternoon of Fan-
cy Dress weekend. (I apologize
to all for this oversight. I had in-
tended to deliver the papers,
but it slipped my mind. )

But law students should not
despair. Mr. Ross waited until
midnight Thursday and when

 

the paper failed to materialize
he set the ball rolling for the en-
suing storm.

There was no need for Kevin
McGowan to be castigated at
the hands of the . Executive
Committee. I had
spoken with representative
Fraser, President Abraham, as
well as Mr. Ross. There was no
need for Ross to pursue this
matter. It is a silly matter em-
braced by a silly man.

But where a simple problem
was correctly handled by a con-
ference with all involved par-
ties, Ross, like a Sydney
Greenstreet character, decided
to propel this very simple mat-
ter into a major E.C. discus-
sion.

The Ring-tum Phi has
assured all parties that this
oversight will not occur again.
It had done so before Monday
night’s meeting and now does so
again.

Secondly, I guarantee
delivery to the law school of the
Ring-tum Phi in the future.

But to Mr. Ross, who acted ir-

responsibly and in an immature
manner, let him eat cake.

The Ginsburg Affair Continued

Dear Editor:

In the March 6 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, Brian Ginsburg
replied to my letter of the Feb.
28 issue. Although this is getting
a bit old, Ginsburg still fails to
deal with the salient point in my
letter either because he is not of
sufficient intellectual depth to
do so or because he is choosing
to ignore it. Since he is a stu-
dent at W&L, I shall presume
the latter. The issue is not if
posters are signed or if they
foster discussion on campus.
The question here is whether
one individual, in this case
Ginsburg, has the right to judge
another’s posters and then
destroy the posters if his
criteria are not met.

For me, we are questioning
whether we are going to have a
free society. If people like
Ginsburg are going to judge and
destroy at will, other people will
be restricted in their right to ex-
pression. Ginsburg does not
speak to this issue at all but in-
stead diverts our attention to
tangential issues like

autographing posters.

A Dean of W&L, Lewis G.
John, says it well in a letter op-
posite to Ginsburg’s regarding
the SABU lecture: ‘“‘the univer-
sity community exists as a
forum for an open exchange of
ideas and points of view.’’ But
Ginsburg has decided he will
veto the Dean in that he will
regulate which ideas and points
of view will be exchanged. This
is wrong and I protest against
it. =

Brian, in your letter you ac-
cused me of making an “‘at-
tack’”’ on you. The Ring-tum Phi
headline called my letter an at-
tack not me. The last thing in
the world I want to do is to at-
tack you, On the contrary, as
much as I abominate your point
of view and am fearful of its
becoming widespread, I will
always defend your right to say
it.

It is you who is on the attack
— attacking the natural right of
human beings and the civil
right of Americans to openly
and freely express their point of

4. Frats On Conduct Pro

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee placed four fraternities on
conduct probation until the end
of the school-year for a rule
violation that occurred over
Fancy Dress Weekend.

The Judicial Board of the
Inter-fraternity Council decid-
ed, two weeks ago, not to take
any action against Phi Kappa
Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Beta Theta Pi and Delta Tau
Delta for holding a party that
lasted one hour past the 6 p.m.
deadline established for Sunday
parties.

$110,000 Project

 

 

However, the matter went to
the Student Affairs Committee
last week and SAC initially
placed the fraternities on social
probation for a week which
would have included IFC
weekend this Saturday. The
fraternities appealed the deci-
sion and SAC imposed the con-
duct probation penalty.

All IFC cases are reviewed by
the SAC.

Lewis G. John, Dean of
Students, said the conduct pro-
bation means that, if the frater-
nities appear before the IFC or

Plans For W&L

by Randy Smith

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity should build an open-air
pavilion-style facility
somewhere on campus, a
special ad hoc committee has
concluded after almost two
years of studying the proposal.

The W&L pavilion, which
would have about 5,000 square
feet of floor space (about the
size of Evans Dining Hall) and
would be similar in design to the
pavilion at Lake Robertson, is
estimated to cost over $111,000,
according to a_ preliminary
report obtained by The Ring-
tum Phi.

A proposal for a large enclos-
‘ ed structure which could be
heated and used in the winter
was rejected on the basis that it
“could not be justified finan-
cially.”

The pavilion committee,

which is made up of student Ex-
ecutive Committee members,
Student Activities Board of-
ficers, faculty members, and in-
terested students, interviewed
“a cross-section of University
administrators, faculty, and
students, and encountered only
one person who was opposed to
such a facility, and that per-
son’s concern was that the ex-
istance (sic) of a multi-purpose
facility might jeopardize the
fine arts department request
for a new theater.”

According to the report, the
student Executive Committee
has already approved a $5 sur-
charge on the annual student
tax to finance construction of
the pavilion.

Another option for financing
the pavilion was to use the
$13,000 in student money now in
an escrow account to cover

SAC again this year, the con-
duct probation will be taken into
account and the fraternities will
be dealt with more harshly.

John said the SAC does not
have automatic rules for deal-
ing with future violations.

However, he said penalties
would be more severe. The
degree of increased severity
would depend on the cir-
cumstances, John said. The

behavior.

members on this committee did
not foresee any problems in us-
ing the money for construction
purposes,”’ the report states.

A third financing alternative
is for the University to pay for
all or part of the construction.

The committee recommend-
ed two possible sites for the long
debated pavilion: the northwest
corner of the upper fields down
the road from the Liberty Hall
ruins where the cross country
course turns into the woods, or
in the ‘‘Pine Forest’’ behind the

Author To Speak
Next Thursday

John Toland, widely known
historian and author, will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity next Thursday. His talk,
“The Rising Sun,”’ will focus on
his Pulitzer Prize-winning
history ‘‘The Rising Sun: The
Decline and Fall of the
Japanese Empire, 1936-1945.”
Toland says ‘‘the speech
describes why I wrote the book,
how I researched it, and what I
found out — and what I’ve
learned since the book’s release
that hasn’t held up.”’

The lecture will take place at
8 p.m. in the Northern
Auditorium of the University

Library. All interested
members of the public are in-
vited to. attend the program,
which is under the joint spon-
sorship of W&L’s Department
of History and the East Asian
Studies Program.

In addition to ‘‘The Rising
Sun,’’ Toland is the author of a
number of best-selling
histories, many dealing with
German themes. He first ad-
dressed the subject of Hitler in
an account called ‘‘The Last 100
Days,’’ which was later made
into a motion picture. This was

EC Recommends Pledge Change

by John Billmyre

A recommendation sug-
gesting fraternity presidents
should not have to pledge that
their houses upheld social pro-
bation was passed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night.

When a fraternity finishes its
period of social probation, the
Student Affairs Committee re-
quires its president to sign a
statement saying his house
upheld the terms of social pro-
bation.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Steve Abraham said the
practice puts a strain on the
Honor System.

“The pledge puts fraternity
presidents in a bind — they
have a duty to the house and to
the honor system,’’ said
Abraham.

In response to a point made
by another EC member,
Abraham said the SAC pledge
required of fraternity
presidents is different from
other pledges.

“If you do not sign the SAC
pledge, you are assumed guilty,
not innocent,’’ the EC President
said.

Abraham also referred. to
page two of the White Book,
which says, “The Executive
Committee earnestly
discourages the use of pledges
in all matters of minor concern,
The use of a man’s word of
honor to regulate trivialities is
dangerous and should oertanaly
be avoided.”

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg agreed _ with
Abraham that the pledge should
not be used for trivial matters,

but said ‘‘The same trust that is
given by the faculty that allows
someone to sign a pledge is the
reason you (EC members in
favor of the recommendation)
want to do without the pledge.”’

After the meeting Blumberg,
who voted in favor of the recom-
mendation, said ‘Abraham
dominated the discussion of the
recommendation.”

Discussion on the problem
with pledges also drifted into
discussion of a situation at the
law school where a professor
uses a pledge to check class at-
tendance.

Dee Keesler, Senior
Representative, suggested the
EC stick to the problem with the
SAC pledge.

Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould opposed early

SCA Helps

A new organization in the
University Federation called
Students for Community Action
(SCA) has formed at W&L.

As the name suggests, the
organization seeks to provide a
means by which students can
actively participate in com-
munity service, providing both
skilled and unskilled labor to
repair the homes of low-income
families.

SCA works in conjunction
with Total Action Against
Poverty (TAP), a Federally
funded organization. TAP
locates those homes needing
repairs, whose residents are
willing to provide the necessary
funds for supplies, but annot af-
ford the labor. SCA provides
this labor by giving individual
students and student organiza-
tions (such as Fraternities and
Clubs), the opportunity to work.

SCA had its first volunteers
last weekend. Saturday morn-
ing nine members of Chi Psi
Fraternity rebuilt two stair
cases in a_ lower-income
neighborhood of Glasgow. One
resident, Mrs. Mamie Dunne,
was “tickled to death’’ over her
new steps.

SCA, recently formed on cam-
pus, hopes to both improve the

News Briefs ——

Outer Space Arms Race

Remember the space shuttle?
It looked something like a stub-
by airplane and it was supposed
to shuttle us earthlings to a
space station floating around
the globe, just like the science
fiction movies. ;

Well, the shuttle craft’s first
purpose will be as a military
weapon for outer space war-
fare, not manufacturing or
medical research. In the now
escalating spy war between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, the
space shuttle will play a very
important part.

Defense Secretary Harold
Brown told the Senate Commit-
tee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation last month that
the shuttle will be used to build
military installations in space
Either military spy stations or
bases with large lasers to blow
away hostile missiles or enemy
spacecraft.

President Carter made an in-
teresting reversal on the shut-
tle, ignoring it until Pentagon

officials told him about the shut- -

tle’s potential as a weapon —
and increased the budget for the
shuttle’s development.

One of our spy satellites got
some pictures of a Soviet shut-
tle craft, which has a striking
similarity to ours. But the Rus-
sians are still supposed to be

behind us in development of a
shuttle ship.

“One thing seems sure,” the
Baltimore Sun lamented. ‘‘The
U.S. and the Soviet Union are
engaged once again in an arms
race, this time in outer space,
with manned military
spaceships that might be armed
with weapons straight out of a
George Lucas movie.

Tuition Increases

W&L has fared pretty well in
the battle of the tuition in-
crease. Our tuition increase of
$350 or 9.5 percent isn’t bad
when compared with: YALE -
11.9 percent; DARTMOUTH -
13.1 percent; UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO - 13.3 percent; and
MIT - 17 percent.

What Price Art?

Who can appraise the price of
art? The General Services Ad-
ministration thinks it can and
has decided to purchase totem
poles for the fronts of 10 federal
office buildings throughout the

country.
At $10,000 a shot it’s a $100,000
decoration package.

‘““Microscopic,’”’ one GSA _ of-
ficial scoffed to a reporter for
Jack Anderson. A real bargain
for the taxpayers who foot the
bill.

McCormick Renovation Nears Completion

By Will Jackson

Despite the rain, sleet, snow
and the necessity of arriving at
work during winter’s dark of
night, the construction crews
renovating McCormick Hall are
nearing completion of their
work, well within contract
schedules for both time and
price.

The $3.5 million project to
convert the former Cyrus Hall
McCormick Library into the
new home of the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics
began last February. The job,
except for installation of fur-
nishings and educational equip-
ment, should be completed by
summer, with the actual move
to be finished in time for the
start of the next year’s term.

According to Frank Parsons,
assistant to the President of the
University, ‘‘one consideration
of the job was the preservation
of the character of the rooms.”’
This was accomplished by the
architectural firm of Marcellus,
Wright, Cox & Ladd primarily
through the use of dropped ceil-
ings.

All mechanical and electrical
systems are concealed within
the accoustical time-covered
ceilings, which curve up at the
sides to accommodate the
elaborate woodwork and tall
windows which are features of
the original building.

Maximum use of natural light
has been made throughout the
building. In some cases, walls

       

are angled to include more win-
dows in the rooms. Shadow-free
fluorescent grids, recessed in
the dropped ceilings, provide
ample artificial lighting.

The building is being com-
pleted from the top floor down,
which W&L’s Plant Projects
head, Pat Brady, says is the
sensible procedure for a
building of this size. Thus, while
all that remains to be done on
the third floor is painting, and
the second, or main, level is
mostly finished as well, the
basement still needs ceiling and
trim work and some further
wiring.

Brady noted that since the
project primarily involves in-
terior renovation, the persistent
bad weather has not caused
many delays. Intermittent dry
spells have allowed completion
of much of the masonry work
around the ODK circle, and of
the brick wheelchair access
ramp on the back of the
building.

The remodeled McCormick
building offers three times as
much space as Newcomb Hall.
Among its amenities are five
large classrooms, two semi-
circular, tiered ‘‘conference
classrooms” with projection
facilities, and several study and
seminar rooms.

Basement lounges are provid-
ed for both faculty and students.
(Though it lacks a_ private
bathroom, the student lounge
has more windows. )

Workman applies finishing touches to a ceiling.

     

   
      
   

The columned. reading room
of the former library has been
preserved for the same purpose
in the commerce school, and the
room immediately above it will
become the data center, to
which Tucker Hall’s computer
facilities will be moved.

Offices for 23 faculty
members are also included in
the renovation. Among these,
the most impressive is Dean
Edward C. ‘Atwood’s suite,
which includes a secretarial of-
fice and his large personal of-
fice, featuring three windows
and a private bathroom with
shower.

A major reason for the suc-
cess of the conversion project to
date, according to Brady, is
that ‘‘we have very good con-
tractors — they’re doing good
work.’’ The companies involved
are Bass Construction Co.,
general contractors, Howard P.
Foley, Co., electrical contrac-
tors, and Harris Heating and
Plumbing, Inc., mechanical
contractors, all Richmond-
based firms. In addition,
Charles W. Barger and Son of
Lexington are serving as sub-
contractors.

Tucker Hall is the next W&L
building slated for renovation.
Although contracts have not yet
been signed, work on the
building is expected to start in
April or May, with completion
in about 18 months. By necessi-
ty, said Parsons, that job will be
completed in phases, again pro-

“Once the computer center has
been moved,” Parsons said,
“they can complete the renova-
tion of that space.”’

Professional Directs ‘Pippin’

himself in the world. The fine

score consists of songs which
have since become pop stan-

By John Wells

The Washington and Lee
Drama Department is prepar-
ing for a March 24th opening of
the Tony award-winning
musical Pippin. Rehearsals
have been under way since
February for the production,
which will be presented at the
Troubadour Theatre.

Pippin was a major success
on Broadway when it opened in
the early 1970’s. Written and
composed by Stephen Schwartz
and Roger Hirson, (Godspell,
The Magic Show ), the original
production was directed and
choreographed by Bob Fosse,
who has been behind some of
the finest musical entertain-
ment to emerge on the stage in
the past two decades. Pippin
was a smash hit, winning im-
mense critical acclaim and
launching the careers of cur-
rent stars like Ben Vereen and
Oscar-nominee Jill Clayburgh.
The plot of the musical is based
on actual historical characters.
Pippin was the son of the
medieval e orer Charlemagne,
and the story deals with his at-
tempts to find a place for

dards; “Magic To Do” and
“‘Corner of the Sky.”’

The W&L case of Pippin in-
cludes sixteen players, among
them: Davis Sorrells, a senior
and a drama major whose
previous appearances include A
Doll’s Bouse, will portray the
“Teading Player’; Art Dun-
nam, also a senior recently seen
in Hamlet will perform the title
role; Pippin’s stepmother,
Fastrade, will be played by
Ginger McNeese; Charlemagne
will be played by Richard Boaz.
Other players include Robert
Schuman as Louis, Rose Gor-
don as Bertha, and law wife
Penny Westbrook as Kathy. The
musical director and producer
is W&L’s fine arts chairman .
Albert C. Gordon.

The cast and, undoubtedly,
the production has received the
benefit of work and assistance
from a professional director
and choreographer, Steve
Wiliford. Wiliford, a North
Caroline native, has himself
twice played the role of the

‘Leading Player’’ in Pippin
(most recently this summer at
the Haymarket Theater in Rich-
mond) and has been supervis-
ing rehearsals for several
weeks. Last week he was quoted
as saying ‘‘Without a doubt, this

- is one of the best rehearsed col-

lege shows I’ve ever seen.’’ The
director has had a wide and
varied career in the theater,
from Busch Garden enter-
tainments to Shakespeare com-
edies and recent fare such as
The Owl and the Pussycat.
Wiliford will return to New
York on closing night.

Drama professor Thomas
Ziegler has designed the set-
tings which take advantage of
the carnival-like atmosphere
and Charles Markley will con-
duct a five-piece orchestra,
located in a specially con-
structed off-stage pit.

Pippin will be performed at
the Troubadour Theatre from
Monday March 24th until Satur-
day the 29th. The box-office is
open, and required reservations
may be obtained by calling
463-9111, ext. 371.

African Jazz Group To Appear

”

“The Oneness of JuJu,’’ an
African jazz group from Rich-
mond currently touring
Virginia under the sponsorship
of the Virginia Museum of Fine
Arts, will perform at
Washington and Lee University
tomorrow evening at 8 p.m. in
Evans Hall. The program is
sponsored by W&L’s Student
Association for Black Unity in
cooperation with’ the
Rockbridge Chapter of the
Virginia Museum.

‘Afro jazz by the Oneness of
JuJu penetrates your mind,
body and soul,” one music critic
wrote recently of the group. In
their hour-long performance

and seminar, the members at-
tempt to trace the development
of Afro-American music from
its primitive origins to contem-
porary avant-garde jazz and
even disco music. Included are
explorations of the relationship
between jazz and more modern
rock rhythms and melodies, the
fusion music of the 1960s, and
the essential color of traditional
African music. Innovators and
major personalities in the
development of this important
branch of Western music will
also be discussed.

The group has recorded on a
number of commercial record-
ing labels and has been featured

at the Newport Jazz Festival,
the New York Musicians’ Jazz
Festival, the Berkeley Jazz
Festival and San Francisco’s
Black Expo.

On the morning of March 21,
the group will conduct a
workshop for interested musi-
cians. Reservations for the
workshop may be made through
Barbara Crawford, president of
the Rockbridge museum
chapter, at 463-7395, or W&L
assistant dean of students John
White at 463 463-9111, ext. 240.

No admission will be charged
for the concert, which is open to
the public. Beverages will be on

violence. These elements are developed in a wickedly entertaining
fashion in earlier Kubrick pictures, notable Lolita and Dr.
Strangelove; here, however, while there are scenes of satirical
humor, the overriding theme is senseless, orgiastic violence. With

‘Daddy’s Money Band’ Tonight

By Mark Beamer

Thursday night, March 20, the
foundations of the Cockpit will
be shaken by the forceful, hard-
driving vibrations of Daddy’s
Money Band, an unforgettable,
highly acclaimed five-man
blues band, who pound out rock
‘n roll, rhythm and blues, and
blues toa different beat.

Daddy’s Money appeal lies
in its retrieval of earlier rock
and blues tunes, which usually
tends to be disrégarded. The
members of the band interject
their own interpretation and in-
strumental skill into the 50s and
60s rock ‘n roll, giving it a new
dimension and allowing a
change from the tiresome, con-
temporary style of other rock
groups.

Grounding their present-day
music in the blues, the band’s

musical style has been dubbed
“Blue Wave.”’

During their tour which has
taken them from Baltimore to
Alabama and included 75 dates,
Daddy’s Money has appeared
on stage with other artists such
as Nighthawks, Nantucket,
Doug Kershaw.

Members of Daddy’s Money
include the leader, Ken Rhyne,
who plays the harmonica and
sings, Andy Hunter on lead
guitar, Pete Chakales on
drums, Bruce Horton on
rhythm and vocals, and Van
Miller plays bass.

The well organized band can
share the stage with any group,
as they perform great oldies
such as Chuck Berry’s’’House
of Blue Lights,’’ Little
Richard’s’’Reddy Teddy,”’
James Cotten’s ’’The Sky is

Folksinger Next Wed.

By Mark Beamer

If W&L students want to catch
a glimpse of a most unique ris-
ing talent, they should be sure
to see Willie Nininger in the
Cockpit on Wednesday, March

26 from 8-1 p.m.

Willie Nininger is a gifted
songwriter—folksinger, who
combines his wit, satire, in-
strumental skill, and glittering
personality to captivate his au-
dience, and to encourage them
to participate in the show that
he thoroughly enjoys perform-
ing. \

It is Nininger’s rare ability to
make his audiences feel at
home, as if he is playing for
them in their own family rooms,
that makes the artist so popular
in the New York area, where he
makes his home.

During the past few months,
Nininger has been visiting col-
lege campuses and small con-
cert halls along the East Coast.
He has made stops at William

and Mary, Virginia Tech,
University of Virginia, and
North Carolina State.

Although the talented folks-
inger performs songs from Bob
Dylan, Arlo Guthrie, Paul
Simon, Jackson Brown, Bruce
Springsteen, John Prine, and
the Beatles, his most popular
tunes are his own original songs
that include ‘‘Country Dough’’,
“Freshmen,” and ‘‘Proud to be
a Moose,” He also plays other
traditional tunes like his rock-
ing version of ‘“The William Tell
Overture,’’ which is the “Lone
Ranger Theme.’

There will be no cover charge

Falling,” and Jimmy Reed’s ’’]
Ain’t Got You.”

Whatever the band plays,
they don’t expect their au-
diences to sit still. In fact, Dad-
dy’s Money will be disappointed
if the entire Pit isn’t dancing in
the aisles when they kick off
their energized, rocking sets.

Although the group has only
been together as Daddy’s
Money for four months, they
have made such ‘an impact on
the musical scene that talk of a
recording contract in the near
future has been overheard.

Praised by radio stations
along the East Coast as one of,
if not the best, ‘‘professional’’
blues bands to play the concert
circuit, Daddy’s Money pro-
mises to rock the Pit without
pause from 8-11 p.m., this
Thursday night.

With no cover charge for the

‘show, don’t miss your chance to

see Daddy’s Money when they
perform live, in the Cockpit.

Movie Review

Empty ‘Gigolo’

By Frank Billingsley

Paul Schrader’s American
Gigolo seemingly attempts to
do for male prostitution what
Robin Hood did for robbery —
heroize it. Indeed, between his
black Mercedes convertible,
Georgia Armani attire, dinners
in chic restaurants, and good
looks; Julian Kay (Richard
Gere) certainly makes his oc-
cupation appear quite
fashionable — if not downright
enviable. Granted the costum-
ing is tasteful and elegant, the
scenery excellent, and the peo-
ple lead enchanting lifestyles;
but, unfortunately, this picture
remains strictly on the surface.

Julian Kay, the American
Gigolo, has risen quickly to a
world of profitable escorting
through a clientele of rich
Beverly Hills-Palm Springs
women. He is a slick harlot who
knows all the right things to do
and say, making his position
clear from the beginning, ‘‘I
don’t do fags or kink... I give
pleasure to women.”’

Yet Kay cannot receive
pleasure himself — apparently
not even from Lauren Hutton,
the beautiful wife of a powerful
Senator, who is destined to fall
in love with Kay and eventually
save his life. The screenplay,
also written by Schrader,
begins powerfully enough but
plummets weakly as_ the
minutes tick. As the story un-
folds, a previous client of Kay’s
is found dead — and Kay is left
holding the blame. No one will
accept his alibi. He has gotten
where he is in this world by
stepping on too many toes, slap-
ping too many faces, insulting
too many peopie, and now with
a charge of murder on his head
Kay has become persona non

grata in all circles, left only to
the mercy of those framing
him. But, alas, Lauren Hutton,
staking her marriage and hus-
band’s career, appears on the
scene to lie for Kay and spring
him from jail.

This is where the major flaw
in Gigolo arises. The ending
parallels too much the Greek
method of deux ex machina —a
device used in days of old when
a Greek god literally came
down from the clouds at the last
minute to rescue the drama’s,
hereo from’ inescapable
tragedy. It is a cheap way out.
And so with Gigolo — yes, the
ending is happy and typically
fairy-tale, but Kay is up a creek
and Hutton provides the
paddle much, much too easily:
It reminds me of the way Bat-
man and his pal used to escape
from their hopeless perils.

That’s the problem with the
plot.

Richard Gere’s_ problems,
which are not many, can be
blamed on the script which is
too confining to give Kay much
depth or produce a_ totally
steady character. When Gere is
called on for any kind of emo-
tion he fills the bill credulously
enough, and although his per-
formance is hardly Oscar
material he far surpasses
anything John Travolta could
ever hope to pull off: (Travolta
was originally cast in the film
but bagged it for who-knows-
why? — or cares?)

Lauren Hutton makes a par-
ticularly good showing
physically, lighting up the
screen, and as an actress. She
carries her role sincerely and
with a flair that makes her com-
fortable with the audience.

A Different
Look In ‘80

By Bill Whalen

Jack Emmer sat in the lacrosse lockerroom
after his team’s easy defeat of Syracuse and tried
to describe what happened.

You almost had to feel sorry for him.

You see, Jack Ammer’s lacrosse squad was low-
ly ranked in the pre-season polls and was not given
much of a chance to defeat the Orangemen, who
had been ranked sixth in one pre-season poll. And
there he was, almost an hour after the game, try-
ing to play down the win and his team’s per-
formance.

Sorry, Jack, but you had a right to be bragging
about your team after the way it performed on
Saturday.

Here were the Generals, a team which in 1979
could only depend on roughly four players to
score, getting goals out of eight different players.
Here was a team that was playing without one of
its better midfielders. Here was a team that had to
play in the muddy type of turf which normally
restricts its swing-style and cutting offense. And
all the Generals did was roll up their highest point
total since the Hofstra game of last year, the
lowest goals-allowed total since the Salisbury
State game of 1978 and the widest victory margin
since the Towson State game of last year.

No wonder Emmer was having such a hard time
trying to find flaws in his team.

Instead, the Generals seemed to have answered | n

any questions as to their strength and filled any
holes that may have existed before the season
started.

For example, W&L’s defense, which had dif-
ficulty clearing from its zone and picking up
ground balls, easily controlled the Orangemen’s

attack, which had rolled up 13 goals against a good
N.C. State team. Jim Herbert, playing man-to-
man defense against Brad Short, the All-
American attackman, held his man to only one
goal.

The middies corps, which was without the ser-
vices of George Santos, one of W&L’s better
players at that position, showed unexpected depth
as four different middies scored goals. Right now,
the middies would be the best asset of the
Generals, except for one fact.

Kearney Scores
Three In Romp

Chris Kearney, making his first appearance ina
W&L uniform in two years, scored three goals and
Rob Staugaitis added two goals and five assists as
the Washington and Lee lacrosse team upset
Syracuse, 12-5.

The win, the Generals’ first in the 1980 regular
season, moved W&L up to sixth place in the first
lacrosse poll of the regular season. The Generals
had been rated No. 12in pre-season polls.

“We needed this win to get our momentum
Started,” said winning Coach Jack Emmer. “It
also re-established us as a national contender.”’

Syracuse started the scoring, as Ralph Spinola
scored with the game only three minutes old. After
this score, all of the momentum went the
Generals’ way, as W&L cleared the ball effective-
ly and put pressure on the Syracuse goalie.

Kearney entered the game at approximately the
five-minute mark and immediately made his
presence known. Kearney scored the Generals’
first goal on a man-up situation at the seven-
minute mark of the first quarter.

Freshman John Doub scored two minutes later
to give the Generals a 2-1 lead. A man-up goal by
John Kemp at the ten-minute mark gave W&L a
3-1 lead.

For W&L in the second quarter, it was all
.Kearney. The 6’8” attackman scored twice in
seven minutes to give the Generals a 5-1 lead. A
Syracuse goal left the halftime score at 5-2.

If there was any doubt as to the outcome of the
game, it was answered by the midway mark of the
third quarter. After the Ordngemen scored to cut
the lead to 5-3, the Generals ripped off four
straight goals to take an imposing 9-3 advantage.

Freshman Geoff Wood made the score 6-3 and
John Hooper pumped in two goals to make it 8-3.
Staugaitis scored his first goal to put the score at
9-3.

One reason the W&L offense was performing so
well was the strong execution of the W&L defense.
All-American goalie Bob Clements was tough all
afternoon, stopping 18 of 23 shots. Jim Herbert
also played well, holding All-American attackman
Brad Short to one goal.

Netmen Lose To Strong ODU Squad, 8-1

By Dale Park

With the weather finally per-
mitting, the W&L netmen were
able to compete in at least one
of their last four scheduled mat-
ches.

Although last Friday’s and
Saturday’s matches against
West Chester State and George
Mason University, respective-
ly, were showed out, the
Generals did manage to play
Old Dominion University at
home on Sunday.

Old Dominion is one of the top
Division I tennis teams in
Virginia. Despite some good
first-set performances by some
of the Division III Generals, Old
Dominion won easily, 8-1.

The only bright spot for W&L

was freshman Steve Denny’s
6-1, 6-2 win over ODU’s John
Harrison at sixth singles.

The rest of the afternoon
belonged to Old Dominion.

Senior co-captain Stewart
Jackson, playing Bill Clark at
first singles, barely lost the first
set, 7-46. Despite some tough
passin9 shots from Jackson,
Clark was able to take control of
the net late in the match and
Dominion’s flight-one singles
man took the second set, 6-3.

W&L freshman Jack Shar-
man had a rough time at second
singles as he was easily downed
by Robert Hale, 6-2, 6-0. Junior
Peter Lovell, like Jackson, lost
a close 7-6 first set decision
against Colin Davis at third

singles. Yet again, it was the
ODU player who took charge in
the second set and Lovell suc-
cumbed, 6-1.

Both senior co-captain David
Constine and junior Doug Gaker
went quietly against tough op-
ponents. Constine, the defen-
ding 0.D.A.C. champ at fourth
singles, fell to Todd Furniss,
6-1, 6-1, while Gaker bowed to
Ken Phelan, 6-3, 6-2.

The doubles were swept by
0.D.U.

Jackson and fellow senior Pat
Norris teamed at first doubles
for W&L, but were dropped, 6-1,
6-3, by Clark and Furniss of Old
Dominion despite some good
net play by iNorris.

At second doubles, Lovell and
Gaker of the Generals gave
Hale and Phelan a fight in the
first set, falling 7-5, while drop-
ping the second set 6-2. In the

meantime, W&L’s Constine and
Sharman of W&L, who teamed
at third doubles, failed to get on
track against Davis and Har-

By Chris Sisto

The Generals’ baseball team
opened its season on a negative
note as by dropping a 10-3 con-
test to Longwood Coilege last
week.

The game was much closer
than the score indicates as the
Generals had chances fo get
some runs but left the bases
loaded in both the eighth and
ninth innings, leaving a total of
six men on base.

Joel Weston went the full nine
innings on the mound for
Washington and Lee. Weston
pitched fairly well for his first

commenting on

outing as a college pitcher,
walking only three and giving
up four earned runs.

Weston’s undoing came in the
seventh inning when W&L’s
defense fell apart. The team co-
mitted five errors in_ that
stretch and gave up six unearn-
edruns.

Despite the loss, Head Coach
Chuck Kroll was pleased with
his team’s play and is sure they
will be winners in the future.
“This was the best we have
looked in the two years I have
been with the team,”’ said Kroll,
the game.

“Longwood didn’t beat us, we
beat ourselves.”’

“I’m confident we will do bet-
ter,’’ continued the coach.

Kroll praised the offensive
power of Chris Cavalline, who
had three hits, and the defen-
sive work of John Stagmaier,
who made some fine plays in
the field.

The Generals’ home opener
scheduled for last Saturday was
postponed due to poor playing
conditions. The team’s next
game is Thursday night against
ODAC opponant Bridgewater
College in an away game.

And that factor is the attack.
Rob Staugaitis had five assists
for the second straight game,
Mike Pressler scored a goal and
dealt out several checks to
Syracuse defensemen and
freshmen Geoff Wood saw lots
of playing time and scored
once.

But the biggest factor of all
had to be Chris Kearney. He
entered the game with W&L
behind 1-0 and; when he left,
had scored three times to give
his team a 5-2 advantage.

On a team which appears to
be strong all over, Kearney
may be the most visible
strength of all. His mere size
dictates fear from opposing
defensemen and his movement
draws enough attention to allow
his teammates to get open for
easy shots. In a game with his
team down by a goal, Kearney
can easily be called on for ins-
tant offense.

Which is what he did against
Syracuse.

But how should we evaluate
Saturday’s win? Actually, it
was the first in a series of
necessary wins to gain the
playoffs. The seven-goal win
vaulted the Generals six places
and dropped five

Still, it should’ be
remembered that the polls do
not determine who does or does
not go into the playoffs. Last
year, for example,
Massachusetts was not among
the top eight rated teams but
still was selected by virtue of
some impressive late- season
wins. So don’t pay too much at-
tention to the polls until the end
of the season.

Saturday’s game against N.C.
State will be another of those
contests that the selecting com-
mittee will look at when
deciding playoff berths. Con-
sidering the explosiveness of
the Wolfpack’s offense, it
should be another good test for
the Generals.

Golf Team To Start
With Youthful Squad

by Kip Gordon

Poor weather has plagued the
golf Generals so far this season,
forcing their first two matches
to be postponed and imposing
uncomfortable practice condi-
tions. But with any luck, the
Generals will open their 1980
season today against
Longwood.

This year’s team is a young
one with only two seniors and
two sophomores returning from
last year’s starting six.

Senior Gerry Barousse will
captain the Generals this
season and figures to be the

mainstay of the squad. A two-
year letterman, Barousse is the
defending ODAC titlist, and
finished 11th in a 120 player
field in. last year’s NCAA Divi-

.sion III Championships.

Other returning lettermen in-
clude Senior Tom Wall and
sophomores Jim Kaplin and Bill
Alfano.

Again, due to the weather,
practice time has been limited
and for this reason the team
roster is still not complete at
this writing. A junior, two
sophomores, and 10 freshmen

are new faces to golf tryouts
this year, bringing the total
number of candidates to 20 for
the 12 positions on the team.

The team this year will be

‘looking for its third ODAC title,

and a fourth-straight trip to the
NCAA tournament.

These goals may be a bit
overambitious for the golf
Generals considering their
youth, but Coach Buck Leslie is
still confident. “Although we’re |
a bit short on experience, we do
have some talent to work with,”’
he said.

Lax Team Hosts Wolf Pack

, (continued from page 6)

Syracuse cut the lead to 9-4,
but John Sancilio put the
Generals ahead, 10-4. After
another Syracuse score, at-
tackman Mike Pressler and
Staugaitis each scored to end
the game at 12-5, W&L.

After the game, Emmer had
nothing but praise for his team.
‘“‘We had a good balanced at-
tack,’’ said the coach, “‘and our
defense did a good job geeting
ground balls and making
stops.”’

undefeated record on the line
this Saturday at home against
the N.C. State Wolfpack. Last
week, the Wolfpack lost a 13-12
decision to Syracuse.

According to Emmer, N.C.
State has an “‘explosive offense,
which will give our defense a
good test.’’ To beat the
Wolfpack, Emmer says _ his
team will “have to control the
ball and keep the pressure in
their (N.C. State’s) zone.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Elections And The SCC

The president and vice-president of each academic
class do much more than organize the annual class
grain party—they sit on the Student Control Commit-
tee. Serving as members of Student Control is, simply
put, the most important funtion the class president
and vice-president perform. When you are caught for
‘“‘ungentlemanly behavior’? down the road or for
trashing bushes on campus, you will appear before
Student Control. Your future actions will be judged by
the peers you elect Monday.

Unlike last week’s election, there will be plenty of
choice on Monday’s ballot (see page 2). Three can-
didates are running for senior class president, five for
junior class president, and four for sophomore class
president. There is even more competition for the ex-
ecutive committee and vice-presidential positions.

With so many in the flock, there’s sure to be a lot of
hand-shaking and other politicking. There will pro-
bably be ample opportunity to query the candidates
about marijuana-smoking-in-the-dorm-penalties,
drunken-escapade-punishments, and other pertinent
questions about Student Control’s procedures. After
all, if they’re running for the position, surely they
know what the job entails, right?

Fraternities And Honor Pledges

Monday’s Executive Commit- —_ scious sidestepping of them.
tee vote ‘‘recommending”’ that
fraternity presidents not sign a
pledge concerning the uphold-
ing of their house’s social pro-
bation raises two important
questions.

It just goes to show, everyone
loves a party, and not even the
EC would want the honor

system to stand in the way of
having fun.

Dave Dudka is a member of The
Ring-tum Phi's editorial staff

 

ue

 

First, is the EC admitting
that fraternities often break the
rules of their probation? And
second, is the EC attempting to
grant fraternities permission
for future violations by
disallowing the pledge?

EC President Steve
Abraham, himself a fraternity
member, summed it up clearly
when he said, ‘‘the pledge puts
fraternity presidents in a bind—
they have a duty to the house
and to the honor system.”’

Thoughts On
The $1,000 Shower

What happens when a big-league executive goes
down south to teach at a small, all-male semi-prep
college? It’s really quite obvious: he begins to miss
the hustle and bustle of the real world; the competi-
tion, the stress, the intense high-level meetings with
other execs; and most of all, the former big-leaguer
misses his shower. How badly does he miss his
shower? Well, if given the chance, he will have one in-
Stalled next to his office.

And that is exactly what Edward Charles Atwood
Jr., Dean of the School of Commerce, has done—
installed a shower next to his office. The tiled shower
only cost about $1,000; a real bargain.

Dean Atwood’s shower deal is such a bargain that
we are beginning to wonder if all professors shouldn’t
have their own showers adjoining their offices.
Maybe the younger professors could get hot tubs,
even suanas. The possibilities are limitless.

Of course, equal shower privileges could get a little
expensive—perhaps only the department heads
should be allowed the luxury. But other department
heads still do not have the advantage Dean Atwood,
not so affectionately known by his students as ‘‘Eddie
the Ax,’’ enjoys: he works a mere 40 yards from his
home. It is an old house, but we bet it has plumbing,
toilets, probably a bath tub, and maybe even a
shower.

God forbid Dean Atwood take a shower in the gym.
How demeaning! The mere thought is simply in-
tolerable. Besides, how else can a small-college pro-
fessor play big-league executive without his own
private shower facility?

proposed path

 

Is Abraham implying that ;
there is a breakdown between 1 Merwe. 3 evening
fraternity presidents and the 2 Fer att pefore during:
honor system or perhaps be- od afler classes,
tween the president and his
fraternity? In any case, there
should be no conflict in signing
a pledge if a house has adhered
to the probation. !

The EC believes that such a
pledge is ‘‘trivial,”’ and perhaps
many fraternities consider it
so—particularly ones which
break their probation.

W&L Should Become Co-ed

Dear Editor:

An interesting commentary
in last week’s edition. I’m glad
we can hear the arguments
against coeducation. Mr.
Willhite has presented his sen-

but I think we should examine
those arguments before we ac-
cept them as fact.

I stumbled first when I read
that ‘five (women’s schools)
were located pretty close to

before. Now, I don’t know much
about Mr. Willhite’s hometown,
but in my hometown, if my date
lives 35, 40, or 50 miles from me,
I don’t say she lives ‘‘pretty
close,’’ Maybe it’s different in

timents against change nicely, W&L.”’ I’ve heard that line

 

 

Commentary.

‘What’s This Tradition?’

“Hey dad, I’ve been looking at some of your old Washington and
Lee catalogs, but I’m having trouble understanding some of the
concepts they describe.’’

‘Bring them here son and let’s have a look at what’s troubling
you.”’

“Dad, I’ve been reading about single-sex colleges in my ab-
normal psychology text and I was wondering what you think to be
the advantages of all-male schools.”’

“It may seem funny to you son, but college life was great back
then. You see classes were very small and the students all had a
great time learning and socializing with the faculty. Most of our
time was spent studying, but there were times for parties, too and
boy were they ever good ones. In fact, the school was like one big
college class; everyone knew everyone else and we all enjoyed the
friendship and supurb education the small size and single-sex at-
mosphere W&L provided.”

“You say that a single-sex atmosphere contributed to the superb
education?”’

“That’s right son, you see we studied more often because girls
were not around to distract us. We could get them and make use of
them when we needed them, but we didn’t have to, Lee forbid, live
with them.”

“Oh, I see. Dad, can you define atequaee and sexism for me?’”’

‘‘Huh, what’s that son?”

‘‘Nothing dad.”’

“You see it’s not that we were afraid of them son, it’s just single-
sex schools gave people the freedom to choose the type of at-
mosphere they wanted. Co-ed schools did exist for those that
wanted both boys and girls on the same campus together, but for
the most part, it was tradition for boys and girls to go to separate
schools in my day.”

‘What was this tradition dad? Was it useful? Isn’t it what let peo-
ple choose a husband for their daughters, and keep slaves and deny
the vote to women, and establish literacy tests, and unify church
and state, and...”’

*“‘What?”’

“Don’t you see dad that a single-sex education denied you the
right to a logical education? Don’t you agree that the ability not to
be distracted from work by ‘objects’, like women, is a sign of
maturity and that a false maturity was thrust upon you? And how
can you justify the denial of admission to people whose only crime
was being female? Can’t you perceive the incredible amount of ar-
rogance needed to uphold such a moral and social anachronis?”’

“Tradition! Tradition!”’

‘‘But how is tradition useful? What is it?”’

“Tradition is where over the course of time a set way of doing
things is recognized as being the best and most enjoyable way anda
change would only be for the worst.”

“So, tradition is based on the past. Wasn’t it a rather rigid
system? Didn’t it lead to stagnation? You still haven’t told me how
it is useful. If it was so good, why did W&L stop this tradition?”

“Because the people didn’t appreciate a good thing when they
had it. They thought it would be fun having girls around all the
time; on the athletic teams, in ths classes, in the dorms, in their
showers, etc. They thought it would be great not having to fool with
road trips anymore.’

‘Road trip, what’s that?”’

“That means that we had to drive to a girls school to see them. It
was nice because putting on clean clothes and seeing the girls
became special occasion and we looked forward to seeing them.
Just like we look forward to seeing your mother on weekends when
we drive to see her on a road trip. We saw the girls, like we see your
mother, when we wanted to, not because we had to.”’

“But Dad, doesn’t that attitude imply the superiority of the male
who can pick and choose? Didn’t it debase the role of women as

‘human beings?’’

“Uh...yes...I can kind of see your point, but it must be wrong,
because it is not consistent with tradition which is always right.
Well, I hope I’ve cleared that up son.”’

“You sure have dad, but I did have one more thing to ask you.”

“‘What’s that son?”’

“Dad, are you for real?”

Richmond.

It also interests me that Mr.
Willhite believes the single-sex
atmosphere provides the friend-
ships and superb education we
enjoy at W&L, It may sound in-
credible, but I think there are
some small co-ed colleges that
also offer friendships and
superb education.

I didn’t realize those two ad-
vantages were inextricably
linked to. single-sex  at-
mosphere. Mr. Willhite might
even find that he would have
some friends who were girls at
those co-ed schools. Though
perhaps not, if he let them read
his commentaries.

I certainly agree with Mr.
Willhite that single-sex schools
allow freedom to choose bet-
ween co-ed and all-male
schools. But there are two pro-
blems here.

First, I don’t believe there is
much demand for single-sex
schooling these days. There are
obviously 1400 undergraduates
here, but the vast majority of
tnose students came here for
reasons other than the single-
sex atmosphere, I have, admit-
tedly, met two people who have
told me they came here because
the school was single-sex, and
there are undoubtedly others
who came here for that reason.
But those students are in a tiny
minority. Should we feel con-
strained to remain single-sex
for a-very few people out of our
population?

I think we should interest
ourselves, instead, in trying to
join (or remain in) the ranks of
the nation’s finest colleges. We
would be a better school if we
admitted a broader sampling of
the population?

The other problem is that I
don’t believe high school
students who have spent most of
their years in co-ed schools can
understand what it means to at-

Law School ee
To Burnham Letter

To the Editor:

At the risk of reviving an
issue that hopefully is dead, I
feel compelled to respond to Mr.
Burnham’s letter to the Phi of
March 13, 1980.

Mr. Burnham either did not
know or instead chose to ignore
the facts that led to the article
in the Law News and to the ac-
tions of Kevin Ross.

Neither of these things was in-
tended nor should have been
considered a personal attack on
Mr. Burnham. I, therefore, find
it difficult to understand or ex-
cuse the type of response that
Mr. Burnham chose to make to
the Phi.

Since the beginning of the
school year, the Phi has failed
to deliver nearly one-half of its
total number of issues to Lewis
Hall.

Part of each law student’s Ac-
tivities Fee is retained by the
EC each year to fund a portion
of the university-wide ac-
tivities, such as the Phi.

Repeated attempts through
various channels by several law
students to prompt regular
delivery of the Phi met with
repeated assurances that the
problem had been recognzied
and corrected.

When Mr. Burnham took over

. the job of delivering the paper,

it was hoped that everything
had indeed been straightened
out. Kevin Ross’s actions were
therefore justified when on
February 28, the Phi, once
again, failed to appear at Lewis
Hall.

Mr. Burnham told me that
this “‘oversight’’ was a result of
personal pre-Fancy Dress
preparations. Mr. Burnham
should remember that he is be-
ing paid each week from the
pocket of every student at
Washington and Lee. If his per-
sonal schedule is too crowded to
tully perform his duties,
perhaps other arrangements
should be made.

I have received personal
assurances from Mr. Burnham
that the delivery problems will
not be repeated. I take him at
his word.

Nonetheless, his supercilious
tone and derogatory references
to Kevin Ross offended many
law students and was complete-
ly inexcusable in light of the cir-
cumstances.

Kevin Ross is a valued friend
and a respected member of the
law school community. I
believe that Mr. Burnham owes .
him an apology.

Sincerely,
Bill Garrett

Studying And Fire Alarm Buzzers

 

 

As I sit in my carrol on the fourth floor of the
library, trying to write a term paper, my thoughts
are continually distracted by a high, shrill buzzer
which tells me that someone has either come in or
gone out of one of the fire doors.

It’s upsetting to me that the one place on cam-
pus which should allow students to study peaceful-
ly isn’t fulfilling that obligation because ‘‘someone
up there’’ hasn’t figured out that his sacred fire
doors are an inconvenience, and:no more.

The doors are not locked. So, are students com-
ing from Woods Creek Apartments or the ROTC
building expected to walk up to the main floor and
then down four flights of stairs to get to their ac-
customed study area. When an open door is right
in front of them?

Are students trying to get to one of these
buildings expected to go up four flights of stairs
and down the same amount to arrive at a place 20
feet from an open door? Sure, you say, take the
elevator. Great! They’re broken more than half

the time.

Well, if students continue to use those doors, the
buzzer will keep ringing. So are we expected to
post a guard to yell at the multitude going in and
out? Be reasonable. No one would listen and the
ones who get punished are those studying, not
those using the doors.

Furthermore, if these doors are meant to keep
down book thefts, why are they unlocked and why
doesn’t someone chase each offender to see if he or
she has carried out unchecked books? But some-
one needn’t set off an alarm to leave the library
with stolen books. Just put them with the rest of
your books and walk out the main doors. No one
will challenge you.

I hope that something will be done so that I can
Study quietly and undisturbed in an area so .
designated. I’m not fond of studying anyway and
the lack of places to do so encourages me to find
nice quiet liquor stores and drinking
establishments.

tend a single-sex school. One
reason is that they fall prey to
the claim that there are five
women’s schools ‘‘located pret-
ty close to W&L.”’

I won’t quibble with Mr.
Willhite’s definition of ‘“‘tradi-
tion,” but I will argue that
traditions are founded in a cer-
tain time period that embraces
certain ideas. When we leave
that period, we must remember
that the ideas often change.

We no longer believe, for ex-

ample, that duelling is the
honorable way to settle
arguments. Some _ traditions

last longer than others. We still
believe we can be trusted to
behave honorably on this cam-
pus, and we therefore maintain
the honor system tradition.

But surely Mr. Willhite will
agree that attitudes toward
women have changed since
1749; we should, therefore, ex-
amine our school’s attitude
women to see if we should step
into the modern era.

Apparently, the time when
men attended all-male schools
to avoid being pulled into the
quagmire of inferior female in-
tellect is over. A change in our
educational system, then,
might be wise.

Mr. Willhite contends that
many people would change our
all-male status because they
believe it would be fun to have
girls around campus. He conve-
niently overlooks the fact that
many advocates of coeducation
believe the change might im-
prove the education offered in
Lexington.

Co-ed classes would enable
students to hear opinions from
men and women and would
teach us that members of both
sexes are capable of having
good ideas. We might learn that
women can contribute to class
discussion as well as to party

A: Oh, so the IFC has complete jurisdiction over the fraternities?
B: Well, no. The SAC has the right to review any IFC decisions.

A: Oh. But I guess most of the time the SAC respects the decisions
of the IFC. After all, the fraternities represent a major segment of
the student body and the W&L viewpoint has always recognized
that students should be responsible for their own affairs.

B: Well, it doesn’t really work out that way. You see, the SAC
believes that the IFC sometimes acts irresponsibly. Therefore,
they feel that they must monitor the IFC to correct any difficien-

A: You mean they protect the IFC from itself?

I must admit Mr. Willhite’s

tary, however, included this ex-
planation: ‘‘we look forward to
seeing (women) when we
wanted to, not because we had
to, as in the case of a co-ed
school.”

It’s apparently going to be
quite a shock to Mr. ; Willhite
when he graduates in a couple
of months and has to see women
nearly every day. Of course, he
can try to look for a church job.
(I believe some _ Italian
monasteries are taking applica-
tions.) For those instances
when contact with women is
unavoidable, our infirmary
dispenses cootie shots free of

 

charge.
Transferring is not the easy
alternative many believe it is.
Choosing a school is a com-
plex process, and there are
other factors involved than the
co-ed aspect. Cost, size, loca-

The ’79 Graduates

How Are They Doing Now?

by Mike Perry

A survey conducted by the
University Office of Career
Development and Placement
offers encouraging news about
Washington and Lee University
1979 graduates.

A report prepared by Career
Development and Placement
Director Michael Cappetto in-
dicates that 35 percent of 1979
W&L graduates entered grad-
uate schools this past fall while
57 percent obtained jobs; only
4.8 percent remained
unemployed.

The report concluded that
business professions (including
accounting), education, jour-
nalism and the military were
the most popular careers
among members of the class of
1979. The report also added that
while approximately one-half of
last year’s working graduates
had received job offers on or
before graduation day, about 10
percent obtained their jobs in
the five months following
graduation and 50 percent con-
tinued to receive job offers
throughout the summer
months.

Summer Anthro Program

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s anthropology department
will sponsor a field school in
historical archaeology _ this
summer, giving participants an
opportunity to explore patterns
of early settlements of
Rockbridge County.

In session from mid-June
through mid-August, with the
exception of the week of July 6,
the summer program is an
outgrowth of Washington and
Lee’s series of spring and sum-
mer excavations at Liberty

IFC Weekend

60 Kegs,

Inter-fraternity Council
weekend, scheduled for this
Saturday, will feature three
bands and 60 kegs, Ab Boxley,
social chairman, told the IFC
during a meeting Monday night.

The party at Zollman’s
Pavilion is scheduled to last
from 5 p.m. until 2 a.m. and will
also feature 25-cent hot dogs
and an IFC beer chugging con-
test, Boxley said. Each fraterni-
ty can enter one chugger in the
contest and the winner’s frater-
nity will receive a keg from the
IFC,

The bands signed are Boot
Hill Express, a southern rock

Hall, the university’s 18th-
century predecessor institution.

Cabin sites and other loca-
tions of interest have already
been pinpointed, most in the
House Mountain region, ac-
cording to asociate an-
thropology professor John M.
McDaniel, who directs the field
school.

Each student will work eight
hours a day in the field, with
two evenings a week spent in
classroom or laboratory exer-
cises, McDaniel said. Transpor-

tation will be provided from the
W&L campus to the excavation
site each day.

Participation in the program
requires no previous exposure
to historic archaeology, and is
open to interested adults as well
as high school and college
students.

Registration for the program
will begin later this month. For
further information about costs,
meals and loding, call the an-
thropology department at

band; Liquid Pleasure, playing
funk and soul; and the Good
Humor Band which plays a
variety of music with a tenden-
cy toward rock. The bands are
tentatively scheduled to play in
the order they were listed.

Tickets for non-fraternity
members will cost $5 each and
$8 per couple. No tickets will be
sold at the gate.

In other business, the follow-
ing nomination were made: for
secretary, Brian Gibson and

man, Marc Firestone and Don
Rigger.

The median annual salary
range for W&L graduates was
$11,000 to $11,999, an increase of
$1,000 from 1978. Business and
humanities graduates attracted
the highest median salaries
($12,000 to $12,999), followed by
the social science and jour-
nalism graduates ($11,000 to
$11,999) with the science
graduates having the lowest
median salary range ($10,000 to
$10,999).

A survey by the College
Placement Council shows
salary means for W&L grad-
uates to be similar to national
salary means for all 1979 col-
lege graduates. Mean salaries
for 1977 and 1978 graduates
were below the national
average and 1979’s figures
could be an indication that the
two year trend of low salaries
for Washington and Lee
graduates has been reversed.
The W&L report noted that this
may be especially true for
humanities graduates whose
mean salaries have lagged
significantly behind the na-
tional average in the past.

The Office of Career Develop-
ment and Placement report
also states that 23.5 percent of
W&L’s 1979 graduates consider
themselves to be ‘‘under-
employed,’ and believe that
their skills, education and
resources are being underutiliz-
ed. Another 9.7 percent of
W&L’s working graduates ‘‘saw
no future in what they are (cur-
rently) doing.’ Cappetto term-
ed this percentage ‘‘favorable”’
in light of the tough job market
situation facing virtually all col-
lege graduates and he suspects
that this is probably below the
national percentage of job
dissatisfaction among recent
college graduates.

About 35 percent of the
graduating class _ entered
graduate and_ professional
schools as full-time students.
This figure is very close to the
average number of W&L
students who traditionally opt
for graduate study.

For the fourth year in a row,
the most popular choice of
graduate study among W&L
graduates was law school; 13.9

White Front = 1° S. Main Street

Charge Accounts’’

Super Market

percent of the class of 1979
entered a variety of law
schools. Mercer University of
Georgia had the highest
number of W&L graduages (4)
in its first year class, while only
2 graduates are attending
Washington and Lee University
Law School.

Four percent of the
graduating class entered
business school as full-time
students. Although programs
leading to a Masters in Business
Administration (MBA) are
open to graduates from all
academic majors, most W&L
graduates who entered MBA
programs over the past three
years were business and social
science majors. Like their law
school counterparts, W&L
business students chose a wide
geographic variety of graduate
schools. Washington and Lee is
best represented at William and
Mary College where three 1979
graduates are enrolled.

Nearly seven percent of the
class of 1979 reportedly entered
medical school. Again the
schools selected by W&L grad-
uates reflected a broad
geographical range; four grad-
uates chose the University of
Virginia.

Approximately 11,1 percent of
the 1979 graduating class
entered graduate school pro-
grams other than law, medicine
or business. These graduates
elected to study at a wide varie-
ty of schools in fields ranging
from linguistics to civil
engineering, with geology being
the most popular choice among
1979 graduates.

was the only EC member to
vote against it.

Ould suggested several
changes in the original recom-
mendations, which may have
altered some EC members’
votes on the measure.

Willis and Senior
Representative Bruce Poole ap-
peared to be in opposition to the
recommendation in early
debate, but voted in favor of it
after Ould’s suggestions.

In other action Monday night,
‘the EC decided to re-submit an
amendment that would raise
the balance of the EC Reserve
Fund from $2,500 to $4,000.

The amendment did not pass
the last time it was put up, dur-
ing the Big Three Election,
because 50 percent of the stu-
dent body did not vote in the
election.

Freshman Representative
Edmund Schenecker proposed
the motion and said voting on
the amendment should span a
three-day period.

That period will fall during
Law School elections and
registration for underclassmen,
if the registrar can work out a
schedule.

Jim Vines, Chairman of the
Student Emergency Loan Com-
mittee, requested and received
$25 from the EC.

The money will be used to buy
a ledger and files for the
SELC’s records.

Vines said the SELC has kept
disorganized records, a pro-
blem he wants to rectify.

Student, faculty, and alumni
groups would be able to reserve
the facility by renting it from
the University. ‘‘Rental fees
should be adequate to cover the

operating expenses and assist
in defraying construction
costs,’’ the report says. The pic-
nic area around the facility
could be used without charge.

The Office of Plant Projects
estimated construction costs at
about $15 per square foot;
$20,000 for two bathrooms; and

With elections coming up, the
EC set rules for valid ballots.

The EC decided a valid ballot
is one which is cast in favor of a

It also decided that in cases

where a student only votes for

to vote for two, the ballot will

still be considered valid.

on the funding account.

Freshman Removed From Ballot ;

But Sti

By John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
held a special meeting Sunday
night to discuss a , Voting
Regulations Board recommen-
dation that a freshman can-
didate for the EC be removed
from. Monday’s election
because he _ overspent his
budget.

When the meeting ended two
hours later, the eandidate, John
Lowe, had been removed from
the ballot for overspending his
budget, but was allowed to par-
ticipate in the election as a
write-in candidate.

The next day, Lowe received
66 votes from the freshmen
class, finishing second behind
Kraig Armantrout, who had 71
votes, and advancing to today’s
freshman class run-off.

But the hastily called meeting
Sunday night was more com-
plicated that the outcome in-
dicates. The EC went through
five votes with much debate and
some heated words.

   

Jim Wenke, Sam Allen, and Jay Blumberg listen to the discussion

of John Lowe’s status at Sunday’s EC meeting.

Before voting on the VRB
recommendation, the EC asked

Lowe to explain the cir-
cumstances which led to the
overspending charge.

“T Jet the VRB have my ex-
pense list, which was $4.80 for
flyers and $4.80 for a Ring-tum
Phi ad,’’ Lowe said.

Lowe said friends made dona-
tions to pay for a party, which
the candidate advertised on his

 

W&L Tenure Series

 

by Joe Scott

Of the 14 full time employees
in the Physical Education
department, 11 have tenure.

The same tenure process is
used in the P.E. department as
in other parts of the University.
Those promoted to associate
professor or those who have
taught full time for seven years
are eligible.

First there is a meeting of all
tenured professors in the
department to discuss the
merits of the teacher being con-
siderad, then a vote by secret
ballot. A unanimous vote will
mean a positive recommenda-
tion written by Athletic Direc-
tor William McHenry. If there
are dissenting votes then
McHenry makes a recommen-
dation on how he feels.

The recommendation is then
submitted to the Dean of the
College, William Watt, and then
to the university’s tenure com-
mittee. Ultimately the decision

 

The P.E. Department

will be made by the Board of
Trustees.

Currently there is no one be-
ing considered for tenure in the
P.E. department.

Average salaries for the
1978-1979 positions at
Washington and Lee are $30,110
for professers, $23,488 for
associate professors, assistants
make $18,883 and instructors
take home $15,427. All figures
include fringe benefits.

Professors McHenry,
Richard Miller; associate prof.
Verne Canfield and assistant
prof. Jack Emmer share the ad-
ministration duties and titles.

In addition, Associate Direc-
tor of Athletics Miller coaches

class, P.E. 300 in Physical
Education and Health. Canfield
coaches basketball and also
oversees the intramural pro-
gram, and Emmer coaches

flyer, and to pay for extra
posters.

The flyer had endorsements
for Lowe’s candidacy.

Lowe said he helped plan the
party and put up the additional
posters with his tape, but added
that he did not pay for the addi-
tional campaign expenses.

EC President Steve Abraham
asked Lowe if he recommended
his friends make donations.

IFC Positions
Decided

Brian Gibson of Chi Psi was
elected Secretary of the Inter-
fraternity Council and Jamie
Hall of Lamda Chi won the
Treasurer position at the IFC
meeting Tuesday night.

John Snedden of Phi Delta

~ Theta was elected to the Senior

Justice position.

The two Junior Justice posi-
tions were won by Scott Dacus
of Kappa Sigma and Mark
McGlaughlin of Phi Gamma
Delta.

Alan Pyror of Pi Kappa Phi
won the Rush Chairman posi-
tion and Don Rigger of Delta
Tau Delta took the Social Chair-
man position.

Kevin Dwyer of Sigma Phi
Epsilon will be the Rush Book
Editor.

In other IFC business, frater-
nity house members were
reminded that checklists for
house inspection are due March
31 with spot inspections

See IFC, page 12

Lowe said he did not, tnat his
supporters asked if they could
help his campaign by throwing
a party.

He also told the EC that there
is no mention of donations in the
VRB rules.

The efficacy and clarity of the
VRB rules governing elections
caused a split in the EC debate.

Members of the EC who later
supported Lowe’s withdrawal
said the rules were clear
because of the rule’s spirit,

while EC members who voted to .

let Lowe remain in the election
said the rules are nebulous on
the point of contributions.

‘‘What do you think is the pur-
pose of the VRB rules?”
Abraham asked Lowe.

“So people will not go wild
with spending,”’ replied Lowe.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg asked VRB Chair-

‘man Robert Neely if there was

any room for misinterpretation
of the rules.
Neely said there was room for

Advances Into Runoff

misinterpreatation, * ‘in a small
way.

Neely defended the VRB rules
saying, ‘We wanted a fair elec-
tion and equitable effort for all
candidates.”’

He added that all candidates
were told to ask him if they had
questions about the rules.

The VRB Chairman said the
VRB’s 4-0 disqualifying recom-
mendation reached by Neely,
George larossi, Jeff Bartlett,
and Edward Gonsalves,
members of the VRB, meant
Lowe would not be allowed to
participate as a write-in can-
didate.

The other member of the
VRB, Toni Carli, could not be
reached in time to vote on the
matter.

But Abraham disagreed with
Neely, “if we struck Lowe’s
name from the ballot, he would
become a write-in candidate.”
And interpretation of the rules
caused a majority of the debate

Trouble In The Pit

by David Greer

After a rash of crowd control
problems at the Cockpit during
concerts the management has
affirmed that it will take
stronger action in the future in
dealing with customers who get
out of hand.

Student manager Mark Gin-
nevan said the Cockpit will en-
force its standing policy of war-
ning students who misbehave,
and that tbose who do not heed
warnings will be subject to ac-
tion by Student Control. If
necessary, police will be called.

During the Nighthawks show
two weekends ago, six students
were removed from the
Cockpit. Four left quietly when
accused of smoking marijuana ;
the other two were forcefully
removed.

Richard ‘‘Dyke’’ Wagner, a
1979 graduate, was found hiding
under a table between shows.
He refused to leave and
wasbodily removed. During the
altercation, according to
witnesses, Wagner attempted to

hit a doorman and the doorman
returned a_ punch,loosening
some of Wagner’s teeth.

Senior Andy Holds was asked
to leave while drinking a beer
between shows. He resisted but
finally complied. Later he ap-
proached Ginnevan and verbal-
ly abused him and grabbed him,
Ginnevan said. He was remov-
ed, the police called, and Holds
was arrested for being drunk in
public.

“Students don’t realize that
even though this is university
property it has to abide by state
laws,”’ Ginnevan said.
Nonetheless; the management
wants to try to handle any pro-
blems through the university.

“Student Control is aware of
the problem; anybody who does
mess up will be brought up
before Student Control,” Gin-
nevan said.

“If someone is found guilty of
causing trouble or of un-

Author Speaks Tonight

John Toland, widely known
historian and author, will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity tonight. His talk,
“The Rising Sun,”’ will focus on
his Pulitzer Prize-winning
history ‘“‘The Rising Sun: The
Decline and Fall of the
Japanese Empire, 1936-1945.”
Toland says ‘‘the speech
describes why I wrote the book,
how I researched it, and what I
found out — and what I’ve
learned since the book’s release
that hasn’t held up.”’

The lecture will take place at

p.m. in the Northen
Auditorium of the University
Library. All interested

members of the public are in-
vited to attend the program,
which is under the joint spon-
sorship of W&L’s Department
of History and the East Asian
Studies Program.

In addition to “The Rising
Sun,”’ Toland is the author of a
number of best-selling
histories, many dealing with
German themes. He first ad-

dressed the subject of Hitler in’

an account called ‘‘The Last 100
Days,’’ which was later made
into a motion picture. This was
followed more recently by the

   

Selling W&L

Stretching Statistical Truth

By Mike Perry

According to a pamphlet writ-
ten by the Washington and Lee
News Office for distribution by
the Admissions Office to pro-
spective students and high
school guidance counselors,
“more than 80 percent of our
freshmen stay until gradua-
tion.” This is an impressive
statistic, but depending upon
how it is interpreted, may or
may not be true.

If one interprets this state-
ment as an indication that
Washington and Lee has a 20
percent attrition rate (the
number of students who enter
as freshmen, but do_ not
graduate from W&L), among
its undergraduates, the state-
ment would seem to be not only
impressive but false.

In fact, the attrition rate here
as W&L has fluctuated over the

EC Postpones Reserve Fund Vote

By John Billmyre
The Executive Committee
decided Monday night during
its regular meeting to postpone

an amendment raising the
balance in the reserve fund
from $2,500 to $4,000.

The amendment will be
brought up next fall, probably
to be voted on as _ students
maticulate.

Originally the amendment
was going to be brought up
when students got their
schedules for next semester.

The amendment failed to pass
during the Big Three elections
because less than 50 percent of
the student body voted.

From now until April 21 the
EC will be accepting White
Book changes. EC Secretary

Cove Geary said the recommen-
dations should be typed.

The EC also voted that third
year law students should not be
allowed to vote in the EC
representative elections Mon-
day.

Candidates for the third year ~

position are:

Jeff Edwards, second year;
Bruce Meyers, first year;
Nathan Smith, first year.

Jamie Small, Chairman of the
University Center Committee,
was on hand to answer EC ques-
tions about ticket scalping.

Several freshmen complained

do so with the intention of retur-
ning to graduate and in fact do
so.

New York Sludge

How much sewage does New
York City produce each year?
About 10 million cubic yards, or
enough to fill the Empire State
Building 20 times.

Sewage has become a big pro-
blem for the Big Apple. For
over 50 years they have been
barging the stuff 12 miles out to
sea and dumping it into the
ocean in an area called the New
York Bight.

But last fall, the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency found all
sorts of nasty things in the
water around New York’s har-
bor and told the city they could
no longer use the Atlantic as its
septic tank.

The problem is that the city
has no other place to dump its
waste, which adds up to 8,300
tons every day. And the sludge
has cadmium (which is from
tires) in it, as well as other
dangerous bacteria. Cadmium
is a heavy metal and has been
linked to kidney and _ liver
diseases.

“The land on which sludge
compost is spread may never be
used for any agricultural pur-
pose whatsoever,’’ New York’s
Department of Environmental
Protection grimly concluded.

A fight is developing in Con-
gress on the future disposal of
New York’s sludge. In a stall

Hartog explains that the
desire of more college students
to ‘‘take a year off,” the strain

of reasons why
students leave W&L which are

80 percent of entering freshmen

degrees.

GRE Answers Available

PRINCETON, N.J. — Nearly
40,000 students throughout the
world who took the Graduate
Record Examinations Aptitude
Test on Jan. 12 can now obtaina
copy of the questions used in
that test and a list of the correct
answers.

The Graduate Record Ex-
aminations Board, which spon-
sors the test, released a 40-page
booklet containing the questions
that were counted toward the
actual scores, a list of correct
answers, instructions for ob-
taining “raw” scores and a
table for finding scaled scores
reported for the test. The
booklet also includes a descrip-
tion of the test and explanations
of the kinds of questions asked.

The booklet costs $2 per copy.
For $3.50, examinees can also
obtain a photocopy of their
answer sheet.

The release of test questions
and answer sheets meets the re-
quirements of the New York
State Admissions Testing Law
of 1979, which went into effect
Jan. 1.

The law requires that ques-
tions and correct answers for
any standardized test used in
connection with admission pro-
cedures to colleges and
graduate schools be made
public shortly after the test is
administered to students in
New York State. Students who
take the test in New York State
may also obtain a copy of their
answer sheet.

A booklet containing the ques-

tions and answers used in the
April 26 and April 28 GRE ad-
ministration will be available to
anyone after July 1.

LSDA Delay

Shortened

PRINCETON, N.J.—Law
School applicants are advised
that the eight-week delays in
processing Law School Data
Assembly Service (LSDAS)
reports, caused by the late
delivery of a new computer
system, have been reduced to
two weeks — the level ex-
perienced in the past at this
time of year. ;

Because earlier delays slow-
ed the decision process in some
law schools, the Law School Ad-
mission Council, sponsor of the
LSDAS, has recommended that
the earliest deposit deadline
date of law schools be extended
from April 1, 1980, to May 1,
1980. Individual law schools,
however, determine their own
deadline dates.

As an additional measure, the
LSDAS has also asked law
schools to verify that each
school has all the information
from the LSDAS necessary to
complete its admission deci-
sions for the year.

Students who are faced with
specific problems involving
LSDAS reports are asked to
write to Law Programs,
Newtown, Pa. 18940.

Edgar W. Spencer, head of
the geology department at
Washington and Lee Universi-

grant from the Petroleum
Research Fund of the American
Chemical Scciety to support his
geological research in the Blue
Ridge area.

The grant will enable Spencer
to carry out research primarily
during the coming two sum-
mers. His goal is to construct
‘“‘detailed geological cross-
sections showing the mineral
composition in the region’”’ he
said — data that will be ‘“‘of
great use” in petroleum ex-
ploration.

Oil firms have begun to show
an interest in western Virginia,
purchasing mineral rights at $1
to $5 an acre on speculation.

Spencer said an area through
the James River gap and
another area further south,
near Buchanan, will be the prin-
cipal points of focus of his
studies.

W&L will be the project’s
headquarters, and several
undergraduates with ex-

Spencer.

A 1953 graduate of
Washington and Lee, Spencer
returned to the university as a
teacher in 1957, the year he
received his Ph.D. from Colum-

head in 1959. Spencer has par-
ticipated in research projects in
such places as New Zealand,
Australia, Tasmania and the
Beartooth Mountains of Mon-
tana — where his eye-witness
account of a famous earthquake
evolved into a detailed scien-
tific report of the phenomenon.

He is the author of numerous
college geology texts, including

Lively ‘Pippin’ at Troubadour

By Paul Hendry

Playing at the Troubadour
Theatre till Saturday, March 29
is PIPPIN — the play made
famous by Bob Fosse on the
Broadway stage. The intimate
and electric theatre experience
awaiting all members of the
W&L community each season at
the ‘‘Troub”’ is too often passed
over by far too many students.
This week everyone has the op-
portunity to see the W&L
University Theatre in an am-
bitious and lively performance
of a rather unique, and at times
bizarre, ‘‘musical comedy.”’

Pippin, the son of
Charlemagne, is a young col-
lege grad (out of Padua in
Medieval days) loose in the big
wide world on his own for the
first time, and he has his heart
set on finding ‘‘it’’ — the fulfill-
ment of life. His various en-
counters and disappointments
stretch the plot to its
philosophic conclusions.

The Opening is one of the
strongest and most polished
scenes, an exotic and erie mo-
ment that is slickly directed,
and it serves as a fine introduc-
tion to the dream-like world of
the theatre that the play con-
sciously depicts. The hypnotic
power and excitement of the il-
lusion of the stage is well em-
bodied from the outset.

The lighting is used for
tremendous effects throughout

the show, especially in the
Opening and the “‘orgy”’ scene.
The play is easily racey enough
to keep any all-male population
entertained. The music, which
is faciliar to many, is
memorable and engaging from
the start.

The audience immediately
meets the intrusive Leading
Player, who is performed with
distinction by David Sorrells.
His enthusiasm generates
brightly on stage, and his lively
singing and dancing are the
highlight of the show. The
character serves as moderator
of the action as well as com-
mentator.

Art Dunnam is equally

likeable in the title role. His -

Pippin is properly confused yet
strangely self assured in the
whirlwind of encounters he
undergoes. Both Sorrells and
Dunnam maintain a relaxed
closeness with the audience that
is essential in such a small
theatre.

Richard Boaz’s Charlemagne
proves to be one of the crowd’s
favorites, as do the characters
played by Ginger McNeese,
Robert Shuman, Rose Gordon
and Penni Westbrook. The rest
of The Players do admirably,
playing multiple roles and ad-
ding many of the audience’s
favorite comic touches.

What makes PIPPIN most
enjoyable is its music and the

effervescent quality of its grand
production numbers. Sorrells’s
Leading Player makes keen
enough spectacle alone in the
Opening or when teamed up
with Pippin in a number like
“Right Track.”

Some of the most memorable
and amusing moments are the
larger scenes that involve most
all of the Band of Players. ‘‘War
is a Science’ and any one of a
number of moments from Pip-
pin’s pastoral interlude in
which he encounters the
pleasures of the flesh and a
secularized existence stand out
for their sheer ability to please
the audience.

The Finale is as powerful as
the opening, only instead of ask-
ing ‘‘what am I seeing?”’ the au-
dience is forced to examine the
question “what have I seen?”’
The ending is very dramatic
and philosophic, and the —_-use
of the rear screen projection of
Medieval art works is both
creative and effective within
the simplistic set that allows the
imagination to roam more free-
ly.

The choreography and music
combine for entertainment that
keeps the audience happily in-
volved, especially in the larger
production numbers. Warning:
PIPPIN is more than a stan-
dard musical comedy. It is an
out of the ordinary theatre ex-
perience well worth enjoying.

Film Notes————

Young Frankenstein (1974)—Mel Brooks’ talent has never been
as evident as in this send-up of horror movies, full of excellent ver-
bal and slapstick humor. It is a visual tribute to the 1940’s film mak-
ing it satirizes; the softly-lit black and white settings in Tran-
sylvania evoke a dormant genre. The familiar surroundings make
sharper the parody of the ancient monster story, and Brooks
couldn’t have directed a funnier cast: Gene Wilder as the young Dr.
Frankenstein (pronounced “Fronkin-steen) ; Madeline Kahn as his
obnoxious fiancee; Peter Boyle as the monster; and the incredible
Marty Feldman as Eyegore. They are assisted in their efforts by
Teri Garr and Cloris Leachman as the equine hag Frau Bluche.
Gene Hackman does a cameo in perhaps the film’s funniest se-
quence as a blind old peasant serving the monster soup. Brooks and

Wilder wrote the script. Presented by the SAB Friday through Sun-\-
day, March 28th-30th in Dupont Auditorium at 7 and 9 p.m. Admis-
sion is $1.

Bread and Chocolate (1978)—Highly reputable comedy by the
Italian director Franco Brusati. A discussion of which appears in
this issue of the Ring-tum Phi. Friday and Saturday at 8:00 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall. Admission is free.

Hester Street (1975)—Joan Micklin Silver directed this
meticulous, thoughtful account of the travails of Jewish im-
migrants in Manhatten’s lower east side in the late 1890’s. The
highly competent cast includes Steven Keats, Doris Roberts, and
Carol Kane, who received an Academy Award nomination for her
performance. To be shown in Reid 203, Tuesday April 1st, at 7 and 9
p.m. Admission is.free.

ty’s duPont Gallery beginning
this week as part of W&L’s an-
nual studio class spring exhibi-

months of work by dozens of
Washington and Lee art
students.

The exhibition will continue
through Friday, April 11, and
may be viewed each Weekday
from 9 to 4 at no charge to the
public. In addition, W&L’s
department of fine arts will
sponsor a reception in honor of
the student artists this Friday

Tuesday (April 1) in
honor of the Jewish Passover
holiday — a premiere presenta-
tion of the newly released radio
documentary ‘‘Rozhinkes Mit
Mandlin” (‘‘Raisins With
Almonds”’), an evocation of two
thousand years of Jewish
culture.

The program will be broad-
cast twice by WLUR in conjunc-
tion with the first day of the
Passover season, from 9:30 to
11:30 a.m. and again from 9 to
11 p.m.

Film Society Presents ‘Bread and Chocolate’

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present as_ its
seventh film of the 1979-80
season Franco’ Brusati’s
brilliantly skeptical and pro-
found comedy Bread and
Chocolate (Italy, 1978). Show-
ings are scheduled for Friday
and Saturday, March 28 and 29,
at 8 P.M. in classroom ‘‘A”’ of
Lewis Hall, free of charge.

Bread and Chocolate won the
New York Film Critics Award
as the year’s Best Foreign
Film. Brusati, with Ermanno
Olmi (The Tree of the Wooden
Clogs), is one of the Italian
directors whose work has
recently become highly visible

in this country.

The movie centers around the

mishaps of an Italian migrant
worker who is trying to earn in
Switzerland the meager living
he cannot make in his own coun-
try. The comedy arises from the
clash of national tempera-
ments, Italian warm-
heartedness and sweaty sen-
timentality against Swiss
refinement and neatness. The
hero is a swarthy misfit in a
world of prospering and
fastidious blondes.

‘Ethnic identities are
developed in a series of brilliant
scenes: the hero urinating on a
Swiss park wall, a crime for
which he is to be deported,

while the apprehension of a
Swiss child murderer causes
barely a ripple because his
crimes don’t violate the park’s
beauty or the sense of public
propriety; the hero dyeing his
hair blonde in an effort to fit in-
to Swiss society by denying

even to himself his Italian iden-

tity; and the widely praised
Rhine Maidens scene in which
the hero watches through the
windows of his chicken-coop-
home, the blond, elegant
children of the wealthly bathe
naked in a nearby stream.

The movie’s refusal to
simplify the appeal and the
liabilities of either national
temperament raises the treat-

Music Review

‘Cretones,’ ‘Urban Verbs,’ etc.

By Mark Kinniburgh

The new music piles up so quickly at the beginn-
ing of a'year and it gets difficult to sort out the gar-
bage from the worthwhile releases. Maybe a quick
look at a few very new and not-so-new artists and
the products of their latest efforts.

Cheers to The Cretones, from California, for
their latest release at the hands of Ronstadt’s good
friend, Mark Goldenburg. The most powerful ver-
sion of ‘‘Mad Love’ can be found on the Cretones
album, along with two other songs which made it
on Linda Ronstadt’s ‘‘Mad Love’ LP. The
Cretones have retained all the rock ’n roll that was
forgotten on ‘‘Mad Love,”’ A good 2.7 ona 4.0 scale.

Also cheers to go The Urban Verbs a new wave
band from Washington, D.C. featuring the brother
of Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz, Roddy.
Lyrically, the Verbs are a mixture of the B-52’s
and Tom Waits, both bizarre and very meaningful.
Musically, the Verbs provide a foil for Roddy
Frantz by blending synthesizer, guitar, and heavy
percussion into a very listenable collage. 2.5 on a
4.0scale.

“Best of the Week”’ award goes to The Motors an
English rock duo famous until now only through
imports and very select distribution by their
parent record company, Virgin Records.

At first listen, the music sounds like Blondie
with a male vocalist, but given a little time, The
Motors prove that Blondie lyrics are third grade
compared to the Motors skillfully poetic construc-
tions. This album will be big on radio by the sum-
mer, and a single is being released this spring for
national distribution. 3.25 ona 4.0 scale,

‘Keep your wallet in your pocket” award this

week goes to Ron Goedert probably the ugliest
man (or whatever) to ever wear stretch pants, (in
pink no less). Goedert attempts to sound like Van
Halen, but comes out to a big idiot that would lose
a junior high school talent contest. The worst joke
about the album is the blatant idiotic appeal of the
songs, all of which approximate, ‘‘hey there high
school baby, hop in my truck, let’s drink some
beer, and then we’ll ahhhh!!. Rate it a 0.7 on a 4.0
scale.

Another waste of vinyl this week is the Currie
Sisters debut album entitled ‘‘Messin with the
Boys,”’ The only thing the Currie Sisters have go-
ing for them is their looks, but even that can’t
make up for their severe talent deficiency. These
so-called vocalists are backed up by the Acme of
Los Angeles studio musicians, and thinking about
it, those musicians must be extremely embarrass-
ed to have done such a rotten record. I guess they
got paid. Rate it a 1.0 on a plus 4.0 scale (for their
looks. )

Notes: New Dead album due in mid-April... The
African jazz band in the Dining Hall this Friday
will really impress you — good stuff...Van Halen
will release “‘Women and Children First’’ any day
now...

Robert Fripp’s latest is going to be amazing and
called “Under Heavy Manners/God Save the
Queen”’ it features live tracks from last year’s
tours... Jeff Lorber Fusion is working on a new
record that is slated for release in early April...If
anyone knows where Bruce Springsteen’s new
album is, please call him in Asbury Park. He lost
it last December and hasn’t been able to find it
since. Listen to WLUR-FM.

ment above simple cliche,
although in the case of
Switzerland, in particular, the
treatment ‘is so shrewdly
caustic that it is a wonder the
Swiss government hasn’t sued.
Because of the way in which
ethnic value are balanced, the
hero finally becomes a man
without a country emotionally
as well as politically.

The Film Society will show
two films in the spring, Peter
Weir’s mystery Picnic at Hang-
ing Rock (Australia, 1977),

Generals Now Ranked Fourth In Nation

Washington & Lee’s 13-10 win
over North Carolina State,

coupled with upset defeats of.

Maryland and Navy, vaulted
the Generals into fourth place in
this week’s lacrosse poll.

The Generals, who had been
ranked sixth in the previous
week’s ratings, also won their
third straight game last Mon-
day afternoon, routing the Air
Force Academy on Wilson field,
20-6.

On Saturday, while the
Generals were collecting win
their victory over the Wolfpack.
both Maryland and Navy were
upset on their home fields.
Maryland was edged by
Rutgers, 9-8, while Navy was
defeated by Syracuse, 11-8.

In this week’s poll, Johns
Hopkins remained the toprated
team, while North Carolina,
ranked fourth in the previous
week, moved into the second
spot. Rutgers moved up to the
third spot, as opposed to its No.
8 ranking the week before.

Meanwhile, the Generals
moved into the No. 4 spot, ten
points ahead of Mayland.
Following Maryland are: Cor-
nell, Syracuse, Virginia, Navy,
Army, Massachusetts, Hofstra,
Towson State, Brown and North
Carolina State.

Though the scores of the N.C.
State and Air Force games dif-
fer, a similar pattern can be
seen. In both games, the
Generals got off to quick leads
in the first few minutes of the
first and second quarters.

Against N.C. State, the
Generals relied on a strong first
half and then held off a
Wolfpack rally in the closing
minutes. Leading the Generals
was attackman Chris Kearney,
who had his usual three goals.

But the Cannon Award for
player of the game went to mid-
fie, midfielder Geoof Brerit. The

 

   

lanky middie provided strong
ball-handling all afternoon as
he was one of the quarterbacks
of the Generals’ swing offense.

Behind the scoring of
Kearney and the strong defense
of Bob Clements, Jim Herbert
and Steve Johnson, the
Generals rolled to an imposing
10-3 halftime lead. Senoir Jay
Foster scoring in the opening
seconds of the game, indicating
it would be a_ high-scoring
game.

But if the first half belonged
to the Generals. then the second
half was a little too close for
comfort. N.C. State was able to
pull within two goals at 10-8, but
the Genrals defense did an ex-
cellent job clearing the ball in
the closing moments.

The victory did have one

half. Staugaitis did not even suit
up for Monday’s contest.

And against Air Force,
Staugaitis was really not need-
ed. The Generals ended any
doubt as to the outcome in the
first six minutes of the first
quarter, scoring six goals to
take a 6-0 lead.

It would have been more than

game at that point.

Some Sports Thoughts Between

By Bill Whalen

Here we are in the middle of
sports seasons. The NCAA has
concluded its longest basketball
season ever, the NBA is about to
begin its three-month odyssey
called playoffs and baseball is
or is not around the corner.

Here are some thoughts I’ve
compiled over the past few
weeks:

—Isn’t it impressive that the
W&L baseball team is at .500 so
far this year. Trivia question:
when did a W&L baseball squad
last finish at .500 or better?

—The Boston Celtics may
have the first pick in this year’s
NBA draft. Will the Celts take
the best bag man in the country,
Joe Barry Carroll, or will they

announce that they have signed
Ralph Sampson? Will they do
the unlikely and select Dr.
Dunkenstein, a.k.a. Darrell
Griffith, or will they pick a
sleeper like Roosevelt Bouie?

—The 1980 baseball season
may or may not get under way
thanks to a notion by the
players that they aren’t paid
enough. Don’t get me wrong, I
think arbitration is wonderful.
In fact, the next time I get a low
grade, I’m going to get Marvin
Miller to argue my case.

—My favorite hockey team,
the Washington Capitals, is
‘“‘marching”’ to the playoffs. Ac-
tually, 16 of 21 teams in the NHL
can qualify for the playoffs.
Talk about an elitest society.

—My favorite basketball
team, the Washington Bullets,
is also ‘‘marching’’ to the
playoffs, according to the pro-
moters. The Bullets haven’t
been at the .500 level since the
season was a month old. Big
joke trying to accept the theory
of sub .500 teams qualifying for
a postseason spot.

—Speaking of he who laughs
last, isn’t it amusing that CBS
has scheduled all of its late-nite
NBA telecasts to include the
San Diego Clippers. Un-
fortunately for CBS, the Clip-
pers are minus the services of
both Bill Walton and Lloyd Free
for the rest of the regular
season.

—Have any of you seen the
cola ad which features the
Olympic goalie, Jim Craig?
Talk about cornball! I could
handle Mean Joe Greene slugg-
ing down a soda after getting
beat up and then giving his
jersey to some kid, but the
Craig ad goes overboard.
Maybe I’m just having a
delayed reaction to an overdose
of the Winter Olympics.

—Speaking of the Olympics,
wasn’t it amusing to see the
European countries vote
against Carter’s boycott? The
best idea I have heard yet is for
the American team to par-
ticipate in the games but not be
present at either the opening or
closing ceremonies,

 
 
 

Wood each had three tallies to
lead a blaanced scoring attack.

The game was so lopsided at
the end of the first quarter (it
was 8-1 at the time) that Coaeh
Jack Emmer pulled starting
goalie Bob Clements and
replaced him with sophomore
Ware Palmer.

By halftime, the score was
14-1 in favor of W&L and a ma-
jority of the 1300 people on hand -

decided to they had had enough.

Using mostly second and third
string units, the Generals still
outscored the Air Force 6-5 in
the second half.

With a perfect record and two
of the season’s tougher op-
ponets already disposed of, the
Generals are in prime position
to gain an NCAA playoff berth.
Even more important to the
team is keeping the
psychological advantage of be-
ing in one of the top four posi-
tions.

If the playoffs were held to-
day and positions were decided
by ranking, the Generals would
be at home against Maryland. A
No. 4 seeding in the playoffs
would make possible an en-
counter with the top-seeded
team in the semi-finals.

But from the three games
already played, several pat-
terns can be seen in this team.
For one, the Generals are one of
the best first half teams in the
country. The Generals are
outscoring their opponents 16-5
in the first quarter and 13-3 in
the second quarter.

Such weak points as face-offs
and clears have also been fixed.
The Generals are clearing ap-
proximately 70% of their clears.
In the face-off department,
John Hooper is winning 60% of
his attempts and freshman
Craig Albanese has won 73% of
his face-offs.

See LAX, page 9

Seasons

—Here’s a trivial note. The
North American Soccer League
begins its regular season in a
few days. The NASL is one of
those leagues that you never
notice until the season is about
half over. Then you wish you
had never noticed it.

—One final note. Talk about
turn-about fair justice. Looking
at this week’s lax poll, you will
see our own Generals at the No.
4 spot. They’re ahead of such
heavyweights as Navy, Cornell
and Maryland. More important-
ly, they will play the current no.
2 and 3 teams here in Lexington
later in the season. Wouldn’t it
be interesting to have a playoff
game at Wilson Field?

Netmen Drop Three To Strong Opponents

By Dale Park

The W&L varsity tennis team
has certainly not been taking
the easy way out lately, facing
three tough Division I teams in
their last three matches.

On Wednesday, March 18,
W&L lost a close match to
James Madison University, 5-4.

The Generals dropped the
first three singles flights to
Madison. Senior co-captain
Stewart Jackson was downed
by his first singles opponent 6-2,
6-4, while his teammate,
freshman Jackson Sharman,
was upended 6-3, 6-3, at the se-
cond position. W&L junior Peter
Lovell, playing third, lost a
tough 7-6 first set, and sueccumb-
ed in the second, 6-2.

Yet W&L rebounded to take
the next three singles. Steady
senior co-captain Dave Con-
stine dropped his opponent, 7-5,
7-5 at the fourth spot and
freshman Steve Denney con-
tinued to have a fine early
season, winning 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 at
fifth singles. At flight-six it was
junior Doug Gaker in a close
5-7, 6-2, 6-4 triumph that evened
the score at 3-3.

At the first doubles, however,
senior Jack Norris and Jackson
dropped a close 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 deci-
sion. Madison clinched the
match with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory
over Gaker and Lovell and the
second spot, Still, W&L’s Con-
stine and Sharman closed out
the scoring with a solid 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 win at third doubles.

 

Baseball Evens
Record At 2-2

By Chris Sisto

It appears that this year’s edi-
tion of the Generals’ baseball
‘team is beginning to break with
some of the dubious traditions
that have plagued W&L teams
in the past.

Last week the Generals had a
2-1 mark and_ established
several firsts. It was the first
time ever that the Generals
beat Randolph-Macon College;
the first time in four years that
a relief pitcher came in and won
a game for the team and, for the
first time in a long while, the
defense went two games in a
row without committing an er-
ror.

The Generals began the week
with a 9-5 win over ODAC oppo-
nent Bridgewater College.

This time the team got
several clutch hits while com-
ing from behind by scoring one
run in the eighth inning and
three in the ninth. Vic Shepherd
went six innings on the mound
for the team and Joel Weston
came in to pick up the first
relief win since the 1976 season.

Head Coach Chuck Kroll said
the win was ‘‘very significant
for us. It was our first ODAC
victory and it was accomplish-
ed by a total team effort.”’ Kroll
pointed out that the team had 14
hits by more than six players.

Last Sunday, the Generals
opened their season at home by
splitting a double-header. W&L
took the first game 2-1 and then
dropped the second game 6-2.

Chip Chiles went the distance
to pick up the win in the first

game, surrendering only two
hits. The game was won in the
last inning when Mark Car-
duner drove in the winning run
with a sacrifice fly.

In the second game, the
Generals started off well when
leadoff hitter Chris Cavalline
homered. In the second inning,
Jeff Haggerty slugged his se-
cond home run of the season
with none on.

But then the team gave up
four hits and committed three
errors, while giving up two runs
in both the sixth and seventh in-
nings.

For the moment, the
Generals are 2-1 in ODAC play,
(2-2 overall) and will next face
Emory & Henry in an away

On Thursday, March 19, the
Generals were at Richmond.
Despite good performances by
most of the team, W&L lost
another close one, 6-3.

Jackson, playing at the first
singles, easily dispatched his
opponent, 6-4, 6-2, while Gaker
walloped his man, 6-4, 6-0, at
sixth. Denny finally fell at fifth
singles but not without a fight,
losing 3-6, 7-6, 6-1.

Both Sharman and Lovell fail-
ed to get on track against tough
opposition. Sharman went
quietly, 6-2, 6-1, while Lovell fell
6-0, 6-1.

The Generals needed all three
doubles to win, yet Jackson and
Norris came up short in a tight

7-5, 6-3 loss at first doubles.

Though Gaker and Lovell breez-
ed to victory at second, 6-1, 6-2,
Constine and Sharman dropped
a pair of tie-breakers in a losing
7-6, 7-6 effort.

At Maryland on Sunday,
March 23, the Generals faced
their toughest Division I oppo-
nent yet. This time, the second
doubles team of Gaker and
Lovell, 7-6, 7-6 winners, were
the only Generals to come out
alive as the Terrapins speared
the Generals, 8-1.

At three positions, however,
W&L was able to take its op-
ponents to three sets.

Sharman, at second singles,
after winning the first set 6-3,
dropped the next two, 6-2, 6-0.
Lovell, at third, lost a tough 2-6,

6-0, 4-6 bout but had an outstan-
ding second set.

In doubles, Jackson and Nor-
ris went the distance before giv-

ing in, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
Although last Monday's
match against George

Washington was rained out, the
Generals are scheduled to play
six matches in seven days.

On March 26, W&L will host
Radford College. On the 27th,
the Generals will travel to
William and Mary.

From March 29 — April 1,
W&L will have four straight
home matches, against, respec-
tively, High Point College, the
University of Charleston,
Brown University, and the
University of North Carolina.

Kaplan, Alfano Are Leaders
As Golfers Survive Opener

By Kip Gordon

The Varsity golfers finally got
their season under way last
week, handing Longwood a

394-414 defeat on Thursday, and -

picking up a pair of victories in
a tri-match against Shepherd
and Bridgetown last Tuesday.

 

double-header. This is, of
course, if the weather holds out.

So far this season, the
Generals have had six of their
ten scheduled games rained
out. Kroll is disappointed about
all the cancellations saying,
“It’s too bad we can’t play more
games at this point in the

_ season. The players are really

enjoying the game this year.”’

Winning games does seem to
make people feel this way.

Rain dampened. the
Longwood match and perhaps
contributed to the inflated
scores. Sophomore Jim Kaplan,
unruffled by the weather, card-
ed a 75. Sophomore Bill Alfano
and Freshman Bert Ponder
brought in the only other scores
in the 70’s, shooting 77 and 78
respectively. Other scores in-
cluded an 81 by Senior Captain
Jerry Barousse, and an 83 from
Sophomore Titus Harris.

The tri-match against
Shepherd and Bridgewater
brought the Generals two more
easy victories, as the golfers
fired a 396 to Bridgewater’s 412
and Shepherd’s 453. Alfano took
the low honors, firing a 74 on the

Ingleside course in Staunton.
Rookie golfer Bert Ponder
again carded a respectable 78.
Barousse shot 80, while Junior
Steve Everette and Jim Kaplan
each shot 82.

Although the scores on the
whole have not been im-
pressive, they can at least in
part be explained by the less
than ideal weather conditions,
and the fact that the golfers
have yet to face challenging
competition. But their quality of
play thus far was summarized
best in Coach Buck Leslie’s
comment following’ the
trimatch victory; ‘It ain’t pret-
ty, men, but it’s a win.”’

EC Debates Candidate’s Overspending

(continued from page 1)
and preceded the write-in status
debate.

Secretary Cove Geary said
Lowe already benefitted from
his campaigning, and should be
disqualified for that reason.

EC Vice President Les Cotter,
who attended the meeting
despite the pain of a recently
broken nose, also favored dis-
qualifying Lowe because of the
rule setting meeting.

‘John Lowe has a respon-
sibility like any other can-
didate, a responsibility he has
not lived up to,” said Cotter.

Sophomore Representative
Jim Wenke opposed Lowe’s par-
ticipation in the campaign
because, ‘‘all the money was
spent on that campaign.”’

Junior Representative Bob
Willis asked Neely to read the
VRB regulations on spending.

After Neely read the regula-
tions Willis said, ‘‘the statement
was Clear that there was a $10
spending limit on the cam-
paign.”’

Although the rules governing
the election seemed clear to
several representatives, other
EC members said the rules
were unclear.

Blumberg disagreed with Cot-
ter and Geary that the rules
were clear and said the lack of
clarity caused the problem.

“‘T see this situation as a con-
sequence of not having the VRB
rules specific enough to work in
this case,’’ said Blumberg.

Abraham said, ‘‘I think the
rules say the campaign should
not spend more than $10.”’

Neely added that no rule
could cover every aspect of the
campaign.

“The fact that you passed a
rule that did not fit your needs
does not solve the problem of
the rule that you did pass,” said
First Year Law Representative
Sam Allen in response to Neely
and Abraham’s comments.

Abraham‘said the EC had to
decide what was fair for Lowe
and what was fair for the whole
election.

Nelson Ould and Bruce Poole at Sunday’s special EC meeting.

Allen brought the discussion
back to the rules and asked the
EC if it planned to regulate
what other people did for a can-
didate. .

“Maybe the specifics will
have to be spelled out,”
Abraham said.

Nelson Ould, Sophomore
Representative, also questioned
the VRB rules.

“‘We have rules here that do
not spell out what we mean,”
said Ould in reference to the
spending limitations.

“We or the VRB are at fault
for not specifically spelling out
the rules,”’ he added.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole agreed with Ould and pro-
posed a motion that the EC not
accept the VRB’s recommenda-
tion to disqualify Lowe from the
election.

debate and the sides had been

Bob Willis proposed the vote
on this matter by secret ballot.

(If one member of the EC re-
quests a secret ballot, the EC is
required to use it. )

But Allen and Poole opposed
using the secret ballot.

“If you use the secret ballot I
swear I will do it for every vote
for the rest of the year,” said
Allen.

“I agree, we have a respon-
sibility, people have to know
how we voted,” said Poole.

Willis withdrew his call for
the secret ballot. He said it was
obvious how he felt, but that he
wanted to protect other EC
members.

The vote to disregard the
VRB recommendation failed
46-1. Blumberg, Ould, Allen
and Poole voted in favor of the
recommendation Keesler,
Geary, Abraham, Cotter,
Wenke and Willis opposed it.

mund Schenecker abstained
from voting in this and on the
other three votes that night.

In a subsequent vote the EC
decided to accept the VRB
recommendation.

The second vote mirrored the
first, with the same four EC
members voting to keep Lowe
on the ballot, the same six mov-
ing he be withdrawn from the
race, and Schenecker abstain-
ing.

The EC did have a short
break in the action between the
first two votes as it decided
whether it needed a two-thirds
vote to strike a candidate’s
name from the ballot.

The central issue in the third
and fourth votes was if Lowe

should be allowed to run if he
violated the spending limit.

Several EC members said
Lowe should be totally dis-
qualified, but others said he had
become a potential write-in can-
didate since his name was taken
off the ballot.

It appeared the EC thought
another vote would give Lowe
the status of a write-in can-
didate.

The vote to do so stalled 5-5-1,
and it looked like Lowe was out
of the race.

But Blumberg pointed out the
EC had voted against one of its
own stipulations, “‘that a valid
ballot was one which is cast for
a student.”’

Allen, Poole, and Blumberg
said the privilege to vote in the
election belongs to every stu-
dent unless taken away.

So the EC voted again, this
time to take away Lowe’s right
to be a write-in candidate.

The vote failed 5-5-1, with
Ould, Poole, Blumberg, Keesler
and Allen voting to keep Lowe
in the race.

Abraham, Geary, Cotter,
Willis and Wenke voted to dis-
qualify Lowe.

Schenecker abstained from
the vote.

Neely said that in his opinion
the EC was trying to place
grades on different types of dis-
qualification.

The EC agreed, and deadlock-
ed again, leaving Lowe in a
position to run for the office.

WLUR Opera Schedule

Performances of old and new
favorites will be featured in the
final four weeks of Metropolitan
Opera matinee broadcasts,
heard each Saturday afternoon
on WLUR-FM, the Washington
and Lee University radio sta-
tion.

Giacomo Puccini’s popular
“Manon Lescaut” will in-
augurate this final Met series
next Saturday (Mar. 29) at 2
p.m. Singing principal roles in
this new version of the classic
tragedy will be soprano Renata
Scotto, tenor Placido Domingo,
baritone Renato Capecchi and
tenor Philip Creech. James
Levine will conduct. Opera
News on the Air and Texaco’s
Opera Quiz will be among the
various intermission features.

“Parsifal’’ will follow on
April 5, starting at 1 p.m. It is
the only opera.by Wagner to be
heard this season. And a long-
absent masterpiece will return

to the broadcast circuit on April
12 at 2 p.m., Mozart’s “The Ab-
duction From the Seraglio.”’ An
early work by the classical
master, ‘‘Abduction’’ was last
broadcast over the Texaco-
Metropolitan network in 1947.

Closing the Met’s 40th an-
niversary season of matinee
broadcasts on April 19 at 1 p.m.
will be the modern classic ‘‘Bil-
‘ly Budd,” composed by Ben-~
jamin Britten and _ initially
presented last season at the
opera house in Lincoln Center.
Based on the story by Herman
Melville, the opera had its
premiere at London’s Covent
Garden in 1951. Among its
several unique characteristics
are its absence of any love in-
terest and an exclusively male
cast, as well as its virtual
absence of arias and ensemble
numbers.

WLUR is at 91.5 on the FM
dial.

Overall, the team is showing
an incredible amount of depth.
Three players are in scoring
double figures and eight players
are averaging at least one goal
per game.

Leading the scoring parade is
Kearney, who is averaging
three goals per contest. At this
rate, he would come close to his
39 goal total of his freshman
year. Behind Kearney are
Staugaitis and Mike Pressler.

Pressler and Staugaitis are
typical of this year’s success.
Both players are replacements
for last years’ AllAmerican duo
of Jeff Fritz and Johnny Black.

So far, both Pressler and
Staugaitis have scored five
assists in a game. Like
Kearney, Pressler has 11
points. Staugaitis is the team’s
third leading scorer with ten
points.

On the average each coach
receives three to four courses a

has a full time teaching load
and teaches between six and
eight courses a semester. He
also is the head of the Rules

III sports. He is currently
finishing his term of office.

Lyles arrived at W&L in 1959
after playing professional
sports. His first year here he
coached freshman basketball,
soccer and baseball. 1977 was
his last year as soccer coach.

In late February of 1978, a
W&L student, also on the varsi-
ty baseball squad at that time,
went to President R.E.R.
Huntley to complain about the
condition and general attitudes
surrounding the baseball team.
He said he felt there was a lack
of respect for the sport within
the P.E.department itself and
cited one instence where an
employee at the gym made
derogatory statements about
the sport in front of the coach,
Joseph Lyles.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

EC Antics

A lot of editorial fodder from the student body Ex-
ecutive Committee this week. So much so that it’s
hard to know where to begin. Let’s start with next
year’s EC President Bob Willis.

During Sunday’s special emergency session to
remove John Lowe from the freshman ballot, Willis
requested a secret ballot on the first vote. Bob has
always been for justice and accountability in the past.
So we cannot say what motivated his request Sunday
for anonimity and his attempt to escape accountabili-
ty for his fellow EC members on an important and
controversial vote. Certainly, he must realize what
bad practice a secret vote would have been.

No one remembers, but a few years ago open
meetings were a big issue. The current EC President
championed open meetings and open votes so the

- students could see how they are represented. We hope
this tradition will continue next year, but it’s off toa
shaky start.

Then we have Ed Schenecker, the freshman EC
representative. Mr. Schenecker distinguished himself
this week for his indecisiveness. We had been
withholding judgment on the freshman rep., but his
incredible inability to choose his conscience on a
variety of issues is astounding.

Monday, he couldn't |
decide whether or not the |
EC should print forms so
that students could have
their class rank sent our
with their transcripts.
Not a particularly con-
troversial issue. The rest
of the EC favored this
scheme, but Ed
Schenecker  couldn’t
decide how he felt, so he 2
abstained. The next vote }}
was about making future
EC recommendations in :
writing so they will have
more impact. Again, not a very difficult topic. Ed had
trouble with this one too, but it passed without his sup-
port by an 11-0 margin.

The most serious situation was Sunday’s debate
over whether Schenecker’s fellow freshman John
Lowe might possibly be thrown off out of the cam-
paign. There were four votes in all: two concerning
taking Lowe off the ballot and two on whether Lowe
should be allowed to run as a write-in candidate. The
battle lines were drawn dead even with five who
wanted Lowe out and five who wanted to let him stay
in the race. But Ed, with the tie-breaking vote, abs-
tained again.

This was an issue of whether a fellow classmate
would be allowed to be a candidate for a position Mr.
Schenecker now holds—possibly one of the most im-
portant EC votes this year. Certainly one during
which the freshman EC representative should have
made his opinion known. It is unconscionable that he
did not vote on an issue as important as a candidate’s
eligibility.

(The real irony of Sunday’s EC meeting was that
although a majority of representatives thought Lowe
should be taken off the ballot for overspending his
budget, they gave him an additional $10 to finance his
run-off campaign just like everyone else. Fundraiser
anyone? )

Shower Still
Unexplained

Dear Editor:

The University administra-
tion is grateful to The Ring-tum
Phi for having brought the mat-
ter of the shower facility in Mc-
Cormick to its attention.

Neither Dean Atwood or any-
one in a position of responsibili-
ty can recall requesting the in-
stallation of a shower as a part
of the toilet facilities. It is cer-
tainly not our practice to pro-
vide bathing facilities in
academic buildings.

One can only speculate as to
how the shower became a part
of the renovation plans, for no
references to it are included in
the architectural conference
memoranda that trace the
development of the project.
Often in planning discussions
with architects there will be
facetious remarks, recognized
as such by all present, and
dismissed from further con-
sideration. It is conceivable
that a comment about a shower,
made in jest, was taken serious-
ly by the architects, became
part of the design, and was not
spotted here during later
review meetings.

The University has requested
its architects to study more
useful functions of the. space
now designated as a shower.

and Coordinator of
Physical Planning

Auditorium

Dear Editor:

In all my connection with
Washington and Lee, I’ve never
seen anything approaching the
consistence with which almost
everybody gets the name of the
auditorium in the new
undergraduate library wrong.
(Even my office used to be no
exception. But at least we have
learned. )

It is an understandable error.
Even the library itself made the
mistake not long ago in a widely
circulated memorandum. The
poster put up by the faculty’s
Glasgow Committee this week
has it wrong.

(The Ring-tum Phi routinely
has it right. But apparently
everyone assumes it is simply a
routine typographical error. )

The name is Northen.

Not as in the compass direc-
tion, northern.

name of the auditorium.

Call For

Reason

Dear Editor:

I should like to ask that any
readers who are advocates of
the philosophy of Objectivism
please contact me at 463-2725.

The philosophical vacuum in
which we presently live is
pathetic and stifling.

To any individual who
recognizes the absoluteness of
reality, the supremacy of
reason, the moridity of rational
self-interest, and the sovereign-
ty of the individual in society —
I extend an invitation to engage
in some valuable and all-too-
rare philosophical rationality.

Symbols Of Worth And Merit

There are few greater trivialities than those
signs by which we judge each other’s worth.

Ideally, a person should have a sense of his own
worth. Since each individual must determine his
respective values and standards, only that person
can really decide whether or not he has met his
own goals. Others will criticize and praise, but
ultimately it is a matter of personal reflection.

Yet, since we are notoriously social beings, we
are not satisfied with simply knowing privately
that we have answered self-imposed requirements
and limits. No, we must seek out rewards for our
talents and behavior in order that we may reap the
homage due us by society.

These overt symbols of our worth and merit take
on many forms. Acumen in financial matters is
rewarded by wealth and demonstrated by either
the subtlety or gaudiness in which one parades
one’s possessions. Success in academia is amply
proven by framed diplomas, admission into
credential fraternities, and little keys in one’s vest
pocket. Socially, one’s prowess is judged by the
quality and quantity of one’s consumption of
females and alcohol.

I really have no gripe against these quirks of
human nature. I strive just as mindlessly after

them as everyone else. In fact, no one really pays
attention to these things unless they are too pain-
fully silly. But because I’ve got some C-school
classes, and do not want to be showered with
abuse, I’m not going to get into specifics.

I do, however, have a suggestion. What we real-
ly need is someone to determine universal stan-
dards by which we can judge each other. As it
stands now, economically strapped academics
make fun of the Babbits of the business world
while the money moguls wonder aloud about the
subversives who teach all those subsidized
athletes.

What we need is the Wizard of Oz.

As he fully demonstrated with the Lion, the Tin-
man, and the Scarecrow, the Wiz knew which
rewards represented which qualities to our socie-
ty. All we have to do is ask the old guy to draw upa
master list with some form of graduated
equivilancy ratings and we’ll all be set. No one will
have to keep up with the Jones, run for resume
padding.offices, or make the honor role because
their ratings will already be set. Just check the list
and you'll know exactly how arrogant or humble
you can act.

Simple, huh?
 

E Commentary

By Richard Moss

As we have now passed two of the more
strategic primary states in our presidential selec-
tion process, Illinois and New York, it may be
worthwhile for a minute to sit back and reflect
upon that process.

Recent opinion polls and studies of voter
registration have shown that the percentage of
Americans who register as independents is grow-
ing steadily. If this tread continues, the studies
show, independents may soon outnumber Demo-
cratic and Republican party voters. Nowhere is
this increase more evident than in the campaign of
John Anderson, who has relied almost solely on
the independent and cross-over vote to strengthen
his campaign. We must ask ourselves what effect
this trend may have on our two-party system.

Obviously, if we reach the point where indepen-
dent voters outnumber all party voters, then we
must conclude that the two-party system is inade-
quate. It would no longer be representative of the
majority of the voters, and therefore would not be
a viable process for selecting the leaders of our
country.

We appear to be living today in a country whose
political needs are best exemplified by the term
“broker state.’’ There are thousands of special in-
terest groups, each assaulting our political
leaders for the purpose of attaining their own
goals. Nowhere is this more evident than on
Capitol Hill, where lobbying has grown into a
highly appreciated art form, although one of ques-
tionable . morality. This constant barrage of
special interests, many of which conflict, is, it
seems, becoming a strain which two parties alone
canoe bear.

 

ie

Thoughts On Our Political Process

For this reason, many voters may be faced next
November with a choice between two candidates,
neither of whom represent the voter’s particular
needs in selecting this nation’s chief executive.
While we have not yet reached the point where a
majority of voters are in this position, we must
consider its growth, and the effects that growth
will have.

In all likelihood, the effect will be a spiraling
growth of political apathy as the result of discon-
tent with the way our country is being run. When
faced with only two candidates at the end of the
primaries and party conventions, we find many
voters either not voting at all, or deciding upon the
“Jesser of two evils,” a phrase which has been
bandied about for the past 10 or 20 years in regard
to presidential elections.

Certainly, we will never be able to please all of
the people all of the time, but it would be hoped
that we could please most of the people most of the
time with our political system process. Indeed, it
must be so, otherwise the system would not and
will not work. Traditions (i.e. the two-party
system) are fine, and are necessary to calm the
volatility of our present age. However, a tradition,
when it becomes stagnant, when it no longer
fulfills the needs of the people, must be changed.

It may be feasible to organize a new party, to
utilize a multi-party system such as is in use in
some European countries, or even to have just one
election day. with many candidates and to do away
with the primary process. In any event, if this
trend continues, something must be done to
change the presidential selection process, or we
may be faced with more than just political apathy
and disgruntlement in this country. We must look
toward the future. -

SAB Bands And Pavilion Structures

Dear Editor,

Each year the Student Ac-
tivities Board discusses the
possibility of hiring a large
band for the party held on the
Thursday night before Fancy
Dress. Until two years ago, the
SAB had succeeded, bringing
large bands such as ‘‘The Four
Tops” and “Atlanta Rhythm
Section.”’

Unfortunately, this tradition
came to a screeching halt in ’77
when a fight erupted at a ‘‘Four
Tops’ concert on Thursday

night; the fight resulted in one
student having a bottle broken
over his face and the other leav-

The fight solicited a response
from the administration that
consisted of an unwritten ‘‘NO”’
to any more large bands play-
ing at the Thursday night party.
This “NO” forced the SAB to
literally turn away ‘‘Tavares’”’
the following year when they
would have played at the party
for a very cheap price.

portunities missed in the years
to come.

The year, following the ad-
ministration’s instructions, the
SAB hired two bands for the
Thursday night party that
would be playing again that
weekend at several frater-
nities; thus they were con-
sidered a smaller band.

If the administration’s
philosophy held true, less peo-
ple would be attracted to the
party, thus making it more safe
for those attending, and plus if
there was no beer served there
would be fewer intoxicated peo-
ple.

After one of the bands had
finished one of its sets, a mob of
people began moving for the
door; at the same time a few
people began trying to come in
the door. What resulted was a
shoving match between those
coming and going (about 20-40
people) for control of a small
door that seemed to be the only
exit. This was a much more
potentially dangerous situation
as has been demonstrated at a
“Who” concert in Ohio; so-
meone could have fallen and
been trampled.

Furthermore, inside the
pavilion there were so many
people that it was hard to
breathe.

Had something happened,
such as one of the gas heaters
caught on fire, it would have
taken a fatally long time to get
everyone out, plus the rush for
the door would have knocked
some people down and trampl-

Against Co-education

Dear Editor:

When Jack Willhite’s com-
mentary “Free To Choose”’ ap-
peared in the paper of March 13,
it was only to be expected that
the pro-coeducation camp
would be heard from on the
20th. One might have hoped,
however, that they could have
made a better response. All Mr.
Wilson could do was to mock
Jack’s clever approach, while
Mr. Clarke’s objections,
although more rationally based,
are somewhat flawed.

Mr. Willhite said just about
everything there was to say
about co-education, but several
points raised on the 20th
deserve to be answered. Mr.
Clarke does not believe that
there is much demand for
single-sex schools,
most of us are here at W&L for
other reasons — such as
academic quality. He also
believes that the academic
quality of a W&L education
would be improved by the addi-
tion of women to the student
body.

This strikes me as quite
strange. If people chose W&L
because of the quality of the
education, choosing it over hun-
dreds of co-educational schools,
might that either be a sign that:
a) the quality of education at
W&L is superior to that of
schools where women are ad-
mitted (perhaps because we do
not admit women) or b) Mr.
Clarke is wrong and people
chose W&L because it is all
male.

Of particular ludicrousness is
Mr. Clarke’s ‘‘other problem.”’
Perhaps students who have
spent most of their years in co-
ed schools would have some dif-
ficulty understanding what it
means to attend a men’s school.
Perhaps. Mr. Clarke chooses,

but that |

though, to forget that each year
about half of our incoming
freshmen come _ from
preperatory, not public,
schools, many of which are not
co-ed. These people know what
sort of a situation they are
entering and yet they enter it.
Could it be one which they like?

Something Messrs. Wilson
and Clarke ought to bear in
mind too is that any attempt to
change the basic structure of
the University is going to take
time. If W&L were to decide to
go co-ed, none of us here now
would still be here to see the
decision implemented. What
would have happened is that
some of today’s students would
have succeeded in imposing
their views on all of tomorrow’s
students.

W&L is bigger than any stu-
dent. I dare say that every stu-
dent finds something here
which he does not like. If the
school were to change each of
the things disliked by every stu-
dent, it would not be W&L, in-
deed it would not bear any
resemblance to W&L.
Therefore, let those who like it
here stay, while those who wish
to destroy W&L leave. Let’s re-
main, as Jack suggests, free to
choose.

And as for fewer intoxicated
people, the floor was littered
with masses of broken bottles
and cans; there was even one
car off the road before the party
started.

The administration’s philos-
ophy obviously failed this year;
you can’t keep people away
from the party, they are going

to fight.

What you can do is protect the
people attending, and this can
be done by providing a facility
with enough room to breathe,
serving beer in paper cups thus
keeping the broken bottles and
cans out which could seriously
cut someone and also be used as
a weapon. Providing a facility
with enough exits to prevent the
bottle-necking of people, and

IFC Voting Blocks

Interfraternity Council elections were held Tuesday night and a
specter, believed dead or gone, came back to haunt the body which
runs and adjudicates in fraternity affairs.

Nine of W&L’s 17 fraternities decided who would hold seven of
nine elected posts on the IFC. Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi
Kappa Phi, Zeta Beta Tau, Lambda Chi Alpha, Chi Psi and Kappa
Sigma formed a block and selected a slate of candidates to fill posi-
tions on the IFC.

In the past a ‘“‘Red Square’’ machine has elected its candidates,
sometimes to the detriment of other fraternities, and the inter-
fraternity system. Only an oracle or a mystic can say for sure what
type of job the persons elected by this ‘‘machine”’ will do.

But chances are the ‘‘non-Red Square” machine will serve the
same purpose the recently deceased ‘‘Red Square” machine did;
keeping its own people in office and out of trouble.

Maybe the new machine has more high-minded principles in its
sights, then maybe it does not. In either case, the problem remains
the same no matter which machine puts people in office; frater-
nites do not get the best man for the job when they vote in blocks.
IFC office-holders should be elected on merit, not fraternity affilia-
tion.

At least one non-Red Square fraternity was approached, given a
slate of candidates which included one of its members, and was
asked to join the new voting block. That fraternity refused because
it wanted to vote for the best candidates, not a block.

On a judicial body such as the IFC, experience is a necessity for
the members who listen and make rulings in discipline cases.

Yet one candidate, who has a year’s experience and has done a
fine job according to other Judicial Board members, will not sit on
the IFC next year. He is a member of a Red Square fraternity and
was subsequently excluded from the slate of candidates.

While experience on the IFC is valuable, so is experience within
the fraternity sytem. The block vote has placed juniors in two im-
portant positions, secretary and treasurer. Kappa Sigma is only a
colony with hopes of becoming a fraternity, yet it has a representati
ve. While Kappa Sigma’s man may prove himself competent, he
has not lived in a fraternity house or in the fraternity system for
very long. In terms of actual experience with fraternities, he is in
the same position as most fraternity sophomores who have only
seen a fraternity function from the inside for a year.

This year’s IFC faced a difficult, if not impossible task, it had to
revitalize an embattled and sagging fraternity system. And
because the IFC had a diverse and experienced group, it came
through shining. A good IFC has put fraternities on the path back
up to respectibility.

Next year will be just as crucial as the year past: fraternities are
making improvements, yet still have a long way to go.

The IFC must be instrumental in prodding fraternities along the
way, and you do not have to ask Syd Farrar just how difficult a task
it can be. But did we, the members of fraternities, really elect the
best candidates to represent and lead us? We should vote for can-
didates on their merit, experience and ability. Have we done this?

It might do well to remember that the guy you elected so your
fraternity brother could be on the IFC, might not be worth endur-

emergency.

 

These solutions would allow a
party to go on without en-
dangering anyone’s safety, but
where are these facilities.

Unfortunately, this is the
heart of the problem. In plann-
ing the large band parties
(other than Fancy Dress), the
SAB has found the facilities that
would fulfill these require-
ments, Doremus Gym, Evans
Dining Hall, and Wilson Field,
for the most part unavailable.

Not only do these facilities
have the necessary exits and
area, they also have the power
and changing rooms that larger
bands require. Then why can’t
we use them?

A special committee is con-
sidering the construction of a
new ‘“‘pavilion-style structure’
costing in the neighborhood of
$110,000. I would urge the com-
mittee to design the facility to
its maximum potential, within
reason, so it would be of max-
imum possible value to the
students.

The building should have the
space to handle large crowds
such as those at the Thursday
night parties before Fancy
Dress.

It should have adequate
bathroom facilities.

It should have four walls and
heat so it can be used all year-
around.

Finally, it should be able to
handle large bands, and for this
it needs 220 power and changing
rooms.

With these suggestions in-
corporated into the design of the

IFC

(continued from page 1)

scheduled for the next day.

IFC President Monte Briscoe
reminded houses that no parties
can be held Saturday night
because it falls within a week of
exams.

An IFC rule prohibits parties
within a week of exams.

 

building, it will be large enough
and have enough power to han-
dle the parties planned for
W&L’s major weekends. As
long as you are planning to use
this much money, you might as
well get maximum value out of
what you spend it on.

Unfortunately, the new
pavilion is still at least a year
down the road if approved; until
then I would urge the ad-
ministration and expecially Mr.
Darrell and Mr. McHenry to
work with the SAB exploring
various plans for the use of the
facilities without damaging
them.

After all, the facilities exist
for use by the students as long
as they are not damaged.

With the support of the

students and the help of Steve
Abraham and Bob Willis next
year, I am sure that a solution
can be worked out with the ad-
ministration that will enable the
students to safely use their
facilities for the larger bands.
This plan would enable the SAB
to create a social program that
fits the size and caliber of this
college.

Furthermore, I would en-
courage the quick and complete
construction of the new pavilion
as the best answer to this pro-
blem.

Finally, I encourage anyone
and everyone to voice their opi-
nion to the SAB or the EC and in
their letters to the editor.

Students Split
On Coeducation

by John Billmyre

According to a_ report
presented to the Executive
Committee Monday night, the
student body is split down the
middle on the coeducation ques-
tion.

The EC subcommittee on
coeducation decided the student
body is neither in favor of nor
opposed to coeducation.

Subcommittee members Jay
Blumberg, Les Cotter, Palmore
Clarke, Tony Carli and Robert
Neely were on hand to present
their report and make recom-
mendations based on the report.

But before they could make
suggestions, the subcommittee
answered questions from the
EC.

Senior Law Representative
John Fraser asked the subcom-
mittee about the second ques-
tion, ‘‘In your opinion, do you
know the advantages and disad-
vantages of coeducation at
W&L?”

“IT wonder whether you think
the second question is phrased
in such a way to ask someone if
they are ignorant,’ Fraser
said. ;

Blumberg said he did not
think so and added the commit-
tee worked with Associate Dean
of Students and Director of
Placement Michael A. Cappetto
to develop good, unbiased ques-
tions.

“IT am not sure if there is a
proper way to ask someone if
they know something,” said
Fraser.

Junior Representative Bob
Willis questioned the meaning
of the results from the second
and third questions.

He pointed out that 77 percent
of the people polled said they

knew the advantages and disad- ;
vantages of coeducation, and }
the same number of respond- |
ents said they would like to see ,
more public discussion of the 4

coeducation question.

Carli and other subcommittee
members said a correlation
could not be drawn between the
two question.

Before there were any more
inquiries about the questions
Blumberg reminded the EC
that they approved the ques-
tions earlier in the year.

“If the EC tells us the ques-
tions are bad, I am going to be
mad,’ said Blumberg. ‘‘We
brought them to the EC earlier
this year and they were approv-
ed.”
Fraser also asked about the
effect of the pollsters, adding
that Carli had already indicated
his preference for coeducation.

“There was one group . of
questionable answers, so I
made a second call to verify
them,” said Blumberg.

Carli said his answers were
the set which Blumberg review-
ed.

Fraser then proposed the EC

accept the subcommittee’s
report.

The motion passed
unanimously.

Law Student Arrested
After Walking Out Of Ted’s

By Guy Sweet

A legally minor altercation at
Ted’s Restaurant last Tuesday
night may result in drastic con-
sequences to the restaurant and
toa W&L law student.

The student, William
Nicholson, was arrested Tues-
day night by Lexington police
for failing to pay his bill at
Ted’s. In response, several law
students have said they plan to
boycott the restaurant.

This entire conflict developed
over a $2.35 spaghetti dinner.

At about 6:30 p.m. on Tues-

day, Mar. 24, Nicholson and a

fellow law student, Lester
Bates, entered Ted’s and
ordered dinner.

When Nicholson’s dinner ar-
rived, he said that it ‘tasted
funny,”’ and he told the waitress
to return the spaghetti to the
kitchen.

She gave the dinner to head

cook and owner, Ted Snyder. He -

tasted the spaghetti and said
there was nothing wrong with it,
so the waitress took the plate
back to Nicholson’s table.
Nicholson again insisted that

EC Coeducation Report

error, showed results to be ac-
curate to within plus or minus 2
percent. In other words, the
results contained in this study
approximate (to within plus or
minus 2 percent) those results
which would be found if the en-
tire student body were
surveyed. Simply stated, we
believe these results are highly
accurate and reflect the opinion
of the undergraduate student
body.

The respondents were con-
tacted by telephone’ by
volunteers who had _ been
carefully instructed on how to
ask these questions in an un-
biased manner. (See attached
form.) The three questions
state:

1) Are you in favor of
coeducation at W&L?

2) In your opinion, do you

know the advantages and disad-
vantages of coeducation at
W&L?

3) Would you like to see more
public discussion of this issue?

46.9 percent of those surveyed
were in favor of coeducation at
W&L, 49 percent were against
coeducation, and 4.1 percent
had no opinion on the matter.
The committee feels there is no
clear-cut majority on this ques-
tion. The student body is neither
for nor against coeducation.
Opinion is very evenly split
(Keep in mind the plus or minus
2 percent).

In response to the second
question, 77.9 percent of those
surveyed believe they know the
advantages and disadvantages
of coeducation; 15.2 percent feel
that they did not know the ad-
vantages and disadvantages;

6.2 percent had no opinion on
the matter; and 0.7 percent
refused to answer. The commit-
tee feels that there is a clear
distinction between the two
groups and concludes that the
majority of those sampled
believe they know the facts.

Finally, in response to the
third question, 77.1 percent of
the sample would like to see
more public discussion of
coeducation; 17.4 percent would
not like ‘to see more public
discussion; and 5.6 percent
have no opinion. The committee
concludes that a majority of
students would like to see more
public discussion of coeducation
and recommends that the Ring-
tum Phi use this report to begin
a coeducation forum.

something was wrong with the
meal and ordered a lasagna din-
ner.

Snyder prepared the lasagna
but told the waitress to bill
Nicholson for the spaghetti din-
ner because there was nothing
wrong with it. She did so and
later stated that Nicholson
never asked her whether he
would be billed.

Nicholson’s bill totalled
$20.51, including the spaghetti
dinner. Nicholson told the
cashier that he would not pay
for a meal that he did not eat.

Snyder, who was seated near
the cash register, approached
Nicholson and demanded the
full amount.

“I tried two or three times to
pay the undisputed portion, but
he (Snyder) insisted on ‘all or
nothing’,’’ said Nicholson. ‘‘He
also said that he was going to
swear out an arrest warrant if I
didn’t pay the full bill.”

Nicholson then walked out of
the restaurant at about 9 p.m.
At the urgings of Bates,
however, Nicholson wrote out a
check for $18.16 and left it on the
spike next to the cash register.
This check did not cover the
spaghetti dinner.

Immediately after Nichol-
son’s departure, Snyder went to
the Lexington Police Station
and swore out a criminal com-
plaint, charging Nicholson with
unlawfully procurring food
without paying and with intent
to defraud an innkeeper.

Progress Report On The Boxwood Incident

by John Hastings

The anger and frustration of
the ‘Boxwood Incident” has
passed and now students and
faculty are turning their atten-
tion to final examinations and
Spring break. The fate of the
students involved in the inci-
dent, however, is notso simple.

All seven of the remaining
students who were involved in
the December damage of
several boxwood bushes around
campus are each performing
eight hours of manual labor a
week in some form of campus
or community-related project.
Along with their labors, the
seven were also placed on
Social Probation for the re-
mainder of the school year and
on Conduct Probation for the
rest of their W&L careers by the

Student Control Committee.
One aspect often overlooked
in considering the punishment
of the students is that they are
responsible for repayment to
the University for the damage
of the bushes. According to Tim
Brooks, chairman of the Stu-
dent Control Committee, the
University’s lawyer has con-
tacted all the families involved
and repayment is being worked
out on an individual basis.
Recently six of the students
worked for the Historic
Rockbridge Society chipping,
priming and painting walls. A
spokesman for Historic
Rockbridge, Dick Fletcher,
spoke highly of their work and
was impressed by their good at-
titude. The seventh member of
the group was doing clerical

work at Stonewall Jackson
House.

Another ‘‘satisfied customer”
of the group’s efforts is Jerry
Darrell, who sent a letter of
commendation to Brooks when
the students cleaned Evans Din-
ing Hall after the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon.
The work was done from 2-6
a.m. in order to prepare for the
next day’s meals.

Another plan for their labor
calls for a cleaning of the cross-
country course, which came at
the request of Asst. Director of
Athletics Dick Miller. Also in
the works, says Brooks, ‘“‘is the
possibility of using them to help
clean the gym after Mock Con-
vention.”’ Brooks added that he
was working with Lexington Ci-
ty Manager John Doane to find

Toland Lives The Life Of A Writer

by Ed Edge

Talent is not the main thing to
possess if you are to write; you
must have the stubbornness and
willingness to live the life of a
writer, well-known author and
noted historian John Toland
said when he lectured in Nor-
then Auditorium last Thursday
night.

Toland was presented by the
East Asian Studies program
and the history department of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

Toland, who paid his way
through college by running the
campus book store and playing
bridge, told all those interested
in becoming writers not to get
upset if they are not immediate
success, adding that he did not
have anything published until
he was 42 years old.

“I wrote articles on anything
from impotency to...well, you
name it, and even dropped my
first wife before anything I
wrote was published,’ he said,
adding that dropping your first
wife is, by no means, the way to
gain success, even though it did
work for him.

After going through the files
of reporters to gain the informa-
tion for his work, and not being
totally satisfied with the ac-
curacy of the material he had
obtained, Toland decided that
he should resort to interviewing
the people who were actually in-
volved in whatever he was
writing on.

“I’m interested in the way
human beings are; other
writers have ignored humani-
ty,”’ he said and added, “The
people who were there are the

Plans Soon!

ones who know what happen-
ed.”’

Toland’s book, The Rising
Sun, came as the result of ex-
tensive interviewing in Japan.

Toland said he ignored any
advise offered him and followed
instinct in his research and in-
terviewing, and succeeded in
gaining the trust of a person
who led him to some buried
records that were believed to
have been destroyed.

“Once they found out that I
was seeking to tell the true
story of World War II Japan,
the Japanese were eager to talk
to me—the losers are easier to
talk to than the winners (who
write history ),”’ he said.

“Real fact is what I’m in-
terested in. I need to know the
plot of what I’m going to write
about,’ Toland said.

some area where the group
could be useful. Brooks has also
contacted TAP (Total Action
against Poverty), but has had
noreply.

The Student Control Commit-
tee has received many com-
pliments on their handling of
the affair, from President
Huntley on down. “Because of
the complicated facts and
pressure from the university
community,”’ said Brooks, ‘‘this

was one of the most difficult
decisions any Student Control
has ever faced. Since Student
Control was the only group with
all the facts, we tried to make
the same decision as would the
community if they had all the
facts.’’ Brooks added that at the
time of the incident, most peo-
ple he spoke with were in favor
of suspension and now most see
the committee’s actions as
“fair and reasonable.”’

Coeducation

(continued from page 1)
fraternity members attitudes
proved quite interesting. When
controlling for fraternity
membership we find the follow-
ing figures which show indepen-
dent students much more in
favor of coeducation than
fraternity member students ;

When the committee attemp-
ted to control for students’
class, the number of
respondents became too small
to report with any confidence,
but there appeared to be little
differences on any of the ques-
tions among the four
undergraduate classes.

There is basically one sugges-

tion that this sub-committee
would like to make: We feel that
the student body would like a
public forum on coeducation.
The committee would be willing
to organize a series of debates
on coeducation. These debates
would try to cover all aspects of
coeducation at W&L. Debate
would achieve two goals: It
would allow the 15 percent of
the student body who don’t feel
they know the advantages and
disadvantages of coeducation to
learn those aspects, and it
would also attempt to satisfy
the 77.1 percent of the student
body who would like to see more
public discussion of this issue.

Entertainment

 

 

By John Wells

Once again it’s time for tnat secular Hollywood
orgy of self gratitude: the 52nd annual Academy
Awards will take place on April 14th.

The nominations, announced last month, didn’t
seem to stir great surprise or jealousy among
stellar egos. The major contenders this year ap-
pear to be Kramer vs. Kramer and All That Jazz,
with nine nominations each, Apocalypse Now with
eight, and, to the delight of many, the low-budget
Breaking Away received five nominations.

A look at the individual categories:

Jane Fonda can safely be removed from con-
sideration since she won last year in the Best Ac-
tress category. The nomination may be con-
sidered a nod, and a deserved one, for there are
few actresses of her calibre in the mainstream to-
day. Marsha Mason and Bette Midler seem to be
long shots (particularly the latter, in my opinion).

It used to be considered normal in Hollywood for
an actor or actress to win an Oscar for a ques-
tionable performance out of sympathy for an
undeserved loss the previous year. (It happened to
Jimmy Stewart when he lost for Mr. Smith ).
Although belated recognition for Jill Clayburgh’s
An Unmarried Women would be nice, Starting
Over isn’t the picture and the tradition is dead.
I’m putting my money on Sally Field who had the
title role in Martin Ritt’s Norma Rae.

Dustin Hoffman seems like a shoo-in for Best
Actor; he was fine in Kramer, and has never won
before despite The Graduate and Midnight
Cowboy. Recent years have proved such criteria
unreliable, but Hoffman might be the exception.
Jack Lemmon deserves it for China Syndrome,
but he just won a few years back. Don’t count on
Roy Schneider or Al Pacino (yet). If Hoffman
doesn’t get it, it seems highly likely that Peter
Sellers will win for Being There.

The supporting categories are a mess: Meryl
Streep has received more praise lately than prac-
tically anyone and while she deserves it, it would
be nice if she held out for the big stuff in a year or
so. She may be cancelled out by Jane Alexander,
another fine actress, who was also nominated for
Kramer. Mariel Hemingway can act circles
around her mush-mouthed sister but she probably
won’t get it, and who even heard of Barbara Bar-
rie? Candice Bergen may be a banquet for the
eyes, but I hope to God she doesn’t win for Starting
Over.

The seemingly yearly lets-give-something-to-
an-old-timer ordeal this year concentrates on the
venerable Melvyn Douglas (Being There). Who
once co-starred with Garbo and Dietrich, and
Mickey Rooney (The Black Stallion) ,who replaced
Donald O’Conner in the Francis the Talking Mule
Series awhile back. Douglas has won before,

Rooney has not. If there is a stalemate between
these two, the most deserving winner would be

Robert Duvall for his work in Apocalypse Now. I
really don’t think Justin Henry should win simply
as a matter of principle, but he was exceptional in
Kramer VS Kramer. Frederic Forrest provides
feeble competition for The Rose.

It could be rough going for Best Picture.
Realistically, Francis Ford Coppola is a year late
for competition among Vietnam epics, and, not be-
ing a completely satisfying movie for all its chop-
pers and napalm, Apocalypse Now is more likely
to capture other, minor categories. Bob Fosse,
who deserted Hollywood years ago for the theater,
might expect the same for his highly exploited All
That Jazz (I mean, it’s so blatant). Norma Rae
didn’t even nab a Best Direction nomination for
Martin Ritt, making it an unlikely winner. This
leaves the highly praised Kramer in competition
with the equally highly praised Breaking Away
(the production costs for which were probably less
than the Cambodian mortician who supplied the
corpses for Apocalypse). A victory for either one
would be satisfactory.

It does seem a shame that Woody Allen’s
brilliant Manhatten received no more academy at-
tention than it did (probably because the Wood-
man won big with Annie Hall two years ago).
Many believe the academy underrated the widely

acclaimed Black Stallion, Shirley MacLaine’s per-

formance in Being There, and Barbara Harris’ in
The Seduction of Joe Tynan (how about Diane
Keaton in Manhattan?). Perhaps they thought
that they couldn’t nominate Ricky Shroeder for
The Champ because they already had one child
star and two senior citizens vying for Best Sup-
porting Actor.

It’s been years since any one picture has swept
more than five major awards, and this year it
again appears that awards will be apportioned
among several films. It’s important to remember
that The Turning Point and Heaven Can Wait got
something like 11 nominations, but both went
home on Oscar night empty-handed.

Fortunately for everybody concerned, Johnny
Carson will once again host the awards, broadcast
live from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los
Angeles. Last year Carson provided customary
wit and kept the intermittently dull proceedings
moving along smoothly. Dolly Parton is a schedul-
ed presenter this year, and I’m sure everyone will
enjoy her introduction by Johnny. It has been an-
nounced that a special award will be given this
year to Alec Guiness for his various contributions,
etc., to the industry (you’d think they could have
waited at least a couple of years after honoring
Laurence Olivier). Nominations for Best Song will
be performed in lavish production numbers.

So if you’re so inclined this vacation, on April
14th you can witness generations of luminaries
participating in a ritual of thrills, chills and excite-

Bernot Named
All-American

Mike Bernot, a Washington &
Lee sophomore, received All-
America recognition for his per-
formances in the 50 and 100
yard freestyle events at the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ship swim meet, held March
20-22 at Washington & Jefferson
College.

In both events, Bernot com-
peted in the consolation finals,
where he set school records to

go along with the All-America
Awards. The finals in each
event consisted of the top six
swimmers from the
preliminary competition; the
consolation finals consisted of
the following six swimmers.

Bernot’s award in the 50-yard
event came Thursday, March

field, he advanced to 10th place
during the preliminary com-
petition. In the consolation final
he turned in a time of 21.83
seconds, breaking the W&L
record of 22.00 set by Tad Van
Leer in 1977.

Bernot’s award in the 100-
yard event came Saturday.
Seeded 37th in a 54-man field, he
advanced to 11th place during

the preliminary competition. In
the consolation final he turned
in a 46.99 seconds clocking, the
meet’s top time in the event, to
break Van Leer’s 1977 mark of
47.81.

The W&L varisty tennis team
ended the month of March by
winning two of its last five mat-
ches as the netmen continued to
play tough Division I and II
competition.

On Wednesday, March 26th,
the Generals defeated visiting
Division II Radford College, 6-3.

Senior co-captain Stewart
Jackson got W&L off to a good
start with his 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory
at first singles. Both junior
Peter Lovell (third singles) and
senior co-captain Dave Con-
Stine (fourth singles) followed
suit.

Lovell trounced his opponent
6-2, 6-0,.while Constine breezed
to a 6-4, 6-4 win. The final
singles victory was registered
by junior Doug Gaker, who
went the limit in a decisive 6-2,

3-6, 7-5 victory at sixth singles.

The Generals needed to win
only one doubles to clinch the
match, yet came away with vic-
tories at the first and second
flights. Jackson and senior Pat
Norris teamed for a 5-7, 6-1, 6-2
win at first doubles, while
Gaker and Lovell had no trouble
in their 6-3, 6-3 triumph at se-
cond.

The following day the
Generals: were away against
William and Mary College.

Despite several close mat-
ches and wins by both Jackson
in singles and Gaker and Lovell
at secend doubles, W&L’s
netmen fell 7-2. Jackson, as in
the previous match, registered
an identical 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph,
while Gaker and Lovell squeez-
ed by their opponents 6-3, 7-6
(5-4 tie-breaker).

Generals Climb To 5-0;

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
Generals walked to their fifth
victory in as many games
Wednesday by defeating the
Virginia Tech Hokies, 24-3,
before a crowd of 1600 on Wilson
Field.

The Generals dominated their
first game on Wilson Field in
two weeks in every category.

With sophomore Ware
Palmer starting in the goal for
the first time this year, the
Generals took 73 shots com-
pared to only 19 for Tech and
captured an impressive 29 of 32
face-offs.

The loss dropped Virginia
Tech to 1-1 on the season. The
Hokies had earlier beaten
Randolph-Macon, 14-9.

The Generals leapt to a quick
9-1 lead in the first period, while
putting in every team member.
Geoff Brent started the scoring,
followed by Art Caltrider, but
Tech scored to cut the lead to
2-1. From the 9:03 mark down,
W&L went on a scoring spree
which resulted ih 19
unanswered goals to put the
lead at 21-1.

Midfielder Rob Carpenter
scored his first career gaoal
while Chris Kearney scored
four times and. Rob Staugaitis
and Mike Pressler each threw
in two.

It wasn’t until the third period
that Tech managed to score
again, one coming with 10:28
left in the third stanza and
another almost nine minutes
later. Both scores came on
extra-man situations.

But that was to be all for the
Hokies. Jay Foster scored the
last goal in the fourth quarter to
end the game at 24-3 in favor of
the Genérals.

The netmen were able to take
only two positions from the
visiting High Point College
team also, losing a 7-2 decision
on Saturday, March 29th. Again
it was Jackson who was one of
the Generals’ bright spots, as he
chalked up a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 win.
Gaker, at flight six, was able to
overcome his opponent, 6-0, 7-6
(5-4 tie-breaker ).

The visiting Division III
University of Charleston team
offered W&L a needed rest.

The Generals had no trouble,
sweeping the singles 6-0, while
dropping only one set. Winners
included Jackson (his fourth
straight win at first), freshman
Jackson Sharman at flight two,
Lovell and Constine at the third
and fourth positions, respec-
tively, freshman Steve Denny
at number five, and Gaker at

Washington and Lee now
leads the Tech series with five
wins and no losses. Leading
scorers in the game included
Kearney with four goals (he
now leads the team with 15
goals in five games), Geoff
Wood with four tallies and
Brent who netted a hat trick.

John Kemp, one of the
Generals’ leading midfielders,
did not play in the Tech game.
Kemp suffered a broken hand
against Towson State but will
return to the line-up against
Virginia on April 20.

Coach Jack Emmer_ was
again pleased with his team’s
performance, commenting:
“We wanted to look sharp
before the Spring break and
before we met Virginia.”

Well Jack, your team looked
just that.

State 11-7
The Washington and Lee
Generals extended _ their

undefeated record to 4-0 with an
11-7 victory over the Towson
State Tigers last Saturday at
Maury Park.

The victory came on the
strength of a fourth quarter ral-
ly in which the Generals out-

- scored the Tigers 5-1 with five

unanswered goals. The victory,
coupled with a Rutgers loss,
moved the Generals into third
place in the NCAA Division I
Standings, behind top-ranked
Johns Hopkins and_ second-
ranked North Carolina.

Towson State’s record drop-
ped to 1-2.

The Generals got off to a slow

sixth singles.

On the final day of March the
Generals nearly pulled off an
upset of Division I Brown
University at home, losing a
tight 5-4 bout,

Jackson finally succumbed at
first singles, falling in a close
3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5-3 tie-breaker)
match. But the combination of
Lovell at third singles and Den-
ny at fifth singles made it two in
arow.

The doubles were not played
due to rain.

Lovell rallied to whip his op-
ponent 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, while Denny
downed his man, 6-1, 7-6 (5-1 tie-
breaker). The netmen evened
the singles at 3-3 when Gaker
recorded his third consecutive
triumph at sixth singles, 6-4, 0-6,
6-3.

Yet Brown clinched the
match in the doubles. W&L was
able to win only at the second
flight, where Gaker and Lovell
continued to play superbly, win-
ning their third match in their
last four outings, 6-3, 6-4.

Baseball Team Keeps Winning Despite

By Chris Sisto

Bad weather continues to
hamper the Generals’ road to a
winning season this spring as
four consecutive games were
cancelled last week due to wet
grounds. This brings the total
number of rain-outs to nine
while the team has only been
able to get six games under
their belt.

Head Coach Chuck Kroll,
however, hasn’t been complain-
ing about the cancellations

since his team’s situation isn’t
unique in Virginia this year, but
he does feel it has hurt the
players. ‘“‘It is difficult to give
everyone a good look with the
amount of games we’ve played
and it’s hard for the pitchers to
get inasetrhythm.”

The team has proven so far
that it can rise above these set-
backs’ When the Generals have
played, they’ve given some
masterful performances, the
most recent being a double-

header sweep against ODAC op-
ponent Emory & Henry last
week.

The score of the first contest
was 2-1, and the Generals com-
pleted the sweep with a 7-0
shutout in the second game. It
was the first time in four years
that W&L has won both games
of a double-header and the first
team this year,’’ Kroll said, ‘‘is
that everyone is getting into the
act.”’

“There hasn’t been one per-

time since then that the
Generals earned a shutout.

Chip Chiles went the distance
on the mound in the first game,
picking up his second win. It
took extra innings to win this
game, however, as reserve out-
fielder Jody Harris drove in the
winning run in the top of the
eighth.

In the second game, Joel
Weston gave up only four hits
and the defense only committed

Weather

one error in serving the win.
“What’s different about the
son who has totally carried the
team this year,” said the
Coach. “The defense has im-
proved significantly and the
winning runs have come froma
number of different people.’’

The team is now 4-2 overall
and 4-1 in ODAC conference
play. Their next opponent is
Clarion State. The Generals
play eight games in eight days
during Spring break.

Generals 5-0 After Overpowering Hokies, 24-3

(continued from page 4)

ran up a 2-0 lead in a first
quarter characterized by less
than admirable play by both
teams. The Generals had trou-
ble clearing the ball with their
passing and trying to get shots
past the Towson State goalie,
Tim Hastings.

The Tigers lengthened their
lead to 3-0 at the outset of the
second quarter and seemed to
be taking command of the
game. But the Generals finally
got on the board with a goal by
attackman Jay Foster with
11:58 left in the half,

John Kemp then scored four
minutes later to put the
Generals only one goal down at
the half.

The third quarter was a see-
saw battle as the Generals had

to play catch-up most of the
time. Mike Schuler scored 30
seconds into the period to tie the
game at 3-all.

Three times in the period
Towson State took the lead by a
goal and three times the
Generals battled back to tie the
game, with two goals coming
from Foster and one from mid-
die Joe Olive to tie the game at
66 at the end of the third
quarter.

Early in the final period,
Towson State went ahead 7-6 on
a goal by attackman Mike
Burke, but Geoff Brent
answered with a goal of his own
only moments later to start a
scoring spree that gave the
Generals the win. With the
scored tied for the fourth time
in the game at 7-7, Foster

scored his fourth goal to put the
Generals in the lead for the first
time.

After’ a quick time out, the
Generals went back on the at-
tack with Scott McLam scoring
on a one- man fast break to give
W&L a two goal lead at 9-7. This
play firmly shifted the momen-
tum to the Generals’ bench.

Two scores by attackman
Chris Kearney solidified the
lead. The first came at 5:30 in
the fourth off a pass from Mike
Pressler and the final score
came with 4:28 left in the game
on an extra-man play, with the
assist going to Rob Staugaitis.

Standouts in the game were
Foster with four goals, Kearney
with two, and Staugiatis, who
contributed six assists while

playing with a broken rib he suf-
fered during practice.

The Generals scored on three
or four extra-man opportunities
while Towson State managed to

“capitalize on only 2 of 6. W&L

also won 17 of 22 face-offs with
John Hooper winning 12 of 13.

Coach Jack Emmer express-
ed satisfaction with his team’s
performance, stressing that,
though the Generals failed to

play well in the first half, the
team came through in the
clutch. Emmer praised the play
of McLam and Olive,
characterizing the latter, as a
‘solid but unsung player.”’

Emmer also said that though
his team is currently ranked
third, it ‘can’t play with the
rankings in mind. We have to
concentrate on the games
ahead.”

Heart Fund Race

Seven members of the

No Jinx Last Saturday

By Bill Whalen

I must confess that before last Saturday’s
lacrosse game, I was a bit skeptical of the W&L’s
success. Afterall, the Generals had won their first
three games and one had to wonder if and when
the roof would fall in.

Well, Saturday’s games seemed to be the
perfect opportunity for all of my doubts and
nightmares to come to life. The Generals were fac-
ing a team that had nothing to lose and everything
to gain from beating W&L — and for a while, it
looked like they damn well were going to.

In case you weren’t there to see, Townson State
gave the Generals the type of game that they did
not want to have, but probably necded. Before run-
ning out of gas sometime in the fourth quarter,
Towson has stayed even with W&L, and were
prepared to pull off one of the bigger upsets of the
young season.

But thanks to a flurry of scores and some deft
clearing and passing, the Generals were able to
escape from what was their toughest game of the
season. More importantly, the game probably
erased any of the smugness which goes with a No.
4 national ranking.

Ask a coach and he’ll tell you. The toughest
game is the one which comes after the high rank-
ing. For some unknown reason, teams play poorly
when the realize just how good they might be.

And, on Saturday, the Generals almost fell vic-
tim to that same curse.

But they didn’t, thanks to the work of two
players who are in the final season of their four-
year stays at this school. If I were in charge of giv-

ing out MVP awards after Saturday’s games, my
two choices would have been Scott McLam and
Jay Foster.

On the field, McLam and Foster are almost the
same type of player. Both go relatively unnoticed
unless they score and both seem dedicated to the
type of team ball which has resulted in their
team’s high position. Against Towson, both were
key reasons why the Generals were able to over-
come their early stagnation. ’

Foster’s presence as a little more noticeable
than McLam’s. The senior attackman scored four
of his team’s 11 goals. And in case you haven’t
noticed, Foster has always been a consistent
scorer, connecting on better than one-third of his
attempts throughout his career.

Scott McLam, on the other hand, is one of those
players who has an anonymous role. McLam plays
what is best called a ‘‘defensive midfielder” role,
which means his job is basically to clear the ball to
someone else who can score. But many of you may
not realize that this guy can run, pass and shoot as
well as anybody else on his team.

On Saturday, McLam was one of the middies in-
strumental in getting the ball into the Generals’
scorers. He did his job so well that he even scored
a goal himself after running two-thirds of the
length of the field and beating the goalie one-on-
one.

The next time you watch the Generals in action
(which will be Sunday, April 20, against Virginia
in what is. looking like a true classic), take a look
at these two players. They might not score as
much as some of their teammates, but they come
through when they’re needed.

Washington & Lee University
administration participated in
the annual Heart Fund Run held
Saturday, March 22, at VMI.

In the 20-29 year old group,
W&L Financial Aid Director
Mike Bartini finished fifth in the
ten kilometer run with a time of
35:52. Paul Kochler and Jeffrey
Robitalle tied for 13th with a
time of 45:09, while Jeffrey
Buntrock finished 18th with a
time of 49:16.

In the 30-39 year old group,

W.L. Sessions placed eighth
with a time of 45:57, edging
Harlan Beckley by only 41
seconds. In the age 40-49 group,
Fred Schwab finished in third
place with a time of 38:31.

Two of Dr. Schwab’s children
also competed in the races. Son
Bryan finished 12th in the mile
run, while daughter Kim was
16th.

The race will be held again at
VMI next year and will be spon-
sored by Col. Louis Hundley.

Bernot All-American

(continued from page 4)

stated W&L head coach Page
Remillard, who accompanied
Mike at the meet. ‘“‘Sometimes
a coach will have a different
view of an athlete’s potentials,
but now, in this case, both coach
and swimmer can see what can
be achieved.”

Concerning the — school
records, Remillard reported

that Bernot is now intent on bet-
tering the marks. “Just as Van
Leer was an outstanding com-
petitor whose marks were
lowered by an eager young
swimmer, so does Mike realize
that one day his records will no
longer stand.

“In the meantime, however,
he’s gonna make it as hard as
he can for someone else to
establish new records.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Shower Chagrins Architect

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Ramblings

Things have been pretty dead around here this
week so we didn’t know what we would comment on in
this space. Even Persiflage couldn’t think of anything
trite to say, so he went down the road last night.

Yesterday was an exceptionally nice day and one of
the editors suggested a ‘‘nice weather”’ editorial, but
others present threatened to resign if we wasted this
space again on that. :

Then someone suggested we warn people again that
they should lock up tight for vacation so, maybe, they
won’t get robbed over break—but you’ve heard all
that before.

One vindictive type said we should make some
snide remarks about how no one seems to know the
origins of the now famous shower, but that would just
be rubbing salt in the wound. (A professor recently
suggested that bidets might be nice bathroom addi-
tions for the female professors. )

Moving on to another topic, has anyone seen two
Burma teak benches lying around? They’re worth
almost $600 and belong to the University. No one
seems to know where they are. We aren’t supposed to
blame the Lexington townies again, are we? (If
found, please return to area in front of the new
library. )

We were tempted to say something about how glad
we are this term is finally over. It’s been a long haul
and it’s ending with the usual flurry of term papers
and final projects. But the last thing you want to read
about are term papers and exams.

Someone else thought it would be a good opportuni-
ty to congratulate the lacrosse team for being ranked
third in the nation and blowing away Tech yesterday
24-3. Now there’s something. It’s too bad the second
half of the schedule is mostly away games—a lot of
road trips. That’s why lacrosse is so big here:
because the lax team is the only chance W&L has to
beat Tech and N.C. State and Virginia. Now you can
feel i: at the lacrosse games—that this is the year. But
we've run out of space. Have a good and well deserv-
ed break.

P.S.—Please, Bob, don’t take away our money. We
won’t say anything else nasty—promise.

Dear Editor:

Please refer to your article
dated March 20, 1980, entitled
“Thoughts on the $1,000
shower’’, giving credit to Dean
Edward C. Atwood for the
shower installed adjacent to his
office.

As planners assisting the
University in renovation of the
McCormick Library into the
School of Business, we were
much chagrined after sear-
ching our files to learn that the
shower had been called for and
installed in the space.

The fact of the matter is that
this facility shares plumbing
pipes with an adjacent janitor’s
closet containing required

plumbing.

The inclusion of the shower
was completely an_ internal
communication planning error
on our part. The additional cost
of the tiled shower was approx-
imately $650 not $1,000.

Anyone can err, Our check for
same has been directed to the
University to cover these costs.

On the subject of Dean At-
wood, during this planning of
the Business School Facility, he
and his faculty employed a
careful and conservative ap-
proach to the school’s needs and
requirements, and made every
effort to provide your student
body with a Sound, long-lasting
and economical facility.

Dean Atwood spent many

UVa Restricts Easters

Student Body, W&L:

As a result of the growing
number of people attending
Easters Weekend at the Univer-
sity of Virginia, all University
and Fraternity events during
that weekend will now be
limited to University of Virginia
students and their legitimate
guests. The immense crowds
which have descended on
Charlottesville in recent years
have presented a_ potentially
dangerous situation and have
necessitated this measure.

Black
Emphasis Week

Impresses
Turner

Dear Editor:

Recently, I had the pleasure
of being the guest of
Washington & Lee University in
celebration of Black Emphasis
Week. I was impressed by the
concern shown me by Dean
John White and other members
of the administration.

The students, primarily
members of S.A.B.U., showed
genuine interest in my work and
posed intelligent questions. It
was a pleasure to meet fellow
author, Clark Mollenhoff, a
member of the faculty as well
as speak with professors from
various other departments.

I would like to thank Mr.
DeMaria of the journalism
school for his interest and stu-
dent Greg Coy for an intelligent
interview on Cable television.
Student Robert Stephen was ex-
tremely helpful in a personal
way and did much to encourage
my present work in progress.

I found lunch at the Cockpit to
be well-prepared and delicious.

Black Emphasis Week is a
vital part of the total educa-
tional experience for those of us
who live in a multi-ethnic coun-
try. It would be encouraging
and wise for members of the
larger campus community of
different racial backgrounds to
participate in the programs of-
fered during this time. I am
sure they would be weleomed.. -

This restricted admittance
policy will be strictly adhered to
and an advance ticket will be
required for entrance to any
event. We are attempting to
make Easters safer and more
enjoyable for all those concern-
ed. We therefore suggest that
you do not visit the University
during Easters Weekend unless
you have made specific ar-
rangements with a friend at
UVA for a place to stay and ad-
mittance to events.

Easters has a long tradition

hours of effort and planning

beyond his normal duties in

assisting us and others involv-
ed.

Dear Editor:

Bob Keefe’s letter on the cor-

portant point.

I think a solution to the pro-
blem would be to rename it the

it has become clear that the on-
ly way the celebration can con-

making this decision and we
hope that you will show your
cooperation.

It is a fallacy to assume that
ideas and programs that stem
from the Black experience are
open or of interest only to Black
people. This is a narrow and un-
productive way of thinking.

Cultural exchange and inter-
racial knowledge can enrich the
life of all who participate in it.
Indeed, such interchange prov-
ed beneficial throughout
history, such as the cultural ex-
change practiced between
China and Japan which resulted
in classical schools of art and
literature.

Flaws In Anti-coeducation Argument

Dear Editor:

In response to the letter dated
Mar. 27, I would like to point out
some basic flaws in Mr.
Mullin’s reasoning. Mr. Mullin
writes:

“If people choose W&L
because of the quality of the
education, choosing it over hun-
dreds of co-educational schools,
might that...be a sign that: A)
The quality of education at
W&L is superior to that of other
schools where women are ad-
mitted (perhaps because we do
not admit women)...”

Mr. Mullin implies that the
quality of education at W&L is
better than at. other schools
because we do not admit
women. It can be inferred then
that women, placed in a learn-
ing environment, negatively af-
fect that environment.

This is strange. I do not See
how women can adversely af-
fect the relative quality of
education, or conversely, how
the removal of women from an
educational system can im-
prove that system.

I can point out reasons why
many W&L students believe
that co-education is bad. Some
say that:

A) Men study harder because
there aren’t any women around
to distract them.

B) Women aren’t as smart as
men, or, at least do not think
like men.

 

April Fool
At W&L

Two W&L professors and two
students were hospitalized for
radiation contamination from
an accident in the physics lab,
or so it was reported on the noon
news Tuesday on campus radio
station WLUR.

Seems two playful freshmen
thought a little April Fools joke
might be in order, but a few
listeners thought they were
serious and made frantic calls
around campus trying to verify
the information.

The journalism department
swept in to handle the problem
and barred both freshmen from
further access to the airwaves
for the rest of the year. These
broadcast people, when will we
ever be able to take them
seriously?

C) The traditions associated
with the present system will be
jeopardized.

The first argument is
popular. Students here see that
they could be distracted from
their work if they could get a
date without having to drive 35
miles. True we at W&L might
be more distracted, but the
ability not to be distracted from
one’s work when there are more
fun things to do is a definite sign
of maturity and and important
skill to leave college with.

Too bad the men at W&L who
see women as nothing but
distractions haven’t had the op-
portunity to develop this
maturity.

The second argument, which
is less popular, but nevertheless
used, is obviously ridiculous
and it ties in with the first. The
fact that these arguments are
considered arguments against
co-education is sad and it
Strangely enough stems from
the fact that we at W&L are not
co-ed.

At W&L today the majority of
the undergraduates’ contact
with women centers around oc-
casional big weekends. As a
result, some of the
undergraduates here tend to
regard women their own age as

“sex objects,:’ as companions
for entertainment only, not as
fellow human beings, as_in-
telligent, as sensitive, as
curious and as courageous as
themselves.

This patently absurd and
degrading view leaves most
W&L undergraduates less well
off than they ought to be or
could be — to cope with and
derive full benefits from the
social and intellectual milieu in
which most of them will pursue
their lives after leaving W&L.

The third argument deals
with tradition which is assumed
omnipotent, but tradition can
lead to stagnation and when it
hinders rational argument or
even denies a different point of
view, it should be abolished.

Another thing that Mr. Mullin
pointed out is that I and Mr.
Clarke should ‘‘bear_ in
mind...that any attempt to
change the basic structure of
the university is going to take
time.’’ To answer this, first of
all, is the basic structure of the
school simply based on the sex
of its students? If so, then this
structure should be rebuilt.

Secondly, just because a
change might not effect us im-
mediately is no reason to deny.
that change. This selfish at-

titude is counterproductive and
does not contain a genuine argu-
ment.

Finally, Mr. Mullin says that
all people who wish to destroy
the school (by simply admitting
girls) should leave. This
primitive love-it-or-leave-it at-
titude ignores the basic argu-
ment. Let’s fact the issue and
consider its relative merits and
not the motivation of the people

who wish to change the system.

A move to co-education will
obviously involve change. Let:s
act in a rational manner and
consider the future. Remember
opposition to change is a defini-
tion of conservatism, but it can
also be a definition of stagna-
tion.

Student Arrested In Dinner Dispute

(continued from page 1)

Shortly after 10 p.m., two
Lexington Police cars arrived
at Nicholson’s apartment. He
was arrested and taken into
custody for booking. One hour
later, Nicholson arranged to
have $200 bail posted and was
released.

Nicholson will face a
preliminary hearing on Tues-
day, Apr. 8, at noon.

The charges against him con-
stitute a ‘‘class one’’ misde-
meanor, carrying a possible one
year jail term.

“This is a serious charge
because it may imply moral
turpitude and would look bad on
my professional record,”’ com-
mented Nicholson. ‘I do not
take this as a joke or a minor
matter.”’

Snyder agreed that the
charge is serious because inn-
keeper laws are strictly enfore-
ed.

“This is a vulnerable
business, so the law protects
innkeepers like myself,” he
said.

He added that on one occa-

In business earlier in the

racketball club conform to the

Bill Towler, a racketball club

They wanted fifty dollars to
cover the entrance fee for a na-

After being denied the money,
Towler compared his club to the
squash club and asked what it
had done to deserve student
funds.

because he ate lasagna made

Student Acquitted In
Open ilondé Trial

On the Monday of exam week
a student was found innocent of
an honor violation in a public
trial in Lee Chapel. The vote
was unanimous.

The student was charged with
lying to an Executive Commit-
tee investigative team.

The team was investigating
the theft of a case of Coors beer
from the freshman dormitories.

During the course of the in-
vestigation the team interview-
ed several witnesses who
testified that they saw the beer
in a room in the Graham-Lees
dormitories during the early
hours of March 15, after the
Nighthawks concert in the
Cockpit.

The accused student stated-

that he did not see any Coors
beer and that he spent the night
in the room.

He said that he had been
drinking heavily and that he
passed out on a mattress while
others in the room continued to
party.

A member or members of the
investigative team turned the
accused in for lying.

Student Hit Again

The accused student received
a closed Honor hearing on the
night of April 2.

Two members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee disqualified
themselves from hearing the
case because they were impor-
tant witnesses.

The accused was found guilty
in the closed trial; giving him
the option of withdrawing from
the university of taking the case
public.

The public trial in Lee Chapel
was attended by a large crowd
of students and faculty, despite
winter semester exams.

The Executive Committee
prosecution was handled by
Bruce Poole, Junior Represen-
tative, and John Fraser, Senior
Law Representative.

The accussed was defended
by Tom Schetelich and Jack
Carrado.

The trial was mediated by
Bill Garrett, the head of the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

Many witnesses testified in
the eleven-hour trial.

At times the testimony of the
EC investigative team centered
around a key witness in the

- Case.

Two of the team members
testified that the team did not
question this key witness in
their preliminary investigation.
One member of the team
testified that the team did inter-
view this witness.

Contradiction in the
testimony of the individuals
present in the dormitory room
were evident in details such as
how much Coors beer was in the
room and the beer’s location.

Most of the witnesses testified
that the accussed was lying on a
mattress on the floor during the

$4,100 In Possessions Stolen During The Year

by Joe Scott

“One of the main reasons I
came to Washington and Lee
was for the honor code. Now I
know the honor code is a joke. I
think it is a facade that should
be torn down to reveal the reali-
ty of our campus.”

Over the past two years,
junior Andy Pick has had more
than $4,100 in possessions
stolen. The most recent theft in-
volved a $1,400 stereo taken
sometime over spring vacation.

The list of missing items is
long and varied. Cash, clothes,
a tape deck, a C. B. radio, 40
record albums and a shotgun
are only several examples.

The list does not include his
car, stolen in October, or a
down jacket, recovered with the
car. Several juveniles were
later charged and pleaded guil-
ty to the offense.

“‘T come from a small town in
Alabama where you can leave
your keys in your car overnight

and nothing would happen and
now I’ve come come to the
sophisticated gentlemen’s
school in Virginia to learn about

dishonesty and thievery as a

way of life.”’

The thieves broke in to Pick’s
house, 820 McCorkle Dr.,
through the back door during
break. ‘‘They didn’t bother my
roommates’s things, they went
directly to my room,’ said
Pick. “‘I have an idea who did it

because they broke into my
room earlier this year. These
thieves know my room so well
you'd think they’d lived there
before,’’ he said. ‘‘To all poten-
tial thieves — I have nothing
left.”

Pick believes his stereo is not
on Campus or in town, ‘‘some-
one would see it. I think they
have good friends at other cam-
puses to fence it.’’ He. also

Mass Media and Politics Topic of Speech

James David Barber, pro-
fessor of political science at
Duke University and author of
the soon-to-be-published book
“The Pulse of Politics: The
Rhythm of Presidential Politics
in the 20th Century,’’ will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-

view of the role of the mass
media as the decisive influence
in ‘today’s presidential elec-
tions.

Scheduled for 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel, Barber’s address is
open to the public at no charge.

Barber’s often startling grasp
of the American political scene
began to surface prominently in
1969 — then, in a paper on
Richard Nixon, he predicted the
tragedy to come in _ that
presidency. Three years later,
he challenged many long-held

But no words are so ‘‘stunn-

Dolitics: ‘‘A revolution in
presidential politics is under-
way. No longer do the Demo-

control the choice of standard-

- bedrers. In their place a new set

of king-makers has arisen: the
journalists. For it is in the
newspapers, the magazines and
on television screens that the
presidential candidacies are
created and destroyed.”’.

Barber continues: ‘‘What is
new is not mass communication
as one of the major forces in
politics, but rather its
emergence to fill virtually the
whole gap in the electoral pro-
cess left by the default of other
independent elites who used to
help manage the choice....

Evans Wins
Grant

John M. Evans, professor of
English at Washington and Lee
University, has been awarded a
research grant from. the
Maurice L. Mednick Memorial
Fund, administered by the
Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges.

Evans, who teaches courses
on Augustan and later 18th-
century English literature, will
use the grant this summer for
study of the works of John
Milton and Alexander Pope at
Yale University and at the
Library of Congress. He will
also be on a sabbatical leave-of-
absence during W&L’s winter:
term in 1981 to continue the pro-
jects.

The Mednick Memorial was
created in 1967 in honor of a
young Norfolk industrialist who
died from accidental causes
and whose family and business
associates wished to perpetuate
his name by establishing a
scholarship fund to emphasize
his interest in higher education.

EC Addresses Security;
Makes Recommendations

After hearing the details of a
rash of burglaries that occurred
in the freshman dorms over spr-
ing break, the Executive Com-
mittee passed two recommen-
dations Monday night aimed at
W&L's “‘security problem”.

In its first recommendation
the EC requested Steve
Abraham, the EC President, to
talk with President Huntley
about strenghthening the
security force at W&L.

The second recommendation
asks the Administration to have
all the dorm room locks chang-
ed.

It also asks the University not
to give the janitors pass keys
for the new locks.

The role that pass keys
played in the thefts and the

strength of the EC's action were-

the focal points of discussion.

First-year Law _ Represen-
tative Sam Allen spoke in favor
of stronger action thatn the EC
eventually took.

“We've (the EC) talked about
security all year long, and what
do we have?...a couple of
lights,’ said Allen, in answer to
his own question.

Allen told the EC that it hada
chance to take strong action ina
concrete way.

After Allen's motion, failed,
one favoring pass keys to held
only by the head dorm
counselor, he supported another
by Freshman Representative
Edmund Schenecker.

Schenecker proposed _ that
dorm counselors be punished
for losing pass keys and no
janitors have pass keys.

When that motion stalled 6-6
Allen said, “It is obvious the
Executive Committee does not
want to take strong action on
this matter.”

Allen called the eventual mo-
tion a ‘wave in the wind.”

passed.

After Abraham's proposal to
change the locks in the dorms
and keep janitors from having
pass keys, one EC member
referred to him as ‘‘the great
compromiser”’ Henry Clay.

And the EC discussed _ pro-
blems which have arisen over
the free courses it organized for
the spring.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole said the auto mechanics
course will probably be can-
celled because of the death of
the mechanic who was to teach
the course.

The wine-tasting course caus-
ed considerable debate and
theree votes before it was
straightened out.

First-year Law  Represen-
tative Sam Allen said he
thought the wine could be pur-
chased wholesale.

But several EC members op-
posed the idea of the EC spon-
soring a course that only
Students over 21-years-of-age
can take.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg proposed a motion,
which passed unanimously, that
the EC should not pay for any of
the courses.

“These costs are minimum,
so people should pay for them,”
Blumberg said.

Allen offered to look into the
cost of the wine, and Cotter put
his offer into a motion which
failed 66.

After Cotter’s motion to have
the matter investigated failed,
Abraham proposed the course
should be dropped.

That motion also failed and
Cotter’s original motion was
brought up again and passed.

Earlier in the meeting, Cotter
brought up a project he has
been looking into with Athletic
Director William McHenry and

The project is the construc-
tion of a jogging and walking
path along the C&O Canal-
Maury River trail.

The organizers of the project
want W&L students to raise
$7,500 by June 30, 1980.

After talking about the pro-
ject, the large amount of money
and short period of time in
which to raise it, the EC recom-
mended Cotter look into the
matter.

The EC will also begin mak-
ing White Book revisions Mon-
day night.

At the same meeting, the EC
will accept petitions for persons
who want to run for the Univer-
sity Council,

The UC is composed of Ad-
ministration members, faculty
members and students.

The EC had planned to talk to
the SAB Co-Chairmen about
ticket scalping at the
Nighthawks concert.

But the co-chairmen did not
attend the meeting and the EC
said it will request their atten-
dance at the next meeting.

Allen also asked Danny
Raskin, the sole SAB represen-
tative, why movies are no
longer shown at the law school.

Raskin said he will look into
the matter.

stereo equipment.

Neither the Lexington Police
nor the University have any
clues thus far in the investiga-
tion.

There were five rooms involv-
ed in Graham-Lees and all were
entered with a pass key, accord-
ing to University proctor Bob
Murray. Those who suffered
losses include John Billmyre,
whose $370 Bose speakers were
stolen; Ken Johnstone, who is
missing a $300 Onkyo amplifier;
Doug Woodson, a $550 tape
deck; Townsend Oast, who
reports missing a pair of meter
indicators valued at about $40;
and Craig Albanese, who lost a
tape deck.

The hinges were taken off of
the door of Johnstone's closet
and the amplifier was removed
from under several other pieces
of stereo equipment.

None of the other equipment
was touched, and the boxes
were left in order. The other
victims’ equipment was taken
directly out of their rooms.

The apartment break-ins in-
cluded the removal of a set of
headphones and a tape deck
from the apartment of Andy
Pick, 820 McCorkle Drive.

The items had a combined
value of $1400, according to
police reports.

The other break-in was at the
home of Michael Sokolowski of
116 Lee Avenue. He reported
missing an estimated $165
worth of articles including
music books, a brief case and
jumper cables.

Movie Review

“The Changeling’ Creaks

By John Wells

The Changeling, which opens
this Friday at the State
Theater, is a well acted
although not particularly in-
novative variation of the old
haunted house thriller.

The director, Hungarian-born
Peter Medak, displays a skillful
sense of timing, and his execu-
tion of an adequate screenplay
is immeasureably aided by the
fine acting of George C. Scott,
his wife and frequent co-star
Trish Van Devere, and veteran
star Melvyn Douglas
who most recently won the
Academy Award for best sup-

porting actor.
The story opens as Scott’s
wife (Jean Marsh) and

daughter are killed, even before
the principal credits are shown
(a la Hope Lange and child in
Death Wish). Scott, as a
celebrated composer, moves
out of his apartment and buries
his grief by accepting an offer
to lecture at a_ university
somewhere in Washington
state. There he decides to rent
an older home from the local
historical society, whose
representative (Van Devere)
takes him and the audience on a
tour of The House.

Scott’s prospective dwelling
seems benignly sinister at first,
but he brightens the place up a
bit with tapestries and Chagall
prints, and sets up a music

illusion of tranquility is dissolv-
ed when the actor leaves the
room and a single piano key is
sharply pressed by an unknown
force. This is followed by bang-
ing noises (couldn’t be the
pipes) and then a succession of
several cliche-ridden haunted
house occurrences: Doors that
open and creak by themselves,
mysteriously turned-on water
faucets, an ominously tinkling
chandelier, and eventually the
discovery of a cobweb-cloaked
secret room, containing a small
wheel chair and a music box
(which happens to play a tune
Scott himself had composed).
Here’s where the plot begins
to unfold as Scott consults Van
Devere, with whom he’s
become friendly, and .the
historical society for informa-
tion about the house’s past. A

tight-lipped old crone named |

Minnie Huxley warns him that
the house is ‘‘not fit for people”’
but refuses to exvlain why. A
seance is then held, providing
one of the film's better directed
scenes and showing admirable
control by not resorting to gore
tactics.

After the spirit of a crippled
child is contacted, Scott persists
in digging up the whole story
even at the risk of locking horns
with a powerful Senator
(Douglas, trim and spry at 79)
who once lived in the house and
is mysteriously associated with
a darker aspect of its history. It

And Groans

shouldn’t take the audience long
to figure out what’s going on
and be moderately entertained
in the process.

George C, Scott handles his
role well, and actually develops
a sort of fascinating rapport
with the real star, the House,
which rumbles and quakes as
he confronts it with hoarsely
shouted questions, Van Devere,
a fine actress who really
deserves better, finally breaks
with the laid-back coolness she
maintains throughout the first
half of the picture and sweats,
shouts, and darts her eyes
around just like George. Many
of the scenes appear to be
humorous in content, and are in
that respect honest for surely
performers of such calibre
regarded many of the lines they
were required to speak as
satirical. In the film’s funniest
sequence Van Devere is chased
throughout the house by the
decrepit but belligerent old
wheelchair, which bears down
on her with such speed and
ferocity as to induce involun-
tary mirth. The film’s final
moments are entirely with the
realm of prediction.

The film partially succeeds
with minimal distinction for
Medak as a director and the
writers, William Gray and
Diana Maddox. The moments of

Music Review

Popular

By Mark Kinniburgh

Elvis Costello has finally taken the number one
position on the album charts with his latest release
Get Happy. Anyone who has followed Costello
through his first three albums will assert that it is
about time that the recognition came, and
although Get Happy may not be Elvis’ best try to
date, it is certainly a commercial success. The
Costello phenominon is a strange one at best,
because it seems that you can love him or hate
him — I haven't heard anyone say anything in bet-
ween. As a songwriter, Elvis Costello can’t be
compared, for he far outdistances all rivals. But
as a performer and a musician, Costello manages
to alenate some listeners while enchanting others.

On his first album, My Aim Is True, Costello
writes such songs as ‘“‘Alison,’’ (to be recorded
later by Linda Rondstadt), ‘‘Watching The Detec-
tives,” (performed on Live At Hollywood High) and
‘‘Miracle Man,”’ (later recorded by the Outlaws).
The first album is unique because it was recorded
in three days in a basement studio with minimal
production and tampering. The quality of the
record is therefore quite raw with a great deal of
spontaneous energy.

The second album, This Year's Model, ranks as
the most straight-forward rock album that
Costello has done to date. As if to prove that the
first try was no fluke, Elvis hits hard with ‘Radio,
Radio,”’ ‘Lip Service,’ ‘‘No Action” and ‘“‘Pump
It Up,” each of which has a distinctive rocking
quality and definite Costello tag. On This Year's
Model we see the introduction of the Attraetions,
Costello's back-up band made up of seasoned bar

Acceptance For Elvis

musicians who still accompany him.

Armed Forces, as Costello’s third album, stands
out as a blatant political statement with songs
such as ‘‘Oliver’s Army” and “Green Shirt” and
“Goon Squad.” There are more orchestrated
songs on ‘Armed Forces,’’ a far cry from the
simplicity of the first album. This third album
reflects the Costello philosophy of not repeating on
one album what he has done or said on a previous
one.

Finally to Get Happy, we see Costello’s bid for
commercial acceptability with an album of twenty
songs. Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk and The Clash’s
London Calling each are dual album sets and yet
they lack the number of songs on the one disc
Costello album. There is also a plus to Get Happy in
that there is very little ‘‘filler’’ material. Most of
the songs are good enough to carry an entire
album, which is the trend these days. So, even if
you never cared for Elvis Costello, you might want
to buy or borrow Get Happy and give it a few listen-
ings, and be advised, it could grow on you,

Dowd’s story about the struggling team is violent, profane, and

very, very funny. With Jennifer Warren as Newman’s disgusted

The News In Brief

 

The Economics Of
. Coal Costs

Interesting fact: it is cheaper
to ship coal from South Africa to
Corpus Christi, Texas, than
from Colorado to Texas.

“It is ridiculous that you can
bring in coal 7,000 miles from
Africa for less than from Col-
orado,’’ James Burkhardt, an
official of Central Light &
Power Company told the
Baltimore Sun.

Other United States seaport
cities are also considering ship-
ping in coal from Australia. “It
is amazing that you can ship
coal halfway around the world
for less than bringing it in from
a state north of us,”’ said the
mayor of San Antonio.

It is a special irony that the

U.S., with the world’s largest
coal reserves, enough to last
hundreds of years, imported 3
million tons of coal last year—
almost twice the level of two
years ago. (770 million tons of
coal were produced domestical-
ly last year.)

Railroad industry officials
maintain that without even
higher rates for hauling coal the
railroads will continue to fall in-
to financial troubles. (Rails now
haul three-fourths of the na-
tion’s coal. )

While coal costs have remain-
ed relatively stable at about
$7.20 a ton, it costs an additional
$19.25 a ton to haul it by rail
from the Wyoming mines to to
south Texas cities.

Is This Any Way To Run A

Student Government ?

This is the story of two very
crazy college students who have
gotten hold of the student
government.

They are Jim Mallon and
Leon Varjian, president and
vice-president of the Wisconsin

_ Student Association.

Their first act in office was to
change the name of the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin to the Univer-
sity of New Jersey. ‘‘Do you
know that every other state of
the union has a ‘University of ’
except New Jersey?” exclaim-
ed Leon Varjian, pounding the
desk for emphasis. “So we
figured, what the hell, we can
afford to be big about it. There
are 13 Universities of Wiscon-
sin, right?”’

At an early political rally,
their supporters The Pail and
Shovel Party — were mudsl-
inging and backstabbing life-
size cardboard pictures of their
opponents with rubber knives
and real mud. (They publicly
pledged a campaign of “‘graft,
money-laundering schemes,
bribes, and other forms of cor-
ruption”; they also “bought
off’’ voters with $35 million in
play money.)

Their platform was sum-
marized by the slogan. ‘‘Give
students what they want: sex,
drugs, and rock and roll — the
Big Three.”’ They promised to
buy the Statue of Liberty and
move it to Wisconsin, provide
escalators on steep hills, give
trading stamps with bookstore
purchases, provide helicopter
service to the dorms, and flood
the football stadium for mock
naval battles.

Last September they spent
about $2,500 in student money
buying hundreds of plastic pink
flamingos, which they set up on

the lawn in front of the main ad-
ministration building to

welcome new students.

The pair has also declared
war against UCLA, Berkeley
and about 50 other college cam-
puses.

The secret to political suc-
cess, according to Jim Mallon is
to ‘‘buy off the opposition, pay
off the press, and give the peo-
ple what they want.”’ He gave a
reporter for the Washington
Post a check for $15 trillion to
write a good story about them.

But not everyone is happy
with this unique form of student
government’ The student
newspaper, the Daily Cardinal,
charged that Mallon and Var-
jian had paid four friends $3 an
hour to pass out penny tuition
rebates during registration
week; made more than $100 in
personal long-distance phone
calls charged to the student
government; bought $600 worth
of toys for their office; and
spent $125 on a_ telephone
answering machine for their
“Dial a Joke”’ service.

The graft is not hidden,
Mallon’s sister is student
association secretary, his
girlfriend is its official
photographer, and his room-
mate is his executive assistant
and field marshal of his army of
draft beer drinkers.

Other student leaders have
complained that Mallon and

Varjian are hurting the reputa-
tions of student government all
over the country.

They have had their budget
frozen and audited by the
dean’s office. ‘“‘We found no
evidence of _ illegalities of
misuse of funds,’’ says the dean
of students. ‘‘We did find a lot of
evidence that (some) people
wished they’d spent their
money differently.”

But apparently, the students
like them because they were re-
elected for a second term.

Answering the charges of
misappropriation of student
funds, Varjian told the Chroni-
cle of Higher Education: ‘‘Sure
we are squandering funds. Ab-
solutely true! We squander
them on beer. We squander
them on parties. We squander
them on drugs. We squander
them on all sorts of things.’

“Of course there are il-
legalities every day,’’ he con-
tinued, pounding the table for
emphasis. “The bribes, the
graft, the payoffs, the under-
the-table deals; the money in
the back pocket...”

And although he _ has
graduated, Malion is thinking
about running for a third term.
“It’s the greatest job in the
world,” he said. ‘I’ve got four
electric typewriters and my
phone has six buttons on it.”’

Casper, Wyo, was jilted by his
girlfriend recently, So, he put
up a sign in front of his house:
“For Sale, Used Boyfriend.
Good Condition. 266-4382.”’

Weckwerth has gotten a good
response to his plea and hopes
to find someone nice out of all
who have responded.

Silver Honesty

New York’s Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel has had a windfall of
honesty lately. Three months
ago, when the price of silver
was at an all-time high, a New
Jersey woman sent six silver
demitasse spoons back that she
had taken years before as
souvenirs.

Since then, 33 stolen silver
spoons have been returned to
the hotel, along with two silver
candlesticks, a silver cham-
pagne bucket, and a silver
oyster fork.

W&L Defamed

From Dr. John D. Battle, Jr.,
class of °34, comes an_ in-
teresting item from. the
Cleveland Amory. The book
seems to discuss the drop in
SAT scores and the general in-
eptitude of today’s college
students, using us aS an exam-
ple:

“The chaplain of Washington
& Lee University had told
him...that the students there
didn’t know how to do anything

from completing an assignment
to writing a decent paper.

“Well, we all sat up at that.

Washington & Lee isn’t exactly
Harvard or Yale, but it’s not
one of those tiddlywink colleges
either. The chaplain had told

him...that the simple inability
to do a job had replaced sex and
religion as the Number One pro-
blem in the colleges.”’

Who could be the source of
this defamation on our school’s
character? Granted, students
are a little lazy once in a while,
but really, are we all illiterate?

Anyone who feels he has been
defamed may contact the Ring-
tum Phi, where our legal ex-
perts will explain all about libel
and how to get rich through
lawsuits.

(P.S. — Will the ‘‘chaplain”’
please report to a small public
lynching to be held in his
honor? )

The Washington
lacrosse team took on the Duke
University Blue Devils in
Durham yesterday, after only a
twoday layoff from their en-
counter with the Virginia
Cavaliers.

The Generals came out well
in a physical match that saw the
temperatures soar into the 90’s.
The Generals walked away with
a 15-4 win, upping their season
record to 6-1, following their
first loss Sunday.

Chris Kearney led the way
with five goals after being shut
out against Virginia, while
three different players, Roman
Kupecky, John Tunney and
George Santos, each scored
twice.

The first half of play was
dominated by the Generals, as
Duke was kept on the defensive
most of the time. Kupecky
Started the scoring at 13:43 of
the first period on a feed from
Mike Pressler.

Tunney then scored on
another pass from Pressler and
the Geenrals had a quick 2-0
lead. Another goal by Kupecky,
followed by a score from Bob
Carpenter and another tally by
Kearney, put W&L in a com-
manding 5-0 lead.

The Blue Devils finally scored
in the second period; but went
into the lockerroom trailing by
four goals.

Neither team looked terribly
sharp in the first half, as there
were wild scrambles for ground
balls and an excessive amount
of slashing fouls. The key to the
Generals’ lead, however, was
their ability to bombard the
Duke goalie with sharp shots.

Generals Lose To Virginia; Beat Duke

 

Chris Kearney (No. 17) and Jay Foster (No. 13) put pressure on UVa goalie during last Sunday’s game.

Generals lost, 13-8.

The second half belonged to
Kearney more than to his team.
Back on track again, Kearney
scored four times in the second
half and, at one point, the 6’8”
attackman reeled off three con-
secutive scores.

By the fourth quarter, the
roughouse hitting began to take
its toll. Carpenter suffered what
was diagnosed as an apparent
concussion in a collision on the
Generals’ end of the field. John
Hooper, who had _ been
dominating the face offs, was
forced to leave earlier with an
apparent separated shoulder. —

“We warned the referees
earlier about cheap shots,”’ said
Coach Jack Emmer,’’ but the
game just got out of hand.”’

Ware Palmer took over in the
goal for Bob Clements in the se-
cond half and gained some
valuable playing time.

Santos, Hooper amd Art
Caltrider each scored early in
the third quarter to boost the
lead to 10-1. After Duke’s se-
cond score, Kearney put in
three goals. The Blue Devils
scored twice more, but John
Sancilio ended the scoring with
a goal to give the Generals the
15-4 win.

Cavaliers and the third-ranked
Washington & Lee Generals.

Netmen Win Twice On

By Dale Park

For the W&L varsity tennis
team, the last five matches
have turned out to be all-or-
nothing affairs.

Before the break, the netmen
hosted the visiting University of
North Carolina team. As could
be expected, the Division I
Tafheels proved too much foi
the Division III Generals,
walloping W&L 9-0. The
Generals most impressive per-
formances were turned in by
freshman Steve Denny at fifth
singles and the second doubles
team of junior Doug Gaker and
Peter Lovell.

Denny was able to take his
man to 5-5 all before falling 7-5
in the first set and then 6-3 in the
second. Lovell and Gaker, after
dropping th> first set 6-4, came
back to win W&L’s only set of
the day 7-5, yet succumbed in
the third set, 6-4.

During the break, the
Generals were able to compete
in four of their five scheduled
matches, as their match with
Georgia Tech, scheduled for
April 13, was rained out.

The Generals started their
Southern tour. off right,
crushing Division I Stetson 9-0
on April 15. Winners included
senior co-captain. Stewart

Jackson at first singles,
freshman Jack Sharman at se-
cond singles, Lovell at the third
flight, senior co-captain David
Constine at the fourth spot,
Gaker at fifth and Denny at the
sixth flight. Doubles winners in-
cluded Jackson and senior Pat
Norris at the first flight, Gaker
and Lovell at second, and Shar-
man and Constine at the third
spot.

Against N.A.I.A. champ
Flagler College the next day,
the story was entirely different,
as the Generals fell 8-1. The solo
W&L victory was registered by
the second doubles team of
Gaker and Lovell, who posted a
6-0, 4-6, 6-1 win.

Over 13,000 spectators show-
ed up to witness the rivalry and,
when it was all over, the crowd
left sunburned while Virginia
left with a 13-8 victory, having
proven that they are, indeed,
the best team in the nation.

But throughout much of the
game, that position was
challenged by a fine effort on
the Generals’ part. It wasn’t un-
til the fourth quarter, when the
Cavaliers dominated play and
scored five unanswered goals,
that the outcome of the gam’
was apparent.

Washington and Lee struck
first with a goal after the initial
face-off, Attackman Jay Foster
threw it in only 48 seconds in the
first quarter. About a minute
later, Geoff Brent added
another to put the Generals
ahead 2-0.

On April 17, the Generals
traveled to Division II Rollins
College, where the netmen fell
9-0. Yet W&L was able to take
Rollins to three sets at four posi-
tions; Denny at sixth singles
went down fighting 6-3, 3-6, 6-1,
as did the three revamped
doubles flights.

Jackson and Lovell teamed at
first doubles, losing 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.

Virginia then answered with
its first goal, coming at the 8:02
mark on a shot by Lou Ruland.
W&L scored next on an extra
man play, stretching its lead to
3-1.

Two more scores by the
Cavaliers and a final goal by the
Generals ended the period in a
4-4 tie. UVA scored the only goal
in the second quarter, which put
the Wahoos ahead for the first
time, 5-4, at the half.

The third quarter turned into
a see-saw battle with the score
knotted at 6-6 and then again at
7. But with about four minutes
remaining, the Cavaliers found
the handle and took control of
the game.

Carried by a combination of
fine inside passing and consis-
tent wins on the face-offs by
middie Steve Kraus, the
Cavaliers reeled off five
unanswered goals to put them
in the lead for good. By keeping
the Generals on defense for
much of the fourth quarter,
UVA was able to lengthen their
lead to put the final tally at 13-8.

With the victory over W&L,
Virginia secured its first place
ranking and now sports a
record of eight wins and only
one loss. The defeat, the
General’s first, dropped W&L’s
record to 5-1. Standouts for UVA
were Steve Kraus, who won 17
of 27 face-offs, and midfielder
John Driscoll who scored three
goals.

Seven Cavaliers scored one
goal apiece.

For Washington & Lee,
Foster and John Kemp threw in
three each with Roman

Southern Swing

Gaker and Norris were paired
at second doubles, where they
fell 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Constine and
Denny rounded out the doubles
at the third spot, dropping their
three set match, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

But the Generals ended their
southern swing by smashing
Division II Eckerd, 9-0. On the
afternoon, not a single set was
dropped at any W&L position,
and no set was closer than 6-4.

Baseball Team Wins Once Over Break

By Chris Sisto
The varsity baseball team fell
upon some rough times last
week as they compiled a 146
record in a seven day stretch.

After losing a close game 4-2
to Clarion St. before exams they
did not have a game scheduled
for twelve days.

When the Generals returned
to play it appeared that they
lost some of their early season
momentum.

Spring break began and the
team was shelled by Lynchburg

College 17-1, Hampden-Sydney
9-4 and 11-4, and Bridgewater
College 11-2.

The Generals finally got
together and split a double-
header with Eastern Men-
nonite, taking the first game 7-3
but dropping the second 5-4.

Head Coach of the Generals,
Chuck Kroll, does not blame the
team’s collapse on the players.
‘‘We’re not throwing any of the
games away it’s just that our
opponents are playing better
than we are right now.”’

Some of the overall statistics
help point out Kroll’s sentiment.

The team’s .253 batting
average is higher than last
season’s average at this time.
The General’s defense has also
improved. It has committed
fewer errors than last year.

One area that has suffered
some recently is the pitching
department. It gives up an
average of 6.19 earned runs a
game.

The Generals leading pitcher
is senior Chip Childs who has a

UVa Game Shows Lacrosse
Is Healthy In Virginia

By Bill Whalen
Have you ever looked long
and hard into a mirror? At
first; you don’t believe that
what you’re looking at is the
real thing, but after a while, you
accept what is there.

For some reason, this is the
impression I had as I watched
the lacrosse game last Sunday
in Charlottesville. Neither
school will accept it as truth,
but there really was no dif-
ference between the crowds on
opposite sides of Scott Stadium.

And I’m not just talking about
looks, choices of wardrobe or
even which side rooted harder.
When you sit in a neutral corner
of the stadium (which I did) and
compare the W&L and UVA
crowds, you come away with
the feeling that these two
schools are not entirely dif-
ferent in the ways they support
their lacrosse programs.

Figure it this way. The W&L
contingent occupied roughly
one-half of its side of the
stadium. Across the way, the
UVA mob filled up almost
three-fourths of its space. When
you calculate how many girls
from Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Macon, etc. showed up and how
much larger UVA is than W&L,
you get about the same percen-
tage of fans.

Considering that over 13,000
people showed up for the after-
noon showdown, it is evident

that the lacrosse programs are.

alive and strong at both institu-
tions. Sunday’s attendance is
highly indicative that lacrosse
games are rapidly becoming
the Spring social event.

But what about the game
itself? The Generals got off toa
fast start (they scored less
than.a minute into the game)
and seemed on the way to an
upset. But around the half-way
mark, the ‘Hoos’ speed and dep-
th, coupled with the summer-
like weather, were too much for
W&L.

- experience.

There is no real reason for
either W&L fans or players to
panic, however. First, the
Generals lost to undoubtedly
the best team in the nation. Se-
cond, and more importantly,
the pollsters will more than
likely not regard this loss too
seriously.

Although it will go down in the
record books as a loss to
Virginia, the Generals actually
fell victim to the worst enemy of
any unbeaten team — time. The
odds say the Generals were
destined to lose a game.

It’s too bad it had to happen
against Virginia.

Headache

If you’re one of those people
who likes to predict trends in
sports, don’t bother with trying
to predict lacrosse scores this
year. Like the motto the ACC
carried a few years ago: expect
the unexpected.

Once upon a time, the safest
lacrosse gamble was backing
Johns Hopkins to win every
time. That was before the Blue
Jays lost to Virginia and
escaped near-disaster against
Army. -

Following the Maryland
Terps has also been a painful
Predicting a
Maryland score is easy. Just
guess which Maryland team
will show up! the one which
blew out UNC at Chapel Hill or
the one which has lost at home
to Rutgers, Navy and Virginia?

- This Saturday will feature a
lacrosse doubleheader of confu-
sion in the state of Maryland. At
Annapolis, the up-and-down
Middies of the Naval Academy
will host the Virginia squad. At
the same time, Maryland will
be fighting for its life against
Hopkins.

Either way, the Generals will
benefit from these games. If
Virginia and Hopkins win, then
Navy will return near its
season-long No. 8 ranking.
Another loss will give the Terps
four on the year and put them
near the brink of playoff
elimination.

If Virginia wins and Hopkins
loses, the Generals could
possibly take over the No. 2 slot.
But if both Virginia and
Hopkins lose, then what do the
pollsters do?

Answer: Navy will probably
take a jump ala UVA into first
place.

Don’t forget all of this is bas-
ed on the premise that the
Generals will not lose this week.
That too is not guaranteed.

 

 

WEL Will
Play Sat.

The Generals, still ranked
third in the nation (this week’s
poll was decided before the
Virginia contest), will next play
Washington College in a 2:00
game this Saturday on Wilson
Field.

Despite the bad showing dur-

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Half An Honor
Hearing

The trial proceedings at the recent public Honor
Trial have brought many strong reactions from those
who saw the trial. Many do not realize, though, that
they only saw half of the proceedings. The EC found
that it had a case and pursued it in closed session, as
provided for by the White Book. The student was
found guilty and requested a public trial. He was
acquitted by unanimous vote.

The trial that was presented was incomplete,
though, as the EC could not present its original case
based on original evidence and testimony. There is a
real possibility that the EC’s case seemed so weak
because the testimony it relied on for its original ver-
dict was not the same testimony that was heard in Lee
Chapel.

If the testimony was changed, the EC could not cite
an Honor Violation for lying simply because all EC
members involved in the case would have to dis-
qualify themselves and there would be nobody left to
carry on the proceedings. But had the original
testimony been admissible as evidence, there would
be no changed stories and the students could judge
whether the EC had brought to trial a case that should
never have been tried, as some feel.

Inconsistant with not allowing the testimony from
the closed proceedings is the fact that a deposition
from a witness was used as evidence in the public
trial. A deposition is nothing more than a recorded
and certified testimony, and the information in it
brought more light to the case. Why not allow other
testimony to do the same?

Junior EC representative Bruce Poole has submit-
ted a proposal for a change in the White Book rules
that would allow the testimony from the preliminary
proceedings to be used if and only if there is a public
trial. This proposal would insure that witnesses would
not be inclined to modify their stories and would allow
the student body to see how capable their elected
leaders are in handling matters of such importance.

We do not advocate having the preliminary trial
open to the public as a rule or that the transcripts of
testimony be made available to the public. The only
time the transcripts would be used would be in the
event of an open trial.

Keeping the preliminary trials closed prevents the
situation of the accused being considered guilty by
virtue of his arrest rather than by virtue of his convic-
tion, something well worth protecting in a society as
closed as ours. But open trials are held to allow the
University community the opportunity to consider the
case at hand, the jury decides the verdict and the
gallery insures proper proceedings.

It is most important that the whole student body,
and not just the EC, be presented with the case in its
entirety, rather than the half of it we saw in Lee
Chapel. The EC should accept the proposal in the in-
terests of insuring just proceedings for both parties
involved.

Letters To The Editor
In Favor Of Coeducation

Dear Editor:

I was glad to find that David
Mullin, self-proclaimed racist,
has found a new cause: the
preservation of W&L as a
single-sex school. As_ his
arguments for both show a
similar intellectual foundation,
I can only wonder whether he
construes the two to be similar.

Certainly they are both suffi-
ciently deficient in logic. Mr.
Mullin responds to Palmore
Clarke's argument that
students come to W&L for
academics by claiming that
either: a) the quality of W&L’s
education is superior to that of

co-ed schools because there are
no women here, or b) that Mr.
Clarke is wrong and people
choose W&L because it is all
male.

It seems obvious by the
repugnance and ludicrousness
of the first option that it was
meant as a joke and that Mr.
Mullin therefore wishes to
claim the second as true.

As his solvency Mr. Mullin of-
fers the fact that ‘tabout half’’
of the incoming freshmen each
year come from private
schools, some of which were
single-sex, and that they liked
the experience enough to wish

to continue it in college. The
problem with this argument is
that he is talking about some
nebulous fraction of one-half of
the student body, obviously not
anything approaching a majori-
ty.
Thus, it would seem that Mr.
Mullin has in fact proved
Palmore Clarke's original con-
tention that the majority of in-
coming students don’t know the
impact of single-sex schools
before they matriculate, and
that it does not play that signifi-
cant a part in their decision to

Now that we've got that

Persiflage

 

I don’t know how it happened. It seems like just
a few months ago I had reordered my life and
developed a plan that would successfully take me:
through the last few terms of my academic
career.

After what some people evidently regarded as a
subpar first term, I had the strongest motivation
to do. well in my last run around the track. I mean,
who wants to find himself out on his own after 22
rather pleasant years as a tax deduction?

Thus, with a clear message from my benefac-
tors I decided it was time to get to work. I would
set the Colonnade on fire with my blazing intellect.
I would amaze teachers with my newly found
dedication and interest. I, in short, would once
again secure for myself a place in the hearts, and
hopefully the house, of my beloved, financially
sound, parents.

Alas, fate conspired to block me from my noble
air. For some cruel and arbitrary reason, the
spirits that be sought to keep me from the love and
economic assistance that only a parent can pro-
vide.

Despite my determination to change, I was
unable to overcome the circumstances that were
forever confronting me. My effort was heroic but

(continued on page 9)

Circumstances Beyond Control

doomed by forces out of my control.

Was it my fault that there is a happy hour the
night before my econ. test? Can a person be ex-
pected to read page after page of obscure texts
written by men long planted in the ground when
great contemporary works can be viewed simply
by turning the dial of a small box? Was I to spend
the best days of my life wasting away in clammy
classrooms when the beauty of snow covered
mountains could be viewed while descending from

their majestic heights?

It should be obvious that I did not stand a
chance.

Nevertheless, some have taken the nar-

rowminded view that I, rather than cir-
cumstances, must bear the responsibility for my
actions. Unfortunately, these closeminded little
twerps went out of their way to publicize their
judgments by mailing their evaluations to my
benefactors. By butting into my private life, these
alleged intellectuals have made my existence into
a living hell. They are just damned lucky that hap-
py hour is still around or I would probably take out
my frustrations by doing several gross and
perverse things to their immediate families.

After all, they ruined my home life why
shouldn’t I return the favor?
(continued from page 8)

straightened out (?), it’s time to
turn to Mr. Mullin’s charge that
the co-ed advocates are trying
to destroy the school and should
leave.

While I don’t think it’s worth
looking at the ramifications of a
mass-exodus of the minimum of
50 percent of the student body
who consistently support
coeducation (which would un-
doubtedly result in the destruc-
tion Mr. Mullin is speaking of),
I would like to examine the
charge that the co-ed advocates
are trying to destroy the school.

The coed advocates do not
want to destroy W&L. In fact,
they feel so strongly for W&L
that they wish to offer their sug-
gestions as to how it might be
improved. It is an unfortunate
fact that many good students
have taken Mr. Mullin’s advice
and have for one reason or
another left, or, have exercised
the ‘‘choice’’ which Messrs.
Mullin and Willhite advocate,
and have chosen not to come.

The problem for W&L is that
many times this involves a good
student, a student who might
have added to the quality of the
student body. Thus, the quality
of the student body has suf-
fered.

And as the quality of a school
is a direct function of the quali-
ty of its students, the quality of
the school has likewise suf-
fered. As such we see that the
“‘choice’’ W&L is giving its ap-
plicants is in fact hurting the
school.

The advocates of co-
education see terrific potential
at W&L, a potential that could
be realized if the school were to
become coed. In addition to pro-
viding the social atmosphere
with a much needed touch of
realism and the broadening of
the intellectual basis of the
school (it seems questionable
that the liberal arts tradition
can grow healthy in an at-
mosphere that excludes one-
half of the intellect of the
populace), W&L would no
longer be stigmatized by stan-
ding out to some as all male, an
attribute which I would suggest
likely turns away at least two
for every one it attracts.

Mr. Mullin and those who
agree with him are in effect
strangling W&L, condemning it
to mediocrity, while the ad-
vocates of co-education are in
effect trying to liberate W&L, to
free it from the shackles which
keep it from attaining the
distinction which it wants and

   
     

   

{

bd er

deserves, a distinction based on
intellectual excellence, not on
its unique single sex status.

The ‘“‘choice” which Messrs.
Willhite and Mullin offer is, as
Mr. Mullin says, much larger
than any one student. It is one of
greatness or mediocrity for
W&L, and the advocates of
coeducation would like to go on
record as casting their vote for
greatness. :

Writers!

We’re shaking up the staff
now for next year’s Ring-tum
Phi.

Establish yourself. All would-
be reporters should come by the
Ring-tum Phi’'s office, upstairs

building, on Monday, from 4:30

Dear Editor:

I had been following the
series of letters concerning the
values of co-education at W&L
with some interest when I hap-
pened to read Mr. Mullin:s
response in the March 27 issue
of the Phi. The logic of his
arguments was questionable to
say the least.

While I admire the W&L
tradition of an all-male school
and do not favor co-education at
this historic institution, I do feel
it necessary to reply to Mr.
Mullin’s comment that perhaps
students choose W&L over co-ed
schools because ‘“‘the quality of
education at W&L is superior to
that of schools where women
are admitted (perhaps because
we do not admit women).”’

I feel this statement to be a
particularly good example of
why the enrollment of women
would be an asset to W&L To
widen the scope of Mr. Mullin’s
narrow viewpoint, which is
typical of the attitudes of many
students at all-male colleges! I
am not disputing the academic
excellence of W&L, it is certain-
ly a much finer school than
many others that are co-ed.

However, this has nothing to
do with the fact that women are
not enrolled (unless perhaps
Mr. Mullin believes that with
women around he would not be
able to discipline himself
enough to study, and then yes,
his GPA would fall).

He also seems to suggest that
women reduce the quality of
education, yet there are schools
better than W&L and some of
those are co-ed, namely
William and Mary, one of the
most selective schools in the
state, where the women’s
overall GPA is higher than the
men’s!

.,1,would also be willing to
wager that Vassar, which is all-

{ an”)
Sean Gg |

female, can compare to W&L.

Furthermore, having taken
classes at W&L and having met
many students there, I have
found that in general the stu-
dent body would benefit from
learning to be friends with
women and not merely seeing
them as Friday night dates.

Single sex living is unnatural;
the world is not all-male and
some day you will have to learn
to deal with females as well as
males.

Once again, while not ad-
vocating co-education at W&L,
I'd like to say that if everyone
had Mr. Mullin’s attitude of let-
ting tomorrow’s generation im-
plement changes if they want
them, there would be no such
thing as progress and our socie-
ty would stagnate.

If every generation of blacks
had waited and let their
children decide if they wanted
to be free, they’d still be slaves
today and if my _ great-
grandmother had waited for
some successive generation to
open the doors of education to
women, I’d still be at home do-
ing some menial domestic task
instead of in college studying
thermodynamics!

Coeducation Sparks Student Debate

Well then, you also narrowly
answered with the old “‘if not A,
then B’’ argument, by which
neither of your proposals was
an acceptable solution. A, you
said that if people choose W&L
over many other co-ed schools
because of academic quality,
‘then the quality of education
at W&L is superior to that of
schools where women are ad-
mitted (perhaps because we do
not admit women).”’

It’s OK to think that we may
stand better academically than

ludicrous to think that we are
superior to all of them. Also
where are you coming from to
think that men are always
smarter than women. Probably
W&L. We could say that men
have more aptitude for certain
things than women, but it’s also
vice versa, if you please.

B, Dave says that, well, if not
A, then ‘“‘Mr. Clarke is wrong
and people chose W&L because
it is all male.’’ That, of course
cannot be the only criteria, but
how many people really came

 

Dear Editor:

First of all I'd like to say to
David Mullin that I didn’t think
Mr. Wilson was mocking Jack
Willhite’s ‘“‘clever approach”
which he used to express his
views (hats off to Jack for being
the original one), rather Mr.
Wilson was simply using that
narrative style to present the
other side of the coin.

You see you can argue both
ways. Obviously the issue can’t
be answered with cut and dry
logic. Yet Dave, you later main-
tained that Palmore Clarke’s
argument was too narrow to
support.

He had said that for one, peo-
ple come here for reasons other
than for simply going to an all-
male school, one being for the
pursuit of that abstract stan-
dard we try to define as
“academic quality.’’ He also
said that the introduction of
women to the rolls would result
in an improvement to that

quality:

a lot of co-ed schools, but it’s See W&L, page 10

The Open Honor Trial

The exam week Honor Trial was an event that provoked many
thoughts — some disturbing, some pleasing.

One thought that comes quickly to the mind is that the student in-
volved should have never been brought to a closed Honor Trial in
the first place. The White Book stipulates that 10 members of the
Executive Committee must sit as jurors in any closed Honor Trial.
Two E.C. members excluded themselves from the jury because
they were either the accusers of the student or an important
witness in the case against him. That left 10 members to hear the
case, but one of these was Ed Schenecker, the freshman represen-
tative who was the victim of the Coors Beer theft.

Could Schenecker have believed that he was qualified as an un-
biased juror? Evidently he did because the closed trial was held.
Perhaps Schenecker abstained from voting after the original
testimony was heard, but this is impossible to determine because
the White Book specifies anonimity in the vote. However, the fact
remains, the victim sat as juror.

Another disturbing thought concerns the unrelenting conduct of
the E.C: prosecutors during the open trial. Certainly John Fraser
and Bruce Poole had the responsibility to present to the jury all the
evidence possible that could show that the student was lying. But
after all the testimony was heard, and after it became clear to the
majority of the people in Lee Chapel that there was not enough
evidence to convict the student (this at least became clear to the
jury), the prosecution’s responsibility to attack ended.

But John Fraser continued the attack after all the testimony was
heard. In his summation he used rhetorical devices to ingratiate
himself with those who must pass judgment, he used convoluted
logic in his reasoning, and at times he came very close to twisting
the testimony to serve his purpose — all to convince the jury of the
student’s guilt. This advocacy to the end may be standard practice
in a court of law, but the objective of our Honor System is the trust
— regardless of which side of the bench it comes from.

Common sense and good judgment, not to mention a legal educ-
tion, should have told John Fraser that the evidence needed to con-
vict the accused was lacking. Those same attributes should have
told Fraser that his conduct could have done far more damage to
the Honor System than the student and his cronies could ever do.
How many of the spectators in the crowded gallery will be reluctant
to turn a fellow student in for a possible Honor Violation after they
have witnessed the E.C. prosecution try every trick in the book to
throw the accused out of school?

Another thought crosses the mind: Is the common sense and good
judgment on the part of Ed Schenecker and the E.C. prosecution
reflective of the common sense and good judgment that we, the stu-
dent body, used in electing our E.C. representatives? Did we
carefully pick the best candidate for the job? Did we even have a
choice of the best candidates possible? Perhaps now more of us will
have a better understanding of the awesome responsibility we
delegate in the E.C. elections. Perhaps now more of us will discuss
the candidates and the issues so that we may cast our votes more
wisely. Perhaps now more of us will choose to seek office rather
than to let E.C. seats be won unchallenged.

After all possible thoughts concerning the Honor Trial are
evaluated, one is left with the pleasant realization that in this case
the Honor System worked. The checks and balances built into the
system to protect the innocent arose from the White Book and flex-
ed its muscles, demanding that the accused be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. Once again it was proven that the best
path to the truth is through an informed and concerned public. But
must we wait for another student to sit in Lee Chapel for the judg-
ment of his peers before we once again become informed and con:

Otto Graham, one of tootball’s greatest quarter
comeback: from colorectal cancer. And today, he’s feeling good enough to keep
working full time as Athletic Director of the Coast ¢ suard Academy.

comtemplation of the effects of
going co-ed on a_ previously
single-sex school comparably
similar to W&L, the vast ma-
jority of schools have reported-
ly benefited greatly from the
experience and find the new at-
mosphere more competitive,
more creative, and more
wholesome.

Sure W&L would change if it
went co-ed, but for the better.
What we would be losing is
simply not as important as what
we would be gaining.

Mr. Mullin) wonders why
many who came here from prep
schools that were single sex did
so if they knew what they were
about to go through again. |
went to a boys’ school in
Virginia which I would consider
the perfect prep school for the
stereotyped image of W&L tor
over a vear.

I later went to a Quaker prep
school that’s been co-ed since if
started in 1789 tor my last two
vears ‘how’s that for a tradi-
tion), For me the experience

absence of female peers. |

experience Was much_ better
‘not to say that those who go to
a single sex school have

Consequently I came to W&L,
but not because it was all-male,
and not specifically — for
academic reasons either. I
came mostly because of the ex-
cellent) opportunities at the
radio station and because | love
Virginia cand especially Lex-
ington) and the physical plant
ol W&L

There are a multitude ot
reasons for being here besides it
being all-male, and T guarantee
you many others here now
believe it would be the ultimate
school if only it was co-ed.

Mr. Mullin contends that if we
go co-ed we will be imposing our
views on all of tomorrow's
students. Have you ever con-
sidered that maybe if you are
here because you liked the idea
of an all-male school then you
have had someone elses will im-
posed upon you, distorting your
concept of the “natural environ-
ment.”

There’s nothing prestigious
about maintaining a single sex
atmosphere. Its outdated and
inhibiting. You're excluding a
whole side of society from your
day to day experience, How can

that be beneficial? I think it’s
pigheaded.

Finally, and get this, he says
that “W&L is bigger than any
student.” Does this imply that
my existence here is to help
support and perpetuate — this
sytem rather than this system
filling and replenishing me in
the best way possible? You can
only knock down the wall when
you see that it has obstructed
your path.

I hope that I have brought a

different insight to those who
might have thought otherwise
about’ the merits of co-
education. I would also like to
thank David Mullin for provok-
ing me into writing these
thoughts down.

And finally I would like to pro-
pose we lay out plans for a
modestly scaled exchange pro-
gram for the spring of next
year. Anybody willing to work
on this?

McDaniel Work Published

An article by John M.
McDaniel, associate professor
of anthropology at Washington
and Lee University, entitled
“Effects of Behavioral and
Ecological Variations Upon the
Incidence of Parasitic Disease

Among la Gente of Concepcion,

Peru,” is included by Mouton
Publishers in a_ recently
published reader on medical an-
thropology, ‘Spirits, Shamans
and Stars.”’

The anthology is one of a new
series under the general title of
“World Anthropology,” edited
by Prof. Sol Tax of the Universi-
ty of Chicago. The series is a
product of the ninth Interna-
tional Congress of Anthropo-
logical and Ethnological

Sciences, held in 1973.

McDaniel began teaching an-
thropology and archaeology
courses at W&L in 1971, and he
received his Ph.D. degree from
the University of Pennsylvania
a year later. From 1974 through
its conclusion in 1979, he
directed the Liberty Hall ex-
cavations, unearthing evidence
about Washington and Lee’s
18th-century predecessor in-
Stitution. The results of that
research were eventually
printed in a series of articles
and longer pieces, notably, the
monograph ‘‘Liberty Hall
Academy: The Early History of
the Institutions Which Evolved
Into Washington and Lee

time that the beer was in the
room.

Some witnesses testified that
the accused was either asleep of
appeared to be asleep shortly
after the Nighthawks concert.

Evidence of cans and six-
pack wrappers from the miss-
ing case of Coors beer was in-
troduced to document that the
beer was in the room that night.

In the preliminary investiga-
tion the accused said the only
thing he saw in relation to Coors
beer was an empty six-pack
wrapper in the bushes outside of
the dormitory room.

He said he did not see this un-
til the following morning
around noon.

A deposition from an area
youth was introduced as
evidence in relation to this
testimony.

The youth said he saw several
full cans of Coors beer in the
same bushes before 10 a.m.
Saturday.

When the investigative team
searched these bushes they
found the wrapper the accused
saw and a few empty cans of
Coors.

The key testimony in the case
appeared to be that of one of the
freshman in the room during
the time in question.

This witness testified that he
had fallen asleep around 8 p.m.
and awoke about midnight.

He said that he entered the
room shortly after the other
witnesses arrived from the con-
cert and stayed for roughly one
hour.

During the time he was in the
room, the witness said he saw
no Coors and that the accused
was asleep when he left.

The accused took the witness
stand and testified that he had

that afternoon until after the
concert.

He said that when he entered
the dormitory room he became
concerned because it was late,
he was drunk and he had a
lacrosse game that day.

He testified that he was a
good friend of the person who
lives in the room and that the
person was out of town for the
night.

The accused testified that he
decided to sleep in the room
because his room is four flights

up and he knew the owner of the
room would not mind.

The accused said that he slept
in the room and woke up bet-
ween 9 and 10 a.m. Saturday.

He said that at no time did he
see any Coors beer in the room.

The testimony of the accused
was followed by the final sum-

returned the unanimous deci-
sion of not guilty shortly before

Law Student Charged By
Hospital For No Treatment

by Randy Smith

Bill Calore, a first-year law
student at Washington and Lee,
injured his head during
February’s mid-winter
undergraduate break.

He went to Stonewall Jackson
Hospital in town because he
assumed W&L’s _infirmery
would be closed, since it keeps
such short hours when the
undergraduates are out of
school.

Once at the hospital, he was
told that the infirmery was open
and he should go there for treat-
ment.

Now, over two months later,
Calore is in dispute with the
hospital over a $15 bill for not
receiving treatment.

The law student related his
story to the student body Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night and asked the govern-
mental body to look into it.

Although Calore had left a
note in the complaint box out-
side the infirmery shortly after
the accident, he has received no
response from the University

Health Committee established
by the EC several months ago.

“We're being ignored one
more time around,” said EC
law school representative John
Fraser. ‘Bill got shafted. This
committee (the health commit-
tee) should get behind him.”

Bob Willis, junior EC rep. and
next year’s student body presi-
dent, called for a meeting of the
health committee to take place
sometime this week, with a
report to be delivered to the EC
this Monday.

Willis also wants an explana-
tion from administration offi-
cials about the practice of cut-
ting off 24-hour on campus
medical service when
undergraduates are on break.

The EC has spent $1,951.49 so
far this year, Les Cotter, EC
vice-president, reported.

Over $400 was spent on kegs
of beer for freshman orientation
last fall.

Printing expenses have totall-
ed $298 and the telephone com-
pany has been paid $190 this
year.

The EC has $1,548.51 remain-
ing in its “Office Expense ac-
count”’ from an original $3,500.

In the ‘‘Student Body Reserve
Fund Account,’ the EC has
$9,607.28 left to distribute. This
amount is almost $200 more
than the committee had
originally.

The committee also approved
‘money for three kegs”’ of beer
for a “meeting of campus
leaders’ on May 16. The
‘“meeting’”’ was proposed by
Bob Willis, junior EC rep.

The purpose of the gathering
is so that present and future
campus leaders can meet and
discuss problems in an informal
setting.

But all are invited.

The ‘‘meeting’’ is scheduled
to be held in the Alumni house
on- May 16, from 4-6 p.m.

Professor Profile Series

Dr. Griffith To Retire

 

By Jim Feinman

Dr. E.C. Griffith, Professor of Economics, will
retire from teaching at the end of the academic
year. Griffith, 65, will continue his work with the
Federal Mediation and Arbitration Service while
spending more time with his family as well as in
his garden and wood-working shop. 7

Claybrook Giffith came to the University in 1946
after six years at the University of Georgia. He
has served as Chairman of the Department of

greatest attributes of the University is its em-

terest is in teaching, to teach. Here teachers are

 

Griffith related to the Alumni Magazine his feel- -

teaching, unlike other schools where the emphasis
is on research, and teaching is merely a means of
support while research is underway.”

“During my years here, the University has
maintained and assembled a faculty of great com-
petence, and there has been considerable im-
provement in the physical plant such as library
facilities and laboratory space. On the other hand,
I have seen some changes in the University that
have bothered me considerably, In terms of
students for example, I have been troubled over
the years by the collapse of traditions that I think
were an outstanding part of the University when I
came here.”’

One disappearing tradition that disturbs Pro-
fessor Griffith is the ‘‘speaking”’ tradition. ‘‘It us-

professor without some friendly recognition, such

The Gilliam Award is given
annually to the student ‘‘who
has made the most valuable
contribution to student affairs
in one or more fields.’’ The
award is one of the university's
most prestigous because the

   

recipient is chosen by a com-
mittee of student
underclassmen.

The award is named for Dean
Emeritus Frank J. Gilliam as a
tribute to his long and devoted
service to Washington and Lee.
It consists of a silver bowl and a
cash donation to the university
organization or department
selected by the recipient.

‘‘T feel it is a great honor,”
Cornett said after receiving the
award. ‘I was really surprised
and honored.”

The $100 cash award will be
donated to the Mock Convention
committee, Cornett said.

The award presentation was
made by University President
Robert E.R. Huntley.

In Memorium

David A. Madison, Jr.

David A. Madison Jr., a 23-
year employee of Washington
and Lee University and for
many years the head of the
campus mail service, died Fri-
day morning in a Lexington
hospital. He was 60.

He is survived by his wife,
Mrs. Mary Madison of Lex-
ington; two sons, David A.
Madison III and Michael
Madison, both of Dale City, Va.;
his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth
Madison of Lexington; a sister,

Mrs. Elizabeth Butler of
Bridgeport, Conn., and six
grandchildren.

Washington and Lee’s presi-
dent, Robert E.R. Huntley,

said: ‘‘Dave Madison was a
part of the actual fabric of
Washington and Lee — easygo-
ing and hardworking, as good a
yarn-spinner, as good-natured,
with as good a sense of humor,
and as devoted to W&L as
anyone I’ve known. For many
of us, certainly for me, he was a
sounding-board and advisor as
well as good friend. Not much
ever managed to happen at
W&L that Dave didn’t know

about and approve of.”’
A funeral service took place
Monday in First Baptist

Church. Interment followed in
Evergreen Cemetery. J.B.
Lewis Funeral Service was in
charge of arrangements.

UC Petitions Received

Fifteen petitions were receiv-
ed Monday for positions on the
University Council.

problems. )

The following five students
are running for senior positions
on the UC: Jamie Small, Robert
Neely, Chris Gammon, Ray-
mond Best and Joe Robles.

To Speak
Tonight

James David Barber, pro-
fessor of political science at
Duke University and author of
the soon-to-be-published book:
“The Pulse of Politics: The
Rhythm of Presidential Politics
in the 20th Century,” will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Thursday, May 1, on his
view of the role of the mass
media as the decisive influence
in today’s presidential elec-
tions.

Scheduled for 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel, Barber’s address is
open to the public at no charge.

Barber’s often startling grasp
of the American political scene
began to surface prominently in
1969 — then, in a paper on
Richard Nixon, he predicted the
to come in_ that
presidency. Three years later,
he challenged many long-held
standards of political assess-
ment in his book ‘‘The Presiden-
tial Character.”’

A native of Charleston,
W.Va., Barber attended the
public schools in the area before
moving to the University of
Chicago, where he received
both his B.A. and master’s
degrees. He received his Ph.D.
in political science from Yale in
1960.

From 1960 to 1972, he held a
variety of positions in Yale’s
political science division — as
professor, director of graduate
studies in politics, and associate
director of the department's
research library. In 1972 he
moved to Duke, where for the
past eight years he has been

department head and James B.
Duke Professor of Political
Science.
 

Book Review

Tom Wolfe, noted journalist
and author of the recent best-
selling The Right Stuff, will
speak in Lee Chapel on Wednes-
day, May 7 at 3:00 p.m. as part
of the Contact ’80 program.

Recognized as a master of the
non-fiction novel and_ short-
story, Wolfe is a_ self-
proclaimed proponent of the
‘‘New Journalism’’ which
blends hard-reporting and fic-
tion narrative techniques. As a
documentor of pop culture in
the ’60’s and early ’70’s, he rose
to popularity with such books as
The Kandy-Kolored Tangarine,
Flake Streamline Baby (1965)
and Ratical Chic and Man-
Maning, The Flak-Catchers
(1970). The Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test (1968), perhaps his
best known work reported on
the acid culture and Ken
Kesey’s psychadelic, freaked
out Merry Pranksters.

A native of Richmond,
Virginia, Wolfe graduated from
Washington and Lee University
(cum laude) with a B.A. in
English. While an
undergraduate, he was sports

The Right Stuff

by Channing Hall

Tom Wolfe’s recent book, The Right Stuff, is a
history of the early space program from the dar-
ing antics of the fighter test-pilots to the selection
of the first astronauts and the early Mercury
flights. The book is as smooth as his sartorial
vanilla: the free-wheeling prose reveals the essen-
tial, vibrating dazzle of Wolfe.

Wolfe supplies electricity to the work by blend-
ing the best of the novel and the analytical scholar-
ly essay with the facts of hard reporting. The
result is delightful reading.

The author gives the reader not mere descrip-
tion, but an ability to get inside, under the skin of a
‘phenomenon, and transmit its pulse.

Wolfe is fascinated by subcultures—whether
they be the acid culture of Ken Kesey, the radical
chic of Leonard Bernstein, or the elite fraternity of
hotshot Navy pilots who volunteered for the space
program.

The author attempts to find out what makes
them tick; what drives a test pilot to put his hide
on the line (almost joyfully) everyday, while
pushing a machine to its limits, or perched in a
Mercury capsule on top of a rocket.

To explain this, Wolfe formulates the theory of
“the right stuff’ — the unspoken cannon of non-
chalant cool, nerve, and ineffability that went
beyond mere bravery in the face of death.
Everyone knew what the right stuff was and who
had it, but no one actually talked about it. By prov-
ing his “‘right’’ness, one could join the elite group
and progress up the steps of the pyramid ‘“‘to join
that special few at the very top, that elite who had
the capacity to bring tears to men’s eyes, the very
Brotherhood of the Right Stuff itself.”

These were the best, the Chuck Yeagers and the
Deke Sleytons. But one could fall from the
pyramid at any step: indecision could precipitate
one’s death, and this made life at the top
dangerous. Wolfe reminds one of this fact con-

stantly by the reappearing image of testpilots’

wives awaiting news of their husbands’ deaths.
When Scott Carpenter returned from orbit early,
heedless of his fuel supply, the consensus was that
he had panicked and lost his “‘stuff.”’

Wolfe’s undertone in The Right Stuff hints that
the astronauts, especially John Glenn, became
heroes because of driving ego and personal ambi-
tion. America need heroes at that point of the Cold
War — astronauts were our last combat heros
dueling with the Russians for mastery of the
heavens. Even the press, which Wolfe describes as
‘‘an anachronistic colonial animal, a Victorian
Gent,’’ accomodated these new heroes by
overlooking their personal lives to portray them
as flying saints.

What distinguishes this book, however, is not its
subject matter, but the wild rush of Wolfe's witty
prose. It is pure fun for the reader. The barrage of
hyped vocabulary, run-on sentences, and wild
punctuation in his exclamatory journalism traps
the stream of consciousness as he imagines it in
his subjects: The reader can actually feel the
“right stuff.”’

Wolfe’s new-fangled, pop, op, ellipsed, wild-
wowie-metaphorical, over-italicized, super-
capitalized, em-dashed, vinyl-lined, gadzooks,
overlain prose is almost as outrageous as his
clothing. He grabs the reader by his lapels and
thumps the heart.

Wolfe seems to find the proper voice to describe
the brothers of the cockpit: technical jargon,
testpilot drawl, and whizbang hyperbole mixed
with a touch of nostalgia.

The Right Stuff is Tom Wolfe at his best. It
demonstrates that besides being the most spec-
tacular journalist in years, he is the master of the
non-fiction novel. In the words of Karl Shapiro:
“Tom Wolfe is more than brillant...He is more
than urbane, suave, trenchant...Tom Wolfe is a
goddam joy...Also, not to insult him, he writes like
a master.”’

pus, president Robert E.R.
Huntley presented Capt. Scott
C. Long of the school’s military
science department with the Ar-
my Commendation Medal —
Capt. Long’s third such decora-
tion for distinguished achieve-
ment.

The award was given to
recognize Long’s role in
expanding and improving the
Washington and Lee Reserve
Officer Training Corps _pro-
gram, which has nearly doubled
in enrollment during his tenure
there.

Participating in the
ceremony was Lt. Col. Thomas
B. Vaughn, professor of
military science at W&L, who
described Long as ‘the prime
architect in improving W&L’s
ROTC program.”

Long, a native of Richmond,
is a 1970 distinguished military
graduate of Virginia Tech. He
has taught at W&L since 1977,
and will remain at the universi-
ty for one more academic year.

Outdoor Production Planned

By John Wells

The Drama Department of
Washington and Lee is offering

The play was written by

Howard Richardson and
William Berney.
David Sorrells, a senior

drama major, is directing the
post-war play which, upon
description, defies singular
classification. It is, it could be
said, a fantasy-drama-romance
with elements of music and
dance. Sorrells begins directing

Film Notes

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) Frank Capra’s highly-
acclaimed political comedy/drama, with heavy doses of morality
and patriotic sentiment, made James Stewart a superstar and
earned him his first Academy Award nomination (he won the next
year for The Philadelphia Story, many believe, on the merits of the
former. This is a well-made, well-written film, often nostalgic when
seen today with young Jimmy as the wide-eyed junior senator from
Wisconsin gawking at the marble splendor of Washington and then
taking political corruption head-on. Jean Arthur, a fine actress and
comedienne, co-starred in this Columbia ‘‘A’”’ picture with an
amazing supporting cast which includes Claude Rains, Thomas
Mitchell, Guy Kibbee, Eugene Pallette, Edward Arnold, William
Demerest, Beulah Bondi, and radio announcer H. V. Kaltenborn.

The Candidate (1972) Robert Redford stars as an attractive but
unwise senatorial candidate in a role that won him scattered
praise, but which stands a disappointing distance from the rash of
Redford successes in this fruitful period of his career. With Melvyn
Douglas, as one of the seemingly countless elder statesmen he has
played in his latter-day period of character parts. To be shown at
the conclusion of Mr. Smith, which begins at 7:00 p.m., Friday
through Sunday, in Dupont Auditorium. Admission for each show-
ing will be $1.

Picnic at Hanging Rock (1977) A brilliant success by the
Australian director Peter Weir, a discussion of which appears in
this issue of the The Ring-tum Phi. Presented by the Film Society in
Lewis Hall, May 2 and 3, at 8:00 p.m. No admission is charged.

‘Picnic At Hanging Rock’

By Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Picnic at
Hanging Rock’ (Australia,
1975), directed by Peter Weir.
Weir’s movies Picnic at Hang-
ing Rock and The Last Wave
are among a number of films
from the newly emergent
Australian cinema which are
currently exciting attention and
praise in this country. Picnic
will be screened Friday and
Saturday, May 2 and 3, at 8 p.m.
in classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall.
Admission is free, and everyone
is cordially invited to attend.

Picnic at Hanging Rock has
been compared to Antonioni’s
L’Avventura (1960) in that it too
is based on a true story of a
disappearance which, like that
of the girl who vanishes from
the volcanic island in Antoni-
oni’s film, remains unsolved
and disquieting.

Picnic concerns’ the
mysterious disappearance of
several girls on their Valen-
tine’s Day picnic from Apple-
yard College in 1900. They ‘‘as-
cend’’ Hanging Rock, a geolog-
ical formation in Australia, in
an act that has both meta-
physical and sexual suggestive-
ness. One girl is later found
alive, but she has no recollec-
tion of what has become of the
others, and they are never
found.

Both Antonioni and Weir take
the mystery as an occasion for a
meditation on the emotional
and sexual nature of the sur-
rounding society. For Antoni-
oni, that sexuality, flawed by
twentieth century ennui, is arid
and futile. Weir, however, uses
the repressiveness of Austra-
lian Victorianism to give the

Met. Opera

There is good news for opera
lovers who are mourning over
the end of the 1979-80
Metropolitan Opera broadcast
season. Beginning next Sunday,
May 4, at 6 p.m., and continuing
for six successive weeks at the
same time, performances from
the Lyric Opera of Chicago may
be heard on WLUR-FM,

This marks WLUR’s first
association with the Lyric
Opera network, which may
become a familiar yearly
follow-up to the 20-week Met
series.

Leading the list of produc-
tions will be Verdi’s poignant
‘Simon Boccanegra,” starring
Sherrill Milnes. Subsequent
weeks will bring Prokofiev’s
fantasy ‘‘The Love For Three
Oranges’ May 11; Gounod’s
‘‘Faust,”’ which was televised
on PBS last January, to be
presented May 18; a new pro-

mystery a sense of both of hor-
ror and lush sensuality. The
movie is especially noted for its
visual opulence, and its beau-
tifully composed and edited
scenes.

Our last movie of the 1979-1980
season will be Federico
Fellini's Roma (Italy, 1972),
scheduled for May 16 and 17.

Generals Survive Washington Threat;

Get Placed Behind Syracuse In Poll

By Robert Massie

Under threatening, overcast
skies, the Washington and Lee
Generals battled their way
Saturday to a 9-7 victory over a
young Washington College team
on the strength of a fourth
quarter rally that broke a 5-5
tie.

The victory boosted the
General's record to 7 wins and
one loss and maintained their
undefeated record at home.

Chris Kearney again led the
team with three goals and one
assist as well as capturing
Player of the Game honors. Rob
Staugitis came up with three
assists, boosting his season's
total to 27.

The game turned out to be
surprisingly even, with a fired-
up Washington College team

forcing the Generals at every
point.

The Generals again struck
early with Geoff Brent scoring
only 26 seconds into the game.
Half a minute later Roman
Kupecky stretched the lead to
2-0 on a pass from Rob
Staugitis.

But then Washington College
came back. Shoremen fresh-
man Paul Hooper (John
Hooper's brother) tossed one in
to-cut the lead to one.

Chris Kearney then scored his
first goal unassisted, but the
Shoremen returned the favor by
scoring twice more to tie the
score after one period, 3-3.

The second quarter was a

at Wilson Field is 2:00 p.m. with

Netmen Upset

By Dale Park

The W&L varsity tennis team
began turning up for the upcom-
ing ODAC tournament,
registering two victories in
their last three matches.

On April 22, W&L faced the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers. In a

preview of things to come in the’

ODAC tourney, the Generals
cruised to an easy 8-1 victory.
Winners included senior co-
captain Stewart Jackson at first
singles, junior Peter Lovell at
number three, senior co-captain
David Constine at the fourth
flight, junior Doug Gaker at
fifth and freshman Steve Denny
at sixth.

The Generals went on to
sweep the doubles positions,
with the usual combinations of
Jackson and Lovell at the first
spot and Constine and Denny at
the second flight. Yet the third
flight doubles saw a new face,
with sophomore Wes Younge
making his first varsity ap-
pearence of the year, Younge
teamed with senior Pat Norris
for an easy 6-1, 6-4 victory.

The following day, the
Generals faced Division I

Davidson College and came
away with one of their biggest
wins of the year. W&L all but
locked up the match in the
singles competition, taking four
of the six flights, but squeaked
to a 5-4 triumph by winning only
one of the three doubles posi-
tions.

Jackson continued to play
superb tennis for the Generals,
bouncing back after losing the
first set 2-6, to take the remain-
ing two sets by the identical

day break toward the end of
February. Two years ago the
Generals travelled to Florida
for a week of practice; this
season the team flew to Ber-
muda. The Bermuda journey
cost the team $5500, all of which
was raised by the players.

scores of 6-2, 6-2, Freshman
Jack Sharman got back on the
winning track, posting a 6-4, 6-7
(5-1 tie-breaker), 6-4 victory at
second singles, while Gaker and
Denny, at the fifth and sixth
spots, stayed on the winning
track. Gaker easily dominated
his man, 6-3, 6-2, while Denny
went the distance, winning 6-2,
4-6, 6-2.

All three doubles matches
were as close as they come.
W&L's first doubles team of

by Paul Hooper, his third.

After another goal by the
Shoremen, W&L middie John
Tunney tied the score 5-5 at the
half.

After a scoreless third period,
Kearney hit his second goal to
put W&L up by one. Kupecky
then threw in his second at the
9:27 mark to put the Generals in
a comfortable 7-5 lead.

But Washington College
wouldn't let it rest at that. Paul
Hooper came back to score an
amazing fourth goal to put the
Shoremen within one.

Then the Generals put the
game away by scoring two
more consecutive goals.

First George Santos took a
feed from Kearney and tossed it
in. Then Kearney bulled his way
inside to score his third.

- captured

A final score by Washington
College gave W&L the win 9-7.

The game pitted the Generals
against the best goalie they
have faced.

‘We outshot them 49 to 29, but
their goalie blocked most of
them,’’ commented Generals
head coach Jack Emmer. ‘‘This
is the first time we had to face a
red-hot goalie, and the mark of
a good team is when you win in
games like that.”

Standouts in the game were
Kearney, John Hooper, who
14 of 19 face-offs
despite an injured shoulder, and
Rob Staugitis, who had 3
assists.

The Generals’ next home
game is this Saturday at 2 p.m.
against Rutgers University on
Wilson Field.

 

 

Soccer Club Wins Tourney

The Washington & Lee spring
soccer club, composed primari-
ly of players from the Genrals’
varisty squad, captured first
place Saturday in the Bedford
Invitational Tournament.

W&L'’s club, directed by head

soccer coach Rolf Piranian,
defeated Dabney Lancaster
Community College 8-1 and the
Valley United Club 4-1 to take
the win. Bryan Williams paced
the Generals’ attack with seven
goals in the games.

 

Jackson and Lovell fell 7-6 (5-2
tie-breaker) in the third set,
while the third flight team of
Constine and Denny went down
7-5 in the third. Yet the
Generals’ second doubles com-
gination of Gaker and Norris,
after losing the closest possible
first set (6-7 (4-5 tie-breaker) ),
came roaring back to win the
next two sets 6-2, 6-3, and
secured W&L’s 5-4 victory.
Although the Generals lost 7-2
to powerful Division I UVa. on

Davidson, Lose To UVa.

Apr. 25, the day was highlighted
by Stewart Jackson's wins boty
in singles (winning 7-5, 6-1), and
in doubles (teaming with Lovell
for a narrow 5-7, 7-6 (5-4 tie-
breaker), 7-6 (5-3 tie-breaker )
win). Other highpoints included
Gaker taking his man to three
sets, and close losses by both
Lovell and Sharman at singles,
all good indications that the
Generals should continue their
dominance in the ODAC this
year.

 

Over 28 runners braved a
cold, rainy and _ otherwise
miserable morning to run in the
Blue Ridge Classic’ held last
Saturday in Lexington.

The ten kilometer (6.2 miles)
race, formerly known as the
Ring-tum Phi Road Race, was
held to raise funds for the
Muscular Dystrophy Founda-
tion. According to Gerald Dar-

rell, director of the race and
head of W&L's food services,
donations from local merchants
and registration fees totalled

over $500.

From this total, however, has
to be subtracted the cost for 100
t-shirts which were given to
runners and race workers. Dar-
rell said that the race should
end up netting over $270.

Dean Greer, a law student at
W&L, won the men’s race by
covering the course in a time of
33:30.68. Phil Bishop and Mike
Bartini finished second and
third in the men’s division.

In the women's race, Carol
Phemister was the winner.
Overall, the classic was divided
into several age-group races
and a one-mile ‘fun run.”’

Blue Ridge Classic Raises Over $270

Despite the inciement
weather, many of the runners
were not at all disappointed.
“This was one of the better
races I’ve run in’’ said Bishop.

Darrell was likewise pleased
with the race but frustrated
over the weather. ‘‘We have the
resources to run a race,”’ said
the director, ‘‘but we can’t
seem to pick the right
weekend.”

 

 

 

 
Generals’ Ellis Leading
Team, ODAC In Hitting

By Chris Sisto
The baseball Generals were a
victim of politics this year when
it came time to select times for
the ODAC championship tour-
nament.

Last year it only took four
wins to make the tournament
and the Generals fell two wins
short of the mark. This year the
minimum number of wins was
upped to six.

So with a 5-8 record in ODAC
play the team’s only game last
week against Lynchburg Col-
lege, unbeaten in league play,
was very important.

When it was all over Lynch-
burg proved to be too much of a
match winning 13-3. The
Generals managed to get 10 hits
but they just couldn’t hold down
their opponent’s powerful of-
fense.

There are several positive
notes on this year’s season.

The team’s batting average
continues to rise and is much
higher than last year’s mark.
They have played seven less
games than last year at this
time, but already have eleven
more extra base hits.

   

The
ODAC.

On a personal note,
sophomore team captain, Thad
Ellis, the best batting average
in the ODAC with a mark of
.412. Freshman Chris Cavalline
is eighth in the league with a
.345 average.

So with a 509 record the

nerals’ Thad Ellis, holder of the best batting avera

Generals have a chance at a

They have four games tert on
the schedule and will play two

header Saturday against, a

College with a total of 47 points.

Leading the Generals were
three individual champions.
Senior and tri-captain Rich Bird
won the one-mile race, junior R.
J. Scaggs won his 400-meter
race and sophomore Mike
Fogarty won the javelin throw.

Over Spring Break, the

Generals finished second in a
four-way meet also held at
Roanoke. Once again, the top
individual performers for the
Generals were Scaggs, Fogarty
and Bird.

W&L, which finished second
behind Lynchburg by a total ot
84 points to 68.5 points.

Other strong finishers for the
track team this season include
W&L’s one-mile and 440-yard
relay teams. The Generals have
posted a time of 3:31.6 in the
mile relay (second best in the
conference) and have run the
440 relay in a time of 44.1
seconds (also second best in the
conference).

Golf Team Ups
Record To 11-1

A first-place finish in a five-
way meet with Lynchburg,
Randolph-Macon, Ha _ den-
Sydney, Longwood and Ferrum
improved the Washington & Lee
golf team’s record to 11-1.

The Generals were led by
sophomore Jim Kaplan, who
posted a low score of 69.
Overall, the Generals shot an
18-hole total of 369, seven
strokes ahead of second place
finisher Lynchburg.

Currently, Bill Alfano has the
lowest average on the team,
shooting an average of 77.7 per
round. Kaplan has the next
lowest average at 78.4. Senior
and captain Gerry Barousse is
posting an average of 80 per 18
holes.

Barousse’s lowest total so far
has been a 74, while his highest
score is a 90). Both kaplan and
Barousse have the lowest
scores this year for one round.

Despite Confusion, Generals Should Be In The Tournament

By Bill Whalen

You can feel it in the air
around the campus. All the talk
about the lacrosse team has
switched from not whether it
will make the playoffs but to
whom it will play in the first
round. Such talk makes sense,
but the campus should not be
lulled into a sense of security
until the final bids have gone
out.

The reason for not trying to
guess the Generals’ opponent in
the tournament quarterfinals:
it is too early to make any type
of educated guess as to where
the Generals will be seeded and
how the other seven teams will
be placed.

I may eventually hate myself
for saying this, but the Generals
will qualify for this year’s tour-
nament. That is, if some type of
disaster does not occur in the
next three weeks. The reason
why I am going out on a limb:
look at the remaining schedule.

irst, you start with Rutgers,
ranked 13th in the nation this
week. The combination of the
Generals being a better team
and the game being played in
Lexington (or B.V. if you want a
guaranteed win) should get
W&L through this one.

The following Wednesday, the
Generals travel to Roanoke to
face the Maroons. When it plays
W4&L in lacrosse, Roanoke is the

proverbial pea in the show. But
once again, it is not the caliber
of the Generals. Besides, the
Maroons are in the midst of an
off year in which they will pro-
bably not qualify for a post-
season playoff spot.

Which brings us to North
Carolina. The Tar Heels are the
only team to beat Virginia, but
are not that same team. Since
the 14-5 cakewalk, the Heels
have lost to Maryland, UMBC
(the nation’s top Division II
team) and N.C. State. The com-
bination of last year’s loss to
U.N.C. and playing in Lex
should give W&L the edge.

Finally, we come to Hofstra.
The Dutchmen are another of

those spoiler teams but are not,
on paper, the same caliber of
team as W&L. This is a key
game, however, because it
would (A) be a victory on the
road and (B) a win over a jinx
team. A victory over Hofstra
would be the ideal way to gain
playoff momentum.

When compared to the rest of
the top-ranked teams, W&L is in
a rather secure position. In the
current top five, Virginia
finishes out this Saturday in a
non-game at Virginia Tech,
Johns Hopkins travels to Navy
on Saturday, Syracuse has to
play Massachusetts, and Navy
has to play Hopkins and then,

So between now and later, the
seedings could once again be
restructured. And for the mo-
ment, only one thing seems to
be certain, Virginia will be the
tournament's top-seeded team.
Under the ‘Hoos will be seven
teams whose name and order
cannot and should not be tried
to be determined.

But if they win the rest of
their games, the Generals will
more than likely be placed in

IFC President Briscoe
Sees Upswing For Future

by Richard Moss

Monte Briscoe, newly-elected
president of next year’s IFC,
says that he forsees ‘‘positive
signs and better trends”’ for the
IFC next year, although he also
says that he doesn’t forsee any
major changes over this year’s
IFC.

Briscoe, a junior majoring in
politics and a member of the
PiKA social fraternity, said
that while ‘‘I thought there were
some good ideas’ in Jim
Fineman’s’ proposed’ IFC
charter published in the Mar. 6
issues of the Phi that, ‘I don’t
think the problems with the IFC
are the result of a poor constitu-
tion.”’

Briscoe said recently that he
feels the most important thing
for the IFC next year will be to

W&L Debate Team Squares Off Against Russians

The American reaction to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
forces ‘‘a pretext of a Soviet
military threat,’ said Alexis
Kruglov, a Russian graduate
student said last Thursday
night in Lee Chapel.

Kruglov was here as part of a
debate series in the United
States. His presentation stress-
ed the peaceful spirit of the
Soviet people. “*The Soviet peo-
ple want to live in peace,” he
said,

But the debate was not a
discussion of current affairs.
Both sides focused on the role of
the individual to the state.
However, the questioning
period following presentations

Playboy magazine has caus-
ed quite a stir at Baylor Univer-
sity in Waco, Tex.

The magazine is doing
another of their photo sections,
this one is called ‘‘Girls of the

But the president of the Bap-
tist college, Abner McCall, de-
nounced the magazine as ‘‘a
representation of Northern
sleaze,’’ and warned Baylor
women not to pose in the buff.
Expulsion was hinted as a
possibility for those who do.

The editors of the campus
newspaper, The Lariat, criticiz-

editorial, prompting him to
order that all future editorials
would have to be cleared

uncleared editorial protesting
the new guidelines.

The university’s publications
board, acting on the president’s
recommendation, fired Barton,
the city editor, and the news
editor.

‘Historically and_ legally
freedom of the press has always
been the freedom of the
publisher,’’ McCall said. ‘‘This
constitutional freedom does not
belong to the editors or
reporters employed by the
publisher.”

Since that time the following
has happened: One professor
has resigned in protest of the
way the university handled the
affair; Barton was offered a job
at the local daily newspaper;
and Playboy is going ahead
with the project. (The magazine
has also offered free legal aid to
any students who pose. )

“take a strong stand on the
issues, instead of compromising
all the time.”’

Briscoe noted however, that
he did not intend for this state-
ment to reflect upon any
previous IFC administrations,
and went on to say, ‘Certainly
some compromises need to be
made, but we should have the
weight and influence to further
our goals.”’

In keeping with this, Briscoe
said that he ‘‘will be strict with
fines and infractions,’’ and that
he will ask the IFC judicial
board to do the same. “The IFC
laws should be followed by all,
not just some,” Briscoe added.

One of his biggest duties as
IFC president will be in the area
of public relations, Briscoe
feels. He said that Syd Farrah
(current IFC president) has
started a good community rela-
tions effort, and that he plans to
continue that trend.

As for the faculty, Briscoe
says that while he feels. the
fraternities as a group have
been ‘‘over-discriminated
against lately,”’ that encourag-
ing signs such as the IFC-
members higher GPA overall,
would put the IFC in ‘‘a better
bargaining position.”

Briscoe also said, however,
that he would try ‘‘a little more
understanding of the faculty
viewpoint’’ and added that ‘‘I
am going to do my best to
understand the faculty because
it is good to hear all sides of the
issue, even from the more
outspoken members of the
faculty.”

Faculty problems with the
IFC seem to be ‘‘fizzling out”’ in
Briscoe’s opinion, though, and
he says he hopes that trend will
continue, and that the faculty
will respect a stronger and
more judicially strict IFC.

One of Briscoe’s objectives
for next year is the formation of
a food co-op among the frater-
nities. He said that while this
idea was still in the planning
stages, such a program would
provide a ‘financial stability”
which many of the fraternities
need.

The IFC president said that
he would appoint a small com-
mittee to work on the idea over
the summer, but that in any
event if a co-op were to be
started, the management of the
project ‘‘should be solely in the
hands of the IFC.”

Briscoe added that he also
looks forward to fewer frater-
nities taking out major loans,
improving the financial situa-
tion of the fraternities as a
whole.

Another objective is ‘‘more
active participation at the
grass-roots level of the IFC by
fraternity members.” ,

Briscoe added that, ‘‘I think
the frats in general are on an
upswing—I am looking forward
to a good year and a smooth
path.”
(continued from page 1)

Prof. Griffith Discusses

than in the actuality. Certainly there are many
students who continue to speak, like they always
have, but not nearly as many as in the past.

‘‘In the recent years I have had many students,
students whom I have taught, pass by without the
slightest recognition of my existence. The reason
that this bothers me is not that a tradition has been
broken, after all, we probably have some tradi-
tions that should be destroyed.

‘But I look on speaking as a simple symbol peo-
ple have of recognizing those whom they are
associated with in a common pursuit. I speak to
you, even if I don’t know you, simply to say to you
that I recognize that you are a student and I am an
instructor, and we are both seeking the truth
together.

‘‘T can’t do my job without you and you can’t do
your job without me. We are partners, fellows, and
I think that is all that speaking involves. When this
tradition breaks down, when a student passes
without speaking, I feel that this reflects an at-
titude of ‘I don’t need you any more...I have used
you as much as I can and I discard you.’ I am hurt,
so to speak, by this in terms of an atmosphere that
I once enjoyed and an atmosphere that I see
dissipating very quickly.”’

Jim Feinman is a Ring-tum Phi staff writer and
wrote this story for the July issue of the W&L Aamni
magazine,

Dr. Griffith also has misgivings concerning re-
cent decisions of the administration and faculty,
although he hastens to explain that his criticism is
offered in a constructive spirit. ‘‘I want it clearly
understood by everyone that my 34 years here
have been a delightful experience,

‘‘T think the proof of that is during those years, I
never made a serious attempt to find another
job,”’ he said. “‘I have been totally committed to
this University and totally happy in my work. But
there are flaws in the job we are doing, myself in-
cluded, and while I don’t wish to appear complete-
ly negative, I think it is necessary to speak out on
these things.”

One area of criticism that Dr. Griffith offers is
in the major requirements and in the distribution
of courses each student must achieve. ‘‘In the past
ten years we have made graduation from
Washington and Lee easier. We have reduced the
requirements for graduation by two courses. It is
possible for a student to receive a Bachelor of Arts
Degree without ever taking an English course, a
mathematics course, or a history course.

‘“‘For a man to have a B.A. degree who cannot
say that ‘I have had at least one course in British
or American literature, or in the history of my
country; is almost like saying to a medical student
‘We award you a medical degree but you don’t
have to study anatomy.’”’

The school calendar and the placement of vaca-
tions is another matter of concern with Dr. Grif-
fith. ‘‘We have a system in which we almost pro-
vide a week of vacation after six weeks in the
classroom,”’ he said. ‘‘We interrupt the continuity
of the program by interspersing it with holidays.

“When we break the continuity of the
classroom, it breaks the chain of thought and cer-
tainly detracts from the kind of work that comes
by maintaining a long period of class attendance.
As an illustration, one of the reasons we went to
the three-term system with examinations before
Christmas was to avoid that two-week period of
holidays in which the momentum was lost before

 

exams.

 
 
 

 

   

he
“I heartily agreed with that decision, but look
what we have done now. We give a whole week’s
vacation before the Christmas exams, again
creating the type of problem that we were trying
to solve.”’

Dr. Griffith has noticed some changes in his
students over the years. Of his present students he
says, ‘‘Generally, the students want to learn, they
are interested in the work that I try to teach. But
the problem that I have with students is a basic
lack of industry in their willingness to discipline
their minds, to discipline their habits, to exert that
kind of initiative that they have to exert to reach
their maximum achievement.

“Of course there are still some excellent
students and there are some poor students, but
this would be my overall appraisal. I think the

students today have had a too easy life for them to
display this type of industry of which I am speak-
ing. Their general attitude is not ‘How much can I
produce’ but rather ‘How much can I consume.’ ”

Dr. Griffith feels that this problem is not without
remedy. ‘I think that this University has to pro-
vide even greater scholarship aid than it is
presently offering. We must be able to go into the
academic market and say to any industrious,
conscientious, ambitious boy from the poorest
economic background, ‘We want you at
Washington and Lee.’ And if that boy says he can’t
handle the financial aspects we can then say,
‘Don’t worry about the expenses, you can have
scholarship aid and receive the benefits of the fine
faculty and facilities that we have. ‘I think that if
we did more of this it would benefit those boys who
are not quite as industrious, but whose fathers can
afford to send them here, not to mention the
benefit the underprivileged boy would receive as
well.”’

Of his upcoming retirement, Professor Griffith
says, “It isa sad experience, although not as sad
as I anticipated. After such a long and pleasant ex-
perience there is always a certain sadness, but to
be quite honest, I am tired. I don’t like to go to the
classroom and teach when I feel that I wish I
didn’t have to go this morning. I don’t think that is
fair to the students or to me. I think the time has
come when we need new ideas from younger peo-
ple trained in a manner different from that in
which I was trained. I believe the department will
benefit from this, ‘new blood’, so to speak.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The UC Choice

At last there will be an election on this campus with
some genuine competition and choice. No less than 15
students applied for positions on next year’s Universi-
ty Council. The UC has gained in importance and will
probably be the battleground for the next war over
students’ rights at Washington and Lee.

This year has seen a faculty proposal made to not
only ban live bands from fraternities on weeknights
but also from appearing in the Cockpit. This proposal
was really an outgrowth of the faculty’s objection to
weeknight parties in general, but it is significant that
it was in the University Council where the issue was
raised and debated. Once again the UC is becoming
the important deliberative body it once was. No
longer is it restricted to discussion of the university
calendar and faculty EC minutes.

A broad range of personalities is represented on
Monday’s UC election ballot. The strongest can-
didates must be chosen because the UC, limited as it
is with no actual power, is the only forum where
students can express their viewpoints and have an op-
portunity to determine the outcome. We can petition
the faculty or the board of trustees, but only on the UC
are we given the chance to vote effectively and pro-
tect our diminishing freedoms. The student body’s
representatives must be capable and willing to take a
firm stand and stop the erosion of student rights at
W&L.

Use your vote wisely on Monday.

Mad Money

Eight months ago all the student organizations
were asked to tighten their belts because student
funds were less than the budgetary requests. Some
groups, like the W&L fencing club, got barely enough
money to survive. But the budget was tight—we were
told—and we were all supposed to bite the bullet
together (misery likes company?” ).

Well, the EC gave its long-awaited yearly financial
statement Monday night and guess what? The student
government has over $9,000 to play with in its ‘‘Stu-
dent Body Reserve Fund Account’’—$9,607.28, to be
exact. The EC has been very stingy with this money,
‘orcing everyone to undertake austerity measures. In
‘act, this account now has almost $200 more in it that
it did back in August.

With only one month remaining in the school year,
we were wondering what about the fate of all that nice
cash now collecting dust in the vault. Most organiza-
tions stopped borrowing large emergency funds from
the account in October. The largest withdrawal since
then has been $100 (which was repaid) — hardly a
justification for maintaining a $9,000 balance. The
money will not be needed next year because a wind-
fall of cash will come out of a legal defense fund
escrow account now maintained in case the Student
Activities Board is sued over last spring’s aborted
Firefall concert.

So, it looks like it may be time for a few needy
organizations to make another pilgrimage to the EC
room. There’s no need to let that money go to waste
and non-profit organizations don’t require a surplus,
now do they?

Opening The Door A Crack

THE STUDENT BODY EXECUTIVE COMMIT-
TEE has been very busy this week revising
Washington and Lee’s honor system. The commit-
tee has been appropriately deliberative
throughout this annual ritual of changing the
White Book. And as usual, few significant changes
have been made; it has been mostly a process of
closing the gaps that became apparent in the
course of two open honor hearings.

Out of 23 proposed changes, over half failed or
were withdrawn from consideration. Among the
most significant revisions passed were those
which allow a transcript of testimony given at the
private honor hearing to be used at the open public
trial. One of the proposals states the matter quite
explicitly: “‘If...it appears...that the testimony of
that witness differs significantly from his
testimony given in the private hearing, the person
questioning the witness may approach the Chair-
man and call this fact to his attention.”

Admitting testimony given in the private hear-
ing is a significant change in procedure in the
honor system with ominous overtones— ominous
for what it implies. It implies that the testimony
given in.the last open honor trial was indeed dif-
ferent from that given during the closed honor
hearing (testimony given during the EC honor
hearing was not admissible in the recent open stu-
dent body hearing). If this is true—and we may
never know for sure—then Washington and Lee's
honor system is in serious trouble. Evidence of the
shaky foundation on which our honor system now
rests became evident in the course of the meeting
to change the White Book in both the proposed
changes and the comments made by several EC
members.

Consider this sampling of statements by EC
members:

—Jay Blumberg (senior EC rep.)
honor code may be in trouble.”
‘We've been elected to do a job and we should do it
despite the fact that we've been slapped down by
the student body,’’ Dee Keesler (senior EC rep. )
said in reference to the last open honor trial.
—John Fraser (law school EC rep.) - ‘It is my opi-
nion that the honor system no longer functions at
the law school.”’

THERE WAS ALMOST AN AIR OF PARANOLA
in the EC room Monday night—concern for both
the EC’s own image on campus and for the future

- “] think the

of the honor system. Many have sensed for a long
time that the honor system is in trouble, but it is
only now that our officials elected to uphold the
system are admitting it publicly. Such an admis-
sion is significant and disheartening. That is why
this year’s White Book changes are so important.

Most of the changes proposed to shore up the
honor system have come from law school
representative John Fraser. One of his proposed
changes was to eliminate the ‘‘single sanction,” or
permanent dismissal from the university for con-
viction of an honor offense. This revolutionary
proposal was made as a result of Fraser’s assess-
ment that the honor code does not work in the law
school because no one wants to be responsible for
booting a fellow student out of school and ruining
his career. It failed 2-10.

THE MOST INTRIGUING CHANGE was to
allow “‘observers’’ to view the closed proceedings.
Many on the committee seemed to like the idea of
opening the door a little to allow some of us:on the
outside to view the now secret proceedings. But
there was disagreement as to who the three
observers should be—friends of the accused or
randomly chosen students. Although the
“observer’’ proposal failed 3-9, there does seem
hope for a compromise solution which would allow
the honor process to be opened slightly—but only
at the discretion of the accused. An opening of the
honor system can only strengthen and improve it
by making students more aware of its pervasive
impact on this campus. The EC should reconsider
this important proposal and vote to allow
observers in the now closed EC hearings. Only
then will the students begin to regain respect for
this institution and for the manner in which the EC
tries to uphold it.

There was an obvious tone of frustration and
disillusionment in the comments made by several
EC members Monday night. But there was also a
sense of determination to preserve the system. We
are fortunate that this year's EC is so dedicated to
conscientiously carrying out its appointed duties.
A slightly open trial would ensure fairness in the
proceedings and dispel any lingering doubts in
students’ minds about the EC's motives and con-
duct during private honor hearings. The
“observer proposal is one whose time has
come—it should be implemented, before it is too
late.

Proposed EC White Book Changes

Proposal A
1. The student will be expelled = the University
for at least a period of one year. 2. Anytime after
the expiration of the year the ales may petition
once for readmission to the University.

FAILED - 2-10
submitted by: John Fraser

debate (Fraser): ‘It is my opinion that the honor
system no longer functions at the law school.”’
Students are unwilling to report honor offenses
because the student reported may be thrown out of
school.

(Allen) - ‘This is one of the few single sanction
honor systems left in the country, and if people
aren't going to turn in honor violators, then the
system isn’t working.’

Proposal E
“The hearing shall be closed to all but the
following persons: Executive Committee
members, witnesses, the accused and his ad-

visors, and up_to three members of the
Washington and Lee student body designated as
observers, The students present as observers shall
be removed from the hearing if any of them inter-
rupt the proceeding in any fashion. A potential
witness may not be an observer. The observers
shall not be permitted to take notes or record the
proceeding in any other manner.”’

FAILED - 3-9
submitted by: John Fraser
voting in favor: Fraser, Blumberg, Allen

debate: (Fraser) - ‘If a student wants to bring ina
reporter from the Ring-tum Phi, that is his
business.”

(Blumberg) - ‘‘I think the honor code may be in
trouble. The more we can show how the pro-
ceedings are conducted, the more people will
realize that we don’t try to go after people.”’

Dee Keesler and Les Cotter worried about the ac-
cused bringing in three friends who might spread
rumors after the trial about the accused (Keesler)
- “The motive of this proposal is to legitimize
honor proceedings. We've been elected to do a job
and we should do it despite the fact that we've
been slapped down by the student body (reference
to the last open honor trial). Passing this proposal
would show that the EC is too insecure about its
own proceedings and that’s why (the proposal)
sucks.”’

(Blumberg) - ‘‘What better observers can we have
than three friends of the accused? If they say (the
proceeding) was a fair honor hearing, people will
be sure it was fair.”

Proposal G

‘*...(The accused) shall be told that the testimony
given during the course of the hearing, including
that of the accused, will be recorded. A transcript
of this recording will be made available for use by
the EC advocates, the accused and his advisors,
and the Chairman in the event a Student Body
hearing is requested.”’

PASSED - unanimous
submitted by: Cove Geary

Proposal L
“If a student is found guilty in either an EC
Hearing or a Student Body Hearing a notation will
be made on the student’s official transcript that
the student left the University as the result of an
Honor Violation.”

FAILED - 1-11
submitted by: Jay Blumberg

debate: (Blumberg) - ‘‘This school has an obliga-
tion to other schools to tell them that the student
left W&L as a result of an honor violation.”
(Wenke) - ‘I don’t think we should persecute so-
meone their whole life.”’

Persiflage

(Blumberg) - ‘My purpose is not to persecute but
to inform future employers about his character.”
(Wenke) - ‘Our only purpose here is to ensure that
an atmosphere of trust exists in W&L’s society,
not to be concerned with his later life.”

Proposal S$

“If, in the course of questioning a witness, it ap-
pears to an EC advocate, the accused, or his ad-
visors that the testimony of that witness differs
significanUJy_{rom bis testimovy_given in the
private hearing, the person questioning the
witness may approach the Chairman and call this
fact to his attention. The Chairman shall compare
the transcript with the allegedly inconsistent
testimony and rule on the admissibility of the
evidence of the testimony given in the private
hearing. The accused is considered a witness if he
choses to testify.”
PASSED
submitted by: Cove Geary; amended by John
Fraser
proposal refers to last open honor trial

debate: (Geary) - ‘‘I want to maintain a consisten-
cy between the two hearings. When there is an ob-
vious change in testimony, as if it’s intentional,
then the earlier testimony should be available.”’

 

Support The Rites Of Spring

I hate to draw down upon myself the rath of
W&L’s large feminist population, but I must print
the truth in the best traditions of journalism,
yellow or otherwise.

There occurs every spring a rather amazing
phenomenon among the surrounding girl’s
schools. After years of fastidiously guarding their
vaunted reputations, the graduating seniors of our
neighboring sister schools realize the error of
their ways and attempt to rectify the situation as
rapidly and rabidly as possible.

While some might argue that the only reason to
take note of this annual purging of virtue is in
order that one might take full advantage of the
situation, I believe that there are other reasons to
study the development.

It appears that, to the practicioners of this rite
of spring, virtue is not an end in itself. Rather, the
preserving of one’s virtue is seen as merely the ac-
cepted way of achieving some degree of respect
from the opposite sex. Deep down, except for those

      

who were brought up on a strict diet ot the nur -
rors’’ of the human body, females have the same
desires as we nasty old boys.

It seems rather ridiculous that we deny
ourselves the pleasure of each other’s physical
charm solely for the purpose of perpetuating a
social hoax. We are not total lechers and they are

~ not bundles of sugar and spice.

I propose that we throw off the burden of this
hypocrisy.

The women of the area should blaze a trail of
openness that will act as an example to the women
of the nation. They should openly and freely show
their common bond with their fellow male
students by joining together with us in the beauty
of physical pleasure.

However, time is short. We must act as quickly
as possible to perform as many of these unions as
possible before the onslaught of summer.

Women of the world unite! You have nothing to
lose and a lot of meaningful relationships to gain!

EC Hears Monthly Reports

(continued from page 1)

In other business Monday
night, the EC made a little pro-
gress on its investigation of
ticket scalping and recom-
mended to the Student Activi-
ties Board and the University
Center Committee that infor-
mation should be printed on
tickets sold in the future that
scalpers should be turned in.

“The realities of the world
are that if you allow people to
buy large blocks of tickets,
someone will scalp them,”’ said
law school representative Sam
Allen. He suggested more con-
trol over ticket sales and that

Notice

The student body Executive
Committee is now accepting ap-
plications for the positions of
student member-at-large on the
faculty EC.

‘T think it’s very important to
have two students on the com-
mittee because it deals with stu-
dent concerns,’ EC _ vice-
president Les Cotter said.

The vacancy is senior Tony
Carli’s. Carli is away from the
university for the spring term.

ticket purchases be limited.

“There's really not a whole
lot we can do to stop it (scalp-
ing),’’ said Jamie Small, UCC
chairman. (The UCC provides
entertainment for the Cockpit. )

The EC hopes the warning
that scalpers will be turned in
will reduce the resale of enter-
tainment tickets for profit.

Channing Hall, co-chairman
of the Contact committee,
reported that the group has
$3,946 remaining in its budget
and that plans are now under-
way for bringing the Contact
program's last speaker to cam-
pus on May 21 or 22.

John Hamilton, business
manager of the Calyx, said that
the yearbook should be in ‘‘the

predicted that the book would
make a profit this year.

Guy Steuart of the Mock Con-
vention committee reported
that the $1,500 ‘‘elephant fund”’
has raised $900 to date.

He said that the committee is
having no budget problems for

tion.

Warner Leads Parade

U.S. Senator John W. Warner of Virginia will
lead the traditional Mock Convention Parade, to
be held on Friday morning, May 9. As parade mar-
shal, Warner will be the Mock Convention’s ‘‘good-
will’’ ambassador to the community and the na-
tion. In this post, he joins the list of notables that
includes William Brock in 1968, Andrew Miller in
1972, and Henry Howell in 1976.

Warner graduated from Washington and Lee in
1949 and is on the University’s Board of Trustees.
He participated in the Mock Convention in 1948
and has been active in his support of the event
since his graduation.

Born on February 18, 1927, in Washington, D.C.,
Warner received his early education in the public
schools there. After a tour of active military ser-
vice in the U.S. Navy, Warner entered Washington
and Lee in 1946. He majored in general engineer-
ing courses, physics and mathematics, and receiv-
ed his B.S. degree in June 1949. In September of
that year he entered the School of Law at the
University of Virginia. His law training was inter-
rupted for a second tour of active military service,

GOP Elephant |

this time with the United States Marines in Korea.
At the end of his tour he returned to U.Va. and
graduated from the law school with an LL.B.
degree in 1953.

Warner’s political activity began with the Nixon
campaign of 1960. In 1969, he was appointed Under
Secretary of the Navy by Nixon, then in 1972, he
was nominated and approved as the Secretary of
the Navy. President Ford appointed Warner to
coordinate the nation’s bicentennial celebrations
in 1975, and following the successful completion of
this assignment, Warner returned to private life in
Virginia.

Last year, he was elected to the Senate from
Virginia over Democrat Andrew P. Miller. He has
been active in the Senate, with special efforts to
limit the role of the federal government and con-
trol federal spending.

Sen. John W. Warner’s experience and leader-
ship qualities will add to the convention's authen-
ticity and help to bring it to the notoriety it
deserves as being, in the words of Newsweek, “the
most realistic’’ event of its kind in the nation.

Since 1933, the fabled hitch
has been thundering its way
around America, appearing at
parades, festivals, rodeos and
shopping centers from coast to
coast.

Ancestor to the noble steed
which bore warriors to battle in
the Crusades, more recently of
Scottish descent, the Clydesdale
was declining in numbers when
August A. Busch, Jr. acquired a
team to celebrate the repeal of
prohibition.

In the early days of American
brewing, it was said that a
brewer’s success was determin-
ed by how far his draught
horses could pull their sudsy
load in a day’s time.
Horsepower went under the
hood after World War I; that
and packaging innovations
made two things obsolete: local
beers and the horses that pulled
them to market. The Clydesdale
breed seemed to face a bleak
future.

Today, in comparison, they
flourish. What began 43 years
ago as a ceremonial gesture has
become breeding science. At
Grant’s Farm in suburban St.
Louis County, nearly 100
champion-sired pure breds
roam in picturesque pastures

By Guy Steuart

Leading this year’s
calvalcade of floats, marching
bands, and dignitaries in the
traditional Mock Convention
parade this May 9th is one of the
co-stars of the upcoming movie
Smokey and the Bandit Part II.

No, it’s not Burt Reynolds or
Sally Fields, but rather the 10-
foot-tall African elephant and
representative mascot of the
G.O.P., Jewel. Jewel will head
the pageant which proceeds
down Main Street, turning on to
Washington Street and continu-
ing on Route 60 up to Liberty
Hall Field, where she will be on
display to the public.

Securing the services of an
elephant — not to mention a
famous one — is more frus-
trating, baffling and costly than
procuring the use of its Demo-

cratic counterpart. Every type
of establishment which had
even the slightest chance of ren-
ting an elephant had been con-
tacted since September. Mock
Convention Co-chairman Dick
Schoenfeld said ‘‘every time I
received a flat rejection from
one person, I’d ask if I could be
referred to atiyone who might
be able to helps in our search.
Finally our efforts paid off
when we discovered that Jewel
would be passing by Lexington
around the time of the Conven-
tion.”’

To help raisé the money to
pay Jewel and her trainer’s fee,
the Mock Convention initiated
an elephant fund. Contributions

adjacent to what was once the
spread of America’s 18th presi-
dent. They comprise the largest
band of Clydesdales in the na-
tion.

Between 20 and 30 Clydesdale
foals are born at Grant’s Farm
each year. Standards are
demanding. All hitch horses are
at least three years of age.
Each must stand approximate-
ly 18 hands high, be bay in color,
have four white stockings and
feet, a blaze of white on the face
plus a black mane and tail.

Two eight-horse hitch teams
— one based in St. Louis, the
other in Merrimack, New
Hampshire — travel the U.S.,
logging about 40,000 miles and
300 appearances yearly;
answering the question of how
the Clydesdales can show up in
Miami’s Orange Bowl Parade
on New Year’s Eve and appear
fresh and appropriately regal in
the next day’s Tournament of
Roses procession in Pasadena.

Transporting the Clydesdales
is itself a mammoth undertak-
ing. The horses travel in style,
befitting their designation as
“The King’s Steeds.’’ Each en-
tourage includes three 40-by-8
foot vans with air cushion

PARKING
RULES

As you know the Mock Con-
vention gets underway this Fri-
day with the parade down Main
Street. The loss of parking
along Main and Washington
Streets and the influx of over
1,000 alumni and numerous
spectators will create a severe
parking problem,

We request that the Universi-
ty community make use of
parking along Letcher Avenue
and Dupont Hall thereby leav-
ing the lots around Doremus
Gymnasium free for alumni
and press. We would also re-
quest that if possible you walk,
bike or carpool on Friday.

Thank you for your coopera-
tion in this matter and we hope
that you will join us during the
weekend at all the activities.
le
Senator Warner will appear in the parade.

Goldwater To Deliver Keynote Address

Barry M. Goldwater Jr., four-term Senate
verteran and patriarch of the Republican Party,
will preside at the 1980 Washington and Lee Mock
Republican Convention next May 9th and 10th.

Washington and Lee is familiar territory to the
Arizona-Senator — the connection goes back to
1964, when student delegates at the 13th Mock Con-
vention correctly predicted that Goldwater would
be selected as the Republican Party’s nominee for
the presidency.

First elected to the Senate from the Grand Ca-
nyon State in 1952, Goldwater’s first business ex-
perience was in a highly successful, family-owned
general merchandise firm. His bid for the Oval Of-
fice came at a time of great popular sympathy for
the Democratic party and its fallen hero, John
Kennedy, as well as the challenge of upsetting a
powerful incumbent in Lyndon Johnson. As a
result, he suffered what was then the worst
margin of defeat — 16 million votes — in presiden-
tial election history.

During his campaign, Goldwater advocated
basic — and extremely conservative — themes
time and again. That immorality runs rampant in
government, that the federal government is too
powerful and meddlesome in private affairs, that
the nation’s defenses are gradually decaying into
an alarming condition, that the Johnson ad-
ministration’s foreign policy followed a line of ap-
peasement and failure — all these were expanded
in the months before the election.

His continued emphasis on the preservation of
individual freedoms didn’t win him many votes —
except in the South — but his determination to
place honesty before politics and maintain an un-
popular stand for what he deemed just are still
considered major factors contributing to his
respected position today.

Columnists were quick to criticize Goldwater
after his presidential defeat, claiming he not only
lost the election but the entire conservative cause

as well. They maintained that he had splintered
the Republican party for years to come and
declared strongly that he would never be recogniz-
ed as a national party spokesman-leader again.

But time decreed otherwise — Goldwater was
welcomed back to the Senate with an enthusiastic
vote in 1968, a victory that was repeated in 1974. At
the age of 70, he is once more the dominant figure
in the Grand Old Party, though the years may
have mellowed some of those rigidly conservative
attitudes and changed his image to one of sage
reflection.

Senator Goldwater’s appearance will make this
his second visit to the W&L campus in three years.
As Mock Convention keynoter, he joins a most
distinguished list that includes Sen. Alben
Barkley, Sen. William Proxmire, then-Gov. Jim-
my Carter, and Harry S. Truman.

(Traditionally, the keynote speaker is a promi-
nent leader of the party out of executive power,
His speech is designed to spark the crowd of
delegates, press and gallery observers with a
spirig of convention exhilaration and political
pride. )

Goldwater was born in Phoenix, Arizona Ter-
ritory. He was educated in public schools of
Phoenix and Staunton Military Academy in
Virginia. He attended the University of Arizona
for one year, and served during World War II in
the China-Burma-India theatre. He is a retired
Major General in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He
began his political career in 1949 when he was
elected to the City Council of Phoenix on the
reform ticket.

He currently serves on several Senate commit-
tees, including the Armed Services Committee,
the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee
(now called the Commerce, Science and Transpor-
tation Committee) and the Select Committee on
Intelligence, on which he is now the senior
Republican member.

respective states.

An added duty for these
dedicated individuals is their
position on the Credentials
Committee. Here they serve
with the Mock Convention
Chairman in charge of politics,
Craig Cornett, and act as the
final authority in all matters
regarding political accuracy
and credentials policy.

Chosen last spring, these four
were selected for their acute
understanding of regional
politics; they already have a
large amount of information to
relate to the state delegations
on campaign developments. At
the convention itself, the coor-
dinators will be constantly
available to the various state
chairmen as they move to and
from sessions of the Credentials
Committee.

Platform Director Edward H.
Brown and his committee have
been selected to draft the Mock
Convention’s model platform.
This document will attempt to
reflect W&L student opinion
—the only deviation from the
standard of absolute impartiali-
ty — and will regularly survey
student opinions on current
issues. In addition, this group
plans to research various policy
alternatives, hold hearings to
gather various options, and de-
fend the final version of the
platform on the convention
floor.

Journal Editor Samuel Flax
and his committee compile the
official Convention Journal and
Record and oversee its national
distribution. The Journal is
perhaps the most lasting
memento of this three years or
more of hard work, and is
distributed to state delegates
and guests at no charge during
the Mock Convention.

Facilities Chairman Goetz
Eaton looks after all the
physical arrangements for the
affair — including design, con-
struction and decoration of the
hall in Doremus Gymnasium —
which is no small task, if one
may judge from the pictures of
previous conventions on these
pages. This committee also
works with each convention
committee in making similar
arrangements throughout the
year for related activities.

Be Discreet

Drinking And The Gym

The official policy on drinking is that no food or
beverages (alcoholic or otherwise) are allowed in
the gym. Of course, we know better. We are not
naive enough to think that there will be no drink-
ing; all we ask is that you be discreet. You will not be
allowed to bring coolers, kegs, etc. onto the floor.

You might want to plan ahead. By no means,
however, will there be unlimited drinking. Every-
thing must be within reason and rowdiness cannot
be tolerated. On Saturday the policy concerning
drinking will be considerably stricter. Security

Committee.

will do its best to minimize any drinking.

Security will remove anybody on the floor who is
not wearing his proper delegate card. Cards must
be worn during all three sessions. If a delegate
pass is lost another one can be obtained from the
Delegate Information Table setup by the Facilities

We do not have many extra cards and issuing a
new one is a pain so therefore stress to your
delegates not to lose them. To get a new one the
delegate and one of the delegation officers must re-
quest a new one at the table. Remember, cards
must be worn by everyone at all times.

In The Convention

Media and Public Relations
Director Guy Steuart is respon-
sible for the overall public-
relations and news-
dissemination efforts of the
Mock Convention. In_ this
respect, he and his committee
will work extensively with local
and national media represen-
tatives — in particular, with
W&L’s Assistant News Director
Gray Coleman, who will look
after the University’s own
media relations in this respect.
Mock Convention news will be
released to major sources in
each state in order to establish
political contacts and aid in
fund-raising. A variety of posi-
tions is still available on this im-
portant committee.

Speakers Chairman Dan
Westbrook handles all the ar-
rangements for the conven-
tion’s distinguished guests, both
before and during the actual

Police Set
Parade

Restrictions

The parade is always a good

time for everyone and this one
will be one of the biggest ever.
We are sincerely trying to put
as few restrictions on you as
possible. It has been made very
clear to us, however, by Chief
Kirby and people like him that
there are some regulations we
must follow. There can be no
drinking in the recreation area
where the floats will be
assembled (use good judgment
and don’t ask for trouble). We
are also responsible for clean-
up, so keep your trash to a
minimum and pick it all up.
Chief Kirby says that there is no
drinking allowed on the floats.
He is especially firm on this
point because there will be so
many children there. He will be
at the gate of the field and will
pull anyone off the floats who is
drinking or drunk. He has done
it in the past and I am sure he
will do it again. There will be
other policemen doing the same
along the route. Please
cooperate with our security peo-
ple — they are not trying to has-
sle anyone.

 

event. From travel and accom-
modations to security and
receptions, this group: will be
busy with candidates; platform
speakers and others throughout
the year.

Parade Chairman Donald
Swaggart and his committee,
last but not least, have the
awesome responsibility of plan-
ning and executing the tradi-
tional cavalcade through Lex-
ington on Friday morning.
Always one of the highlights of
the weekend, the parade often
sets the tone for the entire con-
vention — and, as in past years,
many special attractions are
being planned to set this parade
apart from its predecessors.

The state chairman and
members of his delegation have
the primary duty of developing
broad and effective expertise in
the nature and profile of politics
in their respective states, (Old-
time political commentators
might have compared them to
‘“‘ward bosses” who were saddl-
ed with the responsibility for
predicting the turn of a vote
within a hairline margin. )

The chairman recruits a
delegation himself and assigns
members to certain key posi-
tions such as_ secretary,
treasurer, and resea i

 

 

tor. After these preliminaries,
the group sets out to establish
close political contacts with of-
ficials in its state. In the end, it
is these all-important relation-
ships that are the foundation of
the convention's reputation for
accuracy. During the balloting
sessions, toll-free telephones
are installed in rows off the con-
vention floor — and it is no oddi-
ty tosee a W&L state chairman
talking in a frenzy to his real-
life counterpart back home
about the swing of a particular
state’s vote.

The state chairman is also ac-
countable for his delegation’s
financial obligations and fund-
raising efforts, through the
solicitation of funds from
donors in his state. The money
raised is used for payment of a
fixed fee to the Steering Com-
mittee, for postage and phone
expenses, and so forth. Finally,
the chairman (already burden-
ed though he may be) is also
committed to enter a float
representing his state. Con-
structed by the members of the
delegation and financed by
private donations, the state
floats are often extremely
elaborate, recently including a
double-decker Mississippi

Governor Ronald Reagan :
10960 Wilshire Boulevard - Suite 812
Los Angeles, California 90024

Dear Governor Reagan,

Because a Republican incumbent President, who by virtue of his
rank and candidacy had to be looked upon as the leader of the
Party, was defeated by his Democrat opponent, it is quite
reasonable to now regard you as the titular head of the Party
and the person most able to rebuild.

The enclosed copies of correspondence are rather self-explana- a
tory but do not encompass the full meaning of "truth in taxatrvon
or "ultimate consumer tax". It is practically impossible to
express all the ramifications of such a plan by correspondence.
The NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION has been alerted that this scheme
does exist, but it would be far better if the Republican party
would adopt it and use it to elect a Republican Congress in

1978. There can be no doubt that the greatest concern of all
Americans is taxation and the growing "Statism" propounded and
endorsed by the Party that was once the party of Thomas Jefferson.
The plan outlined does more than all the speeches by so called
Republican leaders about “broadening the base of the Party",
"getting grass roots support", etc., etc., etc. endlessly. It
provides the nucleus for a broad and revolutionary program that
could only result in Republican victory and complete reversal

of the SPEND and tax philosophy advocated by the Democrat Party.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Cfarle AY yy

Honorable James L. Buckley

United States Senator

Suite 304, Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Buckley,

The enclosed copy of my July 20th letter to Lieutenant General
Arthur G. Trudeau, a Director of Magnetic Forming Corporation,
is somewhat indicative of my thoughts in regard to the following
prior to the Republican Convention,

Since the convention, however, which brought the people a campaign
which promises only the same old, shopworn, politics as usual -
without even a single new and fascinating idea, that could capture
the imagination of the people - it has been necessary to reflect
on who was best qualified to embrace a revolutionary new plan on
taxation and carry it through to the election of an Executive
branch and a Congress to put it into effect. The selection
narrowed to Senators Buckley and Helms. Helms because of his
close ties to the almost winning side of the Republican Party and
you because you were elected as neither a committed Republican or
Democrat but as the candidate of the Conservative Party, with
strong affinity with the right side of the Republican Party.

In searching for the means to get my message to you without dis-
closure to anyone else, I called your office and was able to talk
with one of your assistants, William Gavin, who recommended that

I write to you and mail the letter to his attention. But,

because I planned to be in Washington, Friday, August 25th, any-
how and a letter would not get there any sooner, I decided to hand
carry it to Mr. Gavin, I trust you will quickly see the merit of
what follows and will resolve to act on t.

1, Immeasurable words have been spoken and written about
returning government to the people, yet nothing has been done
about it.

2. Power to rule themselves cannot be accomplished until the
power to tax themselves has been returned to the people.

The first step in returning power to tax must be - TRUTH IN
TAXATION.

 

The Ring-tum Phi, May 8, 1980, Page 5

Brock To Open Convention

Washington and Lee alumnus and Chairman of
the Republican National Committee Bill Brock
will deliver the opening address at the Mock Con-
vention on May 9, 1980.

The role of the opening speaker is varied, but
Brock’s major task will be to present the view-
point of the Republican National Committee on the
1980 presidential race. In delivering the first ma-
jor address, Brock will also set the tone of excite-
ment for the convention.

Throughout his career, Bill Brock has recogniz-
ed the need for a “‘get-involved program”’ in the
determination of one’s future. After his gradua-
tion from Washington and Lee in 1953, he served as
an officer in the U.S. Navy. Following his military
service, he became a marketing executive for the
Brock Candy Co. of Chattanooga, Tenn.

It was not until 1960, at the age of 30, that Brock
placed a foot into the political arena. Along with
several associates, Brock became disillusioned
with the traditional one-party rule of the
Democrats in Tennessee. As a result he revitaliz-
ed the 3rd District Republican Committee with
emphasis on the young voter. By starting at the
“grass roots,’’ Brock successfully built a strong
precinct system and first instituted a ‘‘get involv-
ed program.”’ His activities quickly showed their
success in terms of the high financial support the

political organization received. Brock was then

named executive director of the state central com-
mittee.
After working for two years to form a strong

‘party organization, Bill Brock became the first

Republican since the 1920’s to be elected to Con-
gress from the third district of Tennessee. After
four terms in Congress, he challenged three-term
Democrat Albert Gore for a Senate seat. Involving
10,000 volunteers in his campaign, he won in an
upset victory. Along with Senator Brock, Ten-
nessee elected the first Republican Governor in a
half-century and five out of eight Republican Con-
gressional candidates.

In 1974, Brock was selected by his Senate col-
leagues to head the Republican Senatorial Cam-
paign Committee. With this background, it was on-
ly a matter of a few years before he was asked to
lead the entire party in re-establishing its base of
strength after the ravages of Watergate and the
Nixon pardon.

Brock inherited the leadership of a party that
traditionally placed their emphasis on strong
races at the top of the ticket — the glamourous
contests for president, governor and senate.
Brock’s appointment signalled an end to this
trend, and in the 1978 elections, the Republican
Party gained nearly 300 legislative seats across
the country, succeeding in halting the party’s
downhill slide at the grass-roots level.

ALL taxes are paid by the consumer and we must replace our
unfair, unjust, inequitable and unmanageable tax system with an -

ULTIMATE CONSUMER TAX.

Income taxes must be abolished and replaced with a tax system
that will apply to every business and individual on the basis
that any goods, wares, matefials or commodities purchased for
their consumption, will be taxed at an equal rate for all.

Goods, wares, materials and commodities purchased for processing
into other forms for resale, or goods, wares, materials or
commodities purchased for resale in the same form, will be
exempt, i.e., a manufacturer will be taxed on all purchases of
business equipment and production machinery but not on material
and supplies to be converted into merchandise.

In case of multiple purchases made from a central point for
widespread use, the point of use will be the point of purchase
and the point of purchase, the point of tax.

In the case of leased equipment, the lessor will pay the tax and
add it into the cost of the lease agreement.

When purchases are made on credit, the tax will be collected at

time of sale.

ALL taxes will be collected by local jurisdictions and passed up
to the higher echelons of government after retaining the portion

by the Federal Government and State Governments need no longer

be feared.

With the power to tax returned to the people, the Power to
administer the multitude of programs instituted by the Federal
and State Governments must return to the people.

The former thoughts are not complete and certainly need embel-
lishment, but they should provide enough of a skeleton upon which
to build a revolutionary but sound program.

Thank you for your attention.

Much has been said about
vice-presidential possibilities
this year. Many presidential
candidates use the appointment
as a kind of trump card they
pull out near the end of a cam-
paign to keep voter enthusiasm
and wonder at its peak.

But what do people really
think of the job a vice-president
does. Here are a few descrip-
tions.

“It's indoor work with no heavy
lifting.” —Sen. Robert Dole (R-
Kan)

Peanuts
and Camelot

Democrats have an_ in-
teresting choice this year be-
tween peanuts and Camelot.
Campaigning on both sides has
been fierce and occasionally
despicable.

While one side criticizes cur-
rent job performance (or lack
of), the other camp questions
truthfulness and integrety.

But Teddy didn’t always have
these political views. Long
before throwing his hat into the
political arena he said, “Uh,
well, as I, uh, have said before,
uh, several times in fact, 1, uh, 1
expect the president to be, uh,
renominated, and I expect him to
be reelected and 1, uh, Lintend to
support him.”

It Doesn’t Pay

It just doesn’t pay to get out of
bed some mornings, especially
if you’re one of two men from
Morris Udall’s 1976 campaign
who were looking over Boston’s
Faneuil Hall a day before the
candidate was to make an ap-
pearance.

The two men somehow got
locked in at night and found all
the doors and windows on the
first floor sealed tight.
Desperate, they called Udall’s
secret service who in turn call-
ed local police.

The police arrived with a
large ring of keys. Unfortunate-
ly, none fit.

Later a hook-and ladder truck
rescued the pair by going
through a second-story window.

The operation took some time
— one man had a fear of
heights.

Reagan Still Front Runner

by Ed Taylor

Despite the fact he’d be near-
ly 70 when he took office in the
White House, a recent Time
magazine poll shows Ronald
Reagan as the front-runner for
the 1980 Republican presiden-
tial nomination.

Ronald Reagan was born on
February 6, 1911 in Tampico,
Ill. As a child he became fond of
acting and later attended
Eureka College, a small Chris-
tian Church School near Peoria.
He graduated in 1932 and took a
sports announcing job in Des
Moines, Iowa at WHO, where he
became known as “Dutch”
Reagan.

While covering the Chicago
Cubs at spring training in
California, he was asked to take
a screen test and from this his
movie career began. He starred
in such films as ‘‘Knute Rockne
— All American’”’ and ‘‘King’s
Row.”’ Although he didn’t win
any Academy Awards, Reagan
utilized his acting career to
sharpen a stage presence that
became a tremendous asset for
him in politics.

During his acting career,
Reagan was a liveral Democrat
but he later gained fame as an
energetic spokesman proclaim-
ing Opposition to centralized
government and support for a
hard-nosed stance by the United
States in foreign affairs. He
strongly supported the free-
enterprise system and virosous-
ly opposed big government.

In 1966, persuaded by friends
from the movie industry,
Reagan ran for governor of
California. He was not given
much chance in the race, but
when the votes were tallied he
had swamped _ incumbent
Democrat Edmund G. Brown
by nearly 845,000 votes.

To put to rest the belief that
his election was a fluke, Reagan
won re-election in 1970 by near-
ly 500,000 votes.

Reagan left the governor’s of-
fice in 1974 and in addition to his
unsuccessful presidential cam-
paign in 1976 he has prospered
as a lecturer, radio commen-
tator and syndicated collum-
nist. He now lives in Pacific
Palisades, California with his
wife, Nancy. They have two
children; a daughter Patricia,
26, and a son, Ronald, 20.

As a front-runner in the 1980
Republican presidential
nomination Reagan’s,
strategists feel he must start off
winning or he will quickly fade |
from the Public’s favor.
Therefore, a few early primary |
victories seem to be a necessity |
for Reagan if he expects to win}
the Republican nomination at |
the 1980 convention in Detroit. |

As for the age issue, one sup- |
porter said ‘If we win a few |
early primaries, it'll disappear. |
If we lose a few, it’I] killus.” |

Profile.

George Bush

by Carlo Carlozzi, Jr.

After having been considered
three times for the vice
presidency by Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, George Bush
announced in early May of this
year his Presidential can-
didacy. His announcement was
somewhat overdue. No
Republican aspirant started
earlier than Bush. In 1978 alone,
he toured 42 states laying down
his grass roots organization
which he claims will get him the
nomination in 1980.

George Herbert Walker Bush,
54, is a man with a deep sense of
noblesse oblige. However,
unlike most of his predecessors
of the old Eastern establish-
ment of the Republican party,
George Bush is no liberal, not
even a moderate. Rather, Bush
is running pretty much as a
standard conservative.

His credentials are impre-
sive: Greenwich County Day
School, Andover, youngest pilot
in the Navy and graduated Phi
Beta Kappa in 2 '2 years from
Yale. While at Yale, he was also
a member of Skull and Bones,
captain of the baseball team
and President of the Senior

Class.

Mr. Bush is the former-
almost-everything. He served
two terms as a member of Con-
gress, from Texas, former en-
voy to Peking, former CIA
Director, former Republican

National Chairman in_ the
darkest Watergate days. He
performed all of these jobs with
ability, if not always brilliance.

In his declaration of can-
didacy, on May 1, 1979, Mr.
Bush said he wasn’t promising
‘‘a new deal”’ or ‘‘a new Foun-
dation’, but rather, he was of-
fering ‘‘a new candor.”’ Mostly
due to his background, Mr.
Bush has been speaking almost
entirely about foreign policy.
What he says about foreign
policy is generally tough and
conservative.

Bush opposed the Panama
Canal treaties, and now re-
mains cautious on the Salt II
treaty. Bush contends that his
CIA assignment fortified his
belief that the Russian
challenge is dangerous. On the
Salt II treaty, Bush stated that
“the fact is that under this trea-
ty we are virtually unable to
monitor whether the Soviets
comply with its terms...when it
comes to vertification of Salt II,
Jimmy Carter will ask us to
trust the Soviets as he once ask-
ed us to trust him...But I
say...that a treaty that can not
be verified tomorrow shouldn’t
be ratified today.”

George Bush favors the ERA,
thinks that the CIA has been
undercut and opposes a tax cut
without a cut in federal spen-
ding. He favors. nuclear

development, favors a shared
reduction in government
regulation of business, a
phaseout of some of the social
programs dating to the
Kennedy-Johnson years. Bush
favors a supply-oriented energy
program including _ oil-price
decontrol and a ‘“‘windfall pro-
fits’’ tax with a strong
‘“plowback”’ provision to en-
courage oil development, and
sharp tax cut to move the
economy forward.

A big problem for George
Bush is the fact that he is not a
household name. This, though,
can be rectified as the elections
of 1976 showed us with the
nomination and eventual elec-
tion of Jimmy Carter to the
White House.

Depending on the poll read,
George Bush’s name can go
from non-existent to leading the
field of names. A June
Washington Post poll of 1,976
Republican delegates showed
Bush running third, at 11 per-
cent, following former Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan and John
Connally. Ina survey conducted
by the Christian Science
Monitor in late July of 1979, of
Republican leaders, George
Bush led the field as their
nominee for president, with 27
percent, over 24 percent for
Reagan and 22 for Connally.

Republican Party Changes Strategy

by Marc Birenbaum

Believe it or not, there was a
time when political commer-
cials were simple, cut and dry
advertisements — a speech to a
special interest group, an at-
tack on a supposed weakness of
an opponent or an ad depicting
your favorite candidate as the
All-American all supporters
truly knew him or her to be.

Then came the advent of the
presidential contender’s media
blitz, described so well in books
like The Selling of The Presi-
dent, 1968, The People Machine,
The Image Candidates and The
Political Persuaders. >

Even this year’s campaign
showed brief glimpses of a good
candidate commercial. Sen.

Howard Baker produced one of
the most effective and con-
troversial commercials, when
he responded to an Iranian’s
question while stumping in
Iowa. When George Bush was
interviewed on ‘‘Sixty
Minutes,”’ his campaign was
caught in an embarassing situa-
tion when the CBS crew filmed
Bush’s people re-enacting a
welcoming party at a New
England airport.

Now the Republican party
itself is sinking $5 million in an
ad campaign with the general
theme: ‘‘Vote Republican. For
a change.”’ — a theme reminis-
cient of the 1946 campaign in
which the GOP captured both
chambers of Congress.

unique is that it seeks to provide
an idealogical theme for the
Republican Party as a whole,
and is very similar to the
British Conservative party’s
media campaign of last spring.

Perhaps you’ve seen one of
the Republican ads. In early
February, the first, entitled
“Land of Hope,’’ aired national-
ly on ABC. The five-minute
message was about present pro-
blems facing the nation: Laws
that restrict productivity, infla-
tion, and overtaxation caused
by government spending.
“What went wrong, what went
wrong...in the Congress of the
United States,’ says the ad.
“But tomorrow can be dif-
ferent...We have the resources
to restore prosperity.”’

Throughout February, five
other messages, varying in
time from 30 seconds to five
minutes, appeared nationally.

“Earlier, our test marketing
of the messages produced
favorable responses from the
previewers,”’ said Republican
National Chairman Bill Brock.
“We believe the. television
messages will help promote the
growing feeling among
Americans that the Republican
party can do a better job than
the Democrats in restoring
stability to America — in both
domestic and_ international
areas.”’

These commercials are only a
part of the first phase of a three-
part plan, which will culminate
in June.

You Can’t Make Chicken Salad...

It’s Mock Convention Weekend! The culmina-
tion of years of work! Parades! Demonstrations!
You name it, they’ve got it.

Of course, there is one minor problem.

Unfortunately, an authentic imitation of our na-
tional political process tends to intensify the feel-
ing that we are all slightly insane in this country.

Now it is expected that all so called “‘intelligent’’
people will rag on the candidates selected. Lord
Bryce is quoted. The political pundits shake their
heads at the ignorance of the general population.
Reforms are proposed and then forgotten.

Yet this year’s results, more than most, deserve
the abuse heaped upon it.

As the Mock Convention will reaffirm, old

rockin’ Ronny will get the nod from the GOP. On
the other side, we have old Mr. Incompetent.
Then, suppoesedly in the middle, we have the
alleged intellectual, Preacher John.

These are our choices for what is probably the
most powerful position in the Western world.

Now it is not the Mock Convention’s fault that it
is forced to work with such material. Its purpose
of attempting this simulation of national follv.

I guess it is democracy, and that the alter-
natives aren’t so hot, but it seems that our
presidential nomination process is just a tad
ridiculous.

There—I’ve proven that I can be just as big a
snob as really neat, respected columnists.

Alben Barkley’s Famous Last Words

by Robert Keefe

There are lots of errors con-
nected with Washington and
Lee. Such a large quantity of
the mail meant for us goes to
Lexington, Kentucky, that the
post office there has a rubber
stamp to redirect it. The story is
told that many years ago, at his
first faculty meeting, a new
president expressed his
pleasure at arriving on the cam-
pus of William and Mary. We
ourselves have a plaque on
campus on which the name of
another man, who was our
president for 30 years, is
misspelled. Half the world
thinks the statue of Cyrus Mc-
Cormick on the Front Campus
is really of Robert E. Lee, and
the other half thinks Lee is
buried inside Edward Valen-
tine’s marble Recumbent
Statue in the chapel.

Perhaps no error is more per-
sistent or widespread, however,
than the one about Alben
Barkley’s famous Last Words.

We ourselves have committed
the error more frequently than
anyone else.

It is all the more a shame
because Barkley’s Last Words
must rank, by any yardstick,
among history’s most a propos.
(Contrast them, for instance,
with Elvis Presley’s, uttered to
his girlfriend: “Baby, I’m going
into the library to read."’)

In fact, others than us at
Washington and Lee also
regard Barkley’s Last Words as
transcendent. In their book The
Best (1974), Professors Peter

Passell and Leonard Ross label
them “Best Exit Line.’’ But
they misquote Barkley. They
have the occasion wrong. And
they say it happened in Lex-
ington, Kentucky.

Passell and Ross meant well.

(“*...A misquotation set in the
wrong locale at the wrong
time,” NBC newsman Lloyd
Dobyns, °57 wrote to Time
magazine, ‘“‘which must set
some sort of Best Record for
Most Errors in_ Shortest
Apace.”’)

So far this year, we ourselves
have issued at least one news
release and one brochure that
have the Last Words wrong too.

It is Henry Mencken’s “‘Law
of Millard Fillmore’s Bathtub”’
that does it to us and to
everyone.

It snuck into print once, and
it’s been there ever since.

Our boss, however, possibly
alone among the _ whole
populace, knew we and
everyone were wrong then,
wrong now, and likely to be
wrong forever. That’s why he’s
the boss.

So after who-knows-how-
many repetitions of the error,
we were prodded actually to go
toa primary source. (Apparent-
ly, no one else had had a similar
notion for years, either. It took
two days to track down our own
recording of the Last Words. )

And here is the Straight
Truth, finally.

Alben Barkley was at
Washington and Lee (Lex-
ington, Virginia), on April 30,

suspension and thick rubber
flooring.

Putting the Clydesdales
through their precise paces is
demanding. Although the ex-
pert hitch drivers make it look
easy, guiding eight tons. of
horsepower is a far cry from
power steering.

“It’s having 60 or 70 pounds of
weight in your hands at all
times; you’ve got to maintain
constant tension on the reins or
you lose contact with the
horses,” says one veteran
driver.

The horses are harnessed in
such a way as to give each
almost complete freedom of

movement forward and
backward. Driver skill alone
determines pace, position and
movement. Both the driver and
assistant have their hands full
continuously. While one drives,
the other is busily straightening
the reins. The stress of guiding
12-plus tons of horse and wagon
is so great that drivers general-
ly trade duties often during an
appearance.

The “official” home in St.
Louis of the Clydesdales is
perhaps the most lavish
quarters ever designed for
horses. In 1885, Anheuser-Busch
founder Adolphus Busch built
an ornate $35,000 building on the
St. Louis brewery grounds to
house the family horses. The
Clydesdales’ stable is one of the
three buildings within the 70-
block Anheuser-Busch head-
quarters complex in South St.
Louis which has_ been
designated a registered Na-
tional Historic Landmark.

1956, to speak to the student
body’s Mock Democratic Con-
vention.

But he never said he would
rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than sit at the feet of
the mighty, and then keel over.

Almost, but not quite.

The problem is with the feet.
If one is a servant in anyone’s
house, after all, one has no
choice but to sit at the feet of the
mighty.

It was just a little more than
three years after the end of
Truman administration, after
the end of Barkley’s vice
presidency. The man who coin-
ed the word Veep confessed to
his student audience that once
upon a time, he’d aspired to
even higher office. But, he said,
no longer did he entertain such
ambitions. (‘“They could go fur-
ther and do worse,” he quoted
Thomas B. Reed, ‘‘and it seems
they will.’’)

Someone in the audience yell-

ed, ‘‘Aw, come on, y’ole
firehorse!”’
BARKLEY: “I think I am

sufficiently alert to present con-
ditions to know that all fire ap-
paratuses are now automotive,
not horse-drawn. (Laughter and
applause)...But I no longer
have any personal interest (in
standing for highest office). I
have served my country and my
people for half a century...I

Convention abounds!

Make no mistake about it
—the primary focus of the 1980
Mock Republican Convention
will be to select the eventual
Republican presidential
nominee. Even so, the weekend
has always been an entertain-
ment spectacle, filled with a
carnival atmosphere which
captures the true spirit of the
“‘real’’ political gatherings in
the summer.

The center of activity for the
pageantry is the traditional con-
vention parade on Friday morn-
ing — with more than 50 floats,
marching bands, ever-present
elephants and U.S. Sen. John
Warner as 1980 Parade Mar-
Shal.

There can be no true pagean-
try without regalia and decora-
tions — hence, a wide variety of
souvenir items have been
created for the 1980 convention.
Included in the group — all
creations of the Public Rela-
tions office of the convention
—are bumper stickers, T-shirts,
lapel buttons, commemorative
plastic grain cups, posters, and
matches.

And best of all —-a novelty to
conventions past and present
—a special edition, Mock Con-
vention bourbon. The liquor
comes in a 750-milliliter bottle.
Made by the Jim Beam
Distillery Co., the bourbon will
be sold through Lexington’s
ABC Store starting in mid-
April, as will the rest of the 1980
souvenirs. Further information
may be obtained in the Mock
Convention office, 703-463-9111,

The tradition of W&L mock convention began
unpretentiously enough as a class project sug.
gested by W. Jett Lauck, an assistant professor of
economics and politics at Washington and Lee.

students who only a few weeks before had heard

Gold” speech at a Lexington skating rink. Bryan
appeared as part of the traveling Chautaugua
series, those carnival-like events which brought
speakers and entertainers to rural communities
early in this century. The enthusiastic students)
garnered enough support for Bryan to obtain the
nomination on the first ballot — the only first-
ballot victory in the history of the Mock Conven-
tion. Two months later, the delegates to the actual
Democratic National Convention, meeting in
Denver, made good on that original prediction.

The first Mock Convention was of such little note
to the editor of the student newspaper, the Ring-
tum Phi that he chose to carry only a brief account
of it on page two of the paper. The Lexington
Gazette, however, reported on. its front page that
“the young gentlemen entered into the meeting
with the zest of seasoned politicians plus the en-
thusiasm of collegians.”’ If we are to believe the
first-hand accounts, an imprudent combination of
political ‘‘zest’’ and collegiate ‘‘enthusiasm’’ pro-
duced volatile results. The ’08 convention saw the
only political dispute among delegates that led to
actual fisticuffs. After the nomination of Bryan,
members of the Kansas delegation, who had sup-
ported the candidacy of Minnesota Governor John
A. Johnson, in no uncertain terms invited the
Bryan supporters to join them outside the gy...
nasium, where, according to newspaper accounts,
a “heated set-to’’ ensued. When it was through,
those Johnson supporters who remained healthy
enough gathered at the engineering building, held
their own convention, and nominated the ‘‘man of
the hour’’ — in their eyes at least Governor
Johnson.

There is historical evidence that the Mock Con-
vention which produces a nominee in the early
balloting stands the best chance of having
predicted the correct candidate. The '52 conven-
tion, which went only four ballots, appears to be a
model of how, in theory, every Mock Convention
should turn out.

The delegates, including senior economics ma-
jor David Constine, chairman of the California
delegation, had done their homework. Constine
had established a correspondence with Governor
Earl Warren, who would later head the California

Those conventions which have made correct
predictions even after extended balloting have
often done so because of some fortuitous oc-
currence. For example, in 1960 Adlai Stevenson
accumulated enough votes to win on the fourth
ballot — but a shortage of adding machines
delayed Mock Convention officials from ruling
him a winner, and in the interim several delega-
tions switched their votes.

delegations present. That summer, the
Democratic National Convention, meeting in New

sion of what had taken place in Lexington that spr-

reached on a nominee — a record that still stands.

Fundraising

 

The Finance and Develop-
ment Committee of the 1980
Mock Convention, under the
direction of Economics major
Richard Makepeace _ since
November 1979, is responsible
for the accumulation of funds
from corporations, foundations
and the exclusive ‘‘Committee
of 100.’ Total contributions
since the endof the 1976 Mock
Democratic Convention have
totalled approximately $24,000.
Even before the committee was
officially organized, it may be
noted, the convention was the
recipient of a most generous
donation from the Sumners
Foundation of Dallas.

In its attempt to solicit more
grants of this type, the ‘“F&D”
Committee has pursued cor-
porate contacts around the
country. Makepeace, a senior
from Greensboro, N.C., notes
that “the committee has con-
centrated primarily on those
foundations which would have a
natural interest in a political
science endeavor. To a large
degree, we have concentrated
our efforts in Virginia, realizing
that corporations within the
state are more familiar with the
convention’s reputation for ac-
curacy than potential con-
tributors a greater distance
from Washington and Lee.
Nevertheless, we have spent a
great deal of time carrying out
special out-of-state work — and
donations have begun to come
in from that area as well.”

Makepeace acknowledged

try in 1976).

pointed and organizing their

that larger corporate donations
have been limited to date. ‘But
this should not be seen as a sign
of disinterest,’ he added. ‘“‘Due
to the fact that these larger
bodies meet at longer intervals
each year, we should be hearing
quite a few responses after the
spring meeting season is clos-
ed.”

The individual state
chairmen and the delegation
members pursue smaller and
more traditional areas of fund
raising. By contacting parents,
small businesses and friends of
the convention, the states as a
unit have raised $14,000 with
convention weekend more than
six weeks away.

In some cases, a state chair-
man initiates contact with a
corporation in his area. Those
which express more than a
passing interest in the event are
referred to the F&D Committee
for further contact. This pro-

Philip Morris Inc. of Richmond,
both of which have made
substantial donations.

A third source of revenue
managed by F &D is the Conven-
tion’s ‘“‘Committee of 100,” a
select group composed of W&L
alumni who have worked on the
Steering Committees of past
conventions. To date, this group
has given in excess of $1,000 to
the 1980 Mock Convention
—many stating their gifts are in
return for the valuable ex-
perience and practical educa-
tion they received while serving
in their respective conclave.

And these methods are just a
sampling — other means of
fund raising have ranged from
cocktail parties to door-to-door
solicitation. In all, F&D is one of
the primary reasons for op-
timism among staffers in the
1980 Mock Convention, pro-
viding an ample budget for a
unique educational experience.

Tom Wolfe Speaks At Contact

by John Wells

Tom Wolfe, a 1951 graduate of
Washington and Lee and author
of a number of highly praised
books (of greatest renown The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and
more recently The Right Stuff)
addressed an enthusiastic au-
dience in Lee Chapel yesterday.
His appearance was sponsored
by Contact.

Nattily dressed, not in white
but in a three piece pale yellow
suit with thin blue-grey stripes,
the returning alumnus main-
tained the audience’s interest
and highlighted his remarks
wtih colorful, witty descrip-
tions, usually about modern ex-
cess. The substance of his talk,
he explained, dealt with an un-
published chapter of his latest
success, The Right Stuff
entitled a ‘‘National History of
Bravery.”

Wolfe commented that since
the beginning of this century,
there has been “‘practically no
literature of a serious nature’
about the modern military hero.
The perception of it has been
reduced to a set of stereotypes
on television, in MASH and
Gomer Pyle, which depict the
military man as a “‘facist brute
of an idiot.” He noted that the
risks of active service fliers are
almost as grest as those taken
by calvery men in the 19th cen-
tury.

The New York City journalist
said that when he observed the
launching of the last manned
space mission, Apollo 17,
among a crowd of Merv Griffin-
calibre celebrities, he asked
himself, ‘what makes a man
capable of ascending into a
huge rocket and waiting for so-
meone to light the fuse?’’ After

many years of research and
analysis, he found hte answer,
which is the title of his new
book.

Wolfe illustrated an example
of the ‘right stuff,’ as he does
in the book, in a particularly
humorous account of being
soothed during a mechanically
troubled commercial flight by
the chuckling, avuncular drawl
of the airline captain. As he
watched the wings unloading
fuel into the ocean (laughed off
by the pilot as unnecessary)
and was instructed by the
stewardess to kneel and remove
his glasses, Wolfe said ‘‘I was in
two frames of mind. On one side
I was thinking ‘this is it,’ but on
the other hand, if it were so
dire, ‘how could the captain, the
man who knows the actual
situation most intimately...how
could he keep on drawlin and
chuck chuckling...?’’’ This
courage, displayed during a
possibly fatal mid-air crisis, is
what the writer says epitomizes
the concept.

In the middle of his talk, and
again near the conclusion,
Wolfe quoted the former Chur-
chill aide, Lord Moran, who
wrote that the only way to have
brave men in battle (or
presumably, in orbit) is to
make sure that there is no
honorable alternative. Wolfe
said that the phrase stuck with
him, and that it is the secret of
routine bravery, even during
unpopular wars in this century.

In person, perhaps more so
than in media appearances,
Wolfe comes across as easy-
going, intelligent, and sharply
funny. His literary
achievements are noteworthy
for their originality and diversi-
ty of content.

 

EC Hears Health Complaints

by John G. Billmyre

According to Scott Williams,
a member of the Student Health
Committee who appeared
before the Executive Commit-
tee Monday night, ‘‘some
dispute exists as to whether Bill
Calore received treatment at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital
during February’s mid-winter
break.”

Calore, a first-year law stu-
dent, injured his head during
the undergraduate mid-winter
break.

Last week Calore told the EC
that he had been charged for
treatment by the hospital even
though he did not receive treat-
ment.

Whether he received treat-
ment will probably remain
unknown, but the university has
agreed to settle the bill for the
disputed treatment with the
Stonewall Jackson Hospital.

The EC requested that a
member of the Student Health
Committee attend the meeting
after it learned last week that
Calore did not get a response
from the Committee after he fil-
eda complaint:

Williams said Calore’s com-
plaint went unanswered be-
cause there are sO many com-

plaints from the law school that
they are dealt with as a group.

According to Williams, of the
25 complaints about Health Ser-
vice at W&L, 15 are from Law
School Students who are dis-
pleased with the infirmary be-
ing closed during under-
graduate breaks.

The Student Health Commit-
tee Representative said the
Committee has dealt with all
the complaints it has received
this year.

A regular Health Committee
meeting, according to Williams,
consists of Dean of Students
Lewis G. John reading com-
plaints about the health ser-
vices to the Committee.

Williams left the impression
that Committee members then
investigate the complaints.

He said he would recommend
to next year’s Committee that
all complaints be responded to
on an individual basis.

Williams also said that he
handed out a survey to 50 law
studénts': and’ received a

response from 16 students.

The randomly selected law
students, said Calore, respond-
ed that they preferred having a
doctor available for seven hours
a day in his office to two hours a
day in the infirmary during the
undergraduate break.

Under the University’s agree-
ment with Dr. Feddeman, the
doctor is to give the law stu-
dents preferential treatment
during the undergraduate
break.

Ariel Editor Chris Fay gave
his publication’s monthly report
and announced the publication
should be ready by next week.

The Journalism Lab Press is
printing 400 copies of the 52-
page literary magazine for ap-
proximately $700.

The Ariel has about $957 left
in its budget, according to Fay.

EC President Steve Abraham
reported that he talked with
President Huntley about the
possibility of hiring more
security for next year and
changing locks in the freshman
dorms.

Abraham said Huntley

believes changing the locks in
the freshman dorms would not
be a good solution to the securi-
ty problems jn the dorms, since
dorm counselors would still
have keys, which could be lost
or stolen.

Abraham said there is a
possibility that the security
force could be beefed up, and
added that freshmen may be
provided with padlocks for their
closet doors.

Sophomore Representative
Jim Wenke said he did not think
padlocks would help much since
the doors could still be lifted off
of the hinges.

In the final business of the
evening, Dee Keesler, Senior
Representative, said a ODK
leadership forum will be held
this spring.

The purpose of the forum, ac-
cording to Keesler, “‘is to allow
new campus leaders to meet
one another and to discuss per-
tinent problems.

Keesler emphasized that no
student funds will be spent on
the closed forum.

He added that an open forum
is being planned for,next fall. -

Reunions
To Draw
400 Alumni

More than 400 out-of-town
alumni of Washington and Lee
University and their families, a
record number, will be in Lex-
ington next weekend (May 8-10)
for spring reunions.

Highlights of the weekend will
include the annual meeting of
the alumni association, the
John Randolph Tucker Lecture,
Law Day ceremonies, Mock
Convention activities, a match
between W&L’s fourth-ranked
lacrosse team and the Universi-
ty of North Carolina, socializing
and reminiscing.

Tom Wolfe, a 1951 graduate of
Washington and Lee and award-
winning author of ‘‘The Right
Stuff,’ will officially open the
weekend at 8 p.m. with a talk to
his fellow alumni in Lee Chapel.

Wade Hampton McCree Jr.,
solicitor general of the United
States, will deliver the Tucker
Lecture — ‘‘Partners in a Pro-
cess” — at 11:30 a.m. Saturday,
May 10, in the Moot Courtroom
of Lewis Hall.

The annual meeting of the
alumni association will take
place Saturday at 2 p.m. in Lee
Chapel — following the Mock
Convention session to nominate
a Republican candidate for
president. During the meeting,
annual class agent awards will
be presented and officers of the
national alumni organization
for 1980-81 will be elected.

Other weekend attractions for
visiting alumni will include the
traditional Mock Convention
parade down Main Street at 10
a.m. Friday, the convention’s
keynote address, to be
delivered this year by U.S. Sen.
Barry Goldwater, at 7:30 that
evening, and a dance featuring
the big-band music of Lester
Lanin and his orchestra.

Reunions are scheduled for
the classes of 1930, 1935, 1940,
1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965, 1970
and 1975. Members of the ‘‘Old
Guard,’’ classes which
graduated from W&L more
than 50 years ago, will also be in
Lexington.

Spring term and the Michelin
man couldn’t be happier.

Spring term is associated
with several traditional ac-
tivities, and one of them is tub-
ing. Students engaged in this
perilous sport risk life, limb,
and property to bounce through
rapids and land on sharp rocks.
Double hydraulics and sea
monsters add to the romance of
the sport.

The first day that the sky
behind House Mountain is blue,
the students sack the tire stores
for all the large inner tubes
available. And on that first day
every year there will be novices
(read “freshmen’’) who buy
small tubes — the kind the pros
carry beer in — and end up
either at Stonewall General
with a busted coccyx or lost
forever in the jaws of Devil’s
Kitchen.

Tubing trips start with about
six people and their over-
inflated tubes all piled into one

town, and promptly stops on the
other side of the Maury at East
Lex to buy beer or just to stand
around in the walk-in cooler.
The car is re-packed and with
the additional weight of two
cases of beer, cans please, the
fearless adventurers set off.

The ride out is always an
adventure, part of the pregame
warmup. The driver finds
himself shifting gears, holding
a tube on the roof when the
string breaks, trying to tune in
WLUR, and sucking on a Natty
Bo for the road.

In the back is always the
uninitiated freshman, sitting on
the hump with his chin below
his knees, holding his towel,
shades, Sea’n’Ski, shoes, radio,
and everyone else’s beer. His
face grows paler as he hears the
horror stories about those who
went before him, those who did
not return. }

He is made to recall the pla-
ques in Lee Chapel. He is told of
the wrestler who was sucked

car. Trucks are nice, but the car
usually ends up being an Opel.
No matter, the tubes are tied on
top or held out the window by
passengers.

Some tubers depart with
tubes deflated, to be pumped up
at Rockbridge Baths, but there
is still the problem of getting
them to Goshen from there.

So everyone is packed into the
car and heads out of town, past
the Snu lodge where the civic-
minded ones hold _ tornado

who went down the wrong side
of the run and was sucked back
under a waterfall so that all that
could be seen of him was his red
Converse in the churning froth.
Closer to Goshen and the
freshman’s face has_ turned
from one of fear to one of pain;
he has a muscle cramp and also
needs to get out for a minute but
the driver won’t stop and his
fellow passengers keep jabbing

him in the kidneys. Finally, the
rapids unfold beside the road
and everyone peers over the
right side of the car, remember-
ing the runs and looking for new
rocks.

As Laurel Run approaches,
there is the annual fight as to
where is the best place to start
and whether Devil’s Kitchen is
just above or is just below the
campground. (It doesn’t mat-
ter; it just seems so profes-
sional to have names for your
rapids. )

Speaking of professionals,
you can always tell a profes-
sional tuber because he stashes
beer along the river as he drives
up it so he can retreive it on the
way down.

So it’s into the water. Some
plop down into their tubes and
bear the sudden shock; others
ease in slowly, dipping each
part of their undercarriage a
millimeter at a time. Those who
take the latter approach often
find themselves still dry at the
top of a rapid and get the sud-
den dunking anyway. Some
never get wet and ride the
whole way with their hands and
feet on the tube, like inverted
spiders.

The top of a rapid separates
the different personalities of the
tube team. Some just go with
the flow, never paddling, since
each hand holds a beer, and run
fast to the bottom of the sluice.
Others backpaddle to see what
everyone else is going to do and
end up too exhausted to fight the
ride down and end up over the
waterfall they sought to avoid.
Others shout, ‘‘Go left! Go
left!’’ while they go right and
make it, while the freshman
who took the advice is sacrific-
ed to the angry river.(The river
is only appeased if he is a virgin

— about half the time. )

Every tuber will at one time
experience the Major Loss. This
particular form of locomotion,
sans tube, entails gently feeling
the bottom of a long run of white
water with the back of one’s
head, while one’s legs and
tubeshoes flash in the noon-day
sun. A pro will come up with all
his teeth, and most importantly
his tube hat, at the end of the
run.

If the team starts above the
campground it will usually stop
there to drop off its dead and
pick up more beer. The runs
above the campground are fast
and rocky, much rougher than
the ones below, and the scrape
rate is high.

Below the campground, for
those that venture further, are
some of the best big runs. The
first involves a double-S, two
drops, and several hydraulics
which will suck in a tube or
tuber and never let it go. This is
often called Devil’s Kitchen.

Below this stretch is a nice
straight run along a flat wall.

Below that are some small runs
and lots of smooth sailing, and
lots of time to pick up that
stashed beer.

The tubers find a spot where
the road comes close to the
water and climb out. Some
teams take two cars and leave
one at the exodus point for easy
return to the main vehicle.
Others thumb back up river,
which is fine as long as you are
not picked up by any of the mill
workers on their way to the late
shift; they like to run tubers
through their own course at the
lumber mill, feet first, of
course.

The return to Lexington is
always a fast one when the tube
team relizes that they have ten
minutes to make dinner. The
pros compare the runs to last
year or last week. The fresh-
men are ready to show their
scars to the ladies down the
road that night.

And the river, well, it never
gives up its dead...

Raves For ‘The States’

given a little more of themselves in concert.

As a contrast to The States, a west coast band
calledSpider, also one album veterans in the same
situation as The States , has picked a very dif-

by Mark Kinniburgh

Last week’s SAB concert in front of Doremus
Gym was a rare and excellent opportunity to see
great talent at a very low price. What more could
you ask for? We had lacrosse, tunes and beer and
it didn’t cost a thing!

I have yet to hear any substantial complaints
about any facet of the whole production outside of
one question as to why more students weren’t in
attendance.

The States opened up the festivities with a set of
hard, semi-Styx new wave that did little to help
their record sales around Lexington. The States
are a funny story that is duplicated around the
country daily by record companies unable to find
a “killer’’ band to gain national recognition with
their first album. Like The States, most of the
rookie bands are regional successes with little, if
any, Stage experience.

The gamble that a record label takes in this case
is that after one album, along with a tour or two,
the water will be ready for a second, and hopeful-
‘ly, asuccessful album.

I don’t like to criticize, but The States are head-
ed the wrong direction. Although quite blessed
with talent, most evident through the lead singer
Jimmy McDonnell, they blew a chance at W&L to
really floor an audience with a show.

It makes me wonder if they do that all the time
That is, are all the performances they give as
lack-lustre and emotionless? Especially with a
great audience such as W&L audiences usually
are, one would think that The States could have

ferent route.

 

All That Jazz — a self-indulgent oddity by Bob Fosse, an
autobiographical backstage musical with polished production and
energetic visuals. Roy Scheider was oscar-nominated for his per-
formance as the central character, Joe Gideon, a hard-driving, ag-
gressive, pill-popping filmmaker and choreographer who finally
suffers a breakdown and undergoes open heart surgery, an opera-
tion which Fosse has permrtted the audience to closely observe.
Surpassed only by Kramer vs Kramer in numbers of Academy
Awards this year (four in editing, score, costume design, and art
direction). Directed and co-written by Fosse, with Jessica Lange,
Ann Renking, Leland Palmer, and Ben Vereen. Starts tomorrow at

 

First, Spider features superior talent and
songwriting, both of which are keys to a new
band’s longevity. Secondly, Spider’s first album is
a hit — it is very, very good.

I would rate it as a ‘“‘Best Debut” record and ad-
vise buyers that the stuff is habit forming. Rarely
does a new band give you all the energy of a
Jefferson Airplane with the musical hooks of
Kansas or Pink Floyd.

Part of the lure of Spider is the female vocalist,
who defies current practice of cutesy, vicious or
sexpot vocal inflection, and opts for her own
urgent, concert-like projection. My favorite so far
is “Little Darlin’,” a nicely woven tune with spec-
torish drums and a very clean mix.

Vocally it is magnificent — lots of talking,
singing and catchy background vocals. Nothing
new wave about Spider, they have the foundations
for a long future in rock.

NOTES: Grateful Dead’s latest is out and ready
for purchase. There are some nice efforts on the
album, but nothing hits me yet...Pete Townsend’s

- new album “Empty Glass” is very nice and whoish,
but with the brains of Townsend behind all the in-
struments, “Empty Glass’’ is a winner... Thanks to
Louisiana Leroux for the best thinking rock we’ve
had at W&L in the last five years...their new
album will be out on Capitol records this summer.

Little Darlings — Praise has not been abundant for this story of

talent has not ripened with age, and T.V. actress Kristy McNichol

The Washington & Lee
Generals continued their im-
pressive season by routing the
Roanoke Maroons’ lacrosse
team, currently ranked second
in the nation in Division II, by a
score of 15-6.

The Generals showed no mer-
cy as they gained revenge for
losses to Roanoke over the past
two years. The Generals out-
shot the Maroons, kept them
primarily on defense, and came
away with yet another scoring
streak, this one bringing ten
consecutive goals.

Roanoke held tough for the
first quarter, due mainly to to
the play of its goalie, John
Neurohr. W&L shots which
Neurohr did not block bounced
over the goal due to the hard-
ness of the Maroons’ crease.

‘The first quarter ended 2-1 in
Roanoke's favor.

The second quarter marked
the start of the scoring streak
which lasted until the latter half
of the third quarter. Rob
Staugaitt is decided enough was
enough and scored twice after
John Sancilio tied the score at 2-
all. This gave the Generals a 4-2
halftime lead.

Chris Kearney led the scoring
in the third quarter by by con-
necting three times, while
Roman Kupecky, George San-
tos. Art Caltrider and Geotf
Brent each scored once. The put
the Generals into a comman-
ding 12-3 lead going into the
fourth period.

Koaunoke managed to score
three more times in the fourth
quarter, but not before W&L
had also put in three more
tallies. Bob Carpenter,

The 1980 edition of the varsity
baseball team has finished its
season and now, on the surface
it appears as if this year wasn't
any different from last year or
any of the other umpteen losing
seasons in Washington and Lee
history, '

This, however, is not true.

Improvements occurred in all
facets of the team this year ex-
cept in the “win” column. The
overall record was 5-13, which
is one better than last year’s
4-17 mark. '

Losing seasons aren't any-
thing new to W&L’s baseball
since the school has had only 20
winning years out of over sixty
seasons of play. And only three

tos is second) each scored to
end the game at 15-6 in favor of
the Generals.

The Generals continued to
play impressive lacrosse, fin-
ding and exploiting their oppo-
nent’s weaknesses as well as
rotating players to the fullest
extent. With a record of 10-1 and
only two games left in the
season, a playoff bid for W&L is
now virtually assured.

 

Generals 17
Rutgers 7

 

by Robert Massie

The Generals continued their
undefeated record at home and
regained the No, 3 position in
the USILA Lacrosse poll by
humiliating Rutgers University
17-7 before a Spring Weekend
crowd of almost 3,000 on Wilson
Field last Saturday.

The Generals’ lacrosse team
put together one of their best
games this season and shined in
every aspect. ‘‘We played a
solid 60 minutes. of lacrosse,”
commented coach Jack Emmer

of these have come since 1960,

The reason for the poor show-
ing this year appears to have
come from erratic scheduling of
games due to inclimate weather
and the break between the
winter and the spring terms.
Top performances in baseball
(unlike football or Lacrosse) oc-
cur when teams play every day.

The Generals didn’t have this
benefit because: (1) they had
ten games rained out in a four
week period and (2) were fore-
ed to play eight games in eight
days after a two week lay-off for
winter term exams.

These factors kept the team
from getting into any kind of
rythmn and caused erratic
showings in many of the games:

‘and we gained a little momen-
tum for our remaining games.”

The first quarter ended in a
2-2 tie with W&L goals by Geoff
Brent and Jay Foster. Though
the Generals were finding the
openings and took a lot of shots
on goal (21), they were just off
the mark and managed to score
only twice.

In the second quarter the
Generals zeroed in on the net
and produced one of their
patented scoring bursts, netting
six straight goals starting at the
14:51 mark.

The half ended with W&L in
the lead 8-4.

The most impressive score of
the third period came when
Jerry Broccoli, usually a defen-
sive and fast-break artist, went
in to score when the Generals
were a man down. Broccoli also
captured Player-of-the-Game
honors.

The third quarter ended with
the Generals in a commanding
14-6 lead.

The final period saw W&L
outscore Rutger’s Scarlet

Coach Chuck Kroll, in his see-
ond year as head coach of the
team, points out that one must
look beyond the team’s record
to see the improvements made.
‘First of all, the attitude of the
players was different from last
year. We were hungrier than
last year’s team but we didn't
inflict any of the pressure on
ourselves that I saw happening
last season. The players were
always working hard and they
never complained about some
of the tough breaks we had in
our schedule,”’ said Kroll.

The team statistics also point
out that the W&L team played
better baseball this year. Com-
pared to last year, the team had
a higher batting percentage,

 

Knights 3-1 with goals by Mike
Pressler, Chris Kearney and
Defensiveman John Sancilio to
put the final tally at 17-7.

Throughout the game the
Generals looked sharp in every
catagory. Their passes were
sharp and accurate and they
penetrated well inside, even the
outside shots found the mark.
They picked up ground balls
well and generally played good,
aggressive Lacrosse.

Twelve different Generals
scored as every member of the
team got into the action and the
crowd showed their apprecia-
tion by enthusiastic applause,

Geoff Brent continued his
scoring by netting two goals as
did George Santos, John
Hooper, John Kemp and Jay
Foster. Rob Staugitis and Mike
Pressler led the assist catagory
with three apiece.

Goalie Bob Clements played
another excellent game with 16
blocked shots and Ware
Palmer, taking over in the goal
in the second half, didn’t allow a
single shot to pass him by.

twice as many extra base hits,
less strikeouts and a_ higher
fielding percentage.

It was also a time for several
firsts this year. In a double-
header against Emory & Henry,
the Generals, for the first time
in four years, completed a
sweep of both games and
recorded their first shutout
(7-0) at the time.

This season was also the first

time W&L beat Randolph-
Macon in baseball.
In individual notes, Thad

Ellis led the team in hitting
(,393), Chris Cavalline in total
bases (44), Chip Childs in pit-
ching (2.50 era), and Jeff Hag-
gerty in fielding (.971 ave. )

The Generals, now 9-1 on the
season, showed that they can
play the caliber lacrosse that
they are capable of; even with
the draining two-game _ per
week schedule they have been
facing.

 

Generals 15
Baltimore 6

 

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
Generals Lacrosse team travel-
ed to Baltimore University in
Baltimore, Md. last Wednesday
and walked away with a convin-
cing 15-6 win.

The Generals upped their
overall record to 8-1 and
brought a possible playoff bid
closer to home.

The first half of the game was
tight as the Baltimore Bees
played well on defense, not
allowing the inside pass. The
result was a University of
Baltimore lead of one goal, 4-3,
at the half.

Geoff Brent scored two of the
three Generals’ goals, with two
coming on extra man situa-
tions.

In the second half, the
Generals began to penetrate the
Bee’s defense.

After two W&L scores and one
by Baltimore to tie the game at
five, the Generals came up with
six consecutive goals in a little
over three minutes to put them
well in the lead, 11-5.

The Generals continued to
dominate play for the rest of the
game, virtually shutting down
Baltimore's offense and scoring
on 9 of 16 extra man plays. W&L
scored once more in the third
period and three times in the
fourth to lock up the 15-6 vic-
tory.

W&L Baseball Only Season Away

According to Kroll, ‘leaving
the team will be five seniors
who have done a tremendous
job. They led the team in so
many different ways and will be

missed next season.’’ Grad-
uating will be pitchers By
Steele, Vic Sheppard, and

Childs. Along with them will be
infielder John Stagmier and
outfielder Don Swagart.

The outlook for next year is
optimistic. The Generals will
have onr junior, seven sopho-
mores, and six freshmen retur-
ning. Kroll feels that if the team
can work on improving upon the
pitching they will be ‘‘one step
away from. having, a great
season.”

On April 28-29, the
Washington and Lee varsity
tennis team didn’t just win its
fourth ODAC team title in as
many years; the netmen vir-
tually walked away with the en-
tire tournament. Before that
Tuesday afternoon was over,
four Generals had taken first
place in their singles flights,
while two others took second. In
doubles, it was a virtual W&L
sweep, with Generals capturing
the crown at the first and se-
cond flights, while posting a
secondplace finish at third.

Senior co-captain Stewart
Jackson ended his senior year

as he began it, as the ODAC’s
first singles champion. Jackson
eliminated Scott Goodman of
Hampden-Sydney in the finals,
7-6, 6-2.

Peter Lovell, a junior who
was moved up to second singles
for the tournament, rose to the
occasion as he routed Lynch-
burg’s Kevin Record, 6-2, 6-1, to
claim the second singles crown.
David Constine, senior co-
captain and last year’s fourth
singles champion, moved up to
third singles but remained a
champion as he crushed Bo

Two Sports Are
Treated Poorly

by Bill Whalen

Washington and Lee is a
school which prides itself in its
philosophy of not recruiting
athletes or trying to compete
with the big-time public schools
in most intercollegiate sports.
Yet beneath this philosophy lies
a schizophrenia of how certain
sports are treated.

Take the sports of baseball
and tennis, for example.

The baseball team has long
been mired in the depths of los-
ing seasons. Yet in the past few
seasons, the team has shown
marked improvement, But
despite the team’s improve-
ment, the university has seem-
ed anything but enthusiastic
over the prospects of a winning
baseball program.

This is why the team is coach-
ed by a man who was brought to
the school originally as a foot-
ball coach.

Before I go any further, I do
not at all mean to slander Chuck
Kroll. He seems to have a gen-
uine enthusiasm for the
Washington and Lee baseball

 

  

program and he is trying his
hardest to make the program
into a winner.

Who I really find at fault is
the administration. While Kroll
is giving the baseball team his
best shot and the program is on
the rise, the fact still remains
that the University is treating
the sport as a second class
citizen by dishing it off on a
coach who would probably pre-
fer to spend his time coaching
football.

Kroll is doing a good job with
the program, but he probably
would be willing to step down in
favor of another man who has
more experience in coaching
collegiate baseball.

The same can be said about
Washington and Lee’s tennis
program. The school currently
has given the job to Gary
Franke, who originally came to
this school to coach wrestling.

Very few people realize it, but
the varsity tennis team has
been a _ consistent winner
against other teams both in
Division I play and the NCAA

singles during the season, mov-
ed to the fourth spot for the tour-
nament and it payed off; Shar-
man came from behind to
demolish Jim Cain of Hampden-
Sydney, 5-7, 6-1, 6-0.

Both freshman Steve Denny
and sophomore Wes Younge,
after winning their first two
matches, succumbed in the
finals finishing second overall.
Denny, playing at the fifth
flight, lost a tough 2-6, 6-3, 6-2
match to Lou Dibos_ of
Hampden-Sydney, while
Younge, at sixth, fell to Jeff
Armbruster of Hampden-
Sydney, 7-5, 6-4.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 8, 1980, Page 21

Netmen Control ODAC Tourney (Again)

Jackson and Lovell later add-
ed a first place finish at the top
flight doubles position, cruising
past Hampden-Sydney’s team,
6-4, 6-1. Constine and Denny
followed closely behind at the
second position, taking the title
in a 6-3, 6-0 rout over their
Hampden-Sydney opponent.
But it was H-S’ third doubles
team that prevailed over the
duo of W&L’s senior Pat Norris
and Wes Younge, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 in
the finals, giving W&L the third
of its three second place
finishes.

In addition to winning their
fourth ODAC title in a row, the

 

Division II] Tournament. Only
the lacrosse team can boast of
as many appearances in post-
season play.

Yet once again, the school has
treated the tennis program like
a second-class citizen. Does the
school really believe that a ten-
nis team can prosper without
the advice of a seasoned tennis
coach? So far, the tennis team
has gotten as far as it has ona
lot of pure talent.

Seniors:

Pick up your reprints
before May 15th or you
will not receive a copy
of the yearbook.
Someone will be in

the Calyx office every

morning.

Once again, I do not mean to
take an unnecessary swipe at
Gary Franke. He seems to en-
joy coaching tennis and the
players like him. But like any
other coach in his situation, his
first love is wrestling.

Of course the University will
make the argument that it can-
not bring along any more
coaches because there is not
any room on the school’s staff.
This is due to the fact that so
many athletic ‘‘professors’’

Generals will keep another
tradition going by sending a
strong team to the NCAA III
Championships at Claremont-
Mudd College in Claremont,
California. The tournament will
be held May 14-17, and this year
marks the fourth time in a row
that the W&L netmen have
gone.

This year’s team will include
Jackson, Lovell, Constine, and
Sharman at the singles spots.
Jackson and Lovell will again
team up as the first doubles
team, while Gaker and Norris
will man the second doubles

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Mock Convention
Spirits

For at least two days this weekend the Washington

and Lee community will be immersed in another
world.

Attention will be focused on little Lexington,
Virginia, to see the results of the 1980 Republican
Mock Convention.

Much of this attention will come from the media
and it should be focused on the proceeding of the ac-
tual convention, not the behavior of the students of
Washington and Lee.

Lest the writer be criticized for acting like an old
maid, of for being more paranoid that a father sen-
ding his daughter out on her first date, which happens
to be at a fraternity party, let some examples of W&L
students’ behavior in years past be recalled.

_ In 1960 Harry Truman was pelted with various ob-
jects, from oranges to beer cans, while people
chanted ‘‘Give’em hell Harry.”’

Though John F. Kennedy was nominated that year,
the conduct of W&L students nearly received as much
press as the actual outcome of the convention.

And not too long ago an overzealous W&L lacrosse
fan saw fit to dump a drink on the Navy lacrosse
coach's wife.

Even more recently a large crowd listening to a
band in the old gym during a big weekend was stunn-
ed when one W&L student smashed a bottle over
another's face.

We hope that no such unfortunate incidents will oc-
cur this weekend, the Mock Convention Steering Com-
mittee has put alot of time and thought into planning
the latest edition of the Convention.

So remember, no matter how much you celebrate
this weekend, have a good time but don’t do

something you will regret when you see it on the even-
ing news.

it was to comment on a more
important matter — the over-all

Dear Editor:

Recently we had the great
pleasure of joining the
Washington and Lee Glee Club
on part of its London concert
tour during Spring Break.

Under the superior direction
of Dr. Gordon Spice, accom-
panied by his wife, Ann, and his
parents from Missouri, this ex-
cellent group of handsome,
talented, well-mannered and
cultured young gentlemen
represented the United States
and Washington and Lee in the
most diplomatic and traditional
manner.

No Nukes

Dear Editor:

When I saw the picture of the rain-soaked crowd
at the Washington anti-nuke rally two weeks ago,
and then read the article which duly anathematiz-
ed it as a band of left-wing crackpots, I shook my
head and said ‘‘Why bother?’’ The media has done
such an effective job of associating the anti-
nuclear movement with personalities and causes

which are alienating to middle America that it vir- > e

tually ensures that legitimate discussions of the
subject fall on deaf ears. More nukes, less kooks,
hah-hah, hand me another beer. Why bother in-
deed?

Characteristic responses of W&L students to
nuclear power issues also fall into patterns which
indicate that opinions may be based more on
parents’ revulsion for Jane Fonda than personal
assessment of benefit vs. risk. However, it is
possible after a time to see past knee-jerk
responses into the heart of the anti-nuclear posi-
tion, and discover that the position usually rests on
one or more of three fundamental beliefs, all of
them wrong.

(1) What you can’t see won’t hurt you. If drunk
and backed into a corner, most W&L students will
angrily respond with their gut-level feeling that
people are not dropping like flies around nuclear
power plants and what the hell is all the brouhaha
about, anyway. This is an understandable carry-
over from our primate past, where unseen
dangers lay mostly in the spiritual realm. But this
is the modern age — radiation, slowly and
cumulatively, kills. A _ full-fledged reactor
economy (about 200 reactors, or three times the
number we have now) will under normal operat-
ing conditions leak enough radiation to cause
200,000 cancers a year in twenty years unless it is
99.999 percent efficient in containment. (See Dr.
John Gofman, Irreverent Illustrated View of
Nuclear Power). This is a degree of perfection
never attained in any industry (airlines are good,
but nowhere that good); when you use machines,
things go wrong. The near disasters at Fermi in
1966, Brown's Ferry in 1975, and Three Mile Island
in 1979 prove this beyond contention.

We are, sadly, out of the primitive age and into a
new one where statistics accumulate and inter-
twine to paint a more accurate picture of reality
than our own senses. We need a banker’s eye for
the ultimate results of small effects, added
together over time. If we do not have it, we will
certainly one day smack into a radiation growth
curve, as real and substantial as compound in-
terest; but the profits we take will be counted in
grief.

(2) We need nuclear power to decrease our
dependence on foreign oil, and eliminate that as a
possible cause for war. The student saying this is
likely to betray a feeling that, hmm, deep down in-
side, going to war over oil (or anything else) might
not be such a bad idea at all. In fact, only about 10
percent of our oil is used for generating electrici-
ty. Nuclear power is used exclusively for generat-
ing electricity. If we convert entirely to nuclear,
we will still be consuming petroleum at 90 percent
of our present rate (Harvard Business School,
Energy Futures), assuming consumption for
other uses does not rise. How will this eliminate
our need for foreign oil? Moreover, and this is an
important moreover, uranium is a_ scarce
mineral, of which this country has only a 10-15
year supply remaining. Uranium prices have
already risen 600 percent in 6 years — what hap-
pens when we run out? Almost certainly we will
find ourselves dealing with a usurous UPEC, cut-
ting their heartless pound of flesh with as much
gusto as the Arab nations do today. Future
scenarios could include war with Australia over
its uranium — a tragedy, since they make such
fine beer.

The real untapped energy source in this country
is efficient technology. About half of all energy
consumed is simply wasted, leaked through unin-
sul ‘ted ceilings and blown out through smoke-
stacks. These flaws in design can be corrected,
will be corrected, if the market is permitted to res-

 

pond to new, more realistic perceptions of the
availability of energy resources. When oil prices
go up, engineers and architects will find ways to
save oil, something they have not done in the past
largely because they have not had to.

It is not gigantic central mega-planning, Soviet
Union style, which will get us through the energy
crisis; the result of such planning everywhere is
waste and failure based on wishful thinking. It is
many, many enterprising individuals, always this
country’s strength, acting on true data free from
government meddling, which will point us in the
direction of national survival like a compass nee-
dle toward the pole.

(3) In the long run, we will do whatever is
cheapest. This is a shark’s-eye view of the reality
of economic process, elicited from the cynical in
dark, smoky rooms. It is absolutely correct. It is
therefore imperative to realize that nuclear power
is anything but-cheap; its costs do not appear only
in utility bills, but are also buried deep in the
federal budget. Nuclear and coal generated elec-
tricity are now about equally costly, if one con-
siders only utility rates; but including fuel enrich-
ment, reprocessing, waste storage and other sub-
sidies, consuming $2 billion worth of tax dollars in
1980, we see that nuclear power is vastly more ex-
pensive than coal.

A greater expense than direct subsidy is the
psychological price we pay in exempting the in-
dustry from responsibility for its acts. The $560
million dollar limit on liability set by the Price-
Anderson Act amounts to little more than a license
to kill. Congress, prompted by nuclear True
Believers, has committed its grossest insults to
the Bill of Rights in the name of nuclear power. It
is as if Congress has forced us to hire a bad-
tempered giant with a stick, at our own expense,
to work for us, but if the giant were to cut loose and
beat the hell out of somebody with the stick, well,
too bad — it’s our fault for hiring him! !

Now is it a surprise that fledgling attempts at
alternative solutions to the energy problem have
trouble competing with the massively subsidized
nuclear energy? What private entrepreneur can
risk the $20 billion in research and development
capital spent by the government in 30 years of
nuke-mongering? Geothermal, photovoltaic,
wind, ocean thermal and several other tender
young flowers of human genius are being expected
to compete with an overgrown, poisonous weed. If
you want to reckon the cost, add this one to the
nuclear side of the ledger: our other possible
futures.

Returning to that crowd of cold, wet idealists
and their desperate dreams, I asked m¥self again,
why bother? And I must answer, because they are
right. Their solutions are not my solutions, but
their analysis of the problem is dead on target, I
perceive them, and their freakish vision, as an ad-
vance receptor for the human race nervous
system, like a woman’s intuition or a bird’s
awareness of danger. They sense the ongoing rape
of the earth and the fallacy that one can take
forever, without ever giving back. To them and to
me, cooling stacks are an impetuous and terrible
symbol: Man’s Dominion at last, over a dead
planet.

As someone said, it may come down blue or it
may come down green, but all of it is going to
come down heavy. Count on it.

_Ring-tum Phi Investigation

 

Problems With Graham-Lees

by Edward Gonsalves

Graham-Lees dormitory
rates ‘‘not too high” on a scale
measuring fire prevention and
protection, according to
Charles Wisecarver, Housing
Inspector and Chief of Sanita-
tion for the Rockbridge County
Health Department.

After completing an inspec-
tion of Graham-Lees Dormi-
tory, for the Ring-tum Phi,
Wisecarver stressed the need
for a fire escape and better elec-
trical wiring. .

When asked if the dormitories
should have fire escapes, Wise-
carver declared ‘‘unquestion-
ably, yes”’.

He refused to speculate as to
why the University has failed to
construct fire escapes even
though they are part of the cur-
rent state safety standards.

But Frank Parsons, assistant
to the president, claims that
building codes applied to old
buildings are ‘‘subject to local
administration and interpreta-
tion.”

Parsons went on to say that
the reason fraternities are re-
quired to have fire escapes
while the dormitories are not is
because fraternities are ‘‘more
unsupervised,’ therefore allow-
ing the “building directors to

lean more heavily on them with
respect to current safety stan-
dards.”

Another major flaw of
Graham-Lees Dormitory is the
condition of the electrical
wiring.

Labeling the electrical condi-
tions as poor, Wisecarver notic-
ed many potentially dangerous
electrical outlets and cords.

He said that it would be ‘“‘very
easy for anyone to suffer an
electrical shock” from some of
the outlets.

Wisecarver noted that many
of the refrigerators used by the
students in Graham-Lees are
connected to the outlets with
very questionable extension
cords. A lot of the cord, accord-
ing to Wisecarver, seemed very
small and brittle to be used as
extension cords, especially with
the age of the electrical wiring
of the dormitory.

Wisecarver said that areas in
the dormitory where the plaster
is loose and peeling off are in
violation of the Lexington Hous-
ing Code.

Although Wisecarver said
there were plenty of fire
alarms, he _ still questioned
whether they were operable
because no fire drills take
place. (State regulations re-

 

LEXINGTON — Edward Lee
Pinney, professor of politics at
Washington and Lee University
and one of W&L’s most highly
regarded and_ well-liked
teachers for 17 years, died sud-
denly Wednesday afternoon. He
was 49.

Dr. Pinney and his wife,
Winston, were playing tennis
when he was stricken with an
apparent heart attack. He died
almost immediately.

Funeral arrangements were
incomplete Wednesday night.

Surviving him in addition to
his wife are his mother, Mrs.
Robert Pasho of Pensacola,
Fla.; and two sons, Reese B.
and Edward Lee Jr., both of
Lexington.

He was born Nov. 2, 1930, in
Jacksonville, Fla., and received
his undergraduate education at
Auburn University in Alabama.
He earned his master’s and
Ph.D. degrees in_ political
science at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He taught at Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, prior
to joining the W&L political
science faculty in 1963. His
fields of teaching specialty in-

cluded European governmental

 

systems, and he was a par-

ticular authority on the postwar
government of West Germany.

He was the author of the book
‘Federalism, Bureaucracy,
and Party Politics in West Ger-
many and edited another
book, ‘Comparative Politics
and Political Theory,’ which he
developed as a tribute to one of
his graduate professors at
Chapel Hill.

One of Dr. Pinney’s distinc-
tive traits was an unparalleled
wit, which was based on a vast
vocabulary and a_ jet-speed
ability to pick out flaws of logic
or philosophy in any discussion,
no matter how exotic the topic
— and to see and play upon the

quire regular fire drills. )

According to Parsons, an ade-
quate alternative to the state
safety codes exist. He believes
that the present system, where-
by every floor has a planned
escape route and every room
has a fire extinguisher, is
enough protection against any
fire hazard — even without
regular fire drills, until the
renovation of Graham-Lees is
completed sometime in 1982.

Parsons said that renovation
of Graham-Lees has been con-
sidered for many years, but it is
only in the past year that it has
become a high priority.

(The renovation is in the
schematic stage and alternate
methods are being considered.
The Board of Trustees will meet
later on this month to decide the
manner in which the renovation
will occur. )

No matter which way the
dorm is renovated, it will be up-
dated to meet state safety and
health codes.

When asked if the dormitory
would pass the W&L fraternity
fire safety checklist, Wise-
carver hesitatingly said, ‘‘no
comment.”

Trouble On

by David Greer

For the past week, many
students walking from Main
Street down Nelson and across
the bridge have found them-
selves accosted, harrassed, and
in some instances beaten by
local youths hanging out there.

So far, two locals have been
arrested in connection with the
incidents.

Last Wednesday night, two
freshmen, David Smith and
John Solitario, were crossing
the bridge and were accosted.
During the scuffle, Solitario
reportedly sustained a_ knife
wound to the hand.

Marshall David Clark, 20, of
644 Waddell St. was arrested on
a complaint by Smith for
assault and battery in connec-
tion with the incident.

Later that same night, Mike
Cost and Andy Holds, both
students, and Jeff Donahue, a
guest of theirs, were crossing
the bridge when two cars pulled
into a service station at the end
of the bridge. According to
Donahue, someone jumped
them from behind and a group
of five youths began beating
Holds. Others joined the crowd
and there were about 10 people
involved. The gang left, how-

police arrived, and confiscated
a baseball bat une of the

Nonetheless, the bat was con-

EC Revises Plagiarism
Pamphlet, Kills Salaries

by Randy Smith

At a special meeting yester-
day afternoon, the student body
Executive Committee took the
first step in ratifying a new ver-
sion of Washington and Lee’s
plagiarism pamphlet.

The new pamphlet, which was
composed by Senior represen-
tative Dee Keesler and EC
President-Elect Bob Willis with
the help of faculty and students,
more directly addresses
plagiarism problems at W&L.

The book defines plagiarism
as: ‘‘The unacknowledged use
of someone else’s work in...an
attempt to deceive one’s reader
into thinking that it is one’s
own.”’

examples are

shorter than the old version and
the new pamphlet tries to be
clearer in defining exactly what
constitutes plagiarism at W&L.

The new book also notes that
some journalism assignments
and law school work employ dif-
ferent styles where the source
of information would not be ap-
propriately footnoted or
acknowledged. ‘‘Where no pro-
per means for acknowledging
indebtedness within the assign-
ment are available, the Honor
Code does not require acknowl-
edgement,’’ the pamphlet
states.

The book, which was months
in preparation, identifies three
areas of plagiarism: (1) “‘lying

Phi Beta Kappa President
To Speak At Library Dedication

Dr. Edgar Finley Shannon Jr.
— currently the national presi-
dent of Phi Beta Kappa, former
president of the University of
Virginia, Rhodes Scholar grad-
uate of Washington and Lee
University, and member of the
W&L board of trustees — will be
the chief speaker at the dedica-
tion of Washington and Lee’s $9-
million undergraduate library
May 24.

The 130,000-square-foot facili-
ty, completed in 1979, will be
dedicated in a two-day series of
celebrations and ceremonies
beginning Friday, May 23. The
events have been scheduled to
coincide with the spring
meeting of W&L’s board, and
among the events to which the
public is invited will be a recep-
tion Friday evening in the new
building.

The dedication activities will
begin Friday (May 23) at 11:30
a.m. when Warren J. Haas,
president of the Council on
Library Resources and former
librarian at Columbia Universi-
ty, will speak in the Mary
Moody Northen Auditorium in
the new W&L building.

The trustees’ reception will
take place at 8:30 p.m. that
evening.

Dr. Shannon will speak at
11:30 the following morning at
the actual dedication ceremony

Skyrocketing Textbook Prices

by David Dallam

The increasing cost of tex-
tbooks is a matter of primary
concern among Washington and
Lee students.

Inflation and other factors
have been taking their toll on
the pocketbook of the average
student (or his parents), for
quite some time.

While the comprehensive tui-
tion fee for undergraduates has
increased from $3,700 in the fall
of 1979 to $4,050 next fall, the
cost of textbooks for a single
course may be as much as $45
and in some cases higher.

The time may come when a
student will consider the cost of
his books before taking a par-
ticular course.

One aspect of the textbook
problem is the conflict between
the store manager and
publisher.

Most publishers suggest the
retail price that the store should
charge for a given book and a
publisher will usually offer a 20
to 22 percent discount on his
books. The store will only break
even with a 28 to 30 percent in-
crease over the publisher’s
price.

Under such a system, the
bookstore becomes only mar-
ginally profitable. Betty
Munger, manager of the W&L
bookstore, says publishers
claim to be losing money by of-
fering their customary dis-
counts, and she cites the in-
creasing use of computers and
the edition of revised texts as
possible factors in their increas-
ed costs of publication.

Yet, she counters their claims
by stating that most of the ma-
jor publishing companies are
owned by congolmerates which

ensure that they are kept in the
black.

But congolmerate control
may be a problem in itself, for
although they give the publisher
complete editorial freedom,
they force him to stop publica-
tions which are unprofitable.
Many of these are college text-
books.

According to Mrs. Munger,
many of the smaller publishing
houses which used to cater
more adequately to the needs of
colleges and universities have
folded through mismanage-
ment.

A new policy which has
recently been innovated is net
pricing. Harper and Row Com-
pany is implementing this
system by billing the store only
for the price of its books.

The store may then deter-

will take place in the main lob-

spacious enough to accom-
modate a large crowd. )

Library Dedication
Schedule; May 23, 24

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY

As you know, Washington and Lee — the Board of Trustees and
the entire campus community — celebrates the dedication of our
new University Library on Friday and Saturday, May 23 and 24.

A number of public events will take place in the library itself dur-
ing the two days. I think we may be quite confident that the
trustees, distinguished alumni, and other notables and eminences
who will be here will not be so rowdy as to disrupt your studying
completely. But it is possible, on the other hand, that at certain
times during the dedication celebrations, the library will not be
quite as tranquil as may customarily be expected. We certainly
have no intention of discouraging you from using the library. In
fact, the opposite is true: We hope our guests will see the library ex-
actly as it is used every day — in actual routine operation. We do
simply wish to alert you to the likelihood that there will be numbers
of people, from far and wide, who will be walking through this
building from time to time. We hope and expect that the inconve-
nience to you will be minimal, but some inconvenience there may
be.

This is, of course, your library. And therefore the members of the
Board of Trustees and all of us who work and teach on the campus
hope you may find it convenient to join us for the dedication events.
The two-day program will begin with an address Friday morning
by Dr. Warren Haas, president of the Council on Library
Resources. The Board of Trustees will give a reception in the
library Friday evening to which you are warmly invited. The for-
mal dedication ceremony itself will take place Saturday morning,
and Dr. Edgar F. Shannon Jr. — national president of Phi Beta
Kappa, former president of U.Va., a W&L Rhodes Scholar, and
member of our Board of Trustees —will be the principal speaker.
And you are also invited to join us for lunch immediately after the
dedication ceremony. (In order that we may know how many to ex-
pect, we ask you to pick up a luncheon ticket in the main lobby of
the library well in advance.) Details about the dedication events
will be found in the Weekly Calendar and in news articles which will
be issued over the next two weeks by the W&L News Office.

I know you share our feeling of immense pride and satisfaction in
this excellent facility and will welcome our guests as we show our
University Library off and say thanks to those whose generosity,
energy, and talent have made it possible for us to have it.

last week that ‘‘what we did was
with the best interest of the
frats in mind.”

Farrar said, however, that he
feels the actions and_ public
relations of this year's IFC
were hampered by “‘inaccu-
rate” and ‘‘biased’’ reporting
by the Ring-tum Phi.

Saying, “I cannot compli-
ment the members of the
Judicial Board enough,’ Far-
rar added that he felt the
members worked well together
as a group because they were
not dominated by one indi-
vidual. ‘I don't think there was
any favoritism shown toward
Red Square or non-Red Square
fraternities,’ he continued.

Citing the Phi's reporting of
the SAE-Phi Delta-Phi Kap
Fancy Dress affair, Farrar said
that he felt some stories were
inaccurately reported. ‘The
SAE, Phi Delt and Phi Kap
houses were placed on one
week’s social probation simply
because there are no parties
allowed on Sunday, not because
they went over the deadline by
an hour-and-a-half as was
reported in the Phi,"Farrar
stated.

Farrar also said that he felt
the reporting of the decision on
Wednesday night parties was
‘“‘a complete blow-up on partial
facts.”

‘I did not feel as though there
was a personal vendetta being
run against me by the Ring-tum
Phi, I just felt that there was a
lot of inaccurate reporting,”
Farrar added.

“You hear a lot about the
power of the press in politics

classes, and you don’t realize
that that newspaper (the Phi)
carries a lot of weight around
here — it’s the only campus
news source,” Farrar said.
“Certainly it is better than hav-
ing rumors circulating, but it is
of the utmost importance that
the reporting be as accurate as
possible,’ he added.

Pointing out Phi editorials
and Jim Fineman’s articles
about the IFC this year, Farrar
stated, ‘I think Jim had some
good ideas, but it seemed like
everything Jim wrote was
above rebuttal.’’ He added that,
“We were accused of passing
the buck by giving the PiKA-
FiGi case to Student Control,
and yet at the same time,
earlier in the year, we were told
that we were wrong in our
handling of the SAE case by not
turning it over to Student Con-
trol.”

“There were no suggestions,
just criticism,” he said.

Farrar did say however, that
his biggest disappointment over
the year was his handling of the
SAE incident at the beginning of
the year, in which the SAE
house was punished as a whole
for the actions of some of its in-
dividual members at the
Howard Johnson's out on Route

Future Of New Frat Still In Doubt

After voting last week to ac-
cept a new fraternity, the Inter-
fraternity Council left the
group's future at Washington
and Lee in doubt. Another vote
to accept the new fraternity will
be held next week.

“This is my fault entirely,”
said IFC President Monte
Briscoe. “I just took it that we
needed a majority vote.’ The
IFC's constitution requires a
three-fourths vote of accep-
tance to admit a new fraternity
into the group.

The fraternity, ACACIA,
would be a community service
oriented group and is affiliated
with the Masons. The organizer
of the fraternity, Stan Doobin,
told the IFC that he already has
15 potential members and the
backing of the national
organization.

Last week, the IFC voted 9-4-3
to admit the new group. The
three abstentions were all
houses absent from the meet-
ing. But the admittance vote
was not a three-quarters ma-
jority.

“IT should have sent it to Stu-
dent Control so that the in-
dividual members could be
punished instead of the house as
a whole,” he stated.

Farrar said that he was also
very unhappy with this year's
block voting for the IFC elec-
tions. “I don't think that in
block voting you can get. the
best overall results — it’s not a
natural democratic process,”
he said

He added however, that he
thinks the officers elected this
spring will be strong. ‘I don’t
want to take anything away
from them, I just do not feel
that .it is a good process,”’ he
added.

Farrar said that one of his
major problems this year was
with his meetings with the SAC,
“The SAC meetings were clos-
ed, and I didn’t have a group to
confer with,’ Farrar stated. ‘‘I
just had to vote my conscience
— evidently the students
thought it was wrong.”’

“IT could have vindicated
myself, but we agreed that the
decisions would remain con-
fidential,’’ Farrar added.

Discussing the Faculty-IFC-
Administration situation, Far-
rar stated, ‘I think very few
students realize how strongly

Several IFC representatives
argued against admitting the
new fraternity at Tuesday's
meeting. The basic argument
against admittance was that the
IFC at W&L is already too large
and that one more fraternity
would place a financial burden
on the other established groups.

“Who's to say we can deny
them the right to colonize,”
countered Briscoe.

“If they're just a service
fraternity, I don’t see why we
should give them a vote on the
IFC,” said Alan Pryor. ‘‘There
are other service groups on this

$25,000 Boxwood Repair

the alumni feel about the frats.
They feel good about the at-
titude and physical changes
which have taken place. They
feel strongly about fraternities

see them go down.”

Farrar added, ‘Changes are
so easy to come about. It was a
big change to have Wednesday
night parties. After three or
four years it will probably be
history.”

“IT am firmly convinced that
the administration and faculty
think that what they are doing is
best for the school in the long
run. We are here for only four
years — it is they who are and
should be concerned with the
long run,”’ he continued.

“I’m not saying the student

relationship with Dean John,
but I was never told what to
do,” Farrar added.

placed on the conduct of in-

this to community relations is

“We should try to keep this

last fully independent fraternity
systems in the country.
Changes are occurring how-

havoc with the fraternities, and
things will have to change —

added.

Farrar concluded by saying,
“College life is to be enjoyed,
not argued over. No matter
what rules are made, the
students are going to find some
way to have fun to get away
from their studies when they
are through — that is one thing
you can not change.”

Movie Review

‘Darlings’ Fail To

by John Wells

Little Darlings, which has
been held over for an additional
week at the State, is a smutty,
innocuous attempt at pubescent
humor which contains a handful
of laughs and line after line of
incredibly bad dialogue.

I will admit that I walked into
the theater with a jaundiced
mind, expecting the worst, and
in that respect was completely
satisfied. Here are two adoles-
cent stars of individual ac-
complishment in a ludicrously
advertised picture with an R
rating slapped on to insure
greater box office earnings.
Little Darlings’ central pro-
blem seems to be a total lack of
credibility.

Tatum O’Neal, who hasn’t
landed a decent role since she
won a premature oscar for
Paper Moon way back when,
shares top billing with Kristy
McNichol whose only previous
movie was The End as Burt
Reynolds’ daughter. O’Neal has
grown quite a bit, but her
talents have not matured with
the years. McNichol displays
great talent and marvelous
potential for a future starring
career. Why she wasted herself
on this trash is hard to fathom
(until you realize how much
money she probably got for it. )

The film opens with introduc-
tions of the two girls, preparing
to go to summer camp, and we
can tell that Tatum is rich and
Kristy is not because one ar-
rives in a Rolls and the other in
a battered ’68 Chevy. After they
reach their destination, Camp
Little Wolf, the plot (no secret if
you've read the poster) unfolds.

The two, who don’t exactly hit
it off at first, share a cabin with
a group of stereotypes of nearly
every kind, save ethnic
varieties: a conceited child
model who looks like Brooke
Shields, wears bedtime attire
from Frederick’s, says stuff
like ‘Nobody makes a fool outta
me, is that clear?”’ and is a real

We ie) Fe

bitch; a flower-child who is into
vitamins, daisy chains, and is
heard to remark ‘This is bad
Karma,”’; and a fat girl named
Chubby. All the girls (except
Kristy) are  pseudo-
sophisticated, using big words,
quoting Shakespeare, and
simultaneously squealing about
John Travolta and Andy Gibb’s
rear end (apparently there is a
distinction).

I wasn’t expecting a polished
production, so it made perfect
sense for torrential downpours
to fall from sunshiney skies,
and noctural scenes to take
place in obvious daylight. The
musical director has been kind
enough to subject the audience
to an interpolation of several
timeless melodies such as “Let
Your Love Flow” and “Shake It.”

One unbelievable scene
follows the next. The girls hop
on a camp bus and take off for
town, apparently for the sole
purpose of removing a condom
dispenser from the men’s room
of a filling station. The place
has a big OPEN sign on the
door, but no one seems to care
that seven silly-looking teenage
girls have driven up in a yellow
school bus and noisily removed
a profitable machine from the
premises. They don’t even get
caught ripping off the bus.

The obligatory food fight
scene is equally realistic, when
one considers it takes place at
breakfast where tartar sauce,
raw eggs, and flour become
suddenly available for the cast
to hur] at each other.

Kristy McNichol is a fine
young actress and truly
transcends the material (her
first scene requires her to
huskily boot an _ unfortunate
greaser in the groin). Of course
some scenes are so poorly con-
ceived they’d make anyone look
pretty bad. But, despite the fact
that she chain smokes to the
point of encouraging this writer
to consider giving it up,
McNichol is the most ex-

pressive and most effective
feature of Darlings.

Tatum O’Neal floats through
her role and nearly out of the
picture, resorting to eye-
crinkling cutsiness she has
previously avoided unless for
comic effect. This will probably
be a financial boost to her
recently sagging career.

Matt Dillon, this country’s
newest sensation according to
the posters, plays McNichol’s
prospective lover from the
boy’s camp across the lake (and
you can be she keeps the water
hot canoeing back and forth as
frequently as she does). The
boy’s camp activities seem to
be limited to drinking beer,
skinny-dipping, and spinning
around on trail bikes. Anyhow,
Dillon, who obviously has taken
this sensation business serious-
ly, snerls his upper lip and
garbles most of his lines soun-
ding like a cross between
Belushi’s Brando send-ups and
Sly Stallone under anesthesia.
Nothing he does betrays
qualities the audience might
confuse for intelligence, so one
is confounded when he makes
the fantastic admission
‘Sometimes I come out here to
think.’’ Right, stud.

The film rapidly deter-
riorates towards the end as an
attempt is made to be con-
templative and serious. Actual-
ly, the last 15 minutes or so are
a study in mawkishness, with
conflicts resolved and friend-
ships rejuvenated. The bitch
gets told off by Chubby (‘‘You
think you're so good. I’d rather
be fat and feel good inside!”’).

One of O’Neal’s final lines in
the movie is ‘‘We’ve really been
idiots, y know?” I would hearti-
ly agree, and would consider
myself one for paying admis-
sion to see it but for the amount
of copy this column consumes
and the fact that admission on
Monday nights is only $1.50.

Low Air Fares

The right fare to the right
place with the right guarantees
have made the Air France
“Vacances” flights to Paris the
new choice for student summer
travel to Europe.

Almost half of last year’s
23,000 ‘‘Vacances”’ passengers
were students and teachers.

Senior Art Show

Silkscreens, drawings and
photographs are currently on
display in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery as
part of the annual senior thesis
art show. The exhibition, which
continues through June 5, will
be highlighted by a lecture and
reception in duPont Auditorium
this Sunday (May 18) at 2 p.m.
The public is invited to attend.

Five undergraduate seniors
from W&L who are represented
in the art show will speak on
their subjects in the lecture: J.
Arthur Dunnam III on_ the
history of architectural
elements in the houses of Rock-
bridge County; Douglas C.
Dorsey and Hugh Montgomery,
each with a _ variety of
silkscreens and drawings;
series of photographs by
Richard §. Essex; and an ar-
chitectural study of Rockbridge
Baths by John R. Risch.

Gallery hours are 9 to 4, Mon-
day through Friday. Admission
is free.

The program's popularity may
be attributed to its reasonable
fare, convenient non-stop
schedules, comfortable 747 air-
craft and guaranteed roundtrip
reservations. The latter are
made at the time of purchase
and ticketing.

The peak season roundtrip
fare of $512, plus $3 departure
tax, allows a stay in Europe of
between 14 and 60 days with no
advance purchase or group
restrictions.

The ‘“‘Vacances”’ Youth Fare,
valid for travelers from 12
through 22 years old, permits
stays in Europe of up to one
year for the same amount. For
an additional $50 Youth Fare-
passengers can leave with an
open return, allowing them to
make return reservations in
Europe.

From mid-June until mid-
September there will be four
weekly roundtrip ‘‘Vacances”’
flights each Monday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday departing
JFK Airport at 5:30 PM and ar-
riving the next day at Orly Air-
port at 6:30 AM. Return flights
depart Paris at 12 noon and ar-
rive in New York at 1:55 PM.

Film Society Closes Season With Fellini

by C. Kaston

The W&L Film Society will
close its second year with
Federico Fellini’s Roma (Italy,
1972). Screenings will take
place on Friday and Saturday,
May 16 and 17, at 8 P.M. in
classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge. Everyone is cor-
dially invited to attend this last
film.

Many of Fellini's mature
works have seemed so fantas-
tical, surreal, and even deca-
dent, that it is difficult to
remember that Fellini’s roots
lie in Italian Neorealism. Most
notably, Fellini worked with
Roberto Rossellini at the end of
W.W. II on the neorealist land-
mark Rome, Open City (Roma,
Citta Aperta).

Dash is gone.

He left on a Trailways bus out
of Lexington this morning head-
ed for Roanoke where he caught
a plane back to Chicago. Dash is
from Chicago, if anyone is in-
terested.

The trouble is that Dash
didn’t have a whole lot of
friends. In fact, he had many
more enemies than friends here
at friendly ol’ Washington and
Lee.

He was spat upon twice at the
Fancy Dress Ball by his fellow
students. His date cancelled out
on him when she found out who
he was. He went anyway.

Jefferson Robert Coufal.

He got the nickname ‘“‘Dash”
his second day at W&L. He was
at Natural Bridge for freshman
orientation running around try-
ing to look intellectual and a
dorm counselor called him
Dash. The nickname stuck to
the point that few people knew
his real name almost two years
later.

He probably liked it that way.

But he’s gone now. He got
himself into some trouble. He
didn’t think what he did was
that serious. But his troubles
just escalated and he got
himself suspended and then he
got arrested and had to stay in
the Rockbridge County jail for a
day with the “real criminals”
and now he’s gone.

Dash claimed that he was un-
fairly dealt with, that he was
persecuted for his _ political
views. ‘‘I try to be myself,’’ he
said, ‘‘which just happens to be
different.”’ He is a self-avowed
Marxist.

Dash never really avoided
trouble. He knew the frater-
nities didn’t want him in their
houses and at their parties. But
that didn’t concern him, not
Dash. He went to the fraternity
parties for awhile, even though
he knew they’d throw beer on
him.

“I think most of these guys
here (at W&L) don’t like

Italian Neorealism channell-
ed the energies released after
the war into a cinema of social
conscience and concern for the
ordinary man. It expressed a
faith in the documentary power
of everyday surfaces to reveal
what was meaningful and
“real’’ about experience.

But Fellini felt a lifelong at-
traction to the circus, and
believed that it too revealed
something real about human
experience. Turning increas-
ingly to dreams and the inner
reality of spiritual and psycho-
logical experience. Fellini pro-
duced the films for which he is
most famous: La Strada (1954),
La Dolce Vita (1959), the
ground-breaking New Wave
classic 8 1/2 (1962), Juliet of

themselves,’”’ he said. ‘‘Other-
wise they wouldn’t be threaten-
ed by someone who’s different.
I love myself, which is why I
don’t care what they think of
me.”’

‘What really bothers me are
the people who hate me without
knowing me, or even meeting
me. I don’t like people hating
me second-hand.”

Dash’s problems began when
he started writing on the walls.
He wrote a lot of things that peo-
ple around here don’t unders-
tand. His graffitti was subject
to whim, it was ‘‘a lark,”’ and
usually it was in chalk “so I
never thought it would bother
anyone.”

Then he started writing graf-
fitti in the bathrooms around
campus, but mostly in the new
library’s bathrooms.

“T like writing good graffitti.
At least mine was interesting—
and did not encompass
anonymous personal shots,”’ he
said, almost with pride. ‘‘My in-
tent was not to permanently
destroy or deface anything.”’

But the Student Control Com-
mittee didn’t see it that way.

the Spirits (1965), and Fellini
Satyricon (1969).

In these movies, although
such judgments are obviously a
matter of personal taste, Fellini
is occasionally guilty of cross-
ing the fine line between depict-
ing reality as grotesque and
depicting what is grotesque as
‘“‘the norm.” One occasionally
feels that the human has been
objectified, put on show, until it
becomes something unrecog-
nizable, freakish.

Fellini’s own Roma is the
story of a city a vast historical
and cultural excavation of
Roman life. The grotesque and
freakish here, as in the lovingly
analytical Amarcord (1974),
are humanized by their presen-

tation as we move from the °

Dash Has Left W&L And Gone Back

His punishment was to clean all
graffitti from every bathroom
wall on campus. He was in-
sulted, taunted, and jeered by
his fellow students as he carried
out his punishment.

So he stopped. It was “per-
sonally humiliating,’’ he said.
But Student Control, the student
disciplinary body, thought that
suspension from school would
be the appropriate punishment
for noncompliance.

But Dash thinks the suspen-
sion was an overly harsh penal-
ty. “I didn’t destroy $30,000
worth of boxwoods,’’ he said,
‘“‘of course, I’m not on the
basketball team either.”’

Then there were some pro-
blems at Spanky’s, the local
delicatessen/restaurant. He
broke a bottle on the rail outside
the establishment and put the
jagged end under a car’s tire.
The manager caught him so he
pulled it away.

He was officially suspended
from the university on April 24
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, acting on Student Control’s
recommendation.

He went out that et and _

whores’ quarter to an ec-
clesiastical fashion show at the
Vatican to the motorcycle sub-
culture whose members
threateningly circle the city’s
great piazzas at night in a final
stream of light and color. Per-
haps this is because Fellini’s is
an imagination that has been
repressed by Catholic taboos as
much as it has been enriched by
the extravagance of Catholic
ritual.

Fellini’s flair for combining
urban realism with a sense of
magic finds its consummate ex-
pression in a scene in which
modern technology confronts
the Roman past. A team of sub-
way builders, literal ex-
cavators, comes upon a walled-

off cavern of beautiful ancient
frescos which, as they are ex-
posed to the air, first appear
and simultaneously vanish for
all time right before our eyes.

We have very much enjoyed
bringing movies to the W&L
campus again this year, and we
thank all of you for your support
and interest. We are planning a
new schedule for next year and
would welcome suggestions.

drunk ‘‘drunk off my ass,”’ in his
words,

In the early hours of the mor-
ning he and his companion
decided to relieve themselves,
right on the yellow line running
down Nelson Street. The ever-
watchful Lexington Police
Department was on the prowl,
though, and gave pursuit.

His friend got away, but Dash
didn’t take being chased by the
cops seriously, so he stopped
and surrendered. They threw
him in jail on charges of
urinating in public and drunk in
public.

He was in jail until 7 o’clock
Friday evening, when a. friend
of Sally Mann’s paid the $135 to
bail him out. He got himself a
lawyer and had his day in court
Tuesday.

And now he’s gone, on his way
back to Chicago.

Dash was different from
everyone else at W&L, and he
liked it that way. He like to
“blow people out ”’ It’s ‘‘good
sport,’’ he said.

‘A lot of these guys (at W&L)
deserve a good shaking up.

values—all they think about is
security and money. This place
is just a rich boys’ school,’’ he
said.

He found the girls who fre-
quent W&L to be “mindless”
and only interested in ‘‘looking
for husbands.”’

‘Most of the professors are
good, but they’re trapped with
students looking only for a
grade,’’ he said. ‘‘These
students are spouting
hypocrisy. They are born
privileged and they are saying

A Look At Washington And

by Alan S. Kendrick ARR

“The faculty Executive Committee will con-
sider a motion passed by the Executive Commit-
tee that will extend the hours that women will be
allowed to visit in the Freshman dorms and frater-
nity houses. This, along with a new rule allowing
women on the upper floors of residence areas,
gives W&L students more freedom and respon-
sibility than ever.’ If this seems to you a
somewhat dated decision for the administration to
be making, you're right. They acted on it ten years
ago. But it serves to point out the sweeping
changes that have come about in campus life in
just the past decade.

The seventies have marked a very active period
of growth and change at this school, in the
physical campus, academic schedules, and policy
governing student affairs.

The $3.5 million renovation of McCormick Hall
and the remodeling of Tucker Hall, two projects
still being completed, are the final steps of a huge
expansion program contained almost completely
in the last decade. In '69-’70, Dean Lewis G. John
and others were discussing expanding the campus
to provide needed space for the influx of women,
expected due to the strong movement to coeduca-
tionalize the institution. The planners felt that if
expansion was not feasible, the coeducation move-
ment would have to be scrapped. Although plans
for bringing women to W&L gradually faded, the
expansion was carried out ina very big way.

At that time, a plan was considered to “‘move
the commerce school to McCormick Hall and relo-
cate the library into a new ravine location or the
west campus.’ It was reported that “the plans are
still in their infancy, but funds are being increased
and studies made to see if the plans can be trans-
formed into a new W&L University.’ Today, the
dreams, the architects’ models and the incessant
sound of construction blasting have resulted in
much larger, more convenient facilities.

The first phase of construction was a giant addi-
tion to Doremus Gymnasium that is now known as
Warner Center. Construction went rather slow at
times, and the tied-up facilities were a real in-
convenience to the students. But finally the work
was completed, in December 1971, and the com-
plex was inaugurated with a rousing defeat of UVa
on the new basketball court.

The same year, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Lewis
donated $9 million to construct a new law school

 

 

that would relieve the crowded conditions in
Tucker Hall, which then served as the law school.
The Lewis Hall complex was built across Woods
Creek and completed in the Fall of 1977. The same
company that built the law school was contracted
to build the $8 million undergraduate library in the
‘Ravine location,’ and the Woods Creek apart-
ments, completed about the same time as the law
school.

Also in the first part of this ten-year period, the
university center was built across Washington
Street from the rest of the campus, and the newer
freshman dormitories were added (as originally
outlined in the coeducation plans).

The undergraduate library was then started, as
the last big building project and was completed in
around four years and slightly ahead of schedule. ~
The construction company is now working to
finish preparing McCormick’s interior, as part of
the last phase of the work.

While the campus was undergoing change, the
ideas of the student body were also redeveloping.
The nation was in the middle of its involvement in
the Vietnam war, and all the students were con-
cerned with the issue of the draft. The possibility
of selection under the Nixon administration’s lot-
tery system was the dominant topic of conversa-
tion everywhere. When the lottery was completed
in mid-December of ‘69, all the students “heaved a
sigh of relief Those who got ‘fat numbers’ (far
away from the cutoff point) started trying to
figure out how to break their ROTC contracts.”

Some who were chosen were visibly upset, while
others merely accepted their fate. These last were
berrated by some of their colleagues for their
‘‘will-less passivity.”’

Wrote one concerned student, ‘‘As long as the
U.S. fights in that small country, we are involved
and responsible for whether or not we are pulling
triggers and bombsight mechanisms or putting in
another nickel and punching pinball flippers.”’

Another student, whose number was chosen,
tried to take matters as lightly as possible, He
wrote his own version of the John Wayne movie
heriocs, ‘Military code for the faint of heart,’’ And
printed it in the Ring-tum Phi.

Others were noticed for their participation in na-
tional conventions of the John Birch Society.

But all of the anti-war sentiment eventually

. came toa head nation-wide in the infamous period

of the *‘seven days in May,”’ when several students
were killed by national guardsmen at Kent State

University. The demonstrations were happening
' on college campuses all over the country.

Washington and Lee also shared in the experience.
Three weeks before the end of the semester, in
early May, many students began to boycott

classes and held a number of rallies, as well as at-
tending rallies at other schools. At this time many
colleges caught up in the protest of the war came
under pressure from students to discontinue
classes and close for the rest of the year. A
number of institutions did; while the administra-
tions of others simply told students to pipe down
and go back to class. The most radical segment of
the W&L student body asked for, and received per-
mission earlier in the semester, to take in-
completes in their courses and leave to participate
in the protest. A movement was then undertaken
to make W&L the southern regional strike head-
quarters for all the colleges in the protest.
Brandeis, in Massachusetts, was the national
headquarters. Meanwhile, W&L itself was still in
session, and exams were fast approaching. A
movement was started to close the school and
adopt a curriculum of protest, with seminars to
discuss the sociological implications of the war. A
resolution was fielded to the student body for a
referendum, to achieve this idea. Students were

asked to vote according to whether they thought
the school should be a part of the national move-
ment. The student body, which has traditionally
been apathetic, turned out in large numbers: of a
total of 1,367 students, 1,319 voted in the referen-
dum, and only 254 voted against the resolution.

The faculty met that night and decided not to
allow the resolution to be carried out. But, at the
same time, they had an interest in allowing the
school to express its opinion. President Huntley
called an open-air meeting in front of the Lee
Chapel to announce the faculty's resolution: To
allow students to take incompletes on part or all of
any courses, with a completion deadline of
September 30, so that those who desired to pursue
the protest could do so. Classes were still held, and
most of the students who took incompletes came
back in a short time to complete their work. Presi-
dent Huntley summed up the feeling of the student
body as *‘A deep committment, lightly held.”’ In
the aftermath of the college strike movement,
W&L gained a reputation of having acted rational-
ly in a time of great stress. This stance was
reflected in a statement printed when the resolu-
tion was being considered:

“Closing Washington and Lee for a month is not
like closing an elementary school three days for
snow. The faculty resolution allows those who feel

 
The Ring-tum Phi, May 15, 1980, Page 7

Lee During The Volatile 70's

more immediate concerns to postpone their school
work. The proposed student body action is a cop-
out. We cannot declare Washington and Lee edu-
cation irrelevant and simultaneously expect the
rest of the world to continue to take it seriously.”’

Aside from the war, the student body was
undergoing turmoil in a number of other ways.
Between ’69 and ’71, three fraternities folded and
another managed to remain solvent only by aban-
doning its stately house and moving to smaller
quarters. Kappa Sigma, ATO, and Pi Epsilon Phi
all closed, and Delta Upsilon followed a few years
later. The student body was becoming apathetic to
one thing that it did take seriously: Fraternity life.
The number of pledges in these years dropped
drastically. Many students felt that they just did
not need fraternities, and the Greek system was
having a hard time convincing many freshmen
otherwise. Obviously, this trend, like all others,
reversed itself.

Sweeping changes were made in student affairs
policy. In addition to more lenient parietal rules
and visiting hours on upper floors, which were
finally opened totally in ’74, after it was observed
that UVa had done so, (the parietals at other peer
colleges were frequently cited in arguments to
free restrictions), dress codes were gradually
loosened. Freshmen were allowed to have cars for
the first time in 1969, and decisions were made
that year for even greater changes in the next
year.

In 1971, the old semester system was changed to
the current trimester system to allow students to
finish their exams before Christmas break, and
allow for greater curriculum flexibility. Most of
the required freshman courses were cut.

In the same year, a deferred rush policy was in-
stituted, and freshmen could not pledge until the
7th week of the fall term. And to the question,
“‘How can a freshman be oriented to the campus if
you take him away from the campus?”’ Freshman
orientation was held on campus for the few years
that deferred rush was in effect.

The University council, which was established
in response to demands that students have a big-
ger part in campus policy, was also instituted mid-
way through the ’70-’71 year, along with the honors
system.

The faculty worked to manage locally the drug
problem that was sweeping the country. Said Dr.
Imeson, on a committee to control the problem
and help students who were addicted or otherwise
in trouble, ‘‘The policy of the school is to counsel
students who have been affected and help them to
recover, and educate those who have not been af-
fected through a distribution of literature on the
subject.”

Partly as a result of the new yearly schedule,
but primarily because of increasing student
disinterest, Fancy Dress was cancelled in ’71. It
had come off with great difficulty the year before,
and the Executive Committee decided early in the
school year to can the project for “‘lack of funds.”’
The fact that the regular time for Fancy Dress, in

 

 

 

 

longer existed made it hard for the students to get
excited about it. The big ball was to remain in lim-
bo for the next three years until it was revived in
"74.

The issue of going coed had some interesting
turns in the early seventies. The law school admit-
ted women for the first time in the 1972-1973, but
there was not as great a pressure for the under-
grad segment to follow suit. In one instance there
had been a movement to have coed short term and
admit at least a hundred women to classes. But
the only successful program has been to have a
few exchange students each year.

One exchange student attempted to help stu-
dents experience the coeducational experience in
her own way. A Miss Red, a freshman at
Randolph-Macon, had been admitted to W&L for
her sophomore year. She decided she wanted to be
as active as possible, so in the spring before her
year at this school, she ran for sophomore class
president. After getting a petition signed, she
threw the Executive Committee into an uproar as
to whether a non-regular student should be allow-
ed to run for office, or be included on the ballot.
After much heated debate, they finally agreed
that she must be included, and Miss Red ran for
the votes just like the rest of the guys. She was not
elected.

One other notable student movement came in
1975 when the E.C. recommended and sought to
pass a resolution to abolish the academic proba-
tion standards, on the grounds that the pressure
was not fair to students.

People making the headlines in the first part of
the decade: Prof. Milton Colvin, who ran for the
democratic nomination for senator in Virginia.
After considering running early in the period, he
dropped out because he did not think 'e had
enough funds to run a successful camp?” 1. When
Senator Harry Byrd decided torun* 1 Indepen-
dant, Colvin renewed his camr’ ,.. and made a
strong effort to gain the nor ..ation. He was not
successful in his bid however, and was defeated by
a candidate from Northern Virginia.

“I’ve known some pretty smart peanut farmers and by God this isn’t one of them,”
Senator Barry Goldwater said at Friday evening’s Second Session. The Arizona
Republican was the keynote speaker at the Convention, appearing with Congressman
Henson Moore.

There were few surprises in Goldwater’s speech. The Senator asked his student au-
dience to work hard and make the United States so strong ‘that another country will
never dare to take American hostage again.”’

In another blast at the Democratic Party, Goldwater said: ‘‘Think of all the junk, all
the lies that we’ ve had to listen to from these liberals and radicals.”’ The Senator ended
his comments with a plea to W&L’s student body: ‘‘If you want to live a good life, one
upon which you can look back upon with pride, do your duty.”’

Reagan Wins On First Ballot; Second Time In M.C. History

Front runner Ronald Reagan
received an overwhelming ma-
jority of delegate votes at
Washington and Lee’s Mock
Republican Convention _ last
weekend and walked away as
this year's Republican
presidential contender,

The former California gover-
nor received 1,587 votes. Am-
bassador George Bush finished
a distant second with 386 and
John Connally received two
delegate votes. There were five
others.

The state of New York put
Reagan over the 998 mark need-
ed to capture the nomination.
They gave all 123 votes to him.

Minutes be‘ore all votes were
thrown to Reagan, a powerful
New York party official was
called, (he was pulled off the
golf course), who authorized all
43 of New York’s uncommitted
delegates to put Reagan over
the top.

Within five minutes, an of-
ficial from Bush’s mid-Atlantic
headquarters in Baltimore
knew and called Lexington to
find out what happened.

He said he was impressed
with the authenticity of the Con-
vention, but naturally unhappy.

Earlier in the state roll call
vote, Reagan scored heavily,
capturing most of the delegates
from California, Illinois, In-
diana and Florida. Bush did
well in Michigan, Massachu-
setts and Connecticut.

After adjourning one hour for
lunch, conventioneers and spec-
tators returned to hear Reagan
address the convention by
phone.

Reagan began by_ praising
Barry Goldwater and jokingly
asked if he had to continue cam-
paigning.

He then launched into a pro-
Republican speech for the quiet
crowd.

‘The situation in the world to-
day is very precarious,”’ said
Reagan. ‘‘I believe all of this
was due to misguided govern-
ment policies.”’

‘We have it in our power to
begin the world all over again,”
he said. ‘We have a rendezvous
with destiny. Mankind is
waiting for this (American)
dream to come true.”

Reagan was the second man
in Mock Convention history to
be nominated on the first ballot.
The last one was William Jenn-

ings Bryan in 1908.

Tennessee's favorite son,
Howard Baker, was chosen as
Ronald Reagan's vice-
presidential candidate by the
WA&l 1980 Mock Convention. The
senator received 1,005 delegate
votes.

As a guide to keep students
from falling into the plagiarism
trap, the pamphlet advises that
“facts or opinions acquired

made require no_ specific

tion gained after the assign-
ment was made must be

The new book was given to
students in some English 101
classes for their comments and
suggestions.

At Monday night’s EC
meeting, the committee voted
to strip all editors and business
managers of campus publica-
tions of their salaries. Any
surplus profit the publication
might make would revert to the

Myers brought the proposal to
the IFC, which allows for the
President, Vice-President, and
Secretary of the IFC, the EC’s
Big Three officials, as well as
the President of the Student Bar
Association to interview and
select Contact applicants.

(In the past, the IFC and EC
president and’ vice-president
have selected the Contact
chairmen, but the chairmen
selected their own committee
members. )

(Channing Hall, one of the
Contact chairmen this year,
told the Ring-tum Phi this week
that he feels the former

Jay Blumberg, senior EC
representative, led the fight
against the salaries, saying that
he thought salaries for editors
and business managers were
unfair to leaders of other cam-
pus organizations.

(The Publications Board con-
stitution now provides for the
editor and business manager of
the Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx
to receive 22.5 percent of the
surplus made by the publication
at the end of the year. Last
year’s editor and _ business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi
each received $130. )

The EC’s motion to abolish
salaries, which passed 7-4,
would not affect this year’s
editors and business managers,
but is supposed to take effect
next year.

“Salaries are inconsistent
with everything else on this
campus,”’ said senior law
school representative John
Fraser.

chairmen of Contact should
have some Say in the selection
process of next year’s commit-
tee. )

The change in procedure was
instituted because of com-
plaints in the manner Contact
has been selecting committee
members.

(At least one student has com-
plained to this year’s EC that he
applied to be a committee
member, but was never con-
tacted. )

Also last week, the IFC voted
to spend $90 to send three Lex-
ington youths to camp this sum-
mer.

Willis, Keesler, EC President
Steve Abraham, and EC Vice-
President Les Cotter voted
against the motion to take away
salaries.

A representative from the
Publications Board was not pre-

- sent at the meeting.

The Executive Committee
also made some_ cosmetic
changes to the Voting Regula-
tions Board’s elections rules in

_ response to the problems en-

countered this year when fresh-
man John Lowe received cam-
paign contributions.

The rule that write-in can-

didates are subject to the EC’s-

spending and poster limits was
reinstated. Also, write-in votes
will no longer be allowed in run-
off elections.

In addition, the committee
added a clause stating that: ‘
“Any action or event influenc-
ing voters in an unfair manner,
as well as any question of possi-
ble violation of the stated rules,
shall be brought to the attention

hearing of the matter, will
decide whether or not the can-
didate is permanently dis-
qualified from the pending elec-
tion. The decision of the VRB
may be appealed to the Ex-
ecutive Committee.”

EC President Abraham also
announced that W&L will dou-
ble its night security force to
two persons on duty in response
to the increase of crimes
against students.

He also thanked the Mock
Convention committee for the
job it did on last weekend’s
Mock Republican Convention
and called it “the most organiz-
ed and well-run event on this
campus in four years.”

He was that special kind of

support of the highest ideals of
this institution were unstinting.
He will be sorely missed.’

Munger Discusses Textbook Problems

mine its own price for resale to
the student, possibly adding to
it the cost of shipping. Net pric-
ing appears to be the marketing
trend of the future, according to
Mrs. Munger.

The second major aspect to
the textbook problem is the
faculty. Although Mrs. Munger
says that relations between the
faculty and the store have
always been good, she notes
that some faculty members

have created difficulties for her
in determining what kind and
quantity of books they will need
for next year.

Professors are required to
complete forms listing these re-
quirements but are often late in
returning them to the manager.
As a result, Mrs. Munger says
she often has had to resort to us-
ing silly gimmicks, such as the
pinning of carnations on jacket
lapels, in order to encourage
them to return their forms.

In determining the texts to be

used, the various departments
remain conscious of costs to the
student, even though they may
miscalculate by ignoring the
further costs entailed by net
pricing. Mrs. Munger says the
faculty is constantly kept in-
formed of impending price in-
creases.

But even with price rises
given all due consideration,
history speaks for itself. The
Mathematics Department has
changed its textbook for use in
Calculus 101 each year for the
past three years.

The student must bear the im-
pact of both of these aspects of
the problem. Mrs. Munger says
that although the bookstore has
a monopoly on business, its pur-
pose is first and foremost to
serve the students.

She is fully conscious of the
fact that many students must
mitigate heavy expenditures by
buying used books for a dis-
count of one quarter of their
original cost, although she will
not accept for “‘buyback”’ books

which are heavily highlighted,
believing that students should
think for themselves and not let
others do their thinking for
them.

Two major problems exist
with the “buyback”’ policy: the
first is that the store knows only
one week before buying back
which texts the faculty will be
utilizing during the coming fall
semester and which texts will
be obsolete.

The second major problem is
that students engage in text-
book commerce among them-
selves, distorting projections of
the number of textbooks needed
and eliminating the potential
“‘buyback”’ market.

Mrs. Munger said that
although price increases hurt
the students, the student body
is, in general, affluent enough to
absorb the costs. But for how
long? Because of inflation and
the increased cost of living,
solutions must be found.

One solution may be for stu-
dents to continue buying and

selling among themselves. The
bookstore currently buys text-
books from students for half the
original price and resells them
for 75 percent of the original
price. If a student were to sell
his textbooks to another student
for, say, two-thirds the original
price without using the book-
store as middleman, then both
students would profit from the
venture.

Another solution may be to
encourage the marketing of
textbooks at other bookstores in
Lexington, thus effectively
breaking the monopoly of the
campus store.

Until a practical solution is
found, however, students will
have to live with the harsh
realities of the present situa-
tion. Take the rather insidious
example of the textbook cur-
rently used in History 107, The
National Experience, which has
increased in price three times
this year alone from $9.95 to
$10.95 to the current price of
$11.95.
 

Tennis To Compete In
Div. [1] Championship

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team, which last week cap-
tured the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title for the fourth
consecutive year, will compete
in the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships at Claremont-Mudd
College in Claremont, Califor-
nia. The four-day event began
Wednesday, May 14.

Six Generals will join head
coach Gary Franke at the
Championships: Seniors
Stewart Jackson (Lake Forest,
Ill.), David Constine (Rich-
mond, Va.), and Pat Norris
(Dallas, Tx.); juniors Pete
Lovell (New Bedford, N.H.) and
Doug Gaker (Middletown,
Ohio), and freshman Jackson
Sharman (Tuscaloosa, Ala.).

Co-captain Jackson has had
impressive showings the last
three years in the NCAA tourna-
ment. As a freshman, Jackson
teamed with former W&L great
Ben Johns (class of 1978) to win
the Division III National
Doubles Championship. Later
that same year, Jackson and
Johns participated in the 1977
NCAA Division I National
Championships at the Universi-

The following year, 1978,
Jackson and Johns almost did it
again, finishing second in the
NCAA doubles competition and
again traveled to the Division I

tourney, gaining All-American
honors for his third year in a
row.

Says head tennis coach Gary
Franke, ‘“‘We’re heading west
playing our best tennis of the
season. The tough competition
we played early in the season
(W&L met 10 Division I op-
ponents this spring) may not
have helped us post a great dual
match record, but it enabled us
to win the ODAC title and we
hope it will help us in the NCAA
Championships.” ,

The Generals completed their
regular schedule with a 7-12
dual match record, nine losses
coming at the hands of NCAA
Division I members. The team
claimed the ODAC title on Tues-
day, April 29, when four singles
and two doubles entries won in-
dividual honors. W&L posted 78
points to outdistance runner-up
Hampden-Sydney, which had 67
1/2 points.

At the NCAA event, W&L will
have entries an all four singles
flights and both doubles divi-
sions. Jackson, Lovell, Con-
stine, and Sharman will man
singles positions; Jackson and
Lovell will comprise one
doubles unit, Gaker and Norris
the second.

Last season W&L finished ina
fourth-place tie with Swarth-
more College at the NCAA
Championships; in 1978 the
Generals took runner-up honors
to Kalamazoo; and in 1977 the
team tied with Claremont-Mudd
College for second place as
Swarthmore claimed the title.

Lacrosse Drops To Fifth;
Lose To UNC, 7-5

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
Generals Lacrosse team drop-
ped to fifth in the recent USILA
polls as a result of a 7-5 defeat at
the hands of the University of
North Carolina last Saturday at
Wilson Field.

The game, which was the last
home game for the Generals
and ended the season for the
Tarheels, was attended by over
6,000 Mock Convention and
Alumni weekend fans and was
marked by slow deliberate

play.

‘People think it was a slowed.

paced game, but is was just a
different kind of game,”’ com-
mented Generals head coach
Jack Emmer. ‘You can credit
the low score to the play of the
goalies.”’

W&L got off to a good start,
taking a 2-0 lead on goals by
Roman Kupecky (the only score

quarter) and Mike Pressler on
an extra-man situation. But the
Tarheels came back to tie the
score at 3 apeice by the end of
the half.

The Third quarter saw the
Generals go ahead twice, but
UNC came back early in the
fourth period to tie the score at
5-5,

The result of the fourth
quarter belonged to the
Tarheels as they scored at the
5:06 mark to put them ahead
and then again with only 1:17
remaining in the game to give
them a two goal lead. The
Generals were able to find the
shots but UNC’s goalie denied
them any further goals and the
game ended with North
Carolina claiming a 7-5 victory.

The loss put the Generals’
season record at 10-2 and moved
them down to fifth place in the
National rankings behind No. 1

 

UVA, Johns Hopkins, Syracuse
and Navy. W&L has one re-
maining regular season game
at Hofstra this Saturday. North
Carolina’s record is now 7-3 and
they are ninth in the standings.

As a result of the defeat, the
Generals lose the home field ad-
vantage in the first round of the
playoffs, but coach Emmer
feels that-a win over Hofstra,
should move W&L back up into
fourth position and regain the
home-field for the first round.

“If we beat Hofstra, which is
no easy feat, we believe we
should be seated No. 4,” he
commented.

The top four ranked teams
are given the home field advan-
tage in the playoffs, which start
on May 21 and the finals will be
played at Cornell University on
May 31.

Soccer Team Beats Alumni

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity soccer team maintained its
hold on the cherished ‘‘Golden
Boot” last Sunday with a 2-1
double-overtime win against
the W&L Alumni team in the
third annual meeting of the
squads. The varsity how holds a
2-0-1 series lead.

The alumni took a 1-0 first-
half lead before the varsity
knotted the score during the
second half to send the contest
into overtime. After a scoreless
first overtime period, Brad
Poorman netted the winning
goal in the second extra period.

W&L head soccer coach Rolf
Piranian reported that 19 alum-
ni participated, the most since
the series began two years ago.
Greet Barriault, W&L class of
1978 from Houston, Texas,
received the award as the alum-
nus having travelled the far-
thest to the game and as the
outstanding alumni player.

Joining him on the alumni
Squad were: 1970 graduates
Buddy Bahakel, Doug Pinotti,
Doug Dorsey, John Stagamier,
Dana Samuelson, and Doug

Seitz; 1970 graduate Ken
Newman; 1973 grad Mike
Schaeffer; 1974 alumni John

Lane and Buck Leslie; and 1978
class members Ace Dods, Todd

Tyson, Bill Stone, Murray
Holland, Mark Derbyshire,
Roger Yale, and Sandy Bishop.
Dods and Tyson served as co-
captains.

Funds Needed For Nature Hike

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent is heading an effort to raise
$40,000 for a matching grant to
be used for repairs and addi-
tions to the Maury River Nature
trail.

The contribution deadline is
June, 30. All those interested
should contact Marshall Clark.

In December, 1979, the
Virginia Environmental En-
dowment pledged the grant to
the VMI Foundation, Inc. after
the institute obtained the
former Buena Vista-Lexington
right-of-way of the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railroad Co.

Work has already been done
on the nature trail. Bush and
weed removal is nearly com-
plete except for a small section
just east of the South River
bridge, The roadbed has been
repaired and is in acceptable
condition. _

Future plans call for the con-

stuction of a foot bridge over the
Maury River. The probable
location will be the pilings from
the old wooden trestle that was
destroyed by Hurricane
Camille.

Two other foot bridges, one
over Mill Creek and the other
over South River are also plann-
ed.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Mock Convention

By almost anyone’s measurement, last weekend’s
Mock Convention was a huge success. There can be
no doubt that it was one of the best organized and
most efficiently run events held at this school for
quite some time.

It was a massive undertaking involving a very
large group of students. Yet, the organizers—despite
the difficulties of their jobs and differences in
personalities—worked very well together. In one
observer's words, they became almost a fraternal
organization, in the better sense of the phrase. There
was no infighting or backstabbing, but there was a lot
of teamwork—as there had to be in order for such a
large affair to be successful.

Of course everyone knows who the Mock Conven-
tion chairmen were: Craig Cornett, Sidney Simmons,
and Richard Schoenfeld. But there were some other,
unsung behind-the-scenes people who were also
responsible for the smoothness of the event. Goetz
Eaton was in charge of transforming the gymnasium
into a convention hall and for troubleshooting those
inevitable little problems that always seem to crop
up. If you saw the Mock Convention Journal then you
already know what a good job Sam Flax did (even if
he is a law student). Guy Steuart kept the media fat
and happy and made our job much easier..

There have been some complaints that the conven-
tion was an exercise in futility because ererybody
knew that Reagan was going to win. But it is not the
fault of the conventioneers that the present national
delegate selection process has almost locked up the
nomination for the former California governor by
mid-May.

What is significant is that within five minutes of the
New York delegation’s vote—reportedly based on a
high-ranking party official’s instructions—one of
Bush’s men was on the phone to find out what went
wrong. Now that is clout. It is a definite sign that the
W&L Mock Convention is highly respected for its ac-
curacy to predict the actual outcome of a convention
Which is still two months away.

Something else to note are the remarks of the
speakers. Both Senators Warner and Goldwater had a
marked tone of pessimism in their speeches. Their
general message was that America is in trouble—
serious trouble.

It is long past time that we wake up in this country
to the realization that we are not the great, domineer-
ing nation we once were. The United States is being
humiliated in Iran, outmaneuvered in the Middle
Kast, and bounced around by our so-called allies.
Even if our military manpower is adequate, the
equipment with which we ask our soldiers to fight is
not.

The politics of applying a recession to correct an
overheated economy is a painful remedy of doubtful
wisdom. Graduating seniors already know what the
climbing unemployment rate has done to the job
market. These are grim times and it looks as if things
will get worse.

Senators Warner and Goldwater were both calling
to our generation to clear up the mess that the past
generation has made of the world. We hope that the
next groups of college graduates will heed the call—
before it is too late.

Advice For The Future

Dear Editor:

I am writing to you students
for the purpose of saving you
money.

Nowadays there is a great
speculative boom in housing.
Millions of homebuyers are
stretching their budgets to buy
the biggest houses they can. In
fact, they use so much leverage
that their outstanding mortgage
balances remain approximate-
ly unchanged for many years.

Little do they know, there are
two directions that the price of

anything can go: there is up,
and there is down. Do you think
housing prices will ever go
down?

History shows that every
great speculative boom has
ended with a crash. Soon there
will be an historic crash in the
housing market. Millions of
home prices will fall far below
their mortgage balances, plung-
ing their once-proud owners
deep into debt.

Millions of greedy
homeowners are planning to

cash in on your ignorance,
(even after they could have
taught you better in school). So
warn all your friends: Don’t
buy a house until after the
prices crash, and even after a
crash, there are always two
directions that the price of
anything can go: there is up,
and there is down.

Contrary to popular belief,
prosperity is caused by in-

vestments for income, and
never by investments for
capital gain.

Persiflage On Irresponsibility

Irresponsibility doesn't come
easily. It takes many years of
dedicated practice and deter-
mination.

‘ro a lot of people, irrespon-
sibility means something along
the lines of watching T.V. all
night before the hardest exam.
But that's baby — stuff
—something a 14-year-old kid
can do.

True irresponsibility must be
spontaneous and unquestioned.
You must accept the challenge
presented by circumstances
and totally blow off whatever
‘serious’ matters you might
have had planned.

Now some might argue that
irresponsibility is a great evil
and should be corrected, but
that’s a bogus viewpoint
developed and perpetuated by
healous little worms who never
had the guts to test themselves.
One of the greatest virtues of
being irresponsible is that you
can get to discover your
capabilities.

Can you go on a week-long
roadtrip and still pull off an ac-
ceptable grade? Can you give in
to your friends’ taunts, take a
few b-hits and still perform in
your seminar class? In short,
can you have your cake and eat
it too? I have been testing these
hypotheses for years and can
now report that not only is it
possible to successfully blow it
off, it’s fun and easy too.

Of course, if you do achieve
this goal, you will inevitably
receive the condemnation of
certain people in our small com-
munity. They simply cannot
tolerate the fact that someone
might be having fun and yet be
successful at the same time.
They wish to see everyone
brought down to their own
stodgy, close-minded existence.
But let’s face it, it’s just not fun
to sweat in that hot, stuffy
library ona nice spring night.

Kinniburgh Column Blasted

Dear Sirs:

As regular readers of your
music column, we have always
hesitated to write in disagree-
ment with any of the reviews
found therein. Everyone is en-
titled to his or her own opinion
about an artist, record, or
musical style, and Mark Kinni-
burgh’s views are certainly as
valid as those of anyone else.

Opinions are one_ thing,
though, and facts are quite
another. Over the past several
months your reviewer has been
casually throwing out errors,
misstatements, and_ ill-
informed comparisons that
should make even a casual
music fan cringe:

1) Referring to the author and
performer of the new single
“Cars’”’ as Gary Norman is
simply inexcusable. Gary
Numan has been featured on
Saturday Night Live, and in all
the major music publications
(and his name does, after all,
appear on his album covers! ).
The error occurred a half dozen
times over the course of two

separate columns, so this was _

no typo. How can a reader place
any credibility in a review of
Numan’s music, when the

2) Perhaps hoping that his
readers wouldn’t know the dif-
ference, Mr. Kinniburgh recent-
ly wrote that the new Elvis
Costello album had ‘‘hit number
one on the album charts’’. In
fact, the record hasn’t even
come close to doing so. Bill-
board (the most respected
music industry publication)
currently places the album in

anything at all to do with the so-
called new wave, either music-
ally, socially, or politically.

I realize that all of this may
seem trivial in the overall
scheme of things, but these are
just a few examples of your
reviewer’s irresponsibility to
his audience. Mr. Kinniburgh is
welcome to his opinions, but
he’d be well advised to get his
facts straight first.

c
Parker Potter

Last weekend was my second Mock Convention. My first, the 1976
affair, left a bad taste in my mouth, but I’ve always chalked that up
to a freshman’s naive and incomplete understanding of the college
world around him.

This time I know better.

My principal concern, four years ago and today, is Friday night’s
platform session. There is no reason in the world why that session
needed to be the 90 proof farce that it was.

One would think that in a year when even the stray dogs on the
collonade knew that Saturday would be a one ballot cakewalk for
Reagan some great effort would be made to make Friday night’s
activities a little less festive and a little more meaningful.

A well-planned platform session could have been an excellent
forum for intelligent discussion of several key issues of the day. As
it was, Friday night was an overloud cocktail party with an occa-
sional voice vote thrown in.

For that, I hold the organizers of the convention directly
responsible.

First, I feel that the central committee or whatever allowed too
few people to become centrally involved in the planning etc. of the
convention. There were just far too few people on the convention
floor with much of a stake in what was going on. For them, drinking
was as good a thing to doas any.

As well, I don’t think the platform session was adequately plann-
ed or encouraged. One gets the feeling that the big wigs felt that the
platform session was just an inconvenience, something that needed
to be done, and treated it just that way. And that attitude certainly
filtered down to the convention floor.

Part of the problem with Friday night was the fact that it was
next to impossible to hear anything. Why is that? Well, some have
suggested that the widespread drinking and subsequent socializing
on the floor is responsible.

And whose fault is that? Why, the very people who could not be
heard above the din (co-chairmen, people like that...) are the peo-
ple who sent out a flier stating that drinking on the floor was
against the rules and suggesting discreet ways to smuggle in li-
quor. Talk about stacking the deck against yourself.

The combination of limited involvement and endorsed drinking
was a one-two punch that KOed Friday’s second session.

And since I’ve seen two separate platform debates go down the
same tube, perhaps it’s time to ask a few questions. What is this
convention and what is it trying to do?

It seems that it is very proud of its accuracy and is very proud of
its high level of student involvement.

The accuracy part could be handled quite neatly (and quite ex-

 

\ pensively) by a dozen people in a small room. But part of the uni-

; >)
Thoughts On The Mock Convention

queness of the convention is its high rate of student involvement. It
is imperative that our convention be the “boomingest,”’ at least to
Time magazine. ;

But what is the nature of this student involvement? For 95 per-
cent of the Mock Conventioneers it is staying up all night building a
float, watching a parade, drinking and socializing Friday night and
voting Saturday in a roll call or two in a manner already specified
to state chairmen by somebody regionally coordinating them.

I think that the planners of the 1984 Convention must ask
themselves one question: At what price spectacle? The very Marc
Hannas | alluded to above who-could have been the Mock Conven-
tion were the Mock Convention.

The vast majority of the delegates were simply neck-tied window
dressings in a giant puppet show. At one point Craig Cornett had the
assembled masses ready to jump through a hoop called rule 16-B.
In fact, he called for a vote before he had explained just what 16-B
was.

One chairman from a large northern industrial State, less than
one week before the convention, indictated that he would give all
his delegates to one candidate because he’d seen in a News Brief
that that state’s governor had endorsed the candidate. Not to worry
— there’s a regional coordinator.

As it is, the Mock Convention is a shameful fraud. I felt so sorry
for the fellow nominated for vice-president by Texas, the man from
the foundation who had donated so much to the convention. The
poor sap bought himself a party.

The Mock Convention cannot continue to butter its bread on both
sides. It can’t keep endorsing drinking on the floor while pretending
to do things from one podium.

Most of all, it can’t keep up the pretense of student involvement
when so few have so much stake in things.

The two options are clear.

The convention can maintain its presently spectacular size and
make a monumental effort to involve people in the proceedings by

enforced sobriety and by putting greater time and effort into the
platform session.

Or, the convention can keep real involvement in the smoke-filled
room and reduce the size of the thing.

In any event, a convention whose leaders rigidly enforce a
necktie dress code while teaching ways around its own drinking
regulations can’t fool too many people too much longer. A well-
dressed drunk is still a drunk.

And a convention hall full of people who know what’s going on,
who care what’s going on and who are part of what’s going on sure
beats last weekend’s drunken charade.

IFC VotesDown

New
Fraternity

by Ed Edge

The Interfraternity Council
voted 9-4 not to accept the newly
proposed fraternity, ACACIA,
Tuesday night in its second vote
on the issue.

Two weeks ago the IFC voted
to accept the new fraternity, but
the vote did not comply with the
council’s constitution, which re-
quires a three-quarters majori-
ty vote in favor of acceptance
before a new fraternity can be
admitted into the IFC.

The first vote was 9-4-3 in
favor of allowing the new fra-
ternity in, but the IFC was
under the false assumption that
only a simple majority was
needed to accept the new group.

ACACIA was to be a service
fraternity, but its local
organizer, Stan Doobin, wanted
it made clear that the fraternity
was also to be socially-oriented.

“We want to get involved in
the community as much as pos-
sible and act as a bridge be-
tween the townspeople and the
fraternities; we are not strictly
a service fraternity, though,”
said Doobin.

In other business, IFC Presi-
dent Monte Brisoce informed
the council of the Student Af-
fairs Committee’s decision to
retain the pledge required of

fraternity presidents at the end
of a period of social probation.

The pledge is required of the
president of the fraternity com-
ing off of probation and states
that the fraternity has complied
with the terms of probation.

The pledge has been revised,
however, to begin with the
words, ‘‘To the best of my
knowledge...’ This revision was
the subject of concern for some
representatives at the meeting
and was initiated by the Presi-
dent of the Executive Commit-
tee, Steve Abraham.

‘‘All the pledge rule is doing is
causing the students to be
sneaky; girls are always going
to be around during probation
and the pledge is going to cause
the presidents to lie,” Mac Ken-
nedy, a Beta Theta Pi member,

 

said.

Several other fraternity
representatives echoed Ken-
nedy’s point.

A possible alternative that
was looked into was to let the
sophomores, who live in the
fraternity house, have their
girlfriends come visit them, but
have no parties.

SAC members, according to
Briscoe, were apprehensive
about this because it would be
too difficult to distinguish be-
tween a party anda visit.

“SAC decided to keep the
pledge in because there was no
viable enough alternative of-
fered, and I think the matter
should be taken up next year
when more work can be done on
it,”’ Briscoe said.

Renovation To Begin

In

by Ed Gonsalves

Beginning in the fall of 1981
Washington and Lee University
will start renovating Graham-
Lees dormitory. The move will
satisfy Virginia fire codes and
improve the safety, health and
overall conditions.

According to Frank Parsons,
assistant to the President, the
University has taken so long in
improving the conditions of
Graham-Lees because the
renovation will be = ‘‘an
unglamourous and disruptive
chore.”

But Parsons also admitted
that the “University has a
responsibility” to keep the dor-
mitories updated with respect
to safety, health and comfort.

The renovation is currently in
the schematic stage and the
Board of Trustees will consider

all the proposals this weekend.
Ul,

The Board must consider the
method of renovation as well as
the displacement of students
that the renovation will cause,
said Parsons.

Alternative methods of
renovation include refurbishing
one section of Graham-Lees at a
time.

“This is the easiest way to
handle the displacement of
students,’’ said Parsons, but

September

would lenghen the entire
renovation process, which the
University wants to be cun-
pleted by the fall of 1982.

One must also consider the
reduced capacity that renova-
tion requires. Fire escapes
would take up a lot of room
space, Says Parsons.

To get around this problem, a
proposed method is to fill in the
current ‘‘donut’’ (quad) of
Graham-Lees.

Another scheme is to build a
new dormitory behind the ten-
nis courts near Wilson Field.
Costs for the renovation have
been estimated to run as high as
$3 million.

This method would solve the
problem of where to put the
students while the im-
provements are made _ to
Graham-Lees.

Freshmen can also use Woods
Creek Apartments. But this
would only take care of about
2/3 of the freshmen class.

Of course, this would force
upperclassmen to live in town.
However, Parsons said this
wouldn’t be a problem.

In addition he stated that
more W&L students used to live
in town than do now.

 

Dr. Emmons Retlects On Changes

by Will Jackson

unanimous.”

 

Most present-day Washington and Lee students
were still in diapers if not, as yet, unborn, when
Lyman Randlett Emmons arrived, fresh from
receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia,
to begin teaching biology here.

Twenty years have brought a lot of changes,
positive and negative, to the world at large and to
W&L in particular. Professor Emmons has seen
these changes as they evolved, and gave a few of
his opinions on them during a recent interview.

Emmons began his academic career in New
England, where he was born and raised. After
high school, he entered Trinity College in Hart-
ford, Conn., a college which Emmons termed
‘very much the same”’ as W&L — at least at the
time. An all male, relatively small school, adher-
ing to the liberal arts tradition, Trinity differed
from W&L mainly in its northern location and
lesser emphasis on the fraternity scene.

At Trinity about a third as many students were
in fraternities as are here, primarily because in
Hartford, “alternatives in social life were not so
restricted as in Lexington.’’ Nonetheless, ‘‘it was
considered a privilege to live in a fraternity,’’ and
because members desired to maintain that privi-
lege, ‘there was less of the silliness’ that

sometimes seems to predominate among W&L’s
fraternities.

Today Trinity College remains a very similar
school to Washington and Lee, with one crucial dif-
ference. Trinity went coed in 1969, a move which
Emmons thinks W&L would do well to emulate.
‘“‘We want to have an institution of exceptional
people,”’ says Emmons, ‘But we're limiting
ourselves to half the market of bright students
who'd come to W&L.”’

A Fall 1979 issue of the Trinity Reporter hangs
on a wall opposite Emmons’ professorially clut-
tered Parmly Hall office, near: the stuffed
platypus. The issue deals with the tenth anniver-
sary of Trinity’s coeducation and contains infor-
mation which seems very pertinent to W&L’s cur-
rent, occasionally heated, debate on the subject.

Apparently at Trinity, the decision to coeducate
was made so quickly that the time for heated
debate was limited.

Theodore D. Lockwood, who had just become
the college’s president in 1969, is quoted in the
Reporter as saying, ‘Early in our discussions, it
became apparent that we weren’t talking about
whether the college should go coed, but rather
when and in what numbers. When the time came
to vote, the decision to admit women was

Within four months after consideration of
coeducation had begun at Trinity, recruitment of
women began. There were some minor initial dif-
ficulties when the first batch of women arrived on
campus the following fall.

There was some growling from alumni, though
annual giving continued to increase. The women
faced occasional male antagonism and a lack of
full-length mirrors and shower curtains. The men
were startled when the women started making
road trips of their own.

From a decade’s perspective, however, the con-
sensus, agreed upon by Emmons, is that Trinity’s
coeducation has been a real success, creating not
only a diverse student body, but also “‘other, in-
tangible, benefits such as a livelier intellectual at-
mosphere and a more natural social environ-
ment.”

According to the Reporter, “Perhaps the
greatest tribute to the success of the venture at
Trinity is that those faculty and administrators
who have known the college both as a single-sex
institution and as it is today have difficulty
remembering what it was like before the women
came. ‘Except that it’s better now,’ one faculty

Library Dedication

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will formally dedicate its
new $9-million undergraduate
library in a series of events this
Friday and Saturday.

The University board of
trustees has invited the public
to be its guests at a reception
Friday evening at 8:30 in the
main lobby of the library,
located immediately behind
historic Washington Hall.

The two-day dedication
celebration will begin earlier
Friday when Warren J. Haas,
president of the Council on
Library Resources Inc., speaks
in the Mary Moody Northen
Auditorium on the first lower
level in the library. He will
deliver his remarks at 11:30
a.m.

The Council on Library
Resources is a private founda-
tion, created in 1956 and sup-
ported since then by the Ford
Foundation, whose purpose is to
help find solutions of problems
of libraries in general and of
academic and_ research
libraries in particular.

Saturday’s events will focus
on the actual dedication of the
new undergraduate library, as
Dr. Edgar F. Shannon Jr.,

Law Students

To Graduate
Sunday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law will award
103 juris doctor degrees during
commencement exercises this
Sunday at 4:30 p.m. on the
historic Front Campus.

The public is invited to attend
the ceremony, which will take
place under the trees in front of
Robert E. Lee’s home, weather
permitting. If it should rain, the
ceremony will take place in Lee
Chapel.

Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate commencement
will take place June 5. The
reason for the earlier law
graduation is the difference in
the academic calendars be-
tween the law school and the
undergraduate divisions.

The law school remains on a
two-semester system, while the
undergraduate schools are on a
three-term, 12-12-6 week
system, and their spring-term
examinations do not conclude
until June 2.

The speaker at Sunday:s law
commencement will be W&L
president Robert E.R. Huntley.
By long-standing tradition at
Washington and Lee, the presi-
dent delivers the principal
graduation addresses.

A reception for the law
graduates, their family and
guests, faculty and alumni, will
follow the graduation
ceremony.

LH

former president of the Univer-
sity of Virginia, now president
of the federated chapters of Phi
Beta Kappa and Com-
monwealth professor of English

at U.Va., delivers principal
remarks at an 11:30 a.m.
ceremony.

The public is also invited to
attend that event, which will
take place on the new walkway
at the rain entrance to the
library. If the weather should
be bad, the ceremony will be
moved into the main lobby.

W&L moved into the new
library 15 months ago. This
weekend’s ceremonies coincide
with the regular spring meeting
on campus of the university
board.

The new library has shelf
space for half a_ million
volumes. Currently, W&L’s
undergraduate library collec-
tion numbers about 400,000
volumes, although some of
those holdings are located in
departmental libraries in the
natural sciences and in jour-
nalism.

W&L students and other users
of the library also have free ac-
cess to an additional 200,000
volumes in the Wilbur C. Hall
Library of the W&L law school.

The library is open 24 hours a

day when undergraduate
classes are in session.

Construction on the new
library was begun in mid-1976.
The architects were Marcellus
Wright, Cox & Smith of Rich-
mond, the firm that also design-
ed Lewis Hall, W&L’s four-
year-old law building. Bass
Construction Co. Inc., also of
Richmond, was the general con-
tractor.

Although it is a five-story
structure, the library was built
down into Wood’s Creek Valley,
and the roofline is only as high
as the first floor of Washington
Hall. The site, the scale, ex-
terior design, and_ building
materials, red brick and white
concrete vertical accents, com-
plement the neo-Classical ar-
chitecture of the historic Colon-
nade buildings behind which the
library is situated.

In a remark in a booklet the
university is publishing to mark
the library dedication, E. Mar-
shall Nuctxols Jr., rector (chair-
man) of the W&L_ board,
describes the library as “‘func-
tionally efficient (and) ar-
chitecturally distinguished,”’
and says it has already become
the “‘intellectual second home”’
of W&L’s professors and stu-
dent body.

EC Hears
Year End Reports

by Kevin Kirby

Year end reports from the
clubs and committees on the
W&L campus were presented to
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night.

Contact Chairman Channing
Hall told the EC that speakers
fees for the academic year
totaled $7,250.

He said this cost was as high
as it was because a plane had to
be chartered to fly Army Chief
of Staff William C. Westmore-
land to Lexington to speak
before the Washington and Lee
University community.

Hall noted that the committee
ended the academic year with a
$3,444.35 surplus in its account.

He said that this was due to
the unexpected low cost in
bringing Tom Wolfe to speak in
Lee Chapel.

“] don’t think this year’s
surplus should be reason for
lessening Contact’s budget next
year,’’ said Hall. We were just
lucky to get Tom Wolfe for next
to nothing.”’

He cited unsuccessful at-
tempts at getting choice
speakers for the Spring Term as
another reason why Contact’s
surplus account was high.

EC Junior Representative
Bob Willis moved that disperse-
ment of Contact funds revert
back to a reseve account which

Herrick To Head Economics

Bruce Hale Herrick, current-
ly associate professor of
economics at the University of
California at Los Angeles, will
become professor of economics
and head of the department at
Washington and Lee University
next fall.

Dr. Herrick will succeed E’
Claybrook Griffith as depart-
ment head at W&L and will
serve a five-year term in that
administrative capacity.

Dr. Griffith, 65, is retiring at
the end of the 1979-80 academic
year.

The incoming department
head is a native of Minnesota
and received his A.B. degree
with distinction from Carleton
College there.

He earned his Ph.D. in
economics from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1964,
and joined the UCLA faculty in
that year. In addition to his
teaching duties, he is also chair-
man of the UCLA economics
department’s graduate com-
mittee.

Herrick is a member of
several professional societies
including the American
Economic Association, the
Royal Economic Society and
the Society for International
Development.

At UCLA he has_ been
associate dean of the Graduate
Division, coordinator of the
Southern California Fulbright

EC President Steve Abraham
explained held all excess money
in univesity accounts during the
summer.

“This will encourage future
committees to get their money
back in the early summer or as
soon as possible,”’ Willis said.

He added that Contact could
pay bills encountered during
the summer out of the reserve
fund and have its negative
balance reimbursed in the fall.

The Film Society showed nine
films this year at a cost of
$1,525, Jay Diesing told the EC.

He said the Society had $25
left in funds that it will save for
next year.

Diesing listed $950 in contri-
butions to the film Society and a
$600 grant from the EC as the
source of financial backing for
the 1979-1980 academic year.

The English Club reported to
the EC that because of adver-
tisement in advance, among
other things, club activities this
past academic year were well
attended.

When asked by EC President
STeve Abraham if the club con-
sidered charging dues, a
spokesman responded, ‘‘The
club thought about charging
English Club members dues;
but only nine people showed up
at the first meeting and because
funds were received from the
EC and outside sources, there
was no shortage of funds and

thus, no need to charge dues.”’

A Look At The 70’s

by Malcolm Kendall

The bicentenial year, 1976, started off well,
when Mr. John Lee Pratt left twenty percent of his
estate, the equivalent of eleven million dollars, to
Washington and Lee. Mr. Pratt, a prominent
business executive, died at the age of 96 and left
the money to W&L under the conditions that it be
used for scholarships to outstanding students, and
to increase salaries of faculty.

When the SAB signed the Spinners for Spring
Weekend in 1976, the rock fans protested. The rock
fans felt that soul fans had had enough perfor-
mances for one year, while rock fans had not hada
concert to satisfy them.

Rock fans argued that the Spinners were only
playing an hour and a half away the night before in
Charlottesville, if anyone wanted to go see them.

In defence the SAB said that they had tried to
get a good rock band, but they were either too ex-
pensive or already booked, and that they had only
sponsored two soul bands that year.

The SAB went ahead with the concert, and to the
disappointment of the rock fans, the Spinners
were a great success.

Of all the events this year, the Mock Convention
had to be the biggest and most successful. The 1976
Mock Convention not only nominated Georgia
Gov. Jimmy Carter as the Democratic Presiden-

tial Nominee, but also correctly chose Senator
Walter Mondale as his running mate.

There were a few celebrities on campus that
year also. They included Truman Capote as a
guest Contact speaker. George C. Scott also
visited our campus, filming a documentary on
Robert E. Lee’s post-Civil War years as president
of Washington and Lee, which aired on NBC.

George Stadler, an SAE pledge, did not think
much of the 1977 school year, when his costume
made out of cotton adhesive tape caught fire,
engulfing him in flames. Unable to put the flames
out himself, he was immediately assisted by those
standing near by.

He was taken to Stonewall Jackson Hospital and
later transferred to the University of Virginia
burn center, where he was released a few days
later.

In protest over stricter marijuana rules set
down by the Student Control committee, EC
member Rick Goddard lit up and smoked what
looked like a joint. Goddard felt that the new rules
were “foolish” because they only applied to the
dorms and pot.

He was quoted as saying, “‘I’ll give my key to
anyone who wants to smoke in the EC room.”

ner visited W&L as a Contact speaker, and spoke
on his philosophy for succeeding in sports. The Phi
was quoted as saying that he was ‘‘greeted with an
ovation only second to that given his wife
Christe.’ Elizabeth Taylor was also a guest
speaker.

The Law School was also dedicated that year.

The basketball team was ranked 2nd in the
NCAA Division III, finishing the season with a 21-2
record, but lost in the first round of the Division III
tournament.

Coincidentally, eighty Boxwood bushes were
given to the University by Wilmer S. Poiner, Jr.

In the spring of ’77 the Phi listed all of the ‘gut
courses” available, so students could maintain, as
they put it, ‘‘a road trip-party-lacrosse game to
studying ratio.”’

The courses ranged from Art 101 to Computer
Science 100, giving the handbook description, then
their own...“‘easy.”’

The 1978 school year started in controversy over
Charlie Hulfish, the SAB co-chairman, who had
taken out a loan for $175 from the SAB the year
before. He was to have paid it back within two
weeks, but had not.

Rock Goddard, an EC member who had found
out about the loan, wanted to have Hulfish kicked
off the SAB and pay the money back with interest.

After an “emotional and tensewrought’”’ EC
meeting Hulfish was retained by a 5-4 vote, only to
resign his position a few months later, and have to
leave school.

Contact also got into trouble with the EC by

By a unanimous vote the EC took back $590 from
Contact. This had also been the responsibility of
EC member Rick Goddard, who resigned a month
later, because it took up too much time. He had
been responsible for more than 75% of all the EC
motions.

The basketball team had another great year,
and were 22-6 for the season, but only won their
first round game in the NCAA Division ITI tourna-
ment. Coach Verne Canfield was named the

ended in it, with the “‘Rank-Tam Poon.” This was
the lampoon issue of the Ring-tum Phi which the
administration labled as ‘‘distasteful, disgusting,
and a disgrace to the University.” It was thought
that the administration also had 50 to 75 of these
papers picked up because they might offend the
parents of prospective students. The Publishing
Board fired the R-tP editor Michael Gallagher for
“‘irresponsibility,’’ but the EC reinstated him as
editor. The Publishing Board then suspended the
R-tP, in protest to the reinstatement, until they
reached a decision with the EC. Gallagher finally
resigned saying the pressure was too much.

The 1979 school year had to be highlighted by the
“‘library move.”

All the books needed to be moved from the old
library, 150,000 volumes. As it turned out, 1,600
people including students, faculty, and townspeo-
ple, helped, moving all the books in just two and a
half hours when it was planned to take up to eight
hours.

The whole thing was a great success, and to top
everything off, there was a party in McCormick.

The old library began its $3.5 million, 18-month
renovation to become the new School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics.

The Muscular Distrophy Marathon was started
this year by Jay Blumberg, raising $17,000 for
M.D., which was three times more than they ex-

ee pected. The only other memorable event of this

year was the visit of Ralph Nader to W&L, to

speak on corporate power.

The ’70’s ended with a “‘bang,”’ with both the
anti-Iran rally and the Boxwood ‘‘bush hopping”
incident. The anti-Iran rally, sparked by the tak-
ing of fifty American hostages in Iran, involved
approximately 400 students gathered in front of
the Law School, chanting ‘Nuke ’em till they
glow’, ‘It worked in Japan, try it in Iran’, and
“‘Nuke the Ayatollah...’

The students also burned the Kohmeini three
times in effigy, and finally marched through
downtown Lexington, where they had a brief en-

Le Cardinal Offers French Cuisine Spring

by John Wells

Lexington is fortunate to
boast a new resaurant at the
corner of Lee and Nelson. ‘‘Le
Cardinal Restaurant francaise”’
opened its doors two weeks ago
and offers the area a variety of
traditional French dishes in a
pleasant, relaxed atmosphere.

The owners, Francois Blot
and Geoffrey Hoge, have each
acquired years of experience in
their profession, and this is
quite evident in Le Cardinal’s
unique atmosphere, excellent
service and fine, meticulously
prepared foods.

The menu, which changes
from time to time, will feature
regional French cuisine with
two specialties each day. Begin-
ning in the fall, the owners plan
to offer food from Russia,
China, North Africa, Belgium,
Hungary and other countries on
a monthly basis.

The current menu includes a
variety of entrees, legumes and
desserts at relatively moderate
prices.

Dining is an important aspect
of French culture. Most schools
and businesses in that country
close down from noon until 2
p.m. for a relaxed midday
meal. In addition, most produce
in France is sold fresh at open
markets. Good wine and lots of

freshly baked bread is con-
sidered essential.

The owners of Le Cardinal in-
sist on this in America as well.
They receive fresh produce

 

from Roanoke and Charlottes-
ville, and each morning the
baker freshly prepares and
bakes the breads, pastries and
pate en corute.

Every dish at Le Cardinal is
made from scratch, from pate
to the delicious vinagrette in the
Salade Cardinal.

The owners, both French
born, chose Lexington as a loca-
tion for their restaurant from
previous associations with the
city.

Blot taught french at W&L as
part of an exchange program
here in 1970, and Hoge has
relatives in the area. As of May
19 they were still waiting the ar-
rival of their chef, Gerrard
Rouvenacht, from San Diego.
Chef Rouvenacht was formerly
a chef at Georgetown’s Rive
Gauche, one of Washington’s
finest restaurants.

He will man Le Cardinal until
the full-time chef, Xavier
Gireaud, receives a visa to
come to the United States. Blot
is currently in charge of
preparations.

The dining areas have been
redecorated with antique and
contemporary French posters
from Paris and New Orleans,
and original prints from
Diderot’s 18th century ‘“En-
cyclopedia’’. The atmosphere is

Potter Finds Words Of Praise For Ariel

by Parker Potter

Reviewing a literary magazine like Ariel is a tricky business
because it requires a critical assessment of two distinct acts, the
primary act of creation of literary works and the secondary, but no
less creative act, of compilation and ordering of those pieces of
literary creation.

A lapse of either end of things, poor writing or poor editing, can
sink a magazine and poor writing, poorly edited, well—the result of
that combination is too messy to even think about.

And besides — the point of this exposition is the fact that Chris
Fay’s second Ariel is a triumph on both levels. It contains a good bit
of good writing effectively and attractively presented.

(One interesting note is the fact that this time around Fay lists
himself not as an editor but as a member of the collective which in-
cludes Chip McPhetters, John Sadd, Tom Salley and Channing
Hall.

I’m not quite sure how this editorial board operated, but with no
intention of slighting the other members, I am inclined to give Fay
much of the credit for this Ariel if only because he took so much of
the heat for the last one.

Speaking of the last Ariel, I find this one to be light years more
satisfying. Generally I like the individual works better and I also
prefer their presentation this time around.

One of the real bright spots last time, the use of art work, was
taken a step further in this Ariel by the inclusion of brush painting
by Nick Martin, Chris Menefee and Jeff Shumate. Giving new
perspectives on the creative life at W&L is just whatAriel is here to
do.

There are other praiseworthy aspects to Ariel’s construction.
Space is quite well utilized. (There’s a great deal going on in Ariel
— surprisingly much — but it doesn’t look cramped or crowded).

Further, there is a clearly conscious and intelligent arrangement
of the pieces in Ariel.

For example, the first six pieces each deal with the outside world.
Winos, pigeon feeders, Asbury Park. These six disparate examina-

 

photograph by Richard Essex

tions of a very public world work well together.

Then for the next five pieces we are jolted sharply to the very
private vision which so dominated the previous Ariel. In this group-
ing too, we have a number of different perspectives, each strugg]-
ing to show the reader a different, very personal world.

The rest of the magazine doesn’t work for me in quite so formal a
manner but that is no implicit criticism. Generally speaking, the
pace of the rest of the magazine is very good with the possible ex-
ception of the placement of Jim Leva’s two pieces next -to Phil
Welch’s poem.

Not that your basic reader is a simpleton, but a bit of a breather
between these thoughtful and thought provoking pieces might have
been helpful.

Though this Ariel might not have quite the single vi-
sion/wholeness of its predecessor, it is as carefully crafted and any
apparrent conventionality of presentation is achieved with no loss
of artistic integrity.

In all, then, this is a fine editorial effort. But like I said above
—the best editorial job in the world can’t save trash. And in this
case it doesn’t have to. Good writing is what makes this Ariel go.

So onward.

There is all kinds of good stuff going on in these poems which lead
off Ariel.

The opening of Chris Fay’s “Holes ‘N Winos”’ is delightfully ar-
resting, ‘‘Winos like saxophones/on the bandstand/lean/sunning/in
front of a stone/sucking the warmth/out of cigarettes.”’

One is set to accept that the winos get their heat from the sun
which holds them in place like saxophones, but Fay plays upon our
expectations to show the differentness of winos.

A big shiny sun is doing its thing, but winos turn to the smokey
orange glow of a cigarette for their warmth.

And this all works well with the wino dream which closes the
poem. The best that ‘‘big human wings” can fly a wino away to isa
romantically lit boxcar, certainly hobo heaven, but a pretty empty

About Yesterday's Game

Unforunately, the powerful
Phi is as helpless as the rest of
you when it comes to games
which are played nine hours
away, a day after our deadline.

But we do know this: the
Generals lost to Syracuse by a
score of 12-4. W&L was even at
the end of the first quarter but
fell behind at the half, 6-2.
Syracuse then ran the score up
to 9-2, and the game was all but
decided at that point.

Mike Pressler scored two
goals for the Generals, while
George Santos and Jay Foster
each netted one.

Chris Kearney scored to
break a 3-3 tie at the 11:56
mark. About a minute later
Geoff Wood netted a goal to put
the Generals up by 2. Co-
Captain John Hooper then
scored early in the fourth period
to put W&L ahead by three
goals with about 14 minutes to
play.

Hofstra took advantage of
that time to mount a scoring
drive of their own which tied the

game 6-6 at the end of regula-
tion play.

That sent the game into over-
time periods of four minutes
each, the game going to the first
team to score.

Play was stalemated for the
first 3 minutes of the first over-
time period. But the Flying Dut-
chmen’s Bob Quinlan scored his
third goal of the game to give
Hofstra the 7-6 victory.

Commentary:

In the 1980 Lax Tournament,
Prepare For the Unexpected

by Bill Whalen

For the gentlemen in charge
of giving out bids to the NCAA
Division I lacrosse tournament,
what a difference a year makes.
Instead of the anger and confu-
sion over last year’s pairings,
the lacrosse community seems
content with this year’s selec-
tions.

And here’s why.

In 1979, the only positions
guaranteed in the tournament
were the top four positions.
Johns Hopkins, Maryland,
Navy and Virginia each had re-
mained firmly embedded in the
top four places throughout the
regular season. But below those
teams existed a mad scramble
for the remaining five spots.

In 1980, there has been a
scramble below the top spots,
leaving six spots up for grab go-
ing into the final few weeks. But
fortunately for the selection
committee, some trends began
to take place in these last
weeks, making the choices all
the simpler.

And here are some examples.

— Syracuse, despite losing (to
be more accurate, being
humiliated) by W&L, did not
lose another game, making the
Orangemen’s position stronger
with each rating.

— Maryland, perennially a
high finisher, lost important
games at home throughout the
season and kicked itself out of
the tournament by losing to
Baltimore.

— The Northern teams
(Rutgers, Army, and
Massachusetts) knocked each
other out by playing a round
robin elimination sort of season.

But of all the teams involved
in this year’s selecting process,
perhaps the Washington and

Lee Generals had the greatest
influence on who would play
whom. By slipping three not-
ches in the polls, the Generals
allowed some teams who would
normally not be invited.

The luckiest team, obviously,
was North Carolina. Had the
Tar Heels lost to W&L two
weeks ago, they would have
been fortunate to get the No. 8
spot. Instead, the Tar Heels are
fifth, facing a showdown with
Dick Szlaza’s Navy team.

But even though the pairings
have received favorable
reviews, not much is different
from last year. Three of last
year’s top four teams were in
this year’s tournament’s top
four, and only three teams in
this year’s playoffs were absent
in 1979. It is interesting to note
that Syracuse and Virginia, two
teams which seemed crippled
by early and embarassing
losses, made the biggest climb
from last year. The Wahoos
were fourth last year and first
this year, while Syracuse was
seventh last year, but third this
year,

Because this was written
before the playoffs began, I
shall refrain from picking any
team to win it all. I will,
however, note who has an easy
road and who does not.

At No. 8, Cornell seems to
have benefited more from its
reputation than anything else in
making the magic eight. If the
Red Men beat Virginia, they
will then visit either UNC or
Navy. One road win in the tour-
nament is amazing, two are
almost unheard of.

At No. 7, Harvard made the
grade by unanimously staying
high in the polls each week. The
Crimson Tide will earn upset of
the year awards if they beat

players had a good game.

Goalie Bob Clements made an
astounding 31 saves as the
Generals were outshot 58-39.
Rob Staugitis came up with two
assists, boosting his season
total to 37.

W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer commented about the
General’s final regular season
game, ‘‘Hofstra just never gave
up...they were a_ relentless
group and managed to turn it
around.”

Hopkins — but don’t count on it.

At No. -§ UNC it «4
schizophrenic’s delight, either
winning or losing in a grandiose
fashion. The Tar Heels’ for-
tunes depends on whether the
Dr. Jeckyl or Mr. Hyde team
plays.

At No. 4, Navy has had the
luck to lose most of its games
early in the season. The Middies
can bury a team (as they did
against Maryland), or be buried
(as they were against Hopkins).

At No. 3, Syracuse could be
the hottest team in the nation.
Despite an incredibly tough
schedule, including three
playoff teams, the Orangemen
have lost once.

At No. 2, Johns Hopkins has
also lost only once, with that
loss also coming at the hands of

a Virginia-based team. Since
the loss to UVA, Hopkins has
been unstoppable — most
noticeablly against Navy and
Maryland.

At No. 1, Virginia is com-
peting against two tough op-
ponents — injury and nerves.
The Cavs need a healthy Steve
Kraus and Bato Pellington, as
well as nerves of steel to withs-
tand the pressures of being the
top team,

And what of W&L?

Well, the Generals need ot-
fense, and tons of it, to go all the
way. If W&L gives the same
performances it did against
Rutgers and Syracuse, then
look out. But if the Generals
continue to score only seven
goals a game, then the season

will be over before you know it.

So in the meantime, enjoy this
tournament. In one of the most
unpredictable years of lacrosse,
the winner of the tournament
may also be a longshot.

He asked EC members to

Fencing Club spokesman Colt

The team finished top among
fencing clubs in the state,
managing to do so in spite of
graduating two of last year’s

Puryear noted that the team
managed quite well even
though it received only one-
tenth of the $2,500 it requested
from the EC, which was one-
fifth of what the club had
received from the EC last year.

Puryear said that funds
generated by the club covered
expenses for the year and left
an ending balance of $35.62.

Cold Check Chairman Jim
Vines presented the financial
report to the EC noting that the
figure with which they started
the academic year was almost
exactly the same as the $1,152
figure in their present, end-of-
year account.

Vines said, ‘‘This is due to the
pretty good improvement over
last year in the number of
bounced checks.”

“We started the year with a
good position and we ended up
in a good position,” he told the
EC.

Senior Representative Jay

The EC granted his request
with a 7-1 vote and one absten-
tion.

Hamilton told the EC “as
soon as the yearbooks arrive we
will start handing them out.”

Parker Roberts, co-editor of
next year’s CALYX, told the EC
that Mock Convention related
material would appear in the
CALYX, byt pictures of the con-

He indicated that inclusion of
the Mock Convention pictures
could have held up completion

in its recent decision to take
away the salaries of editors and

‘‘The Pub Board objects to be-

than being worked with,” said
Potter.

In rebuttal, Blumberg said
that he felt there was little stu-

ion of salaries for some editors

on the Pub Board, and that
‘nothing has stopped the

No more than ten universities

business are Pascal Applin-
court of Chartres and Jean
DesCamp of Paris, who will ar-
rive in Lexington this fall. The

dream for anyone else.

Dan Weeks provides this Ariel with another of his thoughtful str-
ings of images, called ‘‘Asbury Park in Mid-September.’’ Of par-
ticular interest is his linkage of a scuffling leaf peircing
nothingness and ‘‘a man hurtling into silence.”

Here he shows that it is the observer and the observer only who'
can bring together the teenaged slut and the burst of rock ’n roll to!
people and furnish the implicit vacuum of the city.

(Just as an aside, my favorite line in the whole volume is ‘‘The
custard is gone”’ from Weeks’ poem).

Phil Welch’s poem ‘‘Maxie”’ is a faScinating study of motion. The
idea of winds being cornered and dying and the idea of wind not be-
ing able to escape makes one wonder if the last brief whirl of the
bread crumbs isn’t indeed a beginning and not an end.

For me, the end of this poem is a beginning and serves as an ex-
cellent jumping off point for Jim Leva’s long poem.

For Leva it is not bread crumbs but blood and he details the cycle
of degeneration and regeneration, the cycle of life hinted at in
Welsh’s poem.

Leva’s is an artful construct which finally realizes itself as artful.
‘But really, what's the big deal now?’’ Suddenly Leva jumps from
the ‘‘artistic vision,’ what the poet can create of symbols and im-
ages,

‘the cold blood that made Bokassa fat for la gloire

de la France (like the gore of France

that painted the Pont d’ Arole

or christened the rues bourgeois Paris )

From this he jumps to a “real vision’’ of what an over ‘‘prac-
tical’ man makes of the ideas around him:

Perhaps as in Belgium, poppies will grow.

They'll be more useful now. There

they're a traditional crop. I believe,

a common cash crop, at least in neighboring Laos.”’

Which vision do you think is Leva’s?

Like his poem, Leva’s story ‘‘Izaak,”’ deals in contrasts. His
great skill here is dealing in modern idiom with characters and
issues to seemingly medevial.

What Izaak’s mother and her prodigious buboes clearly beg for is
a Guiness Book of Records reporter and a camera crew from the
Six o'clock news.

As always — one is impelled through Leva’'s story by his unique
vision of the language and the freedom it allows him,

And in terms of freedom allowed by language, the more I read by
Palmore Clarke, the more I'm on to what he’s up to.

His two pieces, ‘*Thanksgiving’’ and ‘‘Hampton Blvd.” work at
defining that place where we all live, on the border between inside

Outing

by Dave Dallam

A survey of the present
freshman class conducted last
summer, as well as a general
interest among the student
body, indicates that there is a
demand for the provision of ac-
tivities other than those conven-
tionally offered by campus
fraternities, according to a re-
cent proposal outlining a possi-
ble Outing Program.

The proposal states that in the
past few years students have
been requesting extra-
curricular activities which the

Le Cardinal offers local
patrons a pleasurable dining ex-
perience with excellent food
and service.

Closed on Mondays, it is open
from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. for
breakfast, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for
lunch, and from 6 until 10 p.m.

rently provide, due in large
measure to the increasing
diversity of the student body
here. Accordingly, the proposal
suggests that the University
should implement a program
which might offset the disad-
vantages of attracting prospec-
tive students to a single sex col-
lege ina rural and remote area.
Such a program might also
potentially offer students the
opportunity to develop leader-
ship and self-reliance capabili-
ties which are essential to good
character development.

means of constructing the parallels so necessary to each of us ini
straddling the lines between the inner and outer world.

i nave only scratched the surface of Ariel. There is much more
that is good going on. Chip Rush’s remarkable work with images of
blackness in ‘“‘Balthus Laments,”’ the wry wit and irony of Steve
McCabe’s wonderful ‘‘The Preying Mantis” are two pieces that
spring to mind.

- Tom Salley’s ‘‘During the Occupation”’ with its distinctive echos
of a couple of scenes from Dr. Zhivago is a thought provoking ex-
amination of a man’s position vis ’a vis other men and the con-
structs we all must make.

Katherine Reich is back with two very personal, probing poems.
And Phil Welch provides a major poetic work ‘‘Saigyo” which I’ve
simply not had time to consider.

In all, Fay’s second Ariel is a triumph and if anyone was looking
for such a thing, a vindication. This Ariel contains a wide variety of
styles and genres yet retains a style and certainly hangs well
together.

With this Ariel I think that Fay has found the broad audience that
is out there without any artistic sacrifice. A tribute to that is the
fact that there are so many stones I’ve left unturned in this review.

The solution to that minor problem? Easy — read Ariel.

Emmons; 20 Years At Washington & Lee

' (continued from page 1)

member has said. ‘The quality of life here is much
healthier — less frenetic and more civilized!’ ’’

Following his graduation from Trinity in 1950,
Emmons taught biology and mathematics at
Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va. for
seven years. He says that he hasn't ‘‘kept up well
enough”’ with Episcopal to comment on changes in
that school during the last three decades, but notes
that “‘it’s entirely different — I don’t recognize it
any more.”

The events which ultimately brought Emmons
to Washington and Lee began, oddly enough, with
the Russians’ launching of Sputnik in 1954.
America’s science community was sufficiently
shocked by this display of Soviet technology that
they hastily established the National Science
Foundation, its primary aim being to compete
with the Russians.

Among the foundation’s programs was the crea-
tion of university “‘institutes’’ which ‘‘gave secon-
dary school teachers a chance to catch up on
scientific development.”

It was under one of these one-year grants that
Emmons first came to the University of Virginia
in 1957. Since it was only a one-year program, Em-
mons says, “I really went hog wild! I took full ad-
vantage of it, really worked myself to my limit...
and when that year was over, I was awarded other
grants to continue.”’ He adds, magnanimously but
sincerely, ‘‘I owe all my success to NFS.”’

Emmons considers graduate school to be a
highly gratifying experience because ‘‘there can
be total involvement in a particular area. It’s ex-
citing...plus, you’re older. I was more highly
motivated than as an undergraduate.”’

During his final graduate year, Emmons came
to W&L exploring job opportunities. ‘‘Arriving at
W&L in 1960,’’ he says, “‘was like coming to UVa,”
for at that time the two schools were still very
similar, especially on the undergraduate level.
“The old guard traditions were still in vogue...coat
and tie, the conversational tradition, the friendly
atmosphere.”’

  
   

Within a decade, most of these traditions had
ended. The University of Virginia had even begun
to admit women as undergraduates. While Em-
mons, with his gray beard and casual manner,
hardly seems tradition-bound, he maintains that
some of the time-honored forms had their value.

‘When I came to W&L,”’ he says, “everyone
spoke to everyone — faculty and students alike. If
you had to cross campus for something, you'd
never try it between classes...you’d end up talking
to everyone!”’ This conversational tradition ended
with that of the coat and tie, as the late sixties and
Vietnam brought a temper to the university.

“Everyone was doing his own thing,’’ Emmons
recalls. ‘‘It was the age of relevance.’’ Even at
historically conservative Washington and Lee, a
‘Free University’’ was established. ‘‘People were
growing potatoes, composting, raising bees.”’
Non-credit classes in these disciplines ‘‘were held
in various rooms around town, with as many as
twenty to thirty people sitting in on them.”

On campus, also, changes were being made to
accommodate changing times. In May, 1970, for
example, the faculty permitted students to elect to
receive an ‘incomplete’ in any or all second
semester courses in order to “participate more
freely in national issues.’’ The work was to be
made up by September 30 or recorded as an F.

At the end of the semester, 397 students had
taken 889 I’s. Most courses were ultimately made
up. 150 ended up as F’s.

Longer-lasting trends began also. A new cur-
riculum was introduced, changing distribution re-
quirements and contributing to a decrease in the
number of students involved in certain disciplines.

More students became involved in ‘“‘relevant’”’
courses like economics, history and the sciences,
and less in some of the traditional liberal arts
courses. Business Administration, for example,
was twice as popular a major in 1970 as it had been
five years earlier.

Emmons refers to the current academic.scene
as one of “‘new relevance — now, with a depressed
economy, the business school is the largest’’ at
W&L. ‘“‘When you get out of college, you’re going
to have to know something, to have a salable com-
modity.”’

He also notes that in the Commerce school,
“demands are tough. If the other departments
made the same demands, they wouldn’t have
students.”’ This problem and that of grade escala-
tion can be traced directly back to the new cur-
riculum, says Emmons. ‘There was grade escala-
tion in order to attract students. If you didn’t have
‘relevant’ courses, you couldn’t attract students
otherwise.”’

For evidence of grade escalation, Emmons sug-
gests taking a look at the Reports of the Registrar
for various years. From these, some trends can be
easily detected.

The fall term Dean’s List in 1967 included 237
people; in the fall of 1975, that number was up to
492. Last year’s list carried 454 names.

Similarly, the number of students graduating
with honors increased from 42 in 1965 to 121 in 1975,
with 14 attaining summa cum laude status in 1975
as compared with one ten years earlier. Last year,
106 people graduated with honors. —

 

Hamric & Sheridan

 

 

The percentage of A’s given in courses has in-
creased from slightly over 11 percent in 1960 to
over 23 percent in 1979. In the same period, C’s
have decreased from almost 40 percent of grades
given in 1960 to about 25.5 percent, with B’s hang-
ing steady at about 35 percent.

Emmons deplores the high incidence of grade
escalation at W&L and other universities, as well
as the “how little do I need to do, just to get
through”’ attitude of many of today’s students. He
feels a “how much can I do to satisfy my needs”
attitude would be desirable, but admits that
widespread adoption of such an attitude would be
highly unlikely.

‘The way the system stands now, there’s really
a self-perpetuating problem. If you do make
demands and expect your students to do things
and find they don’t, there’s not much you can do.
We (professors ) are aware of your failure to do the
minimum amount of work. If you make an assign-
ment, you don’t expect the student to do it,’ Em-
mons says.

‘The problem of permissiveness,” he continues,
‘‘is started at home, and generated in the secon-
dary schools. We are teaching students who have-
not been disciplined.’ As a result, ‘‘students
categorically are not as well prepared, nor as in-
volved or diligent,’’ as they were in the early six-
ties when ‘‘students requested seminars, extra
reading and discussions, for no credit.”’

Only partially tongue-in-cheek, Emmons also
notes that Wednesday night parties were not in ex-
istence then, being yet another innovation of the
late sixties. Prior to that, he explains, ‘‘there were
party weekends — four a year — when there were
real bashes with lots of preparation. They were
very successful.”

Emmons finds some consolation in W&L’s low
student-faculty ratio and its selective admissions
standards. ‘‘We’re very selective,” he says, “‘yet
we still get students who meet our prerequisites
and can’t read or write.’’ He adds that most can do
math and have some proficiency in the natural
sciences. This, too, he credits to Sputnik.

When he isn’t musing over the problems of the
current academic system, trying to correct them,
traveling to far-flung places to pursue his re-
search, or giving interviews, Emmons likes to
take pictures, fly, soar, hike, camp and brew beer
at home with his family.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Salaries

The door to meddling in the daily operations of the
university’s publications has been left wide open by a
recent EC decision regarding the salaries of editors
and business managers of Ariel, The CALYX and the
Ring-tum Phi.

The writer is opposed to salaries, but is even more
opposed to the manner in which the EC abolished
salaries.

There seems to be two problems with the EC’s deci-
sion, which is pregnant with dangerous possibilities.

First the EC appears to have violated its constitu-
tion in handing down its verdict on salaries.

Two sections of the constitution could be used here,
but the latter of the two sections is more applicable
than the first.

Section V of the Constitution is found on page 18 of
the Student Handbook.

Section A. states, ‘‘The Executive Committee shall
have legislative, executive and judicial powers in all
matters pertaining to the Student Body Organiza-
tion.”

However, Section G. says, ‘‘It shall have appellate
jurisdiction of the Publication Board and may after
notice and hearing and upon two-thirds vote of the en-
tire Committee at two successive meetings, reverse
any order of the Board.’

Salaries are an order of the Publications Board, but
the EC did not give notice and did not achieve a two-
thirds majority of the entire committee.

While the abolition of salaries is a good idea, it is an
end that would be best achieved if so done within the
framework of the Student Body Constitution.

Does this decision by the EC mean that every time
it does not like a publication or a Publications Board
decision it will hand down an arbitrary ruling?

We hope not—that would certainly have a bearing
on the editorial policy of the Phi and detract from the
overall quality of the University’s publications.

A second question which arises is why did this
year’s EC and not next year’s EC act on this matter?

EC President-elect Bob Willis has gone on record as
being opposed to salaries but voted in favor of
salaries two weeks ago because he opposed the pre-
sent EC acting on this matter.

Obviously the problem is a difficult one for the EC.
It has legislative, executive and judicial powers, a
combination most likely to be found in the Soviet
Union.

But this is not the Soviet Union, it is not even the
real world.

Yet we hope that next year’s EC will see that the EC
has made an error (we all do) and move to correct a
potentially dangerous situation.

We don’t think the EC should or even wants to
monitor and dictate the University’s publications
standards and practices, a situation which could arise
because of the EC’s decision on the salary question.

Dear Editor:

I have just a few comments
about the EC’s May 12 decision
to abolish the Publication
Board’s salaries and its affir-
mation of that decision Monday
night.

At stake here is not the ques-
tion of salaries but rather the
propriety of a governmental
body, the EC making decisions
about actions of the press (the
Publications Board).

Dictating to the Publications
Board how to spend its money is
not far from telling the Ring-
tum Phi what to print.

(You can spend only $400 this
week. That is eight pages. So
bag this, this, and this story and
run that one. )

The rub is that the EC, for the
student body, allocates money
to the Phi and therefore has a
responsibility to oversee the
spending of that money.

And so we have a justifiable
green-backed link between
the press
(government superior, of
course).

The real world, though, has a
first amendment, freedom of
speech, etc. But then, Congress
does not fund the Washington
Post.

Things are tricky, admitted-
ly. But what we need here is
trust. The EC must trust the
Publications Board exclusively
to deal with its money matters
as well as with its editorial mat-

ters, if only because every

fiscal decision is a_ little
editorial and every editorial

matter is a little fiscal.

The Publications Board
recognizes the right and the
responsibility of the EC to ex-
press student opinion and to
protect the best interests of the
student body.

But we feel that that respon-
sibility is adequately discharg-
ed by getting issues, salaries
among them, on the record in
open EC meetings. Monthly
reports are an excellent step in
this direction.

These comments are inspired by a recent editorial about Univer-
sity Council elections. In that editorial the point is made that
W&L is the one place where students and faculty administration
can come together to talk about issues like Wednesday night par-
ties and weeknight Cockpit bands.

We’ve been round and round about these two issues before but
there are a couple of points that need to be made.

First, if a fellow wants to blow off on a Wednesday night, he’ll
blow it off, party or no party. Perhaps without Wednesday night
parties per se that fellow and his friends would spread their
slackness around and blow off different nights each week, thus
making whatever problem exists far less easy to detect, probably
satisfying those shortsighted few who equate Wednesday parties
with any and all academic ills at W&L.

sul whatever the academic problems — a party ban won't solve
it.

This isn’t to suggest that there aren’t problems with Wednesday
parties. But the degree to which a weeknight party is a problem is
the degree to which a fraternity member (particularly a
freshman...) feels obligated to attend it, because it is paid for by
regular social dues.

As long as week night parties are pay-as-you-go affairs (as many
are now) attendance and non-attendance become equally viable
choices. And so long as it is as easy not to go as it is to go, there is no
problem.

Banning Wednesday parties is just a short step away from telling
people that they can’t watch “Charlie's Angels” on a school night.

A large part of college is learning to be adult and a large part of
being an adult is dealing with choices. The right of the individual to

choose what he wants to do shouldn't be legislated away.

Further, I don’t think that there's any pressing need to legislate
away that right to choose. When other matters have pressed I've
Kinniburgh Replies

Dear Editor:

I confess that through the
course of 22 articles I have writ-
ten for the Ring-tum Phi, I pur-
posely misinformed my fans not
once, but on many occasions.
For example, throughout the
course of the year, I have
misspelled Gary Numan as
“Gary Norman’, ‘Gary Non-
man’’, “Gary Neuman’’ and
“Gray Numon.”’ I apologize
sincerely to Mr. Numan and
Atlantic Records, but I just
couldn’t decide on the correct
spelling or for that matter, any

spelling. I can’t blame such a _

series of errors on the first
typist or typesetter, because
that would be silly.

Also, I have’ purposely
mislead one-half of my public in
that I routinely quote Billboard,
Walrus, and College Media
Journal, especially the charts
that deal with new album
movers and retail action, and I
don’t specify which new album
chart I am using. Of course, my
original intentions in each case
is to dupe the public into believ-
ing that Pink Floyd has not held
the number one spot on
Billboard’s Hot 100 Album
Chart (Based on Retail Sales)
for the last 20 weeks. I really
shouldn’t give that credit to
Elvis Costello because he has
held the top spot on _ the
Billboard New Album Action
Chart (Based on Radio Play).
Again, my attention to specifici-
ty is lacking.

Finally, I have polluted the
print of the Ring-tum Phi by us-
ing images that a 4th grader
could have figured out. The use

of words such as ‘‘semi,’’ and
“Styx” I will readily agree is a
bit stupid and take much in-
tellect to correctly put together.
I really should refrain from any
use of a word that is not 1) a pro-
per noun 2) a verb or 3) a con-
junction, as this will preclude
any irresponsible imagery that
might offend a RTP reader. To
close my apology — I will ask
for each reader’s forgiveness
and if possible make restitution
for all damages incurred by
reading my articles. Be assured
also that I am recalling all ar-
ticles that I have written for
Paradise Records’ in
Hollywood, CA, Atlantic
Records of New York, RSO
Records of Los Angeles, RCA
Records (Division of Video
Research), Warner Brothers
Records and 415 Records of Los
Angeles and San Francisco,
Sire Records and many, many
others. But funny, they never
complained or refused to print
any of my lies.

Outing Club Proposal

Rockclimbing And Canoeing

(continued from page 8)

The recent survey of the
freshman class indicates that
students are overwhelmingly in
favor of the establishment of an
Outing program which would
provide such activities as
rockclimbing, backpacking and
canoeing. The proposal sug-
gests that a commensurate
percentage of upperclassmen
may be interested in such a pro-
gram as well.

The proposal does not sug-
gest, however, that this Outing
program would be offered in
competition with fraternity ac-
tivities, but rather, as a comple-
ment. Noting that the frater-
nities used to provide their
members with an adequate
range of extra-curricular ac-
tivities, the proposal states that
they no longer fulfill this func-
tion satisfactorily. Through an
outing program, both indepen-
dent and fraternity ,»member
alike would be given the oppor-
tunity to broaden thefnselves.

The proposal further states

that other colleges, such as
Dartmouth, Williams and the
University of Wisconsin, have
successfully implemented pro-
grams of their own and found
them useful in attracting and
developing a well-rounded stu-
dent body. Washington and Lee
could, conceivably, adopt from
these existing programs the
blueprint for its program. This
task should not be difficult,
since the University is sur-
rounded by mountains, rivers
and forests of which it presently
makes minimal use.

The organizational structure
detailed in the proposal calls for
the establishment of various
clubs—canoeing, hiking, etc.,
all of which would be under the
auspices of an executive board
headed by a Program Director.

Each club, in turn, would
have its own president, vice
president and_ secretary-
treasurer. The president of
each club would serve on the ex-
ecutive board, meeting regular-
ly with the Program Director.

chosen not to attend Wednesday parties and even weekend parties.
And I’m not exceptional in this respect. Hardly.

We have few enough choices as it is once we hit Big Lex. I’m not
knocking Lexington but it is a fact that there’s not a great deal to do
in town or near by.

But all colleges aren’t located in the idyllic Shenandoah valley, as
cut off as we are from so much. Some of the greatest universities
this country are located in great cities like New York, Chicago,
Boston, and Philadelphia which boast a whole lot more distractions
than weeknight bands in the Cockpit.

If the people who want to ban weeknight bands in the Cockpit
were at an urban college they’d be digging moats, buying elec-
trified barbed wire and happily drawing straws for bed check duty.

No, banning bands isn’t the answer. Outlawing weeknight parties
is like putting make-up over measles and calling it a cure. You take
away a guy’s party and you've done nothing about his opinion that
partying is more important than booking.

(And hey — who knows — just maybe this fellow bagged his
Wednesday afternoon tennis game to spend the time doing Wednes-
day night’s work ahead of time...stranger things have happened. )

Like I was saying — the band banners are attacking symptoms
without addressing causes. If the real problem here is academics
(and that is the only legitimate problem) the solution should be
sought in the classroom.

If the problem is poor student performance, there is a solution to
that. Poor students get poor grades. And habitual poor grades have
a whole string of weighty consequences.

But if a student can come to class hung over once or twice a week
and still do well enough on papers and tests to get a good grade,
that’s the professor’s problem, not the student’s. (In “real life’’ an
obligation met is an obligation met, )

And a professor has a real problem when he starts juggling
course requirements to dictate student behavior. (Yes, I’m talking

ber

about Thursday morning quizzes and Wednesday before
Thanksgiving tests. )

If the function of a course requirement has more to do with polic-
ing student behavior than it does to the material of the course, then
it is nothing more than an elaborate game.

Due dates on course work should be determined by the content of
the course, not the social schedule of the student body.

The point here is choice. It seems to me that good academic work
is far more valuable, far richer when it is done by choice rather
than because there’s nothing else to do.

And the job of the teacher in the scheme of things? That’s easy.
The good teacher doesn’t_ban bands or threaten students away
from parties. He simply presents what he’s selling as a more
desirable way to spend an evening than getting drowned in stale
beer and staler tunes.

And really, that shouldn’t be all that difficult, People have been
reading Shakespeare for close to 400 years. I doubt that the Drifters
will prove to have such staying power.

program for all members.

Each club would be encourag-
ed to have instruction, films and
demonstrations pertinent to
their respective fields. The
University itself would be
responsible for providing ade-
quate storage and repair space
for necessary equipment.

The proposal estimates that
initial funding for the Outing
Program should be in the
neighborhood of $2,500, which
would come either from
membership dues or from the
Executive Committee.

Honored

medal for the Tampa, Florida
native, honored for his contribu-
tions to the Marshall Awards
conference.

He was cited for his conscien-
tious and selfless efforts in or-
chestrating the schedules and
transportation of the nearly 300
cadet delegates to the 4-day
conference, and then arranging
their safe return to their col-
leges and homes — a challeng-
ing task.

Brigadier General (P) Daniel
W. French, the Deputy Chief of
Staff for ROTC of the Training
and Doctrine Command,
presented the award, commen-
ting upon Major Singleton’s
remarkable efforts to insure
that the visiting cadets profited
from the Conference to the ut-
most.

Also present at the ceremony
were the Major’s wife, Han-
nelore, his son, Donald, and the
Washington and Lee Professor
of Military Science, Lt. Colonel

Thomas B. Vaughn, who
remarked on the occasion,
“Jim truly deserves this
recognition.

“As my principal assistant
for coordinating the myriad
details of our responsibilities
for the Conference, he worked
‘above and beyond the call of
duty’ to assure the scheduling
and transportation -re-
quirements were properly met.

‘He literally worked day and
night; thus, the recognition is
timely and fitting.”’

A veteran of 18 year’s
military service, Major
Singleton has served in his pre-
sent position at Washington and
Lee for three years and will con-
tinue there through ee of
1981.

Response To * Convention Thoughts”

by M. Gray Coleman

Well, here it is — the next-to-last issue of our venerable Phi, and
the ex-ed has managed to keep his trap shut all year. But after last
week’s bit of contemplation by my ole’ comrade in arms, P. Potter,
I figure one last gasp of exasperation by a voluntary five-year man
deserves another. In short, Parker, if you want someone to play
John to your Shana (or vice versa), never fear, because here |
come.

For those with short memories, a brief review of where we stand.
Last week, we saw a column, ironically entitled ‘‘Thoughts on the
Mock Convention.”’ A neatly-boxed item in two-column-wide type,
the piece refers to the platform session as a ‘‘90 proof farce,” con-
tinually — and with some personal asperity — argues against the
rigidly enforced necktie code, and all but accuses the Steering
Committee of making the decision to nominate Reagan all by
themselves, in smoke-filled splendor, in the 5th floor gym
classroom or some other exotic locale...It’s hard to decide where to
start when responding, there’s so many goose feathers flying
around.

Let’s start, just for fun, with the platform session complaints. In
some areas, I agree with Parker: it was too loud for some to hear
the debate. And for anyone to say that there wasn’t alcohol floating
around seems to me to be the quintessence of wishful thinking.

But I fail to see how you can hold the organizers of the event
‘directly responsible.”

First, I do not believe that people remain in places where they
are unable to follow the course of events. And I saw several hun-
dred students with platform booklets open — following the session
attentively. A quick look at Cable Nine’s videotape bears this out.
Parker should take a gander at it — it’s free. I would like to suggest
that the bulk of the noise Parker complains about was caused by
the mass exodus of alumni leaving Warner Center after the
speeches to attend their own booze-it-up affair with Lester Lanin.
In fact, many students are up in arms over what they perceive as
unforgivable rudeness on the part of hundreds of alums — guests,
not sponsors of the Convention, I might remind readers — many of
whom had to be asked to leave due to enormous noise in the spec-
tators’ areas and in the rear of the delegates’ seats. Others formed
a mini-mob for the purpose of getting autographs or a chat with an
understandably bewildered Barry Goldwater.

I am not saying that many students didn’t let the spirits fly (in all
senses of the word), but the blame is not to be found there. And for
alumni complaints, may I suggest you leave the Steering Commit-
tee out of it, and confer instead with the alumni association hon-
chos. (Indeed, it is my feeling that realizing they are no longer
bound by the rules of Student Control has left a large number of our
alumni a bit giddy...)

Last week’s editorialist also admits that his understanding of the
1976 convention was “‘incomplete.’’ How true, how true...Attentive
observers of the last convention and this one actually found the
platform debate to be the most active, intelligent — yes, even
stimulating — that they had seen in some time. Surprise! Approx-
imately 75-80% of the delegates remained in their seats for the en-
tire platform debate, casting votes as their own consciences guid-
ed. Again Cable Nine has the proof on film. More students spoke at
the podium than ever before — around fifty on platform night
alone. And if it was loud, I chalk it up to honest enthusiasm, not
merely to liquor. Most of our students share a Republican/conser-
vative outlook, and if they got loud or heated, I honestly believe that
it was because they felt there was a personal stake for each of them
in what was going to be touted as the platform of ‘‘The Student
Body.”’

Contrast that response with 1976, when the platform was more
liberal, Democratic—and, by the end of the session, only some
three hundred remained on the floor. You'd have loved it, Parker —
it was really quiet then — but I don’t think as many thoughtful
students came out feeling they’d learned something. And, no — it
wasn’t as much fun,

Now I probably shouldn’t get into the subject of ‘‘fun,’’ because
that’s what really makes the Mock Convention a ‘‘shameful fraud”’
in Parker’s view. Such elevated phrases ought to have a little fac-
tual material behind them, n’est-ce pas? Regretfully, they don’t.

I cannot believe that Parker has ever witnessed a single instant
of any real political convention in person or on the tube. If so, he
would have realized how the Mock Convention fails to mirror the
genuine article. And these are the only ways. If it were the real
thing, and say you were a delegate, chances are you wouldn’t have
heard anything from the podium at all...Any chance for pre-
convention involvement or getting in on the organizational side
would be near to impossible. (You'd be surprised how many people
took that ‘‘90 proof’ platform seriously at the open hearings in Lee
Chapel — that is, if you’d attended.) And, at the risk of being flip-
pant, let me suggest that delegates sneaking booze into real con-
ventions is probably the rule.

I really loved the nonsense last week about Rule 16-B. Dispensing
with this procedural rule for the vice-presidential nominating pro-
cess is quite acceptable — and could only be seen as a devious trick
by someone looking pretty hard (and not too accurately) to find
fault with the process.

And now, to the matter of student participation. It is agonizingly
true that the average delegate has very little input into the
presidential balloting. But do you honestly believe that the legally-
bound delegates in Detroit this summer will have any more say-so?
And, although the Steering Committee probably appreciates the
compliment, it would be unfair to suggest that the 18 members of
that group made all the plans, did all the research, etc.

It would be impossible to calculate how many hundreds—yes,
hundreds—of state chairmen, research coordinators, facilities peo-
ple, Journal writers, float coordinators, fund-raisers and platform
speakers all together joined forces to pull out the victory that was
the Mock Convention. And anybody who was interested in the
political decision-making angle of it was always welcome to climb
one short flight of stairs to the MC office and offer a little help in
place of after-the-fact criticism of verbal sniping.

Readers may remember that two things Parker did not accuse
the committee of were fiscal irresponsibility or unfair appoint-
ments to committees. And these two evils...There were none, in
fact, and I can think of no better proof than his omission of said
topics. Because if there had been — sweet Jesus, how we would
have heard about it in his column!

In short, Parker seems most disgruntled by the fact that there
isn’t more political uncertainty, that the shots are often called by
the regional coordinators and their political researchers, that a
state chairman cannot cast all his presidential votes for the
manager of the A.B.C. store. Well, that’s just how it is in the real
world, and that’s all that the Mock Convention has ever attempted
to mirror. If he still has complaints, let him take them to the Com-
mittee on Procedure this summer in Detroit.

But to lay such abuse upon a committee that has conscientiously
tried to reflect the American political process is simply un-
forgivable. Although I have usually had the greatest respect for the
logic and organization behind Parker Potter’s judgments (and will
continue to do so), I am equally certain that I’m not the only one

blushing for him over his awesome lack of understanding on this
one.

103 Law Degrees

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity awarded law degrees to 103
men and women Sunday, and in
his commencement - address,
President Huntley cautioned
them to be conscious of the
urgent need to strike a balance
between the extremes of view-
ing the system of laws as a
machine, on the one hand, and
giving in wholly to emotion and
instinct, on the other.

The law ceremony took place
in Lee Chapel, instead of on the
front lawn because of intermit-
tent showers throughout the
day.

President Huntley told the
graduates and the standing-
room-only audience of families
and friends: ‘“The most impor-
tant thing lawyers do is think.
Lawyers are paid to think,
because they seem to be better
at thinking than most others
are. They are expected to be
able to think effectively about
almost any subject and not just
about purely legal matters, if
indeed there are any purely
legal matters...

“The very best lawyer,’’ he
said,”’ is one who lives the life of
the mind in a practical world
—a life of reason,”’

He noted the 19th-century
Scottish philosopher Thomas
Carlyle’s attack on
mechanism: ‘‘‘All is by rule and
calculated contrivance,’ and
literature, religion, the arts,

and even government become
corrupted by a neglect ot the
‘moral, religious and spiritual
condition of people.’”’

Huntley warned .the new
lawyers ‘‘the kind of
Mechanistic thinking Carlyle
attacks is one of the gravest
risks to be encountered in the
process of ‘thinking like a
lawyer.!”’

But the other extreme,
Huntley said — “to replace
(Mechanism) with a reverence
for emotion and instinct’ — is
likely to lead to just as severe a
deterioration of the fabric of
society. The ‘‘cults’’ that pro-
liferated in recent years
“provide adequate examples,”’
he said, of excess in ‘reaction
against the intellect, reaction
against the life of reason.”’

Huntley told the law
graduates their challenge must
be ‘‘to continue to sharpen those
disciplines of thought to which
your legal education has at
least introduced you...

“It is perilously dangerous
—and dehumanizing,’’ he said,
‘‘to allow the intellect to avoid
confrontation with the profound
values that give meaning to life.

‘Tf there is no reason, no
possibility of truth, no justice
—then law is reduced to an ab-
surd effort, ‘full,’ in Macbeth’s
phrase, ‘of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.’”’

EC Discusses Honor

by John Billmyre
The Executive Committee

ii held its final meeting of the

year Monday night and the ma-

| jor topic of discussion was the

Honor System.

“Law School students in
general don’t take the honor
system seriously,’ said First
Year Law Representative Sam
Allen.

He said that first-year law
students do not learn about the
honor system during orienta-
tion.

‘‘Neal Brickman was suppos-
ed to tell us about the honor
system during orientation, and
he told us not to worry about the
honor system,”’ Allen said.

Brickman was a represen-
tative for the first-year law
students last year, after the
original law _ representative
resigned.

Allen’s comments followed
the EC’s report on honor trials
and investigations during the
year.

EC President Steve Abraham
announced that there were 33
investigations into possible
honor violations this year which

Code

resulted in 15 honor hearings.

Three students withdrew
upon being informed of their
honor hearing.

Another three students were
convicted of honor violations
and two students went public
with their honor hearings.

And 12 students who had
honor trials were acquitted.

Abraham said some cases
may have involved more than
one student and that the figures
are still subject to change. The
EC met in Executive Session

after the regular meeting. Ex-
ecutive Sessions are held in
order to discuss matters of
honor. ;

The three-year EC member
and present EC president also
praised this year’s EC in his
closing comments for the year.

‘It has been an honor for me
to serve on this committee and
this is the best EC that I have
seen in three years,” said
Abraham.

Drunk Driving

by W. Cope Moyers and John G. Billmyre

It is late Saturday night and you know you’ve
had one too many beers. Unfortunately, so does
the cop who just pulled your car over.

It is not hard for a police officer on patrol to spot
a drunk driver, according to Virginia State
Trooper J. L. Hines.

‘We always look for the probably cause, such as
weaving and excessive speed,’’ said Hines.

“But sometimes we don’t know we have one un-
til he’s stopped,’’ Hines added.

Once you become one of the unlucky ones pulled
over Hines said his next step is to actually deter-
mine how drunk you really are. .

As you step from the car, the police officer will
make mental notes of the condition of your eyes,
how you get out of the car and what you smell like.

If the officer has reason to believe you’ve done a
little too much partying, he will next give you the
‘‘Roadside Test’.

You are asked to breath into a balloon attached
to a glass vial filled with chemicals. The more
you’ve had to drink, the greener the chemicals will
turn.

‘The test aids the officer in determining to what
extent the subject has been drinking,’’ Hines said.

If you refuse to submit to the test, the fact can-
not be used in court, according to Hines.

But there are several other ‘‘on the spot”’ tests
the officer can administer.

You may be asked to walk a straight line or

touch your nose, actions that are difficult when
you've had too much to drink.

By this time, the officer has established you
have had just a little too much to drink and places
you under arrest. :

Next it’s off to the police station, where things
get complicated.

On the way to the station, the officer is required
to inform you of your rights and of the “Implied
Consent Law.”

This law states that by the mere act of driving in
Virginia, you are automatically required to take a
brethalyzer or blood test, tests that don’t lie.

Either test must be administered by a certified
person, sometimes another police officer but
usually the local magistrate. The blood test can
only be given at the hospital.

And you can’t give the tests to yourself; it takes
four hours of intensive studying before one is cer-
tified.

You can refuse to take either test and a lot of
people do in fact say no when it’s time for the test.
But if you do, be prepared to suffer the conse-
quences.

Not only are you charged with driving under the
influence, but you also pick-up a failure to take a
blood or bretherlyzer test charge. The charge car-
ries a fine and 90 day suspension of your drivers
license. (see side bar )

World Premier Of —

 

Ramdoolal Dey March

One of the most unusual
events of the weekend at
Washington and Lee, or
perhaps of the decade, was the
world premiere of the ‘“‘Ram-
doolal Dey March’ — an
original composition by Dennis
Burnside, a professional com-
poser, conductor and arranger,
written in honor of the 19th-
century owner of the George

Washington portrait was.
presented to W&L last weekend.

The ‘‘Ramdoolal Dey March”’
was featured in a 15-minute
multi-media presentation
shown Friday night to the W&L
board of trustees and special
guests of honor who were on
hand for the dedication of the
university’s $9-million
undergraduate library and the
simultaneous presentation of
the circa-1796 portrait of
Washington.

Burnside is affiliated with
Odyssey. Productions in
Nashville, and his recent
credits range from ‘Macho
Duck,”’ a disco Donald Duck

recording from Disney Studios,
through country-and-western
music, to the new recording of
Aaron Copland’s ‘‘Appalachian
Suite’’ released by National
Geographic, for which Burnside
was orchestra conductor.

The music and_ technical
work, including productions of

_the “Ramdoolal Dey March”

and a series of variations on the
familiar ‘‘Washington and Lee
Swing’’ in the styles of the 18th
and 19th centuries also arrang-
ed by Burnside, are a gift to
W&L from Odyssey through
Paul Whitehead, a partner in
the studio who himself produc-
ed the new W&L musical ex-
travaganza.

Whitehead is the son of W&L’s
board secretary, James W.
Whitehead, and Mrs.
Whitehead.

In addition to his board
responsibilities, James
Whitehead is also the curator of
W&L’s art collections, to which
the Ramdoolal Dey portrait of
Washington has now been add-
ed.

English Dept Selects
Mahan Award Winners

by John Wells

The English Department has
announced four recipients of the
Mahan Awards in Creative
Writing for this year. The
poetry prize was given to Jack
Sharman, and three fiction
prizes were awarded to Steve
McCabe, Palmore Clarke and
James Leva.

Among the oldest continuous
student prizes awarded annual-
ly, the Mahan awards were
established under the will of
George A. Mahan of Hannibal,
Missouri, a ‘‘Lee student,’’ who
died in 1936.

There are four awards of $150
each for prose entries from
freshmen, sophomores, juniors
and seniors and one prize of $200
for a poetry entry from an
undergraduate. The awards
will be officially announced dur-
ing the commencement pro-
gram on June 5.

All entries must ascribe to a
strict set of guidelines handed
down by the English Depart-
ment. Limits are placed on the
number of entries made and no
student may win a class award
and a verse award in the same
year.

In announcing the winners,
the judging committee com-

mented on the work of the in-
dividual recipients.

Of Jack Sharman, who won
the poetry prize: “‘Abstract and
moving, Sharman’s poetry
brings together images from
earlier lines into quiet resolu-
tions in which the words have
almost physical weight and
presence. In The Aching Rib,
his prize-winning sequence of
three . poems, Sharman lifts
hedonism into plangent rhap-
sody.”’

Of Steve McCabe, a fiction
winner: ‘‘McCabe’s prose in
‘The Praying Mantis’ and ‘The
Angelus’ is carefully wrought
and slow with the small in-
crements and shifts in con-
sciousness by which the mind
comes to know the world, mo-
ment by moment. The effect is
calming. McCabe has a rare
ability to make small, slow ef-
fects feel large, timeless and
complete.’’

Of Palmore Clarke, a fiction
winner: ‘Clarke experiments
with stream of consciousness
techniques to generate a
coherent interior monologue, an
undifferentiated and
understated mental narrative
convincingly punctuated by the

Winstanley which has noe been
given to W&L by the Warner
Foundation.

The painting was eventually
sold to another Indian by Ram-
doolal’s grandson, and it re-
mained in Calcutta until 1963,
when it was purchased by a
Czech-born American, Erick
Kauders of Marblehead, Mass.

The Warner Foundation pur-
chased it this spring specifical-
ly for Washington and Lee.

The portrait joins two other
important early works of
George Washington art in
W&L’s collections that are of
exceptional value -— Charles
Willson Peale’s priceless 1772
portrait of Washington in the
uniform of a colonel in the
Virginia militia, the first pain-
ting ever made of Washington
from life, and an_ original
Gilbert Stuart portrait in his
famed Athanaeum style.

Cornett
Replaces

Coleman

P. Craig Cornett, who will
receive his B.A. degree this
week from Washington and Lee
University with majors both in
politics and in economics, will
join the university administra-
tion for a year as assistant
director of publications and
assistant director of the news
office.

Cornett was co-chairman of
the Washington and Lee student
body’s Mock Republican Con-
vention last month and is one of
17 Fellows of the Center for the
Study of the Presidency. He was
elected to membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional campus leadership socie-
ty, in his junior year and is vice
president of the founding
chapter of ODK this year. He is
one of two student represen-
tatives on the Faculty Commit-
tee on Courses and Degrees.

He joins the university ad-
ministration under a program
that brings a new graduate into
the publications and news
operations for a year at a time
in order to bring that particular
perspective to W&L’s com-
munications activities.

Cornett will be a regular con-

Although it is against the law to refuse a blood or
breathalyzer test in Virginia, the chances of ever
being found guilty of non-compliance appear to be
slim.

By agreeing to enroll in the Alcohol Safety Ac-
tion Program, Rockbridge County District Court
Judge Joseph E. Hess will often reduce the drunk
driving charge to reckless driving, and dismiss
the failure to take the test charge.

As a result, the defendant pays a smaller fine
than the one imposed if a person were found guilty
of driving under the influence. The lesser charge
also means the operators license is not revoked.

The Alcohol Safety Action Program in
Rockbridge County is the only one of its kind in
rural Virginia. When the Virginia program was
begun in 1975 in Fairfax, it was intended for areas
with 50,000 people or more. Since Rockbridge
County only has 32,000 people, it was not eligible
for the program.

In 1977, however, a ‘‘test’’ program was in-
itiated in Buena Vista and the number of those ar-
rested a second time for DUI after completion of
the course is low.

‘For the 1978 classes, we had 261 people and of
these there have been only five who were arrested
again for DUI,” said Dr. Robert P. Varley, direc-
tor of the Rockbridge County ASAP program.

Varley said the Governor’s Report of 1979 in-
dicates this county has one of the highest rates of
alcoholism in the southwest area of Virginia.

Buena Vista and Lexington rate 10 and 11 as the
communities with the greatest percentage of

_ alcoholism and third and fourth in percentage of

mortaility rates from alcohol abuse, said Varley.

The rural population presents unusual dif-
ficulties for the four-man staff.

“Very often, about 20 percent of the class cannot
read or write,’’ said Varley.

“Since some of the people are illiterate, we try
to use films and discussion in the classroom,” he
added.

Varley also said there are usually three or four
W&L and VMI students in each class of 20, making
it necessary to alter some classes.

During the last class, three W&L students were
given private showing of a scheduled film because
they wanted to go home for Spring Break, accor-
ding to Varley.

Although the program is successful, Varley said
Lexington has not thrown its entire support behind
the project.

“According to the next Lexington budget, the
ABC store will be giving $31,000 in revenue to the
City of Lexington,”’ Varley said.

“If they are going to get money from the people
who cause alcoholism, they should turn some of
that money over to us,’’ he added.

City Councilman Larry Mann, contacted at his
office, said he was not sure why the ASAP pro-
gram was not getting more money from the city,
but added that Varley had an opportunity to go to
the council and request more money.

Mann added that he does not remember Varley
reappearing before the council giving reason why
ASAP should receive more money from Lex-
ington.

Mann told a Phi reporter that he is more than
willing to listen to requests from the ASAP pro-
gram.

(Though the budget is not yet final, of the $1,000

Rockbridge County’s Alcohol Program

the ASAP program requested Lexington plans to.

allocate $250. Buena Vista is planning to give the. .

program $5,000).

According to Varley, the Lexington Police
Department does not give enough cooperation to
the ASAP program.

“Chief Kirby thinks alcoholism is the result of
not enough willpower. Willpower doesn’t work
with a disease and alcoholism is a disease,’’ said
Varley.

“It’s a difference in perception,’ he added.

In a telephone interview, Chief Kirby said he
does believe alcoholism is the result of not enough
willpower, but flatly disagreed with Varley’s
statement that he has not cooperated with the
ASAP program.

Kirby says he cooperates with ASAP and says
he thinks it is a good thing to give a man a chance
to rehabilitate himself.

‘“‘We’ve had pretty good results with the ASAP
program,” Kirby said, though he noted they have
had a few repeaters.

Varley credited area courts and especially
Judge Joseph Hess with helping fulfill the pro-
gram’s goals.

‘The most important thing to remember is that
we are not attempting to penalize the individual
—just trying to rehabilitate him,’’ Varley said.

man team in Mr. Mollenhoff’s investigative jour-
nalism class. By Steel, Bruce Vale, Cope Moyers,

Drunk Driving

(continued from page 1)
of how much the subject has had to drink in the
last couple of hours,’’ Hines said.

In Virginia, if the tests indicate .10 level of
alcohol in your_body there is no way you can tell
the judge you weren’t drinking much. In fact, if
you do have that much alcohol in you the law says
you are presumed intoxicated.”

If the test indicate levels between .09 and .05,
there is no presumption of intoxication. And if
you're lucky enough to have less than .05 of alcohol
in your body, the law says there is ‘‘presumption
of no intoxication.”

If you are drunk, it is up to the magistrate as to
whether you'll be staying in jail for a while.

If he feels you are intoxicated, it is the
magistrate’s responsibility to hold you for at least
four hours.

“If. the subject isn’t legally drunk, the
magistrate can be a little more lenient,’’ Trooper
Hines said.

Once you dry out a little, you just don’t leave.
You aren’t going anywhere until the magistrate
sets bond.

In the case of Washington and Lee students, a
surety or personnal recognizance bond will pro-
bably be set.

A surety bond releases you into the custody of
someone else, usually a person of authority. The
indicidual accepts the responsibility you'll show
up for your court date.

A personnal recognizance bond releases you into
the custody of yourself. In other words, the
magistrate trusts you’ll be around when it comes

time for you to face the judge.

Two other types of bonds exist and there is no
guarantee you won't have one of them imposed
upon you.

A cash bond can be set, requiring you to post bet-
ween $250 and $350 before you can be released.

A property bond is usually double what the cash
bond would be and is set depending on the proper-
ty owned by the accused. If you fail to appear for
trial, a lien is placed on the real estate.

Before you finally leave the jail, the magistrate
informs you of the court date and reminds you that
should you fail to appear, you not only forfeit the
bond but send the police out looking for you.

Before the trial, get yourself a lawyer. In
researching past DUI cases, it was determined
that lawyers ensure you'll get a break. More than
half of all drunk driving cases in Rockbridge
County are defended by lawyers. While the
lawyers most unlikely cannot clear you of the
charges, they usually offer important advice and
get the charges reduced.

Bernard J. Natkin and Shuler Kizer handle most
of the drunk driving cases in the county.

If you are a first time offender, things aren’t too
bad.

In fact, you’ll probably have the DUI charge
reduced to reckless driving, provided you agree to
attend the Alcohol Safety Action Program.

The 14-week course costs $200. If and when you
complete the course, the judge is notified and finds
you guilty of the reduced charge of reckless driv-
ing. The fine is $120.

Professor Profile Series

by Parker Potter

John McDaniel is probably
best known for his work with the
Liberty Hall Archeological Pro-
ject. But McDaniel’s impact on
Washington and Lee began
much before the first spadeful
of dirt was moved at Liberty
Hall in 1974.

McDaniel is a 1964 graduate
of W&L. At W&L he was an all
conference quarterback on the
football team and an all-
American midfielder on the
lacrosse team. He was voted
most valuable athelete his
senior year.

Not simply a jock, McDaniel,
a sociology major and biology
minor, was a solid academic
performer. His work in an-
thropology under Dr. James
Leyburn was good enough to
land him in the Ph.D. program
at the University of Penn-

sylvania, one of the top
graduate schools of an-
thropology in the country.

And somehwere or other
McDaniel found the time to par-
ticipate in ROTC. In_ short
McDaniel has fully participated
in the W&L experience from
both sides of the fence.

After graduating W&L in 1964

he went to Penn, earning his
M.A. in 1969. He spent 1968 and

1969 in Peru doing his Ph.D.
research in physical an-

thropology. 1970 and 1971 were
spent as a captain in the Army
and in 1972, the year he return-
ed to W&L McDaniel received
his Ph.D. from Penn.

Asked why he returned to
W&L to teach McDaniel cited
three reasons. ‘‘Leyburn had a
major influence...there were a
lot of people on the faculty I
respected.”’

As well,’ the Penn experience
had a lot to do with it. I became
disenchanted with major
research oriented institutions
where people were interested
exclusively in research, where
students were taught by
graduate assistants. That ex-
perience made what W&L of-
fers even more impressive.”’

Finally, ‘“‘there are other
small institutions which do the
same thing (academically as
W&L), but here I saw a sensible
approach to atheletics, none of
the professionalism which one
sees even at many small
schools.”’

“One reason I chose to attend
W&L over Johns Hopkins as an
undergraduate was my fear
that at Hopkins I would be
nothing but a lacrosse player I
had no such fears about W&L.”’

Since returning to W&L
McDaniel has compiled an im-
pressive record of achievement
in areas other than atheletic.
The Liberty Hall project, under
his direction, was not only a
laboratory for student ar-
cheologists but was and still is
an archeological site of
statewide and national impor-
tance.

The regional archaeological
office established at W&L in
1979 brings state wide recogni-
tion as well as significant fun-
ding to the school.

The State Commissioner of
Archeology at the time, William
Kelso, said that W&L was
awarded the office ‘‘becuase of
the job McDaniel is doing in
historical archeology.”

McDaniel is a recent reci-
pient of the Ring-tum Phi
award, his second since his
return to W&L in 1972. This
award was made in part for
‘this inspired teaching.’’
(McDaniel is, in fact, the only
faculty member to receive two
Ring-tum Phi awards).

About these recognitions
McDaniel says, “I’m very pro-
ud of the awards and the ex-
posure our archaeology has
achieved in the state, but
tremendous credit must be
given to the undergraduates
who have worked hand in hand
with me on our research.”’

“All of our research and
publications that have come
from it are the results of pro-
jects directly involving
undergraduate research.”

As a former player and coach
and now as a techer, McDaniel
has_ strong feelings about
athletics and academics should
dove-tail.

‘Athletics were a major part
of my undergraduate life. I am
convinced that intercollegiate
competition can represent a

valuable educational ex-
perience.”’

“IT am however deeply
disturbed by changes I

perceive. In many sports there
has been a tremendous increase
in both the recourses, personal
and other, allocated to the
sport, and in the time committ-
ment demanded of the stu-
dent/athelete.”’

Of the eleven football starters
is McDaniel’s senior year,” five
went to med school. three to law
school, one was first in his class
in a graduate program at MIT,
one is president of a bank in
Florida and one holds a Ph.D. in
Anthropology.

Further, ‘‘Our program
operated with a total of three
coaches...practice from four
o’clock ’till six o’clock...and
one one hour meeting a week.”’

“The immediate implication
of this confession is a modest in-
vestment might be that it pro-
duced a mediocre record. Our
record for my four years at
W&L was 30 wins, 4 losses and 1
tie. The two years we were in a
conference, we won it.

McDaniel and his teammates
“took tough courses and were
late to practice because of labs.

“TI am committed to the con-
cept that the football ex-
perience helped us in_ the
classroom. However, there was
a recognition that we had other
important things to do at
W&L...we needed time to do

_
Mula Dennis |

 

them...the concept of total im-
ersion in an atheletic program
was not a part of our
philosophy.”

“Recently I was appalled
when a student of mine told me
he was really disappointed he
couldn’t engage in a research
opportunity with us because of
an off season committment to a
sport.”

“Off season activity is becom-
ing a growing part of W&L
atheletes. I believe it, and other
insidious escalations in a com-
mittment to winning are a
threat to what has been one of
the most positive aspects of this
unique institution.’’

“The concept of liberal
education articulated so elo-
quently by Edgar Shannor of
U.Va. last weekend demands
that the student be exposed to
many realms of thought and ex-
perience.

“President Huntley, in his

- 1978 speech the ‘W&L Mission’

concurs, ‘first he (the student)
must have a significant learn-
ing experience. in each of the
several kinds of subjects which
make up the liberal arts cir-
riculum.’”’

Says McDaniel, ‘Off season
sports and the implicit, if not
explicit demand for total com-
mittment to a sport raises the
question of the ability of the
W&L athelete to undertake
tough and challenging locals
academically.”

“Perhaps more importantly,
total imersion in sports can
deny the student the opportuni-
ty to become involved in an
academic realm. Grade point is
not the critical index.”’

“The critical clue is the
number of students who become
excited, involved and commit-
ted to learning.”

“The gifted student athelete
may be able to maintain a 3.0
average, but if he has not had
the time to really get involved,
then 3.0 is a testimony to his in-
ate talent, not to what W&L has
done for him.”’

“If we do fail to mirror the
record of the 1963 football team
the tragedy of that loss will for
overshadow the fleeting glory of

McDaniel’s concerns go fr
beyond those of the stucent
athelete. He takes an active in-
terest in the intellectual health
of the institution.

“I am proud of this institu-
tion, but I am not complacent
about the future. Despite the in-
ane bumper stickers, W&L is
not the University of Virginia. It
is a fine small school that has an
opportunity to become even bet-
ter.”

“Tf all our problems, the most
critical is the attracting and
maintaining of good students. I
enjoy having great students and
I am encouraged by the in-
crease in the applicant pool.

However. I think we have a long
way to go in the realm of attrac-

ting superior students.”’

“The loss of gifted students is
particularly . frustrating. That
loss is no less than an institu-
tional tragedy.”’

“My admittedly biased sam-
ple indicates a lack of an in-
tellectual atmosphere and a
lack of student body diversity
as reasons for leaving.”’

“I favor co-education as a
step toward greater diversity.
In terms of fairness a qualified
girl should not be denied a place
at W&L.”

“T feel that being all male has
little to do with what makes
W&L unique. How many young
Ruth Parmley’s have we denied
the opportunity to attend W&L?

 

“The challenge of developing
a more fertile intellectual at-
mosphere at W&L is sobering.”

McDaniel suggests two
courses of action, an increased
support of undergraduate
research on a decreased institu-
tional acceptance of an overly
strong party orientation.

As for research, McDaniel
feels a need for programs ‘‘that
attract students to work during
the summer (though the R. E.
Lee Research program is a
wonderful start). I’d like to be
able to offer gifted students a
stipend that would make stay-
ing the summer something
other than an economic set-
back.

“Economic support in the
realm of equipment and
research tools would help at-
tract students to academic pur-
suits.”’

McDaniel also suggests the
creation of competition in the
area of student research with
modest awards and wide ex-
posure for the winners.

As well, he feels that there is
much that can be done to adver-
tise the academic opportunities
at W&L as professionally as the
atheletic programs do with
their award winning pamphlets.

McDaniel also suggests that
“alumni support could be
solicited for academically
oriented opportunities. My
students have worked with me
over vacations, however the
funding has all been from out-
side W&L.”’

Reeves Collection At
The Brandywine

More than 200 of the finest
pieces of porcelain made 150 to
200 years ago in China for ex-
port to the United States will be
on display beginning this
weekend at the Brandywine
River Museum in Chadds Ford,
Pa.

The historical pieces are from
the Reeves Collection of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty. They will form the major
loan exhibit during the Bran-
dywine’s annual four-day anti-
ques show beginning Friday,
(May 23) and will remain there
through Labor Day weekend.

The Brandywine, with an ex-
traordinary collection of pain-
tings by Andrew Wyeth and
Jamie Wyeth, is one of the na-
tion’s most distinguished art
museums, although it is one of
the newest.

The Reeves Collection exhibi-
tion will show in porcelain form
the artistic influences that
prevailed in the new nation — in
the form of the pieces and in
their decorations, which reflect
political, religious and aesthetic
themes and values. Almost all
the items on loan to the Bran-
dywine from the 2,000-piece col-
lection at W&L were made in
the last years of the 18th cen-
tury, when America began in-
ternational trade on its own in
1783, and the first quarter of the
19th century.

Euchlin D. and Louise Her-
reshoff Reeves donated their
porcelain collection, and other
works of art including almost

 

100 paintings Mrs. Reeves had
painted in the first quarter of
the century, to his alma mater,
Washington and Lee, in 1967.

Since then, the porcelain has
been exhibited through the
United States — partly under
the sponsorship of the Smithso-
nian Institution’s traveling ex-
hibits service during the na-
tional Bicentennial, and partly
under the university’s own
sponsorship in connection with
alumni groups in a_ large
number of cities.

In addition to more than 50
museums and galleries in
America, the Reeves Collection
returned:to its homeland in 1978
— to the Republic of China
(Taiwan) — prior to derecogni-
tion. It was, according to the
Chinese ambassador to the
United States, the first time the
Chinese people had ever had the
opportunity to see the historic
wares their ancestors fashioned
when porcelain-craft was a
principal industry.

In addition to the Reeves
porcelain, five of Mrs. Reeves’
brilliant paintings will be on
Inan to the Brandywine.

When the Reeveses made
their gift to Washington and
Lee, the paintings — which she
herself had hidden for 40 years
Were unknown. But when the
glass under which they were
framed was cleaned off, experts
were astonished at her artistic
talent and her bold, vigorous
use of color. Painting primarily

Louise Herreshoff, she had,
subsequent research showed,
been at the forefront of the
revolution in art in the first
years of the century. It remains
a mystery why she abruptly
stopped painting in 1927 and put
all her works into storage in her
home.

The national premiere exhibi-
tion of the paintings of Louise
Herreshoff, ‘‘An American Ar-
tist Discovered,” took place in
Washington’s Corcoran Gallery
of Arts in 1976 — on the centen-
nial of her birth. Since then, the
paintings have been on loan for
exhibitions in 23 museums and
galleries.

McDaniel Talks
About W&L

(continued from page 5)

McDaniel also cites the pro-
giams. where graduates are
kept on campus for a fifth year
as being valuable to both the
students themselves and the
community as a whole.

Also, ‘‘work study students
could be directed to many more

academie areas.” All of these -

are concrete ideas _ which
McDaniel feels will bolster the
intellectual life of the W&L
community.

His other area of concern was
parties. ‘‘An institution wide ef-
fort (should be made) to put
parties in perspective. It is high
time we gave up the party line
on parties — before our reputa-
tion is further damaged.”’

“If you think our party-hardy
reputation is cute, fine. I have
been told by extremely
knowledgable people that our
party school reputation has
kept us from getting certain
research funds.”’

Damaging as well, says
McDaniel, is the passive accep-
tance by the community of
abusive behavior resulting
from intoxication.

“The fact that someone did
something abusive in 1963 and
got away with it is unfortunate,
but it should not set a prece-

period.”

“Those of us who witness
such an event and complain
about what didn’t happen have
no one to blame but ourselves.”’

Though he can be outspoken
about the problems he sees at
W&L, John McDaniel is firmly
committed to the institution and
to the spirit of community he
sees as its centeral tradition.

W&L doesn’t attract teachers
through “‘high salaries, im-
mense research opportunities
or instant pristeige by associa-
tion.”’ Rather, the attraction is
a campus where ‘‘openness, ac-
cusability, and honesty
prevail.”’

To McDaniel W&L is a place
where ‘‘gentle manners go hand
in hand with a committment to
teaching.”’ The aggressiveness,
brashness, arrogance and con-
ceit that were so prevalent at
Penn simply were not a part of
the great teachers I had at
W&L.

‘We at W&L can be proud of a
tradition of successful careers
for our graduates.’’ McDaniel
would attribute that success ‘‘to
a tradition of teachers who en-
joy undergraduate teaching.”’

Sports Wrap Up

by Bill Whalen

As I sit before my typewriter
and bang out this column, I find
myself possessed with mixed
emotions. In some ways I am
happy that I won’t have to write
another story for several mon-
ths, but I am also sad that
another year of sports has pass-
ed by.

Like any other season, I
guess, the 1980 athletic year at
Washington & Lee had its ups
and downs. Naturally, some
sports were surprises while
others failed to live up to their
expectations.

Here are some of this years
highlights and low points:

—To begin with, the football
team suffered through another
losing year. Not since Lyndon
Johnson was President, the
Beatles were still together, and
gas was one-fifth of what it is to-
day, has W&L seen one of its
football teams finish in the
black. But don’t give up, help is
on the way.

—The W&L water polo team
established itself among the
Sport’s southern elite in 1980.
The Generals took on the best

teams in this area, beat them
all, and went to the NCAA Tour-
nament. Not bad for a sport
still relatively unnoticed around
here.

—The basketball team was on
its way to one of its best years in
1980, at least until some players
decided to perform their own
version of ‘‘Push, Push In the
Bush.”’ Despite the Boxwood in-
cident, the Generals were still
able to win another ODAC title.

—The lacrosse team has one
of the most confusing years
ever. Playing the role of the
underdog, the Generals ran
over the likes of Syracuse and
N.C. State. But once the
Generals got up in the polls, the
wins became harder. We’ll pro-
bably never know what went
wrong in the last three weeks of
the season, either.

But despite some nadirs,
there were also some
highlights. In fact, the highlight
of the 1980 athletic season oc-

curred at a time when no one
was paying any attention.

In case you haven’t heard, the
tennis team finished fourth in
the nation among Division III

teams. That’s right, fourth.
Even more impressive is the
fact that Stewart Jackson
managed to collect All-
American honors in both singles
and doubles play. In four years
at W&L, Jackson earned All-
American honors five times.

The reason that you may not
have heard about Jackson’s ac-
complishments is that they
came at a time when the W&L
community was more concern-
ed about the prospects of the
lacrosse team. This just proves
the point that the tennis team

will always have to play the se-

cond .banana among spring
sports as long as the lacrosse
team continues to play well.

That just about sums it all up
for 1080, but what does 1981 hold
in store? For one, the football
and baseball programs. are
bound to improve as better per-
sonnel arrives each season.
Also, this year’s success in
lacrosse may also induce a few
more high school stars to visit
Lexington.

EC Holds Final Meeting

(continued from page 1)

Before delivering his final
remarks, during the period
reserved for suggestions to next
year’s EC, Abraham recom-
mended a change in the way
honor violations are handled.

““Because of the increase in
workload in the honor system,
the EC might consider an honor
council,’’ Abraham said.

He mentioned that Vanderbilt
University runs a similar pro-
gram with 24 to 30 people sitting
on the council which deals ex-
clusively with honor violations.

In this model, the regular EC
would maintain its governing
powers over student organiza-
tions and let the Council handle
matters of honor.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole agreed with Abraham
and said the workload EC
members carry almost makes
it necessary to change the
system as it stands.

Les Cotter recommended that
next year’s EC pay close atten-
tion to the new organizations
such as the squash, racketball
and outing clubs.

Helping these organizations
out, Cotter said, will help the
students enjoy the university
more.

The EC also heard year-end
reports from the Mock Conven-
tion, The CALYS, the Ring-tum
Phi and the Student Activities
Board.

John Hamilton, Business
Manager of the CALYX,
reported that the yearbook is
going to make a profit of
$1,067.82.

Forty-five percent of the pro-
fit will be divided between
Hamilton and CALYX editor
John Cole.

The other 55 percent of the
profit will go to the Publications
Board reserve fund.

Hamilton told the EC that
yearbooks cost $17.95 a copy.
Last year the CALYX cost
$17.14 per copy.

The CALYX received 38 per-
cent of its budget from the EC
this year. The EC provided the
yearbook with 39 percent of its
budget last year.

Hamilton told the EC that the
yearbook made $1,000 from the
resale of senior pictures this
year and picked up extra money
by helping Southern Seminary
with its color deadline.

He added that shipping the
books was less expensive than
he thought it would be and that

the cover was less expensive
than he thought it was going to
be when the budget was made

up.

The Mock Conventio
reported it is still wrapping its
books up, but that things seem-
ed to be in order.

One of the Mock Convention
Chairmen, Sidney Simmons,
said the individual states were
to raise $10,000 and spend
$9,000.

Simmons was happy to report
that the states ended up raising
$12,000.

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Kevin McGowan
reported that the paper still has
$3,000 in accounts receivable.

McGowan attributed the
large sum in _ accounts
receivalbe to the Size of the
issues the Phi has published in
May.

He said he and Business
Manager-elect Trent Dickerson
will get out -to collect money
after the last issue of the paper
goes out.

The Student Activities Board
reported that it will have ap-
proximately $400 left in its ac-
count which it plans to give to

Something Nice
For A Change

No one can say that this has been an ordinary and
run of the mill year. We started out with new Rush
rules and surprisingly enough, had little trouble with
Lexington’s finest during Rush. The school has
witnessed several tragic deaths this year. Even
sports had a roller coaster year; the basketball team
lost several top players only to return and win the
ODAC tournament.

In the midst of all this, the Executive Committee
was plugging away, facing one of the largest case
loads in years. There were 33 honor investigations
this year, 15 hearings, 3 convictions and 2 public hear-
ings. While some would have claimed that the EC was
on a witch hunt, anyone who followed and watched
this year’s EC work knows otherwise.

Students at W&L were fortunate this year to have a
hard working, open EC. Two members, Senior
Representative Jay Blumberg and Secretary Cove
Geary, seem to typify the latest edition of the EC.
Geary did an outstanding job as Secretary—he had a
mountain of work to do each week, yet never missed
getting it all done on time. And few people have
represented their class, or the student body, as well
as Jay Blumberg.

The EC faced a difficult year, and came through
quite well. Some of the credit must be given to the
leadership and experience of Steve Abraham, but the
committee as a whole and individually has done a
solid job.

Dear Editor,

Ordinarily, letters to the
editor address an issue of cur-
rent significance or are in
response to an item run in the
paper. This letter fits neither
category. Nope. This one is
merely to correct an error of
omission in the 1980 CALYX.

Before I cite the error; I
would like to reprimand the per-
son responsible John Cole. As a
fellow journalism student and
classmate of Mr. Cole’s, I am
particularly crushed that he
should have such little regard
for a member of the “family.”
Mr. Cole’s mistake has cost him
the favor of this writer (I know
he is equally crushed).

Now for correction. The
following name and information
was excluded from the senior

 

index section of the recently
released yearbook for 1979-80:
CY NESBE BAHAKEL Jr.
Journalism—Dean’s list, two
terms—WLUR staff—Program
Director, _WLUR—President;
Society of Professional Jour-
nalists, Sigma Delta Chi—
Producer, ‘‘Southwest Chroni-
cle,” WBRA-TV—One year,
varsity soccer—Media. Coor-

' dinator, North Carolina Delega-

tion, Mock Convention—super
guy, always.

I urge all of you (members of
1980 especially) to tear this
“editorial’’ out of the Phi and
stick it in the back of your year-
book. Better yet, just put the
whole paper in the yearbook
cover as a token and keepsake
item. You’ll be glad you did.
Buddy Bahakel ’80

The Last Week

The departure of our cherubic little editor,
known affectionately as Mr. Sluggo, to the fields of
free enterprise has made me realize how few are
the days I have left at this fine institution.

Realizing that I’ll probably end up working in
Sears’ men’s department, I decided to look back
rather than forward. While others might face
bright futures, some of us might actually end up
seeing these past four years as the best ones of our
lives.

Therefore, recognizing my future existence as a
beer-swilling Babbitt, I figured that I should set
out to recapture a bit of my past. Grabbing enough
beer, weed and speed to keep my motor running, I
set out with some companions to make my last
week here my most memorable.

Monday — Obviously, we had to get in a road-
trip. So, with music pounding through our smoke-
filled portable coffin, we went careening down
America’s highways,

Luckily, we had few decisions to make as
Hollins was the only target in session at the time.
This was fortunate as I-81 provides probably one
of the best stretches of road for those experienced
in the exhilaration of drunk driving.

Well, after trashing a few apartments, embar-
rassing ourselves in public, and finding the
ugliest, most desperate females, we decided we
were bored.

Stuffing the beasts in the back, we decided to
play Mr. Whimpy while getting some high speed
driving under our belts. Mr. Whimpy, for the
uneducated, consists of non-stop b-hits until either
all members pass out or are willing to admit that
they are whimpies and, thus, devoid of manhood.

Tuesday — We woke up on a golf course
somewhere in West Virginia. The beasts were
gone, but we evidently had captured some
undergarments.

We decided to gear up, return to base, replenish
our suppies and play some all-day Monopoly.

Wednesday — About 3 a.m., halfway through
our 6th game, someone handed me a piece of
paper that I thought was a Frito. I don’t know
what happened, but I did have a dream in which I

met a love goddess who felt beer guts were sexy
and receding hairlines were a sign of virility.

Thursday — ???

Friday — I became aware that I was conscious
around 7 p.m., in the midst of some party. There
were a lot of orthodontized faces and all the
females had designers’ names on their tight-
fitting jeans. We were ina bar in D.C.

I couldn’t handle the fact that, except for the
change from Pappagallo’s to Halston and Calvin
Klein, there was no difference between this bar
and a W&L fraternity party. I asked for another
‘‘Frito’’ and decided we should once again head
back to base camp.

My companions became wary of me, however,
when I tried to accomplish this task by clicking
together three times what I took to be my ruby red
sneakers while chanting ‘I want to go home.’
Sorry, Scarecrow..

After a late night swim in the Wilbur Mills
Reflecting Pool, we pointed the deathmobile
southward.

Saturday — Having decided that everything we
had done before was ‘‘baby stuff,’’ we concluded it
was time to create some action. Unfortunately,
the tanks over at VMI wouldn’t start, so after a
quick drive through the Colonnade we headed for
the beach.

After being mistaken for a beachéd whale, I
decided that the world was too hostile and grabbed
a few, more ‘‘Fritos’’ and joined a game of Mr,
Whimpy played with a pistol and one bullet.

Sunday — After taking a friend to the hospital to
have his ear sewn back on (not a very good shot), I
knew it was time to crash. However, I was
dissuaded from passing out by a roommate who
was in the mood for some full contact golf. After
winning, . by virtue of a five-iron to his thorax,
however, I knew I was on the ropes.

Yet, I was pleased. I had condensed a four-year
career into one week of memories. Sure, my car
was beat up, and one guy had lost an ear, and we
did have a few tickets, and the news office is com-
plaining about our charging the whole thing to
them, but hey...it was all just in fun.

EC Questions Deposit

by John Billmyre

Student Activities Board Film
Co-Chairmen, Dan Weiss and
Jose Amorin, appeared before
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night to explain problems
they have had depositing, on
time, money from the SAB
movies.

Last week EC Vice President
Les Cotter recommended Weiss
and Amorin appear before the
EC because money from the
movie “Go Tell The Spartans”
was left in the computer center.

‘It has come to our attention
that in the past you hvae had
trouble depositing the movie
money on time,”’ said EC Presi-
dent Steve Abraham, Monday.

“The money was never lost,”’
said Weiss, ‘it was merely
misplaced.”’

Proceeds from ‘Go Tell The
Spartans’ were donated to the
MD Dance Marathon.

Weiss told the EC he original-
ly went to watch the movie on
the night he left the money in
the computer center.

The film co-chairman said
when he arrived there was no
one to show the movie and he
had to be the projectionist.

After the movie, Weiss said

- he went to work on an assign-

ment in the computer center.

Weiss said he left the com-
puter room after 30 minutes to
work at the radio station on
coverage of the dance
marathon.

Dash Coufal found the money
and turned it over to someone
who works on the computers,
who in turn gave the money to
Jay Hemby, Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon Co-
Chairman.

Weiss said he finally caught
up with the money when
another dance marathon

 

 

 

worker, Tripp Brower, had it.
According to the film co-
chairman, depositing the film
money has not been a problem.
‘The money has_ been
deposited the night of the movie
most of the time,” said Weiss.
SAB Co-Chairman David Har-
pole explained the SAB
members usually pick up the
money and deposit it.
. After discussing the film com-
mittee, the EC heard a report
from the SAB about its Fancy
Dress budget and expenditures

Stealing Is Surprisingly High On Campus

by David Greer

At a school that professes to exist under a
system of honor, stealing occurs frequently and
the culprits are not always the nebulous
“‘townies.’’ There is good reason to believe that
students are the thieves in too many cases.

The supply store, the book store, the dining hall
and the record store are all scenes of unexplained
disappearances of goods. The gym loses equip-
ment—as much as $2,000 per year, and at the radio
station, records disappear before they are aired.

“For a school that has an honor system, the
record stealing is uncalled for,” said Robert S. de
Maria, professor of journalism and general
manager of WLUR, the university’s radio station.

De Maria says he has found WLUR records for
sale around town. Albums sometimes disappear
and then reappear. But most are gone for good.

A recent inventory found that over 400 records
disappeared over a four-year period. De Maria
says most student radio stations do not lose
records as much as WLUR. He said when he was
at Syracuse University, where the radio station
had twice the staff and the students generally
weren’t as wealthy as W&L students, the number
of records stolen was about 25 percent of the
number missing here.

Al Stewart’s “Year of the Cat”’ disappeared 10
minutes after it arrived in the studio. The ‘‘No
Nukes”’ album was stolen over Christmas break
before it could be aired.

Of 100 “‘New World Music”’ records 40 were
stolen. The series consists of native American
music such as sea chanties and folk songs.

“The people that steal abuse not only the radio
station and not only the honor system; what
they’re doing is shafting the audience,”’ de Maria
said.

De Maria said there is no problem with equip-
ment being stolen, just records. Even when the
station drilled out records so that they required
special adapters, the adapters were stolen as well.

In the dining hall a couple of coats are stolen
from the lobby each week, according to Gerald J.
Darrell, director of university dining and food ser-
vices.

Darrell says he does not see outsiders in the din-
ing hall who might steal coats and does not suspect
the employees. He pointed out that last year a stu-
dent was expelled for stealing a coat from the din-
ing hall.

Darrell says he plans to lock up the coat room so
there is only one entrance to try to cut down on the
stealing.

In the Cockpit, over 70 beer mugs disappeared
last semester. Most of them were plastic and were
not broken during use.

The Co-op has trouble with students not paying
for their food, says Darrell. It’s easy to do, he
says, because of the informal system there. Most
students, when stopped at the door, claim they
“forgot”’ to pay.

Darrell says often the same students forget fre-
quently.

“It happens more often than it should,”’ he said.

Employees at the Supply Store say legal pads,
pens, and shirts are stolen. They suspect an old
jacket found in the corner suggests someone trad-
ed jackets while in the store.

The inventory at Christmas was short $50-$75.
The employees say they have seen some stealing
but could not prove the theft or catch the thief.

They say the stealing is done by students.

And it’s “students absolutely’ who steal from
the record store, according to the store’s
manager, Adeline Goldsten.

Goldsten suspects that most of the stealing oc-
curs while she is at lunch. She loses two or three
tapes a week and five to 10 records a month.

Last year there was a problem with records be-

EC Hears SAB

(continued from page 1)
for the year. Jay Blumberg, EC
ad hoc member to the SAB, had
praise for the SAB.

‘Leaving this incident aside
(the misplaced money), I think
films are doing a good job this
year, as I understand, better
than before,’’ said Blumberg.

The EC was pleased with the
SAB budget, EC Secretary Cove
Geary said, ‘I like it.”

Geary has been instrumental
in motions dealing with presen-
tations of budgets.

After a lengthy discussion,
the EC voted 7-3 to give the
Rugby team $300. One EC
member, Edmund Schenecker,
a rugby player, abstained.

Alex Richards, speaking for
the rugby team, originally ask-
ed for $864.55, which included
money for gasoline.

‘The EC cannot fairly pay the
Rugby Club for gas when it does
not pay other clubs for gas,”
said Senior Law Representative

, John Fraser.

Other EC members echoed
Fraser’s belief.

Following more discussion,
Jay Blumberg proposed a mo-
tion the EC give the club $300.

Richards argued for more
money, but several EC
members pointed out that the

_EC could not give him more
money.

“The fact that you spent your
money wisely in the fall does
not give us the right to give you
more money,”’ Fraser said.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole called the question and
the EC voted to give the rugby
club money.

Bob Willis, Junior Represen-
tative, suggested the Rugby
club get its entire budget in the
fall next year, so it does not
have to come back for money.

Business Manager of the
Ring-tum Phi, Kevin McGowan,

gave his report on the
newspaper.

He told the EC that the Phi is
$400 in the black.

New Image
For The

Palm Parlor

by Bruce Jones

Lexington’s student popula-
tion has found a refreshing ad-
dition to its somewhat limited
range of gastronomical refuges.
The Palm Parlor, known in the
past only as an ice cream, sand-
wich and beer shop, is now, ac-
cording to owner Doug Higgins,
“a full lunch and dinner
restaurant.”

An array of appealing innova-
tions demonstrate Higgins’
assertion that he ‘“‘is making a
thrust at the student market.”

A new menu features the
traditional sandwich and ice
cream dishes and a_ large
assortment of hot, hearty
meals. Roast beef, ‘‘cooked on
the premises, not brought in
from outside,’ and homemade
soup are the specialties.

W&L student and two-year
Palm Parlor employee Brian
Leschner explained that a
newly-installed stereo system
enhances the night atmosphere
with “something more than

juke-box music.’

Numerous ‘‘College Nites’’
provide I.D.-carrying college
students with half-price sand-
wiches and draft beer at
bargain prices during Thursday
evening Happy Hour (from 5 to
7 p.m.)

Friday evening brings an ex-
panded Happy Hour, with beer

Play Review

 

by Parker Potter

Stage productions are a
tricky thing. There must be
Muses involved, or magic, or
something. After last fall’s
stunning and brilliant Hamlet,
one would have thought that no
script was too difficult for the
University Theatre to handle.

I am sorry to report that the
magic which flashed about the
stage of Hamlet is sadly miss-
ing from Lee Kahn’s production
of Tennessee Williams’ The
Glass Menagerie.

Rather than a lack of magic,
though, there are several fairly
specific ways in which the play
breaks down.

The first of these breakdowns
is John Fort’s Tom Wingfield.
Fort just doesn’t have the voice
or the presence to do the
character properly.

Tom is nobody’s hero but
Fort’s slushy delivery makes
him far less sensitive and far
less astute than he is. There is a
lot of good stuff going on in the

lines that Fort is too uncomfor-
table to deliver with any sense
of pace and timing.

As a result, much of the
strength and richness of
Williams’ language and much
of Tom’s sensitivity and insight
are lost in the shuffle.

To Fort’s credit, there are
moments when he looks the
part. In several of his dealings
with Amanda we can see Tom
listening and feeling. Trouble
is—we just can’t hear Tom.

Katherine Reiche has vocal
problems as well, but her slight-
ly clipped delivery doesn’t bad-
ly mar an otherwise fairly solid
performance.

One of Reiche’s assets is her
ability to act her Laura while

‘AAmanda’s

  

her delivery bring meaning to
each and every syllable she ut-
ters, Nothing is lost.

Further, she brings a reality
to Amanda that I’ve not seen
before. Sure gentleman callers
and planters and carriage rides
and cotillions are remnants of a
by-gone age, faded flowers
pressed in the memory book
that is Amanda.

But they did serve a purpose.
All of the props and customs of
dream’ world
were/are ways of ordering,
making sense of a large and
ever more complicated real
world.

Amanda may be off in the
clouds, but Bland shows us how
a handful of old lace can be a
pretty practical thing if it can
be used to net a gentleman
caller—a chunk of security in
an insecure world.

But for all her practicality
woven of dreams, Amanda was
crossed up by chance, by
charm, by the illogic of her
telephone man in love with long
distance. Bland plays well the
scenes where the order and
logic of unreality and the
disorder and illogic of reality
came together in Amanda’s
memories of her husband.

And indeed it is illogic which
prevails—for better or for
worse. Personifying the caprice
of the outer world is Grant
Kunkowski’s Jim, the
gentleman caller.

Kunkowski’s_ slick, high-
energy portrayal makes «the
gentleman caller just the inex-
plicable, unharnassable intru-

sion from outside that Jim is
supposed to be.

More than just a well-polished
golden boy, though, Jim is,
underneath it all, sensitive and
thoughtful. Kunkowski’s ability
to change moods and to wax
thoughtful is the play’s way of
saying that life isn’t all order
and gentleman callers.

Life is the disorder from out-
side that may fall in love with
long distance—or may just as
easily show the way to break off
an unwanted horn and survive
in a world full of horses—none
of them thoroughbreds.

Another problem is the set.
The theater-in-the-round con-
cept might be okay, but I’m not
sure. The contrast between the
ordered little world of the
Wingfield’s apartment and the
dark urban impersonality of St.
Louis beyond is shown well by
surrounding the play with the
black brick of the boiler room.

But if the stage-in-the-round
concept is on target here, the
blocking is way off base. It often
semms as if the audience isn’t
taken into account. Perhaps the
necessity of different acting
areas simply conflicts with the
round stage concept. The acting
area just isn’t well used and the
audience suffers.

Finally, though, the greatest
sin of the set is the way it
hamstrings Laura. She is hobbl-
ed by its confined area. The
limited space Rieche is given to
work in doesn’t allow Laura’s
handicap to be absorbed into
any sort of representation of the
graceful otherness Laura

The Ring-tum Phi, February 7, 1980, Page 3

Entertainment

should possess.

In all, this is not a very
coherent or controlled produc-
tion. Even though much of what
Tom says is virtually lost, the
poetry of Williams’ language
and the compelling issues of the
play aren’t unsalvagable.

But this cast and this produc-
tion are too uneven to pull off
the tight ensemble work
necessary to make a success of
this play. Our attention is too
tightly focussed on the sparcely

populated small world of the
play to tolerate even a single
misstep. And, unfortunately,
there are several here.

And while I’m at it, I have two
gripes with the business end of
this production. The lack of
publicity posters on campus
was inconsiderate, and the
seating of spectators after the
start of the play (Monday
night), especially in a theater-
in-the-round, was_ incredibly

eae.

From the Pressbox

Where Are
The Fans?

by Bill Whalen

Ken Ries, W&L’s Sports Information Director,
hates to tell lies.

Unfortunately, every time he computes the atten-
dance at a W&L home athletic event, he must resort
to lying.

Here is the reason Ken Ries has to lie about
attendance—the truth is too embarassing to admit.
The fact is: W&L has one of the least impressive at-
tendance records of most campuses around the coun-
try.

At last Saturday’s basketball game, the announced
attendance was a little over 200. My own head count
was somewhere near 175-180. You can imagine the
noise a crowd of 180 people makes in a facility which
is designed to hold 2,500.

Lalso listened to WLUR’s broadcast of the Emory &
Henry game of January 29. There were fewer than 100
fans to support the basketball team.

But this situation is not unique to the basketball
team, either.

Look at the crowd at a W&L lacrosse game. The
average attendance is somewhere between 1,500-2,000
people. The problem is that about one-third of these
spectators will take off for parts unknown (probably
Zollman’s) at halftime.

Now just imagine, for a moment, that you are a
W&L lacrosse player. The game is tied at halftime
and you glance over at Wilson Bridge and see it pack-
ed with people leaving Wilson Field like rats from a
sinking ship.

It’s a sight that no one who goes to this school should
be proud of.

One also has to feel sorry for the football team
because they suffer the same problem. It’s personally
hard for me to forget last year’s Homecoming game
against Hampden-Sydney when, with the score 7-0 at
the half, almost half the crowd went rushing for the
gates.

The attendance situation is so bad that several
coaches will refuse to make comments. One coach
has even lamented that W&L could be ‘‘the Notre
Dame of the South”’ if it could only get some honest
support.

 

 

But any support will have to come from the
students, themselves. If Hampden-Sydney can fill up
their new gym for a game against us, then why can’t
we do the same?

For some unknown reason, W&L students don’t sup-
port their teams with the same intensity that other
schools do. After all, we’re talking about college
athletics, which are life-or-death situations on other
campuses. Right now, a little of that enthusiasm
could be sorely used on this campus.

So the next time you have nothing better to do, go to
a W&L athletic event. You just might find that you
can have a good time rooting your school on to vic-
tory. And if you like it that much, you can even stay
for the second half.

Defeat At Lynchburg
Drops Generals To 8-11

Team Shoots 35.6% In 77-59 Loss

LYNCHBURG—In a_ season
already stocked with plenty of
lowpoints, the Washington and
Lee varsity basketball team
reached absolute bottom here
on Tuesday night.

Shooting 31 percent from the
floor in the second half and only
35.6 percent for the entire
game, the Generals dropped a
77-59 decision to Lynchburg Col-
lege. W&L, now 3-4 in ODAC
and 8-11 overall, is all but
eliminated from the race for the
league title. Lynchburg is 4-2 in
the conference.

“The turning point in the
game was when we showed up,”’
said a disappointed Coach
Verne Canfield. ‘We didn’t play
more than three minutes of
good ball. Just why, I don’t
know.”

Once again, the Generals
started off the game well but
eventually fell into shooting
droughts which would foil any
possibility of a comeback. Led
by the steady ball-handling of
guard George Spears, the
Generals moved into early
leads of 17-14 and 23-20.

However, W&L could not
score a basket for the next two
minutes, while two baskets
each by Lynchburg’s Scott
Mann and Joe Flynn gave the
Hornets a 28-23 lead.

It was a lead they would
never give up.

Two free-throws by Tom Jef-
feries cut the lead back to three,
but five straight Lynchburg
points put the Hornets up by
eight.

R.J. Scagg’s short jumper cut
the lead to 33-27, but Lynchburg
again rattled off five points to
go up by 11, 38-27. Rob Smither-
man’s shot at the buzzer ended
the half at 38-29, Lynchburg.

The second half looked more
like a one-on-five game, with
Jefferies providing the only of-
fense for W&L. T.J., who led all
scorers with 20 points, scored 14
of his team’s 30 second half
points.

Clark New hit a pair of free-
throws and then a long jumper
to cut the deficit to 50-39. Spears
hit one of two free-throws and a
T.J. baseline move put the
Generals at the closest they
would come, 52-42, with 7:42 re-
maining in the game.

Then, everything started to
go wrong for W&L.

Generals went scoreless. Mean-
while, Lynchburg scored eight
straight points, mostly off lay-
ups and fast-breaks, to take a

commanding 60-42 lead. The
Generals closed to within 14
twice (both times thanks to
free-throws by Frank Eppes)
but could never come closer.

For W&L, only two player:
Spears and Jefferies, shot over
50 percent from the field. With
the exception of Spears and Jef-
feries, the Generals’ starting
five hit on only six of 23 shots.
The bench could provide no
relief, as the total of sex
reserves shot a collective two
for 13.

The difierence in the game
was depth--or lack of it. Four
reserves scored for the
Generals, totalling only 10
points. The Lynchburg bench
totalled 33 points, hitting on 50
percent of its shots,

The Generals had a hard time
with their fundamentals, too.

Many of Lynchburg’s baskets
came on either lay-ups or offen-
sive rebounds. Several other
times, the Generals did not keep
a man back and Lynchburg
would score easily on quick
outlet passes.

After the game, Canfield had
no praise for his team, saying
its performance ‘‘showed no
pride.”

What particularly upset Can-
field was the fact that his team
did not stick with the original
gameplan of running a spread
offense and maintaining a slow
tempo. ‘‘We worked on our at-
tack,” said the coach, ‘‘but we
simply did not execute.”’

‘‘So many of our problems are
mental,’’ said Canfield. ‘“‘We
haven’t played together too long
and when one or two individuals
break down, so does the rest of
the team.”’

Unfortunately for the
Generals, the schedule does
work in their favor. Tonight,
they travel to Emory and Henry
College to face a team they
defeated earlier, 66-50.

Following that, W&L has
ODAC games against Bridge-
water and Eastern Mennonite
and two non-conference games
against Salisbury State and
Randolph-Macon.

The Generals’ next home
game is this Saturday against
Salisbury State. Gametime is 8
p.m. in the Warner Center.

Last week the only action the
General’s wrestling team saw
was participating in the Pem-
broke Invitational Tournament.
Once again, those wrestlers
who have been consistent win-
ners, played an important role
in gaining points for the team.

Captain Ray Gross, who
finished second and last year’s
captain, Ed Rodgers, who
finished in third place, were the
only Generals to come away
with wins.

The eight teams in the tourna-
ment did not officially keep
team points. Therefore, no
school was named the overall
winner.

Grapplers Vie In

Pembroke Tourney

Gross lost in the 142-pound
tinal, 5-3, after being seeded
first and finished the day with a
2-1 record. Rodgers also had a
2-1 mark and won his consola-
tion match, 7-1, to pick up third.

The Generals have four dual
meets before the ODAC cham-
pionships in late February. Of}
the four matches, Head Coach
Gary Franke feels the team has
a good chance at winning
against Longwood College
(which is the team’s next oppo-
nent) and Davidson.

Of the others Franke feels
that, ‘‘At the moment George
Washington has better team
strength and James Madison
will be one of the best dual meet
teams we will face all year.”’

A Stroll Around The Board

by Mike Perry

Washington and Lee’s
seventy-fourth annual Fancy
Dress Weekend, one of the na-
tion’s premier’ college
weekends, is slated for Feb. 28,
29 and 30. Although the event
has changed a great deal
throughout its long history, its
charm and character is still
best represented at the Fancy
Dress Ball. In the old days, Fan-
cy Dress was a costume ball,
participants came attired in
elaborate costumes. Today, the
seventy-five keg gala affair still
retains much of its rich historic
charm.

Each Fancy Dress is perhaps
best remembered for the
elaborate decorations
employed to depict the selected
theme. This year should prove
to be no exception. The SAB has
been working diligently to
transform Early-Fielding Stu-
dent Center into a real life

recreation of the famous
Monopoly gameboard.
Utilizing the theme of

Monopoly, SAB officials have
strained their creative genius to
produce the kind of event that
W&L students have come to ex-
pect at Fancy Dress. SAB co-
chairman David Hapole claims
that this year’s extravaganza
‘‘has the potential to be the best
Fancy Dress ever.”’

by a searchlight, this year’s
Fancy Dress goer and his date

his admission ticket to the In-
come Tax office. Having passed
“Go,” Mr. F.D. collects $200,
(in W&L money) and procedes
around the Monopoly Board.
His first stop will be Park
Place, the center of this year’s
Ball, formerly Evans Dining
Hall. The Ballroom will be
decorated in blue and white,
Park Place’s colors and not
unknown to W&L, either. Trees,
streetlights and park benches
will be added to create a ‘‘park”’
scene, while a giant monopoly
board gazes down upon W&L
revelers enjoying the big band
sounds of Bob Crosby and his
Orchestra.

THE BOARDWALK
Leaving Park Place, Mr. F.D.
may elect to take a stroll along
the Boardwalk. The more
adventurous Fancy Dress goer
may elect to escort his date
‘under the Boardwalk,”’ to a

beach scene complete with:

lifeguard chairs, beach um-
brellas and fishnet. Rounding
out the scene and supplying
entertainment will be, who else
but Bill Pinkey and the Original
Drifters.

MARVIN’S GARDENS

Walking along a yellow color-
coded Oriental Avenue, lined
with colorful Japanese
lanterns, Mr. F.D. may procede
to Marvin Gardens. The trans-
formed Fairfax Lounge will
be decorated with trees, hang-
ing baskets and terre natural.

The garden effect will be
enhanced by the music of
Minas, a Brazillian jazz band.

RAILROAD
If Mr. F.D. needs to visit the
rest rooms at this point, he will
be happy to learn that Water
Works is located just around the

corner, near the Train Station.
The E.C. hallway will feature a
train complete with tunnel and
suitable sound effects.

JAIL
If Mr. F.D. gets out of line he
may find himself in Jail,

quarters. The Jail decor will
feature bars and metal cups
and include a mellow pro-
gressive jazz band.

STATE’S AVENUE

Mr. F.D. may elect at this
juncture to head upstairs to
State’s Avenue. Strolling down
State’s Avenue, Fancy Dress
goers will be sure to notice
posters representing all fifty
states.

CHANCE

Feeling lucky, Mr. F.D. may
venture into Chance; formerly
the T.V. Room, where he will be
entertained by Bob Dubac, a
comic-magician from Los
Angeles. Under the spell of Fan-
cy Dress, Mr. F.D. may venture
across the hall to visit two
pieces of prime Monopoly real
estate, Atlantic and Pacific,
formerly Rooms 112 and 113.
The transformed lots will
feature an arcade housing free
pinball machines, — slot
machines and other games of
chance.

Heading further down State’s
Avenue, Mr. F.D. will probably
welcome the opportunity to
duck into Room 114 for a chance
to rest his feet and catch a
variety of cartoons or film
shorts.

TICKET INFORMATION

Tickets are scheduled to go on
sale next Wednesday, Feb. 20,
at 12:00 in the Student Center.
The charge is $15.00. Grain cups
and souvenir posters have been
ordered in greater quantities
than last year in an attempt to
avoid shortages and will be
available Monday, Feb. 24:

Depression Didn’t Dampen Fancy Dress

by John Wells

January, 1930, was separated
from the stock market crash by
less than three months, and the
effects of the Great Depression
had not yet reached Lexington.
Huge ads in the Ring-tum Phi
urged students to smoke
Chesterfields, patronize Mc-
Crum’s and flock to see the cur-
rent picure at the New Theater,
Hot in Paris. While it is uncer-
tain (though doubtful) that the
advent of Hard Times
restricted leisure activities for
students in general, it does not
appear that any visible
economies were imposed upon
the Fancy Dress Ball of 1930, fif-
ty years ago.

On January 8th of that year,
the Ring-tum Phi reported in
headlines: “Fancy Dress Plans

Indicate That Affair Will Sur-
pass All’ and “Elaborate
Scheme is Prospect In
Transforming Doremus Gym-
nasium.”’ The projected theme
was “A Spanish Fiesta in Old
Valencia’ representing ‘“‘the
eveing prior to a_bullfight
climaxing the fiesta given by
the King and Queen in honor or
their heir to the throne.’’ Once
again in charge of the ‘famed
spectacle’”’ was W&L professor
C.E.L. Gill, also a 1922
graduate. Prof. Gill was famous
for staging elaborately
thematic balls and 1930 was no
exception. The newspaper
reported: ‘‘For the first time,
specially designed scenery will
be used in addition to the usual
decorations. Workmen have
been busy for the past month

constructing sets to be used in
the gymnasium.” Prof. Gill
reportedly gathered ideas and
materials for the dance from an
extended Spanish tour he had
taken the previous summer.

The paper rather stuffily an-
nounced: “Because of the gala
occasion, the decorations will
carry out a festive air.’’ The
gym was transformed into a
courtyard with buildings facing
an open square. Readers were
assured the dance would be
alive with color, using exten-
sively red, pink, yellow, blue,
green and lavendar.

By January Lith,
measurements had been taken
for the costumes. It was an-
nounced that Jean Goldkette’s
famous Victor recording or-
chestra had been secured to

supply the music. The group
boasted the fact that it was the:
original Casa Loma orchestra ’
which had its origins at the New
York cabaret of the same name.
Prior credits under the band’s
belt included the Great Yuletide
Ball in Brooklyn, Finals at
Princeton, and the National
Electric Railway Convention in
Atlantic City.

Fancy Dress weekend at that

‘time occurred during a brief

break between the first and se-
cond semesters, a period cram-
med with social events. The
Junior Prom was held the even-
ing prior to the ball. On January
3ist “‘dasants’’ were given at
SAE from 11:30 until 2:00 p.m.,
and at Alpha Tau Omega from

See 1930, p. 6
Page 6, The Ring-tum Phi, February 7, 1980

Fancy Dress 1930

2:30 until 5:00 p.m,, both ac-
companied by Jean Goldkette’s
famous Victor recording or-
chestra. That evening, follow-
ing the gala occasion itself,
W&L seniors were invited to a
hop at neighboring VMI (this is
an old newspaper). The next
day Phi Epsilon Pi offered the
Southern Collegians at a dance
from 9-12 a.m. which hard core
rug cutters could hit only after
attending a similar event at KA
from 3-5 that afternoon. Of the
latter event it was advertized:
“Locklayer’s Virginians, a col-
ored orchestra from Roanoke,
will furnish the syncopation.”’

‘PHANTASMORIA’

The ball itself went off
without a hitch, and the follow-
ing day the Ring-tum Phi pro-
claimed it ‘“‘One of the Most
Brilliant Affairs in the History
of the Ball.’’ The paper reported
that students and their dates
glided ‘‘amid a phantasmagoria
of color” (one at first wonders
how many survived that
ordeal). The reporter, who
wisely remained nameless, was

probably aided by Prof. Gill
when he went on to identify the
characters that the dancers’
costumes represented: ‘El
Cids, Don Juans of Austria,
Isabels, Matadors, toreadors,
picadors, and Don Juan
Tenorios’’ were joined by ‘“‘Gyp-
sies from Andalusia, Flamenco
dancers, Infanatas, Goyescas,

 

  

segovians, Jota dancers,”’ and
even ‘‘street-singing Penitents
from Holy Week in Seville.”’

TANGO

W. Van Gilbert, the student
who was in charge of the ac-
tivities, led the figure with his
date, Miss Bebe Saunders of
Athens, Alabama. (A
photograph of Miss Saunders,
slightly reminiscent of Zelda
Fitzgerald, adorned the front

page of the Ring-tum Phi.) The
highlight of the evening came, it
was reported, when “Miss
Mildred Peirce of Birmingham,
Ala., danced a tango with
Thomas Smith of Havana,
Cuba.”

It is doubltful that this year’s
Fancy Dress will be as
elaborately staged as it was fif-
ty years ago. Over the years the
nature of entertainment has
changed, from contemporary
tastes reflected by selection of
the Casa Loma band during the

Latin American craze of that
period, to the more traditional
sounds of the Lester Lanin
crowd. Whatever the theme is
this year, it is sincerely hoped
that newspaper accounts won’t
reach the level of pomposity as
recorded in 1930.”

Fancy Dress Ball

 

Crosby To Supply Swing

by Mark Kinniburg

Bob Crosby and his orchestra will be performing
as the major dance band in the Evans Dining Hall
this Fancy Dress. One does not need to tax the
memory too much to realize that Bob Crosby is the
younger brother of Bing Crosby, the great crooner
who passed away recently. Bob, like his brother,
also has had a very big stage career—from his
beginnings as an amateur singer in an orchestra
at 15 years of age to his famous shows of today.

Zany Career

Along with Bob’s long career, there are many
zany events which are recorded in his semi-
official biography of the same title. There was that
time when the orchestra played five introductions
in a row, and poor little Bob couldn’t even utter a
sound, Another slap-happy antic was when Bob
showed up an hour late to an audition with the An-
son Weeks Orchestra because he had forgotten his
suspenders. So, in front of all those listening, Bob
held up his pants while singing! How silly he must
have looked holding on for dear life to his pants!

There are many interludes in the career of Bob
Crosby where he can be found with the names of
the day. Bob was the first male vocalist in the
Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and. began his recor-
ding career with them on the Decca and
Brunswich labels. The ‘‘big break”’ for Bob Crosby
came in 1935 when Ben Pollack had decided to
leave his orchestra, and the musicians he had
fronted wanted to stay together as a band.
Needing a front man to be the personality of the
band, they contacted Bob to help them out.

Bob Crosby took the band on one-nighters across .

the country playing a peculiar blend of Dixieland
Jazz which became known as Dixieland Swing.
From this early 1936 tour of the United States also
came the now classic ‘‘South Rampart Street’’—
which surely brought down the house at the Lex-
ington Hotel in New York City. (Note: the Lex-
ington Hotel was to have few bands after Bob
Crosby’s because it was obliterated by lightning in
the Great Storm of 1937.)

From September 1936 on, Bob Crosby and his
Bobcats were the talk of the popular band set. The

competition between brother Bing began to sub-
side as Bob’s, not Bing’s, face was on the cover of
Downbeat Magazine. By 1938 he had been voted
the youngost Grade A bandleader of his time. In
1938, Downbeat named the Bob Crosby Orchestra
the Best All-American Jazz Band in the land.
Bob’s unequaled legacy likens surely his inherent
talent.

Not only did Bob Crosby win fame for himself
and the Bobcats, he helped many girl singers
become famous. In fact, Doris Day, Kay Starr and
Gloria De Haven are still stars today. Gradually,
the Bob Crosby Orchestra progressed to a weekly
radio show on NBC and subsequent record deals.
Getting more and more exposure to the American
people was no problem for the Bobcats, as they
were chosen for film roles by Paramount and
Republic. Entering films on his own, Bob Crosby
acted in the great MGM films. ‘‘The Singing
Sheriff’’ and “‘See Here Private Hargrove’ with
such fine actresses as Judy Canova and Joan
Davis. Requests for Bob as an actor were more
than rivaling his musical career, but both were
put on ice for World War II.

USO Entertainer

In May of 1944, Bob enlisted in the Marine Corps
to fight in the Fifth Marine Division combat unit.
He was quickly transferred to the Headquarters,
however, and ordered to form a whole show of
Marine entertainers. This Marine show was sent
to the combat areas where regular U.S.O. shows
weren’t allowed because of dangerous conditions.
He was honorably discharged from the Marine
Corps with a Lieutenant’s commission in
December 1946.

Bob Crosby is married to his wife of 42 years,
June, and together they have five children.
Besides this family connection, though, Bob main-
tains close ties with his music friends in the
business. As a closing quote, Bob relates, ‘My
Bobcats played it 15 years ago in a night club were
the lights were so dim we couldn’t read the
music...so what’s all the excitement about?” Well,
Bob, that’s rock ’n roll for you! !

Thursday Night

 

Pavillion Party

 

Pavillion Bands

Brice Street And Fat Ammon’s

by Robin Meredith

This year’s traditional pre-Fancy Dress, Thurs-
day night concert has been moved from the gym
out to the Pavillion for logistic reasons, and conse-
quently has been scaled down just a bit out of
necessity. But whatever you do, don’t despair; the
SAB has put together such a solid line-up of bands
that this BYOB party, beginning around 8 p.m.,
Feb. 28, promises to be just as good, if not better,
than those held in previous years.

The Brice Street Band will kick things off that
evening, featuring their spirited mix of
mainstream rock 'n roll and Southern funk.
Although they concentrate mostly on covers of
material by established artists, Brice Street is not
your typical bar band by a long shot. Indeed, any
group whose repertoire includes songs by such a
diverse bunch as Jean-Luc Ponty, The Band,
Chick Corea, and The Beach Boys can hardly be
said to be typical of anything!!! Not only are they
versatile, they’re just plain good; after a few

The Fat Ammon’s Band

 

 

 

beers, you just might have a little trouble telling
their versions from the originals!

Thursday night’s headliners, returning to Lex-
ington after a relatively lengthy absence, are pro-
bably among the best and classiest acts going in
the Southeast today. Everything you need to know
about Fat Ammon’s Band can be summed up in
one word: professional. Their lighting and sound
are first-rate and, like Brice Steet, they’re a lot
more than just your run-of-the-mill cover band.
After warming you up a bit with their polished,
disco-soul stylings, Ammon’s invariably closes out
the evening (and brings down the house) with a
fast-paced, witty, entertaining floor show that
should work like gangbusters in the intimate at-
mosphere of the Pavillion.

Sound good??? Well, the price of admission is in-
cluded in the cost of your Fancy Dress ticket, so
don’t forget to BYOB out to the Pavillion Thurs-
day, Feb. 28, around 8 p.m. and get your F.D. 1980
off to a strong start.

Freshman Class Present

 

Rock, Country, Juke... Vodka |

by Pryse Elam

Having taken a stroll around
the board on Friday night, the
Fancy Dress Weekend con-
tinues on Saturday afternoon
with the Freshman Class Grain
Party, which should be no less
spectacular. It will begin at 1:00
p.m. on Saturday afternoon and
draw to a close at 6:00. The par-
ty is put on each year by the
Freshman Class and according
to this year’s Class President,
Jim Averett, “It should be a
really great party!” Featuring
three bands, the goal of the par-
ty is to satisfy everyone’s
taste.‘‘I got three bands, rock,
country, and juke to give
everyone a taste of what they
want.”’ With three bands and
unlimited alcohol this should
prove to be one of the best par-
ties of the year.

Unfortunately, the energy
crisis has struck deep into the

Grain Party 1979

heart of this year’s party by
steering the use of grain alcohol
away from humans _ to
automobiles as gasohol. Lucki-
ly, Averett has averted this
crisis by switching to an alter-
nate form of fuel, vodka. ‘‘I ex-
plored a number of grain
possibilities, but found them to
be unreliable. Rather than risk-
ing it with one of them, I decid-
ed to get vodka. It is certain,
and it is cheaper, so I can get
more.’’ Averett says that the
vodka will be mixed strong
enough with orange juice and
punch to produce the desired ef-
re

The first band to play will be
‘“‘Tracks,” a wide-range rock
band blending everything from
New-Wave to Rock and Jazz. In-
cluded in their repertoire are
songs by such known artists as:

Beatles, Billy Joel, and Steely

of the best at W&L in years. |

The next band to play will be |
“‘Nobody’s Real,” a blend of |

Nobody’s Real has played up
and down the East Coast and is
described as one of the best.
Their repertoire includes songs
from: Little Feat, Bob Dylan,

continues.

Highlighting the afternoon
will be the “Grandeurs,’”’ an
energetic band blending soul,
beach, and disco. This band
having been introduced at
Princeton University in 1978 has
quickly become a_ favorite
among East-Coast colleges.
They will be playing music by
such famous artists as: the O’-

Golden Coach Screening Honors Renoir

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will screen as its second
movie of the winter term the
legendary film The Golden
Coach (France Italy, 1952) by
the great French director Jean
Renoir. Screenings will take
place on Friday and Saturday,
February 8 and 9, in classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall, free of
charge. This rarely seen film is
being shown in honor of Renoir,
who died last year, and who
was, in my judgment, in the
richness of his sensibility, the
greatest director in the history
of cinema.

Two of Renoir’s best known
works, the war film Grand Illu-
sion (1937) and The Rules of the
Game (1939), appear  con-
sistently on critics’ lists of the
ten best films of all time.
(These are often shown here in
Professor Jennings’ Tuesday
night movie series, which is

open to the public.) Jean Renoir
was the son of the Impressionist
painter Auguste Renoir, and
shared the Impressionists’ con-
cern with the relation between
art and our ideas of reality. The
Rules of the Game, which takes
as its subject the French ruling
classes on the eve of World War
II, offers a beautifully complex
meditation on the value of
civilization and civilized life. It
explores the damage that
civilized society does to nature
and the ‘‘natural self,’’ and at
the same time reveals the
richness of the civilized self.

The Golden Coach concerns
the loves of a beautiful Italian
actress in a commedia dell’ arte
troupe traveling through Peru
in the 18th century. Commedia
dell’ arte is a popular art form
that dates back to 16th century
Italy. It weds the artificialities
of early Italian drama to more
popular forms of

entertainment—satiric ‘songs,
dancing, and farces. It is of
great historical importance to
the development of the theater
also because it admitted women
to the stage. Employing im-
provised dialogue and masked
characters, it gave rise to the
traditional characters of pan-
tomime: Harlequin, Clown,
Pantaloon, Scaramouche, and
Columbine.

The film suggests that art and
reality, or civilization and
nature, can be synergistic as
well as antagonistic) and that

what we call the ‘‘natural self”’
may be not only immeasurably
enriched, but actually made
more natural, more alive, more
itself through the imagination
and the civilized world of art
and artifice. Renoir’s distinc-
tion is in the number of tensions
and seeming contradictions he
can feel and hold in balance, in
his unparallelled ability to
grant life its full complexity.

Electric Horseman: Comic Throwbac

by Paul Hendry

They don’t make movies like
they used to? Well, they do, and
one of them is currently at Lex-
ington’s Lyric—The Electric
Horseman. In fact, The Electric
Horseman so outshines the
other recently released com-
edies that it is provocation for a
careful examination of trade
trends.

The film is an atavism, a
throwback to the screwball
comedies of the thirties and
simpler times. It greatly
resembles many films of the
‘screwball’ genre, but most
noticeably It Happened One
Night starring Clark Gable and
Claudette Colbert.

In Electric Horseman the
roles have been reversed: the
runaway heiress becomes run-
away media-celebrity cowboy;
and the calculating _ in-
vestigative reporter who starts
out after the big story and winds
up in love is changed from
Gable to Jane Fonda.

Robert Redford is the ‘‘Elec-
tric Horseman’’—a former
rodeo world champion who has
bowed to the dollar and taken to
selling breakfast cereal for a
conglomerate.

A fish out of water in the high
powered advertising, media-
orientated world, Redford con-
scientiously hijacks the cor-
porate symbol, a_ valuable
thoroughbred horse who is
abused by the bad guys of big
business.

The rash action of the proud
man humiliatingly reduced to a
pitchman clad in a ridiculous
electrically lighted cowboy suit
inspires roving reporter Jane
Fonda to cooly follow the out-
cast’s fight for pride, fairness,
and that which is morally right.

The plot follows along these
simple lines to an inevitable
conclusion. Good old-fashioned
entertainment.

There is something essential
to the plot that is not old-
fashioned, however, and that is
the love interest at the core of
the story. The screen relation-
ship between Redford and Fon-
da is enjoyable in its clash of
personalities and sharp ex-
changes, but it fails to be com-
pletely convincing with respect
to their tempestuous love affair.
It seems obvious that the cow-
boy prefers his horse (who he

does kiss at the movies end) to .

Fonda, to whom he only directs
a few winsome gazes and occa-
sionally beds down.

The potential for a serious
and sensitive union of the two is
trashed for a couple of tosses in
the hay. This is a failing of
script writer and director and
not the actors.

Redford and Fonda are both
very adept at creating
believable personages, and if
one can forgive Fonda her
demonstrative public image it
is possible to enjoy her rare
talents. She is the quintessential
stuck-up city professional

woman and her conflict with the
country-wise Redford is classic.

There are also notable sup-
porting performances by
Valerie Perrine as the cowboy’s
ex-wife and by Willie Nelson as
Redford’s best friend.

The second half of the film
lulls itself into a pretentious
lyrical folk ballad’ with
beautifully photographed
panoramas of the West, ap-
propriately scored. Without the
earlier tension between the
characters and without insur-
mountable obstacles for the
heroes to overcome, the film
does drag.

The long awaited climax ends
the drawn out picturesque in-
terlude with its ‘‘profound”
developments.

Where is the comedy? Red-
ford and Fonda are not off
Saturday Night Live and have
no comedy albums. They don’t
even have a T.V. series of their
own.

What is funny in the film—
and it is very funny—comes out
of the skillful exchange be-
tween two outstanding actors
working off of an intelligent and
provoking script.

The Electric Horseman is a
Versatile film that strikes at
more than the funny bone. It is a
success, too.

Movies like Spielberg’s 1941
and Reiner’s The Jerk are
significant failures although
they boast the comic talents of
such standouts as John Belushi;

Dan Aykroyd, Slim Pickens and
Steve Martin. They fail in an ef-
fort for a continuous laugh.
Mindless slapstick, due to its
essential elements of quick sur-
prise and explosiveness, does
not lend itself to long sustained
forms, but rather to short sket-
ches.

The Electric Horseman,
while trotting at too slow a pace
at times, has moments of genu-
ine humor that are produced by
believable screen characters. It
is in these moments that Elec-
tric Horseman takes off at a full
gallop that leaves the likes of
1941 and The Jerk in its dust.

 

Film Notes

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), George
Roy Hill’s buoyant western, has many memorable
moments for everyone, and the initial teaming of
Paul Newman and Robert Redford nailed the coffin
shut on the so-called ‘“‘woman’s picture” for years.
William Goldman’s script is well paced and effective-
ly carried out by the principle players and the
beautiful Katherine Ross. The film is remarkable for
its sharp contrast to the harsher, more violent films
which characterized the period. The Bachrach-David
score (especially ‘‘Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My
Head’’) dates it slightly.

Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979), an ill-
advised ‘‘prequel”’, made nearly ten years after the
fact, which didn’t sell. Director Richard Lester is at
least consistant: this was his fourth flop in as many
years. The title provides a wonderful summary of the
plot of this critical and commercial dog. With Tom
Berringer and William Katt who, Rona Barrett
hooted a few years ago, would be our next Clark
Gable. Sure, Rona.

Note: The most recent of the two films will be shown
at 7 p.m. in Dupont auditorium, Feb. 8-10. A separate
admission ($1) will be charged for each.

WLUR, Gym Hardest Hit

(continued from page 1)

ing stolen at night—$400 worth of records were
stolen in night thefts in one month. Managers at-
tribute the thefts to students. More doors being
locked at night (while the Co-op is open) has
eliminated the problem, Goldsten said.

There is some problem with “slippage” in the
textbook department of the book store, according
to manager Betty Munger. Slippage is the term for
“‘unaccounted-for disappearances.”

She has locked up the back door to stop some of
the thefts. Munger says she really cannot estimate
the losses or where they occur because the book-
store runs on a deficit and records of specific book
sales are not kept.

“The only thing I can count on is the rapport
with the students,”’ she said.

The main problem in the gymnasium is the
disappearance of towels, said Chub Yeakel, the
supervisor of the equipment.

About 600 towels were stolen last year, he said.
They usually are taken while nobody is at the
equipment room window.

Balls are often checked out and not returned on
time, but they eventually get back to the equip-
ment room, he said. Squash and handballs are
broken, he suspects, and says he would appreciate
students bringing the broken ones back so they
can be accounted for.

Practice equipment is stolen, especially gym
shorts and shirts. Yeakel says he loses more than
$500 a year on that equipment. Much of it is
reported stolen from the students it was issued to,

he said. He suspects much of that stealing is done
by the students.

As for stealing in the dormitories, ‘‘there’s a lot
of it,’ says Head Dorm Counselor Danny Carucci.

Most of the thefts occur on the first floor, he
said, and there have been reports of ‘‘townies’’ in
the building. Often, he says, a student reports as
stolen something he has lost or misplaced.

Hall refrigerators are frequent targets, he said.
Beer is often taken, sometimes as much as a case
ata time.

Are students doing any of the stealing? “Only a
few, who need to be caught,” said Carucci.

The book loss rate in the library is about 112
percent, according to head librarian Maurice
Leach.

While this is a low loss rate, says Leach, the
department libraries have a loss rate of 6 percent.
A rate above five percent is cause for concern, he
said.

Leach said that 30 to 50 books appear in student
apartments over the summer and when new rent-
ers move in in September.

There is also the problem with books that are not
checked out, as sometimes the library needs to
retrieve the book and there is no record of its
whereabouts.

Some types of books tend to disappear and reap-
pear more than others, especially those in ‘‘cer-
tain humanities’’ departments, said Leach.

As for items stolen from the carrels, Leach said,
“The student body would be wise not to leave
anything of obvious monetary value in the car-
rels.”’

Applications For
Admission Up

Applications for admission to
Washington and Lee University
are up 46 percent this winter
over the number at the same
point a year ago, admissions of-
ficials reported today.

As of Jan. 30—with two more
weeks to go before the 1980 ap-
plication deadline—W&L had
received 1,012 applications
from prospective freshmen.

The Jan. 30 figure is the
highest in many years and
points to the probability that
more than 1,400 applications
will be processed in all, ac-
cording to admissions director
William M. Hartog.

The total is likely to be the
second-highest Washington and
Lee has ever received, he said.

Beyond numbers, according
to Hartog, the quality of
students who are applying to
Washington and Lee this year is
higher both by statistical
measures of achievement and
in terms of personal records.

The mean College Board
scores for the 1,012 students
who have applied so far this
year are up 10 points from last
year’s average. .

Twelve -National Merit
Scholarship competition final-

ists have named W&L their first
choice among all colleges, Har-
tog said—against four on the
same date a year ago.

On the basis of the 1,000-plus
applications received so far,
Hartog said, the overall quality
at the top of the group is so
superior that Washington and
Lee has already doubled the
number of acceptances it has
sent out under its ‘‘clearly ad-
missible”’ criteria to 200 as of
Jan. 30 this year. The figure a
year ago was 100.

The ‘‘clearly admissible”
category refers to applicants
whose records are so outstand-
ing that they can be offered ad-
mission without waiting to be
compared against the entire
group of applicants.

Of those 200 who have already
been accepted by W&L, 65 per-
cent are in the top tenth of their
secondary-school classes.

Only once in the past decade
has W&L received a total of
more than 1,400 applications—
in 1973, with 1,412.

The Jan. 30 application
figures for recent years were
694 a year ago, 544 two years
ago, and 928 in 1977.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Letters To The Editor

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Hazing

The time of initiation is upon us, when all good
pledges make the passage from goat to brother into
the fraternity of their choice. Here a fraternity’s
traditions manifest themselves, often to the detri-
ment of the pledge but for the general amusement of-
the brethren. Hazing practices have been around
since the stone age, but we are no longer in the stone
age and nobody can seriously believe that a pledge
will not become a man if he does not do obscene things
with olives.

The administration and the IFC is cracking down on
hazing. Some houses have been caught, others are be-
ing careful, many are modifying their activities. One
of the houses formerly associated with a rigorous Hell
Night voted as a chapter just to simply abolish all haz-
ing, cold turkey. The logic was that although they
might get away with some things this year, or even
pull the whole thing off, eventually they will get
caught and the penalties are too stiff totake the risk of
getting caught.

All fraternities could take a similar action and not
suffer any loss of ‘‘pledge unity” or whatever excuse
is used. Hazing is propagated by peer pressure; when
the peers all agree and the pressure is removed, the
fraternities will be surprised to see how little is miss-
ed. And nobody can logically buy the old line, ‘“They
did it to me, so the pledges should have to do it, too.”’

We have all heard the horror stories about hazing
incidents that end in tragedy. Many of the hazing ac-
tivities that occur on this campus may be safe when-
practiced as intended, but it is too easy for something
to go wrong. The dangers of exposure and especially
alcohol poisoning are underestimated but very real.

Consider the risks your fraterntiy takes by engag-
ing in hazing practices, ‘‘voluntary”’ or not. Besides
the risk of harming a pledge there is the very real risk
of stiff punishment by the IFC, punishment that
seems worse with the approach of Fancy Dress. The
IFC is hitting fraternities for what may seem trivial
infractions, things the pledges enjoy and cause no
harm to anyone, but the punishments are being hand-
ed out and enforced. SAC does not see the harmless-
ness of many incidents, and is seldom amused.

We do not suggest that all Initations should stick to
the hocus-pocus in the secret book. The activities do
not have to benefit the community or the house. They
can still be enjoyed by all and will probably be more
memorable. Will it matter in five years that you had
to drink molasses and Tabasco in order to learn a
secret handshake?

Admission Price At Sweet Briar

Dear Editor,

The following letter was received by The Sweet
Briar News, and in turn given to me. As the chair-
man of the Social Committee I believe I can
clarify any misunderstandings about our admis-
sion/cover charge policies. This letter and reply
will also appear in the next issue of The Sweet

Briar News.

Dear Editor,

I am a student at Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, and for my own Satisfaction, I would like to
know why you charge admission at your social
functions. This has puzzled me for quite some time
because I feel that this policy is unjustifiable.

The girls from your school attend our fraternity
parties here in Lexington, and we supply the beer,
grain alcohol, etc. The only cost deferred upon the
girls is the price of the gas over here.

Not only do the fraternities sponsor FREE par-
ties, but the school itself does also. The Student
Activities Board sponsors many parties and bands
When there is a cover

throughout the year.
charge, it is paid by everyone.

It seems only natural that your school would
reciprocate. We drive over—the price of gas isn’t
exactly cheap—and once we get there, we are
charged for admission as well as for beer. Is this
considerate behavior? What’s wrong, girls? Spen-
ding all your money on makeup and clothes?

In this day and age of ‘‘Women’s Lib,” have you
not—figuratively speaking—have you not stooped
” charging your men for

to a level of ‘‘prostitution :
your female companionship?

Sincerely yours,

First, there is obviously a misunderstanding con-
cerning our admission/cover charge policy. Sweet
Briar students are neither given free admission
nor any special rates to events where our guests
are asked to pay a fee. EVERYONE (both boys
and girls) is charged the same amount.

Secondly, Social Committee is run on a very
tight budget, about one-third of our budget is spent
on parties. Our budget also includes the movies

which are shown almost every Saturday night (25
cents admission),
wine and cheese parties, playreadings, and guest
theater productions. Thus the revenue from a par-
ty must cover the costs of the band, the beer, a
professional cleaning crew, security, and any
DAMAGES done to the campus (the latter cost be-
ing very unpredictable). Since I do not know how

coffeehouse entertainment,

the budgets of the Student Activities Board or the

individual fraternities are organized, it would be
presumptuous for me to comment on their admis-
sion/cover charge policies.

Thirdly, Sweet Briar usually charges one all-

inclusive admission price. The most recent party

a beer,”’

on the 19th of January was the first time we have
ever charged two fees (admission and beer). The
flyers plainly stated ‘‘$2.00 admission and 25 cents
thus the charges should not have been a
shock once one reached the party.

I trust this has answered Mr. Leachman’s ques-
tions and clarified our admission/cover charge
policies. Thank you for the opportunity to explain
Sweet Briar’s admission/cover charge policies

and to correct any misunderstandings concerning

them.

William Leachman ’82

In response to Mr. Leachman’s letter to the
editor, I believe I can solve the ‘‘puzzle’’ as to why
we “charge admission to our social functions.”’

War Fever And Torn Down Posters

Dear Editor,

In response to the war fever
that seems to be gripping our
country and to the recent
clamor for the reinstitution of
conscription we, as a group of
alarmed and concerned
students, wanted to express our
opposition to this growing way
hysteria.

We chose to do this by putting
up a series of posters around
campus that had anti-war and
anti-draft slogans emblazoned
on them. While we did not ex-
pect that all members of the
W&L community would agree
with us we did expect that our
right to express ourselves free-

The Error Of Our Ways

I thank the heavens that I have seen the error of ability to make decisions as either groups or in-

my ways.

For several years, I was under the absurd
assumption that I bore sole responsibility for my
actions. I believed that I was capable of deciding
when, and to what extent, I would pursue the in-
tellectual studies assigned to me by my betters. I
even believed that the consequences of ignoring

ly would be respected.

Unfortunately this was not
the case. Within three hours of
the time that the posters went
up 95 percent of them had been
ripped down. We had expected
that some individuals would
find our message offensive and
that there would be sporadic
and isolated attempts to censor
us but we were apalled to en-
counter a seemingly systematic
effort by self-appointed censors
to silence us.

We are disappointed by this
show of intolerance but one of
our main hopes in initiating this
poster campaign may yet be
realized. This was the desire to
open a dialogue in the W&L
community on the disturbing

dividuals.

Sincerely,

Ann T. Rockwell

Chairman, Social Committee
Sweet Briar College

implications that recent events,
both foreign and domestic, have
for all Americans.

To this end we call upon all
those who found our message
offensive enough to warrant
censorship to come forward and
publicly defend their actions.
We also call on all members of
the W&L community to par-
ticipate, publicly or privately,
in a re-examination of those
ideas that have brought us so
perilously to military confron-
tation.

Finally, any member of the
W&L community who wishes to
lend us their support, moral or
otherwise, is invited to contact
us at 463-9752.

Sincerely,
Bruce Vail

Tom Burns

Obviously, because these great men have said
so, the present level of unfavorable grades is not
enough of a deterrent to keep students away from
those social activities that have been demmed so
repugnant. Yet, to increase the number of op-
portunities for unfavorable grades would be to un-

justly require these great discerners of truth to
spend more time away from the quiet contempla-
tion that their superiority deserves and requires.
Therefore, I beg the student body to grant the fiats
of these hallowed men their unqualified support,
as Ihave.

Throw away your recordings of ‘bar music.”
Do not participate in mid-week festivities as
groups. Recognize and ignore the transitory temp-
tations of the opposite sex. Help raise the level of
professors, salaries. Do homage to the past while
remaining blind to the present. In short, dedicate
yourself to the will and whims of those who believe
they possess the true basis of judgment and who
are willing to impose it on anyone who disagrees.

my studies (i.e. bad grades) would be enough to
spur me on in even those fields where sweet
apathy seemed to cloud my judgment.

Ahh, but I was mistaken.

Those members of the faculty that have ap-
pointed themselves philosopher-kings have shown
me the folly of my past beliefs. As the possessors
of the highest wisdom and virtue, they, and cer-
tainly not any students, should determine the form
and limits of this institution’s social experiences.

With their heightened insight, these philosopher-
king-professors have seen that we are incapable of
governing ourselves. As lesser beings, it is only
correct that we bend to their will and renounce our

Faculty Movement To Undermine The UC

To the Editor:

A number of alarming topics are currently be-
ing debated by certain factions within the
Washington and Lee community. Specifically,
these are the removal of policy-making authority
from the University Council, and the prohibition of
all weeknight fraternity parties.

The University Council was established ‘“‘by
faculty action on December 7, 1970, and among its
specific responsibilities was to exercise delegated
authority.”” This authority was delegated on April
1, 1974 by further faculty action—the University
Council was henceforth to develop policy for stu-
dent conduct.

The University Council is composed of admini-
strators, faculty, and students. It has, in recent
years, proven to be rational and judicious in the
performance of its duties. It is a well-balanced
representative body, and to remove the UC from
any effective role on this campus would be a
heinous crime because the UC has emerged as the
only forum where all views are represented and
can be heard. In essence, this is the only body (ex-
cluding the student body EC) where we have a
fighting chance to affect the policies which control
us.

Faculty discussion to remove the policy-making
capability of the UC has surfaced in response to
recent decisions of this committee. This move-
ment appears to be little more than spoiled
children throwing a tantrum because they did not
get their way.

Although the faculty gave the UC its authority
and can just as easily remove it, I believe that it
would be a grievous error to do so.

No More Restrictions

The fraternity situation has drastically changed
since my freshman year. The mere suggestion of
further prohibitions of weeknight fraternity par-
ties is disturbing, to say the least. A compromise
of opinions appears to have been reached. The
fraternities are settling into the current state of af-
fairs with regard to weeknight parties, and addi-
tional restrictions in this area should not be ac-
cepted. The fraternities at W&L are the most
cohesive interest group, and if they were to form a
unified front, their voice would be_ heard.
However, this is not the crux of the situation.

The faculty’s action is like the scatter pattern of
a shotgun shell—the faculty has not aimed on the
central issue but is hitting around it. The in-
dividual student should be the focus of the facul-
ty’s concern. The Student Affairs Committee
made this point clear in its report on the Relation-
ship between Academic and Fraternity Life:
‘*’.._Individual students, not organizations, bear
the responsibility for that student’s grades.”’

If Washington and Lee is to retain its emphasis
on liberal arts then the faculty should realize that
part of this education is the ability to set one’s
priorities. If one chooses to party seven nights a
week, the faculty has within its powers the ability
to teach the student where he may possibly be
wrong in his conduct. We came to W&L to receive

_an education, not to be wound up like robots.

The faculty can control our academic lives, but
outside of the classroom we are free to live as we
please—including our social lives.

Response To The Motion To Ban Bands

Thanks For
Editorial

Dear Editor,

Thank you for your editorial
“On Banning Bands,”’ in which
you exposed IFC President Syd
Farrar’s position, or lack
thereof, concerning live bands
at mid-week fraternity parties.

If your allegations are true, it
is obvious that Mr. Farrar’s
voting is, indeed, ‘“‘motivated by
the audience he is playing to,”’
not the fraternity members
whom he_- supposedly
represents.

It is unfortunate that the
fraternity system, now under
siege, is represented by an IFC
President who is apparently
willing to put his own interests
above those of the constituency
which placed him in office.

Perhaps it is time that we, the
fraternity members at
Washington and Lee, seek out a
leader who will take a stand
against the Administration’s

encroachment on_ fraternity
rights.

Sincerely,

David G. Stoeffel

Regulating
Social Life

Dear Editor:

The continued attempts of
various faculty members to
regulate the social life of the
student body forces me to com-
ment on the issues at hand.

The 1979-80 University
Catalogue states that ‘‘the same
code of honor that governs
academic life guides personal
life. Washington and Lee in the
words of its current President,
confidently entrusts the largest
possible measure of choice and
freedom to its students.”’

The said Honor Code, as
established by a former Presi-
dent, rests firmly in the
freedom of the students to
establish acceptable behavior.

President Lee echoed a hun-
dred years ago Plato’s idea that
it is unnecessary to dictate to
men of breeding. I hope the re-
cent moves of the faculty does
not signal the end of these noble
ideals at Washington and Lee.

I came to W&L under the
assumption that the concepts
printed in the Catalogue were
the governing forces. I trust
these policy statements were
then and are now more than PR

see REGULATIONS, page 16

 

IFC President Questions Phi Allegations

For Fraternities Needed

Dear Editor,

After reading the articles con-
cerning fraternities and the pro-
posals of the University Council
in last week’s issue of theRing-
tum Phi I believe it is necessary
to write a letter about the real
issues behind the intellectual
movement on this campus and
the restrictions placed upon the
fraternities.

The faculty and the ad-
ministration are blaming a lack
of individual responsibility for
their actions. The faculty

believes we should study five |

nights a week. I must agree
with some of the lack of in-
dividual responsibility, but not
the reasons for the lack of it.

Fraternities and bands on
campus during the week are not
the problem. The lack of
responsibility is an attitude of a
minority of the students.

I did not come to this universi-
ty or choose to go to college to
study five nights a week. I
believe there is a lot more to
college than academics.

There is more to be learned
than what can be gotten out of
the classroom or the library.
There are athletics, school
publications, Mock Convention,
fraternities, etc. all of which
are a worthwhile learning ex-
perience.

The fraternities have improv-
ed a lot over the last year anda
half. They have an improved
reputation, cleaner houses,
more respect for the Lexington
community and have taken part
in some community projects.

The Interfraternity Council
has donated $5,000 to Contact, a
couple hundred dollars to the
United Way and no telling how
much to the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon.

Obviously the fraternities are
not totally free of guilt, but they
are not at the base of the pro-
blem.

Most people just do not want
to spend all their time learning
in the classroom or doing
homework. The fraternities
have improved and are continu-
ing to improve.

Do not try to impede progress
by placing more restrictions on
the fraternities or taking the in-
tellectual movement too far.

Secondly, I agree whole-
heartedly with the editor that
Dr. Merchant should not be the
advisor to the Interfraternity
Council. He is not on the side of
fraternities and seems to have
little compassion for them.

I would also like to point out
that he showed a lack of respon-
sibility when» speaking out
against fraternities and one in
particular during his lectures.
From my limited experience
with the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, he has been totally irra-
tional during the proceedings.
Luckily, the rest of the commit-
tee is able to control itself.

I have no solution or com-
promise for the problems that
some say are debasing our
education at Washington and
Lee. Those in charge should
deal with the problems-and not
the effects of those problems.

I just hope that they realize
the situation as it is and only
make the necessary changes
that will neither hurt the frater-
nity system nor student life as a
whole.

Sincerely,
Andy deMuth

To The Editor:

In regard to the letter by Mr. Feinman address-
ing the question “Is Syd Farrar ‘Passing the
Buck’?,’’ I would like to respond in the following
fashion. Mr. Feinman, you suggested that ‘‘one
would not need a J.D’ degree to understand...’’
something or another. It was soon obvious after
reading your letter that you are certainly the one
that does not have his J.D. degree. Most lawyers
make it their business to know the facts of the case
before they enter the courtroom. You not only did
not know the facts (for which I’m sure you will
blame the Ring-tum Phi reporting), but then you
attempted to become both judge and juror on a
case based on hearsay evidence and third-hand
knowledge. For your information:

(1) After three IFC Judicial Board sessions,
with much conflicting testimony, it was decided
that although the two Figis involved did throw
snowballs and perhaps broke windows, it was up
to Student Control to handle the individuals involv-
ed instead of penalizing the whole fraternity for
their actions.

(2) The two Fijis involved never entered the
PiKA house as you suggested.

(3) It was the duty of the IFC Judicial Board to
decide whether either fraternity was guilty of a
violation in the incident. It is not the duty of the
Judicial Board to decide the guilt or innocence of
individuals and on that basis the decision to find
out who should be responsible to the PiKAs for
damage, was passed to the Student Control Com-
mittee.

(4) In regards to fraternity involvement, the
PiKAs were commended by the Judicial Board for
their actions in trying to prevent the incident while
the Fijis (the house as a whole) were severely
reprimanded for their march down to the PiKA
house. It was suggested by the Judicial Board that
both houses keep their members away from each
other and that any future incidents would be look-
ed upon unfavorably by the Judicial Board.

So, Mr. Feinman, if you want to bitch, get your
facts staight. The IFC Judicial Board was respon-
sible only for the acts of the fraternities and not
the individuals in question. Student Control and
SAC handled the incidents of the individuals in
question. Student Control and SAC handled the in-
cidents of the individuals involved, in case you
didn’t know. From the standpoint of fraternity in-
volvement, the Judicial Board handled its case.
Maybe if you have complaints about the handling
of the cases of the students involved you ought to
take that up with Student Control. Of course, you
may disagree with the Judicial Board’s decision

not to go further than reprimanding the frater-
nities involved, but that is your perogative. It is
Strange to note, though, that on two adjoining
pages the Judicial Board was accused of ‘‘passing
the buck” to Student Control on a case involving
two individuals while in an anonymous editorial
the Judicial Board was further accused of
“‘mishandling”’ a case involving several members
of a fraternity which in the minds of the writer (or
should I say, writers) should have been sent to Stu-
dent Control. I guess it’s a no-win proposition.

Regarding the Ring-tum Phi editorial which, I
think it is interesting to note, was left unsign-
ed...anybody can write a letter to the editor or an
editorial, but I guess it takes a man to sign his
name to it. It is easy to state remarks both un-
founded and untrue, easier still to do this when not
having to say who you are and not having to back
up your statements. Isn’t that true Mr. Smith and
Mr. Billmyre? You made light of my voting record
in SAC concerning the band issue, not knowing the
facts or feelings surrounding my SAC vote. You
spoke of a “‘bargain’’ I made..I wish you had that
on tape because I’m sure that statement is quite
untrue, and inserted into your editorial to arouse
the ire of the student body.

And as to being a puppet, one thing for sure—I
won’t be a puppet to your editorials. The decisions
I’ve made, most of which have been made with the
help of the IFC Judicial Board, have been made in
good faith. So Mr. Smith and Mr. Billmyre I’m
sure that if you keep making your opinions based
on unsubstantiated facts and second-hand in-
formation that one day you will make a great cub-
reporter for a gossip column in a small town
newspaper.

Syd Farrar
Editor's Note: Comments appearing under . the
heading “Review and Outlook” express the opinions
of the editors of the Ring-tum Phi. Often they are
written by one or more persons and are intended to
represent the editorial stance of this student
newspaper. They have been unsigned all year.

Editor Randy Smith telephoned Mr. Farrar twice
last Wednesday night to give him a chance to express
his reasons for his voting switch. He declined at that
time to relate to us the “facts or feelings surrounding”
his SAC vote, as he has again failed to do in the above
letter. The word “bargain” was Mr. Farrar’s own.

Until such time as the IFC President can explain his
voting switch and can demonstrate that the facts in the
editorial were indeed “unsubstantiated” and “‘second-
hand information” (although they came from Mr. Far-
rar himself), the Ring-tum Phi stands behind the Jan.
31 editorial.

More On W&L Hangings Controversy

To the Editor:

I read with interest Mr. J.
Cabell Acree’s lamentation
over the fate of thos infamous
wall hangings (‘‘When Bettor
Women are Made, W&L Men
Will Make Them.’’)

Criticism Of
Carmichael

Dear Editor,

Today as I read the Ring-tum
Phi article ‘‘Carmichael
Predicts Organized Rebellion,”
I sat back and though about the
irony of the W&L blacks using
money given them by the
University to pay $2,000 to a
negro revolutionary for an hour
harangue on the evils of the
capitalist system. I am an ar-
dent capitalist, but I would feel
guilty if I were paid any more
than $1,000 an hour for my time.

Not only is Carmichael a
failure as a revolutionary, but
he is certainly not aiding his
race with his attitude. For
negroes to call themselves
Africans is as silly as for me to
call myself English because my
forebears came thence. For a
group of American citizens to
designate themselves
‘Africans’ calls into question
their loyality to this country and
makes one wonder to what ex-
tent they value the citizenship
which was given them.

It is quite interesting that a
speaker of Carmichael’s
notoriety was invited onto our
campus. Would it perhaps be
better to transfer most of
SABU’s budget to Contact and
bring onto campus speakers of
more general interest to the
University?

Sincerely,
David F. Mullin ’81

hype.
I caution the faculty against
Washington fever and ask them
to consider the consequences of
a Leviathon of rules and regula-
tions. The suggested regula-
tions cannot logically be enforc-
ed and more importantly they
would drastically damage the
‘‘play hard—work _hard’’
reputation of the school (which
nets most of W&L’s students).

Finally, the faculty should
concentrate on establishing ‘‘a
climate of learning’ by ex-
emplification, not by forcing
parties down icy mountain
roads. I challenge them to in-
spire us from within so that ex-
ternal regulation is made un-
necessary.

Mr. Acree’s first objection to
the Supply Store’s discontin-
uance of their sale is that since
women at W&L are such a small
minority, it is ‘‘unfair to the rest
of the student body,’’ who, ac-
cording to Mr. Acree, is clamor-
ing to purchase these items.

Questions of taste notwith-
standing, I firmly object to his
notion that slogans offensive to
a particular minority should be
tolerated and merchandized by
an institution of higher learn-
ing. Blacks are also a minority
at W&L. Would you have us
poke fun at them, Mr. Acree?

Mr. Acree’s second argument
is even more ignominious. He
objects to the law women’s
disapproval of these hangings,

because we should be busy
writing our Congressmen con-
cerning the Equal Rights
Amendment (many of us have),
rather than protesting  in-
justices closer to home.

I have two proposals for Mr.
Acree. First, if the obnoxious
hangings are to be restocked at
the Supply Store, equal space
should be given to the feminine
(feminist?) counterpart: ‘‘Until
Better W&L Men are Made,
W&L Women Will Ignore
Them;”’ and second, since Mr.
Acree is so in favor of hangings,
perhaps he would volunteer
himself as the first victim.

Gretchen C.F. Shappert

Fencing Club Neglected

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter as a
question to the editorial staff of
the Ring-tum-Phi, specifically
those people in charge of the
sports section of the paper.

I am curious as to why the
University Fencing Club has
received almost no attention in
the sports section of the paper
this semester. Although the
paper covered our _ season
opener against James Madison
University late last semester,
(a meet which we easily won),
the paper has not printed any
articles which the club has sub-
mitted to it, as it has done in the
past.

To bring your readers up to
date, the fencing club is now
holding a 3-2 win-loss record, a
better percentage than some
varsity teams here. We have
competed against schools
where fencing has varsity sport
status, and have done extreme-
ly well for a club sport. We
defeated James Madison, lost a
close match to UVa., (which is
one of the stronger teams in the
state), and last weekend finish-
ed second to William and Mary
in a four team tournament, in
which we defeated the Universi-
ty of Maryland at Baltimore,
and Virginia Tech. We have
some talented fencers. Many of
us came home with a better
than .500 average, and soph-
omore Dave Hepler defeated
the defending state champion in
epee by the score of 5-3.

Later this year we will fence
VMI, and in two weeks our
fencers will compete for honors
in the Virginia State cup, which

Although the fencers have
club status, we are not a fly-by-
night organization. We had a
strong group of freshmen
recruits this Fall, and we will
lose only 4 seniors from the
starting nine positions. Our
team is dedicated to the sport,
we have worked hard, and we
have financed most of our own
equipment.

We feel justified in complain-
ing about the lack of attention
the paper has given to us, and
we hope that if your sports
reporters will not cover our
meets, then at least you will
print the articles we write for
you.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
William B. Sherwin ’81
