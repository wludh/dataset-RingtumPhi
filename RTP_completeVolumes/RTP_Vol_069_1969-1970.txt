Huntley calls
for action on
development

President Huntley dwelled upon
planned physical improvements yes-
terday in his annual opening assem-
bly address to the student body.
While declining to comment upon
the ground breaking date for any of
the new buildings, he assured the
students and faculty that plans were
well under way and in one instance
complete.

In reference to the date work
would start on the addition to Dore-
mus Gym, Huntley said that he
would not make any definite predic-
tion but that it would very likely be
completed before all of the students
in the assembly were graduated. The
plans for the proposed addition were
unveiled last spring. Huntley also
said that plans for a new library.
law school, and dorms to be situated
across the ravine were nearing com-
pletion. He also announced that Mc-
Cormick Library would probably be
renovated for use by the School of
Commerce.

President Huntley declared that
fund raising campaigns were going
very well, but that extra help would
always be appreciated. As of last
spring about one third of the funds
for the Doremus addition had been
raised,

Student Center dedication set

By Lex McMillan
Associate News Editor
Fhe weekend of October 4 will
see the dedication of the long needed
and awaited Student Union. The
classes of 1924, 1934, 1939, 1949

Passavant and Tyler appointed,
'69 Grads join administration

Iwo members of Washington and
Lee’s 1969 graduating class were
appointed to University administra-
live positions this past summer John
E. “Jay” Passavant, last year's Stu-
dent Body President was appointed
as assistant to the Director of Ad-
missions, and William C. Tyler was
appointed Assistant Director of De-
velopment. The moves were in line
with what the administration hopes
will be a regular program to bring
the views and capabilities of young
graduates annually into at least a
year's service to the University.

With regard to the first of the
appointments, that of Passavant,
President Huntley said, “We hope
we will be able each year to bring
an outstanding member of the senior
class—not necessarily the student
government president—into a year's
internship in administrative work.”

The appoiniments came just
shortly after graduation. Passavant
was appointed on June 18, and Tyler
the following day. Both appoini-
ments were made effective as of
July 1.

Passavant’s duties include making
extensive visits to secondary schools
and interviewing candidates for ad-
mission, as well as assisting in other
general admissions work. Tyler has
as his special responsibility the di-
rection of the University’s annual

giving programs, including the
alumni fund and the parents fund.
He will also assist Farris P.
Hotchkiss, Director of Development,
in general development work,

As well as holding the Student
Body Presidency, Passavant was the
first student ever to represent the
student body before the Board of
Trustees. A Dean's List student, he
was a member of WAL’s track team,
and served as President of the Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes. Pas-
savant was President of Pi Kappa
Alpha social fraternity.

Tyler was a Dean's List student
at WAL. He was a member of the
Dance Board, Chairman of the
Young Republican Community Ser-
vice and house manager of Beta
Theta Pi social fraternity.

Literary magazine
to organize staff

An organizational meeting of
Ariel, the student literary magazine,
will be held Wednesday night at 9:00
p.m. in room 212 at the student cen-
ier. Anyone interested in working on
this year's staff should plan to ai
tend this important meeting. Fresh-
men are especially invited.

Ariel is published four times per
year and contains student literary
endeavors.

and 1964 will have the opportunity
to participate in the ceremonies.
That weekend will be a reunion for
these classes, as well as Homecoming
Weekend.

The new center is a $750,000 re-
novation and addition to an already
existing two story building which
had served as the Student Union.
Phe main new construction consisted
of a one story structure joining the
Dining Hall with the original struc-
ture.

The two chief crowd gathering
features of the Center will be its
tavern and the recreation room. The
tavern is decorated in dark wood
paneling with mahogany floors. This
is contrasted by a red and blue bur-
lap wall decor. The tavern sports a
long bar which will be serving near-
beer, and possibly wine. There will
also be a grill serving short order
items. The floor space is quite large
and seating consists of tables and

dark wood booths.

Downstairs is the recreation room
in which are located pool tables,
ping-pong tables and card tables. All
facilities are free except for the pool
tables which are rented at a minimal
charge of $1.00 per hour per table.
The recreation room is all carpeted
as is most of the rest of the center.

Some of the other facilities in-
clude two T.V. rooms. the E. €
room, and numerous meeting rooms.
There is also a comfortable library
and a small chapel. The music de-
partment and the glee club have
moved inio rooms located in the
lower level of the center. Dean
Sprunt has also moved into a new
office located in the building. An-
other feature of the new facility is
the large reception room handsomely
decorated in a French Provincia!
theme.

Ihe hallways throughout the cen-

ter are displaying a great deal of
student art work,

The Student Union is operated by
students under the Work/Study pro-
gram and is headed by Mr. Ken
Lane. It is open from noon until
midnight.

 

Number 1

EC supports counselors’
conventional dress stand

President Swede Henberg called
the first Executive Committee meet-
ing of the year to order last night
in their new meeting room in the
student center. All members of the
committee were present.

Seated at the center of the new
semicircular conference table, Hen-
berg first instructed that the chair-
men of the standing committees file
all reports, decisions or resolutions
concerning actions of their respective
committees in the EC office. Hen-
berg then announced his appoint-
ment of senior representative Dave
Bethea to be the student representa-
tive to the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee,

John Bernard, chairman of the
Student Control Committee, report-
ed that the first weekend of having
girls in the dorms was successful
without infraction of the rules.

John Miller, chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, requested
the Executive Committee to alter the
name of his group to the University
Center Committee. Miller cited as
reasons the joint efforts already
made this year between his com-
mittee and Ken Lane, the director
of the Center, and the fact that the
committee has nearly completed its
“assimilation” duties for the com-
ing year. The EC decided to take
action on Miller’s request ai a future

IFC convenes first meeting

The IFC voted last night 18-0 to
reinstate the weekly three-hour con-
structive work weeks for freshmen
pledges during the first semester.
Work weeks as well as pledge ha-
rassmeni were outlawed last semester
after recommendation from the
faculty.

The three hour work week is in
addition to the one hour of pledge
education now allowed as legitimate
pledging exercises during the first
semester. Bill McKelway introduced
a motion to allow fraternities to
initiate after the mid-semester fe-
ports in November. This motion was
defeated.

Larry Honig introduced a motion
to donate $100 per fraternity to
Swimin 70, a project to build a
municipal pool for the Lexington
area citizens. The Doremus pool is
the only pool that is now available
for the Lexington public. This mo-
tion was tabled until next week to
allow the fraternity representatives
to consult their respective houses.

Chuck Cahn, IFC president, an
nounced a deadline of Wednesday
at 6 p.m. for the filing of rush com-
plaints. They must be given either
to Cahn or John Phillips, the IFC
rush chairman. Cahn also warned
the fraternities to keep all mafri-
juana smoking out the fraternity
houses.

nomnalions

Cahn announced that
ties must have their

for Homecomings Queen in by the
next Monday meeting along with a
rough sketch of the Homecoming
display. Cahn also plans to have the
2nd annual freshman shoe race.

Newspapers need

of the Ring-tum Phi are in need of
interested students who would like

to work on either staff. There are
several positions open on both
papers. Freshmen are particularly

encouraged to apply for positions.
There are positions open for photo-
eraphers and developers. All equip-
ment except for a camera is furnish-
ed—excellent darkroom facilities are
available. There are also openings
for sportswriters, reporters, news-
writers, and feature writers. There
will be an organizational meeting
for the Tuesday staff this Friday at
5 p.m. and for the Friday staff Tues-
day evening at 5 p.m. Any interested

vich (Tuesday) or Bob Enizminger
(Friday).

NOTICES
Siena Delta Chi will hold an
election meeting in Reid 203, to-
night at 7:30 p.m. All journalism
majors, students with career plans
in the field, and active members are
urged to attend.

date since a constitutional amend-
ment would be necessary.

Vice-President Joe Tompkins
opened debate on the issue of con-
ventional dress in the dining hall.
Tompkins pointed out that the
dormitory counselors desired a
policy statement by the EC. (The
counselors voted 14-6 at a recent
meeting in favor of enforcing the
dress code in the dining hall.) The
last time the Executive Committee
issued a statement on this matter
was early in the Passavant admini-
stration.

Law representative Phil Thompson
moved that the EC adopt the resolu-
tion: “The Executive Committee
supports the dormitory cotnselors
in encouraging freshmen to wear
conventional dress in the dining
hall.” Kevin Baker seconded the
motion, which passed 8-0 with
Kumpuris and Henberg abstaining.

In final action, junior representa-
tive Staman Ogilvie was reappointed
for the second year to study the
feasibility of an independent exami-
nation schedule. Ogilvie did a con-
siderable amount of study in this
area last year.

The Executive Committee is now
accepting applications for the posi-
tion of Interim Chairman of the
1972 Mock Convention. Any stu-
dent may apply, but sophomores
are especially encouraged to do so.
Applications should be submitted to
Chuck Dobbins at the Beta house
before 6 p.m., October 6.

Phi Psis move into new
facility after twenty

years advance planning

The brothers of Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity, Virginia Beta Chapter, at
Washington and Lee are enjoying
the results of advance planning.

Twenty years ago, the house
members foresaw the need to erect
a structure built especially for the
purpose of being a fraternity house,
to replace an old mansion which the
Phi Psis had purchased from WA&L
in 1938 for $8,000.

In October, 1949, a letter went
out to alumni from Charles Gilmore
of Pittsburgh, temporary chairman
of the House Building Fund, an-
nouncing a goal of $100,000 to pro-
vide the needed facility.

As the 1969-70 academic year
began this month, the members of
Phi Kappa Psi are occupying an at-
tractive new chapter house on the
site of the old house at 301 East
Washington Street.

Gilmore noted that during the 20
year campaign, rising construction
costs made the original $100,000 fig
ure insufficient. The university made
a low-interest loan of $60,000 to the
fraternity toward completion of the
project, and efforts are continuing to
raise additional funds from alumni.
Gilmore said the total cost is ex-

pected to be approximaiely $175,000

264 have pledged after Rush Week 1969

Another hectic rush week has end
ed and the race is over. This years
results are listed below. The number
pledging a fraternity is 264. This is
somewhat less than the standard
which is usually close to 80% of the
class. The pledge range in
size from 22 for the SAE’s to 3 for
the Kappa Sigs. There are several
other pledge classes that run a close
second to the leading SAE’s

The following list shows the of
ficial listing of the pledge classes.

ferential ecards of the freshmen

A university center

Just a quick stroll through and a brief glance at the elabor-
ate furnishings of the newly opened student center are enough
to make one feel proud of Washington and Lee. But more
important than the beautiful decor of the center is the long-
needed service it will provide the University.

Washington and Lee has long been in need of a true
center for cultural and recreational activities. The $750,000
Early-Fielding Memorial Building provides the facility for
such a center. The new building offers a game room with
pool, card, and ping-pong tables; a comfortable tavern large
enough to seat 150 people, in which beer and food will be
served; office space for student organizations; color-television
lounges; a chapel, large conference rooms; and a luxurious
library featuring paperbacks and magazines. Mr. Kenneth
Lane, a recent graduate of W&L, will be the director of the
center and in that capacity act as adviser to a student com-
mittee which will provide leadership for center programs. As
we have already discovered, his office door is open to any stu-
dent.

With this major physical improvement, the administra-
tion has superbly played its role in fulfilling another need of
the University community. We earnestly hope that the stu-
dent body will now play its role in taking advantage of the
facilities provided. For only in this way will the new University
Center be just that—a true center.

Number 64 and rising

While we are in the process of mentioning items that are a
source of pride to the University, we would like to point out a
trend about which we may all be justly proud.

For the past several years Washington and Lee has con-
tinued to rise in rank among the nation’s colleges and uni-
versities in average faculty compensation. In a recent survey
of more than one thousand institutions of higher learning
taken by the American Association of University Professors,
W&L ranked 64th in faculty compensation.

In 1967 the University ranked 101st. In 1968 W&L
moved up to 83rd. Last year, we reached 64th with an average
compensation of full-time faculty members of $14,791.

W&L now ranks ahead of many private liberal arts col-
leges of similar size and purpose. We proudly agree with
President Huntley in his statement: “This is certainly one of
the most important aspects of maintaining high quality at the
University.”

Swimln ’70

Washington and Lee is more than just an island existing
within the borders of Lexington, it is a part of Lexington.
Most of the time we are all aware of this distinction, Oc-
casionally, we demonstrate this awareness. At Christmas, for
example, many of the fraternities demonstrate this awareness
by sponsoring parties for Lexington children. Only one camp-
us organization, the University Federation of Concern, de-
votes more than occasional time to the Lexington community.

However, at this moment a fine opportunity avails itself
in which the fraternities especially could make a significant
contribution other than the noise of combos to Lexington. A
group of Lexington citizens has embarked on a fund raising
campaign dubbed “SwimIn 70.” Their aim is to collect
$60,000 to finance the construction of an outdoor municipal
swimming pool, bath house, sun deck and wading pool by
next spring.

Before two years ago, Lexington children had no access
to any swimming pool. For the past two summers however,
W&L has opened the Doremus pool to Lexington. The use
of the indoor pool has been a successful but only temporary
solution to a recreation problem. The outdoor pool would
more effectively fill the gap in the city’s summer recreation
program.

Surely a small cash donation of $100 per fraternity to the
drive would go a long way in meeting the $60,000 goal, and
it would certainly be long remembered.

The Tuesday edition

An old friend warned us over the summer that the days
of fish coming gift-wrapped in Ring-tum Phis at local markets
are not gone yet. We hope they are. In the coming year we
will do our best to see that they are.

This is and will be a student newspaper. Any student is
free—and encouraged—to contribute to the Tuesday Edition.
For our part, we will endeavor to bring to light student opi-
nion on all issues from all angles. Editorials will express the
opinion of the editor-in-chief. Other articles on page two will
relay the opinions of their authors and not necessarily the
opinion of the newspaper. oe

We will endeavor to be as objective as possible in our cov-
erage of news and sports. We will also do our best to publish
total coverage of events relating to W&L.

Our only major innovation regarding content will be the
publication of classified advertising. This is a service long:
needed and long-overlooked by the Ring-tum Phi. Students
may purchase space in the paper on page four at the rate of
three lines for fifty cents.

Your criticism or support in the coming year is equally
welcome.

 

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Faculty active in public service

Washington and Lee University
faculty members were involved in a
wide range of local, state and na-

Mr. Robert Altshuler is on camp-
us for two weeks this fall to deliver
a series of lectures under the general
topic “Acting is Playing”. Mr. Alt-
shuler initiates a mew program by
the Troubadour Theatre designed to
introduce University students to
members of the professional theatre.
Through lectures and workshops
they will explore such phases of pro-
fessional theatre as movement, voice,
directing, and design.

Altshuler, a professional stage
manager, received his training at the
Herbert Berghof Studio in New
York. He has since worked at many
theatres around the country, most
notably the Seattle Repertory Thea-
tre and the American Conservatory
Theatre in San Francisco. Mr. Alt-
shuler has done summer theatre
work with the Stanford Summer Fes-
tival, the Revinia Summer Festival
in Illinois, and the Alleghany Players
in Pennsylvania. In 1968 he was
nominated for a Ford Foundation
Grant.

Included in Mr. Alishuler’s series
will be lectures on theatre games,
improvisations, and characterization.
In addition Mr. Altshuler will hold
individual conferences with those
who are interested.

The lecture series is open to the
University. Those interested in
workshops with Mr. Altshuler are
asked to contact Mr. Lee Kahn at
the Troubadour Theatre immedi-
ately.

There will also be an organiza-
tional meeting for all those interested
in theatre work tonight at the Trou-
badour Theatre. The series for the
year will be discussed and auditions
for the first play, “The Homecom-
ing” will be announced. Other plays
in the Troubadour season will be
Shakespeare's “King Lear” and the
recent broadway musical, “Hair”, if
the rights to the play can be ob-
tained. The last play in the season
has not yet been announced, but in
the past two years the last produc-
tion of the year has usually been
written by a student.

Anyone interested in working in
any capacity for the theatre is in-
vited to attend the meeting at 7:30
tonight in the theatre.

Diversity found
in this year’s
freshman class

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
this year arrive boasting an overall
impressive statistical profile. The
class is composed of 364 young men
from 34 states and six foreign coun-
tries. This wide geographical span
is indicative of the overall student
body and the University’s desire to
prevent being grooved as a southern
school.

The class of ’73 arrived a week
early to attend the 38th annual
Freshman Camp at Natural Bridge.
That three day orientation began on
September 9 and was followed in
three days by the confusing ritual of
rush,

The strong national representation
of the new class is led by Virginia
contributing 60 members. Virginia
is followed by Maryland running a
close second with 41 students. These
forerunners are followed by New
York with 29; Texas, 21; Florida
and Ohio, 18 each; Georgia with 17;
North Carolina, 16; Pennsylvania,
16; New Jersey, 15; South Carolina
and Tennessee, 13 apiece; and Ken-
tucky, 10. Another 21 states each
supply nine or fewer entering men.
The Bahamas, Canal Zone, Chile,
Jamaica, Switzerland and Uruguay
each furnish one apiece.

The ever-increasing role of finan-
cial aid at W&L is evident in the
freshman class. A total of 91 mem-
bers of the class are receiving aid
ranging from $150 to $3,000 for the
session.

The great majority of the students
are public school graduates with
30% having been graduated from
private or preparatory schools, This
reflects another trend at W&L of
more public school students as op-
possed to a past of a larger percent-
age of private school students,

 

 

Broadway Joe at W&L?

By DAVID HIGGINS
Columnist

The name Joe Namath has ap-
peared in every sports section of
every newspaper in America, and
Namath’s picture has been the cover
on many national magazines with a
feature article inside to match. The
name Broadway Joe has come to
stand for a new breed of national
hero—the super athlete with the
super social life. This combination
of muscle and madness is unique on
the national level, but we here at
Washington and Lee should be quite
familiar with the style of the man
called Broadway Joe.

While Washington and Lee has no
Joe Namaths in the super athlete
sense, she does have many athletes
who are of the style which is brought
to mind by the nickname Broadway
Joe. The nationally unique combina-
tion of muscle and madness is com-
mon fare on the W&L campus and
some WAL athletes probably excel
even Joe in the realm of the super
social life.

Of course no one here professes
openly to being a Broadway Joe—
that would be not only conceit but
also reason to question your serious-
ness as an athlete. But the fact re-
mains that Joe's style is definitely
here and has been for many years.
WAL athletes take their sport quite
seriously but taken equally as serious
is their right to a social life. No
one here has to worry about selling
stock options in a bar, but many
of us have to worry about what our
Pete Rozelle will say if we go down

the road on Friday nights. And while
we may not weep on national tele-
vision, many W&L athletes have
been known to leave sports when
they thought the game interfered
with an equally important part of
their lives.

Broadway Joe should not be a
unique type of person to us. Admit-
tedly none of us are at his level of
proficiency, but we all must feel
good to see a man of our style suc-
ceed. And if anyone from another
school asks why our teams don’t al-
ways win, you can ask him in all
honesty what he expects from a team
full of Broadway Joes.

Generals had possibly taken the
ligers too lightly since it was their
first varsity season. Like most state
colleges, however, Towson managed
to pad its locker room with some
notable junior college athletes and
fielded an exceptional team.

Many General doubtfuls managed

day. Among them were fullback

While we're on the subiect, I think
something should be said about the
upcoming game. Randolph-Macon is
one of the better teams that W&L
will meet all year. They were last
year’s small college champs with a
9-0) record and lost virtually no
players. They play explosive ball and
able to come up with the big play at
any time. They are picked to re-
peat last year’s performance and
are a pre-season favorite to once
again win the siate small college
championship. The word from all
over the state is that ther is only
one serious threat to their drive.
That threat rests in Lexington, Vir-
ginia and calls Wilson Field its
home. If you still don’t know who
I'm talking about, it’s the Generals
of Washington and Lee. They belong
to a certain group of students who
go to classes on the WAL campus.
1 think. But of course you wouldn't
know it. Most of the time there are
very few of the students in the
stands. We as students should get
out and support WAL athletic
teams. The teams and coaches de-
serve it and it's a great boost to
school spirit and school unity. Go
ahead and get plastered before you
come over—if that's the only way
you can stand the game. Get out
there somehow and support them.
Like I said it’s your team. Razz the
officials, storm the field, insult the
opponents, Do your thing baby;
whatever turns you on. WAL fans
need a revival and there are enough
good home games this year to really
give us something to yell about yet
not take away all of our energy.
WAL has got the team; let's give it
the support it needs, I'll see you
Saturday at the best game of the

season

Huntley Speaks on Bill

At Committee Hearing

President Huntley told the Senate
Finance Committee that the pro-
posed Tax Reform Act of 1969
would add significantly to the finan-
cial problems of privately-supported
colleges, churches, hospitals and
charities in testimony before the
committee last week.

Huntley delivered the _ official
statement of the Association of In-
dependent Colleges in Virginia, a
26-member organization protesting
certain provisions of the bill which
would end tax exemption for chari-
table deductions.

The reform bill was passed by the
House of Representatives Aug. 7 and
immediately drew strong protests
from private institutions which rely
heavily on volunteer giving.

Huntley labeled the bill as pres-
ently constituted “the first significant
step backward with respect to the
provisions for charitable contribu-
tions during the past 56 years of in-
come tax history.”

While admitting the need for tax
reform, Huntley told the Senate
Committee that the measure passed
by the House would “penalize legi-
timate private philantrohopy and
thus severely cripple private higher
education.”

He called the gains in tax re-
venue (estimated at $5 million in
1970) “negligible when compared
to the financial chaos that will re-

sult for churches, schools, hospitals
and innumerable public charities
that depend on gift support to con-
tinue their services.”

The attack on the segments of the
bill relating to tax exemption for
charitable donations was spearhead-
ed by the American Council on Edu-
cation, which presented testimony
from a panel of professors, univer-
sity presidents and tax lawyers at
the committee hearing.

Although no more appearances
before the committee are scheduled,
all the organizations involved will

be exerting pressure from behind the
scenes, according to Frank A. Par-
sons, assistant to the president.

Parsons said it is likely that many
colleges and universities will seek
aid in opposing the bill from friends
and influential alumni. Private hos-
pitals and churches can also be ex-
pected to play an important role, he
added.

Lobbyists from the American
Council on Education will also be at
work in the Senate in the attempt to
have the provisions of the bill op-
posed by private institutions cut out.

WLUR Adds Shows

The Beatles will highlight the in-
auguration of WLUR-FM’s_ third
year of broadcasting when the sta-
tion’s rock, top 40 and soul music
program, “Saturday's Child,” pre-
mieres the new Beatle’s album “Ab-
bey Road” tomorrow afternoon,

WLUR, the broadcasting service
of Washington and Lee University,
will be unveiling some big changes
in its Sunday programming and
several new shows, according to sta-
tion manager Phil Hubbard.

The Sunday broadcasting hours
have been converted to a regular
weekday evening format (5 p.m. to
11 p.m.) to be run by cadets from
the Virginia Military Institute.

Alumni Tour Campuses

Two alumni of Washington and
Lee University were among the 22
young Republican Congressmen who
made an unpublicized tour of 50
college and university campuses to
seek the root causes of student dis-
sent this summer.

One of the WAL alumni was the
man who conceived the idea for the
tour—Rep. William E. Brock, III,
of Tennessee. Brock, 38, a candy
manufacturer by profession, receiv-
ed the Bachelor of Science degree
from Washington and Lee in 1953.

Open at 5

The contest was originally begun
last spring and five names have al-
ready been chosen from about 30
entries. They are The Tap Room,
The Rathskeller, The Minkskeller,
The Red Rooster, and The Cockpit.
All new entries should be submitted
to the University Center Office by
noon Thursday.

Lane, a 1964 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, was appointed to his
new position last spring. He holds
a Bachelor of Divinity degree from
New York's Union Theological
Seminary and spent the period from
1966 to 1968 working with the Fair-
fax County Public Welfare Depart-
ment,

Lane compiled an outstanding re
cord while an undergraduate at
WAL and was elected to Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership fraternity,

In his new capacity he will have

Sigma Delta Chi

Chooses Byrum

Reed Hyrum, a senior from
Wheeling, W.Va. was elected presi
dent of the Washington and Lee

chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, the na
tional professional journalism soc
iety, at an organizational meeting
this week

Phillip Hubbard, a senior from
Montevallo, Ala., was elected vice
president, Howard Herman, a senior
from West Hempstead, N.Y. was
elected secretary, and James Hughes
Jr, a senior from Richmond, was
re-elected treasurer

Hubbard was chosen to be the
chapter's delegate to the Sigma Delta
Chi Convention in San Diego, Cal
Nov, 15-18. Roy Carlton, a junior
from Syowet, N.Y., was chosen as
alternate delegate

The second W&L alumnus in the
group was Rep. G. William White-
hurst, 44, of Norfolk, a professor
and dean at Old Dominion College.
He received the Bachelor of Arts de-
gree from WAL in 1950, and also
holds the M. A. from the University
of Virginia and the Ph.D. from
West Virginia University.

The group reported 37 pages of
observations and recommendations
to President Richard M. Nixon fol-
lowing secret visits to the campuses
in May. One basic conclusion was
that the causes for student dissent
appeared to be much more deeply
rooted than the Congressmen had
expected,

The Congressmen found wide-
spread criticism from students who
felt unable to communicate with ad-
ministrators and faculty.

“In some cases, the university
structure itself seems at fault”, the
report stated. “In these instances the
modern university is so large, and
decision-making so fragmented, the
student often finds it difficult to

identify the individual or organiza-
tion that has the final responsibility
for a particular policy.

The group asked that Congress
not enact repressive legislation in
order to attempt to “control” camp-
us unrest. Instead, “the fundamental
responsibility for order and conduct
on the campus lies within the uni-
versity community,” the group con-
cluded.

The congressmen also recom-
mended lowering the voting age to
18, reforming the Selective Service
System, expansion of opportunities
for youths to participate in efforts
to overcome problems of society, es-
tablishment of a Presidential Com-
mission on Higher Education, and
improved communication between
governmental leaders and the camp-
us.

The summer issue of College and
University Journal, which features
the Brock tour said Brock realized
he “had no real understanding of
what was happening on the nation’s
campuses” before the tour,

A new show also figures in the
Sunday changes for the school radio,
which officially began broadcasting
this year at 5 p.m. Wednesday. “The
Church Today” will make its debut
Sunday as a 30-minute program of-
fering commentary on the contem-
porary religious institution in
America.

New music shows on WLUR in
clude “International Concert Hour,”
featuring music from five foreign
countries, and “Concert Classics,”
presenting an hour of uninterrupted
classical entertainment.

An educational station should of-
fer its audience several hours of
public affairs programming each
week, Hubbard said, and he feels
WLUR has scheduled some of its
best material in this category for
the coming year.

Along with returning programs
such as “Point-Counterpoint,” “The
Space Story” and “Conversations at
Chicago” come new programs like
“Ask the Professor,” “The Written
Word” and “The Living Law.” Also
new this fall is “Sports Contact,” a
15 minute show which will cover
the local sports scene in an exclu-
sive interview format.

Another show returning to WLUR
is “Fives, Sixes, and Sevens,” a two-
hour show of easy listening enter-
tainment which made its debut on
WLUR last winter “Niteline,” the
“anything goes show,” will be back
in an earlier 7:30 p.m. time slot,

WLUR will continue its policy
of broadcasting all special campus
events, the remaining away football
games and most of the away basket-
ball games this fall, Hubbard said.

A special documentary on the
floods in the local area also has
been planned for the near future.

There will also be special programm-

ing for Nov. 4 to cover the general
election, Hubbard stated.

WLUR broadcasts at 91.5 and is
operated by the Department of
Journalism and Communications of
Washington and Lee University.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-trum Phi
Friday

Friday, September 26, 1969

A Statement of Policy

The functions of a student newspaper
are threefold: (1) to keep the campus com-

munity informed about matters that concern
it; (2) to stimulate discussion on those mat-
ters and (3) to serve as a forum for such
discussion.

Regarding the purely reportoral aspect,
it is the overall aim of the Friday Ring-tum
Phi to maintain the highest degree of accur-
acy and integrity. A major tenet of past
Ring-tum Phi policy has been to restrict news
coverage to events that originate at Wash-
ington and Lee. While our intention this year
is not to supplant the function of the com-
mercial dailies in reporting news occurring
outside the confines of the campus, we do
feel it is a fallacy to assume that the academic
community does not feel the effects, and
should not be aware, of occurrences which
also have a more widespread significance.
Such an arbitrary restriction of scope is also
in the educational sense a disservice in that it
fosters a parochialism which all schools
should seek to overcome. Yet when we do
choose to print news of local, national, or in-
ternational import we will strive, not to parrot
the dailies, but to emphasize the aspects of
greatest significance to the academic com-
munity.

The chief purpose of our editorials will
be to encourage a discussion of the issues
which confront the campus community,
whether directly or indirectly. Controversy is
an unavoidable part of newspaper work, and
forcefully defending the positions we adopt
is a responsibiilty we accept. Yet we shall not
seek to differ, from the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi or from others, merely for the sake of
dissent, and all debates conducted by this
paper will be for the purpose of clarifying

the issues with facts, not obscuring them with
rhetoric. We recognize no subject too sacred
for public scrutiny and comment, but we
realize the consequences of acting irrespon-
sibly in such matters.

The remainder of the editorial page will
be devoted to columns of comments, letters,
and features and articles based on research
into the problems which face W&L. We feel
that in past years many of the cultural op-
portunities this community provides have
been neglected. We intend to rectify this
lack of coverage by providing more reviews
and commentary on these events.

Departing from the carte blanche policy
the Ring-tum Phi has previously extended to
all letters to the editor, we reserve the right to
reject any letter if it contains scurrilous or
irresponsible allegations which could do ir-
reparable harm to innocent parties and pos-
sibly result in legal action against the author.
Our intention is not to silence anyone—we
encourage comment from our readers—or
slight a valid argument, but merely to main-
tain our own integrity by avoiding a sensa-
tionalistic approach. All letters considered
for publication must be signed, but the
author’s name will be withheld at the author’s
request and the editor’s concurrence.

It is extremely easy for a newspaper staff
to measure its own performance in mechani-
cal terms—meet deadlines and smooth inter-
nal operations—and we are not immune to
such pitfalls. In proper perspective we realize
that such matters are only a necessary pre-
condition, and if we become remiss in our
primary responsibilities of reporting, com-
menting and serving as a forum we expect
our readers to reorient us, for it is only by
such reaction that a dialogue can be main-

tained.

Coming and Going

The remarks at right, from two speeches
given here not too far apart historically,
evoke from us some observations which need
to be made before the academic year is any
further advanced.

The frightening condemnation in the
valedictory speech, by someone who was a
great success here according to standards the
University accepts as valid, is that the educa-
tion the speaker acquired was somehow be-
side the point, at least until nearly all his
time here had expired. The final awareness
the gentleman describes offers some en-
couragement, but there remain unanswered
questions.

Why should someone who has evidently
acquired a good deal of knowledge consider
it irrelevant? Must we accept the condition
he describes as a fact of life here?

A significant part of the answer to the
first question lies in the reprinted excerpt
from President Huntley's recent speech. It
may be a cliche to say that a student will re-
ceive from an institution only to the extent
and quality of his contribution to it, but it is
nonetheless true.

We suspect that most of those who con-
sider work here essentially irrelevant or dull
are engaged in the quest for academic honors
rather than knowledge; or they are following
a course of study pursued because it will
prove “valuable,” i.e. lucrative, in one’s ca-
reer and not because of any inherent interest
the student has for it.

Yet just as the gentleman himself offers
the University credit for finally getting across
to him the point of a liberal education, we
will be the first to admit there are deficiencies
and false emphases in the atmosphere the
University provides. That much being the
case, the time to point them out is not at a
valedictory speech, but while one is still an
active member of the academic community,
A liberal education should be stimulating,
enlightening and enjoyable. If it is not, one
should not wait until it is too late to demand
that it become so, nor ought the demand to
be directed entirely to the University, but

also to oneself.

Freshman Camp Remarks . . .

“You, as Washington and Lee students, must not
expect the University to do for you. It is you, the stu-
dents, that must take what it offers, bringing more to
it so that you individually will take away more.”

... And a Valedictory Address

About ten days ago | was studying in that building
up there. It was a warm, late spring Saturday evening.
From the room I was in, | had already heard the voices
of one or two couples—the exam remnants of WAL
weekends. Such an atmosphere never makes for good
studying, but around 9:30, as the last light was disap-
pearing. | seared myself. Not only was | concentrating
well, | was enjoying it. This is an admission bordering
on heresy, but it made the necessary activities of thai
night more bearable. It set me to thinking, too. Why
couldn't it have all been fun?

It seems to me an education should develop the
human being in man. Sort of reluctantly, culminating
in a revelation on a beautiful May evening. I decided
that a man should think. That he can enjoy thoughts
for their own sake and explore every little cranny of
this hill we have here, with pleasure. Only in this way
can a student find himself. I place a high value on
knowing me.

| can remember talking with friends, arguing with
conviction that learning was painful, and that a lot
of what didn't hurt was drudgery. | don't mean that
the whole learning process here has been a bore. Some
courses have been glittering successes, but Washington
and Lee has failed me. Because | can see similar re-
actions of resignation to, scorn for, or detachment from
the academic role of the university, I think it has failed
the class of °69.

Why? I have the highest respect for the ideals of
Washington and Lee. The expressed desire and po-
tential are here to offer a significant education, com-
plete with student-professor contact and policies which
keep in mind the goal of a liberally educated man. Our
athletic program could be, and, in part, is—a striking
complement to this goal. Even some of our traditions,
if they could be brought to life, might be valuable.
That no relevance was given them, and that they are
dead, is another sign of a good idea gone wrong.

So this is commencement, and I'l! be glad to leave,
and to begin, | hope, for | have a vision of what a man
might be if he tries hard enough and I know the atmos-
phere here makes stich achievement just about im-
possible. But to stop and think #bout it, I didn't have
a gimmer of what I thimk | can see now when | came
here. The promise is so exciting that I have to ask how
it got inside me. The only logical answer can be that
Washington and Lee is the reason for its presence.

So maybe I should use the reflection I have boasted
wbout—tight mow. At present, I'm disappointed in
Washington and Lee because of the promises it wasn't
able to keep. But it has shown me what the promises
might be, and has left me aching to get on with the job
of fulfilling it. W and L has made me more aware—
and thats a significant contribution. Maybe it is all the
more noble by not pretending to be a complete, a
final, or even 4 satisfactory answer, So, at my leaving,
at what | really think will prove to be a beginning, I'm
half mad at all those white columns, but half awed by
the gift of those brick walis.

Letters to the Editor...

To the Editor:

“The Tuesday Edition” editorial
in the first issue of the Ring-tum
Phi represents a deficiency that per-
vades Washington and Lee:

“For our part, we will endeavor
to bring to light student opinion on
all issues and from all angles.”
Nifty. Why then did the first page
depict some highly significant events
and personal statements and action,
but the editorial page examine only
one relatively unessential question,
Swim-In °70, and even then not arti-
culate the implications. This is, to
me, uninvolved and unaware, in
much greater than a merely jour-
nalistic sense.

1. Look, for instance, at the ar-
ticle “EC supports counselors’ con-
ventional dress stand”. Please don’t
groan, I will be brief and concise as
possible. I am not quibbling in the
hackneyed manner of protest about
this. I actually don’t care whether
anyone does or does not wear a
coat and tie. | only wish that you
consider the nature of this question.
First of all what exactly is meant
in the wording of the resolution sup-
porting the dormitory counselors by
“encouraging” freshmen to wear con-
ventional dress? Since it is manda-
tory for freshmen to pay a cafeteria
fee with their tuition, what right do
the dormitory counselors have in
ordering, as they have in the past,
an “improperly” attired student from
the dining hall? Furthermore, what
benefit to our academic community
(isn’t that what we're supposed to
be?) do the members of the EC
recognize in conventional dress?
(The recent administrative fund
drives makes the commercial aspect
obvious but not necessarily relevant
here.)
Please, I really don’t understand
this myself. And before you respond
to those questions, tell me:
a) What is “conventional” dress?
b) What specific presuppositions
are involved in looking
“good?”

¢) How is it possible for a person
who cares how he appears to
be insensitive, and unappeal-
ing in his words and actions?

d) Then how should we try best

to appear? What standards
should we use and what values
are proper?

Right about now a curious phe-
nomenon is occuring in some cir-
cles of minds here in Lexington. It
has perplexed me since my fresh-
man year. It is the ignorant and
slightly fearful reaction against earn-
est questions or attempts like the
preceding. It is the general agree-
ment within a group for a group
mentality) to dismiss something as
gauche and therefore not have to
consider it. A clear example of what
I mean is the nickname “Ballsnatch-
ers” given to the Bandersnatch din-
ner-discussion meeting by some of
the more atheletic fraternity com-
radery. It betrays an ignorance of
the literary allusion and what's
more, a “latent” value structure.

It is this attitude of complacent
or negligent insensitivity in the social
and academic aspects of WAL I am
pointing out. This contradiction of
declared intention or policy and ac-

Pinter’s “Silent”
Play Auditions
Next Week

“Harold Pinter is definitely a mo-
dern playwright, but | don't know
how you would classify him. He's
not absurd... .” If anything, ac-
cording to Professor Lee Kahn,
Pinter is silent.

In the first Troub production for
the year, The Homecoming, silences
and long pauses play an important
part in conveying what Kahn calls
“Pinter's concern for the umveiced
mental processes that people under-
go.” Pauses and silent punctuation
become almost unreal in what
seems to be a very real house in
London. In this house, Pinter puts
six characters who are as Kahn puts
iH, “Sterile, frustrated people leading
sterile, frustrated lives.” By the end
of the play. these “sterile, frustrated
people” become almost grotesque be-
cause of the pauses and black com-
edy that Pinter has worked into the
achion.

Production dates for the play are
set for the end of October, and try-
outs for the play will be on Monday
and Tuesday of next week. There
will be an afternoon and an evening
session each day from 4:00 to 5:00
and from 7:00 to 9:00. Mr. Kahn
urges all those interested in trying
out for the play or workine back-
silage on seis or lights to be af the
theatre during these tryout periods.

Although Kahn feels that The
Homecoming is an cxciting work, ne
hastened to add that “unfortunately.
everyone keeps their clothes on
throughout the entire play.” Since
there are five male paris and only
one female part, he fell that if
wouldn't disappoint too many su-
denis.

tual commitment is evident in’ the
editorial page. I guess | am angry
because I first noticed this in myself.

2. It is also obvious in the passive
acceptance of the EC appointment
of the entire Assimilation Committee
to the duties of directing the student
center. Of the twelve committee
members, nine are from below the
Mason-Dixon line, and eleven are in
fraternities. However besides the
question of distribution and bids,
what qualifications or interest do
they have?

3. Consider the IFC article. What
reasons were given for reinstating
the three hour long work periods a
week for freshmen fraternity
pledges—work periods which were
formerly outlawed after faculty re-
commendation? Why are they paint-
ing things and raking leaves again
this year?

Besides the motion for each fra-
ternity to contribute $100 toward
the project to build a municipal
pool, what other programs relating
to the Lexington community are be-
ing considered? Is there any pro-
posed action to aid flood-victims, the

difficulties of the new Boys Club,
or the poverty stricken in the county
or any organization assisting them?

In other words, exactly in what
ways are fraternities conscientiously
relating to Lexington or the “aca-
demic community”?

4. Is “diversity” a geographic
thing?

5. Lastly, I might suggest that
President Huntley “contemplate”

the value of his first compulsory
University assembly address,

I hope by now you see what I
mean. I am not against conventional
dress, the Student Center Commit-
tee, or the IFC, or the Ring-tum Phi.
I am against the contradictory and
unreflective manner prevailing in
our social and academic community
(that is, in ourselves) and the hor-
rifying waste of potential,

Not only is a new kind of involve-
ment needed but also greater clarity
on what an education ought to be.

I have no neat universal answers,
There are none and I hope I haven't
created that illusion. But let us seek
out our own possibilities.

C. Turner

Student Center Features
Concerts, “Bandersnatch”

“Bandersnatch”, a new dinner and
discussion group composed of in-
terested members of the student
body and faculty, met for the first
time Wednesday night in the dining
room adjoining the Commons and
University Center.

The idea behind “Bandersnatch”
is to promote closer student-faculty
relations and to take advantage of
intellectual resources untapped in the
normal course of University life, ac-
cording to its two main promoters,
C. Turner and Pleas Geyer, who
hope to run the program on a regu-
lar basis.

Last Wednesday, Professor Henry
Sloss of the English Department
opened the program with a reading
of his own works written during his
graduate work at the University of
Virginia. In an atmosphere not nor-
mally found in a classroom, some
forty present spent several hours in
general discussion and commenting
on Sloss’ works.

Turner and Geyer are currently
soliciting ideas for similar dinner
meetings, but are hoping that the
program will be self-sustaining and
not require recognized leadership.

“Bandersnatch” is one of seevral
events that have already taken place
at the new University Center. In the
past two weeks, two concerts, one
folk and one folk-rock have been
held in the yet unnamed tap room,
each to an audience of over 200,
Talent for the concerts came from
both Washington and Lee and Hol-
lins College. The first concert was
held September 13, during Rush

Week and the other last Sunday.
Again produced by Turner and Gey-
er, advance publicity was at a mini-
mum.

Mr. Ken Lane, director of the
University Center, has been ap-
proached by several groups, notably
Turner and Geyer, concerning the
possible location of a coffeehouse
within the center. One of the present
meeting-dining rooms between the
Commons and the Center has receiv-
ed tentative approval by the admini-
stration and funds from various Uni-
versity organizations are currently
being sought to complete the room’s
furnishings.

Turner hopes that such a location
would provide an outlet for talent,
particularly in the fields of music
and poetry, on a regular rather im-
promptu basis.

The coffeehouse is but one of
several ideas that Mr. Lane and the
Assimilation Committee are con-
sidering, and several are finalized.
In addition to the recognized activi-
ties (the game room, tap room, and
the like), the center will be utilized
for a Coffeehouse Service of Wor-
ship, consisting of an informal serv-
ice and liturgy, planned for Par-
ents’ Weekend, and coffees, allowing
students to meet with profesors on
an informal basis.

The center maintains facilities for
practically any extra-curricular acti-
vity at Washington and Lee. Mr.
Kane is open to suggestions by prac-
tically any student and/or faculty
groups as to ways to utilize the cen-
ter.

vinced of that than ever. W&L just
barely edged Towson State College,
14-13, last Saturday.

“This is a very inexperienced team
in many areas, particularly on de-
fense and at many back-up positions
on offense,” Coach Leslie observed.

“It is the most inexperienced team
I've been associated with in my 10
years at W&L.”

The General head coach added
that “this will necessitate using fresh-
men more—and using more fresh-
men—than we had originally anti-
cipated.”

Although he was unhappy about
several aspects of Saturday’s game,
Leslie was pleased, naturally, that
the Generals emerged victorious. Ii
was the first time W&L has won an
opening game since 1963, and it
came on the road for a team with
the reputation of winning at home
but losing away.

“I’m real happy with the way our
boys came back to win it,” Leslie
said. W&L trailed Towson, 13-7,
after three quarters, but marched
80 yards for the winning touchdown
with eight minutes left, then held off
repeated Towson efforts to salvage
the victory.

spring.
Omicron Delta Kappa, a national
honorary leadership _ fraternity

founded at Washington and Lee in
1914, was the leading such organiza-
tion at Vanderbilt, according to the
Delta Review, a monthly magazine
published in Mississippi.

Explaining the move, Acting Presi-
dent Pace VanDevender of Jackson,
Miss., was quoted in the review as
saying the members of the frater-
nity have been “earnestly attempting
to justify the society's existence and
have been unable to do so.”

VanDevender said the reasons for
closing the ODK chapter “stem from
the nature of the present student
leader, as compared to that of stu-
dent leaders of Vanderbilt's past.

“When these men were of like at-
titudes and were motivated partially
by the prestige and status of being
known as a leader, the honor of
ODK membership was welcome and
perhaps useful to its members.

“Today, the student leaders are
more diverse in their ideas and poli-
tical stances, and are motivated by
the idea of contributing to the uni-
versity and to its students, rather
than by the status that leadership
may bring.”

VanDevender said another factor
in the decision was the danger “of
excluding the more individualistic
leaders” because of the subjective
form of membership selection.

“Being out-personneled in spots
by Towson was somewhat of a sur-
prise, although not a complete one,”
Leslie commented, “But we KNOW
we are going to be out-personneled
by Randolph-Macon.”

The Generals entertain the Yellow
Jackets Saturday in their home open-
er at Wilson Field, with the kickoff
at 2 p.m. W&L hopes to avenge last
year’s 45-21 loss at Ashland,

“We know they will put a lot of
pressure on our defense,” Coach Les-
hie said, “That Howard Stevens puts
a lot of pressure on anybody's de-
fense.”

The key to any Generals’ success
probably will be in stopping Stevens.
He ran wild last year against W&L
en route to piling up 1,468 yards
rusing and 142 points for the sea-
son, both tops among the nation’s
small colleges.

Injurywise, the Generals fared
okay last Saturday—with one excep-
tion. Starting guard Ned Coslett was
lost for the season with a knee in-
jury which required surgery.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Thieves chagrin

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, September 30, 1969

Some reflections of our own

We read with much interest the thoughts expressed by
Mr. C. Turner in his letter to the editor published in The
Friday Ring-tum Phi. It cannot be intelligently refuted that
the five questions he raises are important to the Washington
and Lee community. While we do not necessarily agree with
some of his implications pertaining to these issues, we must
concur, as Mr. Turner pointed out, that there are “no neat
universal answers.” Yet surely feasible solutions must exist.
We do in fact consider it part of our task this year to aid the
process of learning what the most workable answers to these
problems are. We cannot provide those answers.

Keeping this purpose in mind, we were delighted that we
were able with our first issue of the year to generate some
response from at least one member of the student body. For,
as we stated last week, we welcome and encourage your criti-
cism or support. However, we were alarmed at Mr. Turner’s
charge of “complacent or negligent insensitivity in the social
and academic aspects of W&L” on the part of the Tuesday
edition. Does Mr. Turner really expect the small handful of
students, who are also part-time newspapermen, that consti-
tutes the Tuesday staff to be one-hundred percent “‘aware’”’ of
every single issue that confronts every single student in the
University? We would indeed be flattered if we could
measure up to this expectation, but unfortunately we are only
human.

We can, however, lament the fact that there are not more
C. Turners in this school—that is, more students who are
willing to sacrifice a few precious hours of prime T.V. time to
contribute to the paper. Only with this condition can The
Ring-tum Phi rise above mediocrity and develop into what it
ideally should be and do what it ideally should do.

Granted we may not see eyeball-to-eyeball with Mr.
Turner on all of his observations. And we cannot see eyeball-
to-eyeball with every student, not even on something as simple
as the definition of issues. Still, the fact remains we cannot
intuitively know what you are thinking. “We will endeavor
to bring to light student opinion on all issues and from all
angles.” Nifty? Yes, it is. But student opinion is not a tangible
item that we can concoct in the newspaper office on a Monday
night. Our capabilities extend only to reporting the facts and
to offering our own opinions—it is up to you to let us know
what yours are.

Therefore we encourage you to think about and invite
you to write about the questions posed by Mr. Turner, as
well as any other issues that may exist. Is conventional dress
relevant to the academic community? Is it important to be
clean and neat? Do the seletcion methods of members for the
standing committees of the student body need to be improv-
ed? Are selections really handled along social fraternity lines?
Has the Assimilation Committee outlived its usefulness? Why
were work weeks initiated for pledges? How far should social
clubs or fraternities go in participating in community affairs?
Should there be ion rush? September rush? no rush?
Was last year’s valedictory address valid? Co-education at
W&L? And so on and so on. ...

We confidently suspect that no student is immune to all
of these problems. Can you expect the faculty, or the EC, or
the IFC, or even the Ring-tum Phis to alone arrive at adequate
solutions to these problems? We cannot put any of these ve-
hicles in motion unless you first turn on the ignition.

A widening of horizons

Hats off to the Executive Committee . . . particularly to
Messrs. Bethea, Dobbins, Baker, Azuma and Henberg, who
voted last night in favor of accepting the resolution printed
on page one of this issue.

There are several important implications regarding this
resolution that must not be overlooked. Not the least of these
is the point raised by Mr. Staman Ogilvie, that certain stu-
dents may use this as a pretense for cutting classes and that
would be as far as their involvement would go. We hope that
no one takes such undesirable liberty. Fortunately, the resolu-
tion does not direct students toward a specific action such as
not attending class. It calls for seletive, individual appraisal
of the situation in Vietnam. We hope that the student body
justifies the confidence the EC has placed in them, and decide
for themselves on a rational basis whether or not to partici-
pate in the moratorium.

Perhaps even a more significant implication contained in
the text of the resolution is the precedent of widening the
horizons of the Executive Committee to an area of concern
previously regarded as taboo.

“Whereas conscious that its role need not be limited
strictly to affairs on our own campus but must sometimes
include the concerns of university students everywhere,
the Executive Committee feels it is important for indivi-
dual students, whatever their opinion, to examine periodi-
cally our country’s involvement in the war.”

It is all too easy to become bogged down in daily life and
let that war going on somewhere across the globe slip to the
backs of our minds. But the war is being fought, and there is
not a student here that is not affected by it in some way. We
might even suggest that the war is something more real to
most students than, say, the Cold Check Committee. Yet, in
the past the war has been largely relegated on a formal basis
to the status of that-which-may-come-up in class. It is very
encouraging to see that the EC has taken a step to emphasize
the closeness of this national problem to our campus.

at only squeaks
at gates of hell

By David Higgins
Columnist
Last year I was warned that “the

gates of hell will open first in Lex- }

ington, Virginia.” The man who told

me this was obviously dramatizing |
the faults of our little sin city, but ,
it is quite true that certain unsanc- '
tioned activities, including thievery, ,
do occur here. Two areas of this }

permanent form of borrowing affect
the Washington and Lee community
directly, and are more extensive
than we perhaps imagine.

One area of indiscriminate prac-
tices is the sale of used furniture.

Some of these businessmen enjoy |

the profits of selling the W&L stu-
dent his own property. One second-
hand shop which I visited last year
was selling, at quite
prices, chairs with our school mono-
gram sprayed on the back. In ad-
dition a foot locker with the name
and address of a student on it was
for sale, again at a very reasonable
price. The student in question had
“lost” it some months before.

Due to obvious bookkeeping prob-
lems, these establishments usually
keep their doors open for only a
few months, these being quite logi-
cally the first ones of the school
year. When questioned the proprie-
tors claim at having found the ar-
ticles discarded . . . or unguarded.

A second area of profit for these
gentlemen is the fraternity house
and its parking lot. The criminals
here are usually young boys who
with a little nerve and some dark
socks manage to gain browsing
rights at most houses. There is a
guideline which they follow, and
this is that houses containing un-
rowdy members are usually the
easiest to survey at will. Consequent-
ly some houses are victimized more
than others. For the most part the
thievery is of minimal importance,
but occasionally a coup of criminal
excellence does occur, as when a
color TV was procured in tact.

Consequently the thief to us is
really only a pesky nuisance and of
no permanent affect, thanks largely
to Bob Murray. If the thieving ele-
ment were to use a little more
imagination and planning, I can
think of many ways that they might
well increase their turnover. Until
then, however, | am afraid that,
much to my friend’s chagrin, the
gates of hell are merely faintly
squeaking around us, and that we
are really not going to be the second
Sodom.

Whitehurst talk

covers weighty
national topics

By Cy Dillon

Monday evening second district
Congressman G. William Whitehurst
spoke to a group of Young Repub-
licans, faculty, and interested stu-
dents on recent action in the House

Spence calls for forums

in classes on 15 October

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Gentlemen, as we look around us
certainly we can perceive that we
are in the age of public action. Ap-
proximately one week ago there ap-
peared an advertisement tacked up
on the bulletin board in front of
Payne Hall. The advertisement was
extracted from the previous Sunday
New York Times, and it advocated
a national strike by college students
and professors on the fifteenth of
October {to protest American in-
volvement in Viet-Nam.

Students and professors across the
nation have reacted to this in a
variety of ways. There are those
who want a strike that will boycott
classes that day and others who
would desire to take over their par-
ticular institution to make it an

 

anti-war headquarters, However
many have answered this call in an
alternative and more responsible

fashion. The alternative is to have
Teach-Ins on their respective camp-
uses, One such school in our area
that will have some form of a
feach-In is Hollins College.

There are many students here at
Washington and Lee that are con-
sidering a class boycott or similar
action in sympathy with the move
ment. It is questionable in this ob-
server's mind as to whether we

Lee’s facebook machine
to enhance the bookstore

As every new year begins, there
goes with it a frantic search for face-
books from the girls’ schools. It was
this mad scramble three years ago
that prompted Bob Lee, a Sigma
Chi senior, to do something about
it.

Lee has devised a machine which
contains facebooks from the most
heavily dated girls’ schools—Mary
Baldwin, Sweetbriar, Randolph-
Macon, and Hollins. The machine
is nearing completion and will be
placed in the Bookstore in the co-
op Wednesday or Thursday of this
week, Lee has been working on it
for a year or so and his project has
been kept classified.

The machine works on much the
same principle as the record selec-
tion part of a juke box. The box
contains an electronically timed light
and upon inserting a quatrer in the
machine, the viewer finds all four
facebooks at his disposal, and he is
able to flip through them for two
minutes.

Much of the holdup in the com-
pletion of the machine was due to
lack of parts, The electronic timing
device took some time to get; it was
finally obtained from a chemical
plant. The machine would have
been ready sooner this year, but it
had to be cut down to fit in the
available space in the Bookstore.

Hillard strikes a blow
for peace demonstration

Foes of the Vietnam war are
planning to tell President Nixon on
Oct. 15 that it is time to bring the
boys home. A nationwide campaign
of anti-war demonstrators is being
planned, with the major thrust ex-
pected to come from college camp-
uses throughout the country.

Nixon has said that he will not be
affected in the least by the demon-
straions—but he cannot mean it.
The President of the United States
must take note of public opinion.

Just how effective the demonstra-
tions are will depend on three fac-
tors: how widespread the partici-
pation is, how much coverage it gets
from the news media, and how well
organized the rallies are.

The first two questions can be an-
swered at this time, a fortnight be-
fore the event.

Anti-war demonstrations will be
present on almost every campus in
the nation, At least one million stu-
dents will protest American involve-
ment in the war. The Vietnam con-
flict is the most unpopular, tragic

would gain anything from an empty
or half-empty school. I think not.
However, I do believe we could all
learn a great deal from each other
and our professors if we were to
hold a Teach-In on the fifteenth of
October.

The War is pressing in on all of
us here at WAL becatse as it goes
on we will continue to supply our
graduating seniors to fight in the
war, Whether one believes the war
right or wrong it is obvious to all
that we are going to lose many of
the future leaders of this country as
long as H continues.

In a close community such as
there is at WAL we have a greater
opportunity to reach each other
concerning the pressing issues that
confront us, However, this oppor
tunity is wasted if we do not put it

1 think we have an opporiunity
fo get a wealth of fact and opinion
from each other and the faculty if
we have a school-wide teach-in on
October 15. Therefore | would like
to request all faculty members to
cancel their lecture or test for the
fifteenth of October and have each
class become an open forum through
which we might all learn together
concerning this most pressing issue
of the war in Viel-Nam. | hope that
as a result of such a day that we

and utterly ridiculous episode in
United States history. Casulty fig-
ures continue to mount. The Paris
Peace Talks drag on, making abso-
lutely no progress. And most tra-
gically, the war is no nearer a mili-
tary conclusion than it was four
years ago when President Johnson
decided to escalate.

Americans are becoming more and
more unanimous in their opinion
that an “honorable settlement,” the
goal of the present administration,
cannot and will not ever be reached,
and only by a complete unilateral
withdrawal will the United States be
able to free itself from the conflict.

Nowhere is this belief stronger
than among the nation’s college stu-
dents. They will let their voices be
heard Oct. 15,

When millions of Americans sit
down in the evening to watch Walter

they will view filmed reports from

And the T.V, will definitely be on in

But how the students conduct their
demonstrations will be all important.
Peaceful demonstration is a corner-

concerned with law and order will
not tolerate anything less than a
peaceful demonstration.

Staff editorial

Take a stand

It seems that today Washington
and Lee is in the midst of a period
of change and subtle upheaval. The
reference here is specifically aimed
at the fraternity system. There are
forces on this campus that would
cheerfully see fraternities wither and
disappear. These forces, incident-
ally, are not just composed of non-
fraternity men. It is not believable
that all non-fraternity men would
gleefully see fraternities die at WAL.

The fraternities are, to a certain
degree, united by the IFC. How-
ever, there seems to be a great de-
gree of hypocrisy in the actions of
this body. This judgment is based
on past years in hopes of a change
in the future,

This body for several years has
had rules passed to make pledging
at W&L look mild, extremely civiliz-
ed and humane. This editorial is not
written to take a stand on the way
pledging should be conducted but to
point out the incongruity in a sys-
tem where members of each fra-
ternity get together to vote to out-
law any form of hazing (any physi-
cal or mental discomfort or danger),
set up stiff fines for violations, and
then promptly go back to their
houses and violate these rules —
sometimes in blatant openness.

The conclusion can only be that
these rules and regulations are pass-
ed and approved only to appease
an often anti-fraternity administra-
tion. This course of action seems
terribly hypocritical and certainly
unbecoming a gentleman (which we
pride ourselves to be). The com-
ments in this editorial seem obvious
but it seems that every student
should think about this subject,
make a decision and decide to stick
by it whether at an IFC meeting or
a House meeting.

Officially hazing has been long
abandoned and yet in reality it exists
in almost every house on campus.
Admittedly hazing is not what it
used to be but that is not the sub-
ject at hand. The point is that a
man of strong moral fiber should
make a decision and then in sticking
by it follow a consistent line of
action regardless of his surround-
ings. Any other line of action seems
to be cowardly and untrue.

If the past is repeated in years to
come regarding this subject it will
hasten the demise of fraternities at
this institution. The path of hazing
cannot be followed and the sooner
this is realized the better it will be
for everyone. The rules that the IPC
has set up to regulate pledging are
excellent—it is up to the general
body of fraternity men to uphold
them and the IFC to enforce them.

Inscribed Frost
book discovered

It is not too unusual to find auto-
graphed copies of books—especially
those of obscure authors—but it is
certainly unusual to stumble across
a book which is autographed by a
well-known poet containing a revi-
sion of an earlier poem in his own
writing.

The McCormick Library's copy of
Robert Frost's West Brook,
donated to the library by John M.
Glenn, bears the inscription “For
Mary Wilcox Glenn from Robert
Frost.” Contained on page fifty-five
of the book in a revised form is the
poem “The Egg and the Machine,”
which first appeared in The Second
American Caravan, published in
early 1928. The poem appeared in
the 1930 Collected Poems in the re-
vised form and under the title “The
Walker.”

Dr. Sargent Bush, on leave this
year from the English Department,
has been researching the value of
the inscribed poem. Dr. Bush has
been in contact with the librarian at
Amherst College, one of the colleges
with an outstanding collection of
Frosiania, From Amberst he found
that it was not unusual for Frost to
inscribe the first few lines of a poem
on a blank page in one of the books
he gave to friends, such as he did
in Mrs. Glenn's copy. However, the

Thunder’s Theories

used to be to theatre nuts. From the
pleasant surroundings of your fra-

Jayvee football set back

Washington and Lee’s jayvee foot-
ball team lost to Massanutten Mili-
tary Academy, 44-0, on September
26, and the cliche, “chalk it up to
experience”, was not too shop worn
to be used here. W&L was simply
outmanned and outplayed. The
game was a learning experience, and
so it was with dry eyes that Coach
Poudrier commented about the jay-
vees and their opening game.

“W&L played good football. The
boys learned their fundamentals, and
it was a good game to iron out mis-
takes. They gained experience as a
team and at the college level.”

Without making excuses, Poud-
rier observed that Massanutten is
the equivalent of a junior college,
and that many of its players have
played college ball previously. The
big thing for W&L, Poudrier felt,
was that instead of continuous, non-
competitive practice sessions which
could become dull, the jayvees got
some football experience under
game conditions. The experience
and further practice, noted Poud-
rier, will make a victory a more
plausible goal in the jayvees’ next
game with Augusta Academy on
October 24.

Washington and Lee posted a
victory in its first outing of the
soccer campaign, Coach Joe Lyles’
team had to overcome the disadvan-
tages of a visiting team and a last
period deficit to take Pfeiffer College
with a 4-2 score.

Pfeiffer jumped ahead 1-0 in the
first quarter, but the Generals evened
things up at a goal apiece. Going
into the fourth period Pfeiffer once
again held the lead 2-1. Suddenly
momentum, that indefinable force,

Whitehurst talk

covers weighty
national topics

(Continued from Page 2)
students at Old Dominion College
in Norfolk. Elected to the House in
1968. he is a junior member of the
influential Armed Services Commit-
tee. =

The speech had been publicized

as being on the possibility of a vol-
unteer army, but Rep, Whitehurst
felt that “you cannot speak fifteen
or twenty minutes on that.” How-
ever, he did express mixed feelings
on the subject of the draft, and
stated his own support for a lottery
system.
“According to Rep. Whitehurst
there is a change in the draft law
on the way, but a volunteer army
is opposed for two reasons—first,
today’s draftees are excellent sol-
diers; second, many military and
civilian leaders fear the narrowness
of a professional army.

The only hint Rep. Whitehurst

would give us as college students for
the future was that the situation
looked bright for those past nine-
teen. Don’t drop out of ROTC yet,
though; the nature of the change is
still completely in doubt.

Rep. Whitehurst went on to ex-
plain the recently proposed changes
in the method of electing the presi-
dent, and gave an account of the
House’s passage of this bill. He then
expressed support for the  Presi-
dent’s foreign policy, and for the
administration in general. Rep.
Whitehurst feels that President
Nixon has “not deviated from his
goals” in dealing with the world
situation, The Congressman holds
that Mr, Nixon will get the U.S. out
of Viet Nam, and preserve the
honor and prestige of the country in
the treaty creditability—but, it will
take a good deal of time.

As Representative for the second
district in Virginia, which includes
large Navy and_ ship-building  in-
stallations, Mr. Whitehurst favors
maintaining a strong merchant fleet
as well as a substantial military sea
power. He gave insights to the
state of our surface Navy and sup-
ported the development of more
nuclear striking power.

The atomic capability of the
USSR was vividly portrayed by Rep.
Whitehurst. He stressed the need
for continual research and develop-
ment on the part of the United
States in conventional as well as
atomic Weaponry.

The most striking point of his
series of remarks was that nothing
can guarantee peace for our nation
but military superiority, One must
be a realist, Mr. Whitehurst con-
tends, “It’s not a matter of being a
hawk or a dove, but—my God—a
matter of defending the country.”

keep Stevens, who showed as much
lateral as forward speed, from carry-
ing the ball 26 times for 168 yards.
At the half, the Generals were down
22-0.

In the second half, Jack Baizley
came in to spur the Generals of-
fense to life. Twice the Generals
were able to score and add the two
point conversion. The Macon de-
fense toughened, however, and the
Generals found points and valuable
time hard to come by.

The Macon loss, like any loss,
was hard to swallow but like any
other sting, the swelling soon goes
down and you look ahead to avoid
being stung again. This week's op-
ponents for the Generals are last
year’s co-champions of the CAC and
the pre-season favorites to win again.
They are experienced and strong,
both offensively and defensively,
and are indicative of the strength
that dwells in the CAC. I am speak-
ing of the Colonels of Centre Col-
lege who will invade Wilson Field

coming, fans. The turnout for last
week’s game was good. It should be
better this weekend; so come on out
and scream your heads off and we'll
give you next weekend off.

By the way, if you think W&L
was badly beaten, try some of these
scores: 62-0, 77-14, 63-14, 49-7,
and how about 52-14, Colt fans?

Doremus Concert Tonight

A Friday night concert, alumni
reunions, and a football game with
Centre College will highlight this
weekend’s Homecoming actiivties.

Also scheduled during an unusu-
ally busy weekend are meetings of
the University’s Board of Trustees
and a dinner Friday night in Evans
Dining Hall given to the Trustees
for the Robert E. Lee Associates.
The 193 associates are persons who
have supported the school in an ex-
ceptionally generous way.

The main feature of the weekend
for students will be lan and Sylvia’s
concert in Doremus gymnasium at
8 p.m. Friday. This is the first time
a concert has been provided for
Homecomings, according to Dance
Board president Dean Kumpuris.

The major reason for a concert
this weekend is that the Dance Board
feels students shouldn't have to wait
as long as in the past to appreciate
the benefits of the dance plans they
have purchased, Kumpuris said.

Kumpuris suggested that those at
tending the concert dress casually

SIPA Convention Shifted

Management and sponsorship of
the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association (SEPA) has been shifted
from Washington and Lee University
to the University of Georgia by
agreement between the two univer-
silies.

Founded at Washington and Lee
in 1925, SEPA brings editors of high
school publications from Southern
and border states to an annual con-
vention at which leaders in the com
munications media speak and evalu-
ate student work. About 1,200 per-
sons have attended each convention
in Lexington in recent years.

Details of the shift of sponsor-

Davis said that under the W&L—

more than a decade the annual
spring SIPA convention has taxed
to the utmost the facilities of both.”

“Our alternatives seemed to us to
be limited.” he added. “One was to
impose drastic restrictions on at-
tendance at SIPA. Another was to
move the convention to a summer
date. Obviously either would have
altered radically the character of the
association.

“Realizing this, we slowly turned
our thinking to a third possibility:
that we transfer SIPA to a larger
institution with greater and more
fiexible facilities.”

Davis said the decision was reach-

hours of thought and consideration,”

tion that only by transferring the

its objectives be furthered and its
continued growth assured.”

October
Meeting

By Walt Potter

Stall Reporter
Rumbling noises are beginning to
be heard around W&L’s campus as

the proposed October 15 nationwide
moratorium draws near.

A small group of students and
faculty have reserved Lee Chapel
for all day Sunday to hold an or-
ganizational meeting, among other
things, to try to coordinate all the
various campus groups who are
planning action on the 15th.

the group has also reserved Lee
Chapel for 2 p.m. on the 15th for
an as yel undetermined action.

\iso planned at the Sunday gath

the morning with the possibility of

ihree more. Discussion groups afe

dence.” The Henry W. Grady School
is “outstanding,” its faculty has
broad experience in communications,
and the Athens campus is well suit-
ed for increasing opportunities for
an improved convention, Davis said.

The faculty member at the Uni-
versity of Georgia who will be in
charge of SIPA will be Dr. Jeff
Clark, professor of journalism there.
He will serve until a permanent di-
rector is named. Dr. Warren K.
Agee is dean of the Grady School.

The first convention of SIPA was
held on April 5 and 6, 1926. Con-
ventions were held annually until
1942 when travel restrictions and
other war-time difficulties caused a

suspension of activities until the
1946-47 school year.
In recent years, distinguished

journalists who spoke to the high
school editors at the Lexington con-
vention included James _ Reston,,
Marquis Childs, Howard K. Smith,
and Tom Wicker.

and bring blankets to sit on, since
no formal seating will be provided.

This informality is a deliberate
change of pace, Kumpuris said. The
format is intended to be reminiscent
of that of last year’s “Love-In 69”
at Fancy Dress,

Kumpuris added that this is the
only concert scheduled for the gym
this year. All others will be in the
fieldhouse at Virginia Military In-
stitute, since that building has better
acoustics.

Admission for students without
dance plans will be $10. However,
Kumpuris said anyone who wants
a dance plan but does not have the
$40 now should contact him or talk
to someone at the door. An arrange-
ment for a student in such a situa-
tion to get a dance plan now and
pay when he has the money will
then be arranged. The concert will
be another event open to the ap-
proximately 400 alumni and _ their
wives expected to be at the re-
unions of the academic and law
classes of 1924, 1934, 1939, 1949,
and 1964.

Fall class reunions are being
started this year in an attempt to
increase the opportunity for alumni
to return to Washington and Lee
for reunions, explained William C.
Washburn, alumni secretary.

With reunions of five classes con-
tinuing to be held in the spring, this
new program will make it possible
for an alumnus to return for a re-
union every fifth year, he said.

Ihe weekend begins for alumni
at 2 p.m. with registration at the
Alumni House lasting until 4 p.m.
From 3:30 to 5 p.m., Dr. Ollinger
Crenshaw, Professor of History and
University Historian, will be in the
University Bookstore to meet alum-
ni and autograph copies of General
Lee’s College, his history of W&L
which was published earlier this
year by Random House.

From § to 6 p.m., a cocktail party
honoring alumni will be given by
the Rockbridge County alumni chap-
ter at the Alumni House. Refresh
ments will be served at the Alumni
House at 10 p.m. after the concert.

A discussion of “Timely Topics”
will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday
in Lee Chapel. The topics are wheth-

The group, whose principal mem

in the week.

The students, at a meeting Wed

The group also plans to promul-

gate a university siatement on the

fhe statement is slated not to be
extremely pascifist, but still more
anti-war than the President's posi-
lion.

Other possible actions include

Special guests at the dedication
will be the families of the two bene-
factors who made the Early-Field-
ing Memorial Building, the Student

Bequests by Mrs. Annie Fielding
Early of Washington, D.C., and her
daughter, Mrs. Annie Early Fairfax
of Washington, D.C. and Roanoke,
Va. provided the funds to build the
center.

The Washington and Lee Band
will make their first appearance this
weekend at the game. Unlike previ-
ous years, where the band has actu-
ally been nothing more than an ex-
tension of the ROTC band, the band
this year has become an integral
part of the University, and hoeps to
have uniforms shortly.

At 2:30 p.m. at Wilson Field, the
WA&L Generals will play the Home-
coming Football Game against the
Centre College Colonels of Ken-
tucky.

WLUR-FM, the university-spon-
sored radio station, will provide its
first play-by-play broadcast of a
home game when W&L meets Cen-
tre. Jay Dorman and Waugh Crig-
ler, both former members of the
football team, will be the station's
announcers.

A party for alumni will be held
at the Alumni House after the game.
At 7 p.m., the Reunion Classes will
hold their anniversary banquets at
various locations in Lexington.

Friday

Friday, October 3, 1969

On October 15

The Executive Committee’s resolution calling student
attention to the proposed anti-war moratorium on Oct. 15
is bound to cause a lot of comment.

Many will say that the EC exceeded the limits of its duties
and responsibilities in dealing with a matter not explicitly
assigned to it by the Student Body Constitution. Both the
EC and the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi have, we believe, effec-
tively refuted this argument.

On the other hand, probably equal numbers will con-
clude that the resolution is too weak considering the magni-
tude of its subject. We think not. A stronger resolution might
have failed, and the historical significance alone—that the
EC has finally broadened its scope to a degree approaching
awareness—is great enough to admit compromise for the
sake of its passage. More important, of course, is that it
neither forces nor advocates a particular viewpoint, which
would have been presumptuous. Rather, it reasonably and
fairly suggests individual thought and action on the matter.

Both these extremes, we feel, are minorities. There is a
strong possibility that the majority will decide whatever ac-
tion taken on Oct. 15 will be of no consequence to continu-
ed involvement in the war, and therefore will do nothing.
Such a position is both false and dangerous. This protest
promises to be the best organized and most widespread effort
in a lengthening list of demonstrations against the war, and
as such cannot help but attract the attention of the shapers
of foreign policy. The participation of such schools as W&L
is particularly crucial, however, if this demonstration is to
carry the impact that it might, and it is for that reason we
fear the cynicism that could minimize the response here.

We suspect dissatisfaction with the war is quite prevalent
even at W&L, but largely because of a combination of apathy
and patience it has yet to manifest itself to any meaningful
extent. Precisely because W&L and schools like it have been
detached up to now would the participation of a large number
of their students have perhaps a greater effect on the nation’s
leaders than mere lack of numbers, and hopefully of vio-
lence, might lead one to believe.

The EC would have been remiss in a basic obligation to
remain apolitical had it called for a definitive and public—
though peaceful—gesture from every individual who dis-
agrees with U.S. involvement in Vietnam. We operate under
no such restrictions, and we advocate that action.

A Bad Sign

If the most recent Interfraternity Council meeting is
any indication of the direction—or indirection—that group
intends to pursue, there is little doubt in our minds that abso-
lutely nothing of any significance will originate there this
year.

The only unambiguous action occurring Monday night
was merely an announcement regarding CONTACT assess-
ments. The rest of the meeting was marked by a chaos we
could hardly believe, and the only actions proceeding from it
were not only confusing but for the most part the result of
breaches in Roberts Rules of Order, and hence their validity
is questionable.

The casual manner in which President Chuck Cahn han-
dled the most important matter yet to be considered this year
is a case in point, but by no means the only example. We are
speaking, of course, of the move to reform parietal regula-
7 ;
tions applying to fraternity houses. The Judicial Board's
proposal was, in the first place, an afterthought, since the
first meeting of the Student Affairs Committee had already
passed before the IFC moved to take any action in its own
behalf.

That could be excused. After all, the proposal can’t be
voted on by the entire faculty until this Monday.
Thus the week of inaction by the IFC caused no real delay in
the proposal’s implementation, provided it does pass at the
Monday faculty meeting. What is crucial, and may conceiv-
ably be calamitous, is the fact that the proposal is scantily
worded, nearly an exact copy of the revised dorm regulations
and offers those regulations as its only real defense. There are
many good reasons why parietal regulations ought to be re-
laxed, but the proposal overlooks most of them. Moreover,
the conclusiveness of the vote taken is open to question, since
the number of affirmative votes was not recorded and a call
for negative votes either was not made or was inaudible,

Clearly, Cahn was operating under two assumptions:

(1) that no fraternity is against the proposal, and

(2) that the faculty will inevitably pass it.

He is no doubt correct in his first assumption, but that is no
excuse for the casual manner in which the voting was handled
A unanimous vote is much more convincing than simple
passage. If his second premise proves likewise correct, and
we sincerely hope it does, it will be the result of the faculty's
innate sense of fairness and not because of any action the
fraternities, through the IFC, took in their own behalf,

Fraternities are becoming increasingly embattled at Wash.
ington and Lee, and if they are to maintain themselves at all,
it will be through collective and forceful action. The IFC ap-
pears unwilling to provide it.

I’m sure Black students would love it in Lexington

The Admission Dilemma

By RICHARD CAPRON

Washington and Lee University in

its present catalogue claims “to
seek candidates for admission with-
out regard to race, color, religious
creed, or national origin.” It claims
that its students not only represent
broad geographic, but also broad
“social and economic cross-sections
of the United States.” On the other
hand, Washington and Lee has at
the present time only two black un-
dergraduates. There seems to be a
discrepancy between statement and
actuality. Wanting answers to some
questions in my mind, I stopped by
the office of James Farrar, Dean of
Admissions, last Tuesday.

This past year a grand total of
five black students applied for ad-
mission, Four were accepted, All
four, though they were offered gen-
erous financial aid, turned down
WAL to go to northern colleges.
This was a hard blow to the Admis-
sions office.

Swallowing defeat, the administra-
tion has begun to intensify its ef-
forts to recruit poor white and black
students. Through the National A-
chievement Scholarship Program,
which supplies lists of qualified and
commended students, and the OPEN
program, which seeks out inner city
youngsters with promise, strides are
being made in this direction.

Project Access, an organization
mothered by the College Board serv-
ice, also helps identify those deserv-
ing studenis by means of a series of
tests. There is even a program that
will help to waive the test fees for
those who cannot afford to pay.
Other endeavors such as Upward
Bound improve the educational stan-
dards of under-privileged high
school students by summer study at
various colleges and universities.

However, programs such as these
are only secondary. Washington and
Lee is going to a professional agency
that deals with the problem, but so
are dozens of other colleges. The
competition in this area is extremely
intense.

Somehow there must be more di-
rect contact with the individual gui-
dance departments and the high
school students themselves. This
year with additional staff personnel,
the Admissions office is hoping to
increase its visitation potential, es-
tablishing contacts with some of the
public high schools where they
haven't been before. Through the
College Night programs in Rich-
mond, Norfolk, and other cities, the
University is able to make some
headway.

But this is the limit of the admini-
siration’s efforts in seeking a more
diverse student body. It seems that
nobody is addressing his actions to
the question of why black studenis
would rather go to a comparable
northern school than to WAL.

The answer is quite simple. Very
few black or poor white students
want to go to a school whose en-
vironment is only adopted to the
middie and upper class white. As
one black student who graduated
from a white prep school said,
“Sometimes I just like to see a
sroup of black faces.”

So it not only becomes a problem
of seeking these studenis, but also
of providing them with some sort
of acceptable social atmosphere. In
conjunction with this. | would like
to see the administration and the
surrounding girls’ schools, most of
whom face the same problems that
WAL does. join together to visit
various Cities throughout the region,
conducting forums and group coun
seling sessions. This would at least
show an active concern for their
social. as well as economic and
academic welfare.

Another difficulty arises when one
asks the question of how many
blacks want to come to a school
with an all white faculty. | think jis

about time the department heads
got busy looking around for black
professors as well as white. Com-
petition for qualified black profes-
sors is as tough as it is for the stu-
dents, but with a faculty whose
average salary is far above the na-
tional average, there must be some-
body willing to teach here.

Another possibility that has not
been sought out as actively as it
could is that of encouraging the
graduates of two year institutions
(junior and community colleges) to
complete their education at Wash-
ington and Lee. Many students who
cannot qualify with their high school
records get to college and find they
can do much better. Those young
men who have themselves at the col-
lege level should become prime tar-
gets for admission.

As a last desperate attempt at
bringing some color to Washington
and Lee, the administration might
try to institute a foreign exchange
program with any of the predomin-
antly black universities. Perhaps
black students might not mind com-
ing here for a semester or two to
receive credit,

In finishing my talk with Dean
Farrar, | asked him if he forsaw
any problems if W&L is unsuccess-
ful in enrolling blacks. To this he
replied that he thought the student
body would be missing a vital part
of a liberal education in our modern

To Sleep,

world, where understanding the
black is becoming more and more
important. This is most assuredly
true,

I wonder, however, how long
Washington and Leet is going to be
able to isolate itself from the grow-
ing impetus of radicalism on Ameri-
can campuses. Several questions re-
main unanswered in this regard,
How long will SDS and the various
militant groups allow our lily white
school to continue, before it starts
to take action? How long will our
own students tolerate this discrep-
ancy between policy and practice?
How long will it be before W&L
confronts the demands of our rest-
less social structure? Time grows
short.

 

To the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi

It is quite interesting to analyze
the speech of the valedictorian of
the class of 1969 (printed in the
Sept. 26 R-tP) in terms of how fully
his words may express the despair
of the great majority of students at
WAL. It is a very disappointing ex-
perience to realize that when we
finally attain the material goals that
we set before ourselves, or more
aptly our society sets before us,
that our inner longings and dissatis-
factions are still unabated. The vale-
dictorian is a near perfect example.
He had reached the top of material
achievement—he had a straight 4.0
average Over his college career, he
was a member of the Executive
Committee, he was an outstanding
athlete for the football and track
teams, he was chairman of Contact,
and even was nominated for a
Rhodes Scholarship. He was every-
thing that the world could ever ex-
pect a man to be and yet he is
obviously quite dissatisfied with his
plight. But he falls into the usual
trap of placing the blame of his des-
pair upon the university or just the
world in general; this is very false
and yet we all tend to do this. In-
stead shouldn't we all look not at
the external world for blame but at
our own values and purposes in life.
Obviously self fulfillment is not to
be gained in external achievement;
but perhaps the answer lies in being
“transparent” with all our weak-
nesses “before the Power that posit-
ed us” as Kierkegaard expresses it.
In any event we can’t hope that the
world or this university has been
created to satisfy our longings and
despair, the problem is a lot deeper
than that.

Rush to Judgement

By Dave Olson

Hopefully we have seen the last
of the old rush system. After a hec-
tic week of rush dates, bids and
other boring details it is apparent
that it is now time for the rush
system to change at W&L. Last year
the IFC failed to institute a plan of
deferred rush. With academic pres-
sures increasing yearly, deferred rush
is now, not a luxury, but a necessity,

W&L remains as one of the few

Perchance to Cut?

By Lawrence McConnell

Ihe War in Vietnam has been
forensic fodder for at least five years
in all parts of our country, but it is
imMeresting to note that in the year
of our Lord nineteen-hundred and
sixty-nine, the debate has finally
blossomed into prominance in the
WAL community.

Not only has the topic of Viet-
nam reached the supposedly un-
aware masses in our community, but
also we have the innovation of a
new debate: where and how the de-
bate on Vietnam will be conducted.
In fact, the only agreement you
will find in the W&L debate on the
debate on Vietnam is that an ad in
the New York Times started it all.

The story here starts with the
EC's resolution which called for
everyone's awareness of the Vietnam
problem on October 15. At this
moment, the word moratorium be-
gan floating about as a result of the
New York Times’ ad which called
for a faculty and student boycott of
classes on the 15th.

Active anti-moratory forces have
been the voices of Junior EC mem-
ber Staman Ogilvie, who said that
& moratorium would be a good ex-
cuse for students not to attend class
that day, and Jeff Spence, whe wrote
to the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi calling
for an in-class “Teach-In" on that
day. Then there was an abstaining
voice on the EC, that of Vice Presi
dent Joe Tompkins who refused even
fo vote on the whole matter

Wednesday night the pro-mora
tory ranks met to discuss the organ-
ization for their planned meeting on
Sunday afternoon at 2:00 in Lee
Chapel. With approximately 75
anti-war people assembled and three
AOl-sO-anli-war personages, the ga-
thering attempted to organize the
program for the October 15 mora
torium. During this portion of the
Meeting, the major organization
man seemed to be Pete Zimmerman
who proposed a schedule for the
15th and a presentation that he gave
to the faculty EC yesterday

Towards the end of their Wednes
day nighi meeting. the three moder
ates Were asked to leave because the

anti-war group wished to form plans
of their own for the 15th.

This was a singular event, especi-
ally after Pete Zimmerman had
commented earlier Wednesday that
“this is neither an anti-war nor a
pro-war demonstration. Call it a
“Think-In.” We are trying to avoid
any bias, and are doing our best to
get speakers to represent all posi-
tions.” Though the speakers may
represent all positions, the eventual
audience that Zimmerman and his
people may draw on the 15th will
be defeating the only vaguely valid
purpose of the whole attempt.

If Zimmerman and others plan to
carry off an event of any magnitude
at all, the coordination of those
pro-war, moderate, and anti-war is
essential. If this coordination does
not jell (and after Wednesday night,
coordination doesn't look possible),
then the validity of all those anti-
war people who want to spend Octo-
ber 15 discussing and demonstrating
their disgust with the War seems
questionable at best.

Zimmerman and others say they
are trying “to bring groups to-
gether.” And if the convocation on
October 15 is to be a success in any
sense, they can’t afford to lose any-
one interested

Whatever happens, October 15
will come and go. Some students
may go to the proposed discussion
group; others may attend class: and
there will almost definitely be some
who won't set their alarm clocks the
night before

A Word of Warning
To W&L Activists

\ word of caution for WAL's
“ive students on the 18th of
October: the city of Lexington’s
anti-litter law forbids the distribu-
ton of handbills on the streets of
Lexingion, The reason? Once the
handbills are given out, they tend
to be thrown away on the streets by
the recipients, hence the person dis-
tributing the handbills is, in effect,

littering

colleges in America with such an
intensely short rush, which is a bur-
den on the freshmen, the fraterni-
ties and the administration. With a
longer rush period the freshmen
would get a better chance to get a
true picture of the houses they visit
and the fraternities could see the
rushees in a better perspective. The
present rush system is conducted at
a very high pitch, It is very pres-
surized. With a longer rush system
the whole atmosphere of rush would
become more casual, friendly and
a lot easier on nerve ends. It would
be much harder for the houses and
the freshmen to “put on airs” and
the true character of a house or
rushee would shine through.

One of the arguments that fra
ternities have long used against de-
ferred rush is that they would be
overburdened financially. They
would be without the income from
freshmen house bills for the entire
first semester. But with deferred
rush the very large expense of a
week-long rush could be spread over
an entire semester. Of course this
does not balance out and there is no
feasible way this money could be
obtained; it is just a question of
whether or not the fraternities are
willing to make the sacrifice and
adopt a system which is to their ad-
vantage.

It is very easy to criticize, but
what about concrete suggestions?
The best way to handle deferred
rush would be to spread it out over
the entire first semester with pledg-
img permitted at the beginning of
the second semester, Instead of open
houses we could substitute longer
“smokers” — lasting approximately
ninety minutes. The freshmen would
sign up for these in much the same
way as they did for open houses.
As in the old system a rushee could
then be invited for longer “happy
hours” or for combo parties. Again
as in the old system liquor would be
permitted during the “happy hours”
but not at the “smokers”. rhe “smo-
kers” could take place twice a week
{fo get in the required nunrber of
houses in a feasible length of time)
and combo parties could be sche-
duled as in the past with the “happy
hours” once a week after the “smo-
kers” have been completed, With a
longer period of time in between
these gatherings the handling of
dirty rush and no contact becomes
more important to the successful
operation of rush. The freshmen, as
it is NOW, are separated from the
rest of the stuednt body. The only
Way to handle this is to have no
contact, outside of rushing, for the
entire first semester, The freshmen
would have to satisfy themselves
with what the student union can pro-
vide, The acquisition of dates could
be handied by a bus service or fresh
men could be allowed to have cars.
The student union and dorm parie
tals were instituied for the express

WEL Soccer Team Remains Unbeaten
In 4-0 Victory Over Hampden-Sydney

Washington and Lee’s young soc-
cer team upped its record to 2-0 by
defeating an inexperienced yet tough
Hampden-Sydney team 4-0 on Octo-
ber 1. After leading by only one
goal at half time, the Generals open-
ed up the game in the second half
by scoring three times.

Dave Manson put the home team
ahead with 5:55 left in the second
quarter when he got credit for a
goal that actually went into the
Hampden-Sydney net off one of the
H-S players. Manson, a sophomore
inside right, was given credit for the
goal because he had been the last
WAL player to touch the ball

The Generals did not waste any
time, however, in stretching this
lead to 2-0 once the second half be-
gan. Don Belt received a beautiful
pass from freshman right
wing, Tom Krampfmuller, and Belt
did not miss the mark with a perfect
head shot,

Eleven minutes later, Carl Hyatt,
the left halfback let go a fine loft
shot that the Hampden-Sydney

goalie had no chance for. The ball
sailed high into the netting, and
WAL led 3-0.

An extra insurance goal was scor-
ed by John Yow, senior left wing,
with 16:40 left in the fourth quar-
ter. Yow beat the H-S goalie with a
quick shot on the right side, giving
the Washington and Lee team its
fourth and final goal.

After the game, Coach Joe Lyles
was asked if he now thought W&L
could continue this balance of of-
fensive punch and fine defensive
play.

“We'll just have to wait and see.
This is a very young team,” Lyles
replied. “Em certainly pleased,
though, with the improvement that
the fullbacks and halfbacks have

made since the first game. Brian
Price and Mark Sayers played es-
pecially well.”

The team has been drililng this
past week on the weaknesses that
were evident in the first game against
Pfeiffer College. “Getting the young
players reading the field and the
movements of their own teammates
correctly is one of our biggest prob-
lems,” remarks Coach Lyles. When
the team achieves this, the other
weaknesses as listed by Coach Lyles,
(finer touch on passes from backs to
insides and wings, better field bal-
ance) will probably iron themselves
out,

Ihe next game for the soccer team
is Saturday against Madison College
on the Eastern Mennonite field.

Washington and Lee will open its
1969 College Athletic Conference
competition tomorrow by playing
host to Centre College’s high-scor-
ing Colonels in the annual Home-
coming game,

Che Kentuckians were pre-season
favorites to win the CAC conference
crown, and as Coach Buck Leslie
said today, “they backed that up
last Saturday by beating Southwes-
tern, 21-7.” Centre and Southwes-
terdn shared the conference cham-
pionship last year,

Early scouting reports and films
“show that Centre has a good foot-
ball team, to say the least,” Coach
Leslie said. “They have 25 letter-
men back, they have a lot of scor-
ing potential (49 points so far in
two games), and they can play good
defense as well.”

Despite last week’s disappointing

loss to Howard Stevens and his
Randolph - Macon teammates,
Coach Leslie and his Generals are
“not discouraged.”

“We know we are inexperienced
in a lot of areas,” Leslie commented,
“but we think we are making im-
provements.”

One such area is in the passing
department, now that senior quarter-
back Jack Baizley appears fully re-
covered from a pre-season broken
hand. Baizley got the stalled W&L
offense in gear against Randolph-
Macon, completing nine passes for
69 yards en route to both touch-
downs,

Besides Baizley, Coach Leslie
singled out for praise halfback JoJo
Martin, who gained 69 tough yards
on the ground; pass catching ends
Steve Mahaffey and John Thomas;
fullback Doug Gossmann for his

W&L Football vs. Notre Dame’s?
Well, It’s A Thought Anyway

Editor's Note: The following is a
reprint from The Courier-Journal,
Louisville, Ky. The story was run
on September 25 of this year.

What's the difference between
scholarship and non-scholarship
football?

Money, perhaps. One institution
seems to have as much fun as an-
other. They have similar worries
about injuries, next opponents and
overconfidence.

The alumnus of Washington and
Lee (no scholarships) delights in
victory as much as the alumnus of
Notre Dame, whic his generally re-
garded as the symbol of bigtime
football.

We listened to the voices of Ara
Parseghian, coach of Notre Dame,
and Buck Leslie, coach of Washing-
ton and Lee, yesterday morning.
Parseghian, whose home attendance
was 366,450 last season, was just
as worried about upcoming Purdue
as Leslie, home attendance 15,000,
was concerned about Randolph-
Macon.

Football is a great common deno
minator. It makes friends of kings
and paupers. Not that Washington
and Lee is a pauper. It has chosen
de-emphasized type football and ap-
pears to like it,

Said Leslie:

“We don't want to lose a single
game but we have to face up to it:
Competition for the student-athlete
is great, and here we are, pioneers
in the business of not giving any
athletic scholarships. If we consis
tently play .500 football or better,
this is what we call success.

Leslie and the other W and |
couches recruit young men with ath
letic ability just as hard as any
other college coach. He and his
stall are constantly in correspond
ence with prospects.

“Washington and Lee is a great
educational institution with a rich
tradition and heritage,” said Leslie,
who can be excused if he sounds
like a handout from the university's
public relation soffice. He is a W
ind L graduate
This is what we have to offer a

see him that day at practice.”

Looking at emphasized football,
Notre Dame and other big time
schools resent the thought that they
are football factories. They enroll
students, too, and they'll compare
curriculums with any de-emphasiz-
ed plant.

While Leslie is quivering about
Randolph-Macon, Parseghian fears
Purdue, as did Chicago’s Alonzo
Stagg before him.

Why worry with a program that
attracted a total of 15,000 spectators
last season compared with Notre
Dame's 366,450?

Leslie has the answer.

“We feel that our program is a
vital outlet for the energies of these
young men. As long as there are
good sports programs in colleges,
the hippies and the yippies are not
going to take over this country.”

rhe spirit is the same, whether
the crowd is 2,500 or 60,000.

blocking, and guard Staman Ogilvie,
from the offensive team.

On defense, Leslie cited his trio
of defensive backs, John Nolan,
Dave Brooks, and Lee Graham, and
end Scott Neese. Brooks and Neese
are just sophomores.

Giving credit where it was de-
finitely due, the W&L coach praised
the Jackets’ Stevens highly. “He
could play on any team in the
country,” Leslie said.

“Without Stevens, it should have
been a fairly close game,” the W&L
coach continued. “He just has too
much speed. In order to pursue him,
we had to gamble and not rush the
passer, so they hurt us with their
passing. Credit that to Stevens too.”

The Centre-W&L contest stacks
up as a close affair. Both teams are

now I-l for the season. Centre,
which won last year, 10-0, on its
own field, appears to have the

stronger team. But W&L has the
home field advantage.

And another thing: it's W&L’s
Homecoming. The Generals seem to
play inspired ball before the return
ing old grads. Kickoff at W&L’s
Wilson Field will be at 2:30 p.m.

Dance Policies Discussed

By Monty Cottier

The imminence of this year's
Homecomings Weekend once again
brings the Dance Board into the eye
of the W&L student. As there have
been changes made in the operations
of this body, as well as some poss-
ible misunderstandings, the Ring
tum Phi selected this Homecomings
edition to examine the current state
of the Dance Board’s yearly plans,
and re-state some of the new rules
concerning admission prices and
transferral of dance plans,

Although the totals at our
posal do not include the last weeks’
sales, nor door receipts, the rough
total for this year is slightly less
than three-fourths that of last year,
and must finance an additional week-
end,

or a combination of the two.”

“A program of this nature we be-
lieve would indicate our humanitar-
ian concern with the war and at the
same time serve the University’s in-
terest in furthering our education.”

In the area of transferring dance
plans to other students for concerts
which a student will not attend,
Dean Kumpuris, Dance Board presi-
dent, reminds, “This is an honor vio-
lation. The EC voted on this last
year, and this is what they decided.”

Although plans have not vet been
made for all of the weekends,
Homecomings, with Lan and Sylvia,

will cost about $3500; Openings will
run $8500; and Fancy Dress, with
Count Bassie at $3500 and an
other band not yet formally con-
tracted, have been fairly well plann-
ed through. Springs and Finals have
not yet been booked, as the Dance
Board wishes to see what name
bands or groups will be playing in
the area at those times,

no reason why it should not work
here. Obviously this system does
present some problems but | feel

these problems are far outweighed
by the advantages of the system. It
is, | believe, a system which is bet
ter for both the fraternities and the
freshmen. It is a much more casual
set-up than before and would be a
lot less intense. Last year the IFC
voided the question, but now, with
the student union completed, there
is no substantial argument that could
be offered aaginst a deferred rush
system. The old sysiem is antiqu
ated, expensive and unwieldy. 1 be
lieve any new system to be an im
provement. Academic pressures are
increasing yearly. This, combined
with pledge responsibilities, might
be too much to handle if a freshman
is to be successful. Further, the stu-

dent union can fulfill the social
needs of the freshmen. It is now
time to change if the fraternity

system wishes to prolong its life on
this campus.

Alumni choose Nuckols to
serve on Trustee Board

 

E. Marshall Nuckols, Jr., senior
vice president of the Campbell Soup
Co., is the first member of the
Board of Trustees of Washington
and Lee University to have been of-
ficially nominated by the organized
alumni of W&L.

The election of Nuckols was con-
firmed by the Board of Trustees at
its meeting during W&L Homecom-
ing in Lexington this weekend.

Washington and Lee alumni of
record nominated Nuckols by mail
ballot this summer ina race that in-
cluded two other alumni. The elec-
tion was part of a far-reaching plan
of reorganization of the Board of
frustees which was adopted by the
board at its May meeting.

One purpose of the reorganiza
tion was to provide more direct
alumni voice in the affairs of the
University. The plan calls for the
election every two one
trustee who has been nominated by

years of

the organized alumni. Under this
procedure, the 19-membert board
will have three alumni-nominated
members by 1974

Nuckols, $7, a native of Louis
ville, Ky , received his B. A. degree
from Washington and Lee in 1933
and his LL.B. degree in 1935

After graduation from WAl
Nuckols was associated with the
law firm of Covington and Burling

in Washington. D.C., from 1935 to
1942, when he joined the Campbell

Soup Co. Nuckols, who has risen
steadily in the executive ranks of
Campbell Soup Co. now lives in
Newtown, Pa., and works in Cam
den, NJ He has been active in
civic and business affairs

He is a director of ihe First Cam
den National Bank and Trust Co

and is immediate past president of
the National Canners Association
He was president of the United
Fund of Camden County in 1963-64
and was chairman of its
in 1965

In addition, Nuckols was
tor of the National

directors

i direc

Association of

Manufacturers in 1961-63, and is a
chairman of the Upper Makefield
Township Board of Supervisors in
Bucks County, Pa., a member of the
Bucks County Park Board, and a
past chairman of the Upper Make-
field Township Planning Commis-
sion.

Nuckols is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Or-
der of the Coif, and Alpha Tau
Omega social fraternity, He is a
former member of the Washington
and Lee Alumni Board of Directors,

IFC endorses
Oct. 15 group

by sixteen votes

Ihe IFC last night passed by a
i6-1-1 margin a resolution endors-
ing the activities of the October 15
mor committee. The mora-
scheduled to conflict with
the morning classes, features a “non-
partisan” approach to the war. C.
lurner. in introducing the resolu-
tion to the IPC, termed the frater-
nities the “largest total structure of
our school” and hoped that they
would support the moratorium.
Only 16 affirmative votes were cast,

d students,

girls are approved on upper floor

In meeting yesterday, the faculty
approved a report by the Student
Affairs Committee calling — for
changes in faculty regulations gov-
erning fraternities. The changes had
been requested in a petition from the
Interfraternity Council.

The content of the resolution
which was approved is as follows:

“To (1) achieve greater freedom
and responsibility for those students
living in fraternity houses, (2) attain
a situation of equity in parietal
regulations for fraternity members
vis-a-vis those students who live in
University dormitories, and (3) pro-
vide an incentive for the integration
of classes in the fraternity houses by
encouraging greater numbers of
juniors and seniors to live in the
fraternities, with the realization that
such housing is more convenient and
less expensive than other student
housing, the IFC petitions that the
following resolution be adopted by
the faculty of Washington and Lee:

“A. Female guests may be allow-
ed on the upper floors of the fra-
ternity houses between the hours of
5 P.M. on Friday and 12 Midnight
Sunday, with the understanding that
overnight visitations are prohibited.
IFC regulations will permit such

visitations until 3 A.M. on Friday
and Saturday nights.

“B. The Executive Committee of
each fraternity will propose a plan
concerning hours to the entire fra-
ternity which must reach a consensus

on the plan, which they will abide
by during the academic year.

1. A consensus will constitute
agreement of at least 75 percent of
the members of the fraternity.

2. Standards of gentlemanly con-
duct, which reflect a sense of ap-
propriateness and decorum, and a
concern for the rights and sensibili-
ties of others are to be observed.

3. Each plan shall include adequ-
ate provisions for enforcement by
the fraternity.

“C. The Judicial Board of the IFC
will approve or reject each frater-
nity’s proposal, Each approved plan
will then be submitted to the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee for review.

“PD. Violation of these regulations
will result in Social Probation for
the fraternity, the length of time
depending upon the extent of the
violation.”

The faculty last May adopted new
social regulations permitting students
in university dormitories to draw up
plans for visitation by female guests
during weekend hours. Until today’s
action, faculty regulations had pro-
hibited visitation by female guests
above the first floor of fraternity
houses. The prohibition will be lifted
as soon as individual fraternities
submit acceptable plans for approval
by the IFC Judicial Board and by
the Student Affairs Committee.

in another business matter, the
faculty adopted a report of the Stu-
dent Financial Aid Committee which

spells out changes in regulations re-
garding student ownership of cars,
to be effective the second semester
of the 1969-70 academic year. The
statement of new policy reads as
follows:

“Although the committee consid-
ers that ownership and/or control of
a motor-driven vehicle of any type
by the recipient of financial assis-
tance will bear directly on the degree
of financial need demonstrated,
such ownership and/or operation is
not prohibited during periods for
which awards have been made—pro-
vided, the applicant or recipient
makes full, written disclosure of all
relevant facts bearing on such own-
ership and/or operation, University
automobile regulations notwithstand-
ing.

“If a student keeps a motor ve-
hicle in this area during the school
year, the Committee ordinarily will
add the ‘Blue Book Value’ of the

motor vehicle to the student's as-
sets, and the student's financial aid
will be reduced by the usual frac-
tion of student assets used by the
College Scholarship Service: sopho-
mores 14, juniors 1/3, seniors, 4.”

In another matter, the faculty con-
sidered and acted on a_ student's
petition regarding proposed Vietnam
moratorium activities in Lexington
on October 15.

A petition to the faculty Execu-
tive Committee from Peter F. Zim-
merman, a W&L junior from Gar-
den City, N.Y., requested that fac-
ulty be given the option of dismiss-
ing their classes on October 15 and
that no tests be given on that day.

In response, the faculty Executive
Committee adopted this statement
“In view of the activities scheduled
for October 15, the Executive Com-
mittee wishes to remind each mem-
ber of the faculty of his option to

McCall announces VP's
and cocktail party plans

By Reed Byrum
Mike McCall, Sophomore class
president, announced — preliminary
prepaartions for Openings ‘69, Octo-
ber 17 and 18. A Phi Gam from
Louisville, McCall also released the

names of his seventeen vice-presi-
dents who will assist him in the
arrangements for the weekend.

Plans have been made for a cock-
tail party on Friday afternoon from
2:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. A pink
lemonade and grain concoction,
reminiscent of last year’s Springs,
will be the featured drink, with the
Kallabash Corporation providing
background music. The affair will
take place in Red Square behind the
Beta House.

McCall disclosed the theme of
the dance set to be “Today, Tonight
& Tomorrow,” signifying the timing
of the weekend. The concerts will
commence at 8:00 p.m. both Friday
and Saturday. Decorations will con-
sist of a simple black backdrop.

In anticipation of the weekend,
the Sophomore class organized a
drive to gain parietals for fraternity
houses. A petition was presented to
the faculty for consideration yester-
day and was passed on affirmatively.

The vice-presidents were chosen
by the members of their own house,
rather than by McCall, Vice-presi-
dent of the Class is Steve Robinson,
a Phi Psi. In charge of the decora-
tions will be David Harbert, Phi
Gam, and David Comiey will make
arrangements at Red Square for the

cocktail party: Rob Turnbul will
head the liquor committee.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW aud OUTLOOK Leééters to the editor...
SwimIn ’70, moratorium--pro

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, October 7, 1969

In fairness to all

In the past week, a lot has been said and much has been
done concerning Washington and Lee and October 15. Time
alone can judge the value and meaning of these efforts.

However, we can at this early date commend the fairness
and respect for the opinions of others shown by many groups
which have become involved in this issue. Especially note-
worthy in this regard was the position taken by the faculty.

The faculty statement, drafted by the Faculty Executive
Committee and approved by the faculty as a whole, does not
direct anyone to a specific course of action. Rather, the policy
statement—which parallels in its open tone the resolution of
the student Executive Committee—leaves the final judgment
on the moratorium to the discretion of the individual. A pro-
fessor may dismiss regular classes “for justifiable educational
purposes.”

We, as responsible students, must also respect the convic-
tions of others. We must not interfere with another’s right to
attend class or to hold class, nor with his right to gain edu-
cational benefit otherwise on October 15, if he wishes.

New gym key

Moratorium-con
Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I read with disappointment the
resolution recently passed by the
Executive Committee encouraging
selective participation in the pro-
posed October 15 moratorium. I
cannot concede that the proper juris-
diction of the Executive Committee
extends to expression of views on
national and international political
questions. While the resolution falls
short of calling for a general boy-
cott or cancellation of classes, its
general import is to place the stamp
of approval of the Washington and
Lee student body on the proposed
moratorium, With the undoubted
controversy and ill will generated
among alumni and friends of the
university by this resolution, the
Executive Committee has committed
a clear abuse of discretion by an
action which can only be detri-
mental to Washington and Lee.

I also wish to protest the action
of the administration in allowing
the moratorium committee to have
exclusive use of Lee Chapel on
Sunday last. Being proud of this uni-

verstiy and its heritage. | had hoped
to show my visiting sister-in-law and
her husband our famous Lee Chapel.
Although there are a number of
meeting rooms in the new Student
Center in addition to numerous
classrooms on campus which would
have been sufficient for the number
of persons attending the meeting,
Lee Chapel was reserved exclusively
for the use of this committee. In
that absence from class as an eX-
pression of political belief would
not seem to coincide with the aims
of this university, at least in my
mind, the giving over of our most
famous and precious facility to a
group advocating this action is at
odds with common sense.

SwimIn ’70

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
Your editorial in support of Swim-
In ‘70 is very much appreciated.
Over $13,000 has been pledged so
far and we are still hopeful that the
goal will be reached, as many gifts
are still being received and they

can be pledged over a three year
period.

This awareness of the community
on the part of the student, bodes
well for many healthy encounters in
the future, similar to the fine work
done by the students for the Lexing-
ton Boys Club and other proejcts.

Moratorium-pro
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

For four years I had been among
those who futilely encouraged the
Ring-tum Phi to expand its jour-
nalistic ken beyond who-pledged-
where. Consequently, | was delight-
ed to notice upon taking up your
last issue that the ban on reality had
been lifted. Staring us in the face
were two articles “reporting”, each
in its own way, on the local efforts
to organize a non-partisan Day of
Concern on October 15. One reading
of these journalistic efforts, however,

and con

succeeded where the spectacle of
four years of bland mediocrity had
failed. It convinced me that the pro-
per province of the R-t-p really is
trivia.

I must admit that my original im-
pulse was to credit the morass of
misrepresentations and falsehoods I
encountered to premeditated and

deliberate malice. On — second
thought, though, I realized this

could not be so. A conspirator, be-
ing human, would have made at
least one small mistake, would have
allowed one small truth to slip past.
Such consistent and total deviation
from the facts could, I concluded,
only be the product of absolute in-
competence,

I am afraid readers will hardly
believe me (even I still find this
situation incredible. I think we
Americans have a residual faith in
our news media, the truthmakers)
but | am compelled to attempt to
repair the damage done to a con-
structive and diligently prepared pro-
gram which is of significant potential
value to our community, I will not

to WGL athletic future

Editor's Note: The following is transeribed from a
taped interview of Mr. Gene Corrigan taken by Logan
Scott and Bob Yevich. Mr. Corrigan assumed the
duties of director of intercollegiate athletics and head of
the department of physical education here in early
April.

Formerly administrative assistant to Atlantic Coast
Conference Commissioner James H, Weaver, Corrigan
began his college teaching career at W&L in 1955, In
1958, he moved to the athletic department at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, where he remained until 1967 when
he joined the ACC,

INTERVIEWER: Mr. Corrigan, have you noticed any
significant changes in Washington and Lee now that
you are back here as Athletic Director?

CORRIGAN: No, not significant, but I think there
have been some changes.

Of course, one significant change | think Washing-
ton and Lee needs is this new gym. | remember the day
1 came back, as | drove up to Doremus Gymnasium
| thought, what in the world am I doing here—this
has got to be the worst building in the world. There
haven't been any great changes in athletics, although
things have levelled off performance-wise.

When I left here basketball had been very good,
and had just started going down; the subsidized athletic
program had ended but we still had subsidized teams on
the schedule: football was just horrible—in the three
years | was here we only won one or two games—so
things have levelled off from that standpoint.

 

INTERVIEWER: Generally speaking, since you have
had expericnce in the “big-time”, how do you think the
small college system of athletics compares to that of a
large university?

CORRIGAN: Well, let me say this, when you talk
about “big-time” athletics, you are only talking about
iwo sports, and usually you are only talking about one
—football

Big-time athletics, and this is strictly a personal
opinion and | might be one hundred percent wrong,
but big-time athletics belong to big schools, and |
mean big enrollment state-sponsored schools.

Try to find a major college football team among
the small private schools. 1 just do not think you can
because they have all drifted away from it. They had
io—which brings us up to your point what is the differ-
ence between the two. Let's take Duke University as a
good example, they have been very prominent in
basketball in the past few years, Our basketball pro-
gram, and football, is very different from their pro-
gram—in emphasis, money, and a lot of other things

But the rest of our program is basically the same
They don't give scholarships in tennis, golf. wrestling,
soccer or lacrosse or even in baseball that | know of
So we're interested in starting a good recruiting pro
gram to help us compete with Duke in those sports on
un even basis, And | think we can, because we did
before when I was here, We could beat them in soccer,
and we always beat them in lacrosse

INTERVIEWER: Do you personally feel that the non-
subsidized athletic program we have here is the best
program for W&L?

CORRIGAN: I don’t know if it’s the best way; I think
it’s the only way. I don’t know if Washington and Lee
could afford it otherwise. My feeling is that when you
sit down and start to calculate, W&L just could not
stay in the business. To be competitive in football—and
by that | mean competing with UVa, Duke, and places
like that—you would have to give at least 120 football
scholarships. At the cost of going to school here, that
would run $3400-3500 per boy per year. This means
close to a half-million dollars before you bought a
uniform, paid a coach, or did anything. Then, who is
there to watch you play. We've only got 12,000 living
alumni, and as many of them live on the other side of
the Mississippi as on this side. So you have no constitu-
ency. Besides, where are you going to build a stadium
in Lexington?

I think the Washington and Lee program is good.
But let me say this, any program on any level is only
good as long as you are winning; if not, then it’s not
a good program.

INTERVIEWER: Would you say there is any differ-
ence in spirit between the athlete here and the “big-
time” athlete?

CORRIGAN: | do not think there is a whole lot of
difference in the athlete. | don't think there is really
any difference. Some of the boys here might even have
a little more character than some of their counterparts
in the bigger schools, although that’s not really fair to
say. That would be a selfish obesrvation on my part
because I'm here now. But is the atmosphere here
different? Holy cow, yes. The University of South
Carolina, for instance, has a 140-piece marching band.
Why they spend as much money painting the football
field as some schools spend on their whole football
program.

INTERVIEWER: Are the coaches and teams here
under the same strain to win as they are in the big con-
ferences? That is, is the emphasis here upon winning
“per se” or is it on individual enjoyment and satisfac-
tion?

CORRIGAN: | think being able to win is more im-
portant here because it’s more personal. Our boys de-
vote a lot of time to athletics, time which could easily
be spent doing something else, but they enjoy playing
sports .. . | think the pressure is the same, but for
different reasons, such as personal pride, which really
is the best reason. If you mean some alumnus getting
on our backs, sure, our alumni would be concerned
and ask why if we lost badly, But I don’t blame them,
that would show some interest on their part.

INTERVIEWER: In other words, it wouldn't be hard-
er to get a team “up” for a game here than, say, at a
school like UNC?

CORRIGAN: That's right, the boys here play to win.

Of course, there are some games it is hard to get
the team up for, but there are certain reasons why
they cannot get up. But most of the time this is not the
case. Take the Randolph-Macon game. The football
team was really getting stomped with some bad breaks
like the touchdown just before the half, but they stayed
right in there, This shows they've got character, and
when you've got character, you also have a lot of other
things going for you.

But | feel—and I was thinking of this at that
game—that what we must do is recruit more. We talk
about alumni recruiting—the best recruiters we have is
the student body. If they cannot sell a kid, that kid
can't be sold, We can't sell him. The coaches are not
going to live with him day and night, he's going to live
with his contemporaries, And there are a lot of stu
denis here who care about athletics,

INTERVIEWER: Do you think that the CAC ade-
quately fulfilly the needs of our athletic program, or
de you think we might be better off becoming inde-
— or joining, let's say, the Mason-Dixon Con-
erence!

CORRIGAN; Well, | think the CAC fulfilis a real need
in this fegard: it gives the boys, individually, in a
number of sports the opportunity to win an award, If
we were independent, no one would ever have anything

we will stay with the CAC until or if there is an
alternative. | would not be an independent because for
us that would be very bad

INTERVIEWER: WAL at the present time enjoys a
certain parity with some larger as well as subsidized

schools in such areas as swimming, basketball, wrest-
ling, soccer and lacrosse. Is there a possibility that in
the future W&L will have to rely more and more on
the CAC? In other words, might we eventually become
restricted to the CAC?

CORRIGAN: | don’t think there is any chance of that
at all. The greatest problem with the CAC is not the
schools within the conference—they are all fine schools
but the one big objection is strictly geographic. It is
too impractical to send let’s say our tennis team to
Washington in St. Louis. It’s simply too far. Besides,
why send them out there when we can take them to
major schools close by us.

INTERVIEWER: But don't you think that these sports
might become big-business in the same sense football
has, and thereby virtually exclude the small school?

CORRIGAN: These sports that you mentioned will
never become big-business in the sense football is. It
just will not happen.

Here the philosophy is that if there is sufficient
interest among the students to compete in a certain
sport, we will add that sport to our program.

1, personally, would like to see the beginning of
a squash team, which we will be equipped for after
the completion of the gym. But we won't have one un-
less there is sufficient interest within the student body.

As far as competing with these schools in other
areas besides football, | think we always will be able to
compete . . . for one thing, for a school our size, we
have such a fine group of men as coaches, Of course,
we are not, and let me emphasize this, going to jump
into a big-time schedule in any sport until we are ready
to do it.

INTERVIEWER: How do you judge the unorganized
aspects, that is, the non-intercollegiate, not-intramural
aspects, of our athletic program?

CORRIGAN: Everything here is convenient, parti-
cularly to the dormitories, | was amazed when I came
up here last spring to see so many boys in the gym at
night, palying handball, or basketball, or whatever.

Of course, after the new building is completed, we
will have enough in the way of facilities and lockers
for every person in the Washington and Lee commun-
ity, To have it any other way would be shorichang-
Wes.

INTERVIEWER: Would you say that the overall ath-
letic program, as you see it now, is oriented more to-
wards the intercollegiate man or more towards the
informal athlete, such as the student who comes into
the gym at night to play bandhall?

CORRIGAN: Last year about 30% of the undergradu-
ate student body participated in intercollegiate sports.
Of the remaining 70%, probably 60% of them took
part in the intramurals on some level

Let me mention here that | do feel badly about
one thing. When the students came back this fall we
didn't have a lot of things ready. We moved them up
on top so that they could have their own area rather
than have to move around every day. We wanted to
have two fields up there for the intramurals alone, and
we didn't get this done. But | feel I learned a good
lesson

But back to your point, percentage-wise the system
leans towards intercollegiate sports, At a larger school
fewer students, relatively speaking, participate inter-
collegiately. The sports are here, if a boy wants to play
Certainly, no one will ever pressure a boy to go out if
he doesn't want to himself

The great thing is that our sports are geared so that
: student could come here having had no experience
in a sport, yet gain a great deal of proficiency, and
quite possibly play first-string varsity in that sport be
fore he graduates. He will not be cut from a team, and
if he shows anything at all, he will get the chance to
play

INTERVIEWER: After the new gym is completed, will
it be more likely to emphasize the intercollegiate or
the personal aspects of athletics here? Will it weight
the system one way or the other?

CORRIGAN: | think it will definitely improve both as-
pects. For instance, in intercollegiate sports, it will aid
our recruiting immensely. On the other hand, for the

iverage student we will have improved handball courts
bona fide squash courts, a fine swimming pool

INTERVIEWER: How about the proposed fieldhouse?

CORRIGAN: This is part of the overall plan, the idea
being to build something as large as we can feasily con

struct. It will have a synthetic turf inside enabling us to
use it for anything, including tennis. So, it will function
in intercollegiates and in the other aspects, such as the
physical education program .

 

INTERVIEWER: You mentioned physical education,
do you think our present PE program is adequate?

CORRIGAN: No, it's not. It’s not at all, because the
building isn’t adequate . . . The way I envision it, we
hope to make the course as elective as possible. That
way those boys who are required to enroll in PE can
take something they will enjoy and that will carry over
into later life. We started on that this year by throwing
out all the PFC tests for sophomores. |\We want to have
small groups of specialized instruction; for example, Mr.
Twombly teaches golf and Mr. Canfield, tennis.

We want to make the program more interesting,
and we will be able to do more along this line when
we haev more varied facilities . . .

INTERVIEWER: So then, the new gym will increase
the of the physical education program?
CORRIGAN: Oh sure, that's what we envision, For
example, we'd like to see a boy who scored low on his
PFI tests with the aid of a trainer be able to build
himself up considerably if he wanted to do so.

INTERVIEWER: What is your overall impression of
our intramural program?

CORRIGAN: | have not seen it in operation for a full
year, so I really don't know, Again, the new building
will make intramurals better, It’s got to, we'll have more
to offer, Of course, it will be up to the fraternities to
decide just what they want to do. . . but it has always
been a good program here.

INTERVIEWER: Has the overall athletic program ful-
filled your expectations so far?
CORRIGAN: Well, | don’t think it can be in this build-
ing. let's put it that way. But it has otherwise.

We'd like to feel that we have the athlete sub-
jected to all the finer things we have to offer.

One disappointment has been the size of some of
the squads. We have the capacity to handle a much
larger number than actually turn out. But numbers
would be the only disappointment

INTERVIEWER: Outside the physical changes, do you

see the need for any specific other changes in the im-
mediate future?

CORRIGAN: The major item is recruitment, we hope
io get our alumm more involved. Recruiting just in
Virginia goes against the grain of Washington and Lee,
for WAL is a4 national institution. We plan to contact
alumni all over the country, because we want to main-
tain our tradition of having our teams composed of
boys from diverse regions

Everything looks better now than it did two years
igo, but this has nothing to do with me at all. And
facilities do play a major role. | think we'll have a
better advantage in the years to come with a few gym

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Centre grinds Generals

By Mike Berry
Assistant Sports Editor

The third weekend in college foot-
ball’s centennial year saw many
interesting matchups. Various teams
across the nation got into the meat
of their schedules. Purdue found
that it may have played a possible
Rose Bowl opposite in its one point
decision over Stanford; Kentucky
found that its luck had run out as
Auburn set the Bluegrass boys back
44-3 and Saturday night, in the
midst of combo parties and gator
piles, Alabama and = Mississippi
matched off in one of the most
spectacular offensive displays in
college football history as Alabama
once again proved it has a team to
beat.

But before any of these games
were Over, most of us knew that the
Generals of W&L had suffered a

heartbreaking setback at the hands
of the Centre College Colonels. The
game for the most part was a stale-
mate as both teams seemed to be
able to hold one another in check,
The Colonels managed to grab the
lead in the second quarter on a 95
yard drive climaxed by Steve Kai-
ser’s one yard run for the score.
rhe first-half ended with the Gen-
erals down 7-0,

The Generals came out after in-
termission and drove 57 yards on
the excellent running of JoJo Mar-
tin and Doug Gossmann. The game
seemed to be a standoff from that
point but Centre capitalized on sev-
eral bad breaks by the Generals, and
were able to drive in for the decid-
ing touchdown midway through the
fourth quarter.

The Generals had trouble all day
and were particularly hampered by

Sports in General

W&L vs.

By John Robinson

After a month of intercollegiate
competition only one of W&L’s
teams has emerged undefeated. That
team is the varsity soccer team
which lays claim to a 3-0 record,
Despite wide margins in each con-
test, Coach Joe Lyles is quick to
point out that, “None of the games
have been easy.”

With 12 freshmen on the club and
only 4 seniors, inexperience _ still
looms as the Generals’ biggest hur-
dle. But after three challenges have
been successfully turned back, Lyles
was gleeful to emphasize that, “The
younger boys are really hustling and
hanging in there. They work hard in
practices as well as in games and
make up for lack of experience with
dedication.

So far the statistics for the booters
have been impressive with a total of
13 goals scored in 3 games, while
only an average of .67 were scored
by their opponents, Summarizing the
figures: Don Belt leads the team

U. Va.

with 6 goals and 1 assist, captain
John Yow has 3 goals, next is David
Manson with a pair of scores and
3 assists, and freshman Tom Kamp-
fmuellar has racked up a goal along
with a brace of assists. Goalie Ken
Newman has had two shut-outs and
allowed only two balls into the nets.

At this moment the Generals have
a good deal of momentum going,
but Friday at 4:00 on Alumni Field
they face their toughest test to date.
The University of Virginia brings an
undefeated team to do battle in
Lexington. After scouting Virginia,
Coach Lyles commented, “They
have very good material, especially
at wing and halfback. On paper I'd
have to say they are a better team.”
However, W&L will have a good
chance to down the Cavaliers thanks
to their veteran defense and aggres-
sive young offense. A good turn-out
in support of the soccer team will
definitely help the Generals in their
bid to remain undefeated and hand
the Wahoos their first loss,

Booters maim Madson

Once again Madison College suf-
fered defeat at the hands of Wash-
ington and Lee's soccer squad. The
final score was a lop-sided affair at
6-0, as the season's record was boost-
ed to 3-0.

The foreign field was still wet in
the initial quarter as Don Belt fed
to David Manson who made the
nets dance with his shot from the
right side. In the second quarter
WAL gained a 2-0 halftime lead as

Manson passed to John Yow for a
score.

In the third quarter a penalty for
pushing was converted into a point
by Don Belt via a penalty kick. And
only moments later Don headed the
ball in, after an assist from Meade
Kampfmuellar. Belt’s third marker
in a row came on a cross play to
the left side. The final goal went to
freshman George Lantzas in the last
quarter.

nor Baizley seemed to be able to
move the Generals through the air,
The bright spot of the afternoon was
the quick opener that the W&L line
and JoJo Martin managed to utilize
on the touchdown drive.

There is little need to deny that
the Generals are just about out of
the running for first place in the
CAC. The Colonels have already

defeated last year’s co-champions,
Southwestern, It will be a definite
upset if either Washington or Se-
wanee can beat the Colonels. Thus
the Colonels have a clear shot for
the championship. The Generals do,
however, have that outside shot and,
once again barring upsets, are a
shoe-in for second place.

The Generals go back on the road
this weekend as they visit another

and 2) my stomach couldn't stand
another re-reading. | will, however
sketch the projected Moratorium
program as it now stands. On the
morning of October 15th, a
of talks will be given in Lee Chapel

Ihe following people have graci-
ously consented to speak: Mr.
Charles Sweezy, minister of the
Lexington Presbyterian Church, Pro
fessors Loesel and Colvin of the
political science department, Dean
Sprunt, University Chaplin, Dr.
Pemberton of the Philosophy de-
partment, and a representative of the
John Birch Society. In addition, a
speaker is presently being sought
from VMI to explicate the military
point of view on the war. I believe
it is evident from the above that an
honest and intense effort has been
made to solicit all points of view
Never has there been an attempt (as
Mr. McConnell states in his article
“To sleep, Perchance to Cut?”) to
exclude or silence anyone.

The afternoon is to be left open
for partisan activities, (pro-war,
anti-war, or what-you-will); and a
Free Concert is being organized for
the evening which will, hopefully, re
unite the community with an aware
ness that, though our policy sugges-
tions differ, we are together in our

Ihe foregoing is an honest and
accurate disclosure of the Morator-
ium plans. I swear this by the New
York Mets (and anything else that
is still sacred). I have no idea how
the Friday R-t-P came by its “facts”
Having been involved in organiza
tional activities for the Moratorium
from their inception, | know that
neither Lawrence McConnell! nor
Walt Potter has been present at any
such gathering. Furthermore, on
only one occasion (to the best of
my knowledge) did the Friday R--P
interview anyone involved in the
Moratorium effort. On that occasion

Peter Zimmerman and I were ap
proached by a staff reporter who
clearly received, twice (once from

each of us) all pertinent data con
cerning the 15th. This interview fur
nished, I take it, the substance of
the articles. Anyone can see by sim
ple comparison with the above that
somewhere between note pad and

press, the simple associations of
time-<date-event became ludicrously
garbled

The Vietnam War has a shatter
ing effect on each of us both public
ly, as members of a society bitterly
fragmented by a long and draining
conflict, and privately, as individ
uals pressed by disruption and death
in our lives. It seems to me that it is
our duty as citizens to be continu
ally questioning our own
tions, continually re-examining the
evidence, in search of
our National Dilemma. I believe the
planned for October 15
afford us an excellent opportunity to
do just this—together. It
possible that in the common under
taking of that day, we will feel our
selves to be countrymen rather than
liberal, conservative, of of the
thousand things we call ourselves

Non-Partisan Moratorium
cheduled For University

Plans for Washington and Lee's
observance of the nationwide mora-
torium on the Vietnam War on Oc-
tober 15 crystallized during the past
week.

A group of concerned residents
of the Lexington community met
last Sunday in Lee Chapel to share
views on the moratorium. A clear-
cut program for the observance now
appears to be taking shape.

Prof. David Zucker, the group's
publicity chairman said the group's
activities on Wednesday will not
constitute protest against the war,
but rather a moratorium designed

to direct student and community
thought toward it.
Zucker emphasized that faculty

members have the option of dismiss-
ing their classes on October 15.

Colleges

Colleges throughout Virginia have
joined the proposed Vietnam mora-
torium scheduled for October 15,
Virtually all the colleges are stress-
ing the importance of individual
thought and participation, rather
than a definite pro-or anti-war stand,

At Hollins, a faculty vote left
cancellation of classes to the discre-
tion of individual teachers, Students
are free to attend classes if they so
desire.

Roanoke College, which operates
under a free-cut system, will also
hold classes on October 15. The
Roanoke Times quoted the college's
president, Dr. Perry Kendig, as
praising a proposed day-long discus-
sion program and as discouraging
the scheduling of tests on the 15th.

The University Council of Vir-
ginia Tech formally recognized the
event but classes will be held as
usual. The council stressed that hin
drances should not be provided for
those who wished to participate

Meanwhile, Tech students are be-
in connection with the moratorium
ginning a week-long series of events,

Faculty student discussion sessions
began yesterday and will continue
through next Tuesday

Plans for the ISth at Tech now

include a mock funeral and reading
of war dead and an afternoon
teach-in. Professor Tom Travis told
the Roanoke Times that the mora
torium group is seeking the school’s
drill field for the teach-in. Folk
singers, rock and roll bands and
speakers are scheduled for the after
noon ceremony, Workshops may be
held in the evening,

The Times quoted Travis, as say
ing his group is working with the
National Vietnam Moratorium Com
mittee. Pamphlets on the war have
been circulated in Blacksburg, and

Washington and Lee's participa-

which is under the sponsorship of
the non-partisan effort, will actually
begin Tuesday night with what is
designed to be a non-partisan, in-
dividualized doorbell-ringing session,
Students will attempt to exchange
ideas on the war with townspeople
at this time.

On Wednesday, a series of six
speeches, reflecting various aspects
of the Vietnam conflict, is tentatively
scheduled for Lee Chapel. The pro-
gram is scheduled to begin at 10
a.m. and will probably last between
two and two and and a half hours,

Rev. Charles Swezy of Lexington,
who will discuss “Conflict in Viet-
nam, What Are the Issues?” Col.

on Oct. 15. Edgar Shannon, the
university president, said students
would not be prohibited from parti-

A student-faculty Moratorium
Committee is attempting to construct
organized activities for the obser-
vance. According to Virginia’s stu-
dent paper, The Cavalier Daily,
hourly church services are being
planned together with a bell-tolling
ceremony.

Senator George McGovern will
speak tonight in Virginia’s University
Hall. On Monday Arthur Waskow
of the Institute of Policy Studies
will speak. This will be followed by
a film series on Tuesday.

Wednesday's program at
tentatively schedules Karl
a morning speaker on the steps of
the Rotunda. A pro-peace Vietnam
veteran and perhaps an anti-war
senator may also be presented to-
gether with an afternoon teach-in,
the Cavalier Daily said.

ed on reserve in the library.

Mclihany will present a film deal
ing with the Vietnam conflict, and
participate in discussion in duPont
Hall beginning at 2. A number of
WAL undergraduates who are also
veterans of the armed services will
be available in Payne 1-A at the

An Act of Faith

The faculty, by relaxing parietal restrictions for fraternity

houses, demonstrated at one reasonableness and good faith.

They were reasonable in that they recognized fraternity
houses, demonstrated at once reasonableness and good faith.
man dormitories. They exhibited good faith in that several
important differences in the natures of fraternity houses as
opposed to dorms does not necessarily make their most recent
relaxation of rules a logical extension o fwhat they passed last
spring with regard to dorms alone.

The differences lie chiefly in the enforcement provisions.
It is the responsibility of the dorm counselors, under the direct
authority of the University, to maintain the rules as they have
been established, and it is the University that is ultimately
responsible for any infraction that occurs.

Such is not the case with fraternities, and as a result it
will be the house, and quite foreseeably, fraternities in gen-
eral, who will bear the responsibility for violation of the rules
they have chosen to adopt. First, the primary responsibility
for enforcement lies not with a detached authority, but with
the fraternity officers themselves. Secondly, between these and
the University stands the Interfraternity Council. And thirdly,
each fraternity is also answerable to a national headquarters.

Because enforcement lies in the hands of parties conceiv-
ably interested in concealing rather than punishing infractions,
many faculty members justifiably doubt that the rules will be
enforced within the houses. The IFC’s history of sporadic en-
forcement offers even less hope, though it pledges automatic
social probation for every violating fraternity.

It has in the past few days given some encouraging signs,
however. Most notable is the consideration the Judicial Board
is giving each fraternity’s set of rules and provisions for en-
forcement before they pass them on to the Student Affairs
Committee, which has the power of final acceptance or rejec-
tion.

But even if the IFC does punish every infraction that comes
to its attention, there still remains the strong possibility that
many will go undetected and unprevented due to lack of ap-
plication of rules at the individual fraternity level. Such abuse
of rules tends to increase in degree of flagrance until a breach,
either of times established or of good conduct, occurs that
cannot be overlooked by anyone.

A national headquarters, concerned that its image has
been hurt at a time when fraternities nationally can ill-afford
adverse publicity, might recall a charter. Moreover, the Uni-
versity, confronted with evidence that fraternities are incapable
of governing themselves, could through the faculty review its
decision and revert to the former set of rules for all houses.
Dean John at the IFC meeting emphasized the closeness of
Monday’s vote, when only speculation could be martialed
against the resolution. We suspect facts supporting the view
currently in the minority would be more than enough to re-
verse the decision and put fraternities in a defensive position
from which it would be hard for them to recover.

We do not want to play the role of the alarmist or the
prophet of doom. We do think it necessary to remind each
house, for that is the level at which enforcement will succeed
or fail, of the implications involved in not taking seriously the
rules most have just finished adopting. The system itself might
not survive the repercussions a severe infraction will undoubt-

edly incur.
The Holdouts

The University this past summer gave $3,000 to help
alleviate the damage done to the area in the August flood.
It moreover donated equipment, and personnel and the few
students who were here performed laudably, we are told, in
the first few hours after the disaster struck.

We were pleased not only by that fact alone, but also
because it seemed to signal a trend toward W&L’s greater in-
volvement in the problems of the community of which it is
a part. The beginnings of that trend were noticeable last sum-
mer when the University made available its athletic facilities to
the people of Lexington.

Finally, of course, the University as an institution is limited
in what it can do, though even that contribution is vital and
should be expanded as much as possible, What is more signifi-
cant is the potential of the University as a group of advantaged
indviduals to act decisively in helping the local people solve the
problems that confront them,

There have long been strictly individual efforts in this
direction, for example Prof. Hodges’ work with the black
people of the area, The most noteworthy instance to date of
a move by a group of organized faculty members is the work
of professors Whitney, Sloss, Zucker and Larue, and Mes.
Pleva. They, under the aegis of the Total Action Against Pov-
erty program and with the cooperation of the University, have
begun teaching basic math and English to teacher aides, The
faculty, like the University can do more, and we see this initial
collective action as an indication that it will.

Clearly, then, the only group yet to add its resources to
any significant degree to the effort currently being made is
the students, and thus far we see no signs which offer hope
that they will in the near future make a collective effort to do so.

 

An Era of Growth
To Begin at W&L?

By MONTY COTTIER

When President Huntley spoke at
the beginning of the term, his ideas
and suggestions on the size of the
university, plans for enlargement,
co-education, and schemes for fi-
nancing it all, murmurs rose fol-
lowed by long discussions on the
stairs of Doremus, in the Dining
Hall, and elsewhere. Now that a
month or so has passed, it might
be well to see what has been done
toward these goals,

First, committees have been form-
ed to study the problems and the
solutions, The Co-education Com-
mittee, of which Professor Hodges
is chairman, has been broken into
two sub-committees. Dean John
heads the subcommittee on Admis-
sions and Student Services, while
Professor DeVogt is in charge of

Letters to the Fditor...

Questions About Oct. 15

Editor, The Friday Ring-tum Phi:

Throughout the discussion of the
October 15 moratorium, insufficient
attention has been given to the na-
tional movement which has nurtured
the forthcoming “Day of Concern”
at W&L.

The promoters of the W&L mora-
torlum have attempted to enlist
speakers of varying viewpoints in
the interest of objectivity. However,
we contend that objectivity is im-
possible under the circumstances:
The W&L “Day of Concern” can-
not be divorced from the national
movement, which is most surely non-
objective. According to Wednes-
day’s Wall Street Journal, national
organizers of the protest “hope that
a day of dramatic but peaceful
demonstrations will touch off a con-
tinuing grass-roots campaign to pres-
sure the President into rapidly with-
drawing troops from Vietnam.”

The W&L program will not be
viewed by outsiders as an open dis-
cussion of our role in Vietnam, but
rather it will be viewed as a con-
tribution to the national campaign
“to presure the President” into a
rapid troop withdrawal. In fact, the
W&L moratorium has already been
linked to the national movement by
a recent article in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch which described the
various anti-war rites to be held in
Virginia on October 15.

Consequently, we ask the mora-
torilum organizers at W&L: If ob-
jectivity is a goal of the “Day of
Concern,” why has the local move-
ment scheduled events on October
15 instead of another day, and why
has it made use of the Vietnam
Moratorium Committtee’s national
advertising in promoting the W&L
activities? Furthermore, why has the
local movement countenanced the
emotional dramatics of protest by
urging students not to attend classes
on October 15, whereas a non-con-
flicting afternoon or evening pro-
gram would have been possible?

We would welcome an open dis-
cussion of our role in Vietnam, if
such a discussion were held in a
truly objective atmosphere—on a
different day, independent of any
national movement, and without an
aura of protest; but since the “Day
of Concern” does not meet these
criteria, and since success is often
measured by numbers, we must urge
students to withhold their de facto
support from a cause with which
they may be in substantial disagree-
ment by not attending the mora-
torium activities on October 15.

Clarifications Of Oct. 15

to the Editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

As publicity chairman for the
Vietnam Moratorium on October 15,
I should like to make a statement
to your readers about the purpose
of the activities being held on that
day at Washington and Lee and in
Lexington, | should also like to ask
you, if you find it possible, to an-
nounce this matter so that the com-
munity as a whole can be made
aware of it,

The purpose of the Moratorium js
not to protest the Vietnam War. It
is rather to provide a forum for
discussion of the issue which con-
cerns all Americans so profoundly
The activities are as follows: On
Tuesday evening, October 14, stu-
dents will be ringing doorbells and
talking to citizens about the war, in
an effert to communicate matters
of mutual concern. On Wednesday,
there will be a program of speakers
at Lee Chapel from 10 am. to
approximately 12 noon. The speak

ers include the Reverand David
Sprunt, the Reverand Charles
Swezey, Professor Milton Colvin.
Professors have the option of dis-
missing their classes to attend this
program. In the afternoon, stu-
dents may indulge in discussions or
in peaceful demonstrations (either
for or against). In the evening, there
is planned a program of poetry read-
ing and a song fest. The Lexington
community is encouraged to attend
any or all of these functions.

I should like to emphasize that
those persons who have claimed that
this Moratorium is another protest
against the war are entirely mis-
taken. Many persons supporting and
participating in the program have
varied views. This is, it seems to
me, a vital way of carrying on the
democratic process.

Sincerely,
David H. Zucker

“Quiet Discrimination”
To the editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

There is a situation in the City of
Lexington that angers me beyond
reprieve. It is well concealed but
very effective. It is what is referred
to as quiet discrimination. If a Lex-
ington resident is approached, he
will assuredly deny the existence of
illegal discrimination and he might
even be insulted.

Nevertheless, Lexington is rotten
with prejudice. I need cite one ex-
ample to satisfy the skeptics in this

community. Several night ago there
was a meeting of the Lexington
Human Relations Council, Its prime
purpose was the discussion of a
study done by the committee to
determine the extent of racism in
the city. The results of this study
were appalling. The council asked 8
major merchants to attend the meet-
ing so that the problem could be
discussed. A totally reasonable and
justifiable request. Well, not one of
these super-8 community leaders ap-
peared. I need not make accusations
as to why I feel that they failed
to appear. Some of them gave ex-
cuses, such as baby sitting. Some
just ignore the council. What is
left to be done when the people in
the position to solve a problem turn
their back on it?

I have a request to make, All
this situation please contact me at
463-6668. | mean to do something
about this.

This may not be my hometown,
but as long as I live here it is my
obligation to work for what I feel
is just. Equality of men is not only
just, it is required by law. Dr.
Hodges is working hard with the
Human Relations Council. | have
spoken with him about this letter
and he looks for more active partici-
pation of all people living, working
and studying in this community.

Let us not stand by silently any
longer, please; it’s time we all got
up and started working for equality
among all men. Give a damn!

A Fable

By MACK WOODWARD
Tuesday Edition

Once upon a time there was an
International Fun Circus that came
every week to a sleepy hamlet
called Little Lick. The townspeople
in the litthe community came fe-
luctantly to the circus every week
because they'd already paid for sea-
son tickets to the shows. The bad
thing about it was that every week
the shows were always the same.

The most familiar personage in
the circus was the  ringmaster,
Chuckles the Clown, Unlike many
clowns, Chuckles was never happy.
He had two magic horns, one in
each hand which he honked to call
order in the circus to start the acts
in the show, The right hand horn
meant “yes,” and the left hand horn
meant “no,” but they both sounded
the same and often Chuckles got
them mixed up,

At the beginning of the show,
Chuckles would honk his horns to
create activity (he got se confused
sometimes about which was “yes”
and which “no”). And even after he
honked his horns to start the show,
all the performers would just stand
in the ring and do nothing at all.
This was a real treat for the Little
Lick community because Chuckles
would begin to honk his horns wilid-
ly to try to look funny and busy.

The star performers in the circus
would sometimes get into the act
with Chuckles, There was one crowd
pleaser, Powell, the Pulsating Por-
poise, whom the company in the
circus tried to teach to talk. He
was funny because all of a sudden
he would squeal and bark (as all
porpoises are wont to do) in the
middle of Chuckles’ act. Sometimes
J. J,, the Trained Weasel, wouid
forget his script for his act so in-
siead he paced back and forth in
his cage io attract the crowd's at-
fenton

Occasionally, the ferocious Woody
Woodchuck would rear back on his
hind legs in the middle of the ring
and try to make loud noises, but

Powell the Pulsating Porpoise and
Chuckles could easily drown out his
squeaks by barking and honking.

The worst part of the circus for
Chuckles was the booming voice of
John W. Davis’ great, great grand-
son. Whenever he spoke, order
would break out, leaving Chuckles
in complete disarray. But finally
Chuckles would fumble for his “yes”
horn and honk it loudly, and every-
thing livened up again briefly,

The end of the circus came when
all the circus performers got tired
of their acts and Chuckles would
put away his magic horns to signify
that the circus was at an end. The
performers would go wearily back
to their respective wagons as
Chuckles would ask the crowd if
they enjoyed the show,

The Little Lick people are a quiet
lot and though they were unhappy
with the circus, it was something to
go see. And after all, the show g0es
on each week and there was always
hope in their simple hearts that the
show might be better the next week.

Academic Progress and the Physical
Plant. Professor John Gunn heads
the Committee on University Size,
which has not been broken into
subcommittees,

When asked what progress the
committees had made in their re-
search, Dean John replied, “Well,
we don’t have any answers yet, but
we do have a wealth of questions.”
Mr. Hotchkiss, Director of Univer-
sity Development, echoed this when
he remarked in connection with the
funding program, “We are not shirk-
ing, but planning.” Thus, the pri-
mary work at the present seems to
be directed towards a kind of
groundbreaking.

In emphasizing this fact, Dean
John pointed to the issue of co-edu-
cation as an illustration. “If co-
education goes through, then natur-
ally the university must be expanded,
If, on the other hand, we determine
that it would be impossible to so
expand the university, then that
would determine the fate of the
co-educational program. One de-
pends on another, and, although one
does not have precedent over the
— they are certainly interrelat-
ed.

The report of the Co-education
Committee wil be presented to the
faculty in about a month. Among
the problems to be considered in
connection with this report are fi-
nancing, size limitations, and time
necessary to construct new dorms,
buildings, and gymnasium facilities
should the plan pass,

It certainly is an intriguing thing,
this speculation on the ravine cam-
pus. The committees involved could
easily spend their time figuring out
how, if they moved the Commerce
School to the McCormick building,
and the library into a new ravine
location or the west campus, and
build a new building for the His-
tory Department and moved the
whole administration into Washing-
ton Hall and its annexes, the whole
campus could be radically altered
and improved. It is to their credit
laht, although these topics do form
a considerable portion of their dis-
cussion, they still have their eyes
firmly fixed on the concrete prob-
lems of this undertaking.

In the area of financing, Mr,
Hotchkiss said, “Without resorting
to an out-and-out campaign, we are
already receiving many funds. This
project will be financed almost en-
lirely from private funds and dona-
tions. As a measure of the success
of the fund drive, donations this
year have already doubled last

8

year’s,

Therefore, while some of the stu-
dents may have forgotten the “ra-
vine campus” idea of President
Huntley's speech, the administration
has not. Plans for tiers of buildings
down the ravine housing the library,
law school, and other overcrowded
departments and facilities, or build-
ings on the other side for the same
purposes, or combinations of any of
a number of plans are all being con-
a As Mr. Hotchkiss stated,

t's like trying to fit the pieces into
“4 jigsaw puzzle. As soon as one gets
placed where we think it ought to
be, another one comes along and
the whole thing has to be moved
again.”

Even though the plans are cur-
rently just that, and in many cases
haven't progressed beyond notions
or flashes of inspiration, the work of
funding the project has already be-
gun. This is essential, for when the
diagrams and blueprints of the new

expanded campus” and the renoval-

ed and restored “old campus,” as
the two are beginning to be called,
are drawn up, and when architect's
drawings of buildings either cling-
ing to the slope or sitting on the
other side of the ravine are made,
it is essential to know that we have
enough money to change these draw-
ings imo an expanded WAL.

The Mets did not have any hitters

won 40 games in a 162 game sched-

pitchers, one great hitter, and a very
fine manager. They are also the
National League champions. It is
to their misfortune, though, to have
picked this year for their “impossible
dream,” for they must challenge one
of the finest teams of the °60’s, the
Baltimore Orioles, in the World
Series.

It was thought by many that the
recent playoffs would hinder the
chances of the two leagues’ best
teams of making the World Series.
It just was not to be, however, for

another one of sports’ Cinderella
stories.

Ihe Mets, hoping to follow in the
steps of the other intown Baltimore-
killers (the Jets and Knicks), are a
good team offensively as was shown
against the Braves, but can not hope
to get by the Orioles in similar
fashion. Therefore if the road to
glory is to be ridden at all by the
Mets, it will be achieved by the
likes of Tom Seaver, Jerry Koos-
man, et al. In other words, the pitch-
ing staff. It was rather shaky against
the Braves, a luxury the Mets can
not afford against Baltimore.

It is not hard to describe the
Orioles. They are simply a team
that can beat another in every pos-
sible way. It is certain that George
Bamberger (the Oriole _ pitching
coach) would match his hurlers
against any staff in baseball and
probably come out on top. Mike
Cuellar, Dave MeNally, and Jim
Palmer provide the Orioles with a
spectacular starting rotation. Al-
though maybe not quite as effective

as the Mets’ 1-2 combination of
Seaver-Koosman, it does give the
Orioles more depth. Baltimore’s
corps of reliefers also has the depth
advantage over the Mets.
Offensively, one must give the
overall advantage definitely to the
Orioles. Cleon Jones and Tommie
Agee of the Mets had fine years, to
be sure, but if they or maybe Art
Shamsky do not hit for the Mets,
who will? On the other hand, the
Orioles have so many players com-
ing off fine years that the team can
explode any time. A comparison of
the two teams offensive statistics
makes for a pretty bleak picture for

the Mets: Team Avg. Balt. .265,
N.Y. .241; Runs. Balt. 779, N.Y.
632; Home Runs, Balt. 175, N.Y.
109,

None of the games in the World
Series is going to be decided by
bad defensive play, for both teams
are sound, with Baltimore once
again being the sounder on the
strength of having such specialists as
Brooks Robinson, Mark Belanger,
and Paul Blair in the line-up,

But the 1969 World Series will be
no mismatch. Too many times
in professional sports have
season statistics proved to be mean-

Generals Succumb to Centre
“Maximum Effort” Sited by Leslie

Another tradition, Washington
and Lee’s “Homecoming Hex” on
football opponents, has gone by the
boards. Last week's loss to Centre
marked the first time in ten years
that the Generals have been defeat-
ed before the olds grads.

Despite the narrow 14-7 loss to
Centre, Coach Buck Leslie was
pleased with several aspects of the
game that might aid the W&L cause
Saturday when the Generals play
Hampden-Sydney.

“We gave maximum effort,” said
the head man. “That's not to say
we didn’t make a few mistakes, but
we gave away a lot of size and
speed.” Another feature that pleased
Coach Leslie was the Generals’ phy-
sical condition. Towards the end of
the game the Colonels were visibly
spent.

Both these observations from last
week's game could bring dividends
Saturday against the H-S Tigers.
Hampden-Sydney is regarded by
many as the potential number one
small college team in the state. Their
leading runner is hard-nosed Tom
Whorely, a boy who carries the ball
some twenty-five to thirty times a
game. “He comes to play,” warns
defensive coach Boyd Williams. The
Tigers are 2-1, having defeated Se-
wanee and Bridgewater handily after
a very close loss (19-12) to a tough
Shepherd team.

The injuries in the Centre game
were few but costly nevertheless.
The final word isn’t in yet on wheth-
er senior tri-captain and starting
center Thunder Thornton will have
to undergo surgery on his injured
knee. If he does, it will be a severe
blow to the Generals. When Thorn-
ion was injured last week aaginst
Centre, untried freshman Bim Glas-
gow had to be pressed into service,
and it was a bad snap on a W&L
punt that led directly to Centre's
winning touchdown in the fourth
quarter. The decision on Thornton's
knee will come on Friday.

Other than Thornion, the only
other ailing General is defensive
back Dave Brooks, who is bothered
by a bruised thigh muscle. But
Brooks is expected to start at his
usual safety position against the
ligers. For the second straight week,

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 14, 1969

 

Martha and the Vandellas will appear Saturday night in Doremus Gym,

penings set for Gym

Once again Doremus Gym has

been called back into service for a

Washington and Lee Dance week-
end. Both Friday and Saturday

nights will see the gym overflowing
with the usual collection-partying
students and their dates. The Paul
Butterfield Blues Band will be the
featured attraction Friday night
while Saturday night will find W&l
soul afficionados entertained by the
Motown Revue; Martha Reeves and
the Vandellas 100%. In addi-
tion. the Kallabash Corporation has
been contracted to provide the sound
for the University cocktail party
Friday afternoon in Red Square
Both concerts are scheduled to start
at & p.m. The cocktail party will be-
gin at 4 p.m

Reason for the shift back to Dore
was a breakdown in negotia
tions with VMI. Originally, the
Dance Board had planned to hold all
of this year’s concerts in the VMI
Ficld House, but an inability to
make afrangemenis satisfactory to
both sides resulted in Openings be
ing shifted back to Doremus. At pre
sent, Dr. Phillips of the Economics

Martha and the Vandellas have
become one of the hottest record-
ing acts in the nation. Indeed, they
are one of the top properties of Mo-
town Record Corporation where
every group under contract ranks as
an internationally acclaimed head-
line act.

In Detroit, their hometown, Mar-
tha Reeves and the Vandellas are
easily cited as perennial Motown
Sound favorites.

Their status is continuously be
ing enforced as was evidenced when
they recorded their first live album,
Martha and the Vandellas Live!, at
one of Detroit's leading nightclubs

Good things seem to come in
three’s for the trio, who have had
three trips abroad—twice on tours
of England and once around the
European concert circuit. They had
been organized the same number of
years prior to their tremendous take
off.

Since that hit, “Come and
Get These Memories”, Martha
Reeves and the Vandellas have fol
lowed up with “Heat Wave (a

“Jimmy Mack”, “Love Bug

IFC views parietal rules

after SAC rejects eight

The IFC concerned itself mainly
last night with the outlining of reg-
ulations necessary for application
for having girls in fraternity houses.
Iwelve petitions had been previously
submitted by individual fraternities:
three were rejected by the IFC Judi-
cial Board; one was handed in too
late to be considered by the IFC;
six were denied by the Student Af-
fairs Committee; and only two were
accepted,

During the course of the discus-
sion, Phi Ep president Lennie Par-
kins brought up the point that the
situation with girls in the fraternity
houses was similar to that in the
dormitories. He felt that since two
people were required in each house
to enforce the regulations concern-
ing girls that an equal restriction be
placed upon the dorms; he cited
the possibility of employing dorm
counselors for such a purpose. Dean

There was a good showing of area
colleges. Wake Forest made the
best showing with their four man
team winning 6 of 8& debates. The
remaining awards were divided
among U.Va., Richmond, W&M

also present from Catholic Univer-
sity, Roanoke College, Old Domi

Lewis G. John denied the idea that
an allusion could be drawn between
the dorms and the fraternities and
added that it would be too cumber-
some to consider such a plan for a
fraternity.

IFC president Chuck Cahn an-
nounced that the annual pledge shoe
race would be held at half time dur-
ing the game this Saturday. Two
pledges from each house will meet
with him this Thursday at 6:30 p.m.
in the Student Center to formalize
plans.

Jay Wetsel, IFC secretary, then

discussed the bad attitudes which
fraternities were developing. He
cited the fact that irresponsibiilty

had grown considerably since last
year and was giving the fraternity
system a bad name. He then pushed
for enforcement of parietal restric-
tions, sO as to express the true re-
sponsibility of fraternities,

Why not be non-partisan?

During the past two weeks we have watched with keen in-
terest the developments that have taken place here concern-
ing October 15. At first, we were pleased; we believed every-
one would be respectful of the opinions of others. We thought
that maybe the program of events scheduled on October 15
would be non-partisan. We felt that possibly something posi-
tive and constructive would result. We hoped that neither
extreme, left nor right, would be unduly assertive. We prayed
that for just one day everyone could try to forget whether or
not he considered himself left, right, or somewhere in the
middle. We have been bitterly disappointed.

The Executive Committee, the faculty, and the October
15 Group (Messrs. Turner, Geyer, Zimmerman, Zucker, et
al.) did their best, or, we should say, the best they could do.
However, they committed, as we did, that historically fatal
mistake of putting too much confidence in those that fail to
use their brains enough, in those that fail to weigh the conse-
quences before acting. They placed too much trust in the
ability of others to rise above overt partisanship so that some-
thing of value could result here tomorrow.

The October 4 Richmond Times-Dispatch quoted Zim-
merman: “the real purpose of the day is to instill a communal
spirit of concern about the American involvement in the
war.” Geyer wrote in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi: “It seems

to me that it is our duty as citizens to be. .

. in search of a

solution to our National Dilemma. I believe the activities
planned for October 15 afford us an excellent opportunity
to do just this—together.” In his letter published in the Fri-
day Edition, Professor Zucker reiterated that the purpose of
the moratorium here is to provide a forum as a means of di-
recting thought toward an issue of national concern. How-
ever, he added that the afternoon would be open for peaceful
demonstrations for those who wished to protest either for or
against the war. Therein lies the tragedy of tomorrow.

It is too late to ask any but rhetorical questions. Why
leave the afternoon open to partisan activity (albeit to activity
from both sides in a vain attempt to be “non-partisan’’)?
Wouldn’t it have been far better to go to class in the morning
and schedule the lectures in the afternoon, than to open the
door for irresponsibility? As it is, any positive, bilateral, non-
partisan advantage mounted in the morning can easily be
lost amid emotions in the afternoon. Fortunately, responsible
and constructive alternatives will be provided otherwise for
those who desire to continue the morning’s spirit in the after-
noon. Discussion groups such as those being conducted by
Rev. Sweezy, Dr. Colvin, and Mr. Loesel, are open to those
who prefer to use their minds in lieu of their feet.

The aim of the moratorium is to channel thought and
direct attention on a non-biased rational basis, not to abort
these processes. We all should be well aware that the war in
Vietnam is a national disaster. The time for demonstration is
over. There is nothing more to prove. We must now locate

gain

solutions. What possible

can the leaders of tomorrow's

“peace parade” hope to derive? All their action will do is
build-up an atmosphere of hostility—and we are not idly
prognosticating from an isolated office, plans for counter
marches have already been made—and what can be accom-
plished in an air of hostility? Hostility, or confrontation or
whatever word one chooses to call it, is a far cry from dispas-
sionate objective study and thought. It is miles away—miles
only your feet will lead you along.

Like Mr. Geyer, we too were foolish enough to believe
that maybe for once in this heady national debate, some peo-
ple could join hands in search of a solution. And so, perhaps,
we will cooperate and think. But for how long? Two or three
artificial hours tomorrow morning before we split up. Before
we forget what we learned and before we forget how to think
as we walk out of Lee Chapel down the right or the left aisle?

Baroody and Gingold act;

Vietnam petition circulated

The President
The White Howse
Washington, D.C

Mr. President:

On January 11, 1968, you address-
ed our community in the following
manner: “America needs the vision,
the dissent, the constructive action
this generation can provide for in
the years ahead,” In the year and a
half since those remarks were made
you acceded to the nation’s highest
office. and it is with greatest confid-
ence in your continued dedication to
those principles of vision, dissent,
and constructive action, that we
write to you today,

Our appeal is not that of a con
glomerate of polarized political en-
tities advocating or opposing escala-
tion or deescalation of the war. In-
stead, we offer our opinion to you
is Americans, united in our concern
with the policy as it currently
stands, seeking only to be heard

We, the undersigned, are members

of the Lexington, Virginia com-
munity, It is our hope that in 1969,
us President of the United States,
you will not ignore our dissatisfac-
tion with our nation’s current policy

regarding Viet Nam.

This is a copy of the letier-petition
that will be circulated throughout
Lexingion on Tuesday and Wednes
day of this week and delivered to
the President on Thursday, the six
teenth

Jeffery Gingold and Robert
roody were co-authors

The letter was read to the group
that attended the moratorium on
Sunday—the fourth of Ogtober—in
Lee Chapel and after discussion was
approved by all but three of the
over 190 attending

There will be three paris to the

ignorance of contents continues

By Mack Woodward
Editorial-Page Editor

The local history of Rockbridge
County played an important part
in the history of the nation. Many
families famous in Virginia as well
as American history lived in this
area in the earlier years of this
country. Many of the prominent
families kept extensive files of diar-
ies and letters, as well as ledgers
and other business papers. Descen-
dents today of these families, realiz-
ing the value of these papers, de-
cided to donate the papers to in-
stitutions where they may be of use
to scholars and researchers.

Many of these papers have been
donated to McCormick Library. In-
cluded in the collection in the ar-
chives are papers of Daniel Boone,
“Light Horse” Harry Lee, George
Washington, James Monroe, John
Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, James
Madison, and Robert E. Lee.

The problem that the library ar-
chives faces is the organization of
this material, While the documents
fill two large rooms on the second
floor of the library, they are in very

How a

By Bill Melthany
(Editor's Note: The opinions ex-
pressed in these articles are not
necessarily those of the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi.)

Few are aware that an official
U.S. Government investigation in
Congress, which was published and
is available (the content of which
was summarized with additional
evidence by Gary Allen in the lead
article, “The Vietniks”, which ap-
peared in the January, 1966 issue
of American Opinion,) revealed that
the date, October 15th, since 1965
has been a day of internationally-
organized protest for the Commun-
ists and their dupes worldwide. In
America, October 15, 1965, marked
violence at numerous campuses
which fell victim to the Maoist
Vietnam Day Committee. The fact
that the International Communist
Conspiracy has directed these de-
monstrations against the war in
Vietnam is so well known that this
has mistakenly led many Americans
to believe the Reds are really un-
happy about American policy there.

In spite of the unfortunate fact
that Oetober 15th of this year was
chosen for a similar protest here at
WAL. the vast majority of those in-
volved on our campus are motivated
exclusively by the most sincere, yet
misguided, form of idealism, if cer-
tainly not by any accurate know-
ledge or understanding of the history
und workings of the Communist
Conspiracy or its operations in Viet-
nam.

The only serious problems involv
ed are these: A majority of students
at WAL took seriously their wition
which their parents paid and right-

fully expect classes to be held on
the Sth. Some “Right-wing extre-
mists. such as this writer, think

getting an education on that day is a
damn good idea

Ihe other problem is a lack of
knowledge about what has really
been going on in Vietnam. Too few
people on this campus know, for
instance, that it was the U.S. State
Department, through William Dono
van of the Office of Strategic Serv-
that provided the money for
vetting up the late (and sickeningly
venerated-by-the - “Liberal press}

loose order. Mr. Leach, librarian,
stated that there was “. . . no effec-
tive control over the total material.”

None of the documents in the
archives are indexed by subject;
some collections are cruaely indexed
by the addressee or by who wrote
them. Cross-indices are non-existant.
There are name indices to most of
the important manuscript collections.
Most of the work that has been
done was done by Mrs. Henry Sloss
last year and by Dr. Crenshaw over
the last few years while doing re-
search for his book.

The conditions in the archives
section are far less than desirable
for old documents, The papers are
stacked in boxes, in grocery sacks,
and on the floor. The rooms are hot
and stuffy; ideally, the temperature
should be around 70 degrees and
the humidity around fifty per cent.
The worst enemies of these older
documents are dust, humidity, and
extreme temperatures.

Several people in the Lexington
community are aware of the con-
tents and potential finds in the li-
brary. Matt Paxton, Jr., who did re-

Bircher

and various C.LA. operatives who
were responsible in the early and
mid-1950's for betraying the anti-
Communist French Army and quiet-
ly enabling the Communist Viet
Minh to enslave half of Vietnam:
and destroying the power of and
eventually exiling from South Viet-
nam the only solidly anti-Communist
groups there: The Emperor Bao Dai,
Pope Pham cong Tac and the three
million members of the Cao Dai
religious sect, the smaller two-mil-
lion-member Hao Hao sect, and the
Binh Huyen army under the leader-
ship of General Le van Vien; and
the installation of and later assassi-
nation of Ngo dinh Diem — a typi-
cal indication of whose background
can be gained from the fact that
his, President Diem’'s, brother, Ngo
dinh Nhu, maintained a “labor or-
ganization” in the My Tho area of
South Vietnam which was practi-
cally indistinguishable from the
Communist Party there, and who, at
the same time, as “advisor to the
president”, controlled the army and
the police of the regime, and an un-
derground party of some 70,000
members which spent much of its
energy turning in denuncations of
anybody who was opposed to the
Ngo family. The most glamourous
member of that touchy family, Ma
dame Nhu, admitied freely about
two years ago in The New York
Times that she herself is, and al-
ways has been, a Communist, In
other words, since 1954, we haven't
had any genuine anti-Communist
bastion in South Vietnam to be de
fending. The whole story on the
above material is told in Hilaire du
Herners Background to Betrayal:
The Tragedy of Vietnam.

Few here at WAL know tha
everything we are currently and
have been doing in Vietnam—in

deed the very reason we got in Viet
nmam—is im accordance with our
treaty commitments in the S.ELA
1.0. organization, which is, accord
ing to two provisions of its own
charter, merely a regional branch of
the U.N. Because of this. the man
who heads the U.N.'s department
which is in charge of supervising ali
military actions of U.N. member
nations is actually the commanding
officer of all U.S. servicemen in
Vietnam. His name is Dr Leonid A
Rutakovy and he is U.N Under
Secretary General for Political and

search in the newspaper files and
family papers said he “, . . never
was able to find everything I was
looking for,” Mr. Paxton emphasiz-
ed that the archives could be more
useful as Rockbridge County was
part of one of the major routes
westward and the library no doubt
contained important documents deal-
ing with the westward movement.

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, who did
considerable research in the archives
section emphasized the need for
more effective cataloging of the ma-
terials as we are not certain just
what is in the library—and until
we do know what is in the library
the materials cannot be effectively
used,

The library no doubt contains
several documents more important
than those we know about, but if
they are not catalogued properly,
they may be in a state of total use-
lessness by the time funds are avail-
able to staff the archives. Until such
time that the archives is appropri-
ated more money, the documents
will rot as the new gymnasium is
built.

Security Council Affairs—the U.N.
“Military Secretary” according to
his duties as outlined in the U.N.
Charter. And he is a Soviet Com-
munist. Every man who has held
that key U.N. post has been a Soviet
Communist, It is he who first sees
and approves all orders coming
from the Pentagon and going to our
field commanders in Vietnam. You
need not believe me on this point
because you can get a letter from
the State Department which will
tell you how Comrade Leonid reads
and approves all Pentagon orders
before our men receive them. This
helps to explain the many ambushes
of our forces in Vietnam by the
Viet Cong and the North Viet-
namese. Thusly, as was the case in
Korea, because of our membership
in the Communist-dominated U.N.,
we are not being allowed to win in
Vietnam, and because we are fight-
ing under U.N. supervision and con-
trol, the Communists are actually
running both sides of the war. (In
this connection, the whole story is
available in one book, The Fearful
Master by G. Edward Griffin.

What's bugging
the forgotten
American now?

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

A cover story in the October 6
issue of Newsweek entitled “The
Troubled American: A Special Re-
port on the White Majority” is one
of the finest analytical studies ever
presented by a magazine. The arti-
cle is a must reading for anybody
who wants to know what is really
happening in the United States to-
day.

Through extensive research, and
with the aid of the Gallup Poll,
Newsweek asks, and answers, the
simple question; “What's bugging
John Doe.?” The article is enlight-
ening and distressing.

The Average American, some-
times called the Forgotten Ameri-
can, is the solid citizen, the back-
bone of our capitalist system, the
man who works on the assembly
line at General Motors and pumps
the gas at the corner service station,
the housewife and telephone opera-
tor. The Average American is many
things, but most of all he is pessi-
mistic. He is losing faith in the
United States.

Forty-six percent of the people
surveyed thought the country had
changed for the worse during the
1960's, while only 36 percent
thought it had improved, and 58
percent expect the country to worsen
during the 1970's, while only 19
percent expect improvement.

A general and sincere feeling of
frustration—with the Vietnam War,
with Negro demands, with crime
and civil disobedience, and with high
taxes — runs throughout Middle
America. The Average American
feels, and perhaps justifiably, that
he has been ignored in favor of
groups at the extremes of the econo-
mic scale—the privileged affluent
and people on welfare, both of
whom seem to benefit at his expense
in the current tax structure,

But the Average American will
not be ignored any longer. He is
using his majority status to register
his complaint at the ballot box.
Throughout the country, candidates
are appealing to the Average Ameri-
can, with successful results. Nowhere
is this more obvious than in New
York City, once the bastion of
American liberalism. Republican

than the above is the fact that the
United States Government is actu-
ally financing both sides of the war.
Not enough people know that we
are at war and that our enemy is
the total Communist bloc of nations.
Not enough people know that at
least eighty percent of the sinews of
war are being provided North Viet-
nam by Soviet Russia and its Euro-
pean satellites, Too few know that
this help to North Vietnam has been
made possible almost entirely by our
help to the Soviet Union and its
satellites.

It is not only true, as the Greeks
said, that one must eat before one
can philosophize; it is also true that
one must eat at least a certain mini-
mum of food, with a certain degree
of regularity, if one is to work on
the machines which turn out guns
in an armament factory. And it is a
further important truth that through-
out all history, as a general rule and
with only rare and temporary excep-
fons, people living in a communal
society of a completely socialistic
economy have been unable to feed
themselves. And with that in mind,

Some comments on this viewpoint

By Lex MeMillan

1 sincerely hope that if nothing
else Hilaire du Berrier’s “Back-
ground to Betrayal: The Tragedy of
Vietnam” is better written, more
understood and blessed with
shorter sentences than Mr. Bill Me-
Hhany's verbose tragedy appearing
on this page. Mr, Melthany has
thrown out a truckload of “facts”
which are supposed to prove some-
thing or the other. | really am not
sure what his point is. One of the
few conclusions | drew after read
ing and re-reading his article was
that we are surrounded by “dirty
Communists”, One really mind
blowing fact he skillfully proved was
that October 158 has been a tradi
tonal day of Communist protest
This startling effort took 13 lines
fobviously a witches’ plot)

Another nieresiing «aspect of
Melthany’s trivia is his benevolent
undersianding of the “vast majority
of those involved on our campus

motivated exclusively by the
most sincere, vet misguided, form of
His attitude is at the

easily

ilealiam

very least aggravating

In essence it seems that Melthany
has tried to make a very complex
matter out of a fairly simple event
which will occur Wednesday, Oct
1S. He charges that there “is a lock
of knowledge about what has really
been going on in Vietnam,” (the
truth will make you free) at the
same time resorting to cursing the
idea of not having classes on Oct
15. Ostober 15 would be the per-
fect time to enhance ones knowledge
of what is going on in Vietnam

The last half of his article con
tained three sentences, one of which
was almost beyond comprehension
I feel sure that one reason it was
dificult to understand is that I am
unfamiliar with the “facts” he was
slinging around, However, | fail to
see what difference whether or not
South Vietnam has had a non-com
munist government since 19054

of concern, active dissent and learn

Wash in gto nN and Lee Tuesday’s Players of the Week

tames H-S Tigers

By Mike Berry

Just about anywhere you go in
Virginia this time of year you will
find cool mornings, hot days, and
brilliant colors. Much to the joy of
a certain individual on the General
squad, this time of year is called
“Indian summer.” It's a time of
Homecomings, Tobacco bowls, road
trips, big football games, keg par-
ties, and combo parties. Hampden-
Sydney was having an Indian sum-
mer affair last Saturday afternoon,
but they had little to celebrate.

The Tigers had just emerged from
“death valley” after receiving the
brunt of a tremendous second-half
comeback by the Generals. Death
valley is the affectionate term that
has been assigned to the Tiger's
football field. So named because,
evidently, some poor sucker died of
heat exhaustion while playing there
on a mid-October afternoon.

Che Washington and Lee Generals
went into Saturday's game with
Hampden-Sydney as a six-point un-
derdog. The Generals played the
underdog role for the first-half of
Saturday’s action. They went into
the locker room at the half down
13-0,

Then the Generals came out after
the intermission and completely
dominated the game. The true turn-
ing point came when sophomore
Mark Skoggard broke through the
Hampden-Sydney line to block a
Tiger punt. From then on the game
belonged to W&L. The offense and

 

a

the defense played together as one
unit. When the offense needed the
ball, the defense got it. When the
defense needed points to protect,
the offense got them. The whole
team jelled.

Chuck Kuhn fired three beautiful
touchdown passes, in addition to
coming up with the big play when
it was needed. Bruce Green made
two of the three TD catches while
Steve Mahaffey made the other
clutch grab, Frank Stearns came up
with vital receptions; Andy Smith
did an exceptional job of filling in
for Staman Ogilvie (another stand-
out) while Ogilvie was out with a
leg injury. | could go on and on
about the great job the offense did,
but something must be said about
the defensive unit.

Ihe Kumpuris brothers, Jay Meri-
wether, Mike O'Donnell, Scott
Neese, David Laughlin, and the list
goes on and on, played above and
beyond the call of duty. They put
on a demoralizing rush and were
backed up by an excellent pass de-
fense. John Nolan came up with his
fourth and fifth interceptions of the
year, and was joined by Brooks and
Graham with one apiece. The Gen-
erals literally blasted their way to a
21-13 victory.

This week's game pits W&L
against Tufts College of Boston in
the NCAA centennial game. It’s a
home game and will provide an ex-
cellent Opportunity for everyone to
come out and see the Generals in
action.

Washington and Lee's cross coun-
try team went to Roanoke on Octo-
ber 11 with a win and a loss and
came back with two wins and two
losses. The result of a tri-meet was
Roanoke College 40, W&L 41, and
Old Dominion 42, The Generals
came up with their best statistical
performance to date, but it wasn’t
enough to overtake Roanoke.

The Generals were paced by Bob
Sherwood, who came in 4th with a
time of 23:39. He was closely fol-
lowed by Bill Wilkinson, Sth at
23:43 and Dave Haydu, 8th at 24:27,
Roanoke runners came in 2nd and

with a runner at 22:06.

Next meet is on October 24 at
Bridgewater against the Eagles.

we might turn our attention to a
dispatch from Poland, first carried
in Die Pomersche Zeitung of Ham-
burg, Germany, and then reprinted
on December 26, 1966 in the Chic-

ago Tribune. lt reads as follows:
“Weapons of the Polish armed
forces are being shipped from Stet-

harbors . . . While on one side of
the Stettin harbor American wheat
is being unloaded from freighters,
on the other side of the same har-
bor weapons are loaded which are
being used against American soldi-
ers... The Poles receive the wheat
(from the U.S.) on credit and they
in turn ship their weapons to North
Vietnam on credit.”

March, Two Discussions Fizzle

Except for a few discussion groups
that didn’t come off or were acci-
dently locked out and an anti-war
march that failed to materialize, the
activities of the Oct. 1S moratorium
on the Washington and Lee campus
Wednesday were termed “successful”
by a moratorium coordinator.

The six talks in Lee Chapel Wed-
nesday morning were well attended
as approximately 500 people heard
talks from William Mclilhany, a rep-
resentative of the John Birch Soc-
iety: ev. Charles Swezy, associate
pastor of Lexington Presbyterian
church; Col. George Brooke, a his-
tory professor from Virginia Mili-
tary Institute; and three W&L fac-
ulty members,

Mclihany in his talk, “The John
Birch Society's Position on Viet
Nam,” proposed that this country’s
troubles in the war were caused by
a conspiracy between the govern-
ments of the United States and the

Several Virginia Schools
Observe Moratorium Day

Students throughout Virginia
marked Wednesday's Vietnam Mora
torium, the largest such protest in
the nation’s history, in a variety of

ways.

At the University of Virginia,
more than one thousand people
gathered near Thomas Jefferson's

statue to hear a series of speeches
conducted from the Rotunda, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch reported
Karl Hess, a former aide to Senator
Barry Goldwater who has become
a leader in the anti-war movement,
told the crowd that they were in
fact “rehearsing a general strike.”
Ihe paper that folk-sing
ing and a series of signs displaying
various points of political persuasion
were also part of the activities, to
gether with a seeming disregard for
the University’s long-standing dress

added

The Times-Dispatch added that
moratorium spokesmen reported a
60 per cent cutting average, but au-
thorities felt this figure to be highly
exaggerated,

More than one-third of Hollins’
faculty cancelled classes, leaving
moratorium observance to the indi-
vidual student, according to the
Roanoke Times. Over 500 chose to
attend discussion groups and some
heard Dr. James Crooks of the his
tory department term the Hollins
faculty “wishy-washy” on the mora-
torium

William and Mary students per
formed a mock funeral service, the
limes-Dispatch said. A coffin was
curried to the colonial capital,
where a vigil was maintained

The paper also reported that a
group of about 50 students atiempt-

Another mock funeral was con-
ducted at Virginia Tech, where, ac-
cording to the Times-Dispatch, 225
students participated in the placing
of dead leaves on a symbolic casket.
Lists of war dead were also read.

About 600 students appeared at
an afternoon teach-in on the Blacks-
burg campus. Campus police were
on guard to maintain flags at full-
mast,

Roanoke College was the scene of
a discussion forum Wednesday
morning. The Times reported that
Pham Chac Rau former South Viet-
namese ambassador to the United
States. told the audience that his
people are “fed up” with the war,
but predicted a “bloodbath” if the
country falls under Communist rule

Later, Roanoke students joined
others from Hollins in a night serv-
ice in Roanoke’s Elmwood Park
Amphitheater

The Times-Dispatch also noted
that students at Petersburg's Rich-
urd Bland College had boycotted a
proposed “free period” moratorium
observance, though some attended
Virginia State. Some
students circulated a petition signi
lying “unqualified support” for the
siminisiration’s policy,” the article

U.S.S.R. He asserted that the “con-
stant flow of aid and comfort to our
enemies must be stopped at once.”

Rev. Swezy asked the question
“Is South Vietnam a_ legitimate
political entity?” in his talk, “Con-
flict in Viet Nam: What are the
Issues?”. Sweezy then continued his
pursuit of the issue by asking if
South Vietnam isn't a_ legitimate
political entity—which he said it
isn't according to the Geneva ac-
cords—is our war there waged un-
der legitimate authority?

Col. Brooke asserted that “We're
playing right into their (the enemy's)
hands” by holding anti-war demon-
strations in his speech on “American
Obligations in Asia.” He discussed
“what might almost be called hys-
teria gripping the country on Viet
Nam.”

Prof. Milton Colvin of the politi-
cal science department in his speech
on “Viet Nam in the Long Perspec-
tive” said, “I do not object to the
war as such, but I do feel we should
get out of it.” He added that he
did not think this withdrawal
should be unilateral.

James Loesel, also of the political
science department, supported U.S.
disengagement from Vietnam im-
mediately in his speech “Unilateral
Withdrawal Now”,

Dr. H. J, Pemberton of the phil-
osophy department gave his thoughts
on “Temptations of the War’.’ He
expressed a fear that no side would
do “the good thing.”

The five discussion groups that
met Wednesday afternoon drew au-
diences totalling about 70 people,
including several girls from South
ern Seminary Junior College and a
group from Roanoke.

The discussion group that couldn't
get into its selected room was the
veterans of Vietnam group.

Stuart to Give
Poetry Reading

Prof. Dabney Stuart of the WAI
English department will read from
his poetry Wednesday at 7:30 p.m
in the WAL Bookstore.

The gathering will be an informal
one, according to Mrs, Betty Mun
ger. proprietress of the Bookstore.

Stuart joined the WAL faculty in
1965 after having taught at William
and Mary. A graduate of Davidson,
he attended Harvard graduate school

His works won him the Dylan Tho

An oversight on the part of mora-
torium coordinators appeared to be
the reason the group found itself
locked out of its room, Payne 1A,
according to one of the group's fac-
ulty leaders and university officials.

According to W&L superintendent
of janitors James Kirkland, no one
had told the school janitors before
the groups’ meeting time to unlock
the doors to the classrooms that
were to be used.

Kirkland also stated that it is
school policy to lock all the doors
in Payne Hall that can be locked
after classes as well as all the doors
to all other classrooms in the school.
He said the only reason the other
discussion groups found the doors
open was because he read on the
moratorium schedule posters that the
rooms were to be used Wednesday
afternoon. He had missed the sche-
duling of the Payne hall group in a

Henberg Cited

As Nominee

Swede Henberg, president of the
student body, has been unanimously
approved by the faculty as a candi-
date for a Rhodes scholarship.

The faculty took the move at its
meeting last week. James G. Ley-
burn, professor of sociology and
Rhodes scholarship liaison, announc-
ed the decision yesterday.

Henberg, the fourth-ranking scho-
lar in the senior class, will compete
for the scholarship with other stu-
dents from his home state of Wyom-
ng and other western states. In De
cember 32 candidates from all over
the country will be chosen from
more than a hundred applicants.

hurried reading of the poster, he
added.

Moratorium leader prof. Paul
Beebee agreed that apparently stu-
dent moratorium coordinators fail
ure to notify the janitors was the
problem.

The discussion group that failed
to come off was Rev. Swezy’s.
Swezy reported that no students
showed up at Washington Annex
where the discussion was to be held
He said he waited for a short time
and then went home.

Other discussion groups were
more successful. Loesel attracted be
tween IS and 20 people to his open
seminar in Newcomb Hail. Colvin
had 16 attending his seminar, also
in Newcomb, shortly after its 2 p.m
starting time. John Birch spokes-
man Bill Mcilhany drew a crowd of
approximately 40 people to his films
and discussions in Dupont audi-
torium.

About 15 people showed up on
the Commons lawn later Wednesday
afternoon to begin the scheduled
anti-war march. They waited around
for almost an hour for more people
to come and then called off the
event.

It was learned that several mem
bers of the anti-war faction on
campus opposed the march and that
in one meeting this week a group of
war protestors, predominantly fresh
men, voted against holding it

Wednesday evening a concert
gathering was held in the Student

Some Last Words

We have a few more things to say about the Oct. 15
moratorium before the matter ceases to be a concern for
journalists and becomes the sole property of historians in
search of significant moments in the life of this institution.

When the issue was first brought to the attention of the
student body via a New York Times ad, our initial editorial
response was to advocate participation in peaceful demonstra-
tions against the war by all who opposed it, in order for there
to be some way to judge the extent of student discontent with
the present policy in Vietnam.

At that time the idea of a non-partisan approach had not
been formulated, but had we known about it in time our
reaction would have been similar to that of many students
here. We probably would have questioned its propriety for
that date, since it was planned as a nationwide day of protest.
And that being the case, we would likely have despaired that
anything like a non-partisan stance could be maintained. The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi explicitly raised this objection, con-
cluding that partisan efforts had destroyed the possibiilty for
clear-headed reflection on the matter.

While it is true that the organizers of the non-partisan
“Day of Concern” program had formidable obstacles to
overcome, we judge, with a hindsight of which the Tuesday
edition didn’t have the luxury, that the effort was successful.

Dealing first with the matter of propriety, it is, we feel,
entirely appropriate for students at any time to make indivi-
dual re-evaluation of the war, and we find it especially needful
on a day which apparently was used elsewhere for students
vehemently against the war merely to reinforce each other in
their beliefs. An objective examination would have been a
fruitful addition to any observance of the moratorium.

The problem, and the desirability, of remaining entirely
non-partisan, as Tuesday advocates, is another matter. Prof.
Pemberton noted that much of the opposition to the war was,
symptomatic of our society, couched in the same terms and
employing the same techniques as support of the war. It is
after all as paranoid to find a CIA agent behind every column
as it is to find a communist behind every beard. Many stu-
dents reognized this and sought to depart from the militant
and reductive rhetoric of both sides, and the degree to which
they were successful is measured by the remarkable lack of
violence during these observances.

Yet W&L went one step further in moving away from
the dogmatic mentality that characterizes the dual monologues
(we can’t call them a dialogue) both wings have presented in
the past. The morning session offered every conceivable view
in the most objective manner possible. At that time the neces-
sary individual re-examination was called for, and we have
reason to believe it was effected in many.

It is, of course, true that the effort did not remain strictly
non-partisan throughout the day, but we don’t feel that fact
debases the value of the initial presentation, nor do we think
students here were obliged to remain neutral (that implying
inaction for the Tuesday edition).

In the largest sense even the morning session wasn’t non-
partisan, at least in the way the Tuesday edition construes the
word, i.e., as suspending prediletions and prior value judg-
ments in a completely objective re-examination of the war.
Rather, it was multi-partisan, presenting men who presum-
ably had already subjected themselves to the type of indivi-
dual re-evaluation the program should have elicited from the
rest of us. These men offered forceful defenses of views to
which they are very much committed.

We aren't pretending, of course, that between 12:30
p.m. and 2 pam. Wednesday everyone had a chance to ex-
amine his own mind thoroughly and commit himself to one
of the sides available thus justifying participation in the parti-
san activities of the afternoon and evening. We are convinced,
however, that many students had reached commitments after
careful thought, and we submit that not only were they within
their rights to act on the basis of their convictions, they were
obliged to do so. They were further obliged to maintain the
dignity and respect for other positions that marked the morn-
ing session. This they did, and so carried on not only the
content of the morning session, which was action based on
commitment, but also its spirit of fairness.

Neither can we concede the Tuesday edition’s point that
such demonstrations are of no avail. Their editorial asserted,
"We all should be well aware that the war in Vietnam is a
national disaster.”” Perhaps, we all should be, but VMI's Col.
Brooke, as well as most of the men who frame our foreign
policy, seem to overlook the self-evidence of the claim. Mere
thought on the matter is not going to reveal that truth to
them. Peace demonstrations or other public statements against
the war, especially insofar as they include “moderates”, can
make the nation’s leaders realize that the number of Amerti-
cans who agree with them is dwindling daily, and so political
pragmatism may accomplish what moral sensibilities have not.

We can then answer the question the Tuesday edition
poses——"Why not be non-partisan?” —-with the observation
that neutrality can only be carried so far. Fichte probably
said it best—"'Not simply knowing, but after your knowledge
to act is your destiny.”

Letters To The Editor . . .

 

 

Parent Looks At Rush

To the Editor of the Friday Ring-
tum Phi:

As a parent I was sorry to hear
the rush system was going to be de-
layed this year and happy when it
was moved back to the first week.

To clarify—I have a son in the
freshman class. I think it is easier
for a boy to concentrate on studies
the first semester if rush is over and
he does not have to worry about
making a good impression on frater-
nities all semester.

In most schools that have deferred
rush they find that by January boys
are selected on a much more deli-
berate basis, i.e, fraternities tend to
be marked. One has all athletes and
selects athletes—one tends towards
party boys—one has the scholars—
and one the boys prominent in acti-
vities. A quick one week rush leads
to more diversity in each fraternity.

If a boy should not adjust im-
mediately to college and his grades
should not have the required frater-
nity average, he may then have to
wait still another semester to pledge
—and spend another semester “on
edge”. Here an older fraternity “big
brother” would have been a big help.

I point out also—Dave Olson
contradicts himself,

Paragraph two: “One of the argu-
ments that fraternities have long
used against deferred rush is that
they would be over burdened finan-
cially.” He explains they would not
have the freshman house bill in-
come,

In the last paragraph he states
“The old system is antiquated, ex-
pensive, and unwieldy.” He has not
proved this to me,

Thank you for our complimentary

A Puppet IFC?

By JAY WETSEL
IFC Secretary

Structurally the IFC is a repre-
sentative body with the expressed
purposes of promoting better inter-
fraternity relations and enforcing
social conduct rules upon the frater-
nities. As such the organization,
which represents the largest number
of students of any on campus, is
expected to be a vigorous and pro-
gressive body, and because it has
not been so it has been the object of
much unfavorable publicity within
the past few weeks. If this concep-
tion of the IFC were true, such cri-
ticism would certainly be justified,
and I would applaud its authors for
bringing the inadequacies of the or-
ganization to the focus of campus
attention.

However, this is not the case:
there is a shadow government be-
hind the IFC which dictates what
the IFC can and will do, This sha-
dow, though most shadows are in-
nocuous, is the faculty, sometimes in
the guise of a faculty meeting, but
more often than not, it is the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee (SAC), curi-
ously composed of FOUR students
and SEVEN faculty. Any subsian-
tive matter, such as deferred rush or
girls upstairs in fraternities, must be
referred to the faculty for approval.

We are usually told when the
faculty is receptive to a given idea,
eg. girls upstairs in fraternity
houses; thus, in reality the IFC
operates within a narrow zone of
tolerance established by the faculty,

and any proposals which originate
in the IFC are either forwarded to
the faculty as being open to discus-
sion and possible passage or it is
dismissed, being contrary to current
faculty concensus. Such an environ-
ment is barren soil for creative ac-
tion on the part of the IFC.

Last year the faculty told us we
had to have a deferred rush plan
ready to be implemented in the fall
of 1969. We worked for seven
months, and submitted our plan,
meeting their every demand, but

Frat Parietals
This Weekend

This Openings Weekend 14 frater-
nities will be able to enjoy the newly
liberalized parietal rules passed by
the Student Affairs Committee sev-
eral weeks ago.

Seven fraternities received full
approval of their applications to
date. These are: Delia Upsilon,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Kappa Alpha,
Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Phi, Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Phi
Epsilon.

Tentative approval has been given
fo seven others, Chuck Cahn, IFC
president, explained that full pass-
age was not given because there
were one or two small points left
out of each fraternity’s petition that
“need to be incorporated before the
plan is completely acceptable”,

(Continued on Page 4)

they fell to bickering over details;
so we still have the old system.

They generously allowed girls up-
stairs in the dorms, though they were
there last year anyway, but they
can't seem to agree how the frater-
nities could enforce such a plan—
fraternity men being notoriously
wild and reckless as evidenced by
their irresponsible social behavior.

Remember that the IFC is a rule-
enforcing, not rule-making agency
of the fraternity system.

Recently, the IFC Judicial Board
punished a house for a rule infrac-
tion, but our decision, like those of
the Student Control Committee, are
reviewed by the faculty dominated
SAC (after all, students are naturally
biased), and our punishment was re-
placed by a more stringent one. SAC
admonished us to judge more re-
sponsibly next year, but who deter-
mines what is “responsible-?”

The faculty made the rules vis a
vis the shadow government, now
they want to enforce them. If the
faculty makes the rules and now
enforces them, obviously the IFC is
merely a facade created to make the
students think they have something
they don't—a_ responsible, self-gov-
erning fraternity system.

Why have an IFC? Why not let
SAC run the whole show? I, my-
self, dislike being merely a puppet
and policeman.

are the assualt of thoughts upon the
unthinking.”

An “Eleventh Hour Move”

By DAVE OLSON

Wednesday was indeed an historic
day in America. Thousands of stu-
dents and others joined in a protest
against administration § policy in
South Vietnam. At W&L Oct, 15
was something of a revolutionary
day. For the first time in a very
long while there was a demonstra-
tion of feeling about something,

Lee Chapel was filled Wednesday
with students who came to hear
about the war, They were interested,
concerned and polite. There was no
hooting or booing of speakers who
spoke in favor of the war, They
were greeted with what might be
termed polite applause, for obvious-
ly the majority of students in Lee
Chapel had decided to get up Wed-
nesday morning because they felt
strong misgivings about American
vction in Vietnam, But unlike many
campus demonstrators of today, they
were very peaceful as were the maj-
ority of demonstrators Wednesday
Wednesday may have offered hope
that the reverbial apathy which
pervades this campus is gradually
dying

The array of speakers that came
to the platform Wednesday was a
definitely homogeneous group, On
the political right was Mr. William
Meiihany who offered the John
Birch Society's position on the war
and on the left Prof. James Loesol

who advocated unilateral withdrawal
immediately. The most distinguished
speech of the day was offered by Dr.
Milton Colvin who advocated a
phased withdrawal immediately,
Maybe it was his brevity, but there
is little doubt that Dr. Colvin left
the most lasting and significant im-
Pression of any of the speakers

Of all the speakers the most dis
turbing was Col. George Brooke
who presented what has to be label-
ed as the sterotype “hawk” posi-
fon on the war, The incredulity
with which most of his comments
were received showed the absolute
unacceptability of this pesition to
event what is supposedly a conser-
vative student body.

Above all else what does Wednes
day mean? On the local scene it
shows that WAL students are finally
getting concerned about national
issties instead of remaining ambiva
lent in the face of what has been a
Brave national problem for four
years. In a kind of eleventh hour
move WAL has made known its
basic feeling—dissatisfaction

On the national scene it shows us
that students are turning away from
relatively minor campus problems to
more important national issues
There is no reason why the campus
should be isolated from national
problems, and students are now di
recting their aliention to the most

important of all national issues.
Hopefully, when (and if) the Viet-
nam “tragedy” is a part of the past
this will continue on the campuses
of the nation, that the students will
then turn their attention to Pressing
national issues instead of unimpor-
lant campus questions, In other
words, an end to selfishness and a
turn to worldly concerns.

I have read every word in all the
issues.

“The Great Split’’

To the editor of the Friday Ring-
tum Phi:

The great split was long in com-
ing, but it finally hit; the fission of
unity and identity evaporated, Stu-
dents at W&L are choosing their
swords, forged of emotion, to wield
in a battle of squires; squires who
are told that they are knights. Down-
fall is imminent as students grasp
for the emotionally inspired left and
right,

Actually political differences have
always existed at W&L, but they
have never been “forced” to be com-
pletely alienated before. Our appeas-
ing pedagogues and administrative
hierarchies have decided to try to
identify with youth and _ its pre-
supposed righteousness. By doing
this, change has been imposed, with
little regard to reason or precedent,
to give the student what he wants
(or at least what they think he
wants). What a liberal attitude, an
often suicidal application of reason:
decadence and floundering regres-
sion. The future holds many sur-
prises for W&L, such as chaos, radi-
calization, loss of honor and morals,
and physical intellectualism,

By allowing teachers to deprive
stuednts of a class hour they paid
for, Wednesday was a classic calam-
ity. Despite the fact that October 15
was planned to be a non-partisan
affair, the very fact that it was held
on October 15 was giving it the dis-
tinction of Papa lefty nepotism. It
was mot organized to be construc-
tive, simply because it could have
been held after classes. A true un-
biased approach would have been
an afternoon or night discussion on
a different day. This would have
alienated it from the national move-
ment, and yet would have been very
impressive because of its individual
approach as opposed to other
schools. Instead, the faculty only
listened to the screaming minority
and ran, smiling, to grant all wishes
and to profess its “progressive” at-
titude.

Would they have allowed such a
day if “October 15” had never been
heard of? Hell, no! Now what are
they going to do when the protest
lengthens to two days in November,
three days in December, and so on?
If one day is justified then why not
two or three? And if we really want
to get “relevant” why don’t we just
talk all day about whatever comes
to mind?

Next on the keep-up-with Harvard
scene is the racial issue, Now I've
heard that if I ask how many Neg-
Foes are on campus, they can't tell
me because they don't Specify a
Persons’s race on his record. Good!
I agree with the Policy of accepting
a man on his individual merits and
not on his race, religion, etc. Now
after asking the above question and
Belting the above answer, | would
like to ask why they go out and try
to recruit Negroes? The answer will
of course be paradoxical with the
one above. After all, we can't let
other colleges out do us: we want to
erin and say that W&L contains
~-——% White, —..% Negro, —--%
Indian, and --% Natufians, This
indicates our perfect indescriminat.
ing attitude. Really, what could be
more unbigoted than recruiting stu-
dents according to race, etc?

All hell is going to break loose
on our campus in a few years, but
we can't blame the students. A
great instittuion is dying of a self-
imposed fast, denying itself pride,
honour, order, and 4 remembrance
of what went before.

Some truth there was, but
dash'd and brew'd with lies,
To please the fools, and
puzzle all the wise,”
John Dryden

Generals to Battle Tufts
For Anniversary Game

Washington and Lee will mark
its 96th year of college football
when the Generals take on Tufts

Saturday in a nation-wide celebra-
tion of college football’s centennial,

The Generals made their debut on
the gridiron in 1873, defeating VMI
4-2. Since that time, W&L has pro-
duced many great teams, some mem-
bers of which will be honored at
halftime Saturday in addition to the

crowning of W&L’s Centennial
Queen.
H. K. “Cy” Young, a Hall of

Famer of the 1914 team, backs Sam

Mattox and Joe “Double-O” Arnold
of the 1934 squad, Tim Stark, Ray
Leister and Glitterin’ Gil Cocetti of
the 1950 team and Steve Suttle, cap-
tain of the 1961 squad, will be on
hand,

Also to be honored will be some
of the outstanding teams in W&l
history. The 1914 team was the un-
defeated South Atlantic Division
champs, while the 1934 squad was
the Southern Conference’s top team.
The team of 1950, representing the
champs of the Southern Conference,
was a Gator Bowl participant in

together the parts needed to form a
potent offense of their own, follow-

Golf and Tennis Over

In Fall Intramurals

League champions in intramural
tennis have been determined as the
season ended yesterday. Sigma Nu,
the defending intramural champion,
won its league as did the runners-up
from last year, Zeta Beta Tau. The
league champions, all undefeated,
are:

League A Sigma Nu 4-0

League B Phi Delta Theta 4-0

League C Zeta Beta Tau 4-0

League D Phi Kappa Psi 4-0)
The finals, a round robin affair, will
be played next Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday afternoons.

In intramural golf, the picture is
not as clear, as only two league
champions had been determined
afternoon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is
when play was concluded yesterday
the only team to escape league play
with an unblemished record. Pi
Kappa Alpha won its league and a
three way lie exists in the other two
leagues.

W&L to Meet
State Champs

The soccer team heads into the
last leg of the schedule’s most de-
manding weeks when they battle
state-champion Roanoke College on
Friday. After suffering a close 2-1
loss to Virginia last Friday, the Gen-
erals went on the road to take on
Lynchburg College. The contest
ended in a 3-3 deadlock that saw
neither team being able to capitalize
in two sudden-death overtime per-
iods,

Carl Hyatt opened the scoring for
Washington and Lee when he took a
Don Belt pass and beat the Lynch-
burg goalie, 14:21 into the first
quarter,

Meade Kampfmueller made it 2-0
at 21:43 of the first quarter scor-
ing a neat goal, coming in off his
position at right wing. Lynchburg
came back with a goal halfway
through the second period to make
it 2-1.

into W&L’s third goal.

Lynchburg bounced back to score
two second half goals while holding
the Generals scoreless, the game
ending in a 3-3 tie.

“I don't like to be satisfied with
a tie.’ Coach Lyles said after the
game, “but we're still undefeated
on the road and in that sense it was
a victory.” The coach said that the
offense had been sluggish in practice
after the Virginia game, but that
the defense had not let up for a
single moment. “Lynchburg had

Fraternity Parietals

Approved For Weekend
(Continued from Page 2)

“However,” he said, “those which
did receive tentative approval
will be allowed to have girls up-
stairs this weekend.” Beta Theta Pi,
Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi
Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha,
Sigma Chi, and Sigma Nu fall into
this category.

Phi Gamma Delta was the only
fraternity to have its petition fe
jected; Kappa Sigma submitted theit
plan too late to be ruled on. Delta
Tau Delta and Zeta Beta Tau have
not submitted applications to date.
By next week it is expected that all
petitions will have been received
and passed.

Contained in the various parietal
regulations are hours girls are al-
lowed above the first floor, which
for most fraternities are from ap-
proximately 5 p.m. Friday to 3 a.m
Saturday morning, 5 p.m. Saturday
to 3 am. Sunday, and from five
o'clock until midnight Sunday. Each
student should check the times for
his fraternity because these do vary.
At least one resident enforcing
member must be present in the
house during these periods

Gentlemanly conduct must be ob
served at all times and brothers can-
not infringe on the rights of others

In most cases penalties for in
fractions of any of these rules will
result in a fine of the offending per-
son and/or a weeks suspension from
the fraternity. Penalties also vary
from house to house

Lyles observed.

The Roanoke game today will
feature an All-American, Roanoke
College's star left wing Scott An

Honorable Mention for two years in
a row and is one big reason why
Roanoke was the state champion
last year and is 5-0 this year. It

ETS announces

dates for GRE’s

The Educational Testing Service
has announced the six testing dates
during the current academic year
on which undergraduates and others
preparing to go to graduate school
may take the Graduate Record Ex-
aminations.

The first testing date for the exam
is October 25, 1969. Scores from
this administration will be reported
to the graduate schools before De-
cember 1.

The other five test dates are De-
cember 13, 1969; January 17, Feb-
ruary 28, April 25, and July 11,
1970, Equivalent late fee and regis-
tration deadlines apply to these
dates. Choice of test dates should be
determined by the requirements of
graduate schools or fellowship to
which one is applying. Scores are
usually reported to graduate schools
five weeks after a test date.

Included in the Graduate Record
Examinations are an aptitude test
of general scholastic ability and ad-
vanced tests measuring achievement
in 21 major fields of study.

Full details and registration forms
for the Graduate Record Examina-
tions are contained in the 1969-70
Bulletin of Information For Candi-
dates. The Bulletin also contains

Freshman run-off is set

Six candidates remain in the runn-
ing for Freshman class offices after
yesterday's primary vote. In addi-
tion, a proposed constitutional
amendment was defeated.

Out of a field of ten candidates,
fom Mays a SPE from McLean,
Va., and Alan Prater, a Shreve-
port, La. Sigma Nu, remained in
contention for the Frosh Executive
Cominittee post. Prater was the
leader with some 93 votes while
Mays garnered 75.

Ihe Freshman Presidential race
saw Rick Gray from Dallas, Texas,
and Eddie Haslam of New Orleans
topping seven other candidates in
gathering themselves run-off berths.
Haslam’s 80 votes were high with
Gray just behind at 77.

Jeff Baugher, a Phi Kap from
Manhasset, L.1., and Jeff Burris, an
Indianapolis Sigma Chi finished first
and second respectively in the race
for the Freshman Vice-Presidency.
Baugher received 80 votes to Burris’s
75 while four other hopefuls were
further back.

In addition to the Frosh elections,
a constitutional amendment to
change the name of the Assimilation
Committee failed due to a lack of
votes. A majority of the Student
Body, or 716 votes, was required
for passage, but only 671 students
voted on the issue. There were 626

Last night, the IFC passed a reso-
lution which called for the sole
parietal jurisdiction of the IFC in
dealing with fraternity affairs. Sev-
enteen houses voted for the resolu-
tion; Kappa Sigma was unable to
vote because of lack of attendance
at previous meetings.

Faculty members of the Student
Affairs Committee—Messrs. Watt,
Imeson, Ray, and Hamer—attended
the meeting and offered comments
upon the resolution. Faculty com-
ments were generally unfavorable
because of several reasons, specific-
ally the financial interest of the Uni-
versity in the fraternities and the
control over fraternity affairs dele-
gated to the faculty by the Board
of Trustees, which in turn delegated
a large portion of this power to the
SAC.

The resolution reads as follows:
WHEREAS Washington and Lee
University is a small, liberal arts
men’s college, and its primary goal
is the education of young men to be
responsible citizens, and, as such,
the need for the University to act in
loco parentis does not seem rea-
sonable beyond the freshman year,
And social responsibility in any sit-

 

cake, IFC
to eat it, too

uation involving mature young men
cannot be dictated by the faculty or
any other organization,

And the men in fraternities at
Washington and Lee are mature,
aware, and competent enough to
gauge and enforce their own social
responsibility,

And the fraternity houses basically
compete with apartments as the resi-
dence of upperclassmen,

And a better balance of upperclass-
men living in fraternity houses
would be of unquestionable benefit
to both the fraternities and the Uni-
versity,

And the University does not see fit
to regulate in any way the social
conditions of any apartment

BE If RESOLVED by the Interfra-
ternity Council of Washington and
Lee University that the same condi-
tions should exist for the fraternity
houses as for unregulated student
housing, and the burden of social
regulation should rest solely upon
the individual fraternities, their
members, the girls’ schools, and the
girls themselves such regulation to
be completely within the jurisdic-
tion and under the auspices of the
Interfraternity Council.

On the flyleaf of the new collec-

Wilson Scholar, was awarded the
Howard Willet Prize for summers
work in poetry, the Dylan Thomas
Award of the Poetry Society of
America and a grant from the Na-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday, October 21, 1969

Openings and the Dance Board

The first bacchanalia of the year is now historical: the
cigarette butts have been swept from the tarnished floor of
WaL’s answer to Carnegie Hall; the fraternity houses have
all been mopped dry; the hang-overs and Alka-Seltzers have
both disappeared. About all that remains is the usual caustic
criticism of the Dance Board. In short, a typical Openings has
closed its chapter in the continuing story of General Lee’s
College.

The only part of this unchained melody we find disquiet-
ing is the large calibre rapid fire machine gun with over 1400
raucous barrels levelled at the Dance Board. We hardly need
to remind anyone that the Dance Board—rightly or wrongly
—is everybody's favorite whipping boy. But we do feel that
the responsibility to mediate in this perennial skirmish is in-
cumbent upon us. Of course, we do not expect to negotiate
any sort of lasting peace in the near future; we are simply
hoping for a momentary cease-fire.

One new complaint with the Dance Board echoing in
and around our portly columns these days does have consider-
able merit for a change. Doremus is not Carnegie Hall and
we do not wish to imply that the VMI Fieldhouse is. But,
VMI (acoustically-speaking of course) is a small step in the
right direction. Furthermore, we were assured by the Dance
Board that the concerts would be held there this year. The
Board’s excuse concerning the fact that Openings was held in
Doremus and not at VMI is reasonable—a scheduling con-
flict with VMI. However, this seems to be a symptom of poor
foresight in planning (which we concede is no easy task) .
We recommend that in the future the Dance Board prevent
such oversights and effectively close out one avenue of critic-
ism.

Other fusillades levied against the Dance Board are not
so easily dismissed, however. Many are simply the long-
standing by-products of hasty ill-considered judgement. Per-
haps the most vicious and unfair attacks against the Board—
simultaneously the most difficult to justify—are those con-
cerning the nature of the entertainment. The Dance Board
has about the same odds of successfully repelling one of these
attacks as Sisyphus did in rolling his rock up that hill in
Hades. The Board is trapped in that labyrinth of trying to
please all of the people all of the time. That just cannot be
done. However, reflecting on the three concerts thus far, we
consider the Dance Board to be making a genuine and sincere
effort in fighting this awesome battle.

Ian and Sylvia, Paul Butterfield, Martha Reeves—maybe
not all super-stars but we find it difficult to imagine wider
variety in entertainment.

This connects to a second source of disgruntlement with
the Dance Board, the quality of entertainment. The Board is
again occupying a definitely unenviable perch, for this second
dilemma approaches a degree of insolubility almost equal to
the first. Everyone demands big names in current entertain-
ment—the Board itself is no exception in this preference.
But what many of the barrels in the 1400-gun salute forget
is that powder is needed to drive a bullet; or, money—a lot
of it—is needed to bring top flight entertainment to W&L.
Too many expect nine concerts by the best nine groups in
the country. This would indeed be fine, if we had the re-
quired revenue. But two and two only equals four. Students
want the big names with the big price tags, but we only have
1400 students to share the bill.

Again, we feel the current Dance Board is exerting maxi-
mum effort in trying to solve this problem (granted this has
not always been the case in the past few years). But a certain
cooperation rather than sabotage from the critical student
body would greatly assist the Board. For example, last year
under considerable pressure the Dance Board initiated the
policy of selling individual student tickets. This practice was
designed for those students who either did not care to or
could not afford to purchase dance plan cards. The purpose
was to allow those students the chance to attend dance sets
by buying these tickets. Hopefully, the Dance Board would
profit as more people went to the concerts.

Accordingly, the Dance Board made the concomitant
statement that Dance plans were explicitly non-transferable.
It is a breach of the honor system to use another's card.
Worse, students who consistently engage in this malpractice
are not only jeopardizing their status in the University-——it is
punishable as an honor violation—but they are also under.
mining the same Dance Board about which they are complain-
ing. By depriving the Board of sorely-needed revenue, they
are restraining the Dance Board’s freedom of action in sche
duling future entertainment.

We had hoped that the Board would more stringently en
force their regulation procedures at the door during Open
ings. However, the Board was again lax in this area as they
had been at Homecomings. But how can they do better? It
would be a disappointing commentary on our “honor system”
if they were forced to deny students the rights of exit and re-
entry. But they may have no alternative.

To those students who delight in listening to their own
prattle about the sad state of entertainment we can only point
out that they have at least one opportunity to do something

constructive about if,

W&L alumnus, will speak in Lee Chapel tonight.

IFC

By Reeve Kelsey
IFC Senior Justice

he relaxation of parietal regula
tions that went into effect last week-
end were long in coming and point
up the faults in both the IFC and
the faculty. The initial legislation
was introduced into the IFC last
October 21. That it took almost one
year to implement the legislation
shows the entire inflexibility of the
present system.

The IFC is essentially powerless
in these areas as effectively explain-
ed in last Friday's Ring-ium Phi by
Jay Wetsel. It is powerless to change
much of the regulations surrounding
fraternities and most of its remain-
ing powers are subject to either
review or veto by the faculty or the
Student Affairs Committee. | would
hope that in the near future, con
trol over essentially student affairs
could be turned over to students or,
at least. a body which has student
representation equal to that of the
faculty.

One of the most important areas
of needed reforms continue to be
that of parietals. It is essentially a
question of equity. Why is there a
double standard applied to fraternity
and apartment housing? Why must
one group be discriminated against?
Why not let the girls’ schools set the
minimum standards? The faculty
policy of imposing socially restric-
tive regulations on the fraternity
houses and the upperclass dormi
tories clearly accentuates the ten
dency for the student body to frag
ment all over the town of Lexington

The answer lies in allowing the
collective fraternities in the IFC to
determine the social regulations un
der which it seeks to opearte. Much
criticism in recent years has been
levied at the IFC Judicial Board for
failure to aggressively enforce many
of the existing regulations. Bul what
could one expect from a body which
basically disagrees with many of the
provisions which it is charged with
enforcing? If the IFC were able to
set the policy that it had to enforce,
the effectiveness of the IFC as one
of the major imstitutions of student
government could reach its full po
tential,

One also doubts the rule-making
ability of an assembly of over 100
professors. Would a sientist claim
any competence over matiers regard
ing the curriculum of the Fne Arts
Department? Yet all members of the
faculty are thrown into the role of
experts in the matter on the prob
lems of undergraduate life. A com

Holton speaks today;
Governor W &L grad?

By Greg Thompson
fonight, Linwood Holton, the Re-
publican nominee for governor of
Virginia, will be speaking at Lee
Chapel . The event is being spon-
scored by the Young Republicans.

Holton, a native of Virginia, grad-
uated from W&L with a Bachelor of
Arts degree after serving in the
Navy as a captain during World
War II, In 1949, he received a LLB
from Harvard Law School.

As the Republican candidate for
governor in 1965, Mr. Holton poll-
ed the largest number of votes ever
cast for a Republican State Candi-
date in Virginia. It was the first
time in modern Virginia political
history that the Democratic candi-
date was elected by less than a ma-
jority.

As far as his political ideas are
concerned, Holton emphasizes the
improvement of the quality of state
education as well as the establish-
ment of an office of student affairs
that would keep him, as governor,
informed of the ideas and problems
of students. Also, he favors a re-
organization of the state administra-
tive system so that governmental
operations might become more effi-
cient and less expensive.

Last Wednesday at WGL

By Kevin O'Grady

Lee Chapel—hardly Faneuil Hall.
Six men spoke. The United States,
ind its government, still holds forth.
But for how long?

In the October 10 issue of Time,
the results of a poll of the class of
1973 were issued: “One out of every
three freshmen said that he believes
the U.S. needs some sort of revolu-
tion, and one out of five described
himself as either a radical or a revo-
lutionary four out of five that
politics is dominated by string pull-

ing special interest groups.” If, as
Time itself suggests, “. . . each new
class of college freshmen is more
radical,” the future of America does
not loom large.

Perhaps a revolution will come.
More likely not. But a large segment
of the American youth are truly dis-
satisfied with their government. The
politicians and the leaders of to-
morrow are bred in the colleges and
universities of today. If respect for
the Government and its policies is
not being fostered in today’s youth,

The Ring-tum

Mr. Holton, in this year’s cam-
paign, is judged to have an even
chance against his Democratic foe,
William C. Battle. Holton’s strength
as a candidate reflects the growing
power of the Virginia Republican
Party. If elected, he would be the
first Virginia Republican governor
of the century, and only the second
in the history of Virginia,

In 1865, Gilbert Walker became
the first Republican governor of
Virginia, an office which he was to
hold for four years. After Walker,
the Virginia Republican Party start-
ed to decline. With the defeat of
Mahone, a Republican candidate for
governor in 1889, the state Republi-
cans were severly weakened. The
plight of the Republican Party was
due to two basic setbacks: the con-
servative Virginia populace associat-
ed the Republican Party with Re-
construction policies, and the con-
stitution of 1902, which restricted
the electorate.

From 1925 to 1965, minor but
ever-present power of the state Re-
publicans kept Senator Harry Byrd,
a Democrat, in office. By Byrd's
death in 1966, the Republican Party
had to come to state power through
the leadership of Ted Dalton. This
is demonstrated by the victories of
the Republicans in the national elec-
tions of the 1960's,

Now that Byrd Decromats are
voting Republican, and that the De-
mocratic Party is being identified
with some of its unpopular national
policies, the Republicans are flying
high. Thus, Mr. Holton hopes that
such a political atmosphere will pro-
duce victory for him and his party
when election time arrives.

m retrospect

where are tomorrow’s leaders going
to come from? The United States
will probably remain a viable poli-
tical institution. But it may find it-
self as a second-rate country, led by
a medicore, short-sighted, sub-elite.
Change must come. The Vietnam
War must be ended as quickly as
possible. Domestic reforms must be
institutetd. Then, and only then,
can America insure itself of the
leadership and support that it usu-
ally lacks.

Above the future of the United
States lies the future of the earth.
The disease of war does not just
affect us, as the Arab-Israeli War
and the Sino-Soviet border clashes
indicate. Murder and death, in the
guise of “justifiable” war, have be-
come an everyday occurence. But
why? Albert Schweitzer in Civiliza-
tion and Ethics, remarks: “Rever-
ence for life affords me my funda-
mental principle of mortality, name-
ly. that good consists in maintain-
ing. assisting, and enhancing life,
and that to destroy, to harm, or to
hinder life is evil.” Are we, then,
immoral? Col. Brooke answers that
question rather well when he sug-
gests that since Italy lost 600,000
men in World War Hf and still sur-
vived as an autonomous nation, pro-
portionately in Vietnam we can af-
ford to lose 4,200,000 men. No, we
are not immoral, Rather, we are
amoral. We have lost the ability to
judge what is right and what is
wrong. We have lost the sense of the
value of a human life. Lord Byron,
in his poem “Darkness,” written in
1816, may well have foretold our
fate:

The waves were dead; the tides
were in their grave,

The moon, their mistress, had
expired before;

The winds were withered in the
silugnant arr,

And the clouds perished
Darkness had no need

Of aid of them-—She was the
Universe

Washington and Lee
beaten by Tufts’ Jumbos

By Mike Berry

The Jumbos of Tufts University
invaded Wilson Field on Saturday
afternoon and found out that they
would have a tough time convincing
the Generals, and themselves, that
they are supposed to be Number One
in the East.

After a start, the Generals
managed to make a strong offensive

late

drive. The drive was halted at the
Jumbo’s one yard line and they took
over. The Generals defense then

came into their own as they dropped
Jumbo running back John Dember
for a safety, The Generals were un-
able to make a consistent drive in
the first-half and went into the in-
termission trailing 12-2,

The Generals, for the second-
week in a row, proved that they are

a second half team. Chuck Kuhn
came out in the third period and hit
his favorite of late, Bruce Green,
for a twenty yard touchdown pass.
fhe Jumbos had matched the play
earlier in the quarter, however, and
the score then stood 20-8. In the
fourth quarter, Jack Baizley came
in to hit end Steve Mahaffey for a
nine yard scoring play.

As the game ended, the Generals
were on the Jumbo 35 yard line and
driving for the winning touchdown
that never came. The Generals lost
a heartbreaking 20-15.

The Generals were not able to
strike early enough in the ball game.
The strong finish they showed was
not enough to overcome the quick

THE RING-TUM PHI

Tuesday’s Players of the Week

Bruce Green-offense

Bruce Green, a junior flanker
from Fort Myers Beach, Florida,
earns Offensive pla yer of the week
honors for his outstanding effort
against Tufts. Bruce, a member of
KA Order and a returning letter-
man, caught seven passes for 130
yards, nearly half of W&L’s aerial
yardage, and scored one T-D.

 

Mike O’Donnell-defense

Winner of the defensive player of
the week title is Mike O'Donnell, a
hard-nosed end from Washington,
D.C, Mike, a sophomore Phi Psi,
has shown consistent improvement
throughout the year and really
sparked against Tufts. He contained
the Jumbo’s game and made four
solo tackles,

Why Bob runs C-C

By Tom Rowe

Ever since the Broadway show
came out some years back, people
have been asking the question “What
makes Sammy run?”, With the
American’s delight in slogans, they
like to extend it, for instance, to ath-
letes. What makes Jimmy Brown
run? O. J. Simpson, Maury Wills,
Jim Ryun, Jim Hines, et al.? At
W&L, you and I know that Joe
Namath can’t run (bad knees?),
before we brush off the question as
irrelevant, let’s use it one more
time. Like,
wood run?

Bob Sherwood is the greatest thing
to hit W&L country since,
why, since Harry Zeliff. It is ironic
that one of W&L’s ablest runners
should graduate the very year before
a worthy counterpart comes along.
Sherwood and Zeliff could have as-
sured W&L of many a cross country
win together. As it is, Sherwood is
holding up the 1969 contingent very
well by himself. What makes you
run, Bob?

“I guess you'd call it motivation
| get personal satisfaction from
running, and it keeps me in good
shape.”

The words come slowly, for Bob
Sherwood is a modest person, an
unusual trait for an athlete of this
generation. He isn't exactly sure
why he likes to run (“Nobody ever
asked me before.”), but he leaves the
impression that an outside influence
shaped his career,

“I had a coach in high school who
greatly influenced me. He talked
dedication, sticking with a sport,
oding the job right. His spirit had a
great effect on his teams. He has
always inspired winning teams as a
coach. He was at my high school
(Northern Highlands in Avondale,
New Jersey) only my last two years,
but he took us to the state finals
where we finished second.” Their
best runner, Bob says, was accepted
ut Kansas University, which has
been Jim Ryun country for the past
several years,

defending Va. champs

Friday W&L managed to score
only one goal, but it was one goal
too many for Roanoke College, the
defending Virginia soccer champ for
four years. It was one of Washing-
ton and Lee’s biggest wins in years
as they held the Roanoke power-
house scoreless.

Roanoke was flying high coming
into the game at Alumni Field. The
visitors had downed the Generals in
their last three meetings and _ this
season were 6-0. On defense not a
single shot had been scored against
Roanoke College this fall. On of-
fense a twice-time All-American left
wing, Scott Anderson, was a terror
in past matches,

But Washington and Lee realized
that a play-off berth for the Virginia
title depended on a win. The game
plan was based on field balance with
a One-on-one assignment against
Anderson given to Branden Herbert.
It was evident that whoever scored
first would be the winner.

Outstanding for W&L was goalie,
Ken Newman, who was credited

with ten saves. Both Brian Price and
Mark Sayers turned in outstanding
performances at fullback. At half-
back Carl Hyatt and Seamus Mc-
Keon did excellent jobs at both ends
of the field. Freshman Branden Her-
bert playing one-on-one defense
held Scott Anderson to one wide
shot. Meade Kampfmuellar who usu-
ally plays hot and cold did well also.
Sophomore Don Belt hustled hard
helping on defense as well as offense.

The only score of the match oc-
curred with 4:57 expired in the
fourth period. The ball took a short
bounce and Seamus McKeon smash-
ed it in from the right side, from
a distance of 35 yards.

With its three toughest games in
a row under its belt, W&L emerg-
ed 1-1-1, losing only to Virginia
last week. That makes the Generals
2-1-1 in conference competition and
4-1-1 overall. With a brief rest over
Openings Weekend, Washington and
Lee must get ready again for those
next door neighbors, V.M.I. The
Keydets invade Alumni Field at
3:15 Wednesday.

 

Thunder’s Theories

Money and professional sports

By Thunder Thornton

It's hard to believe that the World
Series ended just last week and al-
ready professional basketballs are
bouncing on arena floors throughout
the land, What is more, pro football
players have already labored through
games numbering in the double fig-
ures, counting exhibitions, and re-
gular schedules have barely been
dented,

The point is that professional
promoters have scheduled their un-
derlings for a few extra games of
the almighty dollar. Thank good-
ness sport fans were spared the
agony (or boredom) of extended
playoffs in the two major baseball
leagues, As it was, the Orioles
could not fill their stadium for the
opening game of this year’s annual
October classic, which may become
a November classic if present trends
continue,

There had to be an excuse for
these playoffs, so the owners devised
the division system in the once sane
National and American Leagues.
Ihe true baseball fan should be irate
that he was cheated of seeing the
Amazin’s climb over San Fran-
cisco, Los Angeles, and Cincinnati,
us well as the Cubs and the Braves.
And what if they had remained lov-
able, laughable, and last—under the
new system they could only be sixth,

a position that smells of first divi-
sion,

But pro football surely must be
regarded as the haven for many
owners, Once the NFL-AFL merger
becomes practiceable next year, the
fans will have the chance to witness
the Browns and Colts rubbing el-
bows with the like of the Dolphins,
Patriots, etc., etc. I guess the next
step is to incorporate the Roanoke
Buckskins into the big leagues.

How long can any one of our
professional sports claim to be the
American national game when the
fans can't keep pace with the manu-
everings of the management. Who
knows when the Oakland baseball
franchise might show up in Las
Vegas, or we might wake up to find
that the NBA and ABA have merged
under a five division, thirty-seven
team format. Pro athletes are be-
coming more and more skillful and
exciting, but their talents are being

Bob has had four years of experi-
ence in high school, Bob is much
stronger and a better runner.”

But Miller added that Zeliff’s as
sets, which made Harry a good run-
ner and W&L’s mealticket the past
few years, were an exceptional will
to win, hard work, and determina-
tion, Bob is a more natural runner.

In stressing that Sherwood has
his prime ahead of him, Miller con-
sidered hills to be the main area for

prostituted by greedy club owners.

It is unrealistic to think that the
powers will ever let go of a good
financial thing; in fact, more teams,
divisions, and playoffs are probably
in the offing. There must be, how-
ever, some point at which public
opinion will find all this ludicrous.
In the meantime, that paragon of
sanity and stability, college foot-
ball, should have gotten a foothold
on the populace. The college sche-
dule is a feasible nine of ten games,
there are plenty of rivalries, and the
collegiate game is catching the pro
version in excitement,

improvement. Sherwood, coming
from the flat country of New Jer-
sey, isn’t used to running up hills.
He needs to condition himself so
that he won’t be worn out by W&L’s
terrain. Another problem is that he
ran no more than two-mile courses
in high school. The course at Roa-
noke last week, for instance, covered
over four miles.

All signs point to Bob making the
adjustments to insure a long, suc-
cessful career. His stocky frame (6
feet, 160 pounds) carries him well
over the course. Bob is the kind of
guy who always gives one hundred
percent and runs his best from
personal pride. However, nothing
succeeds like success, and the will
to win that made Zeliff and the vic-
tory pattern that is emerging as
part of Sherwood’s style may soon
become the dominant make-up of
what makes Bob Sherwood run,

The Generals did manage to con-

This week’s game pits W&L
against Bridgewater College. Bridge-
water has been having a rough sea-
son, losing the majority of its games,
They do not pose a strong threat,
but they are being played in their
own backyard and they will not be
a pushover by any means.

Alumni Conference
Studies University

Yesterday afternoon a_ three-day
conference of alumni representatives
from across the country began.

Following a luncheon at | p.m.,
the delegates met in Lee Chapel at
2:30 p.m. to hear reports from Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley; James
W. Whitehead, University Treasur-
er; and Farris P. Hotchkiss, director
of development. All three spoke on
“The University Today and Its Out-
look for the Future.”

President Huntley delivered the
main report, outlining the recent a-
chievements and needs of the uni-
versity. His purpose, he said, was to
“improve depth of alumni communi-
cations” and to “face changes and
restlessness of a new age.”

Huntley reported that nearly $6
million has been spent for new faci-
lities in the last fifteen years, These
developments include the new alum-
ni house, the new science building,
duPont Hall, renovation of the Co-
op, the bookstore, new upperclass-
men dorms, Evans Dining Hall, and
the Student Union.

He also remarked that the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty is among the
best paid in the country. Also, fi-
nancial aid has increased consider-
ably. Almost 25% of the W&L stu-
dent body receive financial aid in
some way. There has also been an
increase in faculty size, number of
courses offered, and equipment and
research facilities.

Concerning physical needs of the
university, Huntley remarked that
“at this point, funds are not at
hand.” He outlined some of the
planned improvements,

In the near future the University
will build on to the rear of Doremus
Gymnasium, tripling it in size. A
fieldhouse to accommodate indoor
practice of some sports is also being
contemplated. Bids for the gymnas-
ium have already been sought.

Huntley also reported that Me-
Cormack Library and the School of
Commerce building are both inade-
quate. A possible solution, he said,
would be to move the School of
Commerce into the library, and
build a new library. A possible site
for the new structure would be the
edge of the ravine that lies northeast
of the campus, through which the
creek flows.

Other needs include a new School
of Law building, additional upper-
class dorms, and an auditorium, al-
though the auditorium does not have
top priority.

The new buildings will probably
be located, in the area on the edge
of the pine and beyond ii, ex-

panding the campus greatly in that
direction. At this point, though, no
plans are definite.

Parking space would be provided
for students eventually, though not
directly within the campus area.

Yesterday's session was devoted
mainly to finances and attracting
new funds, although all other issues
will be discussed today and tomor-
row. After the session, the alumni
attended a reception at President
Huntley’s home and then a dinner
at Evans Dining Hall.

This morning there was a tour of
the University. Following lunch, the
alumni met in an open forum with
students, at which no faculty or ad-
ministration members were present,

A discussion of the academic side
of W&L was held in Lee Chapel at
3:15 p.m. today. Tonight there will
be a reception and dinner at the Tri-
Brook Country Club,

There will be a discussion to-
morrow at 9 a.m. on student affairs
and athletics; at 10:45 a.m., a pro-
gram on the faculty; and at 11:45
a.m, President Huntley will review
the entire conference. All sessions
will be in Lee Chapel.

The conference ends at noon to-
morrow, after which alumni and
wives will be provided transporta-
tion to the W&L football game at
Bridgewater College.

the total amount for the 1967-68

fiscal year, Hotchkiss said,

“Last year was a very good year
for Washington and Lee in_ this
area,” Hotchkiss said. “Because of
the interest of many people, we
have realized a significant increase
over previous years in gift support.

“However, with the challenges to
privately-supported higher education
and the costs of education ever in-
creasing, this performance will have
to be improved upon in future years.

“Gift income has been increasing
steadily at Washington and Lee, al-
though as a percentage of the Uni-
versity’s overall costs of operation,
it is still not taking a greatly en-
larged part in University financing,”
he said.

Hotchkiss noted that gifts have
moved from approximately 12.5 per-
cent of Washington and Lee's operat-
ing income in 1960-61 to about 15
percent during the past year. How-
ever, the total operating income has
more than doubled in that time—
from $2.2 million to $5.1 million.

Troubadour Theatre Director Lee
Kahn, assistant professor of fine
arts, said he chose the play because
he considers Pinter to be an import-
ant contemporary playwright who
will become even more important.

The play, which premiered in
London three years ago, concerns a
man, his brother, and his two sons
living together in a womanless
world, Into their world comes a
third son, who is returning home
after an absence of six years, and
his wife, whom the family has never
met,

The conflict in the play, accord-
ing to Kahn, is within the characters,
not among the characters.

Approximately 50 students have

Car Petition

A petition to allow freshmen to
have cars on campus has been pre-
sented by officials of the Independ-

Dean John said yesterday that he
has already passed the petition on to
the Student Affairs Committee, who
will investigate it and give their re-
port at the next faculty meeting.

According to Harvey Wise, presi-
dent of the Independent Union, the
petition was circulated by eight
freshmen members of the IU and
bears approximately 175 names.

Prater Captures

Debater Alan Prater defeated
fom Mays in yesterday’s freshman
elections, thus winning the right to
represent his class on the Executive
Committee. The position of class
President was won by Rick Gray,
who came from second place in the
primaries to beat Eddie Haslam.
Jeff Burriss, captured the freshman
vice presidency over Long Island-
er Jeff Baugher.

The elections, concluding a week
of campaigning for the six candi-
dates, were marked by a low fresh-
man voting turnout, Less than 60%
of the class cast votes yesterday, a
decrease from Monday’s primaries.

Wednesday night, prior to the
election, all six hopefuls presented
their platforms to the student body.
Almost fifty people attended the
speeches given in the Evans Dining
Hall.

Jeff Baugher was the first speaker
of the evening, and explained to
those present his reasons for runn-
ing. He stated that he thought the
vice president should act as a sort
of middleman, between the class and
the administration. Vice President-
elect Jeff Burriss, whose campaign
slogan was “The Sensible One,”
would like to see the use of class
dues better explained. He also pre-
sented the idea of introducing sev-
eral pass-fail courses to the Fresh-
man curriculum.

Rick Gray admitted that the
“powers of the President are limit-
ed,” but that he would attempt to
increase the numbers of vending ma-
chines in the dorm. One interesting
proposal he made was that of the
possibility of putting washers and
dryers in the dorm.

Attacking the right of the Univer-
sity to interfere with the “dignity of
the individual,” Eddie Haslam ques-
tioned the school’s position of act-
ing in loco parentis,

Both E.C. candidates avoided
issues; instead they were more con-

Presented

Wise promised to give the petition
“the complete and total support of
the Independent Union.”

Dean John said the SAC, “is
presently examining campus park-
ing facilities to see how many more
cars WA&L’s parking lots can ac-
commodate.”

This study could possibly take
several months, he said, speculating
that “it is extremely unlikely that
freshmen will be permitted to keep
cars in Lexington this year.”

He added that “parking will be
the big problem should the admini-
stration allow freshmen to drive.”

ditions to warrant grievances, It is
his responsibility to search for and

Alan Prater felt there “is a differ-
ence between being representative of
one’s class, and being a representa-
tive of the class.” If elected he pro-
mised to put his own views aside

A Right Way...

The past few weeks here we have witnessed several efforts
on the part of students to assume the responsibility that is al-
ready theirs and to achieve results with it.

Notable success has followed the attempts of the Student
Curriculum Committee and the Independent Union to gain a
faculty hearing for their respective proposals.

The Curriculum Committee has submitted to its faculty
counterpart a resolution requesting extension of the present
pass/fail option. Not only would sophomores be eligible to
take a pass/fail course under this proposal, but juniors and
seniors would be allowed to take pass/fail more than the one
elective to which they are limited under the present rules.

The move is a signifigant one and presents an idea we
have long favored.

Similarly the Independent Union has petitioned the ap-
propriate faculty groups to allow freshmen cars. Clearly the
desire is to offer a better social life, especially to Independent
freshmen, thus presenting the fraternity system with another
challenge.

There are some objections to be made against such a plan,
but it does merit the deliberation the Independent Union has
assured it will get.

We don’t wish at the present time to debate the advan-
tages and shortcomings of these proposals. What we rather
want to point out is the method, both appropriate and ration-
al, with which these proups have presented their arguments
and made their requests.

In both cases the presentations are thorough, unambigu-
ous, and directed to the appropriate faculty groups in a way
which has assured for them maximum consideration and a
final decision based on the merits of the case alone.

These are two examples of the ideal operation of the
University—dialogue between student and faculty engen-
dering the spirit of respect and cooperation without which no
educational institution can maintain itself.

... And A Wrong Way

Unfortunately, not all student groups seem to adhere to
the ideal of cooperation and rational dialogue.

The Interfraternity Council Monday night passed a reso-
lution questioning the authority of the faculty, and particu-
larly of the Student Affairs Committee, to regulate the so-
cial atmosphere of fraternity houses.

The point is a sound one. Every generation of students
should be able to re-evaluate its relationship with the par-
ental authority the University imposes and to reach with
the faculty an amicable arrangement which is more attuned to
the moral realities of the age. Further, the IFC put forth
some convincing arguments for their case.

There are likewise some objections to be made. For in-
stance, the analogy between fraternity houses and apartments
is some what unsubstantial, and the resolution fails to take
into account the extent to which the University is financially
involved in fraternities.

But despite some problems, the resolution deserves the
serious attention its method of presentation nearly preclud-
ed for it.

What essentially happened was that the Judicial Board
prior to the regular Monday meeting sought and got for the
proposal the approval of all the house presidents. It was
then to be presented in the meeting, to which the predomi-
nantly faculty Student Affairs Committee had been invited.
They were handed the proposal only moments before it was
brought to a vote and asked to comment. Of course, they
could say nothing.

After the vote, itself an apparent (though perhaps not
intended) act of arrogance and irresponsibility, a verbal ex-
change on the subject, notable only for its virulence and un-
productiveness, occurred.

Had not informal discussion groups later convinced SAC
members of the sincerity and spirit of cooperation most of
the IFC members possess, the evening would have been a
total waste and the resolution would have been rejected with-
out consideration. As it is, there remains at least the chance
that something beneficial will result.

We are not accusing the IFC hierarchy of consciously
devising a presentation intended only to embarrass some of
its closest faculty friends and to confuse the issues. It is certain-
ly the case that that was almost the end result, and the Ju-
dicial Board ought to have foreseen the problem and taken
steps to prevent it.

Neither are we suggesting that the current student-fac-
ulty relationship tne rights and authority is tenable
for any long period of time. It will, however, require more
time to arrive at a viable solution than the IFC seems will-
ing to allow.

The problem is that the IFC, at last moving in a direc:
tion most students probably approve, took its initial steps in a
way that precludes the spirit of cooperation and respect nec-
essary for it to realize its goal. And unless the IFC retreats
and takes a rational and reasonable approch to the situation
(SAC, by taking no action this week, has afforded them the
time), it is likely very soon to become mired in the image of
irresponsibility it is trying hard to escape.

Motherhood, Apple Pie and Archives

By Lawrence McConnell

When one mentions the word
“archives,” the immediate impres-
sion evoked is one of old dusty do-
cuments discarded in a dark room
somewhere. And, as brought to
much-needed light in Mack Wood-
ward’s article in the October 14
issue of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,
WAL’s library contains many ar-
chives—which are dusty documents
discarded in dark rooms upstairs.

Washington and Lee has accumu-
lated a tremendous amount of ar-
chives as a result of alumni con-
tribution of letters, books, and do-
cuments over the past 100 years of
the school’s history. Lamentably, no
cataloguing of these archives was
ever done: and so they (as Wood-
ward aptly put it) “sit and rot.”

So. The problem now becomes
should we or should we not do any-
thing about cataloguing these arti-
facts? No one is actively against
archives—just as no one is protest-
ing against motherhood or apple
pie. But who is for finding some
way of caring for old archives?

Mr. Maurice Leach, the school’s
Librarian, is. And so are several
alumni that have sent inquiries to
Mr. Leach about the facilities for
storing records and valuable books
here. Unfortunately, these alumni
have sent their historical documents
somewhere else because our facili-
ties would not be suitable for the
storage of their documents, One case
in point is that of a man who want-
ed to send Washington and Lee his
collection of war letters of the Con-
federacy, but decided to send them
elsewhere when he learned about
storage and cataloguing conditions
here.

Not only are the archives in our
present possession wasting away, but

we are also missing the chance to
collect more valuable documents
from alumni and friends of the uni-
versity. It might seem a bit laugh-
able now, but W&L could become
the center for valuable documents
in the history of Virginia.

One letter to Mr. Leach illustrates
what we already have. The author
of the letter is a prominent historian
of religion who happened to browse
through the pile of documents in
McCormick Library. “From = my
examination of the Zachariah John-
ston papers and the George Baxter
papers, | am delighted and impress-
ed with the importance of a num-
ber of these for Virginia Presby-
terian history and for the story of
the achievement of separation of
church and state... | hope, for the
sake of scholars in general, you
will be able to move ahead with the
indexing and publicizing of these
holdings.”

Another letter to Mr. Leach is
from a gentleman who plans to give
a collection of letters and documents
to W&L, but regrets that there is no
archivist to look after them. “Wash-
ington and Lee will receive, how-
ever, my quite considerable library
of local histories—S.C., N.C., Va.,
and Ga. .. . Sorry there is no archi-
vist available there, for this collec-
tion will require an expert to straigh-
ten it out. It covers nearly fifty years
of collecting...”

Perhaps the most enlightening and
significant letter of all those sent to
Mr. Leach is from the head of the
Rare Books and Special Collections
Department at the University of
Virginia. The following is his ob-
servation on the state of the archives
in McCormick: “. . . there is no
doubt in my mind that you should
make every attempt to allocate pro-

 

Letters To The Editor . . |

 

An Answer to Perkinson

To the editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

After reading Brian Perkinson’s
rather erratic polemic in last Fri-
day's paper, | was determined not to
answer it, but the temptation has
proved overwhelming. Before try-
ing to criticize effectively Mr. Per-
kinson’s argument for social stagna-
tion at WAL, I must say that I have
no hope of persuading him to my
point of view; the emotionalism of
his letter convinces me that he is
beyond that—-which is why I hesitat-
ed to answer it, However, I trust
that the sensible reader will judge
Mr. Perkinson’s argument and my
case against it and the way it was
presented on their relative merits.

The first half of Mr. Perkinson’s
letter was given over to a denuncia-
tion of last Wednesday's Morator-
ium and how it was conducted here.
Perhaps a case is to be made against
last Wednesday's occurences on a
number of points, most of which Mr.
Perkinson barely touched in his rush
to judgment. He mentioned teachers
depriving students of class hours
“they paid for” and then hurried on
to something else. | don't think Mr,
Perkinson stopped long enough to
consider his point, which involves
a question of educational philoso-
phy.

Perhaps Mr. Perkinson can ap-
preciate only the time he spends in
class, but I also enjoy a scholarly
atmosphere which lends itself to an
objective discussion of the prob-
lems of individuals in their political
and social structures, Mr. Perkin.
son doesn't even think that our dis-
cussion of Vietnam should have
been scheduled for last Wednesday
1 disagree with him on this, too,
but the important point is that a
certain balance must be struck be.

tween Mr. Perkinson’s way of think-
ing and somebody else's on the other
end of the spectrum. | believe that
this balance was successfully struck
last Wednesday by the faculty and
those involved in the Moratorium.

The preceding and certain other
points are what Mr, Perkinson and
| could probably discuss in a con-
structive manner. What really con-
cerns me, though, are his thoroughly
destructive prevarications about
“Papa lefty nepotism” (whatever that
means), the “screaming minority,”
and a question like, “If we really
want to get “relevant’ why don't we
just talk all day about whatever
comes to mind?” These kinds of as-
persions on a certain group's mo-
tives, on what was actually their ex-
cellent conduct, and, finally, even
on the group's intelligence were com-
pletely unwarranted.

In the end they probably render-
ed the basis of Mr, Perkinson’s argu-
ment laughable in the mind of the
average reader, which needn't have
been the case. An imperfect analogy
can be drawn between Mr. Perkin-
son's tactics and the Nixon Admini-
stration’s imputations of disloyalty
last week which were an insult to
men of such long service to their
country as Arthur Goldberg and
Averell Harriman—who endorsed
the Moratorium.

Regrettably, Mr. Perkinson didn't
rest his case against progress at a
certain point, but went on to mourn
this university's policy of trying to
induce the enrollment of qualified
black students. In so doing, Mr, Per-
kinson was, | trust, defining himself
us a conservative idealist. A useful
example of this type is the Supreme
Court of the early 1930's, which
ruled much of FDR's greatly needed
social legislation unconstitutional be-
cause it perceived the constitution as

(Continued on Page 4)

per space in McCormick for special
materials and to provide money in
the budget for staff to arrange, cata-
logue and care for them. Washington
and Lee has been fortunate over the
years in receiving books and manu-
scripts that are important to scho-
larship and it has an obligation to
preserve these materials for future
scholarship.” (Boldface mine).

Washington and Lee does have
“an obligation” to begin the task of
compiling what is presently in rot-
ting disarray. To accomplish the pre-
servation of these archives, several
actions must be taken.

(1) A fulltime archivist must be
hired, one who knows the value and
methods of  systematizing the
mounds of materials we have at pre-
sent,

(2) Some part-time help must be
given this archivist from the library
staff in order to aid him physically
with the job.

(3) Provision must be made for
the temperature control of two re-
served rooms in the library to pro-
tect these documents from extremes
of temperature which tend to cause
deterioration.

Any change for the better at Wash-
ingion and Lee seems to be preced-
ed immediately by the expenditure
of money. And if we are to have
any change for the better in the case
of our archives, it will, without
doubt, cost money, But the preserva-
tion of W&L’s archives would be
more than just a change for the
better; it would be a discovery of
what we have (no one seems to be
quite sure what’s there), a restora-
tion of the valuable documents that
W&L men of the past wanted the
university to have, and a boost in
prestige for our archives,

“No one is against archives.” At
present, that’s the only sort of posi-
live statement one can make.

“Last Summer’s” Moment

By Robert Baroody
Editor-in Chief of Ariel

There is a scene in Last Summer
that makes this movie a good one; in
fact, this three minute segment may
be the most eloquent statement of a
troubled generation yet to be found
in recent film history. The setting,
appropriately enough, is a movie
theatre on Long Island.

Three adolescents are watching
what we assume to be an adult
movie: two boys, obviously on the
make, flank on either side of a
sensuous sophisticate of sixteen
named Sandy. Both of the boys be-
gin to nibble simultaneously; fin-
gers mesh and wiggle together, look-
ing very much like one fifth of a cen-
tipede in heat. The hands of the boys
then stray to those parts of the
female body that hands usually stray
to. The rhythm of their fingers is
at first searching, but as the boys
realize their mutual bond of sensual-
ity, they lean in on Sandy from eith-
er side and soon her shirt grotesque-
ly bulges with ten lumpy knuckles.

(Next week, my first installment
of Naked Came the Stranger, Part
Ml will appear in this very same
space!)

This simile of “groping in the
dark” reappears throughout the
movie as the group attempts to at-
tach their destiny to an existing set
of ideals, much as we at WAL must
continually persuade ourselves that
this hassle called education has some
value.

In fact, what makes Last Summer
work is based on that familiar pro-
cess of identification that we applied
to Goodbye, Columbus and The
Graduate. The characters in Last
Summer are very nearly siereotypes:
Sandy, the girl whose bikini straps

are forever slipping off of her shoul-
ders, whose mother’s lover is simply
the Long Island version of Benjamin
Braddock’s father; Rhoda, whose
prototype was Piggy in The Lord of
the Flies; and if we look across the
street we notice that Lexington
abounds with Peters and Dans
spawned from the same overindul-
gent environment. We need only
substitute Chevy Chase for Short
Hills.

From the very first frame this
sense of identity is firmly established
by the blast of WABC radio, one of
the very few symbols that is common
to young people in the Northeast.
Similar symbols and actions are
used to reinforce our sense of gen-
eration so that we think we know
the characters in the film as well as
ourselves. (Even the experience of
the first joint has now become a
movie cliche.) These children are
not human beings, but rather dis-
tortions of the same; and in this
form are capable of shocking our
conditioned sensibility. The most
alarming piece of dialogue occurs
early in the film as Dan says to
Peter, “Hey, do you think we ought
to lay her?”, to which Peter replies
“Who?” brilliantly punctuating the
bizarre, if not absurd use of the
first person plural,

Almost all the rest of the dialo-
gue is overly glib: predictable words
are spoken by predictable types, a
common fault of every movie pro-
duced by people over 40 years old
for the under-25 group. Last Sum-
mer atones for this weakness how-
ever, by exposing us to leisurely per-
iods of silence, the most moving of
which concludes the film by stimu-
lating our memory process. What
did you do three, four or five years
ago?

first half as both teams could not
generate much offense. Much of the
play was at mid-field with the half
backs dominating the play. V.M.L
had a golden opportunity, though
in the second quarter when one of
the Generals fullbacks failed in trap-
ing the ball and V.M.L.’s left in-
side had a one-on-one break away
to the goal. Goalie Ken Newman
moved out to cut off the angle, and
the move worked as the shot veered
to the right of the net.

The third quarter saw a revitalized
W&L team take the field, though. It
took V.M.I, only 4:13 to succumb
to the pressure of the quick W&lI
attack as Chip Tompkins took an-
other Kampfmueller cross pass and
drilled in the Generals second goal

Carl Hyatt, the best offensive half-
back on the team, moved up from
his position to take a pass from the
left side at 16:34 of the third quar-
ter Hyatt threaded his way
through the = struggling V.M.1.
defenders and beat the goalie
to give W&L a secure 3-0 lead.

Coach Lyles started substituting
freely at this point. The fourth quar
ier saw a lot of close checking as the
offenses of both teams stalled. Chip
lompkins let go a high loop shot
from thirty yards out at 20:03 of
the final quarter, and the ball sail
ed over the outstretched arms of the
V.M.1. goalie, thus ending the WAI
scoring in a frustrating game for
the Keydets

“It wasn't one of our better games,
but Til take it,” Coach Joe Lyles
said after he had seen his young
team up its record to 5S-I-1. “I
thought it was going to be hard to
get up for this game after three ex
tremely tough ones in a row, but
that early Belt goal took the pres-
sure off. V.M.1. was 0-4-1 coming

The only thing that spoiled last
week’s Football Centennial Celebra-
tion at Washington and Lee was the
fact that Tufts beat the Generals in
a stormy match 20-15,

Nearly forty former gridders re-
turned to Lexington to relive past
glories. Among the group were
George Haw of Richmond and Daw-
son Trundle of Bethesda, Maryland,
the last surviving members of the
1902 team. Also honored were W. E.
(Tex) Tilson, head coach of the
1934 Southern Conference cham-
pions and seven of his charges,
George Harrison, Charles Sweet,
Joe (Double-O) Arnold, Lewis Mar-
tin, Ed Seitiz, George Lowry, and
Sam (Monk) Madison were on hand
to recount that 7-3 season.

Dave Waters, Joe McCutcheon,
Charles Smith, Jack Garst, Ray
Leister, Roland Thompson, Jim

Stark, Bob Goldsmith, Gil Bocetti,
and Mike Radulovic represented the
1950 Southern Conference champs
who participated in the Gator Bowl.

Eighteen members of the 1961
team which was voted the nation’s
Outstanding Small College, eleven
by the Washington Touchdown Club
were honored: Robin Wood, Mickey
Walker, John Lee, Tommy Good-
win, Sam Preston, John McDaniel,
Henry Sackett, Bobby Payne, Joe
Howson, Charley Gummer, Bill
Wheeler, Barton Dick, Courtney
Mauzy, Steve Suttle, George Cruger,
Jerry Hyatt, Chip Day, and Ned
Hobbs.

Each former player received a
Centennial certificate and medal at
Saturday's halftime activities. In ad-
dition, the ex-gridders were guests at
the 1969 squad’s pre-game meal and
were also honored at a post-game

Phi Delts Capture Tennis Title

With the arrival of cooler weather,
the fall Intramural season is luckily
drawing to a close. The Phi Delts
have already captured the tennis
championship. Sigma Nu, last year’s
champion lost to the Phi Delts, 3-2,
and thus failed to defend success-
fully. Z.B.T., the second place finish-
er a year ago, fell all the way to
fourth place. Phi Psi took third
place. The final standing and points
for I-M tennis are as follows:

1) PDT (League B) 3-0 100 pts
2) SN (League A) 2-1 95 pts
3) PKP (League D) 1-2 90 pts
4) ZBT (League C) 0-3 85 pts

The championship playoffs in

touch football begin next week. The
Phi Delts and Phi Kaps and the
team representing the Law School
each won their leagues. Three teams
ended the regular season tied for
the championship in the remaining
league. In the playoffs to determine
the league champion, SAE beat
DTD on Wednesday and then lost to
Phi Psi on Thursday. Thus Phi Psi
is the winner.

The finals in golf are now being

University Center
To Offer Lectures

The first of nine scholars schedul-
ed to lecture at Washington and Lee
University under the Visiting Scho-
lars program of the University Cen-
ter in Virginia will appear next
week,

Dr. Richard B. Sewall, professor
of English at Yale University, is to

the C. Douglas Dillon Professorship

Both lectures will be open to the
public without charge. They will be

Sewall, whose appearance is spon-

an almost “divine” law, rather than
as a Viable social contract, the ideals
of which are inviolable.

Such a limited perspective as Mr.
Perkinson’s, coming in this singular-
ly deciesive chapter of the national
experience, is extremely unfortun-
ate, Large portions of our popula-
tion, not only but especially black
people, are socially and economi-
cally deprived, and the hands of our
most prestigeous institutions, among
them universities, must not be tied
in dealing with such vitally import-
ant problems.

Baker is first,
Bruyere third
at La Salle

At La Salle College over the
week-end, Kevin Baker—Co-Cap-
tain of the W&L Debate Team—
was chosen the best speaker out of
104 debaters, representing nine
states and 32 colleges. Further, Bob
Bruyere, a freshman, debating in his
first varsity tournament, was chosen
the third best speaker. Baker and
Bruyere debating as a team won §
of 6 debates and finished in third
place as a team.

Bruyere, until he and Baker were
defeated by the Univ. of Mass, in
the semi-final championship round,
had never lost a college debate, hav-
ing won twelve straight in novice
tournaments at W&L and La Salle.
The Baker-Bruyere team received
three trophies at La Salle, more than
any other school participating.

This weekend, W&L will have
more debaters at more tournaments
than at any time in its history. Tim
Wright and John Reynolds, along
with Kenny Murov and Baker, will
go to Emory. An all freshman team
of Alan Prater and Bruyere as one
team and Larry Evans and Andy
Bradshaw, the latter two being also
at La Salle with a 2-3 record, will
go to the National Wake Forest No-
vice Tournament, while Charles
Smith, Bill Radigan, Cal Seaton, and
Mark Grobmyer will go to Susque-
hanna in Pennsylvania.

Henberg announces plan
for Building Fund Drive

By Steve Ory

The Executive Committee meeting
last night was plagued by faulty
fuses and pesky photographers. The
season opened with the swearing in
of freshman committeeman Alan
Prater and Law School freshman
committeeman John Markham.

Phil Thompson announced the re-
sults of the freshman Law School
elections. In addition to Markham’s
election to the EC, Stuart Hurt was
elected president, Steve Annand was
elected vice-president, Lock Hand-
ley was elected secretary, and Sam
Painter was elected treasurer.

Swede Henberg announced a Uni-
versity building fund drive which
is to begin within eighteen months
He appealed to the EC on behalf of
the administration for suggestions
for student involvement. The dis-
cussion was tabled and a committee
composed of Ogilvie, Tompkins, and
Azuma was formed to report sug
gestions at a later date.

Henberg also echoed complaints
from alumni that were forwarded to
him from last weekend's Alumni
conference. Henberg related that
many of the young alumni were dis
appointed by the admissions depart
ment's failure to use them in seek-
ing students for WAL. Dean Kum
puris said that he was working with
Dean Hotchkiss to remedy the situa
tion. The suggestion was made that

Jeff Burris, Freshman Class Vice
president, proposed that it be made
mandatory that all class officers at-
tend EC meetings and conceivably
be given Executive Committee vot-
ing status. He stated that a larger
representation would better relay
the needs of the student body and
would more responsibility to
the class officers. The proposal met
strenuous objection from Kumpuris,
Markham, Prater, and Ogilvie.

j IFC petitions faculty for

parietal control in houses

Last night’s IFC meeting saw the
beginning of several minor changes
in the IFC Constitution and By-laws
and the passing of a modified mo-
tion on parietals.

[he parietals motion was intro
duced, according to President Chuck
Cahn, to assure the IFC that the
motion would eventually reach the
floor of the faculty meeting. Cahn
has introduced a similar resolution
before the SAC, of which he is a
member, but if it is defeated, his
personal motion will not go to the
faculty. The IFC motion, even if
defeated by the SAC, will go to the
faculty,

The motion, introduced by Reeve
Kelsey, reads: “The Interfraternity
Council of Washington and Lee
University petitions the faculty to
allow the Interfraternity Council to
have control over the regulation of
women in the fraternity houses—
both in the making and enforcing of
policy. The existing judicial struc-
ture of the IFC Judicial Board and
the Student Affairs Committee shall
remain intact.”

The major constitutional change
elevated the junior justices from a
non-voting Status (voting only when
a senior justice is absent) to the
status of full associate justices of the
Judicial Board. This change only
recognizes what has been fact for
the last few years,

Several changes were made in
\rticle IL of the Constitution which
would have effectively prohibited
any non-national social fraternity at
W&L. Danny Leonard objected to
this stating that changing the Con-
stitution would limit the options
available to the fraternities, and that
many were questioning the benefits
of national fraternity affiliation, The
proposed change was voted down
with 16 votes against the change,
one abstention, one house ineligible
to vote. The remaining changes pass-
ed with 17 affirmative votes. These
changes must be voted on again in

News Analysis

By Roy Carlton

Last week in the presence of all
five faculty and administration mem-
bers of the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, the IFC passed a resolution
concerning parietals which has pro-
duced nothing but faculty criticism.
Indeed, this was to be expected from
the wording of the resolution which
all but demanded that fraternities
have the right to regulate their own
parietals free from University con-
trol,

Passage of the resolution was fol-
lowed by what was intended as a
dialogue between the IFC and the
SAC’s faculty wing. But this high
plateau of reason was never reached
despite the sincere efforts of both
groups. The reason is that there was
a basic disagreement over the func-
tions, direction and authority of the
IFC,

It was the contention of the IFC
representatives that they were au-
thoritative in themselves, indepen-

Max (David Christovich) criticizes one of his brothers for his coward-

 

dent of faculty authority. Their be-
lief was quickly shattered by the
faculty members present who ad-
vised them of the derivation of their
powers from the Trustees through
the faculty. Thus, in effect, every-
thing the IFC does is subject to re-
view by the faculty.

With this established, dialogue
over the resolution became point-
less. The IFC was obviously not in a
position to demand anything from
the faculty. Clearly, a restating of
the IFC stand on parietals was in
order.

Last night the IFC passed a sec-
ond parietals resolution. The content
was basically the same in that it
asked for control of parietal regula-
tions independent of the faculty, but
the tone of the resolution was a far
cry from that of last week. In effect,
it was a measure of the IFC’s in-
adequacy as an authoritative body

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, October 28, 1969

Abolish the IFC;
or make it an IFC

The 1968-69 academic year at Washington and Lee was
marked by a high degree of student and faculty activism. This
activism came in the form of implementing academic and
social changes that majorities of both the student body and
faculty desired. Student-faculty communication which facili-
tated processes of cooperation was an important asset in
effecting these changes. The student government through its
varied forms was able to participate and influence the faculty,
which maintains the power of issuing ultimate policy.

Not all the changes students and faculty had in mind were
forthcoming last year however.Two major items noticeably
absent from last year’s logbook are deferred rush and parie-
tals. Branches of student and faculty governments are now
turning their attention to these problems. The power of the
faculty in these areas is unquestionable; the power of that arm
of the student government involved, the IFC, is.

Cooperation with the faculty was a guideline, if not a
goal, last year of such branches of student government as the
Executive Committee and the Curriculum Committee. If the
students again desire to participate in the process of change,
they need a responsible and respected voice. Under existing
circumstances, the Interfraternity Council is not able to pro-
vide that voice.

The IFC is consciously seeking more authority over its
own, or what would seem its own, affairs. However, this power
must emanate from the faculty. Before the IFC can hope for
the faculty to delegate more authority, it must gain the re-
spect of the faculty.

The IFC is currently projecting an image of irresponsibil-
ity—a veritable International Fun Circus. But what does the
IFC have the power to do? Those who would believe that the
Interfraternity Council represents the eighteen houses on
this campus are victims of a cruel hoax. Constitutionally, the
only power delegated to the IFC is that of levying fines. But
even this process is subject to review by the SAC. In reality
the fraternities have no real lobby.

Therefore, the so-called irresponsibility of the IFC is
easily explainable from a structural frame of reference. The
purposes of the IFC are dual but mutually conflicting. Its
dominant purpose is to try to act as a lobbyist for the collec-
tive fraternities. The natural goal of the council is then the
protection of fraternity interests when those interests are
threatened by an outside agent, such as the Dean of Students,
the SAC, or the faculty in general.

The second function consists of the self-governing of the
fraternities. The Judicial Board is the major institution in-
volved in this area. The attitude of the Judicial Board is rather
to avoid finding violations unless direct action is imminent by
another body, such as the SAC. Similarly, the Judicial Board
tends to be lenient in prosecution. Decisions rendered are
based on the criterion of what is the minimum penalty the
SAC will inflict so that a house will escape with the littlest
amount of pain.

The predominant attitude of the Judicial Board then is
not the self-government of the system but the self-protection
of the fraternities. It is small wonder that the faculty remains
hesitant in yielding to the fraternities more than a token of
real power over their own lives.

Unfortunately, a malevolent paradox exists. The Inter-
fraternity Council must demonstrate more responsibility in
order to gain respectability—hence, power—in the eyes of
the faculty. But, by nature, the IFC is unwilling to act as the
faculty thinks it should—a responsible arm of student govern-
ment. But does it have the power to act responsibly? Can the
Judicial Board be expected to enforce rules sent down from
above, from a source it instinctively fears? Evidently, if the
[FC wishes to lift its feet off the ground, it will have to do
this. But what assurance does the IFC or the Judicial Board
have that acquiescence would work to their advantage so that
they would not in effect be feeding sheep to the wolves?

As we see it, there are only two alternatives. Either the
Interfraternity Council, which represents the largest number
of students on campus, dissolve itself and put an end to the
ruse its mere existence perpetrates, Or the faculty delegate
some authority to the IFC, thus making available a respon-
sible and authoritative institution of student government.
Then, perhaps, we can start tackling some of the real issues,
such as deferred rush, and quit playing games.

Toward self-regulation

By Reeve Kelsey

We would like to take issue with
several of the points made in last
Friday's editorial, “. . . And A
Wrong Way.” The editorial blithly
states that there is no relationship
between apartment and fraternity
housing, yet the editorial does not
say why the analogy is not valid,
The fraternity houses compete with
the apartments (and the upperclass
dorms) to attract the upperclassmen.
In comparing fraternity and apart-
ment living, only a handful today
would choose a fraternity house if
they had the choice.

Presently there is a notable ab-
sence of juniors and seniors living
in the fraternities and a rigorous en-
forcement of the regulation requir-
ing fraternity presidents to live in
the houses may result in some of the
more able fraternity leaders declin-
ing to seek the office of the presi-
dency.

The apartments offer two distinct
advantages—1) privacy and 2) no
restrictions of any sort. Under the
present system a sophomore living
in an apartment would have more
social freedom than a senior in the
fraternity house. Social restrictions
or codes of behavior should best be
left up to the individual fraternities
and the IFC. We cannot see how the
financial interest of the University
would be jeopardized by this change.
On the one side of the balance is the
potential for additional juniors and
seniors living in the fraternities and
less of a threat to the financial stabil-
ity of the fraternties if it is required
to make juniors and seniors live in

the house due to a small sophomore
class, on the other side of the bal-
ance what is there? How could
these reforms undermine the finan-
cial and membership stability of the
fraternities?

We would also wonder why the
vote last Monday was “an act of
arrogance and irresponsibility”? We
will grant that it was not the most
tactful maneuver the IFC ever exe-
cuted, but does arrogance and ir-
responsibility mean standing up and
saying that which has been in the
back of many an IFC member's
mind for several years?

One of the rather startling occur-
ences of that Monday night meeting
pointed to the breakdown of com-
munication between the IFC and

the Student Affairs Committee. The
SAC members seemed to be surpris-
ed at the IFC resolution because
they felt that they had just enacted
the reforms which the fraternities
desired. Yet the IFC had been led to
believe that only a carbon copy of
the dormitory regulations would be
able to pass. The SAC did not un-
derstand what the fraternities really
wanted, and the IFC did not realize
the willingness of the SAC to con-
sider that which they really wanted.
We would hope that IFC-SAC
bloodlettings will occur more fre-
quently in the future. Much of the
problems of the last few years could
have undoubtedly be lessened if one
group really knew what was on the
mind of the other.

The I ndependent Union petitions
faculty to grant freshmen cars

By Lex McMillan

| saw Friday that Dean John was
presented with a petition requesting
cars for freshmen. The Independent
Union sponsored the petition and
this I feel to be very significant in
that the present rule concerning cars
hurts the Independent students more
than anyone else on campus. The
students don't have the same ad-
vantage of a number of fraternity
brothers who will cither see to the
transportation of their dates or lend
them their cars.

Dean John has passed the petition
on to the Student Affairs Commit-

To the W&L Trustees:
too much for one man

By Reed Byrum

Alumni relations at Washington
and Lee have vastly increased both
in importance and scope during the
past several years. They have
erown far out of proportion to the
present facilities which are now
concerned with them.

Almost a third of our 14,000
alumni now participate in active fi-
nancial support of their alma mater,
representing an increase of 300%
since 1960, During this same period
the amount of capital contributions
has risen by almost 700%, Sach
vast increments accentuate the need
for an enlarged staff to handle the
vital necessities of such an integral
part of our university.

The 1964-66 Self-Study Report
cited a proposal for the appointment
of an associate director of alumni
relations, listing it as “urgency No.
2° (of immediate concern to the
University, with special funds and
approval required) and as being an-
ticipantly fulfilled by 1966-67, To
date, no action has been taken on
this idea, but this perhaps may be
for the betterment of relations. For,
in essence, this recommendation
iacked scope, as it failed to realize
the phenominal growth of our pro
eram. A separation of duties in the
lines of relations and finances is
sorely needed, and the appointment
of a co-director in charge of contri-
butions has become a necessity.

Mr. Washburn, who presenily
deals with all aspects of alumni re-
lations, has performed excellently in
his position, but the job is too great
for any one person to handle. A
man who can concern himself totally

with the promotion of the Univer-
sity with the purpose of receiving
contributions in mind is needed; he
must be a person who is able to
merge the talents of a business
manager and a public relations ex-
pert. Mr. Washburn could then con-
tinue to fulfill his chief duty — one
in which he has proven his irreplace-
able value-—of establishing a viable
relationship between the University,
the students, and the alumni, with a
somewhat lightened load.

tee. who will consider the matter
and give a report at the next faculty
meeting. Dean John did say that one
problem is student parking and that
it is very unlikely that freshmen will
have cars this year.

Though I heartily agree that park-
ing will be the major problem if
freshmen are allowed to have cars,
I feel it is a minor problem and
should not long stand in the way of
freshmen having cars. If the move
to give students a choice between
fraternities and Independent status
is to be at all successful this change
will have to be made.

As it stands now very few stu-
denis make the voluntary choice to
be non-fraternity men. The large
majority of students who have this
status had their decision made for
them by the system. It is imperative
that the administration move with
all possible haste to make a non-fra-
ternity status an attractive and a
competitive alternative to fraternity
life.

One problem which was discussed
in the Alumni Student luncheon
was that of apathy. It was pointed
out by one student at the meeting
that one of the major contributions
to this problem was the over-empha-
sis on fraternities. Students feel that
their most important objective in the
early part of their career as a col-
lege-man is to get into a fraternity.

W&L OAS

to be only one
on East Coast

By John Motsinger

Developments during the past few
days have made the success of the
Washington and Lee Model Or-
ganization of American States im-
perative. Plans for a National Model
OAS to be held in Washington fell
through as a result of Mr, Nixon’s
planned policy statement on Latin
America being scheduled the second
day of the conference. All speakers
refused to make any statements prior
to Mr. Nixon's speech, and the Pan-
American Union, a major sponsor
of the model, was skeptical about
holding a student model at the time
of the conference.

This makes W&L’s model doubly
important. First, George Washington
University planners for the National
MOAS are counting on the W&L
conference to maintain and further
interest this year in the organization
and, secondly, Washington and Lee
will have to be prepared to take the
windfall from National’s cancella-
tion.

Having been saddled with an in-
tercollegiate responsibility encom-
passing the whole Eastern seaboard,
student planners here have the
chance to execute a major confer-
ence on this campus. Here is a
chance to show our expertise in In-
ter-American relations, in diplomacy
and in administration.

What will be the windfall for
Washington and Lee from _ this
Model OAS? Primarily, there will
be a chance for students here to
participate in a simulation, A simu-
lation is akin to a war game in that
persons have to react to situations
demanding from them the knowledge
and skill of a diplomat. The Univer-
sity has held very successful Mock
Conventions which utilize the con-
cept of the simulation. The accur-
acy of our Mock Conventions re-
flects upon the educational value
of the simulation, as does the parti-
cipation of all of the student body
in the convention.

The Model OAS strives for this
accuracy in its own intercollegiate
simulation. The major difference is
that we invite other colleges to com-
pete with each other and to interact
with each other. We should be able
to learn from other students at other
schools by the mere fact of their
presence on this campus, apart
from their participation in our
model. Where’ we see isolation on
this campus—in the academic field
particularly—we also see a step be-
ing made to break down some of
this isolation.

Last year, members of the student
bodies of Madison, VMI, Prince-
ton, Old Dominion, American U.,
Mary Baldwin, Hollins and Ran-
dolph-Macon participated in the
Model OAS here. Since then, our
reputation in the field of intercollegi-
ate simulations has increased tre-
mendously as Washington and Lee
teams have shown their strength at
two national simulations and sev-
eral smaller simulations by being on
the only team to win more than one
national award last year.

Washington and Lee has the ad-
vantage this academic year of offer-
ing the only OAS model in the Eas-
tern United States. At a time when,
according to Mr, Nixon, our highest
priority is finding a solution to the
problems of our neighbors to the
south, a model of this sort on this
campus will be an important con-
tribution to our own understanding
of hemispheric relations and will
make that same contribution to the
more than fifteen colleges and uni-
versilies expected to participate here
next March.

Troubs present Pinter play

By Kirk Woodward
Critic

Harold Pinter may well be the
representative playwright of this
decade or so. Tomorrow through
Saturday night the Troubadour
Theater presents Pinter’s best play.
The Homecoming, giving WAL au-
diences a chance to experience his
fascinating style for themselves

You can feel Pinter's style under
your skin. It's the everyday world
turned a little cold, the way a chair
used to look vaguely alive and larg
erthan-normal in the dark when
you were a kid. Lenny says in the
play: “Il mean there are lots of things
which tick in the night. don't you
find that? All sorts of objects, which,
in the day, you wouldnt call any
thing else but commonplace. They
give you no trouble. But in the night
any given one of a number of them
is liable to start letting out a bit of a
tick. Whereas you look at these ob-
jects in the day and they're just

commonplace They're as quiet as
mice in the daytime.”

Pinter's world is like that. You
can hear his style. You'd say, “I've
got lo put this clock somewhere so
it wont make so much noise”
Lenny says, “Well, if its the clock
I'd better de something about it
Stifle it in some way, or something.”
In his speech Lenny's word “stifle”
ticks in the night, a faint signal of
menace, something in the air.

Time affects people differently in
Pinter's plays than in, say, Tbsen’s
The past in Ibsen is continuots,
moving into the present. In The
Hemecoming, though, Ruth talks
of her past as a series of still-lifes:
“We used to pass a a large
while water-lower We went
down a path on stones
There was a cold buffet.”

The present is fragmented in the
same way, Listen to Max talk about
his late life: “That woman was the
backbone to this family with a

will of iron, a heart of gold and a
mind,” And: “Mind you, she wasn't
such a bad woman. Even though it
made me sick just to look at her
rotten stinkine face

Each member of the family lives
separate from other members and
from parts of himself. Each lives in
a world like a dormant voleano, a
world of destructive energy which
still looks much like Ruth's picture
of America: “It's all rock, And sand.
It stretches so far every:
where you look, And there's lots of
insects there And there's lots
of insects there.” Her fire is con-
trolled. The men tend io explode

Pinter unites all these elements
and more by putting all the charact-
ers on stage. His people reveal them-
selves by their words, their rela-
tionships, their silences. if the audi-
ence listens. You should not miss
the experience, especially since reli-
able advance word says the Trouba
dour production is first-rate.

 

 

 

 
THE RING-TUM PHI

 

WEL player
for this week

 

JoJo Martin

JoJo Martin, a 180 pound offen-
sive halfback has been selected as
player of the week for his perform-
ance in the 10-6 W&L victory over
Bridgewater last Saturday. The most
consistent ground-gainer in the Gen-
eral rushing attack this season, JoJo
again led the infantry Saturday,
helping W&L to even their record
at 3-3 for the year. JoJo, a repeat
player of the week performer, is a
sophomore SAE from Midland,
Texas. This hard running and elu-
sive back has been a source of
pleasure and excitement to fans and
coaches alike.

W&L beats Bridgewater

By Mike Berry

Football, like any other game, is
a game of emotions, You can be a
three touch-down underdog one
weekend and a three touchdown
favorite the next. If a team has guts
it will play its best when it has to.
As a result, on many fall weeeknds
you find teams losing and winning
when they shouldn’t.

If you have been following W&L’s
Generals for the past two week-
ends you know what I mean. The
only thing, however, is that the
Generals couldn’t quite follow the
pattern of spoiling the predictions.
They nearly defeated Tufts Univer-
sity and were nearly overcome by
the Bridgewater Eagles.

The Generals were favored at
Riverside field in Bridgewater, Vir-
ginia; but, as was expected, the
Eagles gave the Generals a fight to
remember.

The Generals struck early in the
first quarter and managed to hang
on to win. The touchdown came
when Chuck Kuhn hit Bruce Green
on a 43 yard scoring toss. The Gen-
erals scored again in the second
quarter when Jack Baizley added
insurance points with a 35 yard field
goal,

Bridgewater came right back after
the field goal with a 65 yard scoring
drive. The drive was anchored
around the excellent running of
Marshall Flora. Flora posed a prob-
lem for the General defense all
afternoon as he carried the ball 36

times for 168 yards,

lhe General defense played when
it had too, however, and managed to
stop several Bridgewater drives, The
game was somewhat of a dissapoint-
ment for the Generals. It did, how-
ever, lift the General overall record
to 3-3 and the state small college
record to 2-1, which will be good
enough for second place in the state,
and, if Hampden-Sydney upsets
Randolph-Macon, they will be in a
three-way tie for first.

Ihe Generals have three games
left, all with conference foes, They
kick it off on the road this weekend
against Sewanee. The Generals are

favored even though it is Sewanee’s
homecoming game. However, the
Generals are ripe for an upset since
few Southern teams lose homecom-
ing games.

The Generals have managed to
establish a winning streak on the
road this year and should continue
to do so, They'll be a long way from
home this weekend so you won't get
to see them in action. They do prac-
tice from 4:30 to 6:00, Monday
through Friday so any time you
would like to drop over and see the
team, or Murph, or Mr, Corrigan
or the coaching staff, it’s free and it
is support.

 

Sports in General

Attitudes about W &L athletics

By John Robinson
Sports Editor

Since de-emphasizing its athletic
program, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity has fostered two differing
opinions. The first being that things
simply could not be worse. In con-
trast the second being that things
could not be better.

Ihe possessors of the former
opinion have definite gripes. The
Generals who were once the terror
of Virginia and boasted of national
rating in everything from football
to track are now forced to face un-
known opponents, This group claims
that de-emphasized sports mean a
complacent and boring brand of
competition. The result is a draw-
back rather than a contribution to
student life.

However, the opposing school of
thought quickly counters each of
these claims. To this group it seems
financially impossible for a small
university to import the necessary
jocks to bring the necessary national
recognition. Also W&L fields 13
varsity teams, more than some ath-
letic “powerhouses” which the SEC
or ACC can claim. These teams give
a significant percentage of the stu-
dent body the opportunity to partici-
pate in athletics at an intercollegi-
ate level. Granted that W&L has
scheduling problems. After all, who
wants to get beat by a team which
gives no athletic grants-in-aid? The
embarrassment is understandably
hard for opponents to accept. And
as for those who do believe the
competition is not as keen on an
unsubsidized team as on a fully fi-
nanced squad simply haven't
many of W&L’s games.

Perhaps | am biased toward the
second group but I believe it is for
legitimate reasons. I've met all of
WA&L’'s coaches and no group at
Washington and Lee has impressed
me more. The attitude of this staff
is one of excitement and success.
Their enthusiasm for their particular
sport and sports in general is highly
contagious

Coach Corrigan, who now heads
the Athletic Department, openly ad-
mits that Washington and Lee can
beat any Opponent on any schedule

Lee's athletic program is that of the
athletes involved. This summer the
“Washington and Lee Magazine”
printed an interesting report on that
very subject. One particular section
of that article will re-inforce what |
have said. That section was a series
of interviews with many of the cap-
tains of W&L athletic teams, In
most of the interviews the athletes
stressed that they were proud that
they could hit, catch, throw, shoot,
run or endure with any opponents
they faced. The praise from each of
these captains fell on the idea of an
athletic program designed for per-
sonal development and satisfaction
rather than winning records.
Opinions are frequently arrived at
abruptly without adequate considera-
tion of the facts. That is why I im-
plore anyone to study the facts here
at W&L before degrading its unsub-
sidized athletic program. The pur-
pose of athletics here is defined thus-
ly: “To benefit all students, not just
a chosen few. .. . Victory is desired
and fought for. But the final success

Third cross-country loss

Bridgewater swept the first three
places and trounced W&L, 18-42 in
a cross-country meet on their home
course. The defeat dropped W&L
below .500 with a 2-3 record.

Bill Wilkinson paced the Generals
with his best finish, thirty-two sec-
onds out of first with 20:03, good
for fourth place on the 3.75-mile
course, Sixth overall and second for

(Continued from Page 2)

Entirely too much emphasis is put
on this objective and as a result
when the freshmen get into their
houses they just lie down and quit.
Because of this a great deal of talent
and manpower is wasted. Students
waste enormous amounts of time in
pursuit of fitting into the fraternity
mold when they could be making
contributions elsewhere.

| feel that de-emphasis of the
importance of being a fraternity on
all fronts will aid W&L in becoming
a community of students in a learn-
ing environment, As it stands now
W&L is hardly more than a day
college visited for a few hours daily
by students who live in the local
area,

Phe cars for freshmen is a step in
the right direction and should be
made soon,

(Continued from Page 1)
Earlier this month, two W&L de-
baters—John Reynolds and Tim
Wright, both of Houston, Texas —
talked to approximately 6,000 high

school students in the Pittsburgh,
Pa. area.
Wright and Reynolds form a

highly-ranked team in W&L’s debate
program. The University was one
of five institutions of higher educa-
tion in the nation invited to send a
debate team to the Public Series
Debate program sponsored in Pitts-
burgh area high schools by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

In addition to introducing high
school students to intercollegiate de-
bating by debating the National De-
bate Topic, the Wright-Reynolds
team constituted the first contact
many of the students had ever had
with Washington and Lee.

“It seems to have gotten a very
good response,” Reynolds comment-
ed. “The students were interested in
our traditions at W&L, including
coat-and-tie dress,”

“The visit was done unofficially
for the admissions program,” Pro-
fessor William W. Chaffin, debate
coach, commented. “Many of the
students had never heard of Wash-
ington and Lee before.”

over the fraternities and that it
wishes fraternities to exercise a large
degree of  self-administration and
regulation, yet it has not ceded to
the IFC enough power to accom-
plish these ends, Since the 1969-70
year began the IFC has placed two
houses on social probation, In each
of these cases, the faculty-admini-
stration dominated SAC saw fit to
intervene and change the punish-
ment. Not even the IFC’s rush vio-
lation decisions are free from SAC
scrutiny.

Last week’s discussion of IFC
powers has not proved enough.
Though a clarification of those
powers was made, a change, in
either direction, is necessary. The
present IFC controversy is much
greater than parietals, they are only
the catalyst. The issue is the very
purpose of the IFC itself,

These and numerous other pro-

This year 38 W&L students are
participating in 33 Robert E. Lee re-

of faculty members. This marks the
10th year of the program. During
the past nine years and eight sum-
mers, 539 students have been en-
gaged in 430 projects, according to
Dr. William W. Pusey III, dean of
the College.

The projects are diverse. They
range from a psychological study of
the conceptual factors in human
short-term memory to work on pre-
serving historical records of Rock-
bridge County

One of the unique factors is that

graduate-school level, yet are being
undertaken by undergraduates who
work closely with their professors.

“A non-credit program of this size
is quite unique in college educa-
tion,” Dean Pusey said.

Originally made possible by a gift
in 1960 of over $250,000 by the
late Gustavus Benz Capito, an 1899
graduate of Washington and Lee, it
has been possible to maintain and in-
crease the scope of the research
program through the “generous do-
nations of the Charleston and other
foundations,” Dean Pusey noted.

Participating students receive
grants-in-aid ranging from less than
$100 to nearly $1,000 for several
students working together on a sin-
gle project. Students report on their
work during a series of small, in-
formal dinners held during the
school year for them and their pro-
fessors.

To Face Busy Weekend

morning will include appointments
with faculty, guided tours of the
campus, a coffee given by Mrs.
Huntley at the President's House,
and a meeting of regional agents for
the Parents Fund.

A Report to Parents program will
be held Saturday in Lee Chapel,
with Richard T. Scruggs, president
of the Parents Advisory Council,
presiding. Speakers will include
President Huntley; Swede Henberg,
student government president; and
Farris P, Hotchkiss, director of de-
velopment.

At noon Saturday a buffet lunch-
eon will be given in Evans Hall fol-
lowed by the football game against

Southwestern (Memphis, Tenn.) at
Wilson Field.

Another Saturday event will be a
concert given by the Washington
and Lee Glee Club and the John A.
Graham Brass Choir.

On Sunday, one of the nation’s
leading evangelists will speak at a
University non-denominational wor-
ship service, a new feature of the
annual Parents Weekend.

Dr. Myron §S. Augsburger, presi-
dent of Eastern Mennonite College
and Seminary at Harrisonburg, Va.,
will speak at the informal “coffee
house” service to be held in the ta-
vern of the University Center.

Dr. Augsburger was cited in the

Sept. 19 issue of Time Magazine as
one of the most influential leaders
among evangelicals in the movement
away from spiritual isolation and
toward involvement in social prob-
lems.

A native of Ohio, Dr. Augsburger
has conducted evangelistic crusades
in Various cities throughout the Unit-
ed States and has held ministries in
Europe, the Middle East, India and
Japan,

He holds his A.B. andTh.B. de-
grees from Eastern Mennonite, his
B.D. degree from Goshen College in
Goshen, Ind., and his Th.M. and
Th.D. degrees from Union Theolo-
gical Seminary in Richmond.

Deferred Rushing Considered
By Student Affairs Committee

The Student Affairs Committee
held a meeting Wednesday to inter-

tempt to discern the sentiment of
fraternity members in regard to rush,

Last year a proposal eliminating
pledging activity during first semes-
ter was voted down by the faculty.
A definite decision concerning de-
ferred rush for next year will be
made by the SAC for the December
faculty meting.

The 14 IFC members that were
present made it clear that they, for
the most part, were against defer-
ring rush entirely.

Swede Henberg, president of the
student body, pointed out that im-

provements could be made in the
present deferred rush system if a
new system was not possible. He
added that in the chaos of rush week
many people do not receive bids and
suggested that houses be required to
see people who sign up for “dinner
dates” on deferred rush.

Dr. G. W. Ray, associate pro-
fessor of English, said rush week
has the tendancies of “herd instinct”
and suggested that there be a “cool-
ing-off period.” He also asked about
problems in the present rush system.

added. He speculated that this matter

In Search of A Solution

The Executive Committee Monday night approached a
problem that becomes increasingly crucial to W&L each year.
Frankly stated, the University is not getting the recognition,
and hence the applications and the quality of students, that
its advantages would seem to attract for it.

The existence of W&L is predicated on the belief that a
small liberal arts college offers an alternative to the muli-
university type education, and that many students with the
highest credentials will prefer that alternative if only they
know about it. The potential has not always been realized,
of course, but the alternative is nonetheless alive here.

The failure has been to present it as such to those students
who might be interested in W&L, and whom the University
is certainly interested.

W&L traditionally has drawn on sources for students—
primarily the Southern Establishment—which are no longer
sending their sons exclusively to high status colleges close
to home. Thus the competition with large state universities,
as well as with private Northern schools, has become increas-
ingly more acute even for those students who might seriously
consider W&L anyway.

However, if W&L is to maintain itself as a respected in-
stitution of higher learning, it must also attract the children
of the middle and lower classes from all over the country.
This necessity is partly due to the drain from traditional
sources. More important is the educational need which is
served by including students from widely varying back-
grounds in a community which is conducive to the inter-
change of ideas.

It is precisely these students who, having no tradition
which directs their attention to W&L, might overlook it com-
pletely when they choose a college, even though its approach
might be best suited to them.

In some cases, of course, W&L can’t offer the funds
necessary to attract students whose parents are in the lower
income brackets. Frequently, however, money is available
from outside agencies, such as the Office of Economic Op-
portunity, and the presence of these students would entail
no financial burden at all for the University.

Both students and alumni, according to the dialogue in
the EC meeting, are concerned about the problem and are
willing to help. Further, the Admissions office has already
increased its recruiting efforts. This is merely the beginning
for all these groups, but it is necessary and should be strength-
ened.

We feel that the University has still another resource in
the attempt to broaden the base of knowledge about this
school, especially regarding the role it shares with so few
other colleges in American education. That resource is the
Office of Public Relations. It is true that present facilities and
staff size preclude its immediate utilization, but it is also the
case that well-done releases and publications, written in co-
operation with the Admissions Office and directed to coun-
selors as well as students, can provide a greater scope in re-
cruiting efforts and speak more efficiently to a larger audience
that personal contacts alone can. Of course, personal contacts
are also essential and should also be expanded, but an ex-
panded information program is its logical complement.

It has never been the duty of the Public Relations office
to do anything other than send news releases to Virginia
newspapers about University announcements, and occasional-
ly to hometown papers when a particular student has done
something noteworthy. This duty is a basic one, but the office,
with the proper adaptation of materials and expansion of
staff, can be utilized as a basic part of recruiting and gen-
eral public relations effort that is long overdue.

Letters to the Fditor...

Henberg Responds

lo the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

I write to clarify what I feel is an
egregious misrepresentation of last
Monday's Executive Committee
meeting. From the gist of the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi article of Oct. 28,
it seems one is to infer that defini-
tive plans have already been drawn
up concerning a major university
fund drive. This is not the case; it is
a simple misinterpretation of what
was said at the meeting last Monday.

As it now stands, a fund drive is
a good possibility, not an established
fact. My action in appointing
Messrs Tomkins, Ogilvie and Azuma
to examine the matter expresses a
belief that they might be instrumen-
tal in helping formulate plans for
such a drive. My intention was cer-
tainly not to ‘announce’ anything,
and I feel sure I was tentative
enough in my approach to the matter
that no one should have assumed I
was making a formal announcement,
Such an announcement would come
only after a definite plan had been
made, from the President of the
University. And I made it clear that

no such announcement was antici-
pated in the near future.

All of the above, however, is mere
prelude to my real cause for feeling
incensed. The first page headline in-
timating that I had announced a plan
for a building fund drive is absurd
enough. Obviously | must think of
‘plan’ in a different sense than who-
ever wrote the headline, for I cer-
tainly have no idea what plan I pro-
posed. To me at least, a plan must
have some substance, and there is
little substance to a suggestion that
a drive may take place sometime
during the next 18 months. Even
more ridiculous—and to my mind
irresponsible—was the headline on
the back page saying I had let ‘the
cat out of the bag.’

The implications of that headline
are obvious, Someone must have
thought I was revealing some secret
that had been insidiously kept from
the students for some time. No one
is trying to be furtive: a fund drive
is a good possibility and the EC rec-
ognizes that student involvement is
desirable. It is as simple as that. |
am all in favor of ingenious head-
lines, but I certainly hope the Tues-

Dylan Dead? Fearless Reporter
Relates Secret of Star’s Demise

By Bob Webb

Guest Columnist
Wild rumors have recently been
circulating throughout this fair

campus as to the probability of the
death of Bob Dylan, the God of folk
rock music. Taking upon myself the
task of resolving this controversy, |
have labored many tedious hours in
research and have come to the un-
contestible conclusion that Dylan is
in fact dead!

As the rumors rightiy point out,
his motorcycle accident several years
back proved fatal but news of his
death was suppressed due to the
skillful machinations of his pro-
moters. Through various under-
ground sources, | have found thai
the voice singing in Nashville Sky-
line (notice how different it is in
tone from previous albums) is actu-
ally that of his longlost brother,
Percy Zimmerman, who immigrated
from an Egyptian pottery factory in
1965.

Close examination of the album
cover reveals that Dylan is really
dead. Notice the growth of beard
and fingernails, both of which con-
tinue to grow after the body has
ceased its normal functions. Notice
his glazed eyes. Why is this man
smiling? Because he is propped up
on his guitar which is dangling from
the tree branches in the upper right
hand corner by an almost invisible
wire,

If this obviously conclusive evid-
ence isn't sufficient to convince the
most ifrational skeptic, then the
abundant symbolism incorporated

into the album should suffice. No
lice how Dylan has his right hand
poised over his head. It’s the ancient
Babylonian symbol for death. No-
tice his dingy, brown clothes. They
are the same ones worn by candi-
dates for cremation in Afganistan
around the 13th century. And notice
that his guitar has three white and
two yellow jewels, These five jewels
plus the one hat he is wearing equals
six——the number of pallbearers that
lowered his body into the grave.

But the clinching bit of evidence
comes when the album itself is
heard, But first it must be broken
into four equal parts, mixed, and
glued back together aagin. Then
when it is played at an angle of ex-
actly 36, backwards at 18 RPM,
and under a black light. Johnny
Cash is clearly singing, “I buried
Bob, Is he dead? Is he dead?” Ob-
viously he is.

Gaping Around...

Wilson Planning For
New Marching Band

By CHIP HARRIS

Wilson Memorial Statium may
once again resound to the music of
a Washington and Lee marching
band, if enough student interest is
expressed, At present a pep band is
in the process of forming around the
nucleus of the ROTC band, and
musically inclined students are ur-
gently needed to round out the or-
ganization.

In 1956, when Washington and
Lee football was still strong, and
in an attempt to overcome the psy-
chological effects of de-subsidation
a marching band combined with the
glee club to offer half-time enter-
tainment and a medley of Washing-
ton and Lee cheers.

The combinations continued to
sometime in the early 1960’s, when
a lack of interest brought its down-
fall. During its better years, how-

day edition does not, again, let its

own cleverness carry it away from

accurate representation of the facts.
Swede Henberg

On W&L Traditions
lo the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

| always thought that Washington
and Lee men had the courage to be
different.

The courage of self-enforcement
of an honor system, the courtesy of
saying “hello” on campus, the dignity
of dressing in a business-like manner
were all different from many schools
even when | attended Washington
and Lee University before World
War IL.

Those who did not like these in-
stitutions did not attend Washington
and Lee. Sometimes we were chided
by our peers for involving our-
selves in a system such as this.

Nevertheless, we did not bow to
the pressures of conformity evidenc-
ed by either protest or disinterest,

I sinceerly hope that Washington
and Lee men will have the courage
to continue to be different, will re-
establish the values that can be
found in these customs, and will be-
gin to try to sell their fellow students
on the value of these customs.

Class Officers As EC

lo the Friday Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

| would like to clarify the stand
of the freshman class officers in re-
gard to my proposal to the Executive
Committee last Monday night. What
I proposed was that class officers be
expected to attend EC meetings by
a pledge to office as its regular mem-
bers are. | do not in any way feel
that they should be given the right
to vote nor or at any other time in
the future. | feel this proposal would
attain three objectives.

First, it would result in better rep-
resentation because a greater diver-
sity of opinion would result from a
non-voting representing body,

Second, it would serve as a check
on present EC members.

Third, by getting all class officers
together with the EC, expansion of
powers and duties of the class of-
ficers could be intelligently discussed
und hopefully decided upon so the
offices would cease to be an absur-
dity. Jefl Burris

ever, the band and glee club cut at
least one record composed of then
campus favorites including ‘“Wash-
ington and Lee Swing”, “Fight,
Fight, Blue and White”, “Rah Rah,
Generals”, and “Friendships”.

To provide entertainment at half-
times, the athletic department began
hiring area high school bands, an
activity still carried on and one
which often costs the school as much
as several hundred dollars per team.
One rather apparent drawback to
this form of entertainment is that
often the imported bands fail to in-
clude W&L songs, notably “Wash-
ington and Lee Swing” in their re-
pertoire.

Upon Major William Jones’ ar-
rival to W&L two years ago he dis-
covered several copies of the band
and glee club’s record cut some-
time in the 1950's. As his duties in-
cluded the direction of the ROTC
band Major Jones was curious as to
why the school lacked as little as a
pep band,

Consequently the ROTC band be-
gan appearing at home football
games and some home basketball
games, notably the rather infamous
Roanoke College basketball game
last year. Conferring with the Ath-
letic department last year Major
Jones discovered additional inter-
est in a pep band, and this year, un-
der the direction of Gene Corrigan,
something concrete was done.

Funds have been made available
for the purchase of uniforms for
such an organization, and authori-
zation for a varsity letter to be is-
sued to members of the band has
been approved. In addition, athletic
passes have made available for
members, and the ROTC depart-
ment will allow the band to use
$3,000 worth of new musical instru-
ments recently requisitioned from
the army.

With little publicity the band has
already attracted some 20 students,
but more are needed before the Ath-
letic Dpartment will purchase uni-
forms and considrably more are
needed before the idea of a march-
ing band will be feasible.

Larry Sutton is directing the band
this year. Under his guidance, it is
holding regular practice sessions and
is attending home football games.

Since at least Major Jone’s ar-
rival, the school has regularly been
receiving invitations to participate
in the Marti Gras, the Apple Blos-
som Festival, and the Cherry Blos-
som Festival.

Jones is leaving for Vietnam in
December, and before he goes, he is
hoping to see the formation of a
strong University band, and hopes
that the possibility will grow dis-
tinct that at least one of those invita-
tions will be accepted,

When this column was conceived, there was one

them that look like field mice with powder puffs on).

also quietly, because if somebody heard me they might

for quick action.” So I figured it out that either the
leaves could be wired onto the trees, the little field
mice-in-drag could be trained to hold the leaves in
place. or the whole school could be shut down from
October to mid-January. This last would probably be
best. as very few janitors would be willing to climb
high enough to do any kind of wiring job at all, and the
mice don't loo trustworthy, They have a shifty
look about them, and would most likely drop all the

leaves simultaneously, thus burying the school for

RING-TUM PHI

Sewanee To Be Host

Ever the pessimist, Washington
and Lee football coach Buck Leslie
can’t understand how this week’s op-
ponent, Sewanee, is winless in six
games.

“From looking at the films, I don’t
see how they lost every game,” Les-
lie commented. “They look pretty
good to me. I do know they've play-
ed some good teams.”

From now on, those around Leslie
will take him seriously when he frets
before a game. The day before last
Saturday's tilt with Bridgewater, Les-
lie spent the whole day pacing, the
worry furrows in his wide forehead
very much in evidence.

Others in the W&L athletic camp
thought the coach’s concern was per-
haps unnecessary, but Saturday's

tough 10-6 escape at Bridgewater
proved Leslie was right.

“Sewanee is always up for us, no
matter what kind of record they
have,” Leslie noted. “In the films,
they throw the ball real well, much
better than last year (when the Gen-
erals upset the Tigers, 16-7),”

On top of that, the game is atop
Sewanee’s mountainous campus, and
the Tigers are always tough at home.
However, W&L—in a complete re-
versal of recent form—has achieved
all of its three victories this year on
the road. All three losses have been
at home.

Injuries will be a key factor. W&L
has lost several veteran starters and
must rely on freshmen at center and

Yow’s Goal Gives W&l Tie

The Washington and Lee soccer team continued its quest

for a VISA (Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer Association)

tournament bid by tying Eastern Mennonite on John Yow’s
last-second goal. The 1-1 tie kept W&L tied with Roanoke in
the loss column for the Western Division lead of the VISA.

The trademark of the W&L Soc-
cer Generals this year has been a
spirited, enthusiastic self-confidence,
As Coach Lyles has stressed many
times, “This team is young, but the
players believe in themselves and
their abilities. You won't find them
letting up in any of the games.”
These words were proven to be 100
per cent correct last Tuesday in
W&L’s game with Eastern Men-
nonite as the Generals scrapped un-
til the closing moments of the
game, the effort paying off in John
Yow’s game-tying goal with one sec-
ond remaining in the game,

Fullback Brian Price started what
would have to have been W&L’s
last offensive drive with twenty sec-
onds left in the game. Price brought
the ball to midfield where he passed
to inside left Don Belt. Belt then
drilled the ball toward the Eastern
Mennonite goal. Meade Kampf-
mueller, up for a head shot, collided

with the E-M goalie. The ball angled
off to Yow who quickly tied the
game.

Eastern Mennonite was the aggres-
sor for much of the game. The W&L
defense, playing their usual out-
standing game, prompted coach
Lyles to say, “This has to be the
best set of fullbacks in the state.”
W&L goalie Ken Newman had 27
saves,

The tie gave W&L an overall rec-
ord of 5-1-2, but the team stayed
tied with Roanoke in the important
loss column. Both W&L and Roa-
noke are vying for the Western Divi-
sion berth in the VISA tournament.
The Western division champion will
go against Virginia, the probable
E

certain that W&L would
avenge its earlier 2-1 loss to Vir-
ginia in that championship game.

The activities of the Young Re-
publicans in Virginia’s guberna-
torial campaign, which — included
bringing Republican gubernatorial
candidate Linwood Holton to speak
here last week, were brought to a
close Tuesday, according to YR
campaign manager Cal Seaton.

The YR’s activities also included
two canvasses of the Lexington com-
munity—the second concentrating on
the black portion of the community;
a mixer after Nixon’s speech, and a
party at the Phi Delta Theta fra-
ternity house.

In the mock election last Friday
sponsored by the Tuesday Ring-

by the local YR’s, was the over-
whelming victor, collecting 288 out
of 401 votes. Democratic candidate
William Battle got 99 votes or about
25 per cent of the total while Dr,

The performance will begin at 8
p.m. Tuesday at Lee Chapel.

At Washington and Lee, Savory
will play a program of contempor-
ary music and deliver a commentary.

He has chosen the following com-
positions as illustrations: Sonata, op
1, by Alban Berg; Three Studies
(from 12 Studies for Piano, op. 38)
by Peter Racine Fricker; Variations,
op. 27, by Anton Webern; Piano

enced Generals are question marks
for Saturday's game.

Among the battered and bruised
is halfback JoJo Martin, who car-
ried the ball 32 times aaginst Bridge-
water, compiling a total of 95 yards
in short bursts. Among the healthy
is Bruce Green, who caught the
touchdown pass—his fourth of the
season—and kicking specialist Jack
Baizley, whose instep provided the
actual margin of victory with the
extra point and a 32-yard field goal

Baizley now has been instrumental
in all three WAL wins, His two extra
points meant the difference in the
14-13 win over Towson, and he has
yel to miss in kicking eight points
after-touchdown this season,

A victory Saturday could start
WAL toward the runner-up spot in
the College Athletic Conference
championship race, Centre already
has the tithe wrapped up with a per
fect 4-0 mark, but WAL could finish
behind the Colonels with a 3-1 mark
by winning its remaining § three
games.

Pianist Savory tonight

NEW ADDITIONS TO
CONCERT LINE-UP

The Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series announced that it has con-
tracted two new attractions to re-
place the cancelled concert by the
Washington National Symphony,
which was to have opened the local
season last week. Series president
Col. F. H. Barksdale stated that the
Board of Managers was pleased with
the replacement of the long-time an-
chor event with two such outstand-
ing attractions.

Col. Barksdale reported that the
problem was resolved through a
search for artists with open dates
convenient to the fall calendar of
the community. The limited funds
available to the Series made the
search a difficult task, Barksdale
added that the Series Board had
hoped to replace the National Sym-
phony with another symphony or-
chestra, but approaches to five other
orchestras were unsuccessful.

The revised 1969-1970 Series will
offer four instead of the originally
scheduled three events. These include
the Roger Wagner Chorale, which
performed last night; the Paul Win-
ter Contemporary Concert on Feb.
16; the Cologne Chamber Orchestra
on March 2; and Marcia Baldwin,
mezzo-soprano of the Metropolitan
Opera Co., on April 21. Her recital
here will be the concluding event of
the Series.

The Chorale came to Lexington
as a part of its tour of the eastern
states. It appeared at VMI's Jackson
Memorial where its thirty voices
came into harmony. Wagner's varied
program included selections from all
the great periods of choral music.

As for tonight, the Concert Guild
will sponsor the second program of
its 1969-1970 series, John Savory, 4
renowned pianist, will preform in
Lee Chapel at eight. In addition to
a program of contemporary music,
Savory plans to deliver an informa-
tive commentary.

He has chosen several composi-
tions as illustrations. These include
Sonata, op. 1, by Alban Berg; Three
Studies by Peter Racine Fricker:
and Variations, op. 27, by Fredrick
Goosen. Along with these, Savory
will play a selection from “Three
Winter Potatoes”, by Cornelius Car-
dew.

Mr. Savory is a native of London
and at an early age became inter-
ested in the piano. He finished his
studies after three years under Pro
fessor Herbert Fryr, and soon took
up lecturing at Oxford University
4 few years later, Savory decided to
devote himself completely to the
piano, and moved to Vienna to study

Night-time service in
Co-op back in action

By Steve Ory

Last night's Executive Committee
meeting was highlighted by the an-
nouncement of the opening of the
Co-op for evening service. The store
opened last night and will be open
from 8:00 pm until 10:30 pm Sun-
day through Thursday. Student pat-
ronage is encouraged in order to
keep this service functionable.

The main business of the meeting
was devoted to a discussion of stu-
dent affairs as mentioned in the
various constitutions and charters of
campus organizations. Specific at-
tention was focused on the student
affairs rules present in faculty legis-
lating bodies. It was pointed out that
the faculty committees’ by-laws
have not been revised since 1958,
The current body of rules was de-
scribed as “chaotic and in need of
revision.” A committee consisting of
Dave Bethea, Glenn Azuma, Bill
Andrews, and Swede Henberg was
appointed to investigate: 1) the fac-
ulty rules that apply to students and
2) the student opinion concerning
these rules.

Freshman Bill Millkey reported
that the movies shown last weekend
were favorably received. Approxi-
mately 200 students attended and
plans are being made to show movies
every other weekend. Millkey com-
plained of the problem in finding a

projector and room for the shows
Plans were made to work out this
difficulty through Dean John’s office.
Rick Gray, Freshman Class Presi-
dent, reported that the only serious
objection of the faculty to freshmen
having cars was the parking prob-
lem. He proposed that the EC spon-
sor a resolution to allow freshmen
to keep motorcycles. His proposal
met strong objection from Commit-

teemen Dean Kumpuris, Phil
Thompson, Chuck Dobbins, and
Staman Ogilvie. Freshman repre

sentative Alan Prater brought the
proposal up for a vote and it was
defeated by a vote of two to eight.
John Markham, Freshman Law rep-
resentative, and Prater voted in
favor of the resolution.

Phil Thompson reported that he
was still investigating the law stu-
dents’ housing situation and he pre-
ferred to wait before taking any ac-
tion on this.

Interviews for freshmen positions
on the standing committees were
made after the EC meeting. Smitty
Smith and Tom Mays were appoint
ed to the University Center Com
mittee. George Wolfe and Jay Wil-
kins were appointed to the Curri-
culum Committee and Chris Gira-
gosian and Brad Hall were appointed
to the Cold Check Committee. The
Library Committee received the sin
gle addition of James Zeppieri.

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

 

Rush each semester

Tuesday, November 4, 1969

 

Mature gentlemen?

Conscientious students here and across the nation are cur-
rently laboring in a great desire to prove that the majority of
us are mature and responsible people capable of intelligent
thought and action. Nationwide, the reason for this effort is to
gain the respect of policy makers in general so that student
sentiments, which we ourselves see as legitimately founded,
will be heard with open minds. Limiting this purpose to the
academic society of Washington and Lee, student leaders—
most noticeably at this time, those in the Interfraternity Coun-
cil—are trying to convince the faculty that we are able to
govern ourselves, precluding the necessity of their dictating to
us “in loco parentis.””

Sad but true, both in our own microcosm and in the na-
tion as a whole, a few ill-considered actions by a careless arro-
gant minority guarantee that the responsible behavior of the
majority will be discounted.

Last Friday, several young colored residents of Lexington
were innocently trick-or-treating at one of our fraternity
houses. A few members of that house haughtily objected, yell-
ing obscene and embarrassing racial taunts from their front
porch. Fortunately, the children, displaying considerably
more intelligence than our fellow W&L gentlemen, quietly
left.

Shortly thereafter, someone from another fraternity
hurled a soft drink bottle through a window in that same
house. This ridiculous act apparently led the brothers in the
first house to believe that they had the license to punish any-
one who happened to drive or walk past their building. In
short order they began tossing ice balls indiscriminately at
passing automobiles and pedestrians. Later, their little game
developed to the point of throwing a soft drink bottle from
the third story balcony at two students walking in the street
below.

We feel that it is our duty: first, to condemn the irrespon-
sible and childish behavior of those few members of that fra-
ternity; second, to offer the defensive argument that such mis-
behavior on our part is very rare; third, to plead with the
faculty that such misdeeds on the part of a few students should
not be held accountable to the many; and finally, to apologize
to the people of Lexington on behalf of the responsible maj-
ority of Washington and Lee students.

Down with grass

Our campus, if divided into linear measures, does not ex-
tend over a comparatively large area. However, it is ques-
tionable that ample space is not available for development
into parking facilities. This excuse for delaying action on the
matter of permitting freshmen to own cars is surely devoid of
substance.

For example, the grass plot situated between the old dorm
and Doremus Gymnasium could be hard-surfaced without a
great degree of difficulty. Granted that plot in itself may not
be large enough, but it would be an excellent place to start.

We hope that such a relatively simple matter as parking
space does not long obscure the vision of the faculty to the
merits of the petition for freshmen cars. Freshmen, if they are
allowed to own and operate automobiles, would have an ade-
quate alternative to fraternity membership for the first time.
This is an alternative which the University by right should
have provided long ago to its students.

About our EC reporting

Mr. Henberg has publicly accused The Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi of “egregious misrepresentation” in its reporting of
last week's Executive Committee meeting.

Our story read: “Swede Henberg announced a University
building fund drive which is to begin within eighteen
months.”

The official minutes for that meeting, recorded by senior
committeeman Dave Bethea and signed by Student Body
Secretary Chuck Dobbins, read: “Henberg also announced
that within eighteen months the University will launch a
major fund drive, and that students were needed to work on
the ground floor.”

In his letter in the Friday Edition Mr. Henberg wrote: “I
write to clarify what I feel is an egregious misrepresentation of
last Monday's Executive Committee meeting . . . My inten-
tion was certainly not to ‘announce’ anything, and I feel sure
I was tentative enough in my approach to the matter that no
one should have assumed I was making a formal announce-
ment.”

We hope that in the future Mr. Henberg, as President of
the Student Body, will clarify his statements at the time that
he makes them, and not wait to do so until four days later in
the Friday paper. We also hope that he does not again attack
this newspaper for misinterpreting his intentions—for we re-
ported the statements we heard—when evidently he fails to
communicate those intentions to members of the very com-
mittee he leads!

If we, misled by Mr. Henberg’s lack of clarity, caused our
readers to believe that plans have been prepared for a build.
ing fund drive, we are sorry for propagating this misinforma-
tion.

We feel the present system of
rush should remain basically intact.
A deferred rush will bring more un-
desirable results that will outweigh
the gains by converting to a deferred
rush system.

The major problem lies in the
area of contact. Assuming a no con-
tact system, there will be a division
between the freshmen and upper-
classmen which is undesirable at a
small university such as W&L and
where fraternity men form a large
majority of the upperclass student
body. Enforcement of no contact
would be almost impossible.

Assuming a limited or no contact
situation which is the more feasible
of the two alternatives could easily
result in a rush that lasts 6 weeks or
one semester rather than one which
last but one week. Rush week is a
very intense period and the selection
of a freshman class is one of the
most crucial decisions in the continu-
ity. There is no efficient, equitable,
and inexpensive way that the fresh-
men may be divided up among fra-
ternities on the major party week-
ends. An effective system of smokers
in the fall or winter will become a
time-wasting effort for all involved.
Many freshmen will seek to impress
a fraternity and every fraternity’s ac-
tions will be rush conscious. What is
a freshman going to say when asked
by a fraternity to go down the road?
The freshman class is small enough
so that each fraternity does not face
an impersonal group, but a series of
individuals—each of whom will be
sought out and evaluated. It is our
belief that a deferred rush with com-
plete or limited contact will soon be-
come a semester long rush.

li will be a rare freshman, where
fraternity affiliation will be a major
determinant of future status on
campus, who will involve himself in
only academics during the week and
fraternities over the weekend. If all
freshmen were like this “rational”
freshman, the deferred rush system
would work, but like the “rational”
voter in politics, the “rational”
freshmen are far and few between.

There are advantages not only to
the fraternity system, but to the
University in the present system.
Rush is over when classes begin. The
freshman is oriented more quickly
into the University community with
contact with upperclass fraternity
members. This wide range of early
friendships will definitely help in as-
similating him. Some fraternities
have scholarship programs to aid
those that are in scholastic trouble.
Pre-school rush has this distinct ad-
vantage of moving the freshman
quickly into the entire scope of the
University.

The present system of rush is said
to be blind. How can the freshman
make the right choice in a week?
Most freshmen could probably easily
fit into any one of three or four fra-
ternities. A given fraternity will find
itself rushing primarily against the

Development:
important and

necessary role

By Reed Byrum

Although frequently unnoticed by
many students the Development Of-
fice maintains one of the most im-
portant functions in the University.

Since its inception during the Cole
administration, this department has
blossomed into one of the most
‘profitable’ endeavors of the school.
the Development Office is concern-
ed with raising of all funds for the
University, with the long-range idea
being to meet the rising financial
needs of the school. Prior to its
birth, funds were raised only to
finance specific needs, such as class-
rooms or dorms, bul, as costs rose,
the situation had to be revamped.

the product of this realignment
was the Development Office, and the
significant by-product has been in-
creased funds for the school. The
Alumni drives, the R. E. Lee As
sociaies, and the Parents Fund are
now all channeled through this of-
fice. The mechanics of such cam-
paigns are centered there, as is the
reception of all gifts to the Univer.
sity. All gifts received by the school
are catalogued and recorded here to
keep an accurate account of contri-
butions,

Mr. Farris Hotchkiss is directo:
of this office and is assisted by Wil-
liam Tyler; both are WAL alumni.
Their task is ever increasing in
wope, as both needs and expenses
rise, and represents one of the mos!
necessary functions of the Washing
ton and Lee administration

same four or five fraternities year
after year. Although the freshmen
may be dazed for the first two days,
the choice can be narrowed down
to a few fraternities by the end of
the week. Likewise each fraternity
is evaluating each freshman and it is
very certain that the freshman will
fit into the fraternity before he is
bid.

One of the widely suggested
changes designed to make the sys-
lem more equitable is formalization
of the present deferred rush. It
would require the fraternities to
rush those who desire fraternity af-
filiation, The present system leaves
the deferred rush option to the dis-
cretion of the fraternities.

We feel that when all the pros and
cons are fully evaluated, the basic
system of pre-school rush is the least
harmful to both the fraternities and
the University.

By David Higgins

Our present rushing system is
again under question from those who
claim that it sometimes forces fresh-
men to make a hasty and pressured
decision about fraternity member-
ship. All of the deferred rush plans
proposed so far, however, are either
too great a financial strain on the
houses or they provide little or no
social life for the freshmen compar-
able to that he now receives. In the
following proposed system of “dou-
ble rushing” I feel that the best solu-
tion to the problem can be found.

In a double rush system there
would be two six-day rush weeks,
one at the beginning of each twelve-
week semester of the 12-12-6. The
mechanics of each rush week would
exist as they do now, with altera-
tions made for classes during the sec-
ond twelve-week term and for the
likelihood that the weather would

What's wrong with rush?

By Professor Lewis La Rue

The most incredible thing about
the present rush system is the type
of argument that is used to defend
it. I realize that it does take ingenu-
ity to defend the status quo, but
even so, there is one thing that par-
ticularly astonishes me: the defenses
that are offered are compelling in-
dictments of the present system.

The argument against the status
quo is simple. One points to two ob-
vious facts: the fraternity men and
the freshmen make their choices on
the basis of information about each
other that is gained during several
meetings that occur within one week;
the type of information that each
gets about the other is merely infor-
mation about how the other per-
forms at a social function. In short,
there is not much information, and
what there is, is the wrong kind.

Having established these facts, one
then makes some assumptions about
what is required for rational action
and the rest of the argument falls
easily into place.

What defense is offered? Mr. Kel-
sey was kind enough to show me the
first draft of his above presentation:
he had a section on the problems
that would be caused by change and
then a section on defense of the
system,

In his defense of the present situa-
tion, he stated what he thought were
the advantages of the status quo.
The sentence that struck me was:
“Rush is over when classes begin.”
Is the implication that rush is some-
thing like registration for class or
placement testing? If so, then it is
logical to get it out of the way. But
surely, no one will contend that rush
is not important; at least it might be
said that it is strange for a defender
of the fraternity system to contend
that rush is not important.

Mr. Kelsey apparently does be-
lieve that it is important, because
he goes on to describe how the fra-
lernities are key in “assimilating”
the freshman. However, if the de-
cision is important, then it should
not be hastily made. In short, there
is an irony here that has been over-
looked: if rush is as important as it
seems to be, then it should not come
first; if it is not important, then
there is no real reason to have it.

Another way of defending the
statis quo against change is to argue
that change will bring too many dis-
agreeable problems. This argument
is also made by Mr. Kelsey; the in-
soluble problems of “contact rules”
is posed, and the specter of a semes-
ter-long rush is raised.

In order to believe that this argu-
ment is @ serious one it is necessary
to believe that a fraternity man will
be unable to speak to a non-frater-
nity freshman without the context
of rush being the governing structure
of that conversation, Are we to be-
lieve that students can not be human

beings with each other? There are
numerous organizations on _ this
campus that provide an opportunity
for political or community service,
for musical or theatrical expression,
for journalistic or literary training.
Could not the affiliation decisions be
based upon what one learns in such
a context?

In short, why take such a depress-
ing view of human nature? I refuse
to believe that students are unable
to meet and talk to each other with-
out the support of “contact rules.”

I hope that no one will take these
few paragraphs as an anti-fraternity
tract. Indeed, | have always believ-
ed that for young men to gather to-
gether and call themselves brothers
is potentially (although it may not
work out that way) a noble act. But
there can be no nobility to a board-
ing house which chooses its boarders
by an act of social irrationality,

in this connection, perhaps it is
Wise to raise the question of why the
fraternities are having such a prob-
lem of keeping the loyalty of the up-
perclassmen. Is it merely the parietal
rules, or does the selection process
itself bear some part of the blame?
Might it not be that the rush pro-
cedures are the major obstacle to
the creation of a solid sense of fra-
ternity?

A replyto...

Editor; Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

| would like to reply to the cour-
ageously unsigned letter in the Oc-
tober 31 issue of The Ring-tum Phi.
Until now, | have always thought
Washingion and Lee men had the
courage, and courtesy, to sing their
written opinions. Apparently this
does not apply to “alumni and fath-
ers,” especially if they hold the radi-
cal and dangerous position of de-
fending the status quo. I hope this
is not the kind of courage “Alumnus
and father” was speaking of.

Captain Courageous said he hoped
we have the courage to be different.
We do: we have the courage not
only to be different from other
schools, but from each other also.
Hopefully we did not come here to
jump into our “business-like” uni-
forms and march off to learn enough
data to succeed in Daddy's business,
but to get an education at a small,
unique, and supposedly individualis-
lic institution. Perhaps in the days of
pre-World War Il, people went to
schools to wear suits and say “hi!”
I did not; | came here for an (whis-
per i) education,

Southern establishment which the

prevent houses from setting up in the
Quad at that time. The freshmen
would be allowed to register for
either or both of the rush weeks.

There are several advantages to
this system. By allowing the fresh-
inen to go through either rush week,
we would be allowing him to decide
personally which type of rush would
be best for him and his own situa-
tion here on campus.

Some boys would like to immedi-
ately join a fraternity; for these, the
first semester week would be best.
Other boys would rather get the
feel of college life before deciding on
fraternity membership; here, the sec-
ond term rush would be best, Also,
if a boy goes to the end of the first
week and still cannot decide about
a fraternity, then he can wait until
the second semester, knowing that
there will be an organized system
through which he can again see the
houses.

Another advantage of this system
is the fact that the boy who has not
pledged at the beginning of the first
‘erm will not be deprived of a social
life. His friends who have pledged
will certainly make every effort to
have him up at their house in order
that he will consider joining with
them,

In this system the fraternities can
plan their years as they always have,
while the freshman who has not
pledged will not feel that he has lost
1s chance for fraternity member-
ship. If the majority of the fresh-
men pledge during the first week.
‘hen this would seem to indicate that
no revision of our present rush sys-
‘em is really needed. But with the
‘ouble rush system, we can have
both deferred and first semester rush;
the attitude of the freshman decid-
ing which to choose.

Consequently, by putting the
choice to the freshman in the form
of two rush weeks, I feel that we will
be settling our problem as it should
be settled. The decision would be the
freshman’s, and since jt is he about
whom we are concerned, then the
result should be fair, He, not the
school or the fraternities, will decide
which style of rush is most popular
and reasonable, Those who do not
agree with the majority of the fresh-
men about which rush week to sign
up for, can, of course chose the
other—or both. Therefore the ma-

jority will be served as well as the

Tuesday’s Players of the Week

 

Lat Purser
Lat Purser, a 5°99”, 170 pound
halfback from Charlotte, North

Carolina, becomes the first freshman
to earn player of the week honors
this year for W&L. Lat earned his
recognition in the Generals’ game
last Saturday aaginst Sewanee by
leading the W&L rushing game, run-
ning for over 100 yards in his first
full time performance this season.

 

Chuck Kuhn

Accounting for all three General
touchdowns against Sewanee, Chuck
Kuhn earns player of the week
honors along with Purser. Chuck, a
senior Delt from Louisville, passed
for two W&L touchdowns and ran
across for the other General score.
Chuck had an excellent all-around
effort in the losing cause against the
Tigers.

Sewanee stuns Generals

By Mike Berry

Coach Buck Leslie of the W&L
Generals can surely say, “I told
you so.” All of last week Coach
Leslie held the fear that the Gen-
erals would underestimate the power
of the Sewanee Tigers. In spite of
what everyone said, he was correct
in his fears. The underdog Tigers
upset the Generals 37-21.

The Tigers, running from a sin-
gle wing offense, used a second half
surge to jump ahead in what had
been, in the first half, an evenly
fought battle. Highlighting the play
for the Tigers in the second half
were Bubba Owens and Keith Ball.

Owens scored on runs of 76 yards,
13 yards, and a one-yard plunge.
Bell ran in a 58 yarder that all bu
put the game out of reach of the
Generals.

WA&L's first score came on a pass
from Chuck Kuhn to Frank Stearns
Kuhn accounted for the rest of the
General touchdowns as he threw an
eleven yarder to Green and ran in
himself from three years out in the
final quarter. Jack Baizley kicked
all three extra points making him
eleven for eleven on the season.

The touchdown pass to Green
marked Green's fifth touchdown re-
ception of the year. However, the
Generals were unable to overcome
penalties, a blocked kick, and an in
terception; all of which led to their
eventual defeat.

This weekend's game pits W&l
against Southwestern. Not knowing
what the experts say, | would rate
the Generals a slight favorite, since
its W&L Parents’ Weekend. South
western will, however, be out to
kick the Generals while they
down.

The game should be interesting
since the Generals must win the
next two to go .500 in the Confer-
ence. Pick W&L by seven.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Six wins picked
up by Big Blue

By John Robinson

Friday afternoon saw Washington
and Lee’s sixth soccer victory over
West Virginia Wesleyan. The score
was 2-1 as the Generals left the field
of combat across the hills in West
Virginia. Now only two games are
left on the schedule-V.P.1. and Ran-
dolph-Macon.

The initial score developed in the
second quarter when attacker Don
Belt took an assist from Bryan Her-
bert to kick the ball beyond the
goalie’s reach. After this goal neith-
er team could gain an upper hand
and the score remained 1-0 at half-
time.

No score was credited to either
squad in the third period. However,
the fourth quarter brought about
plenty of action, An unassisted goal
was credited to John Yow early in
the last period boosting W&L’s lead
to 2-0. West Virginia Wesleyan
roared back on a free kick that was
converted into one point from the
left side. The late goal encouraged a
comeback by the Generals’ oppon-
ents but a stalwart defense turned
back the threat and kept the W&L
single point advantage safe.

Praise from Coach Lyles was giv-
en to John Yow for his fine offen-
sive play along with sophomore
Dave Manson, Hard work and hus-
tle made Dave one of the season’s
most improved players especially in
the last game.

Harriers

By Tom Rowe

Amid the ashes of the College
Athletic Conference cross-country
meet in which W&L did not distin-
guish itself come three observations
worth belaboring: 1) that Washing-
ton University has an outstanding
group of runners, 2) that Bob Sher-
wood’s sore throat was not condu-
cive to optimum performance, and
3) that Bill Wilkinson has emerged
as W&L’s best for 1969, at least.

Background material goes like
this: The verdict of the five-team
meet on a four-mile course was
Washington 20, Centre 47, Wash-
ington and Lee and Southwestern
tied at 91, and Sewanee 100. The
meet was held Saturday, the first of
the month, at Southwestern. W&L
did not do badly in tying Southwes-
tern and beating Sewanee, but the
chase after Centre proved futile and
disappointing in light of a better per-
formance in a duel meet with the
Colonels in October, Wilkinson pac-
ed the Generals at 21:15, 7th over-
all of 35 runners. Carter Glass shot
into 2nd for W&L, his best finish
of the year and 19th overall. Sher-
wood was 20th, Dave Haydu 22nd.

First in every way was Washing-
ton University. Their man, Martin
Ruddock, was first at 20:42. Wash-
ington runners also took second,
third, and fourth. Ruddock was gone
after the first mile, impassable. The
adjective used most often by the
survivors of Washington's lightning
was “outclassed”. Washington domi-

Often the athletic department has
had transportation problems when
it came to scheduling opponents.
Also, it has been difficult for many
of the teams to identify some of our
opponents as “rivals.” The C.A.€
cams that the Generals face often
require transportation by airplane
that costs the students time and the
university money.

haps a virus. It is difficult to run
four miles with a sore throat. Co-
captain Haydu felt rocky from the
plane trip down and so was not up
to par either.

Sherwood’s slump is Wilkinson's
surge. Wilkinson is now established
as W&L’s number one runner, but
he insists that his role is pro tem.

and more experienced runner and
should be top next year. This is
good, according to Wilkinson. His
reasoning is that the number one
man leads the team, and the remain-
ing runners pace themselves behind
the front man, who in turn guides
them. Sherwood ran for four years
before coming to W&L, in contrast
to Wilkinson, a junior who had
never run at all before this year.
Therefore, Sherwood is more quali-
fied to pace the team with his know-
how. Wilkinson feels extra pressure
in his unaccustomed role and says
he'll be happier when Sherwood in-
evitably regains first place, and Wil-
kinson can follow behind him, a sort
of tandem that is the basis for a

Booters win

(Continued from Page 3)

After the game, West Virginia
Wesleyan was quickly rated as a
good soccer club particularly at the
inside positions, Actually they had
more chances to score than Wash-
ington and Lee and attempted sub-
stantially more shots.

At the present moment W&L must
work on a problem of ball control
to display the powerful brand of
play of which it is capable. Despite
that drawback the future looks very
bright for the Blue booters.

Good news has been received just
recently concerning the soccer team.
It has been learned that once again
Washington and Lee is being con-
sidered for a bid to the NCAA Col-
lege Division Atlantic Coast Re-
gionals on November 14-15. And of
course the chances are still bright
for a championship in the Western
Virginia Region. These last two
matches, needless to say, will make
all the difference.

By Reed Byrum

The Troub performance of Pin-
ter’s “The Homecoming” was prac-
tically faultless, an amazing fact
since half of the cast was participat-
ing in their first collegiate produc-
tion,

Dave Christovich’s characteriza-
tion of Max was excellent; by the
end of the play, he seemed to have
completely transformed himself into
the frusirated old man. Wes Pull-
man’s premiere came off surprising-
ly well, as he communicated the
image of the slick and rebuked mid-
dle son perfectly. At times, perhaps,
he attempted to be too cool, but this
was perhaps because of his theatri-
cal naivete,

Bob Carrere was great, when one
considers that too was his first Troub
production, He translated the being
of the frail Uncle Sam totally, both
physically and spiritually, Hugh
Hills previous experience in the
theatre showed true in his portrayal
of the super-straight husband. Mike
Leary also came over well in his
characterization of the pug boxer.

Karen Thorpe, new to W&L pro-
ductions, was a little too unemo
tional in her part; she also pondered
on things too long, when depth was
assuredly not to be a part of he:
personality, Her lying-on-her-back-
and-taking-it-without-a-smile attitude
was transmitted beautifully, but was
occasionally too extreme.

The physical aspects of the pro
duction failed to attain the high
standards of the acting. First of all,
the lighting was extremely poor,
hitting the actors just below the
shoulders; this cast a horrible glare
upon their faces. The lights caused
the make-up to show and made the

actors look like actors, instead of
people. This was best exemplified
by Christovich’s make-up, which, al-
though applied well, seemed too
heavy and loud under the lights,

The size limitations imposed by
the theater were sad, as the cast,
when all on the stage, seemed
cramped, More room would have
aided the production, as the props
and the actors could have been more
pleasingly situated,

rhe set design was exquisite and
beautifully done. The walls looked
especially impressive, and the furni
ture, even with the lack of space,
was Well placed.

The production in general was
great and makes one relish happily
thoughts of the next Troub play,

Tax Proposal Changed

By Walt Potter

According to Washington and Lee
University administration
the recently passed Senate version of
the Tax Reform Bill of 1969 will
sulisfy most of W&L’s objections to
the bill.

Washingion and Lee was among
the colleges, foundations and other
privately-supported institutions that

sources,

objected to the removal of many tax
deductions for charitable gifts by the
House of Representatives version of
the bill, passed August 2.

The bill still has several phases to
go through, including the compro
mise to be worked out in the joint-
Senate Committee. This compromise
will be crucial from the privately-
supported institutions’ viewpoint, as

the Committee will decide how much
of the House or the more liberal
Senate bill to use.

A major evidence of the WAL in-
volvement in the controversy over
the bill was President Huntley's
Selection to represent 26 inde-
pendent Virginia colleges in testify-
ing before the Senate Finance Com-
mittee on the bill September 18.

In testimony prepared for delivery
before the Senate Finance Commit-
tee, President Huntley called the re-
form bill a “meat-ax” approach and
termed it “the first significant step
backward with respect to the pro-
visions for charitable contributions
during the past 56 years of income
tax history.” The basic objection
seemed to be that “a real effect of
these changes (in tax law) and even
broader changes that will likely
follow would be to pull more power
away from the private sector and
place it in the public sector.”

Huntley did applaud the basic
aims of the Tax Act for closing tax
loopholes and even expressed his
group's willingness to accept com
promise On some aspects of deduc-
tions for charitable gifts, but he
firmly objects to such points as the
following

First, it would discourage charit
able gifts of appreciated property
and, in some instances, completely
eliminate tax incentives for making
gifts of appreciated property

Second, it would jeopardize
time-honored methods of charit
ible such as charitable re
life ugree

W&L Contingent To Go
To DC for Peace

An as yet undertermined number
of Washington and Lee students will
participate in an anti-war march in
Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, accord-
ing to Walter Sales, president of the
campus Young Democrats.

The march protesting President
Nixon’s Vietnam policy will come at
the end of three days of anti-war
demonstrations at the nation’s capi-
tal, beginning Thursday, Nov, 13.
The demonstrations are part of the
November moratorium against the
war in Vietnam.

fhe New Mobilization Committee
is the group planning the march,
which will go up Pennsylvania Ave-
nue from the Capitol to the White
House and be followed by a rally on
the Mall.

However, Justice Department of-
ficials want to severely limit the
number of persons marching up
Pennsylvania Avenue because of fear
of violence. Yesterday's Washing-
ton Post reported that negotiations
between the government and protest
leaders for a permit for the march
had stalled.

Both government leaders and pro-
test Organizers are expecting at least
200,000 participants in the Saturday
march.

They will be housed by students
in colleges in the Washington area,
including George Washington, Ho-
ward, American, and Catholic uni-
versities,

On the two preceding days local
campus protests similar to those of
the October moratorium are being
planned across the country.

Although no formal plans for
moratorium activities at Washington

and Lee have been made yet, Sales

has been instrumental in getting
WAL student involvement in the
Washington march.

Although transportation from

Lexington to Washington will not be
provided on a formal basis, Sales
said several students will be driving

March

to Washington in private cars. He
added that anyone interested in mak-
ing the trip should contact him.
Students who need a ride to Wash
ington or who can provide one have
also been urged to contact Bruce
Ritz, Jeff Gingold, Dick Capron,
Kurt Krumperman, and Sean Reilly

The Ring-tum Phi A Look at Our Public Relations

An Adverse Effect

President Nixon’s speech Monday night sparked di-
vergent responses from the populace, but from all indications
reaction was based less on what he said than on previously
held ideas about the war which his speech did nothing to
change.

Whatever one’s position, it seems fairly clear that the
President was on the one hand reassuring his “silent ma-
jority” that he is ignoring the war protests in pursuit of a
policy upon which he has already decided. He wanted them
to confirm this assumed support, not elicit a reconsideration
from it.

On the other hand, it seems likewise clear that he was in
part addressing the protesters themselves by way of claim-
ing for his course of action a self-evident justification which
he feels all Americans must endorse. It is these minds we
assume he would like to change.

We cannot speak with any authority on how well his
silent majority accepted the part directed to them (they
are increasingly hard to find). We are, however, convinced
that his remarks, both in content and in presentation, have
no chance of mitigating the force of the protest planned next
week, or of those to come.

The “effete impudent snobs” (an appellation we suppose
the Nixon Administration has adopted as a convenient label
for those neither silent nor a majority) had some reason,
because of eagerness with which the news media anticipated
the speech, to expect a significant pronouncement. They were
disappointed, we are certain, to hear only the basic argument
reiterated.

The self-righteous assumptions from which the argu-
ment proceeded may be ultimately more damaging for the
President’s position. For many whom the President would
most like to reach, talk of America’s “destiny” in this con-
text has connotation which precludes reconciliation.

We will not here discuss the propriety of the present
policy in Vietnam. We can, however, conclude that Mr.
Nixon, if he has not adopted Johnson’s war as his own, is
at least assuming his predecessor's position far across the
generation gap, and that is no way to bring us together.

Burris Proposal Has Merit

It is seldom that a newly-elected class officer, especially
a freshman, has the acumen to realize his office is an ab-
surdity, or the courage to say so. Jeff Burris evidently has
both.

His proposal to require class presidents and vice-presi-
dents to attend Executive committee meetings (without a
vote) may not be the solution, simply because to institu-
tionalize the responsibility of assimilating ideas and advising
is not to insure that it will be assumed. It did, however, merit
more consideration than the EC gave it.

The need to make the two class officers something more
than merely the head of a dance weekend is obvious, but
as yet there is no formal way to utilize the talent that many
of these people obviously possess.

We do, then, agree with Mr. Burris in principle and ask
that he continue his efforts to find a suitable use for the
resources no one else has cared to tap, and that the EC

aid him in this undertaking.

Correcting A Mistake

The letter from Mr. Holland and the article on the Public
Relations Office, both on this page, serve to correct some
false impressions conveyed by last Friday’s editorial.

It seems Mr. Holland has already employed the re-
sources at his disposal to assist the Admissions Office in its
recruiting, and we stand corrected for advocating this action
ex post facto as a departure from the normal duties of the
Public Relations staff.

In the final analysis, however, this effort Mr. Holland's
office has undertaken, in addition to the normal functions of
his office and with virtually no increase in staff or facilities,
serves only to underline our major point.

That is, the Public Relations Office can be a vital adjunct
to the increasingly strenuous recruiting effort the University
is putting forth, But it can fullfill this service to the fullest,
and with the variety of materials and approaches necessary,
only if the facilities and staff are increased to a degree com-
mensurate with the task it faces.

President Huntley early in his term said that the Uni-
versity’s present concern, unlike that of the Gaines admini-
stration, is not of making W&L as good as its reputation;
rather, it is to make its reputation “as good as we really are.”
It is time the University allocated the funds to implement
that goal,

By Monty Cottier

Far more than just a receptacle
for weekly calendar notices, the Of-
fice of Public Relations has, under
Mr. Bob Holland, shown itself to
be a potentially vital and irreplace-
able part of W&L’s academic and
community life.

In the areas of both external and

internal communications, as he men-
tions, Mr. Holland has instituted
two major innovations designed to
better present and serve Washing-
ton and Lee. With the Education
Report, the school not only provides
a means of early identification of the
school by the high school students
in terms of who we are and what we
are doing, but also through the pub-
lication of prime examples of student
literary and journalistic work the
school is providing the students with
a strong incentive to use these re-
ports to become acquainted with
W&L.
' The first issue of the Educational
Report concerns the problem of
student unrest, and centers around
the activities of a W&L alumnus,
Rep. William Brock of Tennessee
who led a tour through 50 of the
nation’s campuses as a fact-finding
project. Also, the issue carries a
poem written by a high school stu-
dent in New York, thus making
good the promise of the notices sent
out to various schools, teachers and
counselors throughout the east and
south that student writings would be
published in the report.

By not trying to shower the stu-
dents with self-congratulatory pro-
paganda, but rather presenting them
with what Mr. Holland terms “art-
icles of interest to prospective col-
lege students,” the Office of Public
Relations gets the school’s name be-
fore the college prospects often, and
also induces them to take note.

The University Newsletter, also
mentioned by Mr. Holland in his
letter, has now come out in four
issues during this semester, By serv-
ing as a direct outlet for the Infor-
mation Service bulletins and re-

leases, these news items are guaran-
teed publication without the neces-
sity of printing flyers or posting no-
tices in the newspaper as a matter
of course, and reserves these avenues
for the exceptionally newsworthy
items,

Since, too, the newsletter will be
somewhat more faculty-oriented, and
certainly more directed toward the
sort of information generally disse-
minated by the Office of Public Re-
lations, the newsletter will provide
an excellent springboard for various
discussions and plan development.
Mr. Holland suggested specifically
the possibility of elaboration by de-
partments of plans for the six-week
term, but made it clear that this was
only one example of the sort of use

to which this newsletter could be
put,

In addition to these two innova-
tions, the Office of Public Relations
continues, as it has in the past, to
send tapes, news releases, photo-
graphs, and so on to a variety of
newspapers, radio and television sta-
tions, and other media in the area
and throughout the country, from
special-interest historical journals to
national publications. These are used
to explain W&L’s basic objectives
and ideals in terms of what Mr. Hol-
land terms “the faculty expertise on
the various issues.”

Thus, the Office of Public Rela-
tions can be seen as an invaluable
part of the administrative structure
at Washington and Lee, functioning

not merely as a grist mill for endless
throwaway flyers and notices and
self-congratulatory handouts to high
school students, but instead as a re-
liable department dedicated to the
spread of genuine public relations,
or, to use Mr. Holland’s words
again, “Public relations means put-
ting our best foot forward, But it
also means answering and reporting
as candidly as possible questions
about the problems of the contem-
porary university.” He adds, “A
crying need exists for honest and
Open communication of the goals,
requirements, and accomplishments
of the higher education enterprise.”
With his new programs, this is cer-
tainly what the Public Relations Of-
fice is moving towards,

Letters to the Editor...

Public Relations

To the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:
| appreciate the thoughtful and
constructive editorial of Friday, Oc-
tober 31, regarding the need for an
expanded public relations effort by
Washington and Lee, particularly
with respect to students who might
be attracted here. The writer's in-
terest in the long-range welfare of
the University is to be commended,
and his ideas are soundly-based.

It should be noted, however, that
we have already begun to move in
the direction he suggests. The edi-
torial observation that the Office of
Public Relations has never had duties
beyond sending news releases to
Virginia newspapers and to home-
town papers of our students is in-
accurate. In the first place, our re-
leases go also to radio and television
stations, and in the case of major
stories, to the nation’s leading edu-
cation writers, to special-interest
educational, historical and journalis-
tic publications, to general-purpose
publications, and to media in and
out of Virginia, But more pertinent

Military Role at W&L
Re-examined by Olson

(Editor's Note: This is the first
of two articles examining the value
of ROTC on the W&L campus. In
our November 14 issue, the case for
ROTC at Washington and Lee will
be presented by Doug Hamilton.)

By David Olson

For eighteen years the Reserve Of-
ficer’s Training Corps of the United
States Army has had a very pleasant
existence on this campus. For next
year, with a new curriculum, the
University is reviewing its policy to-
wards ROTC. It does not appear
that this policy is not going to
change. I hope to examine some of
the issues in question.

The first question is that of aca-
demic credit. That is: should ROTC
courses receive academic credit? Of
course in the past the classroom sec-
tion of ROTC has received acade-
mic credit. A University official has
said that under the new curriculum
this policy will probably not change.
My only quarrel with this is that
juniors and seniors are able to take
only four academic courses and
ROTC and still have the required
number of hours per semester (14).
What this means is that some stu-
dents are substituting ROTC for an
academic course. I think that stu-
dents should be required to take a
full academic load and ROTC
should be over and above the re-
quired number of hours. It is unfair
to those students not taking ROTC
that those students who are can take
a reduced academic load, ROTC
should not be an exemption from
academic work.

Another bone of contention is the
status of ROTC faculty. The Uni-
versity is required to give the top
man in the ROTC department a full
professorship and the rest of the
members of the department get com-
mensurate positions, This is required
by the Federal government although
the University is allowed to review
each candidate, and the ROTC fac-
ulty is certainly not subjected to the
same academic rigors that are re-
quired of the civilian faculty mem-
bers. This is another point concern-
ing the question of academic credit,
for the faculty in ROTC has cer-
tainly not been through the same
training as the civilian faculty and
somewhere the academic quality of
the work in ROTC must suffer. An
other point is that not a single mem
ber of the ROTC faculty holds a

graduate degree. The most alarm-
ing point of this question though is
the fact that ROTC faculty mem-
bers are allowed to vote in faculty
meetings. Many of the votes in fac-
ulty meetings are quite close and an
ROTC vote could make a differ-
ence. What is in question is the
loyalty of these faculty members.
They have the shortest time on this
campus and their interest in Uni-
versity policy is questionable. They
are paid by the government, not the
University, and it seems inequitable
that they should vote as regular
members of the faculty.

The final, and, in my opinion,
most important issue is the moral
one, and this is vitally connected
with the war in Vietnam. It seems to
me that the purposes of ROTC are
antithetical to those of the Univer-
sity as an academic institution, The
military discipline is one of regimen-
tation, where there is a prescribed
way of handling any number of
situations, The University teaches
open-mindedness; it teaches the stu-
dent how to handle life as an in-
dividual. ROTC teaches the student
to be part of a giant military ma-
chine which in the light of the Viet-
nam war is concerned mainly with
killing. ROTC students are taught
how to kill with rifles and Ranger
students are taught how to kill with
their bare hands, They are taught
how to be cogs in a great murder
machine. In effect the University is
feeding a war machine, a machine
that conducts a war to which many
of today's students violently object.

I certainly feel that college men
should have the opportunity to get
officer training if they want it, My
objection is that I feel that the camp-
us is not the place to do it. A special
committee of ROTC that reported
to the Secretary of Defense offered
either off-campus centers or extend-
ed summer programs as viable alier-
natives to ROTC on campus. | saw
no real reason in the report why this
could not be done. There are far
loo many iniquities in the present
system for it to continue. The best
thing to do would be to make ROTC
totally devoid of any campus con-
nections, In this way the iniquities
of the system could be relieved and
the military could still have their
officer openings filled by the altern-
utives mentioned above, It is my
opinion that ROTC does not belong
on the campus and 1 feel that the
inconsistencies stated above are
more than enough reason for its re
moval, or at least a change in pre

sem university policy.

to the point the writer raises—the
need to reach the high schools—is a
new service the office has begun this
fall.

An Education and Information
Service to high schools has been in-
itiated by my office within the last
two months, The service, which takes
the form of a paper entitled “Wash-
ington and Lee University Educa-
tion Report,” is geared to the junior
or senior in high school, The first
issue dealt with some of the causes
of student unrest as seen by a group
of touring Congressmen led by Rep.
William E, Brock, a W&L alumnus.
Future issues will carry articles of
interest to prospective college stu-
dents on topics such as student fi-
nancial aid, how to prepare oneself
for college, college admissions pro-
grams, and facets of student life.
The service will also reprint ex-
amples of outstanding high school
journalism and creativity, as found
in school literary magazines and
newspapers, for distribution to par-
ticipating schools,

The first edition of “Education
Report” was mailed during October
to approximately 2,000 high schools,
along with a survey form to ascer-
tain interest of the high schools. The
return response has been enthusias-
tic beyond fondest expectation.
Many schools are indicating that
they will use this service of Wash-
ington and Lee in student publica-
tions or as guidance material. I fee!
public relations is most effective
when it includes a public service
aspect, rather than consisting just of
blatant propaganda. I hope, and ex-
pect, that interest will be stimulated
in Washington and Lee because it
offers a useful service, not because

it’ indulges in self-congratulatory
back-patting.
Basically, high schools from

Maryland and West Virginia south
to Florida and west to Texas were
included in the first mailing because
we were using the only well-develop-
ed list currently available—that of
the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association, which was run by WAL
for 40 years, I have included select-
ed other schools in New York, Cali-
fornia, Ohio and Illinois whose pub-
lications programs I am personally
acquainted with, but we could cer-
tainly use suggestions from our stu-
dents for additional schools outside
the “Establishment South” to in-
clude, Dean Farrar has given me
much help by furnishing the ad-
dresses of selected inner-city high
schools in which the Admissions Of.
fice is concentrating effort to recruit
disadvantaged students. The ma-
terials will reach guidance per-
sonnel, as well as students, in those
schools.

Parenthetically, 1 might mention
that the Office of Public Relations
also has the task of promoting inter-
nal communication, and toward that
end we have initiated a faculty news.
letter this fall, We also continue to

publish the weekly University Calen-
dar.

It is understandably difficult for
many in the W&L community to
understand how the national news
media could often omit such an im-
portant institution as Washington
and Lee from many of the educa-
tional roundups. It is much easier to
understand when you have been an
education writer for a daily news-
paper and have been the target of a
barrage of releases from hundreds of
colleges and other educational in-
stitutions across the country. When
a paper fails to mention us, it
doesn't mean we haven't been trying.

I recognize that the communica-
tions service we have started with
ve high schools is but a small step,
and | welcome suggestions for fur-
ther steps. The concern by the lead-
ership of both editions of the Ring-
tum Phi, and by other stuednts here,
for constructive changes at W&L
and in W&L’s relations with the
public is commendable.

Sincerely,
Robert G. Holland
Public Relations Director

A Reply to Newman
lo the Editor, the Friday

Ring-tum Phi,

I would like to reply to the un-
informed reply of Everett Newman
in the November fourth issue of
the Ring-tum Phi. I believe that Mr.
Newman should have first investi-
gated—a good scholastic idea—be-
fore using his trite cliches on the
“alumnus and father.” The “alumnus
and father” was my own father.
He requested to have his name with-
held as a means of “protection” for
myself—protection I did not ask
for, but that a considerate father
felt was a respectful gesture.

I do not necessarily agree with
all of my father's opinions, but |
do respect him for the life of total
involvement in civic affairs that he
has led. Of course Mr. Newman did
not care to investigate into the true
spirit of the letter, but only cared to
write cheap phrases about a man
he knows nothing about.

My father only asked students to
try to “sell their fellow students on
the value of these customs.” He did
not ask for a return to the “old”
system; all he asked was that stu-
dents attempt to rediscover the
value of these customs, Customs that
are often not thought over, but
rather discarded without thinking by
students who consider it the “in
thing to do,” deserve a more in-
tellectual approach.

My father did not just go to
school “to wear suits and say “hi!”
He came for an education also, An
education that may have taught him
one basic thing—before acting one
should thoroughly investigate the
situation,

single tally stood up throughout the
first half.

VPI tied the score in the third
quarter, but Carl Hyatt put the
Generals in front for good later
when his screen shot easily beat the
helpless VPI goalie. Hyatt now has
five goals, a remarkable achievement
for a halfback.

This was a must game for the
Generals, for they cannot afford an-
other loss in division play. Roanoke

tion in the Western Division of the

Team Out to Break
Wilson Field Jinx

“Personnel-wise, they are as sound as any of the bet-
ter teams we have played this year’, voiced Washington and
Lee’s Buck Leslie in describing Southwestern’s Tigers, this
Saturdays grid opponent. Indeed, the Memphis-based club
will return with most of the key personnel from last year’s
squad which drubbed the Generals, 38-7.

“They throw and run well, and
LeBlanc leads a tough defense”, add-

;d the Head General. Despite a 3-4
record that includes conference vic-
tories over Sewanee and Washing
ton University, and a loss to C.A.C.
leader Centre, the Tigers are solid
all the way around. Piloted by
Freshman Quarterback Bob Carter,
Southwestern displays a rollout pass-
ing game to go with the running of
Fullback Dave Allen, and Tailbacks
Jim Bryan and Gene Sides. The aer-
ial show features 6'7” Tight End
David Mullins. On defense, the
Tigers rely on a 5-3-3 monster with
periodic inside blitzes.

The Generals will be trying to
break the home field jinx which sud
denly appears to have struck them.
Washington and Lee has yet to win
a home game in three tries, losing
to Randolph-Macon, Centre, and
Tufts. All three of the victories have
come on enemy turf, as Towson
State, (14-3), Hampden-Sydney, (21
13), and Bridgewater, (10-6), have
all fallen on their own territories.
The Generals’ fourth loss, the 37

21 holocaust at Sewanee last week,
has been the only loss sustained on
the road thus far.

This will be the last home ap-
pearance of the year for the 1969
version of the Washington and Lee
football team. Ten seniors will be
taking part in their last pre-game
drills on Wilson Field this Saturday.
They are: Quarterbacks Chuck
Kuhn and Jack Baizley, Defensive
Back Johnny Nolan, Center and Tri-
Captain Thunder Thornton, Tackle
and Tri-Captain Tom McJunkin,
Ends Steve Mahaffey and John Tho-
mas, Linebackers Dean Kumpuris
(the third Tri-Captain) and Jay Meri-
wether, and Tackle George Hamlin

As an added attraction, this week-
end is Washington and Lee’s fif-
teenth annual Parents’ Weekend, an
incentive which will hopefully boost
the Generals “for more”. “We are
expecting a lot of emotion”,
Coach Leslie earlier in the week.

Injury-wise, the Generals are in
fair shape. Doug Gossmann, Junior

Senate Tax Bill
Meets Approval

pact of retroactive features of the
bill, especially provisions which
would alter the tax treatment of al
ready existing trusts and gift agree-
ments,

It is envisioned, according to a
New York Times article on the bill,
that after the bill is reported out of
committee to the Senate floor it will
be debated anywhere from several
days to several weeks. Then the joint
committee of the House and Senate
will work on the bill,( which ae
cording to this article will take
about two weeks, before the crucial
joint committee compromise between

Action Continues at Theatre;
“King Lear” Rehearsals Start

By Lawrence MeConnell

With the close of The Homecom-
ing last week at the Troubadour
Theater, it would seem that action
has died down at the small, red brick
garage. Not true. The cast for King
Lear has been chosen, the script has
been cut, and the set is almost ready.

Professor George Ray of the Eng-
lish department has been working
on cuts in the Shakespearian script
for two weeks. Upon Mr. Kahn's
request, he researched the actual
text as it appeared in the First Quar-
to and the First Folio. With addi-
tions and deletions in each version,
Ray tried to pick out the essential
textual crux of the play.

“The problem, frankly, is to cut
Lear down to size for modern audi
ences, The uncut play runs for about
4 hours, a little too long to hold
anyone’s interest, | think.” Ray also
mentioned that he didn't chop out
more than 17 lines in any one place,
assuring a carefully preserved script
for performance,

Ken Barnes is the set designer for
Lear. With the help of the set crew
he has been able to construct and
mount the major parts of the set al-
ready. He calls his design “a Sione-
henge effect.” Functionally, it will
“serve to isolate the action in one
section of the stage or another in
order to make scene changes easier.
The functional design is what they
call a ‘unit set’ and it’s really the
only way we can put Lear on in this
small theatre.”

King Lear will have two directors,
Lee Kahn as the head director and
a graduated senior, Kirk Wood
ward, as assistant director, Kahn in

freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly,
and backstroke.

Needless to say, the main strength
of the team will be in co-captains
Roger Martin and Scott McElroy
along with All American Bill Brum-
back and veterans John Lawlor,
David Kympton, and Bim Clark.
Freshman Alan Corwith, however,
is challenging Brumback’s position
as number one freestyler. Brumback
was only able to edge Corwith out
by .5 seconds in the 100 yard free-
style. Corwith and Brumback should
form a deadly combination in the
freestyle events.

Other promising freshmen include
fom Murray who may be the need-
ed backstroker the team needs and
Alan Sharp who has led the team in
reeent tests in the breaststroke
events. Both veterans Bim Clark
and Bert Meem have been perform-
ing exceptionally well. Clark has
done well in both the butterfly and
backstroke events and Meen is close
behind.

Returning veterans John Blalock,
Hal Catlin, Jeff Grossman, and Rick
Sands will give added depth to the

OAS to choose
advisers for its
annual meeting

By Mil Hatcher

Twenty-four delegation advisers
for the second annual Washington
and Lee Model Organization of
American States will be selected at
“ve weekly meeting in Room 208 of
the University Center on Tuesday,
November 18, at 7:30 p.m.

Thomas L. Osborne, a senior at
George Washington University, has
been tapped as president of the plen-
ary sessions. Osborne is a member
of the G.W.U, Commission on
Model Government and has served
as Secretary-General of the National
Model OAS.

In addition, applications for posi-
tions on the minimum of four dele-
gations exclusively manned by Wash-
ington and Lee students will be ac-
cepted at the Tuesday meeting. If
unable to attend in person, applica-
tions should be mailed to the Politi-
cal Science Club and International
Relations Association, Box 1229.

This year, W&L is host to the only

retariat is under the direction of the
Political Science Club and Inter-
national Relations Association, Of-
ficers include: John Motsinger, Sec-
retary-General; Ronny Abrams, Sec-
retary; Charlie Holt, Treasurer; Mil-
ford Hatcher, Information Director,
and O. N. Otto and John Hinshaw,

Seniors to

research

1969 flood in seminar

Eight W&L seniors are undertak-
ing a survey of Rockbridge County
residents who were affected by last
August's flood. The survey is part of
their study in a political science-
sociology course. Dr. William Buch-
anan, professor of political science,
explained that the students are un-
dertaking the survey as part of a
senior seminar on research methods.
“The purpose of the survey is to
study the reactions of people in un-
expected emergencies and their ad-
justment to the changes in living
conditions,” said Dr. Buchanan.

The eight students are Dave Field,
Tom Metcalf, Chris Habers, Bob
Skinner, Joe Raine, Charlie Holt,
Homer Gamble and George Ham-
lin. The students will seek the co-
operation of the residents in answer-
ing a questionnaire which attempts
to determine what happened to the
people before, during, and after the

Campus. The Seminar will discuss

flood. The survey should take about
two weeks to complete.

The students will attempt to in-
terview approximately one of every
three families located in the disaster
area. The students will seek the vic-
tims at their homes, or, in the cases
of persons whose homes were des-
troyed by flood, they will attempt to
locate the persons elsewhere.

The data collected by the octet
will be kept on file in the archives
of the political science department
of Washington and Lee and will be
available to anyone in future years
who is interested in the flood of
1969.

Cast for ‘Lear’

Tryouts for the production were
held on Wednesday and Thursday
evening of last week in the Trouba-

Agnew article claims, ‘Dick loves Ted’

By Lex McMillan

Ihe November 7 edition of Time published a very
imteresting article entitled, The Vice-Presidency “Dick
Loves Ted”, This column seemed to be one of the most
accurate and logical explanations and interpretations of
our Vice-President, Spiro Agnew. The head of the story
was not meant to be ironic though to many it would
seem not surprising. This administration's second man
has proved to be quite vocal as opposed to past holders
of his office

As a result of his highly inflamatery opinions, he
has drawn fire from many public fronts. There are many
who consider him a bumbling boob, Though | tend to
lean in favor of this attitude, the article in Thme showed
me that there could very definitely be a method to the
madness that Agnew seems to be carrying on. As the
article pointed out, “ those who have been most of-
fended are in the main liberals, who are down on the
Administration anyway.” This is probably a valid point
however, there must be some who voted for Nixon as
i did and still support him and yet have a low regard
for Agnew’s fiery condemnation of all supporters of the
Moratorium

Nixen perhaps has fooled people like myself into
believing that he is more liberal than he really is
Though Nixon was quoted as gently-chiding Agnew, in
the main he has supported and lauded his actions, This
dillusions me when | think that Nixon could have
only gentle reproof for 4 statement such as Agnew's

description of the Moratorium supporters, The Vice
President called them an “effete corps of impudent
snobs,” | supported the moratorium wholeheariedly

and | feel neither effete nor impudent nor snobish,

1 think that Agnew's attitudes and his statements
which reflect them portray a snobish and one sided
view of a question which requires open minded con-
sideration of the many facets of answers, I feel that
Agnew has succumbed to emotionalism in dealing with
this problem

His hints of a purge to rid the society of militant
ami-war leaders is frightening. He described them as
“parasites of passion,” “merchants of hate”, and “vul
tures”. He compared their weeding oui to that of the
discarding of rotien apples. This attitude seems very

alien to the principles upon which this country was
founded

One very imporiant function that Agnew could be
serving is that of drawing fire away from Nixon, and
his Was pointed out in the article. In this way Nixon
can get his jabs in and satisfy a conservative clement
while pretending to be milder than he is to please the
liberal element. This ix just a matter of political jugg
ling which is nothing new to the Nixon administration
in fact. the machinations of politicians trying to please
all the people existed even before this country had
political parties. As long as ambition is an element in

American culture this form of action will continue to

erin
However, it seems that too few people realize that
Anew is serving this Purpose I am just becoming

aware that Agnew is not really a faux pas of Nixon but
more than likely a calculated move to “keep the South
safe from George Wallace.” Somehow | just don't feel

EC requests students for
participation in recruiting

In an hour and a half session, the
Executive Committee passed two
resolutions, forwarded a letter of
opinion to the Ring-tum Phi (see
page two), and heard a report from
the Curriculum Committee.

Chip Schooley, chairman of that
committee, discussed the schedule
changes approved by the faculty, He
reported that he was unaware that
so little publicity would be accorded
to the changes and that student opin-
ion would be virtually ignored. Ogil-
vie reported that afternoon classes
would be essential in the new short
term but lamented that “student
Opinion was not sought and that no
attempt was made to enlighten the
student body in regard to this im-
portant change.”

Schooley further reported that the
Curriculum Committee had com-
pleted a study of the pass-fail sys-
tem and that they recommended one
pass-fail course be allowed per sem-
ester for sophomores also. It was
pointed out that such a system would
be particularly beneficial to overload
students, The independent exam
schedule and the adviser system were
discussed in depth and several re-
commendations were made by
Schooley.

The prime emphasis of the meet-
ing, according to Bethea, was the
passing of a resolution regarding un-
derprivileged applicants to W&lL.
The resolution was proposed by
Bethea and the vote in favor was un-
animous, The text reads:

WHEREAS the Executive Com-
mittee feels that Washington and
Lee University needs to assume
greater responsibility towards the
education of the qualified underpri-
vileged and

WHEREAS we recognize the dif-
ficulty Washington and Lee has had
in the past in attracting qualified
students from minority groups, and

WHEREAS the Executive Com-
mittee through the power granted it
by the Student Body hereby wishes
to undertake a sincere attempt to
remedy this unbalanced situation,

BE IT RESOLVED THAT the
Executive Committee appoint a com-
mittee with the following two-fold
purpose:

1) To thoroughly research the meth-
ods, approaches, and problems
encountered in the recruitment
of the underprivileged, with par-
ticular interest given to recruit-
ing that group which is conspicu-
ously lacking on our campus—
the Negro.

 

2) After extensive research a report
shall be made on December 15
to the Executive Committee con-
cerning these findings:

a) The discontinuance of the
committee if it be reported
that any recruitment plan is
inoperative.

b) The extension of more time
for further research.

¢) The implementation of a plan
for recruitment if such a plan
is recommended by the com-
mittee and approved by the
Executive Committee.

When and if such a plan be rec-
ommended and approved, the re-
searching committee may become a
sub-committee under the Executive
Committee. Upon the implementa-
tion of a plan, this sub-committee
will work in conjunction and under
the aegis of the Admissions Office.

The committee, headed by Bethea,
was appointed and consists of Azu-
ma, Dobbins, and Markham. Appli-
cations are now being sought from
members of the student body. They
must be turned in to the EC mail-
box in the Student Center by 6
p.m. Sunday.

Kumpuris made a resolution to
voice the EC’s dissatisfaction with
the faculty's handling of next year’s
schedule. He dropped his proposal in
favor of a letter to the Ring-tum Phi,

which is printed on page two.
Thompson reported the findings of
the law student’s housing committee.
Mosby Perrow, representing the Law
School proposed: “That all Univer-
sity housing units in Hillside Terrace
and Davidson Park be made avail
able to student couples before be-
ing opened to faculty couples.” Also,
“That all faculty families now re-
siding in Davidson Park and Hill-
side Terrace be relocated outside of
these units by 30 June, 1970.”

The motion passed unanimously.
The procedure will now be to relay
the resolution to Dean Steinheimer
and President Huntley for their re-
ferral to the faculty. Thompson pro-
posed that an amendment be added
to recognize the individual needs of
students living in the two parks,
The amendment also passed unani-
mously.

Tompkins reported that $400 had
been allocated to the Law Review.
He also proposed that an Executive
Committeeman be appointed to head
a committee to investigate co-educa-
tion, Kevin Baker was chosen as he
reported that he had been discussing
co-education with Dr. Hodges.

Henberg announced that the sub-
committee concerning faculty re-
gulations and their codification has
met and a report will be made prior
to Christmas vacation.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, November 11, 1969

At least an audience

The drafting of the framework of the new class schedule
was evidently handled by the faculty without any formal con-
sultation with the student body. Moreover, the adoption of
this new plan at the November faculty meeting came as a
complete surprise to the student body. Prior to the conclusive
vote eight days ago, no official notification had emanated
from Washington Hall, or any Hall, that the faculty was even
considering action on a new class schedule. Whether this was
a sin of commission or omission on the part of the faculty,
we do not know. In either case, we are most disturbed by this
exclusion of student participation.

That a new scheduling system will be necessary under the
12-12-6 is obvious. That the faculty devised and decreed this
new schedule without enlisting the coopeartion of the student

body is discouraging.

The Executive Committee and The Ring-tum Phi, for ex-
ample, devoted a great deal of attention during the past two
years both to studying the issues of short-term and Saturday
classes and to mustering student involvement and expression.
In this final action, these institutions of the student body were
ignored. Nor was the Student Curriculum Committee provid-
ed ample time to discuss the schedule.

The gravity of this situation rests not so much in the
dictates of the statute—for the student body, if consulted,
would probably have concurred, though we can never be sure
~~as in the fact that the sentiment of the students was not in-
vestigated. Yet, this is an issue which clearly and directly af-
fects the daily lives of every one of our 1460 students just as
much as it affects the daily lives of every one of our faculty
members. Furthermore, the matter was relatively uncompli-
cated; that is, it failed to consist of any earth-shaking signi-
fiance, thereby discrediting any excuse for student exclusion

on that premise.

We are therefore puzzled as well as dismayed by this re-
cent insult of the student body on the part of the faculty. We
hope no precedent has been initiated.

Letters to the Editor,
faculty and students

To the students

To the students:

Last night the Executive Com-
mittee initiated action that could
prove to be a crucial test of the
Student Body's willingness to con-
cern itself with the question of its
own make-up. A committee, co-
chaired by Dave Bethea and John
Markham. was set up to study the
feasibiilty of employing student ener-
gies in the recruitment of underpri-
vileged students. Such action was
taken in the interest of a more di-
versified Student Body, both on rac-
ial and economic grounds.

This week, then, the Executive
Committee will be accepting appli-
cations from all persons interested
in working on this project. Success
of this plan will depend upon stu-
dent response, as the resolution stip-
ulates that a report must be given
the Executive Commitiee by Decem-
ber 15 as to the feasibility of em-
ploying student actiivty in this area.

The Executive Committee has
taken a big step toward initiating
this action: its continued momentum
is a direct exponent of the willing-
ness of individual students to de-
voted their time to the project. I
have gathered that there is a lot of
dissatisfatc:on among students as to
the current character of the Wash-
ingion and Lee Student Body, but
so far there has been no concerted
effort among students to remedy the
situation. Hopefully this proposal
will be greeted with enthusiasm, and
I urge all students to give it careful
consideration.

Applications for those interested
should be submitted in the E.C.
mailbox in the University Center by
Sunday, Nov. 16, Interviews will be
held the following day. Monday.
Nov, 17

Again, 1 hope there is a decidedly
favorable response among students
to the Executive Committee's initia-
tive on this crucial issue.

Open Letter to the Faculty

Last Monday at the Faculty’s
monthly meeting the class schedule
for the 12-12-64 curriculum change
was passed. The brief and inadequ-
ite explanation which appeared in
the Tuesday Edition on November
i was the first and only unveiling of
information concerning this major
change in adaptation of the schedul-
ing of classes to the 12-12-6 plan

In the course of the Executive
Committee meeting on that same
Monday, knowledge obtained totally
by chance pertaining to this matter

was conveyed to the members of the
committee. As a result, Staman Ogil-
vie Was appointed to investigate the
possibility of student participation
in the creation of the scheduling
plan. That Tuesday it was learned
that the EC's deliberations were for
naught, as the plan had already been
adopted on the preceding afternoon
by the faculty.

The adoption of this plan was the
result of an extensive questionnaire
aimed at obtaining faculty prefer-
ences, Neither student participation
nor student contribution was solicit-
ed by the faculty committee in
charge of the investigation.

In light of the rapport which
grew last year between faculty and
students, witnessed in the contri-
butions made by students in formu-
lating the final format of the 12-12-6
schedule, and in other vital areas of
change, it is both disturbing and
perplexing that no student opinion
was sought in any form whatsoever.
We must assume that the faculty did
not consider this major decision
needing of student consideration. It
is regrettable that the faculty appar-
ently has decided to spurn the chan-
nels of student sentiment which were
so evident last year.

Our reasons for composing this
letter are that we hope that in fu-
ture matters of change of such im-
port the ideas and feelings of the
student body will again be given
some consideration.

The Executive Commitiee

Money leads to fraternity losses

By Roy Carlton
News Editor

Back in the latter part of Septem-
ber Mike Hughes, Lexington corres-
pondent for the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, decided to turn his atten-
tion to a previously undiscussed as-
pect of Washington and Lee frater-
nity life: upperclass deactivation.
From his viewpoint, he saw upper-
class deactivation as a great and
growing threat to the economic sta-
bility of fraternities.

The one thing Hughes failed to
do, however, was to conduct some
kind of study of the actual num-
bers involved in deactivation. Hence,
there was no way of telling exactly
how significant the matter had be-
come.

With a high degree of caution,
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi has ad-
dressed itself to the problem in the
past week, and has compiled the
rather surprising set of statistics
shown below. For various reasons,
approximately the same percentages
of the sophomore and junior classes
belong to fraternities while there is
a marked decrease in the senior
class,

What this seems to indicate is that
a large number of people tend to
drop out of fraternities in their jun-
ior year. Because statistics were not
available to us for last year’s grad-
uating class it would be impossible
for us to show statistically taht this
trend continues through the senior
year. But it would not be reaching
too far to assume that that is the
case.

By the same logic we can deduce
that a much larger percentage stay

Losses threaten fraternity solvency

Fraternities have been firmly en-
trenched at Washington and Lee for
over one hundred years now. They
have dominated the school’s social
life as long as it has had one, and
campus politics have been frater-
nity oriented for decades. In short,
fraternities are just as much a tradi-
tion at WAL as the coat and tie.

The last several years have been
a time of transition for WAL, how-
ever, and there have been changes
fraternities have not been able to
avoid. Traditions have all come un-
der scrutiny to see if there is a value
to them other than their being tradi-
tions. In the process the speaking
tradition seems to have gone by the
wayside, Freshman walk on the grass
at will, Preshman nametags have
all but disappeared, and coat and tie
dress seems to have adopted a looser
interpretation.

As the figures above seem to indi-
caie, upperclassmen are now analyz-
ing fraternities with the same close
attention they devote to WAL’s other
traditions. Most of them find their
fraternity membership to be worth-
while, but a significant number
either don't consider it worth its ex-
pense or don't consider it worth any-
thing.

This decimation of fraternity up-
perclasses by deactivation is com-
plemented by the increased tendency
for students to either transfer or fail
by their senior year. The result is
often the decimation of a fraternity's
senior class. As the table above
shows, there are several houses
which al present retain only a frac-
tion of their original senior class
There are also a few with a deci-
mated junior class for much the
same reasons.

These losses constituie a tremend-
ous loss of revenue to the individual
houses. So much so that yearly now

in their fraternities through their
freshman and sophomore years. This
is quite plausible considering the ad-
vantages and facilities which frater-
nities offer to those classes. Fresh-
men rarely depledge because of the
social necessity of belonging to a
fraternity. Sophomores are in the
worst position to deactivate, because,
by and large, they live in the fra-
ternity houses.

Then is it proper to assume that
the most important motivation for
fraternity existence is the advantages
it offers to underclassmen? Is the
concept of brotherhood and other
principles upon which fraternities
are based so weak that upperclass-
men abandon fraternities once they
are socially self-sufficient? Probably
not. There are still a majority of
seniors in fraternities, and roughly
three quarters of the fraternity men
in the senior class are still active.
Yet, what about the quarter that
have either depledged or deacti-
vated.

After interviewing a considerable
number of deactivates from several
houses, one common reason seems
to stand out most often. Fraternities
are too expensive. By the junior and
senior years almost all fraternity
men live in apartments, usually with
kitchens. With these added expenses
(no one can deny living in a frater-
nity house is cheaper than renting
an apartment), fraternity bills be-
come a heavy load.

By the upperclass years the pri-
mary advantage a fraternity offers
is that of being a place at which to
eat cheaply. Yet even this loses its
attraction to upperclassmen. As one

 

No. of No, still No. of
Pidgs here  actvs

 

there are cries that this house or an-
other house either cannot pay its
bills er won't be able to raise enough
money to pay future ones.

On top of this it has been the goal
of the faculty to institute some kind
of deferred rush sysiem. The idea
is that this will give entering stu-
dents a better chance to evaluate the
wisdom of joining a fraternity so
that each one will be able to decide
for himself, rather than being forced
to join a house. Undoubiedly this
would be the case, but, all vaiue
judgments aside, it would be crippl-
ing to fraternities in that they would
be deprived of badly needed fresh-
man funds for a semesier, In cases
such as in the last two years when
one of more houses have gone inio
rush with less than twenly actives ot
close to it, deferred rush would be a
death blow,

The result of these pressures upon
fraternities has been to attach add-
ed importance upon a good rush,
and more and more, a large one.
It can Be seen from the table that it
is the houses with the greatest losses
that try to pledge the largest classes.
Sometimes, of course, the small
number of actives is readily appar-
ent to freshmen who then begin to
have second doubis.

A large rush, however, can nol
make up for the factors that eventu
ally lead to deactivation. These must
be corrected from within and it is
questionable that fraternities have
tried to do this or have even been

 

deactivate said: “By the time I'd
add my social dues to my board, I'd
be paying over a hundred dollars a
month to eat at the house. I guess I
spend about forty-five dollars a
month for food now. That includes
two meals a day, like I'd get at the
house, plus some snacks,”

Analyzing the statement of this
student, it would seem as if he feels
he’s getting nothing for his social
dues. This is a frequent cause for
disgruntlement. By the time a frater-
nity man has an apartment, he has
established contacts at the girls’
schools, It is also probable that
either he or his roommate has a car.
Thus with a place to party, contacts,
and a car at his disposal, there is
little material advantage to an up-
perclassman’s fraternity member-
ship.

While economics seems to be the
most frequent reason for deactiva-
tion, there are several other promin-
ent ones. These center around gen-
eral disillusionment with the frater-
nity system as a whole, Because
there is such an emphasis at W&L
upon pledging a house during the
freshman year, many students join
fraternities when they wouldn't con-
sider it at another school. For some
of these people, the fraternity proves
to be a much better organization
than they had thought. But for
others, dissatisfaction with fraterni-
ties quickly sets in.

This disillusionment takes several
forms. Some deactivates cite a lack
of brotherhood in fraternities behind
a great facade of close friendship.
They note that fraternities are quite
often divided against themselves.

able. Disillusionment with the fra-
ternity system as a whole is a very
hard thing for fraternities to counter.
Then too, how can a fraternity ease
financial burdens upon its members
when it is in difficult financial straits
itself? The answer is that it cannot
and shouldn't try. The answer lies
elsewhere.

The problem is twofold, Frater-
nities afte losing members from
withdrawals and deactivations, Be-
cause most of these withdrawals are
transfers to easier schools or because
of failure, the solution lies in in-
creased fraternity attention to aca-
demics. The greater part of deactiva-
tion can be prevented by generating
a greater spirit of brotherhood in the
fraternity so as to make non-mem-
bership dissatisfying.

Academics is not entirely neglect-
ed by houses upon this campus.
Most houses have a cold quiz file of
some kind. Big Brother programs
which are campus-wide do show
some concern for studies. Bul there
is little constructive action promot-
ing scholarship inside the fraterni-
ties. Many houses await the publi-
cation of fraternity academic stand-
ings almost laughingly. It would
seem almost as if fraternities worry
about their members’ grades only tor
the first semester of their freshman
year

Whether the reason for deactivat-
ing is financial or otherwise, an in-
creased spirit of brotherhood would

These factions war against them-
selves and sometimes go so far as to
try to drive the other factions out of
the house. In some cases in the past
this has led to mass deactivations.

Ex-fraternity men also mention a
lack of companionship with under-
classmen as a reason for deactivat-
ing. They don't find themselves as
friendly with underclassmen as they
do with their former pledge brothers
and the brothers who were in the
house when they came, Thus, when
the older brothers have graduated or
deactivated and their classmates be-
gin deactivating, upperclassmen find
little to tie them to their fraternities.
Sometimes this leads to a chain re-
action of deactivations in which a
whole class will quit.

Perhaps one of the saddest of all
remarks came from one such sen-
ior, a student of fairly prominent
stature at W&L: “I guess I stayed in
so long because I felt like I had
some kind of obligation to the fra-
ternity, as if I'd be running out on
it. But I'm really glad 1 quit. I'm
kicking myself that I didn’t do it
sooner”,

It’s true that these views are mi-
nority views, They are those of only
a quarter of the senior class that has
chosen to go independent. Yet that
quarter represents a great deal of
income to fraternities, With the new
Student Center and the fact that
scholarship students will soon be al-
lowed cars and possibly freshmen,
too, this number can only get bigger.
It will be imperative in the years
ahead for fraternities to take a firm-
er hold on their seniors. To do
otherwise would be courting disaster.

cut down that number. In the case of
those members who find a fraternity
is not worth the money it costs,
brotherhood would lend a non-ma-
terial aspect to fraternities which is
sorely lacking. But how to instill
brotherhood in those cases where
little or none exists is an apt ques-
hon,

As any fraternity president will
admit, the sophomore year when an
entire class is living in the frater-
nities together is the year of strong-
est brotherhood. Once members
move into apartments they once
again become fragmented. The solu-
tion then must be to keep them liv-
ing in the houses, This of course,
means drastically reducing the size
of fraternities in that the houses are
too small to accomodate their total
present membership. A reduction in
size however, would also be more
conducive to promoting brother-
hood. It might at this time be point-
ed out that fraternity revenues would
be cut by a size reduction, This
could be offset by eliminating the
dining function of fraternities and
turning it over to the University,
The advantages of such a move are
twofold, First, because feeding mem-
bers is essentially a debt operation of
fraternities, eliminating meals would
both allow a smaller size and in-
crease fraternities’ solvency, Sec-
ondly, the serving of meals by the
University would increase inter-fra-
lernity contact, thus allowing a clos-
er union of the student body,

This is but one possible solution
to the problems of the fraternities,
there are probably many others.
But fraternities cannot waste time
by ignoring the problem. The finan-
cial difficulties of a few houses may
someday be the problems of ail
WAL houses. It is now time for fra-
ternities to take some constructive
action lo prevent membership losses

Southwestern stunned

By Mike Berry

The weather wasn’t great last
weekend and the sun only came out
during the National Anthem, but
that five minutes of sunshine was
all the Generals needed as they lick-
ed the Southwestern Lynx 24-19.

Coach Leslie took advantage of
what weather conditions there were
and kept the gusty November wind
at the Generals’ back during the first
and third quarters. This proved to
be a definite asset all afternoon, It
was a passing game and all the Gen-
eral scores came with the wind at
their back. The first score came
about midway through the first quar-
ter when soccer-style placekicker
Jack Baizley blasted a forty-one yard
field goal through the uprights.

Minutes later defensive halfback
Dave Brooks picked off a Southwes-
tern sideline pass and sauntered into
the end zone untouched. The Lynx
had the wind at their backs for the
second quarter and also took ad-
vantage of it. They managed to score
on a long-bomb and went in at half-
time trailing 10-6,

The Generals came out in the
third quarter and began to march
with the wind advantage. Chuck
Kuhn connected with flanker Bruce
Green who made a one-handed grab
and outran the defenders to the end
zone. Later in the same quarter,
Green pulled in his second scoring
grab to end the Generals’ scoring.

In the final quarter, things began

to slow up for the Generals. The
momentum, except at times, went to
the Lynx of Southwestern. They had
managed to score again in the third
quarter, but as in the first score they
had missed the extra point. They
drove in for the third score midway
through the fourth quarter. The last
time they took possession of the ball
was a “do or die” effort. They al-
most did, but a stubborn General de-
fense managed to keep Southwestern
out of their end zone. The game
ended up with the Generals running
out the clock and the referees break-
ing up a free-for-all.

The game was a passing affair as
Southwestern rolled up 265 yards
and W&L amassed 150 _ yards
through the airways. Chuck Kuhn
was fourteen for twenty-eight for
150 yards and found himself leading
the CAC in the total offense race.

Very bright basketball outlook in
1969 attributed to additional depth

December will commence the key
season in recent years for the bas-
ketball team. The best team since de-
subsidizing will take on the most
strenous campaign since that time.

The opponents this winter include
Navy once again along with a few
new faces. Milligan, Mars Hill and
Rollins each offer new competition
to the Generals. Over the Christmas
break the Washington and Lee Tour-
nament will see the Generals battle
three rivals in an attempt to main-
tain possession of the first place
trophy. Scheduled to play in the
tournament are Centre, Wofford and
Dickinson. A_ great majority of
WA&L’s opponents this year will be
contending with major university
foes, therefore the schedule must be
classified as very tough.

Nevertheless Washington and Lee
has a team extremely capable of
handling the situation. In the previ-
ous season W&L won the small col-
lege championship for Virginia, post-
ing 19 wins, came in second in the
C.A.C. and stunned Navy their first
major college competition in a de-
cade. Mel Cartwright and Mike
Neer each made all-conference and
all-state. The starting five are back
as well as promising freshmen and
an exciting sophomore transfer, Ellie
Gutshall, from East Carolina, Bill
Rhyne is playing again this semester
and along with him are some talent-
ed sophomores highlighted by Mike
Daniel. For once in quite a while
WAL can boast of 10 strong ball
players which means plenty of depth.

To get ready for the campaign
Coach Canfield has prescribed the
hardest workouts during his career
here. Yet, the results have been
gratifying as each boy has worked
just that much harder each practice,
knowing that this year is THE year.

A very sound offense and defense
can be counted on in Doremus Gym
this year. Five offenses with innum-
erable variations are the nucleus of
the Generals’ attack strategy. Over
the summer films have been pain-
stakingly studied to make last year’s
versatile offense even more effective.
With added depth a running type of
offense looms as an even more ex-
plosive threat.

As to defense anyone at Washing-
ton and Lee can tell you that nobody
out-defenses the Generals. Last year
brought national ranking in defense
to Coach Canfield’s crew once again.
But stand forewarned of even better
things. Added manpower enables the
use of more pressing type of de-
fenses as well as the use of the suc-
cess proven match-up defense.

This year some definite goals have
been decided on by the members of
the basketball program. Each player
has his own personal goals of what
he knows he is capable of and must
do, But for the team foremost is the
desire to re-gain the C.A.C. cham-
pionship. In addition the Generals
will strive to uphold their reputation
as one of the best large or small
teams in Virginia. Hopes are also
high that the basketball squad can
continue to be nationally ranked in
defense and scoring margins.

Scrimmages were fought out on
both Friday and Saturday nights
against a very tall and talented Fair-
mont State. The first night Wash-
ington and Lee downed the visitors

Blue booters go to NCAA

Great news from the Athletic De-
partment! Monday morning a phone
call announced that the W&L soccer
team was selected to represent dis-
trict 3 at the Eastern Regional NC-
AA College Play-offs. The first game
will be against Springfield College
on November 14. This play-off is
the best tournament possible for the
Generals to get invited to in soccer.
There is no national champion at
the college level so the eastern
championship is an honor worth
working for.

Springfield College which hosts
the event is a perennial powerhouse
and competed last fall. This year
their record is 11-1-1 losing only
to Dartmouth. Elizabethtown Col-
lege of New Jersey was also extend-
ed an invitation. A fine record of
8-2-2 won them a berth. Rounding
out the competitors is St. Joseph’s
from Philadelphia with a 7-3-1 rec-
ord.

It is the second time in Lyles’
tenure as coach that Washington and
Lee made the NCAA play-offs. In
1964 the blue boosters came in sec-
ond to Coast Guard,

The precious invitation can be
credited to several factors. The first
of these is an excellent defense
which is led by fullbacks Sayers,
Price, and Clarke. This trio teamed
up with goalie Newman have shut
the door on opponents surrendering
only one goal per game. Spectacular
games against tough competition
like Virginia and Roanoke aided

W&L sponsors Va. state meet

By Tom Rowe

For the second time in as many
weeks, Washington and Lee was in-
volved in a multi-team cross-country
meet in which an opponent literally
ran away with a victory, The occa-
sion was the Virginia state meet,
held, ironically, at Washington and
Lee November 7 on a newly-mapped
five-mile course. William and Mary
romped to an overwhelming victory.
An Indian official, claimed that 1969
was the eighth straight year that Wil-
liam and Mary had won the state
meet. W&L placed ninth this year.

The Indians did it with depth. At
the outset, there were 96 runners
from twelve schools. At the end,
William and Mary runners had plac-
ed first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
tenth and eleventh, and by then, the
scoring had stopped, and mercifully,
their other finishes need not be
enumerated. Point total for W&M
was 23, Finishing first, and thereby
receiving the largest of the copper-
colored shoe-trophies that went to

the first twelve runners to place (sec-
ond twelve received medallions),
was the Tribe’s Howell Michael,
whose 26:02.7 will stand for at least
ten months (till next season) as the
course record.

Virginia Tech put up a_ brave
front with runners second and third,
but the Indian onslaught proved
Tech bravado to be a facade, and
lech finished a distant second with
55 points. Eastern Mennonite’s Elton
Horst, a pre-meet co-favorite, finish-
ed a highly respectable eighth (worth
a trophy), but EMC wound up last
because none of its other runners
placed at all.

Washington and Lee, at 240, de-
feated Virginia Union, Old Domi-
nion, and Eastern Mennonite. Bill
Wilkinson, Dave Haydu, and Bob
Sherwood finished in that order for
the Generals. In this type of meet,
scoring is complicated. For scoring
purposes, certain lower finishers are
eliminated; some runners are dis-
qualified.

Washington and Lee in its effort to
get the nod.

rhis season has been somewhat a
surprise success. After losing great
players like Thom Mitchell and
Scott Fechnay through graduation
the outlook was dismal. The bench
this campaign has been very green
with four freshmen starting. Des-
pite their lack of experience the
youngsters really came through and
pleasantly surprised everyone,

Only a single regular match re-
mains unplayed. Randolph-Macon
brings its two stars Robertson and
White into 8-4-1 mark so far this
year and will provide plenty of trou-
ble for W&L this afternoon.

stantial crowd showed for the games
even though they were unannounced.
Both Cartwright and Gutshall starr-

fine overall hustle accounted for
several heads up plays. Surprisingly
enough each team seemed superbly
coached for this early in the year.
Floor mistakes were to be expected
but the offenses of each team de-
monstrated the capability to score

LETTERS TO

(Continued from Page 2)

supposedly did not investigate the
spirit of the letter, Since the letter
was all I had, | went over it several
times and have gone over it again
before writing this one. | may have
misinterpreted the spirit in which
it was given, but I did not ignore it.
So let’s return to the senior Shirk’s
letter and examine it again line by
line.

“L always thought that Washing-
ton and Lee men had the courage to
be different.” To this I replied that
we did, we have the couarge not
only to be different from other
schools, but also from each other.

“The courage of self-enforcement
of an honor system, the courtesy of
saying ‘hello’ on campus, the dignity
of dressing even when I attended
Washington and Lee before World
War IL.” This, I concede.

“Those who did not like these in-
stitutions did not attend Washington
and Lee.” Maybe so, but I doubt it.
Some may have valued an education
enough to put up with customs they
may not have agreed with. I cer-
tainly do not think dress standards
are adequate criteria for selecting a
college.

“Sometimes we were chided by
our peers for involving ourselves in
a system such as this, Nevertheless,
we did not bow to the pressures of
conformity evidenced by either pro-
test or lack of interest.” Probably
not, it was a different kind of con-
formity he bowed to, for one can-
not deny the conformity was there,
if life was as he described it.

“I sincerely hope that Washington
and Lee men will continue to be
different, will re-establish the values
that can be found in these customs,
and will begin to try to sell their
fellow-students on the values of
these customs.” I, for one, would
like to know what these values are,

THE EDITOR

or, at least, what the senior Shirk
thinks they are. I am sorry, but I
must disagree with Ken Shirk’s opi-
nion that his father is not advocat-
ing return to the old system. To me,
that is all he is doing. The bulk of
the meaning does not seem to me to
be found in the last two lines, but
rather in the whole letter. It is quite
obvious that by rediscovering the
values of customs, he means restor-
ing the past.

If what he is advocating is dis-
cussion of old values, with the pos-
sible acceptance or rejection of these
values, then I agree with him totally.
But I do think there are more im-
portant things which make W&L
stand out other than the clothes its
students wear and “hello.”

Obviously, neither Shirk will agree
with what I have said in totality,
but I do hope this will give a clearer
picture of what I meant. I wish to
emphasize that at no time was it my
intention to ridicule any person, I
certainly hope this will end discus-
sion on the way in which I originally
presented my views, that is, in cheap
phrases. I surely hope that discussion
will now center around the customs,
rather than the letters about them.

Officials Discuss

By MIKE HOUCK

Ihree Washington and Lee ad-
ministration officials are attending
a discussion at Randolph-Macon
Women's College in Lynchburg on
the possible establishment of an
eight-college student exchange pro-
gram.

The proposed exchange program
would be between four women’s
colleges—Hollins, Mary Baldwin,
Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar-
and four men’s colleges—Davidson,
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon,
and Washington and Lee.

 

Ihe W&L officials attending to-
day's conference are Lewis G. John,
dean of students, Frank A. Parsons,
assistant to the president, and Dr.
William J. Watt, associate dean of
the College.

The possibility of W&L’s entrance
into such a program was discussed
last Tuesday by the Faculty Discus-
sion Club. At this meeting a detailed
plan of the proposed exchange pro-
gram was presented and questions
concerning it were entertained.

The proposed program would in-
volve a limited number of juniors,

been performed at the home college.

According to a memorandum dis-
tributed among the faculty members,
the proposed program would be con-

the eight participating colleges and
their students. It is described as ex-

W&L Students To Attend
Washington Demonstration

By GARY POLIAKOFF

Approximately 50 to 60 W&l
students are going to Washington,
D.cC., for the three-day anti-war
demonstrations being held there this
weekend, They will travel by private
cars, leaving at different times on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday,

Walter Sales, president of the
Young Democrats, said that no plans
have been made for any anti-war
activities at W&L, few col
leges are sponsoring campus demon
strations or discussions of any kind.

Most peace efforts will be made in
Washington, although in this area,
the University of Virginia planned
a march in Charlottesville for Thurs-
day afternoon and Hollins College
is holding a few discussion groups
today.

At other nearby colleges various
numbers of people are going to

Washington, most of them by pri

stances buses have been chartered to
carry large groups of people.

In Washington Georgetown Uni-

termination if the experience of the
first year should prove all or part
of its features to be undesirable or
unfeasible.

On December | the question of
Washington and Lee’s participation
in the proposed program will come
before the faculty. At this time final
statements and reports will be de-
livered and a decision will be
reached,

Should the faculty agree to the
proposal, the Board of Trustees will
have to approve the measure before
it can be implemented.

If the University decides to par-
ticipate it would receive not more
than 30 exchange students, the ma-
jority of whom would come from
the participating women’s colleges.
A similar number of Washington and
Lee students would go to other col-
leges.

The matter has been under study
at W&L for several months, Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley attended a series of discussions
concerning the desirability of a stu-
dent exchange program during
February and March.

Late in March President Huntley
appointed a special ad hoc commit-
tee to discuss the problems, ques-
tions, and concerns that such an ex-
change program would introduce.
The committee's report was designed
as a basis for President Huntley's
continuing discussions with repre-
sentatives of other institutions.

The work of the committee in-
cluded discussion of financial mat-
ters, currigculum implications, and
ways in which student affairs would
be affected.

In July Huntley met with the
presidents of the other seven col-
leges for a three-day discussion at
the Peaks of Otter Lodge on the
Blue Ridge Parkway. This workshop
was used to formulate basic policies
to which the respective faculties and
boards of trustees could react

At this discussion tentative agree-
ments were reached concerning ap-
plication and admission, social regu-
lations, and financial arrangements

Huntley told the faculty at its
first meeting this academic year that
he would ask the Committee on
Courses and Degrees to review the
eniire matter of an exchange pro-
gram.

After studying the subject
thoroughly, he transfers his im-
pression of it on rice paper in the
traditional technique, using an ink
stick which is freshly ground in
water for each painting session.

The black ink is mixed with vege
table dyes directly on the brush. The
shading of color depends on the
order the colors are picked by the
brush.

The intricate process of Chinese
painting requires many years to
master. Devoted students, Ju noted,
must learn slowly but surely, learn-
ing the masters and memorizing their
work, traveling and observing for
themselves the trees, mountains, and
rivers, and learning to read paintings
of other persons.

Ju has had many exhibitions of
his works in China, where he was

An Appraisal

We were pleased that the Executive Committee adopted
Dave Bethea’s resolution concerning student involvement in
recruiting problems. That alone is significant.

What is more to the point, of course, is the goal of this
involvement. The proposal forms a committee which will
“thoroughly research the methods, approaches, and problems
encountered in the recruitment of the underprivileged, with
particular interest given to recruiting that group which is con-
spicuously lacking on our campus—the Negro.”

If the committee formulates a plan, the EC will invest the
investigatory group with sub-committee status so that the
plan may be implemented.

The public recognition of the overly homogeneous nature
of the W&L student body, and the EC’s determination to act
to rectify it, are both significant and long overdue. This school
has never utilized the potential recruiting resources it can call
upon, namely students and alumni, and it is time the roles of
both were greatly expanded.

It does occur to us that objections to this move will center
around two points. First, why involve students in admissions
work? One answer is that a student can be more convincing
and informative on many matters when talking to a prospective
student than an administrator might be. Further, of course,
it is the students who stand to lose most if the student body
is deficient in any way.

Many people will concede the role students can play in
the effort but object to the clause in the resolution which
focuses attention specifically on the Negro as an example
of the underprivileged groups to which the EC feels W&L
has been remiss in addressing itself.

This second objection can be met on several points. In the
first place, the Admissions Office has already exerted consider-
able effort toward recruiting the underprivileged, especially
the Negro. The minimal success they have encountered indi-
cates the need for the additional help the EC hopes to give
them.

Moreover, the type of students of which W&L is presently
composed are more accessible by traditional means of com-
munication—major among which is reputation—whereas
reaching students from other economic and cultural back-
grounds is likely to require more and different kinds of effort
than is presently being exerted in their direction.

Finally, of course, it is important from an educational
standpoint to make the student body more heterogeneous,
since it is integral to a liberal education that a student en-
counter people from backgrounds other than his own.

We cannot, then, object to the philosophy which prompted
the proposal. We do, however, notice one deficiency in the
machinery that has been set up.

There are inherent in the resolution no formal channels
by which this sub-committee, if it formulates a plan, can work
closely with the Admissions Office, and no directive that the
plan it presents contain ways to do so.

The resolution does provide that “Upon the implementa-
tion of a plan, this sub-committee will work in conjunction
and under the aegis of the Admissions Office.”’ But this pro-
vision seems to allow only as much cooperation as the directors
of the complementary groups wish to maintain. This being
the case, it seems at least as likely that the groups will work in
isolation (or that the student committee will be allowed to
atrophy) as that they will work together to the degree that
they might.

Sharing the Blame

We shared the disappointment of the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi and the Executive Committee upon learning that the
faculty had passed a new class schedule without consulting
students.

We cannot, however, unlike the Tuesday edition and the
EC, place the blame for this omission entirely on the faculty.
We feel that the Student Curriculum Committee and the EC
were at least equally to blame for their lack of awareness and
concern on the matter.

It is the specific responsibility of these bodies to make
the students’ sentiments a factor of any decision which affects
them. It is true of course that the institutionalized channels
for faculty-student communication are lamentably few, and
we do not mean to apologize for what was an obvious over-
sight on the faculty's part.

Our point merely is this: the Curriculum Committee and
the EC were aware that adaptations to the new system would
be necessary, and that proposals had to be formulated rapidly
because of the time limitations subsequent adaptations and
the publication of the catalog placed on them. With this in
mind, those committees, or at least the Curriculum Committee,
should have acted with the initiative students took last year in
effecting the original move on curriculum,

We might add that there are many other areas into which
students may move, and where their advice and assistance
would be welcomed. It is unlikely, however, that the faculty
will actively seek student aid without some indication of
interest and availability, We trust the students on the various
representative bodies will not again be so remiss, nor allow
the faculty to be.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Ring-tum Phi 4n Answer to Financial Problems

By MONTY COTTIER

In light of the points brought up
by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi’s arti-
cle concerning the financial prob-
lems of the fraternities, and especi-
ally the problem faced by many of
the houses of upperclassmen deacti-
vations, it seems only fair to offer
some possible solutions to these
dilemmas.

While the Tuesday edition com-
ments on academics and social
values of the fraternities, and their
relationship to the often heavy losses
among the upperclassmen were ex-
cellent, there was a major area left
untouched. This is the financial
aspect, one which, in light of the
large amounts of financial assistance
granted by the university, should
certainly be considered.

When a senior, who has been liv-
ing in an apartment for two semest-
ers at the beginning of his senior
year, in most cases, examines the
fraternity concept, he is likely to
encounter difficulties in justifying
the payment of the same dues and
expenses as he did when a sopho-
more,

After all, by his senior year, a
man who remains at W&L will have

made almost all the contacts he is
going to, settled into a routine of
living, both academic and_ social,
and will be welcome at his house’s
parties and other functions, There-
fore, he may be inclined to de-
activate, in order to save money, to
have money to spend in other ways,
or for pure lack of interest (or a
feeling that the house is no longer
interested in him).

While nothing much can be done
about the lack of interest on the
senior’s part (certainly not if nothing
has been done by his last year
here), steps can be taken to alleviate
the remaining problems.

One solution would be to put
house bills on a graduated scale,
with sophomores paying 125 per
cent of the standard house bill,
juniors the usual rate, and seniors
only 75 per cent. Through this, the
senior is given an initiative to remain
in the house both through financial
considerations and a realization that
the house is sufficiently interested in
the senior class to make an effort
to retain it.

Since in most cases the rents for
apartments are higher than house
board and room costs, the sopho-

mores would be paying amounts
commensurate with the expenses of
the seniors, who must pay these
rents; while the senior’s gradual in-
dependence of the fraternity as he
approaches graduation is reflected in
the costs of membership.

Among the reasons cited by the
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi for deactiva-
tion was “disillusionment with the
fraternity system as a whole.” This
active effort to include the seniors,
involving as it does a small degree
of financial loss for the fraternity
(although this loss is nothing com-

pared to the monetary strictures
imposed on a house by a heavy load
of deactivations), may at least aid
in overcoming this feeling of dis-
illusionment, provided it is not pre-
sented merely as a dry financial
maneuver intended to entice the
senior to put a few more dollars
into the house. It is instead ac-
companied with various other mea-
sures to adjust the house somewhat
to the wants and needs of the
seniors and maintain their involve-
ment in the fraternity and its
activities,

A Disturbing Conversation

By LAWRENCE MeCONNELL

One of our many roving cub re-
porters for the Friday Ring-tum Phi
came into our office yesterday al-
most breathless. He had sprinted all
the way from the second floor of
Washington Hall with his first big
story of the year, fainted over a
typewriter, and had to be revived
by sniffing news ink. Finally, after
two slurps of one of our editors’
guava ice cream cone, he was able
to relate his story.

After waiting outside the door of
one of our distinguished men of
administration on the 2:00-4:00 shift
for 37 days straight, he finally saw
one of our younger professors enter
the office with a look of concern
on his face. Crawling out from be-
hind his cover of an ashtray stand,
he moved stealthily to the door to
listen in on the conversation,

The following conversation was a
transcription of notes that our cub
reporter made in the margins of a

discarded Ring-tum Phi that our
man-on-the-scene pluckily found in
a nearby Washington Hall trash
basket.

Professor: “Dean, I just gotta talk
with you. It’s about the students...”

Dean: “Hm?”

Professor: “The students, Dean!”

Dean: “What? Oh, you frightened
me, | thought you were a student
... now, what's all this about stu-
dents?”

Professor: “Well, sir, I just can’t
understand it. First, they get in-
volved in something — like ihat
Moratorium we had last month—
that was healthy. Then they let it
drop! And you know that new
curriculum we're trying to work up
for next year? Well, last year all
we heard was ‘I don't like the way
courses are now — let's have more
freedom to choose our courses —
even the girls’ schools have an in-
dependent study program, why can't
we?’

ROTC Is Necessary
For Open-Minded W&L

By DOUG HAMILTON
(Editor's Note: This is the con-

When discussing the question of
the Reserve Officer's Training Corps’
future on the Washington and Lee
campus, it is necessary to refrain
from impulsively taking an “anti”
stand in light of the controversy
over the Viet Nam war. Currently
in the United States, there is a large
group which condemns anything to
do with the military, without look-
ing at the entire situation in a ra-
tional and unemotional way. In this
article | will show the advantages
in having a ROTC program, not
only here but on every other uni-
versity campus in the nation. | will
also show why ROTC has a right
to function as it presently does.

Those who attack ROTC often
assert that the goals of the uwni-
versity and a ROTC program are
incompatable. They say that a uni-
versity should stress individuality
and open-mindedness, and that a
ROTC program teaches narrow-
mindedness, and regimentation. If
this were true, then why does the
United States Army have any kind
of officer training program at all
on university campuses? Is the rea-
son not that they want open-minded
clear thinking men to lead our army:
that they don't seek a highly regi-
mented group of cutthroats as some
would have wus believe? Indeed,
ROTC is insirumental in the up-
holding of the American ideal of a
“civilian army.” In proof of this,
is the fact that over 50 per cent of
the officers in our army are drawn
from ROTC programs. Without
ROTC we might find that we do
have a professional army of trained
killers. Therefore, it is to the ad-
vantage of the nation, including
those who oppose what they feel
s a military-industrial complex, to
have ROTC programs. The removal
of academic credit from ROTC
would lessen ils appeal and conse
quently the numbers participating
And as stated earlier, reserve army
officers keep our army non-profes-
sional

ft also appears that some of
those who feel that the university
should be sure to protect and nurture

the rights of individuals don’t adhere
to this ideal themselves. What dif-
ference should it make to one stu-
dent what course of study another
takes?

ROTC is not forced on the uni-
versity. The army makes a contract
with the school administration as to
the credit it receives, and I am sure
that all facets of alloting it credit
are considered. The arguments for
stripping ROTC of academic credit
are vague and illogical. Military his-
tory, strategy, and science are as
much an academic subject as are
political and social science. In ad-
dition, ROTC emphasizes the de-
velopment of personal skills and con-
fidence, leadership, and physical en-
durance and courage, all valuable
traits to have in the “real world.”

In his attack on Washington and
Lee's ROTC program in the last
issue of the Friday Ring-tum Phi,
David Olson questioned the legita-
macy of the position given to ROTC
instructors. He siated that they
don't have the same training as other
professors, and thus should not have
commensurate status and power. |
would disagree with Mr. Olson on
both of these points. Not all sub-
jects require a graduate degree of
their professors. In the case of the
military, experience in the field is
just as important. Mr, Olsen also
failed to show why someone on the
ROTC staff should have any less
interest in the affairs of the Uni-
versity, although he did make the
contention.

The advantage in having military
men present in an academic com-
munity is that neither group loses
sight of the other. This relationship
enabies all to see each other's views,
which are certainly relative to each
other. Ignoring war and armies will
not end international strife; nor
will isolating academic and military
groups from each other accomplish
peace. When one faction of students
feels that other students are “taught
how to be cogs in a great murder
machine.” then it is time for better
communication, not less as would
be the case if ROTC were banned
from campus

in summation, | would say that
we should not only keep ROTC at
Washington and Lee, but should sup
port, encourage, and better atiempt
to understand its goals. Having such
a unit on campus is truly a mark
of an open-minded university com
munity

“So I thought, ‘Well, W&L is
finally coming around —’”

Dean: “Now, wait a minute, com-
ing around to what?”

Professor: “Well, you know, com-
ing around to the national norm of
activism. You read every day about
other campuses and their students—
how involved they are in getting
things done at their schools—and I
just don’t think we're up to the
national average.

“All the figures that Ive ever
read state that approximately 20
percent of students on the average
college campus are involved in off-
campus activities, 30 percent in
extra-curricular activities, 25 percent
in apthy, and the other 25 percent
in school work. So, in effect, almost
100 percent of the students in the
average college campus are involved
in something all of the time, but
our student involvement fluctuates
from about 10 percent to 40 per-
cent—some of them aren't even in-
volved in apathy. And even if they
are involved, they get dis-involved
too easily...

“I'll give you an example. One
of our majors called a meeting of
the rest of the majors in the de-
partment about the new curriculum
changes, and only one other fellow
showed up. I mean, if the students
wanted a change so bad last year,
how come they don't care about
it this year?

“And what about the girls in the
freshman dorms? After they got that
request, only four girls have been
up in the dorms in the last month.
Now the big thing is motorcycles
for freshman and l—"

Dean: “Hold it, hold it! Now. Are
you saying that what you're worried
about is that students lose interest
in something after they get it?”

Professor: “Exactly.”

Dean: “Well, this is a problem.
If what you say is true, then I
think many of my colcagues will
probably look at this coeducation
thing in a new light.”

Professor: “What do you mean
by that?”

Dean: “Well, think of the prob.
lems our public relations office will
have trying to explain why WAL
men suddenly stopped dating after
we gave them girls to go to school
with,”

Professor: “This is vexing...”

would like
reasons why,

to explain the main

First, bear in mind the ambiguity
of the proposition as it was stated
that night, that “all class officers
be required to attend EC meetings.”
This could mean several things,
from the officers attending and re-
maining mute, to their expressing
opinions on everything discussed that
night, sort of a non-voting EC-in-
themselves.

Secondly, how would the rule be
enforced? What would we do with
an officer who willfully and malici-
ously did not attend? Put him on
social or academic probation? Force
him to write cold checks and then
fine him? ete.

My major point, however, was
that we would be defeating the pur-
pose of the resolution by passing
it. In other words, we could not
make the class officers more re-
sponsible or competent by requir-
ing them to attend the meetings.
Jeff Burris admitted to me that
he thought that the officers from
other classes might be less competent
than they should be, and when I
asked what advantage would accrue
from forcing incompetent people to
attend meetings, | received an in-
coherent reply. The point is this:
If the officers of other classes wish
to attend meetings regularly, as do
our officers, if they wish to show
that much interest, then by all
means they should do so. I did not
feel that anything material could be
gained by forcing the officers to
be present. Ogilvie suggested that
Burris call a meeting of all class
officers to discuss the matter. Ac-
cording to my information, such a
meeting will take place some time
in the next two weeks.

Burris’ and Gray’s major rationale
for requesting the resolution was to
achieve greater communication be-
tween the classes and the EC.
Kumpuris pointed out that the class
officers could merely express their
views to their respective EC repre-
sentatives prior to the meeting. 1
maintain that this would certainly
be advantageous, but I also main-
tain that the officers should show
enough interest to remain for the
meeting. If they do not show this
imterest, chances are that they will
not be able to reflect adequately the
views of their classes to begin with.

In sum, | am opposed to the
resolution as it was stated that
night; however | am not opposed
to the rationale behind that resolu-
tion.

In the near future, | hope to con-
duct a survey among the freshmen
to sample their views concerning
coeducation, and I shall, in another
column, explain the reasons why the
freshman motorcycle resolution was
so soundly defeated.

Sincerely,

Alan Prater

Generals

Washington and Lee's 1969 foot-
ball team makes its last public ap-
pearance this Saturday in St. Louis
as the Generals journey to play
Washington University. The game
will be played in Busch Stadium as
part of a charity drive for H.E.L.P.
A crowd of 10,000 to 14,000 is ex-
pected.

“Emotion is going to be a fac-
tor,” noted Coach Leslie. “With 14,-
000 people cheering for Washington,
you know that team will be fired
up. We look for them to be emotion-
ally ready, but then I think we'll be,
too.” The Generals should be up
for the game, as the outcome of
this final ballgame will determine
whether or not Washington and Lee
has a winning season. With last

The soccer team traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts
to compete in the first round of the Eastern Regional NCAA
College Playoffs. Springfield College is W&L’s first opponent,
and the Generals will have to get the offense moving again
after a shoddy performance against Randolph-Macon on
Tuesday if they hope to advance in the tournament.

The NCAA bid was already in
the bag, Coach Lyles was out of
town, and it was the last game of
the season. Maybe these three can
be offered as excuses for the Cien-
erals’ mysterious bad showing against
Randolph-Macon, but the sad fact
is that they were just outplayed by
the Yellow Jackets, and the score
showed it, 3-0. If it had not been

for the hard-nosed play of the Gen-
erals’ full5acks, the score could have
been much higher.

R-M was the aggressor from the
outset, but fortunately they were not
able to capitalize in the first quarter.
W&L was getting the brevks as
Randolph-Macon had three very
near misses. The Yellow Jackets’

week’s upset victory over Southwest-
ern, the Generals are 4-4.

And no one probably wants a
winning season more than Coach
Leslie, who in his first year at the
helm in 1968 piloted the gridders
to a 3-5-1 record. A 5-4 season
would be a big improvement and an
inspiration to build on. “We've
shown improvement in all depart-
ments throughout the season,” Coach
Leslie noted. “And the leadership of
the seniors has been great. Last
Saturday we showed character, but
we must show it one more time.”

Although the nerve-racking deci-
sion Saturday was a “tremendous
win,” as Coach Leslie put it, the
encounter left an ugly trail of in-
juries, Quarterback Chuck Kuhn will
play “as long as he holds up.” Re-
ceiver Frank Stearns, bothered by
an ankle injury, shares the same
fate. Another receiver, Steve Ma-

late Wednesday and will probably
not be at full speed. The defense
appears sound, although the deep
back trio of Johnny Nolan, Dave
Brooks, and Jimmy Allen are aching
slightly. Brooks has pulled a muscle
while Allen and Nolan are suffiering
from hand injuries. Doug Gossmann,
junior fullback, will not be making
the trip due to a playing knee injury.

That's a pretty safe statement to

perseverance paid off midway in the
second quarter as their inside right
let go a blistering shot that Goalie
Ken Newman seemed to have under
control, but the ball slipped off his
fingers, arching into the goal. This
was the extent of the scoring in the
first half.

The Generals seemed fired up for
the second half, but thei offense
stalled and stumbled repeatedly,
Meanwhile a perfect corner-kick pro-
duced Randolph-Macon’s — second
goal. The Jackets’ right halfback
beat Newman with a headshot on
the corner-kick, putting the game
hopelessly out of reach.

An R-M_ insurance goal was
scored later in the game as the Gen-
erals continued to struggle to gen-
erate some offense.

Fortunately the NCAA bid did
not ride on the outcome of this
game. The Generals are certainly
capable of much better play, and
the return of Coach Lyles to the
sidelines after a one-game absence
should help tremendously. Spring-
field will be tough, but the soccer
team has come up with the big
win many times this year. Let's hope
they can again in these all-important
tournament games.

a week on Tuesday and Thursday
or any two days of Monday, Wed-
nesday and Friday.

These double periods could also be
scheduled three times a Week in a
Monday-Wednesday-Friday sequ-
ence, giving 36 meetings per term.
They are available in eight different
combinations.

laboratories or class meetings are
also available. Both classes would
have 12 meetings per term.

The committee recommended in
its report certain scheduling conven-
tions “to dove-tail courses into the

sist in compressing a large schedule
of classes into a relatively small
number of block-hours.”

After stating ten conventions for
the new schedule the committee add-
ed an eleventh one urging the vari-
ous faculty departments to schedule
their classes “uniformly” within the
scheduled space allotted them and
warned that “the Committee on
Registration and Class Schedules
may disapprove the proposed meet-

Che committee balanced these ad
vantages against such disadvantages
as the fact that some professors will

have to teach at unpopular hours
such as 8 a.m. or Friday afternoon,
limitations on the number and

character of sections that can meet,
and “somewhat more unevenness of
classwork within the week” for both
faculty and students.

rhe Committee’s report indicated
that these disadvantages stemmed
primarily from a reduction in time
that came with the switch from a
semester to a 12 week term set-up,
and that the scheduling conventions
would work to overcome this.

Tuesday Ring-tum Phi reporter.

“Harry Byrd ought to be chal-
lenged and defeated.” At least that
is what Dr. Milton S. Colvin, profes-
sor of political science, believes. Dr.
Colvin announced Saturday that he
is “seriously considering” running
against Sen. Byrd (D-Va.).

Dr. Colvin said he thought a
moderate should oppose Byrd and
went on to describe himself as an
“articulate, hard-driving common-
sense moderate.”

Openly admitting his status as an
unknown in the Virginia political
arena, Dr. Colvin does not consider
this a liability. He rather feels this
to be to his advantage, since he be-
lieves the people are “increasingly
looking for the citizen advocate
rather than the politician.” He also
added that he has not gained politi-
cal enemies as the result of “bruis-
ing campaign battles.”

Dr. Colvin declared his purpose
in announcing this possible challenge
to Byrd as a test of public sentiment
on his candidacy.

He said he disagreed with Byrd
“down the line” on fundamental
issues.

Dr. Colvin is unsure about which
party he will align with. To a large
degree this will depend upon what
course Senator Byrd decides to
pursue. Dr. Colvin sees three al-
ternatives open to the incumbent.
Either Byrd can run in the Demo-

Executive Committee passes resolutions

The passage of two unanimous
resolutions highlighted last night's
Executive Committee meeting. There
were no absentees at the session
which passed proposals concerning
reforms in the duties of class officers
and the cooperative student ex-
change program.

Freshman Alan Prater announced
that he and freshman class officers
Rick Gray and Jeff Burris had been
discussing reforms in the responsi-

bilities for class officers. He pro-
posed:
WHEREAS, the present powers

and duties of class officers are
not clearly defined; and

committee be formed composed
of the presidents from each class
and two Executive Committee
members to investigate and sub-
mit a report no later than the
first meeting in February on how
the powers and duties of class
officers can be expanded.

The proposal passed unanimously

and Joe Tompkins and Kevin Baker

were appointed to the committee de-

fined in the proposal.

The second resolution was the
result of a request by Dean John
for sentiment on a cooperative ex-
change student program among
seven Virginia colleges and one
North Carolina school. The request

prompted vigorous debate which re-
sulted in several proposed reslutions
and amendments.

The EC finally endorsed the pro-
gram with stipulations centering pri-
marily around the application of the
Honor System to exchange students.
The EC requested that exchange
students be tried under the Honor
System of the host school with the
usual penalties of the host school
being imposed.

The EC was also concerned lest
WAL be unable to withdraw from
the agreement after the first year.
The experimental nature of the pro-
gram was cited as being reason for
WAL to insist upon such an “escape
clause” should the experiment prove
to be worthless or harmful to WAL.

A third amendment to the original
endorsement called for the expan-
sion of the program to include a
wider diversity of students and
schools,

Finally the EC allowed for the
institution of an EC seat for the
exchange students. The seat would
be a non-voting one but the repre-
sentative would be able to discuss
general business and to attend the
honor trials of exchange students.

culinary desires

In the name of better living
through eating, a Food Preference
Survey is being held at the Com-
mons this Wednesday. The purpose
of the survey is to discover the
edibles which have the strongest ap
peal to the WAL gentleman

The survey will be conducted
through the use of a questionnaire

such that the student is asked to

Dr. Colvin told The Tuesday

Central Lost and
Found in Center

If you are a student who easily
loses articles and doesnt know
where to find them, there is now a
central lost and found. Freshman
class president, Rick Gray, has made
arrangements with Ken Lane to set
up a central lost and found in the
Student Union.

Students have complained that lost
items are not being turned in. The
cause of this may be due to the
students’ unawareness of where these
items can be returned. In the past
they have been kept in various loca-
tions from the library to the Regis-
trar’s office.

But now all lost and found items
can be reported to the front office
of the Student Union from 9:00 to
5:00 or by calling Ext. 299 of the
University. Ken Lane has also
agreed to keep a bulletin up to
date in the front lobby for con-
venience.

PRE-LAW STUDENTS

If you are concerned about how
your score on the LSAT and your
grade point ratio compare with those
of first year students in the nation’s
law schools, you may want to take
advantage of the LAW SCHOOL
PLACEMENT SERVICE. This in-
dependent counselling firm will com-
pare your LSAT score and GPR
with profiles of entering classes at
most of the 130 schools in our
country. They will also provide you
with a list of schools which fall
within the geographical and financial
boundaries which you specify, and
will indicate which schools accept
beginning students for the spring
semester and have evening divisions.

Information and applications
forms are available in the Place-
ment Office, Washington Hall 235,
The one drawback in the service is
that the firm fee for processing this
information is $20.00.

This service will prove to be ex-
tremely valuable in determining the
chances of a student to be admitted
to certain schools and the type of
law school that a student should
consider.

Sounding off ...

is due to the University’s necessity
of knowing whether or not to find
a second semester replacement for
Dr. Colvin should he decide to run,
which would require a leave of
absence.

The decision will be made after
the degree of statewide support for
his candidacy is analyzed. Another
difficulty which Dr. Colvin foresees
is the expense, “It will cost $250,000
to run for the Senate. Some people
say $100,000 more, but I think I
can manage on $250,000.”

A graduate of Yale University and
the University of Heidelburg in Ger-
many, Dr. Colvin came to W&L in
1961. He previously taught at the
University of Montana, the Uni-
versity of Chicago, and Vanderbilt.

In 1960 he made his only bid for
public office, which was unsuccess-
ful, from Montana's First Congres-
sional District. In 1964 he taught
in the Free School Association in
Virginia’s Prince Edward County,
This school was established for the

Negro children in the county when
the public schools were closed to
protest a Supreme Court integration
decision.

Dr. Colvin advocates total with-
drawal from South Vietnam and sup-
ports President Nixon’s withdrawal
plans with the exception of the
proposal to leave some logistical
troops in that area for several years.
He has also called for a “tough-
minded” program to curb inflation.

He feels the most important na-
tional issue is the halting of the
armaments race with a corresponding
curtailment of the defense budget.
He believes the funds now ap-
propriated to defense could be bet-
ter allocated in combatting urban
plight and pollution, in improving
educational opportunities and in pro-
viding job opportunities for the un-
skilled.

Dr. Colvin is married to the
former Countess Maria von Kiel-
mansegg of Austria and has five
children.

Law School honors

retired Va.

Washington and Lee University’s
School of Law Saturday night
honored two retired justices of the
Supreme Court of Appeals of Vir-
ginia for their “eminent contribu-
tions to the advancement of justice
under law.”

Chief Justice John W. Eggleston
of Norfolk and Justice Archibald
C. Buchanan of Tazewell, both of
whom retired last September, were
cited for their distinguished service
to Virginia at a dinner in Evans
Hall attended by approximately 100
federal, state and local judges, other

 

justices

members of the legal profession,
law educators and W&L law faculty
and student representatives.

In the accolades, which were pre-
sented to the two men by law pro-
fessor and retired Dean of the W&L
Law School, Charles P. Light, Jr.,
it was noted that both men are
“loyal alumni” of Washington and
Lee.

Chief Justice Eggleston received
four degrees from Washington and
Lee—the B.A. in 1906, the M.A.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, November 18, 1969

Paperbacks please

We appreciate fine woodwork as much as anyone else
but. . . libraries are generally designed with other purposes
intended than serving as showcases for exquisite carpentry.
Should the Student Center library continue to be just that?

Several weeks ago we published a notice asking students
to donate paperbacks to the library. As of today, the response
has been something less than commendable.

The library was planned and furnished to provide a com-
fortable atmosphere conducive to relaxed study. It cannot
meet these great expectations with barren austere walls of
wasted space.

 

Take a bigger step

For a University of our size and assumed calibre, we
are noticeably deficient in enabling our students to travel
elsewhere to study. This is a deprivation to our students and
to the school as a whole. For if a large number of students
were provided the opportunity to live on other campuses for
a year or a term, the benefits accrued would pertain not
merely to those immediately involved, but also to the entire
home academic community.

This should seem easy enough to understand, consider-
ing experience is the best teacher. Students who would be
exposed to an alternative culture for an extended period of
time, could more fully comprehend our own little world in
Lexington. That is, they would be in a more knowledgeable
position to assess our shortcomings through comparisons, and
to introduce through analytical syntheses fresh proposals to
correct and invigorate our stagnancies. Of course, the validity
of this assumption hinges on the participation of a significant
number of students. Currently, there are less than five stu-
dents studying off-campus.

The administration evidently realized our needs in this
regard last spring and set in motion the cumbersome ma-
chinery necessary to produce any constructive action. Two
weeks ago a memorandum was issued to the faculty explain-
ing essential background information of a proposed eight
college (seven in Virginia) exchange program. This pro-
gram, considered at a Faculty Discussion Club meeting last
Tuesday and to be further reviewed at the December faculty
meeting, as described in the memorandum is “experimental
in nature, and is subject to review, modification, or termina-
tion.”

This is certainly—and we hope the Board of Trustees
and faculty concur—a great leap forward in this matter.
Should the program receive the green light, W&L will ex-
change not more than thirty students with our neighboring
girls schools. Besides, if for some reason “the experience of
the first year prove all or part of the program’s features
undesirable or infeasible,” the program can be ended.

However, we do not believe that faculty-administration-
trustee interest on exchange should be confined in scope to
Virginia-North Carolina. Rather, it should encompass a much
larger area, particularly including foreign universities.

We have been encouraged in this desire by several facts.
First, the generous sabbaticals awarded to our professors.
Why not adapt the rationale for these to apply to students?
Second, the information session scheduled on Wednesday at
5 p.m. in duPont Auditorium by the University Foreign
Study Committee. This committee has expressed great in-
terest in helping students to gain acceptance in programs
offered by other colleges. But why don’t we have our own
foreign study program? It would be well worth the time
if we address ourselves to this want.

New book questions role
of administration in unrest

A new study of campus unrest
concludes that the real “campus
troublemakers” today are not the
students but the university presidents
and faculties. Laurence J. Kirsh-
baum and Roger Rapoport, co-
authors of the study, write that these
administrators form the basis of a
rigid bureaucracy which completely
disregards students’ constitutional
rights,

Entitled “Is The Library Burn-
ing?”, the study was sponsored by
the Carnegie Commission on the
Future of Higher Education and was
released in both hardcover and Vint-
age editions on November 11. The
authors traveled to over thirty-five
of the nation’s most turbulent uni-
versity and high-school campuses in
an effort to discover the root of
campus disorders.

In a series of journalistic vignettes,
the book shows the chief protagon-
ists of student power during their
unguarded moments off the national
stage. Harvard President Nathan
Pusey is heard confessing from his
office in a freshman dormitory: “I
don’t have time for radical students.
I'm too busy working on faculty
appointments.” San Francisco State
President S. 1. Hayakawa is heard
talking about his battle rations: “I
enjoyed myself immensely during all
the rioting. Whenever there was any

“In the summer of 1967, we have
seen in our cities a chain reaction
of racial violence. If we are heed-
less, none of us shall escape the
consequences.”

“Race prejudice has shaped our
history decisively; it now threatens
to affect our future White
racism is essentially responsible for
the explosive mixture which has
been accumulating in our cities since
the end of World War IL.”

KERNER COMMISSION
REPORT

A seminar on race relations be-
tween Washington and Lee and
Sweet Briar? You've got to be
kidding.

Two schools, approaching lily-
white, located in rural Virginia, have
set up a student seminar in Race
Relations to meet monthly at alter-
nate schools.

The Political Science Club and
International Relations Association
of W&L last year began looking
for a relevant modern issue on
which to base a co-educational

seminar with a neighboring college.
The first reaction came from Sweet
Briar’s Council for the Understand-
ing of Racial Attitudes—of course,
Sweet Briar pushed for Race Re-
lations as their issue.

But how should the topic be
approached?

“The causes of recent racial dis-
orders are embedded in a tangle of
issues and  circumstances—social,
economic, political, and psycholo-
gical—which arise out of the historic
pattern of Negro-white relations in
in America.”

KERNER COMMISSION
REPORT

In the first meeting of the seminar
last month, the group decided that
an interdisciplinary approach to the
problem would be attempted through
a study of black literature on all
subjects, from all angles.

Seminars on political and emo-
tional issues have a tendency to get
bogged down in ideology, PSCIRA,
aS a non-partisan group, suggested
that the topic of Race be approach-
ed without an ideological goal, but

Hilliard harangues Spiro

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Spiro T. Agnew isn't even funny
anymore. He's pathetic, sickening,
and dangerous! He tells the truth.

When Spiro made his notorious
remarks during the campaign about
“that fat Jap” and “if you've seen
one slum, you've seen them all,”
people just laughed. The guy was
obviously just a stupid politician,
and who could really get mad at
him for that?

During his first nine months as
Vice-President. Spiro managed to
keep his big foot out of his even
bigger mouth, mainly because he
judiciously kept his mouth shut, But
apparently desiring to become a
household word, Spiro has started
talking again—and it's ne laughing
matter,

Spiro began his current crusade
to wipe out the evils of American
liberalism with his attack on the
October 1§ Moratorium on the Viet-
nam War, At a fund-raising dinner
in New Orleans. Agnew condemned
the Moratorium as a senseless
demonstration by youths blinded by
“a spirit of national masochism (and)
encouraged by an effete corps of
impudent snobs” who call themselves
intellectuals

The next target of the venemous
V.P. was Sen. Edmund Muskie.
Spiro charged Muskie with playing
“Russian roulette with U. S. secur-
ity” because the senator had pro
posed a six-month unilateral halt in
multipe warhead (MIRV) tesis. With
the U.S.-Seviet disarmament talks
beginning in Helsinki, Muskie felt
that chances for progress would be
improved if the MIRV tests were
delayed. But apparently still smart-
ing from the comparisons made be
tween the two vice presidential
candidates lasi year, Spiro chose to
question Muskie’s patriotism

Fhe wrath of Spiro’s most recent
tirade has been cast upon television

news. The reason for his outburst
was that the networks chose to ana-
lyze President Nixon's Vietnam
Speech. The gist of Spiro’s remarks
was that television networks should
not comment on presidential policy
—tnless of course they comment
favorably.

This is preposterous. As a public
service, television has the duty to
more than just present the news.
Interpretation and analysis is neces-
sary if the news is to be put in a
context that will give it meaning.
Does the Vice President wish to sup-
press freedom of the press?

Spiro’s entire speech on the sub-
ject was full of half truths and
sweeping generalizations so wide
that they made absolutely no sense.
He claimed that television created
Siokely Carmichael and George
Lincoln Rockwell by giving them
air time. Apparently the Vice Presi-
dent does not realize that the Fed-
eral Communications Commission
Fairness Doctrine dictates that tele-
vision must give air time to all
political philosophies (even if it
means giving free time for vice
presidential hysteria).

Spiro accused the networks of
creating news by playing up the
negative. Should television simply
ignore a riot? Doesn't television
have a duly to present all news-
worthy happenings?

ABC was castigated by the vice-
president for alowing Averill Harri-
man to comment on Nixon's speech
Who, may I ask the Vice President,
is better qualified to make a com-
ment than the man who spent eight
months at the Paris negotiations?

Spire is slowly crealing a poison
ous air of MeCarihyism inthe
United States, Several Senators, in-
cluding J. W. Fulbright, have re
ported an increase in hate mail from
“patriotic Americans” accusing them
of being communists

What comes next Mr
dent? The witch hunts?

Vice Presi-

rather with an educational one, By
setting aside a goal of action for or
against the black, the seminar will
attempt to understand some of the
forces militating towards change in
America’s racial attitudes.

One of the writers is Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver. An out-
cast, in self-imposed exile in Soviet
Russia, a man who could not find
his place in the freest society in
the world, wrote in Soul on Ice:

“If it is bothersome to you, it
is quite a task for me beacuse not
too long ago it was my way of
life to preach, as ardently as |
could, that the white face is a
race of devils, created by their
maker to do evil, and make evil
appear as good: that the white is
the natural, unchangeable enemy of
the black man, who is the original
man, owner, maker, cream of the
planet Earth: that the white race
was soon to be destroyed by Allah,
and that the black man would then
inherit the Earth, which has always,
in fact, been his.”

On Thursday evening, the Race Re-
lations Seminar will meet in the
Library of the University Center to
discuss both Soul on Ice and the
Kerner Commission Report's Iniro-
duction,

The format of the eight o'clock
meeting is informal, regulated dis-
cussion of Cleaver and of our gov-
ernment report on the background
to civil disorders. The meeting is
open to anyone interested in par-
ticipation,

What good can such a non
partisan discussion of the Black and
the Caucasian serve? Maybe Carl
Rowan partially answers the ques
tion in this month's edition of the
Sigma Delia Chi Quill:

“Nothing disiresses me more to-
day than the fact that people, black
and white, have fundamentally lost
the belief that we can build a mutlti-
racial society in which people live
with a mutual admiration and te
spect. You've got blacks opting for
separatism, saying they reiect in-
tegration because the white man's
made it obvious that he never be-
lieved in it an disn’t really going to
accept it, And you've goi whites
believing that there's just no al
ternative other than the majority use
whatever economic, military, police
and other power it has to put down
this suddenly. irksomely trouble
some minority.”

trouble | stocked up for lunch in
the office. From then on the biggest
problem was whether to have sar-
dines or pate de fois gras.”

The plight of the students at Berk-
eley, Wisconsin, Chicago, and other
campuses throughout the country, is
depicted as the authors relate the
administrative resistance students en-
countered in response to their pro-
posals for change. Portraying the
moments of pathos and irony in the
campus events, the two young
journalists see the president in a
situation where he needs a scape-
goat, but his options are limited.
He cannot blame the faculty for the
turmoil, since he serves at their
pleasure; he cannot blame the legis-
lators which hold his purse strings;
he will not blame himself. “, . . That
leaves only one scapegoat—the stu-
dents. And whether the students are
right or wrong on any given issue
is irrelevant. They must lose simply
because they are students,” write the
authors,

At the same time the authors are
equally critical of the faculty. “The
modern American professor,” they
observe, “has become an admirer of
students more in the abstract than in
the flesh...The modern professor
spends as little time as possible with
undergraduates . . . He’s a mobile
father, who, while achieving fame
and fortune downtown, bristles at
the suggestion that he should be re-
sponsible for the kids at home.” As
a result, the authors define the “ugly
self-perpetuating cycle” of student
unrest in which faculty members,
once sympathetic to student off-
campus causes, become increasingly
hostile as the demands move into
the classroom,

Roger Rapoport, twenty-three,
was graduated from the University
of Michigan in 1968. His articles
have appeared in “Esquire,” “Look,”
“Harper's” and other periodicals,
Laurence J. Kirshbaum, twenty-five,
also attended the University of
Michigan, graduating in 1966. He
was a reporter for “Newsweek” for
two years and is currently a free-
lance writer living in San Fran-
cisco. Both authors worked on the
editorial staff of the “Michigan

sity of Michigan, Mr. Rapoport as

aging editor.

‘Cowboy’ offers

provocative look

By CY DILLON

Every kid who ever flexed his
muscles in front of a mirror knows
a little about being Joe Buck, Some-
times it almost hurts to watch “Mid-
night Cowboy.”

That's nearly all I can add to
the hundreds of diverse reviews that
have been written about “Cowboy.”
The movie seems to impress critics
deeply—regardless of age, intellect,
or employer. Reactions and concep-
tions vary greatly, but few reviewers
are left unaffected.

“Cowboy” should appeal to you
a8 a moviegoer because so many
different phases of cinematic art are
so well handled. If you enjoy good
acting, adept directing, smooth
photography, skillfully developed
themes, or symbolism that makes
for pleasant conversation with your
English professor, you'll find Joe
and Ratso’s story worth seeing. If
you appreciate all these qualities,
you'll probably talk yourself into
going more than once.

If you've seen “Cowboy,” | prob-
ably can't tell you why you liked
H# or why you didn't enjoy the
movie, and if you haven't seen it
Fd be foolish to predict your re-
action. | can only say that you
haven't seen many films that look at
life the way this one does

“Midnight Cowboy” struck me as
being less depressing and more
complex than general opinion holds
Unless you're afraid to be told that
American men live in constant fear
of being considered homosexuals, of
unless you don't want to have
distinctions between proper and im-
proper people challenged, give
“Cowboy” a try. Ai worst, it can
only make you see yourself lonely

The National Collegiate Athletic

be desired as far as Washington and
Lee University was concerned. The
Generals were rained out Friday,
defeated 10-0 on Saturday by Eli-

on Sunday by St. Lawrence 8-0.

By MIKE BERRY
Assistant Sports Editor

Washington and Lee University’s
football season is over, and despite
what many people will think when
they notice the 4-5 record the Gen-
erals compiled, it was one of the
most successful seasons in quite a
few years,

[To begin with Washington and
Lee had, this past season, one of
the youngest teams in its long his-
tory. The starting lineups included
nine juniors, five sophomores, and
at different points in the season, five
freshmen. When a teain is playing
with this much youth, it steadily
improves itself, The experience these
men obtained this year will aim
W&L toward a more successful
future.

Another notable thing about this
W&L team is its size. The Generals
offensive backfield averaged a mean
173 pounds, the defensive backfield
ran about 174, That’s not too bad
for small college football, yet it still
ran about five to seven pounds less
than most General opponents. The
real difference in sizes rested in the
W&L offensive and defensive lines.

The General offensive line aver-
aged out to 182 pounds per man,
while the defensive line was slightly
higher at 186 pounds per man. To
come to the point, that is small.
As a matter of fact, to pass along
to you from a very reliable source,
this General team is probably one
of, if not the, smallest teams play-
ing a collegiate schedule today. |
think this is a credit to the players
and to the coaches. It is interesting
to note that in a size-oriented sports
world the Generals of W&L are as
successful as they are.

rhe players are spirited and tough
and the coaches prepare them well.

W&L’s season opened on the road
this year against a surprisingly tough
lowson State team. They battled
the Generals right down to the wire
only to be defeated 14-13. Chuck
Kuhn took scoring honors by run-
ning in the two W&L touchdowns
Jack Baizley’s educated foot added
the decisive extra points. It was a
game of surprises and makes the
W&L vs. Towson State match look
promising for the next few years

The following weekend saw Wash-
ington and Lee taking on state rival
Randolph-Macon. Macon proved to
be too much for the Generals as
their elusive halfback, Howie
Stevens, picked his way through the
Generals’ defense and led the Yel-
low Jackets to a 41-16 victory

The conference season opened on
October 4 as the Generals took on
the Centre College Colonels. The
Colonels were up for the game and
managed to eke out a 14-7 victory
The Generals outplayed the Colonels
but were unable to score the needed
touchdown, (The Colonels are now
the CAC champions.)

The following weekend WAI
played perhaps its finest football
game of the season. Down 13-0 at
halftime the Generals came back in

the second half as quarterback
Chuck Kuhn opened up to flanker
Bruce Green. Emotions started to
rise and the Generals pulled off a
21-13 victory over Hampden-Sydney,

Hoping to keep the momentum
rolling, the Generals came into
Openings Weekend against a strong
Tufts University team. The Gen-
erals constantly harassed the Jumbos,
but time ran out as the Generals
threatened to score the winning TD
The result was a heartbreaking 20-
15 loss.

According to predictions, the rest
of the season should have been full
of easy victories for the Generals
But the predictions proved to be
wrong as the Generals traveled to
Bridgewater College. Though we
were heavy favorites, the fight was
tough to pull out a 10-6 victory. The
game was decided by the golden
instep of Jack Baizley, who kicked
a thirty-yard field goal and the

extra point. Thus “the Baiz” ac-
counted for the four points that
beat Bridgewater.

The next weekend the Generals

boarded their chartered plane and
took off for Sewanee. Although once
again heavily favored, the Generals
were ripe for an upset and Sewanee
was ready to pluck them from the
tree. They did. Before Sewanee’s
homecoming crowd, the Generals
dropped another conference match,
37-21. Th Generals had to win the
next two matches to have a winning
season overall, and to break even in
the CAC.

Things started off bright, as the
Generals came into Parents’ Week-
end with high spirits. They played
excellent ball for three quarters. In
the final period the Southwestern
Lynx gained their momentum and
made their bid for the upset. But
that surge fell short, as the Generals
beat the Lynx 24-19. Many people
called this game one of the best
they have ever seen the Generals
play. Dan Pusey complimented the
team on their poise and for “keep-

Dickens clarifies foreign study

This week’s information session
about study and travel abroad spon
sored by the Foreign Study Com-
mittee will be held on Wednesday
at 5 p.m. in duPont auditorium, and
not on Thursday as announced in
last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi.

Professor Dickens, Foreign Study
Committee chairman, acknowledges
the error to be his alone. The
Wednesday afternoon gathering will
present information about various
academic programs, summer work
abroad, life with a foreign family,
and more general information con-
cerning independent travel.

out that a cumulative GPR of 2.5 is
still required for endorsement by the
committee, although the statement

no responsibility.

ing cool” as the action, at times,
got hot and heavy.

Last weekend turned out disap-
pointing. The Generals flew to St.
Louis and Washington University to
play in Busch Stadium before an
estimated crowd of 10,000. But an
injury ridden squad could not hold
up to an inspired Washington U.
Kuhn played with a bad leg, Jack
Baizley replaced him only to have a
blind-side knee shot put him out of
the game as Chuck returned. But
the anticipated crowd of 10,000
turned out to be a measly 2500,
not to mention the poor turf. The
only bright spot for the Generals
was the 101-yard interception return
by sophomore Dave Brooks, and the
excellent locker room facilities of
a pro stadium, Washington U. hand-
ed W&L a 20-12 defeat and a 4-5
season,

Coach Leslie termed this year a
“significant rebuilding year” and has
cited the “loss of key personnel,”
the replacement of whom will de-
cide W&L’s future success. The most

team for Elizabethtown was Dave
Bender, one of the best players
W&L has attempted to contain all
fall. Having been invited to the
championship for four consecutive
years, Elizabethtown was simply a
better team.

Washington and Lee's next op-
ponent turned out to be tough St.
Lawrence from Canton, New York
\ Scottish boy, Matt Dennet, was
truly amazing on offense. The Blue
offense could not get going because
of non-stop pressure on its fullbacks
St. Lawrence was as high as a kite
for the consolation match, and need-
less to say the Generals were out-
manned.

notable losses are the three tri-
captains: McJunkin, Thornton, and
Dean Kumpuris. Gone also are the
quarterbacks Baizley and Kuhn and
free safety John Nolan.

McJunkin and Thornton were
starting tackles and center and an-
chored the offensive line. Kumpuris
led the defensive unit with the most
tackles at an average of 12.8 per
game. Chuck Kuhn led the CAC in
total offense as he passed for 924
yards and ten TD's. Baizley was
second in scoring with sixteen extra
points and two field goals for a
total of 22 points, Nolan was sec-
ond in interceptions with five,

Also graduating are Jay Meri-
wether, Ken Carter (W&L’s punting
specialist who averaged thirty-five
yards a punt), end John Thomas
who was third in pass receptions
with fourteen for 104 yards, and the
team’s leading receiver and ace end,
Steve “the Chief” Mahaffey, who
grabbed thirty-three for 371 yards
and three TD's.

JoJo Martin led the team in rush-
ing with 435 yards in 135 carries

NCAA games

Explanations cannot soothe such
a pair of whippings but perhaps ex-
pectations can. It is undoubtedly a
propos that Washington and Lee
represented the South in this tourna-
ment. Their record was one of the
finest in the area. But the tourna-
ment made it clear that the calibre
of soccer north of Virginia is far
superior to that below the Mason-
Dixon Line.

Expectations for mext year may
help W&L forget last weekend.
Young players made up the squad
which earned a berth in a national
tournament. These boys will want
to go back and will do anything
necessary to go back as an even
better team next fall.

for an average of 3.2 yards per
carry. The team’s leading scorer and
yardage maker in the pass receiving
department was flanker Bruce Green.
Green made twenty-five grabs for
438 yards and 8 TD's. Bruce had
an excellent season and should be
the leading CAC receiver next year.

The all-purpose man on defense
this year was Dave Brooks. Dave
had 180 yards on thirty punt re-
turns, He was second in tackling

with an average of 10.6 per game.
He also led the team in interceptions
with six for 106 yards and two
TD's.

As of November 8, the CAC team
standings placed the Generals fifth
in rushing offense with 144 yards
per game; first in passing at 121
yards an outing; third in total
offense at 265 yards a contest; and,
first in pass defense yielding only
96 yards a game through the air.

Foreign Study
Survey Planned

Ihe Foreign Study Committee will
circulate a questionnaire on a pro-
posed foreign study program for the
new six-week term next week, ac-
cording to David B. Dickens, as-
sistant professor of German and
chairman of the committee.

Dickens said he hopes the ques-
tionnaire, which will be distributed
only among freshmen and sopho-

mented during the next academic
year.

He said Washington and Lee lags
behind in providing foreign study
opportunities for its students.

Students taking part in the pro-
posed program would have to have
an adequate oral command of a
foreign language and a cumulative
grade-point ration of 2.5 or better.

Dickens said an intensive train-
ing program would probably be
established by the University as well.
This program would supplement the
foreign study program and provide
preparation for it.

Dickens discussed present oppor-
tunities for travel and study abroad
at a meeting Wednesday in duPont
Hall.

About 30 students heard him dis-
cuss opportunities for getting jobs in
Europe, living with a foreign fam-
ily, independent travel, and academic
study.

He described study situation con-
ducted by both universities and in-
dependent organizations, including
programs in a number of countries
for an entire year, a semester, or a
summer,

During the meeting he described
the work of the committee as “an
attempt to assist Washington and
Lee students in spending time in
Europe in both academic and non-
academic situations.”

$1200 Center Budget
Approved by Huntley

The annual budget for the Uni-
versity Center, submitted by the Uni-
versity Center Committee to Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley, has been
approved.

The budget includes $1000 for en-
tertainment in the Cockpit and $200
for the creation of a new lounge.

Under the leadership of chairmen
Bill Gottwald and John Miller, the
Center Committee plans to use its
entertainment funds to provide a
number of free weekend combos in
the Cockpit over the remainder of
the year.

The new lounge which the budget
provides for will be located in rooms
112-113, across from the TV room.
The lounge will be designed for in-
formal meetings and such activities
as a trial coffee house several eve-
nings a week

The center is also purchasing cof-
fee urns so that coffee can be made
available for student meetings. A
minimal charge will be made for
groups of more than 20 members.
Coffee can be arranged through Ken
Lane, University Center Director.

During the second semester, the
Committee is planning a series of
faculty-siudent coffee hours in the
Cenier library. The purpose of the
meeting will be to give students,
especially freshman and sophomores,
the chance to meet professors in
each academic department. Profes-
sors and student majors will De in-

Joseph A. Presel, State Department official, discusses disarmament with
WA&L students at a YR meeting held last Tuesday.

Disarming Said Unlikely

By ROGER MUNSICK
Associate News Editor

State Department official Joseph
A. Presel termed disarmament “ex-
ceedingly unlikely” and painted a
grim picture of the frusirations of
high level negotiations before an
audience of Washington and Lee stu-
dents and guests Tuesday night.

Presel’s speech on “Is Disarma-
ment Possible?” was sponsored
jointly by the W&L Young Republi-
cans and the Political Science Club
and International Relations Associa-
tion.

Presel opened his discussion with
a brief history of movements in dis-
armament, dating from the Middle
Ages, but having their modern
origins in a conference at the Hague
in 1899.

He dealt briefly with attempts to
limit naval power in the 1930s, with
the ill-fated Baruch plan of 1946,
with the Atoms for Peace proposals
of the Eisenhower administration,
and with the nuclear negotiations of
the past decade.

Presel also noted the presence of
disarmament talks in non-nuclear
phases of warfare, citing the current

Broadus To Head Group

A Knoxville. Tenn.. businessman
has been appointed chairman of the
Robert E. Lee Associates of Wash-
ington and Lee University by the
university's Board of Trustees, Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley an-
nounced today.

Thomas H. Broadus, owner of
Thomas Broadus & Co., Agents, a
general insurance agency, sticceeds
David D. Johnson, a Pittsburgh, Pa
industrialist who has served during
the past year as the first chairman of
the Associates.

The Robert E. Lee Associates
organization is composed of persons
whose support of Washington and
Lee has been exceptionally gener-
ous, There are currently almost 200
members.

The Associates program was
iMitiated in 1968 by the trustees to
recognize and honor Washington and
Lee's most loyal benefactors

President Huntley noted that “The

“It is good to know thai a per-
son of Mr. Broadus’ ability will be
carrying on the work led so ably
during the Associates’ first year by
Mr. Johnson,” he added.

Broadus is a 1925 graduate of
Washington and Lee. and he re

Presel said, and any progress in the
field will be “slow, imprecise, and
not immediately obvious.”

An informal question-and-answer

During this interval, the State De-

questions concerning the deployment
of nuclear weapons.

_ Committee Eyes

- Advisory System,

Suggests Change

By MIKE HOUCK
Staff Reporter

[he Student Curriculum Commit-
tee has submitted a report to the
Faculty Curriculum Committee
which recommends an overhaul of
the present freshman advisory sys-
tem.

Under the proposed plan a com-
mittee would be appointed by Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley to supervise the recruitment of
faculty advisors and the assignment
of advisers.

This committee would include
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
Dean Edward C. Atwood of the
School of Commerce, Economics,
and Politics, Director of Admissions
James D. Farrar, Dean of the Col-
lege.

Should the proposed plan be
adopted, the new committee would
be labeled the University Advisory
Committee. Its goal would be to im-
prove the effectiveness of the ad-
visory system by the inclusion of
administration, faculty, an dstudent
points of view.

The Student Curriculum Commit-
tee also proposed that the “interest

inventory forms” suggested by Dr.
Henry S. Roberts, professor of bi-
ology, be implemented. These forms
would be sent to new students im-
mediately upon receipt of their let-
ters of acceptance. The information
gained would serve as an aid to the
appointment of faculty advisors.

It was also suggested in the re-
port that “The first contact between
the freshman and his advisor should
be on a social basis, rather than the
current businesslike encounter.” The
committee hopes this would “pro-
vide for a broader and more pro-
ductive relationship between the ad-
visor and advisee.”

The committee also recommended
that student advisory panels be
organized. These panels would equ-
ally represent the divisions of the
University, and would be composed
of two representatives from each de-
partment,

They would operate both in fall
and spring registration and be under
the control of the Student Curri-
culum Commitee. Their chief func-
tion would be the provision of re-
sponsible student advice with regard
to the curriculum.

School of Commerce,
Divisions Renamed

The 63-year-old School of Com-
merce and Administration has been
renamed the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

Dr. Edward C. Atwood, Jr., dean
of the school, said, “The name was
changed in order to reflect accur-
ately the modern scope of offerings
m the school and the school's role
in higher education.”

Debaters Elect Wright

Tim Wright, a Washington and
Lee junior from Houston, Texas,
has been unanimously elected stu-
dent president of the four-state re-
gion of the Delta Sigma Rho—Tau
Kappa Alpha Forensic Fraternity
Conference.

The election occurred at a
ference tournament at Bridgewater
College last weekend. Included in
th region are the states of Virginia,
Wst Virginia. Maryland, and Dela-
ware, plus the District of Columbia

In addition, Wright won the top

had its first losing tournament of
the school year at Mark Grobmver,
Bob Muni. Lee Harriss and Tim
Junkin won just two of eight de-
butes.

Approval of the name change was
given by the University Board of
Trustees.

Dr. Lewis W. Adams, who fe-
tired from administrative duties
July 1 after 20 years as dean of

the commerce school, had proposed
that the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics and Politics would be a be-
fiting mame for the school, Dean
Atwood noted.

In addition, twe name changes in
departments within the school were
approved:

—The Department of Commerce
has been redesignated the Depart-
ment of Administration.

—The Department of Political
Science has been redesignated the
Department of Politics.

All three changes resulted from
the University’s self-study of 1964-
66. from faculty discussions, from
talks with interested students and
alumni, and from consideration at
the administrative level.

“It seemed important to maintain
the historical identity of the School
of Commerce for which our alumni
and students bear respect, loyalty,
and devotion, and the establishment
of which brought the realization of

General Lee's dream.” Dr. Adams
said.

“Alt the same time. it is most
fitting to give recognition to the

wishes of the faculties and to the
graduates of the deparimenits of
economics and politics

“Moreover, the title Departmen!
of Administration corresponds with
current usage and connotes more
precisely the aims and character of
our present curriculum.” the retired
dean said,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Colvin Presents “Issue-Oriented” Views

(Editor's Note: The following interview is a

transcription of a taped conversation with W&L

Professor of Political Science, Milton Colvin,

Friday staff member, Monty Cottier talked with

Professor Colvin last Wednesday of his inten-

tions to run for the U.S. Senate against Senator

Byrd.)

The Friday Ring-tum Phi: What, basically, is your plat-
form?

Dr. Milton Colvin: Well, I took the position in the
Moratorium talks, as regards to the Vietnam issue, that
1 was in favor of a withdrawal from Vietnam, but
I did not want that to be a precipitous withdrawal, I
wanted to protect the troops that We have there and
protect our allies and give South Vietnam a fighting
chance to put together a good government.

And I might say, incidentally, that | do not consider
the present government in South Vietnam to meet that
standard. And, I want to protect us from all the
political demigogues and adventurers who would be
crying beterayal and treason if we were to have this
withdrawal. So, in a sense I support the President's
position on the method of withdrawal, but I do differ
with him on one point, and it is a major point: | want
it to be a total withdrawal. | am opposed to keeping
logistical support of, say, 100 or 200 thousand men
behind in Vietnam. When we get oul, we should get
out entirely.

There are many other stands that are important,
but, basically speaking, | would say that I am issue-
oriented, I think that the people of the United States
want to hear facts, they want to hear common sense,
they recognize that nobody has all the answers, but
they at least want somebody who'll level with them.
They want an end to the credibility gap, if you will,
I'm simply talking common sense to the common
people. That's Adlai Steven's phrase, and I think it's
a pretty good one,

R-t Phi: Then would you say that you differ sub-
stantially from Senator Byrd?

Colvin: | think | differ with Senator Byrd on almost
every issue; | would say EVERY issue, but I noticed
in his recent newspaper statement that he opposed
eranting higher salaries to incumbent senators, and I
also support that position. | think they're well-enough
paid as it is.

But, in general, I think there's a fundamental disa-
greement down the line. I believe that his position has
been a reactionary position; I believe that he has
favored the wealthy at the expense of the rest of us,
I believe that he has been destructive in education, both
in the state of Virginia and nationally, and I believe
that he is a man who looks backward rather than
forward. It’s a pretty fundamental disagreement.

R-t Phi: Do you think Senator Byrd will go ahead and
seek the nomination?

Colvin: I'm assuming that the full-page ad which ap-
peared in the major newsapapers yesterday is an indica-
tion that he will seek the nomination, and that he
will stay in the Democratic party. Of course, this ad
was put in by his supporters and was not a statement
from Senator Byrd himself. And that means, of course,
that he could decide to withdraw from the race or
go over into the Republican party. But I don’t believe
that he will do so, As I indicated in another interview,
my Republican friends tell me they don’t want him.
But | think whatever the Byrds may do, you have to
give them credit for courage. They won't run from a
fight, and I think he will take all comers in the Demo-
cratic primary. But I think I can give him the best
fight of any challenger

R-t Phi: Do you think that the election of Linwood
Holton will make the Republican party in Virginia a
party to be dealt with?

Colvin: | think it will, because Mr. Holton is a politi-
cal moderate. and | know him personally. He's a
friend, and | admire him. He brings leadership to the
Republican party in Virginia, and | think it’s worth
noting that his running mate, | am speaking of his
candidate for attorney-general, fell by the wayside and
took a more conservative stand, and I think it's quite
clear that even Virginia Republicans are only going to
back moderates.

R-t Phi: If you win the nomination and election, do you
plan to go ahead in politics?

Colvin: Oh, I'd eventually return to teaching. You
know, I am the third straight generation of university
professors in my family. My father taught in many
places, including WAL, and my grandfather taught
almost forty years at Amherst. | suppose, that in some
way or another the university is my natural habitat.

1 am primarily entering this race for the purpose
of bringing these issues to the American public and
to defeat the Byrd machine. I'm not going there to
educate anybody, I'm going there to win. But I don't

An Alternative To Byrd

It is obvious to us that Sen. Byrd owes his office to the
power of his father’s name and the machine he created, and
he has used his position merely to espouse a political philoso-

phy that is no longer tenable, if it ever was.

But Prof. Colvin's opposition is not merely negative, as
his remarks above indicate. He seems to deal with the most
important problems in a manner at once creative, intelligent
and forthright, attributes which Sen. Byrd has been either
unable or unwilling to summon to aid him in his duties since

he took offic e.

Realizing that Prof. Colvin was not looking primarily for
an endorsement from the Ring-tum Phi when he announced
his intention to test public sentiment on his candidacy, we
nonetheless believe that Sen. Byrd has not been the man to
deal with the crucial problems Virginia faces, and that Prof,
Colvin's moderate stance seems to point the way to progress
for this state Therefore we encourage his candidac Vv and hope

that the voters of Virginia iwll do likewise.

foresee a career in politics, it doesn’t interest me. As
a matter of fact, I'm a Jeffersonian, and I happen to
believe that the Senator should only serve two terms,
and the Congressman only six terms,

R-t Phi: In an earlier interview you mentioned that
you were thinking of running and you wanted to gauge
the opinions of the constituency about your candidacy.
How would you do this?

Colvin: Well, this involves two things: First, | have to
show that I have enough support so that I will be taken
as a serious candidate. As you know, there are several
other people who have announced that they plan to
run against Senator Byrd. | do not think that that’s
an exhausted list, 1 expect other people to be making
announcements in the next few days, I have to demon-
strate to voters and potential voters that I am _ the
candidate to follow and that the others are NOT
candidates to follow.

Then the second part of the equation comes into
play. Only when I have momentum, only when I have
support, can I ask people to contribute money. Now,
this is a Campaign that is going to be very expensive,
even though I will do everything possible to keep the
expenses down. For this, we need money.

The support comes first, and hopefully the money
comes second. If I do not get the support, or the money,

then | shall not run. But | am assuming that I will
get the support; indeed, I've spent the last two days
talking to people across the state, telephone lines have
been constantly busy, letters have been coming in. I
thing there's no question but that there is a considerable
amount of support available.

Incidentally, and I say this with considerable pride,
support is coming from both sides of the line. | am
pleased and delighted with the number of Republicans
who say, “You can count on me all the way down
the line.” This is really quite cheering. Now, the money

. well, we'll have to wait a little bit.

R-t Phi: Where do you think your greatest support lies
among the voters?
Colvin: Well, | think I'm a candidate in search of sup-
port. | am hoping that I'll find it across the board, Or,
to put it another way, I do not concede any group, or
groups, to anyone else. | must concede Senator Byrd
HIS own group, but nobody else. This is another way
of saying that I seek support among the young people
in the state. | would seek support among the old people
who are worried about the rising cost of illness or
hospital care, because | have taken a position in favor
of some form of national health insurance, which would
alleviate something of that cost.

An Answer To
"Woodstock Revisited’

lo the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

The article in the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi titled “Nov. 15: Woodstock
Revisited” is a gross misrepresenta-
tion of the events during the March
on Washington, The article states
that the “biggest party since this
summer was held in Washington
over the weekend, and as usual
where parties are concerned, WAL
was well represented.”

Although some students, no doubt,
went up to see the Episcopal football
game and decided to drop in on the
March, it is utterly illogical to
judge the November 13-15 activities
from the point of view of the typi-
cally unconcerned, fun seeking WAL
student

The March was not party. If you
could have seen the determination
and solemnity on the faces of the
marchers (during both the March
Against Death and the Mass March),
you would know that the hundreds
of thousands were not there to have
fun. They were showing Mr. Nixon
that they want the U.S. to get out
of Vietnam. Now! Continued chants

support from thinking businessmen, but most of all,
1 would expect support from those who resent the
long domination of the Byrd family here in Virginia
and who seek to break out of it.

I am a moderate, and I think most Virginians are
moderates, When you ask where I'll get the support,
I'll go after it everywhere.

R-t Phi: You've mentioned briefly the young people.
Do you think being a college professor will help your
campaign?

Colvin: I think it will now. | think we can thank the
late Adlai Stevenson and John Kennedy for this. I
think that 10 or 15 years ago it would have been dis-
advantageous to be a university professor, but it is
advantageous today.

I think that people know now that a_ university
professor is not an egghead, that he is a man of prob-
lems, with plumbing and a house that needs fixing,
with children to educate, dogs to get licenses for; he’s
a human being, he’s not a strange, ivory-tower person.
Moreover, I think there’s an emphasis, and a_ proper
emphasis in this country on education today.

Many people I know are encouraging their sons and
daughters to go into the field of education. It is not
only a respectable profession, it is also an attractive
profession.

R-t Phi: How effective do you think student campaign-
ers were in the last gubernatorial race, and do you
plan to use them?

Colvin: | think that they were effective, but they could
be made much more effective. | hope to have stronger
student support than the candidates for governor got,
because the students are more concerned with national
issues. After all, in the last analysis, these students are
not as concerned with revenue issues in the state of
Virginia as with issues such as Vietnam, arms, or civil
rights, So that's part of the answer.

The other part is that | can probably create more
student support than either of the gubernatorial candi-
dates.

R-+t Phi: If Senator Byrd were to run again, how
effective do you think his political machine would be,
and do you think it would be sufficient to defeat a col-
lege professor?

Colvin: Well, there is no question that the Byrd ma-
chine is efficient. It's based upon a principle that is no
longer viable. This principle was, essentially, keeping
people away from the polls. When you had a small
turnout, a small but efficient organization could carry
the day. But now, you're having a large turnout; you
had almost 900 thousand people in the last election,
so that a small, efficent organization is not as good as
a BIG efficient organization.

Moreover, the senator is simply not the man that
his father was. His father was a titanic figure in Vir-
ginia politics. You didn’t have to agree with him, and
I come from a long line of people who did not, but
I think you have to recognize that his father was a
personality.

The senator is really a mediocre senator, without,
I think, any great personal following; I think that a
good deal of the following that he has is, essentially,
a legacy passed on to him by his father. We're talking
about two entirely different men when we talk about
Harry Byrd Jr, and Harry Byrd Sr. Moreover, he’s
five feet, six inches tall, and I’m six feet, and that’s
good six inch spread.

Rt- Phi: If you were elected, would you favor the
reduction of defense spending?

Colvin: Yes, | do favor the reduction, Now, let me
say something very bluntly on that. | do not minimize
the Soviet threat, or the Communist threat, and I
recognize that we cannot accomplish anything unless
we are secure from that threat, so I’m certainly not
talking about dismantling the armed services.

But I think that the defense budget is a bloated
budget. I think that in the Pentagon they take in each
other’s laundry, I think you could cut the defense
budget, not by the $2 billion which Sen. Byrd has
proposed, but a good, healthy cut would come in the
neighborhood of $12 billion.

R-t Phi: And this money, you feel, could be better
spent elsewhere?

Colvin: That's right. Cleaning up our cities, cleaning
up our rivers, making our air fit to breathe, providing
programs to train young men now idle because of
lack of skills, giving educational opportunities to those
who don’t have them; there's a host of things that
could be done with it.

R-t Phi: Since we brought up, a little earlier, the ques-
tion of student involvement in the campaign, how could
we help?

Colvin: Well, there are a lot of ways in which students
could help. I'm willing to talk to Young Republicans,
Young Democrats, Young Independents, anybody who's
willing to listen. Once these people have been talked
to, if they're willing to be a part of the campaign,
they can help by writing letters, they can talk to friends,
if they're not registered voters, they can talk to people
who are, they can work with student groups on other
campuses, they can collect money, any kind of money
they can get.

Let me be quite clear about that: as long as there
are no strings attached, I'll take money from anybody,
Somebody asked me the other day if I would take
money from out of state. I certainly would. As long
as there are no obligations on my part to a commit-
ment, I'll take as much as I can get.

I tend to think there is a feeling in Virginia that
we need a shift, we need a change, I think Holton
articulated that position very well, and I tend to think
that this movement is pretty much on a bipartisan path.
R-t Phi: Then, if the students accept this and go out
and work, how effective do you think they could be?
Colvin: I think they'd be enormously effective. They
could talk to people, they could persuade people. In
a sense, they would be messengers or forerunners. |
never underestimate them. I'd rather have students on
my side than any other group.

R-t Phi: Do you think there would be any problem with
older voters if students were employed in the campaign?
Colvin: Sure, there will be some people who resent it,
but I wouldn't worry about it. There's lots of things
that will happen; you're going to alienate people as
you go along. I think one of the things that you can’t
afford to do is to loose any sleep over, or even worry
about, things like that. If people are against you,
they're against you. We'll level with the people, we'll
talk sense, and we'll let them make their decision.

R-t Phi: When do you have to decide whether or not
you are going to run?

Colvin: T'll have to decide within thirty days at the
very latest. | need all the help | can get now, to build
up support, so that | can then really ron

R-t Phi: How does it look now?

Colvin: Well, people have been coming in all day long,
saying “Here's the good news, here's the bad news.”
We've had some setbacks, but in general it looks very
good, I've gotten responses across the state: from Bristol
to Winchester, and from Covington to the Washington
suburbs, So, f think it’s going, and it'll 20 quite well
To some degree, we don't know who else is in the
race, and we'll have to allow for that, but I'm not at
all disheartened by it

R-t Phi: When should the studenis get out and help?
Colvin: Right now. The time is today: as a matter of
fact, were late! What we need now is enthusiasm
unbridled, boundless enthusiasm—spred across the state.

Another Side of The
‘Newman-Shirk’ Debate

To the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi

lt takes a sophomore, Everett

liberty and happiness while being
cute, sarcastic, and sophomoronish

Regardless of all subterfuge
“dress” and “speak” at WAL which
have rapidly degenerated to ugh!
should be reinstated for these rea
sons: (1) they are manifestations of

discipline, especially self-discipline,
(2) they look a helluva lot better
to everybody than the opposite, and
alumni and friends are going to con
tribute more money when things
look better than they do now, and
(3) they are educational—vyes, Fy
erett Newman, ‘72, there is more
to education than you will get from
academic subjects

Looking sloppy and nol speaking
are certainly not being different. I:

excuse for not doing it is

Swim Team Shows Promise

Yesterday afternoon, the Generals’
natators faced their first preliminary

test of the year. They swam _ the
VMI Keydets in a “scrimmage.”
Coach Stearns said that he was

“well pleased with the performances,
his is the best we've done this early
in the season.”

Fomorrow afternoon at 2:30 p.m
the Generals face in their home pool
the Briarwood Raquet and Paddle

Club’s swimming team in another
“scrimmage.” The Briarwood club is
one of the top AAU swimming

teams in the Virginia area and is
coached by Norris Eastman, Coach
Stearns’s predecessor at the helm of
the W&L team

There is no score kept in these

swimming scrimmages and there is
no official time. Coach Stearns has
made the VMI scrimmage a regular
seasonal event. Any number of
swimmers can participate in a given
event, and furthermore, this is the
first time during the year that the
Generals are able to swim in a 25
yard pool,

There were several exceptional
times registered at the VMI scrim-
mage. Sophomore Bim Clark swam
a 100 yard dolphin butterfly with
a split time of 56.3 seconds. Bill
Brumback registered a 23.0 seconds
and 52.3 seconds in the 50 and 100
yard events. These equal the times
he was setting very late in the sea-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Speaking My Mind

The Springfield Road

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

You're sitting back in your seat
on the bus. For good reason the
ride home from Springfield, Mass.
and its NCAA tournament seems
much longer and lonelier than the
journey north two days before,
brimming with enthusiasm, anticipa-
tion, and hope. It will be reported
that your boys were outscored 18-0
over the weekend. Too bad. It was a
better season than that.

It started back in early September.
You knew that the team was full of
gaping holes, especially in the line.
Ten players had been lost from last
year’s squad due to graduation and
other academic reasons. In addition
the freshmen team had not been
good the previous year, leaving you
only one place to find the bulk of
your new team, this year’s incoming
freshmen. Thus Meade Kampfmuel-
ler, Brandon Herbert, and Hank
Slauson, looking very good in prac-
tice were quickly inserted into key
positions on the starting team.

You could not be extremely op-
timistic when the season started. In-
experience was the main ingredient
working against your expectations.

But the Blues rallied in the first
game to whip Pfeiffer 4-2, and in the
following week lambasted both
Hampden-Sydney and Madison. The
freshmen were coming through in
great style, the fullbacks had _ be-
come a hardnosed, aggressive unit,
and halfback Carl Hyatt was doing
everything, scoring goals and play-
ing good defense. You actually had
a good team on your hands.

But Virginia beat the Generals.
Defeat was sudden and maybe lucky;
however, you could not allow the
team to let up, for powerful Lynch-
burg was only three days away.
Goalie Ken Newman pulled the team
through that one, making many ex-
cellent saves. A tie was welcome
after having been thoroughly out-
played.

The road to Springfield was paved
for the Blues, though, in the next
game, against Roanoke. You came
out on top, beating the state champs!
It was the turning point of the sea-
son,

The team seemingly could do no
wrong now. They trounced a strugg-
ling VMI, 4-0. Against Eastern Men-
nonite John Yow put in a last sec-

3rd against tough Eastern Mennon-
ite, 4th against Bridgewater, Sth
against Roanoke and Old Dominion
in a tri-meet, and Sth against Cen-
tre. In the College Athletic Confer-
ence Meet, Wilkinson placed 7th;
he finished 42nd in a field of 115 in
the state meet, the top spot for a
General runner this year.

Sherwood surprised many by plac-
ing first against Lynchburg. He fol-
lowed with a Sth place finish versus
Eastern Mennonite, 6th against
Bridgewater, 4th against Roanoke
and Old Dominion, and 3rd against
Centre.

Washington and Lee opened the
season with a 24-35 victory over
Lynchburg. In the tri-meet, the Gen-
erals lost to Roanoke 41-40 but de-
feated Old Dominion 41-42. Wash-
ington and Lee then dropped three
decisons, to Centre 31-24, Eastern
Mennonite 33-22 and Bridgewater
42-18. The Generals added their
third victory with a 15-50 forfeit
victory over Fairmont. In CAC com-
petition, the Blue Harriers tied for
third place with Southwestern. Each
had 91 points in a meet won by
Washington University of St. Louis.

The State Meet was held this year
at Washington and Lee. In accord-
ance with State rules, the course was
lengthened to five miles. The Gen-
erals finished ninth with 240 points
in the twelve team field.

a good one, despite his lack of size
(he’s 5-10 and 180 pounds). At the
beginning of this season W&L head
Coach Graham (Buck) Leslie said
Ogilvie “could be one of the finest
guards W&L ever had.”

Kumpuris is also light (170, 6-0)
for the position he plays, defensive
linebacker, but his quickness makes
up for it. During W&L’s nine-game
season he was credited with 57 indi-
vidual tackles and 26 assists, an
average of more than nine a game.

For both boys it is the completion

of a “brother act.” Ogilvie’s older
brother, Buck, was captain of the
1963 W&L football team. Drew

Kumpuris’s brother, Dean, was cap-
tain of the 1969 squad.

Kumpuris is a biology major from
Little Rock, Ark. He is an honor
roll and dean’s list student and ac-
tive in a number of campus activi-
ties, including serving as sports edi-
tor of the yearbook,

Ogilvie, a commerce major from
Shreveport, La., ranks 19th aca-
demically in his class of 280. He is
a dean’s list student and has served
for two years as an elected member
of the student government executive
committee.

Basie bows out
of Fancy Dress
Ball engagement

CHECK-UP NEEDED

Friends of Distinction or
Sweet Water for concert

Much like Sisyphus whose rock
kept rolling down the hill when it
reached the apex, the Dance Board
has had another setback, not how-
ever caused by their own sins.

Bob Kasha of Willard Alexander,
Inc., contacted the Dance Board this
past week, announcing that Count
Basie and his orchestra will be un-
able to appear on Friday, January
31, of Fancy Dress. The announce-
ment came as a total surprise to
the Board which had received a
verbal commitment from the Count
himself.

The reason for the Count’s in-
ability to appear stems from his
doctor's ordering him to have a
routine medical examination during
the time period of January 23
through February 5. This immedi-
ately eliminated the WA&L date
which the band-leader had let slip
his mind. So, once again the Dance
Board falls prey to another enter-
tainment group canceling out on
the school.

The saddest part of the entire
mix-up is that the Dance Board
will receive the brunt of the critic-
ism caused by the Count’s cancela-
tion. This year the Dance Board
has done everything in its power to
provide Washington and Lee with
the best entertainment which its
budget can afford. It is unfortunate
that such a blot on its record should
be made. not through any fault of
its own, but rather that of others.

Other orchestras are now being
considered by the Board in order
to replace Basie, but the time is
drawing very close to Fancy Dress.
The Glenn Miller Orchestra, di-
rected by Buddy DeFranco, has been
highly recommended and may re-
ceive the bid for the January dance
set. However, it is only speculation
at this time

On Saturday night either the
Friends of Distinction or Sweet
Water will entertain. The choice for
this night hinges on whether the
Sweet Water, a California group,
will be on the East coast during
January. Otherwise, the Friends of
Distinction, known best for their
hit single “Grazing in the Grass,”
will appear for the concert.

Cancer in concert tonight
for College Inn audience

Cancer is both a disease and an
astrological sign, but at WAL it
is the name of a progressive rock
group. Its members are Gordon
Beall, bass; Mac Bogert, vocal; Clay
Hemphill, organ and vocal; Peter
Homans, lead guitar; Ray Royce,
vocal; and Harry Salzberg, drums.

So far this year the group has
been arranging songs written by
other rock groups, such as the Jef-
ferson Airplane, the Who, the
Beatles, and Santana. Recently, they
have started work on original ma-
terial and eventually hope to have
enough songs to record.

This material reflects the import-
ant influence of a certain group
on all the guys in the band. “Procul
Harum,” a British rock group who
are Classically trained, have indi-
cated to Cancer the need to write
music from an intellectual as well
as emotional point of view. “We
would like to think that the response
to our sound is as challenging in-
tellectually as it is poignant,” Beall
said.

In reference to the band’s pur-
pose, Mac Bogert says, “Our am-
bition is not to make money, but
to become musicians.” For this rea-

IFC debating popular election
of president and vice-president

At last night's IFC meeting a
motion was introduced to allow for
the popular election of the IFC
president and vice-president. The
motion was referred to committee.

The motion, drawn up by Jim
Matthews and Reeve Kelsey, pro-
vided for the election of the presi-
dent and vice-president by all fra-
ternity members in a method similar
to that of the Student Body Presi-
dent. The election of the remaining
Judicial Board would remain un-
changed. The present system for the
election of the IFC president has
the nomination of the candidates
one week, and the election the next
week with each fraternity having
one vote.

Several of the reasons advanced
for the change included the hope
that a popularly elected president
could give the IFC better prestige
and leadership with a mandate from
at least half of the fraternity mem-
bers. Also cited would be the in-
creased articulation of issues, the
introduction of fresh blood into the
IFC, and a reduction in the oli-
garchical tendencies of the present
system.

Several members expressed res-
ervations on the proposed amend-
ment. They felt that since the issue
was now opened if would be best

for the IFC to consider all pos-
sible alternatives to the present
selection method and then choose
the best alternative. The motion

was referred to a committee (by a
17-0 vote) for just this reason. Presi-
dent Chuck Cahn will name a com-
mittee to work on this matter.

In other action, Cahn urged fra-
ternities to give some sort of com-
pensation for the responsibilities of
their officers and their obligation to
live in the house. He suggested free
room and perhaps a reduction in
board.

The resolution presented by the
IFC follows:

Washington and Lee has a movie
program at last, owing primarily to
the efforts of a pair of freshmen:
Bill Millkey and Bob Lang. The
idea for such a program began last
year. It was noted by the Executive
Committee that W&L had no pro-
gram of any kind for the showing
of feature films. Supporters of the
program pointed out that many other
schools already have such programs
offering free movies to students on
Saturday nights. So much interest
was generated in the program that
finally arrangements were made to
add a dollar to each student's dues
to cover the cost of the films. Acting
upon last year's initiatives, the EC
formed a committee this fall to
organize the film program and sup
ervise its functioning. Millkey and
Lang were chosen as co-chairmen

To date, the committee has had
no trouble in financing the movies
it is showing, but student interest
is lacking. Because they are new to
the operation of such a program,
Millkey and Lang have had some
difficulty in learning to operate it
efficiently. Adding to their problems
is the lack of any previous pro
gram upon which they might model
their own efforts. They claim that
student co-operation and assistance
would go along way toward a bet
ter film program. They note
that such popular movies as “Murd

Faculty voting on exchange
program in Dec. 1 meeting

This coming Monday the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty will meet
for the purpose of deciding the fate
of the proposed eight-college stu-
dent exchange program. Contrary to
popular opinion, W&L has not as
yet approved the program, and
neither have all the other schools
involved. December | will be the
day of decision for W&L.

The idea for such a program has
been present for a long time, but
specific action wasn't taken until last
February when the Presidents of
four women's colleges and four
men's colleges began meeting to dis-
cuss the feasibility of an exchange
program. The final guidelines for
the program were decided this past
July when the eight Presidents met
for three days at the Peaks of Otter
Lodge.

The plan which finally emerged
is more than an experiment in co-
education. It provides for exchanges
between men’s colleges and women’s
colleges themselves. Thus it seeks
both to diversify the individual cam-
puses and to expand the educational
offerings of each school, If the fac-
ulty passes the program as well as
all seven other colleges, WAL stu-
dents will be able to enroll for
their junior years at either Mary
Baldwin, Hollins, Randolph-Macon
Woman's College. Sweet Briar.
Davidson, Hampden-Sydney, or
Randolph-Macon.

Unfortunately, the program would
be limited to only thirty students.
In return W&L would take in thirty

exchange students. The number
could be less than thirty, but not
more.

At the end of the first vear the

program will be subject to review
by all eight colleges. At that time
it might be decided to abandon the
program, expand it, or modify it
in some ways, Each participating
school will be permitted to with-
draw if it so chooses,

Students enrolled in the exchange
program will be considered enroll-
ed at their home institution. By
that reasoning, the student pays his
normal tuition and fees along with
room and board payments to the
home school. The home institution
will then remit this to the host
school unless the tuition, fees and
other expenses of the host school

are less, in which cases those charges
will be paid.

Full credit will be given for all
the courses taken by exchange stu-
dents. These credits will be ac-
cepted at face value by the home
institution, but each student's pro-
gram must be approved by the home
school. All grades received at the
host school will be considered the
grades of record.

Most interesting, however, are the
rules concerning social regulations.
Both the academic and the other
(social) “regulations of the host
institution shall ordinarily apply to
a student under this program.” Thus
it is not inconceivable that a W&l
student at Hollins would have to

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, November 25, 1969

To clarify an issue

Our more diligent readers must certainly be following
the one-shot-at-a-time war which has been raging in the
Letters to the Editor columns for the past month. This ex-
change of barbs began with a mild-toned unobtrusive plea
by “an alumnus and father” for W&L men to “have the
courage to continue to be different.”

Since that letter appeared, the issue involved—the value
of tradition at Washington and Lee—unfortunately has been
relegated to a status secondary to sarcasm on the part of sev-
eral students and alumni. Perhaps this is inevitable in debating
an abstruse point when all the arguments advanced are ap-
parently valid but too closely intertwined with emotion.
Nevertheless, somewhere beneath that murky mess of slung-
mud there lies a viable conclusion. To assist in the search for
that answer, we shall attempt to expurgate the issues and
incinerate the refuse which has accumulated,

The central question is whether or not a coat-and-tie,
etc. pertain to education. None of the antagonists or pro-
tagonists—whoever is which should be irrelevant—have de-
fined exactly what they mean by “education.” In the strict
literal sense, “education” is mental development gained from
instruction. Then how could a coat-and-tie aid the educational
process? But, how could it hinder?

This impasse can be averted without sacrificing accuracy,
since “education”? connotes much more, and rightly so, than
mental development. To name just two, moral development
and discipline—we do not absorb knowledge osmotically—
are certainly elements integral to an education. Surely no
intelligent person can believe that wearing a coat-and-tie
ipso facto indicates self-discipline. However, using the same
logic, just because someone dresses otherwise does not mean
that he lacks discipline. The non-conventional dresser can
possibly and simply utilize other standards of value, which
is fine. Of course, there are noticeable exceptions.

But would coercion be more successful? Forcing a lazy
student to tie a tie would not help him learn discipline or
anything.

Again, the issue devolves into a riddle. But, there is one
other consideration—“dignity” as the alumnus and father
wrote. Whether or not this is relevant to education is another
academic question. However, “dignity” does significantly
pertain to environment. A well-dressed person simply is more
appealing, and that is important.

We, students and alumni, should concentrate on proving
the importance of being a gentleman, not on name-calling
or trying to solve the insoluble problem of gauging the rela-
tion of dress to education. We should ask what value will
an education—strictly or loosely defined—have to someone
who operates at a disadvantage in his society? An attitude of
tolerant understanding, and then advice, is demanded; not
Mr. Gilmore’s (class of 1939) cry for blind removal of “any
such crud” from the University.

“Alumni arise, thumbs up, strike back,” writes Mr. Gil-
more. But help; set some examples; show the wisdom of
what you know; and “don’t criticize what you can’t under-
stand,”

 

One step closer

Last week we discussed the needs of the University in
the area of providing opportunities for foreign study to
students. We are delighted to hear that a positive plan is
being considered for possible implementation as early as
next year.

Professor David B. Dickens, chairman of the Foreign
Study Committee, announced that a questionnaire has been
circulated to freshmen and sophomores. The questionnaire
solicits information that will aid the committee in establish-
ing opportunities for study in Europe.

The most attractive feature of the proposed program is
its scheduling of study abroad during the short term if
possible. This seems to be the most effective use of the new
six-week term yet proposed, and we urge that the proposal
receive the consideration it deserves.

 

 

Toward a better system

The Student Curriculum Committee has also recently
directed its efforts in strengthening a weak area. On No-
vember 13 the committee submitted to its faculty counterpart
a report which recommends the overhauling of the fresh-
man advisory system.

This archaic system should definitely be revamped. In-
stead of finding an ally in their advisers, many freshmen fre-
quently regard them as aloof, inconsiderate, and in general
someone to be feared. This reality is hardly in alignment
with the desired effect, the accessibility of professors out-
side the classroom. A friend on the hill is always welcomed,
and the creation of such relationships could be greatly faci-

litated under the proposed system.
We would like to join the Student Curriculum Com-
mittee in encouraging the faculty group to conscientiously

weigh the merits of the proposal,

We wish to call your attention to
what we consider an unjust act on
the part of the administration con-
cerning the married students hous-

Starting next year our rent will
be increased to $50 a month utilities
included. From the outside, this may
seem fair, but to the tenant, speci-
fically of “Hillside Terrace,” it is
an outrage! The following descrip-
tion is bearly tolerable at $38 a

he has to work with. The three

is no insulation.

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

It is ridiculous that so much time
and emotion should be spent on
matters of personal taste. Washing-
ton and Lee has many more im-
portant topics to be discussed, such
as the size of our institution, proper
utilization of the six-week term, and
even the nature of education itself,
Nonetheless, | feel obligated to reply
to Mr, Gilmore's philippic, lest. sil-
ence be taken for approval or defeat.

First, | apologize to him for be-
ing “cute, sarcastic, and sophomoro-
nish.” My only hope is that when
I grow up I shall be able to write
sober rational responses like Mr.
Gilmore's. Knowing my limitations,
I will now try to work them into
my reply. °

Mr. Gilmore says “dress” and
“speak” are manifestations of self-
discipline. Later in his letter he
states that he would exclude “any
hot-shot from Lower Slobbovia High
School (who) doesn’t like it.” Realiz-
ing my intellectual limitations, I still
hesitantly venture the opinion that
this exclusion is discipline from with-
out rather than within. As long as
arbitrary standards are imposed, the
individual has no opportunity to ex-
hibit discipline, only adherence to
the fear of expulsion.

He says it looks better and he
fails to see how proper dress and
polite speech interfere with educa-
tion. He also states more money
comes from alumni and friends if
we look pretty. I agree that it looks
better; I wear a suit-and-tie every
chance I get. Simply because we
agree on this doesn’t make either
one of us the Almighty Arbitrator
of good taste.

Secondly, if what the alumni and

Parietal rules elsewhere

By REEVE KELSEY

In the midst of the discussion con-
cerning parietal regulation at Wash-
ington and Lee, the Ring-tum Phi
decided to survey the parietal and
social regulations of several neigh-
boring schools and schools of simi-
lar nature. We received responses
from Yale University, the Univer-
sity of Virginia, Hollins College,
and Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege. :

The University of Virginia pre-
sents perhaps the closest parallel
with W&L, having both dormitory
and fraternity living facilities. The
U.Va. regulations for the freshman
dorms are:

Hours:

Friday, 4:00 p.m.-3:00 a.m.
Saturday, 1:00 p.m.-3:00 a.m.
Sunday 1:00 p.m.-8:00 p.m.
Weekdays—No hours

The regulations for the fraternity
houses were changed this fall and
the regulations in effect now are:

Hours:

24 hours at the discretion of
of each house.

The enforcement provisions call for
the enforcement by the house officers
and the Interfraternity Council with
jurisdiction over the regulations in
the hands of the Interfraternity
Council. However, the regulations
also state, “Actual occupancy of a
room overnight by a member of the
Opposite sex is not permitted under
any circumstances. This is a viola-
tion of the Terms and Conditions
and applies to all housing areas oc-
cupied by single students,

Yale University presents similar
regulations for students living in the
dormitories. The regulations state:

Agnew-backer fires reply

By DOUG HAMILTON

Laurence Hilliard’s column in
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi criticiz-
ing Vice President Agnew exempli-
fied the point the Vice President
was trying to make in his much
debated T.V. news medium speech.
Agnew stated that the news media
has the power of selecting which
news stories appear before the pub-
lic, and thus exercise a great deal
of power over the minds of those
watching the news reports. He
wondered if the personal prejudices
of some of these newsmen weren't
reflected in which events they re-
port, and how much of that event
is to be shown to the viewer.

In his article. it was obvious that
Mr. Hilliard does not like Vice
President Agnew. He took several
of Agnew's “newsworthy” quotations
and presented them. The only prob-
lem was that in an effort to dis-
credit the Vice President, he took
Agnew's remarks out of context,
Stated Mr. Hilliard: “When Spiro
made his notorious remarks during
the campaign about ‘that fat Jap.’
and ‘if you've seen one slum, you've
seen them all people just laughed.”
In reference to “that fat Jap.” Agnew
said this on his private plane to a
good friend in much the same
manner as we might jokingly call

one of our friends, “a lazy hill-
billy.”

Mr. Agnew's actual complete
statement on slums was: “If you've

seen one slum, you've <cen them
all: each is as bad as the other.”
But the difference between Mr. Hil
liard’s form of “yellow” journalism
and the news we swe on TV. is
that one is found on an editorial
page. and the other is presented as
unbiased fact.

Another of the Vice President's
Matemenis that Mr. Hilliard dix
agreed with was that regarding tele
vision commeniating after President
ial speeches. Agnew felt that “the
people of this couniry have the right

to make up their own minds and
form their own opinion about a
Presidential address without having
the President's words and thoughts
characterized through the prejudices
of hostile critics before they can
even be digested.”

After Nixon's Viet Nam speech,
and after practically every “speech
the President has made, | have noted
an immediate rebuttal on the part
of the commentators: an instantan-
eous “anti” voice. And Mr. Hilliard
says, “Apparently the Vice Presideni
does not realize that the Federal
Communications Commission Fair-
ness Doctrine dictates that television
must give air time to all political
philosophies.” It appears to me that
the Vice President “apparently”
does realize this, when, like myself,
he sees only one sided commentary

There is also the question of how
much of the commentator’s opinions
are made up before the speech
they are remarking on is given. For
imstance, it was obvious that Averill
Harriman was sure of what he was
going to say beforehand. Mr. Harri
man has been a critic of Nixon's
Viet Nam policy since it began
So why. I ask Mr. Hilliard, do you
say the Vice President is “creatine
a pomonous air of McCarthyism in
the United States,” when all he seeks
is More objective and representative
ews reporting and commentating?

Or do Agnew’'s critics fear gov-
ernment censorship of the press? If
they have read his speech, they will
see that this is not the case. Said
the Vice President. “I am not ask
img for government censorship or
any other kind of censorship
This is one case where the people
must defend themselves. where the
cilizen——not governmenit—must be
the reformer. where the consumer
can be the most effective crusader’

fo avoid becoming paranoiac,
critics of the Vice President should
listen to his words. instead of listen

present in students’ rooms during the
following hours: Sunday-Thursday-

10:00 a.m.-12 midnight: Friday and
Saturday—10:00 a.m.-2 a.m.

It is informative to note that the
superceded regulations at the Uni-
versity of Virginia allowed daily
visitation in the fraternity houses
from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.

The visitation hours for Randoiph-
Macon are, needless to say, more
restricted than those of the former
two schools mentioned. The regula-
tions state: “Male guests will be al
lowed in the student dormitory
rooms from 1:00 p.m. until 9:00
p.m. on Saturday. The rules con-
cerning overnights in either Lexing-
ton or Charlottesville require the stu-
dent to “dismiss her date and be in
by 3:00 a.m. and not go out until
after 6:00 a.m.” The final regula-
tion in this section states that “Every
Randolph-Macon student is expected
to conduct herself in a manner
appropriate to the high standards of
the college. Any student whose be-
havior brings criticism upon herself
or the college will be subject to dis-
ciplinary action by Hall President's
Council and/or the Judiciary Com-
mittee.”

Hollins College does not allow

any visitation in the dormitory
rooms and the regulations concern-
ing visitation to Lexingion are: “Stu-
dents must be in by 3:00 a.m.
In determining where a student may
stay in these areas, she is to con-
sider the following two things: (1)
An agreement reached between the
student and her parents. (2) That
each student has an obligation io
maintain the reputation of the Col
lege.”

In summary, there is not too
much difference between the dormi
tory regulations of the two men’s
schools surveyed and those of Wash
ington and Lee, although the U.Va
fraternity regulations are consider
abl more relaxed from those of
WAL. Of the neighboring women’s
schools, both Randolph-Macon and
Hollins have similar rules

While I agree with Mr. Gilmore,
39 (re: Friday Ring-tum Phi, No-
vember 21) in his advocation of the
speaking and dress traditions at
Washington and Lee, | regret that
an overzealous attitude has distorted
his perception. His final vision of
a vengeful alumni association rising
up to smite the University is some-
what disconcerting—and even fright-
ening if one stereotypes alumni as
Mr. Gilmore does students.

It is my “sophomoronish” opinion
that anyone who dares call W&L
“a school of slobs in 1969" deserves
to be strung up by his proverbial
necktie! I only pray that countless
friends of the University would
agree.

Agnew attacks
to include Phi?
It can happen!

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Don't be surprised if Spiro T,
Agnew steps up to a podium in
Tallahassee, Fla. or Lincoln, Neb.
or some other hiding place of the
“Silent Majority” and commences to
denounce the Ring-tum Phi for print-
ing my column last week criticizing
the Vice President's denunciation of
television coverage.

The Washington Post and the New
York Times denounced the Vice
President editorially—and became
the targets of Agnew’s most recent
verbal outburst. Speaking before the
Alabama Chamber of Commerce in
Monigomery, Agnew criticized the
Washington Post Company as an
example of a trend toward mono-
polization and questioned the news
jtdgment of the New York Times.

Phe Vice President said “A single
company in the nation’s capital holds
control of the largest Newspaper in
Washington, D.C. and one of the
four major television stations, and
an all-news radio station, and one
of the three major news magazines

all grinding out the same editorial
line.”

To say that this represents a news
monopoly for the Washington Post
Company is ridiculous. There are
three daily newspapers, four tele-
vision stations, and thirty-seven
radio stations in Washington, D.C.
One of the other newspapers, the
Washington Star, also owns a tele-
vision station and two radio stations.
Why then did the Vice President
single out the Bost for criticism?
Because the Post has been critical
of the Nixon Administration. It's
part of Agnew’s attempts to silence
criticism.

According to the Vice President's
criteria, there are many other cities
in which one company holds a near
monopoly on news. Richmond News-
Papers, Inc.. for instance, owns both
newspapers and a radio station in
Virginia's capital. But since the edi-
torial pages of the Richmond news-
papers have become a propaganda
machine for the Nixon Administra-
tion, you will hear no criticism of
them from the Vice President.

Agnew also said “...f am not
recommending the dismemberment
of the Washington Post Company.”

But that is exactly the threat he
is fying to construe to the com-
pany. The Federal Communications

Commission has the power to lift
the company's license io WTOP-TV
and WTOP Radio, and Agnew wants
the company to realize that the new
Chairman of the FCC, arch-con
sefvative Dean Burch, is a Nixon
appointee
Besmirch the company’s repula
ton Before the public then hit it

President's way of doing things

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Players of the Year

Football

By MIKE BERRY

On every football team in this
football-conscious country, there is
an individual who stands out above
all. That player is the team quarter-
back. He is the man who is booed
and cheered, the man who is prais-
ed and condemned. He has to be
a leader, a runner, a passer, a tactic-
ian, and a public relations agent. If
he fails at his job, the whole team
may find themselves wishing that
they had stayed in the locker room.
I think it is plain to see the value
of the quarterback; and this year
WAL was lucky enough to have a
fine quarterback in senior Chuck
Kuhn. Chuck’s value has been cited
by the coaches and Chuck, as a re-
sult, has been chosen the W&L
Player of the Year.

Chuck has proven himself to be
an inspirational and effective leader.
He moved a young W&L team to
several important and gratifying vic-
tories and nearly engineered a couple
of upsets. Chuck was as a constant
threat at quarterback because of his
ability to execute the pass-run op-
tion. His rollout tactics accounted for
1107 yards and 13 touchdowns. This
past season Chuck threw 163 times,
completing 71 for 924 yards and 10
touchdowns. He rushed for 183
yards more and carried the ball over
the golden stripe three times, These
figures were good enough to find
Chuck leading the CAC at season’s
end.

A man who knows enough about
football to be a considerable author-
ity, Coach Buck Leslie. revealed his
opinion of Kuhn very enthusiastic-
ally. “Chuck is an excellent com-
petitor. He has good leadership as
was shown by his successful calling
of plays. He possessed a ‘quick feel
of the opponents’ defense and could
play when he was hurt. I just wish
we had him back another year.”

Cross-country

By TOM ROWE

Junior Bill Wilkinson, running
competitively for the first time in
his life, has been chosen as_ the
fuesday Ring-tum Phi’s Runner of
the Year in cross country, Although
Wilkinson’s reaction to the news was
one of surprise, the award was well
deserved as he finished first for
W&L in the Generals’ last four
meets of the year.

Until this fall, Wilkinson was un-
tested in competition. He came out
for the team only at the urging
of his friend, team co-captain Paul
Wilbur. During the early part of
the season, Bob Sherwood paced the
Generals in their meets while Wilk-
inson developed his style and finish-
ed further back. However, his low-
est finish for W&L for the entire
season (and his career) was merely
fourth, He led the Generals for the
first time in the meet with Bridge-
water, and after that no General
could catch him.

This year figured to be a learn-
ing year for Wilkinson, so his suc-
cess was icing on the cake. The fact
that Wilkinson learned to run on
hills will help him next year even
more, since experience is important
on a mountain course. Although
Wilkinson hopes for the sake of the
team that he will have more chal-
lengers for first place on the team
next year, it would be quite an
achievement for him to win the
Player award again. He has the
ability and desire to do it,

Bill was a unanamous choice of
all those contacted on the cross-
country team. His improvement was
undoubtably his biggest strength this
fall. With a handful of first places
as a junior there seems to be no
limits on Bill's future as a senior.

Considering desire he exhibited
this season, next fall should be good.

Soccer

By JOHN ROBINSON

From the N.C.A.A. play-off soccer
team the Player of the Year is Carl

Hyatt. Coming from Huntington,
Long Island, Carl has been involved
in soccer most of his life. At W&L
he is a junior and a brother of
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Playing left halfback Carl boomed
in five goals this fall, an unusually
high total for a man who plays
mid-field. Ever since his freshman
year he was in the starting line-up
for Washington and Lee. In that
freshman year he gained All-State
honors. Once again he is a candi-
date for All-State.

This season Carl has brought
needed stability in the middle of the
field where games are customarily
won or lost. A highly skilled ball-
handler, Hyatt has played in spite
of numerous injuries. Small but co-
ordinated, he has learned how to
read the field well. All these points
led the team to choose Carl Hyatt
as co-captain for next year

The highest praise of all for half-
back Hyatt came from his coach,
Joe Lyles. Lyles summed it up this
way: “As a junior Carl worked
tremendously hard on the practice
field and in games. His hustle has
always been excellent. Some of his
biggest improvements were learning
the game as tactician and increas-
ing his confidence. Cari Hyatt is
simply an outstanding person on and
off the field.”

A quiet boy, Carl Hyatt has done
his job well for three years now
with nary a complaint. His friendly
manner has made him a_ student
widely respected at Washington and
Lee. Next year Carl has hopes of
leading his team back to the
N.C.A.A,

Lacrosse Fall Practice
is success, states Szlasa

By JOHN ROBINSON

Last week was the beginning of
the 1970 lacrosse season. November
may seem a little out of season for
the stickmen, but W&L’s squad was
out in force for Fall Practice. The
week-long session saw a_ turn-out
of 44 boys of which 15 were fresh-
men hopefuls. On the final day a
scrimmage was fought out against
neighboring V.M.I.

Coach Szlasa was pleased by his
team especially on three points. His
starters have improved en masse
since last June. Many have been in
summer leagues or worked out on
their own. Also many of the players
from the jayvee team have shown
amazing promise. The last encour-
agement to Coach Szlasa was his
freshmen. Despite the fact some of
the better freshmen were in winter
sports, a troop of talented freshmen
impressed even the regulars.

Everyone agreed that the attitude
during the week was tremendous.
Competition for the starting spots
is exteremely keen. Some of the
older men were reacting well to
being pressured for their posts.

Ihe scheduling is nearly complete
for this spring. At present the op-
ponents number 11 but that figure
may be boosted to a dozen, Over
half the games will be at home as
contrasted to only a pair of home
stands last year. Some of the op-
ponents include: Duke, U.N.C.,
Washington College, Villanova, and
the University of Maryland of Balti-
more County. Pre-season scrimmages
will be slugged out with tough Penn-
sylvania and Yale.

Co-captains are Jay Meriweather
and Ned Coslett, each an outstand-
ing player and leader. With person-
nel like this the key word is im-
provement this spring at Wilson
Field.

would be very harmful to intellect-

WAL would turn into the vacuous

Mr. Gilmore says WAL is now a

of wunimpassioned examination).

Objective press is
subject for paper

A paper by a Washington and
Lee University professor urging the
world’s journalists to be more ques-
tioning and critical, when neces-
sary, of their nation’s policies and
institutions has been translated into
a Spanish language booklet in
Madrid.

The paper was written by Journ-
alism Prof. O. W. Riegel, retired
head of the Department of Journ-
alism and Communications at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Riegel originally delivered the
paper last year at a symposium on
“Mass Media and _ International
Understanding” held at Ljubljana,
Yugoslavia, The proceedings of the
conference were subsequently pub-
lished this year by the Department
of Journalism at the School of
Sociology, Political Science and
Journalism in Ljubljana,

In the paper, entitled “National-
ism and Communications,” Riegel
makes reference to “the generally
subordinate, parochial, and rein-
forcing role of the world’s public
media.”

“They are in every country the
supporters and servants of the na-
tional state, not its adversaries. They
follow rather than lead. They did
not invent the national state sys-
tem. They do not explain it or
challenge it. Day after day they
present a simplistic, ethnocentric
image of the world in which ‘we’
are the deserving center. The na-
tion’s idiosyncratic traditions and
values are the standards by which
the image of the world is presented
and judged,” Riegel said.

If Agnew doubts the prestige of

three opinion polls taken a few years
ago. In separate polls, 335 editors,
311 publishers, and 125 journalism
professors were asked to rank the
nation’s daily newspapers. In each
poll, the New York Times was
selected as the top newspaper. (The

experts in the field of journalism
rank the Times as the nation’s out-

in the habit of slanting the news?
Even an idiot should be able to
answer that question.

So don't be surprised when the

“LT grant exceptions, although
these exceptions frequently turn out
to be, upon close inspection, more
apparent than real,” he added, “A
general principle is that the larger
the nation’s power, and the more
substantial the investments of the
public media, the more solicitous
the public media will be to preserve
national institutions, defend national
policies, support ‘law and order,’
and oppose change (‘rocking the
boat’). The greater the magnitude
of power and the larger the popula-
tion, the more dependent govern-
ments are upon psychological mani-
pulation to assure unity and order,
and the more dependent govern-
ments are upon the public media
to channel attention and win a con-
sensus of consent.”

In conclusion, Riegel wrote: “I
am asking professional journalists to
recognize their own professional
principles. I call upon journalists to
honor these principles in deed as
well as in rhetoric by telling the
truth, and not only part of the
truth but all of the truth.”

“Journalists may not be able to
initiate, change, or control the act-
ions of government and the conse-
quences of such actions, but they
have a professional duty to report
them. Men do not understand their
own environment and are helpless to
control it when the public media
fail to describe and illuminate the
mechanisms of political power and
the inner self-destructive compuls-
ions of the national power system.”

our basic approach: that of placing
responsibility on the student to do
his work and to satisfy his instruc
tors that he was doing so.”

Amherst has placed the deter-
mination of attendance policy on the
individual instructors, as does Wil-
liams College. Only one of the six
schools contacted did not reply. All
others had less restrictive policies.

This contrasts with W&L, where
only 32 faculty members responded
to Millkey’s independent survey. Of
those who did so, some wrote notes
such as “Confused and ambiguous.’
“What do vou mean?” and so
forth, and did not answer the ques-
lions.

Several brought out the idea of a
enforcement of a pen

Proposed W&L Student

Exchange Programs Are

Approved By F aculty

Washington and Lee’s faculty has
endorsed the proposed cight-col-
lege student exchange program.

Action came at a faculty meet-
ing Monday. The proposal must
now go before a meeting of the
University’s Board of Trustees on
January | for final consideration
and action,

The colleges which would be in-
volved in the student exchange
would be Davidson, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin, Ran-
dolph - Macon, Randolph - Macon
Woman's College, Sweet Briar, and
Washington and Lee.

Basic principles approved by the
faculty for the program include:

|. The student exchange program
will be conducted for the mutual
benefit of the eight participating
colleges and their students, The
program is experimental in nature,
and is subject to review, modifica-
tion, or termination, should the ex-
perience of the first year prove all
or part of the program's features
undesirable or infeasible.

Survey

Millkey lamented the lack of re
sponse, and the fact that it pre
cluded getting a picture of faculty
sentiment which was more repre-
sentative. He added that the survey
might have been inadequate or am
biguous, but did not feel that it was
so unclear that more  profesosrs
might have responded in some fash
ion. He was further puzzled at the
number who did not consider worth-
while a re-examination of the cut
system

2. The program will involve a
limited number of students, with
each participating institution  ex-

pected to impose a limitation—to be
determined by the individual col-
leges—-as to the number of ex-
change students it will accept during
a given year. In addition to setting
an overall limitation on the number
of students it will accept, each col-
lege may impose specific limitations
on the number of exchange stu-
dents permissible in given courses or
departments.

3, Each institution agrees to ac-
cept work done by its students at
other colleges as if it has been per-
formed at the home college. Each
home institution will determine its
basis for recommending its students
as participants in the exchange pro-
gram: each host institution will ac-
cept without other evaluation such
students recommended by the home
institutions, subject, of course, to
the numerical limitations the host
schools may impose, either in re-
gard to total exchange numbers or
specific restrictions.

4. Participation in the exchange
program will be designed for stu-
dents in the junior year.

5. Exchange students will be ex-
pected to adhere to all appropriate
and applicable rules and regulations
of the host college, academic or
otherwise.

6. The host institution will deter-
mine in what ways it will accommo-
date the residence and dining re-
quirements of the exchange stu-
dents.

7. An equitable financial arrange-
ment will seek to assure that no in-
stitution must bear unacceptable fi-
nancial burdens by virtue of its par-

ticipation in the exchange program

The exchange, which would begin
with the 1970-71 academic year,
would include four women’s col-
leges and four men’s colleges.

Purposes of the program would
include: (1) to provide a more di-
verse Campus environment, (2) to
provide a limited initial experiment
in cooperative ventures among pri-
vately-supported colleges, possibly
leading to more extensive programs
in the future, (3) to broaden the edu-
cational opportunities of the stu
dents in the eight colleges.

Washington and Lee’s plans call
for accepting not more than 30 stu-
dents from other colleges in the first
year of the program. The exchange
students would come mainly from
the women's colleges. A similar
number of W&L students would be
permitted to go to the other colleges.

During February and March this
year, W&L President Robert Hunt
ley participated in a series of discus-
sions among presidents and othe
representatives of the area private
colleges regarding desirability and
feasibility of a student exchange pro-
gram. He then appointed a commit-
tee of faculty members, administra-
tors and students to evaluate the
proposal. In July, the presidents
and their staffs met again at Peaks
of Otter Lodge and from that three
day session came tentative mutual
agreement on guidelines for the pro
gram,

However, the necessity for ap
propriate consideration of the pro-
posal by W&L’s faculty and trustees,
and the approval of those two
groups, was understood among the
eight colleges to be a prerequisite to
Washington and Lee's participation

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Disappotnting Reponse

The results of an independent survey,
conducted by Bill Millkey and printed on
page one of this newspaper, are, to say the
least, disappointing.

Millkey distributed 108 questionnaires to
faculty members. He received only 32 re-
plies, and of those considerably less than
half seem to favor a less restrictive cut pol-
icy, specifically regarding classes before and
after vacations, which we feel students sup-
port almost unanimously. The response is
too small to be conclusive, but it may repre-
sent present sentiment.

Our disappointment arises from two
sources. First, the response was exceedingly
sparse. Admitting the probability that some
forms were lost or misplaced in collection
and distribution, many are still unaccounted
for. Millkey himself suggests that the ques-
tionnaire may not have been a clear one, and
may not have been considered because it had
the backing of no organization, but that is no
reason to ignore it.

Several professors seemed to fear Mill-
key was not presenting all the facts acquired
from correspondence with other schools, and
it is true that he doesn’t make clear that the
policies at Reed and Swarthmore are repre-
sentative of the replies he received, but we
hope no professor disregarded the survey
merely because its purpose was clearly to ef-
fect change. If that we thought was the case,
we would be even more disillusioned.

The second and more important cause
for our disappointment is the denial on the
part of many of those replying that changes
need to be made. There were, of course,
several reasonable objections raised to lessen-
ing restrictions on cuts in whatever area. The
major one seems to be that students in some
classes, specifically language and small par-
ticipation-oriented courses, suffer consider-
ably when attendance is not regular. This we
accept, but it is, we think, no reason to main-
tain a University-wide policy against cuts be-
fore and after vacation except for dean’s list
students. Indeed, by suggesting that in some
cases the present system is too liberal, it
argue against it.

Before we learned of Mr. Millkey’s poll
and its results, we wouldn’t have imagined
that an articulation of the argument against
the present restrictive system was necessary.
Apparently it is.

There is supposedly implicit in the idea
of a liberal education a great amount of re-
sponsibility placed on the student to govern
his time and his education both in the class-
room and out. Such a cut system as the pre-
sent one, especially insofar as it is stricter
than usual around holidays, is inconsistent
with the idea of individual responsibility.

We cannot moreover accept the argu-
ment that classes would be empty for the last
few days before and after vacations. We
doubt that dean’s list students consistently

Proposal Can

Jim Mathews and Reeve Kelsey have cul-
minated several years of unproductive com-
plaints about Interfraternity Council leader-
ship with their proposal to hold popular elec-
tions for the top two officers of that body.

As the proposal stands, the president and
vice-president will be elected by a majority of
voting fraternity members at the same time
that the Big Four elections are held. Runoffs
will also be handled at the same time as the
student body elections.

This proposal is the first serious move
in some years to correct a problem which has
been in existence even longer. That is, the
IFC leadership, because of the succession
system in the Judicial Board, is selected from
a very small number of present officers by
only the IFC itself. Thus there is little chance
for new ideas to emerge in the course of
campaigns, which can be conducted solely on
the basis of personal friendships and _politi-
cal bargaining. Further, the leadership, once
elected, has no sense of a legitimizing man-
date and is usually conditioned by a year's
service in a stultifying bureaucracy.

The result is that for some time the IFC
has been unable and unwilling to help fra-
ternities with the substantitive problems they
face and has rather been content to be an im-
pediment to progress of any kind. Its sole
function has been that of making token ges-
tures when faculty pressure on fraternities
becomes excessive.

No one pretends, of course, that the

take advantage of their privilege, and we
doubt that any other student would, either,
especially if the class were a stimulating one
and/or one in which the work could not be
effectively made up.

It is also the case that the present rule,
far from engendering a sense of common
effort the academic life should entail, tends
to divide the community even further into
the hill/ student dichotomy that already char-
acterizes it to too great a degree. Such a divi-
sion is likewise inconsistent with the idea of a
liberal education, particularly at a school like
W&L, whose size gives it the potential to
overcome such a split.

The catalog defends the present system
by saying that indication of responsibility is
required before the “privilege” of not going
to class is granted. We doubt first of all that
one’s degree of responsibility is measurable
in terms of gpr. Secondly, even if gpr is an
indication, we think a satisfactory record, as
opposed to an exceptional one, is evidence
of the responsibility required to allot one’s
time to his own best advantage.

And thirdly, we reject the whole notion
that the “privilege” of additional cuts be a
reward for academic proficiency. Scholarship
ought to be its own reward, and class attend-
ance is as much a privilege as the right to
stay away. This being the case, students’
rights should be more nearly equal than they
are at present.

Parenthetically, the idea of enforcing
this rule by the imposition of a fine is trans-
parently inappropriate, and in some cases an
unfair burden, even if one believes the rule
should stand.

So far, we have been arguing merely
against the present rule, with some founda-
tion in the educational philosophy W&L
espouses. We have yet to argue the positive
validity of a change in the rules on the same
grounds. The aforementioned advisibility of
letting the student decide for himself as far
as possible how he will spend his time is the
only major argument to advance, really, and
it, as the responses from five of the six
schools to which Mr. Millkey wrote (David-
son didn’t reply) indicate, is far from insigni-
ficant. Assuming, morever, that a relaxation
of rules would at the very least do no dam-
age, it would make life for students here a
lot more pleasant (allowing many to go home
or elsewhere over vacation that the time allot-
ed doesn’t presently permit) and a lot more
attractive to prospective students.

If indeed one can make a distinction be-
tween courses such a rule change would ef-
fect and those it wouldn’t, perhaps the best
solution is to allow each professor to set his
own attendance rules for each class he of fers.
In no case do we consider the present system
a viable one, and we hope that the faculty,
contrary to the disposition this inconclusive

survey seems to suggest, is amenable to al-
tering it.

Vitalize IFC

Mathews-Kelsey proposal will automatically
insure dynamic leadership. That is beyond
the power of any plan. It does, however, al-
low more possibility for it than presently
exists.

It will at least make likely the articula-
tion of some sort of program prior to elec-
tion, at once giving the voters an idea of what
they are voting for and the candidates some
goals for their administration. It will also of
course provide for a broader mandate and
reduce the oligarchical aspects inherent in
the present system.

The last advantage to be cited, that it
will make possible the introduction of leader-
ship from outside the IFC, might also be ad-
vanced as an objection. Finally, however, we
feel any gain in new ideas more than over-
comes the possible momentary disruption
the election of an officer unfamiliar with the
machinery might cause. If we may utilize an
analogy, we recall that last year’s student
body president had no previous experience
on the Executive Committee, but his term
was one of the most productive and progres-
sive in recent years.

Clearly, the plan needs to be discussed
further. All the details have not yet been
worked out, and there may be other ways to
attain the ends Mathews and Kelsey are
seeking. But those ends must be achieved,
and for that reasin we invite those who care to
comment, or to submit plans of their own, to
use this medium to do so.

The 1970's: Admissions Problems

(Editor’s Note: The following interview is the result of
a conversation earlier this week with James D, Farrar,
Director of Admissions. Chip Harris, Friday Managing
Editor, discussed with Dean Farrar current problems
facing the Admissions Department, and the Admissions
Department’s approach to these problems this year.
This interview compliments an earlier article on ad-
missions by Dick Capron.)

The Friday Ring-tum Phi: Could you give us an indica-
tion of the problems facing you this year?
Dean Farrar: | believe you are familiar with the ques-
tionnaire sent to young men last year who applied,
were accepted, but went elsewhere. A total of 770 ap-
plicants were offered admission for September 1969, Of
that group, 364 entered. Of the 406 not accepting our
offers of admission, 305 (75%) responded to our
questionnaire.

Geographic location ranked first, being checked by
47%, Co-educational preference was listed by 36%
and a preference toward a larger institution for other

-~ he

i ia ee

than academic reasons was a reason given by 25%.
An urban environment was prefered by 22% and prob-
lems of expense was checked by 16%.

For the 108 who responded and signed the ques-
tionnaire, enabling us to compare their files, SAT
board scores were 20 points higher for both verbal and
math scores.

R-t Phi: Could you expand on the problem of “geo-
graphical location” and any related factors?

Farrar: The problem is distance. We are semi-isolated,
the nearest air transportation being Roanoke. Con-
nected with this, and another large factor influencing
decisions, is the urban factor. Quite simply “that's
where the action is.”

We are in a period now where students prefer a
large university if not in an urban area, at least with
access to one.

R-t Phi: in light of these difficulties facing you what
is your approach this year?

Farrar: On the problems of recruiting, everything keys
on the ability to move. Two years ago we had two
people travelling, last year we had three, and this year
we have four, We have doubled our coverage in three
years.

Not only is the area an important factor but it is im-

portant that you go back the following year. You
have to establish a rapport with the schools, It's para-
mount that we maintain the size staff we have this year
R-t Phi: To what extent can alumni be of aid?
Farrar: We have four pilot alumni programs; in Chic-
ago, Philadelphia, The Tri-Cities area in North Caro-
lina, and Atlanta, This is a start. The people involved
in this program work in conjunction with us, imple-
menting our visits. As this develops we will have an
organization that will be able to make visits and answer
questions that applicants might have.

Our primary efforts are in visits and there is sim
ply no substitution for this; you can't do it by mail
R-t Phi: The issue of diversity has been an important
one in recent years could you elaborate on this?
Farrar: Geographical diversity means less and less to
day. The significant diversity is social and economic

When you start cutting across social and economic
lines, you must say to the schools: “we want talented,
able people regardless of their need.” We have been for
tunate that in the past five or six years we have been
able to help finance many men who otherwise would
not have been able to come. We have got to be able
to continue this in the future.

 

R-t Phi: Specifically, how about racial diversity?
Farrar: I recently spent three days in several 100%
black high schools in Philadelphia, and got the ques-
tion, “Why are you coming here?” The answer is fairly
obvious, | think that one of the greatest problems
facing us as a nation is the lack of understanding be-
tween the black and the white.

If we are ever going to understand each other, we
are going to have to study together and be educated
together. There isn’t this opportunity really now at
Washington and Lee for either the white or the black
man, so diversity, racially, is extremely important. I'm
giving you rationale that I think everybody recognizes.
This is what we have to let these people know,

Last year there were 10 young men invited to visit
the campus who were economically disadvantaged, often
with a social disadvantage built in. We offered all the
financial aid necessary to these ten; six were white and
four were black; the six whites came, the four blacks
didn't.

The problem with the blacks is obvious; We had
five black applicants, one confirmed. During the sum-
mer he informed us that he had been accepted by the
Naval Academy and went, because not only did it not
cost him anything but he got $175 a month. The com-
petition is extremely keen; these are very able young
men,

R-t Phi: Could you indicate your policy this year to-
ward black recruitment?

Farrar: This year with the increased staff and the or-
ganizational means open to us we have made an ex-
haustive effort; visits linked up with the programs we
are working with. Those programs include:

Project Access, an Educational Testing Service Pro-
gram which through the Preliminary Scholastic Apti-
tude Tesis and a brief questionnaire attempts to identify
underprivileged school students who demonstrate po-
tential for college. We have this information available
for hundreds of students in poverty area schools in
Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, and Dallas.

The National Scholarship Services and Fund for
Negro Students, 4 national program which identifies
black students with college potential in their junior
year in secondary school and acts primarily as a refer-
ral service to participating colleges. The University is
a participant in NSSFNS.

The National Achievement Scholarship Program, in
effect a black National Merit lesting Program. We
receive, at a charge, the names and addresses of com-
mended students, on the basis of their test results, and
we correspond with hundreds of students each year.

Opportunity Project for Education Now a program
in Washington, D.C. which identifies young men de-
monstrating college potential in the inner city schools
and arranges interviews between candidates and college
representatives at their offices,

The College Entrance Examination Board Test Fee
Waiver Program has been established by the Board and
Colleges wishing to participate and will help in identi-
fying economically disadvantaged students and waive
the expensive College Board Test fees.

These organizations are professional and we are
working closely with them.

_ The Executive Commitice’s Committee on Black
Enrollment can be extremely helpful, when it gets
organized.

R-t Phi: Any other recruiting programs you haven't
mentioned?

Farrar: We have been tuking advantage of college night
programs throughout the country, Professor Huntley
of the English Department spent four days in Rich-
mond,

You have to make a concerted effort, but you have
10 also make a specific effort. We have been through-
out the Middle Wesi, Texas: ete.

A lot of the problem we have been facing is a

matter of pure numbers; trends in the population, In
the past few years applications were generally down,
where last year they began going up. You have dips
and bounds, and when your pool of applicants drop
everything else drops. é
R-t Phi: Could you return to your approaches to the
problems brought out in the questionnaire: do you or
are you planning any long range programs to combat
their effect?
Farrar: We can't do anything
for that matier the urban problem, or size. No matter
what our committee studying it Presently comes up
with, size will never, it seems to me, increase to up-
wards of 5,000 or 10,000 that we are talking about in
a “large” university; we simply don't have the space.

The problem of co-education | think is not over-
whelming. It is, however. definitely a competitive fac-
lor: as Witnessed by our siudy. There is of course the
committee studying all aspects of the problem; from
expensive to size, to the effect on the honor system.
R-t Phi: Could you give us an appraisal as to how you
think the admissions picture will look this year?
Farrar: |i is a little early to estimate our success, how.
ever, already we have applications from five bluck stu-
dents, where last year it was well into March before we
had that number. Numbers seem generally up. The
picture is & MOS encouraging one,

Speaking My Mind

Well It’s a Start Anyway

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

It kind of crept up on us, but
there’s no doubt about it, winter is
here. The signs of it are everywhere.
Cold winds are whistling in from
the Alleghenies, snow flurries occa-
sionally sweep down the Shenan-
doah Valley, the countdown to
Christmas has started, and of course
Davidson has a nationally ranked
basketball team. So what else is
new?

You say how much difference can
there be between two small mens’
schools both of which are nestled
away in ancient Southern towns?
Both of them are known to be fine
academic institutions, but one has a
much wider reputation than the
other because it gets free advertis-
ing in every sports page in the coun-
try. The one is Davidson, the other
is, unfortunately, Washingion and
Lee. Nobody's forgetting that David-
son exists, where on the other hand

four. Oh, and by the way, the
Davidson football team is going to a
bowl game this year. The Tangerine
Bowl. Pasadena it’s not, but even
the Tangerine Bowl is pretty good
for a small mens’ school of 1,000.

So, where did it all start? Can we
follow the Davidson example. . .
should we care to?

Well, we've taken one step in that
direction. Have you taken a look at
the basketball schedule this year?
Not bad. We might lose a few more
ball games, but we'll get into more
sports pages. Navy is on the agenda
again, and, if you check the sched-
ule you'll find Lehigh, Rollins,
Baltimore U., Dickinson, Wofford,
and Fairleigh Dickinson, It's not
worth a standing ovation... that is
unless you remember the big Eas-
tern Mennonite, King College, UNC
at who-knows-where line-up of three
years ago. Boy, those were the days.
We rolled up big scores, yeh, but
what did it matter? Nothing! Right?
... Wrong!

You have to believe that Coach
Canfield, and the rest of the staff,
for that matter, wanted to play
name schools. But what are you g0-
ing to do with a miserable team?
rhis was the situation that Canfield
faced when he took over. So he be-
gan to recruit, an art that had ap-
parently been disappearing around
here.

He actually didn't have to olok
very far for his talent, though. Find-
ing his quick-handed guard (Nor-
wood Morrison) and his strong, re-
bounding forward (Stu Fauber) in
Lynchburg playing at the same
school, Canfield then turned to Mar-
tinsville and Mel Cartwright for his
scoring punch. Big Mike Neer
dropped in from Brown a year later
to give the team its much-needed
big man, Not without altering the
schedule too much, the Generals
could have good, even excellent sea-
sons. Against so-so teams the Gen-
erals proved to everyone but most
importantly to themselves that they

Washington and Lee’s basketball team evened its 1969-

Generals Get First Victory

70 record at 1-1 with a resounding 102-87 victory over Bridge-

water Wednesday night.

Mike Daniel led the scoring barrage with 28 points and
added seven rebounds. Stuart Fauber and Mike Neer con-
tributed 12 and 10 points respectively.

“It was almost a run and shoot
game, which we don’t like,” ex-
plained head coach Verne Canfield,
“We put very littke pressure on
them in the first half, but the second
half was much better.”

Leading only 50-47 at halftime,
the Generals pulled away in the
third quarter. W&L after a first half
performance of 2 rebounds and a
50% field goal percentage, finished
the game with 47 rebounds and a
54% floor percentage.

Cook and Wampler led the Eagles
in Bridgewater's point production.
Cook scored 25 and Wampler tossed
in 18 with eight rebounds.

The Generals outmanned the
Eagles in rebounds, as Bridgewater
could only collect 40. A floor per-
centage of only 43% also crippled
Bridgewater.

Another factor which pleased
Coach Canfield was the Generals’
conditioning. “We had depth, too.
That will be an asset further into the
season,” he added.

Referring to the season-opening
loss to Randolph-Macon, Coach
Canfield attributed the defeat to
“mental turnovers”. “Defensively, it
was one of our best efforts. The kids
might have been too ready.” Coach
Canfield thought that the 57-56 loss
was not the result of big problems
While praising Scott Wood's defen-
sive effort, the head coach expressed
some displeasure with the back-
court.

Against the Yellow Jackets, Mike
Neer put in 17 points and grabbed
17 rebounds. Norwood Morrison
added 12. Weston tossed in 24
points with 15 rebounds for the
Jackets, followed by Howard (10
points, five rebounds). Both teams
were cold on the floor, Randolph-
Macon hitting 32° of the time and
Washington and Lee for 43%. The
Generals just edged the Jackets in
the rebound department, 41-40.

Tomorrow night the Generals
open their home season with a po-
tent Rollins team. Head Coach Boyd
Coffie welcomed eight returning let-
termen, including all five starters.
The Winter Park, Florida school
boasted a 16-10 record last year

The nucleus of the team is com-
posed of Laurence Martinez, Frank
Valenti, and Tim Shea. Martinez, a
61" junior, averaged 21 points a
game last year and set a new Rollins
individual scoring mark with 538
points. Valenti, the Tars’ play-
maker, is a New York City product
who averaged 15 points each game

Sophomore Tim Shea led the team
in rebounding and contributed 12
points.

The other members of the Tars’
starting roundballers are 64° Jim
Murphey and 6'7” Cliff Livingston,
an Edison Junior College transfer.

Rolins opened its season last Mon-
day with Stetson University, ranked
eleventh in Basketball News Maga-
zine’s small college poll. Stetson
edged the Tars in overtime, 77-76,
with Martinez scoring 23 points and
Shea adding 12.

“So we'll have our hands full,”
opinioned Coach Canfield.

University of Virginia Presents
Joplin Performance Tomorrow

The University of Virginia Uni-
versity Union will sponsor Janis

Joplin in concert tomorrow night in
Charlottesville. Tickets for the con-
cert, scheduled for Virginia’s Uni-
versity Hall at 7:30, will be $3.50 at
the door,

One of the dominant figures in to-
day’s rock field, Miss Joplin, who
rose to fame with Big Brother and
the Holding Company, draws widely
varying reactions from those who
see and hear her,

William Glackin of the Sacra-
mento Bee termed her an “extra-
ordinarily compelling performer”

and attributed her success in part to
a “restless energy that moves her
back and forth, up and down, all
the time.”

The New York Times said that “if
Janis had happened in another era
she would have been known as one
of the great jazz singers,” while
Lloyd Dykk of the Vancouver Sun
termed her “a lamb offering itself to
the gods, a physical dissipation and
a spiritual elevation with a voice
reminiscent of a buzz-saw.”

Brian McLeod of The Province
reported that “Janis Joplin defies
categories, gender and description.
She can twist her dynamic blues
voices around any form she desires.
Huskiness becomes her as it seems
to become all chanteuses in her
vein, but under the flaunted tough
shell there is more than a trace of
angelic delicacy and the soprano.”

Elsewhere on the concert scene at
neighboring schools, the Student Ac-
tivities Committee of Madison Col-
lege will present a Christmas Con-
cert in Harrisonburg on Friday, De-
cember 12.

The Swinging Medallions, whose
hits include “Double Shot,” and Bob
Marshall and the Chrystals, known
for “She Shot a Hole in My Soul”
will be featured in the concert
which will be held in Wilson Audi-
torium.

There will be two shows, at 7
p.m. and 10 p.m. Tickets, either by
the advance sale that started Decem-
ber 1, or at the door, are two dol-
lars per person,

cerned alumni. Invariably, however,
they were concerned with one topic:
dress.

When alumni come to Lexington
to confer with the administration,
their major complaint concerns that
same topic: dress.

] ask you, Charles Gilmore: Have
you attempted to determine why
Washington and Lee does not have
a reputation as the finest school of
its kind, as it could and should?

Have you attempted to determine
why some of the facilities at Wash-
ington and Lee are over-crowded or
insufficient?

Have you questioned the essenti-
ally homogeneous makeup of the
student body? Have you attempted
to determine why minority groups
avoid Washington and Lee?

No, Charles Gilmore, you limit
your probing to a minor outward
manifestation, i.c., dress. And you
do so with diction which would at
best be considered substandard.

If you will excuse the use of an
unfortunate yet unavoidable cliche,
the “silent majority” of alumni must
be concerned with issues more sub-
stantial than those with which Gil-
more and Friends concern them-
selves,

In any event, | am so concerned,
and will continue to make my con-
cern known in the future. | urge
others to do likewise.

Red Cross Blood mobile
Arrives Here Wednesday

The American Red Cross Blood-
mobile will be at the University
Center this coming Wednesday
from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. The Uni-
versity is expecting a good turnout
from its students because over 300
signed pledges promising to give
blood. Permission has been ob-
tained from the great majority of
parents of the students under 21
who have promised to give blood.
hese slips have been filed wiih the
Red Cross.

The Red Cross has always been
short of donations during the Christ-
mas season in the past. Holiday sea-
son accidents increase the demand
while colds and the flu cut down on
the usable blood supply. For this
reason the Rockbridge area has al-
ways been dependant on the WAL
students for a large turnout.

The turnout of WAL students in
the past has been rather poor. For
a long period the Bloodmobile didn't
bother to come. However, last year
indicated a great improvement as
88 pints of blood were donated by
students. This “record” looks medio-
cre when last year students at Hol-
lins donated 149 pints and Long-
wood students donated 169 pints.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, December 9, 1969

Do we lack curiosity?

In his recently published ‘College Confidential’ Law-
rence Handel states, “there is one thing that the Washington
and Lee student lacks— intellectual curiosity.”

Tracing this intellectual void to the fraternity system,
Handel charges, “‘(it) enables the students to spend their
extra time imbibing in one of the eighteen houses on camp-
us.”

We all realize the absurdity of Mr. Handel’s conclusion.
On Wednesday there will be an opportunity to demonstrate
that W&L is in fact more than an incubator for the AA. We
can ostensibly prove to any Mr. Handel that we are an aca-
demic community and that we are not totally devoid of the
powers of thought.

Tomorrow the Student Curriculum Committee will con-
duct a referendum to ascertain general sentiment on an in-
dependent exam schedule. We are thinking about this but we
must tell the faculty along what lines we are thinking.

The 12-12-6 calendar necessarily curtails the number of
testing days for final exams. If we fail to illustrate our over-
all desire for the creation of an independent schedule, the
faculty may possibly vote in retrogressive legislative action to
return to a schedule of two exams per day. If we really are
intellectually “out of it”, we may quite fairly be nailed to the
wall by an exam schedule dictated by mechanical technicali-
ties.

The faculty has a number of times exhibited its open
willingness to listen to the voices of the student body and to
incorporate our desires in new policies. The faculty knows the
opinion of the Executive Committee and The Ring-tum Phi,
but they need to know everyone’s feeling on this matter.

At the present time we are the only college in Virginia
with an effective honor system that does not enjoy the fruits
of independent scheduling of examinations. Through the
honor system we have repeatedly proven our “gentlemanly”
and thoughtful ability to handle situations analogous to an
independent exam schedule.

Let’s again show we have the capacity to use our heads.
Let’s demonstrate the fact that our desire to see a rational
exam schedule supercedes any hangovers. Let’s prove our
intellectual curiosity.

Proving our curtosity
Cc -

“Esse quam videri’’ reads an ancient maxim. Unfor-
tunately, many prospective applicants may never journey to
Lexington. Rather than learning what “we are” first-hand,
these people must “see” second-hand information before
they formulate a mental picture of W&L.

We earnestly hope that Mr. Handel’s portrait of General
Lee’s college is not consulted as a reliable reference. Need-
less to say, we call into question his conclusions—obviously
that is all they are. We now must actively engage ourselves in
proving, especially to interested high school students, the
falseness of Handel’s “confidential” information.

Fortunately, on December 1 the faculty chalked a positive
entry on our balance sheet. By approving the exchange pro-
gram, they displayed that amenity to innovation frequently
disclosed in the past two years by students, faculty and ad-
ministrators alike.

The exchange program, besides its attractiveness to ap-
plicants in more objective statistical profilese—Dean Farrar
reported in the Friday Edition that 36%, of those freshmen
accepted but who did not enter last year did so because they
preferred a coeducational institution—indicates the general
desire here to satisfy intellectual curiosity by experimenting.
Certainly, one of our biggest immediate questions is co-
education. One of the many benefits of the exchange pro-
gram should be to provide, or to assist in locating, some an-
swers to this problem.

The independent exam proposal

By Chip Schooley

Curriculum Committee
In September Washington and
Lee will implement the sweeping

changes in curriculum proposed by
the Faculty Curriculum Committee
last spring. This change will affect
not only courses and distribution re-
quirements, but the University cal-
endar as well.

In October a calendar was adopt-
ed by the faculty which allows six
days for examinations at the end of
the fall twelve week term and eight
days for examinations at the end of
the spring twelve week term. Al-
though the normal load will be four
courses rather than five, these ex-
amination periods are a marked
condensation when compared to the
present eleven day periods,

If examinations continue to be
scheduled, it is likely that morning
and afternoon examinations will be
necessary. The other alternative is
an Independent Examination Sche-
dule. There are currently no plans
on the part of any committee of the
faculty or the administration to in-
vestigate the feasibility of such a
program. In view of the decisive de-
feat of the proposal last year, this
is not surprising, however.

It is the feeling of the Student
Curriculum Committee and the Stu-
dent Body Executive Committee that
these shortened examination  per-
iods necessitate another considera-
tion of an independent or semi-in-
dependent examination program.

One major stumbling block in
the implementation of an Indepen-
dent Examination Schedule has in

Hilliard disputes Spiro’s theology

both offer ten commandments

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

Vice President Spiro Agnew has
presented the country with what he
calls the ten commandments of pro
test. The ten commandments, ac-
cording to the Vice President, in-
clude such gems as:

“Thou shalt not
ponent to speak.”

“Thou shalt not honor thy mother
or thy father.”

“Thou shalt not revere any but
totalitarian heroes.”

“Thou shalt not ask forgiveness
for thy transgressions, rather thou
shalt demand amnesty for them.”

Isn't the Vice-President clever? I
guess Agnew is saying that the more
than one million people who took
part in the October 15 Moratorium
on the Vietnam War are anarchists,
communists, and hate their parents
My mother should be glad to know
that

Well, if Agnew can make up a
list of ten commandments for pro
1 guess | can have poet
license to draw up the ten command
ments for Spiro T. Agnew, so here
pues

Thou

tesiors,

Thou shalt not countenance erit:
cism, rather thou shalt brand al!
protestors as traitors

Thou shalt enjoy the tasie of shoe

make thyself a household word

Thou shalt do and say exucily as
Richard Nixon preaches

Thou shalt accept any Pstablish
ment idea without questioning

Thou shall not trust anvbody un
der WO ercept David Eiwenhowe:
and especially your own daughter

Thou shalt condemn any hody
living in Washington or New York

Thou shalt polarize public opinion
as best you can.

That's nine commandments for
the Vice President. Since one of his
commandments for protestets is:
“Thou shalt not

Foreign Study
Committee seeks
needed answers

Some time ago the Foreign Study
Commitice announced its intention
to ask freshmen and sophomores for
their assistance with the committee's
own interest in developing a foreign
study program for Washington and
Lee

\ questionnaire will be presented
on Wednesday, and all freshmen and
sophomores are asked to take a few
minutes of their time to provide an
swers to the questions it asks, Tables
with the questionnaire will be locat
ed in Evans Dining Hall, in front of
Washington Hall, and on the first
floor of DuPont Hall

the Committee hopes for a good
response to its questionnaire so that
it can be guided by student opinions
as Ht continues tO exXamine the en
lire question of a foreign study pro
gram for the University

The questionnaire is directed at
freshmen and sophomores because
they will be in the best siltation to

the past been lack of confidence in
the Honor System on the part of
the faculty. In an effort to assess the
confidence of the student body in
the Honor System, especially in the
context of an Indepenednt Examina-
tion Schedule, the Student Curti-
culum Committee and the Student
Body Executive Committee are spon-
soring a referendum tomorrow in
which two questions will appear on
the ballot:

Do you feel that an Independent

Examination Schedule would pose

an unwarranted burden on_ the

Honor System?

Do you favor the establishment

of a system whereby a_ student

has the option of scheduling his

own examinations?

The two questions may seem un-
necessarily broad, but it is our feel-

ing that unless students are confid
ent that the Honor System can sup-
port an independent examination
schedule, any investigation of the
details of such a schedule would be
meaningless. If students voice sup
port for an independent examina
tion schedule, and further, feel that
the Honor System is strong enough
to support it, the Student Curriculum
Committee and the Student Body
Executive Committee will move for
ward in the drafting of a proposal
for admission to the faculty.

I would like to emphasize that
the first question should not be an
swered lightly. An independent ex
amination schedule will require con
stant awareness on the part of the
students that every examination
taken remains hot until the final day
of the examination period.

Students will have to exercise
great care not to discuss any ex-
amination with anyone else, whether
he be enrolled in the course or not.
The reason for this is obvious; a
casual discussion at hand about an
examination taken a few minutes
earlier might be overheard by some
one in the course. The student is
then faced with the dilemma of
whether he should go to the pro
fessor and tell him what he acci-
dently heard, or whether he should
make an effort not to have his stu
dies influenced by the new informa
tion along these lines.

I would also like
that “information” about an ex
amination may be obtained from
seemingly innocuous comments. I
should be made clear that such for
bidden information inciudes not only
the actual material on the quiz, but
also such things as length, degree of
difficulty, and format.

The adoption of a system where
by a student has the option of sche
duling his own examination is not
as simple as it may seem, The Cur
riculum Committee feels that with
the shortened examination periods,
fair scheduling of examinations will
be quite a problem.

The only alternative to the rev
sion to a two-a-day examination sys
tem, as we see it, is the adoption of
some form of independent schedule
We do not wish to make any pro
posals along these lines, however,
unless students are confident that
the Honor System is sufficiently re
liable to support such a program
If the student body responds al
firmatively to both questions to
morrow, we will work toward some
independent examination proposal
If the faculty then turns down the
proposal on the basis of lack of
confidence in the Honor System
they will in effect be saying “We are
protecting you from yourselves.’

I have attempted to outline the
reasons for tomorrow's referendum
and the thought behind it. | would
like to encourage all students to
respond honestly to the two ques
tions posed.

Washington and Lee swimmers The player of the dite
washed out 69-35 by American

the Washington and Lee swimm-
ing team got off to a poor start this
season losing to American Univer-

ty by a decisive 69-35 margin. The
Generals were only able to capture
two individual firsts and one relay
event as the American
dominated the meet.

Alan Corwith, freshman free
styler, captured one of the two firsts
in the 200 yard freestyle event with
the excellent time of 1:55.0 seconds
which is within one second of the
school record. Bim Clark won the
200 yard butterfly setting a new
school and CAC conference record
of 2:12.5. Clark and Corwith com-
bined with Bill Brumback and co-
captain Roger Martin to win the last
event, the 400 yard freestyle relay
with a 3:28.7 second time.

The American depth also limited
the blue natators to only three sec-
ond place finishes. Brumback was
touched out by A.U.’s Brazilian im
port Jose Aranha in the 50 yard
freestyle. The finish was so close, it
required a judge’s decision before
the results were known; Aranha is
considred the 7th best freestyler in

swimmers

the world. Diver Ray Hammond
tallied 114,45 points, falling 20
points behind the A.U. diver, The
final W&L second place finisher
was Aven Sharp who scored a sec-
ond in the 200 yard breaststroke.

This is the first time the Generals

meet. A week from Thursday, the
natators will host to Catholic Uni-
versity—a team Coach Stearns has
yet to beat. Next to the University
of Virginia meet after Christmas,
these are two of the toughest dual
meets that the natators’ will have
to face this year.

The J.V. swimming team yester-

Initial basketball home encounter
a tremendous win over Rollins

By Roy Carlton

The sounds of bouncing basket
balls and cheering crowds returned
to Doremus Gym Saturday night as
Washington and 1969 hard-
court team opened its home season
by mauling a highly touted Rollins
squad, 84-62. The victory closed out
the Generals’ first week of play and

Lee's

left them with a 2-1 record. A loss
to Randolph-Macon in Ashland
started the season off on a rocky

path, but the Generals quickly re-
covered by butchering Bridgewater
Thursday night by a 102-87 margin

The Rollins team which appeared
at W&L on Saturday came with all
the right credentials, All five starters
and eight lettermen returned from a
team which had gone 16-10 last year
against difficult opposition. But due
to some poor scheduling, the Tars
now find themselves with an 0-3 rec-
ord. Their opening game was a one
point loss to Stetson, ranked ninth
among small colleges by Basketball
News. Then came another close loss
to Randolph-Macon on the road.

The Generals’ manhandling of the
lars was hardly the same. The Blue
jumped off to an early lead which
they mever surrendered, although
Rollins did manage to tie the score
twice, the last time being at 18-18
The differences in styles of play were
obvious, too, The close teamwork of
the Generals was in sharp contrast
with the highly individual and erratic
play of the Stetson aggregate, and
kept the Blue well out in front
despite a cold-shooting first half

The Generals broke things up for
good right after Rollins had tied
things up at 18-all. Mike Daniel
whipped off four quick points which
were followed by two by Mel Cart-
wright. Trailing by six, Coach Boyd
Coffie ordered a time out and began
forces. When the
lars returned to the court the well-
coordinated Blue were faced with a
full court From that point,
matters went from bad to worse for
Rollins as the Blue continually
caught the opposing forwards out of
position. The W&L guards did have
some trouble getting the ball to
midcourt within fifteen seconds, but

to rearrange his

press,

always managed to get it across

More often than not they found fot

court for an easy two points. By
halftime the Generals had run their
margin up to 40-28,

he second half brought more of
the same as Neer, Cartwright and
Daniel along with varying combina-
tions of guards continued to increase
the W&L lead. Norwood Morrison,
Ellie Gutshall and Bill Rhyne traded
off at guard with fine work both de-
fensively and offensively.

With minutes to go, and
the Blue enjoying a 24 point lead,
Coach Canfield began sending in
substitutes. For a two minute pe!
iod, the Floridians began closing the
gap as the substituted players seem-
ed to have some difficulty getting
together. With five minutes left, the
regulars were sent back in to stem
the tide, because by now the W&L
lead had been reduced to 17.

Thornton picks
Penn State as
number 1 team

(Continued from Page 3)

State play on television, I can risk
some kind of comparative judgment.
Ihe Longhorns have their share of
stars, concentrated in the offensive
backfield and along the offensive
front wall. For instance, Texas quar-
terback James Street proved him-
self as the Southwest Conference
player of the year with his clutch
play against Arkansas, and backs
Wooster, Key, and Berielson have
been great all year in rolling up fan-
tastic rushing and scoring statistics.

On the other hand, the forces of
Penn State coach Joe Paterno also
offer individual stars. The Nittany
Lions offense is frightening with
such backs as Charley Pittman,
Franco Harris, and Lydell Mitchell.
This trio shows three game break-
ers, as opposed to the Longhorn’s
methodical maulers. And the Penn
State defense is equally awesome.
Led by All-American picks Mike
Reid and Dennis Onkotz and sup-
ported by such beasts as aptly named
Steve Smear, the Pennsylvanians are
grudging defenders.

What would be the result of such
a dream game? How would Reid
Fare against Texas All-American
Bobby McKay, or Ankotz againsi
Wooster? We won't know this year,
so the post-bowl comparisions will
have to decide whether or not
President Nixon in fact picked a
winner.

Keep your eye on the last wire
service poll-my bet is that Governor
Shafer and his fellow Pennsylvanians
will have an even stronger claim on
that number one spot following the
New Year's Day fireworks.

Hickman explains fish physiology:

A Washington and Lee University
biology professor has written a fish
story.

In this case, however, it’s not a
story of the one that got away. In-
stead, Dr. Cleveland P. Hickman,
Jr. of Washington and Lee and Dr.
Benjamin F. Trump of Duke Uni-
versity have jointly made the first
attempt to assemble all available
information concerning structure and
function of the fish kidney.

Medical physiologists have long
been interested in the fish kidney,
which is remarkably advanced, Dr.
Hickman noted, Certain kinds of

research are more readily accom-
plished with fish than with mam-
mals, including man, Fish kidneys
have frequently been used as model
systems for studying abnormal kid-
ney function following injury or
disease.

The work of Drs. Hickman and
Trump appears as the second chap-
ter of a multi-author, multi-volume
treatise entitled Fish Physiology,
which is being published by Acade-
mic Press of New York.

Included in the chapter are 22
line drawings, 35 light photo-micro-
graphs, and 25 electron photomicro-
graphs and many of the line draw-
ings are original. The 148-page chap-
ter follows the subject from the
primitive hagfishes and lampreys to
the advanced fresh-water and mar-
ine fishes. From their studies, the
authors were able to reconstruct the
probable evolutionary development
of the vertebrate kidney.

The appearance of the research
is especially timely because of the
increased interest by biologists in
the fish kidney’s sensitivity to the
various industrial pollutants which
are being added to the nation’s
streams and lakes.

Law School
Sends Squad

To Tourney

Gantry University, a fictitious col-
lege that expelled students for con-
ducting a demonstration, will be a
center of attention for four Wash-
ington and Lee University students
in national competition next week.

A moot court team from W&L’s
School of Law will participate in
the National Moot Court Competi-
tion in New York, Dec. 15-17.

The Washington and Lee team
earned the right to be in the na-
tional meet by winning a four-state
regional meet in which law schools
of nine colleges and universities par-
ticipated last month in Norfolk. It
marked the third time in the last
four years that Washington and Lee
has won the regional meet.

rhis year’s moot question centers
around the problem of student un-
rest in colleges. W&L’s team has
prepared a brief arguing that Gantry
U. was not on solid legal ground in
expelling the students for conduct
ing a peaceful demonstration.

Washington and Lee’s first op-
ponent will be the University of
Indiana. Twenty-six colleges will

compete.

Each competing team prepares a
brief on one side of a debatable
legal question. Team members must
also be prepared to argue either
side of the case when they are in
moot court competition

Student Body Endorses
Independent Examination

A giant step was taken Wednes-

day in the direction of an inde-
pendent exam schedule when the
students took part in a referendum
to determine their views. An over-
whelming majority of students voted
in favor of the proposals of the
Curriculum Committee.

In the rain of Wednesday 829
students voted at the polling places
around the campus. The first ques-
tion on the ballot was “Do you feel
that an Independent Examination
Schedule would pose an unwarrant-
ed burden on the Honor System?”
Eighty-two students voted in the af-
firmative on this question and 743
students voted in the negative. The
second question was “Do you favot
the establishment of a system where-
by a student has the option of
scheduling his own examinations?”
On this question 794 students voted
in the affirmative and 35 students

offense with 1,107 yards gained, the
majority of it in passing. Kuhn com

yards and ran for an additional 183
yards.

Gardner, Washington's sensational
freshman tailback, accumulated 842
yards in rushing, an average of 93.6
yards a game and just over five yards
a carry

Kuhn edged champion Centre's
top-notch quarterback, Paul Eth-
ridge, in passing and total offense.
Ethridge’s total bag was 918 yards,
all but nine of them in the air.

WAL flanker Bruce Green nipped
Sewanee’s Keith Bell to win scoring
honors. Green caught eight touch
down passes for 48 points, while
Bell accumulated 46 points on seven
touchdowns and four extra points

Washington's Kerry Drulis was
the top pass receiver with 37 grabs

THE RING-TUM PHI

College Confidential:
An A ppraisal

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi reacted to the profile of
W&L appearing in a college handbook in a manner we
heard voiced often here when the article became public.
Quoting Lawrence Handel’s characterization of the Wash-
ington and Lee student as having displaced intellectual
curiosity with the gentlemanly ideal, the Tuesday edition
called this conclusion ‘‘absurd.’’ We are not so sure.

There is an admitted problem involved in anyone making
such value judgments about a school. The basis for such
an evaluation is ultimately subjective, and we doubt we could
pronounce in such a public way about America’s colleges. Mr.
Handel obviously feels he can.

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi cites several reasons why the
profile in College Confidential is absurd, but all these seem
to center around the changes that have occurred here re-
cently, explicitly the exchange program. It further called
for a large student turnout in the exam referendum to prove
once again that students are intellectually curious. We ques-
tion whether the vote on such an issue, which is essentially
self-preservative, or the faculty’s approval of an exchange
program can be linked in such a certain manner to intellectual
curiosity.

We will agree that Mr. Handel probably gathered his
material prior to the curriculum changes made last year, and
so the force of his conclusion is somewhat mitigated.

Nonetheless, he is still substantially correct. For whatever
reason, school is still basically an interruption for too many
W&L students, a burden which they have to bear on the way
to acquiring a diploma, their union card to the professions.
Some of these students are very diligent, noting a correlation
between good grades and quality graduate school acceptances,
and between the latter and lots of money, but hard work is
not per se evidence of intellectual curiosity.

We do believe that if Mr. Handel were to re-examine
W&L this year he would be forced to admit that circum-
stances, especially over the past two years, are changing for
the better. It may even be said that in the last four years
the emphasis has shifted from one overwhelmingly that de-
scribed in College Confidential to one perhaps slightly in
favor of the norm he advocates. At any rate, that is the
direction in which the University is moving, and we feel
the new curriculum, calendar and exchange program (and
hopefully coeducation) will accelerate the process. Much still
needs to be done.

There are many who would question our qualified opti-
mism, and perhaps they are right.

Finally, whether one agrees with the evaluation com-
pletely, accepts it with qualifications, as we do, or dismisses
it entirely, one must still realize that many prospective stu-
dents are going to reject W&L because of the conclusions
Mr. Handel reaches. It is therefore incumbent upon all those
concerned with education here to weigh carefully the decis-
ions that are facing the University and consider the issues
it ought to be confronting with the consciousness that both
the fact and the image of intellectual lethargy must be re-
moved as quickly and effectively as possible.

A Basic Student Right

The Interfraternity Council has, by asking to be allowed
a representative at faculty meetings, implicitly posed a much
broader problem.

Traditionally, faculty meetings have been closed affairs
at nearly every University in the country. Many have aban-
doned this practice, but it still persists ac W&L.

We think the students have a basic right to have at faculty
meetings at least one representative who can communicate
to the student body the business transacted in a more
thorough and knowledgeable manner than is presently pos-
sible. It is after all, the —_ s business, too, that is trans-
acted there. The faculty ought, of course, to have the pre-
rogative of closed sessions much as the _— Committee
of the Student Body now does, but we think this should be
the rarest of exceptions to the rule.

If a representative were admitted, students would not
only be aware of the outcome of issues, but also of their initial
reception, arguments for and against and the relative strength
of the prevailing sentiment. The most immediate results would
be that students could more intelligently formulate their own
proposals, and think and work with the faculty on matters
of mutual concern, instead of in the isolation that now
prevails,

The only argument we have heard advanced against
implementation of such a practice, although there are prob-
ably others, is that professors fear unpopular Views might
have adverse effects in the classroom. We doubt that fear
would materialize. Ir does seem to us at any rate that the
potential danger is certainly less than that taken by an EC
member, OF any student expressing an opinion in the Ring-
tum Phi. The faculty seems to have always acted with re
straint when differences of opinion were involved, and we
see no reason for the faculty to imagine students would not
act with similar good judgment.

On Grappling With A Tragedy

By Kirk Woodward

The Troubadour Theater chal-
lenges itself with every production.
and next Tuesday through Friday it
presents a play which everybody
knows is a challenge. King Lear is
allegedly the pinnacle of tragic
drama. Bernard Shaw. for example.
says that “No one will ever write
a better tragedy than King Lear.”
Is he right? If he is, can the play be
produced successfully?

Some answers to these question
will emerge when the play is pre-
sented next week: we have been
working on them for a month and a
half. Without claiming to know
what the performances will tell us.
we are able to identify some of the
problems the play presents. You
will be able to judge results for
yourself,

The first problem of the play is
that its reputation gets in its way.
“Tragedy has a good press. The
catharsis that tragedy is supposed to
provide is certified a Good Thing.
so the audience sits and waits to
feel a catharsis. The newspapers ask
why no one writes tragedy any morc
and assume that people should

This expectation affects casts as
well as audiences. Aciors try to be-
come tragically sublime. They take
on hollow-sounding voices—prefer-
ably British accented: they look to
the heavens often. or to the second
balcony (at the Troubadour, if it
happened, we would have to say that

they look at the plumbing. Come
and see)
If the hollow rhetorical style

doesn't appeal. a director is likely
as noi to try for a strong effect by
imposing what Eric Bentley calls
Bright Idea: Othello in art nouveau
decor, Macheth as a Christ figure.
Hamlet on a trapeze—anything to
jack up the audience's feelings
These examples may sound far
fetched, but each year Shakespeare
productions get madder and madder
(A Henry ¥ in New York this year
seemed to take place on a sort of

playground.) The antidote to this
vagueness is to try and make sense
out of the play. In King Lear, what
is it in Edmund that makes every-
body trust him? Are Lear's knights
really riotous? What kind of a father
was Gloucester?

As Bentley says, the director who
approaches Shakespeare this way
finds himself a pioneer. King Lear,
when approached this way, emerges
as an extraordinarily well put to-
gether piece of drama, with details
thoroughly prepared for in advance
and with even the most apparently
diffuse sections—the Fool's conver-
sation and the mad scenes—tight
and economical.

On the other hand, Lear presents
a mumber of serious difficulties. It
might be expected that the title role
is one of them, and it is: still, Lear
is seldom forced to hold the stage
himself and he shares the weight of

his part with Edgar and the Fool in
some of the scenes.

An even bigger problem is that
the play is long and fairly sprawling.
It has an enormous weight. A cast
has to concentrate hard to maintain
tension through the length of the
play and present meaning as well.
We cut the play some. Still, keep-
ing it moving depends mainly on
mindbending work from the cast.

Another difficulty is built into any
United States production of Shake-
speare. Our language habits are
sloppy. Hamlet's soliloquy is likely
to begin, “Tuh be or not tuh be.”
Blank verse speaking demands pre-
ciseness and variety, as well as the
ability to act. What's more, our
culture teaches little boys not to ery
and men to keep their voices down,
so a line like “World, world, o
world” is hard to say without self-
consciousness.

am terribly proud that the Trou
hae are doing King Lear, no!
only because the play is such a land
mark in drama but because it strikes
me as an image of life that we need
with us all the time. Every audience
sides with Lear, Cordelia, Edgar and

Kent against Goneril and Regan,
but the first four are mad—in real
madness, in their love, and in their

final faith in forgiveness—and the
last two are rational, even intellect-
ual, and correct in everything they
say about Lear, the foolish old man

Can you imagine forgiveness as
a national policy? At this moment
we Overflow with Gonerils and Re-
gans who won't hear of such a thing
Their reasons are sound like Gon
eril’s and Regan’s, and the peopie
who forgive are as mad as hatiers
All the same, if we are going to re
main human we simply must some-
how find our way to Cordelia

W&L Students Aren’t ‘In Love’

Could it be that the supporters of
coeducation at Washington and Lee
University have found an irresistible
argument?

Namely. WAL students are not
falling in love enough. To be pre-
cise, they are falling in love ai 11.2
percentage points below the national
level for four-year colleges.

And who is bold enough to op-
pose love?

The figures are those of the
American Council on Education.
which has been conduciing for some
years extensive surveys on campuses
to define the environment and to
determine what shapes it. Freshmen
fill out detailed questionnaires on
their habits and preferences, and
later in their college careers some
of them gei follow-up questionnaires

Iwo years ago, 150 Washingion
and Lee men filled out one of those
follow-up forms, giving facts and

opinions about the college environ-
ment in some 33 categories. The
data was released by the Council
this month.

Those reporting, “I fell in love,”
amounted to 14.6 per cenit of the
respondents. Nationally, 25.8 per
cent of students responding from
four-year colleges reported they had
fallen in love.

Interpreting the significance of
this data, Council researchers said
colleges with high scores in this
category tend to be places where
students engage in dating of “an
informal or casual type (coke. coffee.
or study dates)” and that colleges
with low scores are those where
students frequently complain about
not having enough dates. Colleges
for men, in particular, tend to fall
into the latter category, the Council
said.

The American Council on Educa-
fon survey had some favorable
things to report about Washington
and Lee's classroom atmosphere

Only 4 per cent of the WAL siu
denis thought that students were
treated “more like numbers in a
book” than human beings, compared
with 21 per cent of students a: all
four-year colleges, and 28 per cent
of students at all types of higher

Speaking My Mind...

 

Sports Illustrated’s Jinx

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

Somewhere in the vast domain of
Rockefeller Center, or wherever
Sports Illustrated is published,
there’s bound to be a closet full of
broken crystal balls because, man,
the big boys up there just don’t
know how to pick the winners. Now
I know that the SI kiss-of-death leg-
end has been floating around for
some time. | mean, you make the
cover of the magazine, then you go
out and lose your next game which
coincidentally ruins your whole year.
Chat’s all there is to it. Plain and

simple. But it’s getting to the point
now where they should leave the
cover blank, because one dandy jinx

has hit that fine magazine this fall.

Well, why not? They deserve it,
don't they? Back in October when
the whole country was going ban-
anas over the Mets, Sports Ilustrat-
ed held its ground, There was Frank
Robinson on the cover of the Octo-
ber 6 issue. Two weeks later the
great Brooks Robinson adorned SI's
front. Well we all know what hap-
pened! The Mets pranced their way
to victory, leaving the Orioles and
Sports Illustrated feeling the effects
of a double-whammy, Maybe S|!
still is suffering the consequences
for bucking the wild Metsomania
tide, for ever since then their cover

 

PREVENT FOREST ries tea

stories have been ominous omens
of impending disaster.
“Green Bay—The Road Back!”

It certainly seemed logical to write
this article back in early October.
The Pack was seemingly bouncing
back after a horrendous ‘68 sea-
son. But bam-crunch and it was bye-
bye Bart Starr, Today the only road
Green Bay is on is the one leading
back from Cleveland. That’s where
they suffered their sixth defeat of
the season.

And then there was the story of
the unfortunate Georgia Bulldogs.
The SEC had many fine football
teams this year, makings of a great
cover story. Bul which one was to
go on the cover? It could have been
any one of seven teams. The honor
was bestowed upon Georgia who
mysteriously changed from Bulldogs
to Hotdogs later in the season when
they discovered that you can’t win
games without a quarterback,

So on down the list. October 27
“My Story by Lew Alcindor.” What
1 great guy! All that’s happened to
the giant since then is some bad
publicity. When you play badly,
Lew, you might get booed. And if
you get booed, Lew, you don’t spit
on the floor and push some kid
down who's bugging you. I repeat

. great guy!

Nothing’s to be gained by rubb-
ing in all these chance misfortunes,
though. SI has had some good mo-
ments mixed in with the bad. Steve
Owens overcame the handicap of
being on the cover and went on his
rampaging way to the Heisman
Trophy and I don’t suppose that the
magazine has suffered any because
of its present slump. Anyway good
and bad breaks in sports have a
tendency to even out over the long
run, so SI can probably look for-
ward to a rosy future. But, my God,
for the time being—Teams! Coaches!
Players! . . . Beware!

Washington and Lee’s high-flying
Generals extended their record to
4-1 with decisive victories over
Hampden-Sydney and Lynchburg
by 86-56 and 66-49. Tomorrow the
Generals travel to Pennsylvania to
take on Lehigh.

Mel Cartwright went on a ram-
page against Hampden-Sydney, scor-
ing 25 points and grabbing a career-
high 22 rebounds. Mike Neer added
15 points and took 18 rebounds
while patrolling the boards. Mike
Daniel was third on the scoring list
with 14 points,

Cartwright shot for a 59% field

goal percentage while tallying 9
assists. Although the Generals were

only 38 for 32 from the floor, they
made up for it by amassing 70 re-
bounds,

Earlier in the week, Washington
and Lee topped Lynchburg’s Hor-
nets, 66-49,

“Lynchburg played a good, scrap-
py ball game,” explained Coach
Canfield. “We were flat, but I
didn't mind that.” The Generals’
mentor was pleased with the de-
fense. “The papers said they were
cold, but the fact was that we ap-
plied our defense better in the sec-
ond half.”

Something was applied to the
Hornets, who could only manage to
connect on 6 of their 35 last half
field goal attempts. However, a 20
point production at the foul line
kept Lynchburg in the ball game.

Mike Neer canned 21 points and
got 16 rebounds while Mike Daniel
connected for 20 points and collect
ed 8 rebounds. Stu Fauber added 11
points to the W&L effort. Mel Cart-
wright, on whom the Hornets did
an amazing “collapsing” defense
job, was held to only 4 points but
still managed 9 rebounds

Newlin Wingfield was the top

High-scoring sophomore Mike Daniel operates under the boards dur-
ing the home game against Rollins, the Generals’ second win of the

season,

Lynchburg point-maker with 15
tallies and 9 rebounds. Harold Mas-
sie contributed 10 points.

Once again the Generals outdid
their opponent in all departments.
Leading 29-17 at halftime, Washing
ton and Lee went on to out-rebound
the Hornets, 57-40, and to outshoot
them, 42% to 29%

Although Lehigh features a drab-
looking 1-3 record, Roy Heckman’s
Engineers are rated by Coach Can-
field as “one of the top four or five
teams on our schedule.” In addi-
tion, Lehigh will be making its first
home appearance of the season.

Ihe Engineers feature 6°6” 230-
pound captain Bob Fourtune, a pro
prospect who thus far leads the
team with an 18 point average
Fourtune scored 25 points against
Bucknell and added 23 in a game
with Temple
Waters and Scoit Beeten,
a pair of home-grown boys, add
luster to Lehigh’s attack. Waters
has averaged 14 points per contest
while Beeten has shot for better
than 10 points a game.

Lehigh dropped opening decisions
to Army, (74-61) and Temple (73-
70) but rebounded to top Bucknell,
75-66. Colgate defeated the Engi-
neers last Wednesday 68-57

The only previous match-up be-
tween these two schools resulted in
a Lehigh victory in 1914,

For the season, some statistics:
Mike Daniel, Mel Cartwright and
Mike Neer continue to pace the
generals offensively. Daniel leads the
team in scoring with 95 points for a
19 point-per-game average. The
sophomore has connected on 62%
of his shots. Neer has a 15.6 point-
per-game average, and leades the
Generals with 76 rebounds. Neer
has hit on 50° of his field goal at

bounds, (14 a game) and 88 points
(17.6 a game) is second in those two
departments, but the tall senior
leads the team in field accuracy with
a 66% mark.

But defensive efforts by the likes
of Norwood Morrison, Stu Fauber
and Ellie Gutshall have had their
influencing roles. Opposing teams
are hitting only 30% of their floor
shots; in addition, the Generals have
oul-rebounded the enemy, 273 to
214. W&L’s defensive measures
have limited opponents to a total
311 points, or 62.2 a game.

UFOC service
in R. E. Lee
Church tonight

Ancient ceremony used

PARTY FOR TOWN
CHILDREN PLANNED

At 7:15 p.m. this evening, a
Christmas Candlelight Service will
be held at Robert E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church. This event was
signaled by the ringing of church
bells throughout Lexington this af-
ternoon. The theme of the service
will be “Peace on Earth, Good Will
Towards Men”,

The service will consist of eight
lessons with carols—a_ traditional
form of service for corporate wor-
ship at the Christmas season, The
purpose of these lessons is to tell
the sacred history from the Crea-
tion of Man to the Incarnation,

This ancient form of service was
first revived for modern use at Truro
in Cornwall. It is annually broad-
east from King’s College Chapel in
Cambridge and is widely used in
schools and colleges in America as
well as England.

This year’s lesson readers include
Professor James Loesel, Lt. Colonel
Jack Morris, Dean John Mehl,
Dean David Sprunt, Maurice Leach,

Robert Herring, Robert Entzmin-
ger, Edward Bracken and Jeffrey
Spence.

However the custom is being
somewhat altered, for up until now
this form of service consisted of nine
lessons instead of eight. The final
lesson will be replaced by a period
of meditation which will allow par-
ticipants to pause and reflect on the
season’s meaning as well as the
Christian message in all, Thus the
service will provide a plea for uni-
versal peace and good will.

The John A. Graham Brass Choir
and the Washington and Lee Glee
Club will be participating in the 45
minute service. Also, the organist
for the evening will be Col. George
Ross. The service is sponsored by
the University Federation of Con-
cern,

The Christmas offering will pro-
vide support for the annual Christ-
mas Basket Program of the Rock-
bridge County Welfare Department

Thirty-one underprivileged  chil-
dren will be treated to a Christmas
party on Thursday afternoon, De
cember 18, at Central School. The
party is sponsored by the University
Federation of Concern jointly with
Lambda Chi Alpha and Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon. John McCardell, a
Lambda Chi involved in the plann-
ing, reports cheerfully that each
child will receive a present, and that
a Christmas tree and Santa Claus,
portrayed by Jim Gilliam, a Lamb
da Chi, will be provided,

The children are members of two
special classes for the underpri
vileged and slow learners, in age 8-
12 and 12-15.

Meanwhile, the University will
celebrate the holiday with two events
—the Troubadour production of
King Lear and the annual W&L In
vitational Basketball Tournament.

The Troub show will play tonight
through Thursday, with the curtain
raising at 8:30. The basketball tour
nament is slated for Thursday and
Friday nights with games at 7:00
and 9:00. The four games will be
played among a four team field

Committee for underprivileged reports,

Bev Reed is

Joe Tompkins called last night's
Executive Committee meeting to
order in Swede Henberg’s absence
Tompkins announced the following
EC meeting will be on Tuesday,
January 6.

The highlight of the meeting was
the subcommittee report from the
committee investigating the recruit-
ment of underprivileged students
Chairman Dave Bethea divided the
committee into five subcommittees
when the first meeting became “un-
weildly.” Fifteen to eighteen people
were present and five subcommitices
were formed to study improvement,
financial aid, admissions problems,
recruitment programs, and policy
relating to the underprivileged ap-
plicants.

Many of the subcommitices’ work
overlapped. Rob Schatz reported on
admissions problems. Pleas Geyer
reported on recruitment. Stuart Fau
ber reported on a proposed assimila-
tion program for underprivileged
students and Steve Robinson report-
ed on policy. Many proposals were
made and criticized by both the
Executive Committee and the fe
cruiting committee.

Actions on the proposals
tabled until after the Christmas
holidays. John Markham proposed

Glenn Miller Orchestra to be
featured at Fancy Dress Ball

Plans for Fancy Dress Weekend
have crystalized and the Dance
Board has announced that the week-
end’s entertainment will be headed
by the world famous Glenn Miller
Orchestra led by Buddy DeFranco.
The renowned band will appear Fri-
day, January 20 in Evans Dining
Hall. Dress will be black tie and
the theme has not yet been an-
nounced.

The Glenn Miller Orchestra was
established by the late Glenn Mille:
in 1937. For three and a half years,
the Glenn Miller Orchestra rode the
waves as America’s Number One
Band. Its liquid reeds with the uni
que clarinet lead, the ooh-wah brass,
the romantic ballads, the jumping
swing numbers, and the imaginative
novelties all combined to win mil
lions of fans the world over—both
young and old.

Among the more famous hits of
the original band were “Moonlight
Serenade,” “In the Mood,” “The St.
Louis Blues,” “Kalamazoo,” and
“Tuxedo Junction.” The Glenn Mil-
ler recording of the “Washington
and Lee Swing” is undoubtedly one
of the finest renditions.

Glenn Miller was killed during
World War II and the band was led
for ten years by Ray McKinley

Buddy DeFranco assumed the direc-
tion of the band shortly thereafter.
rhe orchestra has enjoyed their posi

tion as the largest record selling
popular orchestra in the United
States. Their records include “The

Glenn Miller Orchestra returns to
Glen Island Casino”, “The Glenn
Miller Orchestra ‘Makes the Goin’
Great”, and “Do you Wanna
Dance”, just released by Command
Records. The orchestra has receiv-
ed acclaim in Lake Tahoe, Cali
fornia, Las Vegas, and New York’s
Waldorf Astoria. The group has also
conducted hundreds of one night en-
gagements.

Buddy DeFranco has been recog-

nized by Down Beat and Metronome

by the Glenn Miller Foundation to
lead the Glenn Miller Band for his
mastery of his instrument and_ his
ability to emulate the “Glenn Miller

“Lear” to premiere tonight:
“A VISION of life and action”

By Lawrence McConnell

Fonight at 8:30 the lights will go
down on the audience in the Trou-
badour Theatre and will come up
on Act I, Scene 1 of a Shake-
spearian tragedy, So? If one could
make a survey of plays which are
opening on the week of December
15-21 in theatres around the coun-
try, at least 10 Shakespearian pro-
ductions would be listed in the tally.

The Troubadour production is ad-
mittedly insignificant in this re-
spect. So, the question becomes why
put on Shakespeare just because it's
Shakespeare? If the Troubadour
Theatre were producing “King
Lear” under this premise, they'd be
wiser tO save some money on their
light bills this week.

But the theatre is not “doing
Shakespeare” just because of some
maxim in theatre circles that it
should be done. Actually, by taking
on “King Lear”, the theatre is at-
tempting to re-orient one of Shake-
speare’s plays in particular and to
go against the grain of Shakespeare
imterpretation in general. Shake
speare is continually mangled by
two eXtremes of productions. One
group holds that Shakespeare must
“relate” to our up-to-date, ‘au cour-
ant, intellectuality and must of
necessity be staged with the intent
of revealing some undiscovered
meaning to our society. The other
group of people tend to force upon
audiences the plays as they would
have been produced in the 1590's
and 1600's, complete with “tragic
emotions’ and “how-now-brown

cow” rhetoric.

Both of these groups fail to pro-
duce good theatre, let alone good
Shakespeare. Trying to divorce it-
self from the playwright totally,
the former’s productions accomplish
an admirable separation, but the ali-
mony of meaning is irrevocably lost.
The latter is so betrothed to the au-
thor that the offspring to the produc-
tion is almost robot-like. The Trou-
badour production sidesteps both
these pitfalls, rejecting them for
what the play is: “a vision of life”
(to quote Kirk Woorward in the
Friday Ring-tum Phi, Dec. 12).

Once any statement is made con-
cerning what a Shakespearian play
is, criticism rears its eggshaped head
from all sides; but the current pro-
duction tries to avoid interpretation
and communication of any esoteric
meaning, and to present the “life”
in “King Lear”. The play is a story
of an old king who gives up his
land to his two older daughters,
denying the third any part of the
kingdom because she would not say
that she loved him. At the end the
old king after his youngest
daughter is hanged. Of course, this
isn't the whole story, but all of it
follows this general fairy tale type
drift. Fairy Sure—until you
see the characters come alive. And
this, finally, is the end result of the
Troubadours’ productions: to re-
enact the “True Chronicle History of
the Life and Death of King Lear
and His Three Daughters, .” to give
it life and action, not “relevance”

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, December 16, 1969

‘A clear mandate’

“A giant step was taken Wednesday in the direction of an
independent exam schedule,” reported the Friday Edition.
Let us hope that this optimism is warranted.

A gratefully large number of concerned students turned
out in the rain to express their opinions in favor of the pro-
posals of the Student Curriculum Committee. Ninety per-
cent of those voting indicated their belief that an independent
examination schedule would not unduly tax the Honor Sys-
tem. Ninety-six per cent favored the establishment of a sys-
tem of independent scheduling of examinations.

Chairman Chip Schooley of the Curriculum Committee
has stated that his committee in co-ordination with the stu-
dent body Executive Committee will now draft, for presenta-
tion to the faculty, a resolution endorsing an independent

exam schedule.

We feel that the faculty will mow recognize what Mr.
Schooley has called “a clear mandate” to them to move in
the direction of an independent examination schedule. This
should result in the formulation of a system of exam schedul-
ing which at long last will prove satisfactory to both the
faculty and the student body as a whole.

A representative at large

We commend the action of Mr. Bob Trout and the In-
terfraternity Council in petitioning the Faculty Executive
Committee to allow an IFC member to attend faculty meet-
ings. We fully agree with our Friday counterpart that such
representation is a basic student right and that it would fur-
thermore serve to remind the faculty of student interests in

their regular monthly meetings.

We also feel that the advantages accrued by such repre-
sentation would pertain to the student body as a whole.
Therefore, we question the wisdom of having a student pri-
vileged to sit with the faculty (should such a situation be ap-
proved), committed to a special interest group such as the

IFC,

We would like to express our belief that since a repre-
sentative of this type would by nature of his office stand for
the interests of the entire student body, then such a repre-
sentative should be elected by the entire student body, We
therefore encourage the Executive Committee of the student
body to investigate this issue with the perspective of the entire

student body in mind.

Lottery’s effect dissipated
Non incautus futuri

By C. Turner

What it has done to us is dis-
turbing. Should I say what it has
not done to us is disturbing? The
anxiety that psyched-up all of us
before the results of the lottery
were announced is now gone. That
question which affronted us all—that
was “real”. I'm sorry it has dissi-
pated.

Some of the people | know who
got a “fat” number are now trying
to figure out how to break their
ROTC contracts. Others are think-
ing of quitting school and traveling
maybe to Europe or Mexico. They
are out of it.

Many of those I know who got a
low number have accepted it as if
God himself (wearing a grey suit
and a dark tie) had drawn their
number from the fish bowl; or, at
least long ago, he set the thing go-
ing so that their birth was on such

Code for faint of heart

By Boh Webb

With the advent of the lottery,
many of us in the first third of the
list (1 am number 22) have found
ourselves wishing we had spent an
extra day or so in mother’s warm
womb, But such wishful thinking
must be abandoned as we turn our
thoughts to soldiering in an even
warmer Vietnam.

Who hasn't seen the blood and
guts John Wayne military hero re-
citing the “Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Conduct” in the cinema. His
rock jaw barely moves as he pledges
through gritted teeth to be loyal,
courageous, cheerful, thrifty, brave.

us are really like this? For those of
us who aren't, | have revised the

Swimmers win; marks fall

By Reeve Kelsey

Records fell as the blue swimming
team easily defeated Dickinson
College in their first home meet of
the year. Coach Stearn’s swimmers
now have a 1-1 record for the sea-
son. Freshman Alan Corwith shaved
four seconds off of the 200 yard
freestyle school and pool record as
he captured a first in that event with
a 1:44.6 second score. Bim Clark,
last year's most improved swimmer,
kept improving and seized the school
and pool record in the tough 200
yard butterfly event with a 1:59.5
second performance.

the Generals began their 62-42
victory with a stunning perfor
mance in the 400 yard mediey relay
finishing almost two lengths ahead
of the Dickinson team. Hal Catlin.
Price Blackford, Bim Clark, and
co-captain Roger Martin combined
in this event for a 3:42.4 finish. The
Generals kept the pressure on as
Hert Meem and co-captain Scott
McElroy went 1-2 in the second
event—the 43 length 1000 yard
freestyle

then came Corwith’s superb per
formance in the 200 yard freestyle
event followed by David Kympton
who captured a second in that race
After three events, the Generals had
a commanding 23-2 lead, and Coach
Siearn’s began to reiax the pressure
on the Dickinson team

Brumback glided to an easy first
in the SO yard freestyle event by
simost a body length in an event
more often than not decided by in

and such day and now the situation
has churned itself out according to
some secret order so that this is just
another war and as it happens now
they are supposed to fight it.

However, the lottery has merely
begged the question of the nature of
the involvement in Vietnam. As
long as the United States fights in
that small country, we are involved
and responsible whether or not we
are pulling triggers or bomb-sight
mechanisms, or putting another nic-
kel in and punching pinball flippers.
Even will-less passivity is a committ-
ment and is inexcusable. (P.S. Can-
ada is just another place.)

How long can we believe Presi-
dent Nixon's rhetoric: either, we
win and have peace, or the commies
will butcher all those nice inno-
cent people? Wouldn't you call the
user of massive fire power within a
civilian population a butcher?

Debate trophies number 101
im ten years; eleven for fall

Successful debating over the past
weekend has pushed the number of
trophies earned by Washington and
Lee University’s debate team over
the 100 mark for the past decade.

Washington and Lee’s debaters
won three of the eight trophies that
were awarded at the Madison Col-
lege Tournament in Harrisonburg.
The University of Richmond also
won three trophies, and the State
University of New York at Oswego
won two. W&L has now collected
101 trophies in the past 9% years.

W&L Debate Coach William W.
Chaffiin noted that in the past 10
years, Washington and Lee’s tro-
phies have come from as far north
as Dartmouth, as far west as North-
western, and as far south as Miami.

W&L debaters John Reynolds of
Houston, Texas and Kenny Murov
of Shreveport, La., along with Uni-
versity of Richmond debater Bob
Franks, tied for first-place speaker.
The Reynolds-Murov team also took
the second-place team award by
winning five of six debates.

Bill Radigan of Arlington, Va.
and Charles Smith of Louisville,
Ky., the second W&L team present,
won four of six debates and finished
fifth. Fourteen teams representing
eight colleges participated.

The Madison College tournament

Why do we believe a free-enter-
prise capitalistic democracy is best
for a small under-developed Asian
country? What right do we have to
impose it? Even if our assumption
is good-willed, why can we believe
the present ruthless military govern-
ment of Saigon will provide for the
poor majority, especially after the
mockery of that glorious election?

Meantime, we Gentlemen scho-
lars accept our H-S deferments
along with the entire system of “in-
voluntary” conscription with a very
narrow possibility of objection. Most
of us have never voted, just as the
nineteen year olds who will be
taken next year.

Dull-eyed, we have our coffee and
15-cent hot buttered English muffins
over the Post with a picture staring
up at us of a light grey-globbed
crumpled mass that once was a real
little boy in Son My.

John Birch advocates attend
Society’s eleventh anniversary

By Bill Melthany

On Friday evening, December
Sth, Jack Whipple and Bill Mell-
hany, both members of the fresh-
man class and the John Birch Soc-
iety, attended the Society's tith
Anniversary Dinner at the New
York Hilton. About 900 members
attended the dinner which is held
yearly to commemorate the found-
ing of the Society on December 9,
1958 in Indianapolis, Bill was the
guest of Jack's parents, Mr. & Mrs.
George Whipple, without whose

ches. Aven Sharp and Jay Marks
scored second place finishes in the
200 yard individual medley and the
diving to leave the score at 36-15.
The first event after the diving was
the 200 yard butterfly where the
Blue team again went 1-2 with Bert
Meem capturing the second behind
Clark's record performance

Mike Kirshbaum and Tom Mur-
ray scored seconds in the 100 yard
freestyle and the 200 yard back
stroke to raise the score to 51-27,
With 53 points needed to win, Dave
Kympton and John Benedict put the
icing on the cake going 1-2 in the
500 yard freestyle event. Kympton's
winning time was $:41,1,

Aven Sharp scored the last Gen-
eral points as he finished second in
the 200 yard breakstroke behind
Dickinson's All-America swimmer
Lou Shroyer, Rick Sands, and Ridge
Benton captured thirds in the meet

work in making the arrangements
for the dinner it would not have
been the wonderful occasion that it
was.

After the conclusion of the cock-
tail hour and dinner the program
consisted of short speeches by sev-
eral members of the Council of the
John Birch Society, the Society's
founder and leader Robert Welch
and such notable guests and mem-
bers as the distinguished Negro
journalist, George S. Schuyler.

After the speeches Jack and Bill
attended a reception in the suite of
one of the Society's National Di-
rectors of Public Relations where
they were able to meet and talk
with many of the Society's writers,
administrators and field staff. Of
particular interest were their con-
versations with Mr. Herman Dins
more, former long-time international
editor of the New York Times,
whose new book, “All the News
That Fits.” is a very knowledgeable
and very critical study of the manner
in which that newspaper reports the
news (the book is in the WAL Jour
nalism Library), and Mr. Lee R
Hayes, Chief Radioman of the
U.S.S. Pueblo and now a member
of and nationwide speaker for the
John Birch Society, who had many
frightening things to say about the
11 months of torture be endured at
the hands of his North Korean
captors. He said he joined the John
Birch Society because those 11
months made him into a confirmed

The Washington and Lee

Journalism Press Laboratory

noheiohehehoheteteotete

marked the end of debate activity
at Washington and Lee for the first
semester. The second half of the
season for W&L will begin after the
Jan. 30-31 Fancy Dress weekend.
This semester, Washington and
Lee’s debaters have been at 13
tournaments, debating every week-
end since the first of October, and
have won I1 trophies, including five
first-place ones. This is the largest
number the University’s debaters
have accumulated for so early in
the debate season, Chaflin noted.

Road guide aids
knowledge

of girls’ schools

Written primarily for single col-
lege men who sometimes travel for
dates to campuses that may be un-
familiar to them, “The Roadtripper”
is a 192-page paperback guide to 59
eastern women’s colleges from
Maine to Virginia. The book con-
tains information about restaurants,
entertainment and accommodations,
and gives the curfews, dormitory
telephone numbers and viisting hours
for each college. It also describes
from the young male viewpoint the
types of girls to be found at each
of the 59 schools and relates the
quality of campus life.

“The Roadtripper,” The Arcana
Guide to Eastern Women’s Colleges,
was published recently by a group of
Williams College students incorp-
orated under the name Arcana (the
feminine form of the Latin adjec-
tive for “secret”) in conjunction with
Young Market Instrumentation of
Boston,

The Arcanites — Tom Crowley,
Jules Vinnedge, Eric Kelly, Scott
MarArthur and Halley Moriyama—
organized the research methods,
hired a staff of student researchers
and writers, found a publisher and
organized the student marketing set-
up. They designed their own promo-
tional scheme as well, which includes
“Roadtrippers” posters and buttons

Every aspect of the project in-
volved difficulties, especially for
four young men enrolled in school
and active in college life. Finding
a suitable publisher was especially
taxing, because most established
firms were unwilling to go out on a

survey deadline

extended for all

Due to inconclusive resulis the
foreign Study Committee has decid
ed to extend the time in which
freshmen and sophomores can com-
plete the Committee's questionnaire
on the possibility of a foreign study
program at WAL.

According to Professor David
Dickens, of the German department
and chairman of the Committee.
students who do wish to complete
the questionnaires may pick up ex
ira copies from either Mr. Dickens
in duPont Hall or from Dr. Sidney
Williams in Robinson Hall

Dickens did state that the ques
honnaire survey had so far revealed
a surprising student interest in travel
im the British Isles

Dickens also added that this For

THE RING-TUM PHI Page 3
Blue splits pair this week AN R/C THEATRE

A thirty point win was added to
W&L’'s roundball record in friendly
Doremus. The home crowd was not
disappointed as the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers were out run and out re-
bounded by the score of 86-56
Highlights in the saw long
court length  assisis WE&L’s
big men.

Taking the tip Washington and
Lee University raced ahead with a
lead it would not relinquish. Mike
Neer controlled the opening toss-up
and much improved Mike Daniel
ended up with an unchallenged lay-
up.

light defense faced the Tigers at
the other end of the gym. Unable
tO penetrate the lane or get in
position for rebounding, Hampden-
Sydney tried to shoot W&L out of
the gym, but did not quite make it.
Ihe Tigers were largely limited to a

melee
from

single shot every time they jour-
neyed down the court.
Utilization of backcourt corps

kept the Generals moving the ball
and kept the score climbing. Oc-
casionally the opponents would hit
a couple of buckets in a row to
bring things a little tighter, but after
the second half, the game was out of
reach.

Defense and rebounding were
Washington and Lee’s most impor-
tant plus factors, The back line from
Farmville had a Herculean task ver-
sus the scrappy veterans Neer, Dan-
iel, and Cartwright. This scrappi-
ness led to rebounds and these re-
bounds led to a rout. Once again
the three Blue men underneath the
boards won the game.

Defensively Mel Cartwright play-
ed his best game of the year, and set
a school record with 9 assists. He
also had 22 rebounds, the majority
of which were defensive. All and
all “Magic” Mel played his predict-
able outstanding offensive game with
25 points, but his defense was amaz-
ing.

Against Lehigh things did not go
as well, at least things did not go so
well as far as the Generals were
concerned. Each team had the same
number of field goals but the score
was in the favor of Lehigh 85-71.
Floor mistakes combined with vio-
lations cost the game. The offense
just did not get into gear until it was
too late. Bob Fortune, Lehigh’s big
man, dominated the boards. Wash-
ington and Lee met a good team
with a good defense on a bad, bad
night.

Tarheels edee out WGL matmen

This year, as in the past, Wash-

itself felt as the Generals lost both
matches. On Friday night, Buford
pinned his man, Gow! won by for-

feit, Rasberry won by decision, and
W&L paced UNC by the score of
13-0.

However, the only other W&l
wrestler to win was tri-captain Dave
Higgins, and the Generals went
down by the score, 25-16.

Saturday night left the Generals
on the short end of a 24-14 score.

For this reason, hopes are running
high for W&L’s chances throughout
the season and, most important, for
her hopes in the CAC tournament.
But the lack of depth and an 0-5
record makes the going tough for
the W&L squad. But to quote Dave
Higgins, “Coach Miller recognizes
team problems and I respect very
much the way in which he is hand-
ling them.” We can all help Coach
Miller and the team by turning out
for their January 12 match against
Hampden-Sydney.

“It was thought that a freshman
is now placed in a market-place in
which he must make too hasty a de-
cision on joining a fraternity,” Dean
John said. “It was felt that ‘con-
sumer protection’ was needed both
for students and the fraternities in
that both need a longer time to
look around and to make rational
decisions.”

The delayed pledging system will
also be another step in providing
students with viable alternatives in
campus life, he noted. Other steps
in that direction include the Uni-
versity Center which opened last
fall, the liberalized dormitory social
regulations, and the plan to allow
freshmen to have cars.

The new policy, which will go

However, according to Director
of Financial Aid John Mehl, a cat

and will be considered with other
capital assets when the studeni ap
plies for a renewal of his financial

In announcing the gift, W&L

President Robert E. R. Huntley re-
marked, “Washington and Lee’s past

tradition and future aspiration is
to have among its students and
graduates men who, like Robert
Fortune, have that rare combina

tion of good intelligence, balanced
perspective, and fine character. We
are grateful for these important
gifts which will provide boosts to-
ward the continued development of
the University.”

After graduation, Robert Fortune

Colvin Withdraws From Race

Dr. Milton Colvin, who has taught
political science at Washington and
Lee since 1961, has decided that he
will not run in the Virginia Demo-
cratic primary against U.S. Senator
Harry F. Byrd, Jr.

In a statement Wednesday, Colvin
placed the blame for his decision
to withdraw on a lack of funds.
He explained that he had received
in the neighborhood of $25,000 in
pledges, but would most likely re-
quire another $30,000 to make the
campaign possible.

“I have gotten some money, but
not enough,” Colvin stated Wednes-
day, adding, “I think it unrealistic
to start out on a campaign with-
out adequate funding, and I think
it unfair to take enthusiastic sup-
porters down a political road when
there is a near certainty that by
April the bridge will be out.”

Emphasizing that it was almost
completely a matter of financial

worries which caused him to make
his decision, Colvin admitted that
he was leaving the door “a little
ajar.”

To stress this, Colvin added, “If
you're asking me whether I will
come into the race if someone were
to supply me with enough money,
the answer is yes, on a white horse!”

Arrangements with the admini-
stration to provide a replacement
for him during the spring semester
had already been worked out he
said, and there was nothing along
those lines to interfere with his
potential candidacy.

Earlier in the year, before Christ-
mas, Colvin issued a statement sum-
marizing his campaign as doing
“well in terms of support, bul poor
in terms of money. If you hold
the middle ground as | do, you
don't get money from either labor
or business. Even a ‘poor man's’
campaign will run a minimum of

Repeating this week his assess-
ment of a moderate’s problems
getting financial backing, Colvin
pointed out that no big interest, such
as banking, business, labor, and so
on, will support a political mod-
erate at the outset, preferring to
back either an avowed conservative
or liberal.

Since he has withdrawn, however,
Colvin stated that he personally
would like to see Democratic gub-
ernatoral candidate William C.

Professor Milton Colvin

Battle run against Sen. Byrd in the
primary. He also suggested State
Senator Henry Howell, Governor
Mills E. Godwin, Jr.> or George C.
Rawlings.

Of these men, only Rawlings has
expressed an interest in running. He
defeated former Rep. Howard Smith
in a 1966 battle in the Democratic
primary but then lost the election
Until this year he has been a mem-
ber of the House of Delegates.

Colvin—no stranger to the politi
cal scene—soughi a seat in the
House of Representatives from his
native Montana before coming to
WAL. He expressed, however, the
observation that the costs of that
election and the projected expenses
of this race were different enough
to make his earlier attempt almost
useless as far as gaining experience
in gathering financial support is
concerned

However, in this short
campaign, Colvin paid special at
tention to the students both here
and at other schools across the state
He said the students were always
enthusiastic and willing to work,
and he observed that “the response

assessing

of the students has convinced me
more than ever that Senator Byrd
will get very few votes of those

under 30.”

Besides the students, Colvin ex

Admissions Report

The report of the student sub-committee on admissions,
incomplete through they admitted it was, has to rank in
approach with among the most thorough, penetrating and
constructive studies we have seen undertaken here.

In substance, the sub-committee, headed by Dave Bethea,
proposed rather sweeping innovations in admissions, recruit-
ing and orientation programs in order to attract disadvantag-
ed students.

We were surprised to find presented such sound possible
solutions to a problem (that of excessive homogeneity in the
student body) the University has approached only with pro-
visional measures and therefore rather ineffectively. This is
not to say the report was simplistic. As nearly as we have
been able to discover, its proposals so far deal realistically
with the difficulty on both a long- and short-term basis.

The competence this sub-committee has exhibited will,
we hope, encourage more student study groups of this nature
and prompt the faculty and administration to continue in and
expand their policy of seeking student advice in important
matters,

Hopefully, it will also encourage interested students to
initiate their own studies when answers don’t seem to be
forthcoming from other sources.

The impact of the study will, if its proposals are adopted,
significantly alter, we believe for the better, the composition
and character of the student body and therefore of the Uni-
versity. Some kind of transition appears inescapable anyway.
Current trends in College Board scores indicate W&L’s
successive freshman classes, by standards the University im-
poses, are declining in ability. Thus to continue in the present
direction is to choose, consciously or not, a school for rich
boys dedicated to the “gentleman’s C” that has not been
the norm here for some time.

The sub-committee, it seems to us, offers the only al-
ternative to that trend. It proposes to bring disadvantaged
students here, by various means which appear effective to
us, in order immediately to provide for a more heterogenous
student body. The long-run effect, we agree, will be to re-
verse the disappointing trend in W&L’s quest for good stu-
dents from whatever economic class or location.

The greatest difficulty lies in the means to that end. The
sub-committee would propose that College Board scores,
which reflect in general the degree to which one has assimi-
lated the pervasive American culture, be de-emphasized in
favor of a more individual evaluation of specific applicants’
motivation and potential. Even if we did not consider the
overall result worth the chance, and we do, it nevertheless
seems to us that W&L, since its boasts personal attention to
each student, ought to operate more often on that basis
anyway. Certainly its size does not preclude the possibility.

We hope we have not prejudged this sub-committee’s
final report, nor that we have established an incorrect con-
text or emphasis for its reception. We have meant merely to
state our position and encourage a thorough consideration
of the report when it is complete.

Approaching Deferred Rush

The faculty Monday once again passed a resolution te-
quiring a deferred fraternity rush, and in conjunction
they have decided to allow freshmen cars beginning next
year. The latter is a constructive, if not altogether safe, ap-
proach to the social problems freshmen will face due to de-
ferred rush.

The social problems upperclassmen in fraternities are
going to face is another matter. Further diminished incomes
to houses already under financial stress, added to the pres-
sures rush during classes will incur for everyone, challenges
the fraternities through the Interfraternity Council likewise
to face the problem constructively and discover safegaurds.

So far, IFC reaction has been wholly negative. Dan
Leonard and IFC President Chuck Cahn argued prior to
the faculty vote that the fraternities should be allowed to
legislate their own reforms. We agree that this is the
optimum solution. However, fraternities, faced with the in-
evitability of deferred rush for several years, have done
nothing but stall and hope the dilemma would disappear.
It has not. Indeed, it reappears with increasing insistence and
frequency, and sooner or later IFC tactics will cease to prevail,

Recent action by the Judicial Board offers encourage-
ment that a collective solution to the increased financial prob-
lems may be found, although present recommendations deal
only with the current difficulties of most, if not all, houses
and offer no real solution to the diminished incomes result-
ing from deferred rush.

Moreover, the conflict of school work with rush will
have to be minimized, both for freshmen and for upper-
classmen, if either group is going to consider even the pos-
sibility of rush.

None of these difficulties is insurmountable if the IFC
adopts the same constructive approach to its problems that
the faculty took to alleviate the difficulties its action would
impose on freshmen. Recent activity in the IFC indicates that
a constructive approach may be adopted, but history leaves
us unconvinced.

By MONTY COTTIER

Ten years ago, the Ring-tum Phi
characterized the decade which was
then drawing to a close as one of
“great changes and _ important
events.” Strange as this might seem
to anyone who remembers what the
Fifties were like, and momentous
and innovative as these last ten years
have been, it should none the less
caution anyone who thinks that he
has seen great times (or, conversely,
very bad times) that they might
honestly have “seen nothing yet,”
as the Phi of 1959-60 put it.

For example, that year saw the
retirement of W&L’s president for
29 years, Dr. Francis Pendleton
Gaines. It also brought the news
that the IFC had developed a de-
ferred rush program, and wanted
the faculty to give it consideration.
The Mock Convention was held in
May of 1960, nominating the Mass-
acheussets senator, John F, Ken-
nedy. Dr. Sensabaugh retired as
Dean of the University to spend
his time teaching, and Dean Farrar
was named Director of Financial
Aid,

In 1960-61, the first issue of the
Phi proclaimed “75% Pledge!” and
warned of the impending doom of
the fraternity system if this trend
were not reversed. The IFC de-
ferred rush program was defeated,
and, also in connection with the
Rush Week activities, the ZBT’s
and the Phi Eps broke a long-
standing “gentlemen's agreement”
by rushing gentile boys and causing
dire predictions concerning the fate
of the fraternity system.

Dean Pusey was named Dean of
the College that year, the Robert E.
Lee Research Fund was establish-
ed, and Senator Barry Goldwater
came to Lexington to be the Contact
speaker for that year. Fancy Dress,
which in those days still called for
a costume and a theme, was billed
as being the best ever. The IFC
voted to end “Hell Week,” and the
plan was sent to the Faculty. It
passed, over a loud protestation that
the action would form the first step
in a plan by the faculty to kill
the fraternities. Plans were begun
to build a new science building, as
well as a new dorm complex. In
sports, Lee McLaughlin's football
players had an undefeated season.

The following year saw the be-
ginning of discontent, surfacing at
first in the EC itself, in attempts
to change the government of the
school. A poll tax of $2 was suggest-
ed, along with leadership tests, to
stimulate interest in voting (the poll
tax, collected during matriculation,
would be refunded at the polls) and
to insure that the candidates for
office would be qualified. Since, at
that time, the politics of the stu-
dent body were controlled by the
University Party, the Progressive
Party, and the Independents, this
idea was felt by the EC to be
superfluous.

Also in 1961-62, the EC sought
to have a Judicial Board established
to aid in determining various penal-
ties and to serve as a board of trial
and appeal, which was approved by
the faculty. The College Athletic
Conference was formed, the trustees

blocked a plan to have Martin
Luther King, Jr. speak at the school,
Professor Atwood was made Dean
of Students, and a student body
senate was proposed and defeated.
The IFC ended the second semester
by proposing a delayed rush pro-
gram, which was also defeated.

In 1962-63, the first news story
of the year told the upper-classman
that “75% Have Pledged,” and the
predictions of early deaths and free-
for-alls rising from the abolition of
the Jew-Gentile delineation were not
fulfiilled. In its first full year of
existence, the College Athletic Con-
ference’s All-’Round trophy was
captured by W&L, while the EC
did away with the option of volunt-
ary withdrawal from the university
rather than facing honor trials. The
only other major event in this
scholastic year was the retirement of
Dean Gillam and his appointment
by the trustees as Dean Emeritus.

In 1963-64, Dean Gillam’s post as
Admissions head was filled by Dean
Atwood, Pledging hit an all-time
low that year, with only 70% of the
freshman class signing with a house.
Former President of the university
Francis P. Gaines died in the fall.
He had been chancellor of the school
since his retirement in 1959.

After a year’s work in restoration,
Lee Chapel was reopened and re-
dedicated by W&L’s president Fred
C. Cole. The school’s support for
the magazine The Southern Col-
legian was withdrawn in quite a
bit of controversy. Conflict marked
this year, when the absence rules
were re-written; the Assimilation
Committee, which held the power
of probation and fines in enforcing
such rules as conventional dress and
the speaking tradition, came under
attack from faculty and students
alike: and the faculty passed ap-
proval for the new IFC constitu-
tion, which established the Judicial
Board,

Dr. Feddeman answered claims
and criticisms of incompetence to-
wards the end of the school year,
and the next issue of the paper
announced that due to an epidemic
of German measles Spring vacation
had been canceled.

The University Party once again
swept the elections, but there was a
considerable amount of criticism fol-
lowing this elcetion of the W&L
political system as whole. The Mock
Convention was held in the last
month of the school year, and nomi-
nated Goldwater.

The political system, under attack
in 1963-64, was significantly altered
the next year. The University Party
split. and re-appeared with a whole
new group of houses, Nine fraterni-
ties left whatever party they might
have belonged to and allowed their
members free choice in deciding their
ballots. The faculty ordered the
parties to hold primaries to de-
termine the candidates for the vari-
ous offices, so as to do away with
the practice of having caucuses, or
what the Phi termed “midnight bar-
gaining sessions.”

In a move which was surprising
considering the criticism aimed at
the Assimilation Committee the year
before, the student body voted to

keep the conventional dress tradi-
tion. At the end of the year, the
political situation was further con-
fused by the disbanding of the old
University Party.

1965-66 saw a reduction in the
number of pledges, and serious at-
tention given in the IFC to the
question of deferred rush, A study
was begun on the feasibility of hav-
ing girls in the dorms, while work
was begun renovating and enlarg-
ing the old Co-op. Recognizing a
situation which had existed for a
couple of years, the IFC voted to
abolish separate lists of Jewish and
Gentile freshmen,

The faculty committee requested
that the student body be polled
on the subject of a five-day week,
and was surprised to learn that the
majority of the students favored
keeping the old six-day plan. They
also considered the question of in-
dependent study and a_ shortened
term,

Funds for the Southern Collegian
were Officialy stopped, a plan was in-
troduced and passed in the EC to
establish the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, and, at the end of the year,
Steven R. Saunders became the first
rising junior in 30 years to be
named to the position of editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi.

In 1966-67, the Co-op was open-
ed. Associate Justice to the Supreme
Court Tom Clark spoke in Lee
Chapel, as did Tom Wolfe, who
graduated from W&L in 1951.

The EC recommended sophomore
dorms, then rejected its own plan

hi W&L’s 1960's: A Retrospection

at the end of the year, The fresh-
men adopted a class constitution,
which was voted down when pre-
sented to the Executive Committee.
The faculty called for the develop-
ment of a deferred rush proposal
by the IFC, and three houses were
convicted of hazing violations,

The 4.0 grade system was intro-
duced that year, replacing the old
three point plan. The first public
honor trial since 1938 was held that
year, and, at the end of the year,
Earl Mattingly, the school’s trea-
surer died and President Fred C.
Cole resigned suddenly. Law school
Dean Charles Light retired and was
replaced by law professor Robert
E. R. Huntley.

To replace Dr. Cole, the trustees
asked the next year if Dean W. W.
Pusey would serve as president pro-
tempore, which he did. The fra-
ternities were greeted with the news
that pledging was about average,
and the first year without the
separate lists for Jews and Gentiles
went off smoothly. Again, the IFC
presented its deferred rush plan,
which met with the same fate as
so many others of a similar nature.
Law School Dean Robert Huntley
was chosen as the next president
of Washington and Lee, to replace
retired President Cole.

Last year, 1968-69, began with
the death of head football coach
Lee McLaughlin. Early in the year
many changes were adopted, be-
ginning with the abolition of Satur-
day classes, which went into effect

Death of Black Panther
Indicates Police State

By DAVE OLSON

The Chicago Police Force has
again made itself famous with an
early morning raid a few weeks ago
on a Black Panther’s headquarters
in Chicago and the resulting death
of Panther leader Dave Hampton.
Whether or not he was murdered
remains to be seen but there cer-
tainly is disagreement on the events
that took place that morning.

The Panthers claim that Hampton
was murdered while sleeping in bed.
The police claim that he fired at
them when they entered his apart-
ment to confiscate an arms cache
and arrest Hampton. What is true
is that Hampton was killed in bed
for the blood stains prove that. The
Panthers have a film that they claim
shows that all the bullet holes in
Hampton's bedroom are entrance
holes which, they claim, proves that
Hampton was assassinated. It is my
belief that Hampton was murdered
but what is more important is the
fact that this raid points up a very
disturbing tendency among law en-
forcement bodies and in the office of
the Attorney General.

It appears to me that there is a
plan on the part of John Mitchell
and Richard Nixon to give the
country what is called “law and
order.” They plan to do this by
inceasing the size and sophistication

ROTC At The University

The College Faculty took an his-
toric step Thursday when it voted
to terminate degree credit for ROTC
courses, It was a step as refresh-
ing as it was unexpecied, for it
showed that the assembled scholars
can, on at least one matter, re-
evaluate old concepts and act to
meet the challenges of this era

Revocation of degree credit should
not, in any way, endanger the exist-
ence of ROTC programs here, a
fact which was probably most in-
fluential in affecting the vote. The
contracts with ROTC staie that some
form of academic credit must be
afforded the military courses. Three
undergraduate professional schools
here still offer full credit: and the
College still offers academic credit.
ROTC courses and grades still ap
pear on the transcript. H's just that
academic credit isn't worth much if
you can't use it to apply for a de-
greee (which leads to an interesting
paradox),

Non-faculty observers were almost
certain before Thursday's meeting
that the faculty would pass one of
the proposals that would only have
referred the matier to a commitice
for more study, and it's interesting
to speculate about why the vote
went as it did. There seemed ito be

no set departmental or interest-group
pattern to the voting. Perhaps the
public relations blunder of the Army
in bringing fourth-year man Paul
Bishop to a hearing had something
to do with it. But the most prob-
able explanation is that all the dis-
cussions about the theory and prac-
tice of a liberal arts education had
led many faculty members to be-
lieve that the surest way to subvert
a liberal arts curriculum is to allow
10 per cent or more of it to be
taken from the ROTC departments.

In any case, degree credit for
ROTC is gone, and its depariure
could have some interesting repre-
cussions, Here at the University.
ROTC will entail a lot more work
enrollment will almost certainly go
down unless the departments make
an effort to replace their courses
with analogous offerings within the
University, Lec. a management of
psychology course in place of a mili-
tary leadership course, and leave the
sirietly mililary subjects to summer
training,

In the Pentagon, the College Fac-
ulty’s decision could start the brass
thinking about revision of the entire
ROTC program. When Ivy League
schools dropped ROTC credit, it
didn’t hurt the national program too
much, But Virginia has always been
considered a model ROTC institu-
tion. And, it is a Stale university.
It may well be thal the example set
here Thursday will be more potent.
will serve notice io the military
establishment thai the old credit
arrangements may be out of date
at more schools than a few radical
northern institutions. If this is the

case, the outcome can only be im-
provement of the existing program.

Al any rate, we eagerly await the
outcome of the committee appointed
to investigate the ramifications of
removing academic credit for ROTC
courses. The committee, which will
make its report no later than the
April 1969 (sic) meeting will hope-
fully reconcile the faculty's present
paradoxical stance and get down to
the real issue: should the faculty
award academic credit for what are
essentially non-academic courses?
We trust the Commitiee’s answer
will be “no” and that the College
faculty will deny academic as well
as degree credit for ROTC courses

of law enforcement agencies and
by this intimidate many extremists
groups to stop their activities. The
strange thing is that the “silent
Majority” is perfectly willing to let
this go on, for they think it is the
solution to the problem. It is not
the solution to the problems that
the country faces today. It is obvi-
ous that the Nixon Administration
misunderstands the problems.

When they decide to stop the
Black Panthers with force they are
attacking an effect rather than a
cause. The Panthers were formed
to protect Black people in this
country. The reason the panther was
chosen as a symbol is because he
is an animal that fights only when
cornered. This is what the Panthers
are all about. They are easily the
most misunderstood group in Amer-
ica. There is something wrong with
the way black people are treated
in this country and the problem is
not going to be solved by killing
off the Black Panthers. Nor is the
problem of riots in the inner city
going to be solved by increasing
the strength of Police reaction. We
have to attack the causes of the
riots, not just the riots which re-
sult from the deterioration of the
urban condition. If greater Police
action stops riots or stops the Black
Panthers, the problem of Urban de-
cay and hatred of the white estab-
lishment will remain.

The most disturbing thing is that
the Nixon administration really fails
to see this point, or even worse they
do not want to see it. I feel that
the administration is trying to create
a conservative reaction in this coun-
try which will insure Nixon's re-
election but | aiso feel that the
law enforcement bodies of this coun-
try will become overly strong and
the result could be something ap-
proaching a police state. Under the
guise of law and order and sadly
without the knowledge of the “Great,
Silent Majority” this country is be-
ing led down the road to even
greater division and hate than now
exists; and the murder of Dave
Hampton is a very large warning
beacon. | only hope that enough
people see it in time and end their
silence.

Swimmers Sink Catholic

Thursday evening before vacation,
the W&L swimmers defeated Catho-
lic University by a 59-46 margin.
This is the first time that W&L has
defeated Catholic in seven years,
Freshman Alan Corwith led the
charge winning two individual events
and participating in a winning relay.

The 400 yard medley relay com-
bination of Hal Catlin, Price Black-
ford, Bim Clark, and Bill Brumback
scored a quick first getting the Gen-
erals off to a 7-0 lead. John Lawlor
followed with a first in the 1000
yard freestyle with a 11:32.2 second
performance. Corwith then won his
first event setting a new school
and pool record in the 200 yard
freestyle with a 1:43.4 mark. Bill
Brumback and co-captain Roger
Martin then went 1-2 in the 50 free-
style so that after 4 events the Gen-
erals had a commanding 26-8 lead.

Ray Hammond and Jay Marks
captured second and third in the
diving. Bim Clark bettered his school
and pool record time that he set in
the Dickinson meet, but Catholic
swimmer, Harry Carey, was even
faster, setting a new pool record in
the 200 yard dolphin butterfly with
a time of 1:58.9.

Tom Murray, John Lawlor, and
Price Blackford then scored seconds
for the Generals in the 200 back
stroke, 500 freestyle, and 200 breast
stroke. Alan Corwith and Roger
Martin went 1-2 in the 100 yard
freestyle.

The Blue natators had a 51-46
lead going into the last event, the
400 yard freestyle relay. Whoever

could win this event, would win the
meet. W&L put forth its best team
of Bim Clark, Roger Martin, Alan
Corwith, and Bill Brumback who
performed a fast 3:08.6 less than
one second off the poll record
The Catholic victory boosts the
General's record to 2-1, while Catho-
lic, the Middle American Confer-
ence swimming champions, now
have a 1-2-1 record. Tomorrow the
Generals travel to the University of
Virginia. Most of the swimming
team members returned Friday be-
fore school started and were swim-
ming up to 6,000 yards a day to
get into condition for the U.Va.
meet, Last year Washington and Lee
and the University of Maryland were
the only schools able to defeat
U.Va. who won the state champion-
ship swimming meet. W&L was un-
able to participate in this meet.

Speaking My Mind...

Daniel leads

Washington and Lee pulled away
in the second half behind the red-
hot marksmanship of sophomore
Mike Daniel to hand Bridgewater a
997-4 defeat last night.

Daniel, working primarily under
the basket, put in 26 points and
grabbed seven rebounds while
flounting a 69% fioor percentage.
Senior Mel Cartwright added 18
points and 13 rebounds to the Gen-
erals’ cause. Big Mike Neer, held to
six points led the team in rebounds
nevertheless. Bill Rhyne collected 13
points and John Glace twisted and

turned for 12 more.
Washington and Lee was suc-
cessful on 51% of its floor shots

while amassing 64 rebounds. Bridge-
water managed only 37 rebounds
and hit only 28 of 70 floor attempts
for a 40% average.

Ron Cook led the
15 points while Dennis Woolfrey
and Rick Wampler contributed 12
points each. Bob Boyle led Bridge-
water on the boards with a dozen
rebounds,

With the Generals leading 36-30,
and with 2 minutes remaining in
the first half, Daniel put in three
straight field goals to stake W&L to
1 42-32 halftime lead. In the sec-
ond half the Generals minimized

the following semester. The IFC
drafted another deferred rush pro-
gram, which was vetoed by the
faculty and withdrawn for rework-
ing. The 12-12-6 study plan, under
consideration by the faculty for
some time, was adopted that year,
to become effective for the year
1970-71, Distribution requirements
were also changed that year, and
plans were drawn up for addition
onto Doremus Gymnasium.

President Huntley was inaugurated
in the late fall of 1968, around the
same time that the EC’s “Bitch-In”
meetings began. Senator George Mc-
Govern was the Contact speaker,
and Hugh Downs came to Lexing-
ton to speak at the annual Phi
Beta Kappa Convocation. At the
end of the year, Dean Atwood left
his post as Dean of Students to
become the Dean of the Commerce
School.

In his first full year as president
of the university, Huntley proposed
at the Opening Day ceremonies this
past fall a program of expansion for
the school. A new library, a new
Commerce School building, and
dorms were all presented as pos-

Starr in the ‘67 classic riddled the
Chiefs’ defensive backfield with his
passes and it might be an ominous
indication for the Kansas City team
that the man most victimized that
day, Willie Mitchell, is still back
there and will be trying to knock
down those Kapp aerials.

On the other hand Dawson will

year combined their skills to create

a better passer than Kapp, but it
won't make any difference in this

The IFC has once again been re-
quested to formulate a deferred rush
plan, and is in the process of doing
so. The University Student Center,
opened this year, has its own com-
mittee of students to regulate the
complex according to the wishes ex-
pressed by these students. New
efforts are being made to broaden
the base of the W&L student body,
bringing in students from all walks
and all parts of the country.

The decade, as a whole, is one of
increasing student involvement,
which is reflected accurately in the
manner of writing and the story
content of the Ring-tum Phis from
various years. Where ten years ago
the whole paper was occupied with
comic strips, ads, and reports of
social functions, today’s paper is
likely to be one of a long chain
of symposia on the honor system,
student problems, and changes either
suggested, rejected, finalized, or
under consideration. Where six
years ago it would have been con-
sidered improper to be seen with-
out a coat, tie, and vest on, and an
appearance without a coat and tie
would have been grounds for pro-
bation and a fine, we may be near-
ing the day where the coat and
tie is an anachronism rather than
the rule. Whether or not these
changes were for the best is not
clear: that they were definitely
changes, and that the 60’s saw a
great many of them, will be ap-
parent to anyone who considers the
contrast between 1949 and 1959,
and 1959 and now.

and Barbra Jean Love
are Friends of Distine-
tion who aim to warm

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 13, 1970

Number 25

Merger is planned for newspapers

The Publications Board recently
adopted sweeping changes concern-
ing the character of The Ring-tum
Phi, including consolidation of the
two present Editions effective March
:,

The proposed changes came after
a month of intensive self-study of
the newspaper by a four-man Publi-
cations Board subcommittee compos-
ed of the two current editors. Bob
Entzminger and Bob Yevich, Pro-
fessor Paxton Davis, faculty repre-
sentative, and Reed Byrum, Calyx
Business Manager.

The Board approved the resolu-
tions of the subcommittee that be-
ginning with the first Thursday in
March, The Ring-tum Phi be pub-
lished once a week by a combined
staff, and that beginning for the
academic year 1970-1971, the Board

Friends of Distinction to perform before
Friday night audience at Fancy Dress

Plans for Fancy Dress Weekend
reached the terminal stage when it
was confirmed that the Friends of
Distinction would appear in the Fri-
day night concert. This completes
the lineup for W&L’s biggest social
event of 1970.

The nationally acclaimed Friends
of Distinction will be followed by
Buddy DeFranco and the world
famous Glenn Miller Orchestra on
Saturday night. The band of renown
will perform at the Fancy Dress
Ball from nine until one o'clock,

Fancy Dress President Martin
Bass has announced that the theme
for the 1970 Fancy Dress Ball will
be Camelot. To effect such a theme,
Evans Dining Hall will undergo a
dramatic change. The ten columns
will be adorned with coats-of-arms
and the balcony, where the faculty
is traditionally seated, will be deco-
rated as a jousting box. Plans are
still being contemplated for a back-
drop behind the orchestra. Black tie
will be in order for the occasion.

Assembly Notice

The Lee's Birthday — Founders’
Day Convocation will be held at
noon on Monday, January 19, in
Doremus Gymnasium. No examina-
tions will be held on this day.

Professor Norman A. Graebner,
Edward R. Stettinius Professor of
History, University of Virginia, will
deliver the address.

Attendance of all students is re-
quired. The faculty will wear aca-
demic costume. Students are request-
ed to be in their seats before 12
o'clock so that the assembly can be-
gin promiply. The faculty will as-
semble in the basement of Doremus
Gymnasium at 11:30 to robe for
the procession.

€

During the second week of Feb
ruary, the “maleness” of all-male
Washington and Lee will be chal-
lenged. The ancient masculine at-
mosphere will be broken by the
sound of feminine conversation and
the sight of mini-skirts

Brought to the campus by “Con
tact", 120 girls from Mary Baldwin,
Hollins, Randolph-Macon and Sweet
Briar will become Washington and
Lee students for the week of Febru
ary 8-14

The 120 girls will be the center at
traction of the first “Coeducation
Week” at 1400-student WAL. The
University is currently pondering
whether coeducation should become
a permanent feature of the Lexing
lon campus

Coed Week will be offered a» part

of the fifth annual “Contact” pro
gram, “Contact”, a week-long sym
posium series, is operated by the

Contact Committee
through the Interfraternity Council
to stimulate intellectual debate and
discussion of pressing issues

In addition to initiating this limil
ed experiment in coeducation at
WAL, the “Contact” program will
once again bring to the campus the
popular intellectual symposiums fea

Speakers slated for this year’s
program include: Ramsey Clark, al

The Cock-pit will be open dur-
ing the Ball and students will be
able to drink beer within the tav-
ern, Stronger spirits will be pro-
hibited on the premises.

The Fancy Dress Vice-Presidents
have also been announced. They
are Chuck Dobbins, John Miller,
Dan Leonard, Charles Stone, Homer
Gamble, John Philips, Ken Wallace,

Foster Galliard, Steve Waldron,
Waugh Crigler, and Bob Entz-
minger. They will be introduced

with the fraternity presidents and
the Fancy Dress President by Presi-
dent Huntley.

The University cocktail party will
be from 2:30-5:30 p.m. at the Herit-
age House and gin fizzes will be
served, departing from the cus-
tomary grain bunch. The Embers
will perform.

Following the cocktail party on
Friday, the Friends of Distinction
will perform at Doremus Gym at
8:00 p.m.

The Friends of Distinction made
their professional debut at the Daisy,
one of Hollywood's top discothe-

ques. There they attracted the at-
tention of actor Jim Brown who
signed them to his management

firm. They have since recorded the
hit singles “Grazin in the Grass”
and “Going in Circles,” and their
third album is scheduled for release
in April. The group consists of
Harry Elston, the group's writer:
Floyd Butler: Jessica Cleaves: and
Barbra Jean Love, daughter of the
famed west coast D. J. Reuben
Brown.

Phis past summer the Friends of
Distinction produced their second
album “The Highly Distinet
Friends of Distinction.” Among its
hits are “It's Sunday,” “Let Your-
self Go,” “It's a Wonderful World,”

“Why Did I Lose You,” and “This
Generation.” Their first album
“Grazin” based upon the notable hit
of Hugh Masekela, “Grazin’ in the
Grass.”

Fuxedos will be offered for their
rental by the Oak Hill Costume
Company of Staunton, Virginia in
the main meeting room, No. 114, of
the Student Union; representatives
from the company will be present
from 1:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m., on
Wednesday, February 14. Those stu-
dents who have not had the oppor-
tunity as yet to rent attire for the
Fancy Dress Ball will be able to do
so al this time.

lickets for both nights will be on
sale in the Co-op,

elect one Editor-in-Chief for the
newspaper.

The weekly edition will be pub-
lished in a format of six pages with
a possible reduction, if necessary, to
four pages during the proposed short
term periods.

The Board also passed a resolu-
tion stipulating a more systematic
and dependable manner of circula-
tion for the paper, as well as a cor-
responding increase in the press run.
In keeping with this resolution more
copies of each edition will be distri-
buted to the Commons, fraternities,
and the Law School. It was also de-
cided to purchase distribution racks,
such as those used by commercial
papers, to be placed in the co-op,
Library and Student Center.

In order to facilitate the transi-
tion of authority to next year’s Edi-
tor, the Board decided to effect con-
solidation in March. This will allow
two months of experience in pub-
lishing a six-page weekly before the
new Editor takes over in May, The
paper will be under the joint editor-
ship of the current two Editors after
March 1.

Since the undergraduate member-
ship of the Board will be reduced
beginning next year, the Board voted
to abolish the position of alumni
representative at the end of this
year. However, to give the Publica-
tions Board greater continuity in the
future, the term of office for the
position of faculty representative
was lengthened from two to five
years.

The Board also adopted certain
guidelines pertinent to qualifications
for election to the editorship, staff
organization, and editorial respon-
sibility.

Six general reasons were cited in
the subcommittee report for fe-

IFC ponders Contact, rush

By Mack Woodward

The IFC discussed several topics
of interest last night: the amend-
ment to their constitution, the de-
layed rush program, and Contact,

The proposal which provides for
the direct popular election of the
president of the IFC was passed.
This election will take place at the
same time as the elections normally
held in the spring.

Although no action was taken, the
council did discuss the delayed rush
program. Suggestions were made for
the way rush is to be conducted. A
concentrated rush, such as we have
now, will be discouraged, although
one or two days of open houses
could possibly be held before classes
start. President Cahn called for any
ideas from each of the houses and
urged that they be brought before
the next IFC meeting.

commending consolidation of the
two Ring-tum Phis. They are as fol-
lows:

1. The consolidation of the two
present staffs would improve the
overall qaulity of writing in the
paper, since more time would be
devoted to writing and editing copy.

2. The paper would serve its read-
ers better by providing enhanced
coverage of newsworthy events,

3. The danger of being under-
staffed during the short-term periods
would be lessened with an enlarged
staff,

4. The increasing cost of publish-
ing The Ring-tum Phi; a six page
edition would show a savings.

5. Problems of distribution and
readership of the Friday Edition
(because of the five-day class week)
would be obviated with a Thursday
Edition,

6. These recommendations would
enhance the status of working on
The Ring-tum Phi both as Editor
and especially as an underclassman.
Understaffing has become an_in-
creasingly difficult problem over the
past few years,

quire constitutional amendments, Of
the four, two were brought to a
vote and one passed.

The tabled motion had been in-
troduced by Freshman representa-
tive Alan Prater and concerned the
composition of the EC should mem-
bers leave for short term study. An-
other motion was passed to form a
permanent standing committee to
study planning and development.

The other two topics concerned
the status of the Ring-tum Phi. The
first gave EC approval to the es-
tablishment of a single weekly Ring-
tum Phi this spring. The second topic
was a motion and was defeated. It
dealt with the Executive Commit-
tee’s financial and policy-making
supervision of the Publications
Board.

Prater’s proposal sought to rem-
edy a possible future dilemma in
the event that EC members might
leave campus during short terms.
Prater asked that such an Executive
Committeeman be replaced by the
President of that class, and, in the
event that both representatives were
gone, that the second space be filled
by the class Vice-President. The mo-
tion was not brought to a vote in
order that the EC could consider
other alternatives such as the in-
stitution of special elections

Student Body Vice-President Joe
fompkins proffered a motion
drawn up by the subcommitice on
planning and development. It called
for the institution of a permanent
standing committee called the Stu
dent Planning and Development
Committee and would be headed by
a three man steering committee of
EC members.

These members would serve one-
year terms and could succeed them-
selves. The committee would be
filled out by the four undergraduate
class presidents and a Law School

Publications Board President
Larry Honig presented a Board re-
solution to the EC for its approval.
The resolution is described in the
above article and concerns the con-
consolidation of the Ring-tum Phi
and changes in editor's salaries.
There were no objections as the EC
approved the measures.

Following this, Honig asked that
the EC move along the lines of an-
other Publications Board resolution
calling for a special committee to
annually determine the Board's
share of the student tax, and to end
the EC's powers of appellate juris-
diction over that Board. It was felt
that such a check in the hands of the
EC might ultimately lead to Execu-
tive Committee manipulations in
editor elections and censorship of
the Ring-tum Phi.

The section moving for financial
independence from the EC was de-
leted after the full motion, proposed
by Kevin Baker, failed to receive a
second, The revised motion would
have removed only the EC's ap-
pellate jurisdiction over Publications
Board actions. Because it would en-
tail a constitutional amendment. a
two-thirds vote was required for
passage. Kevin Baker proposed the
motion and Alan Prater seconded it.
The measure fell two votes short as
Azuma, Baker, Bethea, Ogilvie, Pra-
ter and Thompson voted for it while
Dobbins, Kumpuris, and lfompkins
opposed it. Bill Andrews abstained.

THE RING-TUM PHI

THE RING-TUM PHI

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition
Tuesday, January 13, 1970

Maintain admissions standards

Staff Editorial

While we share The Friday Ring-tum Phi’s encourage-
ment for the student subcommittee on admissions’ endeavors,
we do question the objectives of that group.

We are cognizant of the valuable educational experience
that we at W&L are being deprived of, the experience of
gaining associations with students from different racial and
socio-economic backgrounds than our own. We realize the
college should be a full learning experience, and that ex-
perience should not be limited to the classroom. We also
realize the social responsibilities that make seeking such stu-

dents imperative.

We failed to note the “rather sweeping innovations in
admissions, recruiting and orientation programs” that The
Friday Edition alleged were discussed. We also failed to
recognize their report as ranking “in approach with among
the most thorough, penetrating and constructive studies we
have seen undertaken here.” We were impressed with their
enthusiasm and the range of their ideas.

The report consisted of five reports from the subcom-
mittees appointed by Executive Committeeman Dave Bethea.
The reports were rhetorical and did not include any formal
proposals; only tentative avenues of research.

One point that was repeatedly brought out by the speak-
ers was the necessity for the University’s Admissions Office
to “change” the admissions requirements. This was cited as
necessary in order to attract underprivileged applicants,
specifically blacks, since W&L cannot compete with the Ivy
League schools for the applicants who would qualify under
present admissions policies. The term “change,” said the
speakers, does not necessarily imply lowering admissions

standards.

We feel that a “change,” as such, would imply a lowering
of admissions standards. Spokesman Pleas Geyer cited an
example of a high school senior in northern Virginia in a
rural school district who had an SAT total score below 800
and, until recently, had a troublesome scholastic record. The
student had been interviewed by a W&L faculty representa-
tive who discovered that he had a great intellectual curiosity,
and he was recommended highly to the admissions depart-

ment.

Geyer recommended using different criteria in interpret-
ting students’ applications and suggested that such a student
as the above would be a good prospect for Washington and
Lee. We feel that using a criterion such as intellectual promise
alone would ultimately lower the school’s academic standing.
This is certainly not fair to the students who entered W&L
to compete with other students of their own intellectual
capability and receive the kind of stimulation afforded by
that kind of competition. Also, it is certainly not fair to
bring a student to W&L with a comparatively deficient educa-
tion and expect him to compete with his fellow students.

We applaud the subcommittee on admissions on their
determination to take up a task that should have received
attention long ago. However, we urge them to act with
restraint in recommending admissions department policy. We
feel that W&L is in a position to seek underprivilged students
that qualify under present admission standards. The Uni-
versity can offer financial aid to these students and this sub-
committee judiciously plans to seek more. Certainly, every
qualified underprivileged student is not going to Harvard,

Yale, or Princeton.

Coeducation: a week now;
a reality in the future?

By LAURENCE M, HILLIARD
Columnist

In my first column for the Ring
tum Phi, written a little less than
one year ago, | presented some argu
ments for coeducation at Washing
ton and Lee. At the time it was
just a pipedream, Next month, co
education will become a reality, at
least for one week

Coeducation Week was the fore
runner of coeducation at Princeton,
Yale and other colleges steeped in
+ wnisexual tradition, It could be
the same at WAl

On hundred and twenty college
beauties—30 each from Hollins,
Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon Wo
men's College, and Mary Baldwin
will descend upon the WAL campus
for the week of Contact Besides
enjoying the excellent speakers lined
up for Contact, th WAL coeds will
stiend classes and do everything else
the WAL gentleman does, (Well just
about everything’)

Of course this doesn't mean that
we can look forward to coeducation
next year, First the University plans
to cooperate with seven other non
coeducational colleges im an ex
change program: if the Board of
Trustees approves the program. Such
in exchange program will bring 40
students from other colleges to WAL
for one vear of study while send
ing 40 WAL. students to other col
leges. The program will be experi
ment in coeducation, and hopefully

it will lead to the Real MeCoy

Coeducation Week is part of a
progressive trend that has swept the
campus during the past four years
My freshman year, the big deal was
the elimination of Saturday classes
on dance weekends, Since then, we
have witnessed th total elimination
of Saturday clasess, the introduction
of pass/fail courses, liberalization
of distribution requirements, parent-
ials in the dorms, complete elimi-
nation of restrictions on student
ownership of automobiles, and start-
ing next year, a new academic
calendar that will allow independent
study and of course the exchange
program

Also, the new Student union was
completed and, if | can believe Bill
Tyler, and | assume | can, con-
struction will begin on the new
gymnasium in early spring

This progress—and it is consid
erable progress——is due to an en
lightened faculty and a concerned
student body, The WAL stud is now
concerned with more than just get
ting down the road every weekend
He is concerned with what is hap
pening around him on campus and
in the world

Changes, where they are needed,
will continue at WAL, because the
days of total student apathy are in
the past. And before too long it's
posible that the WAL student will
not have to go down the road to
get a date

Co-op’s Cokes
top a thousand,
milkshakes 500

The lines in the Washington and
Lee University fight song, the
“Swing,” begin: “When Washington
and Lee men fall in line. . .”

It doesn’t refer to the chow line,
but it well might,

Just for snacks, the University’s
1,400 students—aided by some fac-
ulty and administration members—
consume 180 hot dogs, 80 ham-
burgers, and 40 cheeseburgers a
day.

Approximately 100 chicken salad
sandwiches go over the counter,
along with almost that many egg
salad sandwiches.

Add to the daily menu 20 pounds
of french fries, 100 cakes, five dozen
English muffins, assorted things to
nibble such as ¢@rackers and potato
chips, and specialty sandwiches
such as roast beef and corned beef.

All this is washed down with
1,000 sodas, 500 milkshakes, about
10 gallons of milk, nine gallons of
orange juice, and 450 cups of coffee.
(It's one of the country’s few re-
maining S-cent cups of coffee.)

Those quantities of food and
drink are dispensed daily at the
Snackbar of the University Supply
Store. The figures would be astro-
nomical as well as gastronomical if
they included the full-fledged meals
taken at the University Dining Hall,
the 18 fraternity houses, apartments,
and private dining establishments in
or near Lexington,

“The hot dogs start selling the
first thing in the morning,” said Mrs.
Famie Smothers. During her 17
years of service in Washington and
Lee snack shops, Mrs. Smothers has
learned to take such exotic student
dining habits as the 7:30 a.m. hot
dog breakfast for granted.

Mrs. Smothers has the busy job
of keeping the Snackbar supplied
with enough food to feed the
hungry between-class hordes.

At another location on campus,
short-order sandwiches, along with
beer, are being served for the first
time this semester. The new facility
is the tavern of the University
Center, which opened this fall.

Political and social interests of
college students may fluctuate, but
“no matter what college you go to,
you're going to find plenty of
hungry students,” quipped James E.
Toler, manager of the University
Supply Store.

Toler, a native of Hopewell, was
for six year the manager of a book
store and snackbar at Ferrum Junior
College. He came to Washington
and Lee last summer from a posi-
tion as assistant manager of the
Salem-Roanoke Valley Civic Center
in Roanoke.

Student apartments in farmhouse
burned in holiday conflagration

For Washington and Lee students,
the end of Christmas vacation sig-
nals the beginning of exams and
the start of another long semester.
That is a sobering enough experi-
ence for most students, but the re-
cent experience of seven W&L sen-
iors is without precedent.

PiKA fourth-year men, Razz Ras-
berry, Mel Cartwright, Tom Rob-
son, Bryan Baldwin, Bert Roby,
Pete Wilson and Bill Wigglesworth
left for home anticipating a happy
holiday only to have their hopes
ruined on December 23 by news of
a fire in their Lexington apartment
the night before.

The seven had been living in a
spacious ten-room farmhouse on the
Maury River, but the holiday fire
burnt it to the ground in what the
Lexington Fire Department term-
ed as “one of the most complete

Deferred rush and autos
threaten intellectualism

By MACK WOODWARD

Last Monday, the faculty approv-
ed two measures for next year: an
extended rush period of seven weeks
and the approval of freshman cars.
While these measures are liberal
changes, they do not seem in keep-
ing with the faculty's policy of pro-
moting intellectual activity on this
campus,

The extended rush period, while
giving both the fraternities and the
freshmen a better chance to ac-
quaint themselves with one another,
will present a problem in its length.
Seven weeks will cover more than
half of the first semester, which will
be oniy twelve weeks next year.

Under the present rushing sysim.
there is only one class day during
the rush period. Undoubtedly,
formal rush parties will be held
only on weekends, but informa!
rushing will no doubt take place
Monday through Friday as well
While this places a burden on the
freshmen, it places an even greater
burden on the upperclassmen con-
ducting rush, This can only lead to
a further diversion of the atientions
of fraternity men, attentions which
would be better spent on academics,
especially toward the end of the
rush period when many mid-semester
hour quizzes will be taking place

The issue of freshman cars, like
deferred rush, has its superficial
benefits: freshmen will not be forced
to join a fraternity just to meet
people who have cars so that they,
too, may go down the road, Fresh
men, however, are an eager and
generally irresponsible bunch. (This
is not to say that there are not
sophomores, juniors, and seniors
who are completely removed from
this category.) All have been under
either their parents close watch or
the even closer watch of a boarding
school, They tend to be a bil more
relaxed and lew conscious about
their studying. At WAL, freshman
grades on the whole have been de
clining for at least the past three

years. With easier access to a car,
freshmen will be even more tempted
to let their assignments build up
and their grades drop.

Either of these factors adopted at
separate times would call for a
period of adjustment; taken together,
these measures pose a major prob-
lem. Rush is all too material in
many aspects now; decisions are
made based upon well-adjusted ties,
the proper tweeds, and even Dun
and Bradstreet ratings. It is incon-
ceivable that some—if not all-—fra-
ternities will not rush certain men
upon the basis of their owning a
car and the type of car they own.
This is certainly no sound basis for
selecting pledges

The motivation behind the pas-
sage of these two measures is cer-
tainly not to promote intellectual
activity While there are other bene
fits to be reaped from college ex-
perience, intellectual activity is the
primary reason for obtaining a col
lege education

The Tuesday

burns we've ever seen.” The cause
of the blaze is as yet undertermined.

All of the students returned early
hoping to be able to salvage some-
thing, but found nothing but a
charred frame and toppled bricks.
Thus, they face the incredible task
of replacing items valued at close
to $19,000. The losses include
clothes, component stereo systems,
televisions, guns, furniture and,
most importantly, all their notes
and books.

One of the group was lucky, how-
ever. Bill Wigglesworth had been
occupying a remodeled smokehouse
in the back of the main building.
Most of his possessions were in this
building which was untouched by
the flames.

The other six are now living in
scattered apartments and in their
fraternity house. They are attempt-
ing to get settled before what
promises to be a difficult’ exam
period. Efforts to locate more perm-
anent housing for second semester
have so far proved unsuccessful.

The boys liivng in the farmhouse
were not the only ones to be upset
by the blaze. Pikas have lived in
the “farm” for several years with
each graduating group of tenants
bringing in a new bunch of under-
classmen. Through the years im-
provements were added and it be-
came a gathering place for Pikas,

Need for pride
seen as helpful
to W6EL legacy

By LARRY HONIG

It feels good to return to writ-
ing for W&L’s version of the mass
media—my effort, though, will not
be in the realm of things pro-
vocative for those are best left as
perquisites of the Editor.

I choose to make public my long-
standing (and obviously futile) dis-
taste for the less sublime but more
obvious personal characteristics of
what is becoming too large a seg-
ment of the student body. I am
referring to the _ briefly-lamented
death of the speaking tradition and
conventional dress.

For those readers who have not
quit by having dismissed me as an
Establishment Ass, let me continue.
C. Turner is a senior here—he was,
long ago, an SAE; since those “old
days,” C. has turned to (among
Other things) voicing the individu-
al’s right to dress as he pleases, ete.

But unfortunately for W&L, C.
Turner's example has been only
partially emulated. We have, | would
guess, about 600 or more students
today (about 595 more than when
I was a freshman) who 1) are never
courteous, and 2) usually dress be-
low any reasonably civilized stand-
ards,

These people, however, fit none
of the criteria set forth numerously
by C. You see, C. speaks to people,
even if he doesn't like them and
even when he thinks he might not;
he greets fellow students, professors,
and visitors alike—lI’ve seen him—
with casual cordiality; and he doesn't
go out of his way to look bad—
never a tie, to be sure, but then
again, never personally offensive
clothing.

Those who would say “So what”
or “big deal” or “go to hell” are
those to whom this article, those
qualities, and, ultimately, this Uni-
versity are meaningless except in a
very narrow concept. If I may be
allowed to repeat what you must
have expected me to say. It doesn't
hurt to speak, and to dress neatly.

Establishment? Well, think about
it in your half-million-dollar Student
Center—or in class: you could go
to State U. and on the difference
in tuition feed ove million starving
Biafrans for a yeay.

It seems to me that there is some-
thing more to non-formal education
than your beliefs, prejudices, and
philosophy, and that's inter-relation-
ships serving in the past to generate
a fantastic pride in this University.

At a loss for noble words myself,
permit me to quote from an article
by Professor Gunn in the Student
Handbook:

“Almost all students want this
University to be distinctive. It is
an ironic fact that many would
forfeit the very things that have
given it distinction, rather than
make the small effort needed in
adjusting their personal habits to
mainiain the high standards of
the past,”

It would be most helpful to the
legacy of this University if more of
her students could develop some
pride in values more permanent than
proving to themselves they know
where it’s at.

Benefits of work-study program

Through my own observations
and afier talks with several stu
dents, it has come to my attention
that, in some instances at least, the
term “work-study” is a misnomer

Some students who enjoy the fi
nancial benefit of this program are
finding that they not only do not
study in any real sense but they
also have to do menial jobs which

are paid to do. This in itself is
perhaps not so reprehensible as the
fact that some of these students are
treated much like hired help with-
out intelligence or self-respect

There is absolutely no reason for
any professor to degrade or em-
barass a student in front of his
fellow classmates Teachers are
human and do lose their temper at
times, But when they “jump on”
a student triyng to do his job for
them, they not only lose all respect
in that student's eyes but they also
lose a great deal of dignity in the
eyes of the students who happen
to overhear the outburst

Instances such as this are by far
the exception to the general rule.
but when even one student comes
home after working in the afternoon
and he feels embarassed and angry
because of what he considers an
injustice, then the student-faculty
relationship suffers

If a professor feels that a student

making uncalled for mistakes,
then he should admonish that stu
dent in a gentlemanly manner. Too
often a student says “ves sir” in
reply to a comment which does not
reflect the respect which the “sir
implies. Then too professors ca
studenis “Mr. Smith” when “little
bov" would be much more approp
ite. But as always, a person's feel
nes should be considered first, and

H

if this is done perhaps sweeping a
floor for the third time in one day
can even be ironically amusing

W&L scuttles Navy

In last year’s basketball season
W&L squeaked by Navy 60-59.
Many felt that Navy was truthfully
surprised by that young upstart team
from Virginia. It was agreed on
that this year Navy would be wait-
ing on the Generals’ invasion and
the better team would surely win
this time. Well that is exactly what
happened. A_ better team from
Washington and Lee ran stunned
Navy out of their own gym in the
second half to the tune of 70-56.

In an effort to beef up W&L’s
schedule with more major college
competition, Coach Canfield had
singled out Navy this winter, The
midshipmen were a fine team. This
year the Middies challenged power-
ful Kentucky at Kentucky and were
turned back by a 14 point margin.
If you want to compare scores that
is the same edge the Generals tal-
leyed against Navy. But regardless
of Navy's ability they could not lick
Washington and Lee’s discipline and
ball control.

John Conrad sparkplugged the
Naval Academy attack in the first
half. Outside shooting was a dis-
appointment for the Navymen and
their whole offense stagnated. The
pressing defense developed by the
home squad did cause turnovers but
could not halt an aggressive bunch
from Lexington.

For the boys in blue ball control
was the key in the first 20 minutes,
Rebounding was not quite up to
par but nice passing and heads-up
play kept the Generals on top by a
pair of field goals 37-32,

Ellie Gutshall ingnited an offen-
sive show in the second half. The
speedy sophomore hit the open man
accurately and crashed the boards
like a giant. Ellie's play encouraged
the rest of the Blue team and things
were going Washington and Lee’s
way for the remainder of the game.

Neer went to the boards more
with his sidekick Mel Cartwright.

U.Va. wins meet

Ihe General natators, unable to
put down a late Cavalier rally,
were defeated by a 55-49 margin
for their second loss of the year.
Freshman Alan Corwith and Bim
Clark continued their record break-
ing season setting new team records
and U.Va. pool records in the 200
yard freestyle and butterfly events.

The graduation of All-American
Billy Ball and the weakness in the
backstroke and breaststroke events
was apparent as the Cavaliers swept
the last three events— the 200 back-
stroke, 500 freestyle, and 200 yard
breastroke—capturing both first and
second in these events. The Gen-
erals led in the meet until the last
three events when U.Va. pulled
ahead.

The 400 yard medley relay team
of co-captain Roger Martin, Price
Blackford, Bim Clark and Bill
Brumback won the opening event
John Lawlor followed with a second
in the 1000 yard freestyle. Corwith
then won the 200 yard freestyle
with his record breaking perform
ance of 1:53.2 seconds. Both Brum
back and Clark had a 23.2 second
time in the 50 freestyle, but the
judges gave the first place to Brum-
back. Catlin then scored a second
in the 200 yard individual medley
Going into the diving
had a 26-16 point lead

U.Va. swept the first two places
in the diving. Bim Clark and Bert
Meem then captured first and third

his resulted in a single shot for
the Navy team. Neer used his size
and jumping ability to successfully
intimidate the Middies into poor
shots,

Foul trouble killed the Annapolis
five. A bonus situation developed
early in the final period. Not being
a team to let opportunity pass it by,
W&L cashed in on 25 free throws
at the foul line. With Navy’s start-
ing quintet in foul trouble, Wash-
ington and Lee exploded.

Isolating the Navy defenders was
Canfield’s plan. His offense was
based on individual man-on-man
plays and ball control, Poise and
alertness neutralized the press in-
strumented by Navy most of the
game.

he balanced scoring went like

this: Daniel 16, Cartwright and
Neer 14, and Morrison 8.
Last night W&L demolished

Emory and Henry 82-52. Utilizing a
man-to-man defense and a 1-4
double low post offense, the Gen-
erals scored at will.

Emory and Henry could not get
back on defense quickly and this
hurt the visitors. Bill Rhyne and
Ellie Gutshall hurried the Generals
down the floor. The black line re-
bounded excellently especially on
the defensive boards. Outside shoot
ing was another plus factor for
Washington and Lee with Gutshall,

nothing but nylon,

In the closing minutes many of

hitting

the relief players did well. Dave
Stone, Paul McClure and John
Glace kept the ball rolling for

W&L.

The key to the win was an ex
plosive offense. The fast break and
fine shooting made the difference.
Speed and bench depth are definite
assets for Canfield’s corps this year

Home loss pinned gn wrestlers

WA&L’s varsity wrestling team once
again met defeat as they went down
to the forces of state rival Hamp-
den-Sydney. After a long Christmas
layoff, the team seemed sluggish as
only three men men were able to
win individual matches. Wade Goarl,
Bill West, and Dave Higgins scored
the only Washington and Lee points.
Credit should also be given to fresh-
man Mike Newcomb.

The highlight of the night came
as tri-captain Dave Higgins pinned
his man. The match was_high-
lighted by fast thinking and quick
moves. After one such move, Hig-
gins could be seen hastily stuffing

cigarettes into his jersey. We are

Dance Board purchases speaker
system to alleviate audio problems

The Dance Board has purchased
a new speaker system for its con-
certs in answer to numerous com-
plaints by the student body con-
cerning audio difficulties.

In an attempt to improve the
quality of the concerts, Dean Kum-
puris, president of the Dance Board,
has sought during the past several
months a solution for the poor

in the 200 yard dolphin butterfly.
Clark’s record time in this event
was 2:11.9. Corwith then won his
second individual event of the day,
the 100 yard freestyle with a 51.9
time. The Generals now led 39-31
and the roof fell in. The Cavaliers
won the 200 yard backstroke, the
500 yard freestyle, and clinched the
overall victory by winning the 200
yard breaststroke. Martin, Corwith,
Catlin, and Brumback then com-
bined to win the final 400 yard free-
style relay.

The General's record now stands
at 2-2 as they begin their exam

sound system. After much investiga-
tion Kumpuris contracted the Moses
Company of Little Rock, Arkansas
to fufill the audio needs of Doremus
Gymnasium in the most adequate
and economical manner.

Two Klipsch La Scala speakers
were purchased and will be placed
on the right and left sides of the
indoor track, facing the entrance to
the athletic complex. This speaker
model, k-447, is a_ high-efficiency
low-distortion system covering a
wide range of frequencies with an
unusually smooth response. Bass
range extends to 50 cps, usable to
40. In spite of the quality, size has
been brought to such a minimum
as to classify this speaker system
as a “miniature” among speakers
of this style. Although the woofer
unit occupies only 8 cubic feet, the
response, range and efficiency equal
or exceed systems of considerably
larger size. This loudspeaker affords
the same efficiency, smoothness of
response, and freedom from distor-
tion as the Klipschorn but the bass
cutoff is approximately 20 cps
higher. It has 40-19,000 cps range
and a 70 watt capacity.

The Klipsch Corporation is one
of the finest producers of hi-fi com-
ponents in the nation; its products
have been exhibited by the United
States in the Brussels World Fair
and the Moscow World Fair as fine
cratsmanship in hifidelity. It is
based in Hope, Arkansas and is the
producer of the Klipschorn.

news from the
world of music

By GENTRY FERRELL

“The Masked Marauders,” a new
album rumored to feature Lennon
and McCartney, Dylan, George
Harrison, and Mick Jagger in some
sort of super-coalition, is a colossal
put-on. None of those illustrious
figures appear but their individual
styles do receive excellent treatment
in what may become one of the
year’s best-selling albums.

Bob Dylan is particularly well
treated in original Masked Maraud-
ers’ compositions such as “Cow Pie”
and “More or Lee Hudson's Bay
Again.” “Cow Pie,” an instrumental,
is very reminiscent of “I Threw
It All Away” on Dylan’s own
“Nashville Skyline” album, while
“Hudson’s Bay” is so akin to his
“Tell Me That It Isn't True” that
this writer wonders seriously whether
The Band, Dylan's former back-up
group, was involved in the produc-
tion of this new album.

Jagger's frenzied style is duplicat-
ed in “I Can't Get No Nookie” and
the Marauders’ version of “Season
of the Witch” captures the styles of
Blood, Sweat and Tears, the now-
defunct Buffalo Springfield, and the
guitar of Beatle George Harrison.
Even the high-camp “Duke of Earl”
receives an enjoyable fresh treat-
ment,

“The Masked Marauders” is sig-
nificant not only for its approach
to standard rock styles but also be-
cause it brings into the public view
a new group of talented musicians
who, without the fanfare of the
‘super-coalition’ rumor, might other-
wise have gone unnoticed. Their
efforts on this album indicate that
they have the potential to become
a successful group without the
trappings of imitation, secrecy and
public speculation,

News From the Music World:

The Beatles’ “Get Back” album
should be released sometime this
month. John Lennon says they will
probably never tour as a group
again, despite rumors that they
would appear in Baltimore next
month . Burt Bacharach and
Hal David, composers of “Promises,
Promises” and “I'll Never Fall in
Love Again” for Dionne Warwick,
will soon set up sessions with B. J.
Thomas ... Films of the Rolling
Stones’ concert in San Francisco
have been subpoenaed by a Cali-
fornia court because they show a
fatal encounter between a black
youth and Hell’s Angels . . . Rumor
has it that Blood, Sweat and Tears
will appear at Central Virginia Com-
munity College in Lynchburg. Ne-
gotiations are under way .. . The
‘West Indies Sound’ is big in Eng-
land now and may hit U.S. later
this year Led Zepplin has
received another gold record, this
one for “Led Zepplin HL.”

| Students Exhibit at Osaka |

A recent art exhibition in Osaka, Japan included the works of three
Washington and Lee students, David R. Katz, Langdon C. Quin, and
William Chris Bauer. The exhibit was sponsored by the Osaka Private
School Art Society, and included works from Hong Kong, Korea,
Indonesia, and Japan. Washington and Lee was the only American
institution of higher education to have its student's works exhibited.

Washington and Lee University’s
Board of Trustees has authorized
the University to undertake im-
mediate construction of a $3,000,000
addition to Doremus Gymnasium
and renovation of the existing 54-
year-old athletic facility.

A base construction low bid of
$2,552,000 submitted by the J. S.
Mathers, Inc., construction com-
pany of Waynesboro, Va., was ac-
cepted from among seven general
contractors whose bids were opened
Jan. 13 by university officials.

Additional equipment and fur-
nishings, architects’ and engineers’
fees, and other related expenses are
expected to raise the total cost of
the project to nearly $3,000,000, uni-
versity officials said.

Action by Washington and Lee’s
trustees, announced recently by the
Board's rector, Dr. Huston St. Clair,
was taken at their regular winter
meeting, held this year in Atlanta
on Jan. 16-17.

Dr. St. Clair described the gym-
nasium project as a vital initial step

forward in Washington and Lee’s
plans now under development to
provide essential growth in physical
facilities and endowment during the
next decade.

“The Trustees and university offic-
ials face many important decisions
in the months ahead before the exact
scope and dimension of this de-
velopment program can be de-
termined, but we are convinced that
the construction of this gymnasium
addition constitutes an encouraging
beginning on such a_ challenging

Gym Construction to Start

program,” Dr. St. Clair said.

“The inadequacy of our indoor
sports facilities at Washington and
Lee has been a matter of concern to
us for many years,” he added. “We
are delighted to be able to move
ahead toward the satisfaction of this
pressing need, thanks to the active
support and encouragement of many
good friends of the university whose
gifts for the gymnasium have been
among the largest ever received by
Washington and Lee for capital im-
provements,”

Dr. St. Clair said first priority
was given to the gymnasium pro-
ject because of its necessity for
proper support of Washington and
Lee's broad intercollegiate, intra-
mural, and physical education pro-
grams, and because commencement
of the gymnasium addition could
take place independently of other
decisions on physical planning now
being formulated.

Construction is expected to begin
at once, with completion projected
for 18 months later.

Among new facilities to be pro-
vided in the addition are a new
basketball arena with an ultimate
capacity of 3,000, a new swimming
pool, handball and squash courts,
team dressing rooms, and general
locker areas and supporting facili-
ties.

The existing basketball and swim-
ming facilities in Doremus will be
retained, and the structure will be
extensively remodeled to provide
improved offices for the athletic de-
partment staff, physical education
classrooms, and related facilities.

Architects for the project are
Clark, Nexsen, and Owens, Inc., of
Lynchburg, Virginia.

W&L School of Law
Redesignates Degree

The degree granted by the Wash-
ington and Lee University School
of Law has been redesignated the
Juris Doctor (JD) degree. Roy Lee
Steinheimer, Jr.. Dean of the WAL
law school, anounced recently.

The W&L law faculty voted to
change the degree’s title to JD in
place of the Bachelor of Laws
(LLB) degree, and the University’s
Board of Trustees has approved the
change, Dean Steinheimer said. The
Student Bar Association of Wash-
ington and Lee has also favored the
concept of the JD degree.

Dean Steinheimer noted that the
change to the JD degree is in
keeping with the trend at many of
the nation’s leading schools of law.

“The degree will be granted re-
troactively to all graduates of the
law school who request that the
degree be given to them,” the dean
said. “Thus, more than 2,000 alumni
will be eligible to receive the JD
degree.”

As far as current WAI
denis afe concerned.

law stu

the first JD

degree will be awarded in early
February to students who complete
graduation requirements after the
first semester of this academic year.

In changing from the LLB to the
JD, Washington and Lee has “made
no change in the basic curriculum
leading to the degree, or in require-
ments for the degree,” Dean Stein-
heimer said.

The philosophy behind the trend
to the JD degree is that completion
of a law degree requires seven years
of study—the four undergraduate
years culminating in a bachelor’s
degree and then three years of law
school,

“It is felt that to
another bachelor’s
three years of study beyond the
undergraduate level is a bit re
dundant.” Dean Steinheimer noted.

In Virginia, the law schools of the
University of Virginia, the Unive:
sity of Richmond, and the College
of William and Mary have also re
cently gone to JD degree designa-
tion.

On Limiting Power

It is infrequent at best that a powerful body limits it-
self without the impetus of a serious threat from an outside
source. The Student Body Executive Committee Monday
demonstrated just that magnanimity, and we don’t feel
our own involvement in the issue invalidates our approval
of their move.

Their vote was to end the EC’s powers of review and
appeal over the Publications Board on matters of policy
while retaining some de jure financial control. It is not re-
markable that such a separation between student govern-
ment and the student press should find sympathy in some
quarters, nor that the Publications Board should advocate it.

As a matter of fact, many properly found it more sur-
prising to discover the extent of the EC’s powers in this area.
But at any rate, the EC might have rationalized from past
experience to justify retaining their power, even though it
has never in anybody’s memory been exercised. We were,
therefore, gratified at their decision to end the inherent
danger and separate the institutions.

The EC’s financial control over publications is in prin-
ciple at least nearly as uncomfortable a situation as their
powers of review. Yet for the present, we can arrive at no
workable alternative, and until the threat manifests itself
more clearly than it ever has, we consider the arrangement
an acceptable one.

The issue, of course, is not settled. It requires a consti-
tutional amendment, on which the student body will vote
during the Big Four elections. But we are confident the
matter will be deemed important enough to warrant the
turnout necessary to pass the amendment and assure
autonomy for the student press.

A New Department

During exams the University announced the division ot
the Department of Fine Arts into a Department of Arts and
a Department of Music and Drama, It simultaneously re-
vealed Prof. Junkin’s retirement as department head, and
the appointment of Prof. Doyon to head the Department of
Arts and of Prof. Robert Stewart so direct the Department
of Music and Drama.

On several counts, this division was long overdue. The
former grouping was arbitrary and unwieldly, and as a result
every aspect of those disciplines included suffered from
neglect. Especially the music and drama portions of the de-
partment (at least until this year) were peripheral and at-
tended usually only by students involved in the Glee Club
or Troub Theatre, respectively.

The department's division offers the possibility to ex-
pand course offerings in these neglected areas and therefore
to bring those sub jects to the attention of a wider portion
of the student body. But that is going to require increases
in personnel which the administration needs to effect im-
mediately if it is going to capitalize on the opportunity it has
afforded itself.

Finally, A Fancy Dress

We hadn’t planned to use this space this year to review
dance weekends, but we do consider this year’s Fancy Dress
worthy of comment.

A lot can be said against the idea of Fancy Dress in
general, but given its existence, we don't think it could have
been much more entertaining, tasteful, or better organized
than Marty Bass and the Dance Board made it. Especially
when viewed in the light or last year's hasco, the weekend's
latest version can be called a crashing success.

Unfortunately we cant draw any cosmu conclusions

from the simple tact that for once Fancy Dress was a well-run

weekend, but we do hope it isn't the last one,

Letters to the Editor

A Word From Dr. Colvin
fo the Editor, the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

Since the Friday Edition was kind
enough to endorse my abortive can
didacy for the Senate seat, I think
it only fair to use their edition to
thank the many students who offer-
ed to help in any campaign I might
wage. An astonishingly large num
ber of students did come to me and
did offer their services and I wish
through this notice to thank them,

Simply, | thought it unfair to take
enthusiastic supporters down a
political road when I knew that the
bridge would be out by April. But
there may come a better day and
enthusiasm will be needed then.

Those who have it, please keep it.

Professor Milton Colvin

On Admissions

lo the Editor, the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

There are some points in your
editorial in a December issue en
titled “Admissions Report” which |
wish to discuss,

Unlike you, I hope that you
have, in fact, “established an in
correct context or emphasis” con
cerning the report of the subcom

mittee on admissions. If the report
does recommend what you say it
does, and if it is accepted and
adopted by the Admissions Office,
WAL is going to be in much worse
shape than it is now.

Your statement seems to be rather
self-contradictory; you state that the
average SAT scores of each suc-
cessive freshman class have been
declining, and say that this is bad.
But in the same editorial, you also
state that SAT scores should
be de-emphasized in considering ap-
plicants. This doesn’t jive.

You say that more underprivileg-
ed students should be admitted; this
is good. I myself, along with many
others in my freshman class, as well
as in the other classes, would not be
able to attend W&L without our
financial aid. But now you say you
want to let in underprivileged stu-
dents without judging them on the
same academic basis as every other
WAL student was judged on when
he applied. Is it really worth lower-
ing the academic standards of the
entire university merely for the sake
of admitting more so-called under-
privileged and most likely less in-
tellectually gifted students?

I say, with a firm belief that |
am not alone, that every student
who applies to W&L should be
judged first on his academic ability,

W&L Class Reports

By MONTY COTTIER

Last Tuesday, February 3, the
United States Senate Subcommittee
on Disaster Relief of the Commit-
tee on Public Works heard a report
from the W&L Class on Research
Methods in Politics and Sociology
concerning the flood last August in
the Blue Ridge area and what fre
actions it caused. The report was
presented by Homer Gamble, who
worked along with David Field,
Christopher Habers, George Hamlin,
harles Holt, Thomas Metcalf,
Joseph Raine, and Robert Skinner
under Dr. William Buchanan to pre-
pare the survey.

The report itself deals with
losses due to the flood only briefly,
ind also only insofar as these losses
apply to the 98 persons interviewed
as the sample. Of these 98, the
rreatest loss to any individual was
forty thousand dollars, and the
average loss was around six thous
and dollars. The total loss for the
irea around Buena Vista. where the
survey was made. was in the neigh
borhood of $1.7 million.

Rather than spend a great deal of
me and attention to the statistics
of loss and repayment, however, the
class devoted most of their study to
the reactions ol the people to the
flood and the efforts of relief work
ers afterwards

In this area, they asked the per
sons being interviewed who they
thought ve the greatest amoun

of aid to the flood’s survivors. Of

~

those questioned, mos! in the lower
half of the economic scale said that
the Red Cross was the top source of
repayment, while of those in th
upper half, only about 50% felt this
was true

in the area of reactions to the
flood, many people were cited a

fore, if the aid organization would
set out the specifics of their aid
programs in the same manner, the
report states, such criticisms might
be avoided

The Richmond Times-Dispatch,
covering the hearing, stated that “a
Washington and Lee student pro
vided the subcommittee with its
brightest moments of the two-day
hearing.

“Homer F. Gamble read a report
prepared by him and seven other
W&L students who surveyed por-

which is best indicated in a vast ma-
jority of cases by his SAT scores
and his high school record, and
second to this by his economic back-
ground and the degree of so-called
“heterogeneity” he would add to the
student body. W&L is fortunate that
it has sufficient funds to do this.

Undoubtedly some people will
bark “What about those people
whose SAT scores and high school
records are not true reflections of
their actual ability and potential?”
Well, many of us may well have
been in the same boat when we
applied to colleges for admission as
freshmen. Perhaps this is the rea-
son why we are not all at Harvard,
or Yale, or wherever we may have
wanted to be. But then, as some
blind idealists fail to realize, no
system is perfect, and the Admis-
sions system at W&L is no excep-
tion,

[ agree with your statement in
that I do “encourage a thorough
consideration of the report when it
is complete.” I only hape that the
Admissions Office will seriously
consider the possible consequences
if the proposed policy, as your edi-
torial states it, is in fact adopted.
W&L would certainly follow in the
footsteps of so many other schools
in successfully obtaining “heterogen-
city,” while at the same time lower-

to Senate

tions of the disaster area in Vir-
ginia, stating that among. other
things the survey concluded that the
agencies that provided the most as-
sistance to disaster victims were the
most criticized.”

The Washington Post, on Wednes
day, ran an article in which acting
chairman Spong was quoted as
stating that “the report could serve
as a model for the Red Cross and
other agencies in seeking better ways
to communicate with disaster vic-
tims,”

 

ing its academic standards,

I hope that there is a_ better
alternative.

Let me stress that it is not the
idea of the subcommittee of which
I disapprove; | am all for it, and
intend to work for its goal. It is
only unacceptable if it is truly what
you stated it to be. I think you
have jumped the gun on publicizing
it and presented it in the wrong
way, but all of us at W&L should
be concerned about it, at least
enough to find out what it truly is,

Pat Hinely

A Farewell to W&L

fo the Editor, the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

Never in my life have I been
happier or more content than here
at Washington and Lee. Entering
in the fall of 1966, I was filled with
the usual fears and anxieties of an
incoming freshman, but these fears
quickly dissipated. Getting to know
people and making friends seemed
to come particularly easy here, and
the loneliness and homesickness that
had been frequenting me disap-
peared.

Perhaps, the only bad side of my
life at W&L was not being here.
In the summer of 1967 there was
this accident, and I was out of
school, flat on my back, for a year
and a half. You can’t believe how
1 looked forward to returning to
WAL last semester, even if I was
the oldest sophomore on campus.

Now, I'm married and just can’t
afford W&L any longer. Therefore,
this semester will be my last as
a member of the student body. This
is the reason for my letter. Not
addressed to any one person of
group of persons, this letter is meant
for the University as a whole, and
its intent is to thank Washington
and Lee for some of the happiest
years of my life.

What's a career with a social conscience?

Quite simply, one that offers responsibility and chal-
lenge on the one hand. And social involvement and
commitment on the other.

One that can be financially satisfying without sacrifie-
ing emotional values.

One where progress is based on performance and
merit.

In short, the kind of rewarding career that a company
like Prudential offers you,

Our basic business, of course, is to protect the basic
unit of society—the family. But we've extended our
social involvement to helping fight urban decay and
unemployment

By investing in new businesses and new factories.
y 5

By providing funds for low-cost housing. And, in
addition, our people provide the leadership required
to build hospitals, colleges, and libraries.

In short, Prudential is concerned with not just life
itself, but with the quality of life. This is the kind
of company we are. And not by chance, but by choice,

If you're a socially-conscious graduate, we'd like to

have you join us In marketing, management, invest-
ments, applied computer technology, accounting, sales,
or actuarial areas.

as people take life too sertously

Up to this point, Contact’s Co-ed
Week has been marked by three
special events. The first of these oc-
curred Monday afternoon with a
seminar on “The Responsibility. of
the Intellectual Elite in Communi-
cations,” conducted by Prof. H,

This week complete live cover-
age of all major Contact events is

pel, and the Journalism Library,

Jarrett. That night, Ed Grimsley of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch talk-
ed at Lee Chapel on “A Humorist
Looks at the World.” The most re-
cent event took place this afternoon
with the presentation of a seminar
on “What's Wrong with the News-
papers,’ by Prof. Paxton Davis of
the Journalism Department.

Despite a home basketball game
on Monday night, Mr. Grimsley
drew a fair crowd. He was. introduc-
ed by Mr. Holland of ‘the Public
Relations Department, who inform-
ed the audience that Grimsley wrote
a humor column for the Richmond
Times-Dispatch while serving the
paper as an associate editor.

Mr. Grimsley’s speech Was inter-
esting as well as humorous. F'rst,
he spoke about the “foxhound con-
troversy,” whereby the establish-
ment of the foxhound as the state
dog has created all sorts of prob-
lems. He went on to relate some en-
couniers that he has had with those
who have been offended by his ar-
ticles.

The main point of Grimsley's
speech was that humor is on the de-
cline because people can no longer
laugh at themselves. He referred to
the present-day censorship of media
which might offend certain groups to
back up his argument. In conclusion,
he praised humor as a “solvant of
terror and tension.”

A measure of validity

The first step is in progress toward considering the feasi-
bility of coeducation at this institution. Although the Contact
Committee claims that it “in no way intends Co-ed Week
to be an endorsement of coeducation,” it must be realized
by everyone involved that coeducation is, indeed, on trial,
and that an orderly, pleasant, intellectual and rewarding
week of campus activity will be a significant argument for
proponents of coeducation,

The social advantages to be gained from such a drastic
change in the patterns of W&L life are but incidential to the
effects coeducation will have upon the intellectual life of
this institution, for it remains, basically, an academic insti-
tution. Proponents of coeducation claim that it will add to
the intellectual environment of this University. They state
that at present, some forty percent of America’s college
population is excluded from admission to W&L by sex, and
that this represents the loss of the intellectual contributions
and views of a sizable minority. They also charge that a
society without women is unnatural and that this is reflected
in an unnatural and, therefore, inferior classroom situation.
Opponents of coeducation claim it will be disruptive of the
academic life of the community and will be detrimental to
the traditions and institutions of W&L.

There are numerous other arguments to be made both
for or against, and of greater or lesser importance concern-
ing coeducation. But the important thing about the above
assertions is that they are all by nature testable, and that
Co-ed Week and next year’s exchange program can be the
measure of their validity.

While next year’s exchange will present a_ relatively
normal campus situation with only thirty girls at most and
spread over the length of three semesters, Co-ed Week does
not. This is only the second week of the semester with work-
loads still somewhat light. Therefore, it is only natural for
W&L students to allow Co-ed Week to take on a circus at-
mosphere with the possibilities for social contacts in the fore
and studies and academics in the background.

It should therefore be kept in mind that Co-ed Week
is an experiment. As every science student knows, one of
the first requirements of an accurate and successful experi-
ment is to control certain variables. If Co-ed Week is to
achieve any progress in evaluating the above claims, it is
incumbent upon every W&L student to approach the week’s
program with a degree of normality and_ intellectual
curiosity.

—R.D.C.

 

Toward a liberalization of cuts

Mike McCall, Sophomore class President, recently pre-
sented the Executive Committee with a petition concerning
the liberalization of Sophomore cuts. The petition was later
withdrawn because the EC felt the topic would be covered
by a special committee report to be presented in two weeks.

Regardless of the manner in which the EC approaches
the matter, McCall’s contention and requests are sound.
Basically, the Sophomore class plan calls for the granting
of unlimited cuts to all second semester Sophomores with a
Grade Point Ratio of 2.4 or better the previous semester.
This is hardly an overwhelming concession in that these same
students will be given unlimited cuts regardless of GPR only
one semester later.

In the past few years cutting privileges have undergone
drastic revision at W&L. Only a short time ago unlimited
cuts were given to no one but Dean’s List students regardless
of class level. Freshmen were allowed no more than two
cuts per course.

Inequities still remain. Sophomores have no more than
the six cuts per course that they had as Freshmen, while
their maturity has, in many cases, soared, Only one class
higher, Juniors are given unlimited cuts in all courses.

In analyzing the question it might be asked, what is the
purpose of limiting cuts? Is it to force students to apply
themselves to their studies? Is it to develop a habit of class
attendance? Does it really achieve these things?

When unlimited cuts were first approved, there was no
surge of cutting among Juniors and Seniors. We have every
confidence that rt d study were conducted, ir would be
found that those students who took all their cuts in their
Freshman and Sophomore years are the only ones that abuse
the unlimited cutting privileges, and that those who cut
rarely in their first years kept up their attendance in the
upperclass years. And as almost any professor will admit,
those students who cut least do best.

The University’s faith in the above statement is demon-
strated in the fact that Freshman and Sophomore Dean's
List students also are given unlimited cuts, True to form,
these students rarely abuse their newly won cutting privileges.

The conclusion, therefore, must be that enforced cuts
do not nec essarily ac hies e any lasting effect. In view of past
experience, it seems perfectly reasonable to allow McCall's
request, and even {to expand it to first semester Sophomores.
lt gives unlimited cuts only to the better students
The chances are they will not

the ones

who cut least. abuse the

privilege.

Repercussions from Graebner

Kelsey challenges attitudes Lowry calls for emphasis
toward men and resources upon institutional growth

By REEVE KELSEY

There were several disturbing
undercurrents in last month's Found-
ers Day adress by Dr. Norman A,
Graebner. His attitudes toward “re-
levant” educations, natural resource
scarcity, and the future of man
ought to be criticized and discussed.

Dr. Graebner rejects the “liberal
arts” education as being too super-
ficial. Recent trends in the Wash-
ington and Lee curriculum suggest
that an enforced, rigorous liberal
arts program is no longer accept-
able. Dr. Graebner never really ex-
plicitly pronounces an educational
theory, yet he is continually hedg-
ing around one. He feels that after
four years of college a_ student
should have a closed, established in-
tellectual system which will last him
the rest of his life. To accomplish
this. professors must establish a con-
sistent regimented body of thought.
Dr. Graebner paraphrases John
Fischer's lament, “Individual teach-
ers may have their philosophical
preferences and personal convic-
tions, but among teachers there is
no coherent thought.” Dr. Graebner
continues, “They (students) con-
clude that no body of thought is
superior to any other body of
thought. They have not learned to
think about public issues—to make
up their own minds in a rational
manner.”

1 would challenge Dr. Graebner
to say that for any given problem
there is one right answer and all
the rest are wrong, and that Dr.
Graebner’s ideology is right all the
time. After one has finished col-
lege, we would hope that one has
realized that there is not just one
right and one wrong answer. There
are many problems (Vietnam) where
all the solutions are “wrong” to the
extent that we are faced with a
series of options none of which are
pleasant. Both the questions and the
answers are not as black and white
as Dr. Graebner believes. Further-
more, is not the absence of a co-
herent intellectual system, a sysiem
in itself—the logical choice that no
system is perfect and that each set
of circumstances must be judged by
the relevant factors?

We are also distressed as Dr.
Graebner’s McCarthy-like attitude
that education should “begin with a
list of public enemies.” We agree
with Dr. Graebner that a student
should be allowed as specialized or
relevant education as he desires; any
attempt, however, to regiment a
university's finished product should
not be tolerated. If a student feels
that rationally, to the overall benefit
of society, the Everglades should be
sacrificed for an airport, the right
answer is not “no.”

We would take issue with Dr.
Graebner's statement, “For there are
limits to industrial growth and ex-
ploitation, and long ago the costs
of economic expansion, when mea-
sured by business stalistics, began to
exceed what such a large and rich
nation could really bear.” What are
these costs that he is referring to?
If the costs of that economic ex-
pansion are greater than we are
willing to bear, why has society con-
tinually agreed to bear these costs?
The social costs of industrialization
may be approaching the limits of
what society will tolerate as ste-
gested by the recent public concern
pollution and the ecological!
equilibrium. But social costs are just
a small factor of economic expan-
son. But we afe very curious to
know just which set of business
statistics show that the United
States has been growing too fast?

We are amused by Dr. Graebner’s
rather closed view on natural fe-
sources. He slates, “No longer can
there be exploitation in the name of
progress; there must Be conserva
tion in the mame of beauty and
survival.” Oh. the beauty of an iron
ore deposit many feet underground!
“Conservation is the name of Peatty
and survival.” however, in the long
run is more costly to both the pres
ent and future societies than a
rapidly advancing technological-in
dustrial use of natural
today. One is reminded of a Seot
tssh conservationist in the eighteenth
century urging his neighbors to
consume less peal each winter, so
there will be enough peat to supply
the world for the next 200 years
Dr. Grabner assumes thal there will

aver

FesOurces

be little economic or technological
erowth in the future. This is mitch
than
the assumption thal technology will
advance indefinitely

Harold J]. Rarnett and Chandler
Morse in their book, “Scarcity and

more harmful and unrealisth

Growth the Foonomics of Natural
Resource Availability” (lext for
Fconomics 259) discuss the obliga
ions of present Penerilions to con
scivVe fesifce ayy 6filtife genera

tions. They conclude: 1) Any re-
source conservation for future gen-
erations is basically an investment
in the future—a sacrifice of present
consumption in favor of future re-
turns. Barnett and Morse conclude
that by any economic standard, this
investment “will reduce the eco-
nomic value of output over the
time period taken as relevant for
the calculation and may, by curb-
ing research and capital formation,
have a perverse effect on future out-
put and welfare.” 2) “The Conserva-
tionists’ premise that the economic
heritage will shrink in value unless
natural resources are ‘conserved,’ is
wrong for a progressive world.”
Barnett and Morse state that the
per capita income has been almost
doubling each generation—hardly
the sign of a declining economic
heritage.

Dr. Graebner urges the U.S. re-
turn to “simpler lives.” He chooses
technological stagnation and a
planned economic contraction to fit
the needs of a neo-Thoreauvian
world. We hope that our education
will not teach us to look to the
future and draw back, but how to
best guide the rapidly expanding
technological frontiers to find “hu-
man happiness.”

By Prof. 8. T. Lowry

We must commend Dr. Graebner
for choosing two timely topics for
his Founder’s Day address. We also
agree with him most heartily in
deploring irrelevance in education
and the narrow profit motive ra-
tionalization for resource use and
planning. The rhetorical demands
upon an address delivered at a cere-
monial occassion frequently blur
the incisiveness of its content. It
might, therefore, be a contribution
to fruitful discussion to summarize
a concise view of educational and
resource policy with which, Dr.
Graebner would probably take some
issue.

In reference to academic relev-
ance, it is a source of continuing
embarrassment to the academic pro-
fession that the very word, Aeca-
demic when used as descriptive of
an argument or a question, “That
issue is academic,” of “That argu-
ment is academic,” has come to
mean irrelevant or pointless. Ht is
probably time for the liberal arts
justification to be clearly separated
from a brand of dilettantish toying
with synthetic realities primarily
related to narrow class value sys-
tems or religious traditions. Educa-
tion should be directed toward stim-

ulating imaginative and creative
acceptance of the challenges of the
future which undoubtedly involves
larger and larger systems of compre-
hension and value judgements as
our society grows in complexity and
impact on the environment be-
comes more involved, The demands
on our education are certainly for
more commitment to face real
problems of society, and expanding
coherence of our idea systems. I
personally believe that the answer
to this challenge is the acadmic
dignity of the intensely committed
position. What we need, is not pro-
fessors and students who all think
more intensively alike, but an aca-
demic tradition where it isn’t con-
sidered poor taste to believe in
something that is controversial. In
the arena of vital concrete projec-
tion of various idea systems, there
are many basic policies upon which
all agree, and both the devotees
of Thoreau and anarchistic Laissez-
faire will have to agree that Lake
Eire cannot persist as the largest
open cesspool in the midcontinent.
After all, implementable concensus
requires public support whether ar-
rived at from degree, or discursive
evolution. The polite noncommital

pseudo academic approach serves
only as a facade behind which
organized selfish interests pursue

their own ends while the public,
relying on elucidation from the in-
tellectual leadership, basks in a false
light of culpably courteous irre-
sponsibility.

On the issue of conservation, it
is true that we have passed through
a phase in which our society de-
veloped a childishly simplistic ra-
tionalization that individual profit
was an adequate measure of re-
source exploitation and social well-
being. An out-growth of this view is
the continued emphasis on the ma
terial measures of economic and
social progress. While Dr. Graebner
suggests that we should consider a
simpler life style with a withdrawal
from our present level of techno
logical irresponsibility, this seems to
be too narrow a frame of reference,
and not likely to be implemented in
our society. What we must demand
as citizens, is that we deal with
reality, and “pay the piper.” We
cannot continue to expand our
system of social planning and de-
cision making to maintain co-
herence with the scale of our
technology. Economic and ecologic
balance requires that when world
atmospheric conditions are being
seriously deteriorated by society's
technological pursuits, then world
decision making structures need to
be established and our knowledge
be accompanied by a concomitant
growth in responsibility and instru-
tional organization. When produc-
tion was based on the subsistance
family farm unit, the rules of pri-
vate property were generally ade-
quate to maintain balanced control
over the technological impact of
those pursuits.

The real challenge is to go
forward with the expansion of our
sysiems of social control and re-
sponsibility to keep pace with our
scientific knowledge of our environ-
ment, and the long range techno-
ligical impact of our industrial ma
chinery and population. The lag in
public awareness and in structured
systems of control and decision mak
ing is so pitifully obvious that curb
ing technology is probably a current
expedient. Hopefully, responsible
education and public awareness will
help develop a working system
whereby our society can make
effective choices that will keep tech
nological and industrial develop
menis contributing to the kind of
life we really desire when reflecting
upon the choices before us. Ht is
fairly obvious that happiness does
nol lie in the continued expansion
of material
fruits of
hucksiers in
profits

Probably the real challenge to
American life is that most of the
things we need namely a tremendous
sufge of sOcial responsibility

Baltimore beats Washington and Lee
but Generals destroy Lynchburg by 45

By JOHN ROBINSON
Sports Editor

So far the basketball team seems
to be in the post-exam slump. After
squeaking out a win over the Hamp-
den-Sydney Tigers, W&L had the
insult returned by visiting Baltimore
University. The Bees came from
behind to tag a 70-66 loss on Wash
ington and Lee’s record. A pair of
Philadelphia bred juniors took
credit for the Baltimore victory,
Bunny Wilson convinced the crowd
that he was rightfully the nation’s
second best small college scorer.
Charles Olkowski at 6-6 canned
some clutch foul shots when they
were Vital.

With a large partisan following
at Doremus the Generals possessed
a 31-26 lead after the initial period.
The home squad did not play spec-

tacularly well, but they did play
better than their Maryland op-
ponents. The big boys-Cartwright,

Neer, and Daniel were the main-
springs to the Blue attack.

Defense was exceptionally good
too for the General five. Until late
in the conflict, Wilson was held to
sporadic shots.

The crowd was hushed with
about 9:00 left. The play on the
court got considerably tougher and
the momentum swung Baltimore's
way even though the score was 51-

37 W&L'’s favor. The visitors
whittled away at the W&L lead
for six minutes. At that moment

Baltimore snatched on to the lead,
but the Generals fought back in a
see-saw affair.

The last minute was a traumatic
experience for Coach Canfield’s
crew. Olkowski went to the charity

Natators splash to another win
breaking Old Dominion’s records

Ihe General natators narrowly
squeaked by a strong Old Dominion
team in a well fought meet that saw
all but one of the Old Dominion
pool records either broken or tied.
The W&L swimmers only captured
three out of a possible ten individual
firsts, but the Blue depth in all
events plus winning both relays
gave the team a 54-50 victory giving

them a 3-2 record for the season.

Bill Brumback led the General
attack winning both the 50 and 100
yard freestyle with times of 22.7
and 50.9 Coach Stearns
made several dramatic changes in
the traditional starting line-up. Aven
Sharp, traditionally the General
breastsiroker, was converted into a
freestyle sprinter and anchored the
winning 400 yard medley relay team
of co-captain Roger Martin, Price
Blackford, Bim Clark, and Sharp.
Their winning time was 5:59.8 sec-
onds.

In the 1000 yard freestyle, Bert
Meem and John Lawlor combined
for second and third places. Alan
Corwith won the 200 yard freestyle
with a 1:54.9 second mark followed
by Dave Kympton in third place
Brumback then captured the 50
yard freestyle beating teammate Bim
Clark by three-tenths of
Entering the diving event, the score
was W&L 28, Old Dominion 15

Old Dominion then began to
close the gap. W&L diver Jay Marks
was only able to capture a third
Bim Clark was defeated in the 200
yard butterfly getting a second for
himself, while Bert Meem,

stripe and sunk the first of a one-
and-one effort but missed on the

bonus. Stu. Fauber went high to
control the rebound and time-ou
was requested. The score stood at
66-64 Baltimore’s favor, W&L’s

ball, and 29 seconds were left in
the game.

A bad in bounds play cost the
Generals a precious chance. Neer
was Called for contact with Okawski
who once again made his first shot
and then talleyed on his second try.
[he score now was 68-64. Neer
redeemed himself by scoring and
immediately calling for time.

Now Baltimore had the ball and
a 68-66 lead. In the throw-in Neer
was charged with a technical foul
by hitting the man who was out of
bounds. Olkowski hit the technical
and still another foul shot to make
the final score 70-66.

In summary Washington and Lee
had an excellent opportunity to de
feat a fine ball club, but the chance
slipped out of their hands. An ad-
mirable job was done in holding
the Baltimore club to 70 points.
Yet, offensively the teamwork was
rough around the edges and passing
was not as sharp as it could have
been.

Things took a turn for the better
against Lynchburg. Doremus rocked
as the Hornets got stung 105-60,
that’s right 105-60. W&L pressed

the visitors from the tip-off until
the final seconds. Lynchburg was
definitely rattled and the Generals
were out to make amendments for
their loss to Baltimore.

Mike Daniel stole the show early
hitting 16 of the first 23 Blue points.
Marvelous Mike closed out the even-
ing with a total of 23 points. Neer
and Cartwright each put in 17 points
plus Neer pulled in 19 rebounds,
Cartwright was devastating once
more with his gliding lay-ups.

Now Old Dominion looms ahead.
O.D.C, is ranked number 15 in the
nation’s small college teams. They
have only suffered a single loss. If
the Generals can turn out a perfor-
mance like the one last night, the
O.D.C, team may have 2 losses.

The silent prayer on every W&L
football player’s lips is: “Please
Lord, let there be an early spring.”
Yes it’s true, it’s not an “in” joke.
The “emotion kids are back,” the
“hard core is returning.” The boys
are back and ready for their annual
mud bath. At 3:30 P.M. on Wednes-
day February 11 the gang will once
again hit the soggy turf of Wilson
Field in preparation for the 1970
football season in what is affection-
ately termed W&L’s spring (?7!!)
practice.

Iwo second semester freshmen,
Steve Fluharty and Tom Van Am-
burgh are destined to hold down the
quarterback slot as sophomores next
year. A further report on the pro-
gress of the “search and build” mis-
sion will be upcoming.

So don’t be alarmed at the scream-
ing, yelling, and cursing you will
hear coming from Wilson Field.

Goralski Talk to End Contact;
120 Girls Here For Co-ed Week

Washington and Lee’s sixth an-
nual Contact symposium will end
tonight with a speech by Robert
Goralski of NBC News on “Tele-
vision: Keeping the Government
Honest.”

Tonight's program will conclude
a week-long presentation of discus-
sions and lectures centering on the
overall theme of “Communications
in the Modern World.”

Goralski, 41, has traveled in some
35 foreign countries and has cover-
ed five wars as part of his journalis-
tic work. He joined NBC News in
Washington nine years ago, and
since then he has been assigned to
the White House, the Department of
State and the Pentagon.

He is a frequent contributor to
the “Huntley-Brinkley Report” and
the morning “Today” program. Go-
ralski regularly writes the section
on Vietnam for the Encyclopedia
Britannica “Yearbook” and he is a
reviewer of books on current events
for the Washington Post.

Before joining NBC News, Go-
ralski was chief of the Burmese Serv-
ice of the Voice of America. He has
lived in Asia six years, having been
employed also by Radio Free Asia
and the Asia Foundation. While in
Pakistan, he helped establish that
country’s first school of journalism,
at the University of Karachi. A na-
tive of Chicago, Goralski was gradu-
ated from the University of Illinois
in 1949, majoring in political sci-
ence and journalism.

Approximately 120 girls took part
in Contact as part of Washington
and Lee’s first Co-ed Week. The
girls, representing Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, Randolph-Macon, and
Sweet Briar, took part in undergra-
duate classes, dined at Evans Hall
and at fraternity houses, and served
on panels in conjunction with Con-
tact programs.

Former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark cited two “wasteful, harm-
ful” dialogues in his Tuesday night
discussion of crime and unrest in
the United States.

“There is a need for more than
preaching,” he said, in discussing
the first dialogue, “respect for the
law.”

He went on to depict the prob-
lems of today’s urban life and the
poverty-ridden backgrounds of ghet-
to youth. He urged reforms and
told the large Lee Chapel audience
that “we will have respect for law
only when people have rights.”

Clark also denounced the second
dialogue, “repressive measures as
cures for crime.” Pure repressive
measures are to a large extent in-
effectual, Clark said, citing the slim
percentage of convictions of report-
ed crimes.

Moreover, by devoting vast funds
to “pure custody” rather than to re-
habilitation, the nation is, Clark
feels, failing to eradicate the per-
sonal problems that are often the
real reason for crime.

In closing Clark cited the dic-

Victorious Debaters
Continue to Travel

Washington and Lee debaters will
continue their travels this weekend
by participating in two tournaments.

John Reynolds and Ken Murov
will travel to the United States
Naval Academy for one tourna-
ment, while Charles Smith and Bill
Radigan will represent Washington
and Lee at Kings College in Wilkes-
Barre, Pa.

Other debaters took first place
over the weekend in a major inter-
collegiate debate tournament spon-
sored by the University of Rich-
mond.

Winning top honors for Washing-

m and Lee were Tim Wright, a
junior from Houston, Texas, and
Kevin Baker, a junior from Lynch-
burg, Va.

Thirty-five colleges and universi-
ties competed in the tournament,
which was held last Friday and Sat-
urday in Richmond.

To win, Washington and Lee's
team defeated Boston College in the
semifinal round and St. Anselm's
College of Manchester, N. H. Both
are considered to be national powers
in debate. Other major institutions
falling to WAL included Wake For-
est and West Point.

Baker also won the honor of be-
ing declared the third best indivi-
dual speaker of the tournament, and

Wright placed fifth. A total of 70

The debate topic was: “Resolved:

Washington and Lee also won
high honors in the novice debaters’
division of the University of Rich-

freshman from Houston, and Andy
Bradshaw, a freshman from Norge,
Va., teamed to place second in the
division,

hotomy that exists for many between
order, on one hand, and justice, on
the other. Clark urged that these
forces be instead combined. “You
can have neither order nor justice,”
he said, “unless you have both.”

Following the speech, Clark join-
ed in a panel discussion with stu-
dents, faculty members and indivi-
duals in the audience. A variety of
topics was discussed, including in-
tegration, which Clark termed “im-
perative,” Vietnam, and citizen in-
volvement with the police,

On Wednesday afternoon in Lee
Chapel, Ted Powers, Roanoke tele-
vision personality and editorial wri-
ter; discussed “Censorship in the
Broadcasting Industry.”

Although censorship in “the classi-
cal sense” is not a factor in the
United States, the broadcast indus-
try often falls prey to self-censor-
ship Powers said.

Such conditions arise both from
a lack of set standards and from the
influence of advertisers, who find
that it is “often possible to exercise
powers of censorship on the stations
they are sponsoring,” he said.

Powers also answered questions on
cable television, the quality of
shows now on the air, the potential
Specialization of individual televi-
sion channels, and the potential of
cable television,

Last night in Evans Dining Hall,
Contact presented Harold Hayes,
the editor of Esquire magazine, and
William Rusher, the publisher of
National Review.

Hayes, dealing with one of the
themes of his publication, “Dubious
Achievements,” stressed the rapid
pace of events in the sixties, and ex-
pressed a concern that the youth
movement may be losing some of
its earlier ideals and is becoming
infested with vested interest.

Rusher's speech, “The Impact of
Modern Media on Student Unrest
and Dissent,” stressed conservative

viewpoints on a broad range of
topics. He also expressed a skepti-
cism concerning the usefulness of
today’s college education and a
“wait and see” attitude toward to-
day’s youth.

During the question and answer
period which followed the speeches,
Hayes was queried on lowering the
voting age and on his opinion of
The National Review. Rusher en-
gaged in a spirited dialogue with
audience and panel members on
Vietnam, marijuana, and pollution.

In addition to outside speakers,
five Washington and Lee professors
conducted afternoon seminars as
part of the Contact program. A

Concert Guild presentation by The
Beaux-Arts String Quartet was also
part of the program for last night.

Co-ed Experiment

The effort a small group of people put into one week of
seminars and lectures is rewarded only by the degree to
which their attempt to enliven the intellectual atmosphere
succeeds. With this as the measure, the CONTACT com-
mittee and especially Chairman Larry Honig have a right to
feel a large degree of satisfaction.

The Ring-tum Phi has in past years advocated that the
CONTACT program move away from a political science-
economics-sociology orientation into other areas. Although
that editor had in mind an occasional program on the humani-
ties, we find the creativity that conceived Co-ed Week to be at
least a significant gesture in the direction of providing CON-
TACT with greater variety and scope, and we support the
effort. Especially worthwhile is the use of CONTACT funds
to experiment in matters the University is considering on a
theoretical basis.

Without the benefit of complete retrospect, we judge
CONTACT to have been a success in both aspects of its en-
deavor to stimulate intellectuality here. First, of course, the
speakers have been entertaining and thought-provoking,
and their subjects of major interest to most students to whom
the program is available.

Second, in regard to the co-ed experiment, the success,
while perhaps not quite as measurable is, we believe, real.
We must immediately qualify that statement. We cannot re-
gard this temporary inclusion of women into W&L’s acade-
mic life as a true test of the viability of co-education. In the
first place, the campus has since Monday assumed an air of
artificiality. Class attendance has increased, and everybody
seems to be dressing a lot better than is normally the case.

Further, class participation in some cases seems to have
taken on the characteristic of the war of the sexes and in other
cases has resulted in closer attention to one’s classmates than
to the subject at hand.

The difficulty, of course, is that one week, especially one
in which the work load is a bit lighter anyway, is not long
enough for the situation to normalize. Our only prediction is
that, given the time, dress habits would revert (though per-
haps not quite all the way) and class would once more be-
come a place in which to give primary attention to the acade-
mic material at hand.

Yet the contribution some classes have received due to
the presence of women in them convinces us that the experi-
ment as a means to test co-education is not totally invalid and
indeed seems to indicate that there are advantages accruing to
the idea.

At any rate, whatever bearing this experiment has on the
question of whether to make W&L co-ed, we hope that its
experimental nature will become a permanent part of the
CONTACT format, and that its implications for the possibil-
ity of more communication and cooperation among the
schools in the area will not go unheeded, either by student
groups or by the administration.

Parkin g A Problem

The additional influx of cars into Lexington this week in
conjunction with the co-educational program has served to
underscore a problem that is of major concern to many in
the Washington and Lee community.

With gym construction to begin shortly and the relaxa-
tion of restrictions on automobile possession formerly im-
posed on freshmen and financially assisted students, parking
at Washington and Lee is rapidly becoming a very perplex-
ing problem.

We are all aware of the great deal of emphasis recently
placed on the immediate need for new facilities; notably re-
furbishing and increasing the size of the present gymnasium,
constructing a new library, and constructing additional, if not
entirely new, facilities for the School of Commerce. Seem-
ingly overlooked in determining needs however, have been
allowances for immediate additional parking. Moreover, in
light of the planned construction, a reduction of present
parking facilities seems probable.

Roughly half of the students presently eligible to possess
cars do so. If this percentage is applicable to freshmen next
year, and we have no reason to believe otherwise, we can ex
pect a minimum of 700 cars.

Present facilities from the front of Doremus Gymnasium
to the VMI border provide parking for some 290 cars, with
additional space behind the gym for 120 cars (reduced to
50 after construction).

Long range plans call for a maximum of 300 additional
spaces in various proposed lots ranging in location from the
vicinity of Lee Chapel to across the ravine. Part of this plan-
ning is in compliance with certain local ordinances which re-
quire a specified ratio of parking spaces to the seating capa-
city of the new gym.

The Ring-tum Phi is aware that the cost of additional
parking facilities is extremely prohibitive (Roughly $1,000
per space for asphalt facilities). But we would hasten to point
out that the problem is a most pressing one, and one that,
rather than simply relegated to a priority on the University’s
long range plans, deserves the immediate attention, and ac
tion, of those who seek to better the physical facilities of the

Law and Order:

By Dave Olson

Fuesday night before an overflow
audience in Lee Chapel Ramsey
Clark gave what I thought was an
intelligent and perceptive speech on
the problems of violence and crime
in America.

Mr. Clark introduced some very
important and often overlooked
points concerning these problems.
He stated that we need respect for
the law in this country and he also
stated that a series of repressive
laws “tendered as a cure for crime”
is a dangerous way to look at the
problem. In other words fear will
not inculcate respect for the law it
will inculcate fear of the law. Re-
spect. Mr. Clark said, will come
only if everyone has rights in this
country. As he said, this society is
in bad shape when we have to de-
pend on the police for order.

The road to stopping violence
and crime in this country as Mr.
Clark said is to rework the social
fabric in this country. In particular
we must rebuild and rework the
ghetto for that is where the majority
of violence and crime has its be-
ginnings. But why does it come
from the ghetto? It comes from the
ghetto because the conditions in the
ghetto are such that crime, like a
cancer, has the needed decay, social
and physical, to grow and spread.
Violence and crime are symptoms
of decay in the social fabric. As Mr.
Clark said we must rebuild the
social fabric so that there can be
respect for the law.

Mr. Clark feels also that some of
the blame for violence in this coun-
try stems for police overreaction in
many cases. He feels that we need
to educate and train police much
more extensively. Also we must pay
them more so that it will become an
attractive profession,

The problem of violence in this
country is one of a cause-effect re-
lationship. The cause of violence in
this country is a decaying social fab-
ric. The effects are an open disre
spect for the law (particularly in the
ghetio) and If we enact re
pressive laws we may stop riots,
prostitution and drug addiction in
he ghetto but the causes of the

rimes will remain. The way to e!
ninate the crime is to eliminate the
which are unlivable condi
tions of the ghetto. Overt police ac
tion will not solve the problem. Ur-

and greater opportunities and

[hen we can say with understanding

By Lawrence McConnell

For various reasons, many may
call former Attorney-General Ram-
sey Clark’s speech Tuesday evening
in Lee Chapel the highlight of Con-
tact. Perhaps his appearance can be
called Contact's high point primar-
ily because his remarks were the
most significantly disturbing of any
made this week.

He spoke on the topic “In What
Sense ‘Law and Order’?” and out-
lined two ordering forces of society
in the United States which he felt
were harmful or “at least wasteful”:
(1) the need for respect for the law
and (2) the series of repressive mea-
sures which are used as deterrents
for crime.

Proceeding to defend his opening
statements, he noted that Lincoln's
statement, “reverence for the rule of
law should be the religion of the
country,” could not be applicable in
today’s society. He remarked that
he hadn't seen the “human spirit”
which could say to a black man in
a ghetto, “respect the law.” Turn-
ing to the matter of deterrents to
crime, Mr, Clark felt that repressive
deterrents were not the answer to
the overwhiming problm of crime
and that what is really needed is the
rebuilding of the “brutalizing” en-
vironment in which crime is known

 

Pro and Con

to be rampant. By altering and im-
proving this environment in which
crime most frequently occurs, Clark
said, the problem of crime can
greatly reduced in America. Thus,
the principles of respect for the law
and repressive measures to enforce
the law are not the real keys to
crime prevention.

In large measure, by failing to re-
fine and define issues about which he
was speaking, Mr. Clark has made
some very dangerous implications.
First, he did not note any distinction
between obedience and respect for
the law. Very basically, one might
say that the orderly government of
a society depends upon the resigna-
tion of that society's individuals to
obey rules established to order that
society, Simply, this obedience ts
characterized in the individual's
sense that if he does not obey these
laws, he gets anything from a crack
on the head to a fine in court, de-
pending upon the society.

Respect for the law is not as
easily definable as obedience. Here,
reverence for the law is established
through the individual's sense of
morality and perhaps more basically,
his corresponding reverence for the
ethics of his religious faith. Respect
for the law then, must be seen as
more of a reverential cultural out-

Sweet Briar Exchangee
Discusses Contact Week

By Stevie Norris
Sweet Briar College

Well, we've been to English and
Sociology, even gym and ROTC
classes with you, we've eaten break-
fast and lunch with you, we've dined
in your fraternities with you.

We've just about shared every-
thing with you this week. I'm sure
there's some of us that have even
shared your rest rooms with you
(there seems, quite understandably,
to be a shortage of women's rest-
rooms on this campus which means
careful regulation of your intake of
coffee and beer)

Im sure at first there was a
little discomfort and apprehension
on both sides. My very first nine
o'clock of the week was a Sociology
class which a lot of girls attended,
and the poor instructor walked in,
saw all these females and said, very
heartily, well, we won't talk about
fertility today anyway. | would have
thought it the ideal situation myself
However

The first fraternity | went to I
think must have been a little uneasy
too. Dinner went like this. The
housemother met us at the door,
took our coats and then brightly
introduced us to the boys. For the
next fifteen minutes the art of small
talk was desperately cultivated, And
just when everyone's siock was runn
ine dry, when everyone had asked
everyone else what they were major
ime in, where they came from and
how they were enjoying Contact, the
bell rang. We swarmed towards that
dining room as if it were our only
hope of salvation

When the meal was over, the
bovs sat around talking to the boys,
and the girls saw there was nothing
for it but to make conversation
with the girls (what a bore). Bul a
few extrovert spirits came and talk
ed jo ws and if was fun, Ut really

night greeted us in a solid bloc of
shirts and ties. But the guy I sat
next to at dinner had on jeans and a
sweater and could easily have used
his shirttails as a napkin.

“Excuse me for not being dress-
ed,” he said, a little defensively.

“Oh, that’s quite all right,” 1
said.

“If you're going to have a natural
atmosphere, you should dress na-
tural,” he said with conviction.

“I quite agree,” | said.

The next morning | bumped into
a friend. A girl in faded tattered
Bermuda shorts had just walked
past us. The first thing he said wasn’t
Hi, how are you, but “Did you see
that girl?” And without waiting fo:
an answer he shook his head and
walked on. He

looked very per-

turbed.

being chatted up over scrambled
eges and bacon or roast beef sand
wiches and coke, and especially fun
listening to Ted Powers.

Ah weil, back to the conven's

growth, while obedience is merely
an understanding of the penalties
for offense against society, and a
subsequent adherance to the law.
Thus, order in society can be ob-
tained in two ways, either by sim-
ple obedience to the law or by a
refined respect for what the law is.
Thus, Mr. Clark is saying that we
cannot demand a culiural response
from people in an uncultural en-
vironment—a statement with which
everyone will agree. But why can’t
society require a simple obedience
to the law from everyone, cultured
or uncultured, when the consequ
ences to violations are plain?

When Mr. Clark referred to Lin
coln’s remark that “reverence for
the rule of law should be the religion
of the country,” he did not make
any reference to the context in
which Lincoln said those works
Lincoln was speaking of law as an
absolute, unbending, steadfast con
cept whereby everyone is judged
equally. In practice, Lincoln's con
ception of law is not widely accepted
in the United States today. A! pres
ent, it is “old fashioned” to thin!
of law as unmovable—now it is
thought of as a viable code of reg
ulations created to meet society’
needs. And it is this latter concep
tion of the law which Mr. Clark
chose to defend.

Evidence for Mr. Clark’s assump
tion of this modern attitude towards
law can be found in the very con
tent of his speech. Instead of speak
ing about the problems of law en
forcement (which was the function
of his office as Attorney-General),
he proceeded to talk about how
crime can be prevented by improv-
ing the environment in which the
large majority of criminals live. He
advocated a minimum amount of
law enforcement and a maximum
effort to rehabilitate the criminal’s
environment in his comments about
examining the laws themselves for
their “content and effect of applica-
tion on people,” and his statements
concerning the rebuilding of this
“brutalizing” environment. It would
seem that Mr. Clark is more con
cerned about the affairs of the office
of the HEW than he is about the
functions of this former office; in
fact he even noted that under his
administration, only 2 percent of
all known crimes in America re
sulted in convictions. It was almost
as if he were attempting to convince
his audience of his
an Attorney-General

inefficiency as

One central question which must
be asked at this juncture is: Why
does Mr. Clark find it imperative to
adjust the methods of law enforce
ment to fit the needs of the people
in the ghetioes? If the people in
Harlem are for “Black Power,

By Robert LaRue

Despite a record setting perform-
ance by Washington and Lee’s “Mad
Stork,” Mike Neer, the Generals
fell to a clearly excellent Old Domi-
nion Squad, 90-79.

The 6'7” Neer set a school record
of 29 rebounds and added 32 points
to the W&L cause, while hitting on
67% of his floor shots.

~~ The Generals challenged the Mon-

archs throughout the first half,
largely on the basis of Neer’s shoot-
ing and rebounding artistry and the
playmaking of Ellie Gutshall. As the
end of the first half approached, Old
Dominion went on a hot streak
which turned a nine point Washing-
ton and Lee lead into a seven point
deficit. At the half, the Monarchs
led, 43-36.

Washington and Lee surged back
in the opening moments of the sec-
ond half, as neither team could build
up anything more than a three point
stake. Midway through the second
half the Monarchs rolled up suc-
cessive three point plays, taking the
lead to stay.

The Generals were woefully weak
at the foul line, in contrast to the
Monarchs, who missed only two in
fifteen attempts. Although Neer
went wild, Old Dominion did a fine
job of defending Mel Cartwright,
holding him to only eleven points
and eight rebounds, and a 31% floor
percentage.

Overall, Washington and Lee con-
trolled the boards by a 53-40 mar-
gin, as no Monarch broke into dou-
ble figure in rebounds. But Old
Dominion was not from the floor,
hitting 53% of the time compared
to the Generals 45%.

Rounding out the point produc-
tion for Washington and Lee were
Mike Daniel and Norwood Morri-
son, with 18 and 14 respectively.

Dave Twardzik, red-hot six foot-
er from Pennsylvania gunned in 24
points while hitting for 63% from
the floor. His partner in crime was
Jim Cole, who scored 20 points
with a 73% average. Skip Noble
added 17 points and Henry Lozon
tossed in 13 to aid the Monarchs.
Lozon was Old Dominion’s man on
the boards, pulling in nine, while
Noble, Cole and Steve Cox each
grabbed six.

The loss dropped Washington and
Lee to 13-5, while Old Dominion
raised its record to 17-2,

The Generals now journey to
Mars Hill and West Virginia Tech
for games Saturday and Tuesday.

Mars Hill is a North Carolina
school which Coach Canfield de-
scribed as “anxious to have at us.”

“We'll play to stop the run, settle

them down and make them play de-
fense,” commented the Washington
and Lee head coach.

Mars Hill, a run and shoot team
despite its size (the starting line-up
is 6’-0,’ 6-5”, 6-6", 6’-4”, 6”-10”).
It has defeated such notables as
Western Carolina. They feauture
one of the nations best all-around
small college players in Dave Wil-
mouth, 6’-5” strong man who is cur-
rently averaging 20 points and 12
rebounds a game.

West Virginia Tech has had a
rough schedule but nevertheless has
done well this year. The Engineers
have players nationally ranked in
shooting and rebounds, but are pri-
marily led by their little All-Ameri-
can Bob Floyd, who averages an
unbelievable 19 rebounds a game.

Tech also has a 6-5” freshman
who was All-Navy for four years
and another 6’-5” forward who is
averaging 20 points every game.

Coach Canfield commented that
both he and the team are extremely
grateful to the crowds which attend-
ed this week's three games. The
head coach also had a bite for the
officials, whom he felt “dampened
the crowd’s enthusiasm.” Several
times the officials warned the crowd
about the noise.

The round-ballers are still look-
ing forward to ending the season at
20-5, and to possession of the Col-
lege Athletic Conference champion-
ship. A big obstacle on the way to
St. Louis and a 20 win season is a
February 24 home encounter with
Virginia Commonwealth.

Mel Cartwright is still the high
point man with an even 18.0 points
per game for the 18 games. Mike
Neer is next with a 17.- average,
while Mike Daniel is third at 16.3.
Neer leads on the boards, averaging
16.6 a game. Cartwright follows at
11.1.

February 27 will find Washington
and Lee in St. Louis for the CAC
tournament attempting to improve
last year’s second place position.

Football Squad Begins Practice

Washington and Lee footballers
commenced their Spring drills Wed-
nesday following an organizational
meeting on Tuesday.

Head Coach Buck Leslie wel-
comed 47 players to the muddy
practice fields next to Wilson Field.
Two additional players are partici-
pating on the wrestling team.

“The spring workout gives us a
chance to look at a few faces, most-
ly on offense. We'll take a real good
look at the rising sopromores (Van
Amburgh and Fluharty) who will be
competing for quarterback. We'll
also be shoring up the tackle slot,”
said Coach Leslie. “We know what
we're looking for.”

The grid staff will also be look-
ing for a place-kicker to fill the void
left by the graduating Jack Baizley.

“George Harris has a very strong
leg, and John McNeil also has some
experience. This is a mechanical
thing,” Coach Leslie added.

Coach Leslie anticipates few
changes in either offense or defense.
“We'll take a look at flip-flopping
our split end and tight end more.”

Even less change is expected on
defense, where Coach Boyd Wil-
liams will concentrate on movement
and shifting. Coach Leslie pointed
out, “Teams kept automaticking

(changing signals at the line of
scrimmage according to the defen-
sive alignment) on us last year, more
so than before.”

Commenting on the first day in
pads, Coach Leslie said that there
was “good effort and good spirit, a
little huffin’ and puffin’.” The Gen-
erals will go over fundamentals by
means of drillwork for the next few
days. We won't do any more scrim-
maging than last year,” Coach Les-
lie noted,” “but it does give us the
chance to look.”

The Spring session will last

through February 26, with no prac-
tice on Saturday.

On the Liberation Front
Hello.

The Lee-Hi Truck Stop Libera-
tion Front, Local 367, is not really
concerned with trucks. It is a little
worried about our future: America
and all, you know?

I mean we don’t doubt for a min-
ute the U.S. Department of Defense
could whip up a couple of hundred
B-52’s and completely obliterate the
object of President Nixon’s fear of
being “the first American president

to lose a war.”

But then will there be anything
left except pollution? Yes. Dead
human beings. Have we come to the
point that the real possibility of the
suicidal death of our entire species
(much less of any one person) fails
to evoke a human response?

On Jan. 17, 1970, a new organi-
zation was formed within the Wash-
ington and Lee community. Its pur-
pose is:

and undertake responsive action
on such problems as the misuse
of military power, the pollution
of our environment, the neglect
of minority rights, and the fail-
ures of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity to make a valuable con-
tribution to our times.”

The entire organization is ground-
ed in a commitment to the critical
examination of our community’s
ideals and inadequacies, and in a
commitment to take decisive action
toward resolving such existing prob-
lems, The influence of the organi-
zation will directly correspond to
the degree of honesty and responsi-
bility its members consistently make
in the effort to relate to the mem-
bers of the W&L Community, as
well as the community’s receptive
ability to such an examination,

The research committee is the
main focus of the organization’s
energy. The problems that the peo-
ple of the organization raise are
placed in context by the efforts of
the members of this permanent com-
mittee.

The program development com-
mittee designs and submits plans of
scheduled action and alternatives to
the organization to for decision,

The public relations committee
undertakes the responsibility for
correspondence and publicity.

Project “Stop” is the primary ef-
fort at present:

1) The Day of Focus will be held
in about one week.

a) A regular program of draft
counseling will begin.
b) A religious service given by

Lexington clergymen and open
to all is not definite but ef-
forts are in progress to make
this possible.

c) A- gathering and concert
with other college communities
will be held to unify action
against the war.

2) Work is in progress to make
the question of the war an un-
avoidable and significant issue in
the Virginia Senatorial race. The
candidates will be asked to come
to our campus.

This spring active support will be
given to the teach-in on environ-
mental problems of pollution and
special concern will be directed to
local pollution and conservation
problems,

A regularly scheduled symposium
(beginning next week) will examine
campus issues and will be open to
all.

Documenting films on different
subjects and from various sources
will be shown in the Student Center,
beginning in March.

A special project group on a
specific discrepancy in the curri-
culum is preparing a report for pre-
sentation in April.

That, in short, is why we decided
to call the organization the Lee-Hi
fruck Stop Liberation Front, Local
367. However, for the purpose of
correspondence with those of less
humor, we've decided to change the
official name to Dialogue. Tell us,
what could be a more harmless but
effective name?

McConnell Attacks Clark’s Talk

(Continued from Page 2)

does one do away with integrated
schools to adjust to their needs as
a community? If the answer to this
question is anything other than an
irrevocable “no,” then the next ques-
tion is this: who is it who has
enough sense to perceive society's
needs? Are we to enforce law differ-
ently in the ghettoes because of its
environmental diffrences?

These questions raise the issue of
the principle of every man’s equal-
ity before the law. The concept of
equality before the law arose when
the people demanded equality with
the nobility before the law. This
conception was implemented as a
fundamental cornerstone for the
original government of the United
States; and it is this cornersione
which is being chipped away by the
direction of Mr. Clark's argument.
He is in effect arguing that the im-
plementation and enforcement of
the law should depend upon the
social class of the offender. He ar-
rives at this implied conclusion by
the notion that law must be evalu-
ated by its “content and effect of
application on people” of different
classes.

The real danger in his argument
is this: if one argues that the applica-
tion of law enforcement is a class
matter (and he has done this when
he stated that those who break the
laws are environmentally deprived
for the most part), and that the ap-
plication of the law should be equal
in a democratic society, then one
comes to a screeching halt with the

conclusions: we must therefore es-
tablish an environmentally classless
society.

This is the direction towards
which Mr. Clark's argument pro-

ceeds. He stated in the question and
answer session that the education of
ghetto children was of prime im-
portance in combatting the “brutaliz-
ing” environment, that $1,000 more
per child would not be enough for

a marked improvement, and_ that

what was urgently needed was real
“integration.” Just what is that? Do
we have to have economic and en-
vironmental integration before law
can be enforced properly? What

The individual liberty upon which
this country was founded inherently
and necessarily breeds the inner
quality of one’s economic condition.
So, in this all-embracing zeal for en-
vironmental equality, to what extent
can one sacrifice the quality of in-
dividual liberty on the altar of pro-
per economic and social environ-
ment? Will we have a better quality
of justice and law enforcement if
we make this sacrifice? It would
seem that one who is supposed to be
a priest of justice and law enforce-
ment has become a prophet.

Mr. Clark’s fundamental misfor-
tune is that he refuses to recognize
that some injustice will always exist
in this world, and that law and its
enforcement cannot be fundament-
ally questioned or altered to fit the
needs of a particular social class. If
there are any anguished moans
from the reader at this conclusion,
let him ask himself if there is a
system of government in which
there is total justice and total wis-
dom among men. Can fallible men
become infallible? Does anybody
subscribe to that sort of optimism?

Armband Response

To the Editor of the Friday Ring-
tum Phi,

Only on rare occasions do I be-
come sufficiently incensed at the
machinations of the © self-styled
guardians of the America liberal
tradition to take pen in hand to of-
fer a rebuttal; however, this is one
such occasion.

Upon venturing into the Student
Center on Monday, I observed a
rather interesting spectacle at the in-
formation booth. On the counter
were neatly laid a number of white
armbands and safety pins, suppos-
edly for attaching said armbands to
the arm.

Accustomed to such ostentatious
display and superficial commitment,
I paid little attention; however, there
was (and still is, I suppose) a sign
above the booth that summed up
more succinctly and more eloquent-
ly than any other means thus far
employed the misdirection (or small
I say misunderstanding) of the well-
intentioned aggregation of pacifists
operating the concession. The sign
read: “Wear the armband! Do your
share to end the war!”

Several implications may be
drawn from this rational, scientific
approach to the Vietnam problem.
Implicit first of all is the notion that,
should one choose not to wear an
armband, he is not doing his share
to end the war. Thus, implicitly, he
is not for “peace”. Implicit second
is the belief that, if one should
choose to wear an armband, he has
made the ultimate commitment, and
“done his thing” to end the war.

Either way, the wearer and the non-
wearer alike are subject to a “credi-
bility gap,” when the causal link be-
tween wearing an armband and end-
ing the war fails to emerge.

Although these idealists may sin-
cerely believe that such action will
end the war, in reality the goal will
be reached only by a commitment
more complete and more difficult.
To wear an armband is to indulge
the spirit with a transitory comfort.
But the “easy way out,” history tells
us, has very soldom been the best
way out. I think the point has been
made: as long as we continue to
apply simplistic and moral solutions
to a complex and political situation,
we will continue to become more
and more frustrated when our illu-
sory efforts yield nothing.

In closing, it might be appropriate
to apply the “armband rationale” to
a parallel situation, and hope that
some of our campus “band wearers”
will take it under consideration;
“Wear conventional dress—do your
share to improve and enhance the
appearance and reputation of
W&L.” Perhaps, in this case, the
rationale is acceptable. But it could
never happen...

EC adopts report on reforms;

 

 

Davidon to visit

 

W&L and VMI

PHYSICS LECTURER

Will speak with students
and confer with faculty

Professor William C. Davidon,
Chairman of the Department of
Physics at Haverford College, Hav-
erford, Pa. will serve as a visiting
lecturer at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and Virginia Military Insti-
tute, Thursday and Friday, Febru-
ary 19 and 20,

He will visit under the auspices
of the American Association of
Physics Teachers and the American
Institute of Physics as part of a
broad, nationwide program to stimu-
late interest in physics. The pro-
gram is now in its thirteenth year
and is supported by the National
Science Foundation.

Lectures, informal discussion, as-
sistance to faculty members concern-
ing curriculum and research prob-
lems in physics, and talks with stu-
dents will feature Professor
Davidon’s visit. Professor Edward
F. Turner, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Physics at Washington and
Lee University and Professor Philip
Peters of the Department of Physics
at Virginia Military Institute are in
charge of arrangements for Profes-
sor Davidon’s visits.

William C. Davidon, professor of
physics at Haverford College, Hav-
erford, Pennsylvania, and chairman
of the department, is a graduate of
the University of Chicago, where he
received his B.S. (1947), M.S. (1950),
and Ph.D. degrees (1954). He also
attended Purdue University.

Prior to joining the Haverford
faculty in 1961, he was employed as
an associate physicist at the Argonne
National Laboratories for five years.
Earlier he was research director of
the Nuclear Instrument and Chemi-
cal Corporation, Chicago.

He also has served as a research
associate at the Fermi Institute for
Nuclear Studies at the University of
Chicago and as a visiting associate
professor at the University of Wash-
ington.

Awarded a Fulbright Grant in
1966 Dr. Davidon spent two semest-
ers at the University of Arrhus in
Denmark. He examined scattering
theory in quantum mechanics—ex-
ploring the consequences of De-
Sitter symmetry—and worked to
improve computer methods for
locating the minimum of a fune-
tion.

Dr. Davidon’s areas of research
have also included the theory of
clementary particles, experiments on
meson scattering, foundations of
quantum mechanics and mathemati-
cal logic. He is the author of more
than 25 technical articles and is
working on a physics textbook. He
also holds several patents on de-
vices for measuring radioactivity,

Cahn, Matthews, Leonard
will study deferred rush

Chuck Cahn announced at last
night's IFC meeting that those
houses with tentative parietal plans
would have to come up with new
plans when they elected new officers;
the tentative plans were approved
with the provision that new plans
be submitted when new officers
were elected.

Larry Honig, Chairman of Con-
tect, stated that there would be no
further student assessments for
Contact's use. He said that the logic
behind this was that the student
body should not pay for an activity
of the IFC.

President Cahn announced that
there had been a committee formed
to study the prospects of deferred
rush next year, consisting of him-
self, Jim Matthews, and Danny
Leonard. He stated that sugges-
tions from the various houses would
be welcome. Their proposal will be
discussed before the IFC upon its
completion, which should be in
about three weeks.

Andrew Wyndham, in charge of
the Heart Fund Drive, announced
there would be a meeting of fra-
ternity representatives in the meet-
ing room of the Student Center at
seven Wednesday evening. The house
whose members collect the most will
be given a free keg.

Dean John, who was unable to
attend the meeting, sent a note to
the IFC. He stated that because
of the parking problem caused by
the construction on the new gym-
nasium, students living close to
school were requested to walk to
school. He suggested that those
fraternities who were allowed to
drive their rushees to their houses
the first two days of rush to be the
only ones to drive to school.

There was a general discussion
concerning the activities of the last
weekend of school, as there is to be
no Finals Weekend. There is a pos-
sibility that there could be a cock-
tail party and combo, financed by
fraternity funds.

proposals presented to faculty

By ROY CARLTON
and STEVE ORY

A major project of this year's
Executive Committee reached _ its
terminal stages last night as the Stu-
dent Affairs and Faculty Regula-
tions Committee presented their re-
port to the EC. In other preliminary
matters the EC turned its attention
to the recently intensified parking
problems of the campus, discussed
a proposed University Assembly on
drugs and considered an upcoming
Co-ed Week to be held at a nearby
women’s college.

The construction of a new gym-
nasium complex, which is to begin
this Wednesday, has caused a severe
traffic problem on campus. Where
parking was scarce before, it is now
practically non-existing. Yesterday
the University issued a plea to all
students within walking distance not
to drive their cars to campus. In
line with this thought, Dean Kum-
puris, Senior Representative, recom-
mended that members of fraterni-
ties within walking distance of the
school be asked to leave their cars
in the fraternity parking lots. The
motion was passed unanimously and
was forwarded to the faculty for
their consideration.

Further discussion was held on
the suggestion proferred by Law
representative John Markham con-
cerning an assembly on drugs. Last
week Markham had mentioned the
possibility of having a mandatory
University Assembly on drug use.
He is now certain that the Presi-
dent of the Virginia Druggists As-
sociation can be obtained as a
speaker. A program is now in the
process of being scheduled and
further plans will be announced.

Student Body President Swede
Henberg announced that Randolph-
Macon Woman's College is planning
a Co-ed Week upon the model pro-
vided by Washington and Lee. Sev-
eral area men’s colleges, including
WAL, have been invited to send
students, Participants will attend
classes at Randolph-Macon for a
week with housing being provided.

‘Earth Day’ group meets
to initiate spring Teach-in

Washington and Lee's own “Earth
Day” Environmental Action group
will hold its first meeting Wednes-
day Night, 7:00 p.m. in the Main
meeting room of the Student Cen-
ter.

This “Earth Day” committee has
been formed by interested students
from WAL and several of the sur-
rounding girls’ schools. lt plans to
align itself with the National April
22 “Environmental Teach-In.”

April 22 is “Earth Day,” a day

Smith picked as
top speaker in

debate tourney

Charles Smith, a senior from
Louisville, Kentucky, won the Best
Speaker Award at King's College in
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania while
competing in a debate tournament
over the weekend, Over the course
of the weekend Smith faced fifty-nine
other debaters, representing over
twenty colleges, Smith and junior
Bill Radigan of Arlington, Virginia
teamed up to win six of their eight
debates, while Radigan was chosen
as the seventh best speaker. The
Smith-Radigan combination defeat-
ed teams from George Washington
University, the University of Mas
sachusetis, the University of Ver
mont, C.W. Post College, Rutgers
University and Dickinson College,
while losing twice to Emory Uni
versity

While Smith and Radigan were
winning the trophies, John Reynold
and Kenny Murov were debating at
the United States Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md. The Reynolds
Murov team won five out of eight
debates in the tournament. They
beat the U.S. Military Academy,
Dartmouth University, St. John Uni
versity (Md), Kings College and
Auburn University, while losing to

silty and the University of North

vities On campuses and local com-
munities, people will have a chance
to examine the facts about the en-
vironmental crisis. They can find
out what, if anything, is being done,
and what must be done.

April 22 is being planned and
organized on the local level, with
local people deciding for themselves
the issues upon which to focus, and
the activities which are most ap-
propriate, Local groups must de-
termine what will happen on April
22, and what comes aftewards.

Here plans are currently being
made for a combined April 22
“Earth Day” with other local schools
attending. The day's program will
present the effects of pollution and
environmental neglect on the popu-
lation, and the legal and economic
recourses we have to solve this
pressing problem.

All students, regardless of politi-
cal persuasion, are urged to atiend
this public organizational meeting

$3 million gym addition
begins, but parking area
vanishes with construction

Washington and Lee University
will see one of its problems—in-
adequate gymnasium facilities
start to melt away Wednesday when
construction will begin on a $3
million addition to Doremus Gym
nasium

For a time, however, the con
struction will lead to complication
of another problem—lack of
quate parking facilities

Beginning Monday morning, the
parking area behind the gymnasium
was barricaded and no parking will
be permitted there, according to D
E. Brady, Ir. superintendent of
building and grounds

Consiruction is expected to take
approximately 18 months

Persons who live within walk.
ing distance of the campus are

Brady said.

“We will he developing idditional

ade

weather permits, he said

At present, Randolph-Macon has
three male students who have been
exchanged through a program with
Colgate University.

The major portion of the Execu-
tive Committee's attention was de-
voted to the report of the Student
Affairs and Faculty Regulations
Committee. The committee was
composed of Senior representative
Dave Bethea, Sophomore represent-
atives Glenn Azuma and Bill An-
drews and was chaired by Swede
Henberg. They presented a nine
page report reviewing faculty regula-
tions concerning  student-faculty
relationships.

The review of faculty regulations
was thought to be necessary in that
they have not been reviewed by
any body, student, faculty or ad-
ministrative, in the last twelve years.
The report proposed several reforms
in a variety of faculty committees
as well as suggesting changes in
regulations applying to students.

The validity of the concept of
“in loco parentis” was attacked and
it was proposed that its application
be limited in several proposed re-
forms pertaining to class attendance,
limitation on activities and parietals.

The committee made specific
recommendations that the student
body should have a representative
on the faculty Admissions Commit-

 

tee, Courses and Degree Commit-
tee and Executive Committee sub-
ject to certain restraints. It was also
discovered that there is presently a
regulation allowing for a_ student
representative on the faculty Lec-
tures Committee. Although the ap-
pointment of a student representative
has been allowed to lapse over the
years, the EC intends to address
itself to the matter shortly.

In what the EC termed the
recommendation that “touch(es)
most directly upon the character of
student/faculty relationships,” the
EC called for a reconstitution of
the Student Affairs Committee. The
EC proposal would have a ten mem-
ber committee composed of five fac-
ulty and five student members, thus
necessitating cooperation between
both groups.

The EC also turned its attention
to the faculty rules listed under
“Faculty Regulations Governing
Student Behavior.” These deal with
drinking, immorality, gambling, fra-
ternity house parties, fraternity and
dormitory parietals, cuts and limita-
tions on activities of students with
sub-par Grade Point Ratios.

Among the modifications suggest-
ed was that the section “explicitly
forbidding intoxication, immorality
and gambling is a position which

THE RING-TUM PHI VEA survey finds student concern
for new and traditional problems

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Two sets of cobwebs

For an entire semester we patiently watched the spiders
in the Student Center spin webs around the Executive Com-
mitteemen as we waited for them to move. Today there are
a few annoyed spiders.

The report approved last night was thorough, long over-
due and excellent. However, that a comprehensive study of
student affairs and faculty regulations has not been made for
twelve years reflects the languid apathetic nature of our stu;
dent government. It is commendable that this year’s EC has
turned its attention to this most significant area of student in-
volvement, thus lifting itself from the depths of inertia which
should be—but have not been—anathema to such a group.

Perhaps one explanation for the listless mature of our,
student government is the stranglehold of the in loco parentis |

structure of regulations enforced through the SAC. We fully
agree with the EC subcommittee which wrote the report that
such a structure is an obstruction to the free exchange of
ideas on which a university must be based. We earnestly hope
the faculty will cooperate in this re-examination of regula-
tions and committees.

No longer a choice

“Contact” number six has come and gone, but “Con-
tact’s” passing will be regrettéd more than usual this year.
The one hundred twenty women who were a part of the total
life here for a week, are now, like “Contact”, simply part
of our history.

We seriously challenge anyone who can still be opposed
to coeducation for W&L. True, the women were only here
for five short days. But look back at those five days when
coeducation was on trial. The week was marked by pleasant,
orderly, intellectual and rewarding campus activity. But more
important, there was a real and natural atmosphere circulat-
ing throughout the campus which was evident in and out of
the classroom, and which refreshingly replaced the stale
odor of superficiality usually encountered.

We, moreover, did not have to struggle to perceive the
change. A mere stroll into such diverse spots as the tavern
or, say, Howe Hall was all the effort needed. This validated
one of the major points proponents of coeducation have
been arguing. Likewise, the order of the week completely
discredited those who used to claim coeducation would be
disruptive of the academic life of the community. The ex-
periment did not degenerate into a party, as some critics
feared.

The only academic apple-cart that could possibly be
spilled if W&L decides to become a coeducational institu-
tion is that one containing the interesting but slightly off-
color anecdotes used occasionally by professors to spice
lectures. But all of these are by nature subject to removal
or else to polishing or sugar-coating, both of which are
relatively speedy operations.

Another choice argument in the arsenal of opponents
to coeducation is that such a change would destroy our time-
honored traditions. This contention is first of all open to a
question of definition. What traditions still exist? If some can
be yet conjured up, so what if they die? (If they would have
to die at all.) The time has arrived when we must abandon
sentimentality and nostalgic emotions. It may be difficult
to see them go, but they are no longer capable of resisting
hard facts:
® Coeducation will improve the academic life of the Uni-

versity. We currently discriminate by sex in admissions

against some forty per cent of our national college
population.

® The declining trend in our male admission applications
in part is traceable to being non-coeducational.

® A sexually segregated society is unnatural, be it in or
out of the classroom.

® The orderliness of Co-ed Week, early in the semester,
justifies the faith placed in the average student by pro-
ponents of coeducation.

 

* ’
Contacting a friend

A few months ago we published a short editorial solicit-
ing used paperback books for the barren shelves in the
student center library. Fully aware that our hope for student
res would transgress the limits of rationality, we never-
theless tried. We failed totally.

But in the long run our failure allowed success. Mr.
Ted Powers, the Roanoke television personality who twice
visited the campus last week as a guest of the University
in the “Contact” program, has saved the day for our little
cause. When Mr. Powers entered that comfortably fur-
nished room last Wednesday afternoon, he was apparently
impressed by the ugly coldness of the nude mahogany shelves
which gloomily encroach from three sides.

Acting simply and generously as a friend of the Uni-
versity, Mr. Powers turned over his “Contact” honorarium
to Mr. Ken Lane to purchase books to generate at least a
non-hostile atmosphere for the library. Hopefully, this gift
from outside the University will shame some of our native

Shylocks. Thank you, Mr. Powers.

(Editor’s Note: This article is
compiled from data and general
news releases supplied by the Vir-
ginia Education Association. The
allusions to the W&L campus are
editorial.)

@ Virginia students lack heroes,

@ Seventy-eight percent of those

surveyed would like to see mari-

juana laws relaxed.

@ Seventy-eight per cent of Vir-

ginia student leaders would like

more blacks at their college.

@ Forty-one per cent believe

that students on their campus

are becoming more in favor of
student protests.

@ The Vietnam War bothers

students more than any other

present day problem.

These are a few facts stemming
from a Virginia Education Associa-
tion survey of newspaper editors
and student body presidents on all
Virginia campuses.

Not surprisingly, the students sur-
veyed expressed great concern about
the Vietnam War. Sixty-one per cent
said student activists on their campus
have more concern about the war
than any other issue, which cer-
tainly is true at W&L.

Describing their position on the
war, 41 per cent of the students
polled said they were “strongly dov-
ish;” 28 per cent said “mildly dov-
ish.” Only nine per cent considered
themselves “strongly hawkish” while
14 per cent rated themselves “mildly
hawkish.”

A war-related issue which many
student leaders denounced was draft
methods, Many students recom-
mended the lottery system. (This
survey was taken before the lottery
came into being.) Many also recom-
mended abolishing compulsory mili-
tary service and replacing it with a
well-paid volunteer army.

Student advice

ential polls have been taken by the
Dance Board to discern the likes
and dislikes of the student body
concerning entertainment. This year.
once again, Dance Board shal!
solicit the opinions of the students,
however, a new factor of import-
ance has entered the scene. There-
fore the Dance Board asks the
especial cooperation of the mem-
bers of the student body.

University’s schedule to the 12-12-6
semester system mext year, there
comes a corresponding change in
the calendar of the Dance Board.
Such a transition brings many new
questions which will have to be
considered. Underlying such prob-
lems will be the basic considerations
of the number of concerts which
should be planned and of the type
of emphasis which should be placed
upon them, that of quality or that
of quantity. As future president of
the Dance Board, I feel that the
the most satisfactory solutions will
be resolved only by asking the stu-
dents exactly what they desire in
terms of numbers and types.

The Dance Board exists only for
the students, and therefore it is the
responsibility of the Dance Board to
communicate with the students and
vice versa. During this past year
we have atiempied to yield to stu-
dent demands to the besi of our
ability and resources in the selection
of entertainers. We have brought as
diverse a group of performers as
possible and in addition have im-
proved the sound quality of their
performances through the purchase
of new speakers. We have attempted
to have a8 Many conceris as pos-
sible. this being exemplified beat by
the addition of two extra concerts
in the spring and fall

But, because of the new schedul
ing sysiem which has been initiated,
we afe forced to renew our efforis
to fulfill the needs and desires of
the student body, This effort will be
manifested in a questionnaire which
will be distributed in the Common
and in the fraternity houses. The
comments and responses from this
will serve as a guideline the
Dance Hoard when composing next
years schedule: they will tell us
exactly what type of entertainment
and what amounts our fellow mem

hetween the Dance Hoard and the

student body

Besides the military draft and
war, the students polled expressed
concern about marijuana laws, racial
discrimination, the 18-year-old vote
issue, college paternalism, irrelevant
college courses and poverty.

Concerning racial matters at their
school, 78 per cent of the respond-
ents said they would like to have
more Negro students attend their
college.

Several student leaders complain-
ed that their college’s admission
policies were not conducive to in-
creasing Negro enrollment. There
has been much interest at W&L this
year in increasing Negro enrollment.

Forty-five per cent of the respond-
ents said that racial tensions were
no problem at all on their campus
(W&L would obviously fall into this
category); 30 per cent said they
were not often a problem. Only
three per cent described racial ten-
sions as often being a problem.

Eighty-five per cent felt that col-
leges should offer black history and
culture courses; 81 per cent said
race should be discussed more in
college social studies. The sociology
department here offers two courses
that study these areas. ¢

When asked how students on their
campus feel about student protests,
41 per cent of the respondents said
students are becoming more in favor
of them. This is probably not true
of W&L since the administration/
faculty has in the past been attentive
to student opinion, thus there has
been little need to protest.

(Forty-four per cent said that
question did not apply to their cam-

pus,- reflecting the relatively peace-
ful atmosphere at many Virginia
campuses.)

The students questioned seemed
to agree that most college students
want to promote social discussion
and change. Thirty per cent of the
respondents said students are trying
“a great deal” to do this; 56 per
cent said they are trying “some-
what.” Although the picture may be
changing, W&L probably is in-
cluded in the “somewhat” area.

Almost coming forth as a unified
front, 95 per cent of the college
students surveyed said it is “very
important” to have student repre-
sentation in policy making on their
campus.

Eighty-four per cent said most
students “want more” participation
in making campus policies since it
would make students better able to
understand the problems and aims
of their administrators, and con-
versely the administrators better able
to understand student positions.

Seventy-eight per cent of the
student leaders would like to get
representation on the Board of
Trustes; 60 per cent believe these
student representativs should have
voting powers. Students from
W&L have been invited to sit
with the Board, but in a non-voting
capacity.

One respondent summed up this
sentiment: “Students, not their par-
ents or the administrators, live under
the college regulations, so they
should have a say in the policies
which affect them.”

Student Center featuring combos,
‘Sem night’ as Cockpit activities

By ROY CARLTON

Washingion and Lee's Student
Center the past two weekends has
had a social schedule which would
be the envy of any fraiernity.
Combo parties have been featured
on Saturday nights and according
to the Center's social director, Ken
Lane. the practice will continue for
the rest of the year.

The only weekend in which Lane
does not foresee a pariy in the
Cenier will be Springs weekend,
because “we're not trying to com-
pete with the fraternities.”

The social program has received
iis impetus from the recently passed
Student Center budget. Funds of
$1,000 dollars have been provided
for this years functioning by the
University. Admission is presently
being charged ai the parties to sup
plement the budget.

In addition to the combo parties
the Center is adding a new dimen-
sion to weekday fights with a
planned “Sem nighi.” Beginning
next Tuesday night, beer will be
reduced from 25 cents to 20 cents
4 flass on Tuesday nights. This
is expected to encourage girls from
Southern Seminary to come over
to WAL. A irial run for this idea
was conducted all last week during
Contact. Beer prices were reduced
due to the influx of girls fer Co
ed Week with the effect that the
Cockpit was jammed every night.

The two combo parties in the
Cockpit to date have been very
successful. According to Mr. Lane.
We have a capacity of 150 and
is Been filled both ime” The
bands have been coniracted through
an agent in Roanoke. The first com
bo was the “VIPs.” while the sec
ond lhe lohan
This weekend's sounds will be pre

are being made to provide varied
types of mutsic.

The combos play from 9:00-11:30
at night with beer being served until
twelve. The combos stop early to
allow the tables to be cleared, be-
cause Virginia state law requires all
beer to be off the tables by mid-
night. At present there is a one
dollar per person admission charge
to the combos although there is a
possibility that there may be one
or two free combos later in the
year.

Most of the people who have at-
tended the past two parties have been
W&L men with dates, although
there have been some stags. Siags
were more noticeable last Saturday
due to the snowstorm. The crowds
were large, however, there has been
plenty of room for dancing re
maiming

demics. Seventy-eight per cent think
they should have more say in decid-
ing curriculum. However, the stu-
dent leaders did not express much
interest in having more say in con-
ducting classes or determining
grades,

But they definitely want to be
heard on other campus matters.
Seventy-seven per cent said students
should have more say in making
social rules; 56 per cent said stu-
dents should have more say in dis-
ciplining those who break social
rules. This was a special concern
here as recently as last fall when
the IFC petitioned for total con-
trol over its own affairs.

When asked to judge how well
administrators are listening to stu-
dents, 72 per cent of the respondents
said that administrators on their
campus would listen and consider
each student’s suggestion, which
seems to be the case on this campus.
However, while there may not be a
lack of communication often there
is a lack of administrative action‘
from the student’s viewpoint. Al- —
though administrators are willing to
talk, students have not always seen
enough results to satisfy them.

Looking at their total college ex-
perience, 86 per cent of the respond-
ents feel that it is very important
in preparing them for a full and
useful life, but they attached less
importance to their studies. Only
36 per cent described their courses
as very important alone in prepar-
ing them for a full and useful life.
Therefore, living on campus is what
84 per cent recommended for stu-
dents who want to derive the most
benefit from college.

Concerning hero worship in an
admirability poll, less than $0 per
cent of the respondents called any
one man “very admirable.” Rating
the highest was Martin Luther King,
closely followed by John F. Ken-
nedy.

In the “not very admirable” cate-
gory, Eldridge Cleaver came in
first with 48 per cent rating him as
such. Runner-up in this category
was President Nixon with 28 per
cent of the students awarding him
this dubious achievement.

Forty-seven per cent of the res-
pondents said that, by and large,
their parents would not rate these
people the same as they did.

Besides thinking they have dif-

Gingold’s language

Editor, Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I was fortunate enough to be one
of the co-eds participating in las!
week's Co-ed Week. I say “for-
tunate” because I found “Contact”
to be not only enjoyable, but highly
rewarding. | did, however, regret
being at “Contact” at times. These
times were when Mr. Jeff Gingold
decided to draw attention to him-
self with his superb displays of
obscene language.

I have been told by many people
that Mr. Gingold is intelligent; if
this is so, he does an excellent job
of hiding that fact. No intelligent
person would find it necessary to
resort to the sort of tactics Mr.
Gingold frequently employs to make
his position clear.

- Mr Gingold has every right to
exfress his opinions—1 don't deny
that. It is truly lamentable, how-
ever, that a person of Mr. Gingold’s
reputed intelligence must behave in
a manner reserved exclusively for
those of questionable character and
background.

“Magic Mel” works his way in for another lay-up

—photo by Casselle

Road trip brings an upset

It was a pretty good trip down
to Mars Hill, North Carolina for the
varsity basketball team. But it must
have seemed twice as long on the
way back to Washington and Lee.
The reason was an unfortunate en-
counter with the Mars Hill basket-
ball squad. Somehow, Mars Hill did
not roll over and die, instead they
slew the Generals. The score was
87-79 and the details were grue-
some.

Mars Hill had gone completely
gung-ho on the idea of gunning
down the Generals. They were up
for the game to an extent that is
hard to believe. As for the Generals,
they had not yet recovered from
their whipping from Old Dominion
College last weekend.

The game itself was close up
until the end. Fouls hurt Washing-
ton and Lee badly but the excellent
foul shot percentage for Mars Hill

was even more deadly. The boys
in blue had the lead, but as was
the case against O.D.C., they were
forced to relinquish their margin
because of a late surge by the
opponents.

“Magic Mel” Cartwright pumped
in 23 points in the losing effort.
Lean and mean Mike Neer con-
tributed 17 points and 20 rebounds.
Close behind the big men were Stu
Fauber with 13 points and Captain
Norwood Morrison who put in 12
points.

Coach Canfield’s team has reach-
ed a record of 13-6. However, if
you look ahead on the schedule,
you will find tough obstacles still
ahead. V.C.U. has already beaten
WAL by seven. Fairleigh-Dickinson
is an Outstanding small college team,
even when trapped in Doremus.
And finally, don't forget what hap-
pened in the C.A.C. last year de-
pite what all the experts believed!

West Virginia Wesleyan GH
Loyola flushed out of pool

Three big records fell as the
W&L_ natators swept to a_ pair,
of massive victories over Loyola of
Baltimore: and West Virginia Wes-
leyan. The 400 yard freestyle relay
team of Roger Martin, Bim Clark,
Alan Corwith and Bill Brumback
set the new record of 3:06.6 seconds
as the Generals overpowered Loyola
72-32 on Friday evening.

On Saturday afternoon, the 400
yard medley relay team of Roger
Martin, Price Blackford, Bim Clark,
and Bill Brumback combined for a
new school and pool record of
3:34.8 seconds, while Clark scored

 

a 1:57.9 second time in the 200
yard butterfly to set a new school
and pool record as W&L glided
over West Virginia Wesleyan 65-38.
The Generals end their dual meets
with a 5-2 record.

Bert Meem led the charge in the
Loyola meet winning both the 1000
yard freestyle with a 11:55.5 score
and the 200 butterfly event with
2:09.9 second performance. The
Generals opened with the team of
Roger Martin, John Lawlor, With-
ers Davis, and Mike Kirshbaum

winning the 400 yard medley relay

EC passes report on
faculty regulations along

with parking motion

(Continued from Page 1)
can(not) reasonably be inforced.”
The EC recommended that punish-
ment for extreme actions of
this code should be left to the SAC,
but that the code as a strict regula-
tion should be dropped.

The EC also struck a blow for
the autonomy of the IFC by asking
that supervision and control of the
hours and number of fraternity
house parties should be left to the
IFC, Faculty regulation of such mat-
ters was thought to impair the ability
of the IFC “to exercise positive
and forthright leadership.”

The EC declined to make any
specific suggestions as to parietals,
but it did note that the current
policy of faculty control was not in
keeping with general philosophy
which the EC’s report represented.
Rather, the EC expressed the idea
that “parietals should be controlled
exclusively by those members mak-
ing up any given residential com-
munity.”

Upon turning its attention to ex-
tracurricular activities, the EC ex-
pressed doubt whether over-exten-
sion into activities was the cause
of sub-par grades. In light of this,
the committee suggested three
things: 1) students on academic pro-
bation should be allowed to partici-
pate in one extracurricular activity,
2) academic qualifications for candi-
dates for certain specified positions
should be changed from requiring
both a 2.00 cumulative average and
a 2.00 on work in the previous
semester to require only that the
student have a 2.00 cumlative aver-
age, provided the student is not on
academic probation, 3) restrictions
on activities should be removed for
all students with a cumulative 2.00
average not on academic probation.

The above report was proposed
as a motion by Law representative
Phil Thompson and was passed

unanimously.

Survey studies students’ concerns and problems

(Continued from Page 2)
ferent heroes than their parents,
many college students probably
would say they have different opin-
ions concerning the use of drugs.

Seventy-eight per cent of the stu-
dents surveyed said laws concern-
ing marijuana should be made less
strict. Eighty-one per cent said
there should be more drug educa-
tion on their campus; 59 per cent
said use of drugs is increasing, as
it seems to be here.

Although they noted an increase
in misuse of drugs, student leaders
rated alcohol as more of a problem
than drugs. Thirty-six per cent called
alcohol “often” a problem while
only 13 per cent called drugs “often”
a problem.

When estimating the percentage
of students who use marijuana, 16
per cent of the respondents said 50
to 80 per cent of their peers use
it; 30 per cent of the respondents
said that 25 to 49 per cent of their
peers use it; and 30 per cent said
10 to 24 per cent of their peers
use it.

The estimations of the percentage
of students using other drugs such
as LSD, Speed, and barbituates were

much lower than the marijuana use
estimates, generally in the 0-5 per
cent range.

Eighty-three per cent of the res-
pondents said they personally knew
someone who has used drugs, Thirty-
six per cent said they did not think
most students who use drugs knew
what they could do to them physi-
cally and mentally, but 42 per cent
said they thought students did know
what drugs could do.

In another question related to
the personal lives of their college
peers, the student leaders seemed to
evade making moral judgements.
When asked how students on their
campus would react to an unmar-

ried couple living together, 48 per
cent of the respondents said most
students would think it “was none
of their business.” Twenty-three per
cent said most students would think
it “was okay.”

Considering premarital sex, 66 per
cent of the student leaders said
most students would think it is “up
to the individual;” 23 per cent said
they would think “it is okay under
some circumstances;” only six per
cent said they would think it is
“always wrong.”

However, only 13 per cent of the
respondents rated sexual promiscuity
as a problem on their campus; 36
per cent said it was not a problem.

City Counci

lto Consider

Property Tax on Students

Students living in Lexington dur-
ing the nine-month school session
may soon be required to pay a cily
tax on personal property.

Lexington Commissioner of Reve-
nue I. C. Baker has been studying
the possibility of such a tax for nine
months. He has prepared a report
for submission to City Council at a
later date.

City Council has not yet received
or discussed the report.

rhe study considers the possibility
of assessing the personal property of
students living in Lexington. It also

considers requiring city license tags
on students’ cars.

It deals with the revenue expected
and the legality of such a move.

The study was begun last year
after Virginia Attorney General
Robert Y. Button ruled that stu-
dents living in Virginia cities during
the regular nine-month school ses-
sion may be legally taxed by those
cities,

If passed by City Council, the or-
dinance would probably require stu-
dents to buy city license tags or to
pay a flat fee for tangible personal
property, Baker said.

Some students are already being
assessed by the city—among them
students who have registered to vote
in Lexingion or who are employed
in the city. They are required to pay
a nominal personal property tax,
Baker said.

Baker said the city government
needs more revenue, and students
are the logical answer to the prob-
lem. He pointed out that one-third
of the city’s land is owned by Wash-
ington and Lee and Virginia Mili-
tary Institute, which are tax-exempt.

He also noted that students drive
on city streets more than local resi-
dents, use most of the parking
spaces, and require use of the police
department and other city services,

The position of the council
year, and remains this year, is that
no definite action will be taken
without adequate solicitation of stu-
dent opinion. The council is plan-
ning, when the measure is brought
up, to invite representatives from
the Washington and Lee and Vir-
ginia Military Institute student gov-
ernments to sit in on the meeting
and offer their opinions.

The Ring-tum Phi An Evaluation of the EC Report

Friday

Friday, February 20, 1970

Anachronism Challenged

The faculty is soon to be confronted with the most seri-
ous threat to the in loco parentis approach to student affairs
to be posed in some years. It comes in the form of the Stu-
dent Body Executive Committee report on “Student Af-
fairs and Faculty Regulations” and is in our judgment a
significant departure from the past in more ways than the
possibility for meaningful action it will afford student organi-
zations, which the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi noted.

It is difficult for us to understand why the faculty or ad-
ministration should seek to concern itself with the private
lives of its students. Henry Steele Commager, in the most
recent issue of the Saturday Review (‘‘Has the Small College
a Future?”), traces the source of the in loco parentis struc-
ture to the time when the American college served basically as
a prep school and was therefore expected not only to instill
fundamental knowledge but to inculcate and enforce moral
precepts as well.

But that certainly does not explain its present function
nor why schools are so reluctant to alter their rules as a re-
sponse to the changed nature of the students they must deal
with. The only explanation we can offer is that a basic lack
of respect for student maturity underlies present thinking on
the matter.

It seems to us that the suggested rule emendations follow
two basic directions. On the one hand, the faculty is advised
to dissociate itself from matters of private concern, and on the
other, it is enjoined to allow student representatives a
greater voice in the governing of the University on matters
that concern them.

The infeasibility of enforcing a particular moral code on
a student body as decentralized as W&L’s is can be readily
demonstrated. More important, of course, is the larger ques-
tion of enforcing any moral code which does not deal directly
with the maintenance of the community and which does not
contribute to the ends it seeks. The advisability of allowing
students a larger voice in the managing of the University’s
affairs is equally apparent if one is to note the result of stu-
dent exclusion from the locus of power in other schools. In
this area the EC’s demands show a reasonableness and self-
determination remarkable for a body that is nearly as con-
strained and excluded as the student body it represents.

Neither aspect of this effort is in our view unreasonable
in principle and its formulation in the report is a sensible and
progressive, in some cases almost cautious, response to the
present situation. And we consider its acceptance, at least
regarding major points, vital to the atmosphere of mutual
respect with which any serious institution of higher learning
should proceed.

The Wrong Problem

The removal of the sanction of an Executive Committee
student body assessment from CONTACT seriously, and un-
necessarily, jeopardizes the existence of that program. While
Student Body President Swede Henberg has a point in with-
holding the assessment, we wonder whether he hasn’t acted
rashly in so endangering that week of speeches and seminars.

Henberg correctly observed that the position of CON.
TACT chairman is selected by the Interfraternity Council,
which contributes a major portion of the funds for CON.
TACT and which conceived of the idea. Such a selection, it is
true, virtually excludes the possibility of a non-fraternity
chairman.

Yet, after all, no matter who gets the prestige, the entire
academic community profits in a program that is one of the
most significant activities students execute. As a matter of
fact, it seems at least as inequitable that fraternity men pay
the IFC assessment as well as the student body assessment tor
roughly the same privileges as every body else. It strikes us a5
odd that Henberg should choose to focus on who is allowed
the prestige rather than on who benefits as a means to dex ide
upon whom the cost should fall

There are rumors that a compromise solution is to be
offered, and because the problem Henberg motes is a real

By Monty Cottier

The report on Student Affairs and
Faculty Regulations, prepared by
an EC subcommittee consisting of
Swede Henberg, Dave Bethea, Bill
Andrews and Glenn Azuma, has
been turned over to the Student Af-
fairs Committee of the faculty. The
report was prepared without faculty
foreknowledge, and is being pre-
sented as the work and wishes of
the EC alone. Never secretive, Hen-
berg has shown a willingness to dis-
cuss the proposals of the report, but
he declined to speculate on the re-
actions of the faculty to it, saying,
“IT have learned never to anticipate
the actions of the faculty.”

A statement from the introduc-
tion should serve to give an idea
of the basic purpose of the pro-

posals outlined in the report. Speak-
ing of the right of the faculty to reg-
ulate student affairs, the authors,
while recognizing this right, go on
to state, “we do, however, question
whether for the sake of the com-
munity as a whole the concept of
in loco parentis remains viable and
healthy.” They continue with the
opinion that “many current regula-
tions are impositions on students
and faculty alike.”

Admitting the injustice of allow-
ing students to control matters which
would by their nature extend longer
than the student’s ordinary four-
year tenure (meaning questions in-
volving the academics and admini-
stration of the school itself), the
committee addressed its attention
for the most part to the question of
regulations governing social func-
tions. They asked for students to be
represented on faculty committees
(such as the Admissions Committee,

the Courses and Degrees Commit-
tee, the Lectures Committee, and
the Student Affairs Committee)

where they are either not now rep-
resented, or have no vote, and in the
latter case to give them a vote on
matters pertaining to student mat
ters.

Professor Riegel (right) confers with director Philippe Labro (left) and French Film star Jean-Claude Bouillon
Labro’s film “Tout Peut Arriver” in Lexington,

As regards the decisions of the
committees as a whole, the sugges-
tion was made that these decisions
be posted on the ODK board, so
that the students as well as the
teachers might have an idea of how
events stood.

Admissions, Courses and Degrees,
Lectures, and, in a rather different
manner, Student Affairs and faculty
EC, were all handled in much the
same manner: by suggesting that a
student be placed on the committee.
Of course, this is not equally true
for all of them: for instance, a stu-
dent is already allowed on both Lec-
tures and the faculty EC, but in the

first case all memory of this privi
lege had been lost, and in the sec
ond, he has no vote. (A voting mem-
bership is one of the prime requests
of the report). The Student Affairs
Committee came in for a great deal
of attention as regards the regula-
tion of the students’ social life. Of
course, since the students would be
allowed to vote only on matters di-
rectly concerning student affairs, the
chairmen of these committees would
be the ones to determine just what
constituted such matters.

In the area of social life men
tioned earlier, the report favors the
abolition of the sections of the Fac

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I found Lawrence McConnell’s
review Of Ramsey Clark’s speech
here such a web of miscomprehen-
sion and dangerous cliche that it
demands a reply.

Clark’s stated purpose was to turn
our attention away from high-
sounding phrases about law and
order, however edifying, to a com-
prehension of the social conditions
that breed lawlessness. Unless we
thus shift our focus, we shall have
neither law nor order, much less
justice.

McConnell never touches the
point. Instead he draws a distinc-
tion between respect for and obedi
ence of the law: while he agrees with
Clark that the former is too much
to expect of the slum dweller, he
accuses him of disfavoring support
for the latter. The embedded infer-
ence is fallacious, of course, and the
assertion that Clark is soft on en-
forcement all the more surprising
in view of his repeated assertion
that the laws we have must be en-
forced even when questionable or
unjust. (Cf. his comments on the
“Boston Five”.)

So the main point was missed,
but in the course of his incompre
hension McConnell makes several
ancillary mistakes, a couple of
which are worth clearing up. For
example, he sees a contradiction be-
tween Lincoln’s view that the law
must be worshipped with zeal bor-
dering on the religious and our pres-
ent view that laws change with soc-
ial conditions. There is no contra-
diction, here, unless McConnell
strangely opposes the distinction be-
tween law generically understood
and particular instantiations of it,
i.e., particular laws, He also sees a
contradiction between the democra
tic principle of equality before the
law and the recognition that the
law has different effects in different
social conditions . . . but again he’s
wrong. This is not a contradiction,
but the juxtaposition of a statement
of fact and a statement of hope:
we all, (Clark, McConnell, me) wish
for equality before the law. The fact
is that we don’t have it. Further, it
simply not follow that such
equality must await the homogeniza
tion of social conditions, nor, of

ties

The question of absence policies
was dealt with by requesting un
limited cuts for all but freshmen,

pointing out that the current practice
of allowing unlimited absences to
persons on the Dean’s List puts cuts
in the position of privileges awarded

to the persistent few. Tied in with
this is the subcommittee’s reccom
mendations on the matter of the

limitation of activities for students
on academic probation. The report
suggested that such students be al
lowed one activity other than those
specified under rule nine of Student
Activities, pointing out that few, if
any, students do poorly because
they overextended themselves. The
report finished with a recommenda-
tion in this same vein, stating that
instead of the current requirement
of a 2.00 cumulative and a 2.00 on
the previous semester both being re
quired for activities, the rule should
simply hold for a 2.00 cumulative
grade,

What exactly do these proposals
mean? As far as I can tell, they are
important much for what
they say themselves (although this
is certainly a vital part of it) as for
what they imply. Naturally, they
contain long-needed reforms and
changes, and these changes, if in
stituted, will do a great deal towards
loosening the restrictions on the stu
dents. However, the idea of remov
ing the university's role of acting
in loco parentis has a great many
more logical extensions than the re

in the second state-wide meet to be
held. The defending champions, the
University of Virginia, did not al-
tend the meet. Their chances of de-
feating the favored William and
Mary were negligible, so they have
stayed home to tune up for their
upcoming conference championship.

Coach Stearns, too, is preparing
his swimmers for the C.A.C,. cham-
pionship next week. He hopes for
the Generals to capture a second in
this meet which include two William

the Hampton Institute. Coach
Stearns mentioned that the William
and Mary team appears to be the
strongest team ever assembled in
Virginia’s immediate history.
Looking back at his team’s 5-2
season record, Coach Stearn’s ex-
pressed satisfaction with the results,
Two of the meets—Catholic and Old
Dominion—were hard fought meets
in which the Blue natators perform-
ed well. The outstanding performers
this year have been All-America
Bill Brumback, freshman Alan Cor-
with, and Bim Clark. Brumback has
already qualified to participate in
the national swimming champion-
ships again this year. Both Corwith
and Clark have come very close to
qualifying while setting school and
C.A.C, conference records in theit
events. Clark won last year’s most

better than most of the other
schools. Our competition has prob-
ably been better throughout the

When asked to choose a favorite,

An Evaluation Of The EC Report

(Continued from Page 2)

port itself mentions.

Of course, the report itself is
merely a logical extension of the
various rules and regulations re-

cently adopted by the faculty, such
as the parietals, liquor in the dorms,
cars for freshmen, and so on, which
in their turn were complements of
the decisions to remove the enforce-
ment of conventional dress.

As far as these concrete proposals
go, they will have the effect of lib-
eralizing the restrictions under
which the student must currently
operate. The faculty will realize that
the University no longer serves as
both a home and school for pubes-
cent boys, and that men attend col-
lege today at an age when, in years
past, they would have been married
and working for several years. Fur-
ther, these changes will, as most

An Answer to McConnell

(Continued from Page 2)

course, did Clark say or imply any-
thing like this. But things get worse.

The most astounding bit of ab-
surdity in the entire article comes
when McConnell ventures into the
field of social theory. What is one
to do with the statement that, “The
individual liberty upon which this
country was founded inherently and
necessarily breeds (sic) the inner
(sic) quality of one’s economic con-
dition”. Where does one begin?
Presumably, McConnell doesn't
blame Harlem on the Bill of Rights,
so he must mean that our Adam
Smith capitalism is responsible for
the slums and poverty in America.
Suppose this were true: then we
should have sufficient reason to give
up capitalism. (It is not self-evident,
as McConnell seems to assert that
the liberty essential to a liberal de-
mocracy depends on a free market-
place.) But, of course, it is not true,
because (a) we do not, nor have we
ever had, an Adam Smith capitalism,
(has McConnell never taken econo-
mics?) and (b) because the slums
we have cannot be accounted for
simply in terms of economics, (has
McConnell never heard of slavery?)

Finally, McConnell treats us to a
cliche, (“some injustice will always
exist”), a half-truth hovering be-
tween metaphysics and pragmatics
As a metaphysical statement, it is
probably true, but since Clark's, my,
and presumably MecConnell's con-
cerns are not cosmic but specific, he
surely doesn't so intend it in this
context. Instead, it has the same
effect here that, e.g., the response,
“Boys will be boys” has in the face
of My Lai, or the response “The
poor have ye always with ye” in the

changes do, become less and less
startling and radical with each year,
until people will begin wondering,
as they do now about some of the
regulations during President Lee's
administration, how intelligent peo-
ple could enforce such prohibitions.
Today, Washington and Lee is
not the bastion of conservatively
dressed, convention (and regulation)-
conscious men it Once was, but, on
the other hand, men don’t rise when
a professor enters the lecture room
and remain standing until he tells
them to be seated (as they once did).
Times change, and in this era of in-
volvement and the mutual exchange
of ideas (rather than the deliverance
unto the classes of Lectures from
the Hill) as the basis of education,
the concept of in loco parentis will
go the way of mortarboards and
gowns as daily apparel and Greek
and Latin as mandatory studies.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 24, 1970

Number 31

 

 

Kevin
Raymond
Baker
1949-1970

Kevin Raymond Baker, a
junior at Washington and Lee,
was fatally injured in an auto-
mobile accident near Woodstock,
Virginia early Sunday morning.

An outstanding student, Kevin
had been in several positions of
leadership upon the campus. In
addition to being an honor roll
student, he excelled in debating
and served as co-captain of the
team during this year. This past
Spring Kevin was elected to the
Executive Committee as a repre-
sentative for the Junior class.
Baker was also a member of
Kappa Alpha Order.

Born in 1949 in Arlington,
Kevin was the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Raymond E. Baker of
Lynchburg. Suriving Baker be-
sides his parents are his two
brothers, Gregory and Dylan, a

sister, Lisa, all of Lynchburg,
and his maternal grandmother,
Mrs. James A. Toomey of

Washington, D.C.

Kevin was an_ outstanding
member of the debate team dur-
ing his short tenure as captain
of the team. Throughout his
three years of participation in
this activity, Kevin accumulated
numerous regional and national
awards for his oratorical talents.
At the time of the accident he
was returning from a _ debate
tournament at Dartmouth Col-
lege in Hanover, New Hamp-
shire.

Phe fatal accident occurred at
about 5 a.m. Sunday when the
car in which he was riding hit a
guard rail and spun out of con-
trol. Following the accident
police were unable to determine
which of the three riders was
the driver. They did venture that
the driver apparently fell asleep
at the wheel. Kevin was immedi-
ately rushed to Woodstock Hos-
pital along with Professor Chaf-
fin and fellow student Tim
Wright, but was pronounced
dead on arrival.

A low Mass was given in his
respect at 11:00 a.m. this morn-
ing in his native diocese at Holy
Cross Roman Catholic Church
in Lynchburg. A liturgy of the
dead was given last night at
8:00 at the Whitten Funeral
Home

 

 

 

 

Dr. William Frankena, philosophy professor at the University of
Michigan, will speak in Lee Chapel next week.

Visiting lecturers will
discuss varied topics

A series of outstanding lecturers
begins tomorrow with the appear-
ance in Lee Chapel of Dr. Rocce
Paone, a foreign affairs expert from
the United States Naval Academy
at Annapolis. He will be followed
next week by Dr. Bernard Knox,
an expert in classical Greek and
Dr. William Frankena, a philosophy
professor from the University of
Michigan. The following week will
be highlighted by an appearance
by Dr. Jacques Harde, a French
scholar at the University of North
Carolina.

With the exception of Dr. Paone,
all of the speakers are appearing
under the sponsorship of the Uni-
versity Center in Virginia.

Dr. Paone will speak tomorrow
night in the Chapel on the topic of
the “Nature of Soviet Activity in
the South Asian Periphery.” The
program will begin at 8:00 p.m.

Dr. Paone is Professor of Foreign
Affairs and Director of the Foreign
Affairs Conferences of the Naval
Academy. His son, Fred, is a sopho-
more at Washington and Lee

Dr. Bernard Knox, director of
the Center for Hellenic Studies, in
Washington, D. C., will speak at

Memorial services set for Lee Chapel,

to be conducted by Sprunt and Hodges

Plans have been finalized for a
memorial service to be given to-
morrow in memory of the late Pro-
fessor William W. Chaffin and Kevin
R. Baker. They were fatally in-
jured in an automobile accident just
north of Woodstock, Va. early Sun-
day morning.

The service will be held in the
Lee Chapel at 1:00 p.m. and should
be over by 1:15 in order that it
will not conflict with luncheon
schedules at the fraternity houses.

Services will be conducted jointly
by Dean David W. Sprunt and Dr.
Louis W. Hodges, both of the de-
partment of Religion. Choral music
will be provided by the Washington
and Lee Glee Club under the di-
rection of Dr. Robert Stewart. The
Glee Club will sing a hymn and
will be accompanied by Alan B

GaNun, a junior, on the organ

Funeral services for Kevin Baker
were held this morning at Holy
Cross Roman Catholic Church in
Lynchburg. A low mass was said
at 11 a.m. in the church of his
native diocese. Last night a liturgy
of the dead was given at eight in
the Whitten Funeral Home. Burial
followed the funeral service.

Professor Chaffin is survived only
by his mother, Mrs. Richard B
Chaffin of Richmond, who has set
the funeral for Thursday, February
26 at 11 a.m. in the L. T. Christian
and Sons Funeral Home in Rich-
mond

In the aftermath of the tragedy
numerous Washington and Lee
activities and classes have been
postponed or cancelled. A manda-
tory University assembly was sched

uled for this morning, but it has
been cancelled subject to further
notice. Had the assembly been held,

it would have conflicted in time
with the Kevin Baker funeral
Last night the Executive Com-

mittee and the _ Inter-Fraternity
Council cancelled their meetings in
memory of the deceased. Kevin had
been a Junior class representative
on the EC. With few exceptions,
close friends of Professor Chaffin
have called off classes and those
teachers who had Kevin in their
classes have cancelled them

The third party in the accident,
junior Tim Wright from Beaumont,
Texas was at first listed as in serious
condition, but is now in fair condi-
tion at Woodstock Hospital. He suf-
fered a severe concussion and facial
lacerations

Chapel. His topic will be “Euripides,
‘The Most Tragic of the Poets’.”

Before joining the Center for
Hellenic Studies, Dr. Knox served
as a member of the faculty of Yale
University for 14 years. During the
academic year 1962-63, he was
Sather Lecturer at the University of
California.

Dr. Knox wrote the script for
and performed in four half-hour
color films for educational television
on Sophocles’ “Oedipus the King.”
He is the author of several books,
including “Oedipus at Thebes,” “The
Ajax of Sophocles,” “Oedipus the
King,” and “The Heroic Temper.”

Dr. William Frankena, professor
of philosophy at the University of
Michigan, will speak at 8:00 p.m.
Wednesday, March 4 in duPont
Auditorium. His subject will be “The
Principles of Morality.”

A member of the Michigan facu-
ity for 32 years, Dr. Frankena has
been chairman of the department
of philosophy since 1947. During
the 1968-69 academic year, he was
a Fellow at the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

Books written by Dr. Frankena
include: “Ethics, Three Historical
Philosophies of Education,” and
“Some Beliefs about Justice.” He
has been a Visiting Professor at
Columbia, Princeton, Harvard,
Washington and Tokyo universities.

Chapel on March 10 at 8:15 p.m.
His topic will be “Marcel Proust
and the Theme of Death.”

William
Wells
Chaffin
1930-1970

William Wells Chaffin, Associ-
ate Professor of English and
Speech at Washington and Lee,
was fatally injured Sunday in
an automobile accident eight
and one-half miles north of
Woodstock, Virginia.

This was the same accident in
which W&L_ student Kevin
Baker also died and Tim Wright
was seriously injured. The acci-
dent occured when the car in
which they were riding struck a
guardrail on Interstate 81. There
were no other cars involved in
the accident. Police officers on
hand said that they had not
been able to determine who was
the driver of the car, but that
the driver had apparently fallen

asleep at the wheel. The three
were returning from the Dart-
mouth Invitational Debate Tour

nament at Hanover, N. H. in
which they had participated. The
accident occurred at approxi-
mately 5 a.m. near Toms Brook.

A native of Richmond, Pro
Chaffin graduated from
the University of Richmond in
1952. He received his LL.B. from

fessor

the same institution in 1954
Further work earned him his
M.A. in Speech in 1959 from

the University of Virginia, Fol-
lowing graduate work he was
Assistant Professor of Speech at
Madison College and a part-time
instructor at U.Va. for a brief
time before coming to W&L in
1960. In 1967 he was promoted
to an Associate Professor

At Washington and Lee, Pro-
fessor Chaffin had been respon
sible for the creation of the
school’s highly successful debat-
ing program, both on the inter-
collegiate and __ intracollegiate
levels. Prior to his coming to
WAL, the school had had no
such program. Through diligent
work as debate coach Professor
Chaffin had built a consistently
superior intercollegiate team
which was probably the Univer-
sity’s most successful venture of
all in intercollegiate competition

Professor Chaffin is survived
by his mother, Mrs. Lucille W
Chaffin of Richmond, who is ar
ranging the funeral. Services will
be held on Thursday at 11:00
a.m. in Richmond

THE RING-TUM PHI

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition
Tuesday, February 24, 1970

D

No more to build on there. And they, since they
Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.

—Robert Frost

And so will we . . . but to what affairs? To what can we
turn wherein the memory of William Chaffin and Kevin Baker
and the memory of their dedication is not at the forefront.

William Chaffin was an institution of Washington and Lee

and an inspiration to a generation of debaters. His charisma
and dedication created an unmatched sense of pride within the
University and brought respect to Washington and Lee from
colleges across the nation. Our mentor-friend, honed to bril-
liance in the art of arts, has left a disproportionate void.

We lack the perspective to do justice to Kevin Baker in
this early eulogy. Kevin Baker was a bright promise, a fresh
breeze; his determination, his ability, his life, a mounting
crescendo. His death too quick a denouement.

In no respect did these two men fail to serve the Uni-
versity or to represent it admirably. They brought much and
they left much. So. We turn to our affairs.

 

Back to perambulation

Trying to find a parking space within a mile of the W&L
campus these days is about as likely as a critical overabun-
dance of applications for membership in Mr. Nixon’s newly
proposed volunteer army.

The lack of foresight of our planners in Washington Hall
is truly astonishing, especially considering the magnitude of
the current building project. It would seem that such a well
thought out construction project could have been drafted
with a little more attention to the needs of our present stu-
dents, many of whom must drive to campus.

We are certainly not criticizing the construction of the
gym addition. Under the circumstances the plea of several
University officials for students within reasonable walking
distance not to drive to campus is appropriate. Considering a
project requiring about three million dollars, however, it is
nothing less than ridiculous that ample provision for student
parking was not made for the coming eighteen month con-
struction period.

 

Geese and golden eggs

We find the report to be submitted to the Lexington City
Council concerning the possible levy of a student property
tax to be most disturbing.

We concede the contention that students who register to
vote in municipal elections could be ethically taxed by Lex-
ington. However, we do not feel that the entire student body
can be justly forced to pay local personal property taxes and
automobile license fees.

First of all, most of our parents are assessed for these
taxes in our home communities. Second, the students here
(with few exceptions) have no earned incomes. Finally, it is
no well-guarded secret that Lexington merchants greatly re-
semble in their actions and prices the proverbial vultures
ready to swoop down on some hapless student’s unsuspecting
wallet. If anyone cares to dispute this last argument, we ad-
vise him to visit Lexington during our spring vacation, and
then attempt to claim that this town does not live off W&L’s
blood.

We hold the opinion that Lexington already derives
enough of its sorely needed revenue from W&L students.
Granted that Lexington is short of capital, we frankly ob-
ject to the argument printed in the Friday Ring-tum Phi that
the students are the logical answer to this problem. Lexing-
ton does the very minimum for its nine-month visitors and it
should respect that status—not tax us as residents.

 

The grand old rag sheet

Progress is by nature valued subjectively, and as such is
often considered a cruel monster. Significant in such judg-
ments is that many events which are excused as “progressive”
are actually not. The end of the Tuesday Edition is a cruel
thing, especially to those of us who have made the Tuesday
Edition a part of ourselves. However, in this case, we feel it is
progress in that with the new Wednesday Ring-tum Phi, we
can offer our readers a better product.

The Ring-tum Phi is approaching its seventieth birthday,
but it displays considerable more vitality than most septu-
agenerians. The Tuesday Edition barely saw its twentieth
birthday, but in its short history the Tuesday Edition served
its readers well. This has not always been the best of all
possible newspapers to be sure, but neither has it been a
bad one. In the past four years at least, the Tuesday Edition
has played an important role in stimulating the broad changes
that have been initiated, and in commending and condemn-
ing when such opinion has been needed. The days of fish
coming gift-wrapped in Tuesday Phis are gone. But, crass
inflation has exerted its iniquitous force and sent the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi into history.

Organization simulations
as an aspect of PSCIRA

By JOHN MOTSINGER

International Organization simu-
lations sponsored by many schools
and groups around the country are
attempts to re-create for a_ stu-
dent group the situation found on
the floor of United Nations, NATO
and OAS meetings.

Washington and Lee has a long
history of simulation work in the
Mock Conventions held here every
four years, and started last year to
sponsor a Model Organization of
American States. Moot Court com-
petition in the Law School is another
type of simulation.

The 1970 Model OAS attempts to
provide a forum where students
from Washington and Lee and nine
East Coast colleges can debate Inter-
American policy issues, with each
of the 25 teams representing the
policy of each of the member

s individuality,

calls for thoughtful consideration

By DR. ARTHUR SCHARFF

Contact Week was a good time
for a bit of reflection as well as all
the expression and absorption. Par-
ticularly is this true when so many
seemingly brilliant and “new” ideas
are being bandied about. In some
cases, perhaps, the phosphorescence
is blinding us to what is causing it
all, Good wine comes from ferment-
ing grapes, certainly, but then so
does an awful stench, and much
just pure rot. It depends on what
the aims of the ferment are and
how it is controlled.

Washington and Lee is in the
process of working out a new cur-
riculum providing for a revolution-
ary new short term so that students
may do intensive specializing and
in-depth introspection into a favorite
field without interference from lesser
things like math, English and other
required courses. Co-eds were on
the campus for a week, will soon
be here for a year, and there is
much batting of th breeze about
their being here on a somewhat
more permanent basis.

There is discussion of increased
heterogeneity in the student body;
of attracting representatives of min-
ority groups and underprivileged
classes, even at the expense of aca-
demic standards: of encouraging in-
tense specialization rather than the
acquisition of a general background;
of practical and job-oriented train-
ing and “frill” courses: of freedom
of choice and student power; of “in
loco parentis” versus “laissez faire”;
of the value and relevance of every-
thing from pot to Plutarch.

Long hair and short hair, unisex
and homosex—there is no dearth of
books and certainly no dearth of
words, supplemented by visual aids,
projects, dramatizations, grants-in-
aid, recordings, tapes, movies on
wider and still wider screens, folk
songs and films, headbands and hap-
penings, pros and cons, semi-pros
and ex-cons—on all of this.

The real question is not so much
the value of all this as simply: Do
you really want it? And what of it
do you really want? With intensive
study programs out go long, contem-
plative sessions and semi-dull lec-
tures that require only half your
energies, along with the freedom to
cut classes with impunity when you
are suffering from the results of a
heavy night,

With co-eds out go long Spring
weekends, “down the read”, and the

thrill of having a date down for
Fancy Dress. Remember, when they
are co-eds they are not your date,
they are anybody's date; the com-
petition is there on the spot and
you have no special privileges. When
you get the feminine viewpoint too
your own is of much less impor-
tance.

With heterogeneity come unrest
and dilution as well as stimulation.
The chances of getting together with
a bunch of fellows of your own
kind who think and feel as you do is
lessened, not increased. With spec-
ialization you get less chance to ex-
plore other fields in which you
might find an interest, albeit a sec-
ondary one. Specialization is by its
very nature anathema to intellectual
curiosity. With acceleration you are
out in the world waiting in the rain
for the early morning bus down-
town much sooner, And when the
university no longer stands “in loco
parentis’, there is no other “paren-
tis”; you have to do ail those things
yourself,

Do you really want all those re-
sponsibilities sooner than you have
to? Are you really ready to take the
consequences of a faulty decision
due to inexperience? Have you even
thought out what the consequences
are? Those of us who have attended
Continental universities know that
there the university doesn’t concern
itself with your personal life or your
individual problems at all—and that
it is sometimes pretty lonely and
cold out there, too.

Washington and Lee is in many
ways a pecular school. It has a dis-
tinct individuality and a tone all
its own, both academically and soci-
ally. It caters to a rather restricted
group and offers a particular type
of education, tailored as nearly as
possible to the probable needs of
that group in exercising its func-
tions within the whole of society.
These functions are not inconsider-
able, nor are they the same as those
of numerous other groups, though
they are probably neither greater
nor less in total value. These func-
tions are not likely to disappear no
matter what changes occur in them.

Society has been undergoing
changes for so long that it is com-
pletely unreal to imagine that it is
suddenly going to stop or that any
one moment in time or any one
group of thinkers, no matter how
profound or how right, has found
the key to complete (and thorough-

Letters to the Editor...

Henberg finds fault
with Friday editorial

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

1 write in response to last Fri-
day's editorial entitled “The Wrong
Problem.” Somehow the Friday edi-
tion has come under the impression
that the B.C. has already removed
the student body assessment for
Contact. This is simply not true
as of last Friday, the topic had not
even been discussed before the Ex
ecutive Committee

ht is true as the editorial states
that | seriously question whether
giving funds from a general student
body assessmeni can be justified as

long as the chairman of Contact
is selected by the IFC. Yet the
thrust of my motion (when it is
presented) will be toward asking

that the chairman be selected by a
joint EC IFC committee
Certainly | am aware of the
danger of a fine program being lost
through the possible withholding of
the student bad Yet

this is still to be decided

mscssieni

a thatier

by the entire Executive Committee.
The “rumors of a compromise solu-
tion” seem a bit premature as it
seems to me that there is not yel
a problem—or at least wasn't before
last Priday

Finally, | agree with the edi-
torial’s observation about the exorbi-
tant cost of university cocktail par-
ties. The money for class dues is
now currently collected by the class
officers on authority of an EC
resolution passed some years ago
That resolution set no limit on the
amount collected, and the escalation
of class dues has been—admittedly
due to E.C, negligence over the past
few vears. In my mind Contact is
certainly a much more worthwhile
project than the cocktail parties,
and | stress that it is fully my
intention (and has been all year)
to ask the EC to place some reason
able upper limit on the amount col
lected for class dues. Such a resolu
tion, however, is contingent upon
the final decision as to how many
parties will be possible under the
few calendar

ly undesirable) stability. Do you
really want to throw all this away?
Even more importantly, do you
want to deprive others of getting
this type of education even if you
yourself don’t want it? Think over
the reasons why you came to Wash-
ington and Lee in the first place.
Have things really changed very
much since then? Or is it just you?
Are your reasons no longer valid,
or is it that you just didn’t see very
clearly then? Are you sure you are
seeing more clearly now? Is there
something really wrong with the in-
stitution itself? Are the changes you
are advocating going to remedy that
without giving rise to other and
even more nearly insoluble prob-
lems?

Washington and Lee, being a very
special type of school, appeals to a
very special group of prospective
students and parents. Is this bad? Is
there something wrong with offering
a special education to a_ special
group rather than an all-encompass-
ing one to just any—and every-
body? Which do you want? You
can't have both. Is this education of
lesser value than some other? And
will a Washington and Lee which
offers everything to anybody still
appeal to a sufficiently large group
to attract desirable students? Or
even enough of them? It has built-
in factors which distinguish it and
cannot be altered, and some of
them are disadvantages rather than
advantages.

Remember that when Washington
and Lee has what every other uni-
versity has then it competes directly
with every other university, not with
just some of them. In getting the
full viewpoint you also get the full
competition. A heterogenous student
body is just that: heterogeneous.
Can Washington and Lee compete
successfully with schools that have
huge state and municipal subsidies
and are located in bustling metro-
polises with built-in feeder popula-
tions and all the other attractions of
a big city, when the competition is
on their terms not ours?

More than everything else, do
you really want to lose your indivi-
duality? Do you want to be some-
thing special or would you rather
just fade into the mob? When you
do what everybody else does, have
what everybody else has, then you
are what everybody else is. You are
no longer you, you are one of those.

Certainly Washington and Lee
wants change. Change is the only
unchanging thing there is. But what
does it want? All? Anything? Every-
thing? Or those things becoming to
it and perhaps to it alone? Change
just of itself is no virtue, It is not
always even profitable from a crass
ly material standpoint, With every
good comes an evil just as surely as
with every evil comes a good, This
is still as true as when the Platonists
expounded on it. Are you willing to
support the evils that will inevitably
come with your changes? Is the
good to be gained from them suffi-
ciemt to warrant the sacrifice-—es-
pecially since a large part of that
sacrifice will be made not by you
but by those yet to come, even as
the rewards will be reaped mostly
by them. Think carefully whether
your change is worth the price

states.

The Political Science Club and
International Relations Association
sponsors teams which travel to vari-
ous colleges and conferences to
represent member states in simula-
tions of United Nations proceedings.
Team members are needed to repre-
sent the Brazzaville Congo at
George Washington University,
March 5-8, to represent a Security
Council power at Hollins during the
March 20-22 weekend, and to repre-
sent Czechoslovakia in New York in
mid-April. Persons interested in be-
ing representatives should contact
me at 463-6032 or Mare Small at
463-S001.

Educators are of no single opinion
concerning simulation work of this
type. Objections include that model
sessions are inherently lacking in
reality because not all factors can
be known by participants, working
conditions in the UN and OAS head-
quarters and sessions cannot be
simulated on such a small and short
basis, and that participating students
and simulators do not know their
roles well enough.

Advocates of models imperfect,
provide a debate type forum within
which students begin to understand
the basic problems confronting
many of the member nations and
the world, the conflicting ideologies,
personalities, economies, races, and
cultures. Each student finds him-
self knowing one country and its
problems, and through simulation
work, attempts to see how these
problems are resolved with other
nations,

In order to better
Communist thinking, the W&L
PSCIRA teams have _ requested
Communist and quasi-Communist
states such as Czechoslovakia and
Congo-Brazzaville, as compared with
Western powers last year. To under-
stand third world problems, PSCIRA
has represented Pakistan, Nepal and
smaller Latin American countries.

The teams started last year at
Washington and Lee worked with
Randolph-Macon to win national
awards in both U.N. and O.ASS.
conferences for representation of
Guatemala and Mexico, This made
the tally for the two schools the
best in the nation last year. Work
with the Model OAS on campus
and with the Randolph-Macon
Model Security Council provided
both schools with a pool of veteran
simulation students.

The model organization confer-
ences, whether they be Moot Court,
Mock Elections, Mock Conventions,
or International Organizations
represent a low level, non-complex
type of simulation or game.

Possibilities for gaming include
computerized simulated nuclear
wars, neighborhood integration and
stabilization, predicting of election
outcome given certain variables, and
the list is practically infinite. More
sophisticated model gaming can be
developed to a point where players
have no rules and have no idea of
opponent strategies or positions, A
computer programmed game, for
instance, could be used in classes
or small groups involving constantly
shifting positions and rules, with
rules developing after each decision
is made by a player. Some games
have been developed which are so
complex that each player must be
a programmed computer using cy-
bernetics, or a learning function.

Possibilities for future work on
the campus with simulations of all
sizes and complexities exist in all
of the social sciences. In any study
of conflict (cultural, economic, busi-
ness, management, politics, social
or psychological) the simulation pro-
vides a device for studying the dy-
namics and the result of the con-
flict. the effects of various decisions
made by participants, and the effect
of changing variables or the rules of
the game.

However, the game can be con-
sidered only as an imperfect repre-
sentation of the total reality in-
volved, in that variables have to be
isolated, rules have to be drawn,
and many of the influences involved
are left out, either by decision of the
gamers or by faulty knowledge

If a student assumes that a simu
lation is only a representation of a
possible circumstance, and does not
iry to extend the effects of one
simulation into situations which are
only slightly similar or which have
key differences, he will have used

The Generals took out some of
their frustrations by destroying Davis
and Elkins College 107-80. It was
a fitting occasion, being “Norwood
Morrison and Stuart Fauber Night.”
The two seniors from Lynchburg
were honored at a pre-game cere-
mony at mid-court.

The game turned out to be some-
what of a zoo. The contact got
pretty thick as the tempo picked
up. The starting five were replaced
en masse early in the first period.
The reserves got some vital ex-
perience and poured in more and
more points against their poorly
performing opponents.

Mel Cartwright played yet another
fantastic game. Mel controlled the
boards and proved that he could
be just as deadly with jump shots
as with his familiar driving lay-ups.
Cartwright totaled 17 points to be
high man in the balanced scoring
attack of W&L.

Mike Neer added plenty of muscle
under those rough boards. His 13
points were earned the hard way
against a relatively big group of

was the engineer of the Fairleigh-
Dickinson conquest. He was an out-
standing ball handler and superb
shot particularly from the corners.
Plus, Shulman could jpass like a
magician when he was unable to
shoot.

Paired with Shulman was a larger
and stronger guard named Branch.
Branch pumped accurately both
from the floor and the foul line
getting a total of 23 points.

For W&L, Neer was the bright
spot with 23 points and just for
comfort big Mike pulled down 17
rebounds. The quick W&L center
has the highest scoring average for
the season of all the Generals at
17.4,

Fairleigh-Dickinson was tough,
without a doubt, but Washington
and Lee let them direct the action
The visitors were able to play their
game of run and gun _ basketball.
The home five had problems when
it came to getting the ball into the
tough trio under the goal—Cart-
wright, Neer, and Daniel. And from
the outside edges of the court we

just did not hit like their guard
did. Simply stated, W&L did not
play its game and its timing and
balance were consequently thrown
off.

Looking to the future the basket-
ball squad finds no relief. V.C.U.
is the last home opponent of the
season, The game is scheduled for
tonight at 8:00, The Richmond-based
team outscored W&L 90-83 earlier
this season. But the trap is set in
Doremus and Coach Canfield sure
would like to give the home fans
a final victory for this year.

After tonight’s contest the C.A.C.
remains to be fought out. St. Louis
is the site and defending champion
Southwestern at Memphis is the

team to beat. The Southwestern
team returns intact but so do the
Generals. However, the Generals
might want to retaliate from last

year’s championship game.

As mentioned previously, Mike
Neer is leading the team in scor-
ing at 17.4 points. The big blonde
boy is also way ahead of anyone

Swimming team 1s second in state meet

Over the past weekend, the W&L
natators led by Bill Brumback, Bim
Clark and Alan Corwith captured
second place in the Virginia Inter-
collegiate Swimming Championships
out of nine participating teams. The
William and Mary varsity team won
the championship as had been ex-
pected.

“Baltimore Bill” Brumback prov-
ed that he was the fastest swimmer
in the state of Virginia winning the
50 yard freestyle event—W&L’s
only first place finish—with a 22.3
second time in W&M’s 25 yard
pool. Brumback was able to cap-
ture second place in the 100 yard
freestyle event.

After Thursday’s competition
W&L found itself in fifth place
behind W&M, VPI, VMI, ODU,

and Randolph-Macon. Early in Fri-
day’s events W&L moved into sec-
ond place where the Blue swimmers
remained, sustaining several chal-
lenges from VPI and Old Dominion.
[he final score of the major par-
ticpants in the meet was: William

and Lee 288, VPI 269, Old Domi-

Blackford, Bim Clark and Bill
Brumback were able to capture a
second in this event with a 3:53.7

W&L to get
million dollar
srant fund

Washington and Lee University
has been named the recipient of a
charitable remainder trust currently
valued at approximately $1 mil-

lion, President E. R. Huntley an-
nounced,

The estate of stocks and bonds
was left by Mrs. Mary Hudson
Floyd of Pittsburgh, Pa., who died
August 30, 1969.

According to her four-page, hand
written will, the residue of the
estate is to come to Washington
and Lee Univsrsity on the death of
Mrs. Floyd’s daughter, Mrs. Har-
riet L. McCaskey, of Pittsburgh,
Pa., to establish the S. Leslie
Mestrezat Scholarship Fund,

Individual student scholarships
will be awarded up to $2,000 pei
academic year, by the terms of
Mrs. Floyd’s will.

The fund will be in honor of
Mrs. Floyd's uncle, Mr. Justice S$
Leslie Mestrezat, of Greene Coun
try, Pa., an 1871 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee. He served with
distinction as a justice of the Su-
preme Court of Pennsylvania.

“We are grateful for this signi-
ficant help for Washington and Lee
in the important area of student
scholarship aid,” President Huntley
remarked. “This is a fine example
of what is possible through careful
estate planning in the way of much-
needed aid to the cause of higher
education.”

Mrs. Floyd’s will also bequeathed
$10,000 to the Associate Alumnae
of Vassar College, Poughkeepsie,
New York, and stated that she had
already created a scholarship fund
for Waynesburg College, Waynes
burg, Pa.

tellectually promising” students
whose names have been sent by the
foundation to all graduate school
deans in the United States with
a recommendation that they receive
fellowship awards from the gradu-
ate schools.

Woodrow Wilson Designates were
selected from a field of approxi-
matly 12,000 persons nominated for
the honor by more than 800 col-
leges and universities. All indicated

they plan to follow a career in
college teaching.
Dobbs, who is majoring in b

ology, has been an Honor Roll and

chester Rd., Birmingham, Ala.
Dobbs was graduated from Indian
Springs School there.

Henberg, who is majoring in

the game properly. The problem
of learning from a game is that
circumstances are different and that
each situation has its own variables
and rules. Many inexperienced play-
ers fail to realize the pitfall of
making the assumption that a hypo-
thetical situation represents a speci-
fic problem other than the one
played in the game.

Used cautiously and with due re-
gard to simulation limitations, games
can be productive in the learning
process. Used without such care and
circumspection, games can hinder
development of ihe student’s use of
his own evaluations and faculties of
judgment, the very things the games
and simulations attempt to develop.

Faculty Meetings Opened

 

Governor Names Huntley

Robert E. R. Huntley, president
of Washington and Lee University,
was named to the Virginia State
Board of Education Wednesday by
Governor Linwood Holton.

Huntley and Preston Caruthers,
chairman of the Arlington County
School Board, were appointed to
four-year terms on the board. They
will replace Anne Dobie Beebles of
Dinwiddie County, outgoing presi-
dent of the board, and Stuart Wheat-
ley of Danville, both of whom are
ineligible for reappointment accord-
ing to state law.

The seven-member board estab-
lishes policy for Virginia’s public
elementary and high schools.

The board members themselves
will elect a new chairman to re-
place Miss Peebles. It has been
speculated that Waldo G. Miles, a
Bristol attorney and the group's
senior member, will be chosen to
fill the post.

The nominations are the first that
Holton, a Washington and Lee
alumnus, has made to a state board
since taking office Jan. 17. Both
nominations are subject to approval
by the General Assembly.

The appointments of Huntley and
Caruthers will bring youth to the
board. Huntley, 40, will be the
youngest member as well as the only
one from a college or university.

Huntley, originally a Democrat
but later a Republican and a strong
supporter of Holton’s gubernatorial
bid last year, is the fifth college
president to hold a seat on the
board in this century.

After receiving the appointment,
he commented, “I appreciate being
given the opportunity to be of what-
ever service I can in the field of
public education in Virginia, par-
ticularly since so many decisions

that are important to Virginia’s
future are impending in this field.”

Huntley was born in Winston-
Salem, N.C., and educated in that
city’s public schools. He received
both his undergraduate and law de-
grees from Washington and Lee and
he also holds a master of laws
degree from Harvard University,

He practiced law in Alexandria
until he was named assistant pro-
fessor of law at W&L in 1958. He
became dean of the School of Law
in 1967 and president of the uni-
versity in 1968.

Caruthers, 43, is a native of Cov-
ington, Okla., and a graduate of
George Washington University in
Washington, D.C, Like Huntley he
a navy veteran and a supporter of
the governor during the campaign.
Construction Company and Pres-

He is president of both Preston
ton Building Corporation and has
served as a director of the First
Virginia Bank for the past 12 years.

Ju Paintings to Be Shown

Together Again

The Development Office has recently begun to utilize to
a greater extent the student resources available for its pur-
poses. Charged with speaking to the general public in an
effort to attract support for W&L, that office has found
students to be a valuable asset. There are other offices of the
University that could use students with as much success.

The role students can play is not merely a critical one,
although as the Executive Committee’s report on admissions
demonstrates, such a role can be functional and indeed vital.
Rather, students can be best employed as among the Uni-
versity’s emissaries to the groups it wishes to address. Mem-
bers of the EC have been employed recently with favorable
results at alumni meetings, and there are indications that
students will be utilized in other areas, too.

Of course, there are still resources to be tapped, but we
are encouraged at the willingness to use students and by
the fact that they are apparently having the intended effect
of demonstrating, rather than describing, the present nature
of the University to those whose primary focus is elsewhere.

This certainly bears on the University’s relations with
those outside the community to whom it must communicate.
But also significant is its import for the community itself.
To us it indicates a new spirit of willingness to work together,
academically and pragmatically, that seems to be appearing
among students, faculty and administration like. We had al-
most despaired of finding such indications again, but their
reappearance offers us hope that W&L will proceed more
ideally than it ever has in an atmosphere of shared concerns.

A Begmning

This is the last Friday Ring-tum Phi the Publications
Board conceives of printing in the foreseeable future. Be-
ginning Wednesday the Ring-tum Phi will publish a weekly
six-page paper which will be the result of the combined efforts
of the staffs of the two present newspapers.

The publication of two papers a week, managed by
separate staffs, has served the University well but has for
some time been guilty of shortcomings that are virtually
uncorrectable in a four-page paper. Hence, the merger.

We have mixed feelings about the end of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi. The effort to serve an institution in the pres-
ent set-up has been as rewarding as it has been frustrating,
and in many ways we regret the passing of the distinct
identities readers of the two papers could discern.

Yet the academic community needs to be served by a
newspaper that can broaden the scope of its coverage and
at the same time deal with its stories in more depth than
has previously been possible. The weekly edition we hope
will serve that function without being overburdened by the
necessity of repeating itself, a syndrome the two papers had
fallen into.

It will be a great deal more difficult for a combined staff
to publish a six-page paper on Wednesday than it was for
two staffs to publish once a week each. Especially if we are
to offer also the increase in quality we have predicted will
there be more problems. But we are eager to accept the
challenge and will find the reward in meeting our responsi-
bility to the community more fully than we have been able
to do up to now.

A New Service
WLUR’'s scheduling of the Metropolitan Opera perform-

ances, an exclusive service in the area, is among the most
notable undertakings that radio station has embarked upon.
It is also among the most courageous.

WLUR has for some time gone to great length to pro-
vide the students and the community with coverage on pub-
lic events and issues, and it has succeeded admirably. It takes
a particular kind of fortitude, however, to move from a
public service the importance of which everyone agrees on
to one whose public acceptance is at best unpredictable.

It is easy to understand why no commercial station in
the area has chosen to carry the Met's broadcasts. They
cannot count on attracting with them the audiences they
draw for their present programming, and, given financial
pressures, they are reluctant to experiment.

Although the pressures on WLUR are not financial—
Texaco offers the series free—the station is nonetheless
obligated to its public to provide programs of interest and
therefore will probably hear many complaints from patrons
unsympathetic with operatic fare who will assert that no-
body listens to opera nowadays.

But there is, we believe, a significant number of listerners
who will enjoy the broadcasts to justify their being aired.
At any rate, WLUR is fulfilling a function—that of ex-
perimentation—for which a college station is much better
equipped than a commercial one. And in this instance, it
is also fulfilling another major role—that of complementing
commercial productions with cultural programs regular bud-
pets cannot prov ide for.

Coeducation: Ivy League and W&L

By MONTY COTTIER

In his article in last Tuesday's
Phi, Dr. Sharff posed several ques-
tions concerning the changes which
have either been proposed, may be
proposed, or are “in the winds,”
such as coeducation and the aboli-
tion of the “in loco parentis” idea
of a university’s role. The problem
with such an approach, however,
often is that the student is faced
with nothing but a list of such ques-
tions, with nothing on which to base
a reply.

Taking the problem of coeduca-
tion, for example, a more useful
approach might be found in ex-
amining situations in which it had
already been tried and seeing what
the results were. In the Ivy League
schools such as Yale and Princeton,
both of which opened their doors
to women students this fall, the re-
actions ranged from “playing footsie
under the study desks” to treating
the girls with what one co-ed term-
ed “the buddy system” (The Wash-
ington Post, February 25).

As Dr. Sharff pointed out, the
atmosphere of the classes will un-
doubtably be changed, both in the
lectures of the professors and in
the students’ responses to them. A
Princeton student expressed the
problem by saying, “There's a girl

in my philosophy class, and she’s
amazingly conspicuous. Everyone's
waiting for her to say something.”

With this trend might go, too,
the idea that in a group of girls
as small as that of the co-eds would
probably be, whatever one might
say to a class of men would run
the risk of coming out sounding like
a policy statement on behalf of all
womankind, On the other hand, the
fact keeps returning to mind that
we have gone so long without the
classroom expression of any opinion
other than that of fellow males that
any change would be welcome.

It would certainly be a major
problem to assimilate co-eds into
the W&L scholastic environment;
although if the recent Co-ed Week
is any indication, the girls might
well be quite capable of handling
that problem themselves. The cruc-
ial test could well be, as many
said it was in Princeton’s and Yale’s
case, in the transition from scho-
lastics to social considerations, or
vice versa. After all, most of the
girls will probably be from the
nearby girls’ schools, and will know
someone or several people here al-
ready. That this might initially be

a source of difficulty is possible, but
that it might also provide a means
of bridging the gap for males and
females alike should also be con-
sidered,

Too, the opportunities for dating
are much better if girls are a part
of the general scene and may be
met on a more relaxed level than
is usually found in the average blind
date or random selection from a
facebook. Of course, they are not
your dates exclusively. They are
everyone’s dates, which makes them
anyone’s On an open competition

On Stop, Environmental Group

By DAVID OLSON

Two groups have recently been
formed on campus which are both
concerned with important and
topical issues. STOP and the En-
vironmental Concern group have
recently organized, and different
from past groups of this nature,
these seem to be well on their way
to succeeding. They have, unlike past
attempts, organized and set up some
specific goals.

On A Cockpit Dilemma

Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

On a recent Friday night | went
to the University Center for a few
beers and was most disturbed by
what I saw there. | am referring
to the presence of. so many towns-
people. Nearly half the crowd in the
Cockpit and a majority of the group
in the game room were composed
of these people.

This is upsetting for two reasons.
The first is that the “Cockpit” is in
the University Center, which was
built for the entertainment and plea-
sure of the University community—
faculty, students, administrators,

and their guests. If the “Cockpit”
is continually frequented by “town-
ies” I believe that it will lose its
appeal for students. It wil lbecome
little more than an elegant version
of the “Corner Grill” (Doc’s).

It is the one place in town that
we as students can call our own—
let's keep it that way! It seems to
me that this should be a_ private
club-type arrangement; membership
to which is contingent upon associa-
tion with the University community.

The second point is strictly fi-
nancial in nature. It is my under-
standing that there is a danger that
the “Cockpit” would be more sub-
ject to local taxation if it were

An Apology To

By LAWRENCE MeCONNELL

Upon reading Mr. Robert Steck’s
reply to my two week old article,
I began wondering whether or not
I was right in attacking Mr. Ram-
sey Clark’s speech. And after over-
hearing a disquieting story concern-
cerning the little known kingdom
of Pretzelvania, my doubts began to
concretize into an ignominious fe-
cognition of my error.

1 feel compelled to share this
story with the reader in the hope
that he too will recognize the grave
error in my thought which I assure
the world will not ever be publicly
displayed again, unless of course
there is a great demand for those
writers whose works are carrion for
error-seeking vultures.

Before | began to relate this
tale, | must express my indebied-
ness to Mr. Steck, without whose
letter this reply would not have
been possible. In his note, he elo-
quently instructed our mutual read-
ers, as well as myself, about the
central, over-weaning error in my
analysis: to wit. that I did not con-
tend (perchance agree) with the
focus of Mr. Clark's talk which was
based on the popular premise: ma
terial deprivation breeds disrespect
for the law, As everyone will agree,
this premise is the corollary to a
more general one that one’s native

habitat determines one’s essential
character.
Here, | would suggest (for the

benefit of all those rather garrulous
yet busy bodies of erudite men) a
better pharse which will be much
more striking and memorable in a
heated argument: “You are where
you live.” Not only is this phrase
catchy, but it also appeals to the
emotional and intellectual thirst of
the average man to know exactly
who and what he is, For, as a lost
traveler on a long journey who
stops hastily fer directions, he does
not have time to listen to the
lengthy reminiscences of a local
resident: he must be on his way
quickly. This phrase therefore pro
vides men of all backerounds with
a simple litmus paper test by which

he may judge where he stands in
relation to the world. If he lives in
a ghetio, his nature is ghetto-like:

his mind is full of trashy thoughts
like the garbage in his gutter. If he
is a resident in a middle class neigh
borhood, his essence is middle class

his mind as narrow as the wheel
base on his compact car. And if
he lives in an opulent section of
the city, he
cormicopia of

must have a veritable

knowledge to equal

the amount of money he has,

But to return to the purpose, my
main intent in writing this article
was to confess to Mr. Steck that I
indeed was at fault in my essay of
several weeks ago. The main evi-
dence for this embarrassing admis-
sion can be found in the tragic tale
of Pretzelvania, which if the reader
will have patience, | will relate in
the following paragraphs.

Nestled in the Carpathian moun-
tains, Pretzelvania is a  couniry
noted for its cultural progress as
well as its economic stability. Its
leader, Prince Ali Kazaam, was for-
tunately far-sighted, but regreti-
ably short on patience. The Prince's
Minisier of Public Well-Being had
delivered a report to his highness
concerning the unruly people who
lived in the unbeneficial areas of
Prtezelvania.

Attentive to his constituency, the
wise Prince decided he had better
do something progressive and vis-
ionary or else run the risk of dis-
order spreading throughout the
kingdom. After highdevel confer-
ences with his Ministers of Cultural
Enrichment and Economic Security,
he concluded that with the distribu-
tion of an ample supply of money
and books in the unbeneficial sec-
tions of Pretzelvania, the turmoil
would cease. He justified this action
from his reading of three docu-
ments his library: one by Machia-
velli, another which was entitled the
Constitution of the United States,
and the third which was a book by
a noted American sociologist, He
reasoned thusly: (a) he as prince
was the supreme administrator of
justice, (B) all the people in his
land were to be equal before him,
and (c) the law he administered
produced different results in vary
ing social conditions. Thus, if Preiz-
elvania had one social condition, the
resulis of his administration or jus-
tice would be the same for all
cases,

To accomplish this, his ministers
told him, it would be necessary to
go to the people who had libraries
anf money in the nation to give
their books and shingles (a flat,
retangular object composed of slate
used as the basic monetary unit of
the country, its advantage being
that it could be broken into smaller
monetary units by a simple smack
on a tabletop)

Prince Kazaam issued a decree
that this be done and personally
heard of little resentment from the
owners of books umd shingles ubout
ihe transference of part of their

organized in January and has been
concerned first with the Vietnam
war, the draft and ROTC. The
group has committees for research,
public relations and programs and
has started some interesting things.
The Research Committee has al-
ready drawn up a draft booklet call-
ed “The Draft Digest” which should
appear sometime today. They also
plan to hear from Captain Owen of
the ROTC department sometime in
the next week. The draft booklet
is especially important in that it
pertains to the new lottery system
and there certainly is a lack of
material on the new system. Hope-
fully this new booklet will clear up
many of the uncertainties that have
haunted all of us since the lottery
was adopted. They have also been
compiling information on Vietnami-
zation and related issues. To this
writer they appear to be a con-
cerned and dedicated group. They
are well organized and have a num-
ber of panel discussions coming up
next month. We should be hearing
a lot from STOP in the future.

The Environmental Concern
group also appears to be on the
way to a certain degree of success.
While STOP is basically concerned
with the college community, the
Envioronmental Concern group is
directing its attention to the Lex-
ington Community,

As Ron Sklar, temporary co-
chairman of the group, told me, Lex-

ington has no great pollution prob-
lem but there are subtle things that
the community should be concern-
ed about. One of their primary ob-
jectives is getting a symposium,
hopefully in Lee Chapel, to discuss
the question of Marble Valley.
Marble Valley is beyond Goshen
and is one of the scenic spots in
this area. It also has a number of
old (circa 1700) houses that should
be preserved. However, Vepco plans
to dam up the Maury River at this
point to produce a hydro-electric
power plant. Not only would this
destroy the houses in Marble Val-
ley but it would make the Maury
River around Goshen all but a
trickle, which would destroy a fa-
vorite W&L pastime—tubing. The
Environmental Concern group has
not taken a stand on the issue but
it feels that the proposition should
be discussed in front of the com-
munity. Whether the need for
electrical power is so great that such
a scenic area would have to be
marred is open to question and it
is this question that will be dealt
with at the Symposium on March
II.

These two groups are good for the
campus community and maybe they
will finally stir the W&L student
out of his historic apathy. Never-
theless they have formed and they
are taking actions and getting in-
volved, something that has been
lacking in the past.

Steck-And Swift

possessions. Within weeks, almost
everyone had an equal number of
books and shingles; the Minister of
Public Well-Being assured the
Prince all was indeed well. But the
Ministers of Cultural Enrichment
and Economic Security had other
news. Thing were not just a bowl
of oatmeal (a rare delicacy in Pretz-
elvania).

As is often the case, those from
the unbeneficial areas of Pretzel-
vania (which were now classified as
living in beneficial areas by the
Minister of Well-Being) were still
living tumultuous lives. They were
burning their books in their fire-
places to save shingles on firewood,
while they delighted so much in
cracking their shingles to pieces
that they lost all the money they
had been given. On top of all this
trouble, those who had given away
some of their books and shingles
had theatened to storm the palace
!o overthrow the prince if he didn't
do something about protecting them
from the rioting masses in the newly
designated beneficial sections.

The Prince lost his patience. The
Minster of Well-Being was frantic-
ally pleading with his highness to
give the idea another chance—all
that was needed was a little more
time to beneficialize the populace
But the Prince was short-tempered
and ordered all the rioters shot.
Unfortunately, this meant disaster
for the country because the more
people they shot, the more rioters

people they shot, the more rioters
the whole population of the country
was reduced to two—the Prince and
his Minister of Well-Being (the Min-
ister of Cultural Enrichment was
killed in a library fire and the
Minister of Economic Security met
an untimely end when he was fatally
hit in the head with the shrapnel
from a thrown shingle).

Mr. Steck was right; | was wrong.
For any writer who is steadfast in
his beliefs and principles, such an
admission is doubly painful. In view
of my error, | have now taken
Steps to remedy my afflicted con-
science in hope that my readers
and eventually Mr. Steck himself
will follow my belated example.

First, for those who are unduly
penurious, I direct them to the
example of the Prince. Had he given
away his books and shingles, he
would have still had a populated
country in which to dwell because
there would have been no prince
to overthrow and hence no need
for violence. He too would have
lived as others in a new kingdom
in which equal people govern them-
selves equally.

I humbly ask of Mr. Steck and
my readers two favors which no
sensible gentleman could deny: (1)
that they join me in a new life
of selling pencils on the streets of
this fair city, and (2) that they
remember the ultimate precept of
charity: “to err is human; to for-
give, divine.”

and prepared for this weekends’
College Athletic Conference tourna-
ment. In a stormy match with
the Rams, who had previously won
a 90-83 decision earlier this year,
the Generals sprinted to an early
lead and coasted to victory behind

Mike Neer, Mel Cartwright, Stu
Fauber, and Norwood Morrison.
The quartet, all seniors, played

their last game in Doremus Gym,
compiling in their four years at
Washington and Lee a 73-24 won-

loss record,

The Generals, along with hosting
Washington University and the de-
fending champions, Southwestern
of Memphis, are one of three teams
favored to win the tournament which
began last night in St. Louis.

Washington and Lee and South-
western both possess 15-8 records,
but the Generals won the coin toss
and the top seeding. As a result,
the Generals will face the winner

of the Centre College-Sewanee en-
counter tonight in the semifinals.

Institute Discussion Group
To Discuss Nat Turner Novel

One of a series of panel discus-
sions sponsored by the Summer
Reading Program at Virginia Insti-
tute will be held Tuesday.

The discussion will deal with “Nat
Turner: The Negro Revolt.” A ques-
tion and answer period will follow.

The program will begin at 7:30
p.m. in VMI’s Lejeune Hall. It is
open to the public.

Two primary sources will com-
prise the background for the sym-
posium. The first is William Styron’s
best-selling historical novel, “The

Confession of Nat Turner,” and the
second is “William Styron’s Nat
Turner: Ten Black Writers Re-
spond,” a critical reaction to the
book.

Swim Team

Both Bill Brumback and John
Lawlor will be keys to the Gen-
erals’ hopes for a victory. Brumback
holds the CAC records in the 50
and 100 yard freestyle which he
won in last year’s competition. Like-
wise Lawlor holds the record in
the 500 and 1650 yard freestyle
events which he won last year.

Other keys to General success are
Bim Clark and freshman, Alan
Corwith. Clark presently holds the
CAC records in the 100 and 200
yard butterfly events which he set
during the season. Corwith has con-
tinually broken the CAC record in
the 200 yard freestyle. Coach Stearns
hopes that these two swimmers will
win more than their share of the
events. Coach Stearns also noted
that the W&L team has exceptional
depth and that in a meet of this
nature every sixth place point will
count,

By ROBERT LARUE

Washington and Lee’s Generals brought home their third
College Athletic Conference basketball championship in the
last four years by defeating Centre College 93-66, and Wash-
ington University, 82-69, in St. Louis last weekend.

Stu Fauber was nothing short of tremendous against the
Prayin’s Colonels, who had reached the semi-finals by defeat-

ing Sewanee in a first-round game.
The Lynchburg senior scored 21
points, his season high, while
grabbing 11 rebounds and tallying
5 assists.

Aiding in the conquest was the
“Bandit Squad” of Paul McClure,
Dave Stone, and John Glace, who
teamed with Fauber and Mike
Daniel when Mike Neer and Mel
Cartwright were forced to the side-
lines with foul trouble. Neer foul-
ed out after scoring 10 points and
Cartwright rode the bench after
collecting four fouls and 16 points.

The squad’s wish, expressed by
Coach Verne Canfield, to avenge last
season’s loss at the hands of South-
western was not to be realized. Wash-
ington University, the home team,
defeated the Lynx and won. the
right to face W&L in the final.

The General's 82-69 championship
victory was one of the year’s finest
all-around team performances. W&L
dominated play from the start and
had a 38-18 lead over the cold-
shooting, out-rebounded Bears.

Wrestlers End
Dismal Season
On Happy Note

WA&L’s wrestling team capped off
a disappointing 1-10 season with a
respectable showing in the CAC
tournament that contributed to the
school’s impressive appearance there.
Coach Dick Miller's squad placed
third of the five teams participating.

Individually, they did even better.
Dee Copenhaver came in first in
the 190 Ib. weight class, Razz Ras-
berry and Wade Gowl finished sec-
ond in the 134 and 127 Ib. classes
respectively, and Bill West was third
in the 145 Ib. division.

Bruce Hankins (5-3) and Captain
Dave Higgins (5-5) had the team’s
top records for the season. Hankins
and Copenhaver have been named
captains for next year.

Higgins, in commenting on pros-
pects for next year, noted that the
new team would face the same dif-
ficulties this year’s squad suffered.
Higgins cited lack of depth and ex-
perience as the critical problems
future teams will have to overcome.

Washington, running a full-court
man to man press and sparked by
the shooting of Bruce Holloway and
Paul Dodge, narrowed the lead
throughout the second half, closing
at One point to 66-60. A final W&L
spurt, coupled with some Washing-
ton turnovers, upped the margin to
the final thirteen points.

Cartwright and Neer controlled
the boards, while Mike Daniel play-
ed outstanding defensive ball and
added some fast-break baskets.
“Magic Mel” canned 22 points and
grabbed 17 rebounds, while hitting
on 10 of his 11 free throws, Neer
put in 17 points and collected 20
rebounds,

The finalists provided four of the
five all-tournament players. Cart-
wright, who was voted the competi-
tion’s Most Valuable Player, and
Neer joined Washington’s Holloway
and Dodge, and Buddy Baker of
fourth place Centre to form the
CAC “dream team.”

The CAC tournament triumph
capped off an 18-7 year for the
Generals. It also marked the finale
for the squad’s quartet of seniors—
Cartwright, Neer, Fauber, and Cap-
tain Norwood Morrison. The four
finished their college careers with
a record of 76-23, one of the best
showings in the University’s history.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

By TOM GAGE

Over at the Homestead in Hot
Springs, among the many pasttimes
that one can pursue is skiing. It is
kind of a minislope they’ve got over
there, especially if you're used to
something else, but it’s quite a lot
of fun all the same. I decided to
go up there last Saturday with a
group of friends and proceeded to
make the necessary arrangements.
Skis had to be rented . . . boots,
poles and all that. So a phone call
was made Friday afternoon by yours
truly to reserve the stuff for the
next day.

“Good
stead.”

“Hello, connect me with the ski
area, please.” . . . (pause-dial-pause)
then a huge “ALLO”... . . (Gulp).

“I'd like to rent some equipment
for tomorrow.”

“Ve vill have lots of boots und
skis.” . . . CLICK. That was that.
My thank you fell on deaf ears.

The next day produced an un-
forgetable experience. The rope tow
there is one of the slowest and
safest ever seen, yet it still took
its unfortunate toll. Some poor
wretch had let go of the rope and
started sliding backwards down the
hill. There were screams of “Grab
her” and “Look out below” but
nothing seemed to work as she

afternoon, the Home-

slowly careened into two kids and
a middle-aged man. This snowball-
ing mass finally stopped halfway
down the hill and just toppled over.
Nobody was

hurt, but what a

weird scene!

So I went over to the intermediate
hill while the untangling process was
in effect, but matters did not im-
prove. I had just started my
awkward descent when one lone ski
went whistling past me. Twenty feet
behind lay a crumpled figure that
was emitting the strangest combina-
tion of laughs and grunts. The ski
patrol was already on the way so
I decided to wait at the bottom of
the hill to see if the guy was really
hurt. Well you could tell that the
patrol was making sort of a make-
shift splint for the guy, so the in-
jury had to be rather serious.
Finally they loaded him onto the
stretcher and started to bring him
down the hill. Of course the crowd
was silent, very solemn. Then sud-
denly, “the draft. | won't have to
go in the draft!” The afflicted him-
self was breaking the silence was
enraptured screams while at the
same time flashing the peace sign at

the amazed onlookers . . . which
included me.
“Grab your camera, Doris,”

some girl said to her friend who
was standing next to me. “We can’t
miss this!” At last glance these two
girls were dancing around the fallen
skier, taking his picture which seem-
ed to please the poor idiot no end.

Well I took the guy's advice about
peace, retired to the confiines of
the lodge and poured myself a glass
of Germany's finest. And, you know,
there was not anything weird about
it at all! A first for the day.

Awards To Be Given

The Washington and Lee English
Department will sponsor a series
of Mahan Awards in Creative Writ-
ing again this year.

Awards will be offered in both
prose and verse. Two awards will
be offered in freshman prose, and
one prose award will be presented
to a sophomore and one to a junior.

Prose entries should be intenpre-
tive or imaginative; short stories,
critical studies, one-act or longer
plays or informal essays. A mini-
mum of 1500 words is required and
an adequate bibliography and foot-
notes should accompany criticism.

One verse award will be present-
ed. This competition is open to men
from any class except seniors. A
minimum of 30 lines is required.

Entries must be typewritten and
submitted to the secretary of the
English Department in Payne 32 A
by noon April 13.

Minority

Each entry should be provided
with a title page including the title
of the paper, a pen name chosen
by the writer, the writer's class, and
a pledge signed with the writer's
pen name. A sealed envelope, con-
taining the writer's pen name on
the outside and his real name on
the inside must also be submitted.

A three-man committee from the
English Department will judge the
competition and announce its de-
cision in early May. No awards will
be made in any class unless the
entries meet the competition's stand-
ards. No student may win both a
prose and a verse award in the
same year.

The Mahan awards consist of a
$100 exemption from college fees
during the year following the one in
which the award is made or, if the
recipient chooses, $60 in cash.

Student Recruitment

Sought by EC Subcommittee

lars at 4 per cent per annum. There-
in lies a problem. However, outside

sources of aid are suggested as
alternatives.
The final matter to which the

report turns its attention is assimila-
tion. The committee proposes that
both a summer program and an
extra transitional year be devised to
aid in assimilation. “Such a pro-
gram would be a necessary corollary
to a policy of conditional acceptance
(i.e., where CBEB scores are over-
looked). The focus of this program
would be on basic skills, This pro-
gram would be intended for those

Parietal Regulations

allowed to stay are now almost
non-existant. The new regulations
institute an optional system in which
if a girls chooses, she may leave
record of her destination and the
place where she will stay in a
sealed envelope in the student activi-
ties office. Such a system insures
that parents or urgent callers would
be able to contact her while guaran-
teeing her right to privacy.

Proposals for a revision of parietal
restrictions are now in committee,
but have yet to reach the Senate
floor. Liquor in the dorms has yet
to become a salient topic, accord-
ing to Hollins Dean of Students
Bayliss Wiley.

The new curfew regulations are
similar to those now in effect at
Randolph-Macon Women's College
and Sweet Briar College. Randolph.
Macon hasn't had curfew regulations
since September, while a similar plan
went into effect at Sweet Briar in
October. At present Hollins is the
only neighboring women's college

students who are somehow deficient
in admissions criteria.” Unfortun-
ately the report does not detail why
such students would be abnormally
deficient if they would not lower
WAL’s admissions standards to be-
gin with. Presumably, the CEEB
scores would be low only because
of the cultural backgrounds of the
underprivileged. If high school
grades are to remain a primary fac-
tor in admissions for the under-
privileged, it is difficult to see why
deficient students would be accepted
unless the University lowered its
standards.

The proposed summer session
would emphasize English and math
and would be taught by two faculty
members from each of those de-
partments. Despite the committee's
detail in outlining such a summer
program, no mention is made as to
how it would be financed.

The transitional year would be
one in which underprivileged stu-
dents could experiment with college
courses. It would be aimed at im-
proving their preparation for col-
lege. “The students (would) attend
regular classes and receive course
credit if a passing grade (were) at-
tained, Failure in a course (would)
result in the non-registration of
credit rather than a failing grade
which (would) endanger his stand-
ing. After the first year transitional
students (would) be subject to the
normal course requirements.” In
order to enable transitional students
to graduate with their class (they
would probably not have full course
loads their first year, and would
rarely be allowed overloads) the de-
gree requirements for them would
be lowered from 123 to 117 credits

Problems of Fraternity Contact

(Continued from Page 1)
allow the physical presence of any
fraternity-affiliated upperclassmen in
the dormitories, except dormitory
counselors, (it does allow dorm
couselors to rush as much as they
desire in the dorms) and it pro-
hibits a fraternity man from talking
to a freshman in McCormick Li-
brary—but not a freshman from
talking to a fraternity man. These
two sanctuaries were seemingly pro-
vided as a refuge for the freshman
from the onslaught of upperclass-
men,

It is the fraternities that will be
forced to bear most of the burdens
of this plan. A fraternity house is
open to freshmen 24 hours a day.
There is no sanctuary for the fra-
ternity man. The fraternities,
as a whole, will be forced by
competitive pressures to equal or
counteract the maneuvers of the
most aggressive, high-spending fra-
ternity; there is no prohibition
against free liquor except on Fri-
day evenings; there is the potential
for combo-escalation as each fra-
ternity seeks to attract the best
freshmen to its parties; there are
no restrictions on a freshman eating
dinner at any house. Each fraternity
will probably seek to maintain
daily, positive contact with the fresh-
men that they are rushing or risk
losing them.

The IFC must again attempt to
create a balanced deferred rush pro-
gram that combines the seemingly
incompatible objectives of (1) pro-
tecting the fraternity system, (2)
maximizing the communication be-
tween the freshmen and the fra-
ternities and (3) not interfering
with the academic interests of the
community,

Firm to Study
Parking Issue

A landscape and architectural firm
from Pittsburgh, Pa., has been re-
tained by Washington and Lee Uni-
versity to study the school’s parking
problem.

Assistant to the President Frank
A. Parsons announced Monday that
the firm of Griswold, Winters, and
Swain has been employed as con-
sultants for the planning of ex-
panded parking facilities on campus.

The conypany has been requested
to provide recommendations for the
relief of student parking problems
by next September, plans for “stor-
age” parking for 1970-71 freshmen
cars, and proposals for parking
facilities behind the addition to
Doremus Gymnasium.

Government Can Deflate Left

(Continued from Page 3)

mission also recommended that the
voting age be lowered to 18.

If adopted, the commission recom-
mendations would not totally end
student revolt — nothing would
please the SDS— but they would
go a long way toward easing stu-
dent unrest.

The end of the draft would eli-
minate the uncertainty which now
fogs the students’ future. The most
significant aspect of the recom-
mendation is that the draft would
end next year, and not when we
get out of Vietnam, if we ever get
out. And the lowering of the vot-
ing age to 18 would give college
age students a voice in determining
national policy. Most 18-year olds,
although they can be drafted, feel
that they have no voice in their
own destiny.

The elimination of the draft would
also eliminate from campuses many
of the malcontents who stir up dis-
order. Some students have no in-
terest in a college education, but
enroll to get the four year de-
frement. Once in college, they be-
come professional agitators, rather
than seeking a degree.

President Nixon endorses both
commission recommendations as a
means of winning the confidence of
young Americans. Governor Holton
goes even further in recommending
that students share in the administra-

tion of colleges. Last week, the
Governor appointed a law student
to the University of Virginia Board
of Visitors. Unfortunately, Secretary
of Defense Melvin Laird has thrown

some cold water on the commis-
sion recommendations by saying
that 1971 would be too early to

establish an all-volunteer army.

It might be true, as San Fran-
cisco State President S. 1. Hayakawa
stated, that only one per cent of
the nation’s college students are
involved in campus violence. But
a much larger segment shares the
feeling of anxiety. Congress should
make law the commission recom-
mendations in order to maintain
education as the main product of
America’s colleges.

Student Role Increased
On Faculty Committees

The Washington and Lee faculty
undertook reform of the Student
Affairs Committee and gave a vote
to the student member of the fac-
ulty Executive Committee in what
Dean of the College William W.
Pusey termed a “full” meeting
Monday night.

The SAC reform was one of sev-
eral motions proposed by the com-
mittee itself and passed by the
faculty. The current voting mem-
bership of seven faculty members
and four students will be changed
in September to five members of
each group, in accordance with a
recommendation by the — student
Executive Committee.

A representative of independent
students—the president of the Inde-
pendent Union if possible—will be
added, and an associate dean will

 

be dropped as a voting member.

A representative of the University
Center Committee will be made
an ex-officio member of the SAC
in order to increase communications
with the center, according to Lewis
G. John, dean of Students.

No ex-officio members
permitted to voie.

Acting on another SAC proposal,
the faculty abolished grade require
ments for fraternity initiation and
left new stipulations to the discre-
tion of the individual fraternities.
Faculty regulations concerning house
parties were abolished and control
given to the Interfraternity Council,
which is expected to consult Lex-
ington residents before taking any
action,

Rules concerning eligibility for
student offices were also changed.

The Washington and Lee Chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa has elected 28
new members. The list contains 18
seniors, five juniors, one law  stu-
dent, three members of the class of
1969, and one honorary member,
whose name will be announced later
in the year.

The seniors are from 16 different
states. They are as follows:

David McLeod Bethea, an Eng-
lish major from Newport News,
Va.;

Roger Franklin Cook, a philoso-
phy major from Pine Bluff, Ark.:

David Harris Dake, an Honors
candidate in sociology with a major
in history as well, from Monroe,

The faculty made a 2.0 cumulative
grade-point ratio the only academic
requirement.

The faculty gave Dave Bethea,
the student member of the faculty
EC, a vote on all matters except
those in which the committee acts
for the faculty between faculty
meetings. This had been recom-
mended by the faculty EC after the
student EC made a similar recom-
mendation earlier in the year,

The faculty also passed a pro-
posal by the faculty EC offering a
major in religion beginning in
September and another abolishing
the two-week prohibition on away
athletic events before exams.

Dr. Edgar Spencer, professor of
geology, was elected to a _ three-
year term on the President’s Faculty
Advisory Committee. He succeeds
Dr. William Buchanan, professor of
politics, whose term has expired.

A resolution was adopted noting
the faculty's “sense of profound sor-
row and loss in the death” of Pro-
fessor William Chaffin and recogniz-
ing his numerous accomplishments
at Washington and Lee.

Discussion on two controversial
matters — university regulations on
absences and eligibility requirements
for extra curricular activities—were
delayed until next week due to lack
of time.

University President Robert E. R.
Huntley called a special meeting
of the faculty for Monday, March
16, at 4:30 p.m. to discuss these
topics.

An amendment proposed at Mon-
day’s meeting from the floor calling
for the elimination of all absence
regulations is expected to be the first
order of business at that meeting.

A faculty EC meeting is also
scheduled for next week.

EC Fills Vacated Post;
Reviews Admissions Plan

By Steve Ory

The Executive Committee elected
Drew Kumpuris to fill the junior
executive committeeman post vacat-
ed by the death of Kevin Baker.
Kumpuris, a junior from Little
Rock, Ark., was elected from a field
of eight applicants and was sworn in

immediately prior to the regular
business meeting.
A discussion of the Admissions

Report was prefaced by Glenn Azu-
ma, who stated that the study called
for a shift in emphasis from SA!
scores to high school performance
as admissions criteria. Azuma felt
that this did not call for a lowering
of admissions standards for the Uni-
versity.

Objections to the report came
from Dean Kumpuris, Chuck Dob-
bins, and John Markham, who ques-
tioned the reduction in graduation
requirements for underprivileged stu-
dents,

Markham commented thai a fe
duction in graduation requirements
would prevent underprivileged stu
dents from being judged as equal
with regular students

Dave Bethea and Glenn Azuma

 

Ihe Pips appearing March 21 in Dorenws C5 aenasion,

defended this section of the report
by noting that it would be necessary
for the deprived students to assi-
milate successfully into the Univer-
sity. This could not be readily ac-
complished, according to Bethea
and Azuma, with the normal course
load.

John Richard addressed the EC,
calling for a definition of what ex-
actly the EC meant by underpri-
vileged students. Richard also noted
a contradiction between the attempt
to prevent a reduction in standards

bution requirements for special stu
dents

Joe Tompkins proposed that the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, March 11, 1970

Noblesse Oblige

If the Executive Committee next week
approves as it now reads the Committee Re-
port on the Recruitment of Underprivileged
Students, they would be making a decision
which could be fatal to Washington and Lee
and psychologically destructive to the under-
privileged students involved.

The sub-committee which authored the
report vigorously denies that any lowering
of admissions standards would be entailed.
They claim rather that the impersonal ob-
jective admissions criteria now used attend to
only middle class standards and hence are
unfair when applied to underprivileged
classes. They recommend substituting new
admissions criteria—such as personal inter-
views and class rank—which would examine
individual potential on a more subjective
basis.

However, the report in its later pages
openly contradicts their assertion that admis-
sions standards would not be lowered. The
report outlines a special summer program
and a special transitional year policy for
these students. Included in the transitional
year are provisions which we can only de-
scribe as academically absurd. For example,
“the students will attend regular classes
and receive credit if a passing grade is at-
tained. Failure in a course will result in the
non-registration of credit rather than a fail-
ing grade which will endanger his standing.”
Or, “The hours (for graduation) require-
ment could be altered from 123 to 117
for transitional year students.”

The glaring dichotomy in this report that
strikes us is: if admissions standards are not
being lowered but the emphasis is merely
being shifted, as Mr. Glenn Azuma phrased
it, “to place the value of SAT scores in their
proper perspective and to move to more
valuable forms of testing,” then why have an
insulting transitional year program and why
have relaxed graduation requirements if
these underprivileged students being sought
are presumably capable of maintaining pres-
ent expectations of Washington and Lee stu-
dents? Evidently, Mr. Bethea and Mr. Azu-
ma lack the faith and confidence in their new
admissions policy they grandiloquently as-
sert exists.

Besides the danger to admissions stand-
ards of switching to a policy that ignores the
necessity of familiarity with certain academic
tools which enable competition with “W&L
students” by “W&L students’’, consider the
psychological danger to students from lower
socio-economic brackets by this noblesse ob-
lige attitude.

The “we are going to treat you different
because you are different” attitude of the re-
port can only make these men feel more
miserable. And we sincerely believe they will
be miserable from the beginning anyway be-
cause of their social and economic situations.
Washington and Lee is an expensive school.
It is expensive on and off the campus. To
bring here a small number of underprivil-
eged students—who had to be recruited—is
as cruel to them as placing a guinea pig in an
observation tank for 1400 pairs of eyes to
stare at, and no one likes to be stared at.
Washington and Lee is a school for snobs,
but it’s a good school academically nonethe-
less because we realize this and we cater to
this in all areas.

But the noblesse oblige attitude of ac-
tively recruiting underprivileged students to
come here is selfish, the most odious expres-
sion of snobbery. The report admits this on
page one. However, the report does have a
second motivation, far more noble. This is
the ideal of offering a good quality educa-
tion to students who might not otherwise have
the opportunity. There is to be sure nothing
selfish in that. However, it is neither the ob-
ligation nor the responsibility of a private
institution to undertake this noble burden.

First of all, we simply and pragmatically
cannot afford it. Second, as we hinted above,
it is not fair socially to the students involved,
or academically to those same students, to
our faculty, and to our other students.
Third, public institutions more diversified
and less expensive exist for the express pur-
pose of offering anyone in their tax base a
good education. It would indeed be wonder-
ful if we could aim ourselves in this new di-
rection, but we truly feel it would be more
prudent and fair to all concerned to concen-
trate on our admissions problem from an-

other angle. R.HLY.

A Real Deferred Rush

The difficulty in both of the so-called
deferred rush proposals now before the In-
terfraternity Council is that neither of them
lives up to its name. What they are, in fact,
are deferred pledging programs which ad-
here only to the letter and not the spirit of
the faculty directive to reform the system.

The chief difference between the two lies
in the restrictions placed on contact. The ori-
ginal plan, submitted by Chuck Cahn, Danny
Leonard and Jim Mathews, places minimal
strictures on rush tactics during the six-week
prepledging period. The argument is that,
while there might initially be an “escalation
of irresponsibility” in competing for the
freshmen’s time, the work load would soon
restore an atmosphere of “naturalness’” in
which the freshmen and the fraternities
could then make a rational decision. Leo-
nard suggested that to provide such a rea-
soned choice would deprive fraternities only
of the “dead wood” who contribute little to
fraternity life anyway.

The alternate proposal, presented Mon-
day by Lawrence McConnell, takes a more
skeptical view of the possibility of a maturity
that rush history has failed to produce, and
it therefore places more stringent restric-
tions on contact between fraternity men and
freshmen. Such a plan would, it apears, in-
sure more equality among fraternities and al-
low more time for academic concerns to pene-
trate the mental cloud cover rushing would
have built up. It also deals more reasonably
with the financial exigencies involved. That
is, removing dead wood inevitably results in
financial losses which would prove fatal to
several houses, while it is likely that more
freshmen would pledge under McConnell’s
plan,

The problem is that neither plan pro-
vides for the possibility that an intellectual
atmosphere will develop before everyone is
absorbed in a sox ially oriented decision struc:

ture which is at best peripheral to the univer-
sity’s major concerns. The second plan, it is
true, is closer to the ideal, but it is still seri-
ously remiss in meeting the responsibility
fraternities must have to recognize and serve
the primary goals of the institution. We need
hardly mention the intellectually deleterious
effects cloistering freshmen will create.

Alternatively, the first plan relies on as-
sumptions which lead to undesirable possibili-
ties. Proponents say first that maturity, not
irresponsibility, will escalate, but if that does
not happen, and we cannot understand the
optimism that it will (particularly when it
may appear that the alternative to irrespon-
sibility is immediate extinction), then those
houses that most adhere to the goals of the
university community will disappear. If,
however, it is the freshman who is first re-
pulsed by incessant rushing, then his rejec-
tion is likely to be not merely of one frater-
nity but of the whole system.

It would seem, then, that both from a
philosophical and a practical point of view
the IFC should choose to establish a true de-
ferred rush, probably one beginning second
semester, This adheres to the faculty direc-
tive in spirit in that it provides for an as-
similation into the university's academic as-
pects, and for a general adjustment to the
college environment, before another distract-
ing, and ultimately less important, experi-
ence is undertaken. We further believe that,
without any kind of rush structure first se-
mester, the institutional impetus for imma-
turity and artificiality would be lacking and
fraternities would indeed assume that na-
turalness both factions consider necessary
for a rational decision to be reached. Ad-
mittedly, there are practical problems pre-
sented here, too, the most notable one being
financial, but the difficulty does not appear
insurmountable. At least wom san honest at-
tempt at reform. R.L.B,

Two Rush Plans Offered
On Contact During Rush

By Reeve Kelsey

The question that the IFC is fac-
ing this year—as last—is that of
contact—should there be unlimited
contact or structured, controlled
contact between the fraternities and
the freshmen. There are two plans
before the IFC for consideration.
The first, proposed by Chuck Cahn,
Danny Leonard and Jim Mathews,
is basically one of unlimited con-
tact. The second plan, introduced at
Monday's IFC meeting by Lawrence
McConnell, is one of limited con-
tact with rush in a structured con-
text.

The Cahn-Leonard-Mathews pro-
posal is obviously the more ideal
and utopian of the two plans. It
puts great faith in both the fresh-
men and fraternities to adapt quick-
ly to a new set of circumstances.
The plan, simplified, allows each
fraternity to rush as it sees fit. The
drawbacks to this plan are, however,
overwhelming. Given the intense,
one week rush period, which is the
heritage that the fraternities will live
with for the next few years, it is
almost impossible for the frater-
nities to make the transition to the
low-keyed, informal approach which

the vigilance committee it was learn-
ed that several Freshmen in college
did not know the star players of the
football team, it was deemed useless
to give any list of the faculty, who
are naturally not so well known as
the members of the football squad.
Rather than have the unsuspecting
students mistake the faculty list for
the membership list of Alpha Sigma
Sigma, it was thought best to give
some explanation in regard to the
excuse for the existence of such an
organization and also in regard to
the part that the faculty plays at
W.N, L.

Practically every college and uni-
versity in the country has at present
some kind of faculty. The custom
was begun in the dark ages and be-
came so well grounded that even in
modern universities where a large
and competent student body exisis,
there is always a faculty representa-
tion, although there may be no ap-
parent reason for it. Naturally a
leader, W. N. L. could not afford to
be behind in the matter, and conse-
quently has kept pace with the move
ment.

The prerequisite of W. N. L. fac
ulty members is a speaking know!l-
edge of golf and a respectable set of
golf sticks. Under the full professors
there are associate professors whose
only requirements are one golf stick
and an enthusiastic interest in the
subject. The instructors in each de-
partment have as their sole duty
attendance at the local golf matches
and payment of the golf club dues
The assistants who are subservient
to any one of the above-mentioned
authorities, are responsible for the
real work, which consists of estimat
ing class grades and calling the roll
at the laboratory hour. Owing to
the fact that the golfers of Lexing
ton have formed the habit of play
ing only in the afternoons, a sched
ule of classes has been drawn up in
order to provide some form of di
version for the professors during the
morning hours; attendance al these
classes is optional

The faculty at W. N. L. occupies
a father unique position, which
comes as the natural result of the
existence at the University of the
famous and feared animal, the au
tomatic mule, This animal is kept at
the University to awe the students
into a submissive state of mind and
to impress upon outsiders the rigid
requirements of the curriculum. i
is the duty of the faculty to keep
i close eve on the delinquent stu
dents at the end of each term, and
in case any poor unfortunate com
im sich chose prosimily to the an

mal as to he laul low, io inmned

ately set the fallen member on his
feet again. The restoration of the
fallen is accomplished by means of
grades on which the mule thrives in
a State of contentment. Consequent-
ly, when an assistant makes an error
in interpreting the grade curve, it is
the duty of the professor to raise
the grade to the degree required for
the appeasement of the animal. This
action is compulsory only in case
the student so requests—otherwise.
it is optional.

There is a movement on foot to
abolish the faculty entirely, but so
far the student body has remained
totally indifferent towards the mat-
ter.

is the only context under which
the Cahn-Leonard-Mathews proposal
can work,

First, fraternity houses are open
to the freshmen at all times. From
purely geographic terms, this puts
the outer eight fraternities at a com-
petitive disadvantage from the start.
Secondly, as Hal Catlin argued at
the Monday night meeting, there
are no restrictions on fraternity
combo parties—allowing for com-
bo-escalation with many fraternities
attempting to create the image of
‘the social’ house.

Although not quite as extreme as
the previous proposition, the obvi-
ous rush strategy for any house
would be to maintain a positive con-
tact with a given freshman on a
daily basis—always offering him a
little more than the next fraternity.
Give him the opportunity to go
down the road as much as he wants.
Make sure that he has a good time
at your fraternity every Friday and
Saturday evening—the basic objec-
tive would be intense rush and pres-
sure for the first one or two weeks
until he unofficially pledges.

With two, three, or four houses
applying the same basic strategy on
any given freshman, the escalation
in time, effort and money is inevit-
able. Danny Leonard suggested that
after a few days or weeks of this es-
calation, both the freshman and the
fraternity will realize that this is
really nonsense and give up the high
pressure technique. But will they?
Will not rush success ultimately go
to the house that can maintain this
type of daily contact?

The restriction in contact is not

Sazeracs’ Schedule To Include
Palm Beach Trip In The Spring

Outside of occasional appearances
at Evans Dining Hall during Par-
ents Weekend, concerts at an occa-
sional student organization's con-
vention, and a rare tour of frater
nity houses, the average WAL siu-
dent has little chance to hear the
Sazeracs, Washington and Lee's
singing fraternity, as the Calyx de-
scribes it.

Of course, this might be due to
the fact that as far as the Lexing
ton campus is concerned, this is
about all the Sazeracs do. Bui the
12 singers, led by President Bill Mc
Kelway, Business Manager Richard
Scruggs, and including Paul Hunt,
Van Pate, Peter Piltz, Herb Mash-
burn, Langdon Quin, Connor
Smith, Craig Dunnesnil, Jim Barter
and Tom Gillespie, make a nine-
month hobby of touring various
alumni and extra-curricular fune
Hons, in preparation for their an
nual trip to Palm Beach to appear
at the Tabu Club

Already the group has sung at
the Junior Banquet at Sweet Briar,
the Young Republicans’ Conven
tion, the James River Club for an
alumni meeting, Randolph-Macon’s
Fall Weekend, and a convention at
Greenbrier for college officials

The Saveracs, whe were named
for a drink served at the Hotel
Roosevelt in New Orleans made with
ibventhe, bourbon, bitters, ice, and

days a week.

Saveracs will

According to Van Pate and Tom

Beach will be divided among sev

clubs in the city, two shows per
night at the Tabu Club, lying
around on the beach, occasional
trips to Ft. Lauderdale, singing,
social engagements (both members
claimed that the Sazeracs are rec
ognized social lions in and around
the Palm Beach area, and in fact
went so far last year us to try to get
an audience with Christine Onassis,

didn't come off)

Despite the party air of most of
their activities, however, the Sazer-
acs manage (o pul in a lot of work,

From The J-School...

 

Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

As the Administration All-Stars
head south for spring training, one
important player will be missing.
Spiro “Spiker” Agnew, the All-Stars’
hard-hitting right fielder, is holding
out for a large raise.

In making his demand, Agnew
pointed out that he was voted
M.V.P. of the Southern Association
last year, beating out three time
winner George “Whiffer” Wallace.
Agnew’s clown act while playing
right field has also made him a
great crowd pleaser.

All-Star Manager Richard “Tricky
Dicky” Nixon said he knows Agnew
is a valuable member of the team,
but added that Agnew has presented
the team with a non-negotiable de-
mand. Asked what he plans to do if
Agnew does not sign for the com-
ing season, Nixon said the right
field job would go to Margaret Mit-
chell, a second-stringer the last two
years. “Margaret has performed well
when she has played and I’m sure
she can do the job as a regular,”
the manager said.

 

Agnew an All-Star Hold-Out

Agnew said his salary demand is
not unreasonable because he is more
than just offensive. “I did a great
job defensively last year against
such opponents as the Washington
Post, the New York Times, and the
NBC Peacocks.” Agnew claimed
special credit for driving Peacock
slugger Chet “Hawk” Huntley into
retirement. “With Huntley out of
the lineup, we can pitch around
Brinkley and they won’t hurt us.”

Agnew also claimed that his sa-
lary demands have the support of
the great silent majority of fans who
come to games but do not protest
when their team loses.

Nixon denied rumors that there
is a fued between him and his star
player due to Agnew hitting on his
own, rather than waiting for a sig-
nal from the bench. “Let me make
this perfectly clear,” Nixon said,
“there is nothing personal between
Spiro and me.”

Agnew denied published reports
that he is after Nixon’s job, and
blamed the reports on an unsym-
pathetic press.

_ ‘Earth Catalogue’ a Rare Item

By Betty E. Munger, Manager,
W&L Bookstore

In the summer of 1968 a veteran
of Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters
loaded 40 books and assorted mer-
chandise into a 1963 Dodge Camper
and toured Nex Mexico’s communes,
dispensing tools and practical ad-
vice to the settlers. This “Truck
Store” proved so successful that
young Stewart Brand set up a mail
order operation in Berkeley, Cal.
The first printing of his Whole Earth
Catalogue is now a collectors item.

Called by “Time” magazine “a
sort of Sears-Roebuck Consumers
Report the minorities of the cyber-
netic age”, the Whole Earth Cata-
logue’s stated purpose is to offer
access to tools for the individual “to
conduct his own education, find his
own inspiration, shape his own en-
vironment, and share his adventure
with whoever is interested”.

The most recent edition of the
catalogue (Jan. 1970, with a press
run of 60,000 copies) is an over-
sized paperback of 128 pages selling
for an almost unpaperback price —
$4.00. It is already hard to come by.
Here, we have sold 45 copies and
have 30 more on order.

The Whole Earth Catalogue in it-
self is a ticket for a mind-expanding
trip into worlds of creativity. From
Stalking the Wild Asparagus to
The Effective Executive — some-
thing for everybody. Road-side
camping? building an adobe house?

, Symposiums at Sweet Briar and Hollins
Favored in Poll Wi] Cover Black Man and Literature

Panel discussions and _ literary
prizes will highlight symposiums at
Hollins and Sweet Briar colleges
this coming week. The tenth annual
Hollins College Literary Festival
will be held Saturday, while Sweet
Briar will sponsor a program on
“The Black Man’s Role in Ameri-
can History and Society” March
19-21.

For the first time prizes of $100
each for poetry and fiction will be
awarded for the best poem and
short story submitted at the Hol-
lins Festival. The awards are being
made by “The Hollins Critic,” a
journal of criticism published by
Hollins College five times a year.
Winning works will be selected pre-
ceding the festival and discussed,
with other outstanding poems en-
tered, by a panel composed of poets
Howard Nemerov, Daniel Hoffman
and Richard Dillard. Entries have
been made by college students in
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Alabama.

Highlighting the festival will be
a panel on current literary trends
which will be composed of Louis
D. Rubin, Jr., Hoffman, Robert
Scholes and Walter Sullivan, and
moderated by John R. Moore. The
festival will close with a lecture
concert, “Rock Poetry,” by J. C.
and the Blessed, a rock band headed
by Hollins English graduate stu-
dent, John Currier.

Be

buying a used airplane? Yoga? At-
las Shrugged? It’s all there, ready
to be ordered.

In between the regular spring and
fall catalogue issues, Mr. Brand
publishes two supplements a year,
which update information and which
spread out into what is called “the
difficult but possible.”

The Whole Earth Catalogue may
very well have a limited life span.
Mr. Brand plans to stop publication
in 1971. “If by that time there aren't
people and ideas around doing a
better job than we have, then we'll
have failed”, he says.

Dr. Rubin is a professor of Eng-
lish at the University of North Caro-
lina. He headed the Hollins English
department from 1957 to 1967 and
founded, with Dr. Moore, “The
Hollins Critic,” of which Hoffman,
Scholes, Sullivan, Dillard and Ne-
merov are all contributing editors.

The Sweet Briar symposium will
feature national leaders in educa-
tion and religion and exponents of
black culture participating in a
three-day program of lectures, panels
and group discussions.

The symposium will provide a
forum for review of the history and
accomplishments of the black race,
and for discussions relative to the
co-existence of black and white peo-
ple without regard to color. Both
the problems and the opportunities
of the Negro in today’s society will
be explored.

Dr, Channing Emery Phillips will
deliver the keynote address at the
opening session Thursday evening,
Mar. 19. He will speak on “The

CAC Salvages Hardcourt Season

The 1969-1970 basketball season came to a thrilling close
last week with a College Athletic Conference championship.
The Generals finished 17-8 overall.

Washington and Lee opened the season on the road and

lost 57-56 to Randolph-Macon. De-
spite Mike Neer’s 17 points and 17
rebounds, the Generals were victims
of turnovers.

The Generals broke into the win
column, trouncing Bridgewater, 102-
87. Mike Daniel went wild, scoring
28 points against the hapless Eagles.

W&L resumed winning ways by
conquering highly-touted Rollins
84-62. This was a very strong win

Hampden Sydney was the next to
fall, 86-56, as “Magic Mel” Cart-
wright put in 25 points while grab-

points and took in 18 rebounds.

for 21 and 20 points respectively.
Neer also patrolled the boards for
20 rebounds in a game which was
marked by a fine defensive effort by
Ellie Gutshall.

Lehigh’s Engineers felled the Gen-
erals 85-71. Floor mistakes marred
the W&L effort despite Cartwright’s
20 points. Gutshall added 16 points
and Neer had 14 rebounds, but it
was not enough.

The Generals concluded the 1969
portion of the schedule by defeating
Centre, 91-78, and then Wofford 73-
63 to win the Washington and Lee
Invitational Tournament. Neer had
18 points and Cartwright 17 against
the Prayin’ Colonels. Against Wof-
ford, Cartwright got 25 points and
grabbed 16 rebounds while Neer
added 20 points. Both were all-
tourney choices.

W&L defeated Alma 67-59 be-
hind Cartwright’s 19 points. Neer
and Daniel contributed 15 each to
the cause.

Scrappy Virginia Commonwealth
overcame a fine performance by
Neer to beat the Generals, 90-83.
Neer tossed in 12 points while col-
lecting 17 rebounds,

The Generals bounced back to

overcome Navy 70-56. This second-
half victory came on the perform-
ances of Daniel, (16 points), Neer
(14 points), and Cartwright, (14
points). Gutshall once again led a
hand-cuffing defense.

Emory and Henry fell 82-52 as
Cartwright canned 25 points and
Neer grabbed 16 rebounds. The
Generals tight man to man defense
continued to cut off the enemy scor-
ing effort.

The Generals won again topping
Belmont Abbey 92-64, Cartwright
had 23 points and 19 rebounds
while Daniel poured in 22 points.

WA&L edged a fired up Hampden-
Sydney squad 76-72. Cartwright,
with 23 points and 22 rebounds, and
Neer, with 22 points and 16 re-
bounds, combined with another fine
defensive effort paved the way for
the victory.

Baltimore’s 70-66 victory was the
Generals’ fourth setback. Although
Neer dropped in 18 points and made
off with 27 rebounds, the Generals’
offensive show was lacking.

W&L battered Lynchburg 105-
60, as Daniel tossed in 23 points
and Neer grabbed 19 rebounds.

After a successful completion of
the regular swimming season —
compiling a 5-2 record with a sec-

Swimming Championships and an
overwhelming victory in the CAC
championships — Coach Stearns is
preparing with a three-man squad
for the college division NCAA
Swimming Championships. Captain-
elect Bill Brumback, Bim Clark,
and Alan Corwith have begun work-
ing for the championships which
will be in a week and a half.

Brumback who earned All-Ameri-
ca status along with Billy Ball last
year will be entered in the 50 and
100 yard freestyle events. Last year,
Brumback’s final time of 22.40 sec-

Coach Pleased With |
‘70 Baseball Outlook |

By BOB LaRUE

Although basketball has just
ended at Washington and Lee, the
baseball season is just around the
corner, as Head Coach Joe Lyles
has been schooling some 29 pros-
pects since early February.

“We got a good start indoors
with our pitchers, the best headstart
since 1 came here,” commented
Coach Lyles. “We also have more
depth than ever before.”

The Generals lost only three
starters from last year’s 12-8 squad,
which returns nine lettermen. Al-
though sophomore letter-winners Bill
Greener and Bill Miller are the
only remnants of last year’s pitch-
ing staff, the pair is accompanied
by six new faces to the mound.
Freshman Bill French, Tim Haley,
Haller Jackson, and Bruce King
have all been impressive. Coach
Lyles also plans to employ first
baseman-outfielder Ray Coates and
knuckle-baller third baseman Steve
Kalista in relief roles. Possible dark-
horses are senior Don Bock and
freshmen Don McMillon and Ralph
Smith.

Mainstay senior Jack Baizley will
once more start behind the plate,
while freshmen Greg Robertson and
Bill Greener will battle for the
number 2 position.

The rest of the infield is fairly
set at second and third, as co-cap-
tain John Nolan holds down the
keystone and Steve Kalista handles
the hotcorner.

Youth and Maturity
Winning Package,
Coach Szlasa Hopes

By DAVID TORRANCE

It is advantageous for any athletic
team to have young players, but it
is also necessary that a team’s mem-
bers be experienced. Youth and ma-
turity, two key factors for any team,
are incorporated into this year’s la-
crosse squad,

Led by two seniors, Jay Meri-
weather and Ned Coslett, the team
is gaining even more experience by
their pre-season scrimmages. In
yesterday’s scrimmage with the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, which held
second place last year in the Ivy
League, goalie Billy Ingersoll, a
junior, did an excellent job for the
Generals even though the Generals
lost. On March 16 and 17, the team
scrimmages last year’s Ivy League
champions, Yale. When the actual
season begins, there will be no rea-
son for lack of spectator support, as
there are only three games away
this year.

The defense this year, led by
captain Ned Coslett, third team All-
American last year, has a great
deal of depth. Returning lettermen
from last year are sophomores Tom
Smith and John Larmour and
junior Frank Stearns. Bob Radcliff,
on last year’s B-squad, will be re-
turning also. Several freshmen are
fine prospects: John Rogers, Donny
Eavenson, Towson Brown, Ed Mc-
Laughlin, and Jim Salmons.

The midfield will have much
more depth than in the past, with

RABE OIL

Jay Meriweather and junior Whit
Morrill, who was second team all
division last year, Also returning
from last year are senior John
Thomas, junior Bob Jantzen, re-
covering from an injury, and sopho-
mores Mark Skoggard, Todd Morrill
and Jim McCone. Freshmen ex-
pected to play a great deal will be
Chip Tompkins, Sam Englehart,
Tim Winfield, and Ed Tognetti.

The attack includes senior Tom
Groton, most improved on the
squad, and sophomore Scotty Neese,
leading scorer last year. Competing
for the third attack position are
freshmen Bob Brumback, Hank
Slauson, and Mott Lamotte.

With the scrimmages, the team
continues to get stronger so that
it will be ready for its first game
against Goenseo State on March 26.
Although one of the better teams
in New York, it has only four men
returning from last year. The game
will be here at 2:15, and Coach
Szlasa would appreciate as large a
crowd watching as possible. Later
on in the season, the Generals will
battle Towson State, one of the
stronger teams in their division,

This year, for the first time, there
will be a weekly national and reg-
ional ranking.

The Generals this year should
have a strong team. But Coach
Szlasa says that he has been dis-
appointed in the past by the lack
of spectator support.

Deferred rush was the Interfra-
ternity Council’s prime considera-
tion again this week, although dis-
cussion on the matter took place
after the formal meeting.

A proposal prepared by Lawrence
McConnell was presented to the
IFC committee meeting as an alter-
native to the Cahn-Mathews-Leo-
nard plan.

The McConnell plan restricts con-
tact between fraternity men and
rushees and provides for a structur-
ed seven week rush. The Cahn-Mat-
hews-Leonard proposal which was
presented last week does not restrict

contact and allows for what Danny
Leonard called a more “informal”
rush,”

The main problem for the IFC
is the preparation of a workable
plan which resolves the issue of con-
tact during next year’s deferred
rush. The proposals will be discuss-
ed at next week’s meeting.

In response to last year’s motion
for the IFC to aid in financing the
stay of two Kenyan students for
four years, a drawing was held to
determine which two houses would
feed and house the students. Kappa
Alpha and Pi Kappa Phi were se-
lected.

A drawing was also held to deter-
mine who would keep the exchange
student from Finland for next year:
Delta Tau Delta was selected. A
third drawing was held to deter-
mine which two houses would have
cocktail parties for a speaker com-
ing to the campus later in the year
from Sierra Leone; Pi Kappa Alpha
and Sigma Phi Epsilon were s¢
lected,

Scholarship certificates from sec-
ond semester last year were given
out to six fraternities: Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Delta Upsilon, Zeta Beta
Tau, Phi Epsilon Pi, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, and Lambda Chi Alpha.

Several announcements of impor-
tance from the faculty meeting were
made at the meeting. The faculty
has delegated to the IFC the power
of determining the necessary grade
point ratio for fraternity initiation.
The IFC has yet to decide whether
it will determine the necessary GPR
or leave it up to the individual
houses. The faculty has also relin-
quished the power to determine the
number and hours of fraternity par-
ties. The faculty stressed responsibi!
ity in determining when and how
man parties fraternities should hold,
and urged the IFC to take into con
sideration the town and the Uni-
versity.

More indirectly affecting the fra
lternities is the faculty decision to
revise the composition of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. Next year,
the SAC will be equally composed
of five members from the faculty
and five from the student body.

Cartwright Wins AP Honors

Mel Cartwright, who was just
named the Most Valuable Player in
the College Athletic Conference, re-
ceived honorable mention in the
Little All-America basketball team

named yesterday by the Associated
Press.

The Little All-America team is
named annually by the AP to honor
small-college players.

Dr. Colvin States Cut Policies

Dr. Milton §. Colvin, professor of
politics, has announced that students
in his B-hour Political Science 214
class will be allowed only three ex-
cused absences for the remainder
of the semester.

Noticing a decrease in class at-
tendance since the beginning of the
second semester, Colvin has issued
a statement to students in the class
on “Conduct of American Foreign
Policy.” The text of his message is
as follows:

This comes by the way of intro-
ducing myself to those members of
my eight o'clock class in Foreign
Policy whom | have not yet had the
pleasure of meeting, though many
of them asked my personal permis-
sion to take the course,

HEAR YE ALL MEN: As of the
printing of this notice, members of
the class will be permitted a total of
three excused cuts for the balance

Kelsey Analyzes
Rush Proposal

(Continued from Page 2)
designed to preserve any of the
artificial nature of the present rush
system. It is merely a guideline that
outlines what is considered a legiti-
mate rushing activity and what is
not... When rush can be held and
when it cannot. The restrictions are
designed to keep rush within rea-
sonable financial limits and to limit
the demands placed on the time of
both the fraternity member and the
freshman.

It has been argued that such re-
strictions are unenforceable. If the
fraternities are not even able to
follow a set of regulations, how can
they possibly be mature enough to
Operate intelligently under an un-
limited contact system? The restric-
tions and their enforcement provi-
sions are designed to protect the in-
dividual fraternity from the excesses
of its competitors

In conclusion, given WAL's heri-
tage of intensely competitive rush,
it is impossible for the fraternities
to adapt to an unlimited, unstructur-
ed rush over night. For the long
run preservation of the stability of
the fraternity system and the short-
run stability of student life at Wash
ington and Lee, it is inyperative that
the IFC adopt a deferred rush plan
that incorporates the basics of the
McConnell plan: 1) restricted con-
tact and 2) structured rush

of the semester. Any student who is
absent without excuse for the third
time will have his absence privileges
officially removed with no official or
unofficial remorse on my part for
the attendant penalties.

I had originally intended to serve
notice that I would drop the course
unless attendance improved, but it
is clear that such a policy would be
unfair to those now attending.

But students should reflect that
an understanding of the five-day
week was that students would honor
eight o'clock classes. If students
abuse that understanding, then per-
haps a second look at the five-day
week is in order.

s/Milton Colvin

Cartwright, a 6’5” senior forward
from Martinsville, Va., has received
many awards for his playing in his
four years on the Washington and
Lee basketball team.

He was named an All-College
Athletic Conference player in 1967,
1969, and 1970. In 1968 and 1969
he was given the Most Valuable
Player award at the W&L Invita-
tional Tournament. He made honor-
able mention on the Little All-
America team once before, in 1970.

As a senior on the Martinsville
High School basketball team, Cart-
wright was named a High School
All-American and the Most Valu-
able Player on the school’s 1966
state championship team.

During his four years with the
Generals Cartwright played 97
games, scoring 1800 points for a
career average of 18.6 points per
game. In his senior year he made a
school record by making 120 as-
sists. During his career he made
over 52 percent of all field goals at-
tempted.

Volume LXIX

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MARCH 18, 1970

 

Members of the cast for “The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui” rehearse a gangster massacre in a scene from
their upcoming production.

Troubs Perform “Ui” Next Week

On Tuesday March 24 at 8:30
p.m., the Troubadour Theatre will
offer its first performance of Ber-
tolt Brecht’s “The Resistable Rise
of Arturo Ui.”

One of several plays in his Chic-
ago series, Brecht’s “Arturo Ui” de-
picts the rise of a small time gang-
ster to a big time syndicate boss
Throughout the play, parallels to
Hitler's career are evident.

The theatre had hoped that the
Broadway musical “Hair” would
have been released for amateur pro-
duction by January so that its pro
duction at W&L would have been
possible this spring. Unfortunately,
W&L audiences will not be able to
view “Hair” this year
cording to Lee Kahn, director of the
theatre, “the company who handle
the rights isn't going to release the
show for amateur production main
ly because of the road company
productions touring the country this
year. | would expect that we'll be
able to produce “Hair” next year,
barring any unforseen difficulties

When asked about his reaction to
“Ui”, Mr. Kahn remarked. “Il
think that the point Brecht is
ing to make is that people like |
will always be dominating
because the world tends to sit back

because, ac

others

and let these types of people con-
trol them. It’s a very exciting and
moving play.”

Kahn plans to add slides, movies,
and sound to the production to
heighten and emphasize the parallels

tween Ui and his henchmen ani
Hitler and his group of followers.

The farce element in the play is
also influenced by the language of
the characters: “One really doesn’t
expect to hear quotes from Shake-
speare coming out of the mouths of
underworld characters.” Mr. Kahn
also noted that the play’s style is
much like that of an Elizabethan
Chronicle play, with much fanfare
and decoration,

Cast for the play includes David
Katz as Ui, Bob Carrere as Old
Dogsborough, Mare Scott as Givola,

David Christovich as Giri, Hugh
Hill as Roma, Carr Garnett as
Clark, Walkie May as Sheet, An

drew Wyndham as the Actor, Nan
Duvall as Dockdaisy, Champe Leary
as the Woman, Pree Ray as Betty
Dulifeet.

Other players include Lawrence
McConnell, David Olson, Jim Man
gan, Richard Pilkinton, David
Waelder, Beach Vickers, Chuck
Shufeldi, Wes Pullman, Joe Dozier,
Lawrence Reed, Hartley Roush, Al

Cut Limits Removed,

Left to Professors’ Discretion

Washington and Lee's faculty
took action on the questions of class
absence and student eligibility for
extracurricular activities during a
special meeting held on Monday.

Beginning in September, 1970,
the current university-wide absence
policy will be replaced by a state-
ment making student attendance in
classes or labs a matter between the
student and the professor in that
particular class,

In authorizing the change the fac-
ulty’s statement read, “A student's
participation in the work of a course
is clearly a precondition of his re-
ceiving credit in that course. Be-
cause of the wide variety of courses
and teaching methods at Washing-
ton and Lee, the University recog-
nizes that the nature of a student's
participation in the work of a course
cannot be prescribed on a Univer-
sity-wide basis, For this reason class-
room attendance is not a matter
subject to regulation by the Uni-
versity.”

Currently, student absences are
limited, with self-determination of
cuts reserved generally to Dean’s
List students, students with senior or
junior standing or freshmen in up-
perclass courses.

The faculty action on the eligibil-
ity of students for extracurricular
activities came from a recommenda-
tion of the Student Affairs Commit-
tee that was endorsed by the Stu-
dent Body Executive Committee.
The new requirements will also take
effect in September, at the start of
the 1970-1971 academic year.

Beginning next year, “students
on academic probation are academi-
cally eligible to participate in no

more than one extracurricular activ-
ity, athletic or non-athletic, during
the period of their probation. The
term “extracurricular” applies to
playing or managing intercollegiate
athletics, participating in intercol-
legiate debate, or in musical and
dramatic organizations, and to work-
ing on the editorial and business
staffs of publications.

In a closely related measure con-
cerning eligibility within the Uni-
versity, all requirements for partici-
pation in intramural athletics will be
abolished beginning in September.

Under the current policy, which
will be maintained through June,
students on academic probation are
ineligible to participate in any “ex-

tracurricular activities.” The num-
ber of intramural sports in which
an individual may take part is based
on his academic standing.

Lewis G. John, Dean of Students,
said that the “basic rationale” be
hind the changes was to “put re-
sponsibility on the student to do
what is best for him.”

In other action at Monday's meet-
ing, the faculty elected Anthony
Moncrief Coyne, a senior from De-
catur, Ga., as valedictorian for the
graduating class of 1970. Coyne is
a candidate for both the B.A. in
philosophy and the B.S. in mathe-
matics, and has a grade point of
3.85 (on a 4.0 scale) through seven
semesters at Washington and Lee.

[FC Accepts Compromise
Plan For Deferred Rush

several weeks of
discussion was reached Monday
night when the IFC resolved the
question of adopting a deferred rush
plan. Prior to this meeting, two
plans for the program had _ been
submitted: the Cahn, Mathews, Leo-
nard Plan and the McConnell Plan
The basic difference between the
two plans was that of contact, that
is limited versus unlimited.

A special meeting was called on

EC Approves Admission Report

By Steve Ory

Ihe Executive Committee took
final action on their part concerning
the report on the recruitment of
underprivileged students by recom-
mending that the study be consid-
ered by the faculty Admissions
Committee. The motion to accept
an amended version of the report
was passed 9-1 by the EC.

Sophomore Bill Andrews who
cast the only dissenting vote com-
mented that he objected to “change
for change’s sake, which I feel is
part of the reason for the report.”
Andrews also remarked that he con-
sidered the report as a challenge to
the identity of W&L, which he de-
scribed as “a unique institution that
is characterized by southern gen
tlemen personified by Robert E,
Lee.”

Staman Ogilvie sent in a proxy
vole against the motion to accept
the report. The proxy vote was not
honored because it made no pro
vision for an amendment which
passed earlier.

The amendment to the report sti
pulated that 1) graduation require
ments not be reduced for underprivi

leged students; 2) each underprivi-
leged student be assigned a faculty
advisor to whom the student would
report his progress regularly during
his first semester; and 3) the stu-
dent and advisor will decide
whether or not to terminate this re-
lationship at the end of the first se-
mester.

The amendment passed 7-3 with
Andrews, Drew Kumpuris, and
Dave Bethea opposed. John Mark-
ham, who sponsored the amend-
ment, explained “the emphasis
should be on guidance rather than
permissiveness.”

The committee unanimously ap-
proved Bethea’s motion that the
Student Curriculum Committee's
“Tentative Proposal for an Indepen-
dent Examination Schedule” be rati-
fied by the EC. This proposal will
now go to the Faculty Curriculum
Committee which is considering an

exam schedule adapted to the
shorter time period in the new
calendar,

Joe Tompkins introduced a pro-
posal calling for an at-large student
representative to the Publications

sentative would make the Publica-
tions Board more sensitive to the
sentiments of the student body.

Dean Kumpuris proposed an
amendment providing that the selec-
tion of such a representative should
be by a joint committee consisting
of three members each from the
Publications Board and the EC. He
noted that “a school-wide election
for such a post would be farcical.”

Henberg ruled the motion out of
order since the constitution gives the
EC only appellate jurisdiction over
the Publications Board. Dobbins
then moved that the EC forward
the proposal to the Board inthe
form of a suggestion. Dobbins’ mo-
tion and the Kumpuris amendment
were both carried.

A committee was established on
the suggestion of Phil Thompson to
investigate the possibility of a law
student being appointed a full-vot
ing member of the Board of Trus
tees. The committee will consist of
Alan Prater, Drew Kumpuris,
Thompson, and a few members to

a greater degree than did the ori-
ginal Cahn, Mathews, Leonard Plan.
It was this plan that was submitted
to the IFC as a proposal.

Discussion of the proposal cen-
tered around the contact issue.
Chuck Cahn, President of the IFC
said that after being on the Rush
Committee for two years he had
seen every rushing rule broken. He
stated that this one would be too,
and there is no real reason in adopt-
ing a rule if it will be broken. Larry
Honig, President of Kappa Alpha,
said, “There’s no point in forcing a
situation. Limited rush is a
specious thing. We have an obliga-
tion to integrate freshmen into the
university community.”

Reeve Kelsey, President of Delta
Upsilon, spoke in favor of limited
contact when he pointed out that
the unlimited contact propsal im-
plied maturity on the part of the
fraternities. Jay Wetsel, Secretary of
the IFC, stated that the competition
would be as keen for seven weeks as
it was during the one week in past
years. “I can’t see competition les-
sening,” he said.

After discussion on the proposal,
the question was called. The com
promise proposal, embodying limit
ed contact passed the IFC by a vote
of 11-4-1.

In other business, the IFC voted
to abolish the 2.0 grade point ratio
it had previously required for initia
tion. This provision was passed by
the faculty last week.

Andrew Wyndham
Squires presented a resolution to
the IFC calling for the abolishment
of housemothers, whom they termed
as “anachronistic, a financial
burden.” They felt that with the new
parietal rules the housemothers

and Mac

served no real purpose and were
serving in loco parentis. The pro-
posal passed the IFC and will be

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, March 18, 1970

An Unnecessary Compromise

The Interfraternity Council’s acceptance
of a compromise deferred pledging proposal
was probably the best they could do, given
the three alternatives to which they limited
themselves. Unfortunately, this plan incor-
porates some of the most serious defects in
both the other proposals, and the limiting of
scope to the three plans presented seems to
be dictated by fatigue and indifference rather
than by necessity.

The conflict between the two original
plans arose over the question of whether con-
tact between fraternity men and _ rushees
should be limited, and if so, how much. The
first plan allowed in effect unlimited contact
and provided for formal rush activities on
the weekends. The second placed rather se-
vere limitations on contact and included
rush dates on week nights. The compromise
plan, by requiring enough restrictions and
scheduling formal rush activities only on
weekends, hopes the academically deleterious
effects of rush will be minimized.

The difficulty is that, because open
houses are still scheduled before classes start,
W&L’s social aspects will retain at least a
chronological primacy over the academic,
and it is that primacy on every level that a

system of deferred rushing was to correct.

Probably at least as great a problem is
the more practical one of enforcement. Pres-
ent rush rules are not presently observed or
enforced, and we find no indication that they
will be under the new system. Danny Leo-
nard argued that the steeply graduated fin-
ing system would make violations prohibi-
tive, but we find it just as likely that because
of the “high cost of justice’ the Judicial
Board will be hesitant to impose any penalty.

On the other hand, the limited contact
rule, if it is enforced, will allow fraternities to
promote a false image much as they pres-
ently do and will not then deal with the need
for a more rational selection process, another
major reason for changing the rules.

The alternative which was patently ig-
nored is that of a rush beginning second se-
mester with open contact first semester. As
we suggested last week, the absence of a for-
mal structure first semester would remove the
likelihood of the feared “escalation of ir-
responsibility” in rush while providing the
possibility for an open assessment of the al-
ternatives available and for the establishment
of academics as the student’s first concern.

R. L. E.

A Matter of Respect

The student body Executive Committee’s
recent suggestion to the Publications Board
that it include as a voting member a student
chosen at large is laudable, and it deserves
acceptance by the Board.

Unfortunately the resolution presented
by Student Body Vice-President Joe Tomp-
kins was amended to provide for selection
by a panel of three EC members and three
members of the Publications Board, instead
of election by the vote of the student body,
which was Tompkins’ suggestion.

The arguments against an open election
do have some validity, but they are in gen-
eral based on a more cynical view of the stu-
dents than we think the facts warrant. The
objection is that students would not elect a
responsible representative. Yet those fears
were not sufficient to kill a similar proposal
regarding election of the Dance Board vice-
president, and we fail to see a substantive
difference in the responsibilities of the posi-
tions. In fact, it seems to us that students
would likely be more interested in the re-
sponsible supervision of publications for

which they are taxed than they would be
concerned about the functioning of the
Dance Board, to which they can subscribe or
not.

Assuming then that students will take
the position seriously, the direct election of
the representative would seem to be a more
effective approach to answering the need for
publications more responsive to the students.
Not only is it more democratic and less trou-
blesome for an already overworked EC, but
an elected student is more likely to have to
formulate ideas on which he can base a cam-
paign and to be more accessible, because
more known, to the students he represents.

The EC, because of its own magnanim-
ous gesture in the fall to revoke its control
over the Publications Board, does not have
the final say in the matter. The Board may
refuse to act on the suggestion, or it may,
if it recognizes the problem, choose another
means to rectify it. We hope it will have
more respect for its fellow students than
their elected representatives have exhibited
in raising the issue. R.L.E,

A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing

By adopting the faculty Executive Com-
mittee’s proposals concerning sophomore
and freshmen cuts, the faculty has made the
tragic mistake of liberalizing a rule to the
point where it has the potential to become
dangerously reactionary.

Both pro under consideration by
the faculty would have granted more free-
dom in the matter of class attendance to
freshmen and sophomores. However, the
more conservative of the two proposals, that
of the Committee on Courses and Degrees,
was more in line with previous University
philosophy concerning cuts, and was, in fact,
more protective of the rights of students.

Under the Courses and Degrees proposal
freshmen and sophomores in lower level
courses would be allowed six absences per
semester in a three-hour course. While this
number is the same as is currently allowed,
it must be noted that next year a semester
will be only twelve weeks in duration as com-
pared with the present fifteen week semester.
Hence, more frequent absences would be al-
lowed.

The penalty for over-cutting would be
the loss of one letter grade in that course.
However, as is currently the case, suspen-
sion of the penalty would be left to the dis.
cretion of the professor.

The faculty Executive Committee pro-
posal, which was accepted, represents a radi-
cal departure from the philosophy of the
Courses and Degrees proposal and the pres-
ent absence structure. The new plan creates
what at first glance seems a utopian paradise
for all underclassmen. Attendance will be

left to the discretion of the professor.

But in reality, this does not mean that re-
quired attendance will become a thing of the
past. Assuredly, many of the professors on
campus will choose not to restrict cuts. Such
a course of action is the most convenient and
least time-consuming, but it is not the only
course of action.

Just as a professor might decide to ig-
nore absences, he might choose not to allow
them, or to allow only a minimal number.
This latter possibility is not inconceivable,

By liberalizing absence regulations per-
taining to underclassmen in recent years, the
faculty has demonstrated that it believes stu-
dents should be allowed a degree of freedom
regarding attendance. It will now be possible
for a minority of professors to counter the
philosophy of the faculty as a body.

And with what consequences? Under the
new regulations, the penalty for over-cutting
will be whatever the professor deems ap-
propriate. The great danger is that it will be
possible for a professor to arbitrarily fail a
student for over-cutting. Professors who will
allow the least excused absences will prob-
ably impose the sternest penalities, as they
would be the ones who have the greatest dis-
taste for absentee students.

Whether a liberalization of underclass.
men's absence privileges was necessary is ir-
relevant to the matter. By bending over
backwards to insure that professors and stu-
dents are given the utmost freedom in the
area of attendance, the faculty may very
well have achieved the opposite of what it in-

tended, R.D.C,

Bethea, Azuma Defend
EC Admissions Report

By Glenn Azuma and
David Bethea
Chairmen, EC Admissions
Committee

At a time when the educational
process in America is subject to
great changes, there are those who
feel that many of the changes are
unwarranted. And often, when we
see the changes in historical per-
spective, we conclude that resistance
to them is justified.

However, there are some changes
that should not be resisted and in
our case cannot be neglected any
longer.

Traditionally, Washington and
Lee has offered an excellent scholas-
tic education. However, this form
of learning does not constitute the
entire educational experience of col-
lege. An equally important part of
this learning exists outside the lec-
ture hall and laboratory; this can
only be termed “experimental” edu-
cation,

In a college with a student body
coming from basically the same cul-
tural, social, and environmental ex-
perience, the interchange of differ-
ent philosophies and perspectives is
limited. It is unfortunate that Wash-
ington and Lee offers good formal
education but neglects that aspect
of learning which is informal and
experiential.

A program for the recruitment of
academically qualified, underprivi-
leged students hopefully will com-
plete that part of our education
which has been neglected. The fact
that in the past we have not offered
opportunities for this learning may
have contributed to the lessening
attractiveness of this school, as wit-
nessed by the recent yearly decline
in the number of prospective stu-
dents.

The committee has suggested that
in the evaluation of underprivileged
students SAT scores be de-empha-
sized. It is a fact that the SAT
tests have come under increasing
criticism in recent years as the pri-
mary criterion in college admis-

sions. It is also generally affirmed
that these tests are geared toward a
particular economic and _ social
group.

This objective form of testing
operates on a cultural bias that con-
sequently challenges the value of
their conclusions. Objective tests
which are more valuable indicators
of a student’s intelligence and abil-
ity are available and are suggested
by the committee. The Wechsler In-
telligence Scale and the Omnibus
Personality Inventory are less cul-
turally and socially limited than the
SAT’s and are more valid indicators
of the intelligence and capabilities
of these students,

It has been suggested that high
school performance and class rank
be utilized to a greater extent in the
evaluation. These have been proven
to bear a closer correlation with
performance in college. The com-
mittee proposals are hardly radical
departures from current admissions
thought. Throughout the nation
SAT scores have come under care-
ful scrutiny. Some colleges, such as
Bowdoin, have gone so far as to
disregard them altogether. This is
not our suggestion.

We realize that all available data
has some place in the evaluation of
prospective students. However, in
the case of culturally and socially
deprived students, it has been pro-
ven that SAT’s circumscribe their

Letters to The Editor

A Closed Society”

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

It appears according to a recent
editorial in this newspaper that
Washington and Lee is and will re-
main a closed society.

The editors of the paper believe
that this “is a school for snobs, but
it’s good academically.” They go on
to say that it is not our part to re-
cruit underprivileged students and
that it is not our obligation or re-
sponsibility to undertake this.

How self-righteous can we be to
say that culturally underprivileged
students have no place in this uni-
versity community? Are we going to
ignore the reality that our society
has been closed to many individuals
and that tests such as the SAT are
oriented to a middle class upbring-
ing?

It may not be the responsibility
of a private institution to give some
of these students a chance to at-
tend a small liberal arts college, but
it is our responsibility as human
beings and as a university to main-
tain an open intellectual community,
not a closed society for snobs.

The educational purpose of this
university as stated by the Board of
Trustees “stresses the importance of
the individual, his personal honor,
and integrity .. . and his responsibil-
ity to serve society through the pro-
ductivity of his training and his tal-
ent.” Is this university, and are we
as students, serving society by re-
stricting this university to those who
fulfill the accepted standards of hav-
ing grown up in a middle class en-
vironment? Are we being truly pro-
ductive by maintaining a closed
society?

Now is the time for Washington
and Lee to live up to its purpose as
a university, which is to give all
persons who have the potential of
making a contribution to this uni-
versity and to society a chance to
fulfill that potential

This is what should be the criter-
ion for becoming a member of this
university community, not whether
a person can meet middle class cul-
tural standards,

As Eric Hoffer so well stated,
“Our healing gift to the weak is
the capacity for self-help,” not the
closing of our doors.

How It Can Go Bad

To the Editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

Please allow a graduate and past
contributor to this paper an intru-
sion into the Washington and Lee
community once again.

In light of the recent allegations
by radical elements in this country
that the government—under the di-
rect guidance of the Executive

sent by devious and illegal means,
| would like to offer a bit of anci-
ent WAL history for the purpose of
explaining how a theoretically just
and lawful government might be-
come involved in such disgraceful
activities.

In the spring of 1968, a Repub-
lican Mock Convention was held at

of Steve Saunders. One evening, «i
a meeting of convention administra-
tors, Saunders brought up the pos-
sibility of some disorder at the con-
vention. For a group whose prime
concern was the orderly nature of a

objective utility. Therefore, it is our
suggestion that we acknowledge the
liabilities of the SAT’s and place
their results in proper perspective.
The underprivileged student ad-
mitted to Washington and Lee will
still be highly qualified, but his
qualifications (including class rank
and recommendations) will not be
judged with preponderant emphasis
on SAT scores.

The Freshman year in college is
a difficult time of adjustment for all
incoming students. The process of
assimilation, that is, of acclimating
one’s self to a new environment, is
not insuperable in itself. However,
this in addition to the inevitable
academic pressures common to all
first year students may prove overly
demanding.

It is with this fact in mind that
the committee has suggested the in-
stitution of a summer and transi-
tional year program. The two pro-
grams are not designed to cram in
twelve years of primary and sec-
ondary education (for that will not
be required), but rather to ease the
social and cultural transition into
college living. A slightly more in-
tensive program of counselling will
be offered for this purpose of ad-
justment,

These programs are not an ac-
knowledgement of unequal status.
Although it is a difficult concept to
express, we feel that a man may
have knowledge of his weaknesses
and not feel inferior.

The problems which face Wash-
ington and Lee in the establishment
of this program cannot be ignored.
The most crucial one of funding is
obvious, but from our conversations
with the Dean of Financial Aid and
the Director of University Planning
and Development it is not without
solution.

We welcome all responsible criti-
cism concerning the committee's re-
port. It is our hope that this reply
will set a tone of rational and con-
structive dialogue leading to valu-
able change at Washington and Lee.

coverage of the convention; the
Florida press would certainly be
there to record the participation of
its favorite son and governor, Claude
Kirk. Richard Nixon himself had
already agreed to speak to the con-
vention via telephone hook-up if
he won the nomination. Yes, order
was important to the members of
the Mock Convention Steering Com-
mittee who met in that room that
night,

The potential difficulty was this:
the California delegation was prob-
ably going to give first ballot sup-
port to Nixon because at that time
Ronald Reagan would not declare as
a candidate. Led by a very vocal
supporter, the Reagan for President
committee On campus attempted to
prove its right to cast the California
delegation’s votes for their hand-
some hero, Their proof was rejected
by the Convention leadership, and
now what was feared was a pos-
sible request by Reagan for Presi-
dent supporters to poll all of the
California delegates in the hope that
a majority would be for Reagan
and thus force the whole of the
California vote to go for Ronald
Reagan under the unit rule.

This would be a legitimate re-
quest according to the rules of the
1964 Republican Convention in San
Francisco which the Steering Com-
mittee hoped to have accepted by
the WAL convention to free them
from the task of drawing up a new
set of rules.

The question then raised by the
concerned convention leaders was
what to do. Saunders, with much
support all around, proposed that
two things be done. First, instruct
delegation chairman to have their
people clap and cheer whenever
Eisenhower's name was mentioned:
then, have a mention of Eisenhow-
er's name inserted in the siatement
which said all rules from the ‘64
Convention would be accepted ex-
cept the one allowing requests for a
poll of the delegates,

This way, it was reasoned, when
the chair called for a voice vote on
the rules, the cheers from the men
tion of Eisenhower's name would be
enough to allow the secretary of
the Convention to say, “the ayes
have it.” And the commotion caus
ed by enthusiastic cheering would
prevent the Reagan committee lead-
er from being heard even if he were

able to understand the railroad

“because I did not know what to
expect and any goal I might have
set could have been in the wrong
ball park.” However, he feels the
Athletic Department is making pro-
gress in many areas.

Work has finally begun on the
long-needed addition to the gym.

The tennis courts have been im-
proved,

Nine holes are being added to the
golf course.

The Athletic Department is mak-
ing ample use of alumni to help re-
cruit athletes.

Much of Corrigan’s time is devot-
ed to working with the many alumni
chapters. “Have you seen our alum-
ni pamphlet?” Without waiting for
an answer, he pulled a_ brochure
from a box and dropped it on my
lap. “We send a copy to every
alumnus who shows an interest in
the athletic program. If only 25 per
cent can help us recruit one athlete
a year, we will be doing real well.”

As Corrigan continued to talk, he
walked around his office, overcrowd-
ed with the wares of his trade—
books on all sports, pictures of ath-
letic teams, trophies (including the
railroad bell, symbol of overall
College Athletic Conference supre-
macy which has been won by W&L
the last two years), a box of tennis
rackets, samples of astroturf and
tartan turf, et al.

Although W&L is not involved
in “big time” athletics, Corrigan
feels there is no substitute for suc-
cess. “Winning and losing is very
important, I don’t know any other
way to judge the program. But the
boys are most important. They have
gone out to do something, and de-

serve all the credit when they su
ceed,”

“I’m more convinced than ever
that only our lack of ambition can
hold us back.” But Corrigan cannot
see any lack of ambition on the part
of his staff. “We have good coaches

. real fine people.”

In an attempt to re-evaluate the

athletic program, Corrigan has es-
tablished three committees which
will report their findings to him by
June 1. Coaches Szlasa, Leslie and
Canfield are studying recruiting to
determine the best possible way for
W&L to approach the task. “We are
looking for the same type of boy
that Dean Farrar is looking for. We
don’t want a boy who can’t stay in
here,”
_ The physical education program
is being studied by Coaches Stearns,
Davies and Lyles, and the intra-
murals program by Coaches Lord
and Aldrich.

“We don’t know that anything
dramatic will come out of these
studies, but I feel they should be
made.” The committees are taking a
close look at the type of programs
that are being carried out at other
colleges of all sizes.

Corrigan has found that his job
encompasses everything from the
coaches’ budget to the cleanliness of
buildings. He would like to delega‘e
more responsibility to his coaches,
but he has found that most prob-
lems come back to him in the end.
“I want to keep in touch with every
spect of the program.”

Is there any aspect he does not
enjoy? “None at all.”

when Ferlinghetti was arrested for
selling the Number One book of
beat poetry, Howl by Allen Gins-
berg.

Ferlinghetti was, and is, a major
figure in the “San Francisco Liter-
ary Renaissance.” He is founder
and owner of the City Lights Book-
store there, which was a center for
the way-out poets of the late fifties
and early sixties. He believed in
taking poetry out of its ivory tower
and putting it on the streets.

Poets were encouraged to read
their work in his store, coffee house
fashion. He imported Howl from
England for sale at City Lights and
was promptly charged with “know-
ingly offering an obscene book for
sale.” The resulting trial and publi-
city boomeranged on the officials by
attracting far greater attention to
the work and its marketer than he
could possibly have achieved through
conventional advertising.

Later, Ferlinghetti himself pub-
lished the book at his City Lights
Press. City Lights Press is a flour-
ishing business today and has issued
the work of a good many younger
poets, some of whom have gone on
to receive national attention. Among

peace and social progress” the OAS
has attempted to bring to the Wes-
tern Hemisphere.

The W&L Model OAS is a simu-
lated version of the real OAS, which
meets in Washington, D.C. This was
the first simulation of the OAS
General Assembly, which was
created by a new OAS charter rati-
fied Feb. 27.

The Model OAS met in its firsi
plenary session later Friday after-
noon to discuss the seating of the
Cuban delegation. Cuba has been
denied a seat in the OAS since
Fidel Castro came to power there.
The Model OAS rejected the at-
tempt to seat Cuba.

The Friday evening session was
prefaced by remarks from Joseph
Romanelli, an official from the U.S.
Department of State’s Public Af-
fairs Advisory Office.

Romanelli noted a change in the
role of the United States in Latin
American affairs. The Nixon ad-
ministration has attempted to em-
phasize United States cooperation
rather than dominance in the Inter-
American community, he said.

The basic issue for the evening
session was a border warfare crisis
between Guatemala and Mexico.
According to John Motsinger, sec-
retary-general of the Model OAS,

Mehl Favors
Recruiting Plans

By Walt Potter

John Mehl, director of financial
aid and placement, recently express-
ed a complimentary reaction to the
Executive Committee's report on the
recruitment of underprivileged stu-
dents,

The recommendations of the re-
port were approved with amend-
ments by the EC Monday night and
forwarded to the faculty Admissions
Committee. The report had been
prepared by a student committee
appointed by the EC.

Meh! termed his overall response
to the recommendations in the re-
port “positive.”

“First, | want to say that student
concern of this kind, especially actu
ally doing something about a prob-
lem as in this report, is excellent,”
he said.

“As for the report itself, I agree
in spirit with the body of the work.
| agree that it is necessary to have
student body diversity to maximize

crises such as this were planned be-
fore the formal sessions.

The value in presenting a crisis
such as the Guatemala-Mexico situa-
tion before the Model OAS lies in
the accuracy and speed with which
the delegates react to urgent situa-
tions, Motsinger said.

The crisis was solved by both
countries’ acceptance of an OAS ob-
servation team and a cease-fire line
between their borders.

The Saturday sessions were high-
lighted by a Peruvian motion which
urged the U.S. and the other Latin
American countries to accept fish-
ing rights within a 200-mile limit.
John McCarthy, a W&L sophomore
representing Peru, called for the ap-
proval of the OAS for the extension
in fishing rights.

Navy Comdr. Richard W. Ander-
son, who addressed the morning
session, asked McCarthy's permis-
sion for the U.S. delegation to the
OAS to use his speech as a basis for
future U.S. policy on the fishing
rights issue.

The Mexican delegation, from
East Carolina University, won the
honors as the best delegation at the
awards banquet Saturday evening.
Honorable mention was given to the
Peruvian delegation,

Border Warfare
Crisis Handled
By Model OAS

By Lawrence McConnell

John Motsinger, Secretary-Gen-
eral for the Model OAS, will be
quick to tell anyone that a simula-
tion such as the Model OAS will die
before it begins without a crisis for
delegates to cope with.

The purpose of the Model OAS,
according to Motsinger, is to simu-
late not only the procedure of the
actual OAS in Washington, D.C.,
but also the patterns of diplomatic
relations between the countries in
this hemisphere.

Through a study of the foreign
relations and internal affairs of their
respective countries, delegates should
be prepared to handle any conceiv-
able problem which might arise on
the Mock OAS floor. The crisis
situation forces delegates to react
quickly and decisively to an unex-
pected problem.

The major crisis of last week's
Model OAS was a border conflict
between Mexico and Guatemala,
which was brought to the attention
of the assembly Friday evening.
The following is an account of how
the crisis developed on the floor of
the OAS and how the delegations
solved the problems the crisis pre-
sented.

3 p.m.—The U.S. delegation is
informed by the CIA that guerrilla
activity in Guatemala is causing
conflict between Mexico and Guate-
mala, When Mexico and Guatemala
receive accounts of insurgent acti-
vity on their borders, both countries
substantively deny the reports.

10:15 p.m.—Both countries are
notified that communist guerillas are
retreating into Mexican territory
after a defeat by Guatemalan forces,

W &L Second in CAC

Strong performances in winter
sports have propelled Washington
University of St. Louis and Wash-
ington and Lee University into the
lead for the College Athletic Con-
ference overall championship.

Washington has a slim 2'-point
lead over W&L in the race for the
President’s Trophy, a huge bronze
bell symbolic of the conference
crown. WU has 87% points to 85
for W&L.

Centre College is a close third
with 75 points and Sewanee, Tenn.
is only 2% points back in fourth
place. Only last-place Southwestern
of Memphis appears out of the run-
ning with 55 points.

The points are awarded on the
basis of the schools’ finish in all ath-
letic competition, involving nine
sports. Ironically Washington U.

and W&L finished in a last-place tie
in football but came on strong in
the winter sports to take the overall
lead.

Washington and Lee won both
the basketball and swimming tour-
naments to garner most of its points,
while Washington U. finished sec-
ond in both wrestling and basket-
ball. Earlier the Bears had won the
cross-country competition.

Sewanee won the wrestling cham-
pionship and finished second in
swimming. Centre captured the foot-
ball title and was the runner-up in

Baseball Team Set

For Saturday Opener

Washington and Lee opens the baseball season Satur-
day, entertaining Long Island University in a double header.
It will be the Blackbirds’ first appearance on Smith Field

since 1968.

Following the Saturday action, the Generals host Cleve-
land State for single games Monday and Tuesday, round-
ing out the week with a single game March 26 with Bucknell.

Commenting on this weekend's
contest, head coach Joe Lyles de-
scribed LIU as a “good club all the
way. They're one of our top Op-
ponents.” After opening here at
WAL, the Blackbirds take on VMI
and Lynchburg next week.

Cleveland State returns to Wash-
ington and Lee for the third year
in a row. Last year the Generals
split a double header with the Ohio
school after winning a single game
back in 1968.

The Generals readied for their
opening encounters by scrimmaging
VMI at the Keydets’ fields last Fri-
day. The “A” squad dropped a tight
3-1 decision, but the “B” squad
countered with a 5-2 victory.

Speaking of the first game, coach
Lyles commented, “Left on bases
and walks killed us. We just couldn't
put it together.” Although the Gen-
erals outhit the Keydets, 6-2, W&L
lacked a key hit with men in posi-
tion to score.

However, coach Lyles liked the
pitching performances. “(Haller)
Jackson pitched good ball, and so
did (Bill) Miller and (Tim) Haley,”
he said.

The Generals “B” squad took ad-
vantage of wild VMI hurlers to post
their 5-2 win. Rich Murray's two
hits, along with timely raps by
Chris Coursen and Doug Clelan,

produced four runs. Don Bock and
Don McMillan performed well on
the mound.

Coach Lyles noted that in both
games a score was the result of the
inning’s lead off man getting on
base, either by a walk or by a base
hit.

“Splash-ins” Aid Winning Ways

tice and then goes on to win All-

Last year as a freshman “un-
known” at WA&L, Clark finished
second in an intramural swim meet,
prompting a visit by W&L swim-
ming coach Bill Stearns.

At Stearns’ urging, Clark tried
out for the team, and by the end
of the year was voted the Most Im-
proved Swimmer award. And this
year, he has broken all the school,
pool and conference records in both
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly
events.

His times have been so good, in
fact, that he has qualified for the
national college division swimming
meet next week in Rochester, Mich.
There, the top college division swim-
mers in the country will compete
for All-America honors.

Clark’s success has led Coach
Stearns to return again to the in-
tramural ranks. This year he dis
covered another freshman, Price
Blackford, who placed second in
both the 100- and 200-yard breast
siroke events of the conference mee!
and swam a leg on the champion-
ship medley relay team which broke
the conference record.

Coach Stearns says the same
thing this year of Blackford that he
said last year of Clark: “He's got
great potential.”

The pair of youthful swimmers
have had a major role in leading
WAL to a 5-2 season record, the
conference championship and the
runner-up spot in the Virginia state
meet, Washington and Lee has not
had a losing season in swimming
since before World War I

Speaking My Mind

UCLA To Win Title Again

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

And then there were four, The
prestigious NCAA ordeal has some-
how battered its way through the
consequences of a treacherous ACC
tournament, the fall of its big-name
team, Kentucky, the fall of even its
big-name Bob Lanier of St. Bona-
venture, and come up with four very
unique yet four very good teams.
Wending their way this week to Col-
lege Park, Maryland, for the pur-
pose of staking out their claim as
national collegiate basketball kings
are the proud Bruins of UCLA,
Jacksonville’s “nouveau” Dolphins,
the wounded Bonnies of St. Bona-
venture, and the ambitious Aggies
of New Mexico State.

Let’s take UCLA first. Where's
the low-post offense that was so fa-
miliar to us for three long years?
It's in Milwaukee, that’s where,
leading the NBA Bucks to a pos-
sible title. But the Bruins are play-
ing “who-needs-him” quite success-
fully. It'll be a high-post that we'll
see this time with guards Henry
Bibby and John Vallely feeding off
to their forwards or pumping it in
themselves. Center Steve Patterson
is hardly the mainspring that Al-
cinder was and the team suffered
just terribly for it. Two losses!
UCLA has annihilated Long Beach
State and Utah State to earn its
place at College Park. In the semi’s
on Thursday they'll meet New
Mexico State.

The Aggies are different this year
for the simple fact that they actu-
ally made it past the regionals.
After coming up empty the last two
years, it was about time. With fin-
gers crossed and rabbits’ feet in
their pockets, the staff at State had
hoped for and got their long desired
classification as a Mid-Western team
rather than Western. UCLA would
be playing on the other side of the
mountains and would stay there
until paths would cross and the
twain would meet at the University
of Maryland fieldhouse! In the ex-
citement the Aggies almost got
bowled over by a husky Kansas
State team but were able to squeak
by, 70-66. Then it was an easy vic-
tory over perennial upstart Drake
87-78 and on to meet the reigning
champs, UCLA. The bubble will
pop here, however. The Bruins have
never taken any nonsense from the
Aggie’s even when they ran that
bothersome slowdown game and
will probably have no trouble with
State’s fast game which will un-
doubtedly be on the docket for
Thursday's semi-final. Jimmy Col-
lins and his teammates will take
home bigger trophies this year but
still not the biggest as UCLA is the
one in this game by 10.

This will be the late game on
Thursday and many say that it will
be following a mismatch, the Jack-
sonville-St. Bonaventure game. For
Jacksonville, the uniqueness, the un-
orthodoxy lies in the questions,
“Who are they,” and “Hey, where
did they come from.” Unknown and
unheeded, the Dolphins now are a
basketball power, with no indication
of being a fluke concoction of play-
ers whose opportunism might over-
shadow the basic quality of the
team. Joe Williams, coach of Jack-
sonville, can blow the Bonnies off
the court if he so wishes, but it'll be
too bad if this happens, for it would
not be a true indication of just how
good this Bonaventure team had
been all season . . . with a healthy
Bob Lanier that is.

The game will be close in the first
half in any case. The guards on both
teams are sharpshooters and the

game is pretty much even here.
Both teams have their sparkplugs,
Kalbaugh for St. Bonaventure and
Dublin for Jacksonville. But oh!
the forwards, Without Lanier there
is absolutely no height whatsoever
up front for the Bonnies. If they put
5°10” Kalbaugh on forward Matt
Gantt’s shoulders, there might be
enough there to effectively cover
72” Artis Gilmore. But who would
cover 70” Pembrook Burrows then?
Although there’s a sneaking suspi-
cion that Burrows doesn’t command
all that much defense, the Bonnies
will have their hands full all the
same.

For St. Bonaventure it’s a tragic
uniqueness that characterizes the
team. Their big man will not play.

nies. When he was hot, the team

Generals prepare for first game by scrimmaging tough Yale team,

Stickmen Scrimmage

“The Lacrosse team will be well
prepared to take on their divisional
teams, Once the season begins,” ac-
cording to coach Szlasa. Having
faced a variety of formidable op-
ponents in scrimmages, Washington
and Lee is already a seasoned team.
Scrimmages must be judged in their
proper perspective. What's impor-
tant is not which team wins or loses,
but the amount of experience gain-
ed. It is in scrimmages that coaches
experiment by using different com-
binations or playing different peo-
ple.

Last Sunday, W&L played Ran-
dolph-Macon, employing a southern
style of offense, which consisted of
cutting and feeding. Unlike the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania’s northern,
dodging style of offense, a Ran-
dolph-Macon player would cut and
place himself in a good shooting
position in front of the goal, while
his teammates would throw him the
ball. On the Yellowjacket team
there was tremendous talent, against
which the Generals fared well, with
the game ending in a 6-6 tie.

On March 16, the Generals went
against Yale, the toughest team
they've played to date. Coached by
an alumnus of Washington and Lee,

Coach McHenry, Yale provided
great competition. Its players were
strong and good-sized. The Bulldog
defense pressed W&L while its of-
fense used both dodging and cutting-
feeding techniques. All of its play-
ers hit hard, three of them having
been excellent football players.
Against Yale, Billy Ingersoll, Whit
Morrill, Chip Tompkins, Sam In-
glehart, and Tommy Groton all did
a creditable job.

Most of the teams on W&L’s
schedule use a patterned offense,
where individual skill can be utiliz-
ed effectively. A tall fellow will be
placed near the goal so he can make
shots, while the shorter, faster men
will be outside the goal area, so they
can create a One to one situation.
All the teams we have played use
a man-for-man defense. In the event
that a defenseman loses his man.
other defensemen slide over to cover.
Hitting is another aspect of la-
crosse, as those who witnessed the
Yale scrimmage will attest to. Al-
though important as a morale fac-
tor, hitting must be controlled, so
that by putting an opponent out of
action for a few seconds, your team
can come up with the ball. In close
games, hitting increases.

College YR’s
of Virginia
Elect Seaton

The College Republican Federa-
tion of Virginia elected as its Chair-
man Cal Seaton, a sophomore eco-
nomics major.

Three hundred delegates, meeting
March 7 in Natural Bridge, chose
Seaton unanimously after his op-
ponent from Old Dominion College
withdrew.

Washington and Lee received
other honors as well. The Conven-
tion awarded a tie for Best Virginia
College Republican Club to the
W&L Young Republicans and the
W&L Law School Young Republi-
cans. Virginia Military Institute was
chosen as first runner-up.

The award for Best College Re-

also received Letters of Merit for

educational value for the student
body. I think the committee was
wise to point out that the recruit
ment of underprivileged students
would be for our own benefit.

“Generally the report pinned
down the problems, as when it point-
ed out that the financial aspect is
the most crucial and formidable
point of the program,” he added.

Pointing out that a major cam-
paign for contributions would be
needed to support the program, Mehl
estimated that “We would have to
go with five or six underprivileged
students for the next few years be-
fore we cduld do anything like 10 a
year.”

Mehl agreed with the report's
contention that college board scores
should not be given as much weight
in relation to high school records
in admissions decisions as they are
now, citing a statement by the Col-
lege Entrance Examination Board
that such tests should not be “the
chief instrument for determining the
proper selection of minority low-in-
come students.”

academic basis, a student who ha»
failed to maintain a 2.0 average
would probably not be selected.
Any counselor who goes on Aca-
demic Probation after being selected
will be asked to resign.

The awards of Counselorship are
not based on financial need, How-
ever, in order to ensure the greatest
possible contact with freshmen,
Counselors are provided with a sin-
gle room in the dormitory and din-
ner meal in Evans Dining Hall,
which they are expected to eat with
freshmen. Each Counselor will also
be expected to live in his dormi-
tory room seven nights a week,
rather than spending nights in any
outside apartment.

The primary basis of selection of
Counselors will be that of general
fitness to aid in making the Fresh-
man Dormitory an adequate en-
vironment for a student’s freshman
year.

Students who are presently Dormi-
tory Counselors and who wish to
return next year should submit let-
ters to this effect to the Dean of
Students’ office before Saturday,
March 21. In addition, returning
Counselors should indicate in their
letter if they wish to apply for Head
Counselor or Assistant Head Coun-
selor,

New applications for this position
of counselor in any of the Univer-
sity dormitories should be filed in
person in the office of the Dean of
Students by Saturday, March 21,
and should include information that
will be helpful to the Selection
Committee. Further details concern-
ing duties and responsibilities can
be obtained from Michael T. Thorn-
ton, Head Dormitory Counselor,
and Waugh Crigler, Homer Gam-
ble, David Kympton, John Nolan,
Assistant Head Dormitory Coun
selors, all members of the Selec-
tion Committee.

Pianist To Play Tonight

The Concert Guild of Washing-
ton and Lee University will present
a piano lecture-recital tonight by
Miss Anne McClenny, associate
professor of music and chairman of
the Division of Fine Arts at Hollins
College.

The presentation will be held at
8 p.m. in Lee Chapel on the Wash-
inton and Lee campus.

In her lecture-recital, “America’s
Musical Heritage,” Miss McClenny
will play rarely-heard works by
Alexander Reinagle, Raynor Taylor
and Benjamin Carr, all of whom
were active in America immediately
after the Revolutionary War. Many
of the compositions have not been
published since the 18th century and
therefore had to be edited from the
early printings.

Ferlinghetti’s own poetry has long
been popular on college campuses.

print. Strong words, carelessly
strung together, seem on the facile

we were very realistic that year

and found myself in complete agree-
ment with the suggestion. We all
were looking at the situation from
the perspective of order—we de
sired an orderly affair—and we fail-
ed to see that we were fixing the
game totally disregarding the rights
of the delegates and potential candi-
dates.

That we made a mistake was ob
vious to anyone who could be ob
jective. None of us were able. Per
haps it is true, as many information

Miss McClenny will also show

After receiving a B. A. degree,
with honors, from Hollins College
with a major in piano, Miss Mc-
Clenny attended Columbia Univer-
sity Teachers College, from which
she was graduated with an M. A.
degree with a major in music. She
later attended Harvard summer
school for study in music history
and the International Summer Aca-
demy at the Mozarteum in Salz-
burg, Austria, where she was a
piano student of Heinz Scholz. She
was twice awarded a Danforth

Tim Wright Recovering,
Will Return Next Fall

Timothy Wayne Wright, debating

last month in a car accident, has
withdrawn from the university for
the remainder of this semester on
advice from his doctors, according
to Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

Dean John, who received a letter
from Wright a few days ago, said
that Wright had missed four weeks
of school and recovery would neces-
sitate at least another two weeks.

Uclans To Take NCAA Title

Now with torn ligaments in his
right knee, he will sit out what was
to be the most important game of
his collegiate career.

But back to the game. The differ-
ence in defense seems to be that St.
Bonaventure plays it. Jacksonville’s
strategy is simple. When somebody
yells “helter-skelter” four beheaded
chickens run aimlessly around while
Gilmore waits to block shots and
get rebounds. The game will be
sloppy, but Jacksonville’s height will
prevail in the second half with the
Dolphins breaking the game wide
open. St. Bonaventure’s best won't

be good enough here. Jacksonville
by twenty.

So it'll be a UCLA-Jacksonville
finale. And from the guy who gave
you the Orioles over the Mets, the
Vikings over the Chiefs, here’s an-
other! John Wooden's California
boys will handily defeat Jackson-
ville on Saturday. The Dolphins will
give ’em a run for a while but the
Uclans will eventually climb up and
over Jacksonville’s seven foot cy-
clone fence of Gilmore and Bur-
rows.

And then there were four... .
four championships in a row for

Ollinger
Crenshaw

1905-1970

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, pro-
fessor of history at Washington
and Lee and official University
historian, died at home early
Thursday morning. He was sixty-
five years old.

A native of College Park, Ga.,
Dr. Crenshaw came to W&L as
a student in 1922, launching a
48 year affiliation with the Uni-
versity. He received his A.B. de-
gree in 1925, and his M.A. in
1926, both from Washington and
Lee. He then joined the history
department as an instructor,

Dr. Crenshaw received his
doctorate at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity in 1945, On leave from
WAL in the 1956-57 academic
year, he held the Ernest J. King
Chair of Maritime History at the
United States Naval War Col-
lege in Newport, R.1.

In 1947, he was named a full
professor of history at Washing-
ton and Lee, and in 1962, he
was appointed head of the his-
tory department. He — stepped
down as department head upon
reaching 65 last year, but he cori-
tinued active teaching.

For twenty years, Dr. Cren-
shaw meticulously researched
the history of Washington and
Lee in preparation of General
Lee’s College. His book won
broad critical acclaim as a sefi-
ous history of the institution, and
also a wilty one.

Robert Mottley, book editor
of the Roanoke World-News,
wrote of Dr. Crenshaw’s book:
“The bulk of Crenshaw’s writ-
ing is both measured and humor-
ous. His points are made clearly,
and then sunk home with a wry
turn of phrase. Throughout,
there is the sparkling ebullience
of a literate man writing about
something he loves.”

Dr. Crenshaw’s major fields of
research were the history of
American higher education, the

Old South, and the Civil War.
He was author of The Slave

States in the Presidential Elec-
tion of 1860, published by the
Johns Hopkins Press, and articles
for several historical journals, in-
cluding the American Historical
Review, The Journal of Southern
History, and others.

He was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Phi Gamma Delta,
American Historical Association,
Mississippi Valley Historical As-
sociation, Texas Historical As-
sociation, and Social Sciences
Association. From 1953 to 1955
he was a member of the execu
tive council of the Southern His-
torical Association,

Dr. Crenshaw is survived by
his wife, Mrs. Marjorie Burford
Crenshaw of Lexington, and his
son, Albert B. Crenshaw, a re
porter for the Washington Daily
News.

A graveside funeral service
was conducted on Saturday after
noon at the Stonewall Jackson
Memorial Cemetery by the Rev
D. Holmes Irving, Jr., rector of

SAC Broadens Law Parietals

By John Robinson

Last Wednesday the Student Af-
fairs Committee discussed three pro
posals dealing with an alteration of
the law students’ dormitory parie
tals, the Interfraternity Council's de-
ferred rush plan for next year, and
the IFC’s motion to abolish house-
mothers.

Liberalization of parietals in the
law dorms was recommended by
Dean Roy L. Steinheimer of the
Law School and passed by the SAC.
The major changes include the
dropping of the 3 a.m. curfew for
visitation Friday and Saturday; how-
ever overnight visitation will not be
allowed.

The weekend limitations on girls
in the law dorms remain in effect
Visitation will only be allowed from
Friday afternoon until midnight
Sunday .

In addition there will be no ap
pointed law school dormitory coun
selors next fall. Each section will
elect necessary representatives to
take their place.

According to Dean Lewis G
John, these proposals were accept
ed because of the increased matur

ity of the graduate student. He saw

little need at present for the re-
quired dormitory counselors in gra
duate school dorms.

Commenting on the IFC's defer-
red rush plan, Dean John said, “We
considered the plan in some detail,
and then decided to defer any fur
ther action until the next meeting

in April when IFC representatives
can be present.
“There were two basic areas of

debate—the ground rules for rush-
ing and the basic procedure of rush
dates. Ground rules will be deter
mined by the IFC, but the SAC will
finally approve these basic rules.
“But perhaps the biggest issue in
their proposal is the amount of con

tact between rushees and frater-
nity men.”

The IFC proposal to abolish
housemothers was defeated in the
SAC meeting on the grounds that
housemothers do serve a basic func
tion. The committee noted that
housemothers insure continuous
Operations of each fraternity and

encourage a “degree of civility.”
The committee commented
that no alternatives to housemothers
were pul forth by IFC. Some
alternatives mentioned were the em

THE RING-TUM PHI :

Washington and Lee has been
presented a gift valued at approxi-
mately $102,000 by Mrs. Cornelia
C. Gooch of Richmond, Virginia.

The gift, a bequest of the late
Mr. Claiborne W. Gooch, Jr., of
Richmond in which Mrs. Gooch re-
tained a life interest, was released
by Mrs. Gooch for immediate use
by the university.

The gift will be used to establish
the Claiborne W. Gooch, Jr. Schol-
arships in memory of the late Mr.
Gooch, a 1915 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, President Huntley
announced today,

The scholarships are to be award-
ed to financially-needy and deserv-
ing students, with preference given
to candidates from the Boys’ Home
in Covington, Va. and the Rich-
mond Home for Boys in Richmond,
Va. The fund further specifies that
recipients are to be persons of
“strong character and educational
motivation” who need financial as-
sistance in order to attend the uni-
versity.

The fund will be part of W&L’s
“Honor Scholarship” program, in
which aid is awarded in recognition
of outstanding academic achieve-
ment. In addition, as part of the
overall program of student financial
aid at Washington and Lee, totaling
more than $500,000 this year, finan-
cial assistance is made available to
all students who qualify for admis-
sion to W&L and who need aid to
enroll,

at a time when additions to financial
aid programs are needed badly by
institutions of higher learning. This
generous gift is especially important
because it represents one of the
largest additions to our financial as-
sistance program in recent years. It
is also of great significance because
it establishes at Washington and Lee
an entirely new scholarship fund.”

 

ABSENCE
REGULATIONS

Spring holidays begin upon
conclusion of classes on Friday,
March 27. Classes resume on
Monday, April 6.

Each student is expected to
make transportation arrange-
ments which will assure that he
is back in Lexington to attend his
first class.

Absences for all students (in-
cluding juniors and seniors) be-
fore and after the holidays are
limited to students on the Dean’s
List, to those on the semester
and midsemester Honor Rolls,
and to seniors in their last se-
mester who are applicants for
degrees, if they do not need
more than fifteen semester hours
and thirty grade points to be gra-
duated, and if they have a cumu-
lative grade-point ratio of at
least 2.00 and a grade-point ratio
of at least 2.00 on the work of
the preceding semester.

According to University regu-
lations a student taking an un-
authorized absence from his
classes or laboratory periods on
the last day of his classes pre-
ceding or the first day of his
classes following spring vacation
“thereby severs his connection
with the University”. Reinstate-
ment may be made only on con-
ditions to be determined by the
Absence Committee.

 

 

 

EC Elections Announced,
Committee Head Named

The Executive Committee has ap-
pointed Steve Robinson, a sopho-
more, to the chairmanship of the
newly established Committee for the
Recruitment of Underprivileged
Students. The committee was estab-
lished by the passage of the Admis-
sions subcommittee report last week.

Student Body Vice-President Joe
Tompkins announced the schedule
for the student body elections. Peti-
tions for student body offices will be
due on Monday, April 13. A pri-
mary election will be held one week
later on April 20, to be followed by
a run-off election the following
week on April 23 if necessary. The
deadline for petitions for class of
ficers will be April 27. Elections for
these offices will be held on May 4
If a run-off election is necessary, it
will take place on May 7

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, March 25, 1970

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw was a man of another time—a
time when “uptight” was not a jargon word that aptly match-
ed our national and inner conditions; a time when gracious-
ness, gentility, and just plain good manners rated higher on
the value scale than garishness and “doing your own thing.”

He was of the Old South.

The death of Dr. Crenshaw has ended an
era at Washington and Lee. For the past 48
years, Dr. Crenshaw studied, worked and
lived in the college community. Throughout
those years he earned a reputation as an ex-
cellent teacher and as a warm and friendly
person.

Very few of us can fail to remember the
tall, slightly bent gentleman walking down
the colonnade into Washington Hall. Few
have failed to hear stories about his unique
teaching habits. Yet only a few were for-
tunate to study under him.

His dedication to this school must also
be mentioned. He studied here as an under-
graduate and returned to teach history and
coach tennis. As time passed he became as

Off The Horns

The Dance Board is the student body’s
favorite whipping boy. While the Dance
Board has made overtures to the student
body in conscientious efforts to raise itself
from this critical mire, it has been unsuccess-
ful.

The Dance Board has found itself in the
unenviable predicament of trying to please
all the students all the time. The various
specialized brands of “music” offered by the
current breeds of entertainers are, however,
frequently exclusive in their particular ap-
peal. To supply as much variety as possible,
the Dance Board has in the past year divided
their program from four into six parts. Since
these attempts to please the students have
been futile, we question the wisdom of this
partition.

The entertainment scheduled this year
by this little group has been more varied.
The quality, however, has too obviously been
sacrificed. We are certain that this is due to
lack of revenue. The Dance Board has an
operating budget of about $40,000 this year;
therefore, we doubt the financial capability
of the Dance Board to bring quality per-
formers here even four times a year, not to
mention six.

Rather than continuing the expanded
program in number of University weekends,

much of an institution as the college itself,
bending with the winds of change. Both
names were often mentioned in the same

breath.

His dedication is borne out in General
Lee’s College, the only monolithic study of
this school. This work is historically accurate
and extremely amusing. It remains a monu-
ment to the institution and the man,

There will be no more “jotters” or legal
pads, and you won’t see students worrying
whether the eight books on the reading list
will be on the exam, or scrambling for front
row seats in Washington 33; for an era has
ended. It will never be forgotten.

B. Waugh Crigler

Of A Dilemma

we suggest that perhaps a curtailment to two
featuring quality groups would be more
palatable to the student body. Variety has
proven itself no worthy substitute for quality,
and apparently the Dance Board cannot of-
fer both.

The Dance Board has also been vigor-
ously assailed for their perennial failure on
the grounds that they are a self-perpetuat-
ing, out of touch clique. In a move designed
to end this line of criticism, the Executive
Committee recently extended a helping hand
to the dilemma-plagued Dance Board. The
prescription the E.C. suggested was to have
the Dance Board’s vice-president chosen in
a school-wide election. We propose, how-
ever, a more effective and efficient means of
remedying the ills of the Dance Board —
abolish it.

Although this may seem a radical solu-
tion, it is in fact realistic. If the ultimate goal
is to have a group responsible to student
sentiment, then the only method is to have a
committee chosen by the students. There-
fore, we feel the elected representatives of the
students—the Executive Committee—should
select the members of a Dance Committee
similar in status to the other standing com-
mittees.

A Right To Choose

The Student Affairs Committee’s rejec-
tion of the IFC resolution to abolish the rule
requiring housemothers was, we think, too
routine a dismissal, especially in the light of
the current financial difficulties many houses
are facing.

It is true that the hastily-drafted resolu-
tion did not offer any alternative, but we are
not sure one is necessary. Nor did it deal with
the problem of those houses whose leases
require housemothers, but that problem
could be settled through the Board of Trus-
tees.

Further, the IFC had little basis for ap-
pealing for justification to the tendency
away from in loco parentis structures, since
housemothers are anything but rule en-
forcers anyway and can be fired by the
fraternity if they try to be. Ir is, of course,
an example of the in loco parentis for the
university to require housemothers, but as
we understand it, that’s not the way the
issue was presented.

The truth the resolution contained is
that housemothers are an unjustifiable ex-
pense for the many houses now operating
on drastically constricted budgets. Moreover,
many housemothers who are resigning after
this year—there are several—feel they are
contributing nothing to the community on
the one hand and that their jobs are inse-
cure at best, on the other. That judgment is,
we think, substantially correct, and we fore-
see a great deal of difficulty in acquiring re-
placements.

The SCA contended, besides the objec-
tion based on a lack of alternative solutions,
that housemothers provide for continuous

operation and encourage a “degree of civil-
ity.”

That assertion seems unrealistic. First, many
houses pay members to oversee help and
plan the budget, and those that don’t, could.
As a matter of fact, this solution might help
fraternities subsidize potential members for
whom expenses are at present prohibitive.
As for the notion that housemothers encour-
age civility, it has been our observation that
those people who tend to be uncivil will be
so in spite of, and sometimes because of, the
presence of a housemother.

Finally, we cannot see the need for any
alternatives at all, though from the stand-
point of maintaining some intellectual at-
mosphere a substitute may be desirable. Fra-
ternity houses, minus the housemothers and
with the upperclass officers who are sup-
posed to live there, have more per capita up-
perclass supervision than do the freshman
dorms, and they have the advantages of be-
ing inhabited by students a year older and
presumably at least that much more mature,
and of members who have more common in-
terests and generally more consideration
than those students thrown together at ran-
dom in a dorm section.

It is true that many housemothers, most-
ly those who have been here for several years,
are an integral part both of the community
and of their respective houses, and we cer-
tainly don’t mean to suggest that they should
be removed. However, most of the house-
mothers here are not so integral, and we be-
lieve the fraternities should have the right
to choose.

Debate on the Admissions Report

Letters to the Editor

Rational discussion—of amy seri-
ous issue — is singularly difficult
and unrewarding in the academic
world, where passions run high and
ideology reigns unhindered among
the far from serene and judicious
professional wisemen in the halls of
ivy. And so one embarks hesitantly
and pessimistically upon any pre-
sentation of his views of the readers
of this journal. Still, two of last
Wednesday's features in the “Ring-
tum Phi” were so remarkably fool-
ish as to demand prompt reply and
rebuttal; and to offer these is as
much a duty as a pleasure. Both
pieces concerned propsed changes in
admissions goals and standards; it
will be recalled that the first was an
article by the two co-chairmen of
the EC’s admissions committee and
that the other was a letter to the
editor. Each seemed more absurd
than the other and I should prefer
merely to call attention to their hav-
ing been published together rather
than to consider them separately.

The aim of the three writers was,
it seems, to enlist support for the
recruitment and admission to W&L
in larger number than in the past
of students variously described as
“underprivileged” and “culturally
deprived.” Both articles contained
unflattering, or unfriendly, refer-
ences to the (naturally selfish and
villainous) “middle class” folk whose
“environment” has produced most
of the students enrolled here and
elsewhere in the past century, and
whose life-style and values have
been attacked with revived zest by
avant-garde writers, filmmakers,
and demagogues since the advent of
the New Frontier nearly a decade
ago. “Cultural bias” is the current
cliche that covers the colleges’ effort
to ascertain whether the elementary
tools of advanced learning are in
the possession of prospective stu-
dents. One gathers that a familiarity
with Shakespeare is the mark of the
“culturally biased” twelfth-grader,
and that high school courses in
“ghetto sociology” or the African
dance will erase said bias.

Beyond the condemnation of mid-
die-class values in America’s (re-
gretfully) middle-class society, and

Admissions Report:
‘Absolutely Nearsighted”
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Although the Executive Commit-
tee members might have done the
right thing by approving the Admis-
sion report on recruiting underprivi-
leged students, they were absolutely
nearsighted. They included all sorts
of provisions to enable the underpri-
vileged students to come here. But
did these EC men ever wonder if
these deprived students would stay
here for long? I don’t think so.

The two most probable reasons
for them to leave would be econo-
mic and social. The EC didn’t inves-
tigate into these deeply enough, In
this small town, student life is us-
ually centered on fraternities. The
students who have been culturally
deprived will not be able to adjust
to fraternity life as it is now. Some
fraternity people are too snobbish
and will associate only with people
of their own type.

Another reason would be racial.
Will they be racially taunted or be
placed in a corner of a house during
rush? I know. | experienced this and
still have bitter memories from it.
Ironically enough, some EC mem-
bers are in these fraternities.

Unless the admission report places
more emphasis on how these stu-
dents can be adjusted socially in this
school, then I think the report is a
failure and “change for change'’s
sake.”

A Proxy Vote
On the Admissions Report

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Please assist me in correcting an
error in your coverage of the stu-
dent Executive Committee meeting
of March 16. Through perhaps 4
mistake in interpretation by your re-
porter or the deletion of an ex-
planatory senience in the published
article, my position on the Admis-
sions Subcommittee proposal vote
was presented in your article exactly
opposite of my intent, As the other
EC members realize, | have wip
ported the efforts of the subcommii
tee since its inception, and cast my
proxy vote for the proposal exactly
as it was finally accepted.

s/Staman Ogilvie

(Editer'’s Note: Mr. Ogilvie’s proxy

voted for the proposal.)

the reflection of these in college ad-
missions, we come to the suggestion
that the absence of the “underprivil-
eged” here has limited “the inter-
change of different philosophies and
perspectives” that would arise, pre-
sumably, from the arrival on the
campus of various embittered and
perhaps eventually enraged slum
dwellers. Such a view of the restrict-
ed exchange of contrasting ideas
amongst a fairly homogeneous stu-
dent body can be supported, |
should think, by only the slightest
contact with that most common
campus character — the affluent
radical, the son of rich or of well-
off parents who spends his time and
energy at school in lambasting the
heartless Establishment (which has
been for over 30 years, of course,
an Establishment of the Left) and
calling for the overthrow or trans-
formation of everything that the
New Deal and its liberal successors
have produced during the past gen-
eration,

The third important point made
by the “Ring-tum Phi’s” contribu-
tors of last week was (so one reads
it) that the lack of an even more
heterogeneous student community
than W&L’s “may have contributed
to the lessening attractiveness of this
school, as witnessed by the recent
yearly decline in the number of pro-
spective students.” Indeed. And so
may the sinking of Atlantis have
led eventually to the eruption of
Krakatoa a few centuries later.
What does seem probable, if the ar-
gument may be shifted to less theo-
retical ground, is that the near trip-
ling of tuition in ten years ($750 to
$1900) has, unavoidably, deterred
many of those who would in less in-
flationary times have permitted their
m9 to apply to Washington and

We may put our delicate con-
sciences at rest by remembering that
the great state institutions—collec-
tively Behemoth University, for
Russell Kirk—will probably accom-
plish the work of civilizing and edu-
cating the children of the few re-
maining poor during the decades
ahead, provided, of course, that
“militants” and “activists” do not
permanently destroy Behemoth U.
A more important question, for us,
concerns the nature of the crusade
for “underprivileged” admissions at
WAL at this moment.

It appears safe to assume:

1. that the issue has been ex-
ploited largely by poseurs in
both the student body and
faculty who reckon lofty
gestures and noble rhetoric
about “human dignity” and
—to quote a “Ring-tum Phi”
contributor — “our respon-
sibilities as human beings”
to be shortcuts to applause
and even reward;

2. that William Buckley was

The Parking Problem:

“A Lack of Foresight”

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

The university administration has
readily admitted that the construc-
tion of the addition to Doremus
Gym suffers from a visible lack of
foresight and planning. A particu-
larly glaring planning oversight is
evidenced by the present parking
problem. The lack of reasonable
parking facilities has sparked the
imagination of many students, re-
sulting in rather original free-lance
“auto-art” expression.

Since the only entrance and exit
to the present parking space is by
way of the driveway coming off of
Route 60 behind the old dorms, it is
suggested that parking be restricted
in order to allow cars to move freely
both to and from the campus at the
same time. The present one-lane
situation is not only inconvenient
and highly distressing, but also po-
tentially dangerous due to lack of
space and vision. It is suggested
that parking on tht driveway be re-
stricted between the hours of 9 a.m.
and § p.m.

s/Richard F. Boyer

correct in suggesting a year
or two ago that most pro-
fessors are bored with their
lives or their work (or both)
and that many of those who
are braying for the “under-
privileged” and “deprived”
quite hope that members of
those groups, once here, will
produce some of the exhilar-
ating chaos that their fel-
lows have created in colleges
and high-schools around the

country;
3. that those who run our
smaller institutions, vain

men as men are, cannot re-
sist following the examples
(happy and unhappy) of
Harvard and Yale, and that
since the purchase, or “sub-
sidy,” of the poor is the cur-
rent vogue at those institu-
tions the same policy is a
tempting one for educators
in the provinces, After all,
if W&L is to remain a lead-
er, it must follow the others
forthwith.

In short, the issue turns upon a
definition of the responsibility of
the university to itself and to soc-
iety. Both will be served if admini-
strators, teachers, and students can
be recalled to the task of an orderly
and disciplined transmission and ex-
ploration of knowledge (with or
without apparent social “relevance”)
and to the conviction that a univer-
sity can and should remain precisely
an island of tranquillity and decor-
um above all when the rest of soc-
iety shows signs of madness. In no
way can a community of serious
teachers and learners wish to echo,
much less to experience, the bar-
baric and even criminal ways of the
outside world’s seedier, if one will,
underprivileged, elements. The work
of preserving civilization and learn-
ing was achieved a thousand years
ago by a dedicated minority amid a
near-savage populace; let us hope
to avoid the irony of sacrificing both
today—in an era of a relatively cul-
tivated majority beset by two de-
ranged minorities, a handful of the
malcontent poor and, much worse,
an alienated intelligentsia.

Conventional Dress:

“A Poor Choice”

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Even though there has not been
much printed on the matter lately,
the issue of conventional dress still
seems to be in many minds around
campus,

It is difficult to understand how
anyone can be so concerned about
students who do not choose to wear
coats and ties to classes, or any-
where else. Contrary to what seems
to be popular belief, the people who
do not choose to attire themselves
in coats and ties are not really all
slobs or freaks.

The main argument heard in favor
of conventional dress is that it gives
WAL something “unique.” If this is
the driving force behind the coat
and tie movement, then the people
supporting it have certainly made a
poor choice in what to be unique
about.

Something as petty, inane, and,
using a cliched word, irrelevant, as
wearing a coat and tie on campus is
nothing to brag about in 1970,
though it may have been in 1940,
which seems to be the prevalent
mind-set of WAL.

WAL does have something else
“unique” about it, according to sev-
eral outside sources, including some
very frank books about colleges.

This is a lack of intellectual curio-
sity among the students. Could this
be related to the “intellect” that
thinks a student body in coats and
ties is unique among universities?

A better thing to brag about
would be a student body that IS uni-
que, whether or not it looks it. The
uniqueness must be in the mind, not
worn on the body.

: From The J-School...

  

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

The Democratic Party has called
in Lawrence F, O’Brien to save a
sinking ship. As the new national
chairman, it’s O’Brien’s monumental
task to rescue the Democratic Party
from the rot that now infests it.

If any man can revive the Demo-
cratic Party, it’s Lawrence O’Brien,
the party’s most skilled professional
politician. O’Brien ran the presi-
dential campaigns of John Kennedy
in 1960 and Hubert Humphrey in
1968, steering both to a first ballot
nomination and Kennedy to the
White House. Humphrey was a nar-
row loser, although the odds against
the former Vice President were tre-
mendous at the outset of the cam-
paign.

However, the task of saving the
bankrupt Democratic Party might
prove to be too much, even for
O'Brien. The party is operating at
a monthly loss of $65,000. During
the 1968 presidential campaign,
half a million people contributed to
the Nixon campaign, but less than
100,000 contributed to the Hum-
phrey campaign.

During the last four years, Demo-
crats have lost not only the White
House, but also 15 governors, nine
senators, 50 congressmen, and nine
state legislatures.

And public opinion polls indicate
that things are not going to get
much better for the party of Jeffer-
son and Jackson. According to the
latest Gallup Poll, 48 per cent of
the American electorate consider
themselves Democrats, compared to
52 per cent just two years ago. And
only 26 per cent of the 25-and-
under voters identify themselves as
Democrats.

O’Brien can only do so much by
himself to save the Democratic
Party. What is really needed is a

crop of new faces to seek political
office. After the Goldwater debacle
of 1964, the Republican Party
launched its comeback on the many
new faces who were elected in 1966
—Reagan, Percy, Baker, Shafer,
Griffin, et al.

Currently however, the Democra-
tic Party is almost devoid of excit-
ing young politicians who might
emerge as national figures. John
and Robert Kennedy were tragically
killed and Ted is a pitiful weakling,
lacking in all leadership qualities.
Among the current party leaders,
only Edmund Muskie has shown the
potential to emerge as a nationally
prominent leader. Muskie was a
very attractive _ vice-presidential
candidate and is now championing
the fight for environmental improve-
ment, apparently the movement of
the 70's,

However, as a_ potential presi-
dential candidate Muskie has the
disadvantage of representing a small
state. No presidential candidate this
century has been from a state with
as few electoral votes as Maine.

Many Democratic leaders feel
the man who can revive the Party
is currently a Republican. If John
Lindsay has national aspirations, he
must become a Democrat. His own
party rebuffed him last year when a
conservative nobody named John
Marchi won the Republican primary
for Mayor of New York City. Lind-
say ran for re-election on the Liberal
Party ticket and won.

Certainly the Republican Party
will never nominate Lindsay for na-
tional office. Because of Lindsay's
strength in the cities, Nixon would
have liked to have had him as a

An Apology

Due to an oversight in
the March 18 edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, a misspelled
word in the article “Bet-
hea, Azuma Defend Ad-
missions Report” substanti-
ally changed the meaning
of that story.

The last sentence of the
third paragraph of that ar-
ticle should have read, “An
equally important part of
this learning exists outside
the lecture hall and lab-
oratory; this can only be
termed ‘experiential’ edu-
cation.”

The error substituted
“experimental” for “experi-
ential,” adding to their de-
fense of a program to
bring underprivileged stu-
dents here connotations
that were neither their in-
tent nor ours.

Jekyll-Hyde
Life Complex
In Apartments

By Reed Byrum

The student apartment stands to-
day as one of the more formal bas-
tions of collegiate independence in
America. Besides the nonconform-
ing, although at times seemingly
conforming, use of the body as an
expression of the will, the apart-
ment remains steeped in its tradi-
tion and pure in its symbolism of
free assertion,

The apartment exists in various
forms, which can be divided into
two basic types: the town and the
country quarters, Each has its own
special advantages and suits the
style of the students living in them.

The latter type takes several
forms: a converted barn, an old
farm house or an apartment com-
plex situated well away from camp-
us activity. It attracts the very real-
istic student—the one who knows
that during the winter months snow
will prevent his attendance of class.
Despite this distinct drawback, the
country apartment is one of the
more popular kinds of student hous-
ing.

In the vastness of the countryside,
student habitats can be easily spot-
ted by the most traditional of all
hallmarks—the crushed beer can.
Scattered about the front lawn, beer
cans mingle with their glass prede-
cessors and converge upon a path-
way leading to the entrance of the
house.

The interior is marked by ancient
furniture, peeling walls, layers of
dust, and piles of garbage. Upon
further study one also finds an ex-
ceptionally happy and satisfied stu-
dent. Carefree and uninhibited, he
pursues his unrestricted pastimes
with the greatest of exuberance, ar-
chetypically characterized by a beer
can in flight past a tube and on its
way to a fireplace.

The enormity of size provides for
another luxury—the extension tele-
phone. This can be employed to
great advantage while one’s room-

else, has changed. No longer do we
elegantly take the Grand Tour, Bae-
decker in hand, minutely examining
every painting in the Uffizzi. Today
we don’t try to “do” all of Europe
in a summer or to check off every
Great Mountain of a country.

The emphasis now is on people
and ways of life. The goals of to-
day's young trippers are to spend
little money, to explore less-travel-
ed roads and to get to know the
people of other areas of the world.
Often a whole summer will be spent
in one small section of a foreign
country, experiencing in depth the
life as well as the beauties of that
area.

Present-day travel books are gear-
ed to this objective more and more

Changes on the Dance Board...

By Joe Tompkins
Last week the Executive Commit-
tee passed significant proposals con-
cerning the Dance Board and class
dues,

In the past, the vice-president of
the Dance Board has been chosen
by the Advisory Council of the
Dance Board, which consists of the
president of the Dance Board, the
faculty advisors to the Dance Board,
and the president of the student
body. The vice-president usually be-
comes president of the Dance Board
the following year.

In the hope that more students
who feel they are qualified to serve
on the Dance Board will decide to
show their interest, and with the
belief that it will be beneficial for
all students to become more aware
of the problems and the responsibili-
ties of the Dance Board, the selec-
tion procedure for the vice-president
of the Dance Board was changed.

 

ways to see and do a lot for a little.
There are 14 different countries and
cities covered by this year’s edi-
tions, which range from “The Carri-
bean on $5.00 a Day” to “Japan on
$5.00 a Day.” The latter would be
especially appealing in this year of
Japan's Expo ‘70. Then there are
books for specific people—such as
“Student Guide to Europe” and
“Follow the Fun.”

Armed with a youth hostel mem-
bership card, an international stu-
dent id. card and an agile thumb,
the young people are roaming far
and wide. They even report back on
their findings to the Harvard student
agencies, who published “Let's Go,”
a student-written guide to travel in
this country and in Europe.

There’s no end to the number of
books about places to be visited, if
one felt inclined to bone up on them
before arrival. Michener's “Iberia”
is a finely written, lively account of
Spain, which makes one want to
light out for the Spanish Airlines.
There is an eye-catching book, “Lost
towns and Roads in America,” that
guarantees avoidance of the ten-
tacles of Interstate highways,

Everybody has his favorite “don't-
miss” places, so | want to add a
couple of my own. First, picnic
lunch under the Pont du Gard in
Nimes, France; and second, Cam-
den, Maine on the Penobscot Bay
when the windjammers are in

 

Beginning this spring, the vice-presi-
dent will be elected in a student
body election at the same time as
the election for student body presi-
dent, vice-president, and secretary.

However, to be eligible to run for
vice-president of the Dance Board, a
student must be a rising junior and
must have served on the Dance
Board Advisory Board or on the
Dance Board itself. This stipulation
was made so that any candidate for

A ani 8

the office would have some acquain-
tance with the duties of the position,

Realizing that there may be some
students interested in being vice-
prsident of the Dance Board who
are not on the Advisory Board, each
fraternity has been instructed to ap-
point another representative to the
Advisory Board for the remainder
of the year. Applications are also
being taken by Dean Kumpuris

| Trouble in Mudville

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

Alas, there is no joy in Mud-
ville once again. But this time we
can't pin the blame on poor old
Casey. Baseball as a game, as a
pasttime, and now as big business
is in trouble, deep trouble. It’s been
said before, many times, but al-
ways there was the Spring when
teams old and new, champion and
also-ran could make their migration
to Florida’s emerald cities of opti-
mism. A brand new start, and it
happened each and every Spring.
Until now.

A while back, the owners decided
that their game needed a new man
at the reigns. General William Ec-
kers road as Commissioner had in-
deed been rocky but only because
he was so unsuited to the role. En-
ter Bowie Kuhn. As Commissioner
he quickly showed his mettle by
solving numerous squabbles involv-

trade any player with a lawsuit
challenging baseball's reserve clause.
This would in effect undermine the
whole structure of the game and
virtually make every player free-
lance. Flood’s having trouble with
his case, but he’s gotten pesky Mar-
vin Miller all riled with the bit
about the reserve clause. Miller is
the attorney for the player’s associa-
tion and with him at the helm, they
are threatening a general strike. So
maybe there won't be any baseball
at all this year. Unbelievably this is
the least of Kuhn’s worries.

Denny McLain is the biggest al-
batross this year. As you know,
Denny got himself messed up with
Al Capone himself and had been
planning to bring back Detroit's
notorious Purple Gang before
Sports Illustrated so boldly inter-
rupted the whole affair. Actually the
severity of the situation is indeed
very critical, McLain was betting

    

For W&L Freestyler

W&L’s freestyle sprinter, Bill
Brumback, proved once again that
he is one of the fastest. For the sec-
ond consecutive year, Brumback
earned All-America status in the 50
yard freestyle event.

Out of 52 of the best college
swimmers originally entered in the
event, Brumback ultimately finished
10th in the 50 yard freestyle. The
first twelve finishers in each event
win All-America status.

ordered into camp. But baseball has
come to expect headaches from
Allen even though they're of the
migrain type now. Ron Reed of the
Braves, one of the game’s best
young pitchers broke his collar bone
and won't be back till June. Mike
Shannon, a Cardinal mainstay for
years developed a kidney disease
and is out for perhaps the whole
season. And, of course, the “Hawk.”
Ken Harrelson, the Joe Namath of
the game, will miss most if not all
of the °70 season with a broken leg.
Flood, McLain, Shannon, Reed and
Harrelson. The season is still two
weeks away, just time enough for
one or two others to bite the dust.

With Flood questioning the legal-
ity of the game and McLain its in-
tegrity, the plight of the “Seattle”
Pilots adds to the ruckus by intro-
ducing the dreaded echoes of bush-
league accusations to the Commis-
sioner’s ears, The season opens on

Brumback, in the qualifying heats,
finished 7th with a time of 22.4 sec-
onds. In the finals, Brumback went
a 22.513 seconds while first place
was a mere 22.2 seconds. With less
than a_ three-tenths of a second
spread between first and tenth shows
the highly competitive nature of this
event,

Brumback also participated in the
100 yard freestyle event and scored
a 49,746 second time which was the
best of the year for Brumback. A
49.514 second finish was the last to
qualify and it was won in 48.1 sec
onds.

The championships were held at
Oakland University—just north of
Detroit—in a newly constructed
pool equipped with electronic timers
that can time with accuracy up to a
thousanths of a second. The N.C.-
A.A. College Division Swimming
Championships were won by the
University of California—Irvine and
in second was Springfield College—
Coach Stearns’s alma mater.

Also traveling to the meet were
sophomore Bim Clark and fresh-
man Alan Corwith. Clark partici-
pated in the 200 and 100 dolphin
butterfly events. Clark’s time in the
100 yard event was 56.1. Needed to
qualify was a 55.056 second per-
formance. Clark's time in the 200
yard was 2:09.996. There were 39
swimmers entered in both of these
events,

Depth Is Key
To Lacrosse
This Season

If there’s such a thing as “bap-
tism under fire,” then Washington
and Lee University’s lacrosse play-
ers must be full-fledged Christians
by now.

The Generals have had five pre-
season scrimmages so far, including
two each with Yale, last year’s Ivy
League lacrosse champions, and the
University of Pennsylvania, the Ivy
runner-up.

The scrimmages have been a de-
finite plus factor.

“We are so much further ahead
this year over last year,” said W&l
lacrosse coach Dick Szlasa.
“Through the scrimmages, we have
found that our biggest advantage is
that we have a lot of people of
equal ability.

“We should be able to do con-
siderable substituting without affect-
ing our strength,” Coach Szlasa said.

This is particularly true of the
defense, where six boys should play
a lot: senior co-captain Ned Coslett,
a third team All-American choice
last year; senior Frank Stearns,
sophomores Tommy Smith and
John Larmour, and freshmen John
Rogers and Don Eavenson.

Four players also should see con-
siderable action on attack: sopho-
more Scott Neese, last year’s lead-
scorer; senior Tom Groton and
freshmen Bob Brumback and Hank
Slauson.

With more depth, Coach Szlasa
will be able to run three midfields
in and out of the games this year:
last year he had only two. Middies
Whit Morrill and Chip Tompkins
have looked particularly good in
practice, along with senior co-cap-
tain Jay Meriweather.

The real standout so far has been
goal-keeper Bill Ingersoll. “He could
develop into one of the best goalies
in our division,” commented Coach
Szlasa.

The Generals will open a tough
11-game schedule Thursday at home
against Geneseo State College of
New York. The real toughies on
the schedule are the Universities of
Virginia and North Carolina, and
Towson of Baltimore.

Generals Lose Openers
Against Long Island U.,

By Bob LaRue

Washington and Lee dropped
both ends of an exhibition game
doubleheader, bowing to Long Is-
land University 5-3 and 5-0, last
Saturday. The games did not count
because there was not a sanctioned
umpire present.

The Generals took the lead in
the first game 1-0 as LIU’s starting

Jacksonville Dolphin’s Season
A Contribution To Basketball

By Mike Riley

The NCAA Basketball Finals in
College Park, Maryland last Satur-
day afternoon went the way most
of the oddsmakers and many of the
fans in the country wanted it.

Coach John Wooden's Bruins of
UCLA won their unprecedented
fourth national college basketball
title in a row by defeating Jackson-
ville University 80-69.

But it seems the fans who cheered
the victorious Bruins and actually
booed some of the players on the
defeated JU ball club failed to ap-
preciate what the Dolphins did for
college basketball this year and
what changes they may effect in the
college ranks in the future.

Some harsh critics of Coach Joe
Williams’ Dolphins seemed to feel
JU had no right to be in the NCAA
regionals at all. They claimed that
Jacksonville's opponents this season
gave them no contest in many en-
counters.

JU, however, met and defeated
Harvard, Georgetown, and (at home)
Florida State—teams with better
than average squads in their confer-
ences—and went on to become the
only college team in history to aver-
age over 100 points per game. It

was no fluke that Jacksonville got
an invitation to the Regionals and
after that they really proved some
people wrong.

Jacksonville entered the regionals
as a Virtual unknown to many fans.
Yet, led by Artis Gilmore, Rex
Morgan, and Vaughn Wedeking, the
JU cagers single-handedly defeated
the “Kentucky Coalition”——Western
Kentucky and No. 1 Kentucky.
Sandwiched between these two vic-
otries was a defeat of one of the

Neer Triumphs

Washington & Lee missed the
NIT, but it was well represented in
the PIT—the prestigious and star-
studded Portsmouth _ Invitational
Fournament, now in its 18th year.

Both of the Generals, Mike Neer
and Mel Cartwright—were invited,
but only Mike could make it, and
make it he did, with the Chesapeake
Athletic Club, which won the cham-
pionship.

Maxi-Mike was teamed with top
pro prospect Dave Cowens of Flori-
da State and potentials Bob Cre-
mins, South Carolina captain; Van
Williford, MVP of the ACC, and

The Blackbirds broke the game
open in the fifth when Bill Greener
served up a grand-slam home run.
The Generals came back for a pair
of runs in the bottom of the seventh
in a last ditch rally attempt, but
LIU reliever John Seaman put the
stops to it and the final score was
5-3.

In the nightcap, the Blackbirds
blanked the Generals on three hits,
5-0. Southpaw Rick Gatto combined
with Jim Wallace for the LIU ef-
fort. Tim Haley, W&L’s starter,
was touched for a run in the third
and the loss. Relief appearances
were made by Haller Jackson and
Don McMillan.

The Generals looked fairly sharp,
but LIU’s superior pitching did
WA&L in. Coach Lyles attributed the
losses to mental mistakes. “We

noted.

mate is calling to get one a blind
date; the woods—conveniently plac-
ed near the house—can then be used
as a sanctuary of escape and hiding
when deceit riddles the girl's reply.

The country apartment's urban
counterpart is designed for a more
courageous breed of student: one
who is still able to cut a class guilt-
lessly, knowing well that neither
distance nor weather are true hin-
drances to class attendance. The
pathway of beer cans is replaced by
a third-story stairway filled with
such containers, which are hidden
in the darkness of a burnt out light
bulb among piles of dust. The en-
trance to the apartment is similar
to the approach to the inter-sanctum.

Dimly lit by flourescent lights, a
condition much like the country ver-
sion exists in all respects but quant-
ity—size, of course, is the only re-
striction to this. The delapidated
furniture of past generations is out-
lined by a bluish cast given off by
the always activated tube. Greek
symbols on the walls connote the
fraternal origins of ownership and
identify the apartment as one of the
several outlets of underclass expres-
sion of a certain brotherhood.

Food, remnants of thwarted ef-
forts at cooking, lays in decay
among cigarettes extinguished on
cracked plates. Album covers long
since separated from their entrails
are spread carelessly on a thread-
bare rug, almost completely swept
out of its existence.

Weekends and parental visits de-
cidely alter the composed at-
mosphere of apartments. Temporary
restoration is initiated by the in-
habitants in a brief burst of feelings

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Washington and Lee Generals tennis team opened its 1970 season
yesterday on an encouraging note by swamping the University of
Akron, 8 matches to 1. Led by junior Bill Gatlin (pictured above) who
won his match as first singles 9-7, 6-2 and then teamed with Jeff Dris-
coll to win first doubles, the team had no trouble in dispensing with its
major college opponent in a match that was played at VMI.

country; and JU rose from obscur-
ity to national renown.

The fans couldn't seem to appre-
ciate all this. And the UCLA sup-
porters couldn't even wait for young
Joe Williams to receive his team’s
trophy before they began cheering
for their once-again champion
Bruins,

It would seem they would have
the respect of true champions and
appreciate the valiant effort made
by Jacksonville.

Thurmonds of the Party vetoed the
idea.

However, Lindsay could win
nomination on the Democratic tick-
et. Lindsay has been compared to
John Kennedy, and as Kennedy
proved in 1960, you can win the
Democratic nomination in the pri-
maries and to hell with the bosses.

With the vote for 18-year-olds
almost assured, the young voters
will determine the elections of the
future, and it is these voters that
O'Brien must win over to the De
mocratic Party. Only by cultivating
young, energetic candidates can he
hope to win the young voters.

As Democratic Chairman,
O'Brien's first goal should be to
make John Lindsay a Democrat.

unanimously.

Concerning class dues, the Execu-

stating that each year the newly-
elected presidents of the rising

should meet and decide on a uni-

The amount of class dues is de-
pendent upon the number of univer-
sity cocktail parties to be financed
during the year, A student does not
have to pay his class if he does not
wish to; however, those persons who
do not pay class dues will be unable
to attend a cocktail party or any
other function financed by class
dues.

Volume LXIX

Dugan May Run
For Ga. Office

UNDER AGE LIMIT

W &L Sophomore Seeking
Lieutenant-Governorship

John Steven Dugan, a sophomore
at Washington and Lee, is consider-
ing running for the office of Lieu-
tenant-Governor of Georgia in the
upcoming November elections.

Dugan attended the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago in
1968 as a delegate from Georgia.
He said that “people in Georgia,
both liberal and conservative,” have
asked him to run for the office.

At present Dugan is still uncer-
tain about his plans. He is con-
sidering attending a press confer-
ence in Atlanta on Saturday morn-
ing, April 18, at which time he
could formally announce his deci-
sion.

The object of entering the race,
according to Dugan, would be to
establish a platform and to indicate
the intentions of a hopefully large

portion of the electorate. Dugan
also said that “most national at-
tention given to young people

today is focused on those radicals
aimed at destruction.” He felt that
his entering the race “would show
the responsibility of most young
people.”

In Georgia a person must be 25
years of age before he can qualify
for the office of Lieutenant-Gover-
nor. Dugan will be 20 on May 19.
He felt that if he were to get a good
portion of the votes cast, that law-
yers could overrule the age require-
ment. The law, he said, might be
declared unconstitutional on the
grounds that the rights of the elec-
torate are being infringed upon if
any candidate is denied the right to
run. The voting age in Georgia is 18.

Dugan presently is still uncertain.
Lester Maddox, present Governor
of Georgia, has already announced
his plans to run for Lieutenant-
Governor. Dugan felt that people
would vote for him as a protest to
Maddox. Under Georgia law, Mad-
dox is ineligible to run for re-elec-
tion as Governor.

Spring Weekend Plans Taking Shape
With Richie Havens Headlining Concert

Richie Havens will be the main
attraction of W&L’s Springs Week-
end, April 17-18. Entertainment for
the other night of the weekend has
not been signed as yet.

Richie Havens is probably one of
the most popular entertainers
around, His success has been won
primarily on the concert tour, al-
though his albums have often been
hits. His latest LP, “Stone Henge,”
has been on the Billboard Magazine
list of top LP’s for the last twelve
weeks. In addition to “Stone Henge”,
Havens has recorded “Somethin
Else Again” and “Richard P. Ha-
vens, 1983.”

Havens’
draws his

magnetic —_ personality
audiences close to him.
His quiet disarming approach to
each song makes him seem to be
confiding in his listeners who begin
to feel a part of the show, Indeed,
Havens incorporates the audience
into many of his songs like “A
Litthe Help From My Friends” in
which the audience actually be
comes the “Friends” and does all
the singing while Havens hums
along.

But aside from all the fun of a
Richie Havens concert, there's also a

Symposium Features
Labro’s New Movie

An _ unlikely candidate for de-
signation as an international cinema
capital, this city of 7,900 persons in
the Valley of Virginia is nonetheless
gaining close association with for-
eign films, and French ones in par-
ticular.

Last March and April, French
film-maker Philippe Labro shot some
sequences for his “Tout Peut Arriv-

” (“Anything Can Happen”) in the
Lexington area.

This month, Labro’s movie, not
yet released in the United States,
will be screened in Lexington as part
of a wide-ranging Symposium on
the Contemporary Motion Picture,
sponsored by Washington and Lee
University.

The symposium, to be held under
auspices of the Arthur and Margaret
Glasgow Foundation for the promo-
tion of the art of expression, will be
held in two segments—April 13-14
and April 20-21. Students from area
colleges, young film makers or other
persons seriously interested in the
film medium are welcome to attend,
according to O. W. Riegel, sym-
posium coordinator.

French theatrical films will be the
subject of four sessions of the first

segment of the symposium. Two
French film directors—Labro, and
Alain Jessua—will come to Lexing-
ton to discuss their films after
screenings. Labro’s “Tout Peut Ar-
river” will be screened at 7:30 p.m.
Monday, April 13, in the State
Theatre. Jessua’s film, “Jeu de Mass-
acre” (“The Killing Game”) will be
screened at 3 p.m. Tuesday, April
14, at the State Theatre.

Labro, an _ outstanding French
journalist who currently is a special
writer for France Soir of Paris,
came to the United States first at the
age of 18 to attend Washington and
Lee University where he studied
journalism and communications.

He returned to Lexington last
spring and filmed sequences for
“Tout Peut Arriver” at Rockbridge
Memorial Gardens, Radio Station
WREL, and the Lee Hi Truck Stop.
The rest of the film was shot in
France.

Bit parts in the film are played
by Pamela Powers, a 1969 graduate
of Hollins College: Clinton B. Pal-
mer, Ill, a W&L senior this year;
Martin Mullin, a 1969 graduate of
WAL; and Paxton Davis and O. W.
Riegel of the faculty of W&L’s De-
partment of Journalism and Com-
munications.

Washington and Lee students who
worked with the production crew
were Mullin, Charles R. Chittum,
and Clinton W. Murchison, all 1969
graduates, and Palmer and Glenn L.
Strohm, current seniors.

The Labro film is the story of a
man to whom anything can (and
does) happen in a short span of time
—tenderness and violence, love and
its absence, tragedy and comedy.
hirty-year-old Philippe Marlot likes
to define himself as a “salaried
tramp"—-a trained newspaperman
who wanders around the world to
observe his contemporaries and
write about them.

Student Elections

A most unfortunate situation developed last spring when
two seats on the Executive Committee were captured by their
only applicants. Certainly more than two students were quali-
fied for the positions of secretary and vice-president of the
student body.

We do not wish to demean the respective performances
of Mr. Chuck Dobbins and Mr. Joe Tompkins on this year’s
Executive Committee. Mr. Dobbins has done a superb job
as far as we can tell. However, the Executive Committee is
constitutionally both a legislative and a judicial body, and we
can only observe the EC in its legislative capacity.

The juridical aspect of the Executive Committee is by
far more important in respect to the individual student. The
EC has the constitutional authority to convict a student of an
honor violation and to ask him to leave school. It is pernicious
to the health of our academic community for a student to be
elected to this court of last resort without any opposition,

A student elected to the Executive Committee unopposed
is committed to no set platform concerning the legislative
function of that body. If such a student is an underclassman
(naturally anticipating re-election), he can abstain, as for
example Mr. Tompkins has, on several issues when he
should, in fact, be committed.

Petitions for candidacies for next year are due Monday.
We encourage any students who are at all concerned with fair
representation and the future of Washington and Lee to sub-
mit petitions for the EC positions.

We would also like to call the attention of the student
body to the fact that the former Big Four election has been
expanded this year to seven positions. In addition to the three
EC posts—President, Vice-President, and Secretary——and the
Fancy Dress presidency, the job of Dance Board vice-presi-
dent is now open to school-wide selection. The President and
Vice-President of the IFC will be chosen the same day with
suffrage and application for these two offices restricted to
fraternity men.

Environmental Concern at Washington and Lee has serv-
ed in recent months to arouse considerable interest in a com-
munity where apathy is all too often the rule.

From its inception several months ago, Environmental
Concern as a large group of interested individuals has emerg-
ed as a viable, dynamic, well structured organization that has
planned a symposium to be held in conjunction with Earth
Day, April 22.

The symposium even as it now stands is quite impressive
in both its scope and the quality of speakers it is offering;
particularly in light of similar activity planned on college
campuses throughout the country on the same day.

Such constructive and positive endeavors, at a time when
the mode of much campus activity is tending toward aliena-
tion and destructiveness, we find extremely refreshing and
we earnestly support.

April 22 is a day on which we may find excellent oppor-
tunity to educate ourselves further and to examine a very real
and perplexing problem confronting our society; one that
poses a very real threat to our very existence.

The initiative and drive sustaining and expanding this
active program has thus far come primarily from students.
However, faculty support and consideration are paramount.

To those ends we would urge the faculty to weigh the
merits of this undertaking, the serious and academic nature
in which its planners approached the program, and consider
foregoing or re-arranging classes to allow the Washington
and Lee community maximum participation.

A Simple Task

Gov. Holton’s campaign to clean up Virginia is being
given special attention by Lexington Monday in honor of his
visit here on Tuesday to speak for the Omicron Delta Kappa
Tap Day ceremony.

The city government has asked the W&L community to
participate in its efforts to beautify Lexington, and specific
notice has been called to the mess that surrounds most of the
fraternity houses around town,

The subject, it is true, is not monumental, and it is as
trite as school spirit. Nonetheless, the appearance of the fra-
ternity houses does reflect unfavorably on both the members
of those fraternities and on the university community in gen-
eral.

And if the subject is not monumental, neither is the ef-
fort required to correct the situation. Surely co-operation with
the town on so fundamental a level is possible, and we hope,
forthcoming.

For those people not in fraternities, the city is organizing
a volunteer clean-up campaign for Main Street beginning at
8:30 Monday morning and continuing through the day.

The whole effort is more practical than noble, but that is
not a reason to forego participation.

Local Pollution: Saving the Maury

By Bill Radigan and Chip Harris

To most inhabitants of Rock-
bridge County and the immediate
area, pollution has never been con-
sidered a relevant problem locally.
While not as evident as elsewhere,
pollution has nonetheless made in-
roads into the community.

The Commonwealth of Virginia
has created two pollution control
boards—for air and water—to estab-
lish pollution levels, to study areas
throughout the state to determine
organizations violating those levels,
and to prosecute those violators if
necessary.

The inception of the Air Control
Board only a few years ago has al-
lowed it only to go as far as meas-
uring community air pollution levels.
The Water Control Board, owing to
a longer existence, has been able to
determine not only the locations of
various levels of water contamina-
tion as area rivers move down-
stream, but also the specific sources
of pollution.

In most cases locally, towns and
industries have cooperated with the
board in attempting to alleviate the
problems they themselves are creat-
ing. Waterways continue to be pol-
luted, however. There is considerable
work to be done if standards are to
be complied with by July 1972, the
month and year that the state will
begin prosecuting any violators.

The Maury River is most directly
affected in the county by water pol-
lution, running past most major in-
dustries and through all major
towns. Donald Prager. Assistant Di-
rector of the Water Control Board,
commented: “The Maury is not a
productive river. Due to its soft
water, it won't support a large fish
population, and never will be a
fisherman's paradise. It is not by
any means up to its potential, how-
ever, and we have a fair way to go
until it is.”

Above the town of Goshen there
is no artificial discharge into the

Maury. However, following — the
Maury through Goshen until it fin-
ally empties into the James River,
man affects and contributes to the
river's contents in many ways.
Within the boudaries of Goshen
where the Maury is still the Calf
Pasture River, the river is industri-
ally employed by several firms.
Stillwater Worsted discharges over
500,000 gallons of treated water a

coloration of the river.

day at a point in the river where the
low flow is just 1.6 million gallons
a day. The chemically laden water
is allowed to stand in an anaerobic
lagoon. According to Prager, the
present method of treatment is un-
satisfactory, and the $00,000 gal-
lons entering daily need further at-
tention,

Further down the river is Ap-
palachian Wood Preservers creosode

Latex and dye discharge, although not harmful to life, will cause dis-

plant. Several years ago, their set-
tling basin was completely washed
out during a heavy rain, killing all
fish for a large area downstream. A
new system was designed and con-
structed, and is presently effective.

The Locher Silica Plant’s waste is
mainly sand and silt, and is put
through a settling pond. The effic-
iency is “questionable,” according to
Prager. Until last year a great deal

 

of silt was being discharged into the
river, causing much discoloration.
While the situation has improved,
Locher has presently engaged an en-
gineer to study the methods to deter-
mine a completely effective means of
eliminating the problem.

While Lexington is devoid of any
industry compounding the problem
of pollution on the Maury, the city
iself currently employs an ineffec-

 

Air pollution, not yet controlied by state regulations, remuins a problem for the Lesington area,

tive means of sewage disposal. Un-
like Goshen, which has no sewage
system, both Lexington and Buena
Vista possess primary treatment
plants. According to Prager this is
little more than “slowing the flow
of discharge long enough to allow
solids to settle.”

This treatment successfully re-
moves about 35 percent of BOD.
Roughly translated, BOD is organic
waste. Lexington is currently study-
ing the possibility of a secondary
treatment plant which they will have
to have within two years. Secondary
treatment removes about 85 percent
of BOD.

Bonded Fibers Corporation in
Buena Vista allows its heaviest latex
waste to settle out in a holding pond
before discharging into the river.
However, the rest of the waste is
dumped into the river. Two years
ago, when tested, the bottom of the
river downstream was almost liter-
ally a sheet of rubber. There is also
a problem of an occasional release
of dyes into the river, tinting the
water red or blue.

Bonded Fibers has ceased dump-
ing solid waste on the bank of the
river. They are still discharging 340
gallons a minute into the river al a
location where the river runs at a
rate of about 21,000 gallons low
flow. They are presently designing
facilities to alleviate the problem
further.

Reeves Brothers is currently
dunyping runoff that contains about
2 percent salt into the river. Two
hundred and fifty parts of salt to
1,000,000 parts of water is consider-
ed suitable for drinking.

Modine Manufacturing Company
is discharging waste into the Maury
from a bath preaspred to clean
metals. At the moment the only
damaging element is zinc. They are
presently designing a system to eli-
minate the zinc from the waste dis
charge.

The city of Buena Vista has a
situation completely parallel to that
of Lexington with their sewage dis-
posal. Their primary treatment plant
is also being studied to allow for the
addition of a secondary system.

James Lee and Son is responsible
for the largest load being dumped
into the river of the industries men
tioned, according to Prager, although
no exact figures are available. Several
years ago a dye containing insecti
cide was released into the fiver, re-
sulting in the death of much of the
fish population. Lee is also con
sidering treatment for its discharge.
which presently is receiving only
primary treaiment

Until two vears ago, the Water
Control Board had a staff of 3°
people for the entire state. The staff
has since been more than doubled
and the board's budget increased
considrably. A regional office has
also been opened in Lynchburg to
facilitate area inspection

" Re: Books...

On People Pollution

By Betty Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

In his Founders’ Day speech on
January 19, 1970 Dr. Norman
Graebner suggested that the basic
idea of survival should be consid-
ered as the present-day organizing
principle of education,

He proposed, for the 1970's, “a
new concentration on those subjects
that matter for our continued exis-
tence.’ No one who even scans a
newspaper today can doubt that the
concern for our environment — this
planet — is the dominant theme for
an increasingly large number of
people. Articles, books, pamphlets
are pouring from the presses. Every-
day brings new advertisements for
new books and new approaches to
older themes.

It really all begins (and could
end!) with people. There is a peo-
ple pollution, we are told. Of course,
not you and me: but there are a lot
of people too many on this earth—
and there will be many too many
by the time present students begin
raising their families.

More than a hundred years ago
the Rev. Thomas R. Malthus, writ-
ing an article, originally for the
Supplement to the 1824 Encyclope-

dia Britannica, stated the case clear-
ly and ominously. In On Population,
a classic now, Malthus pointed out
that when the population growth ex-
ceeds the means of subsistence the
growth of the population is checked
by such miseries and vices as starva-
tion, disease, war, etc.

To this dread list we can now
add another: pollution. The human
animal is destroying its own habi-
tat. By sheer force of numbers, to
begin with. The documentation is
tremendous, detailing the increase in
the birth rate world-wide, and the
dangers that lie ahead in the next
20 years. The Population Bomb by
Ehrlich, Silent Explosion by Apple-
man, 99th Hour and The Prevalence
of People, to mention a few.

All other problems of the destruc-
tion of our air, earth and water de-
rive from these huge increases in
actual number of people. There are
hopeful persons—the World Popula-
tion/Planned Parenthood Associa-
tion and Population Growth Zezo
(spreading out from its start in Cali-
fornia) for instance—who believe
that this headlong self-suffocation
can be stopped.

It isn’t a matter of good works or
a worthy cause any more. It is the
necessity for survival.

A pril 22 Earth Day Set
For Study of Pollution

By Ronny Sklar

Washington and Lee University, in
connection with hundreds of other
colleges across the country, is par-
ticipating in Earth Day April 22.
The W&L Earth Day Committee, a
branch of the University Federation
of Concern, has planned an in depth
program to educate the student body
to all the aspects of environmental
planning and control.

The all day program in Lee Cha-
pel will center around three areas:
the present state of the eco-system
and its future if no present action
is taken, the action being taken to-
day by responsible industry and the
general state of the arts in pollution
control, and what else we must do
to insure the quality of our life in
this finite eco-system.

At 2 p.m. in Lee Chapel, Pro-
fessor Thomas Nye will speak on
“The General Nature of the Eco-
System,” an appraisal of the present
and portents of things to come.

Following Nye will be Dr. Rob-
ert F. Testine, chief of Reynolds
Metals’ environmental planning
who recently testified before Jenn-
ings Randolph's (D-W.Va.) Senate
Committee on pollution. Dr. Testine
will speak on solid waste, and will

THE RING-TUM PHI

From The J-School . . .

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

You will excuse me for not writ-
ing about one of the world’s great
problems, like Spiro Agnew, but
this week is special. Baseball is back!

Now, if you think I’m the type
who gets emotional every spring
when a new baseball season opens,
you’re absolutely right.

They tried to tell us last year that
major league baseball was 100 years
old, but it really isn’t. Actually, the
major leagues date back only to
1962. That’s the year the Mets were
born; with a few birth defects—
“Marvelous Marv” Throneberry,
Sherman “Roadblock” Jones, Elio
Chacon, Harry Chiti, et. al.

To be perfectly honest, the Mets
were not the best team in the world
those first few years. The East Side
Little League could beat them. The
only distinction the Mets had was
baseball’s only professional base-
runner, Rod Kanehl. Unfortunately,
very few Mets ever reached base,
so Kanehl’s “talents” were often
wasted, In one game, no Met reach-
ed base against Jim Bunning.

In 1962, the Amazins set a rec-
ord for futility by losing 120 games,
provoking a _ never-to-be-forgotten
comment from manager Casey Sten-
gel, which I couldn't understand
anyway.

But improvement was swift. The
next year, the Mets lost only I11
games. In seven years, they manag-
ed to drop 737 decisions, which
averages out to a mere 105 per
season.

But spurred on by other seeming-
ly impossible dreams — the Jets
beat the Colts, Richard Nixon won
an election, Jerry Rubin took a
shower — the Mets went all the way
in 69. The greatest accomplishment
since creation!

A Look At The Mets

New Breed — those insane Met
fans — I claim credit for contribut-
ing my share to the miracle. After
all, I did quit my job one week
early last summer and drove 500
miles to the Big City to join 58,000
other maniacs in rooting, scream-
ing, and pleading the Mets past the
Cubs. The Cubs came to NYC 2%
games ahead of the Mets. After suf-
fering through successive nights of
Koosman and Seaver, they left only
¥4 game ahead; and twenty-four
hours later they were in second
place to stay.

When the Mets had built up a
safe lead for Tom Seaver in the sec-
ond game, the fans started to sera-
nade Cub manager Leo Durocher
with “Good Bye Leo.” When the
game ended, the tune changed to
“Meet the Mets.”

After the Cubs fell, the Mets
looked for other victims. First the
Braves, then the Orioles faded be-
fore the mighty forces of Gil
Hodges. Three times within a month,
fans celebrated by tearing Shea Sta-
dium apart, while the Mets poured
champagne on everyone’ within
sight, including Mayor Lindsay.

This week it all begins again. I'll
start worrying about Spiro Agnew
again next October.

The Last Dynasty

By Tom Gage

The last cruel yet inevitable blow
has been struck and thus to be add-
ed to the growing list of nature’s ex-
tinct breeds is that rare bird, the
professional sports dynasty. The last
of its kind, the grandest behemoth
of them all, has fallen. In a rag-tag
defeat in their last game of the sea-
son, the Montreal Canadiens, dar-
lings of many more fans than just
those in La Belle Province, failed to
make the Stanley Cup playoffs for
the first time in 22 years,

If you're a hockey fan, it’s im-
possible to believe that big Jean Be
liveau, the Pocket-Rocket Henri
Richard et al won't have the chance
of skating their splendid way to vic-
tory again this year. But, you know,

nor could we believe that the Yan-
kees had left their toe hold on Mt.
Olympus and had plunged to the in-
fernal depths of fifth place in 1965.
Professional sports were still im-
bued with the dynasty tradition then,
however. After all, wasn’t there foot-
ball’s Green Bay, hockey’s Mont-
real, basketball’s Boston, and even
golf's Big Three. It was an era of
predictability, but not one conducive
to heroes. There was about one true
hero per dynasty, a Russell, a Hor-
nung, or a Palmer. One by one they
departed, though. The Yankees, the
Packers in "68, and the Celtics this
year. But it was the downfall of Les
Canadiens that put the icing on the
cake.

Yet we must decide if the new

Lacrosse Team 2-1
After Spring Recess

By Frank Brooks

The General’s lacrosse team after
a great win over Geneseo State,
dropped a heartbreaker to Towson
State Teachers College by a score of
11-7. Despite intense hustle and de-
termination, W&L couldn’t _ pull
ahead of a spirited opposition.

The game was close up until the
very end. Towson led off with two
quick goals and picked up one more
minutes later, but Chip Tompkins
and Sam Englehart tied the score
in the second quarter. By the end of
the half however Towson had taken
the lead again, 5 to 3,

In the third period the Generals
capitalized on a series of extra man
plays to tie 7-7 with what seemed
to be a limping Towson State. But
this spirited the Tigers into dominat-
ing the fourth period and finally
winning.

The saddest aspect of the game
was that W&L played one of its best
games in years,

What was most encouraging was
the teamwork. Six of the seven goals
were assisted; the clears for the most

 

 

era devoid of the dynasty as it sure-
ly is, is not really of more benefit to
the sports scene. Oh yes the Yan-
kees with their M-M boys were held
in respect as were the precision
Packers of the NFL, but as the years
rolled by and pennant followed end-
less pennant, the love and enthus-
iasm for these teams dwindled into
a relatively quiet reverance. The
very fall of these teams would gen-
erate more emotion and excitement
than still another championship.
The new challenge to be met by the
heir apparents in the various lea-
gues gave the writers more to write
about, the broadcasters more to talk
about, and most important of all it
gave the people, the paying specta-
tors more to cheer about.
Montreal had a good hockey team
this year, but the share-the-wealth
draft had strengthened other clubs
as do similar drafts in the three
other major sports. If professional
sports did not make these somewhat
equalizing allowances to the weaker
teams, the dynasties would very
probably still exist today and the in-
vigorating new blood of such teams

part worked smoothly; and most en-

almost poetic.

The freshmen are most important

to this year’s team. Englehart,
Tompkins, and Brumback have been
making important contributions.

Coach Szlasa now has enough depth
to run three strong midfields and
keep both the attack and defense
fresh.

In the game, goals were scored
by Englehart (3), Tompkins (2),
Groton, and Neese. Neese had 2
assists and Whit Morrill had four.

Coming off the loss to Towson
State, the Generals swept past a
surprisingly powerful Villanova.
The game was a toss-up through the
third quarter. The fourth Quarter
however found the Generals shovel-
ing goals past the Villanova goalie.
When the smoke had cleared, W&L
had won 10-6.

WAL, obviously in control of the
game, took almost every face-off
and kept the ball in the attacking
end of the field nearly seventy-five
per cent of the game. Scoring how-
ever came with more difficulty
mostly because of a wet field.

Sam Englehart scored five times
and Tom Groton tallied another
four thanks to expert feeds by Scott
Neese and Bob Brumback who had
three each. Hank Slauson had one
goal and one assist while Whit Mor-
rill contributed an assist.

The Generals, now standing 2-1
this season, are looking forward to
the Duke game at Durham this Sat-
urday. Baltimore University will
visit Lexington Springs Weekend.

as the Mets, the Knicks, the Black
Hawks, the Bucks, the Jets, and
many others would be wasted on
one-sided competition.

The empire that brought the Ca-
nadiens the Stanley Cup nine times
in the last fourteen years has indeed
collapsed, and another of such ten-
ure shall never replace it. Montreal
still might come back and win it all
again next year however. The Yan-
kees once again have a contender.
and there are optimistic rumblings
up on that Wisconsin bay. But they'll
only be teams now, not dynasties.
The rare bird is dead.

Generals Limp Back From Florida

By Bob LaRue

Washington and Lee opened the
baseball season by sweeping a dou-
bleheader from Cleveland State but
suffered a disastrous Florida tour to
bring their current record to 3-4,

The Generals initiated the tour
with a 7-5 victory over Aurora Col-
lege, but dropped the second en-
counter 4-1. Harvard blasted the
Generals twice, 16-1 and 10-4, and
Florida Presbyterian College closed
the coffin with a five-inning 3-2 win
shortened by darkness.

W&L felled the Aurora nine by
unleashing a twelve-hit attack. Steve
Kalista, Ray Coates, Brad Hall, EI-
lie Gutshall, and Jack Baizley each
had two hits, and Kalista and John
Nolan drove in two runs apiece.
Freshman Bruce King, relieving Bill
Miller in the fourth inning, picked
up the victory. The Generals, down
3-2 after three, rallied for three runs
in the fourth and a pair of tallies in
the fifth. King fanned eight, walked
three, and allowed two runs on three
hits in his six innings of work.

But Aurora came back for a 4-1
decision on a two-hitter by Fred
Mueller. Scott McChrystal drove
in the Blue’s only run on a sacrifice
which scored Chris Coursen. Bill
French was touched for the loss in
his first start of the season.

Harvard crushed W&L twice be-

hind a thunderous offensive barrage.
The Crimson collected ten hits,
among them Doug Varney’s grand
slam homer in the third. The Gen-
erals could do no right, as Tom
Dashiell handcuffed the Blue on four
hits, three of which were banged out
by John Nolan. In addition, W&L
committed seven errors and a trio of
pitchers surrendered 15 walks. Start-
r Bill Miller was the losing hurler,
allowing six runs in two innings.
Tim Haley worked 1 1/3 innings,
giving up four runs. Don McMillan
gave up six runs, only one of which
was earned, in his 5 2/3 innings.

The Generals faired better in the
second game but still fell short, 10-
4. Mike Thomas’ three run pinch
homer off Bruce King in the sixth
put Harvard ahead for keeps, 6-4.
W&L scored twice in the first on
Scott McChrystal’s first of three
singles, and twice more in the sixth
on back-to-back singles by John
Nolan and Ray Coates.

King, the loser, pitched six inn-
ings, allowing six runs and six hits
while striking out two and walking
eight. Bill Creener yielded three
runs and three hits in two innings.
Harvard added a final tally in the

ninth off Tim Haley.

Florida Presbyterian edged W&L
in a five-inning contest, coming up
with three runs in the darkened final
inning. Bill Miller was handed his
second loss, allowing four of the
Tritons’ five hits, including Shawn
McElroy’s game-winning double, in
the murderous fifth inning. The
right-hander whiffed three and walk-
ed two.

The Generals jumped to a 2-0
lead early in the game, as FPC’s
Jim McIntyre walked five and allow-
ed Scott McChrystal’s run-scoring
single. But the Tritons brought on
Tom Ferber in relief, and the tall
right hander held the Blue to only
one single while striking out six.

The Generals had earlier welcom-
ed the season with 6-1 and 8-6 vic-
tories over Cleveland State. Bill
Miller fanned eleven Vikings while
walking two, and surrendered only
two hits to pick up the victory in the
first game. Home runs by Ellie Gut-
shall and John Nolan put the game
out of reach.

A five run tally, based on five hits
and four walks, lifted the Blue to
victory in the second game. Jack

Baizley, four for seven for the after-

noon, provided the key blow, a two-
run double to right field. Don Mc-
Millan was the winning pitcher in
relief.

After seven games, co-captains
John Nolan and Scott McChrystal
are team leaders in hits, batting
average, and runs batted in. Nolan,
with ten hits and five RBI’s, is cur-
rently hitting .417. McChrystal, with
nine base hits and four RBI’s, is not
far behind at .375. Others sporting
hefty batting averages are Ellie Gut-
shall (.318) and Bob LaRue (.357).

The Generals, almost halfway
through their season, have only play-
ed seven official games. The Long
Island University doubleheader and
a single game with Bucknell were
victims of rain. However, the Gen-
erals resumed action this week with
a single game Tuesday at Charlottes-
ville against U. Va. and a twin bill
with Old Dominion this Saturday in
Norfolk. The Blue nine have only
three scheduled home dates remain-
ing, entertaining Hampden-Sydney
April 16, Lynchburg April 24, and
Bridgewater May 4 for two games.
Under consideration are possible
home games with VMI and Holy
Cross, but nothing is definite so far.

 

There's something new in the way of tennis balls this season.

The W&L tennis team takes on
their second major college opponent
in a row when they go against the
Duke Blue Devils this afternoon on
the home courts, Coach Canfield and
his squad certainly hope that they'll
be able to dispose of this opponent
as early as they did their first, for
the Generals annihilated the Univer-
sity of Akron back on March 25. A
match with Bucknell was scheduled
for that same week but was rained
out, so the W&L team hasn't taken
to the courts against competition for
two weeks.

In all Coach Canfield’s squad will
be facing six major college oppon
ents this year but the challenge is
welcomed by the Coach, “We'll be
hard pressed to produce a winner,
but I think we'll do it. We've got a
good blend of freshmen and upper
classmen on this team. They've been
working hard and are more than
ready to go out after another con
ference title.”

Senior captain Tom MeJunkin
started working out the team with
calisthenics back in February and
formal practice started at the be
ginning of March. Due tothe
weather the team could not practice
on the WAL courts right away. “But

wormam sre $ Tennis Team to Face Rugged
Duke Blue Devils in 2nd Meet

our own courts have been improved
with a new sprinkler system,” said
Canfield, “and now if we can just
keep people with street-shoes off
them, we'll be in good shape court-
wise.”

Ihe line-up for the Duke match
will probably be as follows: Singles-
1. Bill Gatlin; 2. Stan Taylor; 3.
Marshall Washburn; 4. Jeff Driscoll;
5. Tom McJunkin; 6. Rick Arm-
strong. The doubles line-up: 1. Gat-
lin-Driscol; 2. Taylor-Cooksie; 3.
McJunkin-Armstrong.

won the CAC Championship during
the spring tournament at Centre.

‘Neer to Head Track Team

~ Overall, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s track prospects appear
about the same as last year. The
Generals have strengthened some
former weaknesses, but have tailed
off in some areas where they used
to be strongest.

“We will have more balance and
depth this year,” said W&L track
coach Syd Walden, “particularly in
the middle distance events. But we'll
be weaker in the weight events.”

The main strength and attraction
is co-captain Mike Neer, W&L’s
All-America high jumper. Neer cap-
ped off a fabulous spring last year
by placing fourth in the national
college division meet. The top four
finishers are designated All-Ameri-
cans,

En route

to the national meet,

Neer won both the Virginia State
and College Athletic Conference
chi i i i records in
both—won the Colonial Relays and
the NCAA Mid-Atlantic Regional
meets, and finished second in the
prestigious Penn Relays.

Neer has cleared 6-8 numerous
times in competition and feels that

Elections, Housemothers, Rush

Highlight Monday IFC Meeting

Routine business was the chief
occupation of the Monday night
IFC meeting. The first item on the
agenda was a note from the Student
Affairs Committee, requesting an
alteration in the rush plan proposed
by the IFC. The SAC felt that Sun-
day night rush dates were not ac-
ceptable, and they requested mem-
bers from several of the houses that
voted for the proposal to appear be-
fore them to iron out this matter.

The SAC also turned down the
proposal from the IFC which stated
that housemothers were no longer
necessary and should not be requir-
ed. President Cahn said that there
was some indication that positive
action would be taken on this mat-
ier next year as the composition of
the committee will be changed,

President Cahn announced that
nominations for President and Vice
President of the IFC would be next
week. Elections for these officers

will be held at the same time as Stu-
dent Body Elections.

The IFC will begin taking applica-
tions for next year’s Contact Chair-
man. The chairman will be chosen
by a committee consisting of four
members from both the IFC and
EC,

The two Kenyans which the IFC
voted to accept as foreign students
for four years were found by the
school to be academically unaccept-
able. Professor Drake has begun to

look for another student to their
their place for next year.
Dean John announced that the

week of April 13 would be “Clean-
up Week” in Virginia. Tuesday,
April 14, has been designated as
“Clean-up Day” in Lexington, as
Governor Linwood Holton is com-
ing to Lexington to speak at the
ODK assembly. Fraternities are en-
couraged to participate in this ef-
fort by cleaning up around
houses. The University will have
trucks to come around to pick up
any trash that the fraternity houses
may have. There will also be a
general effort to clean up the down-
town area itself and all students are
encouraged to participate. A group
will meet at the Robert E. Lee
Hotel at 8:30 that morning.

Lawyers To Talk Tonight
On Pueblo, U-2 Crises

Iwo Virginia lawyers will be at
WAL tonight to tell the story of
their involvement in two of the
most dramatic events in the history
of the Cold War.

Hugh P. Cline and Carl EB. Me-
Afee, who practice law in Norton,
Va., a town of about 5,000 people
in rural Wise County, were instru-
mental in the defense of U-2 pilot
Francis Gary Powers and in the re-
lease of the crew of the captured
U.S. spy ship Pueblo, They will tell
of their experiences beginning at 8
p.m. in the Alumni House, under
the sponsorship of the Student Bar
Association Speakers Committee.

The involvement of the two law-
yers (one of whom, Cline, is a 1948
graduate of WAL Law School)
came about because Oliver Powers,
father of the downed pilot, kept a
shoe shop underneath their Norton
office, When Francis Powers was
put on trial by the Russians, his
father insisted on retaining McAfee
to represent him, despite offers of
aid from several better-known law-
yers and McAfee’s lack of experi
ence in international affairs

Group Plans Four-Day Program
To Help in Selection of Major

By Jim Mathews
Assimilation Committee

The Assimilation Committee has
announced plans for a Majors Week
to be held April 20-23 in the Uni-
versity Center, The format, a series
of student-faculty coffees, is design-
ed to give underclassmen the oppor-
tunity to talk with department heads
and student representatives about
the various majors available under
the new, as well as the old, Univer-
sity Catalogue.

The purpose of the series, as de-
signated by the Committee, is to al-
leviate the problem facing the W&L
undergraduate in trying to choose a
major: that many times he cannot
acquire enough general information
and insight into a_ specific major
from simply reading the catalogue
or talking with a faculty adviser.

The Committee hopes that the
Week will: (1) help freshmen decide

on survey and elective courses for
the following year; and (2) help all
underclassmen compare the _ pro-
grams for majoring in each of the
departments, thus allowing each stu-
dent to be better able to make a
proper choice.

The departments which — offer
majors and are included in the series
are: Ancient Languages, Biology,
Commerce, Economics, Engineering,
English, Fine Arts, Geology, Ger-
man, History, Journalism, Mathe-
matics, Philosophy, Physics, Politi-
cal Science, Psychology, Religion,
Romance Languages, and Sociology.
Chemistry will not be included for
it already has a similar program.

Next week's Ring-tum Phi will
publish the schedule for each of the
above, as well as discussion leaders
and student majors for each part of
the Series.

Freshman Dean’s List Changed;
Faculty Reviews SAC Activities

The faculty lowered the grade
point requirement for freshmen for
placement on the Dean’s List at its
regular meeting on Monday night.
Where freshmen now must have a
3.5 average for the semester to be
placed on the Dean’s List, starting
next year a grade point ratio of 3.0
will be needed. This action was
taken because under the new system
of having professors determine the
rules for attendance for their own

Concert Guild Schedules

Marion Perkins, Pianist

Dr. Marion Perkins, a pianist and
music professor at Madison College,
will give a recital at 8 p.m. Tues-
day, April 14, at Washington and
Lee University.

The program, which will be held

spices of the Washington and Lee
Concert Guild.

Her selections will include Bee-
thoven’s “Sonata Op. 110” and “Son-
ata Op. 57°; W&L Professor Rob-
ert Stewart's “Five Miniatures”; De-
bussy’s “Two Preludes”; and Cho-
pin’s “Ballad Op. 23.”

Dr. Perkins has toured Europe as
soloist under the sponsorship of the
State Department. She has made
numerous appearances in this coun-
try, including a Town Hall recital
and a performance with the Hous-
ton Symphony. She also toured in
Mexico and performed last year in
Mexico City during the Olympics
Festival.

At the invitation of the late Artur
Schnabel, Dr. Perkins studied with
the renowned Beethoven interpreter,
and for many years has coached
with his son, Karl Ulrich.

Her doctorate in musicology
comes from the University of South-
ern California. Before joining the
Madison College staff, she taught at
Temple Buell College in Denver.

classes, freshmen on the Dean’s List
will not have unlimited cuts. Prev-
iously, any freshman on the Dean’s
List was granted unlimited cuts,

The faculty also elected Professor
Andrew W. McThenia of the Law
School and Professor Robert W.
McAhren of the History Depart-
ment to the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee. They will serve terms of two
years,

A report on the activities of the
Student Activities Committee was
submitted to the faculty. The report
was primarily concerned with the
question of revised parietal regula-
tions for the Law School dormi-
tories and the IFC’s motion to
abolish the requirement for the fra-
ternity houses to have housemothers
in residence.

The SAC in a meeting this after-
noon discussed deferred rush and
freshmen orientation. Three rep-
resentatives of the IFC were present
for the discussion on deferred rush.

NOTICE

Applications for next year’s CON-
TACT chairman are due a week
from today. They should be mailed
or given personally to Chuck Cahn,
IFC president and should include
ideas and an estimated budget. The
program is sponsored by the IFC,
but non-fraternity men are also elig-
ible to be chairman. Selection will
be made by four members of the
IFC Judicial Board and four mem-
bers of the student body Executive
Committee.

and Steve Maslansky, symposium di-
rectors. The day long activities,
sponsored by the University Federa-
tion of Concern, are designed to
educate the university community
into all aspects of environmental
planning and control.

The program will concern itself
primarily with three areas, the pres-
ent state of the ecology system and
its future if no immediate action is
taken; the action being taken today
by responsible industry and the
general state of the arts in pollution
control; and what we must do to in-
sure the quality of our life in this
finate eco-system.

All sessions will be held in Lee
Chapel.

At 2 p.m. Professor Thomas Nye
will speak on “The General Nature
of the Eco-System.”

Following Nye will be Dr, Robert
F. Testine, chief of Reynolds Metal's
environmental planning who recent-
ly testified before Jennings Ran-
dolph’s (D-W.Va.) Senate Committee
on pollution. Dr, Testine will speak
on the subject of solid waste, and
will be aided by a representative
from the West Virginia Pulp and
Paper Company discussing water
pollution, and a representative from
the Ethyl Corporation speaking on
air pollution.

Bernard Cohen, one of the most
renowned lawyers active in the field
of resources and pollution law, will

Richie Havens will appear in concert Saturday night as part of this
year’s schedule for Springs Weekend. A Friday night concert will fea-

ture the new group Dreams.

‘Dreams’

To Be Featured

In Friday Night Concert

A highly-touted new jazz-rock
ensemble called “Dreams” has been
contracted to perform at Friday
night's Springs Concert. This group,
which has received rave reviews at
Colgate, Bucknell and Vanderbilt,
will complement Saturday night's en
tertainment featuring Richie Havens

Dreams is an exciting and unusual
new group which has played to
standing ovations at the Fillmore
East and The Electric Circus as well
as its college engagements. Provid
ing a hint as to where Rock is head
ed, Dreams fuses the inspirations
and influences of six outstanding
musicians into a true group experi-
ence which projects a fire and spon-
taneity never heard before in a horn
band

The last year has witnessed many

Joe Klee of Rock magazine caught
them in concert at the Fillmore
where they brought down the house
He considers them better than
BS&T,. “Well, for one thing, the
band is not over-arranged (one of
BS&T’s problems). It doesn’t sound
like a bunch of session men reading
parts. Kent, Rogers, and the Breck-
ers are solo voices whose improvisa-
tions are not jazz or rock, but in-
dividual musical personalities play-
ing their thing. Another difference is
the songs written by Lubhan and
Kent. Whereas BST relies on pre-
viously written material for the most

part, Dreams does all originals.”

But perhaps the most ecstatic re-
action was that of Colgate’s Student

Activities Director James MecClin
tock when he wrote Dreams’ man
iger that “the group provided the

most sensational ‘opening act’ with

trouble, as a result, was that

The deadline for petitions was not
extended and consequently the posi-
tion will not appear on the ballots.
No arrangements have been made
with regard to filling the position.

Candidates will speak in Evans
Dining Hall on Thursday at 7:00
p.m. The primary election will be
held on Monday April 20. If neces-
sary, run-off elections will be held
on Thursday, April 23.

A petition was presented to the
EC calling for the placement of a
constitutional amendment on the bal-
lot. The amendment calls for sub-
stituting a one year’s suspension
from the University in lieu of ex-
pulsion wherever convictions arise
from honor trials.

Dean Kumpuris and Staman Ogil-
vie observed that the petition was
not presented in the form of an
amendment and could not be voted
on, as such. Markham remarked
that the intent of the petition was
clear and he felt that it was the EC’s
duty to draft the petition into a con-
stitutional amendment. This was
agreed upon and the amendment
will appear on the ballots,

Dave Bethea reported that the
faculty passed the Curriculum Com-
mittee’s proposal for an independent
exam program. He stated that Dean
Watt was soliciting suggestions from
the EC regarding details of the pro-
gram. A committee was appointed
to study a procedure for the pro-
gram which will go into effect next
fall.

Dean Kumpuris proposed that the
Dance Board President's salary be
reinstated. He stated that the ori-
ginal justification for the salary was
that it was a fair compensation for
the job.

The Executive Committee also
passed a motion urging candidates to
refrain from placing election posters
on trees.

EC-proposed amendments to the
constitution will also be balloted on
Monday and include the following:

1) one revising voting procedures
and adapting them to the new calen-
dar;

2) one renaming the Assimilation
Committee to the University Cen-
ter—Orieniation Committee and en-
trusting it with the functions its new
name implies:

3) one removing the EC's appel-
late powers over decisions of the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, April 8, 1970

A Commendable Action

The difficulty the Executive Committee had with the
petition to amend the constitution concerning the Honor
System was that the petitioners had not themselves supplied
the proper wording. Further, there was some debate on
whether the matter was in fact constitutional or merely pro-
cedural. The move was then to throw out the petition on tech-
nicalities. Fortunately, the motion was defeated and the issue
will be submitted to the students in next week’s election.

The amendment would, if passed, constitutionally limit
the EC to a one-year suspension penalty for conviction of an
honor violation. We don’t favor such a move, since this seems
the least viable of many possible alternatives to the present
penalty, and we hope those who agree with us will their
ballot accordingly next week.

In any case, however, EC action on the matter was com-
mendable. The decision that it could in fact be a constitu-
tional amendment was made because only in the constitution
can students limit the EC or invest it with power. Thus mere-
ly a procedural modification would be subject to the magna-
nimity of subsequent Executive Committees and would not
provide a student referendum which is one of the main pur-
poses of the present petition.

Although in general we think the EC should avoid inter-
preting intent, its decision to provide the petition with the
proper wordng is in this instance acceptable. In the first place,
the intent was clear, and the petitioners were acting on cred-
ible, though as it turned out, erroneous information. More
important, any delay in submitting the issue to the students
would have served further to obfuscate an already too emo-
tion-tinged debate. We assume rejection of the petition would
have postponed a vote until next year, when a minimal turn-
out, as would probably be the case in the fall elections, might
only distort the picture.

The value of the petition is that it will submit to the stu-
dents, upon whom the Honor System relies, the question of
the acceptability of the present penalty as opposed to an often
suggested alternative. It is unfortunate that the constitution
makes no provision for referendums, so the amendment is
the only way to pose the issue. The difficulty with the alter-
native of a one-year suspension is that it will likely lead to a
ranking of honor violations according to severity and will
finally render to the Honor System meaningless. What is
vitally needed is a thorough examination of the consistency
of the philosophies of Washington and Lee as an educational
institution and of the Honor System, with whatever adjust-
ments are necessary. Only in that way will the matter be re-
solved, and this petition formally opens the question to de-
bate for the first time in three years.

On the Matter of $250

Considering the general attitude toward the Dance Board
the past few years, many students may resent Dean Kum-
puris’ motion to the EC to reinstate the Dance Board presi-
dent’s yearly $250 salary.

The argument to retain the salary in the past has been
that while the elected student officials are accorded the pres-
tige of their offices, only the salary is offered as compensation
to the Dance Board president. Of course, since the Dance
Board vice-president, who always succeeds to the presidency,
will be elected in the future, such an argument seems to fail.

The position, however, is supportable on other grounds.
The first is a matter of philosophy. The EC has properly
realized this year that its powers in certain areas such as the
Publications Board are over-extended and ought to be re-
stricted. The most significant difference between the Dance
Board and the Publications Board is that the former does not
depend on a student tax for any part of its income and hence
student government intervention into its affairs is less justified
in principle.

Second, of course, is a matter of practicality. Since the
Dance Board is freely subscribed to, students may, if they
feel their money is being channeled into extraneous areas,
stop subscribing.

The question ts not, then, whether the Dance Board presi-
dent should receive a salary but whether anybody but the
Dance Board itself, and its subscribers through the choice
they are offered, should govern its affairs. We think not.

Take the Time

The elections Monday, in addition to narrowing the field
to two candidates for student body president and Dance
Board and IFC vice-presidents will include a constitutional
amendment the EC has proposed to allow elections to take
place in accordance with the new calendar on which W&L
will be operating next year

That amendment, along with the renaming and re-assign
ing the Assimilation Committee (to the University Center
Committee) and the one removing the EC’s power of review
over the Publications Board, is consonant with current feeling
on the matters involved and deserves the support of the entire
student body. The alternative, in the first case, is probably
chaos for next year's elections. For the others, passage means
the facilitating of operations for major aspects of student life
Considering the stakes involved, the price of the time to cast

1 ballot is small R. LI

Presidential Hopefuls Outline Plans

 

Richard Kampf. . .

Hoping not to be too brief in the

small space alloted to me here, |
shall summarize some of the most
important parts of my platform,

Curriculum: Firstly, | support an
independent exam schedule in which
the student is allowed to choose the
date and time at which he will take
and submit his examinations. The
plan recently submitted to the Exe-
cutive Committee is too vague and
a more definite plan in which the
student is given the responsibility to
plan his own exams is needed.

Secondly, a revocation is needed
of the new ruling concerning cuts,
so that the student not the teacher
should be the one who must make
the choices which will determine his
education. Rulings such as this gear-
ed with the immature student in
mind have been typical of the fac
ulty, and it is about time we started
making rules to suit the mature, re
sponsible student, or they just are
not going to come here.

I would also like to put an end
to such relatively worthless fresh-
man courses as three hundred years
of European History in one sem-
ester, and instead institute new
courses dealing with current prob-
lems which surely would be more
worthwhile.

Ae regards the honor system, I
am in favor of a revocation of the
absolute penalty, and the substitut-
ing of a penalty of expulsion for a
year in its place. This, of course,
requires an amendment to the EC
constitution which although difficult,
surely can be achieved.

Modification of the admissions
policy in which the admissions com-
mittee seems to be to sit back and
wait for the applications to pour in
and then wonders why it cannot
seem to recruit underprivileged or
minority group students (or for that
matter even top notch students of
any kind) is needed.

Recruiting of capable underprivi-
leged students could be in part done
by a group of students themselves
in the areas in which they live. If
we do not seek these students they
are not going to apply here. A stu-

s/Richard Kampf

Fran Lawrence...

A university community this size
can offer a unique opportunity for
a continuous exchange among its
most diverse members. It can allow
the individual a special sort of free-
dom, moving laterally in its various
social and educational groups, with-
out estrangement from a particular
group. This seems to me to be at the
root of the liberal college experi-
ence. This sort of university com-
munity has been realized at W&L
only in part.

Our size, our location, and our
basic educational philosophy pro-
mote this. But the mutually exclu-
sive terms of “The Hill,” “the
House,” “the Road,” and “the Coun-
try” indicate a kind of illmess that
prevents its meaningful application.
We are in many ways a splintered
commuter school.

Big schools, like cities, must neces-
sarily rely on caricature and labels
of its various social and educational
cliques to mobilize student affairs.
Caricatures and labels are absurd
at Washington and Lee, we must
realize the inaccuracy of their dis-
tortions. Instead of acting against
“psuedo-subversive” groups, we
should direct our energies toward
the solution of solvable problems

The center of our educational
lives should be the university and
education should be in a real way
our life here. The Student Center
has helped to bring new life to “the
Hill” for many. Its programs must
be expanded through this center,
guest lectures, and expanded student
productions. We must give Washing-
ton and Lee a sense of “the world.”
Ironically, the faculty is in the van-
guard of those widening the poten-
tial for a freer more creative col-

lege experience. We must both real-
ize the potential and indicate our
own need for complete student in-
volvement in the university com-
munity.

Fraternities must move on their
own to involve themselves in new di-
mensions, encouraging the college to
meet them in other kinds of inter-
course than that usually advocated.
The dying and the dead houses
should admit a “fait acompli” and
close down, freeing their members
to revitalize the college and them-
selves. It is time a more realistic
number of students were in fraterni-
ties.

Coeducation is essential. “Under-
standing” is a critical word in con-
temporary life and we cannot under-
stand each other through telepathy
from forty miles away. In a real
sense, women are an emerging soc-
ial group like the blacks and “separ-
ate but equal” a dated concept. I
suggest that planning to schedule

Joe Tompkins ...

As a candidate for a student gov-
ernment office in the past, I have
always attempted to let students
know my ideas and my viewpoint.
Even though unopposed in last year’s
election, I made it a point to inform
you where I stood. The goals |
have set for myself for next year, if
elected President, are numerous, so
that the points listed below are brief
summarizations at best.

STUDENT REPRESENTATION

-During the past year, | have come
to realize that there is a growing
number of students who feel that
their views and opinions are neither
represented nor appreciated by the
Excutive Committee. Due in part to
a lack of communication between
Executive Committee members and
the students, but also resulting from
some inherent characteristics of the
present student government system,
this feeling of alienation leads to a
lessening of the legitimacy of the
Executive Committee and to a feel-
ing of apathy and indifference. It
is sadly ironical that this is the situa-

tion at a small university such as
ours, where there should be a feel-
ing of community and the oppor-
tunity for participation in student
affairs. There is no instant solution
to the problem, but if elected, I
will be willing to do what is neces-
sary to insure that each student feels
that his viewpoint is being represent-
ed, whether it be the creation of an
additional governing body or a re-
structuring of the existing one.
HONOR SYSTEM—The absolute
penalty always becomes the focal
point of criticism of the Honor
System. However, I am not so sure
that it is the root of the problem of
declining support for the system.
To support an honor system, the stu-
dents it affects must have a clear
awareness of its procedures and a
strong belief in its fairness. To ac-
complish this, I will initiate a series
of discussions and newspaper ar-
ticles, in order to make students feel
closer to the Honor System and to
inform them of the alternatives to
our present system. Such a program
will allow the Honor System to be
viewed in its proper perspective and
then judged on its merits.
IMPROVED COMMUNICA-
TION — This includes informal
meetings of the President and/or
E. C. members with groups of stu-
dents, periodic visitation of frater-
nity houses by the President, better
distribution of E. C. minutes, an-
nouncement of the E. C. agenda
previous to each meeting, informing
students of conferences and sym-
posiums at other schools, and the
forming of ad hoe study groups dur-
ing the year to deal with specific
issues and involve more students.

IMPLIMENTATION OF RE-
CENTLY ESTABLISHED PRO-
GRAMS — Many new programs,

offering great opportunities for stu
dent participation, were established
this year. Having participated in the
discussion of these programs and
initiated some of them myself, I
will make sure that they are carried
out, both in letter and in spirit.
These programs include the Student
Planning and Developing Commit-
tee, the Underprivileged Applicant
Committee, the Admissions and Re-
cruitment Committee, and the Con-

ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVE-
MENT — The Executive Commit-
tee is sorely in need of a better sys-
tem of keeping records and compil-
ing E. C. resolutions and recom-
mendations. The yearly appoint-
ments made by the President and
the E. C. have grown to such prop-
ortions and the number of resolu
tions is such that an improved sys-
tem of record maintenance is
needed.

These are only some of the im-
portant issues to be dealt with next
year. The new curriculum, the de-
ferred rush system, and the exchange
program will offer both opportun:
ties and challenges. Indeed, next
year will be a crucial year for all

By Betty Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

In the April 4th issue of the
New Yorker there is a cartoon of
a doctor arriving to visit an obvious-
ly very ill man. The man’s wife ex-
plains his illness by saying “This is
the man who ate the steak that
came from the steer that nibbled the
grass that grew in the field where
roamed the cat that caught the bird
that ate the fish that fed on the bug
that floated around in the oil slick.”

There it is: the interrelationship of
all the problems of pollution in
water, earth and sky. Most of the
books which are being published so
fast these days deal with specific
areas of our environment and _ its
ills. Silent Spring by Rachel Carson
is the classic one, focusing on the
ecological effects of insecticides.
Others of the same kind are Perils
of the Peaceful Atom, Redoing
America, Destruction of California,
Water, The Unclean Sky and S/S/S
and the Sonic Boom (noise pollu-
tion). Just a month ago a follow-up
on Miss Carson's book appeared,
called Since Silent Spring by Frank
Graham, it tells of the immediate
reaction to the original book and
documents what has happened —
none of it good — since Miss Car-
son sounded the alarm seven years
ago.

There increasing

are emphases

Interlocking Pollution

on broader perspectives in such
books Science and Survival by Com-
moner, The Human Use of Human
Beings by Norbert Weiner (could
we be heading for a computer pol-
lution???) and Utopia or Oblivion
by Buckminster Fuller.

What to do? Can we reverse our
directions and our dependency on
affluent waste? The Earth Day
Teach-Ins in 3,000 high schools and
1,000 colleges testifies to the con-
cern of the young people. De Bell
has published a book for use by ac-
tivists for this day and into the fu-
ture called the Environmental Hand-
book. One way that has tremendous
appeal is just to get away—head for
the woods — (a cop-out?)! The sales
of such books as How to Stay Alive
in the Woods by Angier and Stalk-
ing the Wild Asparagus by Gibson
speaks for this enthusiasm.

One important method of arous-
ing interest and action is to show
what beauty there is in our world.
Rachel Carson’s A Sense of Won-
der carries this awareness of the
value of our vanishing natural
world. Best of all, though, in my
opinion is In Wildness is the Pre-
servation of Mankind with its ach-
ingly beautiful photographs by Eliot
Porter and quotes by Thoreau. It
carries the conviction that somehow
we must do what is necessary and
pay the price—which will not be
small.

Dance Board Candidates State Views

Tom Gillespie . . .

One major point of discussion
around Washington and Lee is the
need for a closer university com-
munity and if such an association is
to exist, it must necessarily be based
on understanding and tolerance. To
provide such a basis, open com-
munication will be necessary and my
campaign platform for vice-presi-
dent of the dance board is there-
fore my belief that an attempt must
be made to keep the student body in-
formed as to the workings of the
dance board.

Too many times in past years a
lack of understanding of dance
board operations has brought about
student body resentment toward the
dance board when concerts were not
as enjoyable as expected at the time
when dance plans were purchased.
I realize that such a response is in-
deed justifiable in some circum-
stances, but I feel that through co-

JoJo Martin...

The primary reason that I wish to
serve as Vice-President of the Dance
Board is because of my interest in
music and my desire to bring truly
good music to Washington and Lee
students.

I feel that our concerts should
try to appeal to the tastes of all of
our students. | have found a great
deal of discontent among our stu-
dents and I feel that this is due to
the lack of variety in our concerts.

Music has become such an integ-
ral part of the young people of to-
day that they demand to hear good
music and will settle for nothing
less. Thus, it is the responsibility of
the Dance Board to provide the best
in musical entertainment and _ this
can only be done by bringing top
recording artists to our campus.

It is time for a change in the
number and quality of concerts pre-
sented by the Washington and Lee

of four “big weekends” (excluding

generally mediocre entertainment.
The basis of this mediocrity arises
from the dubious financial manage-
ment of the Dance Board.

At present, the Dance Board sells
about 1000 dance plans at forty dol-
lars apiece in September. These
sales result in a meager operating
budget of about $40,000 that is initi-
ally destined to provide us with a
variety of popular groups for four
“big weekends.” Unfortunately, the
end result in May is a general dis-
enchantment with the Dance Board.

Under my tentative proposals we
would have a total of three one-
night “big weekends” plus Fancy
Dress. The concerts would be held

_ From The J-School. . .

  

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

The Senate rejection of Supreme
Court nominee G. Harrold Carswell
was not a conspiracy to keep a
southerner off the Supreme Court,
as President Nixon contends, but
rather a conspiracy to keep mediocre
justices off the Supreme Court.

While it might be true that a
handful of Senators—knee-jerk li-
berals they are called—would not
vote to confirm any conservative, it
is also true that if the President
should nominate a conservative with
the type of outstanding record that
a Supreme Court justice must have,
he would be confirmed with little
opposition. Carswell was simply not
that type of justice.

Four Southern Senators who vot-
ed for Clement Haynesworth—Mar-
low Cook of Kentucky, Albert Gore
of Tennessee, William Fulbright of
Arkansas, and William Spong of
Virginia—voted against Carswell;
not because they have any bias
against the South, but rather because
they could not support a mediocre
justice. These four, as well as many
other Senators, would vote to con-
firm a qualified candidate, no mat-
ter what section of the country he
might be from.

The President's reaction to defeat
was predictable, although puerile.

 

Nixon and Judge Carswell

on Saturday nights preceded Friday
by the usual combo parties and
cocktail parties. Under this plan we
would have one concert weekend
per semester.

With three concerts, each weekend
would initially be alloted an average
of about $12,000 in contrast to ap-
proximately $4500 per concert at

A curtain of disillusionment and
pessimism drapes the W&L student
body when ever one mentions the

Board, One main job of the Vice-

In an obvious political move, de-
signed to further his “Southern
Strategy,” Nixon accused the Senate
of being prejudiced against the
South.

He really had no one to blame
but himself and Attorney General
John Mitchell. In their all out de-
sire to enforce law and order, Nixon
and Mitchell have not only come
up with two bum nominations, but
have also strained relations with the
Senate almost to the breaking point.

Nixon’s accusation of Senate bias
brought immediate and angry reply
from several Senators in both par-
ties.

Senator Cook, a floor leader in
the fight to confirm Haynesworth,
blamed the Attorney General for
that defeat, saying that Mitchell had
antagonized so many Senators that
it was impossible to win confirma-
tion.

Senator Margaret Chase Smith of
Maine was incensed when Presi-
dential Aide Bryce Harlow told
Senator Cook that she had decided
to vote for Carswell. This outright
lie was supposed to influence Sena-
tor Cook to vote for Carswell, but
it only succeeded in assuring a dis-
senting vote by Senator Smith. This
was not the first time the Admini-
stration stooped to deceit.

President has, therefore, is to restore
the optimism, enthusiasm, and anti-
cipation which permeated the atmos-
phere of the campus, student-body,
last year the week before Spring’s
Weekend. This optimism can be
achieved in several ways:

Ist: the V.P. of the Dance Board
must work closely and more effici-
ently with the Dance Board Presi-
dent in an attempt to diversify the
types of music presented consistent
with the desires of the student body,
and, at the same time, we must
strive to sign NAME groups, not
HAS BEENS.

2nd: the V.P. of the Dance Board
must make his presence felt among
the student body, that is to say,
more of a consensus on the type of
music that should be presented must
be achieved if the success of the
Dance Board is to continue while
satisfying the desires of the students.

3rd; the V.P. of the Dance Board
must offer some new concepts con-
cerning the format of concerts to

Series Split With 0.D.U.

Washington and Lee dropped their
fifth straight game, losing to Vir-
ginia, 13-4, but split a doubleheader
with Old Dominion Saturday to
bring their record to 4-6. The Gen
erals won the first game, 4-0, and
lost the nightcap, 6-3.

Against ODU, Scott MeChrystal
broke open a scoreless battle in the
first game’s sixth inning with a two
run shot over the right centerfield
fence. The Generals scored twice
more in the seventh on Bruce King’s
double and Rat Coates’ pinch single.

Bill Miller toiled four innings, al
lowing only four hits to gain the
victory. King worked three scoreless
innings, fanning three and surrender-
ing one hit.

The Monarchs cut off a last-inn
ing rally to preserve a 6-3 win in
the afterpie. Boots Daugherty al-
lowed only six hits and struck out

seven in his route-going perform-
ance. Freshman Bill French was tag-
ged for the loss.

Old Dominion led 2-1 into the
bottom of the fourth and added
three more off French and Bruce
King. Don McMillan put a close to
that rally, but the Monarchs picked
up a final run in the fifth off Tim
Haley. Bill Greener worked the
sixth inning without further trouble.

Earlier Tuesday, Virginia scored
six big runs in the fifth inning en
route to a 13-4 romp of the Gen-
erals. The Cavaliers put together
four hits, two walks and a hit bats-
man to produce the explosition.
Bruce King, in relief of starter Bill
French, was the loser. Virginia add-
ed four more runs in the seventh,
including catcher Sammy Beale’s
three run homer.

Golfers Perfect, 1-0, So Far

The Washington and Lee golf
team hasn’t had a match in almost a
month, but you won't find the mem-
bers of the team complaining for
they’re enjoying a perfect season.
Of course, there’s only been one
match so far, but W&L won it in
such a convincing manner that
talk of the rest of the season being
perfect should not fall in the cate-
gory of idle conversation.

Coach Cy Twombly has had to
rebuild his team this year for he lost
three out of his first six players
from last year’s starting team. The
69 team was 6-3 and finisher third
in the C.A.C. tournament at the end
of the year. With half that team
now gone, Coach Twombly could
have felt that the long winning tradi-
tion that the golf team has estab-
lished would be threatened. This
doesn’t seem to be the case, how-
ever. Freshmen Jack Marquess and
Brandon Herbert have broken into
the starting lineup and the Coach
feels that the team is even stronger
than last year’s. Returning letter-
men Ken Carter, Dick Singletary,
and Bill Martin form a strong nu-
cleus and Sophomore Bob Story has
also broken into the starting six.

The one and only match so far
this year was against Bucknell on
March 26. W&L was the home team
in a match that was played on the
Upper Cascades course at the Home-
stead. All of W&L’s home matches
will be played at the Homestead this
year because Lexington’s Tri-Brook
course is being expanded to eighteen
holes and the construction makes it
impossible to have matches there

‘Tennis Generals Up |

Court Record to 3-1

By Tom Gage

Coach Verne Canfield’s success-
ful tennis machine is having quite
a season again this year even though
it was squashed by a steamroller in
one of its matches. The team, getting
excellent efforts from all the players,
has compiled a 3-1 record against
pretty tough competition. Akron
University fell to the Generals be-
fore vacation as the Generals sent
them back to Ohio with an 8-1 loss
on their hands and undoubtedly
wishing that they had never dared
to venture into the valley.

Last week’s competition was to
provide the Generals with a true
test of their quality, and by Sunday
Coach Canfield could not have been
too disappointed. His team had
mauled William and Mary 7-2,
squeaked by Hampden-Sydney 5-4,
but had also fallen to renegade
headhunters in Duke uniforms by
the score 8-love. Throughout the
four matches Jeff Driscoll had play-
ed particularly well and captain
Tom McJunkin hadn't been defeated
in a singles match yet.

Not much good can be said about
the Duke match. Bill Gatlin came
the closest to winning a_ singles

match but ended up losing 6-8, 3-6.
Gatlin and Jeff Driscoll put up the
best doubles fight but also lost, this
time by a 4-6, 4-6 margin.

The story’s been different in the
other three matches though. Tom
McJunkin hasn’t let an opponent
come closer than a 6-3 score yet
and also has teamed with Rick Arm-
strong to win doubles matches
against Akron and Hampden-Syd-
ney. But probably the biggest lift
this year has come from the fresh-
man ranks. Coach Canfield had
high hopes at the beginning of the
season for the likes of Marshall
Washburn, Stan Taylor and Taylor
Cooksie, and they haven't let him
down. Aside from Duke match all
foes have fallen before Washburn in
singles and the combination of Tay-
lor-Cooksie has throttled both
William and Mary and Akron op-
ponents in doubles.

Last year’s 8-5 record seems to be
in peril of being improved upon.
Virginia Commonwealth provides
the tennis Generals with their next
opposition as they continue on their
hopefully merry way to a fourth
straight CAC championship. Coach
Canfield does seem to like those
bells.

Cindermen Beat Roanoke

By Dave Torrance

The track team has done an ad-
mirable job so far. They've had two
meets, winning one with Roanoke
College, last year’s state champions,
and losing one to Wake Forest.

In the Roanoke meet, Gary Ent-
sminger won the quarter mile in
§2.5 seconds, not a bad time con-
sidering the team had just returned
from Spring Vacation. Gary also
won the 220. Although Neer hadn't
had much opportunity to practice
the high jump, he defeated Roa-
noke in this event. Bob Carrere won
the javelin throw in only one shot.
His distance was 178 feet. Chris
Friend won the discus throw.

After defeating Roanoke by a
score of 73-72, the Generals went
to Salem, North Carolina to take
on Wake Forest. Although we lost
by a score of 99-46, we distinguish-
ed ourselves in many events, especi-
ally in the field ones. With Mike
Neer unable to participate in the
meet, we were defeated in most of
the running events. However, we
compiled just as many points in field
events as the North Carolina team.

1970 Lacrosse Schedule: April 18,
Baltimore, home; 21, Roanoke,
away; 25, Washington College,
home: 30, Baltimore Loyola, away.

May 2, North Carolina, home; 9,
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County, home; 13, Virginia, home.

Dave Stone jumped 6.1 feet in the
high jump, while Bill Kahn finished
second in the broad jump, with a
fine jump of 21 feet 11/4 inches.
Scotty Scott tied for first in the
pole vault competition, and Paul
Suthern won the high hurdles, our
only running victory. Despite Keith
Shaner’s great time of 202.8 seconds
in the 880, he only finished third.
He also clocked 53 seconds in the
mile relay. Bob Sherwood looked
good in distance running for both
meets.

rhis Thursday, April 14, the team
will play Bridgewater, whom we
haven't beaten in six years, al-
though we came close last year,
losing only by three points. This
year we have a fighting chance to
break the six year jinx.

Nixon’s Demise

With Carswell

(Continued from Page 3)

And the early morning
calls of Martha Mitchell to the Af
kansas Gazette certainly did not en
hance the Attorney General’s popu
larity on Capitol Hill.

Actually Nixon got off to a good
start in Supreme Court nominations
with the choice of Warren Burger as
Chief Justice. Burger was recogniz
ed as a strict constructionist, but
confirmed by the Senate with only
two dissenting votes because he ts a
justice of the highest calibre.

After the defeat of ¢ arswell,
President Nixon should have resols
ed to find a nominee like Burger.
Instead he chose to drive a wedge
between North and South.

It is becoming increasingly ap
parent that the man who said he
was going to bring us together has
done more to pull us apart than
anyone since Joe McCarthy.

Holton Considers Youth, Dissent
In Speech at ODK Convocation

Governor Linwood Holton, W&L
alumnus, returned to his alma mater
yesterday to address the annual
Omicron Delta Kappa Convocation.
In a 15 minute address, Governor
Holton concerned himself with the
problems of youth, the past as rele-
vant to the present and future, and
the difficulties posed by violent pro-
test and dissent

“The past is always relevant to
the future and the present,” Holton
reminded his audience, warning
them that “as Santanya said, “Those
who forget the mistakes of the past
are condemned to repeat them.’ ”

furning to the area of protest,
the governor denounced protest for
its own sake, but classed as benefi-
cial and even essential what he term-
ed “protest for a cause.” However,
he warned that mere dissent is not

enough, pointing out that “we all
know that there are problems, we
can usually identify these problems

But solving these problems requires
affirmative, positive leadership.”

fhe governor told his listeners
that such leadership would have to
come from them and their genera-
tion, and “particularly from the
members of Omicron Delta Kappa.”

Closing his speech, the governor
called for a re-evaluation of the cur-
rent scene, and the utilization of
what he called the “politics of pur-
pose, not merely of protest.”

Holion’s address, which received
a standing ovation from the students
gathered in Lee Chapel, was made
at the occasion of the ODK Tapping
Day ceremony, the 52nd since the
national leadership fraternity was
founded here at WAL in 1918.

operation and a willingness on the
dance board's part to listen to stu-
dent body wishes, this sort of anta-

gonism can be stopped.

I can not say what groups will
be playing next year and | would be
foolish to try to predict such a thing
but I do know that if the members
of the dance board make themselves
aware of student body preferences,
next year’s concerts will be enjoy-
able to the majority of the students
and that the dance board's actions
will be known so that the aura of
secrecy will be gone.

for my petition, several people ex-
pressed their ideas for future con-
cert format. One such suggestion
dealt with the possibility of a pop
festival type concert in a field in-
stead of in a cramped gym. An-
other suggestion dealt with the pos-
sibility of a joint concert weekend
with a girl's school. Both of these
might be enjoyable changes and
perhaps such weekends can be plan-
ned. This type of communication
can bring about the realization of
student body desires and should be
encouraged,

As an elected representative of
the student body, the vice-president
must be receptive and enthusiastic
towards worthwhile changes and
this will be my concern if elected.
The gap between the student body
and the dance board must be closed
and next year’s problems must be
solved to the majority’s satisfaction
or university weekends will lose their
outstanding position at Washington
and Lee.

present, Obviously, with an average
of $7,000 more per concert the
quality of the entertainment would
vastly improve. Also there would
still be about $4,000 for the Fancy
Dress ball which would also be
held during the second semester. In
addition, more popular groups
would help pay for themselves since
more “at the door” tickets would be
purchased by those desiring to see
“big name” groups instead of medio-
cre entertainers. The “at the door”
profits would provide funds which
could be applied toward subsequent
concerts,

The price of dance plans would
still be $40, unless the administra-
tion could be convinced to subsidize
the Dance Board’s activities. “At the
door” tickets would remain at $10
and dance plans would remain non-
transferable. In addition, the student
body would be polled to determine
its entertainment preferences.

Under these tentative proposals
the Dance Board would no longer
be the anathema of the school, but
a proviedr of quality entertainers.
Once again concerts could bring en-
joyment to our campus instead of
two days of disappointment.

I would like to see more jazz and
blues concerts, along with the best
of the current rock groups and indi-
vidual folk artists. | also encourage
holding open air and free campus
concerts,

WAL students have shown a
great deal of musical talent and |
feel that such talent has a place and
should appear, where possible, in
the Dance Board concerts. I feel that
my personal knowledge and taste for
a great variety of music would en-
able me to appeal successfully to
those varied tastes of the student
body.

Different types of music demand
different atmospheres in which to be
performed, Therefore, | would like
tO see concerts where people would
be able to dance, where they could
drink, and outdoor concerts. The
Dance Board is an institution of the
students and if students, as I have
found, become discontented with the
performance of the Board then
some kind of change is necessary. I
would like to instigate such a change
primarily in the type and quality of
our concerts,

petence, and professionalism on one

That Dreams should be compared
to BS&T is not unusual considering
that trumpeter Randy Brecker is a
refugee of the original Blood, Sweat,
and Tears. Randy was featured on
the group’s first album “Child is
Father to the Man,” before he left.
Another familiar face will be that
of bass-player Doug Lubahn who
has played with the Doors and was
leader of the now defunct Clear

James Brown, Martha and the Van-

Honor System Reforms,

Coeducation, Community
(Continued from Page 2)

on our football program in the com-

ing years is the only possible alter-

native to co-education.

Robespierre is a classic study in
the inabiilty to cut out a cancerous
growth from an otherwise pure
body. His premise was wrong and
his scalpel terrifying. Yet the
Honor System's absolute penalty
seems to attempt just this. The es-
sence of being a community and a
part of the idea of honor must be a
concern of humanity. It is inhuman
to punish absolutely and irrevocably
for an offense that only in the most
primitive mind implies a thorough-
going lack of honor.

The Executive Committee's Honor
Hearing itself can be an excellent
means of determining violations
when its members strive constantly
to understand the feelings of the
university community and the parti-
cular individual relationship to the
idea of honor. But the only penalty
currently available to the Committee
corrupts the workings of the code,
the code itself, and the university
community. We can and must have
an Honor System that works and yet
promotes a sense of permanent
membership in the community. We
must allow people to rehabilitate
themselves.

avoid the dullness of routine-——one
of the causes of the existent dissatis-

Last: the V.P. of the Dance
Board is in charge of co-ordinating
the advisory council — a group of
sophomores and juniors represent-
ing the fraternities and non-frater-
nity men. If a consensus is to be a-
chieved, this entity must function
efficiently.

Thus, the V.P. of the Dance
Board assumes an important posi-
tion because his success or failure at
achieving an optimistic atmosphere
among the student body could very
well determine the success or ulti-
mate destruction of the Dance
Board in the years ahead.

his way—one rim-shot from Cob-
ham can say more than the entire
output of a Ginger Baker.”

That this talented new group has
yet to release an album is no acci-
dent. Their managers have refused
to let them cut one until they have
completed a wide circuit of con-
certs, thus assuring an instant hit.

Dreams will open their concert in
Doremus Friday night at 8:15. Sat-

noon with the University Cocktail

Majors Week
Now Scheduled
For April 27-30

Majors Week, initially scheduled
for this week, has been rescheduled
to take place next week, April 27-30.
The student-faculty series will consist
of discussions lead by each of the
department heads or representatives
and students majoring in their respec-
tive departments.

Sponsored by the Assimilation
Committee, the purpose of the series
is to assist students in deciding on his
major and, secondly, to discuss the
requirements for degrees and specific
majors under the new catalogue.

Monday, April 27, Dr. DeVogt
and Dr. Griffith will lead discussion
on Commerce and Economics. An-
cient Languages will be handled by
Prof. Taylor. Taking charge of Bio-
logy will be Prof. Roberts. The Ger-
man department representative will
be Dean Pusey. Prof. Kimbrough
plans to discuss questions concerning
Sociology.

Four majors will be presented on
Tuesday. Dr. Pollard will discuss En-
gineering and Dr. Duvall will discuss
English. Moger will direct History
and Dr. Spencer will do the same for
Geology.

Prof. Wise will represent the Chem-
istry department. Prof. Riegel is go-
ing to discuss Journalism and Dr.
Felix Welch will discuss Math. De-
partment head William Buchanan
will answer questions about Political
Science. Prof. Hinton will speak in
behalf of Psychology.

The final day of discussion will be
Thursday April 30. Prof. Junkin will
lead discussion about Fine Arts. Pem-
berton will perform the same func-
tion for the Philosophy department.
Dr. Turner and Dr. Sprunt will ex-
plain Physics and Religion majors.
faking on the job of spokesman for
the Romance Languages will be Dr.
Francis Drake.

All discussions will be held at 7:30
p.m. in the University Center; speci-
fic room assignments will be posted
at the University Center Office (di-
rectly inside the main door)

The new curriculum has caused
substantial changes to be made in
the requirements for a major in
every department. Different depart-

ments will have different require-
ments for short term work also
The degree requirements and the

short term proposals will be discuss-
ed fully for the first time

 

Andrew Wyndham with a vote of
302 to 251. There will be a run-off
between Bob LaRue and Rob Minor
for Vice-President, Bob Goehring
having been eliminated from the
race.

The floor was also open for nomi-
nations for the other officers of the
IFC. Bill Greenhut was nominated
for Secretary. Andrew Wyndham
and Bob Woodward were nomi-
nated for Senior Justices. Junior
Justice nominees were Kenny Mu-

rov, Tim Chriss, Joe Blake, and
Mack Woodward. The offices of
Treasurer, Rush Chairman, Rush

Book Editor, and Social Chairman
were left without nominees. Nomi-
nations will again be open next
week,

Waugh Crigler, President of the
Senior Class, attended the meeting
to discuss with the IFC the pos-
sibility of having a combo party
sponsored jointly by the IFC and the
Senior Class. The class has planned
a cocktail party for the afternoon of
June 2, and has a surplus of around
$550. Crigler asked the IFC to con-
sider a $35 per house assessment in
order to pay for a combo that night.
Crigler mentioned the possibility of
having the Kalabash Corporation
for the cocktail party and the Em-
bers for the combo.

In the Vice-Presidenial race. La-
Rue had been high man with a total
of 264 votes. Well behind, Minor
polled 176 votes to beat out Goeh-
ring for the other run-off berth.
Goehring received 156 votes.

The final election will be held to-
morrow along with the EC elections
and the Dance Board Vice-Presi-
dency. Only active fraternity mem-
bers will be allowed to vote in the
IFC election, although non-frater-
nity men will be able to vote in all
of the other elections.

Matt Cole, a junior from New-
nan, Ga., was elected chairman of

next year's Contact program Sunday

night.

Cole, who is now-co-editor of the
Calyx, was elected by a joint Exe
cutive Committee - Interfraternity
Council committee. He has begun
planning next year's program, which
is tentatively set for March 8-12.

The topic for next year’s program
of speeches and panel
will center on “the changing role of
higher education, and Washington
and Lee's place in it,” Cole said

discussions

“The program will be designed so
that Washington and Lee can take
a look at itself,” he added

Cole said the program will deal
with three facets of the topic:

“There will definitely be some
thing on the uniqueness of the small
college and the problems it faces

“There will also be a panel of
speakers who will relate education
to business and government.” They
will deal with such questions as how
education can help business in re
search and what business and gov
ernment want out of the graduating
college student

The final part of the program will

deal with the value of education
Questions that will be considered
here will include “Are we on the

right track in education?” and “Do
people gain more knowledge from
lectures or from an exchange of
ideas?”

Cole said no definite arrangements
for speakers have been made yet, al

REVIEW and OUTLOOK President, Secretary Hopefuls Eye Election

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, April 22, 1970

Vote

Considering the issues, the expanded number of positions
to be voted on, and the constitutional amendments, the turn-
out in Monday’s election was a disappointing one. From last
year’s nearly 1100 total ballots, cast at a time when the issues
and candidates weren’t as many, the total fell to 886 on

Monday.

It is unfortunate that the amendments, especially the one
concerning the honor system, drew so few people to the polls.
It is especially distressing since the results of the balloting
may not be from a large enough cross-section to indicate the
extent of any real difference of attitude on any of the matters,
and those votes cannot be resubmitted to the student body in
the general election.

But the election tomorrow will decide student body presi-
dent and secretary and Dance Board and IFC vice-president,
and each of those positions, but particularly the first two, war-
rant the considered vote of a much larger proportion of
W&L’s students than voted in the primary election.

This is the first year Dance Board and IFC officers have
been popularly elected. The rationale was that giving the
elected officers a broader base from which to operate would
vitalize offices that have in recent years suffered from a lack
of creativity. Particularly fraternities, it was felt, would wish to
elect IFC officials directly in order to allow them to speak
with more force in the difficult times nearly all fraternities are
finding themselves in. And we have always heard complaints
that the Dance Board is insensitive to student opinion. It
would seem then that a popular election of the key Dance
Board officer would be the best solution. Thus we are sur-
prised that the turnout was so slight .

Yet probably despair is a better word to describe our re-
action to the fact that even election of student body officers
could not draw more than a meager showing at the polls. The
EC has accomplished a great deal in the last two years. But
many of the programs are yet to be implemented, and cer-
tainly much remains to be done.

Therefore it is imperative that the new student body of.-
ficers be elected by a truly representative and substantial por-
tion of the student body, not merely by those for whom the
polls are convenient. The officers next year will need the legi-
timacy, in their relationship both with the faculty and admini-
stration and with their fellow students, that only a large turn-
out will give them.

R. L. B.

A Striking Omission

The President's latest speech gave most advocates of with-
drawal from Vietnam some reason for optimism despite con-
tinued disagreement over timetables and goals.

His announcement of the withdrawal of another 150,000
troops by next spring, as several have noted, is not really a
radical escalation of the present monthly withdrawal rate but
merely sounds impressive because it is projected over a longer
period. While this is true, one can be modestly encouraged by
Mr. Nixon’s willingness to fix himself to a longer-range time-
table than had previously been deemed advisable to adopt,
even if one remains dissatisfied with the basic approach or rate
of withdrawal.

Probably more distasteful to many was the chauvinistic
appeal with which the President ended his speech. We noticed
the primary reason offered for our continued presence was
the wish to avoid “humiliation and defeat” for the U.S. To
many who still retain the faith that America has been com-
mitted to higher goals, the President's attempt to apologize
for our intervention through an emotional appeal merely to
national pride must have been frustrating.

Yet the most discouraging aspect was not what the Presi-
dent said, but what he did not say. Despite the release of in-
formation about our involvement, apparently increasing, in
Laos, Mr. Nixon avoided the issues of our commitment and
what business we have there.

And if we may dream an all-too-obvious analogy, the
questions to be raised are those many wish they had asked at
the beginning of the Vietnamese conflict. Those questions
deserve an immediate answer.

There is a too-general acceptance of the government's
capacity to shield from the American public, and even from
its elected officials, information it feels the people for their
own good shouldn't know. But that is diametrically opposed
to principles our leaders publicly espouse and a dangerous
course of action in more practical terms. It was just this credi-
bility gap that played a major role in President Johnson's
fall from power, and Mr. Nixon, unless he begins to tell the
entire truth about U.S. involvement in Laos and Cambodia
and to submit that presence to public scrutiny, may fall vic
tim to the same problem

But we are less concerned about Mr. Nixon's political
future than we are about the dangers in conducting foreign
policy by internal machinations of an insensitive bureaucracy.
That OV ernment secrecy m the long run may he a more im
portant issue than the war which presently commands so

much of our attention

R.L.

By Steve Ory

Two candidates won election to
office and eight other contestants
made the run-offs in last Monday’s
elections. Phil Thompson, unoppos-
ed candidate for vice president, and
Doug Gossmann, who defeated An-
drew Wyndham for the Interfrater-
nity Council presidency, won their
elections outright.

Fran Lawrence led Joe Tompkins
421 votes to 373 votes in the race
for student body president. Richard
Kampf was eliminated with 51 votes.

Lawrence, a former member of
the EC, ran on a platform emphasiz-
ing a more university-centered com-
munity and liberalized honor sys-
tem reforms. He stated, “The uni-
versity community has not been
completely realized because it has
not been promoted. This year’s Exe-
cutive Committee and the improve-
ment of the university's Own capa-
cities have started the job that must
be continued next year.”

Lawrence said that he felt that
the student body registered discon-
tent with the present honor system
through their electoral support of
the fourth amendment Monday.

The amendment provided for a
one year suspension for honor viola-
tions; and although it failed to get
the necessary student body plurality
for passage, the measure was favor-
ed 461 to 343.

Commenting on the substance of
the honor system revision, Lawrence
said, “We must help the university
realize and appreciate the present
system, yet at the same time empha-
size that the code itself is of lasting
importance, not procedures and
penalties.

“I would encourage a vote on the
penalty revision at the earliest ap-
propriate time next year.”

Joe Tompkins, current student
body vice-president, has set two
priorities in the event of his election
as president of the student body. He
proposed the instigation of a “twen-
ty-five to forty man student senate
to serve in a provisional capacity
which could be made permanent if
the experiment proves satisfactory
next year.”

Tompkins hopes that such an or-
ganization could serve to involve
students in the functions of the stu-
dent government.

The second priority is to “re-evalu-
ate the honor system.” Tompkins
stated that he felt that his role was
to “educate and stimulate students
regarding the honor system and
then let the students decide for
themselves, rather than seek a par-
ticular reform myself.”

“This year,” Tompkins said, “we
passed many beneficial reforms—we
need to preserve these and to seek
others next year.”

Tompkins remarked that he was
disappointed by Monday’s turnout
and he hopes that more people vote
on Thursday.

Bruce Madison and Rich Murray
both received 293 votes in Monday’s
election for secretary of the student
body. Eddie Haslam was eliminated
from the race with 194 votes.

Madison sees the need to evoke
greater student concern as the major
problem facing the school.

He proposes to establish periodic
meetings betewen various groups of
students and representatives to ex-
change ideas: “having 1400 minds
working together rather than

twelve.” Madison has not taken de-
finite stands on particular issues but
would prefer to act in a more rep-
resentative capacity and make deci-
sions regarding coeducation, the
honor system, and other controver-
sial issues after he gains a more
complete perspective of the student
body’s sentiments.

“These problems have deep roots
and they demand more than hasty
personal views.”

As part of his program to gener-
ate greater student involvement,
Madison would try to promote great-
er student inclusion on committees
and university policy decision.

Rich Murray observes that W&L
students have gained much in the
last three years, but he fears that
sudents have become apathetic
about these gains.

This apathy, he maintains, was
evident in the Jack of candidates for
Fancy Dress President and the lack
of competition in the vice presi-
dency race. He fears that such an
attitude could be used as a justifica-
tion to deny future reforms by the

“Watermelon Man”: New

Comedy With Potential

By Cy Dillon

The suburban situation comedy,
whether in motion pictures or tele-
vision, has usually aimed at little
more than mild entertainment, and,
if recent offerings are any indication,
it usually achieves less. Mr. Van
Peebles’ “Watermelon Man” —
though the settings, acting, and
snappy lines would not be out of
place on the Dick Van Dyke tele-
vision show has aims that suggest
more the true potential of comedy.
“Watermelon Man” is able to a-
chieve those aims to a degree that
makes it both entertaining and eye-
opening.

Godfrey Cambridge comes across
well as the victim of a white-black
metamorphosis; he is a good hand
with a good line. The pace keeps the
comedy going, and “Water.
melon Man” from the boredom that
a situation followed through for two

saves

hours has the potential to produce.
The dialogue is smooth and surpris-
ingly funny.

Oddly enough, the
quips are the ones that suggest that
more is going on than the dialogue
can handle. The idea, the situation
behind the lines does not escape the
viewer's mind for a second. The
anomaly of the language —- what ts
being said as opposed to what is

best of the

happening—brings the right amount
of tension into the movie. Attempts
at other styles of language seem

weak.

The plot of “Watermelon Man”
handles the problem of identity in a
way and a style that can reach sub-
urbanites concerned with _ their
neighborhood property values as
well as college students.

If you did not see “Watermelon
Man” during the film symposium, it
is worth planning to watch. It should
be quite popular.

faculty.

Noting several solutions to. stu-
dent apathy, Murray feels that stu-
dent groups should be in closer con-
tact with the EC. He commented
that many organizations have be-
come too autonomous and could be
coordinated with others to promote
more student participation.

On the honor system, Murray
states, “I’m all for giving the guy a
second chance.”

However, he feels that the one
year suspension penalty may not be
the best answer and all alternatives
should be studied thoroughly,

Agreeing with the other candi-
dates, Rich Murray urges everyone
to “get out and vote Thursday.”

Repairs have been recently initiated on the Alexander-Withrow house,
one of the oldest structures remaining in Lexington,

One Of City’s Oldest
Houses Gets New Face

By Monty Cottier

Students on their way to the Col-
lege Inn can hardly have failed to
notice the scaffolding and walkways
around the old building on the cor-
ner housing the Family Shoe Store.
What may not have occurred to
them (those who stopped to worry
about it) is that the building, which
is known officially as the Alexander-
Withrow House and which has been
purchased by the Historic Lexington
Foundation for restoration, is one
of the oldest buildings in Lexing-
ton, having been constructed in
1793.

The property was purchased from
the estates of Misses Margaret and
Lucy Withrow at a cost of around
$18,000, The architectural firm of
Johnson, Craven, and Gibson, which
did restoration work on such sites as
Jefferson's Monticello and Madi-
son's Ashlawn, has been contracted
to work on the Withrow House, un-
der the direction of Mr. Thomas W.
S. Craven

One of the few houses to survive
the fire which almost completely de-
stroyed Lexington in 1796, the Alex-
ander-Withrow House, originally «
two-storied structure, had the bot-
tom store level added when the
streets in the Main and Washington
streets areas were lowered in 1850.
This was done by adding cut stone
underpinning and a back wall, which
is the side wall for the gift shop
adjoining the house.

The first stage of repairs, currently
underway, consists of work on the
roof of the house, the exterior brick-

Re: Books...

  

By Betty Munger

Manager of the W&L Bookstore

It is certainly tempting to air
One’s Opinions when one has access
to public print. So this week I in-
tend to yield to such a temptation
on the subject of the current en-
thusiasm for pollution problems.

One thing that bothers me is the
“bandwagon” aspect of the survival
cause. To quote Robert Heilbroner
in the April 23rd issue of the “New
York Review of Books”: “In short,
the ecological issue has assumed the
dimensions of a vast popular fad,
for which one can predict with rea-
sonable assurance the trajectory of
all such fads — a period of intense
general involvement, followed by
growing boredom and gradual ex-
tinction, save for a die-hard remnant
of the faithful.” It is going to be all
too easy to soothe our consciences
with some mornings’ hard work on
the litter around our community.

Such tokenism can have little
role in the mounting crisis of the
ecological balance on the “Space-
ship Earth”. We must be prepared
to give far more time, money, and
above all, conviction for the wide-
spread, long-range planning and

work (which has been noted in num- changes in our very way of life.

erous architectural publications be-
cause of the unusual latticework
construction), and the woodwork.
Money for the project was ob-
tained, in large part, by holding
tours of the various historical sites
in and around Lexington, such as
Dean Light’s home, where Lee lived
until 1868, Hickory Hill, where
Cyrus McCormick's nephew lived,
and Stone Houses which was built
in 1793 and is now owned by Mr.
and Mrs. Matthew Paxton, Jr.

According to Mrs. Marguerite
Old, publicity director for the His-
toric Lexington Foundation, the
group intends to finish the three-
stage restoration plan on the With-
row House and then move to other
historic buildings in the Lexington
area. Among those listed on the Ad-
visory Board for the foundation are
former governor of Texas, Price
Daniel, Fowler McCormick of Chic-
ago, and Senator Willis Robertson.

The evidence is increasingly clear.
The impetus for these changes will
have to come through major shifts
in our cultural values and life-styles.
Survival will call for a conservation-
ist economy. Business interests will
have to become subordinate to eco-
logical necessities. Education, in-
cluding especially the mass media,
must be responsive to, and respon-
sible to, the environmental impera-
tive. Material possessions in our
highly developed society must be-
come secondary to the simple needs
for food, water and air.

To quote Dr. Heilbroner again:
“Can we really persuade the Wes-
tern world, who are just now enter-
ing the heady atmosphere of a high
consumption way of life, that con-
servation, stability, frugality, and a
deep concern for the distant future
must now take priority over the
personal indulgence for which they
have been culturally prepared and

“Mitchell Should Go’

 

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

After the Supreme Court nomina-
tion of G. Harrold Carswell was
rejected by the Senate, one nation-
ally syndicated columnist blamed
the Administration’s defeat on At-
torney General John Mitchell, say-
ing “The Attorney General has been
pitching like Charlie Brown and his
wife has been fielding like Snoopy.
They should both be traded to Mil-
waukee for some bullpen help. The
President needs relief.”

James Reston? Tom Wicker? or
some other outraged liberal? No,
this was written by James J. Kil-
patrick, the ultra-conservative col-
umnist for the Washington Star. The
fact is almost everybody, liberals
and conservatives, would like to see
Nixon replace his Attorney General.
Liberals do not like Mitchell’s law
and order politics, and conservatives

blame him for Administration de-
feats.
Time and Newsweek both ran

cover stories on the Carswell defeat,
laying most of the blame on Mit-
chell, and Life, a magazine that sup-
ported Nixon’s candidacy two years
ago, printed an editorial entitled
“Mitchell Should Go.”

As the strong man in the Cabinet,
Mitchell has become the President's
chief advisor in domestic affairs,
and his advice has been almost uni-
versally bad. With all the qualified
judges to choose from, Mitchell re-
commended Carswell, hardly a
choice to inspire confidence in the
Attorney General. Even Kilpatrick,
a Carswell supporter, said “our man,
to put it bluntly, was simply not all
that hot.”

In fact, both rejected Supreme
Court nominees, Carswell and Cle-
ment Haynesworth, were recom-
mended to Nixon by Mitchell, a less
than encouraging track record for
the Attorney General. Time says
“The President could have come up
with acceptable nominees if he had
not relied so completely upon —
and been served so poorly by —
Mitchell.”

The real problem with Mitchell
is that he does not understand the
game of politics as it is played in
Washington, D.C. By necessity,
Cabinet members must retain close

tion to protect against a pending re-
volt from the Reagan-right. The
plan was that each state chairman
would be told that whenever Gen-
eral Eisenhower's name was men-
tioned, all the delegates were to go
scream bloody murder in honor of
our then-ill ex-president. Unbe-
knownst to anyone outside of this
clandestine meeting, the chairman
of the rules committee would work
Eisenhower’s name into his report
to the convention, at which point
the delegates would go bananas, the
rules chairman would mumble the
remainder of his report, including
the rule change, into the micro-
phone, Saunders would get up, call
for the yeas and nays, and the rule
would pass before anybody could
blink.

All of the above was reported by
Horowitz, and all of it was true. A
low-down, sneaky, brilliant plan, if
I say so myself, and I do, since it
was my idea, as chairman of the
Rules Committee.

Now for Horowitz's omissions.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Does GM |
About Cleaner ‘Air?

 

 

You bet we do! General Motors has made a public pledge
to solve the problem of vehicle emissions in the shortest
possible time. We’re working in two directions to accom-
plish this objective: finding new ways to further reduce
pollutants from our current engines and exploring, through
aggressive research programs, new low-pollutant power
sources.

GM BEGAN EMISSION CONTROL k
RESEARCH 20 YEARS AGO

It was some twenty years ago that GM initiated its first
research into the control of vehicle emissions. The imme-
diate problem was air pollution in the Los Angeles basin.
At that time, air chemistry and the reaction of vehicle
emissions in the air was a little-known field. Even today,
scientists are only beginning to unravel this immensely com-
plex subject.

WHERE THE EMISSIONS COME FROM

While it was known that trace amounts of the hydrocarbons
which make up gasoline are not burned in the combustion
process, it was generally thought that these unburned
hydrocarbons were emitted only through the exhaust sys-
tem. GM scientists learned that only 60% of a vehicle’s
unburned hydrocarbons were emitted through the exhaust
system—20% escaped through the crankcase vent and
20% through evaporation of gasoline vapors from the
fuel tank and carburetor.

EMISSIONS FROM A CAR WITHOUT CONTROLS

The major emissions from a car without controls are un-
burned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of
nitrogen. Of these, the unburned hydrocarbons were rec-
ognized by GM and government scientists as being the
major contributors to Los Angeles-type smog and were
selected for emphasis in control. As in most technical ad-
vances, progress in controlling these emissions was made
in a series of steps, not in a single dramatic leap.

ae

CLOSING OFF THE CRANKCASE VENT

The first step was the development of the Positive Crank-
case Ventilation (PCV) system. This system, which was
installed in all cars sold in California beginning with the
1961 model (1963 model, nationwide), substantially elim-
inated the 20% of pollutants being emitted through the
crankcase vent. This was done voluntarily prior to the
existence of government standards.

EXHAUST CONTROL MEASURES

Next, systems were developed to control exhaust emissions.
Exhaust control systems were installed on most 1966 GM
cars produced for sale in California (all 1968 models, nation-
wide). These systems, along with the PCV control which
previously had been made standard equipment, decreased
the emissions of hydrocarbons by about 60% from the
level emitted by an uncontrolled car.

CONTROLLING EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS

Evaporative emissions from the fuel tank and the carbu-
retor were the last of the three sources to be controlled.
All 1970-model GM cars produced for sale in California
have these controls. Beginning with 1971 models, GM will
include evaporative controls on its production nationwide.

WHERE DOES GM STAND?

artification tests, required by the State of California prior
to production, showed that GM 1970 model cars, as

pped for California use, achieved reductions of more
thar, 80% on hydrocarbon emissions and reductions of
more than 65% on carbon monoxide emissions compared
with 1960 cars withou! controls.

 

   

 

Care,

We think this is good progress toward our goal of a vir-
tually pollutant-free car. While the goal is now in sight,
the last mile will be the toughest part of the fight.

WHAT GM IS DOING

As we said, we're pursuing two roads toward our objective
of cleaner air: better controls for the present engines and
new power sources.

Our research on the current engine is looking into the
possible modification of engine design, improved control
systems and possibly fuel injection for more precise air-
fuel ratios. This research also shows that the use of unleaded
fuel would make possible advanced emission-control systems.
After the results of this research were discussed individually
with different petroleum companies, a number of these com-
panies announced that they would soon offer an unleaded
gasoline. With the availability of unleaded gasoline, long-
life exhaust catalytic converters, exhaust manifold reactors
and exhaust gas recirculation systems could become tech-

nically feasible.

We are also continuing to investigate alternative power
sources aggressively and completely. We are not committed
to the internal combustion engine and are investigating these
power sources with an open mind. Steam, electric, Stirling,
hybrid and gas turbine engines are being vigorously studied
in the largest research program of its type in the world. We
will have no hesitation in using a practical low-pollutant
alternative to the internal combustion engine.

WHAT CAN THE CAR OWNER DO?

Car owners can actively join in the battle for cleaner air.

First, keep your car in efficient operating condition through
proper maintenance. Studies have shown that proper engine
maintenance can substantially lower a vehicle’s emissions.
You should do this anyway to keep your operating costs
down and to make sure you are driving a safe car.

Second, GM dealers will soon be offering a low-cost emis-
sion-control system to be installed on 1967 models or
older (1965 or older in California). The system will in-
clude an ignition control device and call for an engine
tune-up to manufacturer's recommendations. Emissions
are reduced up to 50%. The system will be available in
California when certified by the California Air Resources
Board and nationally, as soon as possible thereafter. Have
it installed when it becomes available.

AT GENERAL MOTORS WE HAVE
ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE

Our society is rightly placing increased emphasis on the
necessity for clean air. At General Motors we have ao
cepted this challenge. Over the years we have made &
substantial commitment in people, facilities and funds in
order to solve our part of the air pollution problem. We will
continue this effort until this goal is reached.

A GLOSSARY OF POLLUTION TERMS |

Hydrocarbons: Compounds of hydrogen and carbon, Gaso-
line is made up of many different hydrocarbons, Both evapo |
rative losses and exhaust emissions contain a variety of
hydrocarbons. When baked by the sun they react photo
chemically with other gases to form

Carbon monoxide: A colorless, odorless, tasteless gas result
ing from the combustion of carbon with insufficient air.
Oxides of nitrogen: A natural by-product of combustion,
Lead: An additive used in gasoline to reduce engine spurk
knock. A principal fault is that it fouls pollution control
devices.

OUR OBJECTIVE: TO ELIMINATE AIR POLLUTION

to Babe Ruth, were still in Babe
Ruth League when you were dropp-
ed from American Legion ball and
so on. But I guess I had my chance.
I had a headstart on these two guys
and blew it. After all I was already
sitting up when they still had two
months to go.

No doubt, the biggest shock of all
though, came when I was looking
through the names of the coaches
and managers for the current sea-
son. Of course there were the Gil
Hodges, the Yogi Berras, and the
Red Schoendiensts, but everybody
knew them when they were in their
prime. So big deal. But, my God,
what’s Joe Pignatano, Jim Busby
Ozzie Virgil, Mike ‘Roarke, and
Rocky Bridges doing on the list of
coaches.

I mean, it wasn't so very long
ago that I was furious because I had
doubles of Jim Busby, and triples
of Joe Pignatano, trying desperately
to trade away the extra cards. But
there wasn't ever much of a market
for Pignatanos and Busbys. Now
they're all coaches or managers,
automatically acquiring some sort of
distinction as an aged mentor. And
I, because I once watched these
“old” men when they were players,
have to feel just a wee bit older.
It's all part of growing up, I guess,
facing the draft graduating
from college reading about
Rocky Bridges’ retirement and all
that, but I could swear it was only
yesterday that I tried to smeak a
Roy McMillan past for a Wally
Moon. Maybe I should try again,
for they're really running the base
paths now.

Lacrosse Team 5-1;
Roanoke Clobbered

They said it couldn't be done.
Washington and Lee could never
beat a team from the top lacrosse
division in the nation, the Middle
Eastern Division. Last Saturday,
though, the Generals did just that
when they defeated the University
of Baltimore by a score of 10-7.

Jim McCane scored the first goal
of the game. After the first quarter
W&L had three goals while blank-
ing Baltimore. By the half, the Gen-
erals had a 5-1 margin. The third
quarter was a good one for Balti-
more, however. They permitted
W&L only one goal while they took
four, making the score 6-5 in the
favor of the Blue. Hopes for a Balti-
more victory faded in the fourth
quarter when the Generals got four
goals and kept the Baltimore team
down to two.

This win heightens the Generals’
prestige and will make other teams
recognize Washington and Lee’s la-
crosse renaissance. Not once in the
entire game did the Generals trail.

Yesterday, Roanoke College ven-
tured into Lexington to take on the
Generals, Sam Englehart, assisted
by Bob Brumback, scored the first

goal, After only six minutes of play,
the Big Blue had accumulated some
five goals. By the end of the quarter
the margin was upped to 9-1, Of
the Generals’ first nine goals, Engle-
hart had scored 5, Whit Morrill had
2 and McCane and Meriwether had
bagged one apiece.

Within the second quarter, Hank
Slauson added two more goals, La-
motte came up with one and Groton
threw in another. Groton scored
two more goals in the third quarter,
while Ed Tognetti and Winfield got
one apiece. Going into the fourth
quarter, the score was up to 17-2.
The last quarter made the final tally
20-5. Of our three goals in the
fourth quarter, John Rogers, a de-
fenseman, nabbed two with Mark
Skoggard making the other one.

So far, W&L’s record is five and
one, with wins against Geneseo
State, Villanova, Duke, Baltimore

and Roanoke. The lone upset came
at the hands of Towson State. The
Generals have played tough schools
and fared quite well against them.
Take the Duke game for example.
The score was tied, 3-3 at the begin-

added a third insurance run in the
eighth, scoring on singles by Danny
Pond and Chris Zeno and a pinch-
double by Tom Hoy.

Although Rose kept the Generals’
batters off balance with a slider and
excellent control, and crafty off-
speed hurling, the right hander was
helped several times by his team-
mate's defensive efforts. The Tigers
put down an eighth inning rally at-
tempt which had resulted from Steve
Kalista’s single and Brad Hall's
fielder’s choice. Rob LaRue then
lined a single to left field, but Kal-
ista was nailed at the plate trying
to score from second and Hall was
thrown out trying to reach third,
thus completing a double play

Once again Coach Lyles pulled all

charged with the loss. He was fol
lowed by King, in the fourth, Tim
Haley in the seventh, Bill Miller in

and amicable relations with Con-
gress if they are to be effective. Mit-
chell’s attempts at strong arm poli-
tics have alienated many Senators,
especially liberal Republicans. With

only 43 Republicans in the Senate,

the President needs almost unani-
mous support from his party in im-
portant votes, It was the defection
of 17 Republicans on the Haynes-
worth vote and 13 on the Carswell
vote that really doomed the nomi-
nees. How many of these votes
would have remained with the Presi.
dent if Mitchell had retained amic-
able relations with the Senate? It’s
impossible to say, but Newsweek
quotes one Senate Republican as
saying “John Mitchell is a disaster
for the Administration — an unmiti-
gated disaster.”

With unemployment up, the war
and recession continuing, and school
desegration reaching a crisis point,
President Nixon will need all the
friends in Congress he can muster,
and that means a different Attorney
General. As Life says, “Mitchell
Should Go.”

shooting a goal at 6:40. For the rest
of the game W&L played possession
ball, preventing Duke from making
another goal while Sam Englehart
got two more, making the final
score: W&L 8 and Duke §.

Why have the Generals had so
much success? One important fac-
tor is their strong offensive punch,
as shown in the game with Duke,
Baltimore and Roanoke. Another
factor could be their hard running
midfield. The defense must not be
overlooked, for it, too, has done a
creditable job. In the Duke game,
on extra-man plays, Washington and
Lee prevented Duke from getting a
single goal. And then there is one
man who cannot go without notice.
He is goalie Bill Ingersoll. His per-
formance against Duke, Baltimore
and Roanoke clearly shows his im-
portance to the team. Against Duke
he had 13 saves,

Lee Society
Meet at W&L

The Society of the Lees of Vir-
ginia will meet this weekend in
Lexington, where Gen. Robert E.
Lee spent the last five years of his
life.

The society, whose members are
descendents of Richard Lee the
Emigrant, who arrived in James-
town in 1639, will convene at Wash-

ington and Lee Saturday for its
annual meeting.
Saturday's events will center

around Washington and Lee. Gen.
Lee became president of the institu-
tion not long after Appomattox.

The annual meeting at 10 a.m.
will be held in Lee Chapel, where
the general is buried. Mrs. William
R. Stubbs, a hostess at the Chapel,
will address the society.

This proposal establishes freedom as
to what day a student may take this
exams. However, the student must
decide and announce in advance
when he will take his exams,

During the discussion of this pro-
posal Dean Kumpuris claimed that
he felt sealed exams could be dis-
tributed before the assigned exami-
nation period. When the bell sound-
ed, students could break open their
exams and begin work. This method
would eliminate congestion at the
beginning and terminating bells of
each exam period.

The final speaker of the afternoon
was Mr. Bernard Cohen, legal coun

polling of delegations. The goal of
the Mock Convention has been, and
should remain, accuracy. If the dele-
gates were polled on the first ballot
of the presidential nomination, the
concept of accuracy would go out
the window. This is a Mock Con-
vention. But the leaders of the Rea-
gan campaign would not accept this.
They chose to ignore the fact that
this was an educational experience,
a good time, and a Mock conven-
tion. So they decided to sabotage the
entire Operation by insisting that
each delegation be polled. Hence
top secret plan.

2. The plan didn’t work. Saund-
ers wouldn't go through with it.
Saunders believed that my plan was
unethical (which it most certainly
was), and in spite of the fact that it
might kill the whole goal of the con-
vention, Saunders explained the de-
sired rule change to the delegates
The delegates voted by voice vote,
and the new rule was declared in
force, in spite of the Reagan forces
I have since seen the light, and
abhor what I did.

Which brings me to the point of
this epistle. There was an individual,
namely Steve Saunders, who refused
to let this convention be fixed (above
and beyond the inherent fix of a
nominating convention).

Horowitz is correct in asserting
that the United States government
is a “fix.” It does disregard the
rights and desires of its citizens. To
carry the argument even further,
there is present a latent form of fas
cism or elitism throughout the poli
tical spectrum, which includes

Nixon's alleged
silent majority.
But unlike Horowitz, I'm willing
to give it all, once more, one more
chance (tautology intended). I am
still convinced that there must be
individuals around who will rise
to “power” without squashing mil-
lions of heads on the way up, and
who will not have to keep the rest
in chains in order to remain “up.” If
I ever do lose this faith, and the
possibility certainly exists, then
there will be one more guy helping
to man the barricades.

On the front page, a news analy-
sis of important stories will appear
when events are deemed worthy of
a news anaylsis. The column will
appear under the title of “Pin Point”

irregularly.

“To promote a more fluent ex-
change of opinion within the Uni-
versity,” McConnell said, an opinion

vergent opinions from within the
university community to be printed

that Kappa Alpha Order's national
office rescinded the charter of its

meeting last night by president
Larry Honig

Honig said the action was anti-

cently decreased membership

However, Tuesday night the mem

Lawrence Sworn In President;

EC Allows Ann Red On Ballot

The EC swore in new student
body officers, heard requests from
students representing two areas, and
dealt with the eligibility of a con-
troversial candidate during Monday
night’s meeting,

Secretary Dobbins opened _ the
meeting by announcing the results
of last week’s student body elections
as well as the list of candidates for
next week’s class contests.

Fran Lawrence, a philosophy ma-
jor from Alexandria, captured the
student body presidency with 493
votes to 472 for Joe Tompkins. Rich
Murray, a journalism major from
Valatie, New York, won over Bruce
Madison for secretary, 463 to 398,
Phil Thompson, a law student from
Short Hills, New Jersey was elected
in an unopposed race for the vice-
presidency.

The other winners were Doug
Gossman, who won over Andrew
Wyndham for IFC President, Bob
Larue, who defeated Rob Minor for
the IFC vice-presidency, and Bert
Meem who downed JoJo Martin for
vice-president of the Dance Board.

The validity of the petition of
Miss Ann Red for the Presidency
of next year’s sophomore class con-
stituted the first discussion on the
agenda. Miss Red, currently a fresh-
man at Randolph-Macon Women’s
College, will be a part of the stu-
dent exchange program at W&L
next year.

After several readings from the
Student Body Constitution, and the
continued stress that the evening's

vote would “set a precedent for
future years,” Bethea moved that
the petition be accepted.

The motion was carried six to
five. Azuma, Bethea, Dobbins,
Markham, Ogilvie, and Tompkins
supported the proposal. Dean Kum-
puris, Drew Kumpuris, Andrews,
Prater and Thompson were in op-
position.

See Editorial Comment, page 2;
And Feature Story, page 3

Dan Silberberg, Interim Co-
Chairman of the 1972 Mock Con-
vention, reported to the committee
and requested funds for postage,
stationery and printing costs. After
a lengthy examination of the uses
of the money, Dean Kumpuris
moved that the Convention be al-
lotted one hundred dollars. This
passed unanimously.

Tom Mays and Steve Garris,
along with freshman representative
Alan Prater, presented for “recom
mendations and criticisms,” a pro-
posal for a “University Club” to
generate “cultural, social, academic
and religious interest within the
University faculty, students and
alumni.

Prater moved that the organiza
tion, which seeks to use the student
union as well as other parts of
the campus, be called to the at-
tention of the student body. Dean
Kumpuris moved that the proposal
be tabled pending more information:

e 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

E

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, April 29, 1970

From A New Writer To A Sometimes Reader

One of the most alluring temptations for
any human institution is for it to consider it-
self as the Ptolemaic center of a social uni-
verse. And this temptation has always been
doubly attractive for the Ring-tum Phi, for
its editor and staff have the somewhat titanic
responsibility of accumulating all the weekly
news and opinion of Washington and Lee
and arranging its content on six sheets of
newsprint 14 inches wide and 20 inches
long.

Consequently, we can be easily lulled
into the unjustifiable prejudice that the Ring-
tum Phi is the most important student in-
stitution on the campus. The most apparent
danger in this narrow attitude is that the
very publication of the newspaper tends to
become an end unto itself, thus promoting
a condescending attitude towards the rest of
the university community: it is all too easy
to flail the straw horse of apathy when a
newspaper is not read by its audience.

We would like to hope that the news-
paper has not operated under this self-asser-
tive fallacy in the past; in the future we will
attempt to avoid its pitfalls by striving to
reach several goals, the paramount purpose
being service to students, faculty, administra-

tion, alumni, and parents.

According to a faculty member in the
journalism department, national newspapers
have been greatly affected in recent years by
mergers—the resultant effect being a de-
crease in the forums for the expression of
opinion. The Ring-tum Phi is not unlike na-
tional newspapers in this sense; for, with the
combination of two four page editions into
one six page edition, the burdensome chal-
lenge of providing news and a forum for
opinion for the Washington and Lee com-
munity becomes even more demanding.

With this challenge for the coming year
in mind, we pledge service to the university
community by striving to provide an accur-
ate, reliable mirror of all the news relevant to
the community, and a forum for the ex-
change of divergent viewpoints on university
or extra-university issues.

At the risk of a platitudinous statement,
“to promise” and “to perform” historically
tend to be paradoxical infinitives. Realizing
this, we ask of you, the reader, to contribute
your opinions, advice, and criticism. For if
we are to judge how well we communicate to
you, you must respond to our effort.

—L. L. Me.

Ask Not For Whom The Bell Tolls...

Within a year’s time, the death knell has
sounded for two fraternities on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus. Life in 16 other frater-
nity houses goes on as normal; maybe oc-
casional comments are made that there will
just be two less fraternities to compete against
during next year’s deferred rush. The front
campus looks the same as it did last spring
when those two fraternity houses were still
occupied with people; perhaps those who sit
behind cluttered desks muse it was a sign
of our changing times that two fraternities
have decided to fold.

Within a year’s time, two death knells
have sounded for fraternities on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. And, if we may have
the momentary license to prognosticate the
future, the resonances begun this year will
be heard again the next.

Fraternities have committed a tragic er-
ror in the past for which they are presently
paying with their lives: they have failed to
recognize that their only hope of salvation
was in the potential for the Interfraternity
Council to be a collective body representing
the best interests of the fraternity system, not
power block ABC and XYZ.

The IFC is the only institution on this
campus which will actively promote the idea
“fraternity; and those who dream that the
faculty or administration are actively sup-
porting fraternities are living in the bygone

age of in loco parentis. Now, it’s laissez faire

Pied Piperism

To those who might argue that W&L
is provincial and backward because it respects
tradition and custom, we can only say open
your eyes. The most recent indication that
we are keeping in step—unfortunate as that
may be—with the rest of the nation appeared
Monday night when the Executive Com-
mittee allowed Miss Red to run for the
office of sophomore president.

By keeping in step we do not mean with
the trend promoting the ideal of the “emancei-
pated woman,” rather we are more con-
cerned with the EC blindly following the
currently popular Pied Piper down the road
of loose constructionism just for the sake of
being part of the mindless mob. If the EC
had moved from a strict interpretation of the
student body constitution for any considered
reason, that would have been fine. Their
ruling on the Miss Red case, however, can
be regarded only as that—misread.

Historically, enabling documents such as
the student body constitution are written to
permit a certain amount of interpretive
analysis which insures flexibility and hence
permanence. Precedent on this campus has
granted the EC sole responsibility in the
juridical role of interpreting this document.
The EC should, however, be made to com-

education, which means of course that if
students want fraternities, they can have
them, just so long as their institutions do not
interfere with the academic environment of
the university. The dubious attempt to place
fraternities in a proper academic perspective
was made by the faculty—they shouldered a
majority of the student body with the awe-
some responsibility of obtaining a substantial
new membership during the first seven weeks
of classes.

But after all is said about who made next
year’s bed, the fraternities still must lie in
it. Next year’s deferred rush serves only to
place an even greater responsibility upon a
governing body which has in the past been
neither governing nor a body.

And if fraternities are to survive the perils
of freshman cars, academic pressure, and
seven weeks of work, they must look first to
the Interfraternity Council and the leader-
ship of its new president, Doug Gossman.
We do not envy his task for the coming year:
the active promotion of the fraternity con-
cept as a workable, valuable aspect of the
Washington and Lee educational environ-
ment.

Unless sectionalism and politics are cast
aside, the fraternity system’s narrowness of
the past will become its pallbearer for the
future.

—L. L. Me.

And The E C

prehend the distinction between interpreta-
tion and emendation.
The justification of Miss Red’s candi-
requires constitutional emendation, not
interpretation. In other words, the action
usurped the prerogative of the student body
which, as the EC is fully aware, must approve
constitutional amendments.

The constitution requires candidates for
the three EC posts elected at-large to be
“regularly matriculated”. There is no explicit
provision regarding such a requirement for
the other student body offices. The only
rational interpretation that could possibly
be made would be naturally to stipulate
that all candidates be “regularly matricu-
lated”, since that clause appears in the con-
stitution,

The Executive Committee circumvented
the constitution in permitting Miss Red’s
candidacy, since it understood that she will
not be a W&L student until September,
wheras the duties of that office are assumed
at commencement. To apply this new mean-
ing to the constitution, the EC, if it had
any semblance of legal or moral ethics,
would have to gain the approval of the
entire student body—and it did not.

—R.H.Y.

A New Curriculum: The Future
For W&L Academics In The 70’s

By DAVE OLSON

Unlike previous years with the
coming of spring now the student
body has been awaiting with antici-
pation the coming of the new cata-
logue with its great body of in-
formation on how things will be
under the new curriculum beginning
next year.

Although the official catalogue
will not be out till the fall, a book-
let with course offerings and de-
gree requirements has been put out.

Not only is the new collection of
courses offered more voluminous
but also far more varied. Many
departments have worked in con-
junction to form interdepartmental
majors and courses. The most in-
teresting of these is the Biology-
Psychology-Sociology major which
is offered as an education in the
human condition. There are also
combinations in the fields of Mathe-
matics and Physics and there will
be a great deal of leeway given to
science majors to major interde-
partmentally.

There have also been some new
departments created. The Classics,
which will study the Greek and
Latin classics and our English herit-
age from these classical languages.
Music and Drama has now been
taken out from under the Art de-
partment and has been made a
department in its own right. For
the first time an introductory course
in Italian will be offered. Basically
the rest of the departments have
remained the same as far as ad-
ministrative constitution is con-
cerned.

In the departments themselves,
however, there have been many
varied and exciting changes. With the
advent of the spring term there
have been created greater seminar
possibilities in all departments.

I will try to mention some of the
more notable changes. In History
there has been a large expansion in
the number of courses offered. A
new member of the History faculty,
Professor Porter, will be teaching
six new courses (some in African
History) and the other professors
in the department have added
courses as well. There are also
offered seminar courses for fresh-
men and sophomores in either
United States or European History,
an opportunity not open to under-
classmen in the past. As a matter
of fact, this is the case in many
of the departments.

In geology there is an interest-
ing array of one-credit courses on
subjects of contemporary interest,

*. . . hopefully
we can achieve
some of that neb-
ulous quality called
intellectual

curiosity.”

most notably a course on Urban
Development and Regional Planning
and a course on the Moon. The
Physics is now offering Astronomy
without the necessity of a prere-
quisite.

In Sociology a course on Black
America is being offered for the
academic year 1971-1972, a course
long overdue at Washington and
Lee. In English there is a variety
of course offerings for freshmen
and sophomores instead of the drab
freshman course, the History of
British Literature offered in the
past. Not only has the English De-
partment added more courses for
freshmen and sophmores but most
of the departments with heavy loads
in this area have done likewise.

In most cases the departments
have designed courses on a two-fold
basis, one for the student planning
to major in that field or that stu-
dent who is taking the course for
distribution requirements. Sciences
especially have designed courses
with the arts student in mind.

Distribution is as it was ex-
plained last spring, that is, 36 hours
from 4 divisions with between 6
and 12 hours for each of the
divisions. The divisions are gener-
ally: Languages, the Arts, Math and
Science and the Social sciences.

Credit hours for graduation have
been instituted on a sliding scale
whereby the Class of ‘71 will need
120 hours to graduate, the Class of
72 will need 118 and the Class of
73 will need 117 and all subsequent
classes will need 115 hours to gradu-
ate. The Pass/Fail course option
has been extended to the Sophomore

class as the Junior and Senior
classes as in the past. Also we will
have to deal with wolf-in-sheep’s-
clothing in the professor's decid-
ing cut restrictions.

I would like to say a word about
two instructors. Mr. Pellicciaro, pre-
viously teaching in Ancient langu-
ages will now also be teaching
courses in Art, Classics, Sociology
and Philosophy (in conjunction with
Professor Pemberton). He must be
a very versatile and ambitious
teacher. Also Washington and Lee
will have a female on the faculty
next year. She will be Mrs. O. K.
Barnes and she will be taking over
for Lee Kahn while he is on leave
next year.

Although it may seem that things
will be much easier and enjoyable
next year we should approach the
year with caution. There will be
many classes meeting for an hour
and forty minutes length. Also we
will have classes from eight in the
morning to five in the afternoon.
We have to keep in mind the fact
that was in the past covered in
fifteen weeks will now be covered
in twlve weeks so the concentration
and amount of work is sure to be
increased.

I feel that the changes will be
good for Washington and Lee. It
will be new, different and exciting:
and hopefully we can now achieve
some of that nebulous quality call-
ed intellectual curiosity.

Procedure Cited

For Registration

When Spring Registration time
comes this year certain changes will
be noted, changes both in the forms
to be used and in the procedures,

Considering the purpose of the
Registration Form and how it could
be used most effectively, it was de-
cided to use a different computer
card for each term. The cards are
identical except for the designation
of term, FALL, WINTER AND
SPRING. As far as the students and
professors are concerned, the proce-
dure for registration is the same, but
because the form is on a card, it can
be better handled by the computer
personnel, with the student properly
identified etc. The card seems to be a
proper compromise between doing
everything by hand or everything by
machine.

A PLANNING CARD is being

College Guide Rates W&L

By BOR VEVICH
Editor-in-Chief

Washington and Lee has a library
replete with 200,000 volumes .
how many students here frequent
the library? Our average SAT
scores are 600 verbal, 630 math

. are our students interesting of
boorish, urbane or provincial?

Questions such as these are com-
monly posed by prospective stu-
dents here and at every other col-
lege and university. Without visiting
a campus for a week, however,
there is a strong possibility that po-
tential college freshmen will never
learn the answers. A recently pub-
lished guide attmpts to offer some
answers by picturing what life at
100 or so colleges and universities
is really like.

Compiled and edited by the staff
of The Yale Daily News, “The
Insiders’ Guide to the Colleges”
should become one of the most suc-
cessful works of the decade. Writ-
ten in charming and easygoing style,
this novel guide makes a significant
start in filling the void left by pro-
fessional works which are too sta-

tistical and never really get at the
heart of a school.

The insiders’ guide is just that,
It was compiled from reports of
student correspondents at each of
the colleges, and who would be
better able to offer more candid and
factual reports about student life?
The University of Georgia section,
for example, reads: “There is also
a running rumor tht Jesus Christ
could never have been born at
Georgia, since this would require
three wise men and a virgin.”

The truthful bluntness of the
guide is sometimes frightening: “In
selecting a college one must always
remember that ‘the college experi-
ence’ per se has only a coincidental
relation to education. College,
really, is a moratorium, a time for
you to stick your toe in the
Olympic-size swimming pool of life
before taking that final shivering
plunge. Whether you get an educa-
tion ~ or not (it's a $0-50 chance),
you will be a different person four
years from entering.”

“The fact is that even at the

On Racial Incident

To the Editor, Ring-ium Phi

I am writing this letter in order
to make Washington and Lee stu-
dents aware of certain events which
took place last Thursday evening,
April 23, at the Dahlia on Bedford
Avenue, in Lynchburg Virginia

That evening my date and I,
along with two other couples, were
firmly refused any kind of service
by the bartender, We were not even
served Cokes, This quick. and quite
clear, denial of service had cer
tainly not been prompted by our
actions or general behavior—we had
not been drinking, we had entered
the establishment in an orderly fash-

ion, and we had been polite to the
bartender

After a few inquiries as to why
we were being refused service it
became quite apparent that the
reason was that one of the couples
in our group was inter-racial,

We were shortly asked to leave
by the bartender, that “he didn't
need our kind around here.” Upon
leaving we were “escorted” out by
by the bartender and seven local
patrons of the Dahlia.

I am concerned for the embarass
ment cause to the couple. Also, |
can now more clearly sympathize
with militant blacks. I hope this
incident will be recalled by any
students who might consider pa-
tronizing the Dahlia in the future

best colleges classes and books are
often an annoying detail in the
life of the student. Most important
college experiences take place in the
bars, poo! halls, fraternities, clubs,
football stadiums, sororities .
during summer vacations . . . after
eleven o'clock at night.” In short,
the work shatters illusions that
should be shattered in the hope of
helping students to find the right
place for their personality so that
wrong decisions, such as those based
on the “I came here because the
economics department was good”
attitudes, can be avoided.

The book offers some comments
which are valuable in soul-searching
for students already in college. For
examble, the editors identify five
basic genres in collegiate types: the
hippie-syndrome protester; the soc-
ial-athlete-stud who is never seen
in the same place as the first type
and whose hair is neatly combed:
the all-American civic student leader
who wants to go to law school: the
wonk; and, the nerdish tube rat.

The last two two type comprise
over fifty percent of the usual
student body but are most difficul
to spot since they rarely come out
in the open, The wonk spends all
his time in the library, is disdainful
of most things, and never tells dirty
jokes. The tube rat makes C's, sel-
dom dates, watches Mission Impos-
sible or Mod Squad, and reads
Playboy from cover to cover

The WAL section accurately in
forms the reader what there is to
do at “St. Bob's” college in a
well-written comprehensive essay
which for some reason is probably
the dullest passage in the book
Most of it unfortunately reads like
the propaganda found in the cata
logue with a few exceptions. “The
girls are imported by car {not
a necessity, but very useful after
the freshman year) every weekend

where they are treated to the
finest soul music from all over the
south. Though drugs are rarely pa
tronized, the state liquor store in
Lexington has the highest per capita
volume in Virginia.’

Home On The Range

By Betty E. Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

In spring a young man’s fancy
turns to—what he has been think-
ing about all winter. And this ap-
plies to food as much as to love!
Visitors often express surprise that
a bookstore in a men’s college
should have a cooking section. But
as in France, the great chefs around
here are men, too. Although there
is a brisk interest in such cookbooks
as “The Impoverished Student's
Guide to Cookery, Drinkery and
Housekeepery” throughout the year,
it is in the spring that the real surge
comes.

One sees students and their dates
prowling the aisles of the supermar-
kets in search of new ways to cook
hamburgers or something that will
feed an unknown number of friends
easily. This is where such books as

“The College Cookbook: After
Hamburgers, What?” and “The |
Never Cooked Before Cookbook”

comes in very handily. Even people
who view the whole procedure with

considerable alarm find Peg Brac-
ken’s “I Hate To Cook Cookbook”
enough to send them to the kitchen
quite happily.

Then one can move on to more
esoteric gourmet-type cooking. With
“The Ten-Minute Gourmet Cook-
book” there is no limit to special
foods that can be gotten up of a
warm summer evening. Other books
along the same line are: “Posh
Foods,” “Our Man in the Kitchen”
and the famous “French Chef's
Cookbook” by Julia Child.

Of course, all those June weddings
coming along accounts for part of
the cookbook rush. Such gifts as
“The Joy of Cooking” and “Glori-
ous Stews” (good on the economic
situation of new, hopefully careful,
budgeters) are welcomed by young
brides.

Finally, there are special interest
cookbooks such as the “Natural
Foods Cookbook,” Mexican and
Italian Cookbooks—and the intrigu-
ing “Home Brewing Without Fail!”

College Dropout Charged
With Narcotics Murder

College dropout Alvin Bumin, 22,

of Short Hills, New Jersey, goes
on trial tomorrow in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court on charges

of murdering his ex-girl friend with
an overdose of heroin.

Bumin is accused of killing Ann
Phetamine, 19, whose body was
found February 14 in the living
room of defendant's apartment in
nearby East Goshen Gap. Both Miss
Phetamine and Bumin were former
students at East Goshen Gap Uni-
versily.

Attorneys for both sides expressed
confidence on the eve of the trial.
“We expect to show beyong a
reasonable doubt that the defend-
ant committed this horrible crime,”
said assistant Commonwealth's At-
torney Philip G. Gardner.

A spokesman for the defense,
however, scoffed at the prosecution’s
claim. “They have no case at all.

Miss Red announced her candi-
dacy last week, after filing her peti-
tion with the Secretary of the Stu-
dent Body. Her decision to run was
inspired partly in jest and partly
by an encouragement from admini-
strators for her to take an active
interest in extra-curricular affairs.
After consideration of the idea, Miss
Red decided that her running in
a campaign would be extremely
beneficial in her integration into the
W&L community.

In order to help her win the
election, Miss Red is beginning, in
her words, “...a rather flamboyant
campaign...” to attract student at-
tention and support. Her plans in-
clude concerts and rallies.

Her stated goal, if she be elected,
is to unite the sophomore class as
a class. Mention was made of the
crumbling of class unity due to stu-

dents’ moving to apartments and
fraternity houses. To combat this
divergence, Miss Red suggests a

Sophomore Council to be used as
a sounding board.

Miss Red feels that she offers a
distinct alternative to those mem-
bers of the class who are tired of
the regularity of life at WAL.

By Greg Raetz

(Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum Phi
takes great pleasure in presenting its
weekly columnist for the coming
year, Greg Raetz. His column,
“Through A Spyglass, Darkly,” is
intended to be an expression of his
views on campus issues, We urge
your indulgence; and we invite your
comments.)

A conspicious result of last weeks
election is runaway consternation
among many students. Fran Law-
rence, an avowed reformer, edged
out Joe Tompkins, the EC establish-
ment candidate, by twenty-one votes
—winning a hairline election vic-
tory with 2/3 of the student body
voting.

What concerns these students is
not that the establishment was beat-
en (no one is really happy with the
EC), but rather who beat it. Fran
Lawrence, whose appearance hardly
suggests a campus conservative, put
his candidacy before the student
body on a platform of change .. .
coeducation, modification of the
honor system, and fewer fraterni-

ties.

Needless to say, his ideas did not
go down well with a large portion
of the tradition-minded, conserva-
tive students and faculty. Hence,
consternation at the very least. But,
is all lost? Exactly what does the
president of the student body do?
Why, he is the grand dragon of the
EC you answer.

Well, then, what does the EC do?
Why, it conducts honor trials (if
these are not voted out of existence)
and forms committees to submit
findings to the administration.
Whereupon, the administration, if
it has already made a similiar study
and voted its approval, approves or
disapproves and then thanks the EC
for its effort and assures them that
a “meaningful dialogue” has been
conducted and that the discussion
has been “releyanf” and will be
considered—in the fiture.

This analysis must be largely ac-
curate, for how many students know
who Marvin C. Henberg is? And
for those who do, try naming some
of his accomplishments.

In the five years that our con-
ference has been in existence, Wash-
ington College, from Chestertown,
Maryland, has gone undefeated in
lacrosse until this year. Defeated by
U.N.C. and Towson State, the team
from Maryland ventured into the
valley last Saturday, only to be de-
feated by the Generals: 10-4,

In the first half of the game Bill
Ingersoll, from Chestertown him-
self, kept Washington scoreless. The
Generals, on the other hand, made
six goals in this half. Washington
College did better in the second
half, scoring four goals, but the
Blue never gave them a chance for
victory. This was truly a big win
for the Generals. The defense of
Ned Coslett, Bill Brumback, and
Tommy Smith did an outstanding
job, while Scott Neese and Sam
Englehart proved vital to our
offense, Scott making 1 goal and 3
assists, and Englehart notching 5
goals. The W&L lacrosse team can
now claim to have beaten a team
which ranked fifth nationally in

On A Rampage |

1967, and which ranked first of
all small colleges over the decade.

Unfortunately, the team can't
celebrate this victory, for the stick-
men travel to Baltimore to go
against Loyola on April 30. Al-
though the Loyola team is young,
they will prove to be tough com-
petition. The Generals will have to
start out well, and play hard against
the Baltimore team that lost to
Penn State by only one point. With-
out a victory over Loyola, the di-
vision championship is lost.

Then on May 2, the University
of North Carolina, led by two all-
Americans, Harper Peterson and
Pete Cramer, will come up to Lex-
ington and play the Generals at
2:30. Their goalie was awarded the
Markland Kelly Award last year,
which ranked him the best goalie
in the country. The North Carolina
team has only two losses, one to
U.Va. and the other to Maryland,
Hopefully, W&L will add another
loss to their record this Saturday.

The Generals ran afoul of more
bad luck on the baseball diamond,
losing twice last week. Hampden-
Sydney took a 10 inning 8-7 de-
cision Wednesday, and Lynchburg
rallied to beat Washington and Lee
7-2 last Friday.

Catcher Stu Friedmann ignited a
six-run inning for Lynchburg Col-
lege, sending Bruce King’s second
pitch of the inning over the left-
centerfield fence to tie the score
2-2. Eddie Carter's bases-loaded
single provided two more runs, and
pitcher Keith Scruggs added another
with an infield single. Steve Good-
man’s shot sent home the Hornets’
final tallies.

Scruggs got off to a shaky start,
walking lead-off man, Rob LaRue,
who scored on Doug Clelan’s long
single down the right field line.

The suave W&L Soccer team is
again on the ball for a little Spring
training. After a fine initial turn-
out we've had a good core of regu-
lars with new faces turning up
everyday. (Some of this however,
we attribute to the fact that a few
guys were hit in the chin with the
ball.) We're practicing from 3-4:30
on the Rugby field and we welcome
newcomers, (we'd even welcome
some of you old guys back). Daily,
we've been doing some short ball-
handling exercises and then some
quite un-routine scrimmage work.
One goal last week for instance,
was scored by a motorcyclist.

Last Sunday, our fabulous team
handily defeated the VMI squad in
a practice game held on the Rugby
field. This was accomplished by

Tennis Team Has Midas Touch

Chances are there will be no
songs written about it, but when
it comes to “rolling along,” the
W&L tennis team has Old Man
River beat by a mile. The tennis
Generals have laid waste to all
obstacles this year, Well, almost all.
There was that unfortunate en-
counter with Duke earlier in the
year. But the splendid play of his
team recently has pleased Coach
Canfield. “It's pleasing, but not sur-
prising really. The boys have been
working hard and it’s paying off.”

fom McJunkin continues to set
the pace as he is still undefeated in
his five matches. Marshall Wash-
burn has won the most singles
matches, seven victories under his
belt. Combine this with five doubles
victories (Stan Taylor is his play-
ing partner) and the impressive
freshman has a whopping 12 wins,
Jeff Driscoll and Bill Gatlin both
have 6-3 records in singles and as
the number one doubles team, they
are also 6-3. Since a forfeit over

 

have been unbeatable in four out-
ings. They are now 8-1.

Virginia Commonwealth provided
no competition whatsoever for the
rampaging W&L team as they were
victims of a 9-0 shellacking. Gatlin,
Washburn, and Driscoll put thei
singles matches away easily, and for
the first time Canfield was able to
use freshman Lee Thalheimer and
Dave Gilbert in the number five
and six singles slots. Thalheimer
responded to the opportunity by
burying his opponent, 6-2, 6-1. Gil-
bert had a little more difficulty but
still won.

Old Dominion fared only a little
better against the Generals in that
they were not blank. The doubles
team of Taylor-Washburn continued
to roll, winning handily, as the Gen-
erals won the match 8-1.

Last week’s matches against
Hampden-Sydney and Lynchburg
were not exactly laughers, though.
H-S was tough but one again the
Taylor-Washburn combination turn-

much needed doubles victory. Most
of the individual matches were long
affairs with few being decided by
six game sets.

But Coach Canfield has all his
doubles corps to thank for the
Lynchburg victory, the Generals
handed the Hornets a 6-3 loss, but
only after a sweep of all the doubles
matches. Gatlin, Washburn, and
John Kefauver were the only singles

winners, but combined with the
doubles sweep, it was enough for
the Generals’ eight victory in nine
decisions.

There are three matches left (with
U.Va., Emory and Henry, and
Sewanee) before the tennis team
goes to the CAC tournament, and it
looks as if Coach Canfield has his
team bulldozin’ its way to a fourth
straight CAC championship.

Delts Win Intramurals

By reaching the finals in volley-
ball and taking fourth place in the
track meet, Delta Tau Delta cap-
tured the intramural championship
this year. Intramural Director Frank
Davidson unfficially announced that
the SAE’s or the Phi Kap’s can al
best lose by ten points to the Delts.

The year however has been high-
lighted by no single domination.
The lead in intramurals changed
constantly and made for frantic
“calls to arms” in most fraternity
houses, The single most important
factor this year was participation.
Only the Phi Delts won three sports;
the Delts only won wrestling.

“Intramurals were extremely suc-
cessful this year,” says Davidson,
“but we are exploring possible
changes for next year.” Coach Cor-
rigan is also checking programs in
other schools. Deferred rush is caus-
ing a problem with freshman
participation.

captain Hyatt came thru with a

“to maintain an all-male student
body.”

The resolution, introduced by
Bruce MacQueen, senior commerce
major and recent president of the
Young Republican Chapter, states
that the men-only standard “is a

versity a8 we know it,”

his motion was passed.

Kumpuris then moved that the
EC sponsor a luncheon for presi-
dents of all student organizations.
Ihe luncheon, to be held for the
leaders of next year’s organizations,
would hopefully promote more co-
operation among student groups.
The motion passed unanimously and
Kumpuris was appointed to organize
the event during May.

President Henberg assigned cur-
rent EC members to duty in over-
seeing next Monday’s elections and
stressed that each voter casts two
ballots for his class EC representa-
tives and one for the other officers.

It was also announced that the
EC will accept nominations from
the Student Body for the Gilliam
Award. This is awarded annually
to the student who has contributed
most to the student body,

The meeting was adjourned after
an exectutive session.

President-elect Lawrence, who ob-
served the meeting, felt that the
University Club idea “indicates that
we are beginning to realize that our
viable old institutions are evoling
into more pertinent and worthwhile
ones,”

Secretary-elect Murray said he
was “impressed” by the meeting and
commented that he was “looking
forward to the job ahead.”

Faculty Adopts
Exam Proposal
For Next Year

Siudents will plan their final ex-
amination schedules individually be-
ginning next year, the university’s
faculty decided this Monday.

Under the new “independent exam
system,” each student will be re-
quired simply to notify the registrar,
one week in advance, of the hour at
which he plans to take each of his
final exams.

When the independent scheduling
system goes into effect next autumn,
students will have nine separate
three-hour exam periods to choose
among. Most students will be tak-
ing four courses with final exams.

The autumn exam period will be-
gin Saturday, Dec. 12, at 9 a.m. and
will continue through noon the fol-
lowing Thursday, Dec. 17. On Sat-
urday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wed-
nesday, exams will be administered
between 9 a.m. and noon and be-
tween 2 and 5 p.m. Only a morning
exam will be given on Thursday, the
last day of examinations.

The student will pick up his exam
questions from the appropriate de-
partment at the beginning of the
period for which he registered to
take each exam.

In courses requiring special physi-
cal arrangements for the final ex-
amination—such as fine arts courses
in which slides to be identified are
shown as part of the final — the de-
partmental faculty will schedule that
portion of the exam at a specific
hour and students will be required
to atiend then.

They will otherwise be entirely
free to register to take their exami-
nations during whichever exam per-
iods they please.

Previously, exams were admini-
stered according to the so-called
“block system,” under which every
student in a particular class or
course had to take the final exami-
nation at the same time as every
other student in the same class or
course. The day and hour for each
exam were determined under an
arbitrary pattern which rotated from
semester to semester.

Under the mew system, once the
siudent draws up his exam schedule
and registers his choices with the
registrar, the schedule is binding on
the student, subject to alteration
only with the approval of the fac-
ulty’s Executive Committee.

Professors will be free to change
their exam questions from one
three-hour period to the next, or te
keep the questions constant through-
out the exam week. In the latter
case, students will be pledged under
WA&L’s Honor System to keep both
the substance and the general na-
ture of the particular exam in strict
confidence

The independent exam-scheduling
sysiem was voted by the faculty
affer extensive investigation of its
merits as well as the merits of al-
ternative systems by the Executive
Committee.

Ihe EC had endorsed a similar
independent scheduling sysiem ear
lier this year, and Student Body
President Swede Henberg attended
part of the faculty's deliberations

tion,

EC Endorses Petition
To Withdraw Troops

By Mack Woodward

In a special meeting Tuesday
evening, the Executive Committee
endorsed as a body the student-cir-
culated petition to cease United
States military involvement in Cam-
bodia.

The petition will be sent to Vir-
ginia’s two U.S. senators, Byrd and
Spong.

Several EC members had signed
the petition individually, but the
special meeting was called last night
to endorse the petition by the EC
as a whole.

In the vote to endorse the student
petition, Andrews cast the only dis
senting vote.

“The concern of the EC is not
just what goes on in this little mic-
rocosm,” said Dave Bethea at Mon-
day night's EC meeting with regard
to the motion he brought to the
floor concerning Freedom Day. The
motion in its original form called
for the EC to support Freedom
Day. Bethea felt that it was “the ob
ligation of the EC” to endorse such
a moon.

Fran Lawrence, president-clect ex
plained to the EC that the theory
behind the motion Bethea presenied
was one of involvement. “This is
happening so many places,” he e-
plained. President Swede Henberg
stated that people should be en
couraged to recognize Freedom Das
so they could become more aware
of what was happening. Alan Pra
ter's repfy to this was, “If to par
ticipaie is to become more aware.
then why don't we strike and go
talk to Air Force or Peace Corp
representatives? Why should we
take a stand?”

After several minutes of
Vice President Phil Thompson re
quested that an amendment be add
ed to the motion which would stale

the EC’s opposition to interference
with students’ class attendance. This
motion to amend was seconded by
Andrews. The amendment was
adopted unanimously, as was the
amended motion.

In its final form, the motion re-
solves that the EC “calls attention
to Freedom Day activities” but sup-
ports the resolution “only to the ex-
tent that individuals be allowed to
exercise their own consciences with-
out physical or psychological intimi-
dation.”

Touching upon a matter of vital
interest to students, Swede Henberg
informed the EC that the Lexing-
ton City Council will vole tomorrow
on a student property tax and car
tax. Dean John had recommended
to him that the EC send several rep-
reseniatives to the meeting to op-
pose the tax in the interest of the
student body, rather than have a
crowd of unorganized protestors.

Henberg said that he would go,
and requested that Thompson,
Tompkins, and Ogilvie accompany
him. Dean Kumpuris remarked that
“a real nice boycott could be or-
ganized” if the tax should pass.

The EC went into closed session
last night to discuss the problem of
having Mock Convention Co-Chair

to protest scheduled classes today in
order that students might be free to
go to the University of Virginia to
attend rallies occasioned by the re-
cent U.S. involvement in Cambodia.

Several professors called off their
classes in support of the strike; but
Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said that he could see no marked
shift in class attendance, though “it’s
hard to tell at this point.”

The pickets remained on campus
until 10:00, when they left to pre-
pare to travel to the Charlotiesville
campus to attend strike rallies held
this afternoon.

“Our purpose here tonight is not
to burn, but to build this univer-
sity,” said senior Jeff Gingold, or-
ganizer for the Strike Rally which
met in front of Lee Chapel last
night.

A gathering of 300 to 400 inter-
ested students sat on the lawn in
front of Lee Chapel to hear remarks
from Gingold, other W&L students,
two University of Virginia student
strike leaders, two faculty members
and University President Robert E.
R. Huntley.

The group assembled on the lawn
at 7 p.m. to hear a brief concert by
“Cancer,” a student combo,

At 7:30, the speeches began with
prefatory remarks from Gingold,
who stated the purpose of the Wed-
nesday strike.

“We want to shut down the
school so that all students will be
able to go up to Charlottesville and
learn a little something.”

In reaction to rumors of probable
violence during the strike, Gingold
said that the demonstration would
be intended as a peaceful expression
of student convictions. Student pic-
ket lines would only be organized as
a passive manifestation of the belief
thaet the University should suspend
classes for the University of Vir-
ginia occasion.

Gingold outlined the program at
the University of Virginia for which
the strike was called. Jerry Rubin,
one of the nationally known “Chic-
ago Seven”, and William Kunstler,
attorney for the group, will be
speakers at rallies to be held on the
Charlottesville campus this after-

noon and tonight. According to Gin-

“I want to try to get away from ‘Supreme Court interpretations,’ "

gold, suspended classes would per-
mit all students who are interested
in the Charlottesville rally to at-
tend.

After several W&L students out-
lined their beliefs on the new mili-
lary involvement in Cambodia and
the recent death of four students at
Kent State University, two speakers
from the University of Virginia
characterized the agenda for today’s
“Strike” rallies in Charlottesville.

One of the faculty asked to speak
for the rally, politics instructor Paul
Corcoran vocalized his concern at
“the fact that America is devoted to
a policy of killing people.”

Seeing the student response to the
war issue as “growing,” Corcoran
made a distinction between what he
called “personal” and “political” re-
volt.

“In a personal revolution,” Cor-
coran commented, “One has moral
decisions which he must make;
whereas, often in a political revolu-
tion, you are forced to pay the price
of politics,”

President Huntley appeared at the
gathering to address the crowd, ex-
plaining that his open letter to the
Washington and Lee community
was not directed towards the rally
that evening or the strike this morn-
ing, but towards a growing diver-
gent attitude within the community.

Speaking in terms of the educa-
tional function of Washington and
Lee, Huntley felt that “we must all
attempt to walk the tightrope be
tween chaos on one hand and
streamlined efficiency on the other.”

Calling on the audience for a
sense of community, the Presiedni

asked, “I call on you, from what-
ever faction you are in, to share
your deep convictions with those

who would ordinarily share theirs
with you,”

[he rally concluded with brie!
remarks from Henry Sloss, English
instructor, and Jeff Gingold, who
called on all interested students to
participate in the picket lines which
formed this morning.

Text Of President’s Open Letter

(Editor's Note: The following is the
text of an open letter submitted to
the Washington and Lee community
yesterday by President Robert E. R.
Huntley.)

The Washington and Lee com-
munity is fully aware of the deep
concern generated by recent events
that is tearing the fabric of many
colleges and universities across the
nation, Washington and Lee is not
indifferent to these events and un-
derstands the differences of opinion
and high emotions that they give
rise to. The ideal of this University
is to provide a setting and an atmos-
phere where men can reason to-
gether, learn from one another, and
share points of view—no matier
how emotionally charged—without
rancor and in a spirit of tolerance
and good will—to the end that men
might understand truly and well the
complexities of the issues confront-
ing us.

The barriers that threaten to di-
vide us as a nation must not find
their counterpart in barriers divid-
ing us as a community. I refer to

the barriers behind which men re
treat in intellectual and moral isola-
tion when they have somehow con
vinced themselves of the infallible
correctness of their own views and
the base hypocrisy of all others, an
isolation which is characterized by
a fear of sharing one’s deepest con-
victions with any save those who are
known to agree. | know

Legislating Moral Judgments

If you just want to sit here in a vacuum

and discuss the constitution .. .
—John Markham

That’s just what I want to do.
—Drew Kumpuris

Kudos to the EC. It is noble enough to admit a sin has
been committed, but it is even more noble to atone for that
sin. In a special meeting last Thursday night, the EC admitted
its error in judgment and reversed its ruling regarding Ann
Red’s candidacy. Inconsistency with the constitution was cited
as the basis for the reversal.

This display of wisdom on the part of the Executive Com-
mittee was prompted by freshman Alan Prater. The denial
of her candidacy on constitutional grounds stands as a major
victory for those members of the student body and the Exe-
cutive Committee who are still interested in the operation of
student government according to traditional and legal prin-
ciples. One function of the EC is to govern under the con-
stitution as it now reads, and, thankfully, a majority of that
group had the presence of mind to realize this Thursday
night.

the Markham, Dave Bethea, and Glenn Azuma, who
evidently do not acknowledge this duty vis-a-vis their votes
on behalf of Miss Red, might, perhaps, have had a point in
their concern for a more effective integration of exchange
students into our community by allowing them to run for
office. But the EC was simply not in the position in this
particular case to permit her, contrary to the constitution, to
seek the office of class president.

The question at hand Thursday night was, in fact, con-
stitutional. If the student body wants exchange students to be
able to run for office—a problem that could not have been
foreseen when the constitution was drafted—then the prero-
gative rests in the student body to alter the constitution in a
referendum. The EC must not be given the freedom to usurp
the power to amend the constitution by executive fiat, as it in
effect tried to do earlier last week until its ruling was challeng-
ed by a significant number of students.

A less obvious but decidedly pernicious danger lies be-
neath the Ann Red case. If her name had been allowed on
the ballot in violation of the constitution, suppose the EC
decided to ignore the constitution on the matter of enforcing
the honor system? Or, to put this argument in more concrete
terms, would the faculty acquiesce in an independent exam
schedule in the absence of the honor system?

Swede Henberg expressed perhaps even a more frighten-
ing attitude than the one to bypass the constitution, which
might have been dictated by the exigencies of time, since it is
unlikely a constitutional referendum could have been staged
before Monday’s elections. In the regular meeting on April
27, although he abstained as chairman, Henberg made his
opposition to Miss Red’s candidacy clear. In Thursday’s meet-
ing, however, Henberg seemed more concerned about the
fact that the EC would reverse its previous position than that
the proper action was being taken. Fortunately, Thompson’s
plea for responsibility to the student body countered this la-
ment for the EC’s image.

Several suggestions seem evident at this juncture. First,
there should be a constitutional referendum to decide the
matter of exchange students’ participation in student gov-
ernment. Second, the EC should make a more conscientious
effort to govern wisely so that its reputation does not plummet
into the abyss of discredit. We have good reason to believe
that this is already happening. But, is it any wonder?

We spoke last week, for example, with a junior who said
he asked another student at a balloting box for whom he
should vote, and then “just for the hell of it, I voted the
other way.” When we questioned this student about his at-
titude, he pointedly remarked that it seemed to him that this
year’s EC has done nothing for the students. While this state-
ment may not be true in its absolute sense, it does have con-
siderable merit, Relatively too much time was spent by the
EC in legislating their own moral judgments, and not enough
effort was expended on more immediate student concerns.
The first vote on Miss Red’s candidacy and the plunges into
long range administration affairs such as admissions policy—
a point on which that student questioned the credentials of
the EC-—are lucid examples supporting this criticism. Then
he asked, “Did the EC make a single recommendation con-
cerning the parking problem?”

A bit mundane? Perhaps. But after listening to the EC
last week and all year, perhaps not.

This student also offered some suggestions which the
new EC and class officers might do well to read. He asked:
how many times has any EC member made any effort to dis-
cuss with students in general what they want? How many
class officers called class meetings last year? Or the year be-
fore? Maybe this student is correct in his assessment and
“student government” is a joke. We doubt it, but we can
only speculate: suppose the EC had been less concerned with
acting properly last week.

By Dr. Arthur Scharff
Professor of Romance Languages

Washington & Lee’s foreign study
program has (hurray!) finally been
approved. This arouses misty remin-
iscences in those of us who still re-
main from the line when one’s “pro-
gram” was his determination—or,
nerve—to acquire knowledge, and
not much else. For many of us who
studied abroad in those ancient days
prior to World War II, there is a
certain nostalgia for the times when
“seeking” an education meant just
that. You had to find out where it
was and then seize it while the time
was still ripe.

My first contact with the Sorbonne
consisted of walking into a seeming-
ly deserted, dirty grey building
where the bright sunlight outside
vanished when the door swung shut.
This meeting proved completely
fruitless except for the appreciation
of a few architectural features, It
was only later that I learned that the
concierge’s loge (which always ap-
pears deserted until you pull the
bell cord) was the other place to
buy the Livre d’Etudiant, if one
didn't know enough to go to the
right bookstore—and this one didn’t.

My “orientation program” consist-
ed of running into an American
from Colorado whom I had never
seen before but who had a French
friend who was already matriculated
and willing to take the time to give
us Mark Twain innocents a few
pointers. You bought yourself a
book for a few francs, looked over
the course offerings, selected those
you thought you would like to take
(Prerequisite: the ability to under-
stand what the lecturer was talking
about), and optimistically went over
to matriculate.

Matriculation consisted mostly of
standing in long lines and paying an
infinitesimal fee, about $12.50 at
that time. Up to this point I had not
to my conscious knowledge so much
as glimpsed anyone above the cleri-
cal level, and no one had raised any
objections to anything other than
my handwriting. The days of over-
crowded classrooms and waiting in
the halls to hear lectures were far in
the future. In fact, no one had
shown any particular interest in me
at all.

Later, I learned that the book on
which I had based my choices was
put out by a_ private publisher, and
that the information given in it was
obtained directly from the profes-
sors, who were perfectly free to give
it or not and to change it subse-
quently at will, Academic freedom
applied to the faculty as well as to
the students, Some courses listed
were not given at all; the professor
had changed his mind. Others were
given at another time or another
place; the professor found it more
convenient that way. You might or
might not be notified of these
changes. See what I mean by seek-
ing an education?

The next question to occupy the
prospective student's mind was where
to live and to eat. The University
hardly entered into this at all. The
concierge did keep a list of those
persons who had taken the trouble
to tell her that they rented rooms to
students, but the list was likely to be
a year old and no guarantees were
made. There were Restaurants Etu-

diantins, none of them run by the
University, none supervised by any-
thing other than economic competi-
tion, none particularly good or par-
ticularly generous.

Whether you lived in a mansarde
(originally designed for domestics
who were just short of slave labor)
with a cold water top and an Arab
toilet two floors below, or took one
of the relatively luxurious rooms at
the Cite Universitaire several miles
away, was your decision—and your
pocketbook’s.

The next shock came in realizing
that there were practically no quiz-
zes, no assignments, no attendance
records, and that the professors had
no office hours—not for students
anyhow. If you needed help you
went out and tried to find it. Some
professors were glad to talk at their
convenience, and some you never
saw after they descended from the
rostrum. The only time anyone
other than you knew how you were
getting along in your studies was
after the examinations, which in
most cases took place after several
years of study. You acquired knowl-
edge for a general examination
which covered your entire field, and
sometimes more. These generally
lasted a week or more and many of
them were oral. Language problem?
Yes, there was. It was yours.

Were there rewards? There cer-
tainly were: learning. You sought

Plans Under

By Greg Thompson

David B. Dickens, an associate
German professor who heads the
WAL Foreign Study Committee, has
announced tht final questions con-
cerning the W&L Foreign Study
Program have been resolved. In the
company of Francis Drake, a
French professor, and Jim Williams,
an associate Spanish professor, Dic-
kens will go to Europe to set up
programs in France, Spain, and Ger-
many. The program is planned for
the six-week Spring term.

The Study Abroad Programs will
be listed as French 202, Germas
263, and Spanish 202. The mini-
mum enroliment for each program
will be ten, while the maximum en-
rollment will be limited to fifteen
Each participant must have a cumu-

’

loose, and then it was yours. It
might be that you would be the
only one to know that it was yours,
however. The significant difference
in the situation was the social atti-
tude toward education: it was a pri-
vilege not allowed to everyone. The
University provided it and you
paid, not in cash but in your efforts.

Did anyone care if you didn't get
it? Presumably, you, your family,
your friends and your future em-
ployers did, for it was a great dis-
grace to fail your exams. The Uni-
versity expressed, however, no opin-
ion other than that you had not se-
cured sufficient knowledge to receive
its certification. How you acquired
that knowledge or why you had
failed to acquire it was no parti-
cular concern of Alma Mater. She
was not in loco parentis,

Did you make friends under such
a system? Yes, and sometimes more
firmly because friendships were
founded on your own efforts rather
than mere juxtaposition. There were
student organizations, academic,
political, social and otherwise. None
of them were approved or disap-
proved by the University. The Uni-
versity was not blamed for their
actions nor was it praised for their
achievements. One belonged or not
according to his desires and abilities,
and if the organizbation wanted his
contribution.

The system was by no means per-
fect. The big bugaboo was always

loneliness. No one sought you out
except the prostitutes on the Boul’
Mich. If you did not make an effori
you remained alone, terribly alone.
You were constantly faced with de-
cisions on everything from what to
study (assignments were rarely speci:
fic and where to find the material
was your problem) to what you
could afford for dinner, Failure was
just a step behind you always, Only
you yourself knew how you stood
and you might be wrong. The day of
reckoning was far in the future but
inexorable when it did arrive.

In short, the system had all the
disadvantages of freedom, a boon to
those who were ready for it but a
fatal plunge into the abyss for those
who were not prepared for it or
could not cope with it. Many fell by
the wayside. Isn't that a real life
situation? A University education
was a privilege, not a gift. Only the
fit and the deserving could grasp it
even when it was offered.

Perhaps it is better this way...

‘Sacrificial Ram’
Opens Tonight
At The Troubs

“The Sacrificial Ram,” a new
script written by senior William
Biddle from Phoenixville, Pa., opens
tonight at 8 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre.

The production of Biddle’s new
play marks the third “Spotlight”
production in as many years. Fast
becoming a tradition at the Trouba-
dour Theatre, the “Spotlight” pro-
ductions are one facet of professor
Lee Kahn's effort to encourage stu-
dent participation in all areas of
theatre.

“We don’t just want the students
on the stage,” says Kahn, “We'd like
to offer them the opportunity to try
their hand at making a play as well
as acting in one.”

Biddle’s play, “The Sacrificial
Ram,” presents a panorama of
timely problems, according to the
play's director, David Waelder.
Waelder, a drama major who is di-
recting the show for his senior thesis
production, comments that “the play

In addition, each student must
receive approval from three differ-

The $900 is a maximum figure—it

sents itself. In a letter to the For-
eign Language Departments, Mr.

On The IFC’s Future
lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In last week's Ring-tum Phi, an
editorial “Ask Not For Whom The
Bell Tolls” challenged the frater-
nities and the IFC to recognize and
overcome the problems which have
plagued the fraternity system in the
past and which now threaten to des-
troy it.

In response to this challenge, |
will try to show what steps the In-
terfraternity Council is taking to
solve these problems.

Last winter the IFC appointed a
special committee to study what it
felt were the most pressing prob-
lems facing the fraternity system at
Washington and Lee. Under the
leadership of Jim Mathews and
Danny Leonard, the committee re-
searched six areas—structure of the
IFC, social. academics, house con-
struction, laber, and food buying—
in an effort te find ways to increase
the effectiveness of the IFC, lower
the cost of fraternity living and gen-
erally make fraternity life more de-
sirable

The committee's report, which
was published this week, sets up de-
finite guidelines by which frater-
nities can accomplish these ends.

Although the proposals recom-
mended by the committee are too
detailed to mention here, in essence
they focus upon increasing the par-
ticipation and cooperation through-
out all levels of the fraternity struc-
ture. In this way, the sectionalism
and politics, which have impaired
the effectiveness of the IFC, can
hopefully be cast aside.

If and when the Interfraternity
Council adopts the proposals of this
committee as part of its course of
action for next year, they will have
taken the first giant step toward
strengthening the fraternity system
and answering the challenge of the
future.

"A Lack of Respect”

to The Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

The actions of students before the
strike called for today show a com
plete lack of respect for the rights
and privileges of Washington and
Lee students,

Several of my friends posted
hand-made signs on bulletin boards
(approved locations) not on trees,
colonnade walls, etc, calling for
claws attendance today and non-sup
port of the strikers, At no time did
this group remove publications by

other persons advertising their in-
terests, Between the time these were
posted and the arrival of school
custodians Tuesday morning, most
of these signs had been removed!

The obvious conclusion to us is
that although the strikers have a
right to publicity and protest, those
whe oppose them do not have this
right, This is the type of tyranny
that neither radical nor reactionary
should tolerate.

John Motsinger, 1970 C

On Flag Flying

Dear Sirs:

| would like to call attention to a
“minor incident” which took place
yesterday morning. A few friends
and | decided that we would like to
observe the strike by hanging an in-
verted American flag emblazoned
with a “strike fist,” from our sec-
end dorm window, overlooking the
Quad, It was our intention to show
our sympathy and support for the
strike at WAL, by displaying the in-
verted flag, a symbol of national dis-
tress,

The flag was put up about 2:30
Tuesday morning; by 9 a.m. Tues-
day the flag had been taken down
by Dean John and “unknown” stu-
denis,

The key to this “incident” lies in
the manner in which the flag was re-
moved, Dean John appeared at my

be paid in addition to normal tui-
tion for the entire year,”

Prior to the six-weeks abroad,
there will be a campus orientation
period during the week of Spring
vacation. Activities during this per-
iod will include oral drill with the
language, group meals, and informal
sessions after a film.

In the first week of the six week
term there will be a period of for-
mal campus orientation, During this
time, students will be able to plan
their independent projects with their
advisers and continue intensive oral
language drill. Furthermore, partici-
pants will have the opportunity to
hear speakers such as embassy per-
sonnel. Films and slides will be
shown, while language discussions
concerning such topics as foreign
dramatic works will take place.

During his study abroad, each
participant will stay with a foreign
family. There may be some group
gatherings whereby each siudent
would be able to meet the families
of other participants,

Messrs, Williams, Drake, and
Dickens will provide academic sup-
ervision for the programs in Spain,
France, and Germany respectively.
Their specific task will be to super-
vise each student's individual pro-
ject; they would find the necessary
resources for the students’ projects,
A regular class schedule will be set
up for that part of the program
which calls for language work.
Classes will be taught by either a
U.S. faculty representative or a
local professor.

Students involved in the program
will receive six academic credits—
three for language work and three
for project in the case of the stu-
dent who is not majoring in a langu
age. Depending upon the situation,
the appointment of credit might be
changed.

Group excursions such as theatre
visits or even weekend tours will be
included in the program. The pro-
gram will be concluded with a trip
in a section of the country concern-
ed; or a short excursion through a
country of related culture could be
arranged

Participanis will not be consider-

ed as enrolled in a foreien univer
sity, but they will have university
facilities at their disposal, Dickens
stated that it is not known yet which
universities will be part of the pro

gram. That and other details will by

“Horses”: Another Alienated Hero

By Steve Haughney

There is an odd similarity among
many of the strongest box-office hits
of the past few years. “The Gradu-
ate”, “Bonnie and Clyde,” “Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,”
“Easy Rider”’—all present an alie-
nated hero wandering in search of
an undefined goal while practicing a
life-style outside the bounds of an
equally undefined American way of
life.

It is evident that the American
film industry is making a lot of
money by playing on hopes and
fears firmly entrenched in our minds.
Most of us still believe that the
“pursuit of happiness,” the search
for utopia, is an inalienable right;
but most of us also feel that Some-
thing, be it the Establishment, the
Communist conspiracy, or Mr. Ag-
new, bars the way.

“They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?”
offers a variation on this theme. The
scene is California, the Land of Op-
portunity, in 1932 with the Depres-
sion at its worst. Michael Sarrazin,
who plays the wandering hero, en-
ters a marathon dance contest hop
ing to win the $1000 prize and with
it respite from the starvation which
threatens him.

The contest, from the preliminary
medical examination to the final
shuffle around the dance floor, is by
no means the ticket to security and
freedom that Sarrazin and the rest
of the contestants had hoped it
would be, But in spite of the fact
that the contestants are treated like
cattle, they continue to believe that
“prosperity is just around the cor-
ner,” that they can “make it” if they
just hold out long enough.

Gig Young, who plays the contest
announcer, is free of this delusion
and realizes that the contestants are
being used to stage a spectacle so
that those who come to watch can
feel relieved that someone is worse
off than they.

Young deserves his Oscar for a
standout performance in a role that
is far more exciting than his usual
portrayal of a sophisticated bon
vivant, Sarrazin and Jane Fonda,
who plays his dance partner, are
very convincing as they gradually
come to understand the futility of
their hopes and the cruel facts of
their situation.

Even Red Buttons performs well,
as shocking as that may sound. The
acting in general saves the movie

The camera work is not of the
spectacular variety as Director Sid-

plague movies on this theme.

The final demise of Sarrazin and
Fonda is inevitable, but nevertheless
shocking and disheartening for their
utopian dream is only that they be
allowed to survive. But it is the un-
specified “they” of the title which,
predictably, has that luxury. “They
Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” is a
depressing movie, but it is worth
seeing even if the story is a familiar
one.

By Greg Raetz

Each spring the Washington and
Lee campus goes through a rather
unsightly metamorphosis. Granted
the dogwoods bloom, the trees and
grass become green, and the air is
fresh and warm, but the natural
beauty and the dignity of the colon-
nade, in particular, and the campus,
in general, are blighted nonetheless.

The blight is due partly to the un-
savory appearance of some of the
student body and faculty, and partly
to their unbecoming habits. One
eyesore is the sunbathing that goes
on in front of the colonnade. There
is nothing wrong with sunbathing
per se, but it seems that those who
chose to lie out in the sun could
find a more appropriate place.

The beauty and dignity of The
Hill should not be marred by these
white, half naked, and haphazardly
strewn forms. Aren't these heliola-
tors just as guilty of pollution as the
junkyard dealers who own the old
cars that are rusting on hillsides
around the country?

There are other daily occurrances
on The Hill which deserve some
criticism. For example, the sight of
professors throwing what appear to
be brass balls around the lawn is,
to say the least, eye-catching. Again

Through A Spyglass, Darkly .. .

The Beauty Of Spring

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

the criticism is not so much that
professors are throwing balls around,
but rather concerns the areas they
have chosen to throw them. There
are places for athletic activities just
as there are locations for sunbath-
ing. The place, however, is not The
Hill.

These criticisms, and many more
which could be made, may seem
petty. They would be except that
they indicate a fundamental defici-
ency in all too many people on this
campus. A sense of dignity is lack-
ing.

Five years ago conventional dress,
the speaking tradition, and walking
on the pathways (Alas, now we have
sunbathers and ball players) were
honored traditions. Today they are
all but dead. Some faculty now even
refuse to wear coat and tie. As tradi-
tion has declined so has our sense
of dignity.

The depths to which these ideals
have fallen can be illustrated by a
statement that can be attributed to
our student body president-elect. At
a fraternity house during the elec-
tion he informed the somewhat
startled and appalled membership
how great it felt not to wash or
change clothes for four days. It’s
funny how the new left calls the
establishment pigs.

   

 

Hoffman’s Almanack

By Betty Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

I have a queasy feeling that this
week is going to be one of those
time/place points, like Pearl Har-
bor, Dallas, Birmingham and Chic-
ago. No one needs to date them—
just locate them. What better time
to stop and listen, really listen, to
one of the wilder spokesman for the
militant young people. I have just
finished reading “Revolution for
the Hell of It!” by Abbie Hoffman.

Abbie Hoffman was born “with
the gift of laughter and a sense of
the world was mad.” The art of the
put-ons an acute sense of the liv-
ing uses of theatres have been used
by Hoffman to dramatize his opposi-
tion to our materialistic society.

He has succeeded beyond his
wildest expectations. In a technolo-
gical age, with machines to do the
work, everything should be free—
FREE. Abbie has gotten hundreds

of thousands of dollars of television
exposure absolutely free. He is a
master of manipulation of the news
media. Some wild antics—he calls
them creativity-and the cameras
zoom in on him.

The very title of the book is part
of the put-on. Revolution, yes, but
let's have some fun while we're do-
ing it, he says.

A series of short articles com-
prise the bulk of the book—dating
from back in March 1967-covering
some of the more flamboyant hap-
penings that Hoffman was involved
in. The pages are liberally sprinkled
with obscenities, but if this upsets
you, score a point for Abbie.

Some of the early writings seem-
ed dated to even a “middle class li-
beral” like me, but when he reaches
the days and nights of Chicago, the
book takes on a intensity which
brings the sights and smells and
sounds of Lincoln Park into the
room. Grass and LSD have roles in
Hoffman's impromptu life play (pun
intended,) and property is held in
total disrespect.

Make no mistake about it—be-
hind the cut-up is a very serious

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

By Jim Hooker

Washington and Lee finally has
a team that each individual, whether
he knows the game or not, can and
should be proud of. In a game
which was packed with emotion
both in the stands and on the field,
we were treated to a brilliant display
which has brought our team from
the mediocrity of their spring per-
formances to the status of one of
the top teams in the nation.

There was no doubt that UNC
came here to destroy the high flying
Generals. They have an All-America
attackman in Harper Peterson who
they can always go to in the clutch.
They have the winner of the 1969
Nation’s Outstanding Goalie award.
They are ranked eighth in the na-
tion while we are mentioned in the
top fourteen. We were seeking stat-
us and respectful acceptance for
what had shaped up to be one of
the finest trigger happy stick groups
to ever grace our institution.

But then like a nightmare, the
Tarheels from the South swarmed
all over us, seemingly without
mercy and exuding in confidence.
After all, they had beaten or rather
systematically demolished the same
Towson State team we had lost to
11-7 by a 12-0 count.

The first half was like a rude
awakening. North Carolina was to
be a large stepping stone, With na-
tional recognition in the balance,
WA&L seemed to lack the business-
like professionalism that they had
shown in previous trials.

Carolina took advantage of this
and quickly jumped off to a 1-0
lead. All of a sudden everything
seemed gloomy. We had needed to
score first to get things going. Every-
one seemed to be wary of the power-
ful Carolina team which had lost to
Maryland by only 10-8. Minutes
later, however, it was all tied up
by a bouncing slap shot off the stick
of senior crease attackman Tom
Groton.

But for the Generals that was all.
North Carolina led by Kramer,
Peterson, and Seipp turned it on.
Our bad breaks and misplays fur-
nished them with enough opportun-
ity to go ahead by a 6-1 score. It
was Kramer, however, who must be
cited for the unbelievable job he
did in the goal. Kramer held the
team together. He made saves on
shots that should have been scores.
He slowed the game down on clears
and literally led his team from one
end of the field to the other. He dis-
played all of the qualities that have
made him the best and then some.

When the field was cleared for
half time, there was a silent mur-
mur which ran throughout indicat-
ing an attitude of defeat. The score
stood at 6-1 and yet we had outshot
them 20-16. What had gone wrong?
The most important game of the
year seemed out of reach. The fans
seemed to be only staying on as a
token gesture for the team which
had come from a 1-8 record last
year to what was a 7-1 record be-
fore Saturday afternoon.

The team came back prepared,
though. With Morrill, whose mid-
field could be one of the best if not
the best in the nation led the Gen-
erals stunning second half come-
back on a low right handed bullet
rifled into the lower right corner of
the goal with an assist from fellow
middie Chip Tompkins. Suddenly,
the invincible Kramer, who had
been elevated in everyone's eyes to
semi-god, was found to have a weak
point: he could be scored upon.
Tompkins came right back from his
feed to pick up a goal on a Scott
Neese assist.

Entire third quarter play was
dominated by the Generals. The ball
hardly managed to change ends of
the field. What must be noted here
is the outstanding job that Bill
Brumback did on Peterson. Brum-
back was all over Peterson, never
once leaving his side. With their

biggest gun in check, Carolina’s of
fense seemed to lack the position
and firepower to generate any kind
of scoring to thwart the oncoming
Generals. The third quarter ended
with W&L taking six close shots a!
most in succession at the tenacious
Kramer.

The fourth quarter has to be as
exciting a period of play as could
ever happen in modern sporis. Tom
Groton dropped in a quick one
through the middle from Scott Neese
who was doing a brilliant job of
getting away from his defenseman.

Then Sam Englehart, the Mary-
land scoring ace who had been held
scoreless to this point, got in the
act by firing a Slauson feed into the
corner. He did not stop here how-
ever. Minutes later, on another pa-
tented shot, he poured in the tying
goal. The Generals were on fire,
and it seemed as if no one could
stop them, Then the unbelievable
happened.

Neese, rolling back and forth be-
hind the goal, finally circled it and
fired the go-ahead goal with less
than four minutes left to play. It is
unfortunate that the game could
not have ended here. Carolina was
too good a team to fall part in the
clutch, Peterson, whose whole day
had been made miserable by the
shadow of Bill Brumback, fired a
rocket past Bill Ingersol. On the
play, Peterson was flattened by
Brumback and had to be taken from
the game. Then it happened.

Carolina scored the final goal
with 1:19 left to play. The crowd
which had been hysterical through-
out the game fell silent. And when
it ended, the crowd stood not to
leave but to cheer the two teams.

It would be unfair not to men-
tion the unheralded contributions

 

In a tight situation, Sam Englehart fires for the corner against Pete Kra-

mer of UNC, The Generals dropped the 8-7 thriller on Saturday,

this year. Hank Slauson is one of
the most exciting players there is to
watch; Bob Brumback, whose cool
consistency and alert playing have
made him one of the top scorers
and ground-ballers; and the defense
which has done an impressive job
of protecting Ingersol all season—
and this is not to mention Ingersol’s
spectacular play. The team is a
team in the finest sense of the word.
rhe Generals meet the University

Generals Off To Sewanee
To Bring Back CAC Bell cu

On Thursday, the Generals travel
to Sewanee to take up the last leg
in CAC competition. Presently,
W&L is a hair's breath behind
Washington University and has a
substantial lead over the other con
tenders. “At this point, it’s a two
way race for the Conference Bell,”
said Gene Corrigan. ‘We've got to
be tough to defeat Washingior in
the overall.”

The baseball, tennis. and
track teams will be competing in the
most important display of our abil-
ity in “total sports,”

Che baseball team, which has had
a poor showing this year is planning
on pulling this tournament out of

goif,

the fire. “The baseball team has
great potential; they can hit and
field extremely well,” said Corri-

gan. If everything goes well, the
team’s confidence will surely be re-
warded,

The track team will find tough

that we will be at some advantage
with other teams competing because
teams will be recompensed on merit
and not depth.

Canfield’s tennis team is expected
to destroy everyone on the courts in
the tourney. Having only lost to
Duke and U.Va. in eleven outings,
there seems little chance of the
team’s not winning, but it will not
be a runaway by any means.

[he golf team under Coaches
Iwombly and Leslie takes a 3-2-2
record to the 36 hole CAC tourna-
ment. Last year’s tournament cham
pion, The University of the South,
is the pre-tournament favorite and
they have a strong home course ad-
vantage. After two early losses, the
team has been playing well and feels
confident that it will improve on last
year’s third place finish.

It will take a collective effort by
all teams to win the overall honors,

Goshen Classic Set;
Free Beer Provided

“Tubing,” or shooting rapids in
inner tubes, has long been a popular
sport at Washington and Lee. In
fact, one might almost call it a tra-
dition. This year, the Fourth Annual
Goshen Classic White Water Tubing
Contest will be held on Saturday,
May 9 at 2 p.m. at Goshen Pass on
the Maury River.

This year there will be three
events: the President’s Trophy Race,
Open to any member of the W&L
faculty or administration; the Pow-
derpuff Sweepstakes, open to all
females; and the Downriver Grand
Slalom, open to all male students
attending NCAA colleges.

Last year, entries ranged from

Virginia schools to the University of
Kansas. Unfortunately the Powder-
puff Sweepstakes had no entries and
the only entry to the President’s
Trophy Race was disqualified. But
in the Downhill Grand Slalom, com-
petition was intense, as Herald
Bowes (SPE) won the event with a
time of 32:15, followed by Bill Wil-
son (Lambda Chi) with a time of
33:03. Lambda Chi won the team
title with a combined time of 68:18.
Runner-up was SPE, compiling a
70:00 time.

Prizes to be awarded this year
will include a swimsuit, a McMullin
blouse, and a teakwood ice bucket,

On Flag Flying

with the “students.” He attempted to
wake my roommate who, having
spent most of the night helping to
prepare the flag, was unable to be
stirred.

Dean John then instructed the
“students” to remove the flag,
which they did, ripping the flag “ac-
cidentally,” in the process. It was at
this time that another student, the
actual owner of the flag, came back
to the dorms. He was informed by
Dean John that the “owner” (of the
flag) was aware of the Dean’s pre-
sent actions. The owner, Dean John
was referring to was my roommate,
whom he had failed to awaken.

The fact that Dean John errone-
ously assumed that, since the flag
hung from our room, it was ours, is
excusable, The fact that he proceed-
ed to remove the flag without the
supposed owner's permission is inex-
cusable.

Dean John agreed with us on the
dubious manner in which the flag
was taken down. When the four of
us involved discussed the matter
with him, he apologized to us for
his method, and cited three reasons
for his actions:

1) Since inverting the flag might
be considered desecration of the flag,
hence a violation of the law, he re-
moved it himself to avoid having
police on campus.

2) He informed us that early
fuesday four or five students said
to him that if the flag was not re-
moved, they would “tear it down
themselves!” He further mentioned
that another small group of students
had gone to Dean Pusey on this
same matter. He felt that by remov-
ing the flag himself, he would avoid
an “incident” between us.

3) Finally, he indicated that he
himself felt that the use of the flag
was in poor taste and showed a lack
of descretion.

Perhaps the flag. as a symbol of
protest, is wrong. However, let no
one be deceived into believing that
the flag flying “properly” over
America today represents the views
of a united, satisfied country.

contacted Dean Lewis John in at-
tempt to clarify the citation of sev-
eral facts in the above letter. Dean
Jobn informed us that be had two
courses of action to take in the face
of veiled student threats of reaction
to the flag's display: he could have
either called the local police to in-
vestigate the matter, which he felt
would have probably resulied in an
arrest of a student, or he could have
the flag in question removed himself.
He told The Ring-tum Phi that he
had instructed the custedians of the
fresimen dorms to oversee the rest
of the posters in the area to insure
that they would not be destroyed.
Concerning the matter of the flag's
owner, Dean John stated that he
made what he considered a valid as-
sumption at the time: the flag dis-
played in the window belonged to
the resident of the reom.)

Law School Elects Slay;
SBA Chooses Hartmann

Rising senior law student Jim
Slay, campaigning as a “hard-line”
defender of the honor system, was
elected Monday morning as senior
law school representative to the EC.

In other elections, rising senior
Rob Hartmann was chosen to suc-
ceed Bev Read as president of the
Student Bar Association for the
coming semester. Tom Baker was
elected vice-president of the SBA,
and Jack King was picked for the
position of treasurer. Jim Philpott,
the only rising second-year man
elected to office, won the contest for
secretary.

Slay, a 1965 WA&L graduate, led
a field of four candidates on the
first ballot and defeated Bill Walker,
who expressed a qualified interest in
proposals to modify the honor sys-
tem penalty, in a runoff. Speaking
before the vote, Slay strongly sup-
ported the present system and said
that if the student body were to
weaken it, he would be in favor of
establishing a separate honor system
for the law school.

President-elect Hartmann has
been president of his class for two
years in a row. He was a member
of this year’s regional champion
Moot Court team, and is presently
working for the W&L Law Review.

Also voted on at Monday's elec-
tion meeting were three proposed
amendments to the SBA constitu-
tion. The association agreed to
change the membership of the Board
of Governors and to tighten control
of SBA funds, but rejected an
amendment which would have pre-
vented ex officio members of the
Board from serving as elected of-
ficers at the same time.

year, but that Silberberg had brush-
ed them aside. “There is a com-
munication gap,” admitted Silber-
berg.

Silberberg asked the EC for a
$300 summer budget. He was not
exactly sure how it was to be spent,
as there was no 1968 budget from
which to work.

Henberg denied Silberberg the
money until Silberberg and Gillespie
could present a more organized plan
as to responsibility and organiza-
tion. At this point, Gillespie said “I
don’t want to start a floor fight. It’s
been an unhealthy situation all year
because of throat cutting; we've
been working under the assumption
that one of us would be bagged at
the end of the year.”

Kumpuris requested that the re-
sponsibility be divided between the
two and some decision reached by
by the EC next week. Silberberg
said, “If you think you can run it
with two chairmen, that’s just
dandy.

In closed session, the EC decided
to allow Silberberg to retain the
position of Chairman, and to ap-
point Gillespie as head of the Steer-
ing Committee, as Silberberg had
earlier suggested.

EC Reverses On Ann Red Case

(Continued from Page 1)
Markham’s question prompted Dean Kumpuris to com-
ment, “I think we're going about it all wrong. Shouldn't
what we're doing be like the Supreme Court—inter-
preting the constitution we have here?”

Markham replied, “I want to try to get away from
‘Supreme Court interpretations.’ He added that stu-
dents in the exchange program were not asked “to
come here enthusiastically” and that “we have got to
have as many girls here as possible” if the exchange
program were to be “viable” on campus. Concluding his
defense of Monday night's ruling, Markham stated that
a “higher integration” in the exchange program would
be achieved if the EC were to allow any “girl who
wants to come up here to school to run for office.”

Drew Kumpuris picked up the argument with Mark-
ham over interpretation by commenting, “I don’t think
that if we don't let her run, coeducation will be set
back five years. It’s all a question of interpretation of
the constitution—if we get loose with that, we'll get

loose with everything else.”

Markham responded, “If you just want to sit here
in a vacuum and discuss the constitution .
remarks were cut off by Kumpuris’ reply, “That's just

what I want to do.”
After several other opinions had

basically reiterated these points, Drew Kumpuris asked,
“Do you think that when the constitution was written,
it was intended to mean that a person who was not a
member of their class could run for office?” Markham

called them, Each is for an eight
part chorus, brass ensemble and
continuo, These works are products
of the brilliant choral tradition that
developed at Sit. Mark’s Cathedral in
Venice in the seventeenth century,
and they demonstrate the vast
sounds and textures that are typical
of this style.

answered, “They probably didn’t want freshmen to
drive cars either, but times change.”

Finally, a motion was made to end discussion and
Prater presented his motion stating in effect that ex-
change students could not run for office in the student
body due to conflicts in the constitution. Andrews sec-
onded this motion, but then Markham moved to table
the motion indefinitely, and
tabling motion was soon withdrawn so that the ques-
tion could be decided.

Before the vote was taken, Henberg remarked, “It’s
unfortunate that we don’t have a full EC at this time.”
Thompson commented, “We, as the EC, assume respon-
sibility for all we do. It would be more irresponsible
for us not to overturn the motion if we feel we made a
mistake only to try to prevent from castigating our-

Faculty Permits Student Absenteeism

In a special meeting last night the

morally obligated, to absent them-

Text Of Resolution Before

(Editor’s Note: The following is the

text of a referendum resolution

drawn up by the ad hoc committee
which met in the University Center

Cockpit last night. Its content will

be put to a vote at 1:00 this after-

noon in the special student body
meeting in the front of Lee Chapel.)

Whereas: We the students of Wash-
ington and Lee desire to express
our concern over the present war
in Indochina, we intend to ex-
press this concern by joining with
our fellow students in this country
by closing Washington and Lee as
of May 11, 1970.

Through whatever channels the fac-
ulty deems necessary and with all
possible haste we urge that the
following be implemented:

1. Declare all classes cancelled
retroactive to May 6, until the
fall of 1970 and direct the univer-
sity towards the crisis in this
country.

2. As a substitute for classes, stu-
dents, teachers, and others inter-
ested will use the facilities of the
university to conduct seminars

and hold discussions open to
everyone on the economic, politi-
cal, philosophical, sociological,
etc., ramifications of the Indo-
china War.

In addition, it is hoped that the
educational experiences can aid in
exploring other problems — pre-
sent and potential — facing our
society and our world.

Whereas classes will have ended as
of May 11, 1970, it will be up to
the individual student to arrange
for grades on the following basis:
A student may opt for other (1)
grades in his present p/f and letter
combination or (2) all pass/fail
on work completed as of May 6,
1970.

Graduating seniors will not be
deemed to have completed their
requirements for graduation until
June 5, 1970.

Given the unique situation of the
law school and American Bar As-
sociation requirements, the stu-
dents of the law school may take
action they deem necessary to
meet their requirements.

graduate with their class and receive
their diplomas.

Any student can make arrange-
ments with his professor to take his
exams at any time until September
30.

A student can absent himself by
writing a letter stating his reasons
for temporary withdrawal to the
Faculty Executive Committee. Im-
mediately on receipt of that letter
by the Faculty EC, a student is con-
sidered to be absent.

This resolution stemmed from the
one adopted by the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee prior to the student
meeting in the University Center
yesterday afternoon.

In passing this resolution the fac-
ulty recognized the “sense of im-

mediate concern they (the students)
feel about major national issues.”
The faculty resolution also stated
that a student still will be considered
as enrolled at W&L under the ap-
proved program. For those students
who choose to stay on campus, the
faculty endorsed a program whereby
students will be able to study the
present national situation.

The resolution also noted that
“notwithstanding the depth of this
feeling of some students, the fac-
ulty does not believe that Washing-
ton and Lee classes should be sus-
pended or its educational respon-
sibility be abandoned.”

The resolution was a result of
three hours of deliberation by the
faculty and takes effect immediately.

campus who feel a moral obligation
to do “something in the real world,”

and faculty gathered in the Univer-

Another Side

(Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum Phi
offers this statement as an expres-
sion of an opposing view drafted by
a group of students which form the
“Committee To Keep The Univer-
sity Community Together.”)

Take a deep breath and count to
ten.

The radicals decided not to give
you until Monday to think over the
probable consequences of closing
down the University. Just stop a
minute and think.

Closing Washington and Lee for
a month is not like closing an ele-
mentary school three days for snow.

The faculty resolution allows
those who feel more immediate con-
cerns to postpone their school work.
The proposed student body, action,
is a cop-out. We cannot declare

relevant and simulanteously expect
the rest of the world to continue to
take it seriously.

isty Center Cockpit Thursday after-
noon to discuss the possibility of
the University’s allowing students to
leave school for the rest of this
semester.

“The purpose of this ad hoc com-
mittee,” said Fran Lawrence, presi-
dent-elect of the student body, “is
to have an open discussion about
what we want the faculty to do
about suspension of classes.”

Staman Ogilvie, junior EC mem-
ber, informed the group that the
faculty Executive Committee was in
session at the time, and had called
a special meeting of the faculty,
which was held last night.

At 6 p.m. the meeting in the
Cockpit reconvened with senior
Gates Shaw in charge. The principal
business of the meeting was the
drafting of a resolution, which ap-
pears elsewhere on this page.

The resolution was passed by the
students assembled at the Cockpit
and will be presented to the student
body at large at 1:00 this afternoon.

A proposal by senior Paul Mor-
row expressing concern over the
plight of students wishing to con-
tinue their classes was defeated.

Another motion to present the
Faculty with the proposal soon after
it was drafted last night was also de
feated following Shaw's remark
that “we don’t want to inundate the
faculty with demands which don't
even come from the student body as
a whole.”

Students Accept Proposal 4 to 1;

Faculty Modifies

In a_ special faculty meeting
Monday night, a resolution was
passed suspending absence regula-

tions entirely for the remainder of
the spring semester,

The faculty resolution gives stu-
dents the option of dropping out of
one or more of their courses but
continuing to take others if they
wish.

If students choose to do so, they
will receive a temporary grade of
“incomplete” in the courses, and
will be required to make up the
work they miss before September
30. If the work is not accomplished
by that date, they will receive per-
manent grade of “F.”

The faculty also voted to devote
“all available resources” of the Uni-
versity to conduct seminar-type pro-
grams throughout the remaining
two weeks of classes to analyze the
“economic, political, philosophical,
and sociological ramifications of the
Indochina War” and “other prob-
lems—present and potential—facing
our society and our world.”

President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced the faculty’s new action
following Monday night’s meeting.
which had been scheduled before
the results of the student referen-
dum were announced.

The faculty resolution did not
suspend final examinations, although
it did recognize the “significant and
sincere expression of concern about
major issues” on the part of the stu-
denis.

Ihe faculty’s action is an exten-
sion of a resolution approved last
week permitting students to absent
themselves for the rest of the semes-
ter, but not on a selective, class-by-
class basis.

Last Thursday, the faculty passed
a motion permitting students to ab
sent themselves from classes on an
individual basis if their consciences
direct them to do so. Under that
faculty action, work would
have to be made up before Sept. 30.

“The faculty of Washington and

Huntley Clarifies Faculty
Action For Student Body

“Do not confuse lack of agreement with lack of concern,” said Presi-
dent Huntley in his Tuesday afternoon speech to the student body as-
sembled on the lawn in front of Lee Chapel.

Student Leaders Condemn
ge rresponsible” Activities

Senior Gates Shaw convened an
informal student body assembly of
about 400 yesterday afternoon in
front of Lee Chapel with the words
“This is going to be truth.” The
meeting had been called by Presi-
dent-elect Fran Lawrence at the
boycott rally yesterday morning.

Phil Thompson, vice-president
elect of the Student Body, was the
first speaker, talking in behalf of the
current Executive Committee.

Thompson said that “the ultimate
responsibility of the EC is to repre
sent sentiment.” He stated that in
the “informal session of the com
bined Executive Committees held at
midnight on Monday had “condemn
ed the lack of faith” shown by the
faculty.

Having talked
Huntley yesterday afternoon, how
ever, Thompson felt that the E¢

Thompson explained the faculty
felt obligated to the University to

culum requirements. He felt that
the situation had reached “a stand

decision on the overwhelming ap-
proved student referendum.

At the same time he commented
upon the events of the past several
days on the Washington and Lee
campus.

Huntley opened the proceedings
by reading the faculty’s report on
the referendum, and followed with
presentations of “clarifications” of
both the original and the revised
faculty proposals,

He stressed that any senior who
exercised the “I” option and post-
poned his work until September
would be postponing his graduation
until October.

He also addressed remarks to stu-
dents intending to refrain from regi-

stration this week, pointing out that
such students would be given the
opportunity to register in eStpember
and would be, under long-standing
University policy, a part of the Uni-
versity during the summer.

The President believed that the
faculty shares the students’ concern
and had acted, in his belief, respon-
sibly.

The defeat of the proposed pass-
fail option, which was understood
clearly by the faculty, was the result
of two factors, the President said.

First, Washington and Lee has no
way at this time, of assessing the
wisdom of taking the option, and
secondly, such an option was con-
sidered “tantamount to cancelling
the operations of the University.”

The President closed the meeting
by urging students not to “con-
fuse lack of agreement with lack of
concern,”

 

(Editor's Note: The following
is the text of a statement issued
by President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley on May 11, 1970. It is not
intended as the text of his speech
before the student body Tues-
day; however, it does outline his
feelings concerning the faculty
resolution passed Monday night.)

I do not believe it can be said
the faculty “rejected” Monday's
student resolution. The faculty
clearly wished to express affir-
matively that it shares the deep
concern of students on national
issues, and wishes to underscore
the importance of that concern
in every way which is consistent
with their responsibility.

The faculty intended to accept
—and | believe it is perfectly
clear from the wording the fac-
ulty used that the faculty did in
fact accept—every premise which
the student resolution contained
in support of its position.

It can hardly be said that the
faculty made no substantial
changes in the policy it had
adopted only last week—a policy,
incidentally, which only four
days ago was all that the students

 

A Statement From The President

asked for.

It can hardly be said that the
faculty has merely “re-affirmed”
its action of Thursday. Last
night's resolution represents a
significant extension of that ac-
tion in an important respect.

Of the requests contained in
the student resolution, explicit or
interpreted by students as being
implied in it, the faculty turned
down just one.

That one would have cancelled
all academic work outright for
anybody for any reason. I be-
lieve that implementing that ac-
tion would be tantamount to
closing Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, and closing the univer-
sity, or taking any action which
would lead to a de facto closing
of the University, would in my
view and in the view of the fac-
ulty be unfair and unwise.

reasonable and thoughtful atti
tude being taken by the great
majority of Washington and Lee's
students, who understand the
substantial new options given
them by the faculty and who I
hope now wish to get down to
the business of exercising them.

President Robert E. R. Huntley,
May 11, 1970

[t is impossible for anyone in this community to step back
and evaluate this past week objectively; and we will not be so
foolish as to make the claim that we will be able to.

It seems that the spirit which engendered the events of
the past week has been wasted in what has become our own
World War I —a trench warfare of dialogue set in a jungle
of confusion. We must make a conscious effort now to revive
that original spirit.

On the part of the students this spirit is of a deep and
sincere distress in a time of national moral crisis. Unfortun-
ately, there seems to be a danger in that the sharing of this
spirit by the faculty has not been recognized by the student
body. The fact is, this concern is mutual; the faculty and stu-
dents both agree.

The spark of concern that has been enkindled on campus
must not be put out in a backfire of misunderstanding. The
faculty and the students have intensely considered the issues.
It is not a time for coercion; we must not wage war here. The
spirit of deep and sincere concern must be directed once
again to the original issues involved.

Faculty and students should lay aside their misapprehen-
sions about each other’s relative opinions. We should all take
advantage of the opportunities that have been made available
by the actions taken——and come together.

Two Views On

By Dave Olson

“This has been a tremendous re-
affirmation of the potential of the
WAL student body. There is hope.”
Fran Lawrence stated the case beau-
tifully.

We have seen in the past few days
an extraordinary series of acts on
the part of the student body. What
they have done is, to this writer,
amazing. We have come out of our
noted apathy and worked. We have
worked hard to do something to-
gether, and we did.

It took Kent State to do it, but we
did take action. If we, as a student
body, can keep this kind of action
going, we can advance by leaps and
bounds next year. The only problem
is that these advances are contingent
on the acceptance of them by the
faculty and the administration.

What the faculty failed to realize
in their perfunctory, though sincere
consideration of the student pro-

posal is that they no longer are re-
quired to look after our well-being.
We are here to learn, not to be ad-

Virginia Beach” was a_ statement
heard from more than one member
of the faculty.

It astounds me that these faculty
members could so miss the point of
the student resolution. It was not an
attempt at getting out the easy way.
It was an attempt to achieve the
freedom that is necessary to do what
we have to do.

The reason the student resolution
got turned down is unclear, but
these are some likely choices. One,
the faculty could have a great great
lack of perception, but that is un-
likely.

They could feel that if they had
done something like institute pass-
fail, no one would show up for
their classes. I do not think the fac-
ulty is that sensitive. I think they
turned it down because of outside
pressure and certain things they
realized about the position of W&L

Certainly much of our money
comes from rather conservative
sources, and these sources would be
displeased (to say the least) if this
school had shut down, or if 80 per
cent of the student body left which
they probably would have done if a
pass-fail option had been instituted.
Can we blame the faculty? I think
not. For many of the faculty, WAL
is their whole life, their “raison
d'etre.”

They would not want to take a
step that would endanger the life of
this university and subsequently
their jobs. It is a very real and a
very human consideration, but |
wonder if, at this juncture in the
school year, if pass-fail (which really
was the desire of the students)
would have made that great a diff-
erence.

I don’t think it would have, and
many schools (Brown and Yale in-
cluded) have pass-fail for every-
thing. Would it have made that
much difference if W&L had done
it for one semester?

rhe faculty seems to feel so be-
cause it would look bad to graduate
schools,

The faculty still clings to the idea
that they have to protect us from
the onerous possibility. It is a mani-
festation of the idea of in loco par
entis, and even more so, the genera-
lion gap.

The difference is that the faculty
feels that they have to retain a cer-
tain semblance of hierarchy and ad-
ministrative security while the stu-
dents feel that WAL has to make 4

By Reeve Kelsey

The crisis continues, but today
one hopes that the worst is over.
What happened and what does it
mean? One has observed a generally
activist student body and a flexible
response on the part of the faculty.

The initial faculty action showed
an understanding on the part of the
faculty of the need to combine the
deisres of the concerned students
with the academic integrity of the
University.

The faculty action with its Mon-
day night amendments allows those
students who feel intellectual pur-
suits are no longer germaine to the
problems they face to leave the Uni-
versity community and make up
their work at a later time. The fac-
ulty action also reaffirmed the basic
purpose of the University—to teach
and to be a home for intellectual
activities in all disciplines,

rhe student resolution, itself, was
a poorly worded document offering
something for everyone.

We feel that a resolution of this
nature must stand independent of
outside interpretations. The student
proponents cannot invoke the plea
of Humpty Dumpty when he said,
“When I use a word it means just
what I choose it to mean—neither
more nor less.”

There was not something in the
resolution that appealed to all stu-
dents, even the 254 who explicitly

rejected the proposal. The resolu-
tion did contain two regretable
phrases, “closing Washington and

Lee” and “Declare all classes can-
celled.” If the proponents of the re
solution did not really want classes
cancelled, why were these two
phrases left in the proposal?

The second major objection to the
plan was that there was no guaran-
tee that classes would continue as
scheduled. A professor would not
have been obligated to continue
classes.

There are many other problems
involved in ending the semester on
May 6. Is it really ethically justifi
able to give a student a “B” for
four-fifths of the work of last year's
“B” student? How does a professor
really give a grade if the only work
to be turned in for the course was

“W &L’s student

body is now activist—
the days of apathy are
at last truly dead and
buried. It is the job
of student leadership
to channel this ac-
tivism into posi-

tive results.”’

Aftermath

the final exam?

What does this mean for the fu-
ture? W&L’s student body is now
activist—the days of apathy are at
last truly dead and buried. It is the
job of the student leadership to
channel this activism into positive
results. Results that complement the
goals of the University.

The long run implications of the
student action are of such signific-
ance not to be overlooked. Is the
abandoning of a structured curri-
culum a decision that should be
made under the immediate stress
of an outside issue?

There is much to be said for an
unstructured curriculum with the
student doing what he desires. Next
year’s short term is an effort to
postively face this issue.

Furthermore the faculty's pres-
ent resolution has serious ramifica-
tions. Can any student at any time
for any reason withdraw and re-
ceive an “I” grade? The implica-
tions of the student resolution
even more severe.

Does a student have the right to
leave classes at any time for a rea
sonable cause and receive a “P” for
the work that he misses? Again
these are all legitimate questions,
but ones that should not be resolved
in the fast moment of the events of
last week.

Yesterday's assembly seemed to
focus directly on who should weild
the power in a university. We have
long argued that the faculty should
not act “in loco parentis” and we
will continue to.

are

However, we feel that the faculty
or the administration should have
ultimate jurisdiction over matters
pertaining to the curriculum. The
students should not have the final,
ultimate jurisdiction over what
courses to be offered, how the cur
riculum should be structured of
what professors should be hired

There should be

student repre
sentation in these decisions, and
there has been increasing student

participation in these areas

There now exists a tremendous
force for action in the student body,

By Greg Raetz

For a week now the only issue on
this campus, and most other camp-
uses around the country, has been
student protest against the war, On
Monday W&L students registered
their opinions on what our univer-
sity’s role should be in this nation-
wide movement. By better than four
to one the students voted to “close.”
(It is left to each who reads the pro-
posal to decide what this word
means.) On Monday evening the
faculty considered thte issue.

The results are known to all of
us. What has been obscured in the
aftermath of the faculty vote are the
multitude of considerations which
faced the faculty in addition to the
clear mandate by the students to
“close” the University.

It is easy to look at the lopsided
“yes” vote of the student body and
conclude that the faculty and ad-
ministration arbitrarily overruled
the wishes of the students. This,
however, assumes that there is some
sort of divine right in the majority
and that the majority is always right.
It also assumes that all other con-
siderations individually and in total
are less important than the student
vote, a vote that has no real author-
ity to do anything except to apprise
the faculty of student opinion.

The faculty in making their de-
cision on the course to be taken by
the University had to consider the
impact that this decision would have
on the future policy of the Univer-
sity. Harvard and Princeton stu-
dents, after closing down their
schools, are now demanding a two
week holiday just before this fall's
Congressional elections. They'll
probably get it partly because they
know that the administration will

give in. In other words, an un-
healthy precedent has been set.
Washington and Lee chose not to
set this kind of precedent.

Another consideration that cannot
be overlooked is the alumni. Their
support and favor are essential to
the success of W&L. They contribute
not only financially, but also by ac-
tively recruiting prospective students.
Alumni are notoriously unsympathe-
tic to demands and threatened vio-
lence, and there is no reason to be-
lieve that they would feel any diff-
erently in this case.

The very nature of the student
proposal forced the faculty to con-
sider the student vote cum grano
salis. From the beginning the word-
ing was unclear, Because of the lack
of clarity the proposal meant differ-
ent things to different people. Conse-
quently there were “concern” votes,
“beach” votes, “fear” votes and who
all knows what other kinds of votes.
The fact that the proposal passed
became less important than the rea-
sons for its passage and some of the
reasons were not too good,

Each of the considerations men-
tioned above and many more, could
not overcome the student considera-
tion individually. But collectively
they should and did. The business of
the University is education and
there has been precious little of it in
the last week. It is time to realize
that and get back to work.

The 1970 Calyx will be available
for distribution to all students this
week in the University Center.

New Curriculum: A Cornucopia Of Courses

By Skip Paukert

With the registration of students
this week for the coming year’s
courses, the long, arduous efforts of
both faculty and students that creat-
ed the new curriculum seem to have
reached their climax. Although
many are apprehensive of the minor
problems which are bound to plague
the first years of any such innova-
tion, the general response to the
new schedule and courses is favor-
able.

If there exists a common direc-
tion underlying the varied reforms
of each department, it may be ex-
pressed quite succintly: more free-
dom. This new flexibility is not only
evident in the introduction of inde-
pendent study during the spring
term; it is reflected in broader dis-
tribution requirements, wider course
offerings, more seminars and tutor-
ials, fewer prerequisite restrictions,
and more flexible major require-
ments.

Students from all departments will
be going abroad during the spring
term, Journalism majors will be
working on their local newspapers
for credit, Religion students will be
delving into the mysteries of yoga,
and Sociology students will be serv-
ing internships for welfare work, In
short the possible avenues of learn-
ing should well nigh stagger the
boldest of imaginations.

Certainly the most publicized pro-
gram to be introduced next year is
the Spring term’s study abroad.
Language majors will receive the op-
portunity of living with a family
while studying in France, Spain, or
Germany. The Language depart-
ments are adopting, in the words of
Dr. Drake of Romance Languages,
“the outlook that the idiom conveys
the spirit and culture of a people.”
At the same time the program will
be open to students in other fields,

 

such as Political Science and His-
tory, to do research abroad and si-
multaneously gain a lingual and cul-
tural experience.

The Spring term will also provide
time for independent study in other
departments. According to Dr. Kim-
brough of Sociology, students will
be taking a more “active posture”
in their educational endeavors, per-
haps visiting a business firm for ana-
lysis or utilizing a computer for a
methodological survey, Dr. Buch-
anan of the Politics Department
visualizes students undertaking in-

Perhaps there is going to be the
chance to explore in depth the back-
ground of the Indochina war. Per-
haps there are going to be blocks of
time to discuss power, its uses and
abuses. Perhaps there is going to be
people-talk to define and refine our
idea of the new world that is so
painfully evolving.

There are books and books avail-
able for us to investigate. Often one
author leads us on to others. For
starters (and let us not stop!) we
could dig into such books as:
“Limits of Intervention” by Hoopes
“The U.S. and China” by Fairbank
“Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cam-

bodia” by Cady
“Towards Disengagement in Asia”

by Gordon
“The Power Elite” by Mills
“Who Governs” by Dahl

ternships in State government at
Richmond or other work of this
type off-campus.

Students of the Commerce School
may become involved in private busi-
nesses during the spring, and the
prospect of long field trips is now
before biology and geology students.
Therefore, in nearly every depart-
ment the Spring term offers some
form of independent study, be it on
or off campus, to fit the needs and
desires of the individual student.

Asian Economics will continue

Your Bookstore bill will be
mailed out by the end of this week.
It must be paid before the student
leaves campus. Mrs. Betty Munger,
manager, warns that a 10% summer
carry-over charge will be added
after June Sth. Also, all unpaid bills
after that date will be recorded on
the students’ transcripts which will
be withheld until payment. Mrs.
Munger added that the Bookstore is
in danger of major malnutrition un-
vont everyone feeds it well with hard
cash!

through the first term, and the Phil-
osophy department plans to offer a
course in Contemporary Radical
Political Thought.

An indication of the academic
movement to broaden perspectives
and to confront modern problems is
the increasing use of an interdiscip-
linary approach. This development
is evident in the areas of Compar-
itive Literature and History. Mem-
bers of both the Classics and His-
tory departments will share the po-
dium on a course in Ancient His-
torians and Histriography.

A dramatic example of interde-
partmental cooperation is the pro-
posed Seminar Colloquim for fresh-
men on the population problem.
The staff will represent seven de-
partments, from religion and philo-
sophy to biology and economics.
Biology Professor Nye has also in-
itiated a study to establish a similar
program dealing with environmental
problems.

Of course, this increased flexibil-
ity and freedom for the student has
not occurred suddenly in direct cor-
relation with the curriculum. “This
change has been constantly reflected
through the years, giving us a very
highly developed department for
undergraduates,” remarked Dr. Grif-
fith of Economics—and indeed the
same words could have emanated
from the lips of almost any depart-
ment chairman at Washington and
Lee.

Yet with the new courses, lessen-
ed restrictions, and the 12-12-6 for-
mat facing us this coming year, the
WAL student possesses a fresh and
creative challenge toward the self-
guidance of a truly liberal educa-
tion,

posted last season, but Coach Lyles
felt that this was still his best team
ever.

The Generals started the weekend
competition off on Friday against
the Colonels from Centre College in
Danville, Kentucky. The Colonels
jumped off to an early lead as they
scored one run in the opening frame
against W&L freshman hurler Bruce
King. The Generals bounced back
quickly to tie the score in the second
inning when Ellie Gutshall’s boom-
ing double into right center field
scored Scotty McHrystal from sec-
ond base.

The next inning told the story of
the game as the usually silent W&L
bats erupted for 7 runs. The big
blow came off the bat of catcher
Jack Baizley as he cracked his first
round-tripper ever. Ellie Gutshall
contributed another double as he
drilled a fast ball about 390 feet to
center field.

The game then settled into a
pitcher's dual with Centre gradually
eating away the 7 run W&L advant-
age. Bruce King was pulled in favor
of sophomore junk-baller Bill Green-
er. The score stood at 10-9 as the
game entered the last of the ninth.
Centre was not willing to die and
they placed runners on first and
second base with only one out.
Greener then got the next Centre
hitter to hit a soft line drive, that
looked like a sure base hit, behind
second base.

Second baseman John Nolan then
made a game saving catch as he
dove to snare the soft liner, then
flipped to the shortstop covering
second to force the runner and end
the game. The final score was 10-9,
and by virtue of a good draw the
Generals moved into the champion-
ship round against defending cham-
pion Washington University.

The Bears of Washington Univer-
sity took control after a slow start
and destroyed the Generals in the
final game by a score of 12-4. W&L

Bill Gatlin shows the form that

built an early lead on the strength of
some clutch hitting by John Nolan
and Ray Coates’ towering circuit
clout in the fourth inning, plus the
masterful pitching wizardry of ace
Bill Miller, who constantly worked
himself out of tight situations.

Then in the sixth inning the roof
fell in on Miller. Two walks and
two extra base hits brought Coach
Lyles to the mound to replace Mil-
ler with Greener. As it turned out
Washington was not finished with its
battering of the W&L mound crew.
All in all, 5 W&L pitchers were
kayoed for 11 runs in the final inn-
ings.

So the Generals early 4-1 lead
was wiped out. The Generals threat-
ened various times in the late inn-

got him to

   

lt
the finals in the CAC,

ings only to have the Washington
pitcher strike out the key batter. It
was the fifth consecutive baseball
bell for the St. Louis ball club.

The Generals placed two players
on the All C.A.C. team. Secondbase-
man and Co-captain John Nolan
who played errorless ball and contri-
buted some timely hits was justly
rewarded, Next year’s captain, jun-
ior Ray Coates made all C.A.C.
outfield on the strength of his bat in
the final game and also errorless
ball in the field. Many felt that
catcher Jack Baizley, who led all
WAL hitters and played superb de-
fense should have been awarded a
C.A.C, berth, but the opposing
coaches chose the Sewanee catcher
over “Clooty.”

Tennis Team Takes

Fourth In The CAC’s

By Lee Thalheimer

Washington and Lee’s tennis team
met a very disappointing end to a
great season, After doing extremely
well throughout the season during
which time they lost only two
matches to very strong teams from
Duke and U.Va., they were upset
at the CAC tournament at Sewanee.
The season record of 10-2 was the
best ever under Coach Canfield.

Neer Captures 3rd CAC Crown

The Washington and Lee Track
Generals once again participated in
the annual spring conference meet
held at Sewanee this year, Last year
at Centre College in Kentucky, the
team managed a_ successful cam-
paign, finishing second,

WAL finished with a fifth place
showing.

The first day of the meet progress-
ed well for the Generals as Mike
Neer once again easily brushed off
all other high jump competition and
he streaked to his third consecutive
victory at the conference meet. He
was unable to raise his record as
there was no competition to press
him. Dave Stone handed in a fine
performance, taking fourth place in
the high jump, making six feet. He
will refinitely figure into the future
of the team with Neer graduating,

The triple jump provided disap-
pointment as Mike Neer was only
able to take fourth and no one else

even qualified. Mike Carrere put
the Generals back on the winning
track as he followed in Neer’s foot-
steps and took his third consecutive
javelin conference championship.
But as in Neer’s case, he was not
able to better his record,

The consistent problem for the
track team all year long has been
their lack of sprinters, and this prov-
ed out very significantly at the con-
ference meet. The General sprint
relay struggled to a fifth place finish,
and no one was able to qualify for
the 100, 220, or 440 yard dashes.
This killed all chances for any hope
of a decent finish.

The second day of competition
was a long uphill climb for the
track squad with few highlights. The
440 yard hurdles and one mile run
failed to produce any points, but
Paul Suthern and Mike Neer storm-
ed back taking a second and fourth
place. Suthern is only a freshman,

Tennis Team Takes CAC Fourth

(Continued from Page 4)

The CAC seemed to go all wrong
for the Generals. For a start Driscoll
became sick and had to default in
singles and doubles. From the look
of the draw he would have reached
the finals in both. At the number
three spot Washburn had the bad
luck of drawing the winner in the
first round. Bill Gatlin at number
one reached the finals only to lose in
a hard fought match. At the number
six spot McJunkin reached the finals
where he won the first set easily
only to end up losing. Rick Arm-
strong, the number five man, had
an especially bad time, being elimi-
nated in the first round, after being
the number one seed.

In doubles the number one team
had to default. The number two
team did win their first match, but
lost in their third. The number three
team reached the finals. Although
leading in both sets, Armstrong and
McJunkin eventually fell to defeat,
ending W&L’s bid in CAC competi-
tion,

Despite the disappointing loss the
season had to be considered a suc-
cess. The team had a fine record
and all of the squad besides the
starting six got a chance to play.

The team worked hard in all
matches, There were several matches
in which the outcome depended on
doubles and these cases W&L won.

Individually the members of the
team had a fine season, Washburn
and Driscoll led the team in vic-
tories with eight. Washburn was par-
ticularly exciting since in three or
four matches he fell way behind
only to come back and win. Driscoll
was the boy with the most hard
luck. Besides the illness at the CAC,
he had back trouble all year that
hampered his serve, which might be
the best serve on the team. He still
managed to compile a great record,
and since he is just a sophomore,
he will be back. Tom McJunkin, the
captain of the team, also had a good
year. He led the team in won-lost
percentage. It was especially re-
warding to him, since, due to foot-
ball, his tennis game was a little
off at first. From hard work he was
able to come back and have a tre-
mendous season.

Bill Gatlin had a very competitive
year playing at number one, and he
will be back next year to lead the
Generals. Stanley Taylor had a hard
year at number two, but he is just
a freshman and will have three
more years to play.

Rick Armstrong had another
great year for the Generals. This
was his third varsity year, and next
year the team will sorely miss him.
One other player who had a good
year was John Keefauver. He com-
piled a strong 6-2 record, but un-
fortunately wasn't able to make the
CAC trip.

While the players and Coach Can-
field were disappointed, they offered
no excuses. They all have hopes for
next year, however, with the top
four players returning and besides
Coach Canfield has never been one
to make a habit of losing.

Golf Squad Ends Year;
Places 5th In Tournament

By Dick Singletary

The 1970 golf season was a disap-
pointment for Washington and Lee,
Having lost three starters from last
year, the team was faced with a re-
building year.

The season began favorably
though with a win over Bucknell at
the Upper Cascades course, which
was the home course for the links
men of W&L this year. The hopes
of an undefeated season did not last,
however, when a surprising team
from Madison upset the Generals.

After a trip to Norfolk, where the
golfers lost to East Carolina and
tied Old Dominion, W&L went to
the state championships at the Cas-
cades. A presentable showing by
Ken Carter, who shot at 154, was
all that salvaged the day, however,
as the Generals dropped to a dismal
eleventh.

WAL hung on to win over Hamp-

den-Sydney and tied Roanoke to
bring the season to a 2-2-2 record.
In the final effort of the year, the
Generals retired Bridgewater to end
a winning but disappointing season.
Finally, in the CAC’s last week,
Carter and Marquess ended two days
at 158 to tie for W&L’s low when
the Generals tied down last spot in
the golf event.

With returning lettermen Ken
Carter, Jack Marquess, Bill Martin,
Brandon Herbert, and Bob Storey,
the Coach believes he has the nu-
cleus for a respectable team. And
respectable they must be, since the
schedule includes next year David-
son, Duke, and U.Va. Also the Gen-
erals next year are looking forward
to the opening of the 18 hole Lex-
ington Country Club as their home
course again, which they hope to be-
come the sight of continued W&L
success.

A NEWS ANALYSIS

IFC Self-Study

By John Robinson

In the last academic year two fra-
ternities have folded at W&L and
many individuals predict an increase
of this phenomenon next fall. At an
opportune time the IFC has receiv-
ed an forward-looking, 22 page self-
study that, if implemented, may halt
or curtail this trend.

Seven months in the making, this
report encompasses six basic fields
of fraternity interest, i.e., IFC struc-
ture, academics, social activities,
house construction, labor and food-
buying. Each field was carefully ex
amined and possible solutions to
existing problems were presented

The structure of the IFC was
found by the IFC Study Committee
to be far from efficient. Two major
stumbling blocks to efficient IFC
operations were classified as “a lack
of communication ... and a lack of
motivation.” To eliminate these
problems, a different voting proce
dure was recommended. This recom
mendation was that one vote be
awarded fraternity
dent, each fraternity IFC representa
and each IFC officer on the
Judicial Board.” ¢ urrently,

EC Discusses Publication A bpropriations;
Debates Increase of Student Payments

“As of last Friday morning, the
strike people took over the expenses
of their phone calls,” explained Sta-
man Ogilvie at Monday night’s EC
meeting. The expenses of the Strike
Committee were discussed with re-
gard to the money appropriated
Ogilvie by the EC last Monday,
which was to be used for a newslet-
ter and an information center.

The funds allocated by the EC
last week are now being restricted to
the publication of the newsletter.
The Strike Committee has organiz-
ed itself and has requested official
recognition by the EC as a student
body organization.

This request was presented to the
EC Monday night. The group sought
recognition in order to be able to
use the facilities of the Student Cen-
ter and to get a telephone without
paying the twenty-five dollar deposit.
Virginia Telephone and Telegraph
Company does not require the de-
posit from officially recognized stu-
dent body organizations.

Alan Prater introduced a motion
to recognize the Strike Committee,
which passed unanimously.

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

 

 

Larry Honig, President of the
Publications Board, appeared be-
fore the EC to request a 34 cent
raise in the student tax, to go into
the Publications Board reserve fund.

A motion was introduced by Alan
Prater to allow the raise in the stu-
dent tax. The motion was seconded
by Ogilvie and passed unanimously,

NOTICE
There will be a meeting of all
those interested in working on the
1972 Mock Convention tonight at
8:00 p.m. in Room 112 of the Uni-
versity Center.

W&L Moot Court Tournaments
Cite Markham, Gardner, Annand

A distinguished panel of judges
last week chose John J. E. Mark-
ham Hl, a freshman law student
irom Cambridge, Mass., as captain
of next year’s W&L National Moot
Court team.

Markham was chosen on the basis
performance in the final
round of the 1970 Burks Moot Court
Competition. Also selected for the
ieam Philip G. Gardner of
Martinsville, first arguing member,

of his

were

the four King-tum Phi Award recipients, (1. to r.) Marvin C.

and Stephen D. Annand of Charles-
ton, W.Va., second arguing mem-
ber.

Federal District Judges Ted Dal-
ton and H. Emory Widener and
Maryland Circuit Judge J. DeWeese
Carter presided over the final argu-
ment, which climaxed a semester-
long competition in which each
freshman law student wrote a brief
and argued a case involving mental
injury.

'

Henberg, Robert T. Schooley,

A motion was also introduced
and passed to reconsider this motion
next year,

Dan Silberberg, Interim Chair-
man for the Mock Convention, re-
quested an appropriation of $300
for summer expenses of the Mock
Convention. He indicated that the
money would be spent to have a
booklet printed, as well as for sta-
tionery and stamps for two mass
mailings by state and region chair-
men,

Dean Kumpuris pointed out that

the EC had paid for $400 of bad
accounts on the 1968 Convention,
and at the rate that funds were be-
ing requested, the EC would “end
up giving $1,000 to the Mock Con-
vention before it was all over.”

Staman Ogilvie suggested that Sil-
berberg send letters to parents re-
questing donations, and then finance
the alumni campaign with that
money.

The EC voted to allocate $100 to
Silberberg for the purpose of re
questing money from parents.

has taken an I option, may meet the
requirements of his probation either
on the basis of this semester's grades
when they are complete, or on the
basis of the grades of the Fall Term

A student who fails to meet the
requirements will be considered as
falling under the Automatic Rule in
December, 1970.

The regulations of the 1970-71
catalogue in Academ
Probation will apply to all students

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Two Presidents Look At The Future

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, May 20, 1970

The “Nonpartisan” Newsletter

Amid the hectic atmosphere of crisis which characterized
the W&L campus in the past two weeks, the Executive Com-
mittee, in the heat of the moment, authorized Mr. Staman
Ogilvie to oversee an unlimited emergency fund to finance
long distance telephone calls and a “Campus Newsletter.”
The EC’s intent was to disseminate urgently needed factual
news of fast-breaking events to the students, parents and
alumni of Washington and Lee.

According to Mr. Ogilvie, their purpose in allocating
these funds was to provide information which would “get our
own story out to parents and alumni” who were out of touch
with the events on campus, and to “‘stop the rumor mill” by
distribution of the newsletter here on campus. All information
to be given out was to be (again in Mr. Ogilvie’s words) “non-
partisan.”

Well, after W8&L was named “South Central Strike Head-
quarters” by the National Strike Committee, Mr. Ogilvie put
an end to the student body’s subsidization of long distance
telephone calls made by unauthorized people who were in-
tensely involved in the Strike movement. (One EC member
remarked that when he confronted what he thought to be an
unauthorized student using the information telephone
to make a long distance call, the student claimed, “I was given
authority by Ovilgie.”)

Although the student body is no longer paying for the
“South Central Strike Headquarters’ ” calls, it is still financ-
ing the publication of the “Campus Newsletter,” supposedly
a non-biased, factual presentation of the most recent events
on this campus and elsewhere.

In a perusal of the May 18 edition of the newsletter,
however, we found the following examples of “non-partisan”
reporting:

“The following is the text of the first major news confer-
ence of the South Central HQ at Washington and Lee on
Sunday, May 17, at 2 p.m.”

This comprised the headline for the text which followed it,
an excerpt of which is printed below. Nowhere in the newslet-
ter is there a statement of authorship for the text, other than
a recurrent “we” in the text and the mention of the “South
Central HQ” in the headline.

“|. There are many people in this country who read the
Bible, pledge allegiance to the flag, demand laws and order,
and then call themselves Americans. These people deplore
pornography, deplore protest, deplore other people. But
when it comes to the greatest of all their sins, they harbor,
they condone, they rationalize, they embrace murder. These
people are not holy, these people are not Americans, these
people are barely human beings. They pay for and vote for
murder in the name of flags, gods, countries, soldiers. These
people are the outlaws for they are the murderers by proxy.
Three headlines on the newsletter read: “Right On Jeff,”
“Movement For A New Congress,” and “Needed Badly: A
Ham Operator With Own Set, willing to aid the W&L Strike
headquarters with communications.”

And finally, from an article entitled “Report From Vir-
ginia Tech,” there is this brief remark about the student
strike: “Apathy is still the problem at Tech, as shown by the
2800 votes for either a strong or a weak strike and the 2400
votes in opposition to any strike.”

From this sort of content, it should be most obvious that
the “non-partisan” “Campus Newsletter” is, in reality, bla-
tantly partisan—in favor of the student strike. Which is fine.

Except that the student body is financing its publication.
We ask that the EC take one of three courses of action re-
garding the future of this newsletter: (1) Take away all stu-
dent body financial support immediately; or (2) quickly en-
sure that its future publication will not be marred by bald
instances of prejudice such as have been printed above; or
(3) state officially that it, as a governing body, supports the
partisanship typical of the May 18 newsletter.

We ask this not so much in the name of some journalistic
ideal of objectivity (which we, alas, continually fail to realize) ;
but rather in the name of responsible student government—
one that acknowledges, one way or the other, what its stand

is. : —L. L. Me.

By Swede Henberg
Student Body President

During the past weeks, several
issues of extreme importance have
been brought to the attention of
Washington and Lee students. Be-
ginning as a recognition of and an
interest in national issues, the stu-
dent mobilization on this campus
inevitably raised the question of
who controls the University—or,
rather, who should control the Uni-
versity.

From my viewpoint, it seems that
a great majority of student com-
plaints about the recent faculty ac-
tion stem from an unwillingness to
recognize what constitutes a uni-
versity. “We are now,” a student in-
sisted upon telling his fellows, and
I would agree. But the force behind
his remarks seemed to indicate that
for this reason students have no ob-
ligation to try and perceive future
ramifications of their action.

I would argue that ‘Now’ is pos-
sible only insofar as it is constituted
by past actions and future expecta-
tions. If this is true, the statement
“we are now” implies a concern for
the future of Washington and Lee
that I sense is lacking among many
students who have raised the issue
of control over the University.

The issue of student responsibiilty
and control did not spring full-
blown from the head of last week's
student resolution. Earlier this year,
the Executive Committee recom-
mended and had generally accepted
a number of changes in the constitu-
tion of faculty/student committees.
No doubt the sphere of student in-
fluence deserves further augmenta-
tion—but not before a careful con-
sideration of prior questions has
been undertaken.

One of those questions that must
first be answered is who should con-
trol the University. I will not at-
tempt dealing with this matter be-
yond pointing out its importance to
future action. The aspiration to
power on the part of students must
be shown to be a responsible interest
that goes beyond the intense, transi-
tory emotion of a few days or a few
weeks. The focus of my remarks will
be upon what I think must be done
before this issue of student respon-
sibility can be raised in any substan.
tive manner.

What the past few weeks have em-
phasized in my mind is the archaic
structure of student government at
Washington and Lee. As long as the
Student Body remained a largely
disinterested entity, | think the in-
stitution of an Executive Committee
was a viable one. Clearly, however,

 

our own deficiencies as to having an
effective Student Body organization
were shown up during the last few
weeks.

A twelve member Executive Com-
mittee simply could not respond to
the issues and at the same time give
students the feeling of participation
that was called for. The sort of in-
formal groups which arose are en-
tirely commendable—the Cockpit
sessions, etc, But out of this morass
rose the call for a student resolution
that was contradictory and, in my
opinion, could give to the faculty
no clear view as to what students
actually wanted.

All this, of course, is past history,
but one problem remains of affect-
ing a working option. To take a
pose from Joe Tompkins’ campaign,
I think we need a student senate ex-
panded to perhaps twenty-five or
thirty members. There may indeed
be some sacrifice of efficiency as
concerns internal working, but I
think the benefits would outweigh
the disadvantages.

Thus I would urge next year’s Exe-
cutive Committee and our Student
Body first to turn their attention to
the problem of their own organiza-
tion. Until some more effective
means of representation is possible,
the request for further student pre-
rogative is a vacuous one.

in some strange way, it is always
pleasurable, after high-intensity
events, to say “I was there!” Or to
remember exactly what one was do-
ing when one heard about, say,
Bobby Kennedy's death. It is a form
of resavoring the pain and excite-
ment, And there is an even greater
satisfaction in telling about past
events which have happened to you.

There have been some fascinating
talkers-about-myself in literature.
There is reporting on historical hap-
penings that went on before their
eyes: such as Mrs. Chestnut’s ir-
repressible “Diary from Dixie”. She
was close enough to the Confederate
seats of power to describe with sharp
wit and sincere emotion many events
of the Civil War. She was endlessly
curious and just plain hated it down
on the plantation. What's more she
never knew that her diary would
ever be seen by anyone.

By Fran Lawrence
Student Body President-Elect

The last few weeks’ activity has
both presented the basic problem at
Washington and Lee and provided
the fire needed to find the solutions
to these problems. What is the Uni-
versity? What is its relationship to
the nation? What determines Uni-
versity policy? How can views be
best represented?

The relationship here between
faculty and students has both bro-
ken down and been reaffirmed. A
new, deeper level of communication
has ensued from the apparent break-
down of real dialogue May 12.

Next year’s student government
must work, beginning now, to make
an understandable relationship of de-
cision-making in the entire Univer-
sity. All groups must recognize in
what areas special knowledge and
interest lies in any single group.
There is no question in my mind but
that students must take an increas-
ingly important role in determining
the direction and policy of this Uni-
versity. Those who would bear all
responsibility and power must share
both with students in more real
ways.

The Executive Committee must

continue to work as a governing
body in providing a non-political

First Person Singular

the interaction of outward events
upon the mind and sensitivity of «
truly articulate and intelligent man.
No one who hopes to understand
what the blacks of this country are
fighting against can get by without
a receptive reading of the “Auto-
biography of Malcolm X”. Required
reading for all human beings.

And there are others—greatly di-
verse—from the poignant “Diary of
Anne Frank” to Jerry Kramer's tale
of life in Vince Lombari’s Green
Bay Packers: “Instant Replay”.
President Nixon speaks in calm re-
trospect of his “Six Crises”, — while
one lives through (?) his seventh.

“Speak, Memory” by Nabokov,
one of the great stylists of his adopt-
ed language, English: “Memoirs”
by George Kennon and “Anti-Me-
moirs’ by Andre Malraux offer
widely different recollections of life
in Western Europe in recent decades.

Then after such listings, comes a

national activities. We must broaden
our basis of operation to include the
greatest number of people either
through extended committee activity
or constitutional revision.

| will work for a new emphasis
our town relations by an Inter-
Relations Committee. It will en-
courage the continuing interchange
of ideas and understanding between
town and University, promote a
sense of the University’s responsibil-
ity to the town, and mediate griev-
ances within the Lexington-W&L
community. As well, a committee
will be set up to help publicize and
coordinate campus activities. It will
work with. the University Center
Committee and the Free University
as well as other organizations to en-
courage a rich and varied program
of events.

The Free University has been set
up on a continuing basis as a flex-
ible non-political forum to provide
for education not a part of the cur-
rent curriculum, It has a student-
faculty directorship which will be
responsive to any members of the
community who wish to work with
and formulate “curriculum.”

In a more dynamic and involved
situation it becomes increasingly im-
portant to have a foundation of
mutual trust and respect among
members of the community. This, I
believe, is the essence of the Honor
System. We must extensively ef-
amine it and modify its penalty or
procedure not by way of denying its
importance as a basis for a real
community, but rather to reinforce
that importance in a community
that has undergone constant evolu-
tion since 1749,

The University must come up
with a new concept of housing in
the very immediate future. A void
must not be created by the changing
priorities toward fraternities. Stu-
dents must respond to this challenge
with creative ideas for housing that
is readily available for groups of
people who wish to live in a dorm-
like community but not in a dorm or
fraternity house. Perhaps the Uni-
versity should expand the Dutch
Inn type set-up to upperclassmen.

The Executive Committee must
broaden its own concepts, and those
of the University. At the same time,
it must provide new opportunities
and facilities in the current struc
tures for the varied forms of expres-
sion that are now emerging. Wash-
ington and Lee is in a great and ex-
citing transition, a revolution, and
we will have to work to capture all
the energy of this event towards
building an incomparable Univer-

sity si

Letters To The Editor...

No Official YR Stand

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As President of the Young Re-
publican club at WAL, I have been
the target of a great deal of criticism
in the past week for the alleged acti-
vities of the club in trying to keep
the university open.

The Young Republicans as a club
took no stand whatsoever, cither for
or against, the student body referen-
dum of May 11, 1970. It did not
endorse either side in any way. It is
true that many Young Republicans,
with the help of many others includ-
ing Young Democrats, were active
in the campaign to defeat the refer-
endum. By personal observation, |
noticed at least an equal number of
club members working quite actively
to close the university.

I, personally, have no idea how
the majority of the membership felt
towards the issue. Indeed, the Exe-
cutive Board of the Young Republi-
cans felt it could not take a stand
for this very reason.

Stephen M. Finley, ‘72

Future W&L Implications

To the Editor of The Ringtum Phi:

Last week's crisis at Washington
and Lee over the issue of concern
has terminated. If one atiempts to
piace the situation in perspective,
he will see that there are further
implications for the University—that
issues raised last week did not die
with last week.

A governing body musi be able to
comply reasonably with the desires
of those which it administers in or-
der to maintain their support. The
faculty is such a governing body,
and the students comprise the body
which is administered.

At WAL there are two general
governing spheres. The academic
sphere is subdivided beiween siu-
dent and faculiy government. The
Executive Commiliee and standing
student body commuitees constitute
a sub-sphere. and the faculty con
slittiies the other sub-sphere. The In

terfraternity Council, the Interfra-
ternity Council Judicial Board, and
the Student Control Committee act
as a legislature and judiciary for the
social sphere.

The social sphere and half the
academic sphere are readily respon-
sive to student needs because these
spheres are comprised solely of stu-
dents. As evidenced by the percent-
age of the student body voting in
favor of the resolution and the fac-
ulty's non-compliance with the major
points embodied therein, the faculty
is perhaps not readily responsive to
student needs. (in all fairness it must
be said that the faculty did have
valid reasons for coming to its con-
clusions.)

At this juncture the faculty must
become aware of the implications of
their decision. The students—re-
sponsibility, rationally, and indeed
nobly-——sought to have their desires
brought to fruition by working with-
in the system of government. Stu-
dent sentiment was made quite clear
by the voting.

It is a general feeling that these
desires were not satisfied by the
course of action which the faculty
chose to take. The question musi be
raised: in the future when there is
again such a strong feeling. will the
students work within the existing
sysiem of government? The answer
is probably “no.” Then it becomes
evident that there must be a change
in the constitution of the governing
body. If this does not occur, the
possibiliiy of violence—the only
other aliernative — cannot be dis-
missed,

It is the responsibility of the fac
ulfy to see that change comes so
that students will feel they have a
posilive course of action io under-
take. One possible answer is the es-
tablishment of a senate. This body
would be comprised of facully and
students, predominately the former
of it has no chance of being initially
esiablished. The senaie would then
act as a legislature for the affair
now handled by the faculty. (The
faculiy must sill exerce complete
control over grades and the grading

system.)

Another alternative is the place-
ment of more students on the stand-
ing faculty committees: the Execu-
tive Committee, the Committee on
Courses and Degrees, etc. (The re-
constitution of the Student Affairs
Committee is quite satisfactory.)
These students must have voting
rights. In effect these committees
present advice which is generally
followed by the faculty. In addition
the president of the student body
ought to be present for the entirety
of faculty meetings.

A change in the faculty's portion
of the academic sphere of govern-
ment is necessary. The expressed
manner in which this government
would be altered is purely persona!
feeling for a viable change. It is cer-
tainly not the general feeling of the
studemt body because that feeling
has not as yet been mobilized.

I was genuinely pleased with the
student response to the faculty's re-
solution. It is my earnest hope that
the faculty will make a genuine
response to the Washington and Lee
student body.

Chuck Cahn, “70

Return To Normaley?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Ph:

If the administration of this uni
versity (1 use the term “university”
with a degree of dowbi) is under
some apprehension that WAL will
make a “return to normalcy,” 1
hope that they will be mistaken.

if normalcy is checking in for
classes and then scattering off down
the hill. I hope it will be only an
illusion. If normalcy is remaining in
isolation from the problems of our
world, | hope again that they will be
wrong.

| hope that the administration
does not call into question the in-
tellectual curiosity of the students.
For if they do so, they would be, in
a sefise, condemning their own a f-
ling reactions. Hypocrisy is not en-
viible or respectable

ihe faculty action on the saudeni

resolution showed, if nothing else,
where the students stand in the ad-
minisiration’s eyes — NOWHERE:
If a list of administration priorities
were drawn up, it seems probable
that the establishment of a Univer
sity Community would choke to
death on some “shifting sands.”
But all is not lost. Even though
the Indo-China issue transcends all
others in urgency, there is one ques-
tion which is going to arise again
and again and again. When is
Washington and Lee going to stop
this educational stagnation and re-
turn from its I88-year road trip?
Peter J. Faillace, Jr., ‘73

A Change In Concern

fo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
When I was a student at Washing-
ton and Lee, there was a general
feeling of apathy and uninvolve-
ment throughout almost every sector
of the campus community. People
were more concerned with their
weekend date. or tubing at Goshen,
or Finals Weekend, or some other
event which at thal time even |
thought to be more important than
politics, or the drafi, or the war,
WAL is rather isolated from the
rest of civilization and it's easy to
tune out on all thal’s ecing on oui
side of Rockbridge County.
However. | dont know how it ik
back there now. Things might have
changed. I only hope they have. and
that there is concern over the recent
invasion of Cambodia and over the
deaths of four fellow students only
three or four siates away. You don‘:
have fo go to extremes like at Berk
ley or Maryland or even here at
Sianiord, bul you can do some con
sirtuctive things like sending a fac
ulfy-student delegation to Washing
ton or by writing letters to € ongress,
ele
Finals Weekend won't be endan
eered, Goshen won't be shut down,
but maybe the world and thik caun
try will be a little more straightened
out. Think about i

390 Enter
Next Fall

Largest Class In History

Greater Diversity
Noted By Farrar

A record freshman class of 390
men will enter Washington and Lee
University in September, with one-
quarter of the class sharing in more
than $200,000 in financial aid, also
a record figure.

The number of applications for
admission was up eight per cent, to
1,250, from a year ago, according
to James O. Farrar, director of ad-
missions,

The university offered admissions
to 756 of the applicants, he said.
More than half—52 per cent —- ac-
cepted the offer, up from 47 per
cent last year.

In 1969, Washington and Lee en-
rolled 364 freshmen from a field of
770 who had been offered admis-
sion. This year, the university was
able to be more selective, offering
admission to a smaller number from
a larger group of applicants, with a
larger proportion of offers being ac-
cepted than a year ago, Farrar said.

Altogether, Washington and Lee
will provide $200,380 to freshmen
next year through a wide range of
scholarship, direct grant, work-study,
loan, and combination programs, ac-
cording to Dean John Mehl, direc-
tor of financial aid programs.

More than three-quarters of that
total, $150,935, will be in the form
of direct university grants. Federal
Office of Economic Opportunity
grants will total $12,700, he said.

Freshmen will receive more than
$32,000 in loans next year, $18,635
in federally sponsored National De-
fense Student Loans and $13,385 in
university loans, Dean Mehl said.

Of the 390 members of the fresh-
man class next fall, 101 will receive
financial assistance under one or
more of the programs, he said.

The entering class will include 17
Negroes, Farrar said. Altogether, 42
applications were submitted by
black students, and 29 were offered
admission, he said. All 17 will need
financial assistance and will partici-
pate fully in the various aid pro-
grams.

Applications were received from
40 states, the District of Columbia
and a number of foreign countries,
Farrar said. More than 20 per cent
of the students who applied were
from Virginia, 284 of the total
1,250. Large numbers of applica-
tions were also received from Mary-
land (126), Pennsylvania (90), New
Jersey (88), New York (76), Texas
(48), Florida (46), and North Caro-
line (44),

Dean Farrar said he was pleased
with the admissions picture. The
eight per cent increase in the num-
ber of applications received and the
five per cent increase in the number
of students who accepted offers of
admissions are “very healthy signs,’
he said,

The cost associated with a private
college as opposed to public college
have generated concern for the fu-
ture of the small, independent in
stitution, he said.

“The figures on next fall's enter-
ing class suggest that Washington
and Lee is meeting those challenges
with remarkable success,” he com-
mented.

Included in the 1970 freshman
class will be 47 sons of alumni, Far
rar said, the largest number since
1967 when 50 sons of alumni en
rolled,

Eleven Rockbridge County area
students are included in the 1970
entering class and will live at home
Freshman dormitory rooms will be
provided for 360 of the 379 resi
dent students, and the remaining
freshmen will be accommodated in
other housing

Dean Farrar said it has been cts
tomary for a small number of pro
spective freshmen to change their
minds about attending WAL during
the summer before they enter col
lege originally accepting offers of
admission. In recent years, that
number has generally been between

2 and 15,

If that were to occur again this
year, fewer freshmen would have to
be housed apart from the freshman
dormitories, Farrar said

The 17 Negroes who plan to en
rol at WAL this fall represent the
latgest group of blacks admitted to
the university in any single year

Number 44

316 Men Are Graduated Today;

3 Receive Honorary Degrees

Three hundred and sixteen stu-
dents, together with three honorary
graduates, received degrees today
during the University Commence-
ment exercises on the front lawn of
the campus.

Anthony M. Coyne of Decatur,
Ga., one of two undergraduates to
receive two degrees, delivered the
valedictory. In keeping with tradi-
tion remarks were delivered by Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley, rather than by an outside speak-
er.
The Commencement _ exercises
were preceded by yesterday's Bac-
culaureate Service in Evans Hall, by
the alumni luncheon in honor of the
graduates and their families, and
by last night’s presidential reception.

Earlier this morning, Brig. Gen.
Herbert J. McChrystal Jr. presented
commissions as secoind lieutenants
to 44 graduates of the University’s
ROTC program. McChrystal’s son,
Scott, was one of those commission-

ed during the ceremony in Lee
Chapel.
This morning’s graduation was

conducted with the traditional cap
and gown attire ruled optional. Presi-
dent Robert E, R. Huntley, acting
on a recommendation from the fac-
ulty executive commfittee and a stu-
dent petition signed by more than
half of the Class of 1970, announc-
ed that those who wished to wear

To Head Up Fmancial Aid, Orientation

Two recent graduates of Washing-
ton and Lee will hold important
positions in the University’s admini-
stration next year. William A.
Noell, Jr., a Washington D.C. attor-
ney, will become director of student
financial aid and assistant dean of
students beginning Sept. 1. William
McC, Schildt, a member of the ad-
ministration since 1968, will become
associate dean of students and co-
ordinator of the freshman year al
WAL. His appointment takes effect
July 1.

As director of financial aid, Noell
will supervise and administer the
various scholarship, grant, work-
study and loan programs at the uni-
versity, which this year have distri-
buted more than $500,000 among
students who could not otherwise
attend Washington and Lee.

Noell is a 1964 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee and earned his law
degree from the University of Vir-
ginia in 1969, While an undergradu-
ate at WAL, he was President of the
Student Body, and an outstanding
intercollegiate debater. He was
elected to membership in Phi Beta
Kappa and in Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, national leadership society.

Following his graduation, Noell
studied for a year in Germany un-
der a Fulbright Scholarship.

As a law student at the Univer
sity of Virginia, Noell was a mem
ber of the editorial board for the
Law Review and served on the
Moot Court Board. He was also a
member of the Quadrangular Moot
Court Team, which included law stu
dents from Yale and Columbia Uni-
versities and the University of Penn
sylvania, as well as Virginia.

He took a year from his law stu
dies to return to WAL as acting di
rector of student financial aid in the
1967-68 academic year. Since 1969
he has been associated with the law
firm of Kirland, Ellis, Hodson, Chaf
fetz. Masters and Rowe in Washing
ton.

“Washington and Lee is indeed
fortunate that Bill Noell has agreed
to return as director of financial

aid.” Lewis G. John, dean of stu
denis, said in announcing the ap
pointment

“In his earlier service as a mem
ber of the university administration
he demonstrated unusual insight and

capability. We are extremely pleased
he will be working with us again.”

Schildt, 27, was also a member of
the Class of 1964 at Washington
and Lee, graduating with a bachelor
of arts degree in economics. He
earned the bachelor of laws degree,
summa cum laude, in 1968 at W&L.
Like Noell, Schildi is a member of
both Phi Beta Kappa and ODK.

He was named an instructor in
the School of Law in February,
1968, and in September of that year
he was appointed assistant director
of admissions and assistant dean of
students.

In his newly created freshman co-
ordination post, Schildt will have
primary responsibility for planning
and administering programs for en-
tering students. Among his new
duties will be supervision of fresh-
man orientation and the faculty ad-
viser system, as well as coordination
of the upperclass counselor pro
gram in the freshmen dormitories.

In announcing the appointment,
President Robert E. R. Huntley
said: “The capabilities Bill Schildt
has demonstrated as assistant dean
of students and assistant director of
admissions convinced me he is ex-
ceptionally qualified to take on these
exiremely important new duties.

“The continual availability of 4
single member of the administration
will be of enormous benefit, 1 be
lieve, to entering students who will
be facing the complex and difficul:
transition from high school to col-
lege life,” President Huntley said.

1952 and of the State Senate from
1952 until 1960. He was elected

governor in 1965,

Judge Hoffman, a graduate of
Washington and Lee’s School of
Law, also received an honorary

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK From Two Presidents To The Freshmen

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Friday, June 5, 1970

To The Entering Freshmen...

This newspaper comes to you as another piece of printed
matter from Washington and Lee University, your home for
the next four years. We imagine that The Ring-tum Phi,
along with other pieces of paper which you are receiving over
the summer, will make that college you’re going to attend in
September all the more mysterious.

Not that this newspaper along with dozens of other print-
ed materials does not answer most of the questions you might
have. For instance, you should be well aware of W&L’s new
curriculum which goes into effect next year. No doubt you've
been informed of the new Freshman Orientation scheduled
on campus next year. Not that it matters to you, but you will
be the first incoming freshmen in quite a while who don’t have
the dubious distinction spending three days and two nights
at Natural Bridge under the old Freshman Camp system of
orientation, now restructured into Freshman Orientation on
campus.

You should be receiving an Interfraternity Council Rush-
book in a few weeks as well. It will explain the new deferred
rush system which will go into effect this fall. As a member of
the Class of 1974, you will be the first students to participate
in a seven week deferred rush system rather than the tradi-
tional one week’s rush which W&L had in the past.

You have received or will receive information on practic-
ally every aspect of life here in the Washington and Lee com-
munity. Yet no scrap of paper can convey to you the solution
to the mystery of what it’s like to be a member of the Wash-
ingtn and Lee community. And we do not pretend we can
either.

We can tell you that W&L has a sense of tradition. Not
static but evolutionary tradition. The changes mentioned
above were the result of a careful study by students, faculty
and administration of their own community of how W&L
should evolve out of old traditions into newer ones.

We can tell you that conventional dress, consisting of a
coat and tie, is worn less and less on campus. But the essence
of what is termed a “Washington and Lee gentleman” is not
any less present, even though its traditional mark may be dis-
appearing. Students still recognize the honor system which
sets a basic code to live by: a W&L gentleman does not lie,
cheat or steal.

We can tell you that as a whole the student body has be-
come more vocal in expressing its views on issues within and
without the campus. A large majority of W&L students voted
in a referendum last May to petition the faculty to suspend
classes so that national issues could be studied here on camp-
us, with the provision that those who wanted to attend class
could arrange it with their professors. The students respon-
sibiliy accepted the faculty’s decision not to cancel any classes
but to provide other outlets for those who wanted to become
involved in a study of national affairs. They did not destroy
property or threaten the lives of others. In short, they acted
as responsible members of the W&L community.

W&L is changing; it is growing; yet it is retaining its sense
of tradition. You will become a part of this change, this
growth, this sense of tradition. Washington and Lee offers
you nothing more than a challenge to an education—and a
way of life. It remains your responsibility to take up that
challenge.

During your four years here you will be a part of Wash-
ington and Lee’s community. It will be your community, your
education, your way of life. And when you leave in June of
1974, see if you don’t pause during the graduation ceremony,
look up at the colonnade, and finally realize what it really
means to be a Washington and Lee gentleman.

By Robert E. R. Huntley
President, Washington and Lee
Last year, my message to new stu-

dents declared my belief that rarely
had students enjoyed the opportun-
ity to enter college during a time of
such extraordinary intellectual ex-
citement and ferment. When a mem-
ber of my staff read this statement,
he said something to the effect of
“Boy, you can say that aagin!”

So, I think I shall.

Yours will be the first class to be-
gin under the new curriculum and
the new calendar, this in itself a
matter of great excitement and anti-
cipation for you, current students,
and the faculty. The hard work of
translating the broad design of the
new curriculum into a workable,
necessary structure of courses and
degree programs has been complet-
ed; now you and your classmates
will have the opportunity to go at
your college educations with a free-
dom and flexibility unprecedented
at Washington and Lee. It is an op-
portunity filled with hope and ex-
pectations of all concerned.

You have the right to expect that
Washington and Lee will help pro-
vide you with an experience — aca-

Calyx Presents Editions
To Recognize Service:

Colvin Chosen Dedicatee

Members of the staff of Washing-
ton and Lee’s yearbook, the Calyx,
have presented engraved copies of
the book to two members of the
University Committee in recognition
of service to Washington and Lee.

Miss Margaret Cullipher, the re-
ference librarian for the McCormick
Library received one issue for
“helping all students with reference
works and theses and sharing her
full knowledge of the archives.”

Dr. L. K. Johnson, Professor of
Commerce. received the other copy
for his great interest, throughout
the years, in his students and parti-
cularly the Calyx.

This year’s Calyx was dedicated
to Prof. Milton Colvin of the De-
partment of Politics in the School
of Commerce, Economics and Poli-
tics, and a candidate for the Demo-
cratic nomination for the Senate
seat now held by Harry F. Byrd Jr.

In the dedication, Colvin was
praised not only as an excellent pro-
fessor” but also as all man with “a
refreshing approach to education, an
enthusiasm fol life in general and
for people in particular.”

Freshman Camp

Washington and Lee's traditional
Freshman Camp, which has been
held at Natural Bridge for the past
38 years will be converted to an
on-campus orientation program be-
ginning this fall.

The decision was reached earlier
this year by the Student Affairs
Committee, which had been given
authority by the faculty as a whole.

Lewis G. John, dean of students,
said the decision came out of the
group's investigation of the camp
and was primarily influenced by two
factors.

First, he said, the new changes in
the curriculum scheduled for the up-
coming year, necessitated the intro-
duction of a more academically
oriented program compared to the
relatively basic outline of freshman
requirements that had been a part of
previous camp sessions.

Second, the newly instigated de-
ferred rush program will negate an
underlying purpose of the Natural
Bridge site-that is, the effort to re-
move freshmen from a hectic pre-
rush atmosphere.

John also said he feels that fresh-

demic and otherwise — that will
prove useful, perhaps even invalu-
able to you, now and in the future.
It may even be, in the jargon of the
moment, “relevant” and “meaning-
ful,” but above all, it should be an
experience that we can agree is
worth your time and best efforts, as
well as ours. You may be certain
that your professors and deans will
strive to meet the valid expectations
demanded of them by you, by them-
selves, and by the University in its
broadest compass.

Washington and Lee would, in
turn, expect certain things of you.
Foremost, perhaps, is the expecta-
tion that you will not treat lightly
the opportunity that is yours in the
coming year and those that follow.

Particularly we hope and expect
that you will approach your role as
a citizen of this campus and this
community with a deep sense of re-
sponsibility. You will find that your
views and your individuality are
respected here; such respect must be
mutual and tempered with toler-
ance and self-discipline if the educa-
tional strength of Washington and
Lee is to have meaning for you and
your fellow students.

Turner Chosen

Academy Head

Edward F. Turner Jr., professor
of physics and head of the depart-
ment at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, has been chosen president-
elect of the Virginia Academy of
Science.

Dr. Turner's election came at the
association’s 48th annual meeting in
Richmond last week.

As president-elect of the VAS, he
will succeed Maurice B. Rowe, com-
missioner of the state Department
of Agriculture and Commerce, when
Mr. Rowe's term expires next spring.

A member of the faculty at W&L
since 1957, Dr. Turner received his
Ph.D. from the University of Vir-
ginia, after earning his master’s de-
gree from the Massachusetts Instit-
ute of Technology and two bache-
lor's degrees from Washington and
Lee.

In 1969, he completed a detailed
study of the impact of modern tech-
nology on small-college libraries,
under a grant from the federal De-
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare.

men should become more familiar
with the Lexington campus and its
geography while undergoing their
orientation.

The increase in academic orienta-
tion, spurred on by vast new curri-
culum changes within the Univer-
sity, appears to be a certainty.

Subcommittees of the SAC have
studied possibilities for next fall's
orientation throughout the second
semester. A major part of this re-
search has been an investigation of
orientation at eleven other colleges.

The replies from the schools—

Princeton, Haverford, Williams,
Amherst, Dartmouth, Bowdoin,
Virginia, The University of the

South, Davidson, Lafayette, and Le-
high have been analyzed in an ef-
fort to find parts of these programs
that might prove useful next fall.

John said some of the schools
have shown surprise that Washing-
ton and Lee is abandoning its tradi-
tional approach to orientation,

By Fran Lawrence
Student Body President
To the class of 1974:

In three months you will be com-
ing to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. What should you expect from
the school? What does it expect
from you? Perhaps neither of these
questions should be asked, You are
not just coming here, but you are
becoming a part of the university.
Your expectations may be those you
seek as an individual. But there will
be new problems, new questions
posed. The search for answers to
these questions is the essence of
education, personal and social as
well as educational.

Washington and Lee is in a great
transition. A transition that is not
unlike the one of a hundred years
ago when R. E. Lee brought Wash-
ington College around to face the
new problems of a new country, In
some ways we will all be freshmen
next year, in an enviable position to
find new beliefs as well as reaffirm
valuable old ones. I am_ excited
about the immediate future of this
school, the years which your class
will play a great role.

We have not been untouched by
the upheavals in American educa-
tion. Many of the concepts of that
education are being challenged.
Washington and Lee has been re-
sponding well to that challenge,
with an awareness of its uniqueness
as a university. This school is in-
creasingly representative of the di-
versity of contemporary America.
A new curriculum and new activities
will continue to stress the impor-
tance of individual initiative and

responsibility. The university has
recognized its need for a real con-
cern for the welfare of the com-
munity and the nation. These, coup-
led with involvement in and becom-
ing a part of the Honor System and
its cohesive spirit, present us as in-
dividuals with a great challenge.

The university experience will be
unlike any other you have had. It
will demand thought, reflection,
considerations, and concern. It will
demand action and _ involvement.
That experience is not passive, As
students we must ask many ques-
tions. What is education? What is
the university and my role in it?
What are my responsibilities to my
self, my family, my school, my na-
tion, my world? What must [I do?
These are hard questions. This is
not, I think, an easy time. But
Washington and Lee has always pro-
vided a unique atmosphere of per-
sonal concern and respect. Members
of this community continue to care
in a deep way about one another.
This will help you and you must
help it by insisting that true ties go
beyond superficial differences in a
world that, I am afraid, has begun
to set apparent differences as bar-
riers to human relations. | am sure
that there is no greater value than
human bonds of mutual trust and
respect.

I hope you will start Washington
and Lee now by beginning to ask
these questions of yourself. 1 hope
you will then ask us these questions
and offer your solutions to our prob-
lems. We look forward to your be-
coming a very important part of this
university community.

Departments Planning For
Studies In Spring Term

A mini-semester in Europe next
year will be one innovative offering
as Washington and Lee University
adopts a flexible new curriculum
and academic calendar.

French, Spanish and German stu-
dents will be able to spend the six-
week “short term” in April and May
living with families in European na-
tions and participating in academic
and cultural programs, not in class-
rooms but in the foreign society it-
self.

Students going overseas will first
participate in a week-long orienta-

south of Lexington, the outings were
designed to acquaint students with
the varied aspects of college life.
Attendance was voluntary and ori-
entation was conducted in a series of
outdoor assemblies.

Freshmen lived together in small
cabin groups and each group was
led by an upperclass counselor. In-
formal intramural athletic competi-
tion was conducted and freshmen
were given the opportunity to speak
informally with members of the
University community.

Next year's Freshman Orienta-
tion, tentatively scheduled for Sep-
tember 8-10, will be under the gen-
eral supervision of William Schildt,
newly appointed coordinator of the
freshman year. Information about
the program will be circulated dur-
ing the summer.

tion program in Lexington, empha-
sizing intensive oral drills in the
language of the country they will
visit.

Once in France, Spain or Germany,
the students will participate in aca-
demic programs set up to include
local teachers as well as W&L fac-
ulty; they will visit historic and cul-
tural attractions such as theatres
and museums; they will absorb the
foreign culture more deeply and ac-
curately in the nation itself than
they might in months of classroom
study on W&L’s campus.

The cost of the program, esti-
mated to be about $900, will be
borne by the students. They will be
encouraged to remain in their for-
eign country beyond the formal con-
clusion ot the mini-semester, but
will have to plan their own pro-
grams after May.

The short spring term at W&L
was designed so students can work

wide variety of innovations which
will be possible when the new calen-
dar goes into effect.

Every department in the univer-
sity has re-vamped all its course of-
ferings because of the new calendar,
making more efficient use of two
normal 12-week semesters, the first
from September to December and
the second from January to April.
Each department has also taken full
advantage of the possibilities grow-
ing out of the short mini-semester,
by designing programs that are thor-
oughly new in concept and educa-
tionally invaluable,

, ll Hi, i uv

By Betty Munger
Manager of the W&L Bookstore

The recent—and continuing—de-
bate on the purposes and fitting func-
tions of the University applies to the
Bookstore as well as to the faculty,
administration, students and Alum-
ni. Just because the Bookstore is
located in one of the main thoro-
fares of the campus doesn’t mean
that we see ourselves as a passage-
way through college.

The Bookstore is owned and oper-
ated by the University on a non-pro-
fit basis. (In fact, we lose a little
money each year.) It’s basic purpose
is exposure to books—non-required
books. Practically all of the book
stock is paperback books on a wide
variety of subjects: Philosophy, best-
sellers, environment and survival,
art and even a bit of “pornography”
if there is any such thing these days.
There are books for parallel reading,
for term papers and for the explora-
tion of subjects which have attracted
the student’s enthusiasm in class.

About The Bookstore

And, very important, books for
sheer pleasure!

Each year there are “happenings”
such as Dabney Stuart’s reading of
his own poetry to an overflowing
crowd with cider and doughnuts
afterwards. Mr. Dan Walker, chair-
man of the Violence Commission
Committee which reported on the
Chicago riots, visited with students
over coffee one afternoon in April.
And there are times when the store
looks like some bright bargain base-
ment as surplus stock is put on sale
by the pound on a set of country
scales.

But the Bookstore is—if we do
our job well—more than that. It is a
place of ideas, discussion and laugh-
ter. The pressure is off here—and it
is a center for serious argument and
trivial talk. During the tumultuous
days of May the store seethed with
people, petitions and posters, and
persuasive politicking. This is as it
should be. Only unkindness is bar-
red.

Ju Painting ae For Expo ‘70

Professor I-Hsuing Ju, Washington
and Lee’s artist-in-residence, has re-
cently received word that one of his
paintings has been selected to be
shown in Japan’s Tokyo Expo 1970.
The work, done on a cold January
Saturday in Ju’s studio in Howe an-
nex, will be featured along with 99
other works in the Tenth Annual
Nanga-in Showing, “southern,” or
free-style of the Japanese Art As-
sociation,

The painting itself is 10 feet wide
by six feet high, and has also been
shown at the Tokyo National Mus-
eum, the Kyoto National Museum,
and the Osaka Museum. Even be-
fore the Toyko Expo, a thousand
postcard reproductions of the paint-
ings have been sold to visitors from
all over.

Earlier this year, a selection of
Professor Ju’s works was shown in
the University Bookstore. This show-
ing consisted of works which he had
done while here at Washington and
Lee, primarily of campus buildings
and winter scenes. Later in the year,
he held another showing of his
works in the gallery in duPont Hall,
in which a greater emphasis was
placed on his works in an Oriental
style.

About W&L Athletics...

By Gene Corrigan
Director of Athletics

The Washington and Lee athletic
program is geared for maximum par-
ticipation of the student body, and
we take this opportunity to advise
you of the program and let you
know that you are welcome to try
out for any of our teams.

Just to give you some ‘background,
during this past year, over 340 stu-
dents participated in the intercollegi-
ate athletic program, taking part in
12 different sports. It might be wor-
thy of your attention that the teams
won 64% of their games.

We are presently in the midst of
construction of a 2.5 million dollar
gymnasium addition which will cer-
tainly be something to look forward
to.

We feel that our athletic program
is a very fine one and one of the rea-
sons are the people involved. Many
of you have already been contacted
by our coaches but to those of you
who have not, I list our staff and
hope that you will contact them
over the summer if you're interested
in participating.

&L Gets Three All-Americans

Bill Brumback has once again
started things shaking, only this time
it isn't Doremus Gym but Wilson
Field. Brumback, a rising senior,
was selected for the First Team AIll-
American in lacrosse. He had a
little help this time, for Whit Mor-
rill and Ned Coslett also achieved
All-American status in third team
slots.

Brumback is the first W&L stu-

. .
dent to be All-American in two ‘n

spots. He shares this distinction with
very few people—people like O. J.
Simpson and Jim Brown, Of course
Brumback would have had a much
harder time had he not been sup-
ported by an extremely strong team.

Coming off last year’s frustrating |

1-8 season, prospects appeared dim
for the 1970 lacrosse team. There
remained a nucleus of the able up-
perclassmen from the year before,
and there was a large group of
freshmen on hand, but no one was
predicting much more than a so-so
season for the Generals.

were encouraging, but were not at
all indicative of the coming season.
In the opener W&L coasted by a
shoddy Geneseo State team, 9-2,
but days later fell to a surprisingly
strong Towson State team by 10-7.

So the Generals left for Pennsyl-
vania, They had but a 1-1 record, yet

despite the disappointing loss to
Towson, there had been encourag-
ing play. Senior attackman Tom
Groton had started with a bang,
scoring four against Geneseo, and
adding a fifth against Towson. Be-
fore the season’s end, Groton would
smash over 25 goals.

The first midfield of junior Whit
Morrill and freshmen Sam Engle-
hart and Chip Tompkins had also
looked good. Englehart joined Gro-
ton on the crease in an offensive for-
mation known as 2-2-2. His out-
standing total of 35 goals added to
Groton’s 25-plus, would give W&L
over 60 points from the crease alone
for the season.

Sophomore attackman Scott Neese
had five points against Geneseo and
kept his scoring total high all sea-
son. His total of 39 points by sea-
son’s end was the high for the team.
Scott was a First Team All-Confer-
ence selection and will co-captain
the team next year.

the Jay Stull Trophy for selflessness,
and Junior Bob Jantzen, in only
the second year of lacrosse.

On the third midfield were Mark
Skoggard and freshmen Ed Tognetti
and Tim Winfield, both of whom
showed tremendous potential. Coach
Szlasa ran all three midfields with
regularity, and herein was one of the
strengths of the team. Senior John
Thomas was expected to play on
one of the first two midfields, but
was unfortunately injured early in
the season,

The team suffered through a tedi-
ous northern trip, characterized by
lots of snow, and long bus rides
with the Jarred Mole Man. At the
end of the trip was a game with Vil-
lanova, and for three quarters the
score stood even. But as the previ-
ous paragraphs have pointed out,
there was quite a bit of offensive
talent on the squad and the team ex-
ploded in the fourth quarter, and
won hands down, 10-6. Englehart’s
five goals and Groton’s four spark-
ed the big win.

With this important game under
their belts, the Generals took off on
a six game winning streak. At this
point the unsung heroes of the team
should be mentioned—the defense.
The goalie is at the heart of the de-
fense, and goalie Bill Ingersoll had
a fine year, earning second team All
Conference honors. Especially note-
worthy was his outstanding effort in
the biggest win of the season—the
10-4 upset of Washington College.

All-American and co-captain Ned
Coslett also had a fine year. His
leadership was respected by the
team, who awarded him the Martin
Trophy for that trait—leadership.
Playing behind were junior Bill
Brumback and sophomore Tom

Smith. These two ran into some
spectacular attackmen during the
year—Maloney of Towson, Peter-
son and Seipe of Carolina, George
of Washington, Duquette and Gan-
non of Virginia—and did a fine job
on all of them.

Sophomore John Lamour and
freshmen Don Eaverson and John
Rogers all did excellent work when
called upon, especially in man-down
situations.

Another valuable asset to the
team was its strong bench. “Lucky
Chucky” Robson, “Ace” Graham,
Matt “2-2-2 on-the-crease” LaMotte,
“The Bookends”—John and Chappy
Conrad, “Beets” McLaughlin, Pete
Saunders, Tonnie Brown, “Cliffdwel-
ler” Radcliffe, and “Panel Truck”
Salmons. These players provided the
depth and flexibility necessary for a
winning team.

As the wins began piling up—8-5
over Duke, 10-7 over Baltimore, 20-
5 over Roanoke, 10-4 over Wash-
ington, 15-3 over Loyola—W&L re-
ceived a measure of national recog-
nition. Going into the game against
Carolina, W&L was ranked number
11 in the nation, Carolina was rank-
ed number 7, however, and the
game between the two was the finest
seen here in many years. Before a
large and enthusiastic crowd, W&L
came back from a 6-1 halftime de-
ficit to lead by 7-6, only to lose 8-7.

Following this heartbreaking loss,
WAL coasted by UMBC 12-6, then
faced national powerhouse Virginia.
Virginia was ranked number three,
but W&L was ranked number 19---
a far, far cry from the 1-8 record
the year before. Unfortunately Vir-
ginia was simply the better team,
and W&L fell by the disheartening
score of 19-3,

the number of applications this year
resulted partly from intense recruit-
ing efforts by the entire admissions
staff, other administrative personnel,
members of the faculty, and a num-
ber of students.

The university's ability to offer
substantial financial aid to students
who could otherwise not attend
W&L was another major factor in
the increase, Farrar said.
